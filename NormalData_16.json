["Q: Can a Lenovo T430s with Thunderbolt use 2011 iMac in target display mode? I just purchased Lenovo T430s laptop with Thunderbolt and I'm wondering if I should be able to use my 27\" 2011 iMac with Thunderbolt as an external display using target display mode.\nSo far, no luck.\nWhat I've done:\n\n\n*\n\n*I connected computers to each other with Apple's Thunderbolt cable.\n\n*I booted T430s and made sure that Thunderbolt is enabled in BIOS\n\n\nWhat I found out:\n\n\n*\n\n*iMac says that there's nothing connected to Thunderbolt\n\n*Pressing Command+F2 to enable target display mode does nothing\n\n*Windows 7 in T430s does not detect any additional displays and there's not a word about Thunderbolt anywhere in Windows.\n\n*Windows device manager is not showing any devices that are not functioning properly or missing drivers\n\n\nAny help or ideas would be much appreciated.\n\nA: Just got off the phone with Lenovo tech support after unboxing my T430s/i7 because it didn't have a Thunderbolt symbol on the back... just a DVI symbol. Confirmed: NONE of the 430's they're shipping even HAVE it yet. I'm sending mine back, suggest you do the same. The internet is saturated with references that they have it that all sound as though they are informed by press releases... and Lenovo chat even tells you they have it... but no joy. Technology never fails to disappoint. \n", "Q: What is the rsync command to restore from a TimeMachine backup I couldn't get my TimeMachine backup to restore, so I just used rsync. What are the flags I should use? I just used:\nrsync -av /path/to/backup /path/to/restore\nCan it be that simple?\nMy backup was on a USB disk, which appears to have preserved the disk structure. Does TM still do that multiple hard-links to files/dirs to save space? Does that affect what flags I should use.\n\nA: It's not that simple as the Time Machine may or may not store the files in a flat folder structure. Network backups are stored as a sparse disk image and furthermore rsync doesn't respect all the ACL and permissions that are possible or deal with special permissions on the User folder, user subfolders, Applications and other special cases.\nIf you can narrow down which files are being copied and confirm your machine directory is not stored in a disk image, rsync might be acceptable in limited circumstances to copy user files that lack special permissions.\nIn your specific instance - the files are indeed hard linked which will not make any difference to rsync. When you point rsync at a specific instance in time on your backup - it doesn't really matter how many other hard or soft links point at the files you are restoring. The storage system will read the data from the external drive just as if the files were the only copy on the USB drive. That's the magic of hard links - two directory entries point to the same file so that you can't tell when reading the file that it's a link or a file. Only if you query the link count can a program tell, and rsync cares not about the hard link count when reading.\nYou should be good to go for any restore of files like documents or pictures.\n", "Q: TextEdit shows dialogs about not having permission to open any files About once per day, TextEdit starts showing dialogs like this when I try to open any file:\n\nThe document “test.txt” could not be opened.

All the events and albums are normal in thumbnail view but when I open a picture I get this exclamation point error icon that fills the screen. \nLooks fine in thumbnail mode, \nexclamation point alert but I get this error icon when I try to open the picture. \nproblem \nHaven't ever seen it before. I recently upgraded to iPhoto '11 (9.3.2) and Mountain Lion and switched out my Macbook hard drive. I imported my iPhoto Library from my old drive using Apple's Migration Assistant. \nI realize that I have a lot of variables.  I have tried many fixes: starting up iPhoto holding down Option and Command, trying all of the repair options, checked the permissions on the photos, rebuilt the Library and none of them have worked. \nWhat else should I do and or try? \n\nA: The ! turns up when iPhoto loses the connection between the thumbnail in the iPhoto Window and the file it represents. \nSurefire fix: Restore from backup. Otherwise...\nOption 1\nBack Up and try rebuild the library: hold down the command and option (or alt) keys while launching iPhoto. Use the resulting dialogue to rebuild. Choose to Repair Database. If that doesn't help, then try again, this time using Rebuild Database.\n \nIf that fails:\n \nOption 2\nDownload iPhoto Library Manager and use its rebuild function. (In Library Manager it's the FIle -> Rebuild command) \nThis will create an entirely new library. It will then copy (or try to) your photos and all the associated metadata and versions to this new Library, and arrange it as close as it can to what you had in the damaged Library. It does this based on information it finds in the iPhoto sharing mechanism - but that means that things not shared won't be there, so no slideshows, books or calendars, for instance - but it should get all your events, albums and keywords, faces and places back.\nBecause this process creates an entirely new library and leaves your old one untouched, it is non-destructive, and if you're not happy with the results you can simply return to your old one.   \n\nA: Turns out the iPhoto Library was corrupted when I upgraded to the new iPhoto.  \nAfter trying some of terrydev's suggestions iPhoto suddenly said it needed to upgrade the database to work with the new version. After a lot of spinner time it just nuked the Library.  The pictures were all still there, but any meta data attached (faces, albums) was gone.  \nI went back to the old Library (essentially my backup) and copied it over. Only lost about a week of data.  \n\nA: Go to iCloud, then to Photos, click on it and you will see Optimise iPhone storage or download and keep originals; tick the download and keep originals option and backup your phone again. It will go back to clear photos without the i symbol.\n\nA: I had this same problem.\nI fixed it by turning off 'icloud photo library' in settings > photos and cameras, and then selecting 'remove from iphone'.\nAfter a while, all the photos were removed from my phone (they're still in icloud).\nThen i turned 'icloud photo library' back on (i had ‘optimize iphone storage’ on).\nI woke up the next day and found all my photos back on my phone, with no exclamation mark, and i was able to load the picture when i needed to open/edit/post/send it.\n", "Q: Are there any disadvantages to pre-ordering the latest iPhone through Apple? I hope to upgrade replace my existing iPhone with the new iPhone by pre-ordering through Apple, but I'm uncertain what effect this will have on my existing data plan. \nAre there any advantages to purchasing the phone through my carrier instead? Will I be given different service options, or will different features be available?\n\nA: If you're specifically asking if you can maintain your current data plan when ordering via Apple, you can do that.  Alternatively, you'll also be able to change your data plan to other plans that are currently offered by your carrier.\nPart of the ordering process (when ordering through anyone: Apple, a carrier, Best Buy, etc.) is selecting your plan, and that part of the process contacts your carrier's systems.  On the first day people can preorder, this results in the carriers' systems being crushed due to all the demand.\nOnce your carrier's system has been contacted, the store you're buying from then knows if you're eligible for subsidized contract pricing or if you'll have to pay unsubsidized pricing.  The store also knows your current plan, and so is able to offer that as an option if you have a grandfathered plan that isn't available to new subscribers.\nErgo, the process for buying an iPhone will be pretty similar no matter where you buy it from.  Pick a store based on whatever criteria you wish: availability of the specific model you want, convenience of store location, store loyalty plan, etc.\n", "Q: Software update hinders rebooting OSX I'm trying to reboot Mountain Lion but it will not allow me.

I'm considering switching to Verizon for my family's new iPhones (partly due to cost, and partly due to free hotspot capabilities).  \nThe current Verizon CDMA iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S can not access data while on a voice call. Has this been improved over CDMA or LTE for VZW with the iPhone 5 hardware?\n\nA: There's some more explanation of why this is at http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/13/iphone-5-calls-data/ (thanks to MacRumors).  This was a hardware decision.  Adding support would require adding a third antenna.  The relevant quote\n\nSo why does Verizon’s Samsung Galaxy S III, a 4G LTE phone, juggle calls and data? Samsung added an extra antenna so that it pulls data from the 4G LTE network at the same time that it’s using another antenna to do voice, said Anand Shimpi, editor in chief of AnandTech.\nThen why didn’t Apple add another antenna? It actually already has two antennas in an effort to improve reception, and it would have had to add a third antenna just for Verizon and Sprint phones to give them simultaneous data and calls, Mr. Shimpi explained. Leaving that third antenna out allows Apple to simplify its manufacturing process of the iPhone for multiple carriers. Plus, in the next two years the 4G LTE network is supposed to evolve to support voice calls, which would render another antenna unnecessary later.\n\n\nA: Short answer, no.  Longer answer, you can access Wifi data while on a call, but not cellular data:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you're in an area with Wifi coverage, you'll be able to talk on the phone while using data.\n\n*If you're in an area with only LTE/3G/CDMA coverage, you will not be able to talk on the phone while using data.\n\n\nA statement from Verizon is over on The Verge:\n\nThe iPhone 5 was designed to allow customers to place a voice call on the Verizon Wireless network, while letting customers access the Internet over the WiFi.\n\nAnd Anand provides techy details:\n\nSo onto the iPhone – we know definitively that the iPhone 5 definitely doesn't support either SVDO or SVLTE. It's as simple as looking at the FCC documents and the appropriate sections in the allowed and tested simultaneous transmitters section for SAR (Specific Absorption Rate) testing. There, it's spelled out that only one air interface can be active at a time, and that only one antenna can be selected for transmit at a time. There's also an explicitly called out mention to VoLTE not being supported at present. I didn't replicate the entire table of simultaneous transmission combinations which need to be tested (it is a huge table) there are no entries with CDMA Voice being active at the same time as any data mode save WiFi. This has been confirmed as well by later statements by the carriers and Apple. \n\n", "Q: What could be causing the user interface to freeze? Recently, the user interface of my Mac Mini started to freeze. I can move the mouse, but mouse clicks don't have any effect: I cannot select a different window, right-click on  the desktop doesn't open any contextual menu, and the menus on the top bar are not opened.\nAll I can do is clicking the shut-down button, but I have to press it twice: The first time I press it (and keep it pressed), I hear a \"click!\" noise I thought produced from the external hard disk; the second time I press it, the computer shuts down.\nWhat could be causing this issue? How can I find the cause?\nThe first two times it happened, I thought it was Spotlight causing it, but the last time it happened, Spotlight was not indexing the hard disk's content.\n\nA: Could be anything, unfortunately.

Has anyone else had the issue of it taking forever to calculate the size of a folder? I have a folder of about 500 GB on an external USB drive, and it seems to never finish \"Calculating Size\" when I click on \"Get Info,\" so I have no idea how to find out the exact size. Does anyone know of a workaround or how to prevent this? \n\nA: The amount of time it takes is proportional to the number of files in the folder.  If there are a lot of files, it will take a long time to calculate.\nYou can also try doing it from the Terminal like so:\ndu -sh /path/to/folder\n\n\nA: Sometimes it never stops.  The process gets stuck sometimes. I use Daisy Disk from the Mac App store to calculate sizes and see where my hard drive space is used. \n\nA: This might not directly answer your question, but OmniDiskSweeper is quite a good tool for finding the big files on your hard disk.And the best thing is it is free.\nThis is description from their wesbite.\n\nOmniDiskSweeper is really great at what it does: showing you the files on your drive, in descending order by size, and letting you delete them easily! It scans your disks as quickly as possible and shows you the facts — if a file doesn't make the cut to stay, just click the big Delete button and be done with it. It's a fast, easy way to find those large files cluttering up your drive and clearing them out for new, better things. Make sure you want them gone, though.

As I need to use subversion 1.7, I installed svn from brew to be installed in /usr/local/bin/svn. \nHow can I disable the svn* files so that I can use svn from brew?\n\nA: \nNOTE: monfresh's answer below is better than mine. While my method will work, it is not recommended to rename or edit system utilities.\n\nWhen I needed to upgrade from SVN 1.6 to 1.7, I installed my built version (not using Homebrew or Macports, etc.) in /usr/local/bin and renamed all the old svn executables in /usr/bin to (executablename)-1.6.7.\nSo now which svn gives /usr/local/bin/svn and the old /usr/bin/svn is /usr/bin/svn-1.6.17.\n\nA: There is a better and safer way to specify which version of an executable you want your computer to use without having to modify the executables that came pre-installed on your Mac. It's generally not recommended to alter your default system tools in any way.\nYou can take advantage of the PATH environment variable, which allows you to list several directories that you want your Mac to search in when looking for executables.\nIn order to use the latest version of svn, or any other tool you installed  in /usr/local/bin with Homebrew (or MacPorts, manually, etc), you want to tell your Mac to first look in /usr/local/bin before it looks in the default /usr/bin. You do that by defining the PATH in your .bash_profile, which is a file that gets loaded automatically every time you open a new Terminal window.\nYou can write the PATH to your .bash_profile by running this one-liner from the Terminal:\necho 'export PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:~/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bash_profile\n\nThis command takes everything between the single quotes (echo) and adds it (>>) to a file called .bash_profile in your user’s root (or home) directory (~/).\nTo have these changes take effect, you can either quit and relaunch Terminal, or run this command:\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n\nIf you want to do it all manually, open your .bash_profile with your favorite editor, then add this line to it:\nPATH=\"/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:~/bin:$PATH\"\n\nand save it.

If I prefer to hear US/Canadian Siri, will she understand my Australian accent?\nSorry Australian-voiced Siri, but you sound too much like the Telstra automated bill payment system voice. And I'm used to hearing the US/Canada Siri so I would rather select that language option in Settings. \nApple's Siri FAQ page says:\n\"the more you use Siri, the better it will understand you. It does this by learning about your accent and other characteristics of your voice. Siri uses voice recognition algorithms to categorize your voice into one of the dialects or accents it understands\"\nI am curious about whether it will correctly categorize my voice as being from an entirely different region to the one I have selected or just pick an accent from within the region I have chosen and maybe never achieve the best potential accuracy. It seemed that after I switched to \"English (United States)\" accuracy went down. I haven't been using it long enough to decide whether it is improving.\n\nA: In my experience with Siri, the initial language setting of Siri does help a lot to help it discover your accent more quickly, but it's not the only measure it uses. It will base its understanding of your accent off of its own starting point. It's pretty difficult to convince Siri you're not American if you choose American English as its language. It will eventually change, but it takes a lot of time, and might not even be completely accurate.\nI speak with a pretty standard British accent. Not northern, not southern, almost Welsh, actually. Siri's accuracy shot up with I switched to a British starting point.\nI suspect that over time, Siri will eventually categorise your accent correctly regardless of its own language setting. This is evidenced by the fact that after a few tries, some of contacts' names (ones that a computer would have a hard time pronouncing correctly) are recognised now whereas they weren't originally.\nThe key is that Siri will attempt to categorise your voice into an accent. It will not necessarily learn your own specific accent, but it will broadly put your accent into a box, with a few exceptions for how you pronounce proper nouns like places, sports teams, people, and even apps.\n\nA: Siri was developed to \"learn\" your voice tendencies, including accents.  Over time, it will warm to your ebb and flow of your voice.  \nHowever, if you change the language setting, your location choices, etc...l will be all wonky.  WHile it may be nice to hear a voice from \"home\" (that sexy Aussie voice is awesome) it will mess with Siri results.  \n", "Q: Unwanted saving of proxy credentials I'm working in an environment where several users access shared iMacs (OS X 10.7.4) using generic accounts that are shared between multiple users. However when they want to access the internet they must authenticate with the proxy server using their own unique credentials.\nWith that in mind, the proxy credentials should be cleared on logout, so that when another user accesses the same account, they still have to input their own proxy credentials when accessing the internet. Firefox does this just fine. However Safari saves the credentials no matter what and they persist through logout, which is a security and privacy concern.\nI've tried turning off authentication for the proxy server. This will prompt for credentials again but will save them after they're entered. Keychains have similar behaviour when they expire or are deleted. AutoFill for passwords in Safari is turned off and there are no saved passwords or other credentials.\nHow do I stop the proxy credentials from being saved?\nUpdate: The problem seems to be coming from a system process called AuthBrokerAgent which is responsible for proxy authentication. When proxy credentials are entered for the first time, it stores them in the user's login keychain and automatically adds itself as an allowed application for accessing those credentials. A workaround can be created by removing it from a list of allowed applications, forcing the program to ask for the keychain password when accessing those credentials, then changing the keychain password so it's different from the user account password, but this is extremely cumbersome as it must be configured on every account individually. A better solution must exist.\nDeleting the AuthBrokerAgent preference list broke proxy authentication in Safari completely.\n\nA: I'm not sure how to prevent the creation of the credentials in the first place, but you can remove items from the Keychain using the security command, which is easily scriptable.\nThe command you want is security delete-internet-password -s server, where server is the hostname or address of the proxy server without the protocol (i.e. 192.168.0.1, not https://192.168.0.1). Alternatively you can use -l label to match the name of the keychain item, or various other search parameters, which you can find detailed on the man page.\nYou can have this command run at logout for each user by saving it as an executable script in a location readable by all users (make sure the file is executable for all users as well). Then run sudo defaults write com.apple.loginwindow LogoutHook /path/to/script.\n", "Q: Strange QuickLook Error I recently installed an SSD (m4 crucial latest firmware) with TRIM enabled on my late 2011 MBP 13\".

All of the approaches that I have seen for changing the background color in Terminal use applescript; is there an escape sequence? All of the hints that I've seen, like this one, use AppleScript. I want to put it in my .base_profile and in the 'ssh' command so that when I hop from system to system the color changes properly. (I sometimes have to hop multiple systems in due to connectivity issues)\n\nA: I have this in my bash_profile:\n# Change the terminal theme when SSH to remote\nfunction tabc() {\n    NAME=$1; if [ -z \"$NAME\" ]; then NAME=\"Default\"; fi\n    osascript -e \"tell application \\\"Terminal\\\" to set current settings of front window to settings set \\\"$NAME\\\"\"\n}\n\n# Change the terminal color when remote\nfunction ssh {\n  tabc \"Hiltmon-Remote\"\n  /usr/bin/ssh \"$@\"\n  tabc \"Hiltmon\"\n}\n\nIt uses Applescript (which you don't want) to change the terminal profile.  Replace the Hiltmon and Hiltmon-Remote with your own color scheme names. When you use the ssh command, the macro changes the shell theme, then runs ssh. When you exit the remote session, it changes it back. Very cool!\nI tried using the shell color escape sequences like \\[\\e[36m\\] and \\[\\e[0m\\] but the remote session can and does reset them. This works great for me.\n\nA: Use something like\ntput setab <n>\nSee background coloring for values to use for n. You may want to follow this by the clear command to repaint the whole window.

Other files and folders are just hard links. If a file has been modified after the last snapshot, the whole file is copied instead of storing a delta. See the Wikipedia article for more information.\n\nA: I only can say that Time Machine is not working correctly. \nIt is just a diskspace hog. \nTimeMachine does not back up every file (90% of the time when I need some files few days ago, I can't find that file in time machine.)\nAnd how TimeMachine decides to backup a file or not to backup a file is unknown mystery.\n", "Q: Will the new iPad (bought in Korea) work in the USA?

I am considering buying a Macbook Pro Retina as a developer machine (and dual boot it into Windows 8).\nThe thing is I love big monitors, and lots of them.\nHow many and how big external monitors will a Macbook Pro Retina support?\nIn particular, can it display with native resolution on a 2560x1600 and a 2560x1440? And use its internal display too? Will it require particular adapters, e.g. DisplayPort?\nWill I be able to use those monitors when booting into Windows 8?\n\nA: Here's one example of someone running two 27\" displays at 2560x1440 via Thunderbolt/DisplayPort plus an HDMI display at 1920x1200:\nhttp://blog.macsales.com/14241-macbook-pro-15-with-retina-display-can-run-3-external-displays\nThe Thunderbolt ports officially support up to 2560x1600 so that resolution shouldn't be any problem either:\n\nSimultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display and up to 2560 by 1600 pixels on up to two external displays, at millions of colors\n  http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs/\n\nTo get up to that resolution, you're limited to either Thunderbolt/MiniDisplayPort or Dual-Link DVI via an adapter - single link DVI and VGA adapters won't go that high.\nFor the HDMI port, I haven't seen any specific maximum resolution. This person got up to 2048x1280: http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-3121_7-57460642-220/how-to-power-four-simultaneous-screens-with-the-retina-macbook-pro/\nGenerally, external monitors work fine in Windows. I see no reason why it would be any different on the Retina model or on Windows 8 specifically.\n\nA: From the tech specs page:\n\nDual display and video mirroring: Simultaneously supports full native\n  resolution on the built-in display and up to 2560 by 1600 pixels on up\n  to two external displays, at millions of colors\n\nSo the answer is yes, it will support those resolutions to up to two external displays. There will be no problems using these resolutions on Windows either.\n", "Q: PDF printing bug in OS X On a PDF created with Office for Windows, special characters are not displaying and not printing correctly in OS X. The rendering is correct on Chrome.\nThe issue is the same as this one: Some PDFs created by MS Word 2007's Save-as-PDF feature (on Windows) don't display correctly on Mac OS / iOS\nThe file (created on Windows with PDF Distiller): https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B8n7S6EXzIaJVXhOaFZncGZSdHc\nThe file (extracted from a document using print-to-PDF): https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B8n7S6EXzIaJMkpxWHdCeEl2a0U\nHow can I resolve this?\n\nA: This issue now appears to be resolved; previewing documents on ML 10.8.2 now show the PDF's rendered correctly.\nI'm not overly sure when this was resolved (it may well be something that was fixed in 10.8.0), but it looks like Apple has implemented a work around for the bad font embedding from Word generated PDF's\n\nThe updated PDf you posted is as shown, and works fine under ML.

All my music is held on a remote synology NAS and appears as a shared device.\nI'd like the music Column Browser and Album columns visible by default at startup, but I have to manually select them every time.\nI copied one track to the local itunes library, and that seems to preserve the view settings - bue even when that is set to show Column Browser the shared device still defaults to a plain list.\n(Note: It seems the problem only exists on the NAS music. Question has been tweaked to reflect this)\n\nA: If you upgrade to iTunes version 10.7 your problem may be solved... \nIn 10.7 you can right- or control click at the top of the column browser (first column) which will show all the options that can be visible by default -- genres, albums, composers, groupings-- in the first column. You can check those that you want. Upon restart those checked options will be visible by default.\n", "Q: Is the Lightning connector 8-pins or 8+1 ground pins? Apple said the new Lightning connector is 8 signals design but is there an additional ground aside from the 8 pins? Because this would mean it could support USB 3.0 in the future (USB 3.0 uses is 9 pins). (It could not support Powered USB 3.0 that is 11 pins).\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Serial_Bus\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_3.0\n\nA: If you count the shield on USB 3.0, the \"9 pin\" version actually requires 10 pins, as the shield, while typically grounded, is not actually used as the signal-ground (and it cannot be used as such).\nAs such, if the lightning connector indeed has only 8 pins, there is no way it can support USB 3.0 while properly complying with the USB spec.\nI would guess that if it supports USB 3.0, it would be with non-standard USB extension, much as many of apple's other USB addons (like their high-current charging facilities).\nI'd like to further note that, from an electrical engineering standpoint, using the casing (which is called the shield) for anything but, well, shielding is considered very bad practice.  \nThe entire point of shielding is to basically absorb any interference before it can each the inner conductors. If you are relying on the shield for carrying a meaningful signal (and ground is indeed a meaningful signal), it is no longer effective as a shield.\n\nIf it does support USB 3.0, I would hope they open the connector mechanical design up for wider adoption, as the current USB 3.0 micro connector is horribly designed mechanically.\n\nA: As Apple has already USB 3.0 on its newer computer models, it is strange that the lightning connecter doesn't already support USB 3.0. The new design features a 9-pin, 8-signal arrangement that may be compatible with future USB 3.0. -- So it's (8 + 1) pins.\nHopefully \"Lightning\" will support USB 3.0 or Thunderbolt speeds. That would be a great reason for Apple not to have used Micro-USB (which in its industry standard design is limited to USB 2.0 speeds since it lacks the extra pins needed for USB 3.0).\n", "Q: What's the meaning/use of ?mt=8 and ?mt=12 in iTunes Preview and Mac App Store Preview URLs?

You can find known values in the answer to similar question.\nBecause there’s usually an ID in URL, it may seem odd, but according to another answer to that same question, the mt query parameter helps the operating system to launch the right store in the right app.  For example on iOS, you may see sometimes that links open the iTunes app first and then the iBookstore in the iBooks app.  Other times, the iBookstore is opened right away.  That is why mt should be part of iTunes and why you should probably use iTunes Link Maker.\n", "Q: Force images to synchronize from an iPhone to a Mac My sister in law would like to synchronize photos from her iPhone to her Mac.\nWhen she connects the iPhone to her Mac, iTunes starts up but photos don't synchronize. \nI tried taking a couple of photos and import them using iPhoto.

Although I can see a bunch of very recent photos on the iPhone, the most recent photos in the iPhoto collection are from last year.\nI'd like to manually copy all the photos from the iPhone into her Mac and then re-synchronize the images. Can this be done?\n\nA: You can manually import photos from iPhone into iPhoto. Connect your iPhone, open iPhoto, select iPhone in the sidebar, and select all of the photos you want to import, then click Import.\nIf she has upgraded to iOS 6 and has an iCloud account, she can enable Photo Stream on both devices.

I understand that for certain iPhone models it is necessary to get a new SIM if I want to exchange them. \nIf I have a 4S and want to exchange it with a user who has just purchased a 5, is this possible to do by simply following the same straightforward SIM-transfer procedures used to exchange (for example) a 4 with a 4S.\n\nA: short answer: No\nThe iPhone 5 has the Nano-SIM\nThe iPhone 4 and 4s have the Micro-SIM\n\niPhone 5 is not compatible with existing micro-SIM cards.\n\nfound on the apple site\nYou have to go to your mobile provider and get a replacement Nano-SIM if you're using the micro-SIM.\nThe other way around you can use an adapter or get a replacement SIM as well.\nIt could be possible if you haven't used the Nano-SIM you can 'cut out' the Nano as a Mirco-SIM if your provider provides it like that:\n\nThere are nano-SIM cutters on the market to cut out a nano-SIM from a normal or micro SIM but I'm not sure these work seeing some bad reviews on the internet...\naccording to Joseph's answer the nano-SIM is also thiner making it impossible to just cut a normal or mircro SIM.\nedit: Now I've seen reports that using sandpaper to make the SIM thinner will work. question is are you willing to go trough all the trouble cutting and sandpapering your SIM while you could get/buy a new one at he store that will work 100% ?\n\nA: According to this article, the problem isn't just the size.\n\nIt turns out, as well as a smaller size, the Nano SIM is reportedly\n  15% thinner than the Micro SIM cards. So even if users cut the Micro\n  SIM to Nano SIm size with a knife or nano SIM cutter tool, the Sim\n  card would still be too thick to put in the iPhone 5.\n\n\nA: Nope, you'll have to change the SIM card to put it in an iPhone 5.\nThe iPhone 5 uses a new SIM card format called nano-SIM, and it is not possible to convert a micro-SIM (SIM for the iPhone 4) to a nano-SIM.\nHowever, the reverse operation is possible. Adaptors exist (or will exist) to convert nano-SIM to the micro or normal SIM formats.\nSource: http://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/everything-you-want-to-know-about-nano-sim-being-used-in-iphone-5-266771\n\nA: It is definitely possible to cut the microSIM to nanoSIM.

I put the card into a newly unlocked iPhone 5, and it worked fine.\n\nA: I took a T-Mobile sim card from a blackberry then used nail clippers to put it into my unlocked iPhone 4 then when I bought the iPhone 5 I used nail clippers and a nail file to make it even smaller and match it to the shape of the iPhone 5. The trick was that I had to match the design on the gold part of the sim and make sure it went into the sim holder with the design facing the same way as the iPhone 5 sim. So I had to turn my sim upside down first . it took me a minute to figure that out. Make sure that the pattern on the gold part of the sim card faces you the same way as the original sim so everything lines up when you put it into the phone. Does that make sence? Hard to explain but I promoise u this worked.\n\nA: Well I had an iphone 4 and used the SAME exact sim card for my 5. All I did was take a replica of the iphone 5 sim and cut it down to size.

I'd like my Mac laptops to shut down completely when I close the lid. This is partly for convenience and partly for security reasons.\nI couldn't find a way to do this in the System Preferences (OS 10.8.1). Is there a way to control it by changing hidden preferences in the terminal, or some other method?\n\nA: Though it's less and less true thanks to auto save, a shutdown in general may require user action (e.g., from an application that doesn't use the auto save model, or from an application that is frozen or becomes frozen when the OS tries to quit it). Therefore, any solution would not always work, because if the shutdown requires user interaction to complete, it will not finish (unless you want to do a forced-shutdown, which is a bad idea). \nAlso I should point out that this will do the exact opposite of saving energy, since booting the computer takes up a bit of CPU.  The boot time will also make this the exact opposite of convenient.  And due to what I said above, it won't be secure. \nIf you care about security, just enable a password when the computer is put to sleep. You can set the computer to shut down automatically at a set time every day in the energy saver preferences, and logout automatically after a given time of inactivity in the security presences (but the screensaver/sleep password is more secure, since logging out won't always work without user interaction either). \n", "Q: Deleting messages only once on IPad IPhone, and mail account I have an email account and get emails in my Comcast email list, and on the list on my IPhone and IPad. So, if I want to delete a message, I need to delete it on all three.  Is there a way to sync the deletion of a message so if I delete it on one device it is deleted on the others?\n\nA: It sounds like you are using a POP3 type email account. Unfortunately, using native (built in) apps, I don't know of any way to sync across your devices. Deleting emails multiple times is indeed something that can be a major pain.\nOne usability thing you probably use all the time, but just in case you haven't seen it is the fact that you can tap the edit button on an iOS device (upper right) and tap the emails listed to quickly delete emails. This is faster then swiping each email.\nAlso, if it is possible (if the Comcast email is just personal and you have a choice where to host your email), you could switch to a Gmail type IMAP service. This automatically stores all your email in the cloud and will sync across all your devices.\n", "Q: What features are lost on the Lightning to 30 pin dock adapter? The materials from Apple say that the following features are not supported on the Lightning to 30 pin dock adapter and cable: Video and iPod out.\nWhat exactly are these features?\n \nLightning to 30 pin adapter and Lightning to 30 pin cable\n\nA: The iPod out functionality is actually a very specific feature that was added only very recently. Only a few cars actually support it, so the vast vast majority of appliances should continue to work fine.\n\nHere's the thing, though: \"iPod Out\" doesn't actually mean \"audio output from an iPod.\" It's the branding for a very specific feature for cars and remote-screen tools that was included in iOS 4, which delivered a customized iOS graphic display via the in-dash screens when the device was docked\n\nhttp://www.tuaw.com/2012/09/13/lightning-30-pin-adapter-works-with-analog-audio-ipod-out-doe/\nFor the Video functionality, this will be coming soon - the connector is capable of it, but it most likely requires additional circuitry in the adapter to implement it.\n\nAs with the 30-pin connector, the Lightning connector supports video output; Apple told Macworld that Lightning-to-HDMI and Lightning-to-VGA cables will be available “in the coming months.”\n\nhttp://www.macworld.com/article/1168555/what_apples_new_lightning_connector_means_for_you.html\n\nA: There are 30 pin to VGA and 30 pin to HDMI adapters that provide video out similar to AirPlay but over the cables.\nThese adaptors are not to plug another of these video devices into the new iPhone.

I was trying to use DigitalColor Meter to find the color of a pixel on my retina MacBook Pro, but I found that it was impossible to get the color that I wanted because the smallest that I could move the mouse by was two pixels (in either direction).  If you zoom in using the control-scroll trick and disable pixel antialiasing (in the Accessibility preferences), you'll also see that this is the case.\nIs it possible to move the mouse by just one pixel on a retina display?  It seems like the ability to do so would make the mouse movement smoother.  I guess to solve my color problem, I could just take a screenshot and zoom in on that, but it's a lot of extra work.\n\nA: No - the mouse is aligned on the \"fake\" size of the screen and not the true screen pixel grid in most cases.\nThe concept of a physical pixel and a display pixel is a distinct one on retina displays since the hardware reports movements on a resolution-independant scale.\nFurthermore, there appear to be some subtle bugs in the code side of things so even if the developer wanted to determine the next pixel's color it appears the routine that reports mouse position doesn't count physical pixels on this model screen.\nThere is a nice, very technical article by one of the programmers for Xscope - Retina for Masochists/ that explains a bit how the resolution that the software is told to draw gets translated into the actual on screen pixels which is fixed.\nAs an aside - the Xscope program is free to try and puts the digital color meter to shame on many aspects of determining color and much, much more.\n", "Q: Generating and opening file with Automator I am new to Automator. What I am trying to do as first experiment is automating the process of decompiling a Java class file and immediately after open the decompiled file with its default editor.\nFollowing these instructions I managed to decompile a Java class file using this shell script:     \n~/bin/jad -lnc -o -d `dirname $1` $1\n\nThis will decompile the file class currently selected in the finder. The tool I use (jad) will create in the same directory a file with the same name but a different extension. For example, if the original file was \"MyClass.class\", then the generated file will be \"MyClass.jad\".\nMy question is, how can instruct the Automator to open the generated jad file with its default editor after this being generated in the first action ?\nI know I can use the open command in a console to open a file with its default editor, but I do not know how to pass it the right name from Automator.\n\nA: Add open \"${1%.*}\".jad on a new line at the end of the script. If you want to open it in a specific application (not the default), change it to open -a \"Some Application\" \"${1%.*}\".jad\nThe $1 is the first argument passed to a script, which in this case is the file path. the ${1%.*} strips the extension (i.e. /Users/you/MyClass.class becomes /Users/you/MyClass), and then .jad is appended, so you get the full path of the new file.\n", "Q: Mac Mail -- synchronize IMAP sent boxes I use Mac Mail on Lion with two IMAP accounts.\nThe main (local?) inbox works great; all received messages are synchronized.  The main sent box only shows messages that have been sent from this computer.  \n\nI can find the individual IMAP sent boxes, with all sent messages from anywhere, in the file tree under 'Show.'  Is there a way to synchronize the main sent box with all sent messages on both IMAP servers?  I'd like to do this so I can search through all sent messages in one action.\nThanks\n\nA: First, check in the Mail.app preferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*Accounts -> Your account\n\n*\"Mailbox behaviors\" tab\n\n*the \"Store sent messages on the server\" checkbox. If checked, the sent messages are stored in the server, if not, theyre stored locally.\n\n\nIf you storing sent messages on the server, probably: your IMAP-server account uses different mailbox for Sent emails as Mail.app uses by default. Therefore:\n\n\n*\n\n*you should find the correct mailbox by checking all available mailboxes in the IMAP-server account in the sidebar \"Show\" (usually some names with \"Sent\", or \"sent-mail\" or like).\n\n*click on the folder\n\n*In the menu: \"Mailbox\" -> \"Use This Mailbox\" and select \"Sent\"\n\n*Now, your Mail.app will use this mailbox for the Sent items.\n\n\nIf the above not helps (and probably won't because, as you write, you \"can't browse the server mailboxes) you should ASK your IMAP-server admin what IMAP-server \"PATH prefix\" is used by server. Probably the admin setup some unusual configuration, you probably will need enter something like \"/\" or \"INBOX\"...\nWarning: Don't experiment with different IMAP PATH settings because you can mess-up you current local mail cache. If you still want experiment (what i strongly don't recommending) you at least should first select \"Don't keep copies of any messages\", what will delete you local mail cache). When you will have the correct setting you should enable again the local chache and the Mail.app, click Synchornize and the Mail will reload all messages again from server. (hopefully). You've been warned - don't blame me if you loose all your mails. ;)\n", "Q: Will the iPad now come with EarPods? Since Apple recently announced the new EarPods to go along with the iPhone 5, I've wanted a pair. \nThe only thing is I'm planning on buying an iPad in a few months, and if the iPad comes with EarPods I'm fine with a wait - it's not urgent.\nSo, will the iPad come with EarPods?\n\nA: The New iPad currently being sold on the Apple Store doesn't come with headphones of any kind, according to their site:\n\nSo it seems unlikely that they'll start shipping them with EarPods, especially since the EarPods are already on sale.\nThat said, there's no way to answer this question aside from pure conjecture.

I am fairly confident I could fix it myself if I could get it to boot from a USB drive or external disk but holding Option ⌥ during boot does not bring up the boot selector.\nIs there another way to get it to boot from a different drive without using Option ⌥?\nFor example, if I attach an external drive with OS X installed will it automatically boot from it?\nedit: I found this page which sounds exactly like what the problem is. So I am looking for another way to replicate what they are accomplishing, by disconnecting the cable, without having to remove the glass.\n\nA: If you could boot OS X, you could use the Startup Disk preference pane to select an alternate boot disk.\nThere are a few other boot-time options you can try: hold C to boot from an optical disk or hold T to boot into Target Disk mode so you can read the hard drive from another computer (over FireWire or Thunderbolt).\n\nA: It seems that there is no way to do this. If holding ALT doesn't work you're out of luck.\nSomething that may help is disconnecting the main boot drive and connecting another drive with OS X (or a USB stick with the Recovery Assistant on it), and it should boot that by default, but it will not if the default drive is still connected.\n", "Q: What do I do if appleid can't send me email?

How would you dual-boot Ubuntu 12.04 on a MacBook Pro with the following specs: 13\", 750GB hard drive, Intel Core-i7 processor, with 8GB RAM.\n\nA: rEFIt is the best way to allow dual-booting on a Mac. I use it to boot Ubuntu from a partition on my external drive, and it works perfectly. Be sure to back up your hard drive before proceeding.\n\nInstall rEFIt and make sure it is working (you should get a boot\n  chooser on startup) Use Bootcamp or Disk Utility to create a partition\n  at the end of the disc. Don’t worry about what format, just make it\n  the size you want for Ubuntu and your swap partition. If you you are\n  using OS X Lion which comes with Bootcamp 4.0 you will need to use the\n  Disk Utility. Boot Camp 4.0 will only allow you to resize if you\n  provide a Windows 7 installation disk. Boot the Ubuntu desktop CD, and\n  select \"Try Ubuntu. Start the partition editor (gparted) under System\n  -> Adminstration. Use gparted to delete the partition you just made in OS X. It should be the last partition on the disc and follows after\n  the HFS+ partition (OS X). Deleting it will leave an area called\n  unallocated. This is free space, and exactly what you want. Use\n  gparted to manually partition the space on your drive for Ubuntu.\n  First create a SWAP area of about 1GB. Then the rest of the\n  unallocated area format as EXT4. Apply changes and take note the label\n  of the EXT4 partition such as /dev/sda3.\nStart the Ubuntu Installer from the desktop icon. When prompted,\n  choose to manually partition. Select the EXT4 partition and click\n  change. Select to use the space as EXT4 and root (/) as the mount\n  point. You will also want to check the box to format the partition. \n  Reboot when done with the install, and in the rEFIt menu, choose the\n  partition tool. It will attempt to sync the partition tables on your\n  disk. Then SHUTDOWN the computer (not reboot), and start it again. You\n  should be able to boot to Ubuntu now. If it seems to freeze on the tux\n  logo, completely shutdown again and try one more time.\n\nThis is a summary of a process described by the detailed how-to process here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MactelSupportTeam/AppleIntelInstallation#Detailed_How-To\n", "Q: How do I find out what wireless card my Mac has?

I have a first generation iPad with many documents in iBooks. This iPad is still synchronized with a laptop that is no longer in my possession. This means I can't sync to my new laptop over Wi-Fi. How do I remove the Wi-Fi sync connection to my old laptop?\n\nA: If you're only worried about losing items purchased through iTunes on the Apple ID you're currently using, like iBooks, then this will work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you're logged into iTunes with your Apple ID. (The one you made all of your purchases with.)\n\n*Sync the iPad to your new computer. Yes, the existing content will be deleted.\n\n*From within iTunes, navigate to the iTunes Store. In a column to the right, you will see a link (under the heading, \"Quick Links\" that says, \"Purchased.\" Click on that link.\n\n*The new store page that will be displayed is broken down into sections, which you'll see across the top (Music, Movies, TV Shows, Apps, Books). You should be able to re-download any content you previously purchased, including books. I just tested this by deleting a book I previously purchased, and I was able to re-download it this way.\n\n\nA: Even without syncing you can get the music, apps, and books which you bought via iTunes to the computer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Visit the iTunes Store with the Apple ID you used for buying the books.\n\n*In the menu on the right-hand side, you can find an entry Purchased.

This will bring you to a page where you can find the music, apps, and books you bought via iTunes. \n\n*Click the cloud symbol to re-download items to the computer.\n\n\nA: Go to Settings > General > Reset, and then Reset All Settings\nThis seems a very poor method of resolution, and a code bug, IMO.\n", "Q: MacPorts Software clean-up: /opt/local/var/macports/software The MacPorts directory /opt/local/var/macports/software is really full of \"stuff\":\nCan all the .tbz2 files be deleted?\nI am running out of space on the SSD.\n\nA: Yes all the files in that folder located with in ${prefix}/var/macports/software/ can be deleted. Those are the installer packages for programs that you installed using MacPorts. MacPorts will re-download those as necessary when running the install or presumably the upgrade command too for a given program ,etc.\nThe descripton of the purpose of the directory ... is noted in MacPorts Guide under Binary Archives.\n\n3.4.1. Binary Archives\nBinary archives can only be used on a target system running MacPorts. Binary archives allow MacPorts utilities to begin installation after the destroot phase and install and activate a port on the target system. Binary archives are created whenever a port is installed, and can also be downloaded from a server.\n...\nBinary archive files are placed in ${prefix}/var/macports/software/. The archive file type is set in the macports.conf file. The default format is .tbz2; other options are: tar, tbz, tbz2, tgz, tlz, txz, xar, zip, cpgz, cpio.\n\n\nA: Before going about deleting files manually in the “software” directory, I would suggest running the command sudo port uninstall inactive. The command will remove all the inactive archives from “software”. If you delete files manually from “software” after that, you’ll be deleting active archives. I’m not sure there’s much harm in doing that, but I’m not sure it’s harmless either.\nThe MacPorts “install” command goes through several phases, the final two being the “install” phase and the “activate” phase:\n\ninstall: Archive a port's destrooted files into ${prefix}/var/macports/software. […]\nactivate: Extract the port's files from the archive in ${prefix}/var/macports/software to their final installed locations, usually inside ${prefix}.\n\nThe “software” directory can contain archives that are not active, in particular old versions of ports that you have upgraded, because the “upgrade” command does not remove old versions by default:\n\nupgrade does not uninstall the old version of a port. Instead, it deactivates it […] This allows you to go back to the older version if there happens to be a problem with the updated one. […] If you do not want to keep the old versions around while upgrading, you can pass -u when upgrading: […] However, we instead recommend keeping the older versions around for a while and running sudo port uninstall inactive once in a while.\n\nThe MacPorts FAQ only suggests using the “uninstall” command to get rid of unwanted files in “software”:\n\nWhat are the folders in ${prefix}/var/macports/ for and why do they take up so much space?\n  […]\n  software: Contains the compressed archives of installed software. If a port is activated its files are extracted to the ${prefix} folders from the compressed files here. port uninstall <port> <version>+<variant> would remove it from here, but then this port can not be used anymore. \n\nThere doesn’t seem to be a switch for the “uninstall” command to uninstall an archive from “software” without also deactivating it first if it’s the active archive. So I assume it’s not a good idea either to manually remove active archives from “software”.\n\nA: As Rinzwind said, you can uninstall (ie delete) any inactive versions of ports left behind by upgrades:\nport uninstall inactive\n\nIf you install a port, all its dependencies are installed. If you uninstall a port, its dependencies are not uninstalled. You can uninstall them using the cutleaves utility:\nport install port_cutleaves\nport_cutleaves\n\nThis only removes one layer of obsolete dependencies at a time; to remove them all, i use a hacky pipeline:\nwhile ! yes u | port_cutleaves -b | grep 'There are no new leaves to process.'; do : ; done\n\nYou can remove all the build-related files (work files, distribution files, temporary archives and logs) for uninstalled ports:\nport clean --all uninstalled\n\nTo remove just the work files for installed ports:\nport clean installed\n\nThe cleaning seems to touch every single port in the tree. I don't know what's going on there.\n", "Q: Access an iPad's Photos via the Web or a Linux Computer? I have earlier used AirDroid but its quality is unexpected, more here so now looking alternative solution.\nI have iPad but I have no other Apple products. Can I somehow get the images from iPad to my Debian computer with the iCloud.com website? If not, how can I get them from iPad to my computers?\n\nA: iCloud.com doesn't have an interface to access your Photo Stream. However there are other ways to access the photos if you don't have access to iTunes for syncing.\nDropbox\nThe iOS Dropbox app has recently been updated with a feature that can automatically upload all the new photos from your Camera Roll to Dropbox when you open the app. I believe you can even get bonus Dropbox storage for using the feature.\nOnce the photos are in your Dropbox account, you can access them through the web interface on Dropbox.com or the Linux client.\nAirSharing\nThe AirSharing app ($9.99 on the App Store) is essentially a general purpose file transfer client. It supports FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, Google Docs, Dropbox and more. You can use it to transfer photos from your iPad's Camera Roll (or other albums) to your Debian machine via (S)FTP or a WebDAV folder running on your iPad. If you prefer to avoid a cloud solution like Dropbox, this is probably the way to go.\nThese are just a couple options, there are certainly others out there (the Google Drive app would probably work similarly to Dropbox, and there are other apps similar to AirSharing).\n\nA: iPhoto for iOS Journals\nCreate a journal on iPhoto for iOS to store your pictures online with iCloud where other computers can get at them. To store the journal on iCloud tap the share button. Then tap 'Publish to iCloud'.

I have to reboot in order for it to work. When I plug the adapter with a cable in the new macbook - nothing happens. When I unplug it, the screen goes to blue and then goes back.\nWhat could be the problem? I think I have this issue from the time I got the laptop. It is with Mountain Lion (it had this issue with all the versions of the os). The old mac is also with Lion.\nCould this connector be somewhat different and the new mac to require a new connector?\nI reset the NVRAM or whatever, it didn't help\n\nA: This is the solution:\nThe 15 inch Macbook uses 2 graphics cards. I use gfxCardStatus application to control which graphics card is used - OS X too easily allows apps to request the more powerful card, which drains the battery too quickly. Skype is an example of such an app.\nI just discovered that the integrated graphics card (the weaker one) cannot support a second monitor for some reason. Even though in my 13 inch Macbook it can. So only the \"discrete\" (or the more powerful) card can do this.\nIn essence, either stop gfxCardStatus app or go to \"Discrete Only\" mode in it.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro won't power on after SMC reset Some water was spilled on the table and came in contact with my wife's Mid 2009 MacBook Pro near the MagSafe adapter causing the MBP to shut itself off. Based on some recommendations from the internet, my wife put the MBP in a bag of rice over night to extract the water. Note: I would be careful so as to ensure rice doesn't end up in any ports or crevices.\nIn the morning, the MBP powered on, but it displayed \"Not Charging\" when I plugged in the power adapter. I tried two different power adapters to make sure that wasn't the problem. I also confirmed that both power adapters worked on my Early 2011 MacBook Pro.\nBased on various threads, it seemed reasonable to reset so the SMC, so I followed Apple's instructions to reset the SMC. Here are the instructions that I followed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down the computer.\n\n*Plug in the MagSafe power adapter to a power source, connecting it to the Mac if its not already connected.\n\n*On the built-in keyboard, press the (left side) Shift-Control-Option keys and the power button at the same time.\n\n*Release all the keys and the power button at the same time.\n\n*Press the power button to turn on the computer.  \n\n\nHowever on step 5, when I pressed the power button to turn on the MBP, it didn't do anything. No lights, no noise, nothing. At that point I noticed that the MagSafe connector wasn't properly seated—the back portion of the connector wasn't in place but portion closest to the front of the MBP may have been making electrical connection.\n\n\n*\n\n*Could reseting the SMC while the power adapter is partially connected have caused the MBP to be bricked?\n\n*Thoughts on root causes of the problem?\n\n*Thoughts on solutions?\n\n\nI have already scheduled an appointment with the Apple Store, so I'll about this when I have more information.\n\nA: Your problem is likely a hardware problem, and is probably a short. Unless you disassembled the computer before using the rice method, it probably didn't help and you just ended up with a bunch of rice in the trash can. Also (and this is general advice for everyone), the first thing you should do in a situation like this is IMMEDIATELY disconnect all power to the computer, including removing the battery. Failure to do this will keep power going to the machine and dramatically increase the likelihood of a short. \nHardware failures do not necessarily happen all at once, and may not show up for a day or more. It sounds like this is what has probably happened to you. At the risk of being the bearer of more bad news by adding insult to injury, this type of damage also is not covered by Apple Care. Sorry you have to deal with this; best of luck to you in getting your machine back in order!\n\nA: I have the same problem. I reset the smc because of intermittent charging and it didn't work properly. I'm certain the problem is now the smc and that's why it won't power on. Because the smc controls the power button. I also have managed to get it to charge but the battery lights don't turn on, also controlled by the smc. Because the reset failed for some reason it might be now corrupted and because it controls the power button I need a new way to reset the smc. I'll remove the battery overnight and maybe that will help somehow\n", "Q: Why hasn't my battery life improved even though I changed the battery? I have a mid-2009 white MacBook. About a week ago, I switched the aging and failing battery for an identical new battery I got off eBay (supposedly original part and new - looked legit both in description and packaging). \nAfter switching the battery and resetting the SMC, a fully-charged battery reports six hours of available battery life, the way it should. But the battery runs out after only three or so. Pretty much the same battery life I got out of my old battery.\nCould there be something I'm doing wrong software-wise here, or is it likely that I got a shitty used battery which was polished and made to appear new?\n\nA: The first step is to look at the detailed battery information from the System Information/System Profiler for each battery.\n  Charge Information:\n     Charge Remaining (mAh):     5587\n     Fully Charged:              Yes\n     Charging:                   No\n     Full Charge Capacity (mAh): 5611\n  Health Information:\n     Cycle Count:                289\n     Condition:                  Normal\n  Battery Installed:          Yes\n  Amperage (mA):              0\n  Voltage (mV):               12420\n\nPay attention to the Full Charge Capacity and cycles for each battery.\n\nThe second step (assuming my guess that you have a non-unibody Mac where the battery is user-replaceble - swappable without removing the bottom of the Mac) is to run a simple calibration charge cycle on the new battery (and followed by the old one perhaps to compare). Once your computer gets to know the new battery (it guesses based on average battery performance until it determines the chemistry particular to each battery that gets used over time).\n\nThe third step if you really want to measure everything on both batteries is to use the pmset -g pslog command to document each battery as it powers your Mac from full to the low power shut off point.\nHere is the relevant section from the man page linked above:\n If your system suddenly sleeps on battery power with 20-50% of capacity\n remaining, leave this command running in a Terminal window.

My library and her library are different, but there is a fair amount of song overlap between the two.\nI have used iTunes Match to replace about 5,000 of the songs in my library, with 256kb AAC .m4a files rather than the various qualities of .mp3 files I had previously.\nUnfortunately this has resulted in a large number of broken file links in her playlists, because the old file reference was .mp3 and the new file is .m4a.  iTunes will allow me to manually re-link each file one by one, but cannot automatically find any others.\nHow can I get her library, to changes its references from the .mp3 files it knows about, to the newer .m4a files, where applicable?\nNote that this does not apply to EVERY file in her library, only to those files that overlap between her library and mind, and that were matched by iTunes.\nMORE DETAIL FOR THOSE WHO CARE:\nI have a library consisting of about 15,000 songs, almost all of which are mp3s of various quality ranging from 96kb to 192kb.  I have wanted to de-duplicate this library for some time, as well as increase the quality of the tracks since storage is so much cheaper these days.  However the time & effort involved in doing so has been daunting.\nThen yesterday I discovered (well, finally signed up for) iTunes Match.  After a bit of searching for various \"power user\" techniques, I found that I was able to reliably de-duplicate my library in a huge and automated way, bringing it down to the current state of about 15,000 items.  Not all of these are \"music\" however, many are audiobooks, podcasts, etc.  iTunes Match was able to match up about 5,000 songs, and uploaded a few thousand others.\nNow to the problem.  My wife has a separate iTunes library file so that she can run iTunes at the same time I do.  We don't share all of the same music, but there is a fair amount of overlap.  My library is fine as I have re-downloaded all the 5,000 files with 256kb AAC versions from iTunes Match and deleted the old mp3 files.  But now my wife's library doesn't reference these same new files.\nI can go through her \"missing\" songs one by one and locate them, but there are thousands of them.  The iTunes \"find other missing files\" feature is useless here, and finds nothing (I think because of the change from mp3 to m4a but I can't be sure).\nSo the question ultimately is - how can I, in an automated or batch way - get her library to look at the new .m4a versions of the songs, rather than the mp3 versions which are now gone?  I don't especially care about the metadata on her library since she doesn't use it, but I want to make sure any changes will not affect my metadata, as I do use it.\nI considered editing the library xml file but realized that this won't help, as it's the database itself that would need alteration and the xml is just an output generated from the DB itself.\nEDIT:  Hopefully my new \"short version\" is clearer for those who didn't understand what I was asking before.\n\nA: I dissected the XML file a bit and it turned out to be a XML property list (sort of a XML-based JSON equlivant), so it becomes easier to handle. If the files affected have the same name not counting its extension, some Objective-C can be laid down to change it. Do you have Xcode installed or should I prepackage it for you?\n\nA: It is possible to use the .xml file I think. When I reinstall my MacBook I export the iTunes library. I import it as a playlist after a fresh install. This ensures that I keep my metadata (play count is very important to me). \nYou could thus edit the .xml file, clear your wife's database (make sure you keep a backup) and then import your edited .xml file. However, editing can take a lot of time, depending on what has been changed. Is it just the extension (mp3 to m4a), or have the file names and path names also been changed. \nMaybe you can come up with an if-for loop that replaces the path and filenames in the xml file of your wife with the ones in your own database (e.g. if line contains \"artist\" \"album name\" \"word from title\" find it and replace it with line with same qualifiers from your own database). \nI actually had a similar problem which was discussed here: http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/programming-9/replace-line-with-line-from-other-file-if-947590/\n", "Q: Lines running down screen of iPod touch 4th generation It's almost like stuck pixels- except they're moving down the screen...?

Does anyone know why iTunes does this? And does anyone know how to make these files appear in Finder?\nUpdate: I did a search on the rest of my music and found two other albums with the same problem. One has doubles of every song, the other has triples. Also, Finder appears to be showing the duplicates now, I don't know why. Maybe has to do with the OS X update that happened a couple days ago.\n\nA: This is likely happening because of the playlist and letting iTunes sort your music. Everytime you import the playlist the playlist imports the songs and then iTunes organizes those songs. For some reason it doesn't realize that's importing already organized songs. Find the playlist and delete it and the problem should go away chances are it's an .m3u.\n", "Q: How to change color scheme of Keynote slide design/template? I just made the switch to Mac.

One time or another I can see airplay icon that appears out of no where, I'm concerned that someone might get access to my mac, is there anything I can do to prevent others accessing my mac?\n\nA: More information about your exact situation would be helpful (i.e. are you sharing your network with roommates?), but I can provide some basic advice.\nOut of the box, your Mac is relatively secure. Other people can't access your files over the network unless you explicitly enable it. The Airplay icon simply means that someone on your network has an Apple TV—it doesn't mean that they can gain access to your Mac. Some things to check however:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is your Wi-Fi secured? Check by holding down the option key and clicking the Wi-Fi icon (). You should see an entry in the drop-down that says Security: WPA2 Personal. If you don't (or you see something like WPA), you should secure your Wi-Fi router. How to do so depends on your exact make and model.\n\n*Is automatic login turned off? Check this by going to the Users & Groups section of System Preferences, and click the Login Options section (in the left panel). Make sure the drop-down next to Automatic login is set to No. This requires you to enter your password whenever you boot your Mac.\n\n*Require a password when waking from sleep/screensaver. You can enable this in Security & Privacy section of System Preferences. It's a checkbox under the General tab. You'll also want to make sure that your computer is set to go to sleep or screensaver after a relatively short period of inactivity.\nThose should cover the basics of making sure most people can't access your Mac over the network or directly.\n\nA: There’s no way anyone can access your Mac until they are physically present. Airplay is just a media protocol and media can only be sent from your Mac to a receiving device.\n", "Q: How to move bookmarks *with icons* from Firefox to Safari I dumped my old Dell for a new MacBook Pro. Firefox looks gawdawful on my retina display, so I'm trying Safari. I had 20+ bookmarks in FF's Bookmarks Toolbar. Each had it's own icon, either grabbed from the target domain or from a picture I had saved... so I was able to give each one a one or two character name, so I easily could see them and select the ones I wanted. Upon the import, Safari ditched the icons. \n\n\n*\n\n*Is there any way to move bookmarks with icons from FFx to Safari? \n\n*Is there any way to even show icons on the Safari toolbar?  \n\n\nA: Safari doesn't show icons for bookmarks in the toolbar itself, only in the bookmark menus.\nThe icons aren't stored with the bookmarks, Safari has a separate cache for all the favicons of sites that have been visited (I believe this is the case for Firefox and Chrome as well, but I'm not 100% sure). If you look in the bookmarks viewer or menu, open a site that doesn't have an icon, then check back in the bookmarks viewer, you'll see that Safari has added the icon to that bookmark entry (assuming the site has a favicon set in the first place). So while you may not see icons at first for bookmarks you import, they'll fill in eventually as you visit the sites.\n", "Q: How much does it cost to service a MacBook Pro battery? I have a mid 2009 MacBook Pro and I just got a message saying that I should service my battery.\nI tried to reset SMC and NVRAM but the problem persists and I fear I'll have my battery replaced. How much is Apple going to charge me?\nMy Mac is out of warranty and I see that the battery capacity is less than 80% than it was originally but apart from that it is working fine\n\nA: See Replacing the Battery in your MacBook Pro for pricing information in various countries. In your case (Italy) it's 130 or 180€ depending on screen size.\n", "Q: How can I add login and logout sounds to OS X 10.8.x? I would like to add login and logout sounds to my Mac. How can I do this?\n\nA: Save a script like this as ~/Desktop/test and make it executable with chmod +x ~/Desktop/test.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nafplay /System/Library/Sounds/Blow.aiff\n\nYou can then add a LogoutHook key to /var/root/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist with sudo defaults write com.apple.loginwindow LogoutHook ~/Desktop/test. It can be deleted with sudo defaults delete com.apple.loginwindow LogoutHook. You can run a script at login by adding a LoginHook key or by using launchd.\nSee also these questions about running scripts on logout and login and Daemons and Services Programming Guide: Customizing Login and Logout.\n\nA: Just write this  Shutdown   maybe that will work \nShutdown\n\n", "Q: Does anyone know of an app or applescript to make it easier to simply save and email? I find that several times a day I save a file then compose a new email, click the add attachment button, and try to find the file.\nDoes anyone know of an app or applescript to make it easier to simply save and email?\n\nA: The app you want is called Mail. Seriously, what you need to do is save your file in whatever application you are using, then click the proxy icon (the little document icon found in the title bar of the window next to the document name) and drag it onto the Dock icon for Mail. This will create a new mail message with the file you just saved as an attachment.\n\nNo script or other app needed; awesomely, it's a native feature of OS X.\n", "Q: Is JavaScript secure? I have a couple of websites I have to use that require Java so I am leaving it on in Java Preferences.app, disabling it on all browsers bar one that will only be used for those sites. Am I safe to leave JavaScript on in Safari's preference's checkbox?\n\nA: As a security person, here is what I recommend:\n\n*\n\n*Yes, leave Javascript enabled.  It is a core part of the web and is about as safe as anything on the web.  (Also, if you turn off Javascript, you might as well uninstall your web browser, because almost nothing will work right any more.)  While there are no absolutes in life, leaving Javascript enabled is generally safe.  Javascript comes enabled by default, and I recommend you leave it that way.\nTo give you some relative risk factor: installing Flash or Java is significantly riskier than leaving Javascript enabled.\n(If you are a security paranoid and really concerned about Javascript, you could install Firefox and use the NoScript extension.  However, that doesn't make sense for most people, and isn't necessary for most people.)\n\n\n*Get rid of Java.  Java is a significant security risk.  There have been a spate of security problems in Java.  Oracle has not been doing a good job of responding to those problems in a timely fashion.  In addition, few sites really need Java.  Therefore, for most people, Java is just an unnecessary risk.\n(If you are one of the few who really needs Java for some website to work -- e.g., you turn off Java and you discover some internal corporate site doesn't work any more -- you may need to bite the bullet and leave Java enabled.  In that case, you're taking a calculated risk.)\nThis kind of question is not Safari-specific.  For those kinds of non-Apple-specific questions, Security.SE is another good resource.\n\nA: It's important to make the distinction between Java and JavaScript.\nJava is a general purpose programming language and associated runtime originally developed by Sun. Java programs can run inside a browser plug-in. There have been some recent vulnerabilities uncovered, and Apple has taken the step of disabling Java by default.\nJavascript is a scripting language used widely on the web to provide all sorts of dynamic behaviour for websites. Like anything, it's never going to be 100% secure, but because it's limited in what it can do (it can modify the behaviour of a webpage, but it can't run arbitrary code on your Mac or modify your files), it's safer than Java.\nJavascript is fairly safe to leave on (and it will cripple a lot of sites if you turn it off). If you definitely need Java, then leave it on, but be vigilant about running Software Update so that you get the latest security patches, and consider disabling it if you don't need to access those sites for a while. Disabling it in browsers you don't use for those sites is also a good idea.\n", "Q: Will iOS 6 be available OTA? With iOS 6 due the 19th of September, I was wondering if it will be available over-the-air (OTA) like iOS 5.1. \nIs the Software Update in Settings only for minor updates, or can Apple push out major releases through it, too? Assuming an OTA update, will it require a restore/resync?\n\nA: It will be available over-the-air, like all releases after iOS 5.0.\nThat version allowed iOS devices to be independent of any Mac or PC you may sync them to. More information is available from Apple's iOS page:\n\niOS updates are free. And they’re available to download wirelessly on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch the moment they’re released. Your device even alerts you when it’s time to get the latest version. So you won’t miss out on all the amazing features in new updates.\n\nA device should retain all your apps, content and settings after you update, but it's a good idea to ensure you have a recent backup, either on your computer or iCloud, just in case.\n", "Q: How to turn on the volume of ipod touch with a broken volume button? My ipod touch's volume button on the side to increase the volume doesn't work, no matter how hard I press it against something. The volume down button works.\nThe music player's sound is at the max, but the device uses another volume that's very low in volume. I can tell when I plug it into a wall, the beep sound is not very audible.\nHow can I increase the same volume these buttons work on?\n\nA: You can change the alerts volume in the Settings App.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Settings App. \n\n*Go to the Sounds section (typically the top of the second group of settings).\n\n*Change the slider under Ringer and Alerts to your desired volume.\n\n\nA: Either use the scrolling method when you are playing a song / video for the volume, or get a repair person to replace the buttons. I wouldn't recommend doing it if you haven't worked on iPods before, it's pretty difficult.\n\nA: If you are having trouble getting it to work it may be because of the auto lock feature on your iPod gen4. If you have control of the sleep button and home button but can't increase the volume and the display on your screen to adjust the volume at the bottom when you are listening to music won't come up. If you have this problem I know just the solution. Go into settings and get into general, then go to auto lock and adjust the time you have it set at to something different and that should solve your problems. It worked for me! If that doesn't fix it than you are well and truly screwed! :-/\n", "Q: How do I set my external monitor so that my gestures won't activate spaces on the external? I'm working with the new 13\" MacBook Pro and have just set up my external monitor.  I am looking to accomplish two things:\n1) How can I change the external monitor settings so that they do not respond to the gestures used for spaces?  That is, I want my laptop to respond to spaces while the external remains on a single screen.  \n2) Slightly related: is there a way to set up two independent sets of spaces between the laptop screen and the external monitor?  Again, having separate control of these two sets would be key.  \n\nA: Control over spaces and external displays is fairly limited in Lion. At the moment what you're looking for isn't possible.\nOne \"space\" is really the combination of your MacBook and external display, they can't be separated. Because of this, the number of spaces on your external display will be exactly the same as the number on your MacBook display, and you can't exclude one display from switching spaces or activating Mission Control.\n", "Q: What about generic lightning cables or adapters? Are lightning cables that are not manufactured by Apple (off-brand or generic) legal?\nIf not, when does it become okay to sell them? Because obviously the 30 pin adapter is everywhere..\n\nA: It's pretty much impossible to say for sure at the moment, as the cables aren't publicly available yet, nor are the licensing agreements, but we can do some informed speculation.\nFrom a legal standpoint, if Apple is granted patents on the connector, they could go after anyone who produces a copy without a license. So far I haven't seen any evidence they've applied for a patent on it (nor can I find any about the original dock connector), but that doesn't mean it hasn't/won't happen. However it's a timely process, as a patent won't be granted right away, and litigation also takes time.\nIt's also worth considering that there seem to be a lot of no-name manufacturers producing dock connectors, and I suspect that while the numbers may be large in the aggregate, the individual ones are small enough that it may not be worthwhile for Apple to pursue all the small entities in court. They don't seem to have made a dent in the off-brand market for cheap 30-pin dock connectors, based on searching Amazon.\nApple can (and almost certainly will) license third parties to manufacture their own cables and connectors—they do this currently with the Made for iPod/iPhone/iPad programs. Anything that has the \"MFi\" logo on it is made by a company that has paid license fees to Apple:\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, how difficult it is to produce depends on what's inside the connector exactly.\nApple has used various methods in the past to restrict certain dock connector features (mostly using some resistors in the connector I believe), but it's also possible that they'll use some active circuitry to prevent unlicensed copies. However I'd bet against that, as they have to make massive quantities of these, and the cost and production constraints of even a simple chip could make things problematic.\nThe physical connector is also unlike most other connectors out there (which come in all sorts of different sizes and shapes, but are largely made out of stamped metal with pins or an array of contact points). Everything on the Lightning connector is flush, and knowing Apple, the tolerances are probably fairly small. It may be different enough that it takes a while for other manufacturers to reproduce it consistently, but eventually I'm sure it's doable.\nSo my guess is that yes, we'll see cheap generic Lightning connectors, but it may take a bit longer, and the supply may ebb and flow if Apple takes legal action.\n", "Q: Can we simply rename an app if they are different versions and keep them both? For example, I have Xcode 4.4.1, and now Xcode 4.5 Golden Master (GM) version is available, but it is also called Xcode (when the .dmg is mounted as an disc image, it shows only one app (or folder), called Xcode)\nI think the way is just to double click on the .dmg file, and then drag and drop that app into our Applications folder.  But since the current Xcode and Xcode 4.5GM have the same name, can the new one just be renamed and so we can have both versions on our machine?  I was worried that what if the app writes back data to the /Applications/Xcode folder, then the GM version can write unexpected data for the 4.4.1 version.\nAnd will it work with other software, such as Xcode 3.2, Xcode 3.3, or even different versions of Microsoft Office and Adobe Photoshop?\n\nA: There are several things to look at here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Application (folder)\n\n\nIt's usually perfectly save to rename the application (aka the application folder) so you can easily rename the existing Xcode to /Applications/Xcode 4.4.1 and install the new version in parallel\n\n\n*\n\n*Preferences\n\n\nTypically the application saves it's preferences in a fixed location in ~/Library. So if you have two versions installed in parallel they will both read and write from the same preferences files. This may be desirable from a user point of view but will lead to problems if the format or content changed in incompatible ways.\n\n\n*\n\n*Addons\n\n\nAs far as Xcode is concerned, there is additonal software installed (automatically and/or on user request) in /Applications/Xcode Utilities. If you need this, it might not be enough to simply rename this folder because you will end up with two versions of these utilities (with Xcode/OS X picking up the \"wrong\" version)\n\nA: You should be fine. \nIf you download an application twice into your downloads folder it simply adds a -1 to the end of the name and the application functions as normal so I don't see why not. \n", "Q: iMac display -- can't change screen brightness on bootcamp with Windows 7 I can't change iMac (2011) display brightness on bootcamp with Windows 7.

I'm looking for a FTP client that supports sending notification when transfers have completed. Does anyone know of one?\nI'd like to trigger an email when files have finished uploading to a server.\n\nA: You can also use any FTP client which supports Growl notifications (Transmit, Forklift, YummyFTP, whatnot).\nIn Growl's (v2) preferences, go to the Displays tab and configure the MailMe action. Then in the Applications > Application tab, select the MailMe action for all notifications or, alternatively, switch to Applications > Notifications and select the MailMe action just for the notification you want.\n\nA: While I have not tried it myself, AbleFTP should do what you want. (Successful transfer should be task exit code 0.)\nThe same company also have a few other applications that claims to have email notification support, such as JaSFtp (link to Mac version broken on their homepage though) and Automize, which seems like overkill if you only want FTP.\nI also found Captain FTP, which on the feature page claims to have email notification, but I can't find any information about that in the manual so I can't say under what circumstances it will send an email.\n\nA: Captain FTP has email notification and a free download... not to bad an interface design either.\n", "Q: On what basis does the Finder update the file copy progression bar? I want to know that the progression of the progress bar in OS X is based on which factors by the Finder?\n\n\n*\n\n*Time (passing or estimated)\n\n*Number of files remaining\n\n*Size of files remaining\n\n\nIf possible, can we change the factor used in any way to match our choice?\n\n\nA: To make a somewhat educated guess\n\n\n*\n\n*The bar shows \"time spent\" vs. \"overall time expected\"\n\n*\"overall time expected\" is somewhat dynamic, depending on current throughput. So if you start of with a lot of small files (which usually take longer than a large one) transfer seems to speed up later (and vice versa)\n\n*I'm not aware of any way to change this\n\n\nPS: And no, I don't have a reference for that, just years of observation\n\nA: How a progress bar operates is completely up to the developer who wrote that portion of the application. If he/she has put no provisions in any preferences to allow a user to adjust or modify it then it can't be done. The class name in Cocoa is NSProgressIndicator, and the methods setMaxValue and setMinValue set the extremes of the bar, and it's up to the developer to increment the progress bar when it needs updating.\nYou MIGHT be able to adjust it if there's a setting for it, but usually not.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro hangs when booting into Boot Camp Windows 7 I have a 2011 Macbook Pro 15\" 10.7.4 with Windows 7 installed in Boot Camp. A few days ago, I tried to boot into Windows 7 and it just froze after I selected the Boot Camp volume on the Select Drive screen and the processor fan went into overdrive. This now happens every time. The only way to make it functional is to force-power-off and restart in OS X.\nI don't understand what's happening - Windows 7 works fine when I use it via Parallels, but won't boot to the metal.\nI've tried resetting the SMC and PRAM but nothing seems to work. This is extra frustrating because I need to use Windows for work.\nI looked here, but it's no help:\nBootloader freezes on login screen when booting into Lion from Boot Camp\n\nA: If you get a copy of Paragon NTFS for Mac you can do a disk repair for NTFS volumes. The software has a 10 day trial and a license is about $20. NTFS for Mac also serves as a driver for full access to NTFS volumes which is superior to the limited Read only access of NTFS volumes built into Macs. If you are a regular user of both Mac and Windows its worth the investment. \nOnce installed the program is accessible from System Preferences. For the problem described above you need to first unmount the volumes \"System Reserve\" and \"BootCamp\". Then remount the volumes and run verify on each volume.\n\n\n\nA: I have a 27\" iMac running Windows 7 Boot Camp and 10.10. I've occasionally had problems like this. \nUsually I can resolve it by booting to the Mac OS and running Disk Utility disk repair on both the Volume and OS X Partition. It would be nice if you could do it on your PC partition as well, but such is life.\nAnother thing you might want to check is your Console. Do a search for any I/O Errors. I had serious issues a while back with strange slowdowns on my Mac side, only to find that my PC partition was corrupted and every time the Mac looked at it (through spotlight or such), it hiccuped.\nI'm guessing you're using the whole Boot Camp-Parallels thing from your statement? Or is that a separate virtual machine?\n", "Q: Why does a MacBook Pro keep dialing in its location through Find My Mac after a clean install? Unfortunately my iPhone was stolen yesterday. I did have Find My iPhone enabled, but shortly after the theft my iPhone stopped updating its location. I believe the device was turned off, reset, or had it's SIM card removed.\nWhen finding my iPhone I did notice something interesting though, a MacBook Pro I used in the past but which was handed on to a colleague still shows up in my devices. It, however had a clean install of OS X after the HD was replaced, and is now only linked to my colleague's personal iCloud account, and doesn't even have Find My Mac currently enabled.\nTherefor my question is why and how this MacBook Pro is still being tracked in my iCloud account after a complete reset/reinstall? Is it being tracked by MAC address whenever it comes online? Do I have a chance of locating my iPhone in a similar way later on?\nI'd really like an authoritative answer on this, as this observed behavior raises additional questions on abuse of Find My Mac after buying a second-hand computer for example, as it seems you need to rely on the seller removing this device from his iCloud account.\n\nA: Here's what Apple says:\n\nBecause of how Find My Mac works, you must deselect the box next to Find My Mac in the OS X System Preferences > iCloud pane to remove your device from your iCloud Find My iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, or Mac device list.\n\nOne of the ways this persistence is implemented is by writing a Find My Mac token to NVRAM, the persistent memory in Intel Macs. You can see this token by running the following command in a terminal:\nnvram -p | grep fmm\n\nOn my Mac, the result includes my name, Apple ID, and the name I gave the computer, along with some encoded information that probably includes a key of some sort.\n\nA: I think it tracks by the \"Computer Number\" that every macbook has. This \"Number\" is assigned to your iCloud address on the Apple server, so when you use find my iPhone, it displays your old computer even though it's logged in to your colleges computer.You probably didn't logout of iCloud before clean restoring it. And of course, when you restore the software on the iPhone, it's still assigned to your iCloud account, so yes, I think you should be able to.\n", "Q: MacBook Air mid 2011 external Display resoltion > 1080p which adapter? I want to use my new 27\" Display in full resolution. I've tried two different cheap mini displayport to hdmi adapters but they only work with a max resolution of 1080p.\nDo I really need an expensive Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link-DVI-adapter or should i try a mini displayport to displayport adapter to get the full 2560x1440 resolution?\n\nA: Mac OS X should detect the supported resolutions when you connect the display. Your problem might indeed be related to the adapter and cable you are using. According to the HDMI 1.4 spec, standard HDMI cables only support resolutions up to 1080i.\nI suggest you use the DisplayPort or DVI port on your monitor instead, and buy the appropriate adapter for one of those.\n\nA: Try picking up a mini displayport to displayport cable like the Accell B119B-007J\nUsing the display port was the only way I found to get the max resolution.  \n", "Q: iPhone backplate mod: On what side of the iPhone 4S backplate should I paint? My iPhone backplate was broken.

This means that ~/.bash_profile looks like this:\nif [ -f ~/.bashrc ];\nthen\n  source ~/.bashrc\nfi\n\n~/.bashrc looks like this:\nsource ~/bin/dotfiles/bashrc\n\nand ~/bin/dotfiles/bashrc looks like this:\n. ~/bin/dotfiles/bash/env\n. ~/bin/dotfiles/bash/config\n. ~/bin/dotfiles/bash/aliases\n\n~/bin/dotfiles/bash/env, which is where I set my $PATH variable, looks like this:\nexport EDITOR=\"kom\"\nexport PATH=some/path/at/start:usr/local/bin:/Users/jim/pear/bin:~/bin:/Users/jim/.gem/ruby/1.8/bin:/Users/jim/bin/bashscripts:some/path/at/end:$PATH\n\nI've added some/path/at/start and some/path/at/end for debugging purposes, since when I try echo $PATH I get this:\n/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/Users/jim/bin:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:some/path/at/start:usr/local/bin:/Users/jim/pear/bin:/Users/jim/bin:/Users/jim/.gem/ruby/1.8/bin:/Users/jim/bin/bashscripts:some/path/at/end:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin\nThat is, there's a load of other stuff being loaded into the $PATH variable that I can't control in the configuration I've outlined above. Any ideas as to where this stuff is loaded from, so that I can go about changing it and moving /usr/local/bin before /usr/bin?\n\nA: The INVOCATION section of the bash man page says\n\nWhen bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive shell with the --login option, it first reads and executes commands from the file /etc/profile, if that file exists. After reading\n  that file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and\n  ~/.profile, in that order, and reads and executes commands from the\n  first one that exists and is readable.\n\nOf particular interest is /etc/profile, which uses path_helper to build a path from what it finds in /etc/paths and /etc/paths.d/*.\n\nA: If you fix the typo in your PATH assignment and replace usr/local/bin with /usr/local/bin Homebrew should stop complaining.\nThe other stuff (/opt/local/...) is definitively added somewhere later during shell initialization (meaning after source ~/.bashrc or after . ~/bin/dotfiles/bash/env). You will have to look through the different files (or grep for /opt/local or PATH.*PATH) to see where it happens (and why).\n\nA: There's also the system wide bashrc, which is found at  /etc/bashrc, and a couple others.\nFrom man bash:-\nFILES\n       /bin/bash\n              The bash executable\n       /etc/profile\n              The systemwide initialization file, executed for login shells\n       ~/.bash_profile\n              The personal initialization file, executed for login shells\n       ~/.bashrc\n              The individual per-interactive-shell startup file\n       ~/.bash_logout\n              The individual login shell cleanup file, executed when a login shell exits\n       ~/.inputrc\n              Individual readline initialization file\n\n", "Q: How can I protect headphone jack from heavy cable? So far I have ruined the headphone jack of one iPhone and one iPod with the the trauma from the frequent yanking of the heavy cable of my Sennheiser HD280 Pro headphones:\n\nI think the damage mostly happens when I keep the iPhone or iPod in my pocket and walk around. Not only will my leg push the plug, but the heavy cord will also yank it slightly with every step. Because the plug is much larger than that of Apple's ear bugs, it becomes a larger lever, gradually loosening the jack.\nApart from getting lighter headphones, how can I prevent it from happening again? The best idea I have come up with is to use a six-inch extension cable with a right-angle plug; this should at least reduce the leverage.\n\nWill this be sufficient to prevent damage? Does anyone have better ideas?\n\nA: The short nub of the L shaped jack should work nicely to avoid a large lever sticking out of your headphone jack.\nI actually prefer a different approach to this problem of leverage - a flexible and much shorter adapter that bends like a tree in the wind rather than breaking as a rigid lever must do.\nThe Monster iCablelink adapter is high quality and very inexpensive on the internet.\n\nAs you can see there are only the two stereo pins on this adapter so you will lose any microphone (and likely any button control) so you will want to select an adapter to pass those pins through if you need microphone functionality.\n\n\nA: The extension idea is a good solution, just make sure you come up with a way to support the heavy cable, that does not involving the weight of the cable being distributed through any of the connection jacks. Tying the two cables together using a loose square knot may also be helpful to avoid the cable from being unplugged from the extension cord.\nSupport the weight of the cable using something other than a iDevice.\n\n\n*\n\n*One way to do this would be to wrap, or tie an end of the heavy cable around a pole or similar thing that is attached to something secure, and from that run the extension cable to your iPhone or iPod.\n\n*Run the cable under a heavy textbook or other similar (paper weight like object), then the the extension to the iPhone, etc.\n\n*In the Mobile Case running the end of the headphones through a belt loop could help as well as constraining any excess cable slack so that you only have just enough to go from the pocket to your head. Lastly placing the cable under a shirt or jacket should reduce snag ups substantially too.   \nNote: Below pictured is a desk based example of a secure pole that you could tie a cable end around. Placing the headphone cable or the linked extension cable around the black pipe just above the chrome base plate attached to the desk would provide a secure foundation.\n\n", "Q: How can I play an audio file on intial startup of Macbook Pro I have a simple Automator script that is setup to run as a login item. The Automator scripts plays a .wav file as follows:\nafplay \"/Users/Audio Files/system_alert.wav\"\n\nThis works perfectly however I am looking to refine it to play on just the initial login of a user vs subsequent logins due to the system being either manually locked or automatically locking. I am currently running OS X 10.8.1 Mountain Lion. Is this somehow possible? I have Googled around and have not found much in the way of obvious options.\n\nA: I am closing this question. I rebuilt the automator script and compiled to .APP and re-tested. @patrix is correct in that the script does only execute upon initial login and not on subsequent unlocking of the system due to inactivity. I am not sure why it was doing so previously but the issue is resolved.\n", "Q: Contacts first and last name order inconsistent between iCloud.com and iPhone The iCloud.com Contacts interface orders the name fields as following: Last name, First name\nOn the iPhone, the order is reversed: First name, Last name.\nCan this be adjusted so the order matches?\n\nA: *\n\n*For the iPhone you can adjust the order of fields in Preferences -> Mail, Contacts, Calendar\n\n*For iCloud you can do the same by opening the Contacts web app and selecting Preferences (cog wheel in the lower left corner)\n\n", "Q: Is It Possible to Have the iPhone Speak the Name of the Caller? I am wondering if there is any software or any way that the iPhone can can be made to speak the name of the person who is calling. The reason I am asking is because I use a bluetooth headset all of the time and need to know who is calling so I don't need to look at my phone all of the time.\n\nA: If you enable VoiceOver (in Settings → General → Accessibility), your phone will speak the numbers (or names for contact entries) of incoming calls. However it changes the user experience of the phone substantially (it will read everything on screen for you). I'm not aware of any way to enable VoiceOver just for phone calls unfortunately.\nAnother option would be to record custom ringtones reading the number/name for some of your contacts (you can assign custom ringtones in the Contacts app). This is obviously time consuming (although if you have  a Mac, you could speed it up with some scripting of Address Book and the system reader), and only useful for the contacts you set custom ringtones for—any incoming call not in your address book is out of luck.\nThere's very little integration with the Phone app available for third party apps—not much more than sending a number to call, so it's unlikely this could be solved by an app without jail breaking (and possibly not even then, I don't know).\n\nA: I'm using since years the app CallTell available on cydia (so available only for jailbroken devices). I've tried it on iPhone 3GS, 4,4s and now 5 and it worked fine, even though since I've updated to iOS 6.0.1 I'm having some bugs on it, the reason why I was here looking around if there is another app doing the same job....but I really encourage you guys to try it if you have none. The app doesn't add an icon on your home screen, is set up on the device settings screen. The app speaks call, messages (caller and/or text) and even applications notifications. All of these things can the configured on silent, ringing of both modes. You can put it on, off and even configure the text to speak before the name \n\nA: There is now such an App available in the App Store. It can even look up unknown numbers in the web (reverse Caller ID lookup) and then tells you who's calling. The App is called:\nRingRing - Who's calling me from this number?\n", "Q: How to make a script which runs on login? My ISP requires me to login to their server and keep the login page up so I can use the Internet, which makes me uncomfortable while I download some big files.

What am I doing wrong?\nUsing Safari 6.0 (7536.25) on Lion 10.7.4.\n\nA: I don't typically use Safari's password storage, but I just tested it, and I got the same results (also on 10.7.4).\nWhat you can do as a workaround is open up Keychain Access, and in the search box, tip in \"Web form password\". That should show you all the passwords Safari has stored, and you can delete them there. Re-open Safari Preferences to double-check you got them all, but that should do the trick.\n\nA: You may also want to use the \"Reset Safari...\" feature (in main Safari menu). With the exception of certain plugin data, this will wipe everything from Safari, including passwords, history, downloads, autofill, cookies, caches, etc.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/PH5043\n", "Q: Mountain Lion Messages: Gmail user is not registered with iMessage I'm trying to use Messages instead of Adium, but it won't let me chat with some of my contacts.\nThese aren't iMessage accounts, but gmail users.

I've bought an 11\" MacBook Air a month ago. The 9 came out from the keyboard after few hours and I couldn't believe it. They gave me a new MacBook Air. One month later I'm using it and today the T is too strong to press and I can hardly type it. \nI had another Mac before, and it lasted for years and I had no issues with the keyboard. This laptop never hit the floor; nothing's happened to it. \nI can't believe I have to come back to the Apple Store and tell them the keyboard is broken again. What do you think about it? Is a line defect?\n\nA: I doubt it, it's the first I've heard of any keyboard issues on any MacBook that I recall—the keyboards are traditionally highly regarded for quality.\nI think sadly you've probably just had some bad luck. No matter how well designed it is, something as complicated and mass-produced as a MacBook Air is going to have some bad units.\nYou may want to try blowing some compressed air under that key though, it's possible that something is physically stuck under there, impeding the movement. Someone (ahem, possibly me) once ate a poppyseed bagel near my keyboard and a loose poppyseed caused some issues for a while before it got knocked loose.\n\nA: My advice would be to first spend some time at the Genius bar and ask them to show you how the keys work. Don't worry about the past for this appointment and focus on the problem you have now. You can then relate the past experience with the tech towards the end of the conversation to see how normal your experience is.\nWith the millions of devices out there, if there were truly a design issue, there would be a line out the door and around the block with people needing service.\nIt's entirely possible you just had bad luck or are getting some small debris under the keys. Even a pet hair in the right place can disrupt the exacting tolerances needed for the scissors to work if you pay attention to thinks like initial force to press and final force to press or compare one device to another side by side and study the key action with care.\nOnce a technician shows you the underside of the keys and perhaps your T key the cause of the odd pressure to activate should be clear to everyone.\nIn this case, you will see there is one spring that encases the key's electrical contact, four plastic to metal pin joints and two plastic to plastic pin joints. For the larger keys like the option, return or space bar there are additional metal struts plus larger and/or more than one scissor mechanism.\nAs with many things Apple, the devil is in the details and the details here are quite fine.\n\nA: After replacing the macbook air for the key \"9\" broken after one day, they replaced the keyboard for free last week for the second issue (the key \"t\" not working well). Great\n", "Q: DisplayPort to HDMI Adapter doesn't play audio on Samsung TV I can't make my MacBook Pro mid 2009 play audio on my Samsung LCD TV.

Try sudo launchctl list com.apple.metadata.mds, and look at the PID (id of currently running process, probably 0 since it's not running) and LastExitStatus (which would be 0 if it exited successfully, but may be something else in this case).

Also, look in /Library/Logs/CrashReporter for any relevant reports.\nAs for possible causes: if the logs don't tell you where the problem is, my first guess would be a broken mdimporter plug-in; I'd remove everything (temporarily) from /Library/Spotlight and ~/Library/Spotlight. Also, check /System/Library/Spotlight, and make sure these are the only mdimporters there:\nApplication Archives Audio Automator Bookmarks Chat CoreMedia Font Image MIDI Mail Notes PDF PS QuartzComposer RichText SystemPrefs iCal iPhoto iPhoto8 vCard\nAnother possible cause is a badly corrupted spotlight database.

My son's iPad 2 was working well and any other computers and laptops could still access the Internet fine. Thinking this was only temporary and was late at night already, I waited for the next day to see if it resolved itself the next day. It did not. I hard rebooted the iPad 2, restarted the router, and tried to refresh the WiFi list by making the iPad 2 forget my home network and retyping the password. No success. I did an All Settings reset through the General menu and the problem continues to persist and I am thinking I might have to reformat the iPad 2 or sent it to the Apple Store as a last resort.\nWhen I check the WiFi settings, it is able to see the name of my router and many others, and when I attempt to connect to it, it simply is attempting to connect, but is simply stuck there.\nAny other methods to try would be appreciated.\n\nA: You might want to try restoring your router to factory defaults.

I'm having issues with Mountain lion in which I am unable to use my non-Apple keyboard's function keys, i.e. F1, F2 etc.  Upon firing up System Preferences ➤ Keyboard, this is what I'm greeted with.\n\nIn prior versions of the operating system there had been an option here to \n\nUse all F1, F2 keys as standard function keys...\n\n...which enabled me to utilize the Functions keys, as expected, instead of triggering whatever \"Hot Key\" usually hijacks that binding ordinarily.\n\nHow can I get this capability back under 10.8.x?\n\nA: It's still shown for me.

I asked the seller just to be on the safe side, would this cable work with an AppleTV and he said it will not work. \nFrom searching the Apple site it seems the only thing the HDMI cable needs is HDCP capability which the seller claims the cable has. The cable is also 1.4 with Ethernet capabilities so it seems to be top of the range. \nWould there be any reason why this cable wouldn't work or do I have to purchase a special Apple one?\nLink: Item\n\nA: There is no reason why it wouldn't work. In fact I use even cheaper (but shorter) cables myself and they work fine. For reference, I paid €0.75 a piece for a couple of 0.75m HDMI cables with a local online cable shop, and they work fine for 1080p video.\nI'd advise to not succumb to the \"gold or silver plated\" marketing nonsense or the overpriced \"premium\" HDMI cables, as even the cheap cables transport your binary 1s and 0s just fine.\n\nA: A standard HDMI cable should be fine, there is no need to buy a special Apple branded one (or any other premium brand unless you're playing with resolutions way beyond those supported by the AppleTV).\n\nA: I have an Amazon Basics HDMI cable that works fine with my Apple TV. I also have a cable from Monoprice that works with my other Apple TV.\nSome people are under the misapprehension that every Apple connector is proprietary. \n", "Q: How do I get Sublime Text's open-file GUI to show hidden files?

If it existed, it would most probably be in System Preferences > Appearance.\nHowever, this behavior seems to depend on the application. On my 10.6 system, the Finder and iTunes indeed present it, but iCal, Mail and Safari don't.\nI unfortunately have no idea as to the root cause for this difference, and which programs might behave in which way.\n", "Q: Stop mouse interfering with Cmd + Tab menu When pressing cmd + Tab the mouse can steal focus of a program icon. This is frustrating.\nIs there a setting to make the cmd + Tab ignore the mouse?\n\nA: Keyboard Maestro provides an Activate Application Switcher action that you can map to cmd + tab in a macro to replace the OS X application switcher.\nWithin the Activate Application Switcher action there is an option Enable mouse rollover selection that is on by default but can be disabled. This won't be a seamless replacement to the OS X application switcher but it's something to try and see if you like it.\n\n\nA: I am experiencing the same problems. There is no setting I know of to disable the mouse from interfering with cmd+tab, but Mission Control is a great alternative. You can press F3 or click its dock icon:\n\n\nA: I recommend LightSwitch X. It's no longer maintained by the developer, but I'm using the last version (2.8.3, circa November 2014) under 10.12.6 and it works well.\n", "Q: What does this mean? \"When purchased, this movie will not be available from iTunes in the Cloud\" In the iTunes Store, specifically in regards to movies, what does this mean? \"When purchased, this movie will not be available from iTunes in the Cloud\" \nI'm seeing it on the individual movie page for the new Indiana Jones bundle \nCan the movie only be downloaded once?\nCan I download the 720p version now, and then download the 1080p version later?\nI don't really care about streaming from the cloud; I have a Mac mini setup as an iTunes \"server\", I'm just concerned that I'd only be able to download one version, one time.\n\nA: Yes, some studios only allow a movie to be downloaded once, so you see this message. I'd wait until you're able to download the 1080p version.\n\nA: That means that the company which holds the rights to the movie hasn’t allowed Apple to make it available from iTunes in the Cloud.\nIf you buy an HD version, you can choose to download either 720p or 1080p. You can download these movies only once.\nSorry, I thought you were talking about iTunes Match.\n\nA: OK, I think I've managed to answer my own question, at least the practical components.\nAwhile ago, I bought Spartan and several other movies with the same disclaimer, which I didn't notice at the time. I downloaded the 720p versions of each at the time I purchased them.\nI can now confirm that:\na) All of these movies show up in my list of Purchased items in iTunes.\nb) All of these movies have the \"Download from the Cloud\" icon in the Purchased items list.\nc) Changing the HD video preference to 1080p in iTunes Store Preferences and re-downloading the movies does indeed give the 1080p version! (Where available, not all HD movies have 1080p versions, some top out at 720p.)\nd) I have now downloaded three movies that came with this disclaimer twice each; once at time of purchase and again last night.\nAt this point, my best guess is that the disclaimer about a movie not being \"available in iTunes in the Cloud\" has to do with streaming from the cloud to an iOS device or AppleTV. It does not appear to affect re-downloading in other HD formats.\nAlso, as an aside, I can confirm that the AppleTV 2 (mine at least) will play 1080p content, albeit downsampled to 720p. I saw no stuttering or buffer-pausing. And subjectively, I think the 1080p version looked better—even downsampled.\n", "Q: What does setting LSUIPresentationMode to 1 or 2 do? While reading \"Is it possible to hide the dock on a per-application basis?\", I noted that according to the documentationLSUIPresentationMode, setting LSUIPresentationMode to value 1 or 2 (in an application's Info.plist) should mean that \"system UI elements in the content area of the screen are hidden\", and (it is implied) that this includes the Dock. \nIn practice setting this key to values 1 or 2 appears to do nothing (neither the dock nor anything else disappears), while values 3 and 4 behave as documented.\nDo values 1 and 2 ever have a useful effect?  If so, what is it?\n(I have tested this setting with a variety of different apps, including Aperture, Chess, Stickies and Emacs, all under OS X 10.6.8.  The behaviour was identical in each case: settings 3 and 4 behaved as described, while settings 1 and 2 appeared to have no effect whatsoever.)\n\nA: I believe those keys are intended for cases where you're writing an app that will use its own full screen mode (such as a video player or game). To see any effect from changing them the app likely needs to be coded appropriately, not just have the key set in its Info.plist.\n", "Q: Apple ID with iCloud email address? Can you create an Apple ID with the iCloud email address it comes with? (if I enable it)\n\nA: That’s a catch 22 situation. You want to create an Apple ID with an iCloud email address which is created when you create an Apple ID with an iCloud email address which is created…\nIf you mean a new Apple ID with an old iCloud email, then no, that’s not possible.\n", "Q: Is it normal to still see what's on the screen when it's fully dimmed? I'm using an external monitor, so most of the time I've got the MacBook Air's internal screen dimmed to 0. But it doesn't switch off completely at 0 brightness as I can still see some graphical elements. They're hardly discernible but still there.\nI was wondering if this is normal.\nUnfortunately I couldn't find any other way to disable the built-in screen.\n\nA: If you use only the second screen, you can safely close the lid of your MacBook Air and work only on the second screen, it will automatically switch it as the main and only screen.\n\nA: This is normal for LCDs that have the backlight off (which is what brightness at zero does), but which are still turned on. As far as I know, it's a side-effect of how LCDs work. The LCD screen itself turns the pixels on or off, but a CCFL or LED backlight behind the screen shines through to illuminate them. So while the backlight is off, the pixels are still active, just very hard to distinguish them.\nI find on my old 2006 MBP, the Apple light from the lid leaks enough light that I can read a bit of text in the centre of my screen, even at zero brightness.\n", "Q: How to download pre-built binaries from MacPorts without installing? I see as of 2.0 MacPorts is hosting pre-built binaries, which it would install by default if licensing is present and compatible. I'm looking for a more current version of rsync than ships by default with Macs, and has the necessary patches (which I believe are missing in the rudix makefile) and I would then distribute it like a regular install, for example nesting in a NetBoot or pushing out over a patch management solution instead of installing locally.\nWhere can I download the prebuilt binary, which I'm assuming I could treat like a package install, including man pages?\n\nA: Macports guide says \n\nMacPorts can pre-compile ports into binaries so applications need not be compiled when installing on a target system. MacPorts may create two types of binaries: archives and packages.\n\nHowever I found issues with packages a few years ago (which might have been fixed) and the following is more of how I view MacPorts.\nIf MacPorts does have a binary package which it does in most cases then it behaves exactly as a package install including man pages. The only difference is that you need the command line compiler and the MacPorts sources (not the sources of the packages) installed and that the code is in /opt/local.\nAlso due to shared libraries you can't just take an executable and run it it probably depends on other shared libraries which MacPorts also provides.\nAs for centralisation you could easily install on one machine and then rsync or rdist to all the others (or use other macOS replication mechanisms) or as MacPorts pointed out set up a local repo. \n\nA: packages.macports.org\nHOWEVER, as I was informed in #MacPorts IRC, providing 'free' compiled binaries certainly isn't the purpose of the MacPorts project. MacPorts can create installation packages that get around the need for having MacPorts installed as well, but may conflict or be incomplete in unspecified ways. You can host a local repo of software for MacPorts to utilize as well, which is another option for distribution locally.\nIn this case I just was hoping to have someone with more experience building the rsync binary decide which patches are necessary for macs, and I would not exploit the service they're providing.\n\nA: The -b option have saved a lot of my time:\nsudo port -b install  perl5.26\n\n\nA: <jmr> easye: the full story is                                                                       \n      https://trac.macports.org/wiki/howto/ShareArchives2               [23:33]                      \n<jmr> but if you only want to transfer one archive there is a shortcut                               \n<jmr> the magic place is ${prefix}/var/macports/incoming/verified   \n\n", "Q: Can't remote into Mac mini I have a MacBook Pro and a Mac mini, both running Mountain Lion. This problem, however, started when I had Lion. I can remote in to my MacBook Pro just fine from my iPhone and iPad. But I can't remote into my Mac mini. It started out just fine and I could remote into the Mac mini from my iPhone, iPad as well as my MacBook Pro. Later (I was still on Lion), I could still log in from my iDevices but no longer could from my MacBook Pro. This behavior continued after installing Mountain Lion. Now, I can't remote in from anywhere. I want to avoid doing a clean install, but I will I have to.\nI have tried switching from Remote Management under Sharing to Screen Sharing, and back. nothing works. Recently (before I lost the ability to remote in at all, but after I lost the ability to remote in from my MacBook), I also lost the ability to edit my parental controls on the Mac mini from my MacBook. Little by little, I am completely losing the ability to remote in/screen share to my Mac mini at all. Currently, I can only remote in via SSH for a terminal.\nMy network includes my AirPort Extreme, Time Capsule, MacBook Pro (mid-2010), Mac mini (mid 2010), iPad (3), iPhone 4S, and my father's PC. Only my father's PC is connected by wire. The rest is wireless.\nIf anyone can guide me in the right direction, I'll be very grateful.\n\nA: Some more info would be helpful here. What app are you using on your iOS devices and Mac to connect to your Mini? What happens when you try to connect—do any errors appear, or does nothing appear to happen?\nFirst off, make sure Screen Sharing is enabled in Sharing Preferences (Remote Management is only for using Apple Remote Desktop, so don't bother with that unless you're actually using that program). Double-check that Allow access is set to either \"All Users\", or \"Only these users\" with your user name included in the box.\nNow try connecting from another Mac, using the Finder's Connect to Server dialog (under the Go menu, or ⌘K). Under Server Address, type in vnc://IP_OF_YOUR_MINI then hit connect. If you can connect that way, but not using the Finder's Shared panel, then the problem is likely in the Bonjour service that advertises the screen sharing option.\nAnother thing to check is what version of Apple Remote Desktop Client you have installed. If you have 3.6, there's a bug that can cause timeouts for Screen Sharing/VNC clients. The temporary fix is removing /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement and re-installing 3.5.3. This worked for me on Lion, I don't know if it will work on Mountain Lion. Make sure to keep a backup copy of the files you delete, in case the install doesn't work.\n", "Q: Fix Safari 6 Address Bar Selection Behavior This is probably just something I have to live with, but with Safari 6 Apple made the address bar different from every other text field on the OS, in that a single click (at least when it's displaying a URL) selects the entire contents of the text field rather than placing the insertion point. \nIt's probably a long shot, but is there a defaults write command or similar that fixes this?\n\nA: This is built-in to Safari 6. To the best of my knowledge, there is (currently) no flag to control this with.\n", "Q: Mac Mail forgets my email password every few days. How to fix it? I'm running Mac OS 10.8.1 and have a (personal) Gmail and a (work) Google mail account setup inside Mail client. Every few days (weekly?) Mail seems to forget my personal gmail password and I have to re-enter it again. \nThis bug seems minor except that with Google 2 Factor authentication, this involves a trip to Google accounts and setting up another password etc. So this bug is hugely annoying when it manifests itself. I don't see this issue on iOS Mail (iPad as well as iPhone) nor on Outlook 2010.\nI tried a solution at http://805creative.com/blog/what-to-do-when-apple-mail-keeps-forgetting-your-passwords.html but the plist in question doesn't exist on OS 10.8.1 ..\n[UPDATE:] This can happen on either the IMAP (incoming) or SMTP (outgoing) servers. I just saw it happen on the incoming and then 5 mins later on the outgoing. Thankfully I misspelt the label of the outgoing server ('GMial') to notice it was complaining about a different server!\n\nA: For years, and it still is true, I've had the pattern that Mail claims to have forgot the password but it's actually reacting to some other problem. If you hit the (Cancel) button on the \"enter new password\" dialog, you should find that it continues to work just fine.\nAt one time, this syndrome was clearly associated with network problems talking to the mail server (Microsoft Exchange, as it happened); I could tell this by correlating messages in the Console log. More recently, I haven't always been able to identify the underlying problem, but the trick of canceling the password prompt still seems to work all the time, for me.\n\nA: One thing to try is opening Keychain Access and manually deleting all Gmail related items, then restarting Mail and re-authenticating. I've noticed sometimes that older Gmail passwords tend to stick around in there.\n\nA: I have seen this error message on accounts where I know Mail (or how it interacts with the keychain) isn't the problem. The problem is the alert is wrong but Mail isn't smart enough to tell the difference between a network/server problem and a password problem.\nWhat I presume is happening is the Mac can't get a log in to the server and prompts you to check the password when the problem is entirely on the server / network end. No amount of re-entering the password into the keychain will fix this sort of error - and rather than go through the steps to re-enter the password, you can check online by logging into webmail with the stored password.\nIf that works, you know the keychain and Mac are fine and instead look at the network or mail server as the cause of the temporary failure that mail is blaming incorrectly on a password issue.\n\nA: That DisplayUnlockCaptcha page, solved the issue for me:\nhttps://accounts.google.com/b/0/DisplayUnlockCaptcha\n\nA: I've found that if I go to the keychain to find my smtp password (which is the one that always goes for me) and then go to mail settings and re-enter it, it often sorts out the problems.. but, when it doesn't, I have to log into my google account and revoke the app specific password I use for mac mail (as I've got 2 step auth setup). I then have to enter this new password in mail settings for both the imap and smtp sections of the account. \n", "Q: Mac OS X Java megazoomer: no matching architecture in universal wrapper Whenever I try to run a Java program with a GUI through Terminal using the `java' command, I get the following error:\n2012-09-17 11:37:35.287 java[2486:2617] Error loading /Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins/megazoomer.bundle/Contents/MacOS/megazoomer: dlopen(/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins/megazoomer.bundle/Contents/MacOS/megazoomer, 265): no suitable image found.

I tried a bunch of different things, such as re-installing Java or changing permissions for that file, but nothing worked.\nI've done some more research in the mean time, and correct me if I'm wrong here, the megazoomer thing has to do with the green magnification button of windows, right?\nI run on OS X 8.1, with my Java version being:\njava version \"1.6.0_33\"\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_33-b03-424-11M3720)\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.8-b03-424, mixed mode)\n\nSo yeah, if any of you know what this is, what's causing it, and how to fix it, then any and all input would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: Anything in /Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins has been installed after SIMBL which is is a way of injecting code into a Cocoa app using an Input Manager. SIMBL is a third party add in, the link to megazoomer from the SIMBL page gives a Not found so I would assue it is not maintained.\nI would guess the actual error is that megaxoomer does not have a 64 bit Intel version.\nUnless you want the extra functions of megazoomer I would delete all the SIMBL plugins ie delete /Library/Application Support/SIMBL and unsinstall SIMBL as per SIMBL docs. \n\nYou can run the SIMBL Uninstaller app included with the installer.\n\nBasically unless you know exactly what you are running SIMBL for I would uninstall it.\n", "Q: How do I run a screen saver as my desktop background?

My old original Macbook Pro is near dead and no longer upgradable on the software or hardware side. The VA has offered to purchase a PC laptop for me (Because my syllabi says computer required), but I do not want to go backwards. I have a lot invested in OS X software and Mac peripherals, not to mention I prefer to program in that environment. PC vs. Mac costs are so drastically different that I must validate my request for a new Macbook Pro. In my request to the VA, I stated the above and some other topics but they requested more validation. Can anyone recommend issues, reasons, etc. to help me validate this purchase by the VA for school?\n\nA: I'm only guessing here, but would it be helpful if you told the program that you intend to study iOS (iPhone and iPad) development? Is there a class in iOS development offered at your school? You can only develop for iOS using Xcode on a Mac. That way you could make the case that you require a Mac and not a Windows PC to do your coursework.\n\nA: It's hard to give a definitive answer without knowing the ins and outs of the process, but my advice is to give as much \"hard\" evidence for why this is the better option. Saying you work better under OS X is all well and good (and certainly you don't have to sell that argument around here), but I suspect you'll get better results with a bureaucracy by giving them information that they can point to as objectively better.\nIn your case, the most objective figure I can think of would be to figure out the replacement value of your investment in Mac software and peripherals. Compile a list of all your current software and hardware that you could bring over to a new Mac, and then do some research and come up with an estimated cost to replace all that on a Windows PC. If you're in a software development program, also keep in mind that Xcode is free, while Visual Studio is hundreds of dollars (although it may be included in a site license for students in your program).\nYou might also want to try contacting some of the faculty and see if there are any who would be willing to write a letter to the effect that a Mac is better suited for your program.\n", "Q: byobu using invalid 'readlink -f' option on OS X Mountain Lion I just installed byobu on mountain lion by running\n./configure  \nmake  \nmake install\n\nThe install seems good. But byobu is trying to use 'readlink -f' which is an illegal option with OS X and any other BSD system (I think).\nIs there any kind of hack I can do to get around this?\n\nA: If you lack readlink -f functionality, the coreutils and tmux are likely the missing dependencies. Please edit your question if you have them installed and this doesn't fix the issue.\n", "Q: Syncing without iCloud I have a household with an iMac that has 1 account that automatically logs on, and 1 iTunes account.\nThe itunes account has 2 different libraries, although the only difference is some of the (non-DRM) music.\nThere is an iPad shared by many people, and a phone used by one person.\nWhat is the easiest way to sync things like music between all machines while keeping things like notes on the phone private, but still being able to back them up to the iMac?\nWould prefer not to use iCloud if possible, as it looks complicated for the people I am setting it up for.\n\nA: iCloud itself doesn't sync music; iTunes Match does that.\nA good solution might be to use iTunes Match to sync all the music between computers. In my experience with iTunes Match, all the complexity is up-front; after the initial upload, getting new devices on it and using them is super easy.\nWith Match enabled, just sync the iPhone to the iMac like you would have in pre-iOS 5 days and the notes won't leave the two of them if you don't use iCloud.\n", "Q: Synchronising contacts between iCloud and iOS I have a problem with my contacts synching between iPhone and iCloud. There is a number of contacts that appears with the tag iCloud in my phone, although they arent on the iCloud website or my contacts app in OSX.\nHere is how the contact looks on my iPhone.\n\nThat same contact does not appear on iCloud.\nOn bottom of contact says:\n\nHow can I fix this problem, without adding missing contacts manually ?\n\nA: From iCloud settings turned off contacts, then back on. Then missing contacts appeared on iCloud although I got double contacts on iPhone. So I close iCloud contacts again and remove iPhone contacts, then back on and contacts sync with iCloud properly without doubles.. \n", "Q: Automatically reboot OS X 10.7 after kernel panic? Is there a way to set up Mac OS X (10.7) to automatically reboot after kernel panics?\nYes, it shouldn't kernel panic, I know.  But it does.  I've replaced all the RAM in the system, ran memtest and smart test but it still crashes about once a week.  No 3rd party kernel modules loaded.  It would be almost not annoying if it was automatically rebooting, hence the question.\n\nA: Open the Energy Saver pane in System Preferences. There's an option to Restart automatically if the computer freezes, if you check that you should get the behaviour you desire.\nNote that there are two tabs in Energy Saver—one for when you're on battery and one for when you're running from the power adapter; make sure you set it for each state you want.\n\n\nA: I don't know if something changed on Mountain Lion, but I no longer have the checkbox to restart automatically if the computer freezes.\nMy MacBook Air restarts automatically a few seconds after this message is shown:\n\nIf I'm using it in clamshell mode, I can press any key on an external keyboard to restart immediately.\n\nA: The option in energy saver is not there on my Mac Pro machines running Mac OS 10.14.4. Running this as root does the trick:\nsystemsetup -setrestartfreeze on\n\n", "Q: Can you disable a code signature check? I wrote a patch/utility that disables OS X's default functionality of starting iTunes when the play button is pressed.  This utility basically modifies the Remote Control Daemon (rcd) and comments out the Apple Script command to start iTunes.  This has worked fine until 10.7, but with 10.8 rcd now has code signature.  The patch now causes Exception Type:  EXC_CRASH (Code Signature Invalid) after the executable is patched.\nObviously, the code signature checking is working as designed, but I was wondering if anyone has any ideas on what options I might have.  Is there a legit way to turn off this check on a single executable?  I have tried turning of GateKeeper, but that, understandably, didn't do it.\nAny other suggestions for disabling the play button?\n\nA: I got the patch to work after running sudo spctl --master-disable. I don't know if there is any way to use spctl to target only rcd though.\nReplacing the code signature with an ad-hoc identity with sudo codesign -f -s - /System/Library/CoreServices/rcd.app/ didn't seem to work. Edit: but as mentioned by user48986, it works if you specify the path to the executable, like sudo codesign -f -s - /System/Library/CoreServices/rcd.app/Contents/MacOS/rcd.\n\nA: To fix the signature of for example MirrorPro:\nsudo codesign -f -s - /Applications/MirrorPro.app/Contents/MacOS/MirrorPro\n/Applications/MirrorPro.app/Contents/MacOS/MirrorPro: replacing existing signature\n\n", "Q: What license is needed to use Apple hardware in a movie? I want to enter a short film in a NZ student film competition.\nI want to include a scene where a girl works on an Apple MacBook. Is it okay to show the Apple branding/logo in the film?\nThe fact it is an Apple computer is not important to the movie, it could be any laptop. Should I just keep the logo off the screen, or is it not OK to even show the white edge?\nI'd really appreciate helpful links to the Apple website or other reliable sources.\n\nA: Basically none. If you are not using their trademarks, logo by itself - which is entirely different than using the physical product as built by Apple or as modified in any way you please to change it with painting, stickers, or a even a hammer. You probably don't even need a license to show the software if that is incidental to the picture. What you can't do is imply that Apple endorses the film or use Apple products in marketing your film.\nIf you are thorough, you will want to have a look at both Apple's legal trademarks information and consult with whatever lawyer (or paralegal) is helping you with other legal aspects of making a movie that is familiar with the laws in your specific filming/distribution locations.\nHere is Apple's main trademark page:\nhttp://www.apple.com/legal/trademark/trademark.html\nIn it, you are not really a reseller or advertising the movie itself with the product and trademarked design and logos, so read that portion but don't take it too seriously for the things that don't make sense. Pay attention to how Apple prefers their product to be depicted in photographs.\nAlso - there is a tidbit about mailing Apple directly for product placement.\n\nMarketing or advertising requests (which may include promotions/giveaways, sponsorship, product placement, and partnership requests) may be emailed to wwmarcom@apple.com\nYou might not get free product to use, but you should get a nice package covering their desires and wishes for product placement. Even if you were using Macs in a light that Apple prefers not to see - you might be covered under free speech and artistic expression rights, but I wouldn't expect Apple to spell out that on their pages - so check with your legal team for that if you have concerns.\nGood luck filming your project.\n", "Q: How can I have Spotlight Comments actually get indexed by Spotlight? I'm running the latest OS X (10.8.1). Yesterday I discovered the Spotlight Comments feature, so I went through many of my Applications and put useful comments in that field. For example, on Music Manager.app, I put the spotlight comment \"google music\", since it's Google Music's manager app and I would want that to appear in my search results.\nIt's been at least a day now and I still don't see it when I do a spotlight search for \"google music\". What am I doing wrong? How long does it take for Spotlight to realize applications have comments and index them?\n\nA: The comments should normally show up in Spotlight results after you close an information window in Finder. You can tell Spotlight to reindex directories or files with mdimport, but it should do that automatically most of the time.\nThe Spotlight comments seem to be stored in both .DS_Store files and extended attributes. But if a file is owned by root, Finder doesn't write the comment to an extended attribute, and it won't be seen by Spotlight either.\nIf you use xattr to add the comments, they are picked up by Spotlight, but they aren't shown in Finder's information windows.\nsudo touch test\nsudo xattr -w com.apple.metadata:kMDItemFinderComment somecomment test\n\nIf you open Finder as root, they are saved in both extended attributes and .DS_Store files.\nsudo /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/MacOS/Finder\n\n\nA: The simplest answer, from what I can see, is to make sure that all comments are comma-delimited. So, \"google music\" becomes \"google, music\" (without quotes). I have been using this as a \"tagging\" system for the past few years, and it definitely works just like this. I can't remember where exactly I discovered that commas were necessary, but I had the same problem beforehand, and no problems afterward.\nThe only other hitch I've hit is that occasionally I'll search for a file or folder that I know I've tagged, and it won't show up. This is because sometimes, for no good reason, these comments will just get wiped. I've never figured out how or why this happens, but it doesn't happen often, and it's never caused any serious problems. Regardless, use commas, and that should solve your problem. \n\nA: If comments are not used in Spotlight searches, this symptom is most probably caused by defect file permissions. \nI have followed these instructions (found here) which effectively cured the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new folder, for example in Documents\n\n*Move the problem app into this folder\n\n*Select the app, then, from the menu, select File > Get Info (or right-click, then select Get Info)\n\n*You will probably have to unlock the dialog by clicking on the lock symbol in the lower right and entering your credentials\n\n*Click on the gear icon in the lower left, then select Apply to enclosed items... (this step performs the actual repair of the app's file permissions)\n\n*Move the app back to the applications folder\n\n*The keywords in the comments will immediately take effect!\n\n\n\nNotes \nThere are certainly alternative ways to correct the defect file permissions, like for example using Apple's Disk Utility. However, Apple claims that starting with macOS Sierra, file permissions are automatically protected by the OS, and need not be repaired any more. This is either not true in all cases, or the defect permissions may be a legacy from upgrading to macOS Sierra from an earlier OS X version.\nHowever, the above solution is definitely quicker than running a full disk repair.\n", "Q: AppleShowAllFiles does not show hidden files I use OS X 10.8, I type the following\ndefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles YES\nkillall Finder\n\nbut still I cannot see any hidden files like .bash_history, .Trash, .cups, .gem etc. in user directory.\n\nA: The bundle identifier is com.apple.finder in lowercase.\ndefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles YES would also write the setting as a string, but it doesn't usually matter though.\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool true\nosascript -e 'quit app \"Finder\"'\n\n\nA: Please use defaults read com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles to read current status.\nNote that it's different to use command with root user (e.g. sudo) or standard user and use com.apple.finder with Finder in lowercase.\nFor Hide hidden files\nuse defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles 0 from current user terminal window not using sudo or sudo su command.\nFor Show hidden files \nuse defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles 1\nThen relaunch Finder using killall Finder\nTested on OS X 10.8.4.\n\nA: I had this problem. I tried Lauri's solution, and had intermittent success. I found that my particular problem was that I was sometimes running the command from root. Running it from standard permissions proved consistently successful, where running it from root proved consistently unsuccessful.\n\nA: I have 2 Macs, both running 10.8.3.  I was able to use the\n defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles YES\n\nsuggestion on my Mac Mini with success, but it did not work on the macbook pro no matter how many times (or which method I used) to restart Finder.  When I used the \"boolean\" method, it worked for the macbook the first time.  The macbook is a 2010 unit, and the mini from 2012, but all that should be only in the OS, and not related to hardware.  very odd, but thanks very much for posting both options.  I was beginning to drive myself crazy trying to see hidden files on the laptop.  I even used \"sudo\" for the \"AppleShowAllFiles\" method, thinking it was a permissions thing, but that did not help.\n\nA: Use the -boolean option:\ndefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles -boolean TRUE\nkillall Finder\n\nYES is not automatically interpreted as a boolean, but as a string.\n", "Q: How can I keep Java 7 up to date? As far as I understood Apple provides only Java 6 for Mountain Lion.\nHere I found how to install and use Java 7.\nHowever I suppose that by installing Oracle Java it will not be update by means of the Mac App Store. How can I be sure that Oracle Java is always up to date, even better automatically (at least with a notification of \"ready to update\")?\n\nA: You may not have noticed it, but Oracle Java 7 installs a new item in System Preferences with a feature that automatically checks for updates by default, and prompts you to install them. Thus, this is taken care of.\n\n\n", "Q: Why is '/opt' hidden, and what can I do to unhide it? On my ML MBP, '/opt' is somehow 'hidden'. In the finder, it shows in gray. In various applications, it's invisible from a file selection dialog box. Get Info and ls -l show now flags that corresponds to this behavior. Is there any way to turn it off?\n\nA: Out of the box, there is no /opt file delivered by OS X.\nThis command will show the hidden status of files in root ls -lO / with O being the capital letter, not zero. The chflags command can be used to toggle the hidden flag if needed.\nDepending on how you got /opt created, you may or may not have issues with the permissions changing again - most tools leave things alone with respect to filesystem flags as long as the read/write/execute permissions are not removed.\n", "Q: Is there a way to limit the size of the disk swap file in Mac OS X? It seems to be that in OS X, whenever you are out of ram the system happily swaps to disk. This easily becomes an disaster due to the fact that the swapped out memory eventually fills my drive. On my Macbook Air with 2GB ram and 64GB disk this is a major problem.\nIn order to solve this I've created a crontab running a purge-command every 10:th minute. It minimizes the swap from growing and also makes the system more responsive whenever the system is swapping. I've tried to disable swap but it's far to unreliable.\nCan you configure this behavior? Is there a better solution?\n\n$crontab -e\n*/10 * * * * purge\n\n\nA: Yes you can configure the dynamic_pager, but for most it is simpler to just disable it and see which program crashes due to the inevitable out of memory errors.\nWhy would I disable swap file in Mac OS X?\nPay attention to programs that implement their own virtual memory / cache / paging systems like virtualization and the Adobe Suite in case you have inadvertently tuned them to use more RAM than is available on the system. They tend to be first on my investigation list when I see a mac with runaway swap allocation on the filesystem.\n", "Q: Reminders application does not open in Mountain Lion When I click on the Reminders icon in the dock it will not open.  \nThe console logs only one entry:\n12/11/12 11:34:46,016 Reminders[6984]: NSConcreteMutableAttributedString addAttribute:value:range:: nil value\n\nDoes anyone have insight to this?  Is it hiding?\n\nA: I had the same issue.  Try going to system preferences iCloud.  Turn off reminders off, press delete reminders from mac, then turn reminders back on and hit merge reminders from iCloud.  This solved my issue.  \nPrior to this a did a system restore on the OS and it didn't do a thing still couldn't open reminders.  \n\nA: I tried the solution proposed by rob above but it only worked temporarily. As soon as I re-launched the app it was not working anymore.\nI eventually solved the problem this way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the Reminders app on OS X is closed\n\n*Open the Reminders app on http://icloud.com\n\n*Create a new reminders list\n\n*Delete the default reminders list\n\n\nA: Reminders just stopped working for me in OS X 10.9. I opened it from the dock. The menu opens but no window. \nI tried disabling reminders in my iCloud setting, then reactivating and syncing with iCloud. The window opened but without the sidebar; I could not see my lists. Weird.\nSo I went to /Library/Containers/com.apple.reminders/ and used Time Machine to restore this folder. \nReminders now works again. How did this happen? Reminders has gotten better but it still has a few bugs. It doesn't always sync properly; now it stopped working altogether. Hmmm. \n", "Q: Turn off internal display without closing lid I learned that a MacBook Air's built-in screen turns off when I close the lid so I can continue working on an external display set to be primary. But the MacBook Air has a heat system that requires it to be open to work properly. Heat accumulates faster when it is in clamshell mode.\nIs there any way to turn off just the built-in screen without closing the lid but keep the external display active?\n\nA: Run sudo nvram boot-args=iog=0x0 and restart. It restores the behavior on 10.6 and earlier where the internal display is not turned back on if the lid is opened in clamshell mode.\nYou can delete the variable with sudo nvram -d boot-args.\nOther related questions here and at Super User.\n\nA: My preference for this is to use a very small magnet.\nAs i proposed here, you can fool the Mac into thinking that the lid is closed by placing a very weak magnet on the sensor that is normally triggered when you close the lid.\nThe exact position of that sensor varies, but it should be somewhere at the very edge of the laptop, just behind the trackpad.\nOf course you must be extremely careful bringing magnets near computers, but if you use one that is weak enough and small enough, you should be able to reproduce the effect of the magnet that is currently in the display portion of your laptop.\nThis uses the Apple laptop's normal mechanism to determine whether the lid is closed.. No mucking about in NVRAM, no rebooting with the lid closed, etc...\nFinally, it must be noted that all Apple laptops are designed to be able to function in clamshell mode (and have been since the PowerBook Duo), as long as you do not obstruct the cooling intake and exhaust areas.\n", "Q: How can I automatically disable WiFi when I connect to an Ethernet network? I would like my WiFi to automatically disconnect when I plug an Ethernet cable into my Mac. How would I go about this?\n\nA: If you have somehow modified the default service ordering, you can set it again in the network tab using the gear.\nThis makes the Wi-Fi inactive for internet routing whenever you connect the cable. What you ask is scriptable if you know some programming, but there isn't a simple trigger to actually turn the Wi-Fi radio off at the user level of the OS.\n\nA: This script on MacOSXHints worked for me up until installing Mavericks (10.9.0) on a new Late 2013 MBP retina 15\" - but it did work quite well on my previous two non-retina MBPs before that.\nNote that you may need to edit the script to use your correct interface numbers (ie en1).\n", "Q: Is the \"Cellar\" folder only used for Homebrew? Is the \"Cellar\" folder only used for Homebrew? If I am not using Homebrew, I can safely remove it?\n\nA: Yes. You can remove Cellar directory.\n\nA: According to its installation instructions, Java Service Wrapper is also using a Cellar directory:\n/opt/local/Cellar/wrapper\n\nbut it is distinct from the Homebrew Cellar which is in\n/opt/homebrew/Cellar\n\nfor Apple Silicon mac and\n/usr/local/Cellar\n\nfor Intel mac.\n\nA: The script for uninstalling Homebrew removes it completely, so it's probably safe to remove it.\nhttps://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/FAQ\n\nHow do I uninstall Homebrew?\nIf you installed to /usr/local then you can use the script in this gist to uninstall — it will only remove Homebrew and the stuff Homebrew installed leaving anything else in /usr/local alone.\nProvided you haven’t put anything else in Homebrew’s prefix (brew --prefix), you can generally just rm -rf that directory. This is because Homebrew won’t touch files outside its prefix.\n\n", "Q: mount is adding a quarantine flag, causing: /bin/bash: bad interpreter: Operation not permitted - but not the usual suspects OK, I'm having a similar problem to: -bash: Applications/mvim: /bin/sh: bad interpreter: Operation not permitted - but it's not the same problem.

I'll need to later be able to control it from outside the network. I already use Apple Remote Desktop to control other Macs on my network, but i don't know how to penetrate the remote network to get to her computer.\nWhat do I have to do to get her router to let me connect to it? I don't know what type of router she has, but if need be I will be installing an Airport Express or Extreme instead.\n\nA: Without VPN-Functionality on the Router you have to rely on Software like 'LogMeIn' or 'Teamviewer' to access you Machine from outside your Home-Network.\nAs an alternative to LogmeIn you can use \"Teamviewer\". You have to install 'Teamviwer Host' on the Machines you want to control from outside and the regular 'Teamviwer' on your Machine.\n\nA: Your best bet is LogMeIn. It utilises NAT bypassing techniques so you can be assured of reliability. It also uses a lot less bandwidth than VNC or Remote Desktop. \nConfession: I love LogMeIn!\n", "Q: External hard drive frequently ejects itself when using Aperture I have a brand new external hard drive which frequently ejects itself on a regular basis (every ~20 minutes or so), seemingly only when I have Aperture open (my Aperture library is located on the external hard drive). The disk works perfectly fine for long periods of time when I am not using Aperture.\nI have read many places online that this could be related to disk inactivity sleep, disk journaling, Spotlight indexing, faulty Firewire cables, faulty Firewire ports, hard drives which are about to die, etc. However, the disk seems to work perfectly fine when I am not using it for Aperture and none of the many forum threads I have found have pointed me in the right direction.\nDoes anyone have any ideas on how to identify and fix this issue?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: A book was just released by SCSC called \"Hard Drive Troubleshooting,\" which mentions disk ejection in numerous places. The book is free and you can get it by going to:\nhttp://www.scsc-online.com\nGo to the downloads section and click on the book to download it.\nI would think that if the drive is failing over a specific region, the disk will issue I/O errors and MAY timeout causing the system to think the drive is no longer connected. I believe the book mentions something like a 60 second timeout. To me, that would sound either like bad sectors on the drive OR corrupt data on the drive that the system can't make sense of. For example, if your file xyz.dat is either corrupt or unreadable and it just happens to be read by Aperture (and ONLY Aperature) then the problem would occur only when Aperture in use.\nIf you haven't tried Disk Utility on the drive to verify/repair it, I would do so.\n...If you're using Mountain Lion, all bets are off.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: After long conversations with Apple tech support and also LaCie tech support, we managed to figure out what the issue was. I figured I would add it here, for completeness sake, in case anyone else is experiencing the same issue.\nBasically, the external hard drive was powered through the Firewire port; it didn't have an external power source. The problem was that I was trying to import a lot of pictures (around 20 thousand .raw format images) into an Aperture library on the external hard drive, from the external hard drive itself (the pictures were also located on the same drive). This would cause the device to not have enough power, which would force it to \"eject\" itself.\nAfter moving the pictures onto a different hard drive and then importing them from there, I no longer experienced this problem. Just make sure the pictures you are trying to import and the Aperture library live on different hard drives, basically.\n\nA: I think what you're really saying is that when the LaCie drive is under load, it can't handle it and the power supply faults, or the Mac can't supply the amount of power it needs to the unit over a sustained period of time. This is either, IMHO, not a good design on the part of one or the other, or a faulty unit, on the part of one or the other. That simply shouldn't happen. I'd be willing to bet that one or the other is faulty. You might be able to get some power consumption specs from Apple regarding how much power the FireWire port is capable of delivering, vs. how much your LaCie is capable of consuming.\nI think you should list the drive model number to see if others are running into the same problem. Power supplies have thermal shutdown circuitry that kicks in if they detect overheating, which is typically due to current load (as in too much load). Unfortunately, the thermal sensors have high variation and aren't really that reliable. Whether it's on the Mac or the LaCie is something I can't determine, after all I have no access to your units.\n", "Q: OS X: fsck_hfs unable to fix volume directory count I'm running fsck_hfs on a very large volume.

It even remembers the rotation if you rotate your device.\nAnd even better, if you activate the compass, and then move away from your position, it remembers the rotation (previously when you moved away, it rotated back to north being up, which was very annoying).  \n\nA: You don't have to enter your password any longer when updating an app you've already bought and installed.\n\nA: PRIVACY\nNow we have a better control over application that require personal data!\nWith the privacy field on \"Settings\", we can see which application have access to your contacts, your calendar, your photos, your bluetooth,  and disable this access directly from \"Settings -> Privacy\".\n(By my point of view this is very important!)\n\nA: There is a new French keyboard setup under Settings > General > Keyboard > Keyboard: Accented AZERTY.\nThis layout adds an extra context-sensitive key between N and backspace. It will switch between an apostrophe and various accents depending on the first letter to the left of the input cursor:\n \n\nA: Safari on iPad now lets you open up to 24 tabs, up from 8 previously. The iPhone is still limited to 8, sadly ;(\nAlso, the + button for opening a blank tab becomes disabled once you reach the limit on both iPhone and iPad, although you can still lose tabs inadvertently by opening links in new tabs after reaching the limit.\n\nA: In iOS 5, Apple added a \"Store\" button to the upper-left of the Music app. It used to drive me nuts because I'd tap it as I was backing out of a long stack of views (for example, traversing back from now playing, to artist's album list, to the artist list).\nIn iOS 6, a slight delay has been added to that button. If you back up through the stack in 6, the first tap on the Store button no longer activates it.\n\nA: Opening a new tab in iPad's Safari now focuses the URL Bar instead of the Search bar.\n\nA: Alarms can now make use of songs not just built in tones. Edit your alarm and select sound and then pick a song.\n\nA: Tap and hold the \"New Message\" button inside Mail to open the Drafts folder.\n\nA: Receiving iMessages sent to your phone number on multiple devices.\nI know this has been raved about but it is tricky to configure and took me a while to figure out.\nSteps to get this working:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable and then re-enable iMessage on your phone (this triggers the registration process with Apple servers). Done in Settings -> Messages\n\n*Open Messages in Settings on other iOS devices and disable and then re-enable. This will add your phone number to the list. You need to then select it (a tick mark appears next to it). You will now receive messages on this device. There is also a section to choose to send from an address or number lower on the screen.\n\n*On OS X devices (10.8.2), open Messages and choose Preferences (from Messages menu) and then choose Accounts. You will now see your number and can select to receive messages on that device.\n\n\nWhen you do this, you will get notifications on the other devices confirming that is enabled.\n\nA: iOS 6 Features I Didn’t Know About by Chad Williams via bmike♦\n\nMetallic sliders across the OS now have a subtle reflection effect\n  that is created with the accelerometer.\n\n\n\nA: Reference Dictionaries for French, German, and Spanish (in addition to the one for Chinese mentioned in Apple's \"new features\" list).\nThese could be downloaded when I tapped the \"define\" option for a selected word in those languages. \n\nA: The animation in an app does not stop when double-pressing the home button. For example, go to the messages app, scroll in a long conversation and double-tap the home button.\n\nA: Improved accessibility features\niOS 6 gains some really neat features concerning accessibility.\nFor example, there is the all new Guided Access feature which allows you to prohibit people from leaving a specific app or even from using certain interface areas. It can also disable sleeping the screen and motion controls (like rotation and shaking).\n\nAlso, Apple added the ability to adjust the speed with which you have to double- or triple- click the home button.\n\n\nA: Do not disturb\n\nYou can use the Do Not Disturb setting while your iOS device is locked to silence calls, alerts, and notifications.\n\nThe setting is located at Settings > Notifications > Do Not Disturb.\nAlso very handy as it will silence a call but if the same person rings back within three minutes it wont silence it.\n\nA: Searching for an app in Spotlight reveals which folder the app is located in.\n\nA: Uploading images on Safari makes it easier to share images on websites that don't have apps.\n\nA: Newly downloaded apps have a \"new\" label on the home screen.\n\n\nA: The Settings icon no longer has\nRAZOR BLADE EDGES!\n\n\nA: Opt Out of Advertising Tracking\nSettings > General > About > Advertising allows you to turn off ad tracking. Details in the photo below.\n\n\nA: Dictionary in the Cloud\nNow, iCloud syncs your weird words across all of your devices without giving suggestions.\n\nA: New emojis in the emojis keyboard!\n\n\nA: Data Detectors finally separate a phone extension [416.555.5555 x101] and provide a button prompt to \"DIAL [EXTENSION]\" after the initial number is dialed.\n\nPreviously it would simply 'dial' all of the numbers lumped together [4165555555101].\n\nA: 15-second forward & rewind buttons in lock screen during podcast playback\nWhich replace previous and next track buttons in iOS 5 and prior.\n\nRegular songs still have next & previous track buttons. It used to be too easy to accidentally push next or previous track while trying to pause a long podcast, causing you to completely lose your place. This change both solves that problem and offers a very handy quick-rewind option.\n\nA: Add images and video to emails from within the Mail app\nTap in the body of an email you're writing and you'll get the standard \"Select | Select All | Paste\" options, but tap the right arrow and you get a new one: Insert Photo or Video.\n\nA: When you are viewing a location's details in Maps the 'distance' ticks up/down as you get closer/further, I really love this.\n\nA: Apple's new iOS 6 Maps support automatic offline use for a wide area\n\nVector maps in iOS 6 are so efficient that Apple can cache a very large surrounding area for offline browsing and GPS navigation under Airplane Mode or when traveling outside of data coverage.\n\nMap data cache is available even after power cycling. Hybrid and 3D building model are cached.\n\nA: Landscape maps\nMaps.app on iPhone now supports landscape orientation.\n\nA: Pull to refresh in Mail.app\nMail now has pull to refresh  (like Twitter, Facebook, etc.).  This is also now a standard control that third party developers can use.  So far I've only seen this new \"native\" pull to refresh in Lumatics City Maps but I'm sure it'll be everywhere soon enough.\n\nA: Signature by mail account\nYou can now set a signature per mail account. Before it was a signature for all accounts set on iOS.\nSet signatures in Settings > Mail, Contacts and Calendar > Signature.\n\nA: Browser history:\nHold down the back/forward button to see a list of pages you can select to go back to.\n(This was previously only available on the iPad, but has now been added to the iPhone and iPod touch.)\n\nA: iPad App Store screenshots can now be clicked and seen in full screen \"slideshow\" mode.\nThey're definitely not Retina resolution, but still a much better indication what the app looks like on the screen.\n\n\nA: Acknowledging (swiping) a Missed Call through its Notification in a Locked Screen will now remove it from the Notifications.\n\nA: App Store experience redesign. Most notably, when you install or update an application the App Store App no longer closes but instead show the download/installation progress inside the store (below the icon). \n\nA: Email accounts in the mail app can now be sorted in the Mailbox view.\n\nA: Panorama Panning Direction\nDon't like the default left to right panning direction in Camera.app's new Panorama function? Just tap the arrow and it will change from right to left!\nWhen the app quits, the direction defaults back to left to right.\nJust happened to hit the arrow yesterday by accident and saw the change. A nice feature, but for the life of me I can't figure out why it is there, other than to help the dyslexic among us (and I am one of them, so no flames, please)!\n\nA: The clock app on iPad 3. I had no idea it was coming...\n\nA: It is now possible to add an Internet link to your Reading List straight from Mail. You no longer have to open the link in Safari before saving it to your Reading List.\nMore globally, this is made possible by the OS-wide Reading List API, enabling any app to interact with the Reading List.\n\nA: Open in.... for documents is no longer limited to the last 10 suitable apps. That is, if one taps and holds a PDF mail attachment, for example, all the apps capable of opening the PDF are presented for selection (may need to swipe to second screen, but they are all there).\n\nA: Delete own Shared Photostream comments\nYou can delete shared Photostream comments by tapping and holding on your own comment until the Copy | Delete options appear. The option to \"Delete\" only appears on comments you have made.\nThis can be very helpful if you happen to mistype, or if you say something you later wish you hadn't.\n\nA: Rearrange mailboxes. I receive email from about 8 different email addresses and now you can rearrange the order in which they appear.\nFrom the Mailbox Screen, select Edit in top right hand corner of the panel. The three transparent grey lines that indicate moving/rearranging appear. Drag and drop accordingly.\n", "Q: Delete TV episode from iTunes from iPhone without computer How do I delete a TV episode off of my iPhone that I downloaded from iTunes. I don't want it to stay in my iTunes and I don't have a computer. So please what do I do? It has filled almost all the space on my phone.\n\nA: Swap from right to left on the title of the episode and magically*, a Delete button will appear on the right hand side. You just have to tap on that Delete.\n*:-)\n", "Q: \"Self Destruct\" script to remove certain directories and/or applications Let's say your work situation isn't going so well, and you suspect the end is near. \nHow would you prepare a script (or similar) to remove your personal files and applications from your work computer (OSX Lion) if you only had a few minutes to gather your things and leave the building? Of course, you want to leave the machine functional, and all your work files intact, because the situation is bad but you aren't a jerk. \n\nA: *\n\n*Follow this guide to create a simple file path copier.\n\n*Open a new document in TextWrangler. Paste in the following:\n#!/bin/sh\nrm -rf \n\nNote the space after rm -rf.\n\n*Open Finder, go to a file, press the keyboard shortcut you assigned in step 1, then press ⌘ cmd + V in TextWrangler.\n\n*Do this for all the files you want deleted. Make sure there is a space between two file paths and not an enter. That means all the file paths will be on the same line. Also, if there are any spaces in the file path, you need to enclose the path in quotes ('/path/with a space' or \"/path/ with a space\").\n\n*Save the file on the Desktop with the name anything.sh. Don’t check any other options while saving.\n\n*Make the script executable by typing in Terminal sudo chmod 755 ~/Desktop/anything.sh.\n\n*When D-Day comes, right click on the file, select Open With → Other…. Open the Applications → Utilities folder, in the Enable: field, select “All Applications.”\n\n*Double click on Terminal. \n\n*The script will finish its job in a few minutes.\nAlternatively, you can open the file in Text Wrangler and copy and paste the contents in Terminal. This eliminates steps 6 and 7.\n", "Q: Can't get rid of incomplete download bar underneath dock icon My Downloads folder in my dock has been showing a download/progress bar at 50% since yesterday. There aren't any half-complete files in my Download folder, Google Chrome isn't awaiting any action to accept or discard an upcoming download nor am I copying anything into that folder.\nHere's a screenshot of my dock:\n\nThe only files in my Downloads folder are OS X generated dotfiles:\n➜  ~ ls -A Downloads \n.DS_Store  .localized\n\nA few things that I tried to fix the problem (unsuccessfully):\n\n\n*\n\n*killall Dock\n\n*repairing permissions\n\n*rebooting\n\n*removing the icon from the dock and putting it back in\n\n*downloading something to see if the new progress would overwrite the problem\n\n\nHow do I get rid of this progress bar that seemingly does nothing but exist?\nI'm using Mac OS X 10.8.1 on a MacBook Pro 9,1.\n\nA: The same happened to me also. Just found out the most simplest of tricks. Just move it anywhere in the dock and the bar disappears. \n\nA: you don't need to remove/delete the Downloads folder from the dock and re add it, just move it in a new position and the re position it to the old one\n\nA: I removed the folder from the dock and dropped it back on there and it was gone :)\n\nA: Alright some new information:\nIt just happened again. I was downloading a MacRuby nightly and my Downloads folder was bouncing more than usually. Looking into the folder I see one of my previous downloads, SENotifier, back in there. It's only 361 KB and the progress bar is at the very beginning.\nHere's a screenshot of the Downloads folder.\nClicking on the X doesn't cancel the action (whatever action it's executing) and deleting the file doesn't do anything either, except delete the file, but the problem with the progress bar still remains.\nAt this point I have to mention that I seem to have deleted the incomplete files yesterday without realizing it. That's why I hadn't included in the initial question. I forgot that I did that.\nThe solution to my problem:\nAfter a little searching I found out it's a new bug with Chrome Version 23.0.1270.0 dev.\nSo, that explains that.\n\nA: I had the same issue. Restarting Chrome did the trick.\n\nA: I went to Chrome -> Downloads and clicked Clear all\nTakes care of it for now.\n\nA: This is a known bug in Yosemite (and I'm pretty sure it occurred in Mavericks, too). I see it quite often. There are a few Terminal command/logout solutions I've read, but the above suggestions of removing the folder from the Dock and putting it back on will do the trick, and is the fastest solution.  \n\nA: None of the other solutions would solve this for me. The odd part about my issue (that others may or may not have experienced) is that the bar had appeared under the downloads folder yet if I opened different apps the bar would remain in place instead of staying centered under the downloads folder. \nWhat solved it for me was running killall Dock in Terminal. \n\nA: Its not only Chrome - I use Safari with OS Yosemite and had the same problem. All I did was remove/delete the Downloads folder from the dock then re added it.\nJob done.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: Maybe late, but I made a solution. Download free: Restart FinderDock\n", "Q: Sshfs or its substitute in Apple products? I instructs my Apple friend to get Sshfs, i.e. to mount an outside target, to home -directory but he cannot find sshfs for Mac. Dose there exist some substitute or some Apple-compiled version for Sshfs? If it exists, how can my friend install it?\n\nA: You can get sshfs with MacPorts. Just download macports and run\nsudo port install sshfs\n\nin a terminal window.\n\nA: Harald suggested a package-installer but some alerts: package-installers such as MacPorts and Homebrew have problems such as old packages and broken packages. For example, the Homebrew's Sshfs is broken at the time of writing. Examples of package-installers include MacPorts and  Homebrew.\nIn the case of sshfs the problem is that it relies on MacFuse/osxfuse which is not now open source so can't be built on Macports and Homebrew has removed the ports from core\nIt is better to find the newest installation so you won't face odd errors. For example, the Sshfs -development files are here and the packages here.\n\nA: ABSOLUTELY!!! You don't need MacPorts, or Homebrew, or Cocoa.\nMacFuse + MacFusion will do it. \nIf you want to mount an OS X drive through SSHFS from another computer on the network, you only need to enable Remote Login on OS X.\n", "Q: Has there been an end date established for the Maps app on iOS less than iOS 6? It has been reported that the contract between Google and Apple to supply maps for iOS has not been renewed (or perhaps already has or is about to expire). Furthermore, it's clear that Google charges significant amounts of money for businesses like Apple to use the maps API so it's not clear to me that this data feed can continue to older OS indefinitely.\nHas anyone seen a credible announcement if and/or when the map data might stop working for people that choose to stuck with iOS 3, 4 and/or 5 and the Google-data-fed integrated iOS mapping app? (And by choose, I mean the devices are not even supported on iOS 6 so the choice is more to buy new hardware or keep running what you have.)\nI'm not looking for an alternative (like running Google Maps on iOS 5.1) - just an announced or a real end date of the map tile feed to iOS.\n\nA: As long as you do not upgrade to iOS 6, you will get to keep the app forever. As for the API not working any more, since Apple used the official API any changes Google makes that would break the old Maps app will also break millions of other apps on many platforms. There is a possibility that Google could revoke Apple's API key, but I seriously doubt that will ever happen.\n\nA: As numerous news reports said, \"if you stay on iOS 5, you can keep Google Maps on your iPhone\". And now there's also the Google Maps standalone app for iOS 5.1/6.\n", "Q: Syncing contacts with iCloud So I just upgraded to iOS 6 and have two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible that my updated contacts (using Facebook integration) will uploaded to the cloud so the same info appearing on iPhone will be available on OS X contacts?\n\n*On any contact in iPhone, when I tap on the Facebook category, it opens my Lloyds bank app. Why?\nA clarification on the first question: many of the contacts imported from Facebook were already in my iPhone although with less info (usually just the phone number). Instead of combining the info, I get two contacts with same name and different set of info. What I want is have them combined on iCloud. If I manually use \"Link cards\" they will be displayed as one, although changes are not reflected on iCloud.\n\nA: For part 2, I've had the same issue. I thought I'd fixed it by deleting the Lloyds app. I checked my contacts and it took me straight to Facebook. I then reinstalled the Lloyds app, however the issue of the Lloyds bank app stealing the contact reference when they were accessed returned.\nToday, after installing the updates for both Facebook and the Lloyds apps has solved the part two problem. \n", "Q: How to determine if there are public transit apps for your region? In iOS 6, the built-in Maps application no longer provides public transportation information.  Instead, it kicks you to 3rd party apps that provide that functionality.  I'm currently running iOS 5, and won't update until I know there's a way to easily look up bus routes under iOS 6.  How can I determine if there are 3rd party transit apps that cover my region?\nI'm being deliberately vague on the region I'm living in, as I want a generic answer that will be useful to public transit users in all regions.\n\nA: This question is outdated as Apple Maps (iOS 10) now supports transit but an alternative to Apple Maps is Google Maps which in my experience is the best way to find transit to get from A to B but I encourage you to compare both based on where you live.\n\nA: I'm not sure what generic answer will apply here, other than to search the App Store for a term like \"<my city name> + transit\"... Now, there are several vectors for searching the App Store: directly, through Google, or through apps and sites like AppShopper that aggregate that data. \nOne of those latter options might provide a specific search or list of transit apps for various regions, but I don't know of any off-hand.\nThat said, selecting Transit directions in the iOS 6 Maps app apparently brings up this screen (source):\n\nWhich may or may not search intelligently for applicable apps under the From the App Store section. Unfortunately, I can't test this yet - I'll do so tomorrow, after I've installed iOS 6.\n", "Q: Do iOS 6 maps include public transit information and routing? Lately I'm spending a lot of time in London, even though I'm not British.\nI rely heavily on the iPhone Google-based maps for transit information, I tell it where I need to get to, and it recommends a bus, tube, etc.\nDoes iOS6's new Maps app still have this feature? I've read in a few places that it doesn't, but I can't believe Apple would break such important functionality with a new iOS version.\nIf it doesn't, is there any way to get the old Google maps in iOS6?\n\nA: As of right now, no, the new Maps app lacks transit directions. Instead, when you select Public Transit as your travel mode, it pops up a list of installed (or available from the App Store) apps that can provide local transit directions.\nAnd, as of right now, no, there is no Google Maps app in the App Store (though you can still use Google Maps effectively from Mobile Safari). \nThere not much to do but conjecture as to why the Apple-made Maps app doesn't include transit. From Dan Moren's excellent iOS 6 review at MacWorld:\n\nThis is an odd solution for Apple, which usually prides itself on\n  providing a consistent experience. But I suspect that handling public\n  transit directions simply wasn’t an option for Apple at this point,\n  and if it came down to offering a third-party experience versus no\n  feature at all, Apple opted to not leave its users completely\n  high-and-dry.\n\n", "Q: How to rename multiple files at once?

From their website:\n\n\nA: I like user933531's answer, but if you'd like a GUI, the A Better Finder Rename app is really good.

My Apple friends says that they cannot compile LaTeX.

I have periodically noticed that my display has been a bit dim, and have brought it up to maximum brightness... only later to find that my display was about halfway on brightness. I can't rule out a stray keystroke, but it seems to be several notches down a lot more often than I would accidentally hit F1. As far as I can tell this happens when the computer remains on and I remain logged on.\nEspecially when operating on battery power, does Mountain Lion dim the display automatically? Is there a way to turn off or circumvent this?\n\nA: When you go from mains power to battery, OS X decreases display brightness. (It should go back to normal brightness when you reconnect to mains power.)\nTo turn this off, go to System Preferences > Energy Saver, choose the Battery tab, and un-check \"Slightly dim the display when using this power source\".\nThe display can also change brightness because it senses a change in ambient brightness. To turn this off, go to System Preferences > Displays, find the window on the display you want to change this setting on, go to the Displays tab, and un-check \"Automatically adjust brightness\".\n", "Q: How to receive iMessages sent to the iPhone on Mountain Lion I've just upgraded to iOS 6 and Mountain Lion 10.8.2\nSince it should be one of the new features, I've successfully set up my iPhone and my iPad to receive iMessages, so that I can now read on the iPad what a friend of mine is writing to me on my phone number.\nOn iMessage I've set up the same, but adding my phone number to the list of \"addresses\" to receive from.

I suddenly noticed that my computer's battery would be at a different level when I woke it up than it was when I closed the lid to put it to sleep.  After leaving it on a table next to my bed a few times, I realized that my computer was randomly waking up (evidenced by the Apple logo lighting up) when it was laying on a flat, level surface with nothing on top of it or anything touching it.  I tried switching the settings so that I have to click the \"sleep\" option in the menu rather than relying on it to automatically go to sleep when the lid is closed, but the problem persists.  Why won't my Macbook stay asleep?\n\nA: One possible cause is that the sensor to detect lid opening can trigger by mistake. If so, you can disable it by going into Terminal.app and typing:\nsudo pmset -a lidwake 0\n\nNote that this means the Mac will no longer automatically wake when you open it. Instead you would need a key press or mouse click to wake.\n\nA: What network sharing settings do you have enabled? I found that enabled internet, file or printer sharing will prevent full sleep.\n", "Q: Can't pair apple wireless keyboard Keyboard: Apple Wireless Keyboard (model number MC184LL/B)\nSystem: Macbook Pro Early 2011 running OS X 10.8\nThe keyboard gets detected and when I try to pair it, the system asks to enter some numbers through the keyboard. \nHowever when I press the key (on the wireless keyboard) nothing happens, the only key that seems to work (i.e. to move to the next key in the code) is 0. I can also press enter to confirm but it always fails (since the only code I can enter is 0000...0). \nI've also tried pairing from the bluetooth preference and changing the passcode option. However this won't work either. \nAny ideas? The keyboard was paired with another MacBook Pro (I don't have access to it anymore). Is there any method to 'reset' the keyboard to factory settings?\n\nA: If only one number key is working, it sounds like a hardware issue. My brother had a wireless keyboard that flaked out and only certain keys functioned (although in his case it was from a liquid spill).\nDo you have any other Bluetooth-capable device to test with? Any iOS device can pair with the keyboard to test it.\n\nA: For posterity, some troubleshooting on this exact same problem...\nAfter reading the question and answer here I was ready to throw the keyboard in the trash, but then thought that if two people have such an odd failure maybe its just a bug that one can work around.\nSo, after being unable to type anything but 0 and enter and watching the connection attempt fail, I clicked a button on the failure screen that allowed me to then choose an alternate passkey. It was pre-populated with 0000. I played around with connecting again but the enter key would not highlight until I typed eight zeros instead of four. I tried a few times and then noticed for whatever reason the custom setting was back to eight random digits.\nI decided to start over, clearing out the list of bluetooth devices. On my next attempt, I typed 00000000 and enter for the passkey and waited for the failure. I then selected the custom passkey setting which was now populated as 0000. I reattempted and was asked to type 0000. I did so, and even though the screen did not show I could hit enter - presumably because it wanted four more digits - I hit enter anyway. And it paired.\nI am typing this with that very keyboard. Sounds great. Except this: the keys 1 through 9 still do not work, nor do the symbols on those keys when holding shift. Note I copied/pasted the one and nine digit from elsewhere into this answer :-)\nSo sad.\n\nA: I had the same problem: an Apple Bluetooth Keyboard would not pair with an iMac after having been paired with a MacBook Pro. The Bluetooth pairing dialog would appear with a 6-digit code, but the only key that worked was Return/Enter.\nResolved by resetting the firmware as explained by Dave Meehan in How to Reset an Apple Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard, Mouse or Trackpad (Troubleshooting Pairing and Other Common Problems):\n\n\n*\n\n*Switch off the keyboard by holding down the power button for at least 3 seconds\n\n*Click the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar\n\n*Click on \"Set Up Bluetooth Device\" or \"Open Bluetooth Preferences\"\n\n*Turn on the keyboard by holding down the power button, BUT DO NOT LET GO OF THE POWER BUTTON. It must be kept held down through the entire process.\n\n*The Setup Assistant will find the keyboard, so click the name of the keyboard, and then click on \"Continue\". Make sure you are still holding the power button down.\n\n*You will be prompted for the Pairing Code. You can now release the power button, type the pairing code on the keyboard and then press return. There will be a slight delay whilst the pairing completes (a few seconds)\n\n*The keyboard will now be Paired, and should work as expected (if it produces wrong characters for keypresses you may have the wrong language setting on your Mac, see below).\n\n\nA: I had the same problem spent 4 hour nothing work so I ran my finger back and forth about 10 times across the numbers changed the batteries and I am typing this on that keyboard know connected to iMac numbers are working but not always. crazy don't know why the numbers worked to enter passkey but it did for what it's worth hope this helps \n", "Q: Why is an un-deletable Springboard app on my screen after the iOS 6 upgrade? I just updated to iOS 6 and I have this springboard app that I cannot delete. I've tried restarting, and opening the app just ends up in it closing itself. Any advice?\nBy the way, I am using an iPod Touch 4 that has never been jailbroken.\n\n\nA: Before going through a hard reset, it might be worth doing a soft reset.\nTo do that, press the Power & Home buttons simultaneously until the iPod shuts down by itself. Release the buttons and power it back on.\nThis might take care of the issue. Otherwise, just restore it using iTunes and if you have no valuable data to lose, choose the \"Setup Up As New Phone\" option.\n", "Q: What is \"automatic movie mode\" One of the new features listed in the iOS 6 release notes is\n\n\n*\n\n*automatic movie mode for improved video sound quality\n\n\nWhat does this feature do?\n\nA: The new feature analyses the video that you are currently watching and it adjusts the Equalizer automatically so that the sound quality is optimal for the current movie scene.\nAnyway many people think it's intrusive and that it actually decreases sounds quality. Others like it.\nIt's up to you I think.\n", "Q: Is there a karaoke trainer for OS X?  is there an easy-to-use karaoke training software for Mac OS X?\nMy point is, I select the .kar file (or the vocals-only .mp3) and I sing against, then I listen to what I've actually sang?\nFWIW, I'm no professional singer. I'm a software developer, but singing is my hobby, so I seek utility to help me train myself singing...\n\nA: You could give UltraStar Deluxe a try:\n\nA free and open source karaoke game inspired by the Singstar™ game available on the Playstation®. It allows up to six players to sing along with music using microphones in order to score points, depending on the pitch of the voice and the rhythm of singing. \n\nThe content is somewhat limited though.\nP.S.

My laptop (2010 MBA) and her laptop (2012 MBA), both iPhones (4s) and my iPad (New iPad WiFi) and my brother's laptop (2011 MBP) all connect to our WiFi perfectly.\nHowever, when her iPad tries to connect it will work but then the \"login\" page that happens at, say, Starbucks, will come up (the Hotspot Assistant or whatever it's called) and shows a \"Page not found\" error. Then the WiFi disconnects.\nIt was working fine earlier, now after upgrading to iOS 6 the problem has come up.\nIs it a bug that's affecting a lot of users or is it something that's been around for a while and just never happened to her?\n\nA: The solution is to clear your Safari cookies and settings:\nSettings - Safari - Clear Cookies and Data - Restart\n\nA: Go into settings - Cellular Data - APN settings. This would have been reset after the update. Amend to suit your particular carrier eg Optus - key in - yesbusiness - all one word and in lower case.

It connects to router then tries to bring me to apple.com page. Then kicks me off network.\n\n\nA: See this thread at apple.com.\n  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4311913?tstart=0\nSelect the triangle at the right of wi-fi router you're trying to connect to. Scroll to the bottom and change the HTTP Proxy from OFF to AUTO.\n\nA: I had the same problem with iOS 6 and I just figured it out. You have to reset your all of your network settings. This means you will have to locate and type in the passwords to all of your favorite networks. Nonetheless it has worked so far. \nGo to: Settings - General - Reset (at the bottom) - then click \"Reset Network Settings\".\nThen connect to your network, type in the password, and then you should be back to normal.\n\nA: FWIW, the way I got it working was to forget the network, access the network again (enter password), then, in the network details, tap the slider for Auto-Join or that network.\n(As I check the settings now, that slider is not there.  Maybe because I'm currently on the network.)\n", "Q: iOS6 has loaded someone totally different's details I did an Over The Air update on my iPhone 4S this morning to IOS6.

I am choosing to download and utilize the OS X 10.8.2 dmg update method, since I have multiple Macs to update. For one reason or another, the download did not finish completely through the web browser. I continued and completed the download with wget --continue <url> in a terminal.\nI would like to be sure that the file is without corruption, but Apple doesn't seem to post checksums with the downloads. What are the MD5 or SHA1 checksums of both the 10.8.2 delta and combo update dmg files?\n\nA: They never post hashes because they make silent update of their combo updates!!!\nthe 10.8.2 has been modified between the first release date and december : they included the 10.8.2 Supplemental Update, and of course did not notify about it on their websites...\nBuild number has also been updated.\nThank you Apple to make updates even more transparent compared to Microsoft!\n\nA: Had to download them for work (the joy's of sustained 3MB/sec downloads, yes B not b) so thought I'd hash them for you:\n10.8.2 Combo Update 10.8.x to 10.8.2\nSHA1: b08f10233d362e39f20b69f91d1d73f5e7b68a2c\nMD5: 0b98f4a431be0a3df73ab8bcbc3a5dfe\n\n10.8.2 Delta Update 10.8.1 to 10.8.2\nSHA1: d6779e1cc748b78af0207499383b1859ffbebe33\nMD5: 19e08e0a558c59d5508fced80769c782\n\n", "Q: Dual FireWire External HDD and second port performance Backstory: There is a drive that comes to mind out there that has two FireWire 800 ports.  My question is related to performance of the second port.  In my case, I would like to hook up an external sound card to my MacBook Pro.  I am already maxing out my USB ports with other devices and I and using Thunderbolt to power another display.  So my only option is to use FireWire, which is the choice anyways.\nQuestion: Will using a dual FireWire 5400 RPM HDD with the additional port (daisy chain) affect the stability, quality or bus speed to the external sound card?\n\nA: It shouldn't.

I just downloaded ios6 and the latest version of podcasts app.  when i look at all of my podcasts, subscriptions is turned off.\nIs there anyway to keep my subscriptions in sync between itunes on my computer and iphone podcasts app?\n\nA: I don't believe the subscriptions are synced, just the files. I imagine the reason for this is that if subscriptions synced, your Mac and iOS device would both download all new episodes, rather than having one copy that gets synced between them.\n", "Q: Numbers create a chart with transposed data I'm willing to use numbers to create a chart.\nUnfortunately it is creating the chart using the rows of my data source and I can find how to tell it to use columns instead.\nDo you know how I could set that?\n\nA: I found it out.

I made a huge mistake of upgrading to iOS 6 today. I hate the release and I want OUT. When I try to downgrade by restoring to IPSW for 5.1.1 it tells me that the device isn't eligible for the build. What do I have to do to make iTunes accept this IPSW file and run the install?\nYou can read how to downgrade to iOS 5.1.1 on my blog : http://antonpug.com/blog\n\nA: I just read this blog post and it looks like it's possible to downgrade but only if you do it quickly. Soon there will be no turning back.\nAlso, it's device dependent, as explained in this post\nIt worked for me to restore an old back up.\n\nA: In general, you will need to jailbreak (if that's even possible on the new iOS) the device to revert the OS. iOS upgrades (OTA or via iTunes) are one way and have been that way (unable to downgrade) since the 1.0.\nHopefully someone will see your plea for help once they know if and how a jailbreak will work. In the past you needed to get shsh keys from Apple and there was a limited window after updates to get the old keys. If this is so, time is of the essence for you. I haven't been keeping up on jailbreaking enough to even recommend a wiki or reputable source other than to recommend you search the internet.\nOf course if someone hasn't already asked a how to jailbreak iOS 6 question here, you are free to ask that question as well or edit that into this question.\n\nA: You will need the following programs:\n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes latest version\n\n*iREB \n\n*Tiny Umbrella \n\n\nFirst open up iREB, select your device and put it into DFU mode. Once it is done you will get a message stating that your device is now in DFU mode.\nSecond you then need to open up Tiny Umbrella and click \"Start the TSS server.\"\nThird, open up iTunes. A message will pop up reminding you that your device is in DFU mode. Hold down Shift when you click the restore button and choose the firmware. It may take a while to load the firmware but it does work.\nThis process also works for custom firmware as well.\n", "Q: Colored dots on iCloud calendar are too dim, any setting i need to change?

I would like to upgrade my iPhone 4 to iOS6 but I'm wondering if I will get performance loss (as when I upgraded my iPhone 3G to iOS4 : terrible).\nCan someone confirm that it won't affect my day to day use?\n\nA: I have been running iOS 6 since Friday night (I ran the Golden Master that became release) on my iPhone 4.\nSafari feels snappier (and show improvement on SunSpider benchmarks).\nI have not noticed any degradation like the 3G iOS 4 craziness that apple gave us (I went through that as well). \nI am very happy and using it (everyday) and it feels a bit better in most things than 5.\n\nA: I'm running iOS 6 on iPhone 4 and the first thing I noticed is a clear performance boost. Everything feels smoother and snappier. Animations are more fluid too.\n\nA: I have iPhone 4 and yesterday i upgraded it to iOS 6. But really - i can't find performance change. New maps, new apps...but that's all. For me there is no performance change, or it just too small and i can't feel it now\nSo don't be affraid of the upgrade\n\nA: I have an iPhone 4 running iOS 6 and haven't noticed any performance or battery life issues. In fact, the phone is 18 months old (so the battery isn't new), and before charging it earlier today, it was at 14% battery with 2 days 20 hours of standby, 5 hours 30 minutes of usage.

I had a similar issue. Files created by one user in two groups (administrator & user) on NAS were not being able to read by users only in the user group. I tried reseting ownership/permissions using File Station from DiskStation and did nothing. I figured something was wrong with root folder permissions on shared folder - and yes, they were owned by root and 777 chmod.\nI've managed to fix this by:\n\n\n*\n\n*On the Synology - control panel - win/mac/nfs - goto Mac File Serivce (AFP) and turn off Apply default UNIX permissions (Mac file services enabled) - root of your problem\n\n*log on to NAS via ssh, go to most root shared folder and do\nchown -R nobody:users shared_folder/\nchmod -R 755 shared_folder/\n\nused info from here, here and here.\n\nA: In my case, I discovered that if I close the folder in the finder there's no problem with permissions. If the folder is open and displayed, then I get the message that I can't save my file due to the fact that I don't have the necessary permissions.

Same goes for the CLI tools.\nBut the strange thing happened when I went to Preferences › Downloads › Components and hit “Install” next to iOS 5.1 Simulator. I was prompted for my Apple ID and password at me, so I typed the credentials and confirmed. It turned out I was unauthorized to download it, because I hadn’t enrolled in the iOS Developer Program. (Installing Command Line Tools went just fine, though.)\nIt was a serious matter to me, because I’m a front-end engineer and test my work in different browsers, including the second-latest major version of Mobile Safari.\nHow can this be fixed?\n\nA: See Xcode 4.5 and iOS 5.1 Simulator for the solution to this problem:\n\nI headed over to the downloads page for Apple Developers to get the previous version of Xcode (which is 4.4.1).

I have downloaded some third party software, should I just put under /Applications or should I put under my home folder, e.g. ~/MyApps/?\n\nA: It depends on what applications you want to keep to yourself and which ones you want to make accessible to all users:\n\n\n*\n\n*Applications stored in /Applications are installed for all users.\n\n*The ~ stands for your home folder.\nApplications stored in ~username/Applications are only for access by the user username.\n\nA: I tried separating \"personal\" apps to ~/Applications/ and eventually gave it up after awhile because I found it to be annoying.\nIt turned out to be a lot hassle in little ways, and finally I just moved them all. I kept finding apps which only looked in /Applications/ so I had to keep tweaking settings.\nMore and more apps include checks to see if they are in /Applications/ and offer to move themselves, which meant even more annoyances.\nIf you install apps, such as Microsoft Office, which come with installers, you probably won't even have the choice.\nBut your experience won't necessarily be mine.\nI'd put them into ~/Applications/ and then if you decide that you want to change it later, drag them all to /Applications/. It's easier to do that than try to separate them later because some apps do install themselves to /Applications/ and won't handle being moved somewhere else.\n\nA: I just put everything in the application folder.  I used to try to sort things but had issues with applications that do not like being an any folder other than applications (MS Office, Adobe programs, etc).  Since I couldn't easily move these around, my organization scheme was incomplete and I just gave up.\nThis is probably sacrilege but you might want to try using Launchpad.  The folders you create there aren't actual folders in the file system and therefore won't break picky applications that absolutely must live in applications.  Mountain Lion also added a few new features to Launchpad that make it more useable, such as searching.\n", "Q: Trying to understand how podcast syncing works in iOS 6 I noticed that in iOS6 I can't listen to podcasts in iTunes, but only in the new podcast app.\nWhat is troubling me:\n\n*\n\n*The play-count, played/unplayed status, or progress, of podcasts I\nlisten to via the podcast app don't update in iTunes.\n\n*I have subscribed to several podcasts inside of the podcast app with syncing turned on.\nBut I don't see these show up in the iTunes podcast section.\n\nThis must be a bug, or Apple has completely separated iTunes podcasts from podcasts on iOS6 devices. If that's the case, I'm not sure what the 'syncing' option in the podcast app settings is for.\nHow do I fix this?\n\nEdit for clarification: I found that the only meta-data value that wasn't syncing was the \"Last Played\" date, which was caused a smart playlist dependent on that value not to work. So that may be a bug. Otherwise, I'm still don't understand why iTunes isn't syncing with the podcasts I subscribe to via the podcast app.\n\nA: Same thing for me, this upgrade has brought nothing but headaches.\nYou can still open Podcasts in your Music App by doing a search for the podcast name.\nDeleting the Podcasts app from your phone and killing the Music apps process (or reboot phone) will bring the Podcasts menu back to the Music app as well, hurrah!\n\nA: I believe Apple's logic is as follows. If you want to sync your podcasts through iTunes, don't install the Podcasts app. Use the Music app instead. If you want to untether your podcasts and manage them independently on your iOS device, use the Podcasts app. \n", "Q: What is the /data/db folder in OS X?

I have Contact cards for my father- and brother-in-law, let's call them John Smith and Johnny Smith (he's a Junior). My father-in-law doesn't use Facebook, but my brother-in-law does, and since he goes by John Smith on Facebook, Mountain Lion associated my father-in-law's card with his account (even though I had birthdays for each card - now my father-in-law has two birthdays...).\nIs there any way I can correct it to choose by brother-in-law instead? I tried disabling Contacts integration from System Preferences, then renaming them to be John Smith, Sr. and John Smith and turning it back on. It remained connected to my father-in-law.\n\nA: There is an easier option. Go to the contact that has been merged. Click edit. Click the minus icon next to the Facebook card at the bottom of the contact. The two cards will spring apart and you will have two contacts. Hit save.\n\nA: I made a new contact card for my father-in-law (adding his middle initial and the \"Sr.\" suffix), and deleted the original. When I turned Facebook integration back on, Facebook created its own card for my brother-in-law. From there, I was able to select the Facebook card and my original (iCloud) card, and choose Card -> Link Selected Cards from the menubar. That worked like a charm.\nApple could have helped the situation immensely by adding an opposite menu item named \"Unlink Selected Cards\". Then, I wouldn't have had to delete and recreate my father-in-law's card.\n", "Q: Turn On Air Play on iPad Without Double Tapping Home Button Is there a way to enable Air Play Mirroring on the iPad without (!) double tapping the  home button? \nI'd like to physically lock away the home button to use the iPad on a booth but still be able to mirror the screen on an Apple TV. Is this possible?\n\nA: If you have gestures enabled, you can swipe up using 4 fingers and then scroll to the left to access Air Play.\nNot sure of any other ways.\n", "Q: Does the OS X log notifications from the Notification Center? The helpful companion to the OSX notifications center Growl per default logs all received notifications. You can define how big the log may get or disable logging in the application.\nSince the latest update Growl offers to forward all notifications to the OS X Notification Center.\nDoes OS X log Notifications Center messages as well? If yes, where can I find them?\nWhy I am asking this:\nOS X logs all your downloads in a SQLite 3.x database. I want to know if something similar happens with notifications as well. This could be a privacy issue when thinking of private messages or e-mails if too much information is stored.\n\nA: On High Sierra 10.4.3 you can locate by the following commands\ngetconf DARWIN_USER_DIR\n/var/folders/60/23gd59655q70qf_ckxjyhrzr0000gn/0/\n\nls /var/folders/60/23gd59655q70qf_ckxjyhrzr0000gn/0/com.apple.notificationcenter/\n\nThere is a db and a db2 folder - appears the database was migrated to db2 in November.\n\nA: This is an old question, but just in case someone stumbles on it and is specifically worried about the privacy implications of Notification Center, the answer is YES, OS X does keep a log of notifications on disk.\nThe format is an sqlite database, and it can be found inside this folder:\n~/Library/Application Support/NotificationCenter\n\nInside you'll find at least one .db file for your account, i've seen some that OS X apparently considered corrupt at one point, so they're called .db.corrupt.\nRunning the strings command on this file will show you a load of binary data, quite a few \"NSSomething\" class names, and yes, your iMessages, file paths, twitter and facebook notifications and anything else that was sent to Notification Center by an app or the system.\nIf you want to get rid of that file at a specific point in time, you can kill usernoted temporarily (it'll restart itself) and delete the file in one shot (run this as your user account, not with sudo):\nkillall usernoted && rm ~/Library/Application\\ Support/NotificationCenter/*.db\n\nThis will, 99% of the time, catch usernoted while it's temporarily not running, successfully delete the old database, and usernoted will make a new empty one when it starts again.\nThis isn't a good solution if you're really worried about privacy, but aside from encrypting your system or using a ramdisk for that folder, there really isn't a solution.\n\nA: In Mac OSX (or macos) 10.10 and later, this file has moved. The filename isn't the same for everyone, so you need to do a tiny bit of sleuthing to find it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch 'Activity Monitor' (in /Applications/Utilities)\n\n*Seach for the process usernoted, double-click it\n\n*Go to the tab \"Open files and ports\"\n\n\nIt is in a /com.apple.notificationcenter/db subfolder under /private/var/folders.\n(thanks to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26754189/new-location-of-the-notification-center-db-file-in-10-10 for the new location!)\n\nA: Yes, OSX logs the notifications. They are in sqlite3 db and db-wal file.\nAs in 10.14.6 - Mojave, the path of the file could be found via:\nlsof -p $(ps aux | grep -m1 usernoted | awk '{ print $2 }')| awk '{ print $NF }' | grep 'db2/db$' | xargs dirname\n\n\nA: Yes, notifications will be added to the Notification Center if you do not confirm/click them when appearing. You can access them by clicking the Notification Center icon in the top right corner of your menu bar.\n\nHowever, they are all listed under the Growl app and not the originating app, and clicking them does not seem to lead anywhere, so the functionality is a bit limited compared to standard Growl notifications and the Growl Rollup. \nThis is probably a limitation in how the Growl developers can address the Notification Center, and I presume we'll just need to wait for all apps to incorporate the Notification Center directly (next to/instead of Growl) for a bit more functional notifications.\n", "Q: Can I re-purchase an app with a different apple ID? I have a development machine that another employee (who has left) purchased Xcode on. Now I want to update Xcode, but I don't have that employee's apple ID information. I signed out of the App Store and back in with my account, but it won't let me update or re-buy the app because it was originally bought with his account. Any ideas?\n\nA: Simply delete the app from your machine. The store prevents two copies of the same app from being installed as a general case\nYou should then be able to re-buy it as it would be a fresh download - signed for the account you prefer rather than a re-download of the app signed for the old Apple ID.\n", "Q: How to remove your name from the menu bar after 10.7.5 update? After the 10.7.5 update to Lion, I'm getting my name to appear in the menu bar. I don't particularly like it there. Any way to remove it?\n\n\nA: Go to System Preferences -> Users & Groups\nAt the bottom of the user list click the 'Login Options' item and then make sure 'Show fast user switching menu as ...' is unchecked.\nThat'll get rid of fast user switching from the menu bar for you.\n\n\nA: Have you changed it under Users & Groups preference pane after the update?\n\nOnce you select Login Options in the lower left, choose icon or short name or deselect this item entirely to remove the user from the menu bar.\n", "Q: How do I convert a pages document to a word document without access to pages? Suppose I didn't have access to a Mac with pages.  How can I convert a pages document to a word document using only a windows environment?  Is there a freeware converter available?\n\nA: Pages is free, so go get it if you can. \nIn addition to the iOS and macOS pages app, the iCloud version of Pages enable anyone on Linux, Windows and Mac to use a modern browser and edit/convert pages documents without needing local software.\nThis beta started rolling out to people that had brand new iCloud accounts in late July at https://beta.icloud.com and now Apple is slowly rolling out the beta to anyone that logs in to https://www.icloud.com\n\nThe actual web apps are the same whether you enter through the beta URL or the normal URL and the only difference between the two is the treatment of the rest of the iCloud icons. The www url has linen and iOS 6 styling and the beta URL has iOS 7 styling without needing Mavericks or iOS 7.\n\nA: Yes, there is. You can either do it online, with Zamzar, which requires and email address where you'll receive the converted files,  or download PagesConverter which apparently does not keep the formatting and you need a .net framework.\n\nA: Whilst you may not have Pages, there are other means to access it, as follows:\nTwo viable solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why don't you email it to someone who has Pages on a Mac**, and they can then save it for you as a Word document and email it back to you.\n\n*Email it to yourself or put it on a usb stick, go to an Apple Store or equivalent, open it in Pages on one of their Macs, save it as a Word document, and then email it back to yourself.\n\n\n(** That could well include someone here at Ask Different)\n\nA: Similiarly to bmike's answer, you could use the current version of iCloud (www.icloud.com) to upload your document in .pages format, and then download it in .doc format.\nSorry, I have only access to the French version, so all menus are in French in the pictures, and I'm only guessing the English translations.\n\n\n*\n\n*Login to iCloud\n\n*Click the Pages icon\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*In the top right corner, click the dented wheel icon, and select \"Load a document\"\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Once the document is uploaded, it will appear in the center of the window, right-click it and select \"Download the document\"\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*You will be prompted to choose a format\n\n\n\n", "Q: What's the practical difference between a 16GB and 32GB iPhone? I'm looking to close a deal on an iPhone. What I am having difficulty understanding is the difference between 16GB and 32GB. When does it matter if you have 32GB and 16GB?\nI understand, of course, the technical difference (free space capacity on the internal storage). As a casual smartphone user (have an Android but don't have many apps on it), and a mobile developer, I'm not sure I need 32GB. (I think my Android phone as 8GB, and I'm not using more than half.)\nSo when does it really matter? What are the \"use-cases,\" if you will, for someone needing or using 32GB but not 16GB?\nI'm also not planning to get a data plan, if that matters.\n\nA: Other than cost (for the initial purchase and potentially to repair or replace it) and size, there is no measurable difference in performance, battery life or other function between any of the iPhone 5 models for sale (and certainly within the same carrier in case one LTE model uses slightly more power than another). The same goes for each iPhone (and iPad and iPod) model going back to the first generation of hardware.\nRather than focus on the marketing terms, I like to point out that the usable space isn't really 16 GB on the entry level devices.\nA quick survey of friends has shown that you can expect the following amounts of usable space on an iPhone 5 with iOS 6:\n\n\n*\n\n*13.70 GB of space on the 16 GB model\n\n*28.00 GB of space on the 32 GB model\n\n*57.20 GB of space on the 64 GB model\n\n\nThis is the space you will have once the OS is loaded and you start to put HD movies, 28 megapixel panoramic photos and HD quality video onto the device. I have used a 16 GB model iPhone 4 for two years and as a moderately heavy user of iOS apps for work, do constantly run low on space on the device.\n\nI have paid for iTunes Match, and only sync one episode of the 15 podcasts (audio only) so the audio portion is really the songs I listen to all the time. I do have 200 Apps on the device, but the combined load of the data plus the application of the top 30 takes up 6.5 GB of space. The rest of the 170 apps use less than 30 MB of space (that is 0.03 GB) and they sit in folders on screens 4 and 5 of my layout taking neither screen real estate nor storage space.\nBefore I dive in and give some more advice, I'll leave you with one piece of what I hope is wisdom. Consider how much it costs to replace the device if you drop it on a cement sidewalk.  Also, consider whether you already know how much you will spend on apps - a new user might be better off not being \"phone-rich\" and \"app-poor\" from the start. When I bought my \"13.75 GB iPhone\", I chose to invest in AppleCare plus rather than more RAM. Each person buying the device can certainly live with 16 GB by taking time to prune things, pay for iTunes Match and clear out video and large game apps periodically so it starts to become how much you value your time and whether you will really use the phone as a computer or just make calls and play games on it. Neither is wrong, just that we all have different use cases.\nSince the hardware is identical other than storage size, each of us now has a framework to decide if you'll also have an iPod touch in a larger capacity or an iPad (I had a 32 GB iPad when I got this phone and now carry a 64 GB iPad to compensate for my phone's limited storage on the go) and want to skimp on your iPhone. By looking at where else you could spend that up charge for a 32 GB model on perhaps more apps, more insurance, or more eating dinner out. Balance how precious (and valuable in a $ sense) your time is and know picking a smaller device will mean you might have to choose what to do when it fills rather than just go on that weekend trip knowing you can take minutes of video and hundreds of pictures without having to delete some apps that you can re-download when you get home.\n\nA: The difference is 16GB of storage.\nHow big is your iTunes library? Do you want to carry movies and TV shows on your phone in case you happen to want to watch them while waiting somewhere? How big are the last 1000 photos you've taken in your iPhoto library? Do you like to shoot video with your phone?\nThen, what about apps? Some apps are much larger than others. GarageBand and Pages in particular are not small.\nThere is no external storage like SD card slots, so the capacity you buy is the capacity the device has for its lifetime. For me, 16GB doesn't fit the songs alone I'd want on my iPod, let alone photos, videos, and other app content. On the other hand, one would need to shoot and store a lot of video to run into the 64GB limit (or want to keep a lot of feature-length movies on the phone just in case).\n\nA: There's no difference besides the storage capacity.\nAs the iPhone does not have an option to extend the memory after purchase, you have to choose the right amount of storage right from the beginning.\nYou can always manage how much space you use by manually choosing which data to sync (music, photos, movies, apps).\nGenerally more available space gives you the freedom of not having to manage your sync settings too much.\n\n*\n\n*16GB should be fine for most people, especially if they are willing to make compromises regarding sync settings.\n\n*32GB is good if your like to take lots of photos or have a large music library.\n\n*64GB is good if you record HD movies which increase in size very quickly the longer you record.\n\n", "Q: Can I view or export or clear Siri's interaction history? I would like to ask you is it possible to somehow access all of Siri's history to view it or delete it?\n\nA: No there is no way to access Siri history. If any of it is stored, it will be stored anonymously as chunks of different words and phrases on Apple’s servers for better voice recognition.\n\nA: You can delete your Siri data from Apple's servers by disabling Siri in Settings.\nGo to General → Siri and disable Siri.\nThis will delete your history with it. You can enable it again in the future with no problem.\n\nA: Taken from the privacy file displayed when turning Siri on - off.\n\nYou may choose to turn off Siri or Dictation at any time. To turn off Siri, open Settings on your iOS device, tap General, tap Siri, and slide the Siri switch to “off”. To turn off Dictation, open Settings, tap General, tap Keyboard, and slide the Enable Dictation switch to “off”.  If you turn off both Siri and Dictation, Apple will delete your User Data, as well as your recent voice input data. Older voice input data that has been disassociated from you may be retained for a period of time to generally improve Siri, Dictation and dictation functionality in other Apple products and services. This voice input data may include audio files and transcripts of what you said, related diagnostic data, such as hardware and operating system specifications and performance statistics, and the approximate location of your device at the time the request was made.\n\n\nA: Well, you can't or at least I didn't find any answer. However, if it was questions to ask her on internet, check the Safari history, there will be all your searches through Siri. \n\nA: Here's a little script that'll save all new Siri recordings on macOS: https://gist.github.com/varenc/8cae8f19fede79f63b84cc85f602f382\nIt just uses fswatch to monitor the Siri directory looking for new recordings. Siri temporarily saves these on disks, but then immediately deletes them after upload. That script just copies that out before Siri can delete them. It lets you keep a record of all your Siri interactions, though it's just your audio, not Siri's responses.\n\nA: Here is a way to view history.

For some reason I can't use MacPorts. So the question is if it's possible to install Apache, PHP and MySQL on Snow Leopard w/o using MacPorts?\nPlease don't offer MAMP or other bundles.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Yes, Apache and PHP already come by default with a Mac OS X installation, and you can download an installer for MySQL on their website.\nFor a configuration guide, have a look at this related answer:\nHow to turn Mac OS X Lion into a web server?\nThe linked answer also applies to Mac OS X Snow Leopard.\nAnother popular (and imo superior) way of running development environments is running a Linux server with your preferred configuration in a VirtualBox virtual machine.

Prior to this install, I could rapidly tap twice on my touchpad and, on the second tap, drag the pointer to highlight text. Now, with this new install, that feature is missing. I tried looking in the trackpad settings but couldn't find anything to re-enable this feature.\n\nA: Here is the answer to your question:\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences\n\n*Select Accessibility\n\n*Go to Pointer Control in Motor Section\n\n*Select Mouse & Trackpad\n\n*Select Trackpad Options\n\n*Select Enable dragging withoug Drag Lock\n\nA: I have searched all locations which come to mind for enabling such a setting, but without success:\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences → Trackpad\n\n*System Preferences → Accessibility → Keyboard\n\n*System Preferences → Keyboard\n\n\nTherefore, I suggest the following alternative:\nSystem Preferences→Trackpad→Point & Click→Three Finger Drag\nThis way you can highlight text without delay by using three finger touch.

Also the iPod Nano is not an iOS device.\n", "Q: How to input accented characters to an OS running in a VM? I have a MacBook Pro with English (US) keyboard layout. I usually hold the right-alt (option) key, and press E to activate the accented vowel insertion (it shows a placeholder where the accented letter—á/Á, é/É, í/Í, ó/Ó, ú/Ú—would appear), and after pressing the corresponding vowel it will be inserted in place. Similar procedure using the N key to insert the ñ/Ñ characters.\nI also have an Ubuntu Desktop computer with Latin American keyboard layout. Latin American Spanish keyboards have the acute accent character ´ right after the P key. In order to insert an accented vowel, you type first the acute accent, and then the vowel. Similarly to insert the ñ/Ñ characters, one would type the ~ character and then the n/N letter.\nEverything fine until here.\nThe problem is when I have to run a Linux OS on a Virtual Machine (VirtualBox) on the Mac. I don't have the ´ character on the physical keyboard, and the right-alt (option) key doesn't have the same effect as in Mac OS.\nThe question here is, if there's a way to insert international (or at least accented vowels, which are the ones I mostly use) characters from the physical keyboard of the Mac, to the guest OS in the VirtualBox?\n\nA: You can simply change the keyboard layout in Ubuntu without any changes to OS X:\n\nThen you can type like you would do on your Latin American keyboard.\n\nA: Mine defaulted to the Spain keyboard setting. The Spain keyboard has the ñ/Ñ characters right after the L-key and the acute accent character one space after that: [L] [Ñ] [´]. The ñ/Ñ characters need no extra work In order to insert an accented vowel you would press the acute accent, then the vowel and release.\n", "Q: Does AirPlay mirroring have any restrictions? I saw that mountain lion now allows full screen mirroring over airplay to an Apple TV.\nFor awhile when I want to play something on my tv from my computer I've just run an HDMI to DVI cable to my laptop, especially since some things I can't stream through my PS3 (doesn't like anything purchased in itunes) And I know the Apple TV would not stream just any file from my computer.\nBut since I can mirror audio and video am I now able to stream anything to the Apple TV by playing it on my laptop screen and using mirroring?\nI just saw this thread which would imply that even if this would work, it won't since both my Mac Pro and laptop are pre 2011 macs.\n\nA: There are restrictions on Airplay in Mountain Lion. It has to do with your video card that comes on the machines that you are using. \nYour video card has to be powerful enough to do all the heavy lifting of streaming so that your CPU is unhindered and therefor you can smoothly still use your machine.  \nThis question and answer should help you out and explain things and find an alternative, such as AirParrot.\nHere is an Apple Support Article on the subject, listing the restrictions and giving more information on how Airplay Mirroring works.\nHere is the excert from the article showing the compatible computers:\niMac (Mid 2011 or newer)\nMac mini (Mid 2011 or newer)\nMacBook Air (Mid 2011 or newer)\nMacBook Pro (Early 2011 or newer)\n\nAs for a Mac Pro, they are not listed as a compatible model that supports Airplay Mirroring, as discussed in this article here.\nYou can still connect a cable and mirror in that sense, that has not changed in ML.

Now I've heard about Fink and Homebrew. It seems these two utilities are gaining ground in the Mac community, but I don't understand the difference between them.\nWhat is the main difference between MacPorts, Fink, and Homebrew? Is there any difference in quality or performance?\n\nA: Fink and MacPorts are direct competitors in that they install an orthogonal system.  Fink lost considerable ground to MacPorts several years ago.  I'm not completely sure why now, but MacPorts handled almost everything better. \nWe've less reason for an orthogonal installation now that Mac OS X has grown less crazy pants.  Brew was otoh created to integrate better with Mac OS X, making it lighter weight and less orthogonal, and also because Rubyist rewrite everything.   \nIn practice, MacPorts is a bit more complicated, but MacPorts almost always works, while Brew is simpler but more likely to run into a brick wall.\nAsk yourself these question : \n\n\n*\n\n*Do you use many Linux ecosystem tools? \n\n*Do you need multiple versions? \n\n*Do you experiment with new tools much? \n\n*Do you use math/science tools/libraries or other unusual tools? \n\n\nAny yes answers suggest you should choose MacPorts.  Brew is less overhead if you install relatively few and common packages, but Brew won't handle complexities as well.  Brew pollutes /usr/local which you might want for manual installations too.  Actually, there are more detailed arguments for MacPorts but again they probably do not apply if you answered no.\nConversely, if you answered yes but your primary machine runs Linux, and your Mac is only a toy running minimal Linux software, then actually you might do better with Brew.\n\nA: Fink has been around since at least 2001. Fink and MacPorts are package managers that want to be \"orthogonal\" to the system, that is, they install their own version of python, perl, libraries, compilers, etc. in own trees (/sw for Fink, /opt/local for MacPorts). The reason for this is that they have no control what Apple does with its software, and it occasionally broke things when Apple updated their own stuff.\nFrom what I understand, Homebrew wants to be more \"integrated\" with the system, uses the libraries that Apple provides, and installs its stuff in /usr/local/bin and other standard folders. I guess that means that the software choice is more limited with Homebrew, I can't imagine that one could install KDE with it, but I've not tried that.\nOne point for Fink vs. MacPorts: a few years back, the Fink project provided binary packages; that is you could download and install the packages without compiling them yourself. Its package manager still has that ability, only there have been no binaries available for a long time. I do not know if that has changed in the meantime.\nSo in short: without the binary stuff, Fink and MacPorts are very similar. They should have more packages available than Homebrew, while Homebrew should take less disk space for the reasons I stated above. Concerning the quality: I've never installed Homebrew, and between Fink and MacPorts I usually prefer the one that I'm not currently using.\nSo if you are satisfied with MacPorts, just stay with it.\nP.S. The reason I never tried Homebrew is that I use some precompiled packages. These usually also install themselves into /usr/local/bin and the like, which just cries for trouble.\n\nA: But as a side note, nothing Apple OS X related would install itself into /usr/local/bin.\nThey use /usr/lib , /usr/bin behind the scenes and frameworks gets packaged up into /Library/Frameworks while stuff you install yourself via the regular Unix ./configure, make, make install will use /usr/local/bin etc, and utilities like MacPorts will use /opt/ and possibly package frameworks to your personal ~/Library/Frameworks/.\nMy recommendation is to stay with MacPorts if that's what you're used to.\nBasically the main difference is that MacPorts uses a system that closer resembles the true Unix/BSD ports tree implementation with ports from FreeBSD, while Fink uses applications ported from the Linux Debian archives, and uses the same package manager system as Linux Debian. \n\nA: I'd say the main differences are:\nProvidence, outcome, and the method of distribution.\nThe most important detail will be for you to check if the system you choose contains package(s) for the software you want. Package counts are approximately: 19k Macports, 22k Fink, 3k Homebrew, 10k pkgsrc.\n\n\n*\n\n*Macports, formerly Darwin ports seems to be a BSD style ports system like pkgsrc which gets source, patches it, builds it, and installs it. If it is very like pkgsrc it'll do this using shell scripts. It used to rely on the tools provided by Xcode, but that started causing problems, so now it can also bootstrap gcc. Additionally there's some binary packages out there, but you may not find the latest version for your system every time. It came from Darwin, the Apple open-sourced BSD based on the OS X kernel which ceased distribution. It installs packages to /opt/local which probably won't get touched by other installer packages or system upgrades.\n\n*Fink, re: finches being the subject of Charles Darwin's study, is a package system based on Debian Package Manager, that means it features use of dpkg and apt-get the main benefit being that that you can reliably find binary packages.. assuming you have an upstream package repository that contains binaries for your current OS version.  It also came out of the Darwin user-base but probably more popular with those who came from Debian Linux [for mac, or PPC] looking for a little more stable hardware support... while it lasted. It installs packages into /sw for reasons of not overwriting or getting overwritten what other installers might install. Also something about compiler search paths and the default PATH containing /usr/local/bin already.\n\n*Homebrew is a kind of ports system in concept, but written in ruby. It doesn't come from a stand-alone OS world and was intended for Mac OS X users (the others are thoroughly used and tested by the same). As of mid-2014 it tries to build basically every package (they call them formula) though a few are available in binary form called bottles, and you can make a repository of bottles to share in your social group if you're inclined on semi-standardizing you and your friend's toolchains (ditto for other systems). On the plus side, it builds using as many of the libraries as you probably already have that came from Apple. I think you don't need Xcode for it to work in most cases, but it \"supports and recommends\" it.  You can install each item in its own prefix, but the default is the relatively integrated /usr/local I think it was kickstarted and is more recent than the others. I've personally found I used this one most because I rarely need interdependent packages, and I'm unclear on how well mac homebrew supports it. Homebrew aims to force you to use more appropriate package managers for software that originates from a tightly coupled manager, like cpan, gems and the like.\n\n*pkgsrc would be available for Mac OS X, has binary packages, and comes from NetBSD which maintains it and in turn based it on FreeBSD's port system. NetBSD was so focused on portability across architectures that it was probably the best candidate port system to start supporting other platforms too, which it has. It's similar in my description to Macport, but I've not used it (except on NetBSD), and I think it installs into / but builds and maintains packages in /pkg. There's probably a lot of packages (like 12k) and some 20% may not build, or, the latest version of the source may not patch with the last maintained patch. That's why the binary packages are my preference with these kinds of systems.\n\n\nI've also used perlbrew which is a kind of homebrew for perl, applications built in perl and some dependencies. It's mostly a good way to maintain multiple versions of perl, and it conveniently negates the need for other more general package systems (for its purpose). But of course that also has cpan and cpanminus.\nYou might find similar managers for your own mini-environment (like vundle for vim, or gem for ruby, npm for node.js, pypm or pip for python, go's built-in go install ... etc?)\n", "Q: Head Mode/iPod Mode Not Working for iPhone 4S in iOS 6 I've updated my iPhone 4S to iOS 6 and now I can no longer play music when connected to my car stereo via USB.\nIn the past, the stereo gave me the option to use either \"Head Mode\", where the function of the iPhone/iPod is controlled through the head unit, or \"iPod Mode\", where the device functions normally and just sends an audio signal through the USB cable to the stereo.\nThe \"iPod Mode\" is no longer available. According to the stereo's manual, it will only appear if the device supports it.  Well, the device supported it until iOS 6.\nIs this something that's changed in the new OS?  \n\nA: This has been fixed in iOS 6.0.1. Whew!\n", "Q: Is it possible to search within a PDF document using Kindle for iPad? I am trying to use the Kindle iPad app as a storage base for all of my PDFs.  But I'm disappointed that I can't seem to find a way to search the text within a PDF using the Kindle iPad App.  Am I missing something?  Seems like a critical, missing feature.\nNote that it is possible to search within a book on both iBooks and Kindle. This question is specifically about PDF. It is also possible to open these files in Acrobat Reader or OSX Preview, and the text is searchable within those applications.\n\nA: No.\nAs of version 4.5 of the kindle app for IOS in pdf searching is  not available.\nAs of version 1.10.7 of the kindle app for OS X in pdf searching is available.\n", "Q: App Store language The iTunes App Store on my laptop computer opens in English. The credit card tied to my iTunes account is a US address. My iPad an I are in Mexico. My iPad is set to English for language in the general setting, but when I open the iTunes app on my iPad (iOS 6.0), it is all in Spanish with no way to change it. What do I do to get the iTunes app to appear in English?\n\nA: if you taking about the iTunes Store navigation, this will reflected our current store country (I presume Mexico as per iTunes terms and condition you should match the iTunes Store country with your billing address).\nYou can still go on https://appleid.apple.com/account/manage and select your language.\niF is the actually application itself you want to go on your IOS devices : Settings /General/Language&Region/ and select the correct langue but I don't think that the issue here.\n", "Q: Is there something stronger than \"Force Quit\"? I have an app that won't die: it's gone from the dock, but the window remains (with a beachball, if I mouse over it).  It's using no CPU, but I want it to go away.\nIs there something stronger than \"Force Quit\", to really really kill an app?\n\nA: The force quit window, killall, and kill all send processes TERM signals by default. You can use killall -kill if that doesn't work.\n\nThe killall utility kills processes selected by name, as opposed to the selection by pid as done by kill(1).  By default, it will send a TERM signal to all processes with a real UID identical to the caller of killall that match the name procname. The super-user is allowed to kill any process.\n\nIf you run sudo dtrace -n 'proc:::signal-send /pid/ { printf(\"%s -%d %d\",execname,args[2],args[1]->pr_pid); }' and quit some application from the force quit window, the signal is usually shown as -15 (TERM). But when you quit a background process (or an application that isn't shown in the Dock) from Activity Monitor, the signal is usually shown as -9 (KILL).\n\nSIGTERM is the default signal sent to a process by the kill or killall commands. It causes the termination of a process, but unlike the SIGKILL signal, it can be caught and interpreted (or ignored) by the process. Therefore, SIGTERM is akin to asking a process to terminate nicely, allowing cleanup and closure of files. For this reason, on many Unix systems during shutdown, init issues SIGTERM to all processes that are not essential to powering off, waits a few seconds, and then issues SIGKILL to forcibly terminate any such processes that remain.\n\n\nA: I've had situations where Force Quit, Activity Monitor, kill, and other methods didn't work, and my Mac couldn't shutdown because of it.\nIn this case, a sudo shutdown -r now worked when nothing else would, and is probably better than doing a hard shutdown via the power button.\n\nA: If you know the name of the app, you can check in Activity Monitor to see if it's still running there and try its Force Quit. If that doesn't work, take note of the app's process ID (pid). Go to the Terminal and type kill [pid], replacing \"[pid]\" with the number you noted earlier. If that doesn't work, try kill -3 [pid] and if that doesn't work kill -9 [pid]. If the process is owned by a different user (this is not likely), you may need to replace kill with sudo kill and type your password when prompted.\nIf the app doesn't show up in Activity Monitor or you couldn't kill it, the window may be a left-over stuck someplace else and the app simply isn't running anymore. In this case, sometimes (not always) it can work to killall SystemUIServer or killall Dock.\nIf none of this works, you'll have to log out and back in or reboot. The few times I've gotten to this point, the app was so stuck it prevented logging out or shutting down, so I had to hard reboot. \n\nA: As in above answers, the strongest way to terminate any process is SIGKILL, e.g. kill -9 process_id.\nHowever, exist processes what are simply impossible to Force Quit nor kill. They called as zombie processes.\nHere is a short script what will create a zombie process for two minutes:\nperl -e 'if($p=fork) {print \"unkillable pid:$p\\n\" ;system(\"ps -l\"); sleep(120)}'\n\nRun the above script in the Terminal and you will get output, like next:\n     unkillable pid:50571\n        UID   PID  PPID        F CPU PRI NI       SZ    RSS WCHAN     S             ADDR TTY           TIME CMD\n        501 47380 47379     4006   0  31  0  2448416   2900 -      S                   0 ttys000    0:00.36 -bash\n        501 50570 47380     4006   0  31  0  2443512   1424 -      S+                  0 ttys000    0:00.01 perl -e if($p=fork) {print \"u\n#THIS-> 501 50571 50570     2006   0   0  0        0      0 -      Z+                  0 ttys000    0:00.00 (perl)\n        501 12795 12794     4006   0  31  0  2448296   1752 -      S+                  0 ttys001    0:00.75 -bash\n        501 50123 50122     4006   0  31  0  2448296   2688 -      S+                  0 ttys002    0:00.14 -bash\n\nIf you check the status column for the unkillable process (in this case: 50571) you see the Z flag, whats mean zombie.\nYou can try send any kill signal (e.g. kill -9  50571) and the process will still exists. Anyway, it doesn't hurts much your system, because it's in fact doesn't exists - only occupies process table.\nIn the above example, in 120 seconds it will be cleared.\n\nA: This is what you should do:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Activity Monitor, Double Click the process OR Click the Info icon to open up the process' window.\n\n*You will see the process # in the Process Group line as processName(####) where \"####\" is your process' number.\n\n*Open terminal and type \"sudo kill ####\" without the quotes and hit enter\n\n*Enter your password, terminal will not show your input here\n\n*Process is killed.\n\n\nA process like this is best removed in safe mode if you are going to attempt an uninstall.\nCheers,\nBryan\n", "Q: Are there performance issues with iOS 6 running on iPhone 3GS? My brother has an iPhone 3GS. The upgrade to iOS 5 has considerably slowed down the device. Will the upgrade to iOS 6 slow down the device even more?\nWill iOS 6 work well (not any different from iOS 5) on an iPhone 3GS?\n\nA: According to this ArsTechnica article\n\niOS 6 doesn't make the iPhone 3GS any slower or more difficult to use than it was before, which should be good news to anyone who keeps theirs around as a secondary or backup phone—indeed, it's pleasantly surprising how many of the refinements and improvements make their way down to Apple's oldest-supported piece of iOS hardware. However, that hardware has been surpassed so thoroughly by other iOS and Android handsets at this point that it's difficult to recommend it as a primary handset. You don't have much to lose if you upgrade a 3GS to iOS 6, but there's a lot more to gain by investing in a newer device.\n\n", "Q: What version of GDB version is included in your Xcode? Not sure if this is suitable for Stack Overflow or here.\nI'm having some problems with GDB in Xcode and I wonder if it isn't a problem with what version I'm on. I have Snow Leopard and Xcode 3.2.6. The GDB version that I believe is being used by Xcode is:\nGNU gdb 6.3.50-20050815 (Apple version gdb-1515) (Sat Jan 15 08:33:48 UTC 2011)\n\nMy version in Fink, for example, is:\nGNU gdb (GDB) 7.4.1\n\nI believe I can't go any higher than Xcode 3.2.6 without at least upgrading to Lion.\nCan anyone tell me what version of GDB they have with their corresponding Xcode? I want to know if its worth it for me to switch to Lion or Mountain Lion just for this.\n\nA: The version on my system (Mountain Lion, XCode 4.5 is:\nGNU gdb 6.3.50-20050815 (Apple version gdb-1822) (Sun Aug  5 03:00:42 UTC 2012)\n\nBasically, 6.3 is the last version covered by the GPLv2 license, everything past that is subject to GPLv3. Apple does not distribute any GPLv3 software, presumably as it would seriously hinder their patent lawsuits. (this is also why OSX or XCode no longer ship with Samba or GCC newer than 4.2)\nBy the way, the last version of XCode for Snow Leopard is 4.2, but as far as I know this is only available in the downloads section to iOS or Mac developer program subscribers.\n", "Q: Updated phone now texts are mixed My father updated his iPhone software to iOS 6. Now his wife is recieving his text messages. We tried going to settings and turning off iMessage but that just stopped his phone from getting some of the messages.\nHow can I fix this problem.  Note: they share the same Apple ID.\n\nA: Without knowing more details, I cannot know this for certain, but it seems likely that your father's wife is receiving iMessages sent to him, but not SMS text messages. This is the designed behavior – iMessages are delivered to an Apple ID, and if they share an Apple ID, iMessages will go to both of them. The solution is for them to not share an Apple ID.\nThat said, one can set up a different Apple ID for Messages but keep the same Apple ID for the App store, iTunes, etc. This would alloow them to share purchases, but keep their messages separate from each other.\nYou can also go into Settings > Messages > Send & Receive and un-check mark the email address that is associated with both of their phones (and Apple IDs). There is a good chance that will also fix your problem.\n\nA: To stop messages going to multiple phones:\ngo to settings, then messages, then send & receive...\nfrom there deselect the numbers you don't want to receive your texts.\n\nA: I updated my iPhone to 6.1.3 and it set it automatically...so when I texted my kids they said it showed as being from my wife's iPhone.\nTo turn off...go to Settings > Messages and you want to turn OFF the top item, \"iMessage\"\nThis fixed it for us!\n", "Q: Where do my apps go when I run out of screen space? Didn't realize I had ran out of home screen space on my iPad and I purchased a new app. The App store shows it is installed, and if I search for it I can find it, but I cannot find it on any of my screens. \nI've since deleted some other apps and consolidated some into folders, so there is space, but I still cannot find it to place it.\n1st Generation iPad\niOS version 5.1.1\nSuggestions?\n\nA: The iPad can contain up to 11 pages on its home screen, each page containing up to 20 apps (not counting folders). If all the spots are full when a new app is downloaded, the app will download and install, but not have a spot on the home screen. You can run it through search, the fast app switcher, etc., but not from the home screen.\nIf space is cleared on the home screen, it appears Apps don't fill in automatically. Rebooting has been known to help.\nNow that folders allow more than the 220 apps, I'd recoommend making sure you have an empty spot for the app to appear before purchasing.\n\nA: OK, it would appear rebooting caused them to appear.

I speak English with most people but correspond with my mother in Spanish.  \nIs there any way I can get autocomplete on my iPhone to work for words in both languages?\n\nA: Yes, add another keyboard to you iPhone.  I did it with Russian, follow this website, pretty easy.\n\nActivating the keyboards is straight forward. Tap the “Settings” icon and then select “General”. Then scroll down and select “Keyboard” and then “International Keyboards”. There you will see the long list of languages available — simply flicking the toggle to “ON” will activate the keyboard.

So I updated my iPhone 4 to iOS6 today (using the built in updater on the iPhone). The phone did some stuff for a while and then rebooted with a progress bar which never updates. If I leave it long enough it reboots and then shows that bar again.\nAnnoyingly I have some stuff on that I didn't back up, is there any way to fix this? Even if I didn't care about the data on the phone, I can't get iTunes to do anything and the phone will just reboot to this progress bar screen.\nNot once have I had any error codes from iTunes. I'm more concerned with the data at this point and can probably force the device into restore mode once I have the files I need.\n\nA: Usually this is resolved by a second restore after you reboot your computer. Of course, you might wait things out if you don't have a backup and there is any chance whatsoever the phone will complete this update without risk of losing the data on the phone (contacts, app information, documents, etc...)\nTo be sure you (and I) haven't skipped a step, you will want to do everything on this page.\n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes: Restoring iOS software\nPay attention to the link at the bottom should you get there about putting the device into recovery mode.

If I have an iPhone running iOS 4 that I want to run iOS 5, but don't want to lose Google Maps by upgrading to iOS 6, is this possible?\n\nA: You can still download the IPSW files that contain iOS from Apple - here's a list of all of them. Just find the correct 5.1.1 file for your model.\nThe problem is installing that IPSW. The trick to make iTunes use a specific IPSW instead of downloading the latest from Apple is to hold option (shift on Windows) while clicking the Update or Restore buttons. There is a limit to how long Apple will allow installations of old versions (without using jailbreak-related hacks), so you'll want to try this ASAP.\n", "Q: Applescript to turn off Mission Control in OS X 10.7 I found most of the below on https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3046230?start=0&tstart=0, but I believe it relates to OSX10.6 (or earlier) given that Mission control seems to have replaced expose and spaces.\nI am looking to modify it to turn off all Mission Control functionality, if possible.\nI tried to modify it to tell \"Mission Control\" preferences but couldn't even get that far (One of the errors was \"Expected end of line but found application constant or consideration\"), so hopefully someone with a better grasp of Applescript / the objects available in OS X 10.7 can help me out.\ndo shell script \"defaults write com.apple.dashboard mcx-disabled -boolean YES\"\ndo shell script \"defaults write com.apple.dock workspaces -bool NO\"\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n      tell expose preferences\n            tell spaces preferences\n                  set spaces enabled to false\n                  set spaces enabled to true\n                  set spaces enabled to false\n            end tell\n      end tell\nend tell\n\nquit application \"dock\"\n\n\nA: This disables the main Mission Control screen (⌃↑), but not spaces or the application windows screen (⌃↓). It also makes switching to a space with windows for an application stop working.\ndefaults write com.apple.dock mcx-expose-disabled -bool true\nkillall Dock\n\nYou can disable Exposé and Spaces by removing or disabling Dock. But it also disables full screen windows, the Notification Center sidebar, the application switcher, Launchpad, and Dashboard, and makes the desktop backgrounds gray.\n\nA: Try this:\ndo shell script \"defaults write com.apple.dock mcx-expose-disabled -bool TRUE && killall Dock\"\n\n", "Q: How do I download photos from Picasa to the iPod Photo Library for offline viewing? I do not have Internet where I stay, so I want to download all of my photos in my Picasa album to my 32GB iPod for offline viewing. \nHow would I do that?\n\nA: If you have a computer, download Picasa 3.9 for Mac/PC and use its batch downloading features. Then, in iTunes, connect your iPod, click Photos, check Sync Photos from:, and click the dropdown menu to reveal Choose folder... and navigate to ~/Pictures/Downloaded Albums/xxxxxxxxxxxxx/albumname/ (with xxxxxxxxxx being your Google user ID number and albumname being the album you wish to import to your iPod). Sync and finish!\n", "Q: What is preventing an OTA update to iOS 6 on an iPod touch 4th gen? I have iPod Touch 8GB 4th generation version. I got a notification that iOS 6 is available for the iPod. I have downloaded new iOS 6 but it's not getting installed. \nWhen I select Software Update -> Install now, it shows \"Verifying update\" and then it shows me \"Software Update Unavailable, Software Update is not available at this time. Try again later\".\nI don't understand why its shows me such message though the update is already downloaded. \n\nA: To avoid rendering your device unusable due to a bad upgrade file, iOS does some verification of the download before installing (likely some type of checksum to ensure the download wasn't corrupted and it's for the right device, etc.). Given that your install process fails during the verification process, it's likely that you either got a bad download (possible, although it should try to re-download if that's the case), or the authentication and verification servers that the installer needs to check against are having some problems (not unlikely, given the load they've had since iOS 6 came out).\nBest advice is to just wait it out and try later. However if you're impatient, you can directly download the update to your computer and update via iTunes (although if the servers are experiencing issues, it might affect this method as well).\nSteps for a direct update\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to this page and download the proper file for your device.\n\n*With your device connected in iTunes, open the device page, hold down option (shift on Windows) and click the Update button.\n\n*An Open File dialog should appear. Browse to the .ipsw file you downloaded in step 1 and open it.\n\n*Your software update should begin normally.\n\n\nA: iOS 7 isn't available on iPod touch 4th gen, so either way it work. It's available on 5th gen though.\n", "Q: Downgrade iPad 2 from iOS 6 to iOS 5 using DFU mode I want to downgrade my iPad 2 from iOS 6 to 5.1 because Maps is useless. I read articles saying that you need to have saved the SHSH blobs to be able to do so, which I didn't, but I haven't seen any article talking about DFU mode. Has Apple restricted the use of DFU mode? Previously, I was able to downgrade an iPad using DFU mode, even if it's not officially supported. Note that I do not want to jailbreak my device. Thanks.\n\nA: DFU is something built into the hardware, so the iPad 2 firmware could modify this, but I would presume it's even lower level and not something you can change. There are no reports that iOS 6 has stopped DFU, so it's very likely something else has happened.\nI don't think Apple ever has released an iOS DFU article, but there certainly hasn't been one for the last two or more years, so I don't think that has changed either.\n", "Q: Error while Compressing the Mail DB: file is encrypted or is not a database I am trying to compress the Mail database by running the sqlite3 vacuum command. But I get the following error:\nSQL Error: file is encrypted or is not a database\nI was running Mac OS 10.6 and I upgraded to 10.7. Now, it's running 10.7.4. I found that the Mail data folder is placed under the folder ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData\ninstead of ~/Library/Mail/MailData on my machine.\nSo I use the following command:\nsqlite3 ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/Envelope\\ Index vacuum\n\nA: You should just move that file to trash and re-start Mail.\nThere is a 'PRAGMA integrity_check' option, but why risk a bad index, the file will be rebuilt when Mail senses it's missing.\n", "Q: Why is my iOS 6 device missing all iTunes Match playlists?

Here's what defaults says:\n$ defaults read com.apple.screencapture\n{\n location = \"/Users/jogloran/Desktop/Screenshots\";\n}\n\n\nA: Works for me quite happily.\n\nHave you restarted UIserver?\nkillall SystemUIServer\n\nDoes the path exist?\nUPDATE: If the screen capture cannot find or write to the designated folder, it will default to the current user's desktop.\n", "Q: What solutions exist when apps don't download or update on iOS 6? I've been having a problem with installing and updating apps after upgrading to iOS 6 on my iPad (3rd gen). When I click the Install or Update button the button, it turns inactive with \"Installing\" word on it, while the app's icon on the SpringBoard says \"Waiting\". \nI tried even buying a new app, but it is exactly the same. Deleting the app and trying again doesn't help. What's interesting the problem doesn't seem to affect my iPhone 4S.\nI noticed several people at Apple Support Communities are affected by this, too.\n\nA: I had the same problem and after none of the other suggestions worked (changing date/time, shutting down and restarting), I went to Settings > iTunes & App Stores, then clicked on Apple ID > Sign Out.  After signing back in, I was able to start downloading apps again.\n\nA: I've been fighting with this for several days now, and I think I finally cracked it.  Check your iTunes Downloads (iTunes->More->Downloads) in iOS for stuck downloads.  I had a music video that appears to have been gumming up the works.  \nHere's the official Apple KB article covering this:\n\n\n*\n\n*TS1583 - iTunes Store: \"Error (-50)\" when downloading purchased content\nPrior to pausing that download I had tried rebooting, logging out of iTunes and all the other suggestions on lots of other blogs/sites/forums.\n\nA: There are a couple of things that you can try to resolve this issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*delete the stuck apps, sign out of the App Store, sign in back again and try installing again\n\n*delete the stuck apps, turn on Airplane Mode for about 30 secs, turn it off and try installing the apps again\n\n*stop or delete any remaining iTunes downloads. This worked for me. I've been downloading quite a few songs from my iTunes in the Cloud and some of them got stuck. It was not until I deleted the stuck and remaining iTunes download that app downloads would resume.\n\n\nA: Before you deleting apps just try powering off the phone and then on again - worked for me - so glad I didn't delete the 17 apps that were stuck and then have to go and find them all again!\n", "Q: Why scutil always try to modify system network configuration I set a global sockets proxy via 'Settings'-'Network'.\nThen scutil always tries to revert my setting, then prompt a dialog to ask my password to allow this change. I can cancel it, but it will be popped up in few seconds.\nDoes anybody know why scutil wants to do it? And how to forbid this change forever?\n\nA: It looks like it's a bug of Lion Mountain, and it has been fixed by Apple.\nThe dialog won't appear after updating to 10.8.2.\n", "Q: Downloading apps stuck after updating I just updated my iPhone from iOS6 beta 4 to the final release, I restored via iTunes.\nI made an iCloud backup right before doing this, seeing this is what iCloud is for I figured I didn't need to backup using iTunes.\nThe restoring process went fairly smooth, but after I started restoring from iCloud the problems begun, restore my settings took almost 2 hours, even though the Time Remaining said it would only take 45 min.\nOnce my iPhone booted up all my apps popup up, waiting to be downloaded, now I'm not sure what they're waiting for, but they've been waiting for hours.\nI noticed a few apps started downloading, I also saw a few apps which downloaded very quickly and then just got removed from the screen ...\nNow one app is just stuck on \"loading\", preventing other apps from starting.\nI've already tried all the solutions given online, but nothing is helping.\nAnyone else experiencing this?\n\nA: Yes, the answer is simple. \nYou are downloading something else like songs from iTunes match.\nOpen the Music app, click on store and after that on transfers and you will see what is delaying the apps.\n", "Q: Can I delete the content of \"~/Library/Mail Downloads\"? Since I have to use Outlook from now on (policy of my employer), I have deleted all my accounts in Mac Mail. Nevertheless, there are a lot of files in the folder \"~/Library/Mail Downloads\". Why aren't they deleted as well? Can I delete them manually?\n\nA: This directory is used to temporarily store attachments you open from Mail.app. They should be deleted automatically when you close the attachment. However, if you open an attachment, edit it and save it, then (in my experience at least) the attachment will tend to remain in that folder. Not all apps cause this (e.g. some Apple apps ask you to duplicate the attachment), but some do (MS Office seems to be a culprit for me). You can certainly delete these files manually now, although you might want to check you haven't accidentally saved something important there.\n\nA: Yes you can delete them. Attachments that you download are stored in Mail Downloads. If you don't value your stored attachments, you can delete the contents of Mail Downloads.\n", "Q: Access Time Capsule from Android phone Can I access the contents of the \"Data\" folder on computers other than Macs? For instance, can I access the Time Capsule from my Android phone?\n\nA: What do you mean by \"access\"? If you mean editing files and/or copying files to and from Time Capsule, you might not be able to do that since the hard drive in Time Capsule is formatted using Mac Journaled file system. If all you want is to view files, some Android apps might be able to access the device over network.\n\nA: The Time Capsule (and external disks connected to an Airport) supports AFP and SMB protocols. If your device supports either of these you can access the HD.\n\nA: access the time capsule - easy. load file manager hd ( play stor - free) and use the menu to create a new lan  connection. top menu in upper left / network / create. input details and you're done.\n\nA: use x-plore app to acces files on time capsule hdd\n", "Q: Can I remove or hide the VIP Folder in Mail on iOS 6? Is there anyway to remove or hide the new VIP folder in the native Mail app on iOS 6?  I use lots of filters on my Gmail backend and have no use for it.  \n\nA: There currently is no way to disable the VIP folder in Mail. The best you can do right now is to move within the Inboxes section of the Mailboxes screen on Mail.\nAll Inboxes appears pinned to the top position, but each Inbox and the VIP Folder can be arranged in whatever order you please (but not deleted)\nTo drag the folder\n\n\n*\n\n*open Mail\n\n*go to the Mailbox view\n\n*tap on \"Edit\" and move the folder to where you want it to be among the other Inbox entries.\n\n\nPerhaps if enough people give Apple feedback we will be able to suppress VIP entirely or at least move it to below the accounts section in the Mailbox view to bury it at the end of the line.\n", "Q: Can songs be added to an iPhone library without using a computer or the iTunes store? I wish to use my iPhone without having a computer. \nHowever, the iTunes music store is not available in India. So, is there any way for me to directly add music to my iPhone Music app without using a computer? I do not want streaming solutions, or any 3rd party apps to store the music.\nI couldn't find any way to do this, but thought I'll confirm here once.\n\nA: You can’t do that without jailbreaking. Even with jailbreaking, the apps are so buggy or expensive that I won’t recommend anything.\nYou have to use iTunes to sync music to your iPhone because you don’t have the Music Store in India.\nThe second best thing you can do is use third party apps to store music.\n", "Q: HTC software for mac As I understand there is no official software to work with HTC phone on the mac.\nSo how can I manage my phone contacts, create backups of my phone and so on?\n\nA: A few links for you (unfortunately, there aren't any free options out there)\nThe Missing Sync ($29.95)\nBy Mark/Space, this software allows you to do just what you described to manage your phone contacts (with Address Book), calendars, text messages, music, video, notes, etc.\nBut as far as their website goes, they don't support backups.\n\nMy Backup Pro ($4.99)\nMy Backup Pro is not a Mac application; it can be found on Google Play.  Quite simply, it is backup software that allows you to backup online or to your local SD Card.  Note that it looks like they have a free version for rooted devices.\n\nNote that you can always try doing the tasks these paid applications do yourself by connecting your phone as a filesystem to Mac:\n\n*\n\n*On the phone, go to Settings > Applications > Development > ...and check USB Debugging.\n\n*Connect your phone and tap USB Connected > USB Debugging Connected > Mount > ...and tap Mount as Disk Drive > Done\n\n", "Q: How do I get  spell checking to work in Google Chrome?

The same issue exists on about 90% of the sites I visit. \nHow do I get it to work? Is there any another spell checking system for Google Chrome?\nUPDATED:\nSpell schecking works only for Russian. All settings are English (global system settings and on context menu).\n\nA: Chrome has its own built-in spell checking - which I consider more correct when spell checking multiple languages in the same document (I specifically use English and German).\nYou can enable it in: Chrome Preferences → Show advanced settings... → Privacy → Use a web service to help resolve spelling errors\n", "Q: How force launchd not to look into subfolders with QueueDirectories parameter in launchd.plist I'm processing images put into specific folder.\nFor that I run script with launchd.plist put into ~/Library/LaunchAgents\nEverything work smoothly. But I want put resulting files into subfolder of that folder.\nFolder is not empty, it has subfolder, so my script is run over and over again every 10 seconds.\nThere is nothing to process. But launchd runs script ten times a minute wasting resources.\nHow can I hide from launchd subfolders in folders from QueueDirectories parameter?\nFilenames are arbitrary so I can't use WatchPaths parameter.\nI believe parameter like maxdepth should exist.\nAny solution?\n\nA: QueueDirectories won't work anyway, because it'd trigger on the subdirectories themselves whether or not they had any files in them. The mere existence of subdirectories in the watched directories will trigger the script.\nInstead, you should use WatchPaths on the main directory itself -- whenever a new image file is added to the directory, the directory is modified, so WatchPaths will trigger your script to process the file. Moving the image file will modify the directory again, but since it happens while your script is running it won't trigger a rerun.\n", "Q: Clipboard survives a reboot. Is it secure? I noticed that things in my clipboard survive a reboot - love it, very convenient. But I'd guess that's written to disk, and if I had physical access to your machine, I could reboot it and access the file the has the clipboard contents in it. It's gotta be secured in some way, right?\n\nA: You are correct that this information is not secured. This is a very common scenario across most apps on the system when you don't see the keychain dialog to access data. Luckily, there are simple countermeasures you can enact to secure your information. \nPlacing a password on your account so that it does not log in upon a reboot will protect your clipboard and all other files on the disk from an idle snooper.\nNext, establishing FileVault encryption on the whole drive will stop almost all amateur and some professional attacks as long as your passcode isn't available or guessable. \nLastly, a screensaver lock and timeout will reduce the window of a sleeping or unattended Mac can be snooped on without knowing your account password. \nThere are also apps that clear the clipboard on timed intervals if that truly is your only security worry. \n", "Q: How do I read show notes while playing a podcast in the iOS Podcasts app? I can’t figure out how to view show notes in the iOS Podcasts app.\nPreviously, I could just tap on the album art in the now playing screen, and it would display the show notes just like lyrics to song. But now, tapping the album art brings up a tape deck.\nWhere from can I read the show notes?\n\nA: 1. Tap on an individual subscription or \"Unplayed Episodes\":\n\n2.

I have a scanned PDF document on an iPad 2 (iOS 6) that I need to rotate but cannot find any easy way to do this. How would I engage such an endeavor?\n\nA: A lot of PDF viewers on the iPad allow rotation of PDF files. An example would be GoodReader which is a good app to have anyway if you need offline access to PDFs etc. To open a PDF in GoodReader e.g. from Mail use the \"Open with...\" button.\n\nA: You can download an APPLE App Store called Bluebeam Revu. I believe you will have to pay for this. Once you port your PDF over to the app, you will need to select the square icon that has 4 boxes. Your PDF will appear to the left and will be a smaller version. You then can take 2 fingers an rotate your PDF to the position you want. Then you can select the icon at the top to email it back to yourself. I select \"flaten and email\". This works great and is very easy. I hope this helps.\n\nA: Use this free online website, it worked for me using one drive as a file holding medium, you could also try using google drive for this. \nhttps://www.rotatepdf.net\n\nA: PDF Splicer is a very good app for that. It's free.\n", "Q: What can be done to make my Mountain Lion Mac drops connection to my Cisco router less often? I have a Cisco wireless router WAG54G2 Annex A plus Cisco Extender RE1000.

It seems that when I reset the main router and extender consequently I need to wait a bit before I reconnect with my Mac. That why they can both hook up and the MBP gets connected properly as well. So the initial commentator @duci9y was right on that. \nThe reason why the main router gets kicked of the network very often is another issue. I'd say an ISP issue. Looking into ways to troubleshoot this now.\nUpdate II\nGot kicked of the network (wifi) again and saw this:\n9/22/12 10:24:56.000 AM kernel[0]: wlEvent: en1 en1 Link DOWN virtIf = 0\n9/22/12 10:24:56.000 AM kernel[0]: wl0: Beacon Loss Event\n9/22/12 10:24:56.000 AM kernel[0]: AirPort: Link Down on en1. Reason 4 (Disassociated due to inactivity).\n\nSo somehow I lose the connection due to inactivity? But I am online and doing stuff??\nUpdate III\nDeleted all known networks - read in an Apple thread that this could help and I go reconnected again\nUpdate IV\nI am using \n\nping route get default | awk '(/gateway/){print $2}'\n\nto keep the connection allive. Found the suggestion here at the Apple forums. \nUpdate V\nStill lost my internet connection. Wifi did survive. I could no longer ping the main router. So perhaps this is again connected to the extender not being able to stay connected to the main router. After I briefly turned off wifi on my MBP and on again I got reconnected.\nUpdate VI\nDoing some tests without the extender now. Just to see that was the culprit for real.\nUpdate VII\nWas having an OK wifi connection for about an hour without the extender and then got briefly disconnected due to \"inactivity\" again:\n9/22/12 12:44:36.000 PM kernel[0]: wlEvent: en1 en1 Link DOWN virtIf = 0\n9/22/12 12:44:36.000 PM kernel[0]: wl0: Beacon Loss Event\n9/22/12 12:44:36.000 PM kernel[0]: AirPort: Link Down on en1. Reason 4 (Disassociated due to inactivity).\n\nVery odd as I was downloading stuff using uTorrent. Seems like the main router can no longer be found for a while. After a couple of minutes I get reconnected again most of the time, but it is really annoying. Makes me think it is not the extender, but the router kicking me and or the extender out every now and then..\nUpdate VIII\nUpdated router to Firmware Version:V1.00.19 . Let's see if this improves the connectivity\nUpdate IX\nAll seems to be doing better. Did have one issue getting kicked out this morning, but will keep on observing for now. Other input is always welcome!\nUpdate X\nHad several cut-offs this morning with and without Extender:\nSep 25 10:11:48 jaspersmbp kernel[0]: wlEvent: en1 en1 Link DOWN virtIf = 0\nSep 25 10:11:48 jaspersmbp kernel[0]: wl0: Beacon Loss Event\nSep 25 10:11:48 jaspersmbp kernel[0]: AirPort: Link Down on en1.

Your wireless card lost contact with the router and gave up.\nwl0: Beacon Loss Event\n\nIf you can, change your beaconing rate on the router to be faster (and slower - sometimes the opposite of the intuitive thing is the answer). Also you should run the Wi-Fi Diagnostics tool which resides in /System/Library/CoreServices and monitor the performance of your setup. This will let you see the signal and noise so you can pick a channel on the router that loses the beacon the least often. There is a lot of data here, but the most important number is the txRate. It is how well your radio can talk to the router radio. All other measures end up reflected here. If you have bad signal, or bad noise, this goes down. The higher you can get the transmit speed, the less likely you will lose the beacon.\nIt could be just that the Mac hardware doesn't like the beacon pattern of that router and in the end you pick up an Apple router (or another one) - but you should be able to try some more things and perhaps make this better.\nIgnore the sandboxing errors - sandboxing would prevent all operation, all the time and not lead to an intermittent failure.\n\nA: I'm not sure this thread is still active or not but thought I'd put in my experience and research as this came up on a search for solutions. I'm not a power user and yet I'd like a shot at answering this question. The answer I have is: \"Nothing can be done.\" I have had a Cisco Valet M10 - not a power router but all I need - which has worked wonderfully to link my MacBook Pro (late 2011), printer (HP Deskjet Wireless 8500 All-in-one) and a small, mini HP (Windows 7) until I upgraded to Mountain Lion. It also works great with my iPhone 4S running v. 6.2. I just chatted with Linksys and was told that their technicians are working on upgrading to Mountain Lion but had no product at present that works with that OS. Well, here's what happens to me. First, it bumps my printer off-line and I cannot get it to connect. I go to the printer and reconnect to the router then just as soon as I try to print, the printer goes off-line. I don't use the little mini PC so don't worry about it. On my computer itself I keep being bumped off as well. I go up to the wireless icon at the top toolbar and when I left-click on it, it says it's searching for a network. I click on mine and it says it's on and I can work on-line for awhile before it kicks me off again. It's usually when I try to go to a new tab or website. Eventually, Safari just gives up and freezes. I'm not sure Apple gave out to peripheral vendors the specs nor gave them enough time to adjust, but that is simply my opinion. That statement however, I feel is justified because there are so many programs and apps that I use that do not have an upgrade to work with Mountain Lion. I, too, wonder if I should go back to a Windows-based computer. But I've spent way too much money on changing to a Mac in terms of programs for Macs, etc. Think I will try my little mini PC and see what happens there. \n", "Q: Mounting Ext3 filesystem with OS X 10.7.4 I'm trying to mount an Ext3 external USB hard drive in OS X 10.7.4. I installed OSXFUSE (with macfuse compability layer), which worked fine. After that I tried to install EXT2FS but the install processs always aborted.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: I have successfully used Paragon's ExtFS driver in OS X Mavericks (and Mountain Lion previously) with full read/write access. This has worked for me with ext3 and ext4 file systems.\nMy only concern would be if you are mounting your Linux root (or any other system root) and you are therefore able to touch sensitive files (/etc/ comes to mind) that may stop working (Linux does not boot, etc) if the wrong permissions get applied. The solution to this is to mount read-only but I cannot say that Paragon's software really has that as a built-in option. The default mode (as is with OS X in general, except for the built-in NTFS driver) is read/write.\nAlso, do not expect performance in any case. I tried to use my external drive with iTunes and the performance was intolerable.\n", "Q: Software for design 3D graph I'm looking for a software for designing 3D graph (graph with x,y,z axis).\nI found OmniGraphSketcher but it seems that it allows me to design only 2D graph.\nI don't want to use Matlab because my graph will not be a \"mathematical\" graph. It would be a graph with text and not dots or line or numbers.\nI have to do something like the picture below but in a professional way.\n\n\nA: Have you tried the built-in Grapher app in /Application/Utilities ?\n\nA: Have a look at the following Software for visualizing X,Y,Z Data as a 3D Scatter and 3D Surface graph:\n\n\n*\n\n*IGOR Pro\n\n*QtiPlot\n\n*R\n\n*Graphing Calculator\nThese are for the most part scientific tools, so don't expect any friendly UI. There are some other tools for *nix and Windows, but the you have to use Wine, Crossover or some VM to use it.\nThere is also 'ChartDirector' - a Script for PHP, ASP, JSP etc. for usage directly in HTML.\nBut I am still wondering: if all you want to do is put in some Text on a chart with 3 Axis, wouldn't it be easier for you to draw the graph by hand? \nYou could Illustrator, InkScape, Sketch or Gliffy\n", "Q: Is there a way to install/hack iMessage onto Lion/10.7? My machine (MacBookPro2,2) doesn't support 10.8 and I would rather hold back on doing the upgrade (possible with hacks). So is it possible to stay on 10.7/Lion and get iMessage working?\n\nA: Since the Messages beta has ended, it is no longer offered for download on the website however the download link direct to the .dmg still works:\nMessages beta direct download.\nI don't expect this to continue indefinitely.\nA more permanent option would be to try and copy the Messages.app from a Mountain Lion install on another computer to your OS X Lion applications folder. Let us know if that works for you.\n", "Q: App Store, iMacs and Macbook pros I made the mistake of using my personal app store account when setting up my school's computers.  Of course, there didn't seem to be a choice... now that I've done that, how do I permit the users of each of the computers to use their own app store accounts to run updates?\n\nA: I would just sign out of your account and set up the correct account on each Mac. Open the App Store and see what updates are available. Any admin user can run normal updates and then you can see what purchases (if any) are on the wrong account. \nYou may have dodged a bullet if only system updates were done as they don't get tied as a permanent purchase. Even so, the cloning process means only one Mac registered for the iLife suite and you can wait for advice from Apple if that decision can be reversed if you'll just use one of the other accounts to update two machines going forward. \nAsk a second question or edit this with more details once you've tried this on one test Mac to see what else needs fixing. \n", "Q: How do I search for a mouse that uses Mac's built-in bluetooth? There are lots of wireless mice out there that work with Macs, but most require an extra USB thingy that takes up a USB port on my Macbook (and most Macbooks have few USB ports). What search terms should I use to look for a wireless mouse that uses Mac's built-in bluetooth?\nP.S. I am looking for alternatives to Apple's Magic Mouse.\n\nA: These search terms: bluetooth mouse, os x\nMost Bluetooth mice work well with OS X.\n", "Q: iBook G4 opening procedure (for hard disk replacement) I am about to replace the hard disk of an iBook G4 (a 12\" 1.33 GHz model) with a SSD. The guides I find online, such as this one, describe a rather long procedure where both the bottom and top covers of the case are removed. However, the disk itself should be accessible from the top. Is the removal of the bottom cover really required? And, if so, why?\nEdit: yes, it is necessary. To remove the top cover, you must unscrew the power plug, and the screws for that are accessible only from the bottom.\nAnd when guides talk about weak soldering of the power connector, well, they are right. Now I must boot my iBook with a screwdriver (I insert it in a hole I made in the case, to make a contact in the right place).\n\nA: Yes, it's necessary. Apple's designs aren't simple, and you need to keep track of the screws and which one fits in which position. Some of the screws feed into other components on the other side. Taking the bottom off is the easiest part! I once had a unit in where someone turned their computer over to \"their next door neighbor, who knows all about computers.\" After he was done, they couldn't get a disk to load in the optical drive. I took it apart and he put a long screw in the wrong place and drove it right through the optical drive.\nThis might sound stupid, but you might want to print out each page where he's taking screws out, and when you take them out, use masking tape to tape them onto the position in the diagram they came out of. If you're not used to working on these units, it's very easy to put the wrong screw in the wrong place and either end up with a part that's not secured or driving the screw right through something else.\nIf you think an iBook is complicated, try replacing the optical drive on a 12\" PowerBook G4 sometime. :-o\nHope this helps.\n\nA: You probably won't have the leverage to disconnect the cable or the space to get to the screws that hold the drive in place without taking both sides off.\n", "Q: Dual 27\" Thunderbolt How can I set up a dual Thunderbolt on a 2012 Mac mini server? I daisy chained them but the second stays black. \nDo I need a Thunderbolt to HDMI adaptor, from which vendor, how can I not lose resolution?\nOr does this setting work only with the non-server Mac mini with the AMD Radeon HD 6630M graphics card?\nhttp://www.apple.com/macmini/features.html\n\nA: You need the 2.5 Ghz Mac Mini, which indeed also comes with an AMD Radeon HD 6630M instead of the integrated Intel HD Graphics 3000 on the 2.3Ghz model.\nFor a list of models that support up to two Thunderbolt displays connected, check this support article over on the Apple website:\nThunderbolt ports and displays: Frequently asked questions (FAQ) \n\n\n*\n\n*14 - How many Apple Thunderbolt Displays can I use with my Mac in OS X?\n\n", "Q: How can I change my Apple ID password on my iPad 2? I just upgraded my iPad 2 to iOS 6. I am trying to access the App Store for the very first time ever (trying to get the free iBooks app). It keeps telling me I'm using the wrong password. I did not enter a password during the upgrade to iOS 6.\nI think the problem has to do with the fact that the original password I entered (in iOS 5) is still stored somewhere on the iPad 2 because, using my notebook computer (not a Mac), I can sign on to Apple ID maintenance site using the new password I set up there.\nI tried setting my Apple ID on the web (via my notebook) to the one I think is saved on my iPad 2, but it says it's not complex enough (it had two identical characters in a row).\nHow do I change the Apple ID password that (I think) is stored on the iPad 2?\nI have made a few changes to the iPad settings, but not many because I am just starting to use it.\n\nA: Go to settings > iTunes & App Stores > Apple ID: Select sign out, that will clear your stored password...Then you can enter the proper information.\n", "Q: How do I install applications from a .dmg file? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I install an application from a disk image? \n\nI just got my first Macbook Pro yesterday and one of the first thing I did was to download and install Mozilla Firefox web browser onto my laptop. After I dragged the firefox icon to the application folder, everything was fine except I was left with a \"Firefox 15.0.1.dmg\" file that I didn't know what to do. \nI experimented with it and tried ejecting the \"disk\" and dragging it to trash and emptying it. After I did that the Firefox icon on my dock went black and there was no response when I clicked the FireFox icon on my dock. \nSo I had to redownload and reinsintall everything to make it work again. \nAre these dmg files stuck in my computer forever? My download folder is getting unnecessary big\n\nA: A .dmg file is kind of like an USB stick in a file and can be handled more or less the same way. To install from a .dmg file you usually do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*double click the .dmg to make its content available (name will show up in the Finder sidebar), usually a window opens showing the content as well\n\n*drag the application from the .dmg window into /Applications to install (may need an administrator password)\n\n*wait for the copy process to finish\n\n*eject the .dmg (by clicking the eject button in the Sidebar)\n\n*delete the .dmg from Downloads\n\n", "Q: How can I recover when my iPhone isn't responding to touch when using Guided Access on iOS 6? Is there a recommended solution for when Guided Access fails to respond to triple-click of the home button?  I set this up for a kids app for my son, and despite triple-clicking the home button several times, I am failing to get a response to prompt for my guided access pin number.\nI tried holding the power button, and several other options, all to no avail.  Is my only option to let the battery die out?  Will that even fix the issue?\n\nA: Seems like a solution is to hold home button + volume down + screen lock until device forcibly reboots.  After that, guided access began responding properly again and I was able to exit the app.  \nEdit:  Through trial and error, I felt this was home button + volume down + screen lock, but as comments  have noted, volume down is not necessary.\n\nA: I've had better luck quadruple clicking.\n", "Q: logger vs syslog -s What exactly is the difference between using logger and syslog -s? According to its manpage, logger provides interface to the system log module, but I can't really see the point given that syslog(1) seems to be just that, only much more powerful.\nIs it just a matter of simplicity or am I missing something? And which one would you recommend for simple scripting?\n\nA: syslog is more powerful than logger which also means that logger is easier to use for simple purposes. The man page indicates as much:\n\nman logger -> Logger provides a shell command interface to the syslog(3) system log module\n\nThe main advantage of syslog -s for simple logging is sending log lines to a different computer to have it logged there. For simple shell scripting that's probably not needed.\n", "Q: Why can't I press \"return\" to see all pages in Preview on Mountain Lion? On OS X 10.7, I could press the Return key while in preview to see hundreds of little thumbnails of the pages in a pdf document. I can't show you a screenshot now, since I'm not running Lion, because in Mountain Lion, this feature seems to be missing. I used this feature for navigating through long books. For example, if I read a few chapters on another computer, I can remember the page number (or general location), then I can press Return on my Mac, and scroll through the book to select the correct page. I'm guessing there's an easier way to do this now, or that at least Apple gives us the option of turning the thumbnails feature back on. If not, I will be seriously pissed.\nAnyone know about this? Can I activate the little thumbnails some other way, or is there a better way to do it (and I really don't want to use the sidebar, it kind of sucks).\nThanks for your help.\nUpdate: The accepted answer is great, but with Apple's latest update, you can now just press Return to see the thumbnails of the pages, and press Return again to go back to \"Continuous Scroll\" mode. So if that's not working, you probably just need to update OS X.\n\nA: Try Opt-Cmd-5 to get the same effect in Mountain Lion.\n", "Q: How do you cancel 1000's of iTunes Match downloads on the iPad without swiping each one? I accidentally asked iTunes to download all my music from match to the iPad. There are 2500+ songs in the queue now and they won't download before my flight tomorrow. The music downloads are blocking more important app upgrades.\nI can't cancel each one individually since it would take hours.\nHow can you cancel all downloads in one go?\n(iOS 6)\n\nA: I just have the same exact problem. It's a bug in iOS. If you go to iTunes App on your iOS device, you will see a Downloads section. There you will see all pending iTunes Match downloads. It's a pain if you have thousands of songs to delete them from this download queue one by one. So here's how to squash this bug.\nYou absolutely don't need to reset your phone and go back to square one or email iTunes. Spare yourself the trouble. Here is a simple fix.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings > iTunes & App Store > iTunes Match\n\n*On that screen, turn iTunes Match off.\n\n*Tap your Apple ID on that screen and tap Sign Out. (I don't know if this is necessary but it works anyway. Just an added precaution for this to work.)\n\n*Restart your iOS device (Hold down Sleep and Home button for about 5 seconds until it goes black and the apple logo in a black background appears).\n\n*Go back to iTunes Store > Downloads and voila they're all gone. All those pending downloads are reset. And your iOS device won't download anymore of those songs unless you tell it to.\n\nA: I had the same problem with  iOS 9. I mistakenly asked my iPhone to download 4,000 tunes and could not stop it. The apple genius (online chat) was not able to help me. I eventually found a solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Music app\n\n*You should have a grey bar monitoring the downloads near the top of the screen, tap on it\n\n*Here you can see all the downloads - do not manually try to cancel all the downloads one by one, this would take too much time\n\n*Scroll down until the end of the list\n\n*You should see the \"cancel all downloads option there\" (a shame: it should rather be visible on the top of the list)\n\n\nA: You'll have to email into iTunes and request they be removed from your pending downloads queue, otherwise you'll be there for quite some time trying to cancel items from your queue.\n\nA: This happened to me today. I disabled iTunes Match and enabled it again. That replaces the music library completely hence resetting the download queue.  I have iOS 7 and ipad mini \n\nA: If you need to fix the problem right away, you can perform a full reset of your phone, but do not restore from a backup, otherwise you'll be back in the same situation. Instead, set up as a new iPhone. A pain, I know, but you'll have your phone back in some kind of working order a lot quicker, and can then re-download apps, media etc. at your leisure.\n", "Q: Why doesn't Apple Maps find an address that contains a suite letter? I live in a duplex, and my address is of the form <Suite Letter>-<House Number> <Street Name>. When I search for my address in the new Apple Maps app, it only seems to locate my street, dropping the pin at some arbitrary location. What's going on?\n\nA: Turns out the Maps app has trouble parsing some address formats. In my case, the address on my contact card was formatted as in the question: <Suite Letter>-<House Number>, with the letter and number joined by a hyphen.\nThis seems to cause the Maps app to simply ignore the letter/number. Reformatting my address to remove the hyphen (<Letter> <Number> or <Number> <Letter> both work, but to be precise in my case I moved my suite letter to the second address line) resolved the issue, and I can now type Home in the search box, pick my contact info, and get the correct result.\nOf course, some streets simply lack detailed geographic data so that Maps doesn't know where each address is along the street. In my case, it was a formatting issue, but in many cases it is simply a lack of detailed data on a block by block basis.\n", "Q: I forgot my Encrypt Local Backup password. How can I start over? In iTunes (Windows 7) Encrypt local backup is checked, and I can't remember the password. I don't need to restore my iPad; I just want to be able to back it up. If I attempt to uncheck this, iTunes prompts for my password. How can I start clean (without losing any data from my iPad, which has not been upgraded to iOS 6)?\n\nA: From Apple Support:\nWarning: If you encrypt an iPhone backup in iTunes and then forget your password, you will not be able to restore from backup and your data will be unrecoverable. If you forget the password, you can continue to back up and use the device, however you will not be able to restore the encrypted backup to any device without the password. You do not need to enter the password for your backup each time you back up or sync.\nIf you cannot remember the password and want to start again, you must perform a full software restore and when iTunes prompts you to select the backup from which to restore, choose set up as a new device.\nI assume it applies also to iPad, and yeah that's a terrible inconvenience for you, but at least it's a definitive answer from the source.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT4946?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\n\nA: *\n\n*Open iTunes preferences from the Edit Menu.\n\n*Click the Devices tab. Here you will find the backup for your iPad. \n\n*Delete it by clicking the Delete Backup button below the pane.\n\n*Now you can start over.\n\n", "Q: Error stating that I'm running an older version of Mail with a newer version of Mac OS X Mail.app stopped working on my Snow Leopard Mac after installing Security Update 2012-004 (Snow Leopard) (Post Date: September 19, 2012). Long ago, I moved Mail.app to a directory different from /Applications/ . At some point Mail.app got upgraded from version 4.2 (the one that came with the original installation discs) up to version 4.5, and it never got updated in my computer because the application was in a different directory - and it never complained until now.\nThis is the error message that I get when executing Mail.app:\n\nYou can't use this version of Mail with this version of Mac OS X.

Any ideas?\nUPDATE :\nI followed @BSDGuy's advice and managed to update Mail.app to version 4.5. But I'm getting the same error, except that now it's complaining about version 4.5! This is the error message:\n\nYou can't use this version of Mail with this version of Mac OS X. You have Mail version 4.5 (1084/1085). It can't be used on Mac OS X version 10.6.8 (Build 10K549)\n\n\nA: You can go to Apples web site and download the updates manually. The downloads site is:\nhttp://support.apple.com/downloads/\nOnce there, go to the \"Search Downloads\" \"10.6.8\" update. You can download either the combo (for people who haven't updated much) or the last, which was just for the 10.6.7 to 10.6.8. You might want to find specifically which update made the changes.\nWhat I would try is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move Mail.app back to /Applications\n\n*Perform the manual update(s) from the downloaded update\n\n\nIF the download allows you to go through the packages and you can find out which package mail is in (the names aren't always straight forward) you could probably do a manual update using only that package.\nThis might be risky, but you could try actually doing the full update on the system. In the PAST, you could do that and it would ignore any updates that superseded what's in the package or already installed and only install those components needing update. I don't write Apple's update software so that might be risky.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Solved it. Here's what I had to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete Mail.app from the directory where I had put it\n\n*Re-install Mail.app 4.2 from Snow Leopard's installation discs\n\n*Install Mac OS X 10.6.8 Update Combo v1.1 for upgrading Mail.app to version 4.5\n\n*Re-install Security Update 2012-004 (Snow Leopard). Now Mail.app is up to version 4.6\n\n\nMy problem was caused because Security Update 2012-004 didn't find Mail.app in the directory where it expected it, and anyway my Mail.app was out of date. Bottom line: it's a bad idea to move Mac OS X's default applications to non-standard directories.\n\nA: I was curious to see what would happen if I tried to update my own system, and also to see if the way they distribute the packages has changed. Here's what I found:\n\n\n*\n\n*I did a 10.6.8 update on a 10.6.8 system. I could not get individual packages out, it was just one package\n\n*The install essentially raced through, but took some time registering the components.\n\n*After the install finished, I checked the /var/log/install.log file and it's filled with comments like this sample shows:\nSkipping component \"com.apple.PackageKit\" (1.1.3-92.0.0-920000-*) because the version 1.1.4-93.0.0-930000-1 is already installed.\nSkipping component \"com.apple.QuickTimeImporters.component\" (7.6.6-1783.0.0-17830000-*) because the version 7.6.6-1790.0.0-17900000-1 is already installed.\nSkipping component \"com.apple.MDImporter.CoreMedia\" (0.484.52-484.52.0-4845200-*) because the version 0.484.60-484.60.0-4846000-1 is already installed.\nSkipping component \"com.apple.opengl\" (1.6.13-1.6.13-61315-*) because the version 1.6.14-1.6.14-61400-1 is already installed.\nIt did this for every package - in other words, it didn't install anything or overwrite anything.\nWhen the system rebooted, it was fine - no apparent change in anything.\nI think this might be a way for you to get your mail working. When it's done, check the install log, and see if it actually updated Mail.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I had the same problem. I solved it by moving Mail back to Applications and re-installing Security Update 2012-004.\n", "Q: Mountain Lion-password prompts How do I stop Mountain Lion from asking me to put in my password everytime I want to move/change folders/files etc? \nAn example is \"Finder want to make changes.

I just got a macbook pro and i am trying to figure out if I should create multiple users for my family or just share one account.  I like to keep all photos organized in one library and share access to music, videos, etc.  Right now we are sharing 1 apple id (although we have different iphones)\nThe issue is that if i want to use messages or other apps that are particular to a specific phone number then it would be nice to have each family member use their own solution.\nIf i setup different accounts on my macbook can I still share all of my applications and data (like iphoto library, etc) ?\n\nA: iTunes and iPhoto libraries are, unfortunately, built upon databases that are designed for only one user. Apple recommends the following workarounds, each with their own drawbacks:\niTunes music folders can be placed within a central location (such as /Users/Shared). Only the music files themselves should be moved to the new location, not the library files (the files located at /Users/yourusername/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media). You then point each library to this new location (through iTunes > Preferences > Advanced). The big caveat to this approach: when another user on the computer adds music to the library, your library won't automatically see it. You will essentially need to tell iTunes to scan the music folder manually each time for it to pickup the changes. This support article from Apple describes this entire process in great detail.\nWith iPhoto, Apple technically recommends placing the shared library on an external hard drive, but you should be able to use /Users/Shared as well. Once the iPhoto library has been moved, open each user's iPhoto while holding down the option key. This will cause a pop-up screen to appear where you can select your library's location. The major caveat to this solution: if you switch between user accounts and another user has iPhoto open on their account, iPhoto will prevent you from opening the library. Again, Apple has a nice support article to cover this in great detail.\n\nA: *\n\n*Resize your current partition and make a new one of 175 GB. Or you can store the stuff in the /Users/Shared folder. Your choice.\n\n*Copy your iTunes Library and iPhoto Library to this new partition.\n\n*After a successful copy, you can delete the originals. To test, I recommend just renaming them instead of deleting.\n\n*Open iTunes. It will be blank. \n\n*Open iTunes preferences. Open the Advanced tab.\n\n*In the iTunes media folder location field, click on change. Point it to your new library. You may need to restart iTunes to see the changes.\n\n*Open iPhoto. It will ask you which library you want to use, and the process is very straightforward.\n\n*Delete the originals if you want to reclaim the space.\n\n*Do this for all the different user accounts.\n\n*Done!\n\n\nPS: If the Shared folder creates permissions problems, as it is wont to do, try using the Partition approach and disable ownership on that volume.\nThis can create issues if members of your family have different tastes in Music. You are essentially sharing the whole iTunes library, not just your songs.\nEdit: I am receiving criticism due to my suggestion of using a separate partition instead of the Shared folder. Please note that it is just that, a suggestion, and it is up to you to decide which method to use. I suggested using a different volume as I personally have had less problems with it.\n\nA: its not really to hard to do is to create a Basic Shared Folder \nand then from there share your libraries between your accounts \nhere is specific info regarding iTunes library\niphoto is a little harder to do but here is how to!\nlet me know if there is something that is unclear, but this is how to do it properly!\n", "Q: Defining environment variables with launchd/launchctl There are different solutions regarding the definition of environment variables that are stored in the launchd process, namely over at StackOverflow and Superuser. How do these solutions differ?\n\nA: For the sake of clarity, I will refer to this solution as the static solution, the second solution as the dynamic solution,\nand finally this one as the launch agent solution. I am going to compare the static and dynamic solution with the launch agent one, respectively.\nThe static solution involves the editing of /etc/launchd.conf. This has the advantage, as with the launch agent solution, that the variables are set right at the login. Disadvantages are that\n\n\n*\n\n*the variables are defined for all users. The launch agent solution lets each user decide for himself. If one wants to define variables for all users with the launch agent solution, the shell script can be amended with a loop (and another file),\n\n*the definition of the variables in /etc/launchd.conf does not allow for things like variable substitution and such stuff (at least that is my guess, maybe it is feasible),\n\n*obviously, you need access to /etc/launchd.conf to pull the static solution off, with the other one you can put all files at accessible places, e.g. the launch agent in ~/Library/LaunchAgents/,\n\n*the variables are not available immediately after editing the file, as with the launch agent solution (but see below).\n\n\nThe dynamic solution is similar to the launch agent solution. Its disadvantage is that the variables are not available right after login, you first need to (re-)define them. To combine the dynamic solution with the other, imagine you wanted to set the variable FOO to the content of the variable BAR. You would fire up a shell, say the bash, and type\nlaunchctl setenv FOO \"$BAR\"\necho 'setenv FOO $BAR' >> ~/.conf.launchd\n\nThen FOO would be available in all applications started after this definition, and would also be defined right after the next login.\n", "Q: What might cause mouse and keyboard freezes after updating to OSX 10.8.2?

If there are things moving, you'll have to decide if you need to run a disk repair tool on windows or if someone may have moved folders or files or some other hardware issue is at hand.\nIt's likely this happened some time ago since if your phone had all the ringtones for months - iTunes wouldn't need to send them, but the restore made it need to actually send the file and now it's missing.\n", "Q: How do I unhide and remove disk mounts from Login Items?

The same happens with Trine 2.\nI don't know when it works or when it doesn't, just that it seems somewhat random to me. Could it have something to do with the graphics cards? Right now my battery is at 100%, and I'm connected to the charger, so I think the discrete card is the one powering the game. Could this be the problem? How do I tell?\nAlso, on each game's launcher, I select the \"2880x1800\" resolution.\nHere's Braid looking all messed up:\n\n\nA: Thanks @eternus for answering, but my issue was that for some reason, my computer doesn't always switch to the discrete card once I open a game. Restarting usually fixes the problem, but a more thorough way to solve it is to get this app called gfxCardStatus, which allows you to specify which card you'd like to use. You choose the \"Discrete only\" option before running a game, and it should work fine. Here's what it looks like running in your task bar:\n\n\nA: You can fix this with no extra apps by disabling \"Automatic Graphics Switching\" under the Energy Saver section of System Preferences.\n\nA: It sounds like the game isn't optimized for Retina Display, though it's odd that it sometimes works and sometimes not. Try setting the .app to open in Low Resolution. You can do this by right-clicking the .app file > Get Info and check \"Low Resolution\" option under the General section.\n\nA: If I could up vote @cidermonkey's answer, I would.

It boots up into Recovery Mode I think it is, and a window comes up saying 'Mac OS X Utilities' and has the following options:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Restore from Time Machine Backup\n  \n*Reinstall Mac OS X\n  \n*Get Help Online\n  \n*Disk Utility\n  \n\nNow I've purchased a copy of OS X Lion and it's attached to my iTunes account, and it was my understanding that going on the 'Reinstall Mac OS X' option would let me download Lion from my account onto the machine. However, when I click on it, I get a window saying:\n\nTo download and restore Mac OS X, your computer's eligibility will be verified with Apple.\n\nThis seems reasonable enough, and I click 'Continue' but then after loading for a few seconds, I get the following error message:\n\nAn error occurred while preparing the installation. Try running this application again.\n\nAnd then it sends me back to the Mac OS X Utilities screen where I have the 4 options again. \nDoes anyone know how I can resolve this?\nThanks\n\nA: Not every mac is eligible for an internet recovery:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT4904\n\nA: Menu bar --> Window --> Show logs (or something like that) may give more detailed information on what went wrong.\n", "Q: iPhoto failed to download After upgrading to Mountain Lion on my MacBook Pro, I noticed an update was available for iPhoto '11 (version 9.4)  I went to App Store -> Updates and it downloaded and than hung.  The message I received was\n\niPhoto failed to download - Use the Purchases page to try again\n\nI tried going through Purchases and get the same message.  I'm caught in the \"loop\" and don't know how to get out. Now there's a red letter message beside the UPDATE button that says \"An error has occurred\"...\nHow can I download this upgrade?   \n\nA: I had the same problem with a bunch of Apple apps. I restarted my computer a few times and they eventually went through. It has to be an issue on Apple's end because I had the issue on a brand new retina MacBook Pro with 10.8.2, and I don't muck around with any system stuff.\n\nA: I had the same trouble with downloading iPhoto 9.4.1 on my iMac running Mountain Lion.\nI kept getting download error and the red badge would not go away. I finally got the download to work by holding down the 'option' key and pressing the update button.\n\nA: I posted a long answer to my root cause on this problem in another question. I had a mirrored root drive with \"old\" versions of the apps on the mirror. Inexplicably, App Store was in a sense monitoring the Apps folder on there and became confused. Read it here Xcode failed to download. Use the Purchases page to try again\n\nA: I have tried almost everything it has been said on the internet to solve this annoying problem. None of them worked. Even Apple Support could not find a solution. But yesterday I have found the solution with the help of my luck.\nAfter download starts in App Store but before you see any error, before you see any turn back in download progress, click on the red button in the corner of the window and close App Store.\nDo not worry... You will not get any error message this time. Instead, you will see on Launchpad icon that it is still being downloaded. Just wait... Download will finish eventually and you will find its icon on Launchpad.\n\nA: Make sure your Mac OS is up to date. I was having these issues updating XCode and tried many of the solutions on SO, however, it took updating the operating system to fix the issue.\n", "Q: iOS 6 update problem: how to switch to Indian store? I just updated my iPad 2 to to iOS 6 yesterday. Today when I tried to buy an app the usual way from the App Store, I got the message \"Your account is not valid for use in US store. You must switch to the Indian store before purchasing.\" I am unable to update my old apps as well and am getting the same message. Any idea how I should switch to the Indian store? \n\nA: It seems there is some issue or may be because of security this happens with iOS 6. So nothing, just press on Appstore under settings. Press down the button with your e-mail on and choose \"view Apple Id\". It will automatically switch your store. \n\nA: If this is still an issue after trying what's been suggested, then try signing out and sign in again using your existing Apple ID. It will automatically shift you to the relevant store. I also had similar problems after upgrading to iOS 6, but now it's working fine. \n\nA: I too faced this problem after the iOS6 Upgrade. This worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Appstore\n\n*Go to Featured (scroll down to bottom until you see your Apple ID)\n\n*Click on Apple ID\n\n*View Apple ID\n\n*Enter your Password\n\n*Once you login it will say your account is transferred to the respective country.\n\n\nHope this solves your problem with updates.\n\nA: Message told me your account is not valid in the Indian store you have to switch your account to the u.s store before purchasing.\n", "Q: iPhone battery life: Siri or iOS 6? I updated my iPhone 4S to iOS 6. I suddenly activated Siri (because finally it comes in my language) and in this days I noticed that my iPhone battery life is less than previously.\nThis problem is due to iOS 6 (that maybe needs more power) or it is due to Siri? I have to say that I didn't used Siri in this days. So Siri consume battery even if I don't use it?\n\nA: The battery life in iOS 6 has been improved over iOS5 - the big thing will be Siri.\nSiri listens to your voice and then sends that information to Apple's servers, which sends it back to your phone. All this costs data and the use of the hardware to accomodate that.\nSo even thought the battery life has been improved, because you use more features that require more intense processing, you will find that your battery may reduce. In my case I find that I do not use bluetooth as much, so I turn it off when I do not use it.\nHope this helps:-)\n", "Q: Why do some apps not show up on the dock in Mountain Lion? I'm not sure if this was intentional, or if this is a problem, but when I open the App Store or Messages, they don't show up at all in the dock, but they run just fine otherwise. Why is this and how can I change this behavior?\n\nA: Here are some steps to fix problems with the Dock:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run killall Dock from a terminal\n\n*Log out and back in\n\n*Reboot the machine\n\n*Reinstall the apps affected \n\n*Try to create a new user profile \n\n", "Q: Is it possible to install Mac OS 9 on a VM? Recently I got hold of a Mac OS 9.2.1 retail CD and would like to test drive it in a VM.  Is that possible?\n\nA: SheepShaver will be your best bet. There's several tutorials laying around on getting OS 9 running in SheepShaver.\n\nA: All OS 9 capable machines run on the PowerPC platform, meaning that your VM software has to emulate that instead of the x86 platform.\nThese are pretty rare.  I know only of qemu which can emulate multiple platforms, and it is mostly suited for technicians.  I would go for a dedicated OS 9 emulator as suggested by https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/64963/3157\n\nA: Sheepshaver only runs 9.0.4  therefor Mac OS 9.2.1 will not work. because sheepshaver can only emulate a Macintosh 9600. Not a Power Mac G4 or G3 iMac or even a G3 Powermac \n\nA: it would not work in vmware/virtulbox but it would work in qemu manager\n", "Q: Buy a TV or a dedicated monitor I have 2012 model mac book air. At home i want to have a 22\"-24\" screen for work purpose. I was wondering if i should just buy a dedicated monitor or a 24\" flatscreen tv with HDMI input? My work is generally  related to coding with some photo editing of family photos and watching movies. Also, are there any specific points which i need to consider while buying the monitor/tv so that it is compatible with my air. \n\nA: Generally, monitors have a higher pixel density because they are intended to be viewed for closer up. I'd recommend an HDMI, DVI or Display Port monitor because of the generally higher sharpness and contrast and more accurate colours over TVs.\n\nA: Any device that takes HDMI as an input should work.\nIf you go for the TV option, it will also include speakers so if your Thunderbolt to HDMI converter sends out audio as well, it should go through to the speakers.\nThe best option is to go to a store and have a look at the different models. No all makes and models (both TV and screen) display colours equally well. Take some samples of what you would be working with and get them to display it on the screen to see what you prefer.\nAlso look at choosing LED over LCD as they use less power and tend to be better quality screens but can cost more.\n\nA: For actual coding work you will need to be able to read what is on the monitor.  Anything less than full HD is waste of money for this purpose.\nThen the question is about how close you will be to the monitor.  A 24\" might actually be too big if you want it in about 40-60 cm's distance because you will need to move your head too much if you need to see it all.\nThat said, any modern HDMI unit should be usable.  Buy the adapter and go down in the store and see what it looks like.  REMEMBER to disable any image enhancements designed to improve on a low quality tv-signal.\n", "Q: Can I map mouse mouse buttons 3 and 4 to control the system volume? Is it possible to map mouse buttons 3 and 4 to control system volume on a Mac? KeyRemap4Macbook doesn't seem to have the functionality, nor SizzlingKeys. I have them both. Is there some way to manually bind these buttons to control system volume?\n\nA: What kind of mouse? Is there a proprietary driver for it?  Kensington has a driver for their mice & trackballs that can assign their buttons.  Before I had  an effective Kensington driver, I used USB Overdrive. It works with a lot of multi-button HID devices. \n\nA: If mapping the buttons to perform key press F11 (volume down) and F12 (volume up)  doesn't work, then i'd suggest the following application.\nControllerMate (commercial ~$25 USD) it allows you to map almost any input device button from mice, non-standard and standard keyboards, and game controllers, to specific tasks (and they can be as complex as you want).\nThe image below is from their website and shows an iTunes Volume control created from their application.  For me this application blows USB Overdrive out the water if you need the features it provides.\n\nA list of known compatible devices is available from their website here if you want to see if your device is listed and supported.\nA demo version is available here\n", "Q: Can I use Google Sync (Exchange, Push) through Mail.app in Mountain Lion? I love using gmail through Google Sync on my iPhone because it supports PUSH through the Exchange protocol.\nSee: https://www.google.com/mobile/sync\nEssentially, they provide an Exchange compatible server through m.google.com.\nI would like to setup Mail on OSX To use exchange as well, but have not been able to set it up properly.\n\nA: No, you can't use Google Sync through Mail.app in Mountain Lion.\nGoogle's exchange server m.google.com is not a fully implemented exchange server. It just implements the ActiveSync protocol which seems to be a subset of the exchange protocol for mobile devices. See also this information on Google Sync: http://support.google.com/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=135937\n\nA: The problem is with Mail.app (not Google Sync), which does not suport ActiveSync. It uses Exchange Web Services instead, which must be pulled. \nThe options for push in Mountain Lion appear to be either use Outlook 2011, which does use ActiveSync, or configure Mail.app to use IMAP. GMail supports IMAP IDLE, which is the IMAP equivalent of ActiveSync push. \n", "Q: Uninstall non-loaded extension from Safari When opening Safari I get this error:\n\nNow I want to uninstall this extension, however it doesn't show up in the Extensions preferences:\n\nHow do I uninstall this?\n\nA: That doesn't look like an extension, but a SIMBL Plugin.\nThese can be found in the directiory /Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins, and you should be able to remove the SafariOmnibar.bundle from there.\n", "Q: What is the name of this button?

If you set the mirror desktop preference in system preferences, the resolution will change on the external display to match your macbook. \nI have a dell monitor with display port out and bought a display port to mini display port cable and it works great. There are adapters for basically any conversion, but I suggest a monitor with display port or mini display port because it supports higher resolutions, and it's the future obviously.\n", "Q: Where can I buy a replacement MagSafe female chip for my MacBook Pro? I am trying to find a replacement charging chip for my MacBook pro 5.5 (mid 2009).  I have looked on eBay and can't find them.

The disk spins up and the computer seems to be running, but the screen backlight doesn't light up and the computer is unresponsive. \nI've tried closing it for a while and opening it again; pressing option-cmd-esc; pressing the start button one or more times; pressing other keys randomly. None of these resolves the problem. The only response I get is that sometimes pressing keys gives the \"ping\" error sound that the Mac produces when you hit an inappropriate key when a dialog box is open.\nMy rough guess is that this has been happening about once a week or so, but I haven't been keeping close enough track to figure out if I've been doing something similar just before each time this problem occurs. \nHolding the start button down turns the computer off and then I can restart and the computer works fine again. But I sometimes lose the unsaved portion of my work and reopening all the files I was working with can be time consuming. All in all, it would be nice to find a better solution than a forced restart.\nDoes anyone have any ideas about what might be causing this? Is there a way to recover without having to do a forced shut-down and restart?\nMy computer is an Early 2011 Macbook Pro Core i5, 8GB RAM running Snow Leopard.\n\nA: You may want to rule out a graphics card issue, which impacted select 2011-2013 MBPs:\nhttp://www.apple.com/support/macbookpro-videoissues/\nAnd if you haven't done so already, run Apple Hardware Diagnostics:\nhttps://www.lifewire.com/use-apple-hardware-test-over-internet-to-diagnose-problems-2259973\n\nA: i have the exact same problem, i think the only solution is a reinstall.\n", "Q: How do you restore the OS without restoration disks? Recently got a new macbook pro as an upgrade from an older macbook(white). I remember that there were restoration disks containing the installed OS in the packaging with the older machine. However, with the new machine there were no disks or any other storage media.\nIn the future, if I needed to reinstall the OS, would I be forced to buy another copy from the App Store? \n\nA: No, you do not have to purchase OS X more than once.\nIf you are referring to OS X Lion and Mountain Lion, both of which were distributed from the App Store, one purchase is enough for every Mac that you own or control.  (see Apple's EULA for this) Additionally, Lion and Mountain Lion have Internet Recovery, which means that a drive that fails or any new drive installed without OS X will be automatically connected to the Internet and installed with a fresh copy of your respective OS.\nAdditionally, Apple has their own Recovery Disk Assistant for making USB drives for physical media recovery solutions, or you can use LionDiskMaker. Make sure to read LionDiskMaker's FAQ (in the link provided),  as this answers crucial questions concerning the application's usage.\n", "Q: What is the best way to create a slideshow in iphoto across multiple events? I want to put together a slideshow but i want to use pictures across multiple events.  I see you can click on Slideshow on a particular event.  Do I have to copy these picture all into a new \"event\" just to do a slideshow on it ?\n\nA: Even easier: Make an Album of the photos you want to use in the Slideshow, and base it on that. This has a couple of advantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*It simply references the photos in the Events, and uses no ezra disk space, while keeping your Events intact\n\n*You can sort the photos manually, into any order you like, which you can't do with Events.\nTo make a new Album: select a couple of the pics and go Command-n; then drag the rest of the photos to that\nOr, shift-command-n to make a new empty album\n\nA: To add to the previous post, once you've created your album and it shows in your source list on the left-hand side, you would then select the album for which you want to create the slideshow and click on the Create button.\n", "Q: How to map a Keyboard Shortcut for Volume onto a mouse button? Real quick, I own a Macbook Pro 2010.\nI recently purchased a new Razer Naga mouse, and aside from using it for gaming, I've been adding various keyboard shortcuts into my mouse's side buttons. Whenever I try using the buttons to control my Macbook's volume and for controlling music play, I'm noticing that the buttons register as F7 - F12 rather than what I'm intending.\nI was wondering, would anyone happen to know the exact keyboard commands in order to control the volume and music playing?\n\nA: KeyRemap4MacBook worked with my trackball:\n<item>\n<name>test</name>\n<identifier>private.test</identifier>\n<autogen>__PointingButtonToKey__ PointingButton::BUTTON4, KeyCode::VK_CONSUMERKEY_VOLUME_UP, ModifierFlag::OPTION_L | ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L</autogen>\n<autogen>__PointingButtonToKey__ PointingButton::BUTTON5, KeyCode::VK_CONSUMERKEY_VOLUME_DOWN, ModifierFlag::OPTION_L | ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L</autogen>\n</item>\n\nSee the source for the key code values and predefined settings.\n\nA: Go into System Preferences > Keyboard and under the Keyboard tab, check of Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys, as in the image below.  Then, you can use the Rewind function as Fn - F7, Play/Pause as Fn - F8, etc (you can then map the buttons on your mouse to these).\n\n\nA: Karabiner Elements, which I use for keyboards anyway, can remap mouse buttons too.\n", "Q: How can i take facebook pictures and put them into an iphoto album? I see that once i put in my facebook credentials, i can see that when i go into albums it shows all of my facebook albums (when i drill into the album i see it then downloads the images).\nI can't seem to use any of these pictures for another album though.  I get the following error:\n\nAny suggestion on how I can include these photos into other albums, events, etc.\n\nA: Exactly as it says, you need to import them. Currently iPhoto is referencing them on the Facebook servers. So download them from there with your web browser and then import them to iPhoto.\n\nA: I found a very simple 2 step process to place facebook photos into iphoto.\nDrag the selected photo from facebook to your desktop.\nHave your iphoto open and drag the photo from desktop to the selected iphoto album. Boom done! If you don't want it to remain on your desk top, drag it to trash. \n", "Q: How does OSX assign disk numbers? I have four drives inside my Mac Pro.\n\n\n*\n\n*Bay 1: /dev/disk1s3\n\n*Bay 2: /dev/disk0s2\n\n*Bay 3: /dev/disk2s2 (also, my boot drive)\n\n*Bay 4: /dev/disk3s2 and /dev/disk3s3\nHow are the disk numbers assigned?  If I swap Bay 2 and Bay 1, will the disks in those drives swap disk numbers (so I have /dev/disk1s2 in Bay 1, and /dev/disk0s3 in Bay 2)?  Also, does it make any difference that the boot drive is in Bay 3 and/or that it isn't /dev/disk0s2?\n\nA: Drive numbers are assigned by the OS on a first come, first serve basis. The numbering scheme is as follows (with a capital N being a number):\ndiskN - always refers to a primary drive (i.e. the entire drive)\ndiskNs1 - always EFI\ndiskNs2 - First actual volume on the drive \ndiskNs3 - Second volume on drive, if there is one...this can go on for as many volumes as you have.\nYou can get some of the information about drives and volumes with the GUI version of diskutil by opening diskutil, clicking on the drive or volume, and then right-clicking on the item and then selecting \"Information\" from the dialog.\nAnother way is to open up a terminal window and type \"diskutil list\" and it will provide you with a list of all the drives, their partitions sizes and names (don't type it with quotes, though). If you want specific info about a drive or volume type \"diskutil info \" for example:\ndiskutil info disk0 OR diskutil info disk0s3\nThe utility will provide detailed information about each. I personally find using the Terminal.app a little easier because I can pipe the output to a file if I need to instead of cutting and pasting and it shows the relations of the volumes to the partitions a bit more clearly (IMHO).\nI wouldn't think that swapping the drives around in the bays would make any difference. On my development systems I can swap around firewire drives, take one offline, take the other offline, bring the first back up, and even though they get different drive IDs, if one is set as bootable it will remain bootable. Mac's use UUIDs to tag the drives which remain unique to the drive regardless of their disk assignment.\nThe firmware for a Mac Pro might allow a user to provision specific bays to be bootable. \n\nA: I would think so. I work on hard drives a lot on Mac systems, and with regard to at least external drives, the order they come up in never seems to matter based on where they're daisy chained in the system. In the world of removable drives, I think the UUID is the more important number. I would see no logical reason why OS X would attempt to apply something different for internal drives. Keep in mind that a lot of random events, such as temperature monitoring and adjustment of system are occurring at boot up, and these may interfere with the time each drive is probed and assigned an identity.\nI would think that for the most part, at least under generally average conditions, a boot sequence would be at least somewhat repeatable, but I've also seen drive ID's change periodically...and yet they continue to boot in the right order. If Apple was smart, and I think they are, they target the UUID not a drive designation such as /dev/rdisk0s3. In this day and age, particularly with systems that can be configured to boot off of an external drive by default even though an internal drive is present it has to be the UUID that's telling the system where to boot from. \nIf you've ever had a system that was defaulted to boot off an external drive and then remove it, the OS typically, at boot time, flashes a question mark and then \"hunts\" for another hard drive. If it finds one, it boots, if it doesn't, you either get a flashing question mark OR the prohibited sign.\nAn excellent source for information, albeit probably too technical for most system user is SCSC's book on hard drive troubleshooting. You can go to this site, go to the downloads section, and get the book called \"Hard Drive Troubleshooting\" (catchy name, eh?):\nhttp://www.scsc-online.com\nTheir book describes a symptom that occurs on many computers (eventually) called \"generic faults.\" A generic fault isn't an electronic component failure, it's actually a mechanical fault, such as cracked traces in logic boards, intermittent cable connections, etc. The intermittency of such a  problem can delay and possibly prohibit the recognition of drives in their \"normal\" order.\nAlthough SCSC touts their product Scannerz as being essentially useable by anyone, I think the product is likely best suited to technicians and engineers, or at least someone that has some understanding of hardware. In their book's advanced troubleshooting section, they talk about swapping out components the same way I change my shirt...most people know how to change their shirts, but not so many know how to cavalierly swap out a hard drive, particularly on a laptop.\nThe reason I say all this is that if your drive ID's are mysteriously changing their identities, you may have what they describe as an \"intermittent generic fault\" in their book, which is free by the way. Worth a look, anyway.\nHope this helps someone.\n\nA: I think the answers are overly simplistic in their assumptions (and thus draw conclusions which are overly generalized).\nThey don't specifically answer the question about how the bsd subsystem (adjoint to the hybrid XNU Mach microkernel) actually liaises with the boot-loader & in-turn the firmware initialization procedure below that.\n(The fact that IOkit offers dynamic rebinding of devices & name-spaces is -yes, of course! - a felicitous facility which undergirdes plug'n'play – but that outcome is a separate point from how the osx drive assignment protocol actually operates).\nIndeed there is at least one very practical case where the bsd device name – inherited from the firmware device tree (?) – has a very practical consequence: EG some programmes are configured to install on / work with the boot drive which is (somehow) canonically defined/hard-wired to be only the first internal volume enumerated at boot time!?  :( …\n… but if the user has a need to designate another (external) volume as the canonical drive0 (a requirement -aka restriction!- for some types of online backup software (ahem, Carbonite comes to mind hehe for instance) then having a precise understanding of how Darwin assigns drive numbers suddenly becomes vitally important!\nSo: if anyone knows how it's possible to coerce another volume into being 'blessed' as bsd0 (which is distinct from that volume's system folder being bit-flagged as a bootable device) then your insight wound be very much appreciated :)\n", "Q: How do I view my purchased movies and TV shows on my Mac? I have a MBP (2009 unibody) with Mountain Lion.  I have iTunes Match, iCloud, blah blah blah.\nNow when I open iTunes, I'm able able stream down my music but I can't stream movies or TV shows like I can on my AppleTV.\nWhen I go to movies or TV all I get is a screen telling me how I can visit the store.\nHow can I stream my purchased movies and TV shows?\nThanks\n\nA: You can stream small files like music but you can't 'stream' movies (huge files) from iCloud but any movie you have purchased via iTunes will be available through iCloud and 'pushed' to the device you are on. So for instance; you purchase a movie via your pc or mac through your iTunes account and then you pick up your iPad and go to iTunes Store, go to 'more' then purchased, click on your purchased movie from the list and you'll see your movie with a cloud icon. Click this and the film will be pushed to your device to view. But again it won't be actively streaming, rather it will be downloaded to your device! Hope this helps?\n", "Q: Is Game Center progress tied to the device or the account? I want to make a new game center account for myself, because I share one with my mom and brother.  Does it delete your progress in games if you do?\n\nA: The Game Center progress stays with the account, not the device so you would need to check with each specific application to see if they also maintain the game status and would propagate it to a new account or you would be starting over when it detects a new account has been added to the same device.\nThere isn't a general \"it always works this way\" established in the games I have tried. Some certainly have their own data servers and data structures so you don't lose progress without a game center account. Others depend entirely on Game Center and only the account stores any sort of progress and achievements so that all status is 100% cloud based and not reflected on the device as a permanent store of progress.\n", "Q: Al Jazeera sports application geolocation problems for iPad I have an app for Al Jazeera sports. I have a subscription with them on the app, and now I'm going to the USA to study and I need to watch the games on my iPad since I'll have no TV access when the games are played. Is there a tweak that I can do through iFile to trick the app to think that I am in the Middle East? It works if I change the IP address to a Saudi web proxy, but its not reliable, not always online, and becomes slower. If you want to test the application, you'll need to get it from a middle eastern Apple Store.\n\nA: If the Al Jazeera apps determines your location based on your IP address (which seems to be the case), the only way to circumvent this check is by using a proxy or VPN connection with an IP address in an allowed range.\n", "Q: Mountain Lion is stuck with \"See network administrator\" when joining Wi-Fi network I recently clean installed Mountain Lion to my mid 2011 iMac, and ran into a frustrating issue when joining my Wi-Fi network. All my other Apple devices have no trouble accessing the same wifi, except this very iMac. The typical error message is either \"See network administrator\" or \"Connection time out\"\nI did try to update the iMac to the latest (10.8.2 at the time of writing), and I still can't join the WiFi. \nOn the same iMac, if I reboot and boot into ubuntu Live CD, I was able to join the WiFi using the same internal wireless card. It leads me to think that something is off with Mountain Lion. \nThe router currently uses WPA2. I also did a wifi analysis and picked a channel that is least used by nearby routers.\nI also spent quite sometime doing research. I cleaned up the Keychain-access, and I removed and re-added the network within the Wi-Fi network settings. I also make sure that SSID of my router has no \"-\" or any other weird characters. I also reset my router a few times, but it didn't help\nThe iMac came with Lion, and the WiFi connection to the same router wasn't all the stable, but at least I was able to connect. With Mountain Lion, nada no dice, not even connecting once\nI am running out of ideas, and the current workaround is to rely on wired cable directly to the router. Or if I really want a stable wifi on this iMac, ubuntu. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. \n\nA: I faced a similar issue on my MacBook Pro with one particular WIFI connection. It was giving me the \"Connection time out\" error message.\nI was able to workaround it by:\n1) Removing the WIFI connection: System Preferences > Network > WIFI > Advanced > Select the relevant connection and click the \"-\" sign > Click \"Show All\" or close the window.\n2) Adding the connection manually: System Preferences > Network > WIFI > Advanced > Click on the \"+\" sign > Enter the connection settings manually.\nThis has worked for me and that particular connection never gave me issues afterwards.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: So it turns out the issue has to do with the incompatible router itself\nzyxel nbg-416n with the latest firmware appears to reject the iMac somehow.\nWhen I switched to another router d-link running openwrt, iMac connects just fine. So the solution was to switch router\n", "Q: Can the iOS 6 setup assistant be re-run a second time without erasing my iPhone? After upgrading my 3GS to iOS 6, I had to make an urgent phone call. Thus, when the iOS 6 setup wizard showed, I just hit \"skip\", \"continue\", and \"accept\" whenever possible.\nNow that the phone call is made and I have time to spare, I'd like to go through the setup again. Is it possible to restart the setup wizard (without having to restore my device and reinstall iOS 6)?\nIf this is not possible, which settings should I check and which steps should I take to make sure everything is set up correctly?\n\nA: If I recall correctly - perhaps others can help flesh out any missing details - the setup wizard primarily lets you sign in with / sign up for an Apple ID to use for iCloud, it asks you to agree to the iCloud Terms of Service, and it asks about setting up Location Services.\nAll of these can be accessed directly through the Settings app at any time. I don't believe you will miss any important functionality by missing the wizard, especially if you were previously using your iPhone with iCloud in iOS5.\n\nA: Go to Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings. After a reboot, you will be on the setup screen.\n\nA: Rather choose Settings > General > Reset > Reset All Settings. This will just reset all the customized settings and will not remove your data which the other answer will do.\n", "Q: Why has AirPlay to Apple TV stopped working from 3rd-party apps?

Even though I've explicitly set the Finder preference to display all file extensions, I'm still finding that some apps do not show the file name extension in their Spotlight result.\n\nHere are some examples.\nI'm running Mountain Lion.\n\n\n\n \n\nA: It seems this happens when Spotlight indexes the apps before the setting to hide extensions was in effect. You should try reindexing applications to resolve this issue.\nGo to the Privacy tab in Spotlight preferences and add the Applications directory to the excluded locations. This should remove all applications from the Spotlight index. Then remove it again from the excluded locations so Spotlight will reindex applications with the correct settings. After reindexing the \".app\" extension should be removed from all results.\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to: Finder > Preferences > Advanced\n\n*uncheck the \"Show all file extensions\"\n\n\nIt will solve .app issue immediately\n\nA: TL;DR\nBasically, it's a bug or bug fix introduced in macOS 10.13 High Sierra: Spotlight now respects the Finder setting to show file extensions. Disabling that setting removes the .app extension from Spotlight.\nFull-length answer\nI know this is a very old question, but I just had a déjà-vu in 10.13 High Sierra; different to this one but with some similarities, so I searched for it and stumbled upon this question and here's my answer:\nApps are in fact directories displayed as if they were a single file; Apple calls that a bundle (despite the Finder naming it \"Package\" as in \"Show Package Contents\" in the context menu). Not just applications are bundles, Apple uses bundles also for frameworks, plugins, application extensions, XPI services, certain kind of installer packages, as well as data storage format if stored data consists out of multiple files but shall appear as just one file (e.g. a RTF document with pictures can be stored as a RTFD bundle). Bundles always have a real name, the name of the file entry on disk. So if there is nothing else to display, macOS displays that name everywhere.\nHowever, bundles have a info file inside, named Info.plist, which contains all kind of meta data about the bundle. One thing such an info file can define is a Display Name. If such a display name is set, Finder will display the display name and not the real name of the directory. That is, unless the directory has been re-named, which the Finder can detect if the directory name does not match the bundle name in the Info.plist file. Well, I admit, it's a bit complicated. Let's try it with an example:\n\n\n*\n\n*The directory is named My App.app\n\n*The bundle name in Info.plist is My App\n\n*The bundle display name in Info.plist is My Cool App\nWith that combination, Finder will show the app as My Cool App.app (or just My Cool App if extensions are hidden). As long as (1) and (2) match in name, (3) is displayed.\nIf I now rename the directory to My Boring App.app, then Finder will display it as My Boring App.app since as soon if (1) and (2) don't match in name, (1) is displayed, as if the user wants his/her app renamed, of course, Finder should display the user chosen name, makes sense, doesn't it?\nComplicated enough already? Well, I'm sorry, but it gets even more complicated now. All values in the Info.plist that are displayed to users can be localized, so if your system is set to US English, the bundle display name may be My Cool App, but if the system is set to UK English, it can be My Amazing App. If a localization exists for the current system language, Finder will display that localization, but again, only if the names of (1) and (2) matches, otherwise (1) will win again.\nLocalizing is done by placing .strings files into bundles into sub-directories that are named <x>.lproj, where <x> can just be a language code, e.g. en.lproj for English, fr.lproj for French, etc. But in can also be language + country, like en_US.lproj, en_GB.lproj, en_AU.lproj, and so on. Inside is a file named InfoPlist.strings and this file can override the base values of the Info.plist file. If no matching localization is found, the values from the base localization are used (named development region) which is also defined by the Info.plist file. If no such localization is defined, the values from the Info.plist are used directly.\nSpotlight behaves like Finder, if (1) and (2) match in name (3) is displayed, either directly or from the matching localization. If (3) isn't set, (1) is displayed. But unlike Finder it does not always add the .app extension, even if requested in Finder preferences. I wasn't able to ever find the exact behavior pattern, but a certain combination of setup will prevent Spotlight from showing the extension, regardless of what you have configured. For some users it is fixed by changing the Finder setting and then running sudo mdutil -E / in Terminal (which re-indexes everything). But it's not working for all users, which may have something to do with the chosen language/region. \nBasically it's a bug. Either re-indexing fixes it or it can't be fixed. And the behavior was changed by Apple at some macOS release and stayed constant thereafter... that is, until 10.13 High Sierra. All of a sudden all my apps have .app extension in Spotlight, which matches my Finder setting, whereas in 10.12 Sierra no app had an extension in Spotlight, despite the Finder setting, unless I have renamed it or unless I had multiple copies of lying around.\n", "Q: How do I remove the \"Open With\"context menu items caused by VMware Fusion?

I'm european so I want to have 24h in my calendar and not AM and PM. How it is possible to enable that? I enable that for the hour of the computer, but this didn't changed the calendar...\n\nA: Under System settings -> Language & Text select the pane Region. You can set any format you want. Usually it suffices to change the region, e.g. from United States (12 h times with AM/PM) to United Kingdom (24h times). This influences all applications, also the calendar.

I understand that Steve Jobs tried to minimize the number of physical buttons on iOS devices, and I am sympathetic with that idea. It is understandable that the power button, which has to be accessible before the OS is running, has to be physical, and it also makes sense that the volume or mute/rotation lock buttons, which require rapid access, are physical. But I cannot think of a reason why the home button is physical. It is also known as one of the most fragile parts in iOS devices.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there anyone who can suggest a possibility of why the home button was designed to be physical rather than a touch icon or some gesture?\n\n*Why is the home button located on the front surface whereas all the other physical buttons are located on the sides? I think this is the ugliest part of the design of iOS devices.\n\nA: While no one can say for sure, unless Jony Ive joins Ask Different, I think there has been enough talked about in keynotes and other various appearances (D8, for example) that it can be reasons.\n\n\n*\n\n*(The Other) Jason's comment above hits the nail on the head. You feel the dip of the home button, and you know what it is. This also allows you to know which way is up. Because with an iPhone you'll feel a speaker grill, and on an iPod you won't feel anything.\n\n*The Power button isn't the only hardware button, because the home button is used for things like putting the device into DFU mode. This is done even after the device leaves the OS, so it has hardware-level functionality too. I'm fairly certain that the home button is a hardware-level button, I'm pretty sure I've turned my phone on via it before. Not to mention using it to reset the device in the few situations where I've locked the device up. The home button is not software level button, the volume buttons and ringer switch are the only ones.\n\n*Why would you want the home button on the sides of the device? Or top? That makes it completely impossible to meaningfully put to use, especially as frequently as we do.\nHold your iPhone normally, and then start to look at where your hand lies. My palm covers (the bottom) half of the right side, with my thumb at the top. There is a small gap, which happens to be where the SIM card slot is.\nThe top of phone: Headphone/headset port, noise-canceling auxiliary microphone, a small gap which would be a pain to push as frequently as we hit the home button, and the sleep button.\nOn the left of the device, all of my fingers cover most of the available room leading up to the volume buttons and ringer switch. And you also have to be considerate of those who are left-handed.\nSo what's left? A far corner of the device, or the back. The back would be an incredibly silly location, and having a small button in any corner would be massively inconvenient for someone.\nThe Home button is in a principle spot. It is dead center, large enough to wildly jab at and hit with very good accuracy, and ever present (well, duh). Good for either handedness, and even when it's docked. A quick push in the middle of the device resets your context, taking you to the home screen to move onto your next task.\nThere is no place on this phone that could better serve the home button's purpose. Period.\n", "Q: On/Off vs. Sleep Mode The new retina MacBook Pro is boot so quickly that if I don't use it for even 5 minutes it doesn't make a difference to me whether I shut the computer down or sleep it.\nWhat is the best option for computer preservation? Will a lot of rebooting in a day will ruin the computer?\n\nA: I really don't think it matters. I put my MBP to sleep all the time because I like always opening it to exactly what I had open before. There are probably plenty of arguments that you can extend its lifespan by doing something or other, but unless there's a defect or you drop it in the pool, it's going to be obsolete long before it wears out.\nAdditionally, on flash-based Macs (Airs and Retina MBPs) running on battery power, the default setting is to go into standby after 70 minutes of sleep. Standby is essentially hibernation - the contents of RAM are saved to flash and the machine is powered off almost completely.\n\nA: According to Apple's environmental report, Retina MacBook Pros use about 1W in sleep mode, compared to 0.3W when they are turned off but connected to a power source. They probably don't take Power Nap or standby mode into account though. Starting up after shutting down also requires more energy.\nWriting the contents of the memory to a sleepimage every time the computer is put to sleep might reduce the lifespan of the SSD.\nI don't know if frequent reboots would be harmful, but there are a lot of questions about it on Super User: \n\n\n*\n\n*Is sleep mode harmful for a computer?\n\n*Is it harmful at all when I shut down and unplug my iMac every night?\n\n*can you damage a machine by rebooting too often?\n\n*Will restarting the computer a lot (about 10 times in 2 minutes) damage the motherboard?\n", "Q: I chose the wrong partition to install Windows. How do I reinstall Mountain Lion? I've had my new Mac for less than a week, and screwed it up.  In trying to create a dual boot, I made noob mistake in choosing the wrong partition to format to NTFS for Windows (the partition with boot camp).\nThe good news is that looks like Mountian Lion is available in the AppStore for download.  The bad new is I don't have a Mac OSX to download.   I'm pretty sure the recovery partition still exists, but I don't know how to access it at this point.  What can I do?\n\nA: You can boot into Recovery Mode by following the instructions outlined in HT4718 and re-install OS X from there:\n\nOS X Lion or OS X Mountain Lion includes a built in set of utilities in the Recovery System. Restart your Mac and hold down the Command key and the R key (Command-R), and keep holding them until the Apple icon appears, indicating that your Mac is starting up. After the Recovery System is finished starting up, you should see a desktop with a OS X menu bar and a \"Mac OS X Utilities\" application window. Note: If you see a login window or your own desktop and icons, it is possible that you didn't hold Command-R early enough. Restart and try again.\n\n", "Q: Can't get past choose partition on Windows 8 boot camp install. Then can't remove incomplete installation So I got a new shiny sparkling MacBook Pro retina and Windows 8 just downloaded from MSDNAA. Reading success stories on the web that this runs even though Boot camp says Windows 7 makes me want to try it.\nI start the boot camp assistant and run through the wizard with all options checked, creating a USB installation media.\nDuring the windows installation I get to the point where I choose which partition to install to, but I get the error message \"Windows can't be installed on drive 0 partition 4\".\nYes, I have clicked on drive options and then on format, but I still get the same error message.\nNot getting anywhere I reboot back to Mac OS X and run the Boot camp assistant again with the hope of starting over and try again. The only availilable option in Boot camp is to remove Windows and restore the hard drive to a single volume. Fair enough. However, the computer only gets to \"Status: partitioning hard drive\" where it sits for hours (5 and counting). Computer still responsive, but boot camp assistant does nothing. I quitted the boot camp assistant, which it allowed without having to use force shutdown and without questions about whether I really want to quit the program during hard drive partitioning.\nOne annoying thing is that when booting the computer defaults to Windows, so I have to press the Alt key and choose the Mac OS X partition manually.\nAnyone who has any ideas as of how to\n\n\n*\n\n*get Windows 8 installation past the select partition screen?\n\n*get Boot camp to remove the Windows partition without freezing so I can give it another go?\n\n\nA: I got it (at least the parts in my question) working:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot\n\n*Reboot again\n\n*Run boot camp and remove old installation (this time it worked)\n\n*Reboot\n\n*Run boot camp and start Windows installation\n\n*At the choose partition screen, choose the boot camp partition, select Drive options, and then select Format.\n\n\nI wonder why it worked this time, but not the first.\nNow I get a error message of corrupt files however. Guess I have to download the DVD image from MSDNAA again.\n\nA: I didn't take the 'reboot, reboot, run bootcamp, reboot ... path. I did this instead: at that error message 'Windows can't be installed on drive ...', I just selected the BootCamp partition and clicked 'Format'. I got no feedback, but I chose next right afterwards and the Windows 10 installation continued normally.\n", "Q: SD card slot is always read-only I have a 4 GB Micro SDHC card and I use a Micro SD adapter sleeve to read it with the built-in SD card slot of my 15\" mid-2010 MacBook Pro. It's been a while since I tried to use it, but I just realized that my Mac will always treat it as read-only, no matter the position of the physical lock on the adapter sleeve.\nI can't even format the partition because all the options in the \"Erase\" and \"Partition\" tabs of Disk Utility are grayed out for the SD card.\nWhy is the card read-only, and more importantly, how can I write to it?\n\nA: I tried all other solutions but it didn't work. \nI have a Macbook Pro Early 2011 15\" (the line that has graphic card problem!)\nMy solution was to just push the card in as quick as I could possibly push!\n\nA: Slide the read/write lock to the middle neutral position and retry. I have the same problem sometimes...\n\nA: The problem spontaneously disappeared for me. I'm leaving this as an answer since it might reassure some people to know that for some random reasons, at some point, things start working again. However, I was not able to pin down a specific cause for it, so I'm not going to accept the answer, in case that at some point someone comes with a rational explanation.\n\nA: Since this issue involves MBP and read-only, the first idea I got is that: is this SD card formatted with the NTFS file system? As we all know that NTFS formatted drive is read-only for macOS. As the article Partition external drive greyed out in Disk Utility I've seen, it says NTFS file system is read-only on Mac computers. That's to say, you can't perform any input operation to this disk, including re-partition. So that may be the reason why the \"Erase\" and \"Partition\" tabs of Disk Utility are grayed out for your SD card.\nAnd to check this simply check the format of this disk in Disk Utility!\nIf it is formatted with NTFS, then bingo! that is the culprit.\nTo write to your SD card on Mac in this situation, you can either format it with FAT32 or exFAT, or you can find some NTFS driver for Mac like Paragon NTFS for Mac, iBoysoft NTFS for Mac, Mounty for NTFS, etc. if you don't want to erase this SD card.\nBut if this SD card is not formatted with NTFS and it is still read-only, you need to go further to :\n\n\n*\n\n*Solution 1: Format this external hard drive to exFAT/FAT32 with Windows PC\n\n*Solution 2: Run NTFS for Mac software on Mac\n\n*Solution 3: Fix read-only NTFS external hard drives with the command line\n\n*Solution 4: Change the permission of this external hard drive\n\n*Solution 5: Ignore Permissions on the external hard drive in the Finder\n\n*Solution 6: Repair read-only external hard drive with Disk Utility\n\n\nReference from :How to solve external hard drive read-only without formatting on Mac?\n\nA: @ Gordo’s answer (in toto)\n\nSlide the read/write lock to the middle neutral position and retry. I have the same problem sometimes...\n\nhas been codified and explained.  From bartech.tv's 2016 article Read-only SD cards on MacBook Pro? Here’s the solution.\n\nThe solution\nThe solution is, fortunately, very simple. Rather that pushing the write-protect switch all the way to the top, leave it somewhere in the middle. When you next plug the card into your MacBook Pro, you should find that you’re able to write files to, and delete files from, the card as normal.\nWhy does this work?\nIt may take a little bit of trial-and-error to get the right position, but in my case it was right around the middle, perhaps a little nearer to the top. Then, I was able to write files, and delete files as normal.\nAs to why this works, it’s probable that the little lever inside the MacBook Pro’s SD Card slot, which detects the position of the write protect switch, slowly degrades over time, either through continual use or a buildup of dust or fluff inside the card slot. Leaving the switch in the middle, therefore, fools the card reader into believing that it’s at the top.\n\nIt's possible/probable that the technique in @CharanBrahamandam's answer (pulling the whole card out slightly) also works because it happens to move the SD card's \"switch\" in the same direction as sliding the switch only from unlock to half-way in-between.\n\nA: In my case, a physical misalignment is causing the read only status. Gently pushing the disk away from the display reliably makes my cards write again.\n\nA: Is this problem for all your SD cards or just one. If just one, I would try formatting it in FAT from a PC and then trying that. \nI had a USB flash drive that I had installed a Linux distro on and it gave me similar issues on my Mac mini.\n\nA: According to one user on the apple discussion forum, resetting the PRAM should fix the issue:\nFrom Apple KB\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Shut down the computer. \n  \n*Locate the following keys on the keyboard:    ⌘+Option+P+R. You will\n  need to hold these keys down    simultaneously in step 4. \n  \n*Turn on the computer. \n  \n*Immediately press and hold the ⌘+Option+P+R. You must\n  press this key\n  combination before the gray screen appears. Continue holding the\n  keys down until the computer restarts, and you hear the startup\n  sound for the second time.\n  \n*Release the keys.\n  \n  \n  Note: Resetting PRAM may change some system settings and preferences.\n  Use System Preferences to restore your settings.\n\n\nA: The tricks above worked for me but less and less so. It feels like a hit and miss and can easily take me 10 tries.\nThis annoying problem has another potential fix. When I need to get my card into Read/write mode I can do this by taping over the slot of my card where the lock slide is. It does not matter where the lock slide is set to as it will be masked by the tape anyway. This works 100% of the cases. It does have disadvantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*potentially getting tape stuck into the reader (be careful)\n\n*need to apply it and take it off each time tape\n\n*might take the paper of any label sticker on the SD card off\n\n\nI’m actually going to buy a reader because of these disadvantages.\n\nA: Another thing to ensure when trying all these 'tricks' is to plug the laptop into a power supply. Because the card reader draws power if the battery is not delivering enough current to the reader it can cause issues.  For example, mounting of problematic USB hard disks can be resolved by plugging the laptop to the power supply.\n\nA: I regularly have this problems with my macs ...so I bought two card readers. One is an Advent one... but that wont let me write sometimes either. The one I have by Puremedia seems to have no problems though .. so I stick with that.\n\nA: Just simply format the card in fat32 format and the reformat it to ntfs that will fix the problem it worked for me XD\n\nA: Open Disk Utility, find and select the SD card, then click Repair Disk from the First Aid tab.

Then you can access it from the Finder either by selecting it in the sidebar window or directly via Cmd-K and entering the address vnc://IP-Address or vmc://Bonjour Name.local.\n\nA: Teleport (free)\nThis application allows you to use exactly what you have described; the mouse is 'teleported' to the other screen when moving to its edge. It finds computers using Bonjour and sends events over TCP. Note that it is a preference pane utility (found in System Preferences).\n\nA: If you've got an iCloud account, the easiest way to share a screen on Mac is to use Back to My Mac which is part of OS X and free. It can be a bit tricky to setup the first time you use it but once it's done, it's very convenient. Alternatively, there are plenty of free screen sharing apps for Mac that allow you to connect to any Mac anywhere and share the screen such as TeamViewer and LogMeIn. Hope it helps! \n", "Q: Import new photos from iPhone into Windows XP I'm on Windows XP and wish to plug in my iPhone and have all new photos imported into a folder on the hard disk. New photos I'm simply defining as those that it hasn't imported before.\nSimple, eh?\nThe default Microsoft Image Aquisition tool seems to read all photos rather than just new ones.\nAny ideas out there?\nIf I could see the iPhone photos as a drive letter I would write my own little application in Java, but this doesn't appear possible.  \nEdit: Found this similar question: here\n\nA: You can use dropbox to do this. Although dropbox is mainly a tool to administer files in the cloud, it recently obtained the option to automatically read and store in the cloud new photos from an attached camera/sd card/iPhone when it is connected to the PC. The data is stored in a special directory on your hard disk which is mirrored in the cloud.  When deciding to store photos in dropbox's cloud you get some GB (6?) of storage for free. Dropbox itself is free and you get the benefit of the cloud.  \n\nA: Use phone disk. It mounts your iPhone or iPod .... and can you give example of your applet code....\nThanks\nRaji\n\nA: I use GoodSync to keep two folders in 'sync'. So it will work if iphone/ipad can be visible as exernal usb drive in windows 7/xp.\n\nA: If you are willing to use third party programs you can try iExplorer or iDevice Manager\nThey both claim that they are compatible with Windows XP and can mount your iPhone as external storage.\nOnce it is mounted as external storage you can write your Java applet to copy/move your images from your \"external storage\"-iPhone to your local drive destination.\n", "Q: Is there a way to see which contacts are \"VIPs\" outside of Mail.app? Obviously, with Mountain Lion, users may define VIPs in Apple’s Mail.app. I would like to see which contacts are marked as VIPs outside of Mail – for example in Contacts.app (smart list??), or in Terminal. Is there a way to do so?\n\nA: Seems to be listed here.\n~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/VIPSenders.plist\ndefaults read ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/VIPSenders.plist Senders\n\nI only know how to narrow it down to the nested names in applescript. But you can use the applescript from terminal.\n/usr/bin/osascript -e \"tell app \\\"System Events\\\" to (get value of property list item \\\"Name\\\" of property list items of property list item \\\"Senders\\\" of property list file  \\\"~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/VIPSenders.plist\\\") \"\n\n", "Q: Download 4 apps at a time during restore from iCloud backup? I noticed that usually when you download multiple apps on iOS 6, it will download 4 at a time. I had to restore my phone from an iCloud backup twice in the past week. The first time it was only downloading one app at a time. The second time it began downloading 4 apps at a time but then switched to downloading one at a time again. I'm not sure if I did anything to change its behavior.\nIs there any way to have it download multiple apps again during this restore process?\nIf I try clicking on an app which says \"Waiting...\", it will say loading on both apps, but only the one I clicked on last will actually be downloading. The other apps progress does not change until the 2nd one is finished.\n\nA: This is normal behavior that you can't change. I don't know why, I guess it's just the way Apple wanted it to work.\n", "Q: Ball and Stick molecule modelling program for Mac OS Does anyone know any good programs for making ball and stick molecular models on the Mac? I'm looking for something to produce high quality 3D models with nice lighting, like this on\n\nfrom wikipedia.\n\nA: Try Avogadro. It's open source, and cross platform.\n\nA: Apple it self recommends some of them. VIDA by OpenEye and MarvinTools by ChemAxon provide 3D modeling. \n", "Q: Web Sharing (Apache) won't turn on in Lion I'm unable to enable web sharing via System Preferences > Sharing.  When I click it to turn it on the light turns yellow but then goes back to gray.\nI did some Googling and found that many people solved this problem by removing changes in their httpd.conf.  This is my ls /etc/apache2/*.conf*:\n/etc/apache2/httpd.conf\n/etc/apache2/httpd_ACSServer.conf\n/etc/apache2/httpd_devicemanagement.conf\n/etc/apache2/httpd_podcastlibrary.conf\n/etc/apache2/httpd.conf.default\n\nI tried replacing httpd.conf with httpd.conf.default but it didn't fix the problem.\n\nA: Check the Apache logs with Applications > Utilities > Console. Inside Console, expand /var/log to see the Apache2 log files. You might see a message in error_log.\nWithout any messages, it is a wild goose chase. Here, last time Apache did not log any messages it was the port 80 being occupied by another process.\n", "Q: Shortcut to open the Goto window in file open/save dialogues WITH the equivalent to path added When you have a file open/save prompt box open, you can hit the / key to open a GoTo dialouge to navigate via the file path. \nIs there a shortcut that does this action but automatically adds the ./\nie. hitting the shortcut would open a box looking like this:\n\n(where normally the period at the beginning is missing)\n\nA: You just have to delete the automatically added / in the beginning. The Go To box works from the current directory in the background.\nFor example if I open my home folder and press /, the Go To box opens with a / already there. If I want to work from the current directory (./), i.e., home, I just have to delete that /.\nNow, if I type ./Desktop and press enter, or just Desktop and press enter, the result would be the same.\n", "Q: Mail won't open after installing the security update for 10.6.8 I have seen other people with this problem, but their Mail icon was moved out of the applications folder. My Mail is and has always been in the Applications folder, so the problem is not that. I reinstalled the original Mail from the original Snow Leopard installation disk and then installed the system combo update, but it still won't open. I am at the end of my rope!\n\nA: After an OSX update (10.6.4, 10.6.6, 10.6.8 caused this issue to me) I had the same problem.  For the third time in 2 years.\nIf you're lucky this issue causes one hour wasted to reinstall from DVD, then re-apply patches hoping it will work the first time.\nNow if you're tired of this, I have THE definitive solution for you: install thunderbird (which will import your messages even if mail won't open !).\nLike with any other operating system it's best to keep operating system and productivity applications from separate providers to minimize risk of something like this happening.\nAfter you move to thunderbird you can move your mail history anywhere, even on windows or linux.\nIncidentally, this will also get you a more powerful mail client instead of mail which - besides the upgrade issues - is a really basic client.\n", "Q: Mountain Lion Crashing while hibernating I had one crash yesterday and one tomorrow on my iMac running mountain lion while the computer was hibernating. In both cases the computer restarted alone.\nThe messa is always the same: mountain lion your computer restarted because of a problem\nIn both cases I had an iPhone 4S attached on the USB port.\nThis

Thanks\n\nA: I discovered a solution: just turned off WAKE FOR NETWORK ACCESS on the energy saver panel. No more crashes.\n", "Q: Where are the older downloaded files on the Mac? It is very strange that I can't find older downloaded files, even though I upgraded from Snow Leopard to Lion and now to Mountain Lion, and it was done on the same partition.\nSo my ~/Downloads folder actually shows files all the way back to last October 2011.\nBut inside, there is no VLC-2.0.1.dmg, even though currently installed on my Mac, it is the 2.0.1 version.  So where could that file have gone?  I never delete downloaded files (because the hard drive has 100GB+ of free space so 20MB or 30MB isn't a problem).\nSo the major question is, where could that file have gone?  I used Spotlight to look for any file name with \"vlc\" in it, but only can find the app itself and a vlc-1.1.12.dmg.\nUpdate: by the way, I can find the file by using Google, for vlc-2.0.1 site:videolan.org but still would be interested to know where in the hard disk can it be?\n\nA: Open terminal. Type this (this is gonna be slow):\nsudo find / -iname '*vlc*'\n\nThis command will list all the files on all of your devices contains vlc in name.\n\nA: Files downloaded from Safari or Chrome usually have a kMDItemWhereFroms attribute:\nmdfind kMDItemWhereFroms==*\n\nIf you install an upgrade directly from an application, it doesn't usually download a disk image or at least keep it in a user folder.\n", "Q: Is it true for application that are installed by \"dragging\" into the Applications folder, it can be copied to other Mac? Many apps are installed by the \"drag it into the Applications folder\".  Is it true that usually, if you copy that app (which is a .app folder`) onto another Mac that you have that has the same OS X version or higher version, then the App should work too?\n(unless it is not supporting Rosetta apps due to backward compatibility).\nSome apps are installed by running a program, and go through the \"Where do you want to install to\", and \"Agree with Terms?\", etc, etc, and probably those apps can't be properly installed by just copying the .app folder to another Mac? \n(I need to do this because VLC 2.0.3 can't play some format of rmvb files, and I need to install 2.0.1 to another Mac and the downloaded file is missing, only the VLC.app folder is in the Applications folder.)\n\nA: Apps that are installed through disk images that simply ask you to drag the app file into your Applications folder usually create all of the files it needs to run (i.e. preferences, miscellaneous plists, cache files, etc.) on your first run.  So, yes, these kinds of applications can be copied to other Macs without a problem (unless, of course, that application requires a license and the license is asked for on first run and stored in a plist).\nApps that use Installer.app (.pkg files, usually) are different in that they have a bundle of files that they need to install in order to run (like Office for Mac).  Note that they, too, can create plists and preferences on first run, also.  You can see what .pkg files install by opening their Package Contents.  So, you are right, usually the apps that use .pkg files can't be run on their .app alone (you can't just copy Word.app to another Mac and expect it to work; certain frameworks need to be installed so that it can work).\nIn the specific case of your VLC download, which does not use a .pkg file should run just fine when copied.\n", "Q: iPhone 5 can't connect to Exchange server I have ActiveSync enabled on my Exchange 2007 server, and it works just fine with all the other iPhones (4S and below) in the office. However, I have two users who have just gotten iPhone 5s, and neither of them can connect to the Exchange server.\nActiveSync is enabled on their accounts (I checked), and I've tried clearing the ActiveSyncAllowedDeviceIDs property on their accounts so any device should be able to connect, but no luck so far. I've tried rebooting the devices (universal patch, huh?) but that didn't work either. Oddly, the devices seem to authenticate just fine, the account gets added to Mail without issue.\nI don't think it's an iOS 6 issue because I've upgraded my iPhone 4 to iOS 6 and I can still get my mail. Has anyone else encountered this problem?\n\nFollow up: Apple support couldn't provide a fix. They suggested importing the Exchange server's SSL cert, which I did to no avail. One user's account works on his iPhone 4S but not his iPhone 5 (yes, he is using two phones at once). The other two users don't have other devices using ActiveSync, and they have no other mobile device partnerships (I cleared the old ones when they upgraded their phones).\n\nA: I had exactly the same problem and it turned out that i had used 10 devices do remotely get my corporate mail and thats the limit in exchange.  Had to open the outlook web access portal and delete the old devices and it worked straight after that.\n", "Q: External monitor showing greenish shadow I've got a macbook pro 2011 and am using a mini-display to dvi adapter to hook up a ViewSonic monitor (Viewsonic VX2450WM-LED 24-Inch).  Problem is this greenish shadow showing up for certain hues of white, I'm not sure what it is or how to fix it.  \nI've tried multiple mini display to dvi adapters and DVI cables with no change.  As far as I know DVI is the best I can do on this monitor, and I've tried all the display color settings possible (including calibrating) and nothing gets rid of the hue.\nAny idea what causes this?  \n\n\nA: Determining the cause of display issues is generally a basic troubleshooting task, performing substitution on components until the faulty component is determined:\n\n\n*\n\n*replace cables (you've already done this)\n\n*use the monitor on a different computer\n\n*use a different monitor on the same computer\n\n\nIn this case, you've used a different monitor on the same machine and found that when using the same cables, the different monitor is not showing the color changes, therefore the monitor has the issue.\n", "Q: Link Contacts between Facebook and iCloud I have iOS6 and OSX 10.8. Both bring Facebook integration. It was smart enough for some of my contacts to merge (or \"link\") them. However for some on my iPhone I manually edited the contact card and linked to the facebook account. Not so bad.\nHowever, it seems that those manual changes were NOT replicated to my Macbook. For example, I have a \"Nathaniel B****\" in my iCloud but on Facebook he calls himself \"Nat B****\". On iOS I linked the 2 profiles, however on OSX they still appear as separate.\nAm I supposed to do something? Or is this a flaw?\n\nA: My suggestion would be to do ONE sync via iTunes and make sure your contacts are synced.  \nOnce you do that, your icloud sync will be the same from one to the other.  \nOR\nBackup your current Address book on your Mac.  Then, export from iCloud.com and import into address book.  \nOR you can use a third party app.  http://danauclair.com/addressbooksync/\n\nA: If you're using iCloud your Mac and iPhone should be syncing– that's the point of iCloud. Some suggestions I have read on syncing issues is logging out then back in on your computer (device that's not syncing correctly) and it should sync after that. Afterward, you may see duplicates in your macbook address book, which are easily resolved using the Card>Look for Duplicates. \nI actually had the same problem, just went in opposite order. Also, just in case it helps, you can merge two contacts in the mac address book if you have a duplicate with different info. Control + Command + | or Card> Merge Selected Cards\nHope you get it worked out, good luck :)\n\nA: I have the same issue, and when I link a Facebook contact with an iCloud contact on my iPhone, it's not synced on my Mac and vice versa; if I link a Facebook contact with an iCloud contact on my Mac, it's not synced on my iPhone...\nI think iCloud can't store the link you make with Facebook contacts because the  they don't appear in iCloud (try to find your facebook contact on the iCloud website, you will not). The link is done only in the local contact database and is not synced.\nI don't think it's possible for now to have this synchronization, and Apple should correct this- but maybe I'm doing something wrong.\nEDIT: I tried something new: on the Mac, instead of merging the two cards, I just filled some additional information in the Facebook contact (for example, the phone number of the iCloud contact); what it does is it creates a new iCloud contact directly associated with the Facebook contact and this time the sync works. On my iPhone, the contact appears with all the information as a unified contact!\nThis means that it is not the lack of Facebook contacts in iCloud, since iCloud is able to make this sync; the bug is more on the \"merge two contacts\" function in both the iPhone and Mac's Contacts app.\n", "Q: Can the iPad / iPad 2 handle iOS 6? I've heard anecdotal evidence of iOS 6 seriously impairing the performance of the iPhone 4 (and had a poor personal experience with it on iOS 5). I was wondering if anyone has had any problems upgrading older iPads to iOS 6. \nWe've got an original iPad and an iPad 2 and aside from not wanting to lose Google maps I'm worried that the update will negatively affect our devices.\nIs this worry backed up by reviews or experience of those who have upgraded already?\n\nA: I've been using iOS 6 on an iPad 2 successfully for several days. I would say that it hasn't impacted the performance at all. In fact, in a few areas (notably Safari) it is noticeably faster.\n\nA: There is no performance issues using iOS 6 on an iPhone 4 as per this post on the topic.\nYou can upgrade the iPad 2 (which has an A5 chip as opposed to the A4 on the iPhone 4) to iOS 6 but the original iPad is not supported. Details of supported devices and full functionality available on Apple's website.\n\nA: The short version:\n\n\n*\n\n*Original iPad, no.\n\n*iPad 2, yes.\n\n\nThe details also matter for some features, per http://www.apple.com/ios/whats-new/#compatible:\n\nThere's also the device specific features fine print:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn-by-turn navigation is available only on iPhone 4S, iPhone 5, and iPad 2 or later with cellular data capability. Flyover is available only on iPhone 4S, iPhone 5, iPad 2 or later, and iPod touch (5th generation).\n\n*Siri is available on iPhone 4S, iPhone 5, iPad (3rd generation), and iPod touch (5th generation) and requires Internet access.\n\n*FaceTime video calling requires a FaceTime-enabled device for the caller and recipient and a Wi-Fi connection. FaceTime over a cellular network requires iPhone 4S, iPhone 5, or iPad (3rd generation) with cellular data capability.\n\n*Offline Reading List is available on iPhone 4 or later and iPad 2 or later.\n\n*Made for iPhone hearing aids require iPhone 4S or iPhone 5.\n\n*Panorama is available on iPhone 4S, iPhone 5, and iPod touch (5th generation).\n", "Q: Can I wake up my Mac wirelessly over the internet? I am a university student who leaves his Macbook Pro at home and uses an iPad in lectures.\nI thought it'd be great if I was able to wake my Mac back at home if I needed to remote control it using TeamViewer from my iPad.\nMy Macbook is running Mountain Lion (Latest) and is connected Wirelessly to a Virgin Superhub.\nIs it possible to set it to boot from the university from my iPad so I can remote control it? If so, how do I set this up?\n\nA: OSX has a feature called Wake on Demand (Apple's version of Wake on Lan) which does work over Wifi but:\n\nWake on Demand requires an Apple AirPort Base Station or Time Capsule\n  with firmware 7.4.2 or later installed. To use Wake on Demand\n  wirelessly with a WPA or WPA2 network, the AirPort base station or\n  Time Capsule must be hosting the network.\n\nInstead you can use the traditional Wake on Lan, however this requires an ethernet connection (AFAIK)...\n\nA: You need something that can send the appropriate network packet to wake up the machine.  Apples routers (I have a Time Capsule) can proxy Bonjour-announced services while the machine is sleeping and can wake up the machine when the proxied service is accessed.  Apple also has a \"Back to my Mac\" feature, which I do not know if the iPad supports.\nI do not think you can do what you want with your combination of sleeping devices and router hardware.\n\nA: Perhaps iOS app Knock or Scany can make this happen.\nKnock requires Bluetooth 4, Scany requires quite some tech-knowhow.\nUnfortunately my mac is too old and my knowhow too restricted to check it.\n(I like to be able to do this as well).\n", "Q: How do 2 phones share ITunes and Calendar entries? My husband and I just got iPhones 4 running iOS 6, what we're looking for is to share ITunes and Calendar entries.  We have one computer and right now have Outlook for a calendar.  I want to be able to make one entry on the calendar and have it show up on both phones.  Can I use Outlook to accomplish this?  Or is there an app out there that will sync the computer calendar with both our phones?\n\nA: My fiancé and I do this quite regularly simply using the iCal app that is part of the phone. We logged in under the same Apple ID and shared only the calendar & contacts (on her phone b/c she doesn't need/want my email). Doing this, we're able to sync calendar and contacts, which is really useful if one of our batteries die.\nBut you want to use Outlook, it is possible with Outlook, but I think it requires an Exchange service to sync. I'm not 100% sure on that, but I am pretty sure that's what it takes (without manually syncing).\nI believe this post will be very useful for you :)\n", "Q: Macbook air colorful pixels on screen I see these tiny colorful pixels on my screen which (seemingly) do not go away.\nThe reason is probably me wiping off smudge with paper or whatever I had around the house.\nIs there a way to get them off? I don't want to try \"scrubbing\" any harder.\n\nA: There are two possibilities: dirt on the screen, and actual internal dead pixels.\nIf it's dirt on the screen, then since it doesn't sound like you've tried this already, I suggest water. Water will not hurt your screen, as long as it does not run down into a crevice and into the electronics. Use a damp microfiber cloth if you have one; otherwise, use a damp paper towel very lightly (paper towels can be scratchy). Most crud that you can get on a screen will wipe away easily with wet wiping; you do not need to scrub hard, and you shouldn't as this could scratch the screen or damage the internals.\nWhen I say “damp”, I mean getting the cloth wet under a faucet and then firmly wringing it out until it doesn't drip. Dry water off your hands so they don't drip either.\nOn the other hand, a colorful single pixel defect may well be a “dead” pixel. (Dirt on the screen typically doesn't look colorful except when it's fresh liquid droplets, which act as little lenses magnifying the pixels.) Typically, there is nothing you can do about these, but I have seen occasional reports of a dead pixel being restored by gentle rubbing. I would not recommend attempting this, myself.\n\nA: If the pixel is always there, i.e. \"on\", it is a stuck pixel.  Apple's quality control allows a number of these per square inch.\nSo if your Apple is new (or in the warranty period) and it has a couple of these you will not get an exchange for a new computer.\nIf it is out of warranty, you can try to \"massage\" the pixel while the computer is off and, keeping pressure on the pixel while booting up, stop the massage when completely booted up.\nThere are websites (mydeadpixel.com) and programs you can try that flash bright images.  These sometimes cure the problem, but only rarely.\nGoogle Fix-a-Stuck-Pixel-on-an-LCD-Monitor and you'll find a few more things to try...\nGood luck\n", "Q: How do I run a jar when I double-click it? So, I double click on my jar file and it just blinks a window with white screen then it disappears. After that, I right-click and select \"Open with jar launcher\" it is the same. too. I opened up Terminal and type java -jar \"System FRONT.jar\" then it opened up perfectly. \nI want it to be opened directly when double clicking it! How do I do that?\n\nA: You can prepend a short script to the .jar to make it executable via double click. In Terminal do the following:\n$ cat > header-template <<\"EOF\"\n#!/bin/sh\n\nexec java -jar $0 \"$@\" > /dev/null\n\nEOF\n$ cat header-template \"System FRONT.jar\" > executable_app\n$ chmod +x executable_app\n\nDouble-clicking executable_app should now launch the application.\n\nWhy does this work in the first place? Well, a .jar is just a .zip archive which gets unpacked and executed by java. And the zip format allows to prepend additional stuff in front of the actual archive. Any zip unarchiver skips this part until it finds the start of the archive (indicated by PK...).\n\nA: The best way to make a java gui application work with OSX is to bundle it as an application. This requires Jar Bundler.app which on Lion is at /usr/share/java/Tools/Jar Bundler.app. I think it is installed as part of Xcode but appears not to be in Apple's current documentation so might not now be supported. Old documentation is here\nThere do appear to be ant tasks to do this in appbundler which is documented in the Oracle JavaSE documentation.\n\nA: After long time efforts,I finally find the solution,that is ,to make your own Jar Launcher app:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Automator to make Automator Quick Action\n\n\n*Select Application\n\n*Look for the Run Shell Script action with Filter Finder Items  and add it to \nthe right.\n\n*paste scripts here like this below:\n\nI make some changes to make it better\nexport JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8`\ncd \"$(dirname \"$@\")\" \njava -jar \"$@\" \n\n\n\n*save this quick action as an app for example \"open jar.app\"\n\n*go to  /System/Library/CoreServices/Jar Launcher.app/Contents/Resources\nand copy JarLauncher.icns\n\n\n*cd to \"open jar.app\" you just made and paste JarLauncher.icns to \n\"open jar.app/Contents/Resources\"\n\n*edit  \"open jar.app/Contents/Info.plist\" and change key(AutomatorApplet to JarLauncher.icns):\n\n\n    <key>CFBundleIconFile</key>\n    <string>JarLauncher.icns</string>\n\n\n\n\n*now you can choose to open with \"open jar.app\" just like before.\n\n\nA: packr\nYou can use packr to package up your jar for easy distribution and double-clicking to open:\n\nPackages your JAR, assets and a JVM for distribution on Windows (ZIP),\n  Linux (ZIP) and Mac OS X (.app), adding a native executable file to\n  make it appear like the app is a native app. Packr is most suitable\n  for GUI applications, such as games made with libGDX\n\npackr has been discussed on Hacker News and is an open source project.\n", "Q: Is it possible to set Magic Trackpad option via Terminal? Is it possible to set the magic trackpad options with the menu topics: \n\n\n*\n\n*Point click, \n\n*scroll & zoom,\n\n*etc.\n\n\nby using the Terminal?\n\nA: You can use defaults to edit property lists.

I use this when I connect to my work Mac from my home Mac.  My work Mac's screen shows a big lock icon and a message while I'm remotely controlling it from my home Mac using Apple Remote Desktop (ARD).\nUnfortunately, there's a bug of some kind that causes the remote Mac's screen to stay locked, even after I've disconnected from it.  (Latest ARD and OS X 10.8.2 on both machines.) When this happens, I come in to work the next day to find the big lock icon and message on my Mac's screen.  Despite now being physically present in front of the Mac, I can't find a way to unlock the screen.\nI usually try ssh-ing into the Mac from another machine and killing processes.  I've tried killing the ARDAgent process, the screen lock process (I can't recall the name), and anything else I can find with \"ard\" or \"remote\" in the process name.  None of these things seem to unlock the screen.  Eventually, I resort to using osascript -e ... to tell all my running applications to gracefully quit, then I run shutdown -r now to reboot the machine.\nMy question: is there a way to successfully unlock a Mac that's stuck on the ARD lock screen, using ssh or otherwise?\n\nOne way to reproduce this: Log in to the target Mac with Remote Desktop, initiate Curtain mode, and then after finishing whatever work was to be done, log out the user on the target Mac while still under Curtain mode. This will leave the Mac inaccessible to the Remote Desktop app and even a physical user of the computer, with the large lock icon still on the screen of the target Mac.\nI'm not sure what I'm doing to trigger this situation, but I'm definitely not logging out.  Either way, it seems like the solution should be the same.\n\nA: For what it's worth, this is a known bug in ARD and has apparently been around for a while. This Apple KB has an article about it, but no suggestion on how to fix it. http://support.apple.com/kb/TS2401\nKey part of the document:\n\nIf you use Remote Desktop to take control of a client using Curtain mode, then log in or log out on the remote client, the control session will end and you will not be able to take control of the computer again until it is restarted. This occurs on client running Mac OS X v10.5 or later, and will also occur if you Lock the Screen of the client before taking Control.\nResolution\nBefore logging out, close any windows with sensitive information, end the control session (and Unlock Screen if necessary). Do not log out on the remote client while controlling it in Curtain mode.\n\n\nA: If you're on El Capitan, the above instructions involving killing the lock screen won't work.  There's some process that keeps starting it up and I was unable to find it using launchctl list.  I also tried to shut down ARD via my ssh login but that didn't work either.  Apparently the LockScreen.app and ARD are decoupled processes or something.  I wound up having to do a shutdown -r now to force a reboot.  I'm pretty pissed that Apple hasn't fixed this bug or provided a workaround that, you know, actually works AFTER the fact.\n\nA: Apple provides an example of how to script the lock screen in Chapter 9 of the ARD Admin Guide.\nAs you already have osascript access, I would send the unlock command.\n-- Start commanding the local copy of Remote Desktop\ntell application \"Remote Desktop\"\n  -- decide which list to perform this on, in this case it's called\n     \"WorkMac\"\n  set these_computers to computer list \"WorkMac\"\n  -- unlock the screen when finished\n  execute (make new unlock screen task) on these_computers\nend tell \n\n\nA: I can't reproduce your exact setup as I don't currently have a second machine running 10.8.2 and 3.6.1, but here's what I tried:\nFrom my 10.8.2/3.6.1 admin Mac I locked the screen on my 10.6.8 client, logged out of the client and reproduced the screen locking glitch. I was disconnected from my ARD session and the client remained with the lock screen icon.\nI ssh'd in to the client and after trying to get some love from 'kickstart' I ran launchctl list which revealed a 'LockScreen' job. Killing it without issuing a signal had no effect but sending it a -9 removed the lock icon from the screen and after a few seconds the loginwindow loaded. You'll have to try it under your conditions in order to verify this same technique works on a locked 10.8.2/3.6.1 machine and when the issue is caused by something other than the user logging out.\n\nA: OK, I cannot comment on using ARD, I don't have it, but this may be a suitable workaround, at least in the meantime.\nUsing normal screen sharing you have the option of using either the hardware display, or the virtual one.  This was an easy thing to use on 10.7 but it's been obfuscated rather on 10.8 and the menu item command to switch displays is gone.\nTo use the virtual display, here's what you need to do.  Firstly, have another user to your normal one that has the relevant screen sharing options allowed, then login:\n\n\n*\n\n*If no one is logged into the target machine, you will always get the Hardware display showing the normal login screen\n\n*If your the user you try to login as is already logged in, then it will always switch to that user and use the hardware display\n\n*If you login with another user who is not already logged in at the hardware display, you get the following message and the ability to use the virtual display which results in being able to do whatever you like without changing the main screen and with no possibility of anyone being able to watch it\n\n\n\nThis isn't perfect, you need to ensure your secondary user has the relevant access rights to the files and such that you may need to access, or you may have to adopt the awkward practice of leaving your secondary (or \"dummy\") user logged in when you leave the desk allowing you to use your primary ID over screen sharing, but it may help.\n\nA: Make a simple shell script like this:\n#!/bin/sh\n# Make ARD sane again\nLOCK=`ps -ax | grep LockScreen.app | awk {'print $1'}`\nARD=`ps -ax | grep AppleVNCServer | awk {'print $1'}`\nsudo kill -9 $LOCK $ARD\nsudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -restart -agent\n\n\nA: I don't have a Mac with ARD to test this, but this sunshine-ard utility suggests it can fix the problem. From a quick glance at the source code, it just sends a CFNotificationCenter message to quit the curtain mode.\nI'm not sure if there's a way to hook in to the ARD logout process to have this run every time you disconnect your session, but at the very least you could run it via SSH as necessary.\n\nA: This fastest solution I have found is to make a SSH connection to a admin account on the remote computer that is locked.\nssh \"adminuser\"@ip.address/or.computername\n\nType: ps -ax | grep AppleVNCServer\nYou want the line that reads something like\n/System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/AppleVNCServer.bundle/Contents/Support/LockScreen.app/Contents/MacOS/LockScreen -session 256 -msgHex \n\nJot down the PID that is to the left of this.\nthen enter:\nsudo kill -9 \"PID\" \n\nThis will force restart the lock screen and make it available again.\nI know this is like the post above just explained. It is also done on two 10.8.2 machines running ARD 3.6.1.\n\nA: In the Remote Desktop app, open the system list and highlight a remote machine that shows a status of \"Locked Screen.\" Pull down the Interact menu and choose \"Unlock Screen...\"\nYou'll immediately see the system's status change from \"Locked Screen\" to \"Available.\" You can then initiate a new curtain mode connection.\n\nA: What worked for me is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect via ssh user@host\n\n*Run sudo pkill loginwindow\n", "Q: How can I recover notes missing from the Notes app? I recently opened the Notes app and found that about a month's worth of notes are missing.

On this page Apple lists 3 different models of iPhone with different LTE support.  My question is, if I buy an iPhone in one area (e.g. Canada), and take it back to another area (e.g. the UK), what network compatibility can I expect on my device? (both LTE coverage as well as just working for voice and data at any speeds)\n\nA: The tech specs page lists the available network features per model in more detail.\n\nGSM model A1428: UMTS/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz); GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz); LTE (Bands 4 and 17)\nCDMA model A1429: CDMA EV-DO Rev. A and Rev. B (800, 1900, 2100 MHz); UMTS/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz); GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz); LTE (Bands 1, 3, 5, 13, 25)\nGSM model A1429: UMTS/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz); GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz); LTE (Bands 1, 3, 5)\n\nIn short, the two biggest differences are the CDMA vs. the GSM models. Depending on what you get, you won't even be able to do voice calls on the other type of network.\nAcross the two different models with GSM antennas, it appears that the same frequencies for everything but LTE are supported, so you are likely to get 3G and GPRS support across all GSM networks if the carrier supports it.\n\nA: It's pretty clear that the two GSM models will not work on any CDMA carrier whether or not you jailbreak it or get an authorized unlock.\nIt also is very clear that the CDMA model will work on pretty much any GSM carrier in the 3G/4G range of speeds (but not LTE). I have a Verizon CDMA A1429 model that works perfectly fine with my AT&T account (I've not cancelled that service yet and went in for a SIM card - took 10 minutes to switch from VZW to AT&T including the time the rep was in the back getting my SIM card.)\nSo - if you want the most flexibility, hands down the A1429 model is the most broadly compatible on the 3G as well as 4G band count. The only reason to get a different model would be price considerations (subsidy / contract termination fee / choice of provider) or you really wanted LTE in bands 4 or 17.\nApple's technical specifications page makes it very easy to tell which device to get from a cellular data and frequency standpoint since everything is spelled out.\n\nA: Ok, I’m gonna explain it very simple, non-technical terms.\nThis is what Apple lists on their tech specs page:\n\nGSM model A1428: UMTS/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz); GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz); LTE (Bands 4 and 17)\nCDMA model A1429: CDMA EV-DO Rev. A and Rev. B (800, 1900, 2100 MHz); UMTS/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz); GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz); LTE (Bands 1, 3, 5, 13, 25)\nGSM model A1429: UMTS/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz); GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz); LTE (Bands 1, 3, 5)\n\nThe A1429 wins hands down. It can work on most networks in the world, though you won’t get LTE speeds on all of them. The highest you can be assured of is 3G speeds. You can also make voice calls send texts on most, if not all, with the A1429.\n", "Q: How can I upload Photostream pictures to Flickr I want to (automatically if possible) upload the content of my Photostream to Flickr. How can I accomplish that?\n\nA: You can use a plugin to upload photos of your choosing to Flickr (albeit not automatically).\n\n\n*\n\n*FlickrExport\n\n*FFXporter\n", "Q: Retrieve image coordinates at mouse cursor in Preview.app I want to measure the precise pixel coordinates within an image where the mouse cursor sits.\nAre there stock OS X or third party tools that can easily do this?\n\nA: Not that I know of. The closest stock solution I personally use is to take activate the utility to take a screenshot of a screen portion (Command ⌘+Shift ⇧+4). The cursor will turn into a crosshair with the screen's horizontal and vertical pixel coordinates. You then have to apply some math to determine the distance between the end-points you want to measure. Not ideal, but better than nothing.\nYou can also try using xScope, a nice 3rd party utility which makes life a little bit easier with dedicated tools, but it is zoom agnostic, so make sure you measure at 100% zoom.\nPhotoshop is the only tool that effectively takes pixel distances regardless of the zoom level, but you have to open the image or at least a screenshot (if you take it from a website or PDF) in Photoshop.\n\nA: I needed something very similar (coordinates of bounding boxes around certain objects in image for computer vision research). I build a simple tool that runs in the browser: http://nicodjimenez.github.io/boxLabel/annotate.html\n\nA: While it may be a bit cumbersome, I use the Rectangular Selection Tool, then go to a corner of the image that suits your coordinate system (top-left in some cases, bottom-left in others) and stretch the rectangle to the desired position.\nThe size of the rectangle shown in the tooltip will be your position.\nZooming in helps to be more precise.\n\n\nA: You can do this simply by dragging from the desired pixel to the upper left corner of the screen. This will create a selection rectangle, and the size of that rectangle is shown in the screen. Since the rectangle can only stretch until it reaches the origin (the corner), its size will be the same as the pixel coordinates you're looking for.\n\nA: Via this answer to a related question:\n\nPreview (included in OSX): Select a Text Box then from Tools -> Show Inspector\n  pick  the 4th tab that has a little ruler icon. \n  This gives coordinates with an upper-left origin.\n\n\nA: I would suggest using GIMP for this. Firstly, import your image, right-click on it, and select Image -> Crop to Content:\n\nThis ensures that the canvas is the same size as your image so that if you hover at the top left of the image, the coordinate display at the bottom left shows 0, 0:\n\nI found this to be superior to the Cmd + Shift + 4 method in Preview.app because it shows a true image coordinate, whereas with Cmd + Shift + 4, I found that if I resized/panned around the image and hovered over the same point, it would show different coordinates.\n", "Q: How to fix songs still waiting in iTunes Match? I've recently refreshed my iTunes library and, as a result, decided to delete everything in iTunes Match and re-upload just to make sure it's all current and correct.  It's a large library (nearly reaching the 25,000 song limit), so the process understandably took a while and there were some duplicates to get rid of, etc.  The iTunes Match status icons helped a lot with that in terms of sorting and finding what needed to be addressed.\nAfter a few days, however, there are still a number of songs (27 to be exact) with no discernible pattern among them which perpetually have a status icon of \"Waiting\" for iTunes Match.\nI've tried selecting \"Update iTunes Match\" from the \"Store\" menu, closing and re-opening iTunes, even rebooting.  I can't seem to get iTunes Match to upload those 27 remaining songs.  Has anybody seen this before?  Are there other things I can try?\n\nA: I would export a copy of those songs to a folder in /Users/Shared and then turn off iTunes Match. Then:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a new user on your Mac\n\n*Log out of your existing user\n\n*Log into this brand-new user and fire up iTunes \n\n\nIt should have no music whatsoever and not be linked to your Apple ID. Now go ahead and sign into iTunes match and see what the cloud really thinks your music library looks like. Drag one and only one song from the users/shared folder into this library and leave iTunes running for a while to see what iTunes match makes of it. \nAt that point you have a very isolated and potentially reproducible issue that you could reach out to Apple support in case the problem is on the server side and nothing that you were doing. \n", "Q: How to get old Dock Exposé on Mountain Lion? Dock Exposé was a Snow Leopard feature which allowed users to click on an app on the Dock and, holding that click, windows of that app would be exposed. On Mountain Lion, Dock Exposé doesn't seem to be available anymore. Is there a way to get it back?\n\nA: Thankfully, this feature isn't completely gone. It has just, for some reason, been whisked away into the depths of less-than-obvious multi-touch gestures in OS X Lion and newer. You now have to double-tap an app icon on the Dock with two fingers to activate Dock Exposé.\nI'm not sure if this gesture ever existed on OS X Snow Leopard.\n\nA: You can also choose a key sequence for that using the Mission Control Preference Pane.

There are some preinstalled apps that came with my laptop that I know I wil never ever use. \nApps like \"Notes\", \"Stickies\", \"Game Center\", etc.. that were preinstalled in my Macbook Pro are apps that I don't plan on ever using and it's taking up too much space in my Application Folder.\nAre there any ways to remove them? Please note that I have already tried dragging it to the Trash bin, but it won't even go to the Trash bin. It' just stuck in my computer forever.\n\nA: The original question was posted before the days of System Integrity Protection (SIP), so this address SIP enabled versions of macOS thru the current macOS Mojave...\nNot that I recommend deleting pre-installed Apple applications; however, if that's what you're wanting to do, then make sure you have a current Time Machine backup. Then reboot1 your Mac to its Recovery HD and then in Terminal from macOS Recovery you can simply use the following example command:\n\n\n*\n\n*1 Turn on your Mac and immediately press and hold Command (⌘)-R See: About macOS Recovery\nrm -r /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/Applications/Chess.app\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Note: If Macintosh HD is not the name of your primary startup volume, then modify as appropriate.\n\n\nThere is no real need to disable SIP or reboot back to normal mode to make the changes, etc.\nThe following clipped screenshot of Terminal running from macOS Recovery shows though a series of commands the above command can work as is and the information presented is accurate.\nYou'll see that:\n\n\n*\n\n*SIP is enabled.\n\n*/Applications is not the appropriate target directory.\n\n*Changing directory to /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/Applications is not necessary but done here to facilitate the other commands used to show relevant information.\n\n*You can see the permissions and ACLs on e.g. Chess.app, yet it is sill deleted.\n\n\n\nNote that from macOS Recovery those permissions and ACLs are ignored and why a protected App can be directly deleted without disabling SIP and doing the reboot-dance as has been suggested in the past.\n\nA: Current versions of both suggested apps (AppCleaner, CleanMyMac X) no longer offer deletion of the apps preinstalled with MacOS (as tested on MacOS Catalina/10.15 in 2020). The answer below was originally written in 2012.\nAt one time or another I have deleted a whole bunch of the standard issue programs that I knew I wouldn't use.  I prefer not to have them wasting my space, however little it may be.  Also, I use a Mac Mini as a media centre, changing the standard hdd for an ssd, so space is at a premium.\nAppcleaner is one app that I have used for several years to tidy stuff up.  Never had a single issue with deleting Stickies, Notes, Bootcamp Assistant, Audio Midi Setup, RAID, Podcast, etc, etc.  Appcleaner preferences should be set up to delete \"protected\" apps and then will delete the app and all the other files (plists, etc.) that go with it.\nAnother app, CleanMyMac, does the same, but will also do a more general clearout of caches, etc.  Both recommended...\nGood luck!\n\nA: I strongly recommend against removing standard applications:\n\n\n*\n\n*Most of them need hardly any space at all (the three mentioned in the question need 14 MBytes together)\n\n*An upcoming OS X version may expect them to be there\n\n*There is no easy way to get them back once you removed them\n\n\nA: In general, you can remove applications simply by dragging them to the Trash (and emptying the Trash). In this case, you can't remove them because they are part of the core OS. Hence error message in Finder (Mountain Lion):\n\n\"Stickies\" can't be modified or deleted because it's required by Mac OS X.\n\nYou can almost certainly remove the core application from the command line, but I wouldn't recommend it:\nrm -rf /Applications/Stickies.app\n\n\nA: Right click on the application, then go to get info. There change the sharing & permissions to read & write for everyone. Then you can delete the application.\n\nA: Mac OS X includes various components that it expects to find as part of the operating system. Some of these live in /System or /Library, but some required parts of the operating system live in /Applications. While you might think it is harmless to delete, say, Chess.app, and there is a good likelihood that you can delete it without adverse side effects, a future update to the operating system or a third-party program might rely on its presence for functionality. Once deleted, re-intsalling applications that are OS components is rather challenging.\nYou express your concern for removing the programs as connected to the fact that they \"take up space\" in the /Applications folder. This could mean either they consume disk space, or they take up visual space when you list the directory.\nAs far as disk space is concerned, on most installations of Mac OS X, space in /Applications is the same as space in any other directory: space on the primary system drive. While these applications do indeed take up a non-zero amount of space, relative to the size of the operating system, the space saved by removing them is fairly trivial, while the risk of side effects is slightly less trivial\nIf visual space is the concern, however, you can make these programs disappear while leaving them in place in case the system needs them. At a terminal prompt, you will need to type\n  sudo chflags hidden /Applications/Stickies.app\n\n(for Stickies, for instance; substitute the name of any other program you wish to hide).\nThe sudo part of the command runs the command with administrative privileges (necessary to modify system files). chflags hidden tells the system to mark these files as \"hidden files\" that will still be present on disk, but not appear in Finder windows. Finally, /Applications/Sitckies.app is the path to the application you want to hide.\n", "Q: Can I have both iCloud-synced and local-only Safari bookmarks?

There is no way to select or de-select bookmarks or groups of bookmarks to be synced or ignored by iCloud.\n", "Q: How can we ensure that contact photos appear as either full-screen or as thumbnails on the iPhone? I've noticed that contact photos on the iPhone seem to appear in one of two modes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Thumbnail: A small square image shown next to the contact's name or number\n\n*Full-Screen: The image takes up the entire display, overlaid by the caller ID and Swipe-to-answer controls\n\n\nHow the phone determines which mode to use isn't terribly clear. This question, for example, dealing with contact syncing, seems to have people experiencing different results depending on whether they set the photo on the phone, synced from Gmail, synced from iCloud, etc.\nDoes anyone know the canonical rules for when a contact image appears in full-screen or as a thumbnail? Is it related to image size / shape, or only to the source of the image?\n\nA: In my testing1, pictures set on the iPhone itself consistently appear as full screen, and pictures set in Address Book on OS X and synced via iCloud appear as thumbnails. Any photos set elsewhere, but subsequently edited on the iPhone will also appear full screen.\nI haven't tested other syncing methods, but from what I've read elsewhere, including the question you linked, I think the syncing method doesn't matter — just whether the photo was set on the device, or on a Mac.\nIt's hard to say why exactly without any inside information, but I suspect it's one of two reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Different teams worked on the syncing and iOS Contacts app (or at least the user facing portions thereof). Some flag gets set somewhere in the data structure when you set a photo in the Contacts app that doesn't get set when a photo is synced over. Just something that got overlooked.\n\n*Intentionally left out. Since you don't get the opportunity to preview the cropping and alignment on the device screen when setting it, it was decided to make pictures assigned off-device just appear as thumbnails, to avoid any bad cropping or weird aspect ratios.\nIn any event, if you want consistency, you should set all your contact pictures on the same device — Mac if you want thumbnails, iPhone if you want full-size.\n\n1 I tested on iOS 6.0.1 on an iPhone 4S, and 10.7.5 on my Mac.\n\nA: While I agree that you are correct that adding photos on a Mac will result in none of your contact photos appearing on your iOS device/s (learned that the hard way), all my contact photos have been added/set up on the exact same iOS device but there is no telling if the photo will come up large or small!\nMy findings:\n\n*\n\n*If a photo comes up full-screen one time, it will always come up full-screen.\n\n\n*The original source of the photo (internal camera, emailed jpeg, etc.) Appears to be irrelevant in this issue.\nNote: all of my contact photos were accessed from my iOS camera roll using \"add photo\" (I did not copy and paste).\n\n\n*It does not matter whether you delete the original Photo from the camera roll or not after you have set the contact photo.\n", "Q: How can I create a custom alert sound in Mountain Lion? I want to use a personal sound file (currently an mp3) instead of the system alert sounds (sosumi, basso, etc.)\nI remember this being really easy on Macs a couple of decades ago, but can't figure out how to do so today.\n\nA: You need add the sound file to /System/Library/Sounds/, or ~/Library/Sounds. (If you don't know how to locate that easily, you can search for \"sosumi\", and follow the breadcrumbs at the bottom of the finder window.)\nThe sound file needs to be converted to AIFF or WAV format.

Mountain Lion will not keep the applications on the spaces of which I assigned them to.\nHas anyone else experienced these issues?

I can't seem to find any option to reset these settings (not even in the Advanced menu).\n\nA: You can't reset your settings to the defaults/empty, but you can remove specific apps from access to your location information, Twitter account, Facebook account, etc., as it sounds like you've already seen in the Security & Privacy pane of System Preferences.\nYou can uncheck individual apps with access to remove their access to your contacts, Twitter, or Facebook accounts; in the case of your Facebook and Twitter accounts, you can remove them from your computer altogether from the Mail, Contacts, and Calendars pane. This will essentially revert your settings to the way they were when you got Mountain Lion, since many of these features did not exist prior to OS X 10.8.\n", "Q: How do I download a single song via iTunes Match in iOS 6 When my iOS device doesn't have synced music but instead shows songs that are matched and available from iCloud, I've noticed there are only buttons to download groups of songs and not one song. \nWhat is the new way for downloading just one song from the cloud to the device?\n\nA: There is no direct way to just download one song onto an iDevice from iTunes Match right now. You can either\n\n\n*\n\n*request the whole album/playlist and cancel the unwanted tracks\n\n*create one-track playlists\n\n\nBoth options have their drawbacks of course (especially the second one).\n\nA: While you cannot download a single song in the background, the new procedure for downloading a single song is to tap on it.\nYes, this causes it to being playing as soon as enough data has been downloaded.

I have in my iTunes library some songs that, years ago, I ripped from CDs at bit rates of only 128kbps.  Storage is cheap now and I'd like to replace those songs with higher-quality versions (e.g. 320kbps for the MP3s.)\nI do intend to re-rip some of my source material (the music I listen to most often) at the higher bit rate.  I don't use iTunes itself for my ripping; I use another ripping tool.\nIs there a way in iTunes for me to replace the lower bit rate version of a track with the new higher bit rate version, without having to re-add the track to playlists already containing it?  Could I just slip in the new version of the MP3 (assuming same name) with a filesystem copy, or is that liable to cause problems in iTunes?  How can I avoid having to manually copy metadata or manage playlists affected?\np.s. I already know about iTunes Match.  Please assume (for the purpose of this question) that I'm not interested in the automatic upgrading it can provide. Looking for a solution that will work without Match, or when Match can't upgrade a track.  Thanks.\n\nA: You can just replace the file in the filesystem.\nUnfortunately, iTunes is too clever for it's own boots and registers for Finder events. So renaming a file in Finder will update it's location in iTunes if iTunes is open!\nSo here's one way I've tried that works.\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit iTunes (actually quit, not just close window);\n\n*Locate the file in Finder:\n\n*\n\n*This could be done in iTunes (before quitting) by right-clicking and choosing Show in Finder;\n\n\n*Replace the file in Finder with one with the exact same filename;\n\n*Open iTunes\n\n\niTunes will then use this file when you attempt to play it. Note: if any of the ID3 tags differ they will be updated in iTunes too (which is probably what you want). This means if you replace it with a file with the same file name but with less information in the metadata, you'll have less information in the iTunes browser.\n\nA: I wrote a python tool named replica that automates the task of replacing file while keeping id3 infos of the old file. pip install replica to install.\nMy use case is that I often download upgraded versions (bitratewise) of my favourites mp3 albums and am particularly interested to keep my ratings (that i duplicate in the grouping tag). \nUsage :\n\nIf you replicate full albums, please make sure that tracks filenames\n  are similarly ordered in both source and destination folders.:: \n$ replica -u Library/Sam_Cooke-Ain_t_that_good_news-128kbps-2003\nIncoming/sam_cook-good-news-320kbps   \nCloning id3 metadata... Done  \nRenaming files......... Done\n\nIn addition to id3 cloning, replica can handle files renaming too so\n  that upgrading mp3 files becomes a no-brainer.\n  Consider the\n  -u option to remove the source files and replace them by their\n  upgraded version. Preserving filepaths enables you to migrate id3\n  metatags to new files while keeping the information stored by your\n  music player (such as ratings or play counts) valid.\n\n\nA: The currently (March 2019) chosen answer is from 2012, and the other answers date back at least to 2014. This thread ranks high in Google search results for this problem, so I thought it would be worth pointing out that, in some circumstances, current versions of iTunes make this much simpler. If your new tracks have the same album, artist, song, and genre, when you import them into iTunes, then iTunes will recognize that they are duplicates, and ask if you want to replace the old versions with the new ones. Doing so keeps the current metadata, including play counts, playlist membership, etc.. Even the \"date added\" metadata is retained, keeping the original add date (\"date modified\" will be the current date).\nI just re-ripped tracks from a CD I ripped back in 2005. The 2005 rip was done using iTunes's MP3 encoder; the new ones were done with iTunes's AAC encoder. Even with the different format, iTunes recognized the tracks and offered to replace them. After the replacement, I verified things like add date, play count, and playlist membership for the files. It worked perfectly.\nI learned of this from the MacWorld hints forum: Replace Songs in iTunes with Higher Quality Versions Keeping Stats - Mac OS X Hints.\n\nA: Upgrading iTunes files to higher quality without losing metadata\nTurn off iTunes Match.\nRip higher quality version to iTunes.\nGo to higher quality file.

Local snapshots are hidden from view and you don't need to think about them. They will be deleted automatically when disk space drops below a certain percentage (20%, I believe).\nYou can enter Time Machine and remove the snapshots from there but you should not do this.

I am the owner and sole admin for this Facebook page. \nAny ideas? \n\nA: I would not use OS X Notifications, but would instead use Growl, and a management tool such as Babble, which supports both multiple Facebook accounts, and Growl notifications.\n\nA: I would recommend using Glow for FB ($0.99 in the Mac App Store). I find that its notifications are much more consistent and reliable as opposed to the built-in Facebook notifications. \n\nA: Only one Facebook account can be used at a time. There is just no way to add a second account. \nYou could try to forward the Page notifications to your account, if there is anything that allows you to do that.\n\nA: It's kind of a kludge, but you could enable email notifications for your page on Facebook, and enable Mail notification on OSX.\n", "Q: What determines whether podcasts are played individually or sequentially on an iPod? What determines whether podcasts are played individually or sequentially on an iPod?\nBasically, I have a lot of podcasts on my iPod.\nAt one point, it would play just one podcast, and then stop. There was a period of a few weeks where I didn't listen to podcasts, and now when I go to listen to a podcast, when I finish one, the iPod begins playing the next. \nThis is an issue for me because I generally listen to podcasts when going to sleep. As such, the iPod generally goes through maybe ~10 podcasts overnight, and I loose track of where I was.\n\nBasically, originally my iPod played podcasts one-by-one, I changed something, and now it does not. \nHowever, I've been through the menus on the iPod, and I cannot see anything that looks like it would be related to the podcast playback behaviour. Whatever was changed, It's not readily apparent the effects it has.\n\nA: I added one of the podcasts to a on-the-go playlist, and suddenly all the podcasts are playing individually, rather then sequentially.\nI have no idea why adding one podcast to the in-the-go playlist affected every podcast, or what would actually be required to return the behaviour to the way it used to be (sequential playing), but there you are.\n\nA: Yup, this is kind of frustrating.  I haven't had the time to figure out whether it is a technical or configuration issue, but my solution is to put all podcasts that I want to play sequentially in a playlist.\nSo without playlist, they play individually, but in a playlist they play sequentially very well.\n", "Q: iPad 2 downloaded iOS 6 trouble with downloading apps I have upgraded to iOS 6 now every time I try to download a new app it asks my password and then asks me to set up security questions when I finish and hit one it tells me it timed out.

Applies to the App Store too - it's all one. \n", "Q: What happens to the data for an app that gets removed during the update from iOS 5 to iOS 6? I have been using Mile Tracker app for logging business miles. Today when I updated my phone to iOS 6, that app disappeared.  It also no longer appears in the phone app store or in the iTunes 10.7 store app section. i assume there is no iOS 6 version.\nI have found instructions for reverting to iOS 5.\nI am wondering where to find my Mile Tracker data? \nIf an app gets removed during an iOS update because it is not compatible, does the data get deleted from the phone as well?  Is still on the phone? (In that case, how much other cruft is still taking up space). If it is still on the phone, will it get saved into a backup before I do the reset and restore to iOS5?\n\nA: The upgrade to iOS 6 doesn't remove apps, so this is more of a case where things don't go as planned so it's going to be very hard to discern why this happened in your case (and similarly for others with the same symptom but not necessarily the same cause).\nYou should not lose data from an app - iOS update or not and the procedure is the same as if you lost data on an app anytime. Restore the phone from your backup to get back the data.\nIn this case, you may (sadly) find that the backup has corrupted data (or data that is otherwise not usable), but in most cases, this cures the loss of data and will allow you to start moving forward on iOS 6.\n\nA: The app didn't get removed because it \"wasn't iOS 6 compatible.\" New iOS versions can run older software fine, extra effort is required only for using new features/APIs unless there is a new app store requirement.\nThe app most likely got deleted because it didn't exist on the app store as of the time of upgrade to iOS 6\n", "Q: Reinstalling Mac OS X on Macbook with swapped hard drive? I don't know much about Macs, so when my girlfriend asked me to repair her old Macbook, I tried to swap out the hard drive from my junker laptop. I got it all changed and now the boot manager shows a single partition for Windows. However, I am a little stuck on how I am to boot into Mac OS X to reinstall it?\nI was able to get a dump of the App Store version of Mac OS X Lion, and upon placing that on a USB drive with TransMac, it was recognized by the boot manager. But unfortunately, on choosing it, a large NO symbol was shown and the computer shut down.\n\nA: This question has been answered here. \nBasically do the following:\nTo start Recovery, hold down the Command + R keys while booting. The interface is pretty straightforward after that and you should be able to figure it out.\n\nA: I personally have an early 2008 MacBook which I have upgraded to Lion (the latest OS X without hacks for early MacBooks).  To do so on many of the older MacBooks, you need to first upgrade the RAM to at least 2 GB.  Mine had, as with many others, come factory installed with 1 GB which is most likely why you are seeing the no go sign.  I went up to 4 GB with mine with an SSD as well it does quite well for an older laptop.\n", "Q: Improve VLC quality on WMV, AVI etc?

I just upgraded to the iPhone 5 and plan on selling my old iPhone 4. However, I want to make sure I don't keep any personal information (photos, emails, contacts) on the device. Since both iPhones are synced with iCloud, I'm not sure that I am safe to just start deleting stuff without those same changes being synced to the new device. What is the appropriate way to clean up the old iPhone to be ready to sell?\n\nA: I didn't test it but I guess the easiest way would be to loose the connection to iCloud and then just reset it completely.\nBut I don't know if this is enough to clean it completely or if it would still be possible to regain the information through any kind of tools.\n\nA: Apple has documented the steps required in a support article.\nIf you have Find My Phone enabled, disable this otherwise the buyer will be contacting you to get your account to activate the phone. This can be achieved by switching the Find My iPhone option in Settings > iCloud.\nThen en Settings > General > Reset and choose Erase All Content and Settings.\nThis will wipe all personal data off the device (including all apps) and when it restarts it will be at the beginning of the wizard to set up a new device.\nThis will not effect any other devices linked to the same iCloud account, it purely clears the current device.\nThis process is necessary as Apple added an Activation Lock in iOS 7.

The same issue exists in safe boot.\nDoes mail have a way to easily reset preferences while retaining the accounts configured and rules.\n\nA: Go to ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Preferences and move the file com.apple.mail.plist to the Desktop and restart Mail.\nOther plist files exist in ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/ but I'd start with the above plist first. In this directory you could also manually remove the offending account (particularly if the mail is also stored online) and re-add it.\n\nA: We ended up deleting the accounts.plist file in ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData to solve the issue. This caused us to have to re-add all the mail accounts, but the rules, smart mailboxes, and mailboxes on the mac came back automatically.\nTo be safe, we backed up the ~/Library/Mail folder beforehand.\n\nA: Removing ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail.plist and ~/Library/Mail/* did not solve my problems.\nAfter replacing those files back, I finally removed ~/Library/Application Support/AddressBook and then I could access my mail again.\n\nA: Its very simple.

TLDR: When downgrading from iOS6 to 5.1.1, even with a standard .ipsw file and modified .hosts file (or TinyUmbrella), I get the error 3194 in iTunes. Help?\n\nI recently purchased a used iPhone 4S which is locked to Verizon. This is a problem, as I'm in Canada, and the international Verizon plans are expensive. I need to unlock.\nThe second problem is that the phone came with iOS6 installed on it. Although I was told that it was a beta, I was also told it was official (Grand Master build), and in any case, I managed to (somehow) wipe out and reinstall the official iOS 6 from iTunes.\nSince I don't have the original OS, I downloaded 5.1.1 4S from Redmond Pie. Unsure if this was the stock iOS, I downloaded it (again) from another source, and the two binaries are the same -- leading me to believe that this is an original iOS 5.1.1 image.\nSteps I took to install iOS 5.1.1:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close iTunes\n\n*Turn off the phone\n\n*Edit the .hosts file (to add the Cydia IP, or remove it, or launch TinyUmbrella)\n\n*Save changes (if applicable)\n\n*Open up iTunes\n\n*Boot my phone in recovery mode (shows a \"plug in to iTunes\" graphic)\n\n*Let iTunes figure out my phone is in recovery mode\n\n*Shift-Click \"recover\" and select the image\n\n*Watch until it reaches the step about verifying the ipsw file is from Apple\n\n*Observe an error 3194\nTo spell out my permutations explicitly, for step #4, I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adding the IP for Cydia\n\n*Commenting out the IP for Cydia\n\n*Removing the IP for Cydia\n\n*Running Umbrella 6.00.0000 and 6.00.0001\n\n\nI'm not sure what to do next to downgrade.\n\nA: Unfortunately, iOS 5.1.1 is no longer being signed by Apple.\nBasically, Apple provides a digital signature to iTunes when you try to restore a firmware.  If the signature isn't provided, you're unable to restore because Apple only signs the most current version of the firmware for the device you're using.\nThe Dev-Team Blog says this about downgrading an iPhone 4S to 5.x:\n\niPad3, i4S owners will always be able to RE-restore the current 5.x OS that's already on their device. So if you're at 5.1.1 when the window closes (and you've saved your blobs), you'll always be able to RE-restore to 5.1.1 again. This makes the 5.1.1 jailbreak a lot less fragile - you don't have to worry about messing up your install with funky extensions or getting into a boot loop, because you can always RE-restore from 5.1.1 to 5.1.1 again (or from 5.0.1 to 5.0.1 again, etc). But once you fall off the 5.x train by restoring to 6.x, you'll be stuck there until the next jailbreak.\n\nSo it looks like you're stuck on iOS 6 for now.\nRegarding unlocking, your best bet is to contact Verizon.  There may be a fee required before they'll unlock your phone, if they do.\n\nA: Clearly, there will be a technical solution to bypass the carrier locking, but things are loosening up on the carrier end in the USA with respect to unlocking and it might just be worth the effort to work on the social end of getting your device unlocked in the authorized manner.\nCurrently, both AT&T and Verizon will unlock customer's iPhone and AT&T will even for past customers. Verizon seems to be willing to unlock an US only phone after a month of two of paying the bill on time and AT&T is not as flexible. \nYou might contact Verizon and see what could be done to get that specific device unlocked legitimately - whether it's establishing service for two months or paying a bit or having the prior owner contact them for the unlock. Basically, you need to convince someone to enter that IMEI into the common database for unlocked devices and you'll not need to mess with jailbreaking to get an unlock.\n", "Q: My Macbook reached 100 degrees Celsius while compiling a software package, is this normal? I don't often hear my Macbook accelerate and start heating up, but today I was installing mariadb through Homebrew and it required compiling. I have a mid-2012 15\" Macbook pro with a high-resolution screen (the version released alongside with the Retina Macbooks)\nThe charger was connected but the light was green, so the battery was done charging already. When the compiling phase began, I heard my fan rocket to a very high speed. The charger was still connected (could that have had an impact the temperature?). \nWhen I installed smcfancontrol it registered temperatures of 100–105 °C (212-221 °F) and the fan was running at more than 6000 RPM.\nIs this normal? Reading around I read mentions of the maximum temperature before heat damage occurs being 95 °C, and my Mac went well over a hundred for a few minutes.\nEdit: When idle, the Macbook runs at 66 °C and 2000 RPM with the charger disconnected, and around the same temperature with it connected.\n\nA: Yes this is normal, Intel lists a \"Thermal Junction\" for the Intel® Core™ i7-3615QM Processor (6M Cache, up to 3.30 GHz) at 105 Degrees Celsius.  This CPU information is referenced from details in EveryMacs' Apple MacBook Pro \"Core i7\" 2.3 15\" Mid-2012 Specs. Modern CPUs pretty much detect when there is a temperature problem and will shutdown if it detects that its overheating.\nLarge Compiling tasks can take the CPU to its limits, which is causing your MacBook Pro to have to dissipate way more heat that it does normally, hence why its hot and blaring its fans to keep it from overheating. This happens pretty much across the board with most Apple laptops when you push the CPU's to 100% for an extended period of time.\nEar plugs, a laptop stand, headphones, or a Mac Pro desktop (with whisper quiet fans) may be good accessories if you plan on compiling a lot of software packages on a regular basis.\n", "Q: How can I diagnose an iPad that seems super slow to recharge? I've had my iPad 1 for almost a year now.  For the past few months it has been charging EXTREMELY slowly.  \nLast night I plugged it in with 54% remaining on the battery life.  This morning it is only at 81%.  It charged for 17 hours!  Is this normal?  The battery seems to last just about as long as it used to (once it's finally charged). \nI am using the standard wall charger.  I have also tried using my friend's charger and had the same result.  Any suggestions?\n\nA: Be sure you are using an iPad charger. If you are using a standard USB charger or an iPhone/iPod charger then it will take a very long time to charge. \n\nA: This is normal if the CPU and/or GPU in the iPad is stuck in a loop or legitimately in a loop. You can convince yourself of this by noting the power, plugging it in to a charge and then powering off the device. \nStart the iPad up after two or four hours has passed. The battery itself and the charging circuitry run without regards for the OS run state.\nOnce you've determined if this is the power source (USB with low power) or hardware issue you can get that repaired. If it's just a load issue (too much work to do - draining the charge current for just \"keeping the lights on\") then you can go down the path to isolate which apps or services are causing your large \"touch screen is idle, but the CPU is not\" power usage patterns.\n\nA: I would suggest you get the Amperes app from the app store. ($0.99). It determines your charging time. You can compare it to other benchmarks or try different cables or chargers and compare performance. My phone was charging very slowly. I used this app and determined it was my cable. I replaced the cable and the charging time got shorter.\n", "Q: How can I enable fingerprint authentication on a Mac? What compatible scanners are available? Do you know if there's a way to have fingerprint authentication on Mac? If so, is there any scanner compatible available?\n\nA: Yes - you will want to start with the Smart Card services source code or compiled installer that Apple publishes and then pick whatever device you like that integrates to this infrastructure.\nHere is Apple's starting point and a few more links that may help you in your search for a biometric authentication solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/PH10872\n\n*http://www.cac.mil/common-access-card/managing-your-cac/\n\n*https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/smartcard/owa/ShowPage?p=faqusers#fingerdeers\n\n*http://www.cacsecurity.com/biometrics.asp\n", "Q: Can a MacBook Pro reliably wake a Cinema Display when both are sleeping? I use a MacBook Pro with a Cinema Display and every time when I wake the MacBook Pro, the cinema display wakes first and the MacBook Pro display seems to stay in a sleep mode until I press the Detect Displays button in Displays Preferences. The most annoying part is that I need to rearrange all open apps' windows every time I wake my Mac. \nDoes anybody have any idea how to fix this problem?\n\nA: You ask for a fix where one of your screens does not wake up. I have a fix for a similar problem as my second screen on my MacMini (server 2011) does not wake up. It's not pritty but it is a fix.\nI noticed that the screen wakes up after you change the screens refresh rates, so I use cscreen to do this. After my computer wakes up I run the following script. There are multiple solutions to run scripts just after waking up your machine (like Scenario and Power Manager).\n#!/bin/bash\n# b.nelissen\n\n# cscreen: http://www.pyehouse.com/cscreen/\n\n# wake up screen when one of these two displays are found\nif [ \"$(cscreen -l | grep '2b1052d0\\|3c0c07c2')\" != \"\" ]; then\n    echo \"Display found\"\n    # Dell screen does not wake up, switch back and forth to wake her up\n    cscreen -i 2b1052d0 -d 32 -x 1280 -y 1024 -r 60 # small dell screen\n    cscreen -i 2b1052d0 -d 32 -x 1280 -y 1024 -r 75 # small dell screen\n    cscreen -i 3c0c07c2 -d 32 -x 1920 -y 1200 # big compaq screen\nfi\n\n# exit\n\nWhat it does in short\n\n\n*\n\n*Check if the screen is connected (I switch screens between home and work)\n\n*Refresh rate for displayID '2b1052d0' first to 60 than to 75 (to wake up the screen)\n\n*Set the second screen to her normal settings.\n\n\nA: Try unchecking the \"Automatic adjust brightness\" in the System Preferences Display control panel.\n\nA: Are you using a USB keyboard/mouse? MacBook Pros with ML have a feature that if you use external peripherals and wake your computer with them, it will act as a desktop computer without using the laptop display. If this is the case, try without the keyboard/mouse connected, or try waking with the built in keyboard/trackpad/power button.\n", "Q: Recover in-memory Pages data from failed hibernation wakeup My girlfriend's Macbook crashed while attempting to restore from a hibernated file. The progress bar stopped at ~10%, after which we restarted the computer for a normal startup.\nThis hibernated memory image had an unsaved document open in Pages, which we'd like to recover. There is a sleepimage in /private/var/vm, which I assume is the hibernate image which never got correctly restored. We backed up this thing to keep it alive.\nWe tried to strings sleepimage | grep known_substring but it returned nothing. grep -a known_substring sleepimage also did nothing, so I'm assuming that Pages didn't keep the text data in memory as plain text.\nEdit: After reading this answer on Binary grep I tried to perl -ln0777e 'print unpack(\"H*\",$1), \"\\n\", pos() while /(null_padded_substring)/g' sleepimage, again being fruitless. I padded it with nulls in order to attempt a match for UTF-8 text. Then I tried with .* globs between each character –- still no dice. \nSo Pages probably doesn't store text by any common encoding in memory. I would need to find a translation rule between ASCII string and Pages data representation -- I'm thinking maybe some kind of Objective C string buffer. To me it seems very weird to store character data as anything else than a sequence of characters, but this seems to be what Pages is doing.\nIf you have any idea on how to figure out the in-memory representation of text inside Pages, it might be very helpful in solving this problem. Maybe I can dump and read the process memory in some simple way?\nAnother possible solution is simpler -- I'm assuming it is somehow possible to reboot the computer from this sleepimage, but I can't find any documentation as to how you would proceed with that. Some other users (macrumors) seem to have encountered this, but for all the forum questions I've found, none of them have responses.\nThe OS X version is Snow Leopard, 10.6.8.\nComplex suggestions involving programming are welcome. I do C and Python.\nThank you.\n\nA: First try, IF known_string WAS stored in plain text (not the case)\nI guess you could try using\ngrep -Ubo --binary-files=text \"known_substring\" sleepimage \n\nFrom that, -U parameter specifies search on binary files, -b specifies that the offset in bytes to the matching part should be displayed and, lastly, -o specifies that only the matching part should be printed.\nIf that works, you would know the offset in bytes to get to that region, but I would not know exactly how to proceed there. Depending on the filetype, you could probably check for the filetype signature near that informed offset and try to isolate only the bytes that do make part of that file. For this, I guess you could either write a C program to do that, or maybe execute hexdump -s known_offset sleepimage and try getting only the bytes that relate to the file you need.\nFor instance, suppose I wanted to know something about Chrome:\n$ sudo grep -Ubo --binary-files=text -i \"chrome\" sleepimage\n3775011731:chrome\n\nSo I know I got an occurrence of chrome at the byte offset 3775011731. Hence I could:\n$ sudo hexdump -s 3775011731 sleepimage | head -n 3\ne1021b93 09 09 3c 73 74 72 69 6e 67 3e 2e 63 68 72 6f 6d\ne1021ba3 65 2e 67 6f 6f 67 6c 65 2e 63 6f 6d 3c 2f 73 74\ne1021bb3 72 69 6e 67 3e 0a 09 09 3c 6b 65 79 3e 45 78 70\n\nThe tricky part would be to get only the bytes you want. If the filetype has a known header you could maybe subtract the header size in bytes from the hexdump offset, so you get the file \"since the beginning\". If the filetype has a known \"EOF\" signature, you could try searching for it too and hence get only the bytes up to that point.\nWhat is your filetype? Do you think that some procedure like this could be used in your case? Note that I have never done this before, and I am basing myself on a lot of \"guesses\", but I suppose something like this has a little chance of working..\nSecond try, a slow method for parsing all bytes\nThe method before does not work because it also searches only for plain text, my bet.\nFor this second text I created a simple C program containing:\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main () {\n  printf(\"assim\");\n  return 0;\n}\n\nSo I could search for \"assim\", which would be your known_string, in that text. In order to know what bytes to search for I did:\n$ echo -n \"assim\" | hexdump\n0000000 61 73 73 69 6d                                 \n0000005\n\nHence, I must find \"61 73 73 69 6d\". After compiling that simple C source into the program \"tt\", I did the following:\nhexdump -v -e '/1 \"%02X\\n\"' tt | # format output for hexdump of file tt\n    pcregrep -M --color -A 3 -B 3 \"61\\n73\\n73\\n69\\n6D\" # get 3 bytes A-fter and 3 bytes B-fore the occurence\n\nWhich returned to me:\n\nIf you did something like that, I guess you could get your data.. It would be kind of slow to parse 2~8GBs of bytes though...\nNote that in this approach you must find the hexes in capital letter (write 6D instead of 6d on the last grep), not in under-case letters, and use \\n instead of white-spaces (so you can use -A and -B for the grep). You could use grep -i so it became case-insensitive, but it would be a little slower. Hence, just use capitals if this is used.\nOr, if you want a do-all automated \"script\":\nFILENAME=tt # file to parse looking for string\nBEFORE=3 # bytes before occurrence\nAFER=3 # bytes after occurrence\nKNOWNSTRING=\"assim\" # string to search for\n\nks_bytes=\"$(echo -n \"$KNOWNSTRING\" | hexdump | head -n1 | cut -d \" \" -f2- | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]' | sed -e 's/ *$//g' -e 's/ /\\\\n/g')\"\n\nhexdump -v -e '/1 \"%02X\\n\"' $FILENAME | pcregrep -M --color -A $AFER -B $BEFORE $ks_bytes\n\n\nA: Update with pictures:\n\n*\n\n*that loobsdpkdbik identifier mentioned first, isn't one - just happend to be before my text the fist time I tried it.\n\n\n*part of the text seems to get \"lost\" (i.e. not saved in one continuous memory stretch) and this may worsen with RAM usage\n\n\n*you may not be able to recover meaningful text from the sleepimage\nNow my original text (with typo in 1st paragraph, sry Mr. Matisse):\n\nHidden Gems: MoMa’s Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden, designed by Philip Johnson in 1953, is a spectacular urban oasis with its reflecting pools and beautiful landscaping.

I've got a major cluster-fart on one of my IMAP accounts that's being hammered by bounce messages as backscatter. Over the weekend my Mail on 10.7.4 crashed with a [Crashed Thread:  20  -[MailApp _doBackgroundFetch:]].\nReading up on Google for when Mail unexpectedly crashes 30 sec after loading that I should find the message that's causing it to crash and remove it. The trouble is finding it given I have several mailboxes. And I know where the ~/Library/Mail/ folder is. My problem, after having mail since pre-Jaguar days, my folder structure is like the below:\nBundles >\n\nMail >\n\n____Mail Lost+Found >\n\n____V2 >\n\n____ ____Several mail account folders >\n\nMail Lost+Found >\n\n____Several mail account folders >\n\nSpamSieve >\n\nV2 >\n\n____Several mail account folders >\n\nOf course, I'm using SpamSieve, but this crashes before and after its latest update. And the IMAP folders of each account is scattered as indicated. OK, which one? So I get Info on each of the folders listed above looking for a date within the last two days. Nope, the most recent is several months ago.\nI've read the V2 is Lion Mail, but as you see above I have more than one.\nMy question, is after all this time, which folder does what purpose and what files in them should I start yanking to pull the most recent messages out?\n\nA: If Mail stumbles across a specific messages when accessing the mail server via POP or IMAP it might help to remove the offending message directly on the server. The easiest approach in this case is to access the mailbox via webmail (at least if your provider offers this). Alternatively installing another mail client (e.g. Thunderbird) and using it to delete the offending mail might help as well. \n", "Q: mirror iPhone 5 display to TV without AirPlay Is there any way I can make anything that is currently shown on the screen of an iPhone 5 to be displayed on a regular TV or projector that has the usual HDMI, composite video, DVI, DSub inputs via a simple cable or adapter and without Airplay/Apple TV? \n\nA: At the moment, this is currently not possible as existing adapters are not compatible with the Lightning connector (even with current converters). See this link for more information.\nAt the Apple event on the 23rd October, two new adapters were announced VGA to Lightning and Lightning Digital AV (HDMI). If you read the details on the store page carefully, they both say they support mirroring (in the overview section).\n\nA: Apple is now showing Lighting to hdmi and vga and can be found on the link below.\nhttp://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/shop_iphone/iphone_accessories/cables_docks\n\nA: no this is not possible right now\n", "Q: Keyboard Layout in Windows 7 with VMware Fusion 5 I'm using my MacBook Pro for programming. I have a virtual Windows 7 machine running with VMware Fusion. When I switch from OS X to Windows 7, my keyboard layout changes. It's really annoying because I type lots of braces and parentheses.\nI have been searching for hours and didn't find a solution to make my Mac keyboard work the same way in Windows. I've tried installing Bootcamp driver, Windows Keyboard Layout Creator, etc.\nHow do I get these keyboard layouts to sync up?\n\nA: You don't give a lot of information about where you are based so I am making some references based on experience outside the US.\nWhen setting up a machine here in South Africa, the system (even preconfigured ones) come with an additional keyboard layout (in our case US-International). We use US keyboard layout here. That layout causes the ' to require a double tap on the keyboard before it processes it. If we remove it so that it only has one layout and restart the machine the behaves correctly.\nCheck that you have the correct keyboard installed in Windows as VMWare tends to make some assumptions during VM creation.\n", "Q: Mountain Lion boot time extremely slow! After I upgraded to Mountain Lion my MBP (late 2008) started to boot extremely slow. Last time it took 2 hours 46 minutes to boot, now it's already booting for 40 minutes.\nI've tried cmd+r (just after restart), which brings up recovery mode; I've tried to repair the drive (via Disc Utilities), but no errors were found; I've tried to fix permissions and etc. I even tried to reinstall (not clean one, just on top).\nAny of you know cause/solution to this? (Except clean reinstall, since I really don't want to do it now.)\nAlso, if I must clean reinstall, is it possible to do it via recovery mode? Or I must have bootable usb/cd etc?\n\nA: This problem may be the result of failing RAM or a failing disk drive or potentially some other hardware problem.\nIt should really not take more than 5 minutes to boot a mountain lion compatible Mac in the worst case.\n\n\n*\n\n*Check how much RAM OS X thinks is in the computer Apple Menu > About This Mac.

Unfortunately, I discovered that the iPhone stores new contacts information randomly. How can set my iPhone to - by default - store new contacts in Google Contacts?\n\nA: You need to change the default Contact account for each of your iDevices to point to a single service (i.e. Exchange, iCloud, etc). \nThe solution along with some screenshots. \n", "Q: Why does a Time Machine backup not complete when destination is a Shared Volume? I have six Macs in my house, all running the latest, greatest version of Snow Leopard. I also have an eMac (PPC) running Leopard 10.5.8. I use the eMac as a file and print server. The eMac has two external FireWire drives, 1 TB each. I partitioned each one so that there is a separate partition for each. I've shared each of the partitions.\nOn each of the six Snow Leopard Macs, I set up Time Machine to use the individual shared volume from the eMac. This seems to work fine, but when several clients try to back up at the same time I get the following error:\n\nThe backup was not performed because an error occurred while copying files to the backup disk. The problem may be temporary. Try again later to back up. If the problem persists, use Disk Utility to repair your backup disk.\n\nWhat can I do to troubleshoot this further and make the system more reliable?\n\nA: This question requires additional troubleshooting to pinpoint the problem. But there is probably a bottleneck somewhere. \nThere are a few things you don't tell us in your question. How are the different computers connected?\n\n\n*\n\n*WiFi or Ethernet?\n\n*What speed is the link to the eMac 11/54/100/360/1000 Mbps\n\n*what are the network devices used to interconnect the devices (hubs, switches, routers...)\n\n\nMake sure all devices have their own sparse bundles on the hard drives.\nYou should then try to test the different features used during the time-machine backups.\n\n\n*\n\n*Test the speed of your hard drives and then during backup monitor the disk usage\n\n*monitor the memory and processor usage on your eMac\n\n*monitor the connection usage (bandwidth)\n\n\nDuring the monitoring process try to add more and more macs until you get the errors.\nIf you see any of these components saturating during the backup you will pinpoint the bottleneck(s).\n", "Q: retry 'message send failure' with editing Here is the situation I get confronted with once in a while.

I go to 'Edit' message but the OS does not allow me to delete that phone number. Is there any other way to remove that number from the 'To' field so that I can resend the iMessage? I don't want to recompose the message (including cut, copy, pasting into a new iMessage) \nI am on iOS 6.\n\nA: The following is only a little less work than simply copying and pasting the original into a new message, but I believe it meets your requirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap Edit in the upper-right corner of the message list\n\n*Tap your message to mark it\n\n*Tap the Forward button at the bottom of the list\n\n\nThis will bring up a sheet that allows you to enter new recipients, with the previously-composed message already in place.\n", "Q: Sharing OS X iTunes Library with Bootcamp? I run Bootcamp on my Macbook and want to be able to run iTunes in both OS X and Windows 7 with the same library. I don't just mean having access to my mp3 files on both OSes, I mean things like ratings, play counts, playlists, etc. will be the same. Can I do this?\n\nA: This solution may very well not be to your taste, but the simplest thing I can think of that doesn't involve the phrases \"disk partitioning\" or \"file permissions\" would be to sign up for iTunes Match and match / upload your music collection, thereby making your music available to both your Windows and OS X partitions as though they were simply different devices (which, for all normal intents and purposes, they are).\nI recognize the downsides to this approach:\n\n\n*\n\n*The service isn't free (~$25-$30/year, depending on location), or even necessarily available in all countries\n\n*If you have a large library, you'll be using a lot of disk space to keep what are essentially duplicate files in each partition\n\n\nBut the result is a fairly painless and reliable solution, which does indeed keep your playlists, rating, and play counts in sync.\n\nA: Store the library files on an external drive.\nIn your iTunes preferences you can select the storage location. Set it to the location on the external drive both on Windows and OS X.\nPreferences and some other settings, as well as caches will not be accessible on both OSes, but that data that is important, like movies/music/apps/books etc. will be accessible. This way you won't have to download and store all of your purchases twice.\nAnother positive outcome to this is that you can always take the drive and connect it to another system and all of your purchases will become available there. Just don't forget to add the library in the preferences.\n", "Q: iPad wont charge in India I am not sure why my iPad will not charge in India which I got in US.

How do I test or find out the reason why the iPad wont charge?\nIt was charging well for a year and now it does not. \nI am using the charger for iPad and not the iPhone. Help me. Thanks.\n\nA: I have found the same problem. Despite using Apple charger and lead the iPad thinks it's a copy and delivers the prompt that my charger or lead is incompatible. I believe the problem is that the voltage in India can waiver because this only happens at peak power usage times. \n", "Q: Macbook Pro frequently experiences drops in WiFi connection with Linksys WAG120N I have a non-retina mid-2012 Macbook Pro running Snow Leopard and this issue has been plaguing me for a while.  \nDuring regular use of the laptop, while connected to my home WiFi network (to which no more than three other devices are usually connected), I keep experiencing sudden and complete drops in connectivity. It happens more than once every hour, usually while I'm browsing the Internet on Chrome and I'll see my loading tabs hang there with no response. The OS does not seem to notice this drop in connectivity, and keeps showing the WiFi icon as connected. To get the connection back I either have to wait till it returns (usually after a minute) or disconnect and reconnect the WiFi.  \nI think the issue is with the Macbook itself or between the Macbook and the router, because during these drops I won't even be able to connect to the router itself (by opening its web interface), and the Macbook seems to completely ignore the lack of connectivity.\nThe other laptop in the house (running Windows) does not experience these connectivity drops.  \nI have tried resetting the router, making the Macbook forget about it and then re-configuring the connection and changing WiFi modes but none of these things worked.\nHere are a few more details:\nRouter\nModel: Linksys WAG120N;\nFirmware version: V1.00.16 (most up to date);\nWiFi mode: Mixed (running in G-only or N-only mode still causes issues);  \nMacbook\n15\" Macbook Pro from mid-2012 (non-retina);\nProcessor: Intel Core i7 2.6GHz;\nSoftware: OS X 10.8.2;  \n\nA: *\n\n*Do you have DHCP enabled?

I found some of the pdf files has some page marks(or three holes I don't know the official name for the marks) as is shown:\n\nMost of the iPad pdf viewers can't recognize this to show the marks, only the good reader app can show only the area inside the marks. I wanted to stick to the good reader, but it sometimes doesn't show the pages properly, so I need to find a way. \nI was trying to use crop method : Crop multiple pages in a pdf file to cut out the marks in Mac, but Mac pdf viewers (Preview, Skim) are smart enough to show the region inside the marks. \nDo you know any way to resolve this issue? \n\n\n*\n\n*Do you know how to show the marks so that I can crop them?\n\n*Do you know any smart iPad pdf reader that shows the region inside the marks?\n\n\nA: I just could use Crop multiple pages in a pdf file method to remove the bleed marks.

As the title already summaries; without notice, the keyboard and trackpad seem to get unresponsive. The system is actually still running (seeing animations and other stuff still happening). The keyboard power button does actually work, pushing it will summon the screen to logout, restart or shutdown, but I can't actually hit any buttons (ofcourse). So I eventually hold down the power button to power down and then power up again, after this, the problem seems to be resolved.\nI don't know if this would be a hardware or a software issue. And I'm wondering if someone knows this problem? I've updated my Macbook recently to 10.8.2.\n\nA: I've got the exact same problem, I've contacted apple care and they are replacing with a new machine. they say it is a defective trackpad but it looks as though there are lots of people with the same problem.\n\nA: I don't think it's a trackpad issue. I have the same problem. It has to do with USB. The trackpad and keyboard are USB devices. I often see the problem plugging in certain USB devices. It's somewhat random, but you can sometimes find USB kernel errors in the logs. I have a USB serial adapter that can cause the problem if I pull the adapter while it's actively in use.\nBy the way, external keyboards and mice still work after this happens. Also, remote desktop works, too. You can use these to shutdown cleanly.\n", "Q: What do I need to provide a wired guest isolated access to my home network? I have an AirPort Extreme (APE) with the Wi-Fi setup for guest account and this works just fine.\nI was wondering if I could also provide a wired ethernet guest access without letting this user see my computers AND without me having access to his computer while plugged into this network as well.\nI do have a \"switch\".  Could I plug this into my broadband modem (first) then the APE? Would a switch give the isolation I need?\n\nA: No - you need a specific switch that would create a wired VLAN (virtual LAN) to segment the guest network from the rest of the house's network. VLAN are how the wireless system works as well but the software doesn't have a way to identify or switch one or more than one of the wired ethernet ports to anything but the main VLAN.\nIf you add a switch (or router) to handle the VLAN - it will need to either have physical ports to differ from the AirPort so you might be better just letting it run your entire network. Cisco makes many of these - mostly for the enterprise / medium business - but there are other options if you don't like the Cisco brand.\nHeading onto 2020 there are lots of options and for someone that likes Apple ecosystem and somewhat wants privacy controls, start with Plume and check out other packaged router / management / isolation tools. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.plume.com/\nIf you want to be a network engineer, The ubiquity line is amazing and their new DreamMachine is the gateway  drug of choice for prosumer networks. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.ui.com/\n\nA: I can't see any obvious way to do this using the parts you've listed. If you had a second AirPort, bridge mode could take that guest wireless network and share it over ethernet. There are also wireless bridge devices that can turn a wireless connection into ethernet, or several ethernet ports if combined with the switch.\nThere is one thing you could try. Connect the modem to the switch and the switch to the router. This usually doesn't work, but some internet connections allow you to connect more than one device (via a switch) to the modem. If you can connect another computer to that switch and have it get an IP address while the router still has access with its own IP, you may have a solution. The guest's PC will be outside the router and have just as much access as any other PC on the internet. This is a long shot, but it won't hurt anything to try.\n\nA: If the switch is capable of creating VPNs then the switch will do. You will have to configure a VPN in the switch and assign a network block, and assign it to either a port on the switch or if you know the guest user's NIC MAC address, that might be an option as well.\nEDIT:\nAfter reading your question again. What you describe will work, if you use a modem with a build-in router. You need DHCP, because your guest will need an IP assigned to their computer. The router will assign an IP to your guest and to the APE. The guest will be on the same IP block as your APE, but outside the APE IP block.\n", "Q: Simple scanning to PDF In OS X Mountain Lion, is there an easy and fast way to scan to PDF, with multiple pages per PDF?\nI know this can be achieved with Image Capture, but in my opinion that is just a terrible application. For my purpose (quickly scanning handouts), it is very slow and painful. (Overview scan, then select the part of the page I want, even though I always want the full page, restart it every time I want a new PDF, etc.) It seems to me that it was designed mostly for scanning things like photos, as it really does a terrible job for documents.\nI'm open to using a 3rd party app - for example, Linux has the remarkably good and simple Simple Scan app, which would be perfect for my purpose.\n\nA: I use Image Capture for exactly that purpose\n\n\n*\n\n*The overview scan can be avoided by setting Image Capture to always scan the full page (A4 or Letter) and to not do object detection\n\n*If you scan multiple documents they get written into distinct PDF files (which actually just get numbered)\n\n\nFor more specific needs there's also the option to create an Automator Workflow for Image Capture.\n\nA: PDFPen is a well-regarded app for doing various PDF related tasks on OS X, and it includes the ability to scan in documents directly. There's a free trial available, so try it out and see if it does what you need.\n\nA: http://www.pdfscannerapp.com might be useful, although it's a paid app, and I haven't used it for scanning so I can't comment on that.\n\nA: BcScan\nI was appalled at the lack of something like simple-scan for linux (no lengthy preview scan for each page, scan multiple pages into one document, scan directly to PDF, no frills, fast scanning), so I wrote one: BcScan.\nBcScan is free and distributed under the GPL licence as a bonus.\n\nA: Hamrick VueScan is affordable, at $40 for the basic version. You can download a free trial. It is very feature-rich and detailed, but it has a \"simple\" mode where most of the advanced options are hidden when you just want a quick scan.\n", "Q: Why is Time Machine using 180 GB of my 250 GB for backups? So this may be a misunderstanding as I am still getting to know my MacBook Pro, But can the majority of an internal drive be occupied by Time Machine backups?\nI was looking at the space taken up on my 250 GB drive, and noticed it was down to 43 GB free. I was perplexed to say the least. So after a bit of digging I went into About this Mac -> Storage, and discovered 180 GB taken up by backup. I was even more confused because I use time machine on an external drive. I am not certain of the logic, I have tried to solve this myself but I no idea as to how to remove this dumb backup on the mac's HD. Maybe I am the dumb one, anyways could someone please explain to me how to fix it.\n\nA: Since OS X 10.7 (Lion), Time Machine (if enabled) keeps local snapshots on portable Macs. This gives you Time Machine-like access to recent backups, in case you need to restore a deleted or modified file (however you still need a proper external backup to protect against disk failure). This is what the Backups item is measuring.\nThis feature isn't enabled by default on desktop Macs (are you sure you have a Mac Pro, and not a MacBook Pro? One is a laptop, the other is a desktop), but can be enabled by running sudo tmutil enablelocal in Terminal, and disabled by running sudo tmutil disablelocal (you will be prompted for your password in both cases).\nAs noted in Apple's KB article on the subject, once free space on your disk falls below 20%, it will start trimming older local snapshots, and it will speed up this process if it falls below 10%. So if you do nothing, you should see your drive space return to approximately 50 GB free. You can continue to store new things on your hard drive without fear of running low on space, as Time Machine will just slowly trim away snapshots as you add new data.\n", "Q: YouTube won't accept login/account I've upgraded my apple tv to ios 5.1 only to have it now reject my youtube login.  I've previously had this same Apple TV login just fine, but I accidentally hit log out.  It just gives me the \"This account can not be used with Apple TV\" error.

I plan to try another one, but dread hooking it up to iTunes.\n\n\nI'm on my last attempt and I feel it likely won't work.  Any ideas?  Anyone willing to logout and try to replicate ;) ?\n\nA: Turns out the entire youtube app wasn't able to connect at all. No Featured Videos or anything. Makes sense why it couldn't log in. I ended up trying multiple reboots and nothing working. A full restore fixed it though. Annoying.\n\nA: Someone else with a similar problem might appreciate this answer, even though you've found the reason for your own problem.\nIf you can connect to YouTube but can't log in using your own password and you have 2-step authentication enabled on your Google account, you have to go you Google Account Authorized Access settings, scroll to the bottom and generate an Application-specific password. This creates a unique password for use with that specific service and will only be shown once. \nHTH someone else :)\n", "Q: What are the differences between these two Apple TV models? I have some Visa points which I am considering spending on an Apple TV.\nAccording to my bank's website, Apple TV model they offer is MD199C/A. This seems to correspond to what Apple calls the Order Number (which is not the same as what Apple calls the Model Number).\nUsing Mactracker, I found that the latest 3rd Generation Apple TV's Order Number is MD199LL/A, which is a bit different from what the bank's website is saying, although quite similar.\nDoes anyone know if the Apple TV with the Order Number MD199C/A is the latest, 3rd generation model? What is the difference between MD199C/A and MD199LL/A, if any?\nMany thanks in advance.\n\nA: Are you in Canada by any chance? The MD199C/A code seems to be for the 3rd generation Apple TV in Canada, whereas the -LL/A code is the part number in the US. I'm not aware of any differences between the two (other than the limitations on Canadian iTunes, such as more limited iCloud TV/Movie accessibility).\nYou can verify these numbers by adding the Apple TV to your cart in the US or Canadian online Apple Stores.\n", "Q: Close tab without clicking on X? I'm using a 2012 Retina Mac Book Pro running OS X 10.7.5. I am a Windows power user and an OS X neophyte. \nMany of the keyboard and mouse shortcuts I know in Windows have functional equivalents in OS X. A feature that I find particularly useful in Windows is the ability to middle-click to close tabs (works across Firefox, Chrome, Visual Studio). This saves a user from having to click explicitly on a tab's \"X\" icon. \nIs there a magic trackpad click equivalent to middle-clicking a Windows mouse?\n\nA: The middle click to close tab functionality isn't really a common OS X UI pattern. The standard keyboard shortcut for closing a tab is command ⌘W (which will also close non-tabbed windows, or windows with only one open tab).\nIf you really want a Magic Trackpad gesture for closing tabs, you could use BetterTouchTool to map a gesture to ⌘W, but it would still be a bit limited, in that it would only close the currently active tab. I suppose you could use a combination of programs to make a macro that would perform a click to switch to the tab under your mouse, then close it, but it's still a bit hacky.\n", "Q: How to securely erase/format an iPhone for resale? I've read a couple guides that talk about restoring the iPhone to it's base operating system, then syncing three different full playlists of music in order to overwrite any previous personal data that might be on the phone and recoverable via basic forensic methods.\nI want to believe there is a better way, maybe a simple program that allows you to write zero byte files until the OS is full a couple times over.\nWhat is the best way to format/erase an iPhone for resale? \n\nA: The built in “Erase all Content and Settings” function (found in the Settings app, under General → Reset) should be sufficient in virtually all cases.\nThe 3GS and later iPhones, 3rd generation and later iPod Touches and all iPads use hardware encryption, where all data is stored encrypted in their flash memory. On these devices the wipe function simply deletes the encryption key, rendering the data not much more useful than random noise. On devices without hardware encryption, the wipe function overwrites the entire user partition with ones. This is more secure with flash memory than doing the same on a hard drive (where some residual magnetic field can be detected from the previous data, although the chances of that are likely very low) — it's theoretically possible someone could retrieve some data, but it would be prohibitively expensive and time consuming.\nUnless you're keeping extremely sensitive data on there (i.e. state secrets or evidence of a massive criminal conspiracy), I wouldn't worry about it once it's wiped.\nSource: Apple Article HT2110 — iOS: Understanding 'Erase All Content and Settings'\n", "Q: Why can I not access my own website - unknown host?

Or will it reformat the disk?\nGreetings and thanks for the help :D\n\nA: Time Machine requires an HFS+ partition on the drive, it can't use an NTFS formatted one, even with MacFUSE installed. The way to do this would be to shrink the NTFS partition, then make a new HFS+ formatted partition to use with Time Machine (you can do this with Disk Utility). Unfortunately OS X can't resize NTFS partitions, you'll need to use a Windows machine to do it, then use OS X to create a new HFS+ partition.\n\nA: You could in theory shrink the NTFS partition and open space for a HFS+ partition, but it is tedious and error prone, and I strongly recommend against it (especially since you have data you would like to keep on the disk already).\nBuy a new, separate disk for Time Machine alone.\n\nA: You could check out Paragon Software. They have a driver that allows you to do all read and write functions to a NTFS disk. I use it all the time and it seems to work perfectly.\nYou can read about it at the following link:\nhttp://www.paragon-software.com/home/ntfs-mac/features.html\n\nA: The best way to proceed, imho, would be to resize the NTFS partition and create a HFS+ one on the same disk, so you could keep your files in place while having a partition dedicated exclusively to Time Machine.\nHOWEVER, it seems that you actually can use a dedicated NTFS partition if you REALLY need to (In case you use a router that supports NAS and does not support the HFS+ file system nor the AFP protocol, for instance. Further, I say \"REALLY need\" because it is unsupported and someday this workaround may stop working with further releases of OS X, apart from not performing as good as a native solution [although it seems that it does not perform bad either]).\nI guess you could try following the steps found here: http://zerga.dyndns.org/wordpress/2011/10/13/howto-get-macosx-lion-time-machine-to-backup-on-a-samba-share/ using your NTFS partition instead of the Samba share mentioned. I Have still not tried this, but I heard of some people who managed to get this working somehow. I will personally give it a try later today. :-)\n\nA: Yes, you can put a Time Machine backup on an existing NTFS disk. You need a read/write NTFS driver (the 3 I know of are Tuxera, Paragon & OSXFuse+NTFS-3g), and you need to create a sparsebundle disk image with a specific .plist file inside. Then it works.\nOnce you have the NTFS driver, it will take you about 2 minutes.

I am moving to Europe (Norway) soon but I am considering to buy and Apple TV in Canada because it's cheaper.\nI'm not worried about power outlet compatibility since I can just use an adapter, but does anyone know if the Apple TV from Canada will be fully functional in Norway, or will certain services, Apple accounts, etc. be restricted? \nMany thanks in advance.\n\nA: The Apple TV functionality is almost entirely tied to your Apple ID. I believe the Apple ID \"nationality\" is tied to the billing address and/or credit card on file. If the address is Canadian, you'll have access to the Canadian iTunes and App stores, if it's Norwegian, you'll get the Norwegian stores. You can use iTunes gift cards purchased in a given country to buy content on that country's stores, but switching back and forth between two countries seems to be problematic (you may only get access to the content from one country at a time, and it requires two billing addresses, or two iTunes accounts).\nApple has a few useful articles you may want to look at, including the types of content available in each country, the availability of iTunes Match and iTunes in the Cloud (which allows you to re-download purchased content on a Mac or iOS device) and whether you can buy or rent Movies and TV Shows.\nFrom the looks of it, the content and options available in the Canadian store is superior to that of the Norwegian store (e.g. Norway doesn't have any TV shows), so if it's logistically feasible for you, it may be worthwhile to set up your iTunes account with a Canadian address and credit card (or just buy a lot of iTunes credit in Canada).\n", "Q: What happened to detect displays? I'm running Mountain Lion with a retina MacBook Pro with three external monitors attached.  Quite often, one or more of the monitors blacks out.  Normally, I would choose \"detect displays\" in the displays menu or system preference, but I just found that that button is no longer there.  Furthermore, the displays menu is gone as well!  I found it in /System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras, but when I double clicked it, it didn't open.\nSo I guess I really have two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is the displays menu dead?  Or did I break my computer somehow? I don't terribly miss it, other than the detect displays command (I never change the resolution from the default).\n\n*More importantly, how can I execute a \"detect displays\"?  A terminal command would be fine.  \n\nA: From Apple KB Article HT5369:\n\nIf the detect displays option is not available, hold down the ⌥ alt/option key while you are in the Display pane.\n\nIt should morph the \"Gather Windows\" button into the \"Detect Displays\" button.\nStupid change, isn't it?\n\nA: For a MacBook Pro with Retina Display, you may simply want to switch the Resolution option in the Displays panel of the System Preferences.  If you've currently selected \"Best for Retina Display\" then switching to \"Scaled\" and back may fix your problem.\n", "Q: MacPorts: Continue installing other updates after error Say I have the following outdated packages:\n\n\n*\n\n*foo\n\n*bar\n\n*baz\n\n\nI want to update as many as them as possible, so I try to run:\nsudo port -n -f upgrade outdated\n\nHowever this fails with:\nError: org.macports.build for port foo returned: command execution failed\nPlease see the log file for port foo for details: ...\n\nHow can I make macports try to upgrade bar and baz, if foo fails?\nI would like to generally make macports try to install/upgrade other ports if installing/upgrading some of them fails and just continue.\n\nFrom the man page: \n -f       force mode (ignore state file)\n\n \n -n       don't upgrade dependencies (affects upgrade and install)\n\n\nEdit: foo, bar & baz, are 3 total unrelated ports, that doesn't depend on each other in any way.\n\nEdit 2: Next time I run this the outdated ports might be a, b & c, instead of foo, bar & baz, so I can't hardcode the failing ones and I can't just do:\nsudo port update foo\nsudo port update bar\nsudo port update baz\n\n\nA: You can also specify \"outdated and not foo\" in the upgrade command, rather than just \"outdated\".\n\nA: MacPorts dev here; the correct answer to your question is: you don't.\nThere is a reason why MacPorts doesn't attempt to install a package when a dependency fails to build.\nThis exact question has been discussed on the macports-users mailing list not so long ago:\n\n\n*\n\n*“How to proceed past errors?”\nhttp://lists.macosforge.org/pipermail/macports-users/2012-July/029904.html\n\n*and its follow-up thread “-p considered problematic”\nhttp://lists.macosforge.org/pipermail/macports-users/2012-July/029984.html\n\nA: Considering an old closed ticket, a defect that was fixed: \n333 (dependancy failure are ignored and port continues to try and install) – MacPorts\nIf I understand correctly: to continue following a failure may, in some cases, be defective. \nIn other words: \n\n\n*\n\n*it's proper (least risky) to not continue. \n\n\n\nPostscript: I was too lazy to read the man page in its entirety (not found by the Help menu of Terminal, but that's no excuse).

It doesn't do anything. It doesn't open anything because the email was deleted.\nWhy is this happening? Is anyone else having the same problem?\n\nA: This is a bug that should be fixed, but possibly also a feature request.\nThe problem is simple. iOS won't remove notification from notification center when the app that post the notification launches. The developer has to tell the app to do it in order to clear all notification at app launch.\nWhile this behavior is expected by user, developer might want finer control over when to clear the notification.\nSo, Mail doesn't clear the notification, and posted notification cannot be removed by app. And that ultimately result in this weird notification that links to a deleted email.\nYou should file a bug at Apple Bug Reporter.\n\nA: You can set your iPhone to automatically check your email periodically, which will also update the mail client and notification center on which messages have been deleted.\nVisit Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > Fetch New Data > Fetch Every 15 Minutes for the most rapid possible updating.

Whenever my graphics adapter changes, whether intentionally or automatically, i notice the colors changing.They get definitely brighter, more blueish when on the high performance card. \nIs this normal?

The problem appears each time your MacBook Pro switches to a Discrete Graphics Card. \nThere are a couple of things you could try, as a temporarily fix:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn Off the Automatic Graphics Switching in System Preferences / Energy Saver, Reboot, and then turn it On again. This will make the Discrete Card to be initialized correctly. This fix will work, though, until your next reboot.\n\n*Use gfxCardStatus to force the use of the Integrated Card only.\n\n\nSome users got rid of it just by Rebooting, Repairing Permissions, Upgrading to the newest version or Reinstalling, though.\n", "Q: What purpose does this broken plastic clip serve in the MacBook Pro? Yesterday I opened my mid 2010 15\" i7 MBP (model 6,2) in order to replace its HDD. Everything went perfectly fine. Except that I noticed a broken little piece of plastic a little above the battery, which is fixed by two screws, which I have no idea on what purpose it had. \n\nIn the end, I just wanted to know what is that piece's purpose, if I should be worried that it is slightly broken, if I can replace it somehow.\n\nA: That clip holds the bottom piece snug in the middle. I would remove the broken plastic to avoid bending the metal tab that matches this on the bottom case. Also, you don't want it pushing on the connectors that are delicate and behind the metal cage above it. Lastly, if the piece breaks free it could wedge in the wrong spot (like a blower or worse) and cause more harm than it should.\nYou can see about a repair part from Apple by contacting AppleCare and this sort of thing is often sold used when a machine is liquid damaged or otherwise scrapped for parts. Many places sell used parts like ebay, amazon and ifixit.\n\nA: THIS PART IS IMPORTANT!!!\nImproper holding of bottom cover can change internal airflow completely (cold air will flow at the bottom not washing motherboard).\nEspecially in my MacBook Pro 17 2010... botom cover is significantly protuberant. So this clip/holder have good sense.\n", "Q: Is it a bad idea to purchase older Apple routers? I am thinking of purchasing an older Airport Extreme (A1143 model) as they are considerably cheaper than buying a new one.\n\n\n*\n\n*Are there any serious issues with an older model as far as performance is concerned?  I am not looking for anything cutting edge, mostly just internet browsing and video (netflix) streaming.  I notice that the A1142 model is \"Single 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz\" rather than the newer models which are \"Simultaneous 2.4 GHz and 5 GH\".... what sort of difference does this make.\n\n*Are there any features available in the newer model which are not available for older models?  I have an Apple TV, iPhone, iPad, 2 Macs, use AirPlay.  Will any of these have limited functionality on an older model?\n\n*Are the older models still supported as far as firmware updates go?  Do they continue to be supported by the latest versions of OSx?\n\nA: I bought a second hand Airport Extreme (A1354) about a year ago for less than 50% of the price of a new one so my suggestion would be to do some good shopping around as they come up from time to time.\nWhen I was looking for one, the minimum I was considering was the 3rd Generation (A1301) as it supported Dual Band. I would not personally buy anything older than this.\nThe model you are looking at supports Single 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz which means you can run either in 2.4 or 5 GHz mode, not both together. 2.4 GHz is the most commonly used wifi protocol (b/g/n) and means that the 13 channels available are very busy. 5 GHz (also n) is newer and less busy but not all devices support it. You don't mention which models of the iPhone, iPad, Macs etc you have but be aware that only the more recent devices support 5 GHz (iPhone 5 does). The newer devices support running both at once and communication is seamless between the devices.\nThe 4th generation (my model) also support the final version of N so I connect at up to 450 mbps which is great for transferring files. My Apple TV (3rd Gen) works great in a wireless configuration - mainly streaming data from my iMac (2011 - wireless) or Mac Pro (2008 - wired).\nApple has also spent a lot of time improving the antenna strength in the later models which really helps if you have a house with thick walls.\nYou can see a nice breakdown of what features are support by which model on Wikipedia. If you look further up the article there is a summary of what the improvements were in each model.\nI received an update for my model within the last month, not bad for a product first produced in 2009 (I can't comment on older models as I don't have any).\n\nA: Always go for the newest routers.\nOlder routers should also work fine but new ones provide much more functionality like dual bands at the same time or dual networks at the same time and etc.\n\nA: I just discovered today that the original, 802.11g AirPort Express (Model \"M9470LL/A\" isn't supported by versions of AirPort Utility after 6.0 and that the last few versions of OS X aren't compatible with the older AirPort Utility (though I found this helpful workaround).\nI don't know if any other Apple routers have these issues — I have some other old ones that are still in service, and I never had a problem until I found this one in a box — but it does illustrate an issue with Apple routers: because you have to configure them via AirPort Utility, rather than a browser-based interface, you're dependent on Apple to keep providing software for the platforms you want to use (or else keep around an ancient machine just to configure the settings on your router).\n\nA: The A1143 does have dual band 5Ghz & 2.4Ghz and can manage up to 60Mbps which should be more than most broadband connections.\nOne issue to consider with an older router is that the internal parts will be ageing and could fail.\n\nA: I have an AirPort Extreme and an Express from a few years ago, and I bought a new unit of each last December, planning to use them to extend my existing network. The old ones aren't recognized correctly, so I essentially need to replace them. So if you buy older hardware now, you may regret it later if you buy additional hardware to connect to them. This only seems to affect extending a network; other features work fine.\n", "Q: Always show hidden in Open/Save dialogs Is it possible to set by default to show hidden files and folders in Open and Save dialogs ?\nI know it is possible to trigger to show hidden for dialog lifetime by press Command ⌘+Shift ⇧+..\n\nA: I just asked this question again, since there were no real answers here, and according to this answer all you need to do is run\ndefaults write -g AppleShowAllFiles -bool true\n\nand restart whichever application(s) you're using, and you're all set.

I have a factory unlocked iPhone 4S that I bought in France. I am coming to visit in California. Will it work on the Verizon network?\n\nA: Probably not. Verizon (like Sprint) uses CDMA, not GSM. Your phone will probably work on AT&T, T-Mobile, or one of the smaller regional GSM carriers around here.

Initially, I am running OSX Mountain Lion on a mid 2010 6,2 MBP.\nI wanted to enhance my boot time a little, maybe by disabling some official apple kexts. Has anyone played with that, knowing which ones would be harmless to remove from startup? For instance, I was considering removing \"com.apple.kec.corecrypto\" because in my case it seems responsible for some many seconds of boot time. I do not have any encryption configured in the SO level, can anyone say if there will be any problem on \"removing\" that kext from boot?\nWell, furthermore, mostly out of curiosity, what does it mean to run the kernel space in FIPS mode? I know it has something to do with security/privacy and all of that, but what is it exactly? I thought that there may be another possibility of improvement (regarding only boot time, of course). I ask this because my console and startup on debug mode always have something saying \"Running kernel space in FIPS mode\". I stumbled on this kb which says something about the use of the FIPS Cryptographic module. If I have to install other stuff in order to administer it, why do I run the kernel in FIPS mode without doing anything much? Is this the default/only behavior? Please note that I have no knowledge about these topics, and hence I may be completely wrong on my train of thought, but those things got me curious.\nThanks for the attention.\n\nA: If your corporation needs to comply with certain security standards you may have to use a FIPS 140 validated cryptographic module. If that is the case your company is likely to have an officer set aside to help you with that. (This will depend on the country you're located in.)\nRemoving any Apple supplied .kext modules will at best cause nothing or broken functionality in applications or at worst render your system unbootable. You certainly will not gain any improved boot times from removing any kext since these are loaded from a cached file anyway.\nMore info on Validated FIPS 140-1 and FIPS 140-2 Cryptographic Modules.\nYou don't specify how long your system's startup time is, but from my personal experience my MacBook Pro (6,1) takes less than 20s after entering the FileVault password to decrypt my boot partition. (SSD) Also I only reboot when I installed an update forcing me to do so which rarely happens so I personally consider boot times an absolute non-issue.\nIf your boot times are really way off the charts you cause is much more likely a damaged filesystem or dying hard drive/SSD than a problem with your kext cache.\n\nA: I can tell you right now that disabling, (actually removing, now that I think about it), that kext will send you into a boot loop.\nTyping  sudo dmesg into a Terminal window followed by your admin password will show you what happens during the boot process.\nAlternatively, you can look at /private/var/log/system.log or use the Console application in Utilities for the same, to find more answers.\n", "Q: How to delete a podcast from new ios6 Podcast app? The new ios 6 has Podcasts broken out into their own application.\nI've got a bunch of old podcasts there for some reason. I can figure out how to delete all the episodes, but I can't figure out how to delete the podcast itself from the app. Is there any way to do this?\n\nA: From the Podcasts view (left tab), press the Edit button at the top left (you may need to scroll up to see it). Each podcast will have an (x) button in its top left corner. Hit that button (it's small and can be tricky, but it works) to remove the podcast.

Now when I look at the iCloud backup settings for the iPhone 5, it says \"Backup options will be available when your iPhone is restored from this backup.\" It seems to think it is still restoring, but I believe it finished yesterday. I can click \"Stop Restoring iPhone\", but I'm afraid I will lose some data; is there any way to check what's going on?\n\n\n\nA: Check to make sure it is not downloading any apps still (check all folders and pages to see if any apps are still greyed out to show not yet downloaded) and not downloading any songs either (check under downloading in iTunes). If it isn't, try turning off your phone, then turn it back on. If that doesn't work, hold the power and home button until you see the Apple logo to do a restart.\n\nA: Yes - the best thing is to force a boot with no network connection.\n\n\n*\n\n*enable AirPlane mode\n\n*power off normally, by holding sleep/wake and sliding the red control\n\n*power up - it will still be in AirPlane mode\n\n*inspect the last of the screens - and in the folders on the last page to make sure no icons are still \"downloading\"\n\n*connect to iTunes and see if it's still downloading\n\n*disable AirPlane mode and let it sit for 60 seconds to resume downloading anything (hopefully you are in a fast Wi-Fi for this - especially if some apps are larger than the normal size for a data connection download)\n\n\nIf after all this is done, you may be forced to stop restoring and potentially lose data that has changed since then and now, but it clearly is programmed to stop the restore and leave you with what you have.\n\nA: Make sure that you have the latest iOS version installed before you start the restore. In my case the replacement unit I got had iOS 7.0.3 installed and the restore would get stuck at some point. I was able to install the 7.0.4 update while the restore was stuck using my Mac and iTunes. After updating the system, the iPhone restartet and continued with the restore. I hope it will complete the process eventually. It is still running at the moment...\nSee \"iCloud: Restore your iOS device from iCloud\":\n\nYou must update your device to the latest version of iOS to make sure\n  you can restore from a recent backup of another device, such as a lost\n  or broken device.\n\nGood luck to you!\nNext time I will make sure to have a manual backup of my device on my Mac before a planned replacement.

However when I went to iTunes on my phone, some songs had not downloaded.  When I tapped them, it started the download and as soon as that was done, the message went away and my phone is now able to be backed up to the iCloud once more.\n\nA: I had a similar problem. My iPhone 5s seemed unable to complete a backup to iCloud after/during an initial restore. The iCloud Backup button was grayed out and unresponsive to touch gestures in the \"BACKUP\" section under Settings > iCloud > Storage & Backup.\nI solved it by downloading the iOS 7.0.2 update. After installing the update and a restart of the phone, the Backup button showed on and active. Backup to iCloud started and appears to be going fine. Currently shows 4 minutes remaining (thought I'd go ahead and post this rather than wait until backup is complete).\n\nA: I had this same problem.\nI realized that my iPhone 5 would not complete restoring because I had several songs on my phone that I had downloaded from someone else's computer. My phone asked me to put in the password for their Itunes email (I was confused why) and I hit cancel.\nSo... I went to iTunes and deleted the songs that were gray, I reset the phone (hold the home and lock buttons), and it worked!\n\nA: Check to see if your old phone is backing up to the cloud.

Since updating to 10.7.5 both Spotlight and Time Machine are very slow.\n\n\n*\n\n*To index a normal system drive Spotlight calculates to need several days.\n\n*As a result Time Machine takes up to an hour or more for an incremental backup of ~100 Mib.\n\n\nWhat solution is there for these slow Time Machine backups and Spotlight indexing?\n\nA: Check your console log file and look for lines like this (the real log lines will have process IDs and dates):\nsandboxd: mdworker deny mach-lookup com.apple.ls.boxd\nmdworker: Unable to talk to lsboxd\n\nIf you're seeing that, it is probably the source of the problem. Something Appple did with this latest release (also affects Mountain Lion 10.8.2).  \nI don't know what's really going on other than to say that mdworker (which scans and indexes files for Spotlight) calls LSCopyLibraryItemURLs() which eventually sends a message to lsboxd.  The Sandbox policy doesn't allow that, so the worker is killed. \nSo maybe the policy file is wrong, or maybe mdworker shouldn't be making that call.  I don't know.  However, fixing the policy file is relatively easy.  POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS, but easy.  \nEdit these files as root:\n/usr/share/sandbox/mdworker.sb\n/usr/share/sandbox/mdworker-bundle.sb\n\nInside the files you'll find the line:\n(allow mach-lookup (global-name \"com.apple.ocspd\"))\n\nRight below it, add the line:\n(allow mach-lookup (global-name \"com.apple.ls.boxd\"))\n\nThat's it!  \nIf you want extra comfort, maybe reboot.  Maybe erase your spotlight index and start over:\nsudo mdutil -E /\n\nIn fact, I still see mdworker: Unable to talk to lsboxd in my log files but at least now the indexing will finish and Time Machine moves quickly again.\n\nA: You can completely fix all the mdworker related sandbox errors in Console (including the cannot talk to lsboxd) by editing the system.sb profile rather than the mdworker ones. The system.sb file is used by all Apple system processes that run under the sandbox, including mdworker. If you modify this file (which is located in /System/Library/Sandbox/Profiles) to include:\n(allow mach-lookup (global-name \"com.apple.ls.boxd\"))\n\n(allow mach-lookup (local-name \"com.apple.ls.boxd\"))\n\nThis will stop all the lsbox related mdworker issues.\n\nA: If Spotlight never finishes building the index, it can be because the indexing always stops on certain files. I made a clean installation a few years ago because of that issue, but it returned after I restored my old files. I ended up narrowing down the files that caused it by just adding folders to the privacy tab in System Preferences.\nSomeone at Super User ran opensnoop to find what files mdworker stopped on: \nsudo opensnoop -n mdworker\n\nFrom a suggested edit by user37651:\n\nI ran the opensnoop command above and it showed a problem with files in ~/Library/Developer that were put there from a previous Time Machine restore. (I currently don't have XCode installed.) I deleted the folder, and Spotlight indexing finished in only 30 minutes. My Time Machine backup now seems to be working.\n\n\nA: The OS X Lion 10.7.5 Supplemental Update released October 04, 2012 includes:\n\nResolves an issue that may cause Time Machine backups to take a very long time to complete\n\nand, after testing, this seems to have completely resolved the issue.\nNote that for me, the first backup after installing this update still took unexpectedly long, and included many com.apple.backupd[423]: Waiting for index to be ready (100) messages, so maybe Spotlight hadn't yet properly re-indexed the drive.  Now, a couple hours later, small backups complete at their usual brisk pace and all is well.\n\nA: I posted this workaround in that topic. Here it is (it is not a solution, only a temporary workaround to let my backup and Spotlight work until a fix is released).\nUsing Terminal:\n\n\n*\n\n*I disabled Spotlight indexing:\nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist\n\n\n*I deleted Spotlight index in all my drives (including the backup drives):\nsudo rm -rf /.Spotlight-V100/Store-V1 /.Spotlight-V100/Store-V2  /.Spotlight-V100/VolumeConfiguration.plist\n\nsudo rm -rf /TimeMachineDrive/.Spotlight-V100/Store-V1 /TimeMachineDrive/.Spotlight-V100/Store-V2  /TimeMachineDrive/.Spotlight-V100/VolumeConfiguration.plist \n\n(rm -rf /.Spotlight-V100/* did not work for me.) (This can also be done by excluding the whole drive using privacy setting of Spotlight and then reincluding it.)\n\n\n*\n\n*I deleted /var/folders content (see this topic to know why):\nsudo rm -rf /var/folders/*\n\n\n*I deleted the .inProgress files from my Backups.backupdb subfolders (put to trash then empty the trash is the only way to do this).\nIt may be necessary to reformat your backup drive instead of only deleting .inProgress files.\n\n\n*\n\n*I rebooted and then I restarted Spotlight:\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist\n\nsudo mdutil -i on -E /\n\n\n*I waited until Spotlight finished indexing process\n\n*I launched a new backup using TimeMachine\n\n*I opened a bugreport to Apple with the title: \"TimeMachine hangs when Spotlight is in use under Mac OS X 10.7\" praying that many other people will do the same to make this bug a priority.\nSome steps may be useless, but I took all what I learn by reading different topic about slow TM and Spotlight.\n\nA: It is possible to delete the Spotlight index and then force Mac OS X to create a fresh Index from scratch. This is usually worth trying in a situation like yours.\nI'm afraid I don't know the Terminal commands for doing this. When I need to do it, I use the commercial program MacPilot, from Koingo Software, which costs US $20. They have a fully-functional trial version that you can use for 15 days. If you find it useful, you can decide to pay for it.\nI suppose there are other utilities for doing this also.\nOf course, once you delete the existing Spotlight index, you need to wait for Spotlight to create a new index. You should let your Mac run uninterrupted for as long as it takes to generate a new one completely.\n\n\nA: Damn! Got faster boot times too\nI am writing a different answer just to summarize the specific steps I took (I must keep clear that they are part of what is ALREADY written here, not my contribution), because after I took those steps, not only Time Machine is working faster, but my boot time decreased from 1min10secs to 40secs! My boot time always intrigued me as I constantly saw people reporting much lower boot time for the same specs and, somehow, those steps cut 30 seconds off my boot time (Yeah, I tested more than once and, yeah, caches were ok and I took many steps before taking those ones here, including repairing permissions, repairing disk, even defragging with iDefrag2, all to no results). Until now :P\n1\nsudo mkdir ~/trash_backup\nsudo mv /var/folders ~/trash_backup/ # backup just in case\n\n2\nAfter that, editing\n/usr/share/sandbox/mdworker.sb and /usr/share/sandbox/mdworker-bundle.sb, adding\n(allow mach-lookup (global-name \"com.apple.ls.boxd\")) below the line (allow mach-lookup (global-name \"com.apple.ocspd\")) on both files.\n3\nFinally,\nsudo mdutil -i on -E /; sudo reboot\n\nThanks lauhub and Old Pro. Can anyone explain the decrease on boot time and what the mach-lookup on boxd thing does and possible security issues? Thanks all :)\n\nA: So I've suffered the same as everyone else but unfortunately didn't read all the multitude of threads in the correct order so basically lost my original TM backup, then my Spotlight db in a failed effort to fix it.\nA thread somewhere which I can't find again (I think it was more about slow Spotlight index) had a post from a guy who simply reinstalled 10.7.5 and everything was back to normal. So I did that, and it worked.\nAfter completion of the reinstall I left TM off and allowed Spotlight to index. I went out for a ride and when I came back it was done - 149GB in something less than 90 min. And it works, I've searched for stuff on my HD.\nI then turned TM on and it took 2hrs 9min to complete.\nSo if you are considering spending the time and bandwidth downgrading to 10.7.4 you may wish to consider a reinstall of 10.7.5.\n\nA: All, I had the same issue, TM anticipated to take days for a brand new backup on a new disk, and indeed it took hours for some 200MB to be completed. \nI disabled spotlight with the command indicated above, and - behold - 40GB loaded within 10min and the TM updated is running as smoothly as one would expect. \nThis is quite an important bug and its disappointing that Apple sends out an \"update\" that causes problems like this. \n\nA: According to https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4324046?start=60&tstart=0 disabling Spotlight with $ sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist improves the Time Machine backup speed.\n\nA: A simple rebooting into SAFEMODE and then rebooting back to NORMAL MODE appears to have cleared this use up for me.  Went from 3 weeks to 1 hour for back up.\n", "Q: Issues getting application approved We build and sell a SaaS application, our clients have asked us to produce apps which allow this application to be accessed from their phones.\nWe have developed and submitted to Apple a version for the iPhone and this has been rejected as it should be distributed as a custom B2B application via the \"Volume Purchase Program\".  Having reviewed the \"Volume Purchase Program\" this is far from ideal due to a wide range of reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clients want the iPhone version of the app for personal phones, business phones are largely Blackberrys.\n\n*As our clients don't already have an account it will be necessary for them to register if their meet the requirements of the program or are able to due to internal policies.\n\n*It will then be necessary for the organisation to purchase (a free app) and manage the distribution of the app internally via a spreadsheet.\n\n*We will also have the overhead of granting additional clients access to the app.\n\n\nHas anyone got any suggestion to over come these issues?\n\nA: I'd suggest that you go down the 3rd party App Store route.  We use Nukona (part of Symantec) here at work.\nWith one account you can manage all your clients, have multiple apps and limit apps to groups (clients), and if you expand your development past iOS, then it also supports BB and Android.\n", "Q: How to fix lsregister failing associations after reboot? I'm running 10.7.5 and I have noticed a problem with associations between files and applications. The main symptom is that Finder shows more than one copy of the same application to open a file.\nAt first everything worked, but now the com.apple.LaunchServices.plist file is not updated anymore. In particular, if I launch through terminal lsregister -dump the association appears, but if I open the plist file the association is not present. If I reboot, instead of updating the plist file, the system eliminates the association from the database (the option -dump doesn't show it anymore). I tried to launch lsregister -kill -seed several times, but the situation doesn't change.\nHow can I permanently fix the associations between files and applications?\n\nA: The LaunchServices database is built with data from as many as four domains. (See 'lsregister --help' for more info on these domains.) You might not be rebuilding the LaunchServices database correctly.  This is the command I use to rebuild the database on my Mac:\nsudo /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user\n\nIf you really want to get into the nitty gritty of file associations (plus a whole lot more) and want a nice GUI to boot try installing RCDefaultApp.\nhttp://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/14618/rcdefaultapp\n", "Q: How to stream Spotify from iPad to receiver? I would like to get some answers on how I can stream music from Spotify on my iPad to my home-cinema receiver.\nExactly what hardware do I need to invest in?\n\nA: You can use an Airport Express router or an Apple TV:\n\nPlay iTunes music on your speakers. Wirelessly.\n  AirPlay takes the music from the iTunes library on your computer, iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch and sends it wirelessly to any stereo or speakers in your home. Simply connect your speakers to AirPort Express using an audio cable (sold separately). Then, using iTunes on your computer or the Music app on your iOS device, choose which speakers you want your music to play on. If you have more than one AirPort Express connected to speakers, you can play the same music from iTunes on your Mac or PC on all your speakers at the same time. Already have a Wi-Fi network in place? Use AirPort Express to add music streaming to its capabilities and create a whole-house musical experience.\n\n\nBasically, play your track on Spotify, go full screen which reveals the sharing options, and from there you can pick your Airport Express which should be cabled to whatever AUX-in inputs your amp/receiver has.\nThe following pic' shows me doing something similar to an AppleTV (I don't own an airport express but the process is is essentially the same thing).  \n\nIn fact for audio there isn't much difference between the an Apple TV and an Airport Express, and the choice of Apple TV or Airport Express is whether you want TV functions or Network functions as extra functionality over and above the audio.  The only difference for audio is that the Apple TV has an optical out port (& HDMI), and the Airport Express has a 3.5mm Analogue/Optical output,\n\n\nThe iPhone version of Spotify doesn't have a full screen mode, but hit the i for info screen and it's next to the volume slider in the bottom right - easy to miss.\n", "Q: Open Notes.app notes in an external editor I'd like to be able to search for words within the notes that I write in Notes.app. Since the search bar only narrows the list of notes, and doesn't actually highlight the word, I'd like to be able to open the notes in an external editor to perform searches.\nAre the notes in for Notes.app located on the filesystem somewhere such that I can open them in an external editor?\n\nA: If you search for some local notes with Spotlight or Alfred, the results will contain files like ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/CoreData/ExternalRecords/*/IMAPNote/_records/0/p8.notesexternalrecord. Opening them opens the notes in Notes.app, but they're just empty property lists.\nThe contents of local notes are stored in a binary format in ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes/NotesV1.storedata.\nI don't know if there are any other applications that can edit or import the notes, but there's no rtfd files for them or anything.\n", "Q: Icons and other graphics have strange colored strips after waking Macbook I am running OS X Lion on a late 2008 model Macbook (not pro). From time to time, usually when left on and unattended, the battery gets low and it goes into sleep mode. I kick myself for letting it happen again, plug it in, and power back on. My session is restored as expected, but with some additional interesting graphic effects:\n\nAll of the application icons when Mission Control is activated have the same green and pink striped pattern background you can see just below the menu bar, and all over the UI of Activity Monitor. This never happens after a normal sleep/wake cycle- only after the battery dies.\nI haven't been able to find anybody else experiencing this, let alone somebody who has come up with a solution other than just rebooting.\nI have done a few hardware upgrades to this machine- I replaced the original memory with 8GB, and I installed a 128GB OCZ SSD a few months ago. My best guess so far is that maybe it's some sort of disk cache problem, but to be honest I have no idea. So here I am.\nWhat causes this, and how can I fix it?\n\nA: I have the exact same Problem! I have a MBP 2011 model with OSX 10.75.\nI have also done a few hardware upgrades to this machine: I replaced the original memory with 8GB, and I installed a second 128GB OCZ SSD disc a few months ago. The SSD is the OS disc and the original disc is now my second disk.\nI have the exact problem after the deep sleep, when the machine runs out of power.\nFrom Mark’s tip, I replaced the new 8 GB RAM back to the original 4 GB RAM, but the problem remains! I assume it is a problem of the OCZ disc. I tried to update the used firmware but I failed as I need a Windows OS to do so.\nSo I made a workaround: I entered in the Terminal:\n$ sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0\n\nThis means that the laptop will never enter DeepSleep (or hibernation, that is the RAM is always powered and in the event of a power loss the state is lost), and in this case the sleepimage /var/vm/sleepimage can also be removed.\nOrginial Article: http://linuxtoosx.blogspot.com/2011/10/optimizing-mac-os-x-for-ssd-drives.html\nIt is no solution for the problem but a workaround to avoid the deep sleep. But this means that your work will not be recovered after shutdown from low battery.\n\nA: I have seen this a couple of times. It is memory corruption and it usually means that the graphics card is bad. Since the Graphics card and the rest of the computer are on the same board the whole motherboard needs to be replaced. Take it to the Genius Bar to get it officially diagnosed.\nApple has made this repair on two of my machines.\nSince it only happens after a dead battery, it could be bad RAM chips. The Genius Bar will know for sure.\n\nA: If you really want to fix it, try reinstalling OS X.\nIt worked for me but the problems return as soon as you run out of battery. \nYou can try the hibernation workaround to avoid this.\n", "Q: Differentiate two instances of the same application in the dock I usually have to launch different instances of the same application (in my case of Eclipse).\nI launch them from the terminal as follows\nnohup /Applications/eclipse/eclipse -data ${workspace} 2>&1 > /dev/null &\n\nwhere ${workspace} is different for each invocation.\nEverything works well but for the fact that I cannot distinguish among instances in the Dock or while switching applications with command+tab.\n\nIs there a way to differentiate them either by changing the application name under the icon or by dynamically changing the icon?\n\nA: This is a solution for your particular issue, and not OSX apps in general on which I believe do not have this issue. \nWorkspace identifiers for Eclipse on OSX \n\nA: It's not a great solution, but if you don't mind taking up a bit extra space, you could:\n\n\n*\n\n*find some other icon, and copy it to the clipboard\n\n*make a copy of the Eclipse .app\n\n*in the Finder, \"Get Info\"\n\n*click the Eclipse icon, and paste your icon there\n\n*from the Terminal, launch these two .apps, rather than the same app twice\n\n", "Q: AirPlay mirroring on iPod touch 4G I've just bought Reflection app for Apple TVize Mac.

Are there any further steps to do on the iPod to stream the screen?\n\n\nA: You have an airplay icon, not an airplay mirroring icon on a 4th generation iPod. You need a 5th generation to get mirroring. On the iPad, there is an option for turning mirroring on and off. So on my iPod 4 I get sound but no video on my TV when using Netflix, for instance.

Is it possible to force Dropbox on iPad to sync all files?\n(That is, to make it working it the same way as it does on a laptop/computer.)\nAs far as I see, it saves only files marked as \"Favorite\". Adding everything manually does not seem convenient... \n\nA: Not really. It isn't designed to store everything, but does try to cache files you have downloaded and save them as long as the iOS device doesn't run low on space and tell apps to throw away files that can be re-downloaded. \nKeeping more than a Gigabyte of free space on the filesystem will keep iOS from purging the files dropbox has downloaded.\n\nA: That's not possible with the Dropbox app on iOS. A good alternative would be GoodReader which allows to sync Dropbox folders.\n\nA: I stumbled upon this thread while looking for a real sync with DropBox.\nCurrently there's a free Documents app to do this:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/documents-5-fast-pdf-reader/id364901807?mt=8\n", "Q: How do I stop MacAppStore from showing updates for deleted apps? I've deleted apps that were purchased through the Mac AppStore. I used \"CleanApp\" to delete the parts left in app support folders.\nBut I still see notifications of updates in the AppStore app.\nI know I can hide the app name in the Purchases tab, but is there any way to remove these notifications permanently?\nIt is not just a cosmetic thing. If I have multiple updates and I select \"Update All Apps\",  the deleted apps will be reinstalled.\nPlease note I am asking about the Mac App Store, not the iOS Store.\n\nA: Usually this is a problem with spotlight.\nThe simplest step is to shut down the mac, disconnect all external drives, and start up to make sure no extra volumes are mounted. The next step would be to rebuild the spotlight index.\nLastly, search in other user accounts to be sure another user didn't somehow install or copy that App into their home folder.\n\nA: I had the same problem and suggest you try a more relaxed solution.\nInstead of spending considerable time on rebooting and rebuilding indexes, use spotlight to search for the application. Select \"Show all in finder\", throw all instances in the garbage can and empty it.\n\nA: On MacOS 10.13 in 2018, I had to use a combination of techniques:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit the App Store, then search for the offending app on all volumes (including network and removable volumes you don't always have connected, but use frequently enough that they might be Spotlight indexed), and remove all copies of the offending app.  App Store is likely to want to upgrade them if Spotlight has informed it that they exist.\n\n*\n\n*If you use any \"plain files\" backup solutions, like a disk-mirroring app, you'll need to use this approach to find the extra copy/copies. This might require manually mounting a volume that's normally unmounted except during backup operations.  Consider excluding this volume from Spotlight indexing in the future.\n\n*If you need to keep an old copy of the app for some reason (e.g., for use on other machines with older OSes not compatible with the current app version), then archive it with ZIP, 7Zip, or whatever.  If you're mounting any of those machines' hard drives across the network, you'll also need to exclude them (or at least their Applications folders) from your local Spotlight indexing.\n\n*See also this related question for some find or locate techniques for looking for orphaned .pkg and .plist junk relating to the app.  This part is more likely to be needed the longer you've been upgrading on top of the same installation (e.g. my MacOS 10.13 began its life as MacOS 10.7, years ago, and consequently has way more cruft than an all-new 10.13 disk would).\n\n\n*Restart App Store and see if that resolved it. (It may still say the update is available until you do this and go into the Updates tab).If not, any of the following should work, and can be done in sequence until victory is yours (quit the App Store before each attempt):\n\n*\n\n*Use the mdutil and launchctl commands provided in Dipak G.'s answer, then restart App Store.\n\n*Restart your Mac, then check App Store again.\n\n*Rebuild the Spotlight index the canonical way, and check App Store again, after another reboot if necessary.\n\n\n\nIn my personal case, I had to do all of this, sequentially, except the last two bullets. I did not get around to the Dren/Jawa technique of looking for _MASReceipt stuff inside the app, since my goal was to nuke the app entirely.  That idea might be good for severing the connection between the app and the App Store, e.g. if you have replaced the App Store version with one direct from the developer.\n\nA: Thanks for your tips\nAn eventual solution: I searched for other instances of some apps, found a copy on another disk, but since I didn't want to totally delete it, I instead zipped it and then deleted the app. Quite obvious, maybe, but... The annoying update alerts are gone.\n\nA: Loading the metadata plist works when Mac App Store shows updates for uninstalled apps:\nTurn off spotlight:\nsudo mdutil -a -i off\n\nUnload it:\nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist\n\nLoad It:\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist\n\nTurn on spotlight again:\nsudo mdutil -a -i on\n\nNow everything is reindexed and there shouldn't be any updates for uninstalled apps.\n\nA: All you have to do to solve it is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right-klick on Your App and click Show Package Contents\n\n*Navigate to Contents/_MASReceipt/\n\n*Open the file receipt in text edit\n\n*Search (Cmd+F) for \"angry\"\n\n*Delete the whole paragraph, containing com.NAMEofYOURproblemAPP\n\n*Save. Since you don´t have permission to edit system files, you will have to save the new receipt file somewhere else, then replace the old one with the edited after entering your password.\n\n*Done\n", "Q: Is it better for iOS to sync Gmail contacts using Exchange ActiveSync or the CardDAV protocol? To date I've been using Google Sync as an Exchange account to synchronize contacts between Gmail and my iPhone.  However, Google very recently announced support for syncing Gmail contacts using CardDAV, and that now seems to be the suggested method according to Google's help page.\nBoth seem to work.  Are there any discernible reasons to prefer one over the other?  What are the known advantages or disadvantages of using Exchange versus CardDAV for this purpose?  Going beyond the basics, do they vary in their ability to promptly push updates from other devices, resolve conflicts, handle unusual fields, preserve battery life, etc.?\n(There have been a few earlier questions about iOS/Gmail contact synchronization.  However, these all predate Gmail's CardDAV support, and therefore do not address the question I'm posing here.)\n\nA: I did a test in Google Contacts: I edited one contact and I added a lot of numbers, emails, websites, addresses, and dates. Then I triggered a sync on my iPhone and iPad.\nThe results:\n              | Exchange | CardDAV\nphone numbers | max 6    | no limit? (I entered 12)\nemail         | max 3    | no limit? (I entered 8)\nwebsites      | max 1    | no limit? (I entered 4)\naddresses     | max 3    | no limit? (I entered 6)\ndates         | max 2    | no limit? (I entered 6)\n\n\nA: Exchange is a far inferior way to sync contacts. Carddav is a open standard that is much more flexible then its microsoft counter parts. First, it allows more then three fields for emails and other arbitrary limits. Second, carddav makes many more categorizations of fields like, phone numbers more then the usual home, work, other. Lastly, customized entries let users put in twitter handles and more. Other standards like Caldav and IMAP can work in sync and offer more robust syncing mechanisms with less known issues. This feature is long overdue.\n\nA: I used Active Sync since I got my very first iPhone, and switched to CardDAV the day Google announced support for it. I can say without a doubt CardDAV is the way to go\nWith CardDAV, you will get you much more accurate synchronization than with Active Sync. First, as has been mentioned, you can synchronize more than 3 e-mail addresses. In fact, I have 31 e-mail addresses myself, and they finally all sync up with my iPhone. Even more importantly, two-way sync works now. If you make an edit on your iPhone, it won't clobber the field in your Google Contacts. For instance, editing e-mail addresses on your iOS device won't change their labels in Google Contacts to Other instead of Home, Work, and whatever custom fields you might have had.\nIn particular, custom fields are preserved in both directions. This is especially important if you want to use Siri to \"Send an e-mail to my brother\". The Brother field in Google Contacts was not correctly imported into iOS through Active Sync, and if you allowed Siri to save who your brother was in your contacts, the import back into Google Contacts mangled everything up, including all other fields that you did not edit.\nFinally, phone numbers also all sync in both directions without trouble using CardDAV.\nTo me, two-way editing (or the lack thereof) was the biggest problem with Active Sync. I never, ever edited any contacts on my iPhone using Active Sync because I didn't want to have to fix all the fields on a desktop later on. Now I can do it freely and haven't noticed any data corruption.\nThe main gripe people have concerning CardDAV is the lack of push. However, for me Active Sync push was so slow anyway that the slight delay of Fetch barely makes a difference. Plus, my experience with the reliability of Push has been less than stellar (connections that die and are never re-established, primarily). I've found the polling model to be far more robust.\nWhat you may want to avoid while using CardDAV is updating a contact in Gmail or on your iPhone, then immediately updating the same contact in the other. This will likely cause one of your modifications to get overwritten by the modification made in the other direction.\nUpdate 1: The one oddity I've found in two-way syncing relates to the Google Voice phone number type. For some reason it doesn't sync correctly in either direction (it becomes \"Phone\" on your iOS device when entered in Google Contacts, and Other in Google Contacts when entered from an iOS device). My only guess can be that the field has a special meaning to Google.\nUpdate 2: There is another strangeness with the iPhone phone number type. It will make it to your iOS devices correctly if entered as such from Google Contacts. However, if you specify iPhone as a phone number type from an iOS device, Google Contacts will change that to Mobile. The iOS device that originally specified iPhone will retain it as its phone number type until that contact is updated again from either Google Contacts (without first changing the phone number type to iPhone) or from another iOS device. I recommend only entering iPhone as a phone number type from Google Contacts. Contacts with that phone number type should also only be edited from Google Contacts if you care about listing iPhone as their mobile phone number.\n\nA: I was wondering the same thing, then today I noticed a problem with my Exchange-synced Google contacts on my iPhone 5 running iOS 6.\nI wanted to call a pizza place. I had a contacts entry in Google with the phone number. I had entered the name of the place (\"Marlene's Pizza\") in the last name field in Google, so that the whole name showed up in boldface in iOS, and was alphabetized under \"M\".\nThe phone number wasn't there on the iPhone. It was a blank contact, with nothing but the name. I checked one or two more businesses that I had entered the same way (with the business name in the last name field in Gmail) and they were also missing the phone number on the iPhone.\nI switched my contacts syncing to the new CardDAV method, and these contacts synced correctly.\n\nA: CardDAV is really the way to go. Unfortunately Googles counterpart for calendar syncing (CalDAV) is so badly implemented, that I looked for alternatives at the CalConnect website (http://caldav.calconnect.org/implementations/providers.html) and ultimately ended up with fruux. Their implementation is top notch - even supports all the sharing features, great support, device tracking with custom passwords and a nice design.

I am primarily concerned if this will drain my battery if I leave personal hotspot on. Is it worth the mental time to turn off the hotspot in order to conserve battery?\nI run iOS 6 on an iPhone 4s.\n\nA: It does drain your battery; whether it's worth it for you to turn it off is up to you and how long your battery last. \nAlso something worth noting is that by leaving it on and walking around other people can see your hotspot and might try to connect. Even if they're unsuccessful it will drain your battery even faster.

They have done so with there new iPhone 5's but it is still asking for my Apple ID. What can I do to fix this?\n\nA: When I changed my ID on my iphone, I didn't see an \"edit\" option either.  So maybe my experience will help you, I hope.  After going to Settings/iCloud, I was told to scroll down to the bottom of the page where it says DELETE ACCOUNT.  After deleting my son's account from my phone, I was able to enter my own ID.  It took a few tries and some time while it tried to validate the new ID and then it told me to go to my email on my computer to respond for verification.  Good Luck!\n\nA: That happened to me when my wife got her iPhone.\nAny apps that you downloaded with your Apple ID will require that ID and password when they are updated.  \nThe only (legitimate) way around this is to have them delete all of the apps that you downloaded with your Apple ID and re-buy or re-download them with theirs.\n", "Q: Is there a dashboard widget for displaying (and monitoring or reloading) plain text files?

Is there a widget for this? \nAlso, I can't seem to figure out how to search for widgets in http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/?r=dbw without looking through all the categories. Bug? \n\nA: There's a trick you can use to do this without using any other sort of dashboard widget:\nThis MacTipper article from 2008 shows how if you open a text file in Safari, you can then send that file to be opened in Dashboard.\n\n... anything you can open in Safari, you can have on the dashboard. This includes text (TXT) files. If you combine this with other fun things you can do with text files, such as your basic todo list, you can put some pretty good information on the dashboard. As with images, you just need to open the text file in Safari and add it to the Dashboard.\n\nApple have removed that ability in later version of Safari, however using a simple HTML file allows you to bypass that restriction as in the example below:\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>TODO List</title>\n</head>\n<body> \n  <iframe src=\"todo.txt\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\">    \n</body>\n</html>\n\nFor other people who come to this thread looking to get TODO lists in the Dashboard, then iSlayer's Organized is a Dashboard widget that provides TODO functionality in the Dashboard.\n\nTo do’s are synced with OS X’s built-in database, so Organized will\n  always reflect what’s shown in Mail and other apps.\n\n", "Q: I cannot connect to iTunes and the App Store from my iPad in iOS6 I just updated to iOS6 yesterday.

According to this appleinsider.com article, Apple has introduced new privacy functionality that can limit ad tracking in iOS 6:\n\nApple was not happy to see third party developers and ad networks\n  using iOS users' UUID (universally unique device identifiers) to\n  perform sophisticated tracking of individual devices (web cookies,\n  unlike UUIDs, can't track a specific computer, and can be deleted by\n  the user), particularly when they tracked UUIDs down inside Apple's\n  headquarters to spy out new models.\n\n\nApple has not publicized this feature much and has set the default state to OFF, and has placed the setting at .\nIf turned on, how does this feature improve user privacy? Does this setting really prevent advertisers from tracking individual phones/computers? Details have been limited, so I'd appreciate any information that can shed some light about the expected functionality of this privacy feature.\n\nA: I understand it to be limiting the type of information apps are allowed to track about you. Specifically, they shouldn't store your UUID.\nFor example, apps could associate your UUID with behaviors you demonstrate in the app and so provide targetted marketing. The idea of behavioral tracking and targeting are discussed on this World Privacy Forum page.\nThe upshot is that if you enable privacy, apps shouldn't provide tailored (targetted) adverts to you based on what you do in their apps. I'm not sure how it'll be enforced though; perhaps, it prevents access to your UUID, but I'm not sure if that'll be for iAd apps only.\nThe \"Learn More\" link at the bottom of your screen gives some explanation in Apple's own words. The non-personal reference I think is about anonymising your UUID (so it can't be traced back to you personally) but in essence its still a UUID.\n\nI'm sorry I don't have more specific information about the implementation but hopefully this sets the scene somewhat.\n", "Q: MacBookPro stopped booting what should I try?

I wanted an easy way to put the computer to sleep and either not been asked for a password when it wakes (if I close the lid) or been asked for a password (when I explicitly put the computer to sleep).\n@George Oross: Thanks for your response. I tried to find in the apple developers website some info on how to detect those signals, but made no advance.\nI think that the best way to do that is to enable the \"lock screen\" menu item (via Keychain Access). If I want a \"secure sleep\" I first lock the screen through the menu and then close the lid to put it to sleep. If I want a \"non-secure sleep\" I simply close the lid.\n\nA: No. What you want is not possible.\nWhen the screen is closed the behavior is the same to the user as if it went into sleep from another reason such as pressing the power button. There isn't any way to have closing screen sleep (called clamshell sleep) set to have a different effect than any other kind of sleep through user-accessible preferences. If you have your mac set to require a password after waking in the security preferences then the mac will ask in both cases upon waking.\nHowever, the mac internally codes the reasons for sleep differently. So the computer can tell clamshell from idle sleep, and also can tell if the mac went to sleep for another reason such as power button press, low power or high temperature. Therefore it is possible that a third party hack can use these codes to enable different behavior. I could not find one, though.\nWhen the mac wakes up there are similar codes generated by the OS so that it knows if the computer was woken by opening the clamshell, wiggling the mouse, pressing the power button, waking for network access and so on. This seems to create another opening for a third party solution.\n\nA: If you don't want to keep the Keychain menu extra in the menu bar, you could also assign a shortcut to a shell command like this:\n/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend && osascript -e 'tell app \"System Events\" to sleep'\n", "Q: What is PPPMonitord.app?

My MacBook Pro screen constantly dims and brightens.  The automatic box is unchecked.  The brightness adjustment button is constantly moving back and forth.\n\nA: Might be an issue with the power supply when “Slightly dim the display when on battery power” is checked in Energy Saver prefs. This would dim the display when the power adapter is lost and become brighter again when not running on battery anymore.\n\nA: The \"Auto-adjust Brightness\" didn't fix it for me, but disabling the option right under it, \"True Tone\", did.\n\nA: This could be a keyboard issue. If other things are going wrong with keys, such as the backspace or caps lock, the keyboard (top case) needs replacing.\nYou can get a temporary fix by using a keyboard remapper program and change the keys for brightness and turn off the usual F1 and F2 ones.\n\nA: Go your System Preferences, select \"Displays\", and uncheck Auto-adjust Brightness.  \n\nA: I'd try to reset the System Management Controller (SMC).\nApple's documentation on the SMC states that this may resolve issues related to the power management.

I have an iPhone 4S with Verizon, and I wanted to know if it would be possible for me to buy an iPhone 5 for the off-contract price and then ship it to my brother in Austria and let him use it there on the GSM network.\nThe reason I think this might be possible is because the GSM part of the Verizon iPhone 5 comes unlocked.\nOne obstacle that might stand in the way is if I have to activate the iPhone 5 with Verizon before I send it to him.\n\nA: Yes, for Verizon phones in the US, neither the month-to-month contract (unsubsidized) phones (when they become available) nor the subsidized phones are in any way carrier-locked.\nI tested this by establishing AT&T service on my subsidized iPhone 5 before I did anything with the Verizon side of things and it has worked with both data and cellular provisioning on the nano-SIM from AT&T.\nThe Apple LTE page will guide you to know which frequencies are available for which model of iPhone 5. The model of each phone is conveniently printed on the back plate of each device.\nThe carrier you intend to get service from is in the best position to guide you in picking a US model to import, but Apple's documentation show no difference in the GSM 3G capabilities of any of the three phones available at launch, namely the A1428 (GSM), A1429 (CDMA or GSM).\n", "Q: How to reset iMac to factory defaults?

I want to pre-install the fresh OS X and let the new user finish the set up as he would after buying a new iMac (enter/create his own Apple id, time zone, etc.).  \nAny ideas how I can do this?\n\nA: Based on this answer and personal experience with a Yosemite iMac I recommend\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold ⌘+R during boot to boot to recovery console.\n\n*Use Disk tool to erase main partition.\n\n*Exit disk tool, launch system reinstallation instead.\n\n\nI was very surprised that skipping step 2 I ended up with a fresh install which nevertheless contained the account I had on the machine before. Not factory default.\nThe disk erase step allows choosing the tradeoff between speed and security. So if you have personal data on the machine, better do a slow but thorough erase there.\n\nA: Try this SE question and answer:\nActually, you should be able to do it by removing a hidden system file which tells OS X that setup has run.\nIt's a hidden file, so you will have to remove it using Terminal, or show hidden files in Finder. You can remove the file like so:\nrm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone\n...then restart your computer immediately.\n\nA: The only way reinstall MacOS X avoiding the new user to be asked for your Apple ID are next:\n\n\n*\n\n*Erase and install from Internet Recovery CMD + ALT + R (if your mac is at least mid 2011 and later). \n\n*If your mac is early 2011, it was probably build in with 10.6 snow leopard, so you will need the original installation DVD. \n\n*A third option, it is advance but would solve your problem, it is to create a bootable disk and give it to the new owner so He can install directly from the bootable disk without Apple ID. You can find the steps in the official Apple article https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht201372 \nGood luck!\n\nA: There are 2 ways to reset.

I'm a VMware Fusion user and am trying out Parallels since VMware has some quirks that are annoying on Mountain Lion on a retina MacBook Pro (16 GB RAM). \nI'm wondering about the baffling Parallels recommendation (when configuring a VM) that there is a maximum cap of 4 GB of RAM for a VM with Parallels (indeed, it recommends 1.5 GB for Windows 8). (See this forum thread.) Granting anything more would, in fact, slow down both the host and client, but I have no problem assigning 8 GB of RAM to a VM in Fusion; before really committing to Parallels, I'd like to know the rationale behind such a recommendation (and no, the Parallels forums don't shine satisfactory light on the subject, at least from what I've been able to dig up). \nIf you're running in an x64 environment for both host and client then there shouldn't be any acceptable reason for needing to cap the RAM. Apparently, Parallels support states \"because Windows is working in a virtual environment, that it only needs max 1-3 GB.\" My development machine and environment is not a toy, so such an answer seems borderline patronizing and makes me think they're simply covering up for a significant Parallels limitation. \nUPDATE October 26, 2012 ---\nWell, look at that. Latest update released today (October 26, 2012) now allows \"assigning up to 16 GB of memory to a single virtual machine.\"\nSee http://kb.parallels.com/115024\n\nYou can now assign up to 16 GB of memory (RAM) to a single virtual machine.\n  Support for Windows Server 2012.\n  New, more intuitive design to optimize Windows for working on Retina displays.\n  Easily check the reclaiming disk space progress with a new progress bar.\n\nHowever, I've installed and checked, and it still says \"For best performance, set available memory to be within the recommended range of 512 MB to 4096 MB. Allocating memory outside of this range can slow down both the guest OS and your Mac.\"\nThe mystery continues...\n\nA: It might be that the majority of the OSes that people virtualise (or at least those doing so with Parallels) can only use 4 GB of RAM anyway because they are 32-bit OSes, so it would not be necessary to have more than that. You shouldn't need more than 4 GB of RAM in the virtual machine anyway, so you partly answered your question. The majority of laptops these days don't have a massive 16 GB of RAM like you do; Parallels is only looking at the market side of things there.\nIf you really need more, why don't you just Boot Camp (you can Boot Camp with Linux as well); that way, you will use all of your computer's power if you need it. With your SSD, it won't take too long to restart.\n\nA: Figured I would update this post long after. With Parallels 9, there is no longer the non-sensical recommendation capped at 4GB:\n\n", "Q: Tiled window switcher I'm a big iTerm user with 3 split panes on a 30\" monitor.

I own a mid 2010 6,2 MBP and I am considering the upgrade to a SSD. I would probably get a 256GBs SSD and replace my optical drive for the older HDD, so I can have a little more of capacity, as I seldom use CD/DVD anyway (and could use an eternal USB wrapper if that was the case).\nI recently changed my HDD and used disk utility to clone the older one to the new one (which I assume copies the exact blocks rather than operating on the \"file data\" itself, right?). Everything went flawlessly :) But here the new HDD was bigger and I did not have to take much care hence.\nNow I want to upgrade from a 750GBs HDD to a 256GBs SSD. I have some doubts on the best approach to achieve so. Initially, it would be easy to remove or backup unwanted files so I would reach something below 256GBs, maybe like 200GBs of used space. But Would eliminating data and resizing the partition be efficient, regarding the way the data is stored on disk? \nI mean, OSX using HFS is somewhat spoken about as not having to perform defragmentation operations, is that REALLY true? If I have 200GBs of the 750GBs on HDD used and resize that partition to, say, 205GBs, for performing the cloning operation to the new SSD, would that be efficient? SSDs perform better on random access writes and reads, but I would like to have my data as continuous as possible, specially if I consider that I will not defragment a SSD, because of the durability issues. :-) If I resized and cloned that older partition, should I worry about data fragmentation or am I just being paranoid?\nFurthermore, every once in a while I read people recommending fresh installs. The point is that I HATE wiping my O.S. out for reinstalling it. Hence, my MBP initially had snow leopard, which was updated to lion, which was updated to mountain lion. I NEVER did a fresh install. That concerns me in two ways: Could my data be too much fragmented on the disk, without my knowledge (call me paranoid..)? Furthermore! Am I losing too much performance? For instance, I never achieved those incredibly low boot times that I constantly read people reporting (even with similar specs and almost no login itens or additional kexts loaded). My MBP performs well, it is not as if I NEEDED a fresh install because it is annoying me. However, I am a little perfectionist regarding performance/organization sometimes, I have downloaded installed and removed several applications, libraries, frameworks, they all leave some minor and annoying configuration files and stuff. But I do not know if a fresh install would bring me enough benefits.\nAny advice here? :) I know the question is not the most deterministic one, but I appreciate any advices! Thanks in advance.\n\nA: I'd advise just keeping things simple and clone it over if you can easily get your data down to the smaller size, otherwise do a new install and use Migration Assistant (not for any supposed performance benefits, just that it's simpler).\nFragmentation is not an issue with SSDs because the physical location of the data doesn't change the performance characteristics—each block has the same access time as any other, unlike a hard drive where it takes time to reposition the read/write head over the proper sectors.\nIn my experience the fresh install thing tends to be more of a Windows thing (and an older Windows thing at that). If you're experiencing specific performance issues, the consider a clean reinstall. But otherwise just clone or use Migration Assistant and enjoy the speed of a new SSD.\n", "Q: Time Machine cannot write to network drive under Mountain Lion I installed Mountain Lion yesterday and have only one problem. Time Machine, which worked under Lion on a WD Sharespace network drive, not gives a message that it cannot find the drive. Despite that, it can \"enter\" Time Machine with no problem and read all the saved backups. Time Machine itself shows the drive as available to be selected for backup. Finder also sees the drive. Lastly, the Time Machine backup volume which never had been visible on my desktop under Lion is now always there under Mountain Lion.\n\nA: My take from this Apple Discussion thread is that the solution causes Time Machine to create a full new backup rather than adding to the other backups, but previous backups will be kept (not sure of actual behavior). Anyway, here is the posted solution (edited formatting and grammar for readability):\n\nBy default, the WD Sharespace creates a hidden share called WD_Backup\n  and a user called wd_backup with a default password of backup.  \nUsing the example in the blog: \n\nsudo tmutil setdestination afp://user:pass@host/share\n\nand assuming the following: (all default settings with the exception of the WD Sharespace Server Name)\n\nServer Name: TimeMachine    \nVolume Name: DataVolume\nUser: wd_backup\nPassword: backup\n\nYou should execute the following in Terminal:\n\nsudo tmutil setdestination afp://wd_backup:backup@TimeMachine/WD_Backup\n\nIn addition, you can validate that you are using the correct User and Password details by:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Launching the Finder and clicking on 'Go' from the menu\n  \n*Clicking on 'Connect to Server...'\n  \n*Entering: \"afp://TimeMachine/WD_Backup\" in the Server Address field and clicking 'Connect'\nYou'll be prompted to enter the Username and Password to the share; the default username and password are stated above.   \nIf your machine cannot resolve the Time Machine Server Name, then replace \"TimeMachine\" with the IP address of your WD Sharespace server; this will mount a drive to the WD_Backup folder, underwhich you will find the .sparsefile that Time Machine uses to store your backup.  All this is covered in the WD Sharespace User Guide on page 46 under the Time Machine configuration section.\n\nNote that the original poster also wrote:\n\nHowever, if entering afp://wd_backup:backup@192.168.1.150/WD_Backup\n  instead of afp://192.168.1.150/WD_Backup it gets to mount it from\n  the Finder window (Command+K). I have tried this while writing this post,\n  because as you were so sure that it worked (even though for me the\n  \"straightforward\" solution does not work) I decided to try this last\n  thing!   Right now it is backing up everyting, so thank you very much\n  for all your help!\n\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Is it possible to zoom out in Safari on iPad 2? I am attempting to view a large internal webpage in safari, and some of the content overflows off the screen.\nIn desktop browsers, ctl+'-' would do the trick, but the touch interface has me perplexed. Pinching and scrolling were my first impulses, but neither worked. \nTapping and pinch-out work for zooming in and back to default quite nicely, but what is the method to zoom out from default? Is my only resort to have the webpage changed?\n\nA: It sounds to me like your only option will be to have the webpage redesigned a little. Chances are there are some CSS styles that are sending parts of the text off the screen.\nFor the site, sometimes they include a meta \"viewport\" tag, which could be causing some problems for you. If this is the case, they should be able to easily remove this tag. However, it is very likely this is not causing the problem.\nYou could also request they use a media query to make adjustments based off of your iPad.

The best way around this is to create an access control entry on the folder, and set it to be inherited to items created in (/copied into) it. 'Course, the Finder doesn't give you access to the inheritance controls, so you have to go to the command line:\nchmod +a \"group:staff allow list,add_file,search,delete,add_subdirectory,delete_child,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity,writesecurity,chown,file_inherit,directory_inherit\" ~/Public\n\nNote that this gives read & write access to all accounts in the staff group (which basically means all user accounts); if you want a bit more control, create a group in System Preferences > Users & Groups, and add just yourself and your friend's account to it, then use \"group:yourgroupname\" in the above command. Also, the inheritance only applies to items as they're created, so it won't apply to files and folders already in your Public folder; if you want it to apply to existing items, add chmod's -R option (chmod -R +a ...)\n", "Q: Partition one disk with 2 different filesystems Can I partition my portable 2.5 hard disk into 2 parts and then have one part as a Mac (ext journal) partition and the other as a NTFS filesystem?\n\nA: Yes, but…\nYou can use Disk Utility to partition your portable HDD into two separate partitions. You can then format one in the Mac format of your choosing. You can format the other as FAT, but you cannot format it as NTFS from within Disk Utility.\n\nHowever, take the same disk to a Windows computer, mount the FAT partition, and the use whatever program Windows uses for reformatting (sorry, I haven't really used Windows much since Windows 3.1/MS DOS 6.2), and you have what you are looking for.\n", "Q: Java 7 JRE Not Detected on Clean Install of Mountain Lion I know there similar questions on how to enable the Java 7 JRE on Mountain Lion when Apple's Java 6 JRE is installed as well.\nBut I just did a clean install of Mountain Lion, installed Java 7 JRE - not Java 7 JDK - and it is not being detected.\nI see the Java icon in System Preferences.

I would be interested in knowing which programs advertise themselves using Bonjour on my machine. Is there a way to do that?\n\nA: Although it might not satisfy your exact criteria, Tildesoft's Bonjour Browser can list all the all the bonjour services advertised on your local network and the hosts that are advertising them. \nI guess for locally advertised services you could drill down in Bonjour Browser to find the port number the service is advertised on, then use lsof to determine the application associated with it, For example:\nlsof -i | grep 57857\n\ngives\niTunes    36720   ...     TCP *:57857 (LISTEN)\n\nwhen I have iTunes running.\n\nA: The dns-sd command-line tool can be helpful for this, but learning to use it is a bit tricky.\nRunning dns-sd -B _services._dns-sd._udp will return a list of all available service types that currently being advertised. (The list is per interface, so there will be some redundancy.) If this is done on a Mac with no active network connection, the list will of course only contain services running on that machine.\nUsing that list, you can request information about the individual services types by running things like dns-sd -B _home-sharing._tcp (which lists iTunes Home Sharing instances), and then, given an instance name, you can run dns-sd -L \"Wes Campaigne’s Library\" _home-sharing._tcp to lookup information for a particular instance.\nTo be honest, though, this whole process is rather tedious, and it's exactly what Discovery (formerly Bonjour Browser) was built to do, so I highly recommend using that. Whichever way you do it, though, it may not always be clear what program is responsible for a given service entry.\nYou can use the strategy given in binarybob's answer to try to map service entries to running processes based on port number, but this may not always work. Another strategy is to run something like dns-sd -B _home-sharing._tcp which remains open and reports when instances are added or removed, then, one by one, quit various apps and (assuming it's not a system service) see which one's quitting triggers the removal message.\n\nA: Although classified as a legacy article, this very may well be what you are looking for: DNSServiceMetaQuery.\nAs outlined by the documentation:\n\nThis sample uses DNSServiceQueryRecord to send a Multicast DNS query that returns a list of Bonjour service types being advertised on the local network. Machines must be running mDNSResponder-58.6 (Mac OS X 10.3.4) or later in order to respond to this query.\n\nTo run DNSServiceMetaQuery on Mountain Lion (the included build does not run properly), go to the sample code link and click Download Sample Code.  Then, install Xcode if you haven't already.  Create a new project under the template of Mac OS X > Application > Command Line Tool.  \nOpen and copy all text in ~/Downloads/DNSServiceMetaQuery/DNSServiceMetaQuery.cand paste it into main.c of your new Command Line Tool project (replacing everything that was there in the template).  Next, you'll need to add CoreFoundation.framework to the project by clicking the project name in the sidebar > Build Phases and open the dropdown arrow next to Link Binary With Libraries.  Click the + button, search for CoreFoundation.framework, and add it.  Then click the Run button (looks like a play button) and wait for a Build Succeeded image.  Something should come from the button of the window with a log; this will display all of your Bonjour services. Make sure All Output is checked.\n", "Q: Opening/Mounting a .img file How would I do this?\nI have attempted double clicking on it (obviously) and I get an error of it saying that its not recognized.\nMy second though was using Disk Utility (the app) to try and change it from an img to an iso. The same error appeared saying that it was not recognized.\nMy last idea was to do some research on mounting from the terminal. The command that I used was \nmount -o loop userdata.img /mnt/testcache\n\nThe result of that was:\nmount: You must specify a filesystem type with -t.\n\nAfter that I just ran out of idea and ran out of search queries to try.\n\nA: Provided the image is a correct image file supported by OS X the correct command to mount would be hdiutil attach imagename.\nNot all files ending with .img are disk images at all, let alone supported by OS X. You can try to use file image name to see what this file actually might be, but even for valid classic image files this may just result in data as an answer.\nIt would be most helpful to know how or using which software this image was created.\n", "Q: How can I mirror my Mac display on my iPad? I don't know why i can't seem to find any info about this or even anyone asking the same question. I have an iMac and a new iPad. I want to mirror my Mac display on the iPad, so I can sit in another room with the iPad, the wireless keyboard and mouse. Since I'm using the keyboard and mouse, I don't need touch events to be translated. Also, since the iPad's resolution in landscape mode is 2048x1536, the Mac's resolution of 1920x1080 should fit in it without scaling. Letterboxing is okay.\n\n\n*\n\n*I'd prefer to do this via AirPlay Mirroring, if possible. I have AirServer installed, but it doesn't show up on my Mac (10.8.2) display settings page (\"No devices detected\"). Also, AirServer used to be what i needed (if you check the description on Cydia), but for some reason, the website is now only advocating the exact opposite of this.\n\n*I checked out Reflector, but it only does the opposite, and that's what everyone else in the world seems to be asking.\n\n*There's also an app called Air Display which does do Mac -> iOS, but it requires a server-client installation. I don't want that. The maximum I'm willing to install is an receiver client on the iPad.\n\n*I don't want to use a VNC server and client.\n\n*I'm okay with an AirPlay receiver app for the iPad, because the iPad doesn't natively receive AirPlay, it only broadcasts it.\n\n*AirView would have been it, but it's been taken off the store by Apple. \n\n\nHow can I do this?\n\nA: The Xscope mirror, a free tool works without needing VNC but you need a paid companion app on the Mac to send the data. \nI prefer to use screens on the iPad. VNC is the way that OS X sends it's video remotely to another display. If you don't use it, someone else needs to re-write that entire stack and it works very well for local networks.\nAs for why the app I recommend, it has an observe mode and seems to scale the screen much better than the Xscope app since it is designed primarily for designing, not mirroring. The same program works on iPad, iPod, iPhone of all sizes and retina or not displays. It is very fast and has an observe only mode so that you don't accidentally send touch events.\nIf you do decide to use it on the go for remote access, there is a free location app (similar to how Back to My Mac works) and works over ssh tunnels if you prefer more security than speed. It has great soft keyboard support and of course works with Linux and Windows as well. There is nothing I can say bad about it in terms of missing features os bugs or design. \nIt's a quality piece of software all around.\nIf you really must avoid VNC, there is another option. The Xscope app for software designers has a free companion app that runs on the iPad and will mirror your screen. It's more designed for counting pixels and looking at mockups you design on the Mac for eventual use on the iPad, but you can use it as a mirroring solution. It lacks any input from the iPad and simply sends the screen from the Mac to iOS.\nIt also is very high quality software - and is well designed, all around and fast.\n\nA: What's wrong with VNC? It's secure, can use compression (which I've found is the only way to make it responsive over a home broadband connection), and is supported natively in OSX. You'll just need to install a VNC client on the iPad, and activate it in the iMac's System Preferences.\nI don't have an iPad, but I'd be surprised if there wasn't a decent VNC client app for it. I use ssvnc to connect to my Mac, which is a free Java client and I use it from KDE on my laptop and desktop at least; I'd be surprised if it was in the App store, but there should be alternatives.\nAir Server looks good though, and is the only option you didn't rule out. It's designed for the task of 'mirroring', so file a bug report or something. If you paid for it, it should work.\n\nA: Use iDisplay app, that does just what you need, supports mirroring for up to 36 iOs devices.\n\nA: Old topic but I stumbled upon it today. If you only want to get images over, there is Skala Preview, it's free and it's good!

After a couple of minutes the symbol re-appears. Syncing via USB works flawlessly.\nThis is very annoying, especially because I don't get any error message. The device's symbol simply disappears.\n\nA: I have experienced similar issues from time to time. Normally, if the device is ineligible to sync (for example, if it somehow disconnected from the same wifi that the computer is on), it will disappear from iTunes in the same way if you were to disconnect an iOS 4 device that had been plugged in with USB. I'm guessing the device's connection is somewhat faulty, and is ultimately responsible for it's disappearing (this is just my guess/thought). \nI have found, however, that if I initiate the sync from the iOS device after it has disappeared, that it will typically come back and work well. This can be done from Settings > General > iTunes Wi-fi Sync.\n", "Q: Unzipped files mystery location? I used the Terminal to unzip a file by typing Unzip then dragging the file to terminal. The file unzipped successfully and a few GBs were used from my SDD. However, I have no idea where the files are !!! I can't find them in the same folder of the zip file. \nWhere would they be ?\n\nA: Maybe in your Home folder? It's the default folder the terminal points to. Try to open it through the Go menu in the finder.\n\nA: If you can, search for the files name. If it shows up, press or long press (click or right click) the file. Hopefully you'll be able to see the file storage path.\n", "Q: secure erasing empty space without destroying the disk I know I can use Disk Utility to secure erase a disk. \nMy question is: I have a disk half empty. I would like to know if there's a way to secure erase the empty part of the disk. I mean, an app/command that can identify those empty sectors of the disk and give them a secure erase treatment. \nthanks.\n\nA: If you are referring to a partition, then you can also do it with Disk Utility:\nFirst, select the partition on the list on the left, go to the \"Erase\" tab on the right and use \"Erase Free Space ...\". On the dialog that shows now you can choose the level of security (i.e., how many times the data should be overwritten) and then click \"Erase Free Space\".\nIf you are talking about space on a disk with no active partition then I think you need to create a partition first that you can then erase.\n", "Q: Backing up External drive to Time Machine - what if it's not connected? I have 2 x 1 TB drive that I use interchangeably. 1 holds Video and the other Photos. I only have 1 connected when I'm working (using Premiere or Lightroom). I have a 2 TB NAS for making redundant copy of the other 2 drives.So far I've been doing the copying manually. \nI'm considering of using Time Machine to make proper backup sets (though I'm always only interested in the latest set). I know that I can set Time Machine to backup to NAS over the network and include any external drives connected to the mac at the time.\nQUestion now is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Will Time Machine \"craps out\" if it can't find the external drive?\n\n*Does Time Machine handle backing up the external drives - one at a time - only when it's connected - without thinking the files/volume had been deleted?\n\n\nA: *\n\n*I also have my external HDD connected from time to time. To answer to Afmrak, Time Machine only prepares (stashes) backups once it finds out you connected your Time Machine HDD. So if you haven't connected your HDD for some time, it will take a while for Time Machine to prepare and make backup.\n\n*I have never been backing up external volumes.\n\nA: Finally tried doing it myself:\n\n\n*\n\n*Time Machine handles non connected drives gracefully. No error msg popping out. When the drive is connected then it would start the backing up process.\n\n*Time Machine seems to handle partitions/volumes independent to one another. So if only either one of the harddrives are connected, it will happily process the one that's connected\n\n\nA: To answer your first question:\nI'm pretty sure Mac OS X TimeMachine continues to run when the external drive isn't present by stashing file diffs on the local drive. When the external TimeMachine drive is reconnected it pushes the stashed changes over.\nI can't vouch for the storage saving schemes (if any) it has while backing up locally, but the feature is there.\n", "Q: OS X 10.5/10.6/10.7, Search, Spotlight I'm handling a migration from an on old Mac server to a Windows Server 2008 R2 machine running a 12 TB (10 usable) RAID 5 server. It's using an SMB share and now the OS X 10.5/10.6 users can search -  sometimes it works, but takes up to 10 minutes. The OS X 10.7 machine seems to be fine. I've looked in the root of the shared drive for a .Spotlight-V100 file (ls -a) but it doesn't seem to be there. mdutil says indexing is on for that volume and I have cleared the index using mdutil -E /Volumes/MeSharedVolume numerous times. Any ideas?\n\nA: SMB Shares are indexed locally by the client since SMB does not support remote queries by spotlight. You need to wait for each client to finish indexing to be able to search.\n", "Q: How can I change the shortcut keys for my MacBook Pro so it doesn't conflict with my remote Windows shortcuts? From my MacBook Pro, I use a Java program that allows me to remotely connect to my Windows computer.  I use Outlook on this Windows computer where normally I use shortcut keys like ControlF2 or ControlF4 to categories emails in Outlook. \nSo for ControlF2 it actually works fine but I need to press fnControlF2. The issue is when I press fnControlF4 it seems that it's an Apple shortcut to rotate through apps, so it trumps what I am actually trying to do on the Windows machine.\nIs there any workaorund to this issue? Is there a way I can turn off some of the Apple shortcuts or anything else to deal with this?\nUpdate\nI created a bounty to answer the question that I listed as a comment on the first answer:\nWhat is weird is that F2 and F4 are both checked so I don't understand why F2 works but F4 doesn't in my Outlook. Also, after unchecking F4 and trying to categorize in Outlook the shortcut still doesn't work. After turning off all of the Apple shortcuts, it seems that F2, F6, and F8 work but others don't. Any explanation?\n\nA: You can disable some of the F-key shortcuts in System Preferences:\n\n\nA: Take a look at our application ShortStop which was made specifically for sending shortcuts through remote screen sessions.\n\nA: Just a suggestion: Look at the key mapping in windows and not the Mac side.  remember that while Command is often control in windows, often times the option, fn, and control keys can be swapped.  \n\nA: It's not easy to test if it work without having your Java program and your windows environment.\nHowever in Settings > Keyboard there is a flag Use all F1, F2, etc keys as standard function keys. If you check it you have to press fn+Fx for using the special features printed on the Fx keys.\n\nOn my system (Mountain Lion), when this flag is unchecked fn+control+F4 produces the effect you reported: rotate through apps. This is the shortcut mentioned in Lauri Ranta's answer. When I check the flag the keys combination doesn't produced the mentioned rotation. You can try to uncheck it.\nIf your problem persist you can try to remap shortcut under Windows, in this way you can assign the command associated to fn+control+F4 to another combination which is not used under OS X.\nIn this question on Super User they said that it's not possible to change Ctrl shortcuts under Outloook. However they suggest to use AutoHotKey to assign a script that sends Ctrl+F4 to Outlook when you press another combination of keys (which you can decide). Here you can find more information.\n", "Q: \"brew link node\" creates/removes different number of symlinks when repeated I was upgrading Node.js node through Homebrew's brew upgrade, and it didn't link correctly.\n\n$ brew update\n(snip-snip formulae were updated)\n$ brew upgrade\n(snip-snip other upgrades)\n==> Upgrading node\n==> Downloading http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.8.11/node-v0.8.11.tar.gz\n######################################################################## 100.0%\n==> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/node/0.8.11\n==> make install\n==> Caveats\nHomebrew installed npm.\nWe recommend prepending the following path to your PATH environment\nvariable to have npm-installed binaries picked up:\n/usr/local/share/npm/bin\nWarning: Could not link node.

Every time it updates node homebrew puts the newest version alongside the old one and then updates the symlinks to the newest version. Running the brew cleanup should reduce that up a bit for you.\n", "Q: Sound recorder for Mac OS X I'm looking to record lectures with my MacBook Pro this year. Is there any good, free software that is capable of producing recordings from a potential distance?\n\nA: If you just want a simple way to record audio, you can use the QuickTime Player application. Just choose File > New Audio Recording, and hit record.\nAs was mentioned already, the quality of your recording is going to be highly dependent on your microphone. The internal one is likely to pick up a lot of extra noise -- but you never know until you try. If you do get an external microphone, QuickTime Player also lets you record from other input sources (use the pulldown menu on the right side).\n\nA: you can use any audio recording software, for example AudaCity I don't know the recording quality of MacBook Pro but you could buy a small directional microphone and record lectures from a distance.\n", "Q: Can I place a Western Digital RE3 WD1002FBYS in a MacPro1,1? I have a bare WD1002FBYS and am wondering if I can place this into a MacPro1,1 (the first Desktop MacPro).\n\nA: Yes, just like any other 3.5\" SATA harddrive, provided you have a spare bay to populate.\n", "Q: Spotlight re-index every time I restart/boot iMac I have an iMac Late 2006 with Lion installed. I don't know since when, but since 3-4 weeks ago I am having this problem. \nThe point is, every time I restart my iMac or boot it, Spotlight starts to reindex again.\nI already test to disable Spotlight, remove /.Spotlight-V100 and enable Spotlight again but it didn't solve it. I don't know how to debug/detect the problem but it is so bad, because it impacts on iMac performance...\nI don't know if it is important, but I also have installed Windows 7 on Bootcamp. However it is marked as non-indexing volume on Spotlight's Preferences. I also tried to repair permissions, but it didn't work.\n\nA: I \"fixed\" it forcing a new indexation but excluding the User directory. What happens? It is too slow, but has an end. Not is eternal.

Can someone verify this please? Or is there some way to do it on the phone itself?\n\nA: There is no way to create a smart playlist on the iPhone itself. You have to use iTunes for that. \nI think that’s really stupid.\n", "Q: Could software cause the iPhone's home button to become unresponsive? \nPossible Duplicate:\nFlaky iPhone 4 Home Button \n\nI've got an iPhone 4, and for a while now the home button has been quite unresponsive.  Sometimes I need to press the button around 5 or 6 times for it to register.  However, I noticed that once I restore it to factory settings, the home button goes back to normal.\nOnce I put my apps and music on the iphone once again, the home button problem reappears.  Has anyone heard of a problem like this, or is it just a coincidence? What can be done to fix it? Should I reinstall iTunes and re-download all my apps?\n\nA: Do you close your open applications often? If you tap twice on your home button so the last used apps bar on the bottom comes up there if you hold any of those icons for about 2 seconds pushed in, where after they will start to jiggle and you'll see an red close icon on the top left of those recently opend apps icons will show. Tap that! and the app will close and make space in memory. If opening up memory by hand doesn't work I'd suggest you check the connection of the button.\n", "Q: How do I use Fandango with Passbook? I just purchased a ticket for a movie tonight using the Fandango app on my iPhone 4S running iOS 6. I know that Fandango is one of the current few Passbook supported apps. What I don't know is how to ensure that my tickets will show up in Passbook. Is there anything special I have to do? The Walgreens app prompted me to put my card in Passbook so I was expecting similar behavior from Fandango. Will the tickets just show up in Passbook closer to showtime?\n\nA: Only certain theaters are capable of mobile ticketing. In the Fandango app when viewing theaters which can accept mobile tickets you will see a notification which says \"Mobile ticket available.\" If you do not see this indicator a mobile device cannot be used as a ticket at this theater and therefore tickets will not show up in Passbook. That said, you can still purchase tickets for the theater and use a confirmation code at the box office.\n", "Q: When I click the Appstore button in Passbook I receive the error: \"Cannot connect to the iTunes store\" When I click on App Store, which rests below all of the features that Apple touts for the service, I am given an error where a prompt tells me that my phone can’t access the App Store. The error looks like this:\n\nIs there a fix for this problem?\n\nA: Gotta Be Mobile provides a great article detailing the issue with Passbook and a fix. I've reposted the fix from the article below:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*First, head to the Settings in your iPhone.\n  \n*Click on General.\n  \n*Next, head to Date and Time which is down the list.\n  \n*Once you’re in there, you’ll want to change Set Automatically to Off.\n  \n*Go to Set Date & Time.\n  \n*Click on Today’s Date. Once you do that, you’ll be given the option to change the date.\n  \n*Move the year one year forward one year.\n  \n*This will prevent the error from happening. If you wish to change the date back to the real date, simply set Set Automatically to On and\n  everything will return to normal.\n  \n*Head into Passbook and click the App Store button\n  \n\nSomething about moving the date up might be expiring a certificate or just the adjustment of time back to correct seems to make passbook behave better.\n", "Q: Why were my contacts synced to my mother's iPhone? I have recently downloaded the new software on my iphone, iOS 6. My mother and my sister also use my Apple ID to download their apps too.\nToday my mother downloaded iOS 6 and all of my contacts were transfered to her iPhone. I would like to know how to remove my contacts from her device. I already tried logging out of my Apple ID from her device but all my contacts are still on her device.\n\nA: Sharing a single Apple Id can save you money when downloading apps or music, but can cause confusion when attempting to use other Apple services associated with your Apple Id. In this particular instance I would venture your contact showed up on your mom's phone because she signed into iCloud with your Apple Id. By default iCloud syncs a lot of information:\n\n\n*\n\n*Contacts\n\n*Calendars\n\n*Reminders\n\n*Safari\n\n*Passbook\n\n*Photo Stream\n\n*Documents and Data\n\n*Find My iPhone\n\n\nIf you go to Settings > iCloud you can toggle these services to on or off. Unfortunately, what I don't know is if toggling contacts off will remove the already synced contacts.\nAbout a year ago I asked the question: how many Apple IDs should one household have? This spawned a lot of great answers and I definitely recommend reading it. To summarize it's okay to use the one account for purchases, but I would recommend having additional accounts for iCloud, Facetime etc.\n\nA: There is a workaround that involves creating fake exchange account but I would recommend just setup them their own apple IDs (it's free anyway), restore while registering with iCloud with their IDs and use you ID for App Store if you must to.\n\nA: Go into your iCloud on the computer, log in with the Apple ID, and go into settings. Remove the unwanted phone (phone B) from the iCloud. At the bottom, select restore contacts, and select a backup that is dated before the date of the merge. Create a separate Apple ID for phone B, sign out of iCloud from it's settings and sign in from a the newly created one. The contacts on phone A will be restored to the ones prior to the merge, so delete the unwanted contacts manually from phone B and back those up to the new iCloud. Issue resolved.\n", "Q: Moving Folders using iCloud Can I move ENTIRE folders (Pages documents, Numbers spreadsheets, photos) to iCloud, or do I have to move each separately...documents to Pages app, spreadsheets to Numbers app and photos to iPhoto?  I have 10.7.5 OS...can I move entire Folder on new Mountain Lion OS?  Thanks.\n\nA: This isn't the \"supported\" procedure, but there's a good chance it will work to move a large number of documents to iCloud.\nYou still have to move documents kind by kind, but not within particular programs.\nIn the Finder, select the documents (not a folder; the Pages (for instance) that are in the folder) that you want moved to iCloud.\nSelect Copy from the Edit menu.\nPress ⌘⇧G to Go to Folder.\nType ~/Library/Mobile Documents/\nIf the folder com~apple~Pages exists, double-click it; if not, create it then double-click it.\nSelect Paste from the Edit menu.\nRepeat for the different kinds of files you want to open in their respective apps via iCloud.\n", "Q: Common Charger/Alternate Solution for iPad (new), Macbook Retina, iPhone5 I just recently did an upgrade to all apple products and have a retina Macbook Pro, an iPhone 5, and an iPad.\nI hate having to carry around 3 different chargers. I was wondering if there is an adapter, or something else that I can carry around instead. I wouldn't mind having 2 adapters that go into 1 charger, since that is better than 3 chargers. Basically\niPad ----------Ad\niPhone----------|-------------Power\nMacbook--------Ad\n\nAny help on this is greatly appreciated, since I haven't really found anyone else with this problem.\n\nA: While an iPad typically charges very slowly on a regular USB port, you could still use your MacBook Pro's USB ports to charge your devices. You definitely can charge your iPhone using your computer's USB port.\nThere also exists an accessory to \"plug\" a 10W USB port onto your MacBook Pro power adapter called PlugBug. This should be fine for charging your iPad.\n\nA: You can use\n\n\n*\n\n*one charger for both the iPad and the iPhone and another one for the MacBook\n\n*one charger for the MacBook and then (slowly) charge the iDevices via the MacBook\n\n\nA: Since Apple is not licensing its Magsafe connector you will not be able to buy some kind of universal power supply.\nAs of now there are also no third party products with Lighting connector. So best you can do is to use Lightning to 30 pin Dock Connector adaptor with your iPad cable to charge and sync iPhone 5\n", "Q: How to upgrade a mac from 10.4? An old MacBook still running 10.4 just showed up. Unfortunately, 10.4 isn't new enough to run the software it needs to run, so I'm trying to figure out how to upgrade it something newer.\nThe usual answers seem to be to buy a Snow Leopard box set and work from there, but Apple doesn't sell those anymore, at least not as far as I can tell. From what I can find, they actually don't sell any physical upgrade media, which is a bit of a problem, since this mac obviously doesn't have the App Store.\nWhat's the best way to deal with this?\nThanks!\n\nA: If you are in the US or Canada, you can call 1-800-MY-APPLE to order Snow Leopard directly from Apple telesales. It should only be $20, a discount from the original $30 price. \nThis will only work if you have an Intel Mac, of course. \n", "Q: external drive for ios products I just purchased a cloud ftp usb adapter for my ipad so i can access my data.\nWhat these companies dont tell you is that the ipad must sync or download the files from hdd to ipad to access the data, which makes it ridiculous if your trying to watch video or listen to music.\nMy question is: Does anyone know how to stream the data from an external storage device so that accessing feel natural like a laptop?\nedit: Air Video with a mac mini server pretty much did what i was looking for. Hopefully a HDD that offers something similar will be available soon.\n\nA: Apple TV does most of this especially if u pay $25 a year for iTunes Match. Anything downloaded is available on all devices including the Apple TV...\n\nA: Why not just use Dropbox for this? You can copy your audio and video to your Dropbox folder, install the Dropbox client on your computers and mobile devices, and let it keep your files in sync across all of your machines. \n", "Q: Hidden folder in /Users/Shared that has MD5-encrypted name of another user I was familiarizing myself with some of the hidden files in OS X (while cleaning house) and I came across a hidden folder inside the /Users/Shared directory. It's name is \".\" followed by a 32-character hex string, which (I googled the string) is the MD5-encrypted version of the name of my user account on this computer.\nThe folder was created in 2008, but last modified just two days ago (which leads me to believe it's been accessed somewhat regularly). It contains three files: \".\" (4 KB document, created and modified two days ago), \"..\" (Zero KB document, created and modified in 2008), and \"Temporary Items\" (4 KB document, created and modified two days ago).\nIs this normal, or is something strange going on?

I'm using a PowerPC Mac running 10.4.11 (yeah, I know).\n\nA: Your question appears to be slightly incomplete, however the first two files are standard unix \"files\".\n. is the shortcut for the current directory;\n.. is the shortcut for the directory up one in the tree.\nA lot of Unix shells require you to completely specify the path to an executable when executing them from the command line, and an example you may have seen:\n./Make\n\nIs a request to execute the file Make in the current directory.\nSimilarly, using the command\ncd ..\n\nIs a request to change the directory to the parent of the current directory.\nYour third file is not named in your question so I cannot provide an answer for that.\n", "Q: How many cores does a Mid 2012 Macbook Air have? I checked the specs, and the i5-3427U CPU has 2 cores.\nBut the Activity Monitor shows 4 little charts for the CPU, so it looks like 4 cores. \nWhich is correct? Why does the Activity Monitor have 4 charts?\n\nA: To find for sure how many cores you have is by opening a terminal (e.g via Spotlight and searching for Terminal) and then run\nsystem_profiler | less\n\nit'll dump out a bunch of info. Look for the category called \"hardware\" (which is close to the top of all the info) and an entry called \"Total Number of Cores\".  There you will find your answer.\nIf you don't want to browse through all the output, a simple\nsystem_profiler | grep 'Total Number of Cores'\n\ngives you the result directly.\nOr use the \"About this Mac\" (Apple icon in top left) > more info > system report, that shows how many cores you have.\n\nA: Here's a Terminal command that directly outputs how many cores you have:\nsysctl hw.ncpu\n\nIf you care to distinguish between logical cores and physical cores, these are also available:\nsysctl hw.physicalcpu\nsysctl hw.logicalcpu\n\nSource: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1715580/how-to-discover-number-of-logical-cores-on-mac-os-x\n\nA: Your computer has 2 cores, but 4 logical processors. What you are seeing is Intel's hyper-threading technology. This technology puts multiple logical processors on a single core, so that each core can run multiple threads at once.\nThe difference between this and multiple cores is that hyper-threading only duplicates the parts of the processor which control the current state, not the actual execution unit, but multiple cores duplicate everything. This means that your computer will run like it has four cores only if the threads on each core are using different parts of the execution unit, but if the exact same thing was running on both threads in a single core, it wouldn't be any faster than a two-core system without hyper-threading.\n", "Q: Can't find Trash in Finder or on Desktop I can't find the trashcan icon anywhere.\nI'm using OS X 10.7.4.

I'd love to know.\n=====[ UPDATE 10/1 11:40pm EST ]=====\nSolved but man I don't wish this on anyone.\nSo everything above is correct; my last issue was stopping the iCal Sync process from re-creating a bad cache file (with the invalid entries in it).\n\nI could not solve how to stop the syncing from occurring or where the setting even is.  (I turned off syncing in iTunes with my iPhone, but no difference.)\n\nThe final step...\nDownloaded \"SQLite Manager\" for Firefox and opened up the \"Calendar Cache\".  Then brushing off my SQL and poking around the tables, I found the few entries that had a negative start date and ran the query:\nUPDATE ZICSELEMENT\nSET ZDATESTAMP=309128967, ZENDDATE=303519600, ZSTARTDATE=303516000, ZTITLE=\"INVALID EVENT\"\nWHERE ZSTARTDATE < 0\n\nSo far, so good... but really? ...\nAll iCal has to do is validate the start and end times for entries to stop this from occurring.  Or at the very least prevent sync from recreating the bad entries.\n", "Q: Which php.ini file do I have to edit on Mountain Lion? I recently upgraded to Mountain Lion and reconfigured my apache2 (https.conf) file in the terminal to load PHP and start automatically.  \nMy localhost/~username/phpinfo.php page comes up to show my PHP configuration (php.ini).  I see that upload_files is set to ON and the max_size_upload is set to 20MB.  However, the upload_tmp_dir isn't set (it says NO VALUE).  I assume the default tmp directory is \"/tmp\".  \nWhen I do \n$ cd /etc/\n$ sudo nano php.ini.default \n\ngoto the upload_tmp_dir and I remove the ; in front of it and enter the value /tmp (save and exit).\nI still see NO VALUE for the upload_tmp_dir when I load my phpinfo.php.  I just wonder if I'm doing something wrong.  Any help is appreciated.\n\nA: /etc/php.ini.default serves only as a reference and is not read out by PHP at all. The built-in PHP installation will look for the file /etc/php.ini instead. This file is not present by default, but you can copy /etc/php.ini.default to /etc/php.ini and make your modifications in there. You could also just create an empty file and only add any directives you want to change from the default.\nMake sure you copy or create the file as root, so in Terminal you could do:\nsudo cp /etc/php.ini.default /etc/php.ini\nAfter modifying the php.ini, also make sure you restart Apache for the settings to take effect.\nIt is good practice to not modify /etc/php.ini.default directly, so you can use it as a reference if anything goes wrong with your /etc/php.ini.\n\nA: If you have multiple installations of php, then you should use the php command to find the ini files. \n$ /usr/local/opt/php56/bin/php --ini\nConfiguration File (php.ini) Path: /usr/local/etc/php/5.6\nLoaded Configuration File:         /usr/local/etc/php/5.6/php.ini\nScan for additional .ini files in: /usr/local/etc/php/5.6/conf.d\nAdditional .ini files parsed:      (none)\n\n", "Q: 10.7.5 on a late 2009 MacBook Pro crashes Ever since I installed Lion on my late 2009 MacBook Pro, it crashes several times a day randomly during some operation (open an application, browse the net, add photos, etc.). \nI read the answer about updating Show Crash Prefs in System Preferences and tried to do it, but it doesn't work. \nI updated Info.plist file with text editor exactly as in the answer, but the Finder still doesn't give the option of selecting new Show Crash Prefs? \nAm I missing something? \n\nA: Try the following two troubleshooting techniques:\n\n\n*\n\n*download the latest Combo updater for your OS (note this is different than simply going to the Apple menu > Software Update) and reboot\n\n\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/DL1582?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\n\n\n*\n\n*do a Safe Boot:\n\n\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT1455\nThen report back.\n\nA: Does Console give you any information about the crashes that appear at random?

I would like to upgrade to a solid state disk. But will I benefit from a disk with read/write speeds of 500 mb/s? Or what is the max speed that is supported by my SATA controller?\nThank you in advance\n\nA: You can find the speed of your SATA controller with the System Information application, by clicking system report > hardware > Serial ATA. Which in my case (a 15\" 2.53GHz 2010 MBP) shows the following:\nIntel 5 Series Chipset:\n\n  Vendor:                   Intel\n  Product:                  5 Series Chipset\n  Link Speed:               3 Gigabit\n  Negotiated Link Speed:    3 Gigabit\n  Description:              AHCI Version 1.30 Supported\n\n3 Gigabit means the maximum uncoded transfer rate is 2.4 Gbit/s or about 300MB/s (286MiB/s).\nIn conclusion: a 500MB/s disk is probably overkill.\n", "Q: How to fix this disk has 2 partions popup on external HD I've been recently getting this message when I try to eject my external HD, I only use it for Time Machine backups. How do I stop this message form appearing?\n\n\nA: It certainly looks like that disk was at some point partitioned. Open Disk Utility, click on the disk and look under the Partition panel. Disk Utility will show the current partition scheme, and whether you can repartition the disk without losing data. But back up your data onto another disk or your computer before trying that! \nIn the unlikely event this is just a glitch, you should certainly run Disk Utility Repair!\n", "Q: Why is the number of unread messages in Messages negative? Occasionally, and with no apparent correlation with what is going on on other devices where I have Messages enabled, I get a negative count for my unread messages in Messages on OS X:\n\nWhat could be causing this, and how can I prevent from happening in the future?\n\nA: I believe that negative numbers show up when you read a message on another device before you read it on what ever device has the negative number.

I have tested many apps and I would like to review them in the Apple Store. I use an iPad. \nI don't want to review apps under the account my credit card is tied to. \nHow can I review apps anonymously?\n\nA: You cannot review anonymously but Apple offers feedback through this form here.\n\nA: As mentioned on this post:\n\nIf you're using a Mac, open the macOS App Store and click on your name at the bottom of the sidebar on the left. If prompted, sign into your Apple ID. Then, click \"View Information\" from the upper right of the account page. Once the next page loads, scroll down to the \"Manage\" section. Here you will see your nickname and have the option to edit it. Changing the nickname here will change how the nickname appears when leaving comments/reviews on apps.\nIf you are using a Windows computer, you can change your nickname by clicking Account > View My Account. If prompted, sign in with your Apple ID. Scroll to the \"Settings\" section and click the edit button next to your nickname\n\nYou can change the username if the name is what you are concerned about. aside from that, there is no option to post a review anonymously.\n\nA: I see you said your underlying reason for anonymity is\n\nto keep me save from attacks if I leave very critical feedback to totally junk apps and privacy\n\nThere are a few ways you could approach this.\n\n*\n\n*Remember the person reading the reviews is an actual person, so treat them politely.\n\n*Leave the most scathing, scorched-earth, disingenuous review possible, and if they try to DOX you, oh well.\n\n*Don't bother leaving a review, instead go have a coffee or something else enjoyable.\n\nLet's talk about #1, because it sounds like you want to leave a review, but not get any pushback from it. I would suggest you concentrate on the app and not the developer(s). Try to offer some kind of actionable solution with every criticism. And be nice, as if you were writing a review for your own app.\nSay:\nI found the app's menu to be a bit confusing. It would make more sense to use a standard control like a hamburger—or something closer to Apple's Human Interface Design suggestions—instead of a triangle, which isn't a common element for displaying menus.\nDon't say:\nThis was the absolute worst app I've ever seen!

Is it somehow possible to share it using SMB in Mountain Lion? It appears on the client but with nothing on it. I have read that on older OS X versions, it was possible by editing /etc/smb.conf but is that still relevant? I don't seem to have one of those on my hard drive.\n\nA: You don't have to manually edit a configuration file; it's possible to share drives via SMB using the Sharing control panel. Under the File Sharing service, hit the \"Options...\" button to enable SMB:\n\nThis will make your shared folders accessible via SMB to the specified users. It shouldn't matter what the source filesystem is (FAT, HFS, or other) as long as your Mac can access it.\nIf you don't see any contents from the client, make sure you've added your drive as a shared folder, and that you've given users the appropriate permissions.\n\nA: There does not seem to be an answer for this, I went with smbup which \"replaces\" the Mac OS X SMB with an open source dito. The other option I have seen is to reformat it to a native mac format (but that is not an option for me)\n", "Q: Why are emails from Find My iPhone in the wrong locale/language?

I would like to get the Xcode-developer things to my Macs. I noticed that Apple has started to offer some terminal things online, more here. I am still lazy to get the CDs, to get all Xcode-developer things, is there some easy way to do it online without the Xcode CD?

I just noticed that Time Machine is backing up 15 GB (it's been running for a few hours; this means that Time Machine thinks that 15 GB of data changed in one hour which is absurd). I've only been doing some programming in the Terminal, and the usual web browsing/iTunes etc.\nWhy is this happening? Is there a way to see which files does Time Machine think changed this much? How to stop this behavior?\nEdit: It just occured to me that the two times it happened I was using a VMWare Virtual Machine. Is it possible that Apple made the terrible oversight of not having a working binary diff and it's backing up the Virtual Machine image in its entirety every time?\n\nA: Yes, it is the whole virtual disk which gets saved, there is no binary diff. \n\nA: To Time Machine a file is a file and if it is changed the file is copied again.  This is required due to the - rather ingenious - way that hard links are used to have multiple backups use the same single file \"on disk\".\nI found a reasonable solution to make virtual disks work well with Time Machine.  Namely to make a sparse disk image and put the virtual machine over there.  Then OS X automatically maintains a lot of single, small files comprising your virtual machine disk and only those actually affected needs to be backed up automatically.\nSee http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20040625012304236 for instructions how to release claimed but unused space from the sparse disk image.\n\nA: The way I do it is using GrandPerspective (Open Source - http://grandperspectiv.sourceforge.net).\nYou first need to be able to see the Time Machine backups. The backups are in an sparser image that you need to mount with Disk Utility. The sparser file is called \"MachineName.sparsebundle\"\nOnce mounted you will see a new disk called \"Time Machine Backups\".\nStart the application GrandPerspective and when asked for the folder or drive to scan, you select the folder with the last backup, this will look something like : \n\"Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/MachineName/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS\"\nTo select the last backup you will need to select the folder with the closest date or sort by date of creation.\nOnce GrandPerspective has finished, you will see a graph showing pretty much the same than if you had scanned the hard drive that you backed up. The difference is that most of those files are hard links to previous versions. So you can asked GrandPerspective to filter all the Hard Links. To do that, select \"Window/Filter…\", then select the filter \"No Hard Links\" and press Ok.\nYou will now see a new GrandPerspective window with only the files that where backed up on that last backup.\nNote that this instructions only work with the last backup as is the only one that the backed up files will not have any hard links.\nIf you want to analyse the whole time machine backups, then I recommend you to try the instructions given here:\nhttp://grandperspectiv.sourceforge.net/HelpDocumentation/HowToAnalyseTimeMachineBackups.html\n", "Q: How can I hide an Application from the Updates Tab in the Mac App Store? I had an app on my MacBook that I never used. I recently did a clean install of Mountain Lion on the same MacBook (not using the Migration Assistant or anything to copy my old data).

It's supposedly trying to backup 40GB and after 8 hours not even 1 GB is done. I have to stop it because I have to take my 2009 Macbook running Lion out.\nI ran Volume Repair on the external HD and everything came back fine. I also tried manually copy pasting a large video file to that volume and it copied quite fast.

Including stuff that will be removed?\n\nA: I believe this is a staleness prevention.  That whenever there is too long between backups Time Machine uses a more thorough way to ensure that the backup is complete.\nIt is my understanding that the 40 GB is a \"this is how much we consider for backing up\" and that the actual data transferred may prove to be a lot less if the files turned out to still be identical.\nBased on your description I believe that you have reached a point where you need to let your Time Machine backup catch up - work on its own until it is done, if at all possible.  If you cannot wait for that, perhaps now is a good time to buy a new drive and use that instead and have the old drive as a backup backup.\n\nA: Killing Spotlight before running Time Machine worked for me.

The likely culprit isn't software (though you could try using an external keyboard/mouse and attempt to reproduce) but hardware. The top case's USB connection is likely failing.\n\nA: I finally fixed this on my 13\" MacBook Pro early 2011. The cause was a solder failure in the Airport/WiFi ribbon cable.\nDiagnosis steps: \n\n\n*\n\n*boot up the MacBook on a solid, flat surface\n\n*open the Applications > Utilities > Console.app\n\n*wait for the console messages to stop\n\n*pick up the MacBook as you normally do. In particular, experiment with pressure in the center of the bottom of the MacBook. This is where several ribbon cables connect to the logic board.\n\n*watch the console; if you start seeing AppleUSBEHCI timeout messages then you have tweaked the hardware somehow to induce the problem\n\n*open up the System Report; select USB and see if any devices are missing. In my case, Bluetooth USB Host Controller disappeared after I picked up my MacBook, so this pointed to the USB/WiFi connector\n\n\nWorkaround: once you have the MacBook on a stable surface, you can usually restore trackpad/keyboard function by plugging something into the USB port (USB stick, mouse, etc...)\nFix: replace the Bluetooth/WiFi ribbon cable (in my case; you may have a different failed cable). \n", "Q: Is there any way to automatically set outgoing email address based on recipient's email or domain in mail.app? I'd like mail to be automatically be sent from an account based on domain the domain of the recipient.\nDetails:\nI've set up multiple email accounts in mail.app, both personal and work.  I find myself frequently annoyed, because I forget to set the \"from\" address, and thus email work from my personal account.  What I'd like to have happen, is if the email recipient is boss@serious.biz, then use my account with derek@serious.biz, otherwise use derek@clownpants.com, or something to that effect.\nA related question, but in my case I'd like it to be dependent on the recipient.\nMBP late 2011, OSX 10.7.4\n\nA: Unfortunately, there is no way to do this in Apple Mail. It only works for messages which you are replying to (they automatically use the same outgoing address which received the original message). There is no hook in AppleScript, nor an option in Automator by which to make this happen. If it were possible, as of right now, it would still require a third-party plugin, which I have not been able to find either. So unfortunately, the answer is now.\nNote: Also, if you select the inbox of the account from which you want to send the message, then compose, Mail will automatically use that account's email address for sending, unless you change it. Not quite as helpful as what you were hoping for, but at least something worth considering.\nGood luck and happy mailing!\n", "Q: iOS apps cannot be downloaded or updated I tried to update my apps today, and there appeared a notice said that \"iTunes terms & conditions have changed. Before you can proceed you must read & accept the new terms & conditions\". I selected OK and agreed the terms and conditions. Then there was another notice said 'download now: ***will now begin to download'. I pressed Ok. Then the first notice about the iTunes terms and conditions appeared again. All the process repeated then and it became an endless loop. I cannot download or update apps. \n\nA: This is a widespread issue affecting many iOS devices (with the exceptions of international stores). Apple has yet to respond/fix this bug.\nupdate It appears that Apple has resolved the issue. You can now download iTunes media normally.\n", "Q: Is it possible to dual boot Mac OS X Snow Leopard and Fedora 17? Has anyone attempted this before? Are there any installation guides to follow?\nI attempted to install before but I wasn't able to boot into the fedora partition when i was done.\n\nA: If you've successfully installed Fedora on a free partition, the rest is easy. Just download an ISO  copy of rEFIt and burn it with Disk Utility to a blank DVD.  Then, while booting, hold down C after the chime to boot to rEFIt.  It will give you the option to boot to Linux (this is indicated by a Tux icon).  \nAdditionally, rEFIt is able to install itself to your system without a DVD boot every time, but I couldn't recommend it as I had some issues with this personally.\n", "Q: Custom search engine in mobile Safari At the moment I am in mainland China, using an iPad set to British locale.  When I use the search field in mobile Safari, it always loads google.com.hk (not google.com or google.co.uk).\nUnfortunately this version of google is often extremely slow or doesn't load at all here, most likely because of the Great Fiewall of China (clicking a search result also asks google's server first, therefore it also takes a very long time).  In contrast, google.com works fast and reliably most of the time.\nIs there any way to force mobile Safari to use google.com instead of google.com.hk in iOS 6?  In iOS 5 at least it loaded google.co.uk, which also worked, but now it insists on google.com.hk, and the search settings only let me specify \"Google\" as search engine, but now a specific version of it.\n(Note: I am new to iOS and still getting familiar with it.)\n\nA: Perhaps not exactly what you were looking for, but if you load Google's main page and it redirects to your local version, you could force it to use .com just by tapping the button on the bottom of the page. \n", "Q: Get current client from Airfoil At work we use a Mac mini running Airfoil as an endpoint to stream music through the speakers.\nIdeally, I'd like to query that machine to ascertain the name or address of the current client streaming media to it.\nI'm happy to do this from another machine on the network, or from an agent on the Mac mini itself. Is this possible?\n\nA: I appreciate this is not ideal, but when a remote client connects to Airfoil Speakers on my machine, I see a line similar to the following generated in the Console, coming from /var/log/appfirewall.log\nFirewall[85]: Allow Airfoil Speakers connecting from 192.168.1.72:52013 to port 5000 proto=6\n\nSo potentially you could cat or tail the appfirewall.log looking for \"Airfoil Speakers\" using something like\ncat /var/log/appfirewall.log | grep -i \"airfoil speakers connecting\"\n\nand parse out the IP from the relevant lines.\nAlternatively, I notice that Airfoil supports AppleScript so maybe there's something you could do with that. Or you could drop Rogue Ameoba an email, I've always found their support to be excellent.\n", "Q: Xcode installed but not recognized on App Store i installed xcode directly from a dmg that i downloaded from developer site at apple, now on the app store shows up as it were not installed,(it shows install button)\nHow i can tell to the app store that is already installed?\n\nA: You can't make the App Store recognize an Xcode installed from a dmg. Besides that, the dmg distribution method is not used by Apple any longer so you most probably got an old Xcode version anyway.\nNew versions of Xcode are only distributed via the App Store. Just download/install the most current version of Xcode from the App Store again (it's free anyway)\n", "Q: Cannot access a specific remote IP address on Mac Os X 10.7.5 I cannot reach a certain remote IP address from my Mac. Pinging it gives \"Request timeout\" and after 4 or 5 pings \"No route to host\" and \"Host is down\". \nThe weird fact is that other Macs on my same local network can access it without problems.\nI don't have any firewall active, nor Little Snitch or similar, nor proxies, nor /etc/hosts tricks (which deal only with host name resolutions, anyway, but I have to reach the IPv4 address).\nI have a 2011 13\" MacBook Air with OS X 10.7.5.\nCan you point me to some other obscure network settings or blocking lists that may be active on Mac Os X or maybe some software that may interfere with network settings?\nThank you.\n\nA: The problem lies on the LogMeIn Hamachi network which, on IPv4, tries to get all the 5.0.0.0/8 netblock even if there are classes opf public IP addresses in there.\nSolved by setting LogMeIn to use IPv6 only.\nSee:\nhttp://community.logmein.com/t5/Hamachi/Hamachi-and-the-5-0-0-0-8-netblock/td-p/55826\nand \nhttp://community.logmein.com/t5/Hamachi/5-x-x-x-Address-Range/td-p/83996\n", "Q: \"Cycle Through Windows\" Menu Item is Missing I recently noticed that the normal cycle through windows command was not working in many of my applications — Terminal is about the only one left that would work. I went to go check, and the Cycle Through Windows item in the Window menu is gone in multiple applications. \nI attempted to assign a cycle command ( Command + `, as is normal ) via the Keyboard preference pane (in some vain hope that the missing menu item would have just been invisible), but that did not work either. \nI am completely at a loss here, especially as cycling through open windows is part of my normal workflow.\n\nA: Most applications have never had a menu item for it. I don't know why Finder and Terminal do though.\n⌘` should cycle through windows by default, but if it doesn't, check if the shortcut has been disabled or changed in System Preferences.\n\n", "Q: Will Mountain Lion install and run on a second drive (SSD) inside a MacBook Pro? I currently have a standard MacBook Pro from 2010. I bought an SSD drive and a caddy and I want to do a fresh install of Mountain Lion on the SSD, and stay with the other drive as secondary boot option.\nCan I just put the SSD on the place of the optical drive, or do I need to put the SSD in place of the current HDD, and put the current HDD in the cadddy (and connect the caddy instead of the optical drive? I would like to stick with the data from the old HDD around.)\nThe laptop is a 13\" model \"Core 2 Duo\" 2.4\n\nA: If you are using something like the Optibay drive from MCE Tech, you an put either drive in the caddy. I prefer to make a single change at a time, so when I did this I put the new drive in the caddy and left the old working boot drive alone.\nAs for installing from a USB thumb drive (I assume this is what you meant since you weren't clear), you shouldn't have to. You can download the Mountain Lion installer and run the app. During the install process you can choose what drive to install the OS on, simple choose the newly installed and formatted SSD.\nOnce you have both OS installed, the system will remember the last drive that was selected in the Startup Disk preferences and store that choice in NVRAM so that it will continue to start from the preferred drive. You can hold the option key at boot to prevent this choice and pick from all bootable drives when you want to switch things on a specific boot.\nMost people find that having two OS internally is confusing. Spotlight will try to find the correct version of Safari if you don't keep them both updated, but sometimes you end up running the wrong version of an app. This is confusing at best, and troublesome most of the time and can cause data issues when the wrong version of an app opens data it didn't expect from a newer version of iPhoto for instance.\n", "Q: How did my Mac end up with iPhone 4S as my host name in the user prompt in OS X terminal? The other day I was searching for Xcode iOS 5 tutorials. About a day or two later, I noticed my terminal prompt is now \"iPhone4s : myusername\". Naturally , my biggest fear is that there could be a worm or trojan horse on here. I look up the current procedure for checking the most current Mac Malware and the system turned up clean. I followed the examples to edit the PIF with the code:\nPS1=\"\\h : \\u\\$\" \n\nand it does not get rid of the \"iPhone4s\" prefix. I checked the System Preferences > Sharing and the name for the computer is correct.\nHow do I go about making sure the system is not hacked, and how to get rid of the iPhone4s name? I have 3 accounts created on this system. The other 2 are not affected.\n\nA: It turns out it was just as our Unix guy had said.  The iPhone4s Host name is only present when I am at work and my mac book is accessing the companies wireless network. When I am away, the terminal shows the proper hostname. We are a mac centric company but we use all windows servers. Apparently, that makes a situation ripe for these strange DHCP anomalies.\nThanks for the help. \n\nA: I'm not sure why superuser migrated this here as this is a problem with your Mac and the router and not a phone, but just go to your sharing preference pane and change the name of your Mac. Be sure to pay attention to the Edit... button since your Mac could have adopted the name from a router thinking the IP address was for your phone and not your Mac.\nYou can use the hostname command to check things before and after you change things in the GUI.\n\nA: I'm not sure how the name was changed and if it's at all possible to trace it back, but you can easily change the HostName to any name using the scutil command:\nsudo scutil --set HostName your_new_name\n\n\nHere's a shell script I use to change various computer names (ComputerName, HostName, LocalHostName) in one step:\n#!/bin/bash\n# Change your computer names\n# Run with sudo\n\n# variables\nid=$1\ncomputerName=$(scutil --get ComputerName)\nhostName=$(scutil --get HostName)\nlocalHostName=$(scutil --get LocalHostName)\n\nchangeName(){\n    scutil --set ComputerName $id\n    scutil --set HostName $id\n    scutil --set LocalHostName $id\n}\n\nprintChanges(){\n    clear\n    printf \"**************OLD SETTINGS*************\\n\"\n    printf \"ComputerName:   $computerName\\n\"\n    printf \"HostName:       $hostName\\n\"\n    printf \"LocalHostName:  $localHostName\\n\\n\"\n\n    newComputerName=$(scutil --get ComputerName)\n    newHostName=$(scutil --get HostName)\n    newLocalHostName=$(scutil --get LocalHostName)\n\n    printf \"***********CURRENT SETTINGS************\\n\"\n    printf \"ComputerName:   $newComputerName\\n\"\n    printf \"HostName:       $newHostName\\n\"\n    printf \"LocalHostName:  $newLocalHostName\\n\\n\"\n}\n\n# main\nif (($#==0))\n    then\n    # print current names\n    clear\n    printf \"***********CURRENT SETTINGS************\\n\"\n    printf \"ComputerName: $computerName\\n\"\n    printf \"HostName:     $hostName\\n\"\n    printf \"LocalHostName $localHostName\\n\\n\"\nelif (($#==1))\n    then\n    # change name and print changes\n    changeName $id      \n    printChanges\nelse\n    echo \"Expected: Empty OR NewComputerName\"\nfi\n\n\nA: TLDR: It's weird but benign so you can ignore it. \nThis is an old question, but it has a cool answer so I'm sharing it.\nIt was answered here by the user that wrote the original question, and it seems like this happens over public wifi networks when your mack picks up a hostname from the DHCP server. \nThe answer linked this article  which explains that it's caused by the domain server when it picks up on a previous user's hostname. \n\nA: This is likely because on a large network IP address your computer uses was previously associated with another device with a different name (the one appearing in your terminal).\nI tried setting my hostname like gentmatt suggested but rather than use his code, the following worked for me:\nsudo hostname <new-host-name>\n\nTo make it permanent, you can use the -s flag (supported since Mavericks):\nsudo hostname -s <new-host-name>\n\nSee this article on OSX Daily.\n", "Q: Do I need to buy Growl in order to use the iterm2 growl feature? Seems the notification is not working, or do I need to buy the Growl from App Store in order to use it?\n\nA: First, make sure you've read \"Growl Notification from iTerm 2\" on using Growl. If that doesn't work, here's a short history of Growl:\nThe older versions of Growl came as a framework and preference pane and were free. Applications with Growl support could not use it unless you installed Growl. Recently (version 2), Growl became a paid application through the app store. When this occurred however, it was no longer necessary to install it to use it. Applications linking against the new versions can display notifications without the application installed, but you won't have any customization abilities.\nTherefore, if you cannot get notifications, either iTerm2 is using a version of Growl before it was paid, or defaults to having no notifications enabled. It is much more likely that it is using an old version, which means you can install the old versions available on the Growl website (direct link for the most recent free version). If you install that and still can't get notifications, then yes, you will have to purchase the application.\n", "Q: Display visual notification of currently-playing song in iTunes? Is there a way to display the currently-playing track on my Mac? I would rather not use a 3rd-party app.\n\nA: You can click the Zoom button in iTunes to get a Mini Player version which you can position anywhere on your screen.\nIn iTunes Preferences - Advanced, you'll additionally find an option to keep the Mini Player on top of all other windows.\n\n\nA: This uses a 3rd-party tool, sorry, but it works very well.  It's called Now Playing and it displays the current track via the Notification Center (both a pop-up and a persistent message in the NC itself).  I use it on iTunes 10.7 and OSX 10.8.2 (ML).\nI found another App that does the same sort of thing but is Open Source and purports to use fewer resources.  It's called iTunification.  It also supports Growl, in addition to Notification Center.\n\nA: You might wait until the new redesign of iTunes gets released. It was said to come this month (October 2012) so you might only have to wait 30 days if it ships on time. The new mini player window seems to do exactly what you ask.\nIn the mean time, this Take Five app is superb and really is useful all the time. I got it on a whim and it's really something I have come to love for how easy a timer it is. I find myself using it all the time to remind myself to do something when the music starts again.\n\nA: If you want to display the notifications manually and not every time the track changes, you can assign a shortcut to a shell script like this:\nIFS=$'\\t' read -r artist track < <(osascript -e 'tell application \"iTunes\"\n    tell current track to artist & tab & name\nend tell') || exit\nterminal-notifier -title \"$artist\" -message \"$track\" -group itunestrack\n\nterminal-notifier can be installed with sudo gem install terminal-notifier.\n\nA: Go to Window and select Switch to MiniPalyer.

I really like when I go near to a wi-fi connection and my iPod-touch automatically connects, send the Outbox e-mails and download the new ones.\nIs there a way to do the same with twitter? Automatically download the new tweets and send the \"drafts\" when connect to the wi-fi?\n\nA: The iOS Mail app has special abilities not available to 3rd party apps, under the App Store rules. Specifically it has greater leeway on how it can act in the background. 3rd party apps can't update every x minutes, nor can they receive a trigger when connectivity is restored (I'm not actually sure that Mail.app gets this either, it may just be that it's push/scheduled check doesn't fail once connectivity is restored), although they can trigger downloads based on geofencing.\nThis sort of thing would be possible on a jailbroken device, but I don't know if any apps actually offer this functionality, perhaps someone can chime in.\n", "Q: Why does my wifi iPad think its location is in another state? I live in MA but my iPad thinks it is in Clarksville, Indiana (both in Maps and other apps). This becomes annoying if I try to post in Facebook and all friends ask what I am doing in IN. This has been happening in both iOS 5 and 6.\nI've read on the web where people claim this is because of the Apple location database thinks my wireless router is in IN but if I post a comment to Facebook on my wife's iMac (also on wifi) it correctly identifies my location. \nI've also used my iPhone to determine my location while connected to my wifi which is supposed to update the Apple location database but it's had no effect.\nAny ideas on how to fix?\n\nA: The iPad location service now reports the correct location just seems to have taken a really long time to update. \nSteps: \n\n\n*\n\n*Connect iPhone to the wifi network\n\n*Open Maps and click on location arrow\n\n*Wait for Apple location db to update\n\n", "Q: missing Login Items for managed account MacBook Air running 10..8.1.\nI have a script that I'd like to add to the Login Items for a managed account.  When logged in as the Administrator, the Login Items button is present.  When I select the managed account, the Login Items is missing.\nParental Controls are enabled for the managed account.\nHow can I access the Login Items for a managed account?\n\nA: A managed account (despite being named managed) can only have Login Items set when logged in. It cannot be managed from a separate Admin account. \nI had to promote the account to Admin, log in as that account and add the items to the Login Items, then demote the account back to manage.\n", "Q: Is iMessages secure? What security does iMessages provide or is it open and subject to the security of the connection used to send the messages?\n\nA: iMessages are transmitted with TLS (SSL) encryption, and the saved messages on your devices will be encrypted (like all other data), but the message contents themselves aren't encrypted. I'm not aware that Apple has publicly stated whether they store any iMessages on their servers, and how they might be encrypted.\n\nA: It is encrypted end to end better than SMS. I wouldn't call it secure, though since the code isn't peer-reviewed (AFAIK) nor does it pass the \"dropped in a puddle\" test to ensure you and only you have keys to decrypt the contents. (In other words, if you are not holding they keys, it's not very secure.)\n", "Q: How can I do the equivalent of a Unix find / -print [under user permissions] under Mountain Lion? I am doing, or trying to do, a 'find /' which I would like to recursively list every file the user has permission to access under the volume \"Macintosh HD\" and nothing else.\nI am presently filtering out the output of the find to exclude files under Backups.backupdb. This is a partial solution at best because the system is bogging under attempts to access flaky NSF mounts.\nIs there a shell command that I can use that will stay on \"Macintosh HD\", recursively list file paths, and leave other volumes alone?\n\nA: find can do this itself as per Apple's man page. You ned the -x option to \n\nPrevent find from descending into directories that have a device number different than that of\n               the file from which the descent began.\n\n\nA: If I understand your question, I think you want find \"/Volumes/Macintosh HD/\". Because OS X mounts volumes in /Volumes, every volume is a subdirectory of /, hence why you're getting results from volumes you don't want.\n", "Q: Is there an OSX workaround to configure a \"unifying\" receiver without Logitech's control center? I have two Logitech wireless devices (keyboard and mouse) that work well on my ppc mac (running OSX 10.4.11). Each has a little USB unifying receiver that came with it, each receiver being paired with the device it came with. You're supposed to be able to pair both devices to a single receiver, but Logitech wants you to download the Logitech Control Center in order to do so. I just finished \"cleaning house\" on my system, removing unwanted and residual third-party stuff, and I'd rather not install some \"bloatware\" if there's a way I can manually pair both devices to one receiver. Add to that the fact that Logitech no longer offers a version of LLC that runs on 10.4.I've seen some people mentioning SteerMouse and USB Overdrive, and might check them out, but is there any other option? I don't care about customizing the buttons, just pairing both devices to one receiver.I hope this isn't considered off-topic. I realize the question centers around Logitech, but I'm hoping there's a way to access configuration setting with OSX.\nThanks!\n\nA: Apparently the only \"workaround\" is to install Logitech Control Center, use it to pair the devices with the receiver, then uninstall the LCC software.I tried both USB Overdrive and MouseSteer first, but neither seems to include the necessary pairing functionality. I uninstalled each, then found an older version of LCC (version 3.3.0) that was compatible with my operating system and processor, used it, took careful note of what and where it was installing on my system, used the included uninstaller, and voila!Actually, there was some residual stuff that I dug up and deleted manually. I should mention that the LCC installer had a pretty good and thorough ReadMe that actually listed what files would be installed in what locations. It did omit a couple files that I found with a sudo find, but the whole thing was pretty painless.And now I have a keyboard I like and a scroll-wheel on my mouse! I've been living in the dark ages with the one-button magic mouse for a long time :)\n\nA: Mac does have the Logitech Unifying Software, which opens up the pairing options; add and remove items from a receiver, as well as update firmware (which seems to be perpetually greyed out no matter what I do on my Mac's and PC's, but that's a problem for another day.)\nVersion 1.1.301 works with OSX 10.4 - 10.6 and is found here.\nOtherwise you can get all versions from the Logitech Support page.\nNot sure if this existed when the post was made, but as an update to the question, it's now a solution.\n", "Q: How to restrict changing desktop wallpaper? We have Macbook Airs running 10.8.1. These are exposed to students in a k-12 setting. I'd like to restrict their ability to change the wallpaper of the desktop.

Can I make it \"always encrypted\"?\nNon-encrypted transfers are a problem for me.\n\nA: Time Machine on 10.7/10.8 uses the same encryption as any other non-system disk. When you first enable it, OS X has to encrypt the entire disk, which takes a while. The status \"Encrypting\" just means that it's still working on that.\nYou can check on the status with diskutil cs list in Terminal. Mixed in with other info, you'll see something like:\nSize (Total):       124190560256 B (124.2 GB)\nSize (Converted):   2539913216 B (2.5 GB)\n\nThat's 2.5 out of 124.2GB complete. Once the disk is fully encrypted, it's done for good and you'll basically never see that status again.\n", "Q: Secure copy a movie from Mac to iPad I have a Mac and a jailbroken iPad. Jailbreaking is perfectly legal where I write this. I can scp and rsync to the device (i.e. I can file-transfer), how would I best transfer some movies to watch on the iPad?\n\n\n*\n\n*Which folder on the iPad?\n\n*Which app on the iPad? (preferably: free)\n\n\nAny combination that works without using iTunes would do.\n\nA: If you want to watch with the built in iTunes Player, I would suggest Music2iPod, a free app that can access any file (including videos) on a jailbroken iDevice and add it to the iTunes library. To add the video file to your device I would suggest connecting with a GUI SCP program (like Cyberduck) and transferring to the default directory (it really doesn't matter where, as long as you have read/write access and can remember it), then navigating to this with Music2iPod, which will then add the video to your iPod library for you.\n", "Q: How to disable Airplay on IPad? Is it possible to disable Airplay on an iPad?  I recently bought a Denon receiver that supports Airplay.  The other day my 2 year old niece decided to stream what she was watching on the iPad to my stereo at an extremely high volume level.  As you could imagine, trying to tell a 2 year old not to do something can be impossible at times, so I'd like to disable the Airplay feature from the iPad so my niece, and others, can't use it.\n\nA: No it is not possible to disable AirPlay.\nHowever you could add a volume limit with Restrictions. Also with iOS 6 you can have more control over how kids control the iPad with Guided Access. You can limit the iPad to just the current app and lock off parts of the screen. \n\nA: Or.., buy a router with a seperate guest network and have the kids toy access the Internet via this. Only solution for the ipod .\n\nA: There aren't any AirPlay-specific restrictions available on the iOS side yet. Another approach would be to either disable or password-protect AirPlay on your home theather's end, not on the iPad. \nApple TV provides both of these options, for example. Unfortunately, based on my research, it doesn't appear to be possible to disable or password protect AirPlay on Denon receivers  at this time.\n", "Q: Second iOS devices getting my iMessages and FaceTime calls My brother updated his iPod today but because he connected with my Apple ID, he is receiving all my iMessages and FaceTime calls on his iPod.\nHow do I stop this from happening?\n\nA: You can simple  switch of these sync settings by disabling the services in the Settings < FaceTime/Messages.\n \nOf course, if you've got like a troll brother, he will simply turn back on these services. If that's the case, you can protect these settings with Restrictions. At least, you can for FaceTime. With a simple password, you can prevent him from using FaceTime.\nIf you let him use your Apple ID, he should be able to live with the fact his iPod is password protected. \nOr you can make him his own Apple ID of course. It's free of charge and done within a few clicks.  \nIf he uses your Apple ID in order to use iTunes Match or get the apps you've bought, that's possible as well. Please see this extensive topic about sharing an Apple ID.\n", "Q: Is it normal to have a Macbook heat up when using a dual boot linux? After successfully dual-booting fedora on my Macbook Air, i have noticed that the Macbook tends to heat up a lot faster than when I am using Mac OS X.\nIs this normal?\n\nA: No, I don't think it's \"normal\". But as always, it depends. For me, this usually happens when I look at full screen flash video or am doing other computing intensive stuff. When I dualboot into my dev environment, I'm just surfing the web for informations which wouldn't lead to the heat up.\nTL;DR: It's very likely that it's your behaviour that changes with the platform you boot into and that it's this causing the heatup.\n", "Q: Speed Up iTunes Sync on 192 kbps I have something like 1450 songs on my iPhone 4S, and I have iTunes transcoding the files to 192 kbps as I don't have enough memory. The only problem is that the sync takes from 3 to 4 hours!\nIs there any way I could speed it up? \nMy iPhone runs iOS 6.0 and my computer, Windows 8 Dev Preview.\n\nA: If this is the first sync, it has to transcode everything, which naturally takes a long time. If you check your Activity Monitor you'll probably see all cores at 100%. You could buy a computer with a faster CPU... or just be patient.\nThe first sync used to take about a day for me with 5000 songs on an old Core 2 Duo MacBook. At least you can stop the sync and it'll resume where it left off when you get back.\n", "Q: Can Apple mail only sync the last month of a Exchange email? I just synced my Mountain Lion Mail app with my Exchange work email account in order to have it locally on my machine (rather than continuously going through the web interface). However, now Mail fetches all the mails since the very beginning (which are a couple of years).\nIs there a way (like on iOS devices) to tell Mail to only sync the last month or something configurable amount based on message count, download size or other similar restriction to prevent all messages from being stored locally?\n\nA: \nThe feature to prevent your Apple Mail from downloading all of your emails has been removed from the application.\n\n2290.

The only reason I use the Notes.app and not Stickies.app is iCloud sync.\nI enjoy the customization (colors, fonts, minimized view) and minimalism (plain background, thin borders) of Stickies over the skeuomorphismic approach which generally requires much more space on the desktop.\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I safely remove the background lines and change the line spacing in Notes.app?\n\n\nA: I tried searching for keys for hidden preferences with strings /Applications/Notes.app/Contents/MacOS/Notes | grep, but didn't find anything.\nThere's no graphics for the grid lines, because they're just solid lines and their height depends on the font size. You can almost get rid of the grid lines by replacing paper.png with a solid color, but there's a light gradient drawn over it.\n\nI also tried adding shortcuts for orderFrontSpacingPanel: and setLineHeightMultiplier: in DefaultKeyBinding.dict, but they didn't have any effect.\n", "Q: Launch app periodically with Automator How can I launch an app in Automator periodically, like in 15 minute intervals?\n\nA: You can also use AppleScript instead (/Applications/Utilities/AppleScript\\ Editor.app/).\nThe following script starts the Terminal.app every seven seconds:\non idle\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        tell application \"Terminal\"\n            run\n        end tell\n        return 7\n    end tell\nend idle\n\nSave this script as an application and let it \"stay open after run handler\".\n\nA: Using launchd, you could save the property list below as ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.stackexchange.apple.65970.plist, and then load it with launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.stackexchange.apple.65970.plist or by logging out and back in.\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC -//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd>\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.stackexchange.apple.65970</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>open</string>\n        <string>-jga</string>\n        <string>Mail</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/> <!-- run before the first 15 minutes have passed -->\n    <key>StartInterval</key>\n    <integer>900</integer>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nopen -g opens an application on the background, but it will still open a visible window if the application wasn't running before. -j also hides the application if it wasn't running.

And ever since upgrading my escape key randomly stops working. And it's not that the keyboard on the laptop would be damaged as the same happens if I use Apple's Bluetooth keyboard. So I'm guessing it's a software issue.\nAlso in some cases pressing ctrl+esc achieves the same thing as just esc so I'm 100% it's not  a hardware problem.\n\n*\n\n*the escape key stops working completely but it starts working again after I restart the computer.\n\n*this usually happens after the computer wakes from sleep. So it's not like that is just stopps working in the middle of using it, but  rather after I put it to sleep (or just close the lid) and then open  it again.\n\nDoes anybody have any idea what this might be all about and how to fix it?\n\nA: For anyone who ends up here after upgrading macOS. I had to disable Siri and then kill the Siri process using Activity Monitor.\n\nA: Killing Siri has made this work on Monterey(12.1) as well.\n\nA: I unchecked \"Enable Ask Siri\" in System preferences -> Siri.\nNow it looks like this:\n\nNow my ESC is working again!\n\nA: I've been having the same exact issue for a couple of weeks, and it did turn out it was indeed the Visor feature from TotalFinder as mentioned before by Joe. Disabling it did solve the thing.\nAnyway, as it has been said, given the fact that the behaviour is the same with the built-in keyboard or the bluetooth one, it's obvious it's not a hardware issue.\n\nA: If this problem happens in every application then it is indeed a system wide problem. If it only happens in one application it's an application problem.\nThis problem might also come from another (modifier) key getting stuck.\nTo check if the Esc key is ignored by the system itself or if another key is stuck use the Keyboard Viewer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Apple → System Preferences... \n\n\n*→ Keyboard\n\n\n*Enable Show Keyboard & Character Viewers in menu bar\n\nThen when the problem happens again display the keyboard viewer and check if any keys are stuck. If not try using the esc key there and see if it displays as being pressed. If not then you probably have a driver problem.\n\nYou could then try installing your system on another drive and try to reproduce the issue on a clean install.\n\nA: I wouldn't do a drive wipe and clean install just yet. I would first boot into safe mode. Do this by holding down the Shift key as soon as you hear the Apple \"chime\". See if you have the problem then. If the escape key works reliably, it is likely a driver or software issue that is interfering. You can remove apps or third-party drivers to try to figure out which one(s) are the cause.\nIf it still happens in safe mode, it might be time to do a drive wipe and reinstall OS X from scratch.\n\nA: As others have said, there's probably some application conflict that's causing the issue (since you said it's happening with the built-in keyboard and BT keyboard).  I was having this problem, too, with the same symptoms (happening after waking up from sleep, reboot solves the issue).\nIn my case I believe it's related to my use of TotalFinder, specifically the Visor feature of it.  Bringing up the Visor and then hitting escape seems to recover from the failure until my Mac sleeps again. If you disable the Visor or uninstall TotalFinder, the escape key wont become lost in the first place.\n\nA: The escape key on my Macbook Air was not working at all. I realized that the problem was that the Speakable Items Utility had assigned the Escape Key as the \"Listening Key.\" Turning off Speakable Items (under Accessibility panel in System Preferences) seems to have fixed the problem.\n\nA: Note that in order to solve this, you might not have to disable the Visor feature completely. I only disabled the option to 'Hide on ESC' and now I can switch windows between my terminal apps without sacrificing the option key \n\nA: Wipe the hard drive and do a clean install of OSX. \nI hate suggesting this, but it should fix your problem. I too had a weird glitch from upgrading my mac OS. (mine was that i couldn't empty the recycle bin normally- i had to use console commands) The apple genius bar was lost, google turned up nothing, and no \"expert\" had any idea. \nI know a clean install isn't an answer to the problem, but it's a means to a resolution of it... \nFeel your frustration, let me know if you try this and if it works :)\n(apple will do a clean install free of charge, if you're uncomfortable doing it)\n\nA: DON\"T REINSTALL YET:\nI had this problem.  The keyboard viewer did not register \"esc\" presses.  Turned out it was from turning on speech commands while playing chess.  To fix it, I went to System Preferences --> Accessibility --> Speakable Items --> Listening Key.  Then I changed the listening key to something other than esc, and the problem went away immediately.\n\nA: For me, I'd to do the both.\n\n\n*\n\n*Disabled the TotalFinder hide on esc key\n\n*And also changed the Esc key to something (i set it to backtik `)\n\n\nNow it works.\n\nA: I had enabled speech command in system preferences and soon after that the esc key stopped working.

Now I cannot find Xcode from Apple Store in iPad. I want to get this one here for iPad so how can I get Xcode for iPad?\n\nA: Xcode is an IDE available exclusively for the Mac OS operating system. There is no mobile version of the software. The link you provided is to the Mac App Store, which is its own separate entity from the App Store for iOS devices.\n\nA: You currently cannot install Xcode on an iPad or iPhone, or any device other than a mac running OSX. There have been discussions & questions asked about it before; basically you shouldn't hold your breath.\nIf you have a mac you can always consider VNC if you want to do work remotely on your iPad, but to me it sounds like you don't have a mac and were hoping the iPad could serve as your development environment.\n\nA: Xcode is a Mac App, not an iOS App. As such, it doesn't run on the iPad. The program you linked to, http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12, is in the Mac app store, not the iOS App store.\nThere might be some confusion because Xcode can be used to develop iOS apps, but it itself is a Mac app only.\n\nA: As with the other answers, you can't directly because OS X and iOS are different platforms with different restrictions and apps (duh).  You can however accomplish what you're attempting to do with an OS X machine running and connected to the Internet in order to compile the builds for your iPad.\nThis is exactly how the Dringend app works (http://dringend.cc/).  It runs on your iPad as a slimmed-down 3rd-party Xcode replacement (it even understands .xcodeproj files!), and uses Xcode via remote OS X host to do the dirty-work.\nI thought I read something somewhere about another start-up working towards a product with the same premise, but provides the OS X build-machines as a paid service— I'll update this if I find their name.  Until then, there's always OS X hosting.\n\nA: The iPad's processor's power is way too small to run Xcode. You can let Apple think about it or just get a Mac.\n", "Q: Has anyone solved issues with iPhone 5 and iPad that won't connect to Netgear WiFi routers? I have two Apple devices which flat out refuse to connect to our company WiFi, an iPhone 5 and a 'new iPad' (3rd gen). Both are running iOS 6. The iPad could connect while it was on iOS 5, but not since upgrading to iOS 6. When selecting the network, I'm prompted for the password, but once I've entered it (correctly) I get the message 'Unable to join the network \"network name\"'.\nThe company WiFi is run on Netgear WAG102 routers, using WPA2. My previous iPhone 4 had no trouble connecting even while running iOS 6. My room mate's iPhone 4S is connecting fine, though it's on iOS 5 still.\nAny ideas what might be causing this? What can I do to troubleshoot and solve the problem? \n\nA: I was also having iPhone 5 connection issues while running 2.0.16NA, but I was concerned about rolling all the way back to 2.0.7NA. I was able to connect by using 2.0.12NA. No other issues... so far.\n\nA: I had this issue at work when replacing an older AP with a Netgear WAG102.\nAll devices like laptops etc connected fine. All mobile devices connected fine apart from certain apple iPhones. Possibly ones on IOS 6...\nI solved this by doing the following:\nDowngraded the firware on the Netgear WAG102. It was on the latest 2.16 I think. I reverted it back to 2.07.\nI then changed the SSID to something totally random. Rebooted and all devices including IOS 6 connected. No issues.\nI changed the SSID back to my company name as before and IOS 6 devices bottled out!\nSounds weird but I got mine working. \n\nA: We also have the Netgear WAG 102 wireless access points and I discovered something very interesting today.  I have one WAG 102 that hasn't been updated to the latest firmware 2.0.7NA and my iPhone 5 can connect to it perfectly.  The other access points that have been updated to 2.0.16NA and will not allow me to connect.  \n\nA: WG102 Netgear access points will not work with IO6 on the iphone or ipad if you are using the latest firmware. Downgrade your firmware on the WG102 to an older one and it will work :)\n\nA: Well, iOS 6.1 seems to finally have solved the problem for me; after updating my iPhone 5 happily connects to the company Wi-Fi again. I haven't yet tried connecting with the iPad, but I hope that works as well.\n\nA: A fix I found for this is to choose 'Other...' when trying to connect to Wi-Fi and enter details manually.  You'll know if it's worked when you click on the blue arrow at the side of the network name when connected and can see 'Forget this Network'. \n\nA: When entering the \"password\" use the wep key (That long string of numbers and letters) \nNotice - this is a hex code - so the letters are from A to F and nothing beyond F - so any 0's you see are zero not the letter O.\nAlso - as I said - this is a hex key, I've noticed some mac devices (i phone 5 most recently) require a 0x in front of the key to let the device know the string is hex. \nNOTE   the 0x (lower case x) must immediately preceded the string (no spaces)- which is all upper case letters. \nGood luck. \nPS - We were using standard 128 WEP. \n\nA: I fixed my problem by selecting \"other\" and typing in the SSID name. It works now.  If a selected the same name form the list it would not work.\n\nA: I also had a problem connecting to my Netgear AP, After I performed firmware downgrade to 2.0.7NA work perfectly now\n", "Q: How can I keep my fan from staying at full speed after replacing the hard drive? I replaced a hard drive in a 2011 iMac (Core i7), though it was a standard hard drive and didn't have a location for the S.M.A.R.T. cord. (Or at least I think that's what it was.) Since then, the internal fan has constantly been running. I don't want the fan to burn out, and it is becoming quite a distraction for the user.\nI believe there is a terminal command that turns off the fan, I believe by bypassing the S.M.A.R.T. test, but the Google gods are not forthcoming with this information. Does anybody know how I can turn off the fan?\n\nA: You should definitely try resetting the SMC, since it's a known fix for fan issues.\nHere are the instructions: Resetting the System Management Controller.\n\nA: I Just downloaded the Macs Fan Control to fix a 2010 27\" iMac.  I have taken my silver beast apart about 5 times, reseating the LCD temp sensor connector, reseating all connectors, SMC resets, NPRAM erases, flex capacitor reboots, and praying to Steve Jobs collective soul to get these damn fans to slow down slow enough so I can actually hear these friggin speakers.\nMacs Fan Control allowed the constant rate set for my 2 trouble fans, the CPU fan and the ODD fan. I now have to monitor my temps to adjust my fan speeds, but I don't crush big math all that often.  The free program beats shelling out $800 for a new logic board for a bad temp sensor.\n\nA: I have tried many different apps to resolve my noisy fan issue after replacing HDD with SSD.  I was able to use iStat to determine it was the CPU fan and not the SSD/HD fan.  HDD Fan Control did not work nor did SSD Fan Control.  I know everything was connected and in place so I know it was not a cable/sensor issue.  I have been working on this for hours and finally found this website and downloaded Macs Fan Control, set them to Ambient and instantly, my CPU fan went silent.  I have my sanity back.  Huge thanks.\n\nA: I had a similar problem, but i did not solve it by shutting down the Fan. Even if that would be possible, i would not reccomend it. Instead you have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install \"HDD-Fan Control\", which i did, a very nice Control for your iMac which costs 30,-$\n\n*You could try and replace the Connector from the HD to the Mainboard. Apple uses  special 6-Pin Molex-like Connector, but uses only 2 Pins which connect to the MB\n\n\nI went with solution #1 because it was the easiest solution - the Cable is very hard to find.\n\nA: Macs Fan Control can set the fan of an iMac (or MacBook, or other hardware) to any speed. The coolest thing that it can also set a fan to sensor-based control depending on your new HDD by reading its S.M.A.R.T. temperature. \nThis free app is much better and powerful than HDD Fan Control, which is currently deprecated but still costs $35. Macs Fan Control also works under Windows in Boot Camp.\n\nA: Install and use SSD Fan Control that also supports S.M.A.R.T. and it doesn't cost any money.\n\nA: Short out the connector that goes to the hard drive and this will tell the fans to return to normal. It's the absence of a connection that makes the fans spin up.\n", "Q: Old iPad 2 with cracked screen - what trade-up/repair is available and is it worth using? I have an unused, approximately 1.5-year-old, iPad 2 (32Gig with 3G). It has a slight crack in one corner of the screen - it's noticeable but not a complete hindrance to anyone using it.\nI've just obtained an iPad 3 and am trying to figure out what I can do with the old iPad 2. I was thinking of selling it (Ebay, Craigslist etc.) - but I was wondering what services Apple might provide to repair the screen beforehand, or provide a trade-up to a newer one at a low cost? What are folks' experiences? Is it worth attempting to do this before I sell it?\nIn case it's relevant, I'm in the UK.\n\nA: Apple has only had a recycling service for iPods in the past and pushes all gift cards through their official Recycling Program.\nMy experience is that these sort of plans don't get you top dollar, but don't require you to take any risk or spend any time to sell your old product. You should be able to determine the repair pricing for most Apple products by contacting Apple Care or visiting a retail store to get a quote. \nIn this case, iPad glass isn't repaired other than at the manufacturing site - so all broken iPads go back for repair / recycle / refurbishment and you get fully tested / warranted (and potentially fully new) one in exchange.\nOnce you know this you can compare the repair cost with buy new cost with what you can sell it locally. Either way, this research will help you make a good sale in case the buyer has reservations - they too can always go to Apple and get a new battery, fixed screen, etc... for the repair price should they find your device not acceptable once they use it a while.\n\nA: For what it's worth, in the end I sold the iPad on Ebay. I got almost £250 for it, even with the cracked screen.\n\nA: If you decide to sell it off, I've heard good things about Gazelle.com. Not sure if they will accept items from the UK though.\n\nA: Here's how the process of replacing the screen would go if you did it yourself, or paid someone to do it. Buy the glass (between $45-$60 USD) then use a heat gun to loosen the current glass being super careful not to overheat and destroy anything inside. There's about an 80% chance you'll damage the wifi antenna so go ahead and order that too ($5). It's because the antenna is glued to the glass and body, it takes a really steady and experienced hand to do this without damaging the antenna... Next you remove the battery and motherboard and unplug the digitizer(glass) and plug in the new one and reassemble... It will take you a few hours to do if you haven't done it before.. \nWhere i'm at, there are shops advertising repair services, but they'll charge you $200 USD(minimum) to repair it. \nIf you want to do this yourself order the parts on amazon.com or ebay, use ifixit.com for the guide, but as someone who has done this many times.. i don't recommend it for a small crack like you described.. I'd sell it to a family member or friend who won't mind a slight discount due to the defect. \nGiven the difficulty of repair, you'll be ripped off by any company attempting to buy it from you, stick with ebay or craigslist. \n\nA: I have fixed two iPad screens after having fixed several iPhone 4/4Ss. It is definitely doable -- YouTube is your friend as well as iFixit.com. But it took some serious time. The first time took me several hours over the course of a couple days. Glass was everywhere (this thing was seriously shattered and removing it will crack the screen even more). I would in fact suggest using tape to tape over the old screen (you're throwing it away anyway) to make sure to \"hold in\" all the little glass shards during removal.\nIt is a much cleaner repair for iPhone 4/4S than it is for iPad 2. As stated above the iPad 2 can have a messy removal of the front glass and it is very difficult to not destroy the wi-fi connector in the process. I would say it's a bit more pricey than $60 to get the screen however. I found pricing around $80 for the parts. I've used both Amazon and eBay to get what I need.\nIf it's just a small corner that's cracked you might instead just get a screen protector from iVisor or Zagg for around $30 and as long as you apply it properly you'll be in great shape. \nThen sell it on eBay. Good luck!\n\nA: You might want to stop by farewellcell.com, an online portal buying used cell phones, tablets and electronics. They offer some of the highest prices around.\n", "Q: Applescript - Connection is invalid I have an application for mac and I use the following applescript code (exported as an AS app) to start that app periodically:\non idle\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        tell application \"MyApp\"\n            run\n        end tell\n        return 7\n    end tell\nend idle\n\nI use [NSApp terminate:self] in MyApp to terminate itself after it finished its work.\nThe problems is that the AS script displays a \"Connection is invalid\" error message when it tries to run MyApp the second time and onward. The error does not show up in the first launch.\nI'm guessing [NSApp terminate:self] is causing the conflict with the AS somehow, but why?\n\nA: In the end I used NSTimer to automate my code.\nRather then using the applescript to launch the app periodically, I have the app run constantly and use NSTimer within my app to fire a specific method from time to time.\n[NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:2.0\n    target:self\n    selector:@selector(targetMethod:)\n    userInfo:nil\n    repeats:NO];\n\nThis way the app is never killed and does not have to be restarted.\n", "Q: How to make Apple Maps work for transit directions and finding businesses: The initial release of Apple Maps is... challenged with regard to business listings, and lacks transit directions.\nBut most of the other apps Tim Cook suggested in his apology fail to solve the problem:  the straight-up GPS nav apps lack transit directions and have mediocre POI data, and the webapps are slow and lack many of the features of the native ones.\nWhat's the best workaround until Google releases an iPhone native app (likely months) or Apple's databases catch up (likely years)?\n\nA: I've gotten myself to a pretty good solution, so I thought I'd share.  Mine is NYC-based, but the POI solution will work almost anywhere, and the transit one should work in most major cities in the US (which are the only places transit's likely to be a must-have.)\nHere's the really short version:\nDownload Where To? for  business listings ($2.99) and Embark Transit for subway directions (free, if they cover your city).\nBoth plug directly into Apple Maps app, and plug its two major gaps.\nHow to find businesses and points of interest:\nDowload Where To? on your iPhone.\nYes, it costs $2.99, and there should be good, free solution, but there isn't, and it works.   Where to? will let you just click from categories to find common business types near you without typing:\n\nAnd, if you're looking for something specific, you can search, and its database is not just limited to chains and common stores (I tested it by searching for B&H, a well known, but single-instance NYC electronics specialty store.)\nYou can see the results in a list, or on a map.  Importantly, once you find somewhere you want to go, you can click on a little \"right curve ahead\" icon (it's also the app's icon) to get directions there, using either apple maps (which can then provide turn-by-turn directions since Where To filled the gap of finding the business), or using other apps you may have installed (MotionX, TeleNav, etc.)\nThere's also a 0.99 in-app purchase that lets you put locations on a camera picture, augmented reality style.   This probably more cute than useful.  It might be functional in dense cities if the compass worked better in them, but you can try it free to see if you like it first, so there's not much harm.\nHow to get transit directions:\nDowload Embark Transit on your iPhone.\nEmbark is free, pretty solid, and has apps that cover:\n\n*\n\n*Boston\n\n*Chicago\n\n*Philadelphia\n\n*London\n\n*NYC\n\n*Washington, DC\n\n*San Francisco\n\n*Caltrain\n\n*NJ Transit\n\n*Metra\n\n*LIRR\n\nIt's got the full map of the system, but can also route the best path between two addresses and give you step by step directions of what station to walk to, where to transfer, etc.\n\nAnd it works underground, as the data is stored locally. It doesn't cover every city, and it's not good at finding much without an address (like business names), but because it plugs into maps, and we now have a good way to get POIs there using embark, that's not a big deal.\nHere's how to use Embark (or any 3rd-party transit app) from maps:\n\n*\n\n*Install the app on your phone.\n\n*In Apple maps, click the \"right turn\" icon that goes to the directions screen - it's in the upper left corner of the app.\n\n*On the top of the directions screen, click the \"bus icon\"\n\n*Enter your Start and End (if they didn't pre-fill), and click \"route\"\n\n*You'll get the choice to use any installed transit app - in this case, it'll show you Embark, and if you click it, it'll open with that route pre-filled.\n\nYes, it's all a little more kludgey than it has to be.  But it works.\n", "Q: Wireless stops working near other machine I have a mid 2009(?) Macbook Pro running Mountain Lion. I'm not sure how relevant this is as I had this same issue on Snow Leopard. My issue is strange and I haven't been able to figure out what exactly is going on or where to ask. \nI have a desktop at home running Windows 7 and no wireless capabilities. It does have bluetooth for whatever reason but I disabled it. What's weird is if I bring my laptop within ~3-4 feet of the desktop my wireless stops. But it doesn't stop as in, it goes away, I'm still technically connected to it I just don't get any information and I can't send any information, well sort of, I can still see other wireless access points. As soon as it's moved out of the area it turns right back on like nothing ever happened. \nI haven't tested this with other computers as I don't know anyone who has a desktop that lives near me and I also never think to check with other people's laptops. Due to the nature of this problem it's hard to search for further information. My iPhone also seems to work fine around my computer but I'll test it at some point. \nAny ideas what might be causing this? \n\nA: Sounds like interference - there are some answers here on using tools to measure it if you care, but with this level of detail, you should be able to turn everything off and one by one turn things on to find the culprit.\n\n\n*\n\n*Using Wi-Fi Diagnostics\n\n*Troubleshooting Wireless\n\n*Potential Sources of Interference\n", "Q: Podcasts app \"disappearing\" from background? I'm trying to give the new podcasts app by Apple a go.\nEvery morning I listen to a podcast and then pause it when I get to work. When I want to keep listening a few hours later and just press on play again in my earphones, I see that the podcasts app is no longer the active playing app and I have to open it again. This used to work easily in the regular Music app, but with Podcasts it's like the fact that it's the last-played app gets lost after sometime.\nAny help?\n\nA: This is just how it is. After an undefined period the podcasts app is being closed by iOS to save battery and memory. If you want you can delete the Apple podcasts app and sync podcasts from iTunes. You will find the podcasts section re-appears in the music app.\n", "Q: How can I share reminders from one iphone to another? \nPossible Duplicate:\nIs it possible to share reminders? \n\nWe have 2 iphones between us, both running iOS 5.  Is there a way to share reminders between them?  They have different apple IDs associated with them.  It looks like this was possible via iCloud, but I cannot find that functionality.\n\nA: Pick one of your apple ID's and log in on both phones with this ID.

Shortly after plugging in the iPhone to a new Windows laptop (usually under 10 minutes), the entire USB hub will reset, disabling all connected devices.\n(A USB thumb drive once was the sole survivor, and continued operation even though an external hard drive and USB mouse shut off.)\nThe laptop is on AC power and has two discrete hubs, one USB 3.0, the other USB 2.0. The same thing happens to either hub, and in both cases, the other is unaffected.\nAs the 3GS never caused this issue, I am assuming the iPhone 5 draws more heavily on the USB power.\nIs there anything I can do to eliminate this issue, other than get an externally-powered hub? (Which I plan to do!)\nUpdate: If I plug the iPhone in fully charged, there seems to be no issue. This seems to indicate that it is indeed related to power draw.\nScreenshot of the USB hub properties when the phone is fully charged:\n\n\nA: Wow, 7 USB ports is a lot for a laptop!\nBecause (as you mentioned) the iPhone and iPad consume above-standard amperages, they can sometimes cause issues such as this.  Most USB controllers are dynamic enough to simply provide a standard amount of power to just the iPhone, but there have been a couple of cases I've seen where the hub crashes as you're describing.  When the hub provides a USB-standard amperage to the device, the device will indicate that it is not charging (though explicitly indicating that it is plugged in).\nI'm interested to know what model laptop you're using as it may be a known issue for the corresponding USB controller.\nAs for a fix, you can see if there is updated firmware for the controller.  If those are unavailable or don't resolve the issue, I suggest getting a powered external USB hub.  Using one will eliminate the power strain on the motherboard and will probably extend the life of the PSU.\n", "Q: How to have ctrl-left/ctrl-right move over words in Lion Had a quick question about having emacs-like word skipping in my terminal. I had set this up pre-upgrade to Lion and had ctrl-left & ctrl-right set to \\033b & \\033f respectively.  Unfortunately post-upgrade ctrl-left & ctrl-right don't seem to be working any more.\nI have seen this solution which makes alt-left & alt-right behave as above, but I was hoping to get ctrl-left & ctrl-right working as before and I was wondering if folks here had any solutions.\nPS: As an aside this behavior is not working correctly in my VNC client as well - which it did previously.\n\nA: Turns out that Mission Control(in Lion) has the same key combination to Move left a space and Move right a space - which I particularly don't have use for. Disabling this in Settings -> Keyboard Shortcuts did the trick for me.\n\nA: ⌃← and ⌃→ have moved a word left and right by default in Terminal since 10.7. \nYou can also change them in other applications by creating ~/Library/KeyBindings/ and saving this as DefaultKeyBinding.dict:\n{\n    \"^\\UF702\" = moveWordLeft:;\n    \"^\\UF703\" = moveWordRight:;\n}\n\n", "Q: Which iPhone 5 model sold in the US should I buy for use in Spain? I am buying an iPhone 5 in the US to use in Spain. Should I go for the AT&T's A1428 GSM model or the Verizon's A1429 CDMA one? \nSpain does not currently have LTE band, so the only concern is whether the CDMA works in Spain's GSM and 3G networks.\nThanks! \n\nA: Verizon ships its iPhone 5 unlocked, and it operates on the LTE bands that are typically used in Europe. The \"GSM\" model sold in North America is restricted to LTE bands that are currently only used in Canada and the US. Both models can operate fine on 3G GSM networks.\nAs far as I can tell, while there was an LTE spectrum auction in Spain last year, the precise bands to be used haven't been published yet, but the Verizon (CDMA) seems to be more useful currently, and may be more likely to work on future LTE networks in Spain (but this is far from guaranteed, unless someone can find the exact bands to be used).\n\nA: This is what I found;\nTelefonica, Vodafone and Orange have won Spain's LTE auction held last week by the Spanish Ministry of Industry. Operators paid €1.65bn between them for 800MHz and 2.6GHz licenses.\nVodafone Spain bid successfully for a total of 20 MHz (2x10 MHz) in the 800 MHz band and 40 MHz (2x20MHz) in 2.6 GHz band for a total consideration of €518 million (£454 million). \nTelefonica won 5 blocks in the 800 MHz, 900 MHz and 2.6 GHz frequency bands. The total cost of the five blocks amounts to €668.3 million.\nThe 800 MHz ‘digital dividend’ spectrum will become available in 2014 after the switchover from analogue to all-digital TV broadcasting in Spain. The 2.6 GHz spectrum band is immediately available for use.\nOrange has not disclosed the details yet.\n", "Q: AD User as an administrator on the Mac?

Inkscape is free and has a good number of features, but the user experience is pretty terrible.  Every other (cheaper) commercial offering I've used lacked even basic features that Illustrator had a decade ago.\nI've tried using cheaper programs, but when they cost 1/10th what Illustrator does (or less), they invariably end up being 1/10th the program that Illustrator is, too.  I've not actually been able to complete a full image without exporting to SVG, and loading it into Inkscape to finish the job.\nMaybe there's something out there I've missed (and I'd love to hear about it), but in my mind, there's two options: suck up having to deal with a lousy UI and use Inkscape, or suck up having to pay $600 and buy Illustrator.\n\nA: Vectormagic will help with the conversion to vector images.\n\nA: Another one to check out is iDraw.  \nAlso, if your need is short-term try a brief subscription to the Adobe Creative Cloud.  Might also be good for one-time file conversions so you can then get stuff into formats that work with less expensive applications.  FWIW.\n\nA: Sketch boasts an impressive feature set, and I'm personally finding it very useful for the two tasks you described.\nPaintcode caters to the same needs, but trades some power in the drawing tools for tight integration with Mac/iOS drawing code.\nAs of October 2012, both apps have recently received major upgrades, and are regularly updated.\n\nA: Intaglio is described as traditional Mac drawing with the power of Mac OSX\nhttp://www.purgatorydesign.com/Intaglio/\nMapdiva produces two vector programs Artboard and Ortelius which are very commendable\nhttp://www.mapdiva.com/\nI have only ever used Drawberry, which is an easy to use powerful application:\nhttp://raphaelbost.free.fr/DrawBerry.html\n\nA: OmniGraffle from The Omni Group might be just what you're looking for. It's a commercial application but it's significantly cheaper than Illustrator. I've been using it for a good few years now as a better alternative to Visio, mainly to draw network diagrams, however I did use it a few times also to draw app icons, etc. \nIt supports exporting to PNG, SVG and a host of other formats (however I don't think Illustrator's format is supported). \nThey offer a 30-day demo version as well, so you can download it and try it out and see if you like it. Once you decide to go ahead with it, there are two versions: a standard and a pro - have a look at a feature comparison and decided which one you need. \n\nA: It sounds like you are just looking for something like Edraw Max. \nIt's a vector drawing software with minimum learning curve. Can draw any graphic you like and save to SVG, PNG, PS, PDF, JPEG, etc.\nSupport Mac, Windows and Linux.\n\n", "Q: Time machine encrypted backups \nPossible Duplicate:\nTime Machine + FileVault on Lion or Mountain \n\nDuring a Time Machine backup, is the backed up data at any time unencrypted? \n\n\n*\n\n*If yes: can I disable that at the cost, perhaps, of time/space?\n\n*If no: why does the system say \"Encryping...\" when I stop a running backup before returning the Time Machine state to \"waiting for next backup\"?\n\n\nA: The new FileVault is a whole drive encryption, so Time Machine doesn't do any sort of encryption. The kernel / OS handles encryption as the data gets written to the drive so it's an all-or-none type of thing.\nOnce encryption is on for a specific drive, all new writes are encrypted whether or not Time Machine or another process is writing. The \"Encrypting...\" status is transient where the system is going through every block on the device and encrypting it so short of disabling the entire drive's setting to be under FileVault control there is no way to opt out of encryption for some new writes while leaving the encryption enabled.\n\nA: According to this page, there is an \"Encrypt backup disk\" available when you add a new Time Machine disk in Lion.\nStarting in Mountain Lion, OS X gains the ability to encrypt (and decrypt?) existing Time Machine drives.\n", "Q: Mobile Account as Administrators Not Working While Mobile I had a user that was set up to administer an OS X machine. That user is an AD account, with mobile accounts enabled. The user's AD group is set to allow administration using the directory utility.\nI was contacted by the user while he was on the road, saying that he couldn't install a program. It would ask for an administrative user and password, and give a dialog bounce when he entered his information.\nWhen he got to one of our offices, he connected to their network and it let him install the application.\nDoes the settings for users in an AD group allowed to administer the machine only work when the machine is in communication to AD servers, even with mobile accounts set up to allow caching of user credentials? Is there a way to cache the fact that user Bob is able to administer the machine without creating a separate user account?\n\nA: I have encountered the same issue with our Mountain Lion image for our Macbook Pro machines when they are connected to our (2008 R2) Domain. When connected they are able to Administer, but when disconnected the ability to Administer is removed. I even enabled administration by the Domain Users Security Group, but this did not help.\nWhat I do to correct this issue is ensure the mobile account has been created on the machine, then log in with the hidden local admin account, disconnect all networking (turn wi-fi off and unplug from lan), then restart the machine. Log in once again with the local admin account, then set the \"Allow user to administer this computer\" flag for the user's mobile account. You have to then restart the Macbook once more (for the change to be embedded). You can then either log in yourself using the local admin account or allow the mobile user to log back into the machine and turn the networking (wi-fi) back on, or plug back into the network, depending on your architecture. Yes it is a manual process, but it is the only one I have found so far that works.\nWhen the machine is connected to the domain it can validate the Domain security group the user is part of, and set the Administration option appropriately. I can only surmise that OSX does NOT store Domain security information, so that when disconnected from the Domain the security group cannot be determined, so it reverts to the \"local\" mobile account option (which we have now set to allow administration). I do not know if this same issue applies when using Open Directory. \nI hope this helps.\n", "Q: How can I add an Apple email address to an email client such as Evolution?

I got my iPhone 5 this week.\nWhile browsing with Safari, on WiFi (which I am using to post this question), my battery life drops at a steady rate of 1% per 5 minutes. I have been timing it from 64% to 56%, and its been exactly constant for each percentage point.\nAll widgets are off and I have double-tapped the Home button to make sure Safari is the only app running.\n5 minutes times 100 percentage points comes out to about 8 hours and 20 minutes, but Apple says it should last up to 10 hours browsing on WiFi.\nAm I just being OCD or is my battery a little weak?\nHow much deviance from the estimated time is normal?\n\nA: While quite possibly you do end up with a lower battery life in your tests than the one advertised, you need to take into account the following:\nTest conditions\nMany factors will determine the outcome when testing the battery life, like signal strength, iPhone settings, screen brightness, the actual websites being loaded, background processes and much more. FYI, apple discloses it's test conditions, you can read about them here. If you truly want to compare, you should as best as possible mimic the test conditions Apple used.\nTest accuracy\nWhile I have no problem taking you for your word your battery drops 1 percent exactly every 5 minutes while browsing, that doesn't necessarily mean you end up with 8 hours and 20 minutes of battery life. There is quite a large margin for error when you only sample such a small period, and the only real way of checking Apple's claims would be by actually trying to surf the web for 10 consecutive hours.\nConcluding, while Apple's test conditions are semi-optimal for their testing results, they have a better reputation for test accuracy than some other manufacturers. They do test the iPhone with almost factory default settings, but specifically for browsing the actual web sites being loaded can still make a noticeable difference in the test results.\nFrom the info you provided, your battery seems perfectly fine to me and within the margins of difference one would expect.\n\nA: I've found the iPhone 5 to be extremely sensitive to the quality and strength of cellular connection, much more so that other phones I've owned, but this is to the credit of Apple.\nOn the positive side this has resulted in the loss of only 6% - yes, 6% -  in 7.5 hours with very light use, staying in a location with excellent 3G signal strength and, presumably, no tower hand-off as I was relatively static during that time.\nThe flipside is the expected mediocre performance when travelling in and out of varying coverage, with the battery being in the low 20s after about 10 hours. I should point out this is in line with my experiences with other smartphones though, so not a poor reflection on the iPhone 5.\nOverall I find it slightly better than any of my previous Android devices, easily managing a full day of normal use, but it will inevitably struggle to see the day out if used for long periods e.g. waiting at an airport or on a train ride.\nI should point out that my phone is an A1429 GSM model on the Vodafone UK network which, at time of writing, doesn't offer LTE.\n\nA: I like to run some tests with each new iPhone where I charge it fully and then run it down without charging. When the device shuts itself off, you get a logfile showing how long the device ran and how long it slept.\nIncident Identifier: 5FABC917-4A0C-4DB4-992C-517B046AB02B\nCrashReporter Key:   f8fa10d17990b92b51f4af68531ed318840a78e6\nDate:                2012-09-27 17:39:56 -0500\nOS Version:          iPhone OS 6.0 (10A405)\n\nSpringBoard: com.apple.springboard.idle NoIdleSleepAssertion == 255, held for 02:06:50\n\nHardware Model: N42AP\nAwake Time: 09:20:37 (33636)\nStandby Time: 18:26:05 (66365)\nPartial Charge: 0\nCapacity: 0\nVoltage: 3401 mV\n\nIn this case, the device ran for more than 9 hours and 20 minutes before it needed to shut itself down. Each battery is different, but you can tell a batter is starting to lose capacity when the Awake Time starts to drop an hour or more instead of holding mostly steady.\nSince voltage (and amp-hour estimates) decrease non-linearly and the % remaining is a well-modeled but educated guess, the best plan is to measure the whole charge a few times to see how your settings match your expectations.\n", "Q: How does the built-in Audio of the Thunderbolt Display compare to the MacBook Pro Retna? I'm trying to understand which device has better audio capabilities.  I tried to do independent research, but the Apple site only has generic information for the MacBook Pro and the Thunderbolt Display\nWhat are the detailed audio specs of each device and which one is better for Audio?\n\nA: According to the technical specifications, the thunderbolt display has 2.1 stereo speakers with a subwoofer and the system is rated at 49 W.\nNo one would consider the any MacBook Pro with the small internal speakers to be superior to the wall-powered solution that is part of the display.\nYou will want something like an external DAC if you are concerned about audio quality or want to connect speakers that are better amplified and suited to a special situation other than casual listening. The Display Port monitor is better than many $150 speaker systems, but you can also get quite amazing external sound starting at that price point in the US.\n", "Q: How should I configure my Audio settings for the highest quality sound? I would like to configure my Mac and Thunderbolt display for the best Audio output.  The \"Audio Devices\" tab allows me to choose\n\n\n*\n\n*Audio Format in Hz\n\n*2 channel xx bit Integer or Float \nWhat configuration offers the best sound?  I suppose higher in Hz is better, and more bits are better, but I don't know if I should choose 24bit integer or 32bit float\n\nA: 48000Hz is more than adequate for the audio range as there are not going to be any pre-recorded formats above this, and the human ear can only hear around 20000Hz anyway. CDs are only 44100, most DVDs now are at 48000, and while BluRay supports 96000 it's unlikely the audio is actually recorded in that quality.\n24bit integer vs 32bit float is actually the same quality, the 8 floating bits on the later are for other things which generally come into play with music production I believe.\n", "Q: What hardware do I need if I need to frequently adjust the height and rotation of 2 Thunderbolt monitors? I have a small apartment and have one Thunderbolt display, a retina MacBook Pro, and am considering a second Thunderbolt Display.\nI plan on purchasing VESA kits for each display, but am getting hung up on what kind of hardware to buy to handle the rotation of screens and what I should do with my MacBook, and still make the small space aesthetically pleasing.\nWhat options are there to rotate a monitor 90 degrees (so I can view long documents) and to rotate it back so I can multitask or watch videos?\nWhat should I look for in a desk that would work well with this setup?\n\nA: Two 27\" displays will (obviously) take up quite a bit of room. You'll probably want to look for a desk that has built-in mounting points for your VESA arms (or built-in VESA arms) so you don't have to hang the displays off the wall. (If you want to rotate the monitor, Apple's Thunderbolt displays don't have any built-in rotation ability, so you'll need an arm that does that, too. OS X's Displays preferences are where you'll go to set the rotation on the display.)\nThere are several different caddies for your MacBook (such as the Henge Docks) that will keep it out of the way of your displays. \n", "Q: Safari drag drop download On previous versions of OS X I used to be able to go to a file in Safari, click and drag on the favicon and take it over to my downloads window, which would then download that file.\nSo for instance if i was listening to this file and wanted to download it in Lion. All I had to do was drag the icon in the address bar over to the download window. \nNow I can't do that anymore. In fact I have no idea how to download that file except to make a webpage with the a href and then right click the link. \n\nA: Actually, in Safari 6.x when the location bar has focus, ⌘+S brings up the export dialog to save the current page as an archive.\nThat's not what you want, however.\nYou want to download some component from a site like an mp3 or a Java jar that you know the path to, but there's no exposed link.\n⌥+↩ (option-return) to the rescue.

I still need it \"Remember networks this computer has joined\" since I use my company's secure network and I don't want to reenter all the credentials all the time.\n\nA: Go to the network preferences, select \"Wi-Fi\", and click \"Advanced...\" (you may have to click the lock in the bottom left first).  Then, in the \"Preferred Networks\" list, delete any that you don't want. \nThe passwords are saved separately, in the keychain.  I have verified that removing an SSID from the list in the network preferences doesn't remove it from the keychain, so you can delete them without worrying. (this is unlike the case with iOS, where forgetting a network also forgets the password)\nYou may also want to uncheck \"Remember networks this computer has joined\" to prevent them from being re-added when you join them again.   Again, this is separate from the \"Save password in keychain\" that saves the password in the keychain when you enter it.\n", "Q: Set the date and time in menubar to be in a specific format I want the menubar to display the date and time in the menubar as follows: \n2012-10-03 09.12.14\n\nwhich translates into Year-Month-Day 24hr.min.second\nWhat I've tried: \nGone into System Preferences > Date & Time > Clock\nSelected: Digital; Display time with seconds; use 24-hour clock \nThis gets me close to having the time right.\nGone into System Preferences > Date & Time > Date & Time > Open Language & Text > Formats > Dates > Customize\nChanged every date format (short, medium, long, full) to have yyyy-MM-dd\nGone into System Preferences > Date & Time > Date & Time > Open Language & Text > Formats > Times > Customize\nChange every time format to kk.mm.ss\nThe problem: \nIt still shows the date like: \n3 Oct 13:19:12\n\nin the menubar. \nDetails:\nI am running Mac OS X 10.7.5\nAny help or suggestions you can give, much appreciated!\n\nA: There is a free app called Day-O that is flexible and can do what is being asked:  https://shauninman.com/archive/2016/10/20/day_o_2_mac_menu_bar_clock\n\nA: Whilst I'm not sure this is possible with the built-in menubar clock formats, you can acheive the format you require using the excellent iStat Menus ($16, but it does have a 14-day free trial).\n\n\nA: I know it's an old thread but in case anyone else is looking for alternatives, I recommend Itsycal.

Since doing so, my screen seems dimmer. \nI never changed the brightness settings to begin with, from opening the factory-sealed box up until the reset, so I am not sure why this seems to be the case. The auto-brightness seems to be using a lower intensity for any given lighting condition since the reset.\nAm I just imagining things, or is this possible?\n\nA: You probably are just imagining things, unless dirt has been obstructing your ambient light sensor and beside resetting your settings, you cleaned it too.\n", "Q: Retina macbook max USB power output Could someone tell me how much Amperes (Amps) the Retina MacBook Pro can deliver over USB?\nI thought that one should be able to charge an iPad with a Retina MacBook which would mean that it should be about 1A minimum (probably rather 2-5A for an iPad3). However when I plug in my Android phone to charge, it does charge slower than on an 1A USB charger.\n\nA: With the System Profiler you'll be able to know how much power does the USB delivers, and how much is required for each device connected to a USB. Under the Hardware tab, you'll find, listed, all the USB ports, and, within, all the devices connected to them. Just select one of those to get detailed information.\nTo open System Profiler just choose Apple Menu / About this Mac and clicking More Info, or go to Applications / Utilities.\n\nA: Macs with USB 2.0 from the last few years can generally provide 1.0A via USB. The USB 3.0 standard specifies 900mA; I suspect that USB3 Macs still provide 1A or even a little more. Note however, that in order for a device to actually draw that much, it must specifically request it from the bus. Apple's iDevices certainly do this, as you can see in System Profiler (as mentioned in the other answer). For a USB 2.0 device to request more than 500mA, it must implement a special protocol extension, which few devices follow. The reason those devices might still draw 1A from a pure charger is because they detect that the data lines are not connected in the usual way.\nLikewise, the iPad only draws 1.0A when connected to a Mac (or even 500mA from most PCs), but 2.0A when connected to the special iPad charger. The charger has its data pins pulled to special indicator voltages via a potential divider, and the iPad only draws that much current if it detects this configuration to avoid damaging whatever it's plugged into.\n\nA: With a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Early 2013)\nI got this when charging an iPad, which is 2100mA in total.\n\n\nA: I have a Late 2013 MacBook Pro. The output with a iPhone 7 Plus connected to the USB 3 Left port is 1.8 Amps. Verified using a USB power meter dongle. This only happens once the iPhone has booted. Before booting, the iPhone takes only .38 amps. \nSystem profiler shows the following:\nCurrent Available (mA): 500\nCurrent Required (mA):  500\n**Extra Operating Current (mA): 1600**\nSleep current (mA): 2100\n\nSo it seems the MacBook Pros can indeed output approximately 2 amps. Which should be enough to fast-charge at least the iPhone X.\n\n\nA: The maximum amount of power that your MacBook or Apple Display can provide depends on whether it has USB 2 or USB 3 ports.\n\n*\n\n*USB 2 - 500mA\n\n*USB 3 - 900mA\n\nSee Using USB devices with your Mac for complete details.\nSystem Information (Apple menu  > About This Mac) can give you more details about USB power.\n\n*\n\n*Current Available is the default amount of power available to your device\n\n*Current Required is what the device is asking for\n\n*Extra Operating Current is extra current available to certain Apple devices like iPhones and iPads.\n\nSource:  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204377\n\nTL;DR\nThe maximum amount of power is dependent on whether you have USB 2 or USB 3 ports, 500maA and 900mA respectively.  However, if you plug in certain Apple devices, there is extra current available which your device can use.  It's not generally available to all devices (like Android phones or tablets)\n", "Q: Where does Quicktime store its screen recordings? I was recording my screen whilst giving a presentation. Instead of stopping the recording cleanly I closed the lid of my laptop. Later, when I opened it again, the recording had stopped, but there was no sign of the resulting file. Can anyone tell me where the recording may be stored on disk so I can recover it?\n\nA: Although the recording did stop when closing the lid, it does not mean that the recording is saved.\nIf it is, by Command clicking on the file's name, the full path where you can find it will be displayed.\nThe default storing place, of course, is under ~/Documents.\n\nA: As of OSX Sierra, it's here:\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX/Data/Library/Autosave Information\n\n\nIn there, there is a container/package/directory called Unsaved QuickTime Player Document.qtpxcomposition that contains a Screen Recording.mov file with the actual video. You can copy-paste that mov file wherever to save it permanently.\n\nYou can also double-click the Unsaved QuickTime Player Document file directly. That file opens in QuickTime, and allows you to save in a proper place. Note that sometimes QuickTime will fail to save a Screen Recording with the error \"The operation could not be completed\" (using File > Export As might work, though), so copy-pasting is probably less prone to error.\nMy battery ran out when I was recording and found my file there.\n\nA: As of Catalina and Monterey, I found my recording under ~/Library/ScreenRecordings\n\nA: \nLook for a very large .mov file (with an appropriate date) in\n  /private/var/folders/[randomly named subfolder]/[randomly named\n  subfolder]/-Tmp-/TemporaryItems/.  It's where Snow Leopard (and later\n  OS, as far as I know) puts temp files created in the preparation of a\n  QT screen recording. If you do find this large .mov file, COPY it to\n  the Desktop.  Under normal conditions, these temp files get deleted\n  automatically when the screen recording process completes; however,\n  when the process fails to finish properly, sometimes these temp files\n  linger.\n\nThis community thread should help anyone with this issue under OSX 10.8.\n\nA: The screen recording movies are saved in the \"Autosave Information\" file if you didn't save them or close them manually. I stumbled on it a while ago, and believe me its not easy to find. They are located in a hidden \"Library\" file. The only way I found it was by searching for \"autosave\" in Finder, and I was able to recover my lost screen recording! There are several of those \"Autosave Information\" files for different apps like Chess, and Quicktime! But the specific \"Library\" file (where the autosave file is located) is hidden (at least on my computer) so, like I said, you can only get to it by searching for \"Autosave Information\" in finder. If you have any files autosaved, they would be there. I was able to recover my files there. Also I should mention I found my screen recordings there after I had to restart my computer without originally saving them. Such a relief!\n\nA: I don't know if you'll find this helpful, but there are two ways I can think that you could find this\nThis might be too obvious, and you might have it stored in a hidden folder, like others have suggested, but I always think its good to start with the obvious. First, create a new screen recording that then close the recording without saving it. It will ask you to determine where you want to save it and it should be the default folder. Then just open finder and find that folder - lmk if that doesn't make sense.\nThe second is grab grand perspective and scan your hard drive folder. Look for a massive movie. If you still can't find it (perhaps because it is too small and you have too much on your hard drive. You could try to replicate the process by recording a massive movie file, closing your computer, and rescanning to look for that. That file will give you the same folder path as the other one.\nYes, these aren't super technical, but they might work.\n", "Q: Qt Creator for Mac My Uni course requires me to use Qt Creator for our coursework but I would like to also put it on my Mac so that I can do more work at home. I had assumed it was available for free but when I tried to download it, I was told to register for a 30-day trial, which I took to mean that the software isn't free.\nCan I get Qt Creator for Mac for free and where from?\n\nA: You have to go to the Qt open-source site:\nhttp://qt-project.org/downloads\n\nThe Qt SDK version 1.2.1 released on April 11th contains:\n\n*\n\n*Qt libraries version 4.8.1\n\n*Simulator for Symbian phones and the Nokia N9\n\n*Qt Creator IDE version 2.4.1\n\n*Qt Mobility version 1.2\n\n*Qt development tools\n\n*Remote compilers\n\n\nThe Qt SDK includes Qt Creator.\n\nNote that the installer is 760 MB.\n", "Q: Where can I configure \"erase mac\" iCloud offers the service to remotely wipe (erase) a mac, as you can remotely erase an iPhone.\nWhere can I change this setting, e.g. disable it?\n\nA: The Find My Mac feature can be enabled and disabled in the iCloud settings (System Preferences → iCloud)\n\nYou cannot disable just the \"erase\" feature: the locate, lock and erase features must be managed as a single option.\n", "Q: How to remove leading or trailing spaces from copy/paste operations?

I still get the Little Snitch dialog asking for permission to connect to radarsubmissions.apple.com.\nIt seems the connection attempt is triggered by a launchd job located at /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.DiagnosticReportCleanUp.plist. On Mountain Lion 10.8.4, it's set up to run every day at 11 am. If I clear the Little Snitch rules for the SubmitDiagInfo process and run the following command to start the launchd job sudo launchctl start com.apple.DiagnosticReportCleanUp, the Little Snitch connection dialog pops up.\nThis seems to be a bug as the DiagnosticReportCleanUp job is not respecting the Privacy setting in System Preferences.

I have blocked the data going out through Little Snitch, but it periodically keeps retrying whilst the volume of data to be sent keeps growing !!\nTo summarise, it seems that there is no way to prevent the reports from being sent, as the option to do so is seemingly ignored, and you should consider using tools like LittleSnitch etc to block it instead until this is fixed.\n", "Q: Can I partially use iCloud with someone else's Apple ID without syncing contacts to my device?

After upgrading my device from iOS 4.3.3 to iOS 6, iTunes doesn't allows me to restore from an old backup, saying that it is an incompatible backup.\nWhy is this? Is there any way I could restore from this old backup? And, if not, is there any way I could retrieve the data from this backup?\n\nA: There are several apps for extracting backups.\nThe one I have used is Iphone/Ipod Touch Backup Extractor, it's been around for a while now and it is freeware, just make a donation if you find it useful to help the developer keep it updated.\nYou simply select from which backup you want to restore by pressing the button \"Read Backups\", then select from the list of application settings that can be restored.\nThere is a detailed step by step guide here\n\nA: This is Alex from Reincubate.

Lost Mine! My daughter gained my contacts on her iPhone.  When she noticed this she deleted all of my contacts from her phone and now I find that when she performed that, I lost all of my personal contacts and am left with only the contacts on her phone.  If I restore how do I know I am not restoring back to her contacts? How do I make my phone the primary and RESTORE to get my contacts back and not hers?\n\nA: Been there, feel for you friend. \nThere's two answers to this. \nIf you're both using iCloud then you may be out of luck, or both your address books may be merged. When it was happening to me, the cloud service kept getting confused and just deleting all of my contacts (this happened daily for a few months! - mobileMe days) Anyways, if you're syncing with iCloud, and you're the only one, you should be able to log  in with your credentials and get your contacts back. you will be prompted with a replace, merge or purge notice that you're about to delete all the contacts on the phone. It is my theory your daughter saw this message and didn't think anything of it thinking \"well, i'll delete my dad's contacts and get mine back\" Problem is, somehow her iCloud and yours are now confused\nCase two, hard backup... If you have a back up that predates your daughter's incident you can try restoring from that as your contacts are a part of that backup; however, this can cause confusion with the iCloud service so be careful if you are indeed using iCloud.\nWhat i recommend trying is first do a back up of your daughters contacts, export them to a CSV or something like Address Book for Mac or Outlook for PC. This will just ensure her information is secured while you're working on recovering your own. Next, try a restore and find a restore point that predates this occurrence (the one your daughter used will probably work) Since you didn't say you did any restore to your own i think it's pretty safe to assume we're having an iCloud issue... make sure her phone isn't signed in to your iCloud, and if you share an iCloud account (or use multiple as families often do) disable the contacts on your account. Hopefully once you restore your phone your contacts will all be set.. and with your daughter's phone already having contact cloud sync off she should be good too.\nit's really frustrating, i sympathize. Good luck! :)\n", "Q: HD screen recording of iOS App I'm struggling to record a high quality video of my iOS app. There are several similar questions out there, but my focus is on high quality. To my knowledge there are only two options to record a screen and both have some serious limitations.\nScreen recording in the simulator\n\n\n*\n\n*The quality is just not as good as on the device because of two reasons. First, OS X (Quicktime) has a built in screen recording function but the compression is very high and non-adjustable. I found screenium to give me much better result. However, even with the issue of compression solved, the color depth in the simulator is not as rich as on the device creating very visible artefact (even before recording it).\n\n*The performance of the iOS app in the simulator is much worse than on an actual (modern) device. Especially when using OpenGL, I notice a substantial drop in the framerate.\nRecording the app on the device\n\n\n*\n\n*I could just hold a camera and record the iPhone with the app running on it. For obvious reasons this doesn't seem like the ideal solution.\n\n*I could use a third party app to record the AirPlay mirrored screen on a Mac. Again, this would involve some serious performance decrease and compression artefacts because of the encoding process.\n\n*I could use a VGA adapter and record that, but the quality of the VGA signal is also not the same as on the device (RETINA display).\nI'm looking for any kind of advice on this topic. A way to increase the color depth in the simulator, a way to increase the speed of an app in the simulator, a professional way to record the screen from the device, an efficient way to encode frames on the fly in the app...\n\nA: The iPad 2 and 3, and iPhone 4S and 5 can do screen mirroring over HDMI, using Apple's Digital AV Adapter. Combined with an HDMI capture device, this should give you the best possible quality.\n\nA: Check out the app Reflection.\nIt allows you to transmit your ios device's screen over wifi to your mac and record it at the same time. Brilliant app.\n", "Q: Will FaceTime reveal my caller ID on an incoming call? Obviously if I initiate a FaceTime call then the recipient will see the caller ID that I've selected in my FaceTime settings.\nHowever, if someone calls me at one of my alternative addresses, is my chosen caller ID revealed to them in any way? Or will they still only know about the address/number they used?\n\nA: For all the experience I have, calling my family in multiple IDs, the person only knows the ID that they already have, and FaceTime has no options to automatically reveal the other IDs that person uses.\nI wanted to enable some automatic thing like this for myself, because I have 4 different cell numbers and 3 e-mails with FaceTime.\nStill have not found how to do it.\nSo for you, the answer is \"no, they still only know about the ID they used\".\n", "Q: How do I \"unhide\" or \"show\" a hidden login item on Mountain Lion?

I have never seen the \"read\" tag before, however I have seen \"delivered\" and nothing. What does the \"read\" tag mean?\n\nA: Delivered means that it's gotten to its destination. Read means that the user has actually opened the text in the Messages app. \n\nA: Read means the user that you sent the message to actually opened up the iMessage app. If it says delivered, they most likely didn't look at the message although it was sent through. You can change it though in Settings to make it that you don't send a read receipt when you read a message.\n\nA: It means the person you sent the message to has read it.\n", "Q: If MacbookPro has BIOS emulation, why the need for ELILO for Linux? I'm not fully versed in how the EFI booting process happens. If I want to install Linux in a partition formerly used by Windows, why can I not simply use LILO, installing the boot section in the \"root\" instead the MBR?\nThanks.\n\nA: The BIOS emulation only kicks in if you use MBR or hybrid GUID + MBR partitioning. By default, Macs only use GUID partitioning. Installing Windows via Boot Camp enables this hybrid partitioning, but you can in principle also do it manually for Linux. The downside is that you then have to maintain two partition tables and make sure to keep them in sync.\nIt is rumoured that you can still boot Mac OS X from a pure MBR, too. I've never tried this, and even if it does work, I suspect things like firmware updates and FileVault 2 FDE will not work in such a configuration. You'll probably also have problems with multi-booting unless your bootloader supports OSX directly.\n", "Q: Mountain Lion Title Bar Truncation With OSX Mountain Lion (10.8.2) there is a UI problem. \nCalendar + Reminder +  Sticky Note apps have truncated title text\nIf i login as a guest they are correct. There is clearly a preference somewhere which is causing this but I've got no idea how to fix it. \n\n\nA: The similarities between these three applications is that they all show \"Updating...\" in the title bar when sending/receiving data. Maybe something related to sync services or Calendar Agent? It might help to reset sync services.\nIssues that are only occurring within your user account (and not others) are most likely related to preferences or other data inside of that account. A great place to start is the ~/Library/Preferences folder. Performing a split-half search on the contents of that directory is a good way to attack the issues. If the problem doesn't lie within the Preferences folder, there's a good chance that it's in ~/Library somewhere (Calendars?).\nIf you're lucky, the upgrade to Mavericks won't use the same functionality (i.e., won't read the corrupt preferences)...However, you may still experience the issues in that OS if you install over the top of your current user environment.\n", "Q: Using an iPhone 5 (Verizon version) in Europe and India?

No full-screen apps, some apps are shown on my small laptop screen, other apps are shown on my Thunderbolt display.  When I unplug the Thunderbolt display, I would like programs arranged differently, e.g., the browser is a full-screen app.  Is there any program that will let me \"save\" my window state when I have an external monitor plugged in, and save another layout when I don't have any external display, and automatically switch between the two when it detects that external display has been plugged in or unplugged?  I'm on Mountain Lion on a MacBook Pro.\n\nA: Stay\nby Cordless Dog. It saves window state for each display configuration you might have.\n\n\nA: Moom\nMove, zoom, and snap windows.

I was trying to use port 8080 for some testing and I received the error that another process was already listening on it. My invocation of nmap returned different results depending on whether I was using sudo or not. This did not make sense to me.\nI was really concerned when I could not figure out what was processes were listening on these ports using sudo lsof -P -n -iTCP | grep LIST. This led me to believe that there was malicious software intentionally hiding itself.\nI ended up removing files from /Library/LaunchDaemons/ until I narrowed it down to the culprit. The application responsible for all these opened ports was the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobile Client. Unfortunately, in order for this Cisco VPN client to work, it must have all these ports opened. Apparently, it is also responsible for the firewall rule addition that you reported with ipfw show.\nIt still boggles my mind why it does not show which process is responsible for the open ports when using lsof. No application should be able to avoid being listed using this method. Perhaps the reason for the process not being listed will be answered in another stackexchange question.\n\nA: In my case I've got this from lsof.\nGeneralSe 57613  root  8u  IPv6 0x2ffc9f7c6daebd5b  0t0  TCP *:8080 (LISTEN)\n\nSo after dig into the LaunchDaemon, I found these files and deleted them.\ncom.GeneralSearchSignDaemon.plist\ncom.GeneralSearchSignP.plist\n\nThen port becomes free.\nI think this process is connected with Yarn but it was not solved automatically even I removed Yarn.\n", "Q: How to mute bootup sound? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I disable or get rid of the startup sound my Mac makes? \n\nI have an old MacBook Pro (pre-unibody) running OS 10.6.

What version of the operating system? –  Daniel Lawson♦ Oct 3\n  '12 at 17:35\n\nI just used three-finger drag to select that text and then used the Cmd-C and Cmd-V for copying and pasting. That's all you're likely to need except in situations where an app requires you to move a switch or drag a visual object.\n\nA: I don't know of a native way to do this, but I use LaunchBar to perform actions you'd typically use a pointer for using my keyboard all the time. Move, copy, rename or delete files or folders. Drop a file or folder on to a program so it opens it. You can even use it to perform complex moves and opens by using the copy-merge feature to put multiple files on to a single clipboard entry and moving that. See ObDevs Tips page for a quick run down of some of the things you can do with LaunchBar.\nIt's rather ridiculous what you can do without leaving the keyboard when you have LaunchBar installed on your Mac.

First turn off CAMERA ROLL from your backup, iCloud will delete those previously backed up photos. Back up again, then turn your CAMERA ROLL back up, on again. Then back up again. You will recover all your photos and the back up will reflect the correct size. \n", "Q: iTunes Match turning off occassionally I am experiencing weird problem with my iTunes Match subscription. Ever since upgrading to iOS 6 my devices spontaneously turn off iTunes Match this happened twice so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*First shortly after upgrading my iPhone 4S and the new iPad to iOS 6. I upgraded, downloaded some songs and about a week later all my devices (inc. PC and a MacBook Pro) got iTunes Match turned off. This wasn't a problem for PC and MacBook as iTunes doesn't erase the music from them, but I had to download all the songs on iOS devices again.\n\n*Second time happened today - my PC and iPad got iTunes Match turned off. Again - no problem for PC, but have to download my music onto iPad all over again. You can imagine how time consuming this may be especially considering you cannot upload the music from desktop iTunes once you have iTunes Match on.\nAny ideas why this might happen? There is absolutely no involvement from my side when this happens. All ma devices run latest Apple software (iTunes, OS X and iOS).\nWhere should I report it if I wanted to complain about it to Apple?\n\nA: Are you logging out of your Apple account?\nOne possibility is that you are being logged out of your Apple account for some reason, either automatically or manually. If you are logging out of your account manually, then that's probably disabling iTunes Match because the service is attached with your account.\nThere are several situations in which you will be logged out of your Apple account automatically. For instance, when I first started using iTunes Match, I noticed that for some reason iTunes Match kept turning off. I later realized that it was because I had apps from different accounts installed (such as two accounts from different countries), so when I logged in to a different Apple account from the one that I use for iTunes Match so that I could update some of my apps, iTunes Match would disable itself.\nTry clearing the cache\nThe cache could also be causing problems. I know that it this happens on the desktop version of iTunes; I'm not so sure if the iOS version also has cache problems, or at least I don't know if it's possible to clear any part of the cache on iOS.\nTo clear iTunes's cache, here are some helpful instructions.\n", "Q: Where and how I find the songs in iphone 5 which were downloaded into itunes Can someone help me with this.

But on iPhone where these songs would have been downloaded?? When I go to the itunes tab on iphone 5 it takes me straight to it main page and if I go the downloaded ones then that one is empty. \n\nA: The iTunes app on the iPhone is for browsing the iTunes store.

As a developer (primarily JVM-based web apps), I need to use a lot of different tools and services, such as Redis, RabbitMQ, MySQL, git, mercurial, etc. Having worked in a Linux environment where such tools are just an apt-get away, and a Windows world where I just run what I need in a VMWare Workstation VM (aka. also just an apt-get away + vm overhead), I'm a bit lost now that I'm hoping to move away from Windows and into the Mac ecosystem for my computing life.\nI've read about MacPorts vs. Fink vs. Homebrew and found it all to be a bit confusing as to which one will suit my needs the best, though I think MacPorts is the most flexible option of the three.\nSince I'm used to running what I need in a VM, however, is there anything against doing that when using OS X? What are the tradeoffs between going with MacPorts to install things directly vs. using an Ubuntu VM (via VMWare Fusion) to host the tools / services I need?\nIn particular, I am concerned with the disk usage, maintainability, and ease of use more than I am concerned with performance. In other words, this is what I care about (in order of preference):\n\n\n*\n\n*Ease of use - How easy is it to develop on the Mac and use the tools / services\n\n*Disk usage - How much disk-space is taken up. The newer macbooks use SSDs and space is at a premium.\n\n*Maintainability - What work is involved in keeping packages updated, adding new packages, and removing old ones\n\n*Currentness - How up-to-date are the tools / services that are available\n\n*Performance - How fast things run, services in particular\n\n\nMy instinct says that installing the actual development tools, like Mercurial, git, etc. directly via the projects' recommended method, and then installing the server-side components like MySQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, etc. into a VM is the best route, but what are the pros-cons of doing this vs. going with something like MacPorts?\nNote: I realize that this is a rather programming-centric question, but the central issue is that OS X is different from Windows and *nix when it comes to setting up a development environment and I'm not sure how to navigate in these OS X-specific waters.\n\nA: Ultimately this is a fairly personal question, that will depend a lot on your workflow and preferences, but I'll add what I can.\nMy instinct is in line with yours—install the tools you need for writing your code natively, and use a VM for your server-side environment. My reasoning on this is that you (presumably) bought a Mac to use it, and doing most of your development work in a Linux VM seems like a bit of a waste. Use the native tools so that you can use them with whatever other OS X software you may want.\nSimilarly, while you could probably do a decent job of mimicking your deployment environment in OS X, using a VM is the best way to guarantee exact compatibility (it also makes it easier to manage different versions of your various programs, if you need to work with a production environment and a future server upgrade, etc.).\nEase of Use\nI think the OS X tools + testing VM approach wins, as having all your development tools accessible without the need for a VM is the most frictionless, and the testing VM can act independently. OS X is BSD at the core, and as such there's great integration with the command line, particularly in developer-type tools like text editors.\nDisk Space\nVMs will obviously take up more room than just installing the tools natively, but Ubuntu seems to be able to run in a pretty small footprint (the CLI-only install on my home server runs around 3-4 GB I think, and that could probably be pared down if I tried). So unless you're really cramped for space, I wouldn't worry too much unless you need many different VMs.\nMaintainability\nI think you'll definitely want to go with a package manager, whether it's MacPorts or one of the other options. I'm not experienced with any of them, but I know MacPorts (and probably Homebrew and the others) have one line update commands, similar to apt.\nCurrentness\nThis depends a lot on how you choose to install your software, and what software you're using. Apple tends not to update the CLI tools it bundles very often (often only with major OS releases), so if you rely on a particular version of something that's otherwise built in, you may want to install a newer version (which you should do by installing to a new location, not overwriting the system version). My best advice here is to do some Googling and figure out how current the packages that are important to you are in each package manager.\nPerformance\nVM performance on any recent Mac should be pretty good, but it obviously depends on how intensive the tasks running on the guest OS are. Unless your server side component is pretty heavy (and I don't see why it would be under a development testing load), you should see pretty good performance, particularly if your VM doesn't run a GUI.\nAnyway, that's my take, perhaps others can chime in with more specific opinions on Macports vs. other options, or other takes on VM vs. native.\n\nA: I've used both approaches in different circumstances.\nWhile MacPorts is a good way to get latest versions of various GNU tools (for instance Bash 4.x, when Apple still provides 3.x) it does tend to get bungled with time, I wouldn't rely on it exclusively.\nHowever, most open-source stacks provide easy to use binary installers for Mac. I have good experience with distributions of Git, PostgreSQL and Apache. I have good experience using them for web-based development. Python scripts generally run unmodified - I've developed a web application in Python + PostgreSQL on my Macbook and simply ran it unmodified on the Linux production machine. Same for various scripts at work which wrap ssh credentials management inside Python classes etc. - Ssh is sufficiently uniform.\nI do need to run Ubuntu VMs for some purposes. I mostly do that on VMWare servers because my work Macbook Air is poorly suited for large compilations and data transfers. However I've been able to export them from VMWare  as OVF and import them to VirtualBox on the Mac. An Ubuntu VM without an X server running on Mac can be very lightweight with less than 10GB disk space and 1GB RAM. My solution for I/O intensive workloads is to create a separate partition on the Mac (completely hassle-free, no reboot required) and assign it to the Ubunbu VM as raw disk, then partition it using Linux fdisk and mount the partitions as necessary.\nSome tool recommendations for Mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*SourceTree as a Git GUI.\n\n*iTerm2 as a terminal emulator\n\n*Textwrangler\nas a small and slick text editor that is readily invoked from the\ncommand line.\n\n*Xquarz, the X server for Mac, is no longer bundled with OS/X 10.8, simply install it separately.\n\n", "Q: Why does this applescript not actually set the input volume to zero? I have this command that builds a script to mute the input volume. The input volume is not fully muted, though. It seems to be closer to 10% than 0%.\nosacompile -x -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to set volume input volume 0' -o ~/bin/mute_mic.scpt\n\nThis is odd, because the slider bar is as far left as it can go, but as you can see from the attached image, sound still is registering. However, if I use the mouse to click on the slider at zero, then it does actually mute the input.\nWhy does this happen? Am I using applescript improperly here?\n\nI can even replicate this with the basic AppleScript Editor, so I know it's not a problem with the compilation.\n\n(Note: I originally took my cue for the solution to this problem from this question's answer.)\n\nA: As far as I can tell, the script works as expected, the problem is in the OS X audio input code. When I run it, the slider goes to 0%, verified by mousing over the slider until the tooltip appears:\n\nThis is the same as if I drag the volume slider manually.\nThe problem is seemingly that \"0%\" doesn't actually mean off, but rather a very low threshold. In some quick testing, I could record the sound of my finger tapping on my MacBook Pro's casing near the mic (on most machines I believe it's around the right speaker grill) when the volume was set to 0. I could replicate that regardless of whether I set the slider manually or via AppleScript. It did seem to be low enough that virtually any other sound isn't picked up, but clearly the microphone isn't truly off.\nAs far as I can tell, there's no way to properly mute the built-in mic. The best I can suggest is changing the audio input to use the line in, if your Mac is equipped with a line in port. Doing that via AppleScript requires some GUI scripting unfortunately, but this should do it (source):\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n   activate\n   set current pane to pane id \"com.apple.preference.sound\"\nend tell\ntell application \"System Events\"\n   tell process \"System Preferences\"\n       set frontmost to true\n       --get properties of UI element of tab group of window \"Sound\"\n       click radio button \"input\" of tab group of window \"Sound\"\n       tell row 2 of table 1 of scroll area 1 of tab group 1 of window \"Sound\" to set selected to true\n   end tell\nend tell\n\nIf you have more than the two standard audio inputs (Mic and Line In), you may need to change the number in row 2 to whichever is appropriate, according to the order in your Input preferences.\n\nA: This builds off of @robmathers GUI scripting piece and my question about if you can \"click\" the slider with applescript. I did some digging into AppleScript and UI actions and it turns out you can.\nThis uses GUI scripting which is sad, but it WORKS.\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set volume input volume 0\nend tell\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    activate\n    set current pane to pane id \"com.apple.preference.sound\"\nend tell\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"System Preferences\"\n        set frontmost to true\n        click radio button \"input\" of tab group 1 of window \"Sound\"\n        perform action \"AXDecrement\" of slider 1 of group 2 of tab group 1 of window \"Sound\"\n    end tell\nend tell\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    quit\nend tell\n\nHere's what's happening in this script:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sets the input volume to 0 -- this moves the slider all the way to the left\n\n*\"Clicks\" the slider to do whatever behind-the-scenes voodoo that Apple has deemed necessary to actually \"mute\" the input line (this is getting ridiculous)\n\n*Quits the System Preferences Application.\n\n\nOne thing to note: The Sound Preferences window cannot already be open before running this or the first set volume input volume 0 doesn't work.\nIt's also trivial to edit the script to unmute (which also suffers from the same issue). (Use \"AXIncrement\" for the action)\nHuge props to @robmathers on getting me as far as I needed to figure this last piece out.

I'm currently traveling for an extended period of time with an iPod Touch running iOS 5. I don't always have wi-fi access and I usually use the Maps application to look up my destination before leaving and then once I arrive the map is still cached in the app, even without connecting again to wi-fi. It helps me get around a new city and find my hostel or hotel.\nThe only thing keeping me from upgrading to iOS 6 is whether or not I will still be able to do this with the new Apple Maps. Is this possible in the new app?\n\nA: Maps in iOS 6 should actually do a better job of this, because it uses vector based maps, which use far less data than the old image-based tiles, which means they can stay in memory longer, and more can be cached.\nYou can test this yourself by loading up Maps for an area, then turning on Airplane Mode and browsing around. In my own testing I found I could keep maps for most of Toronto, although when zooming down, it lacked street names for some of the smallest streets.\nSearching or routing won't work without a connection, but any route or places you searched for prior to disconnecting should stay in place as long as you don't clear them.\n\nA: Zoom out to show the region of the city you want to have offline in google maps.  Then do a search for \"ok maps\" (without the quotes of course), then it will cache it. \nThere you go.  http://www.imore.com/how-cache-maps-offline-use-google-maps-20-ios\n\nA: The exact method for map caching has not yet, to my understanding been clearly defined, no-one is sure if there is a particular amount of recently accessed mapping space reserved for caching, or if it works in a way similar to other apps and if the systems demands free space it could come along at any time and remove the temporary files in the cache.\nThere may be a formal method for achieving this in the new iOS7, or it may stay the same, i.e. an unknown function.\nAnecdotally I can confirm that caching does work, for relatively large areas of mapping, having left the UK on a trip to DisneyLand Paris without data access - I previously \"travelled\" the route I intended to take at a reasonable zoom level from the point of entering France to the destination, (~5 hours driving) and was able to use GPS tracking overlaid on the cached maps for the entire journey there, and back again 3 days later.  Whether it was necessary to pre-travel the route, and whether the zoom level affects anything I can't be sure (I suspect the maps details, as vectors, didn't care, but naming points and address overlaps may have required it for more detail).\n", "Q: iPhone 5 screen coating Does the iPhone 5 have an oleophobic (fingerprint-resistant) coating? I searched but could only find info on the 3GS.\nThis is my first iPhone, and it seems to smudge very easily. I do tend to have very moist skin, so it could be me, but since its my first one I have no comparison.\nFor now, I've taken to wiping it down every night with a microfiber cloth and a drop of camera/glasses lens cleaner.\nIs this normal to have to clean it so often? \n\nA: Yes, the iPhone 5 (and I believe all iOS devices since the 3GS) have had an oleophobic coating. You can check this on Apple's Tech Specs page:\n\nRetina display \n  4-inch (diagonal) widescreen Multi-Touch display\n  1136-by-640-pixel resolution at 326 ppi\n  800:1 contrast ratio (typical)\n  500 cd/m2 max brightness (typical)\nFingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating on front\n  Support for display of multiple languages and characters simultaneously\n\nI find I don't have to clean my iPhone 4S that often to make the display clear when it's on, but the smudges are definitely noticeable when the display is off. However everyone secretes different amounts of natural oils, so you may just have the bad luck of having smudgy fingers I'm afraid.\nYou may want to be careful about how you clean it however. Using cleaners may actually degrade the oleophobic coating. I find that a microfiber cloth does a good job on its own.

Not like its going to fall off or anything, but it visibly wiggles a little bit, and if I stand the phone up and then quickly turn it upside down, or bump it, I can hear and see it move.\nAs this is my first iPhone, is this normal?\nJust to clarify, it's not mushy, it just seems like the plastic \"outer button\" wiggles around on top of the actual button sensor inside. It certainly has a nice firm click when pressed.\nEdit: certain vibrate patterns also make it rattle very fast, making a buzzing sound. If I put my finger lightly on it, it stops. \nEdit 2: macrumors is full of people with similar beefs. I'm guessing this isn't just me.\n\nA: It sounds normal, if a bit looser than my 4S. If it concerns you, you might be able to get a replacement unit from an Apple Store, though there are no guarantees that it will have better buttons (when I replaced my iPhone 4 two years back for a different issue, the replacement I received had noticeably mushier buttons).\n\nA: There are two takes to this issue - first is you have a one year hardware warranty and if it somehow falls off, you have coverage as long as it doesn't get a huge dent in the same spot making it look like you broke it. Second is to compare yours to other devices around (in a store - with friends). If yours is clearly not the same as the rest, I would presume Apple would repair it at your convenience through AppleCare. You can call, get help online or visit a store for that. They also will be able to help you determine if yours is truly normal or out of the ordinary.\n", "Q: Is it possible to erase sensitive data from a dead Retina MBP SSD? My Retina MacBook Pro has died spectacularly after just over 30 days with what appears to be an SSD fault.

Unfortunately that would seem to be at odds with Amazon's return policy.\nIf Disk Utility can't see the drive, it's unlikely you'll be able to access it to overwrite anything (and overwriting on SSDs can be tricky in any event). Additionally, because the drive in the rMBP is a proprietary form factor, it's difficult to take it out and try to access it from another computer (which might not help any way). There may be adapters made in the future, but I'm not aware of any for sale at the moment.\nThe best preventative measure for this would be to employ some form of whole drive encryption, like Apple's FileVault. That way even if someone is able to read the data off the drive, it won't be useable unless they have your encryption password.\n", "Q: How do I add a service to Terminal's \"New Remote Connection\" window?

I'm looking for a free spreadsheet editor that is simple and lightweight. I don't want to install OpenOffice just to use a some spreadsheets every once in a while.\n\nA: If you just need to view an Excel spreadsheet (.xls or .xlsx extension), you may be surprised to learn that Preview in Mountain Lion (and Lion, possibly?) can open and display them quite competently. You won't be able to edit anything, and I'm sure there may be problems with more advanced functions and macros and such, but if you just want to quickly view or print a spreadsheet, it may do the job.\nNumbers, part of Apple's iWork suite, is neither free nor lightweight. But at US$20, it's quite affordable, particularly in proportion to the functionality it provides, and it certainly feels more lightweight than Open/LibreOffice.\nUpdate 7 Feb 2018 (since this post seems to have got some attention recently for some reason): Numbers is now free in the Mac App Store and has been for some time. If Preview isn't doing the job or you do need to edit the spreadsheet, give it a try.\n\nA: I haven't used it, but pyspread looks promising:\n\nPyspread is a non-traditional spreadsheet application that is based on and written in the programming language Python.\nThe goal of pyspread is to be the most pythonic spreadsheet.\nPyspread expects Python expressions in its grid cells, which makes a spreadsheet specific language obsolete. Each cell returns a Python object that can be accessed from other cells. These objects can represent anything including lists or matrices.\n\n\nA: There is gnumeric which is Gnomes's spreadsheet. It seems quick and lite. However it is designed for GNOME, one of the Unix desktops and does not look OSX like (note this is even using Cocoa GTK not X11)\nAlso you need to install on OSX from source. I used macports sudo port install gnumeric which for Snow Leopard and Lion will install binaries. I suspect fink or homebrew will provide gnumeric as well.\n\nA: I have used Tables, which I can recommend.  The problem I found, however, is that successive versions of your sheet is not saved by Dropbox, because Tables saves its data in a proprietary format, as several files in a folder, and Dropbox will not save versions of folders, only files.  Thus, I couldn't restore previous saved sheets from Dropbox.  (I didn't check the behavior on Time Machine.)

How can I force the Mac to see the Arduino or search for USB devices?\n\nA: I beleive that plugging the arduino into the Mac via USB causes the port to be created automatically as part of the device detection.\nIf it's not showing up, then the OS is not detecting it as a device or the name of the device is no longer waht you expect it to be.\nIt may well be that under Mountain Lion, that the port name has changed, I found a script over on StackOverflow that detects for changes in the /dev folder by comparing a list of all the devices in /dev before and after the device is plugged in.\n", "Q: Move iPhone sync home computer from someone else's to mine I don't have a computer, so I've been using someone else's to do the software upgrades to my iPhone 4. Later this year, I'm getting my own computer. I want to delete my iTunes on his computer and put on my computer (when I get it). I'm scared I will lose my music, movies, and apps. And what if I want to give him some of my songs as a thank you?  I don't want to lose anything.\n\nA: iTunes media can be simply copied to another drive and \nrestored at leisure.\nAs for leaving gifts behind, iTunes' music has been DRM-free for a pretty long time now, so you should just be able to copy the files between machines. Be aware that they are still traceable to you — if your friend starts distributing them, you could get in trouble.\n", "Q: How do I watch the US presidential debates live via AppleTV? I have a 3rd generation Apple TV. Will it be possible to use it to watch the US presidential debates live? I would prefer to do so without using AirPlay, if possible.\nI know that today's (Oct 3, 2012) debate will be streamed live via YouTube. Is the Apple TV's YouTube app capable of showing this? If so, how would I navigate to it?\nIf AirPlay is my only choice, how can I best go about it?

There's no clue at all as to who these emails were to, until I open each and every one.\nI guess it's reassuring to be told that every email that I sent was sent by me and if I was ever to forget my own name while browsing my sent emails folder, it'd be super useful, but it's not very helpful for navigating sent emails.\nIs this normal for Office for Mac 2011? How can I fix this, so that the list shows the recipients' names instead of endlessly reminding me of my own name?\n\nThings I've found while researching this:\n\n\n*\n\n*This can also happen in Outlook for Windows. On Windows, it's easily fixed by resetting the field. That method doesn't work on Mac because the fields can't be selected separately.\n\n*It seems this can also happen in Apple Mail too, and a lot of people seem stumped by this. \n\n*I can't find anything on this specific to Outlook 2011 or Outlook for Mac in general. \n\n\n\nA simple guide on how to fix this would be the best answer, but I'd also welcome any knowledgable thoughts from people with experience of Macs on Microsoft Exchange Server networks on whether this sounds like an Outlook settings issue which I can fix on my machine, or some issue relating to how the Mac gets data from the server and network. The fact that Apple Mail users have encountered the same issue with no apparent fix makes me think the problem might be in the interaction with the network rather than the mail client - but that's way beyond my limited knowledge of these things.\nI don't know whether the local (\"On my computer\") Sent Items folder has the same problem, as it's configured so that no emails except drafts are ever stored in these local folders. Drafts saved locally are listed by recipient as expected.\n\nA: Changing the \"Arrange By\" value from \"Date received\" to \"Date Sent\" on the top of the mail list solved this issue for me.\n\nA: Note that if you are using Outlook 2011 for Mac with Exchange then you may have to right-click/control-click on 'Sent Items->Folder Properties' and then click 'Empty\" to empty your cache before this technique of switching from 'Date Received' to 'Date Sent' will actually work.  You need to have your 'view->Navigation Pane\" selected to see the 'Sent Items' folder you have to click on.  Once I emptied my cache, this worked like a charm.  Thanks!\n\nA: Click on the sent icon between inbox and drafts. \nYou may need to do this each time you access the sent lists. It works for me. Not satisfactory, but achieves the desired result.\n\nA: I am not a Mac power user but I did have to try and solve this same problem.  I have 4 different email accounts I am managing through Outlook 2011 for Mac.  In 3 of the four my sent email list displays who the email was sent to.  I could not figure out how to get the fourth to also display this way.  I solved my problem using the other hints here, however, they were not a perfect solution for me.  I don't know why.\nHere is how I was able to address it.  It's not perfect but it's working for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*First I had to hide the reading pane (View/Reading Pane/Hidden).\n\n*Then I \"right clicked\" in the bar where the column headings are above the list of from emails.\n\n*I unclicked \"From\" and I clicked \"To\".  I then moved the \"To\" column by clicking it and dragging it where I wanted it.  \n\n*I went back and unhid the reading pane.  Unfortunately I can only view it on the bottom.  It was being viewed on the right before but if I view it on the right the sent list goes back to showing my name as the sender and not the recipient name.\n\n\nA: I simply right click on Arranged by then click on custom, then open fields and move To to the list on the right panel if it is not there and then move to the top.\nThe recipient name will appear first in the \"Sent Items\" list, and it will be still arranged by date received.\n\nA: For Outlook 2013, while sent folder is highlighted (clicked on the sent folder), click the view tab, click the view settings tab, click columns, and add \"To\". Move Up \"To\" to the very top and click ok. This should fix. \n\nA: If you have outlook 2010 like me then this is the fix:\nRight click on the Arrange By: button..\nA box will appear and at the bottom of it theres a button, View Settings..\nClick on this and then on the Columns button..\nIn the box on the right where it says Add-> arrange the list and ensure the top 3 items are To, Subject and Sent. They can be arranged by clicking on say To and using the move up and move down button to arrange them. Arrange them until they're in the order above then click OK and OK again. \nThat shoould fix it now.\n\nA: For Outlook 2011 for Mac had to move the reading pane to the bottom, drag the columns to the desired order (\"To\" column moved to the far left, sorted by date sent), then right click on the empty box to the left of the column header to save this as the default arrangement.  Then I could switch back to reading pane on the right and still see the recipient sorted by date.\n\nA: I was able to solve the issue by changing the \"Arrange By\" choice to \"Conversations\".\n\nA: I fixed this by changing the reading pane view from right, to below and then switching back.\n\nA: Change the viewing pane to \"bottom,\" so that you can see all of the different boxes at the top of the email pane.(subject, to, from, etc...) Drag the \"To\" box left of the \"from\" box. Change your view back to whatever you had it as before and your set!\n\n\nA: with outlook not running from run menu enter: outlook.exe /cleanviews\nNote that the space if intentional.\nAfter hours on the phone with MS, this took all of 1 minute to fix the problem\n\nA: Scroll over View → Current View and click Sent To.\n\nA: \ncheck this out\nhow to change settings for showing send item in our-own name \n\nA: You can follow this way :\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to menu\n\n*View\n\n*Current view\n\n*(change setting as) sent to\n\n\nYou get recipient address in your sent items in outlook 2007.\n", "Q: How to get Mac OS 10.8 to see Canon MF4370dn Printer drivers I just got a MacBook Air and wanted it to use my Canon ImageClass MF4370dn printer. The printer is on my network with a static IP. I've no problem getting MacBook to find the printer either via Bonjour or TCP/IP, but I can't get it to give the duplexing options that are built-in. \nMy guess is that the drivers I installed are not being picked up by the OS and instead it's using some generic driver. Any suggestions on how to diagnose and fix?\nTo be clear I'm using the latest Canon Drivers Version 2.4.1 for Mac OS 10.8. The only option that matters at all is having the silly thing duplex. I print up to 1000 pages a month, I need duplexing.\nCheers\nMark Levison\n\nA: Have you installed the latest Mountain Lion ready drivers for the unit?\nWhen you are adding the printer, what options are you using to choose the drivers?\nIf you choose \"Auto Select\" from the \"Use\" drop down that may be your issue.\nIf you choose \"Select Printer Software\" does the Canon software show?\n\n\n\n\nA: Try installing Canon's driver and then set the printer up as a new printer (delete the existing).\nMy Canon iR9065s, with Fiery GX300s, all have to have two-way communication enabled for all the extended functions to work (ie duplexing, staplers, etc); look through the Printer Features, there may be a field to specify (or search for and choose) your printer's IP.\n\nA: Well, first of all, it's not clear what you mean by \"I can't get it to give the duplexing options that are built-in.\"  Duplexing is not necessarily a hardware or driver option on your printer; your printer comes with duplexing as a standard capability and it may be that the printer driver just assumes it.  When you try to print something, is there a checkbox next to the number of copies that says \"Two-Sided\"?  If so, then check it and you should get duplex printing. \nIf you don't get the \"Two-Sided\" option in the print dialog, then try switching drivers.\nAfter you set up your printer, go to System Preferences -> Print & Scan, select your Canon printer and then click \"Options & Supplies...\".  Then click on the \"Driver\" tab.\nAt this point you can try various drivers for the printer by using the \"Print Using\" option menu.  Chose \"Select printer software...\" and search for applicable drivers and try them one by one.\n", "Q: Uploading files to iCloud I am essentially looking for a way to upload files from my iPhone that it does not recognize or can handle with the goal of keeping them for later use on my computer.\nI see lots of ads for Dropbox, Skydrive, etc, that would let me grab files on my iPhone and keep them safe until I can get to a full computer (especially limited-time-availability files that must be downloaded within a timeframe.)\nSo my question is, can't I do this directly with iCloud?\nI'm dealing mostly with files iOS doesn't understand, like proprietary formats, but there may be some images etc. It goes without saying all files must be stored untouched, without any kind of compression being applied.\n\nA: On iOS, the short answer is no.

I use iCloud / iTunes Match and have just discovered that all my lovely songs with explicit lyrics have been replaced by versions with clean ones.  In some instances it's fine, and it doesn't bother me, but other times it just sounds strange.  I'd like to force iTunes Match to find the explicit ones.\nHow can I do it?\nJust to clarify, I'm what has happened is that my iTunes match version of a song is the clean version.   What was uploaded was not.\n\nA: I know this is not what you want to hear, but there is currently no workaround for this problem, and Apple has supposedly been working on this since February.\nWhen you say\n\nJust to clarify, I'm what has happened is that my iTunes match version of a song is the clean version. What was uploaded was not.\n\nit makes it seem (from my understanding of the question) that you have a misconception of the iTunes Match service.  iTunes Match identifies your songs (and the explicit ones) and ties them to your Apple ID so that every device on that Apple ID can have streaming and downloading rights to higher-quality DRM-free (256kbps) songs it matched it to, not the songs that you \"uploaded\". \nAlthough, the fact that it probably isn't really fully uploaded may contribute to your problem.  Apple's \"uploading\" process most likely fingerprints the song by taking a short sample of it rather than the full song.  This means that it is difficult to tell whether the song is clean or explicit, and Apple has acknowledged this.  Some users have even reported iTunes Match giving them the instrumental version of an album.\nThis is a bug in iTunes Match that will require a new method to match songs.  Currently there are no workarounds, but you may phone Apple to fix the songs that you want explicit or complain on their feedback page.\n", "Q: How to download command line tools in xcode 4.5 I just installed xcode 4.5 and need to install the command line tools.

USB3.0 and eSATA dual bay case with two 2T WD drives. My idea was to set them up as separate drives to have 2 backup drives.\nAccidentally I formatted both drives as one. I guess that created something like a RAID0.\nI want to break that, to be able to have the backup system I need. Disk Utility is not helpful, as even though the enclosure is set as Port Multiplier, my Mac will still read the drives as one single drive & volume. Can I separate them with Terminal? \nIt is safe to completely delete them as I still have not copied any information onto them?\nWhen I use diskutil this comes up:\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.3 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            499.4 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n/dev/disk1\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *4.0 TB     disk1\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk1s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Untitled                4.0 TB     disk1s2\n\nSo disk 1 are the two 2T WD.\n\nA: This isn't an issue with OS X itself, it must be the enclosure that's combining the drives. If it was a software RAID, you would see the drives as disk1 and disk2, and the combined volume as disk3. It's possible that the enclosure's software is refusing to destroy the combined volume because it's partitioned and breaking it apart would result in data loss (although in your case obviously not). I suggest deleting the partition on there and trying to separate them in the device-specific software again. If that fails, try physically taking out one of the drives, configuring the other one on its own, and only then adding the second one.\nHave you tried both eSATA and USB modes to see if there is any difference? (assuming you have a spare eSATA port)\nI'm unfortunately not familiar with Hornettek and its devices, so I can't make any more specific suggestions than that.\n", "Q: Why does OS X now think I have two partitions on my external USB drive (plus random connection issue)?

The drive mounted without an issue.\nToday, I went to unmount the drive (via right-click on desktop), and got a message: \"My Passwort\" is a partition on a disk that has 2 partitions. Do you want to eject \"My Passport\" only, or both partitions? ....\nWhen I go to OS X Disk Utility, there is only one partition showing under the drive.\nQ1: any ideas why the drive not showing up every time I connect over the last few months (sometimes it does, other times it didn't)?\nQ2: why does the OS think there are two partitions?\nUpdate 2: Ran diskutil list, got following result:\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *128.0 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         127.2 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n/dev/disk1\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                  Apple_HFS disk0s2                *126.9 GB   disk1\n/dev/disk2\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *32.0 GB    disk2\n   1:                  Apple_HFS mini32gb                32.0 GB    disk2s1\n/dev/disk3\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk3\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk3s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         999.8 GB   disk3s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk3s3\n/dev/disk4\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                 Apple_HFSX My Passport            *999.5 GB   disk4\n\nUpdate 3: As noted in my comment below, I think Mountain Lion may have installed a recovery partition on my external drive, perhaps as a secondary safety measure in case my primary drive completely dies.  If this is the case, it wasn't preferred by me, so I guess take-home lesson is if you want to avoid this, unplug your externals before upgrading.\nFinal Update: I was tired of this message showing up, so I removed the partition with the following command (repeated for the EFI and the boot partition on my external):\ndiskutil eraseVolume \"Free Space\" Blank <DISK_NAME> # WARNING: CAREFUL WHICH VOLUME YOU ERASE!!\n\n\nA: \nQ1: any ideas why the drive not showing up … (sometimes it does, other times it didn't)?\n\nIf the file system is dirty at time of connection of the disk, then the operating system will run fsck_hfs until (hopefully) repairs seem to succeed. During this period the volume will be not mounted, and the OS presents no alert. \n(An alert appears only if, for example, repairs are unsuccessful.)\nIn your case, as CoreStorage is used to encrypt the logical volume that is used by Time Machine, there's also fsck_cs.\nFor your ~1 TB file system that includes backups written by Time Machine: if repairs are necessary, fsck_hfs may take an extraordinarily long time. \nWith Console you can browse\n/var/log/fsck_hfs.log\n\nA: As has been touched on, this seems to be related to Mountain Lion setting itself up for encryption or a restore partition.  I found that by selecting the partition table type in Disk Utility to MBR (yuck) instead of GPT or Apple's, this behavior is avoided and one gets the extra ~200MB usable space.\n", "Q: VPN+Proxy: How to override main network settings I can establish a connection to my university VPN (Cisco IPSec). In addition I have to set a proxy, in this case I have the URL of a .pac file.\nWhen I set this in the VPN-settings, the proxy is not used by Safari or Chrome. How can I set proxy settings for my VPN? I don't want to put this in the main network settings because I only need the proxy for VPN.\n\nA: Under Mavericks this should work fine. Once you have all the security details set in your VPN connection click on Advanced and then Proxies.\nMake sure you select Automatic Proxy Configuration and put the complete URL provided by your IT staff into the URL field. This will almost certainly be different to the proxy config file used by a computer that lives inside your network.\n\nYou don't want to send all traffic over the VPN. Now a web site internal to your network will use the proxy but those outside will not. This is the behaviour you want.\nIt may be useful to actually look at the .pac file. You can do that by entering the URL into the address field of your browser and it should be loaded as a text file.\nThe only case where you want all traffic to go over the VPN is if you are accessing an external web service that your organisation pays for that authenticates through the network - this is usually things offered by the library such as law services or special dictionaries.\n\nA: Setting it in the VPN connection settings works as expected for me.\nMake sure you check the Web Proxy (HTTP) checkbox (or other types of proxies if required) and fill out the correct proxy server details. You probably also need to enable \"Send all traffic over VPN connection\" in the VPN's advanced configuration.\nAfterwards, make sure you apply the settings by clicking on the Apply button.\nAlternatively, you can set up different network locations. You can add a location in the Network preference pane and configure different values for the proxies and other settings on the main network interface. You will have to manually select the appropriate location for switching settings though.\n", "Q: How do I save podcasts to the new Apple podcasts app? This seems like one of those dumb questions, where the answer is, \"that happens automatically, silly!\"   \nBut as far as I can tell, while my podcast subscription shows the last 10 or so episodes, they don't seem to be saved on the device.\nI came to this conclusion when one stopped playing as soon as the buffer ran out after losing signal, and the others all became unplayable (greyed out).\nIs there some way to save episodes on-device int he Apple app?\nIf not, is there an app that can (which also handles subscriptions and works with the device-wide audio UI, so headphone controls work, etc.)?\n\nA: The podcast app is a bit convoluted to know which episodes are unplayed but available for streaming and unplayed and downloaded. I haven't been able to tell visually which is which and am in the habit of turning on AirPlane mode to check which podcasts are actually downloaded then going back and downloading them if needed before leaving Wi-Fi or wireless range.\nThe manual for iOS 6 is actually great for things like this.  (If hit that link your phone, you can save it as a webapp on your home screen for other issues.)\nHere's the relevant section on your question:\n\n• Download an episode so you can listen to it when you’re not connected to Wi-Fi: Tap the \"down-arrow\" icon next to\n  any episode.\n\n\n", "Q: What's the dot in the centre of the red window close button for? When I'm working with certain applications / windows in Mac OS X (I'm using 10.8, although I'm not sure that's relevant), I sometimes see a black dot in the centre of the red window close button. What does this mean? I've seen it most often in Terminal.app, although I think it also happens in other applications too.\nI'm talking about this:\n\nversus the normal state of this:\n\n\nA: I like to think that it's a gentle remainder: \"Something is going on here, and if you close this window, whatever is going on here will be interrupted or lost\".\nOn most apps, it means that the file has been updated (it's \"dirty\"), and that you will receive a prompt asking if you want to save it or not. Talking specifically about the Terminal, it's telling you that there's a task running, and closing the window will kill the task.\n\nA: Specifically, it means that hitting that button will produce a prompt rather than immediately performing the action of closing the window. While this is usually a save dialog, it could be anything requiring further user action.\nIn this sense, it is equivalent to ellipses on the ends of menu entries.\n\nA: In most apps, it's an indicator that there's an open file with unsaved changes (although this is less common now that many apps use OS X auto save). In Terminal it indicates a process is running in the window.\n\nA: If you have the texteditor open and your file isn't saved, then does it appear. Press cmd+save to save.\n", "Q: Problems with the LDAP address book in iOS 6 When configuring an LDAP addressbook with older iOS versions, the phone connects to port 389 for plain text and to port 636 when SSL is enabled. Our secure LDAP service runs on port 636 and before, it was connected. Now, with iOS 6, it no longer connects. It is difficult for me to find out if it is attempting on another port (due to company firewall) but certainly not on 636. Has this been changed? And to what port number?\nIt appears to be not possible to change to another port number by appending :636 to the server name. When doing this, it simply does not connect anything anymore and it just shows a lookup failed. What gives?\nThe LDAP setup is very limited anyway.  There is no option to specify a BIND DN that I can find, and when entering a username and password it sends the username as a BIND DN, which of course fails because it isn't a syntactically correct BIND DN.\nDid anyone get this LDAP client working? With what server? With SSL? What port does it use? Do you have LDAP logs that show how the BIND proceeds?\n\nA: Connecting to port 389 isn't wrong. It's actually \"standards compliant\". See RFC 4511 4.14 StartTLS Operation.\nFrom the Wikipedia page:\n\n\"Servers also often support the non-standard \"LDAPS\" (\"Secure LDAP\", commonly known as \"LDAP over SSL\") protocol on a separate port, by default 636. LDAPS differs from LDAP in two ways: 1) upon connect, the client and server establish TLS before any LDAP messages are transferred (without a StartTLS operation) and 2) the LDAPS connection must be closed upon TLS closure.\n...\nLDAPS was used with LDAPv2, because the StartTLS operation had not yet been defined. The use of LDAPS is deprecated, and modern software should only use StartTLS.\"\n\niOS 6 account setup sends a starttls extended request on port 389 to the indicated server. Upon getting a success response the client (iOS in this case) initiates a tls handshake and if that completes the regular bind, etc. proceeds after that. So, the server must be able to handle both tls and non-tls connections on port 389.\nSetup on the various servers is left as an exercise to the readers ;-)\nSo, iOS 5 and below used the LDAPS connection to port 686 but I guess iOS 6 is now \"modern software\".\nFWIW, I think the startTLS operation is superfluous. Why even bother announcing to the world over an open channel what you are going to be doing inside a secure connection?\n", "Q: No X button on App Store downloaded apps icons in Launchpad \"jiggle mode\" I can't seem to uninstall Mac App Store purchased applications.\nI know that holding down the Option key or clicking and holding on the app icon to make the icons start jiggling so you can uninstall the app by clicking the “X” shown in the corner of icons only works for apps downloaded from the Mac App Store.\nBut I my case, not even apps downloaded from the Mac App Store show the \"X\" button when in jiggle mode.\nHas anyone experienced the same problem ? How did you solved it ?\nUPDATE:\nWhen I delete the app from the Finder, the app's icon remains in the launcher, undeletabe, only it doesn't find the missing app.\n\nA: You don't have to use Launchpad to remove applications. Just deleting the application bundle is still a supported way to remove or uninstall an application. If you also want to remove settings or cache files, delete the directory in ~/Library/Containers/. App Store applications are not allowed to install kernel extensions or preference panes, and any executables for helper processes are inside the application bundle and not in an Application Support directory.\nWhen you remove an application from Launchpad, it is \"uninstalled\" by using uninstalld from Uninstall.framework, but in practice that only removes some support files (like ~/Library/Containers/*/Data/Library/Caches/) addition to the application bundle. Other support files like preferences files or sometimes even sqlite files for user data are not removed. See this question.\n\nA: Try to reset the Launchpad database, it’ll rebuild all your installed apps and sort them by name.\n[ -e ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Dock/*.db ] && rm ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Dock/*.db && killall Dock\n\nUninstalling apps from Mac App Store can always be done through Finder. Cleaning the app settings, caches, and related files requires third party apps such as CleanMyMac, AppCleaner, or AppZapper.\n\nA: You mention holding down the option key - I've never done it this way. You can hold down the mouse button when selecting an icon in the Launchpad to get the icons 'jiggling,' at which point the 'x' should appear. Give that a shot. \n", "Q: How do I automatically connect to a VPN when using Wi-Fi in OS X? The FBI issued a warning regarding hotel Wi-Fi access points, and any other public access point.\nI'd like to make sure my apple device always uses a VPN when using Wi-Fi. That way even if an attacker were to see my data, they would only see an encrypted jumble of bits. Note that this hack can also be applied to HTTPS connections.\nHow do I ensure that OSX automatically uses a VPN when using Wi-Fi?\n\nA: I created a script and launch agent that will automatically connect to a VPN connection when it cannot ping a specific address. It could probably be modified in a way that looks at wifi network whitelist and connects to the VPN if the current wifi is not in that list. As it is right now the vpn will always try to connect if it cannot hit an address that is on the vpn network.\nThe agent calls a shell script every 30 seconds and tries to ping an IP address that is static on the vpn network. If it cannot ping that IP it enables your vpn connection.\nIf you did this through an Apple Script App, the app icon will always be in your dock. I prefer to have this running automatically in the background.\nClone the project below and follow the directions in the readme. The end result is an installer package that will place a launch agent plist file in /Library/LaunchAgents/ and a shell script in /Library/Application Support/melonsmasher/. \nBe sure to edit the shell script(auto-vpn) with your VPN connection name and an IP address that is on the VPN network. You can change the run interval in the plist file(com.melonsmasher.autovpn.plist). \nhttps://github.com/MelonSmasher/OSX-AutoVPN \n\nA: You can not ensure all traffic is protected. You also can't easily block traffic while waiting for VPN to connect, authenticate and secure without having two OS running:\n\n\n*\n\n*How should I use VPN on a Mac to prevent compromise before the VPN starts?\nVPN requires an open Wi-Fi connection to be built before it can reach out over that open/hostile/insecure Wi-Fi connection to secure a limited portion of the traffic leaving your Mac.\nIn other words, you have asked how to only drive on a freeway from your garage without using the driveway or surface streets. Once you're on the freeway, you can stay on it and not get off, but you need the streets to get there in the first place. Worse, VPN only obscures the windows of your car so things that are packed inside have some more expectation of privacy from casual observers.\nOn a practical level, you can set your Wi-Fi to never save a joined network or meticulously set then to never Auto-Join so you have control over each and every untrusted Wi-Fi connection and can ensure no apps are broadcasting before the VPN tunnel is established.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu Server on my MacBook without a CD Trying to install Ubuntu server on my MacBook however the CD drive is not working. All the guides I have seen so far use the bootcamp process (same as for windows) to achieve this.\nI currently have a windows partition on my machine (it was installed with a CD when the drive was ok) which I'm going to remove before I do this. Is it possible to boot using the USB drive from the Mac bootloader using this method? I don't want to remove my Windows partition to find that I NEED a CD to do this.\nI would also prefer to have a separate partition as opposed to any sort of VM setup to do this.\n\nA: The Mac EFI bootloader necessarily supports booting from properly-configured USB drives; I've installed Arch a number of times using the method described on their wiki. If you're in any doubt, make your USB drive before wiping anything and try to boot off it as you would to install just to make sure it'll work.\n", "Q: Can Preview on Mountain Lion make animated pictures from a sequence of PNG? I seem to recall making animated GIF from Preview.app on earlier OS, but can't find the options to make a GIF on the latest version of the app.\nCan I use 10.8 Preview to make animated PNG or GIF?\n\nA: If you hold down alt/option when you click the format dropdown in the export menu, you can still select GIF in Mountain Lion. Once you have done this, you can continue with the normal animated gif creation process:\n\n\n*\n\n*Save your image as a GIF\n\n*Show the sidebar\n\n*Drag additional frames on top of the thumbnail\n\n\nA: Since Lion, the Save/Export to GIF (and some other formats) has been hidden away, you need to option-click the Format menu in the Save dialog to find it.\nI tried to follow these directions for creating animated GIFs, but I wasn't able to add more than one frame. Perhaps with a bit more persistence that will help though, I may have missed something in my quick attempt.\n", "Q: Cocoa emacs -- open in current space? I usually use several different spaces (desktops?) for various different tasks.\nUnfortunately, cocoa emacs 24.1 (9.0), even when using emacsclient (I do a server start in my init.el file) always opens a document or email response in the space emacs was originally started in.\nAquamacs seems better behaved in this respect, but I prefer cocoa emacs.\nIs there a way to change this behavior?\nBest,\nJRV\n\nA: I've gotten at least a usable approach, tho not perfect.\nThe best I could do is the following:\n1) don't ever use emacsclient and take start server out of init.el\n2) in mission control preferences, uncheck the boxes for \"when switching to an application...\" and \"group windows by application\"\nIf I am editing more than one doc, in different desktops I end up with more than one instance of emacs running,  but I can live with this.  Also, the startup seems to be fast enough for me without emacsclient.\nIt doesn't look like cocoa emacs is impemented as a document based cocoa app.  Is that the case?\nSeems like Macvim handles the multiple document without multiple instance case more gracefully.\nBest regards.\nJRV\n", "Q: Set Specific Podcasts to Show as TV Shows in iTunes, using AppleScript I'm using on online TV recorder to record TV shows.

I have different screen resolutions I need for various situations, for example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac Retina while mobile: 1680x1050\n\n*Mac Retina + Thunderbolt: default (equal scaling on both monitors)\n\n*(optional) Mac Retina 1680x1050 + Thunderbolt: default (equal scaling on both monitors)\n\nA: I'm not 100% sure this is what you're after, but it's possible to check the \"Show displays in menu bar\" option in System Preferences -> Displays. This adds a menubar item which allows you to quickly switch between recently used resolutions\n\nAlternatively, maybe something like Display Maestro or SwitchResX would help? These both seem to have the ability to display and switch between recently used resolutions.\n\nA: There is also QuickRes. You can try it.\n\nQuickRes is the quickest and easiest way to switch between screen resolutions on the MacBook Pro with Retina Display. With just a single click or simple key-combo you can give your Mac more screen space than ever before with sizes ranging up to 3840x2400!\n\n\nA: In my experience, just plugging in a monitor I've previously used will revert to the Display settings I last used with that monitor. So rather than needing to switch between recent display settings, I just need to plug it in and it switches automatically.\nWhen I plug my computer into the DVI projector at work, it switches to 720p as the last-used setting with that projector, but when I use the external monitor on my desk, it uses the native 1680x1050 resolution.\nI don't know if this works with VGA monitors, since I don't think the computer can actually identify the monitor(?), but would assume this generally applies to digital connections (DVI, HDMI, Thunderbolt).\n", "Q: Grocery/List app for iOS with decent web application I am looking for a descent iOS application that will allow me to sync my grocery list between my wife and I. I would like a solution that has a web application that we can use to enter all of our grocery items. I have tried many apps but there are so many out there now I may have missed some. The main features I am looking for are ... \n\n\n*\n\n*Synchronization between devices and web app\n\n*Push notification when list updated from device or web app\n\n*Photo support (so I can get the correct item)\n\n*Ordering items on a per store basis (Walmart has items organized differently than Stop-n-Shop)\n\n*List items by category (Breads, Deli, Dairy, etc ..)\n\n*Multiple lists and stores\n\n\nHere is a list of apps I have tried that may be of use to others.\nGrocery Gadget - Nice UI on iOS but the web app is abysmal in speed. It takes about 10 seconds to update/delete a single item from the list. Web app freezes regularly.\nGrocery IQ - No photo support; Web App looks nice though. Adds \"sponsored items\" to my list without asking.\nEasy Shop Pro - No Web App; No Photo support\nShopping List - No Web App; No Photo support\nSplash Shopper - Local WiFI sync only\nShopper Pro - Email based sync. No Push notification. Web app has major bugs.\nBuy me a Pie! - Cannot categorize items in web app. Web app is very \"bare bones\"\nI certainly don't mind paying for a good application so it does not need to be free. \n\nA: Take a look at Catch. It was recently one of the featured apps on the App Store. It's not designed for shopping per se, but it can do everything but #2. Instead of a push notification, it silently updates. It does do notifications, but those are based on timed events.\nIt supports spaces and hashtags for categorization, which I think would fit your needs.\nAlso, it has a feature to share lists between people. If Catch doesn't cut it, you might want to look at Wunderlist also. Different, but many of the same features.\nAnd, no, I have no connection to them, just like the app.\nUpdate/Edit: Catch is no longer available. Wunderlist is better than ever, and Shopit the app is currently very hot (it's on the top free apps list in the U.S.) which does everything you asked about except sharing.\n\nA: Take a look at Remember the Milk, it's a cross-platform web and native app platform that is meant to manage task lists such as groceries.\n", "Q: How does Apple's Podcasts app's Auto-Download of podcasts work? 1) In the Apple Podcasts app, one of the subscription options is Keep Most Recent Episode.  Is this the most recent unplayed episode or the most recent episode in the feed? If the former, is there any way to get the latter behavior? \nI subscribe to a couple daily news podcasts that I may not want to listen to every day. I just want the latest episode to be downloaded to my phone, so on the chance I want to listen, I'm listening to today's news and not last week's.\n2) How often does it check for new episodes?  How do I ensure that it does check?  Sometimes I turn my phone off, and when I turn it back on again, the Podcasts app won't check for new ones until the next time I open it.  This seems weird; I would expect it to work more like the calendar which is running in the background syncing silently.\n3) If 1 & 2 are not possible, is there an alternative app you can recommend?  Can I use the iTunes app without syncing to my computer, for example?\n\nA: I'm not sure about your first question. I suspect that Keep Most Recent refers to the most recent in the feed, but I don't know for sure.\nAs for the second question, the Podcasts app adheres to Apple's rules about background/scheduled downloading. That is to say, it only checks for new episodes when the app is open. This is a power and performance optimization decision, and for better or worse, no third party apps are allowed to schedule background checks either (although in theory they could on a jailbroken device, but I don't know if there are any apps that do this). Apps can trigger background downloads using geofencing however (the same way Reminders can trigger an alert when you leave your office).\nThere are several other podcast apps on the App Store, which have finer grained controls for subscriptions, and so forth. Downcast and Instacast are likely the two most popular ones.\n", "Q: Why does \"Recent Places\" not include most recent places I have seen others asking about this but have never seen a good answer.\nThe idea of Recent Places or Recent Items is a good one, and is found in many contexts, operating systems, and softwares. However, in OS X it seems that usually a recently accessed file or folder is not in the list. \nI have found this an annoyance since converting to Mac in February 2009. The problem has persisted through Leopard, Snow Leopard, Lion, and Mountain Lion.\nWhy is this so? It is really hit or miss whether something is there.\nAs a workaround, it would be nice to know what you have to do to \"get something in the list.\" As an example, does it have to be done in Finder? Or does it have to change the metadata? Or what?\nIf I knew the workaround, it might be easy enough to always \"do that thing\" so that the expected entry in Recent Places is created.\n\nA: To make something appear in the \"Recent Places\" dropdown (I've had the same annoying problem), it seems like you need to travel to that particular folder twice before it appears there. If you do that, you'll see it appears there. I guess the obvious reason is that Apple assumes if you go to a folder recently only once, that isn't enough to store it. But if you go there twice, that means you should have that stored. Makes sense, but there has to be some kind of workaround, because in a lot of real-life situations, this kind of functionality is really inconvenient. Sometimes I go to a folder twice if I know I will want to access it quickly soon. I'm sure there are solutions out there.\n", "Q: Emptying Camera Roll on iOS 6 I'm having a few issues with syncing pictures, which I haven't really nailed down enough to ask a question about exactly, but the rough version of it is that I think that my Mac running iPhoto has already downloaded most of my photos (but not any of my videos) using photostream before I get a chance to sync using a cable, and this results in the following behaviour:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhoto finds a lot of duplicates when I choose the iPhone device and choose to sync\n\n*iPhoto offers a chance to remove photos from your device that you just synced, but because it did not sync these particular photo duplicates over the cable because they already existed via photostream it does not offer to remove them\n\n*So it keeps finding the duplicates on my phone, and I have no easy way of removing the photos en-masse.\n\n\nNow, the above is just background really, but any thoughts of a workflow for Photostream and cable syncing in tandem would be appreciated.\nThe issue for which I am raising this question is to do with my camera roll, and how to empty it on my phone.  I am aware that I can cable it up and use Image Capture to delete them all, but I was trying to find a more elegant solution.  I am aware also that I can individually (or in chunks by tapping on each and every one) remove them directly, but that's dumb.  So when I found this section in Settings > General > Usage > Photos and Camera I was pleased to see I could left swipe the items to delete the contents:\n\nYay!  Well, sadly not, as it appears to do nothing at all.  I have deleted the camera roll several times, and every time I go back it's right there, and indeed all my photos are still available.  Is this supposed to work, am I doing something wrong, or have I got some weird issue because it works for you?\nUsing the same method to remove podcasts from within the podcasts app works fine.\n\nA: The easiest way to delete photos is to use Image Capture. That's how I've been doing it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iPhone to your mac via cable.\n\n*Run Image Capture. It should bring up the pictures on your phone.\n\n*Select all images (or just specific ones).\n\n*Click the Delete button. \n\n\nA: Yes, iPhoto says there are duplicates because of the photo stream. But there IS a button to erase all remaining (not sychronized because of duplicates) photos from the iPhone directly within iPhoto after you did an import:\n\nThat does not solve your desire for an elegant wireless way. I simply think it's not possible to delete all photos at once directly from the iPhone (with built-in apps). Of course you could delete them by marking them one by one in the Photo apps using the \"Edit\"-Button.\n\nA: If Image Capture app won't help, here's a solution which must work for 99%\nAfter giving up on studying various sources on this topics and trying to delete it from my iPhone 3GS (iOS 6.1.6), I gave a last chance and Vualá!\nA quick tip: simply clean your DCIM folder via iFunBox. If not familiar with this keywords, read below:\nStep by step Solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*backup your iPhone..  just in case, as never know...\n\n*download latest iFunBox;\n\n*install it on your PC, run it, connect your iPhone via USB;\n\n*Click on GENERAL STORAGE, then get back to Media folder:\n\n\n\n\n\n*Open DCIM folder:\n\n\n\n\n\n*Select ALL folders in DCIM, right-click for sub-menu, choose DELETE:\n\n\n\n\n\n*Wait until is done, disconnect you iPhone, go to Settings ... Usage, scroll down until you'll find Photos and tap on it. At last, you must see a 0 bytes of taken space:\n\n\n\nEnjoy. \n\nA: I can recomend iTools app. Select All pictures and Delete. Thats all.\n\nA: Edit 2 (Summary): I totally agree with the original post that the left swiping + Delete seems to do nothing at all; the images and thumbnails are still stored on the iPad after tapping Delete. In my case I had a huge thumbnail database on the iPad / Camera roll after deleting the original images via USB. I located the thumbnail database files via USB and deleted them manually, solving my problem. In the following section I explain how I did it.\n\nI'm having the same problem, but not through using Photostream. The iPad 3 / iOS 6 reports a 727 MB large camera roll, even when it's empty, and left swiping and tapping delete does nothing to reduce this number. I have been taking a lot of pics, and have exported them to a Linux computer, and then deleted them (via USB / the afs protocol). A huge thumbnail database was still on the iPad.\nEdit 1: When mounting the iPad in Linux, I got two afs:// shares. I found three database files under one of them in the subfolder PhotoData/Thumbnails. The files were named (and sized) - presumably - according to the resolution of the images within them (don't remember exactly, but something like 100x100blablabla.ithumbs). I deleted three such files, but left the fourth alone (an XML manifest with a different naming scheme). When re-entering the Photos app on the iPad, all thumbs were gone from all albums including the Camera roll, and under Settings -> General -> Usage the Photos app had flown down the list, now being about 10-20 MB. When tapping an empty thumbnail, the original (large sized) images showed up. I proceeded to do some testing by taking new pictures and verifying that they turned up in Camera roll with their thumbs correctly displayed, and they did.\n", "Q: Can i add an animation from crazy talk 7 into a whole keynote presentation? I want to do a presentation with keynote and with Crazy talk 7, but i would like to know how to lay the animation over the entire keynote presentation, how can i do that?\n\nA: With CrazyTalk7 you can output your creations as videos or images in different sizes, resolutions and file formats. You can convert your work to an AVI file in DVD, HD, iPad and iPhone quality. You may also convert it into sequenced image (BMP/JPG/TGA/PNG) files to broadcast on a web server. \nIf you wish to import a photo or movie into Keynote the most convenient way to do it is by dragging the file directly into Keynote. Just drop it onto you slide.\nYou can also import media by choosing Insert > Choose from the top menu.\nHope this helps answer your question.\nIf you have any further questions please contact Reallusion Customer Support directly using the link below.

Anything that could perform a hardware scan (bad sectors?) built into Mountain Lion or available for free off the 'net?\n\nA: You can try Disk Utility. Click Verify Disk to see if the disk is faulty.\nMy last HD failed after a year of use. The past month has made the computer really slow. Most HD manufacturer gives out a replacement if it fails within 3 years though.\n\nA: http://www.titanium.free.fr has a free utility called Onyx which runs cron jobs, toggles hidden prefs and has many other uses but most importantly in this case runs a SMART test on the HD automatically at startup. I have used it for several years and recommend it. It also has a section for UNIX man info as well.

Once upon a time I used Corel Draw to edit vector graphics. Now I'm looking at using Sketch. I previously converted all my old CDR files to PDF but Sketch doesn't seem to like to open PDFs containing vector graphics. Is there a free command-line program I can use to convert PDF to SVG?\n\nA: My own research has so far led me thus:\nThere is a command line tool called PDF2SVG, which would be ideal, but it requires you to build it yourself and install all the necessary dependencies, including two libraries, Cairo and Poppler. (I tried installing Cairo, but it wanted pkg-config, which in turn reported that some other library was missing....)\nThe only decent tool I've found is MuPDF, which contains a CLI utility called mutool. You still have to build it yourself, but it is at least self-contained.\nDownload the source code;\nunzip the package,\nin the Terminal type cd (followed by a space),\nthen drag the unzipped folder from the Finder into the Terminal window.\nPress Enter.\nThen type sudo make prefix=/usr/local install and enter your password.\nYou can then delete the source code.\nThen you can convert PDFs to SVG using such commands as:\nmutool convert -F svg -o filename.svg inputfile\n\nIf there are multiple pages, the page number will be appended to each filename. Either the -F flag or the -o flag is optional. But not both.\nMuPDF is made by the people who make GhostScript, so should be reliable.\n\nA: Turns out Inkscape has a command line mode. I added this to .bash_profile:\nalias inkscape=\"/Applications/Inkscape.app/Contents/Resources/bin/inkscape\"\n\nand now this command converts from PDF to SVG:\ninkscape Logo.pdf --export-plain-svg=Logo.svg\n\nUnfortunately, the current version of Sketch has very rudimentary SVG import capabilities and can't correctly read any of the files I've made even though they display fine in Opera and OmniWeb. The company says future versions will do better.\n\nA: Answer for 2020 (an update was asked for):\nPDF rendering is hard to do well. There are not a lot of tools for it.\n\n*\n\n*Inkscape remains a good, free option and is now available as a first-class Mac App for OS X 10.11-10.15 and it has a command-line interface\n\n*There are various packages for NodeJS that can do it, most of which leverage PDF.js and are not well-maintained, but installing NodeJS just for this purpose would be overkill\n\n*There are commercial packages like BuildVu if you can afford a 4-figure annual license fee\n\n*There are lots of cloud-based converters (both free and paid) which have command line clients or which you could script with curl, but that is not my idea of a command line program to do conversion\n\n\nA: ImageMagick has a command line tool called convert which does all sorts of things in addition to converting file formats.  There are lots of options, but the simplest way would be to do\nconvert file.pdf file.svg\n\nThat might not give the best quality, so you may need some flags such as -density - check the man pages.  ImageMagick can likely be installed through fink/macports/homebrew.\n", "Q: Enabling Apache in Mac OS X Mountaion Lion This is my first Mac, it's Mountain Lion, and I know how to enable Apache through Preferences -> Sharing -> Web Sharing, but how the hell do I do it in Mountain Lion?\nI find that that button no longer exists, so what's the Ternimal command to turn it on manually?\n\nA: To make it permanent you can do this:\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist\n\nthe '-w' option sets it to restart the service on rebooting etc.\n\nA: To start apache\nsudo apachectl start\nThis will give you a basic Apache server with a DocumentRoot at  /Library/WebServer/Documents/\nYou can enable things like PHP and virtualhosts by making use of the configuration file, which must be edited as root:\n/etc/apache2/httpd.conf\nRestart the apache server (like after editing the config file) with\nsudo apachectl graceful\nStop the apache server\nsudo apachectl graceful-stop\nI believe in order to use user directories (like allowing ~/Sites/ to be accessed at http://localhost/~username/) or to get httpd to run at startup, you will need to do a little tweaking.

It's pointing to a Pages template file rather than its MP3 file: file:///Users/administrator/Music/Broken%20Social%20Scene/You%20Forgot%20It%20In%20People/11%20Lover's%20Spit.mp3. \nNot even close to what it should be!\nI've already tried the following things, to no avail:\n\n\n*\n\n*Re-add Music folder to library — Unfortunately, this leaves me with duplicated entries. The broken item still remains, with play counts, ratings, etc. and the new item is started over from scratch. Not really ideal.\n\n*TuneUp and Rinse — I tried running it through the trials of TuneUp and Rinse, which didn't seem to catch on to the problem I was having.\n\n\nMy last resort idea is to setup a script that parses the XML and checks for non MP3 Location strings. When one is found, attempt to re-construct the filename based on iTunes's automatic filenaming convention (e.g. Lover's Spit above becomes 11%20-%20Lover's%20Spit.mp3. This likely would get me 90-95% there. The remaining items could be manually fixed.\nOf course, that would involve a lot of scripting time and trial and error. I'm hoping there's a simpler solution to my problem.\nIdeas?\n\nA: I would suggest a combination of your first and last ideas. You could re-add your Music folder to your library, and then use a script to change the location of the old entries (correct metadata) to the new entries (correct locations).\nPseudocode rough draft:\nfor every song in the XML file (seek)\n  search the rest of the XML file for other songs of the same name\n  if only one is found (found)\n    log seek's name to file1\n    if found is newer than seek\n      copy found's Location value to seek\n      remove found\n    else\n      copy seek's Location value to found\n      remove seek\n  else if more than one is found\n    log seek's name to file2 (for manual editing)\n  else (no others are found)\n    log seek's name to file3\n\nThis script design would assuredly be quite inefficient, but it would fix most problems itself, and you would (er, should) only have to review the songs with more than 2 duplicate versions.\nSee this answer for details on how to make these XML changes take effect on your library.\n\nA: Try moving all the files back to a case-insensitve drive.\nThis stumped me forever until I figured out the problem.  It wasn't until I started to manually correct the problem files that I noticed a common theme in the problem files.  \"of\" vs \"Of\".\nLast year I migrated all my music from a case insensitive drive to a case sensitive drive.  Suddenly many of my songs would not play and point to completely different files on the drive, be it jpg images or whatever.\nI had to write a script to compare the itunes xml to what was on the drive and figure out all the discrepancies.  Regardless...it is a bit of a time consuming nightmare to fix.\nIf you delete files out of your iTunes library and re-add them, DO NOT click \"move to trash\" otherwise it will delete whatever non-music file iTunes is pointing at. (!)\n\nA: And for you humans out there that don't write code...\nThis happens with movies as well.  Ex.  I play Lord of the Rings, I get The Martian.  Has gotten buggier and buggier since (not too soon) Tim Cook took over.  So now we pay Apple prices for Windows performance.  Thanks Obama...I digress.\nQuick trick works for me.  Using the example above, intentionally play the movie that unintentionally ruins date night.  I.e.The Martian.  Close it.  Play the movie you want.  I.e. LOTR...and you, Sam and Frodo are reunited.  This works for me, and the other 95% of people that don't write scripts to listen to a song or play a movie.\n\nA: I'm getting the same error; for some reason, iTunes send me to a fonts folder when I ask it to \"Show in Finder\" the location of the song file.\nI started experiencing this a few weeks ago when I attempted to sync an iPod before the external drive on which I store my iTunes library was ready.\nThe wrong files to which iTunes directs me are all on a different external drive (which I presume was connected when I attempted that unsuccessful sync).\nI have no idea how to fix this.\n", "Q: How to transfer a purchased app from iPhone to iPad? I have bought Talking Ben app on my iPhone. I also have an iPad, how can I transfer this purchase onto my iPad?\nI already tried using my iTunes. But i dont know how to do it. Also both my iPad and and iPhone use the same Apple ID.\n\nA: There are (at least) two ways to accomplish that\nvia iTunes\n\n\n*\n\n*sync your iPhone with iTunes. This will copy Talking Ben to iTunes\n\n*connect your iPad to the same computer\n\n*click on the iPad name in in the sidebar and go to the the Apps section\n\n*check the mark in front of Talking Ben\n\n*sync the iPad -> Talking Ben gets copied to the iPad\n\n\ndirectly on the iPad\n\n\n*\n\n*open the App Store app\n\n*tap on Purchases (or just search for Talking Ben again)\n\n*install\n\n\nThe iPad option only works if you are logged into the App Store with the same Apple ID on both devices, the iTunes option also works with different IDs.\n\nAs pointed out in the comment certain applications provide a specific iPad version which must be bought separately. You can still install the iPhone version in the iPad as well but will have to accept the usual restrictions concerning screen size unless the app was specifically coded to work both on iPad and iPhone.\n", "Q: How can I skip the Trash when deleting a file? I frequently connect different external USB hard drives and flash drives to my computer and I would like to facilitate deleting files and regaining disk space from them.\nIf I simply delete the file, it will be kept in a hidden trash folder on the external drive until I empty the Trash. This also forces me to empty my local trash simultaneously while the external disk is still connected to regain the disk space, which is undesirable.\nAt the moment, the only other \"solution\" I've found is moving the file to the internal hard drive and then trash it. This is not optimal because I waste time moving files from one drive to another (I regularly deal with 20GB+ VMs).\nHow can I permanently delete a file from an external drive, bypassing the trash?\n\nA: You can create an Automator service or application to facilitate executing the rm shell commando, which will permanently delete files or folders and skip the trash.\nFor example, start with creating a new Service in Automator.app.\n\n\n*\n\n*Select files or folders as input, you probably also want to limit the availability of this service to the Finder app.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Optionally, but highly recommended, first add an Ask for Confirmation step to the workflow.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Finally, add the Run Shell Script step to the workflow. Make sure to pass input as arguments. Then you can put in the following script:\nfor f in \"$@\"\ndo\n    rm -rf \"$f\"\ndone\n\n\nAs mentioned by @Thecafremo, you can also add a -P parameter to rm for additional security while deleting. For an extra nicety, you can add some audible feedback by adding the following command at the end of the shell script:\nafplay \"/System/Library/Components/CoreAudio.component/Contents/SharedSupport/SystemSounds/finder/empty trash.aif\"\n\nSave your service, and it should be ready to use in Finder from the Services menu in the menu bar. The service will also appear at the bottom of the menu you get by right clicking on files in Finder, although to make it appear there you may have to run it once from the Finder > Services menu first.  You can also configure a keyboard shortcut to your service in the Keyboard preference pane of System Preferences.\n\n\nInstead of creating a service, you could similarly create an application in Automator, which you can pin in the Dock so you can drag files to it.\n\nA: Have you consider to use Trash Without from the Mac App Store?\n\nA: How about something like Trash X. The description says:\n\nYou can use it to instantly delete or shred file and folders without\n  sending them to the trash. You can use it to empty or shred trash only\n  on selected disks. And of course, you can use it just like the\n  trashcan you've always had on your desktop.\n\n\nA: The following trick works with OS X El Capitan. I got the tip from here.\nSelect your file(s) in Finder. Go to the File menu, and when you press the alt/option key, you will see the \"Move to Trash\" option change to \"Delete Immediately...\".\n\nA: ⌘ Command⌥ Option⌫ Delete will permanently delete files, with a confirmation dialog warning that this action can not be undone. ⌘Command⌫ Delete simply moves files to Trash, without confirmation. \nTip: whenever you want Mac app to do the same action but a little differently, try doing it with ⌥ Option button pressed.\n\nA: And option could be Terminal command rm, with the -P option if you want some added security:\n\n[Option -P will] \n  Overwrite regular files before deleting them.  Files are overwritten three times, first with the byte pattern 0xff, then 0x00, and then 0xff again, before they are deleted.\n\nTo do so, just:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Terminal.app (Found in /Applications/Utilities).\n\n*Type rm -P  and drag the file to the terminal window. Then hit Enter.\n\n\nA: Background information can be found in the paper Secure Deletion of Data from Magnetic and Solid-State Memory\nAn implementation of the knowledge gained from this paper is GNU shred. This tool can be installed as part of coreutils from MacPorts.\n\nA: There is a free tool called Skip The Trash, which not only allows regular deletion, but authenticated deletion as an admin. It adds context menus to the Finder:\nhttp://www.blazingtools.com/delete_without_trash_mac.html\n\nA: As of El Capitan 10.11.6 this is now possible without using Terminal.app: select the files you want rid of, right click and pick \"Delete Immediately…\".\n", "Q: Choosing between opening a file with primary or secondary program with a shortcut I know how to change default program to certain type of files, but I've been running to situations where I could use 2 defaults. \nLets take .html files for example.

You can, however, manually forward texts: open the Messages app, open a thread, tap Edit, tap the check boxes for the texts to forward, tap Forward, then enter the recipient. \nUnless the user deletes the messages, they aren't deleted automatically. As a result, they are saved in a way. However, it is very easy for the user to delete the messages, and once deleted, there is no way to recover them.\n\nA: PhoneView http://www.ecamm.com/mac/phoneview/ is a Mac app to\nlet you save out your text messages as PDF files.  \n", "Q: How do I launch shell applications after changing shell to MacPorts bash?

Internet access is almost unusable, and sometimes I can't even make or receive calls.\nI'm in Italy, my carrier is TIM; however, this is not a carrier problem, and is unrelated to the actual place I'm in: I'm having these signal troubles in the very same places where I had full signal strength before the IOS upgrade.\nI've been searching around for a while, and looks like this is quite a common problem; various solutions have been proposed (including downgrading to IOS 5 on the assumption that this is caused by some bug in IOS 6), but no agreement has been reached about how to actually solve it.\nHow to fix this?\n\nA: The only solution that actually worked was a full factory reset:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a backup of your iPhone using iTunes.\n\n*Using iTunes, perform a full reset of the iPhone.\n\n*After the iPhone reboots, disconnect it from iTunes and go through the initial setup.\n\n*Connect the iPhone back to iTunes.\n\n*When asked by iTunes, choose to restore the backup.\n\n*If applications are missing after the restore, perform a full sync to have them re-installed.\n\n\nI also called Apple support, and they confirmed this is a known and common problem when upgrading to IOS 6, and a full reset is the only way to permanently solve it.\n", "Q: Have Mountain Lion remember different monitor (not window) arrangement I'm using 10.8 on a new retina MacBook.\nAt home, my external monitor (an HP) is located to the left of the laptop stand.

Is there a way to prevent the iPhone's mail app from marking messages as read automatically when I view them?\nThunderbird on my computer has a way to do this and I find it useful.\n\nA: There is no setting that will not mark the email, in the Mail app, as read. So, the short answer to your questions is No. \nA workaround that may, or may not, appeal to you, but would involve one more step would be to tap the Edit button in the upper-right corner above the list of email, check mark the ones you want to be kept unread, then tap \"Mark\", then \"Mark as Unread\". Again, this option may not work for you, but is probably the fastest way to mark multiple emails as Unread.\n", "Q: iPhone Facebook integration overrides local contact names IOS 6 on iPhone 4.\nI enabled Facebook integration and it correctly associated many contacts in the address book with Facebook friends. There were some errors (a contact got linked to a person I don't know which not only is not on my friend list, but with which I never even exchanged a single message), but I corrected them manually.\nNow, sometimes a person will not use his/her real name on Facebook, or maybe will put a nickname as middle name. Or maybe I decided to label the contact in some different way than the person's real name. Anyway, the point is: sometimes, address book names and Facebook names differs. In all these cases, when the iPhone linked a contact with a Facebook friend, or when I manually linked them, it always displayed the names from Facebook instead of the ones I had been using in the address book. I corrected this, too.\nBut, here's the problem: when I make such a correction, looks like it works... but then, after a while (even 1-2 days), it reverts back to using the Facebook names instead of the ones I put in.\nIs there any way to permanently tell the iPhone \"I want this contact to be called such-and-such and please don't mess with it\"?\n\nA: Just to give post-iOS 7 input, the contact situation is still problematic. If a Facebook friend changes their last name to something else (or uses a joke name), it will cause sync problems with your contacts.\nYou can “Link” contact cards together (edit one contact, go to the bottom, hit Link Contacts, and connect it to another card). This usually keeps the contact info connected even if the name on Facebook changes, but in my own, personal experience, contact sync errors happen when it tries to update from Facebook when you have a poor cell/wifi connection. But that may be unrelated.\nA side note: I found a bug in iOS 7 though; when you link personal cards (i.e. your information from Facebook to your personal card that Siri uses), deleting duplicate or outdated fields will cause the Contacts or Phone app to crash. So if you link your own contact cards together and have to make an edit, you have to unlink them first.\n\nA: There is a setting in the facebook app you can disable to oeverride contact names.\n", "Q: Is the Photos app destructive? I noticed the iPhone's photos app lets you uncrop images even after they've been saved.\nDoes this mean it uses sidecar files to store the actual edits? Is it non-destructive on JPEGs?\n\nA: That's correct. So long as the original photo remains in the Camera Roll, Photos is able to undo edits. However, if you send it to another iPhone user, they will only have the edit itself, not the original, so they cannot revert back. Also, if the image is deleted from Photos, you cannot recover the original.\nNote: Photo Stream does not support this. Any edits made to an image in Photo Stream will be saved to Camera Roll. Likewise, and edits made in Camera Roll that are uploaded to Photo Stream, Photo Stream will only have the revision and will not be able to revert.\n", "Q: Change all the .txt files to .md files in a certain folder Is there a Terminal command or something like that to batch rename files in a certain folder?

I am comfortable using the Terminal, being a developer, so don't hold back on solutions. :)\nThanks in advance for any help you can provide.\n\nA: You can do the following in Terminal:\n\nfind . -iname \"*.txt\" -exec bash -c 'mv \"$0\" \"${0%\\.txt}.md\"' {} \\;\n\nThis will recursively rename all .txt files in the current directory to .md.\n\nA: Even if you do not use zsh as your default shell, you can still use zmv in a temporary shell:\nzsh -c 'autoload zmv;$0 $@' zmv -w '*.txt' '$1.md'\n\nRecursively:\nzsh -c 'autoload zmv;$0 $@' zmv -w '**/*.txt' '$1$2.md'\n\nNote: The -n option is handy for testing.\nzmv is described in the zshcontrib manpage, and the full glob syntax is described in the zshexpn manpage in the “Filename Generation” section.\n", "Q: How to suppress the \"Run or quit\" dialog when launching an applescript? I am having the same basic problem as in this question:\nAppleScript app started prompting to run or quit. How can I disable this?\nHowever, in my case the \"Startup Screen\" option is definitely NOT checked, and re-saving the script will not make any difference.\nThe issue here appears to be that I am launching my script via a keyboard shortcut of CTRL-SHIFT-I and it's having the Control key as part of the launching shortcut, that is the problem.\nI can change the shortcut, but I have a whole system in place with how I launch things and this breaks that system.  I would really REALLY prefer not to have to change my shortcut for this one silly reason.\nIs there any way to force-suppress this dialog in the applescript itself?  Or any other way to cause this dialog to not appear?\n\nA: Holding control only shows those dialogs if a script is saved as an application. Couldn't you just save the script as scpt or applescript?\n\nA: I solved this the only way I could make work.  I created a simple Automator Application that runs my applescript.  Then I assigned that app to a hotkey, and it works fine.  The problem appears to only be that actually running an Applescript that has been compiled directly as an application, means you can't trigger it with any shortcut containing the control key.\n", "Q: Remove shift key augmentation for Mission Control animation I recently upgraded to Mountain Lion and all of a sudden my key bindings for Sublime Text 2 multi-selection editing are no longer working. Specifically, I had key bindings set up for Ctrl+Shift+Up/Down arrow.\nNow Mission Control has taken over that key binding. How can I remove the Shift key augmentation (that causes the transition to be slower) for the shortcut?\n\nA: You can disable the Ctrl+Up/Down shortcuts for Mission Control in the Keyboard preference pane. Just untick both \"Mission Control\" and \"Application windows\". This will also prevent the Ctrl+Shift+Up/Down key bindings, where the Shift key acts as a modifier to slow down the animation, as you have noticed.\n\nDisabling these shortcuts will allow you to use it again in Sublime Text 2 or other applications.\n\nA: You can disable the keyboard shortcuts for slow-motion effects by following these instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal.\n\n*Open the plist file in your user's library preferences folder that contains the setting by typing open ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist and hit return.\n\n*A window similar to this will open in Xcode:\n\n\n\n*For items 34, 35, and 37, set enabled to NO.\n\n*Close the file, click Save if prompted, and restart your system.\n\n*Enjoy.\nNote: 34 and 35 may not be present in the plist if you have never opened the Mission Control preferences pane and changed the \"Mission Control\" or \"Application windows\" settings.

Google is set as the default account on the iPhone. I have nearly instantaneous updates from the iPhone to Google. But I've waited a couple of hours and have yet to see a new contact and an update to an existing contact that I made via web Gmail show up on the phone. Is there a setting I'm missing? Per Google help, I already checked that the Account is on, and that I am using SSL. I'm on iOS 6.0.\nWell, seven hours later I have the updates on the phone. Is this the norm?\n\nA: My understanding is that CardDAV does not push changes from server to clients, but rather requires that clients poll the server. Perhaps you have polling turned off?\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Settings.\n\n*Select Mail, Contacts, Calendars.\n\n*Select Fetch New Data.\n\n*Under the Fetch heading, is Manually selected? If so, then your phone is not automatically checking for updates.\n\n*Select Advanced.\n\n*Find your Google CardDAV account in this list. Is it set to Fetch or Manual? If the latter, then your phone is not automatically checking for updates.\n\n\nA: This is not normal. I just set up Google CardDav on my iPhone 4. I was adding a contact to Google that was already in my iPhone. While I was reading the info off my phone and typing it into Gmail, it showed up immediately on my phone. \nI can't tell you why your contacts are not updating immediately, but it is definitely not normal. \n", "Q: Use iPhone to connect desktop to wireless I have an old Windows XP desktop with no wireless capability, a wireless router, and an iPhone 4 running iOS 5.1.1.  If the iPhone is connected to the desktop by USB, (how) can I use it to access the router (and the internet) without incurring 3g network data charges?\n\nA: I think what you're trying to do is called tethering. There are several tethering apps available. They require your iPhone to be jailbroken though. Some apps are PdaNet, TetherMe, and MyWi. \nI know that with MyWi you can connect to the Wireless Network, turn off cellular data in your iPhone, and use it to tether without charges.\n-Notice, these apps are all Paid apps on Cydia, but if you're jailbreaking your iPhone there are ways to get the apps for free.\n", "Q: Movies button missing in Purchased items in iTunes I've bought some movies in iTunes on my Mac.

I can get to the \"Purchased\" section fine, except that I don't get a \"Movies\" button at all.\nAny ideas about how to get the movies button (or get the movies to the other pc in an other way)?\n\nA: You're probably in an iTunes-restricted country. While any user may re-download apps and books, re-downloads of music and movies are restricted to certain countries.\nYou'll need to manually copy the movies over to the XP computer. Note that you will need to activate iTunes with your AppleID to be able to play them.\n\nA: That's because most movies are not yet available to redownload like music and apps are.\n", "Q: Tricky way to register @me account I want to register an email address @me.com.

I discovered today that there are a lot of non-Apple low-cost iPhone (and iPad) chargers. The cost is very low, so I am concerned about the quality of such chargers. \nAre these alternative chargers safe or can they damage the iPhone (or its battery)? It is better to buy Apple components or can we safely buy third-party components?\n\nA: Most of the third party iPhone ones are mostly safe most of the time. However there isn't a good way to tell which ones aren't. Here is a teardown of an Apple one and a clone.\nI say most of the time since some of the safety issues are only problems if there are faults. But in a poorly designed one, faults can cause fire and/or shock. Also poorly designed ones can get hot, which might be a problem in an enclosed space.\nI personally would avoid anything that claims to be from Apple but is priced lower than theirs. That demonstrates the seller is willing to lie, so they are questionable to begin with. A reputable seller wouldn't try to pretend they are selling Apple chargers.\n\nA: Your mileage may vary. Most 3rd-party accessories use inferior parts or less rigorous quality assurance. They may work, they may not.\nPaying the extra $10 for the official Apple charger is probably worth it, when weighed against the risk of buying a new iPhone.\nPlus, any issues with official accessories will be covered by the warranty.\nBasically, it's hit or miss. Use at your own risk.\n\nA: Are all third party chargers safe? No - not even close. \nAre all third party chargers unsafe? Same answer.\nIf you use a charger somewhere where it won't start a fire and you can afford to replace a damaged phone / iPad if it comes to that then I'd say it's worth it to take into account your familiarity with electronics and perhaps decide to get a third party product you feel is made well enough.\nSadly, you can't trust UL and other stickers, since counterfeiters have no problem placing those safety logos on product that clearly haven't gone through testing. Don't be overly scared of every adapter, but also caveat emptor.\n\nA: I have used non apple chargers, adaptors and every single time have regretted it. I used a duracell charger pad and it worked for a long time. However after about a year, the phone completely died. I thought it was the battery but I was told the motherboard was fried. My husband had a phone exactly the same time as mine and his continued to work fine years after mine died (unfortunately I was out of warranty). Recently I purchased a socket adaptor that plugged into the wall and had electrical sockets as well as usb sockets. I then used my iPhone usb cable and plugged it into one of those usb socket to charge my iPhone 6. After a few months, my usb cable no longer is working. I am the only one in my family who tries non apple chargers/adaptors (for the convenience) and each time one component or another fails. These adaptors I bought from reputable companies or name brands but each time it has made me regret using non apple products.\n\nA: NEVER trust a third party charger and buy the apple one it's worth it\n", "Q: Mountain Lion - Umlauts with english keyboard layout i have small problems with my keyboard typing umlauts.\nOn Lion i could type umlauts with \" followed by the vowel\nThis is no longer possible. The only possibility i noticed is to type \numlauts now by alt+u followed by vowel. \nCan i revert this to \" + vowel\n\nA: There are a few means of typing diacritical marks.\nInput Sources Method\nYou can enable a German Language layout by opening Language & Text in System Preferences, going to the Input Sources, and checking the box next to German. This isn't quite the same as your previous set up, but it allows you to quickly type ü, ö and ä with the [, ; and ' keys respectively. If you check the Show Input menu in menu bar box, you can quickly switch between different layouts, if you want the standard English layout most of the time. The menu also lets you open the Keyboard Viewer, which will show you all the changes of the German layout.\nCreate a Custom Keyboard Layout\nIf the German Layout isn't exactly to your taste, you can use Ukelele to create a custom layout.\nOpen Ukelele, and click File → New From Current Input Source to start a new layout based on your current one. To make the ' key be your umlaut key (so that you press it, followed by a vowel to create the character), click the Create button, click the ' key (or whichever key you want; you can add modifier keys if you wish), then in the dialog that pops up, select Choose an existing dead key state and select State 4. If you want to rebind another key so that you can still type the ' character, double click the key you want to change, and change the output to '.\nYou'll then want to change the name of your layout so you can distinguish it. Set Keyboard Name… under the Keyboard menu will do this for you. You can also set a custom icon if you want.\nOnce you've finished with your layout, save it to your the ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/ folder (or the /Library/Keyboard Layouts/ folder if you want it to apply for every user on your system). You should then be able to select it in the Input Sources section, as above.\nOther Methods\nBy default on Lion and Mountain Lion, you can hold down a vowel to get a pop-up menu that gives you the various diacritics you can apply to that letter, like so:\n\nYou can either click on the one you want, or type the corresponding letter. This functionality is enabled by default, but can be disabled by running defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false in Terminal. To enable it, replace false with true.\nThe other common method, as you have discovered, is to type option ⌥u, followed by the vowel you want. This works on OS X going back to at least 10.4, possibly earlier.\n\nA: Were you using the U.S. International - PC keyboard layout? ⇧' enters a dead key state for inserting umlauts in it.\n", "Q: Cellular Data Number is \"Unknown\" on some iPads Dealing with numerous iPads (3G and LTE), all with the same telco.\nIf I go to Settings, General, Cellular Data Number, some iPads display the number fine (e.g. +11234567890).\nOn others, it shows \"Unknown\"\nThere doesn't seem to be any pattern or any rhyme/reason to it (e.g. iPad model, iOS version, SIM card age). Some show up, others don't.\nThe only fix I've discovered is to have the telco \"push an updated profile\" to it (not an \"iProfile\" - some sort of telco profile).\nThis fix works (after a device restart) but I'm wondering if anybody else has encountered this and found a way to avoid the problem in the first place?\n\nA: This occurred when cellular data was turned Off.  I turned it on and the number appeared.\n\nA: Cellular Data Plans Don't Have a Phone Number\nA phone number is generally not \"attached\" to a data only carrier account and this is what the iPads with Cellular + WiFi utilize.  Many people confuse having a (tele)phone number with a cellular plan, but a phone number is just a means for the customer to connect to another device on the telephone network.\nAs plans go, there are basically three types:\n\n*\n\n*Voice Only.  This is just a basic plan that provides cellular service to make telephone calls with no data.  Yep...they still exist!\n\n*Voice & Data.  This is your iPhone plan where you can make/receive calls as well as use the internet\n\n*Data Only.  This is your iPad, or hotspot type of plan (note, this is not tethering to your iPhone type of scenario)\n\nTwo of the three plans above will have a telephone number because of the need to make a voice call whereas the data only plan has no need for it.  In other words, you can have an account without a telephone number, but you can't have a telephone number without an account.\nAccess to the Network\nIt's your SIM (or eSIM) card that gets you access to the network whether it's a voice/data or data only plan. The Subscriber Identity Module is what authenticates you to the carriers network and identifies not only the device, but the account  that's being connected.  If it's a data only account, there's no phone number.\nI posted an answer to a very similar question relating to the Apple Watch's eSIM and calling another number on the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network).\nWhy some iPads have a Phone Number and Some Don't\nSo, when you look up your phone number by going to Settings → General → About → Cellular Data Number, you may get a phone number or it may come back \"Unknown.\"\nWhy?  This is because of the plan that is selected.\n\n*\n\n*If you put a SIM card in with a voice/data plan, a phone number will show\n\n*If it's data only, \"Unknown\" will show.\n\nNow, since your iPad isn't a phone; excluding FaceTime or similar apps, you can't make telephone calls with it as there's no \"Phone App\" like on the iPhone.  However, you can take the SIM card out of your iPhone that has a voice/data plan attached to it and put it in your iPad and have it function.  You'll be authorized to make voice calls and surf the web, but you just won't have the physical ability to make the calls.    It's like getting phone and Internet service but only buying the PC and not the telephone.\nCould your plan have a phone number but no voice plan?\nAbsolutely!  Carriers make mistakes all the time in how they provision things.  Even though things are mostly automated, there's still a human involved in setting things up and a phone number may get provisioned by accident.  This doesn't mean your data plan has a (working) phone number because you won't be able to call it.\n\nA: Tried all the above but still no joy. Then tried (make sure mobile data is switched on) settings -> mobile data -> mobile data options -> sim applications -> my number\n:) hope this helps.\n\nA: Ring your provider.\nThe phone number, & why it may or may not be registering correctly on your equipment, is entirely their domain.\nThey may have to send you a new SIM, or they may have to push a new profile from their end.\nEither way, they're best placed to investigate it.\nSIMs are not all 'equal'. Over time the firmware on them changes to accommodate newer devices & features. If yours is an older SIM, then replacing it might be the only option. \nI had a similar situation on an iPhone 6S which was still using the SIM supplied for an earlier phone. Whilst it worked fine for the first couple of years, it then started dropping the line & generally being 'weird'. New SIM fixed it immediately.\n", "Q: Copying files to the clipboard using applescript Often I find myself at the command line wanting to copy files to the clipboard, so that I can paste them as attachments in Mail.  If I have an image file, image1.png, I can accomplish this with\nosascript -e 'tell app \"Finder\" to set the clipboard to ( POSIX file \"image1.png\" )'\n\nIf I execute the above command and then open a new message in Mail and press command V, the image file is pasted as an attachment.  Note that pbcopy is apparently not a solution here, because this would copy the contents of the file and result in junk when pasted with command V.\nMy question is how can I do the same thing with multiple files?  Suppose I want to paste both image1.png and image2.png.  This is trivial from Finder (select them both, command C, then switch to Mail and command V; voila, both files show up as attachments)… but how can I do this from the command line?\n\nA: This isn't quite perfect for what you want, but I think it might get you closer. Quicksilver has a command line tool. When installed, you can pipe files from the command line to Quicksilver app, and from there send them as attachments in Mail.\nTo install Quicksilver command line tool, activate Quicksilver. Then navigate to Quicksilver > Preferences to open preferences window. Click on Preferences on top right of window. On the left, click on Command Line Tool and install.\nIn Terminal, you'll be able to type \nqs path/to/file1 path/to/file2 path/to/file3 path/to/file4\n\nPressing enter will send those files to Quicksilver's first pane. Press tab to move to the action pane and choose the Mail/New Email With Attachment action. Press enter, and a new email with your selected files attached should appear.\nNote that you will also have to install the Mail and Command Line plugins in Quicksilver (Quicksilver > Preferences > Plug Ins).\n\nA: You can do something like :\nset f to {(POSIX file \"/path/to/a/folder/a.png\"), (POSIX file \"/path/to/another/folder/b.png\")}\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    try -- to delete any old temp folder\n        delete folder \"AS_mailCopy\" of (path to temporary items)\n    end try\n    set tmp to make new folder at (path to temporary items) with properties {name:\"AS_mailCopy\"}\n    duplicate f to tmp\n    select files of tmp\n    activate\n    tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"c\" using command down\n    delete tmp\nend tell\n\nNow your pasteboard contains multiple files (from various folders) that you can paste into your mail.\n\nA: Why not just drag and drop?

If I would like to attach a second monitor to my MacBook air is my only option the Thunderbolt Display?  Everything I've found online points me there, but those are a cool grand, so I'm wondering if there are other options out there that I just don't know about.\n\nA: The Thunderbolt ports are also mini-Displayport compatible. So you can hook up pretty much any display (Displayport, HDMI, DVI, VGA) with the proper adapter.\nFor high-resolution panels (greater than 1920x1200), you should try to go with Displayport if possible, as the mini-Displaylink to dual-link DVI adapters have been problematic for many people (this isn't an issue for single-link DVI displays, which comprise all but the largest DVI displays around).\n", "Q: How to plot a histogram to show occurrence of a certain number using Numbers Sorry for this newbie question:\nI want to do something like in a column there are numbers 0.2, 0.3, 0.2, 0.4,\n0.2 occur 2 times, whereas 0.3 and 0.4 occur once, I want to make make histogram that first bar show 0.2, the y value will be 2, and 0.3, 0.3 only 1\n\n\nA: Here is one way.\nStep 1\n\n*\n\n*Make a new sheet.\n\n*Make a table with one column and add your data to that column:\n\n0.2\n0.3\n0.2\n0.4\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that this first table does not have a header column or a header row.\n\nStep 2\n\n*\n\n*In the same sheet as the first table, make a new table with two columns.\n\n*Give that table four rows (or more).\n\n*In the new table, make the first column a header column.\n\n*In that first column add in a list of values you want to 'count' on, e.g.:\n\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n\n*\n\n*In the second column, enter this formula in the first row =COUNTIF(Table 1 :: $A$1:A$4,A1) where 'Table 1 :: $A$1:A$4' is referring to the column of data in the first table, and 'A1' is referring to the cell in the first row of the first column in this second table.\n\n*Copy down the formula to the remaining rows in the second column of the second Table.\n\nYou should end up with the second table looking something like:\n\n0.1    0\n0.2    2\n0.3    1\n0.4    1\n\nStep 3\n\n*\n\n*Select the second table and click the Charts icon in the toolbar.\n\n*The first chart type (vertical bar chart) should be what you need.

If they come with the original disks, then I can’t see any problems arising, as I should be able to restore them to as factory release and resell with the disks.\nI can, however, see a problem arise if they do not come with original disks, and the software is corrupt, or has no recovery partition etc. What I would like to know is the legal implications of reinstalling a copy of the original software, in order to resell the machine.\nIs there a way to establish what the original software was when supplied new, and what would be the licensing issues, in obtaining a copy of OS X to perform a recovery?\nPresuming machines would be from 1-3 years old, would I be able to just use one disk of say Snow Leopard, Lion etc to reinstall to original specifications, or would I need to purchase a new software pack for each machine that does not have the original disks?\n\nA: The Software License Agreement for Mac OS X states the following:\n\n3. Transfer\nA. If you obtained the Apple Software preinstalled on Apple-branded hardware, you may make a one-time permanent transfer of all of your license rights to the Apple Software (in its original form as provided by Apple) to another party, provided that: (i) the Apple Software is transferred together with your Apple-branded hardware; (ii) the transfer must include all of the Apple Software, including all its component parts, printed materials and this License; (iii) you do not retain any copies of the Apple Software, full or partial, including copies stored on a computer or other storage device; and (iv) the party receiving the Apple Software accepts the terms and conditions of this License. For purposes of this License, if Apple provides an update (e.g., version 10.8 to 10.8.1) to the Apple Software, the update is considered part of the Apple Software and may not be transferred separately from the pre-update version of the Apple Software.\n\nThis means that a transfer to you as a buyer or to the next seller that does not meet these conditions (eg. does not include the installation media), does not imply a valid license transfer for Mac OS X for you to reinstall the OS or sell the computer again.\n", "Q: Dropbox and login items list I have Dropbox installed on my Mac with OS X Lion 10.8.2. I don't use it often, so I eliminated it from the login item list. However, every time I open Dropbox from the application folder, it automatically add itself to the login item list. Is that normal, even if I locked changes? Can I prevent Dropbox to add itself to my item list every time I open it?\n\nA: Under Dropbox preferences, there is a checkbox for \"Start Dropbox on System Startup\".  \nHowever, as patrix says, Dropbox is really only useful if you leave it running all the time.\n\nA: The idea of Dropbox is to always sync files across all your devices in the background. So disabling the login item doesn't really make sense from a Dropbox point of view. And at least at first glance I don't see significant drawbacks from keeping it there either.\nIf you just want to access some files in your Dropbox account you could use the web interface instead.\n", "Q: Trouble with 13 inch MacBook Pro & about buying AppleCare This is the 2nd time I have trouble with my 13\" MacBook Pro, which I have purchased a little less than 1 year ago, in october 2011.\nFirst time it was 6-7 months ago—the logic board was short circuited—, about which I have posted here. As it was under warranty, I got it repaired.\nNow, about a month and half ago, when I was using it, a reddish tint appeared on the screen and after few moments the screen start displaying different colors.\nAfter that, whenever I turned it on, there was no desktop display. Instead it was only showing different colors like red, green, blue, grey etc. one at a time & in full screen. I mean, the whole screen shows one color and nothing else is visible. At that time, within 2-3 days I got to fly to south-Korea on a business trip for a month and I thought I will get it repaired after getting back. But now the trip is extended and it looks like I won’t be able to get it repaired in warranty time.\nWhat can be the reason for this defect? Why is it showing different colors on screen?\nIt’s warranty is expiring on 10th of October. \nMy question is: can I purchase AppleCare from Korea and use it for my MacBook Pro which I purchased from India?\nAlso, can AppleCare be registered after the warranty expires? Because Apple says on its web site to buy AppleCare before warranty time is over. It does not say anything about registering it.\n\nA: AppleCare is worldwide, and you can purchase it anytime within the first year warranty. It takes effect from the end of your warranty whenever you buy it as long as you register it at some point during that year, so just go ahead and buy it now.\n", "Q: How can I control (start/stop) applications and services that start up after reboot? I have a Mac that is slow when using the internet, but other PCs on the same connection aren't as slow.\nI suspect there are too many AV scanners running concurrently, or there is some process that isn't installed by default slowing the whole thing down.\nQuestion\nWhere can I find all possible applications that will be automatically started when the machine turns on?  (and how do I shut them off)\nThis should include\n\n\n*\n\n*Applications on the menu bar on the bottom \n\n*Services (like Antivirus) \n\n*Menu-bar applications\n\n\nA: Applications and Menu Bar items\nMost of these can be easily configured in:\nSystem Preferences → Users&Groups → Login Items\nLaunchAgents and LaunchDaemons\nSome applications are cannot be configured in the System Preferences (e.g. Sophos AV Scanner, HandsOff Firewall,...) It's best to configure them in their own application to assure that everything runs as designed and intended.\nYou can look for related LaunchAgents and LaunchDaemons in:\n~/Library/LaunchAgents               ~/Library/LaunchDaemons\n/Library/LaunchAgents                /Library/LaunchDaemons\n/System/Library/LaunchAgents         /System/Library/LaunchDaemons\n\nStartup Items\nAfter I installed the multi-boot utility rEFIt, it copied a file rEFItBlesser which is run at startup.\nItems that run at startup can be found in the following locations:\n~/Library/Startup Items\n/Library/Startup Items\n\n", "Q: Why does a .DS_Store file keep appearing on the desktop? Every time I delete it from the desktop, I get the same file \".DS_store\" created after some time. Is there a reason why this happens ? And can I permanently stop it from being created ?\n\nA: .DS_Store is used by OS X to store directory information used by Finder such as icon position, etc.\nIn OS X any file name that starts with a \".\" is hidden, so to hide the .DS_Store file you can use the terminal command:\nsudo defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles NO\n\nBasically, you can ignore it.  If you are copying a directory to a flash drive and looking at it in Windows, feel free to just delete it.  It is Mac OS X Finder that creates this file whenever it opens a new directory.\nAn alternative solution would be to prevent Finder from automatically creating these files.  The following terminal command changes the default setting from automatically creating them to not:\ndefaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores TRUE\n\nAnd to revert back to the default behavior:\ndefaults delete com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores\n\n\nA: For those who would like to still view other hidden files but hide the desktop .DS_Store file, the solution is to give the desktop version a transparent icon. The best instructions I have found are here:\nhttps://www.scottofford.com/2013/03/hide-ds-store-on-mac/\nWhen finished with the transparent icon, drag the icon's text to off the screen and you will never see the desktop file again. \n\nA: Type this in Terminal (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app):\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE\nkillall Finder\n\nThe first command sets the hidden files visibility to hidden; the second one forces Finder to restart. This is needed for the first command to take effect. \nYou can also log out/reboot instead of killing the Finder, but the first command is needed to change a hidden preference (one that the Finder can’t change using the normal Finder view options or preferences).\n\nA: There's a way to hide all \"dot\" files from Desktop with 3rd party app called XtraFinder.\nGo to Settings → Features tab → Hide dot files on Desktop\n\nThough I still didn't manage to hide all .DS_Store files and keep all other dot files visible, this is a pleasant improvement.\n\nA: Just to keep this thread up to date, it's no longer necessary to kill the Finder to show/hide dot files.\nThis Applescript will do it by refreshing all window contents instead; it's also faster than relaunching the Finder.\nset newHiddenVisiblesState to \"YES\"\ntry\n    set oldHiddenVisiblesState to do shell script \"defaults read com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles\"\n    if oldHiddenVisiblesState is in {\"1\", \"YES\"} then\n        set newHiddenVisiblesState to \"NO\"\n    end if\nend try\ndo shell script \"defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles \" & newHiddenVisiblesState\n\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set theWindows to every Finder window\n    repeat with i from 1 to number of items in theWindows\n        set this_item to item i of theWindows\n        set theView to current view of this_item\n        if theView is list view then\n            set current view of this_item to icon view\n        else\n            set current view of this_item to list view\n\n        end if\n        set current view of this_item to theView\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nSave as an app & launch to toggle visibility.\n\nA: You can Remove all DS_Store files\n\n\n*\n\n*Select Applications > Utilities to launch Terminal.\n\n*Enter the following UNIX command:\n\n*sudo find / -name \".DS_Store\" -depth -exec rm {} \\;\nWhen prompted for a password enter your Mac OS X Administrator password.\nYou can also schedule a crontab to remove them periodically \nMore details: https://helpx.adobe.com/dreamweaver/kb/remove-ds-store-files-mac.html\n\nA: \nAnd can I permanently stop it from being created ?\n\n\nOver 3 years later and still no further to being able to exclude\n.htaccess files from being hidden without showing all hidden (dot)\nfiles.\n\nThis answer comes a little late, but I've stumbled across this question, and I believe I have a useful solution: you could just disable the .DS_store creation in the first place. Death to .DS_Store explains one way how. I have tested this on 10.5, 10.6, and 10.15.\nbrew install deathtodsstore\n\nThis installs a handy GUI application, check \"Launch Agent Installed\" and \"Patch Finder\". (I think you have problems with re-opening windows on log-in in 10.15.) However, as documented, still, this will not work with SIP on; specifically (from experimentation,) csrutil disable; csrutil enable --without fs --without debug (this is undocumented and probably not manufacturer approved.) However, with this, hiding files behave much more as expected.\n\nA: Apparently, it was due to an old Safari update that accidentally showed the .DS_Store file.\n\nA: You can just download and use an app to remove ds_store files from the Apple App Store.\n\nA: There is an application you can download called Show Hidden Files.app\nIt allows you to easily toggle hidden files on and off.  The .ds store file is always generated in finder.  You can only hide the file through the methods mentioned, or with this handy script.\n", "Q: How to scan an image (map) using only 256 colors? Is there a way to can an image on OSX using only 256 colors rather than millions or billions?\nI am scanning maps which only use a few colors, so I think I want to keep the color depth low so there is clear separation between lines and background (kind of like B&W vs. Gray Scale). Note I want to do this at scan time to improve the scan.\nI am on 10.7.4 with a HP C4599. HP Scan doesn't let change the color depth at all. Preview (or Image Capture) only let's me choose between millions and billions.\n\nA: You can use ColorSync for this job. It still requires you to scan the document with lots of colors, but you can reduce the colors to 256 using ColorSync (and do much more) by following these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open ColorSync: Applications->Utilities->ColorSync Utility\n\n*Open your scanned image: File->Open\n\n*Below the image select: Apply Profile->Named Colors->Websafe Colors \n\n\nI translated the names from german, thus they may be slightly different on an actual Mac OS X with english local setting.\n\nA: I can't provide an answer for getting 256 colours during scanning, but if you save the millions+ colours image as a PNG then you can use ImageAlpha to convert it 256 colours or less.\n", "Q: How often should I remove the charger from my rMBP? I want my battery to remain healthy. I used to charge it full then remove the charger after it's done, then put it back on when it goes down to 10% .. However this is becoming hectic and I was wondering if I can keep it plugged in the whole day and probably remove just an hour or so before going to sleep.\nWhat is the best way to charge and discharge my Retina Macbook Pro while keeping the battery healthy ?\n\nA: Quick Answer\nModern batteries, including the ones Apple has used for over a decade, don't need the type of \"conditioning\" you're talking about.\nAs a rule of thumb, when you're near an power adapter, plug in. If you're not near one, work off battery power.\nThere's just one exception to this rule: don't leave your Mac plugged in for long periods at a time, say, over a week. The battery needs to exercise, and if it's plugged in for a really long time, it might \"atrophy.\"\nMore Details\nIf you tend to leave your computer plugged in all the time (for example, if you leave it on a desk all the time), get in the habit of unplugging it every weekend. It doesn't need to drain to 0% each weekend, or even close to it. Along this same line, if you're leaving your computer along for over a week, just leave it unplugged.\nThe one-week timeframe is actually a bit over-cautious, and no harm is likely to occur even if you left it plugged in for two weeks. (Apple's batteries are the best on the market as far as taking care themselves.)\nSources\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm an Apple-Certified Mac Technician, trained by Apple\n\n*Apple's public website: http://www.apple.com/batteries/notebooks.html\n\nA: Its absolutely ok to leave it plugged on. The MBP will run, using the power from the charger directly and at the same time keep the batteries on trickle charge ( the trickle charging processes starts right from 80% upwards) However a deep discharge/charge cycle is  advised only every 6 months. \n", "Q: Cannot sync digital copy movie to iPad via itunes I have two movies where I downloaded the digital copy (using the standard redemption method) to iTunes. They are mpeg-4 files, but unlike other mpeg-4 files, I cannot sync them to my iPad. It says, for example:\n\n\"Paul (Unrated) [2011]\" was not copied because the video format is not supported by the iPad \"The Oracle\".\n\nIf I try to double click and play it on my iMac, it says:\n\nThis movie requires QuickTime, which is not supported by this version of iTunes.\n\nI'm running iTunes 10.7. If I go to the actual file and double click it, I can view it with QuickTime.\nAny idea what I may be doing wrong?\n\nA: After a few hours with Apple Tech Support, we discovered that we needed to restart iTunes in 32-bit mode and then the movies would sync to my iPad and could be played in iTunes. To set 32-bit mode, Do a Get Info on the iTunes Application and check the \"Open in 32-bit mode\" checkbox.\n", "Q: Is it possible to configure (or trick) internet recovery to load Lion instead of Mountain Lion? I have two machines this week that I needed to install Lion on and both were shipped with Lion and subsequently upgraded to Mountain Lion.\nI tried wiping the drives, but Internet Recovery only offers a choice to download and install Mountain Lion. Is there a way to get Lion reinstalled instead?\nI tried running the Install Mac OS X Lion app that I saved when I was using it to upgrade several Snow Leopard Macs to Lion last summer - but Apple has built in a check to prevent me from installing Lion onto an external drive while my mac currently runs Mountain Lion.\n\nIs there an elegant way to instal Lion without needing a bootable Lion system to re-run the Lion installer (or download it from Internet Recovery)?\n\nA: Yes - you can download the OS X Recovery Disk Assistant v1.0 and write a Lion specific Recovery HD to an USB drive with 1 GB of space on it. This will erase whatever information is on the USB partition, but then you can boot to a Lion Recovery HD and re-install Lion even if the Mac has Mountain Lion installed.\n\nA: I don't think there is a way to trick a Mac, or to trick Apple's servers. If you want to use or install Lion.\nI think the only way would be to have a bootable drive (which I imagine you don't have), or to copy a Lion installation to the new Mac (using Carbon Copy Cloner or something like that).\nI know this isn't an answer, just haven't got enough reputation to make comments on this StackExchange community.\n", "Q: iOS 6 Facebook Integration: How may I extract contacts from iPhone? iOS 6 has a new feature that allows my facebook contacts to be synced as a separate group.\nI would like to extract the contacts, is it possible to do somehow? \n\nA: The answer lies in the Contacts applications for OS 10.7+. First, you must set iCloud in System Preferences to sync your contacts, or you can sign into Facebook (if you're using Mountain Lion).\nThen, open Contacts and select the \"All Facebook\" item to the left of the window. Select all visible contacts by clicking within the contact list and pressing ⌘A.\nGo to File > Export… > Export vCard… and save with the name and location you desire.\n", "Q: How to block \"Twitter’s Promoted Tweets\" on iOS How could I block \"Twitter’s Promoted Tweets\"? I use the official iOS client. I also use the official OS X client, but so far didn't notice on OS X \"Promoted Tweets\".\nIs the solution to switch to other iOS client? Which one without ads?\n\nA: Twitter is injecting the promoted tweets into the stream. It's only a matter of time until they lean on every third-party app provider to stop filtering out the promoted tweets as this is how they're going to pay for the service.\nIn the short-term you can use a different client but in the long term all signs point to you being forced to see promoted tweets promoted tweets or leave Twitter.\nEven in fall of 2013, most major third party twitter apps aren't showing promoted tweets.

Sometimes they appear as two or three separate texts when they are received. \n\nA: This is normal functionality and has been present on the original iPhone OS on the very first iPhone back in 2007.\nWhat you are seeing is that the iPhone is allowing you to send messages that are longer than the SMS limit, and when you do that it automatically splits the message into the number of SMS messages required to send your message.\nIf your recipient has an iPhone, they just see the original un-split message as the iPhone puts it back together for the recipient.  Other devices, such as your friend's Android device, just show the discrete SMS messages in the order they were sent.\n\nA: The problem is someone refusing to support Concatenated SMS, as @Andrew Ferrier noted. in a comment on Stu's answer.  The spec makes for very dense, acronym-rich reading. \nHowever, there's a section that's relatively readable, which reads: \n\n3.8.3       Text       concatenation\n  If the concatenation mechanism described in subclause 9.2.3.24.1 is not supported by the transmitting or receiving \n  entity, the following textual concatenation mechanism may be used. The first message is ended with a + sign, and each \n  subsequent message start and end with + signs until the final message which starts with a + sign but does not end with a \n  + sign. \n\n <message1>+ \n +<message2>+ \n +<message3> \n\n\nAny header fields placed on the front of an MO or MT message are not added to the second and subsequent messages. \n  This provides a simple mechanism which is completely backward compatible.  There is no indication of the number of \n  messages and should a message be lost by the system or arrive out of sequence then the original message cannot be \n  reconstructed.  Therefore, wherever possible the concatenation mechanism specified in sub clause 9.2.3.24.1 should be \n  used instead. \n\nSince the '+' characters would be apparent if the receiver didn't support the simple coding but the sender did, it's clear that this simple mechanism is not supported by Apple.  \nI gave up/lost interest in deciphering the spec before figuring out who supports or doesn't support 9.2.3.24.1 but it doesn't matter too much to me; the blame falls on Apple for not supporting the simple fallback scheme. \n", "Q: Google Exchange service and missing calendar events I have my iTouch (4th generation, up to date) syncing with Google's Exchange service, and mostly it works fine.

I have had my first MacBook for around a month now and I'm already beginning to notice some wearing on the keys (especially on the spacebar). The keys are beginning to turn shiny, and at this rate they might be completely eroded in six months. I have tried cleaning them with a dry cloth (I have yet to try with a wet cloth) but it seems that it is indeed physical wearing and not just a spot of grease.\nI think I have read on another forum that if you bring your MacBook to an Apple Store and ask for replacement they'll remove your keys and replace them with new ones. Is this true? Do they charge for it?\nI don't mean to sound whiny. I am asking this question because my MacBook cost me quite a lot and its exterior aspect is an important part of the experience: seeing parts of the keyboard starting to wear is somewhat frustrating.\n\nA: Rather than ask us, you might ask your local store since they are the ones that will make the call.\nMy guess is if you have a functional problem where you loved the Mac to death and used it so much the keys are worn, they would replace it under AppleCare or the standard Warranty. I wouldn't expect warranty service for normal wear and tear and this will likely be up to them to make the call whether your specific instance is one or the other.\nAlso - do go in if you are frustrated with your purchase. Go now and not later, since the sooner you show them wearing, the sooner they can document it and it's more likely they'll want to replace something that is wearing out prematurely. Think like tires, if yours wear out in under 5000 miles (or km) it's clearly something the warranty should cover.

According to Terminal, however, they're owned \"unknown\" if I look at them using sudo. If I don't use sudo they agree with Finder. I still seem to have normal access to them, but can anyone tell me what's going on here?\n\nA: These files are owned by UID 99, which is the unknown user.  These files were, perhaps, initially created by an account that is no longer on the system, or a \"different version of yourself\" that was migrated from a previous version of the OS, etc.  To avoid confusion, when a normal user inspects these files, they appear to belong to whoever is viewing them.

It originally came with OS X 10.6.6 (snow leopard). I since upgraded it, through the App Store, to OS X 10.7.5 (lion).\nI want to wipe everything clean on the hard drive so the new owner starts fresh. I have the original Install DVD. Should I just insert that and format the drive? Is there an easier way, like with iPhones, that I can click on something?\nAfter resetting everything, do I then need to go to the App Store with my Apple ID, install Lion, and then erase my Apple ID?\n\nA: It's much easier to just reboot to the Recovery HD (restart and hold down command and R).\nThen use Disk Utility to erase the hard drive. Everything will be gone and if you want to be paranoid, you can zero the entire drive one or more times. Once that erase is done, you can re-install Lion from Apple's image over the network. You could also use the DVD at that point, but the erase is quite easy and best done using the Recovery HD on the Mac's drive.\nI don't think you'll need to sign in to get Lion, but if you do, then you can just put Snow Leopard on the Mac. That would be the best thing to do licensing wise, since the App Store terms require you to erase software before selling your Mac.\n", "Q: Can CPU Speed Stepping be prevented? A while ago, I asked a question regarding the reason behind my computer slowing when it had ~5% battery or less. I was told that it was either CPU speed stepping or the Macbook Pro automatically scaling back the processing power to conserve battery power. \nBuilding on that question, I'm wondering how I would prevent the computer from either undergoing CPU speed stepping or from scaling the processing power back?\n\nA: It is unlikely you will find a reliable and trivial tool for changing the processor's low level power management away from Apple's recommendations.\nAs a user, you are limited to the options available in the Energy Saver panel of System Preferences and pmset.\nTo stop the processor stepping up or down depending on power available, will require a custom kernel extension.\nOS X's power management is handled by a layer called IOKit within the kernel. Writing code within the IOKit is not trivial; mistakes can induce kernel panics and do serious harm to the system's stability.\nAs of 10.8.2, OS X considers 20% battery to be the first stage of a low battery warning.\nIf your battery is at 5%, it is likely your Mac will shortly be entering emergency sleep or hibernation mode in order to safeguard your data.\n", "Q: Installing Visual Studios using Bootcamp Assistant I have recently installed Windows 7 on my Mac using Bootcamp Assistant. I have partitioned a decent amount of memory for it. Now I am trying to install Visual Studios 2010 Express on the Windows partition.\nShould I be able to install software after booting up in Windows, because that did not work? So I burned a Visual Studios 2010 Express to a DVD on OSX and then booted up Windows, then tried to install from the DVD but that didn't work either.\nAll I know is that Bootcamp Assistant has something to do with installing extra software on Windows. But I'm not sure how. I have read the Bootcamp Assistant Guide but that is only a guide to installing Windows.\nAny searches I do on Google are for using Virtual Box or say that Bootcamp is a good option for this or that, but does not explain how to do it.  In a nutshell can I use Bootcamp Assistant to install Visual Studios? If so, how? If not, what are my other options?\n\nA: BootCamp Assistant is only for installing the OS, or burning the drivers CD used to help you complete the installation of drivers for your particular hardware.\nOnce you have a working Windows 7 install, Bootcamp just provides the facility to boot between the two OS, Windows and OS X.\nIn this case, you have successfully completed the install of Windows 7, but you are having issues installing VS2010.\nWhatever the install issues with VS2010 Express are they are unlikely to be related to the fact that Windows is running on a Mac, and more than likely to be install pre-requisites, such as service pack level, etc.\nWithout further information its unlikely that we would be able to determine what the issue is, or if it is in any way related to being run under Bootcamp.

This is possibly a bug in OS X (try updating your system) or perhaps an inevitable side-effect of not having a predictable schedule to code against.\n\nA: First thing I'd do is update your software.

Since all apps are now sandboxed when purchased from the Mac App Store, what does this mean for the install process? Do you literally downoad the .app bundle, which gets placed into /Applications, and then the process is complete?\nIs it possible for an application that is sandboxed to install a Quicklook Plugin for use with filetypes it supports?\n\nA: Yes, any application placed in the Applications folder can provide QuickLook support.\nSandboxing does not affect an application's ability to support QuickLook.\nMac OS X looks inside applications for a QuickLook plug-ins folder. The specific folder is:\nMyApp.app/Contents/Library/QuickLook/\n\nSupport for Automator and Spotlight can also be provided using this per-application Library folder mechanism.\nWhen you download an application from the Mac App Store you are still going through /usr/bin/installer. The Mac App Store downloads a flat-file installer package .pkg and then installs it on your behalf.\nThis allows the installation process to be more than just a single copy for complex applications; functionality that is only available to Apple software. For now, third party software can do no more than provide a single application to be placed within the /Applications folder.\n\nA: Yes, you can add a Quicklook Plugin to an application. For example, QuickNFO uses one: QuickNFO Mac App store page\n", "Q: Hearing an echo of my voice using the Apple headset I'm not sure if it occurred after I upgraded my iPhone 4 to iOS 6 but since some days I hear an echo of my voice when using the Apple headset on phone calls. It also seems that when I simply plug in the headset without calling or listening to music I hear some noise trough the earphones.\nThe echo is very annoying and it's almost impossible to use the headset for phone calls. Is there any solution or are there any other problem descriptions?\n\nA: I am having the same exact issue. I have called Apple Care and all they could tell me was to do a soft reset, and a full restore and that the cause would be hardware related. I don't believe it's hardware related since this occurred after the upgrade to iOS 6 so this is clearly a software related problem. They made no other suggestions on how to resolve this issue at this time. \nI did however google this and found this post.\nThis seems to have been an issue even with iOS 5 on the 4S. This only happens when plugging the headset in during a call. If you initiate the call with the headset already plugged in the echo is not there. If you plug the headset in during a call however, in order to get rid of the echo, turn the speaker on and off (with the headset still plugged in) and the echo will go away.\n", "Q: Share iPhone Tethering Through Airport Express? Is it possible to tether my iPhone in some way to my Airport Express (latest generation) so that my tethered connection is served to all my computers connected to my Airport Express?\nI can easily connect each of my computers wirelessly to my iPhone, however, doing so means I loose that local network. If it can't be done with an Airport Express, can it be done any other way?\nThanks.\n\nA: Probably it's not the best way but you can tether your connection to one computer, and the share the Internet connection through Ethernet other the network (Airport Express Ethernet input) from that computer. \nIf you have a Mac it's simple. Go to Settings, then Sharing and finally flag Internet sharing. You have to configure it for sharing the Internet connection from Wi-Fi to Ethernet.\n", "Q: How to enable \"Repair disk button\"? Here what happened with me today. TimeMachine asked me whether I want to set a backup disk, I've answered yes, but then, when I've realized that in order to backup anything TimeMachine will clean the disk, I've changed my mind and canceled everything. And my disk suddenly became read only.\nWhat I've tried before Googling:\n$ sudo chflags -R nouchg Elements/\n$ sudo chmod -R a+w Elements/\n\nBut I've failed with both of this, getting \"read-only file system\" messages. \nWhat I've tried after Googling:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Disk Utilities\n\n*Click Repair Disk Permissions\n\n\nBut this button is disabled, and I have no idea what exactly should be done to enable it. \nI have been using this disk for a quite a long time, and never had any permission issues with it. (Disk is formatted as NTFS, if that helps. Capacity is 2TB, of which 1.92TB are available.)\nI'd really appreciate if someone will give me a hint how this can be resolved.\n\nA: You are getting the read-only file system error because on OS X NTFS is natively read-only. It was read-only before your Time Machine run in, and will stay that way unless you install a third-party driver, such as Tuxera NTFS.\nDisk Utility's built-in repair commands are merely a GUI front-end for fsck and fsck_hfs. They are not meant to be used on an NTFS-formatted disk.\n", "Q: How can I keep ~/Library visible in (Mountain) Lion Starting on Lion, Apple decided to annoy the users hiding the ~Library directory.\nI was forced to type this on terminal to bring it back:\nsudo chflags nohidden ~/Library\n\nthe problem is that every new OS update makes the folder hidden again, forcing me to type the command every time.\nIs there a way to make it read-only so Apple cannot change it back?\n\nA: You can use Automator to create a simple app using the Run Shell Script action (with the chflags command within) and put it in your Login Items (in the Users & Groups preferences). It will run every time you log in, so while OS updates will still re-hide the Library, you'll never notice.\nDaniel Jalkut of Red Sweater Software has a pre-made app for this if you don't want to bother making your own. You can find it on his blog. Just download it and drag it to your Login Items.\n\nA: If you don't want to add a login item, you could also save this as ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.stackexchange.apple.66594.plist:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC -//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\nhttp://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd>\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>EnableGlobbing</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.stackexchange.apple.66594</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>chflags</string>\n        <string>nohidden</string>\n        <string>~/Library/</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\n\nA: No. Apple is firm in its decision to hide that folder. The only workaround is to either use the Go menu entry in Finder (simply hold down the OPTION key) or create an alias in ~/.bash_profile:\nalias see='chflags nohidden ~/Library'\n\nThen you only need to fire up Terminal and type \"see.\"\n\nA: Really simple. Use the Go Menu/Option key trick to access the Library, then drag it to the Finder window sidebar.\n", "Q: How do I continue to use Time Machine backups after switching my hard disk? I replaced my HD with an SSD (256 GB), and restored the contents from my Time Machine backup (external HD 320 GB).\nNow, after a day of working, I plugged in my external HD to make the next backup. Time Machine now started to scan my files, prepared the files etc. (took rather long, because it somehow needed to scan everything), then entered the \"Deleting old backups\" phase. Everything looked normal, but just when it was about to finish, it failed with \"This backup is too large for the backup disk.\".\nOnly about 200 GB of my SSD are used, so this should easily fit on the external 320 GB HD: Not many files have changed since the time I restored the backup.\nWhen I look into the Time Machine drive, I see, that it has automatically deleted all my old versions already I'm really not happy about that! Only the latest one is left - the one I restored from yesterday, and now it seems to create a separate backup for my new disk? Ok, \"200 GB x 2 > 320 GB\", but that's not what it should do. It should just continue writing the differences, as it has always managed to keep several old versions, so why would it be any different just because I moved the contents to an SSD? \nIs there a way to make Time Machine \"reconnect\" to the new SSD (I assume, it is still somehow \"connected\" to the old HD, and therefore doesn't treat the changes on my new SSD as changes to the backup?)\nI wonder, if I should have rather cloned my HD (e.g. with a third party tool), without Time Machine knowing about it?\n\nA: From http://simon.heimlicher.com/articles/2012/07/10/time-machine-inherit-backup-using-tmutil\n\nTime Machine uses a unique ID (UUID), which is specific to a volume\n  (i.e. a partition of a disk), to associate the volume with its backup.\n  In OS X releases before 10.7 Lion, when people exchanged their disk or\n  migrated to a different Mac, this feature has made it difficult to get\n  Time Machine to continue adding to the backup history of the\n  previously used disk.\nIn OS X Lion and now also OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, there is a nifty\n  new Terminal command called tmutil, which makes this whole drama a\n  breeze.\n\nHere's the command\nsudo tmutil associatedisk -a \"/Volumes/Macintosh HD\" \"/Volumes/Time Machine Disk/Backups.backupdb/John Doe's MacBook/Latest/Macintosh HD\"\n\nSee also How can I use an existing Time Machine backup with my new computer?\n", "Q: Why does BBEdit look bad with retina display? I downloaded the free trial of BBEdit editor and I tried it on a new MacBook Pro with retina display. Surprisingly the text looks pretty bad, like if it is not focused. I doubt this is normal. Is it a problem of the free trial version only, or a problem with the software? Is there any method to make it look like other applications (TeXShop, TextEdit, ...)?\n\nA: Edit: as of version 10.5, BBEdit has retina support.\nI believe it's because BBEdit, like some other applications (Chrome, to name one) doesn't use the standard OS X text rendering library, thus it doesn't automatically get the Retina-calibre text, rather the text gets scaled up (like non-retina images), resulting in the blurry look.\nLuckily the BBEdit team is working on it, they've released a beta version with retina support.\n", "Q: How to change computer name so terminal displays it in Mac OS X Mountain Lion?

However, in the Projects folder, the finder window does not update.\nThis is a problem with Sublime Text 2 because it has a files pane that updates as the file system changes. This does not work for folders inside the Projects folder. I thought it was a bug with Sublime Text 2. But it is a bug in OSX.\n\nA: I don't believe this is the problem of Sublime Text as I am also using OSX 10.7.5 and have the same problem when viewing files and folders on a NAS (network server).\nFor some reason the Finder doesn't 'build' the folder/subfolder view as it used to on my earlier OSX 10.4.11 iMac - so it MUST be the newer operating system and Finder.\nI have to force the Finder to quit and relaunch it for it to show me the up to date cached file system. It is causing me a real problem.\n\nA: Couldn't fix this in Sublime text 2, but if you are using Sublime Text 3, you can fix this same issue by installing a package called \"SideBarEnhancements\".\n", "Q: Setting up Airport Base Station with Uverse AND Sprint Airave I'm trying to configure my home network so that I can use a drive attached to my airport base station as the Time Machine drive. I think that to do this the Airport needs to control the DHCP and the NAT.

Anyone using a third router as the main DHCP server? Why does everything come with a router? Is my setup just too complicated?\nPre-AiRave, the Airport Base Station was the only thing connected to the ATT 2Wire, and it worked fine. Unfortunately, I sprint says the Airave must be in front of the router. The main concern is to get Time Machine working.

Am I barking up the wrong tree?\n\nAirrave WAN Settings Screenshot\nAirrave LAN Settings Screenshot\n\nA: The definitive steps that worked for me.

I was viewing an article and taking random screenshots from interesting parts and pasting them in Notes. Today I open Notes and the pictures are gone, and Notes crashes if I try to select the missing pictures. (Their area is still there taking up space.)\nAny idea if this is normal? How can I recover the images?\n\nA: The answer to your question is yes, sort of. Notes in Mac OS can handle pictures either dragged in or pasted in from the clipboard. I didn't know this would work but just tried it and it worked perfectly.\nMy Notes syncs with both my iPad and iPhone through iCloud. In iOS the image pasted into a note on my Mac is represented by a paper clip and deleting that paper clip on an iOS device does not seem to delete the picture on Mac OS even after sync, so it doesn't work quite as well as I'd like with iCloud and iOS but works fine with Mac OS.\nMy guess is this capability is going to be expanded in a future version of notes and this is a place marker.\n", "Q: Disable Google Play Music menu bar icon Is there a way to disable the Google Play Music icon in the menu bar, while keeping Google Play Music running?\n\n\nA: If you've already tried Command-dragging it out of the menu bar (although draggable menu itmes are a private API feature, as pointed out by comments below and usually only works with system icons like Time Machine, clock, battery, and volume), I'd recommend\nBartender (free in beta, $7 full version)\nBartender allows you full control of your menu bar by adding a second, hidden but easily accessible menu bar to organize all of your icons.

Just wondering if anyone know how to play .wmv file with a MSS1 stream encoded?\n\nA: Try MPlayerX Version 1.0.17, better support for WMV than VLC (MMS1 is ok for me).\n\nA: According to this discussion, you may be able to play MSS1-encoded movies with MPlayer (Windows only). If you can wait a little while longer, VLC should gain the ability to play them in version 2.1. With VLC 2.0.3, I can at least hear the soundtrack (Codec ACELP (Sipro)).\n", "Q: Increase sensitivity of Trackpad? I currently have the sensitivity level to the max, but I still feel its kind of slow for my liking. Is there a way I can make the trackpad on my rMBP even more sensitive ?\n\nA: The setting in System Preferences changes the com.apple.trackpad.scaling key in ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences. You can also edit it manually:\ndefaults write -g com.apple.trackpad.scaling -float 5.0\n\nThe normal minimum and maximum values are 0.0 and 3.0. You have to log out and back in to apply the changes. Moving the slider in System Preferences resets the setting.\n\nA: Absolutety, I'm using Better Touch Tool for a very long time now, and I can't imagine using my Magic Mouse or Touchpad without it anymore. The maximum pointer speed provided by OS X is simply not sufficient (especially for the Magic Mouse). And there's so much more you can do with the hardware (lots of options in the tool).\n", "Q: Measuring PDF margins, etc. with Preview?

I added a folder with some wallpapers to the Desktop settings and also applied Change Picture every 30 mins. However, the folder randomly disappears and the wallpaper switches back to the Galaxy one for unknown reasons. I tried multiple settings and even without adding the folder (using the default folder but with rotation), but still get the same weird result after some time. I am not sure why this happens, but was wondering if there is a way to fix it ?\nAny ideas ? I tried one of the answers but I still have the same problem ..\nUPDATE\nOkay I managed to find something new today !! I was working with multiple desktops and noticed that Desktop 2 still changes the backgrounds at set intervals! Is there a glitch with my first desktop or something ?\nUPDATE 2\nApparently desktop 3 did not change wallpapers ... unless I change the settings. So why did desktop 2 decide to change its wallpapers without me changing its settings ? Could this be creating a conflict ?\n\nA: Just open you Library folder by holding down the option key (alt) and select Library from the Go menu in Finder.\nNavigate to the Preferences folder and delete com.apple.systempreferences.plist\nEmpty your trash then restart.  Then try adding the folder and changing your wallpaper again.  There's a stuck setting.\n*Apple Certified Mac Technician\n\nA: The problem seems to have fixed itself randomly...\nAll I did was start using a second desktop where wallpapers do not reset. ( desktop 1 seemed to have a glitch ). After a few days of using Desktop 2 as my main desktop, and then using desktop 3 for other work, Desktop 1 went back to normal. I am not sure why or how this happened. \nThe solution is to work on another desktop with your preferred wallpaper settings until it fixes itself. That is what happened with me.\n\nA: The answer to this is really really basic - so basic it took me a really long time to figure out :) You'd think that the desktop picture settings in the settings window are global, but they are actually ONLY for the 'desktop' or space you are working on. I have 6 spaces I use with El Capitan, I needed to open the desktop preferences window on each space and make the changes while the window was on each, then it worked perfectly! \n", "Q: Developer Program for Viewing Passbook-Related Pages I have a registered Apple Developer account.

You might get by with an educational account - but most developers use the $99/year plan to gain access to the Provisioning Portal.\nProvisioning devices for testing your application on real iPhones rather than the simulator does require a membership, as does any pre-release software or documentation.

Is there any way to get notes from the iOS 6 Notes app off of an iPhone without requiring an internet connection (or thus iCloud)?  \niTunes Sync, which did Sync Notes on iOS 5 to Mail app on OS X Snow Leopard, no longer works for notes on iOS 6 and Mountain Lion.\nAdded: I found some commercial solutions as answered below.  Are there any free (built-in, open source or non-expiring) solutions?\n\nA: I am not so sure that it's possible without an internet connection, but since notes are just a subset of IMAP, you should be able to use any IMAP e-mail account (e.g. Gmail) for that purpose after you add the account in Settings.app and enable Note Syncing. However, I can't think of a way to do it without any internet connection.\n\nA: Answering my own question:\nThere appear to be 4 commercial Mac OS applications that can read Notes from un-encrypted iTunes backup files, which does include iPhone 5 notes, even with iCloud disabled.  This arstechnica article mentions PhoneView, iExplorer and 2 others.  \nAfter turning off local Backup encryption for an iPhone 5 in iTunes (FileVault is already turned on for the local User directory containing this backup anyway) and doing another Sync, iExplorer successfully read the notes from the Notes app, even completely offline, and with iCloud not turned on for this device.\nNot low cost or free, but better than nothing.\n", "Q: High quality music in iTunes Match I have some very large, high quality music files that I have downloaded from other services (e.g. Beatport) and these files are 1411 kbps, or about 10 MB per minute of music.\nI have been considering iTunes Match, but am somewhat confused about the upload process.\nWould the service irreversibly degrade my tracks to 256 kpbs?\nWill there be a limit on how many of these large tracks I can keep in the cloud?\n\nA: Apple covers this in their FAQ: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204146\nRefer to the about file formats section:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Songs encoded in ALAC, WAV, or AIFF formats will be transcoded to a separate temporary AAC 256 Kbps file locally, before they're uploaded to iCloud. The original files won't be changed.\n  \n*Songs encoded as MP3 or AAC that have been matched to the iTunes Store will be made available for download as 256 kbps as AAC from iCloud. \n  \n*Matched songs in your local library won't automatically be transcoded to 256 kbps AAC. To get a higher quality transcoding, download the matched songs from iCloud.\n  \n\nSo - your local songs won't change unless you delete them. The cloud will have at max, 256 AAC versions of the matched or uploaded songs. If you were to download the songs (after deleting your copy), you'd lose out in terms of bitrate for those songs greater than 256 (and win on saving storage space). Similarly, any songs less than 256 would win in terms of quality if matched and lose in terms of space needed.\nApple limits you to 25,000 songs that were not purchased from the store. Since they only upload a max of 256 AAC - that limits their storage commitment but there's no set size restriction other than max of 200 MB per track or 2 hours per track.\n\nA: A little googling makes me think thar duci9y is spot on in his/her comment.\nAccording to this. iTunes Match will downgrade your music for the cloud if the format and size is right. So your original files will be available to you on your local mac, but will not be in the cloud. \nThere will be no backup/cloud sync of your big files. Not even a copy if the file is bigger than 200mb.\nIf it were me I would backup all my big files before I try Match even though they should not be changed by Match. \n", "Q: How can I sort by date consistently in the Finder? I would like to use the \"arrange by date\" feature of Finder on Mountain Lion (version 10.8.2, all current system updates installed) and view the result in a consistent manner from \"newer\" to \"older\".\nIn this thread there is an example for what the \"arrange by date\" option does:\n\nIn this example (I found the same behavior on my machine) the table sections are sorted with newer items at the top and older items at the bottom. However, within each table section, the sort order is newer items at the bottom and older items at the top.\nIs there a way to way to arrange everything in a consistent order and keep the sections for grouping the files into date categories?\n\nA: When in finder, go to \"view\" in the menubar and then select \"Show view options\" (or something similar, or alternately just press cmd+J) When presented with the new window configure the options how you like them, and then press the \"use as default\", and now everything should be consistent.\n", "Q: How to change boot camp partition if is set?

(Very rarely it will drop just the keyboard or just the mouse, but 99% of the time, it's everything) This is a huge problem because I only have the iMac bluetooth keyboard and mouse, so this basically renders the entire computer useless.\nThe only solution I have so far is to hold down the power button to force the iMac to power down, and boot it up again. Everything works fine after booting it up, but I can guarantee sometime in the next 24 hours it will happen again.\nTurning the mouse on/off, taking the batteries in/out and doing the same for the keyboard has no effect. The light on the bottom of the mouse blinks, but that's it.\nIt is not the battery levels; brand new batteries make no difference. On the rare occasion when it is just the keyboard that drops out, I can get it back by disabling it in the bluetooth menu and re-enabling it. Of course when the mouse drops out I've no idea how to use the keyboard-only to achieve the same actions.\nDo I have a faulty iMac? I've only had it for less than 3 months, and although this did happen once or twice when I first got it, it was rock solid until the latest OS release that I upgraded to (Mountain Lion?

I had to reboot my Macbook, and to my surpise, the queue was empty when I restarted iTunes. Is this behaviour intended ?\nEdit:\nIt appears that this problem was related to the fact that my installation was not a clean install but an upgrade. It was OS X 10.7 upgraded to OS X 10.8. I did a fresh install, and now everything is back to normal; the queue is correctly saved and restored across sessions.\n\nA: It should still be there, if it never downloaded?

How can I keep my whole music library on my NAS and comfortably access it and manage it there and at the same time have a music selection locally stored on my MacBook that I can manage while away and that gets synchronized with my NAS library when I get back.\nIs there way to do that?\nMy Setup: a Synology DS412+ with DSM 4.1 and a MacBook Pro with Mountain Lion\nUpdate:\nThe idea is to have a master library on the nas and a slave library for mobile use that merges all changes back to the master and gets updated information from the nas. Like a selective cloud sync.\nUpdate (2): \nThe purpose of this usage is to be able to play music without having access to broadband internet (train, plane, car, public places, ...) without maintaining two libraries. \n\nA: You could set up something like this (Make sure that your iTunes Library File (iTunes Music Library.xml) is on your mac, not on your NAS):\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a playlist \"On the go\"\n\n*Use this script to move the files in the playlist from your NAS (iTunes media location) to your mac. \n\n*On the go, with no connection to your NAS: iTunes will tell you that the files are not available when you click to play, click \"search\" and select the folder you´ve synced the files to. \n\n*When you add new music on the go, iTunes will copy that to the default location  (/music/iTunes/) on your mac.\n\n*When you have access to your NAS again: Check that the iTunes Media Location is your NAS (Settings > advanced) and click File > Media Library > Organise Media Library. All Files you added while on the go will be copied to your NAS. \n\n*Delete the Files in your local iTunes Media Folder.  \n\n\nA: I am not totally sure that this would work since I don't have your hardware (my home server is an old G4 - works like a charm), but here goes. According to the official documentation on Synology's site, you can easily run iTunes server using their software. If the screenshots, etc., are correct and accurate indicators of the function, you should be easily able to accomplish what you're after using that and the standard sync software they provide. If you haven't set up iTunes server yet, do that. If you have, keep the iTunes media folder on the NAS current using the rest of the sync software. You may have to restart the iTunes server to have it \"see\" the new files, but it should do the trick. \nNote: there is the \"Automatically Add to iTunes\" folder at ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music/ that you might try to monkey with; however, I don't know if such a folder exists on their server version and I have had limited success using this on my local setup. Sometimes she work, sometimes she no work. \nGood luck!\n\nA: Create two libraries in iTunes, one for your NAS and the local one, then hold down the Option key ⌥ each time you start iTunes to choose a library?\nUpdate:\nConcerning the synchronization, I don't see a compelling automatic solution but can be achieved using rsync.\nHere's what I came up with :\n\n*\n\n*create a playlist from your master (NAS) library containing the tracks you want to store locally\n\n*export the playlist to m3u format\n\n*you want to store the files on your disk using the same folder hierarchy than the NAS to ease later sync.

Imo, having the NAS always connected and an internet connection at disposal to access it when you're away, are the 2 constraints to satisfy to take advantage of a such device.\n\nA: I don’t know if there is an easy solution for what you want to do.   I’d recommend turning on “Home Sharing.”  It has an option to see music that’s in one library that’s not in another. \nHighlight the other library in iTunes.  Select “Items not in my library”, highlight them, and select “import.”  You’d have to select that on each library you want to sync.  \nIt’s not quite what you asked for, but it’s built in, and it’s free.  You might be able to create a smart playlist, but I haven’t tried that.       \n\nA: If your library has fewer than 25,000 tracks, this is the perfect use for iTunes Match. You will see all the music in the laptop's library, but you can download only what you want on that computer. You download what you want when you're on wifi. Anything you add to the laptop will get synced to the cloud, and you can download it on your main Mac. \n", "Q: Why do my iMessages get sent with someone else's information?

So I sent it to a repair centre and they told me the logic board was broken. However, when I try to recharge the iPhone by plugging it in the wall, the Apple logo appears and it seems to be booting just fine.\nOnly, when I pull out the plug, the phone immediately shuts down, although the battery indicated it's fully charged. So I think not that the motherboard is broken, but that there's some kind of battery issue. I've tried replacing the battery, but that didn't work out. Another interesting thing is that the phone keeps rebooting. After booting, it shows the \"connect to iTunes\" screen, but after 5 minutes it's back to rebooting.\nIs it really the (connection to the battery on the) motherboard or can you think of something else?\n\nA: It's certainly not the connection of the battery to the logic board. You can test that with a simple continuity tester and your placing a new battery and getting the same symptoms means that unless you got a dud replacement that doesn't even begin to work in spec, \nWithout reading the voltage on the logic board to determine if the systme is shutting itself down due to a sensor failure rather than simply too low voltage being supplied.\nI don't know what you are really looking to do, since unless you are prepared to repair a logic board itself by diagnosing and isolating the failure, does it really matter whether the CPU or a transistor or a current sensor or a supporting power manangement chip has been damaged? You can buy a new logic board and test things or pay to have someone that knows how to repair it fix the phone. I can think of a hundred things that could be wrong (start with picking traces on the logic board and you see how many things could be broken) but guessing why one phone has failed is not likely to help others here.\nNot to come off as snarky, but there are dozens of things to check for sub component micro repair and some people do that very well. For most of us that would open an iPhone, it’s about swapping major components since we don’t want to pay for the skills and tools needed to really diagnose and repair these delicate components. \nI hope this helps you make some decisions how to proceed with repair options or embarking on learning from this failed device after exhausting your tries to open and reconnect things a couple times. \n", "Q: How can I reproduce the Finder sort order without asking Finder to sort for me? I work with a large collection of mostly-text files subdivided by series, periodically mirroring them from an upstream repository and repackaging them using a shell script from a slightly chaotic source organization into more orderly and compact forms. The sources are collected in directories of files for each series numbering from a handful to hundreds per set, with a semi-orderly human-oriented naming convention dating back to the 90's with this general pattern:\nmulti-word-series-name[-$subsetnumber]-$docnumber[.{txt,html,pdf}]\nWhere a series may or may not have subsets, subsets may be numbered with roman or arabic numerals, a series may start with numbered docs in no subset and later  get a subset labeled \"II\" or \"2\", and so on. These names work well for people using them from the Finder, which in most cases orders them in a human-sensible way and detects that name-II-1 comes later than name-6 and that name-2 does not come after name-19. Because my repackaging consists of assembling the latest version of each series into single files in their human-rational order, I use a simple bit of AppleScript that uses the Finder to sort the names of the items in a given directory. This yields correct results, but it is spectacularly inefficient for reasons I don't understand. The AppleScript is:\non run argv\n    set op to \"\"\n    set upath to POSIX file argv as string\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        set foo to every item of folder upath\n        set foo to sort foo by name\n        repeat with curfile in foo\n            set thisname to the name of curfile\n            set op to op & \" \" & thisname as string\n        end repeat\n    end tell\n    return op\nend run\n\n(And no, I don't recall why I did it that way. I wrote it circa 2008 and I mostly hate AppleScript...) This is compiled into a script named \"flist.scpt\" and run from my shell script with \"osascript flist.scpt /path/to/series/folder/\". The result of running that script with a directory that has 26 files in it is to peg the cpu for over 2 minutes. For comparison, 'ls' gives lexically sorted results on the same machine (a G5 iMac running Leopard... don't laugh, it's a utility machine) in 0.008s with the script chewing on the same directory in the background. \nI'm looking to get rid of that AppleScript altogether, but I have not found a way to reproduce the Finder sort logic easily, i.e. by setting a locale or giving some complex arguments to 'sort' that will order the names correctly. My fallback solution if I can't find something canned to do this will be to reproduce the Finder logic myself in some evil mix of sort, sed, awk, and shell, but I'd really like to avoid that if possible. If there's something goofy about my AppleScript that is causing the horrid performance, fixing that would be almost as good as a magic incantation to 'ls' to make it sort like the Finder. \nUPDATE: SOLVED!\nI first tried the Perl Sort::Naturally module, but it sorted labeled-subset names  ahead of the implied subset \"I\" members, which isn't what I wanted. So I went ahead and dove into writing my first Ruby script, after hacking a fix into the Leopard Ruby config to make 'gem' work in the modern world and installing the naturalsort gem. The replacement Ruby script (called with a directory name as an argument) is:\n#! /usr/bin/env ruby -rubygems -KU\n# Largely cargo-culted from stackexchange response. \n# I dunno what exactly the shebang line opts to ruby do. Probably pwn me. \n# My first Ruby script ever. Don't laugh too hard. \n\nrequire 'natural_sort' # gem install naturalsort\n\ndname = ARGV[0]\ninput = Dir.entries(dname)\nputs NaturalSort.naturalsort(input)\n\nThe minor differences in output are that this includes the . and .. entries and delimits entries by line rather than with spaces, but as this is being called from a shell script that already filters out some special names these are trivial to handle. \n\nA: The exact sorting order used by Finder probably depends on the locale, but scripting languages like Ruby and Python have libraries for sorting strings naturally.\n#!/usr/bin/env ruby -rubygems -KU\n\nrequire 'natural_sort' # gem install naturalsort\n\ninput = \"name-II-1\nname-6\nname-2\nname-19\".lines\n# input = Dir[\"#{ENV['HOME']}/Documents/*\"]\n\nputs NaturalSort.naturalsort(input)\n\n\nA: Building a string using \nset a to a & b\n\nis not as fast as building a list and coercing it to text at the end.\nTry:\non run argv\nset op to {}\ntell application \"Finder\" to set foo to sort every item of folder argv by name\n\nrepeat with curfile in my foo\ntell application \"System Events\" to set end of op to name of curfile & space\nend repeat\nreturn op as text\nend run\n\n", "Q: Time Machine/Time Capsule: What is the difference between \"Waiting for index to be ready (100)\" and \"Waiting for index to be ready (101)\"?

Join all remaining devices to the non-5 GHz (2.4 GHz) network. \nProtip: There's a great tool called WiFi Diagnostics in /System/Library/CoreServices. Check it out.\n\nA: You are substantially complicating your troubleshooting and performance by seeking to have a single wifi network. There's substantial performance penalties for bridging.\nThere is an alternative. If you make separate wifi networks, as all of the Airport base stations are on the same wired network and DHCP system, file sharing and streaming will work between devices on different wifi networks. Moreover most of your devices will automatically switch between networks when signal is low.\nI completely agree with Jordan Eunson about not using your 2009 ISP provided Orange Livebox 2 modem as your main router. Set up DMC zone passthrough on the Livebox 1.2 Modem router. And then pick your best Airport Extremes for your main DHCP router.\nAnything you can do to simplify your wifi setup will save you a lot of time in maintenance.

FileVault was turned on on Lion or even earlier. Usual system upgrades should keep FileVault turned on, right?\n\nA: Mount the Time Machine drive / volume on your desktop and navigate to the snapshot you used to restore the Mac.\nIn the /Volumes/path_to_tm/Backups.backupdb/Mac_Name/Latest/HD_Name/Users folder, you will either see a directory or a file.sparsebundle named for your user's short name.\nIf you see a .sparsebundle, you had FileVault 1. If not, then not.\nThe answer here also depends on which version of FileVault (1 or 2) you were using on the missing Mac.\nFileVault 1 is based on encrypting just the home folders of accounts as opposed to encrypting everything on the Disk. If you enable FileVault in OS X 10.3 - 10.6, this is what you get; upgrading to 10.7/10.8 will leave the encryption intact (now called \"Legacy FileVault\").\nIf you recover an FV1-protected account, the encryption should be maintained. Since your recovered account is not encrypted, you didn't have this enabled on your account on your old computer.\nFileVault 2, on the other hand, is based on encrypting the entire startup volume -- all accounts, the OS itself, etc. If you enable FileVault in OS X 10.7 or later, this is what you get. You can also \"upgrade\" from Legacy FV to FV2 by disabling Legacy FV, then enabling FV2 (note that Apple recommends doing this, but it is not automatic).\nIf you had FV2 enabled on your computer, there's no way (at least, no easy way) to tell from the backup. 10.7 and later allow you to encrypt the backup, but that's independent of encryption on the startup volume (i.e. it's entirely possible to have an unencrypted backup of an encrypted system, or an encrypted backup of an unencrypted system). Also, the restored account will be unencrypted, unless you specifically enable FV encryption on the new computer.\n\nA: If I remember correctly, until recently Time Machine backups were unencrypted, even if FileVault was turned on. I think in Mountain Lion you can now encrypt time machine backups (though not Time Capsule ones). If you set this up under Lion, and then maybe your backups were never encrypted - hence FileVault being turned off after the restore?\n\nA: FileVault is a very low-level process, meaning any installe applications does not know whether FileVault was on or off. When data is wrote or read from the disk, it is encrypted on the fly by (I believe) the kernal. THerefore, when Time Machine backed it up, it read the unencrypted files (as it didn't know the drive was encrypted).\nIf you turned FileVault on, you are fine. My general policy is to purchase an insurance policy through my insurance policy, and if someone was stupid enough to try and steal it, I would thrash it on the ground. I am out a Macbook wither way, but this way I get to throw a Macbook on the ground and destroy it, they do not get it, and my data is safe. It's a win-win-win.\nAnd the insurance company buys me a new one. In short, there is NO way to tell from the TimeMachine backups. If you enabled it, then yes, it is enabled and your data is safe.

Even the old ones which were configured to use it don't have the option anymore.\nIt is as if the options disappeared recently. What is the solution to enable SNMP?\n\nA: SNMP appears to be on by default. I bought a new Airport Express recently (the white Apple TV looking version), and just ran this command against it: snmpwalk -v 2c -c public -O e 10.0.1.1 and it returned the huge list of OIDs/values I would have expected.\nYou are correct that the community cannot be changed with the 6.* version of the AirPort Utility app, but 5.6.1 is still compatible even with Mountain Lion. One Mr. Frank Tisellano created an Automator Workflow to install 5.6.1. After installing this, you'll have both versions of the Airport Utility side-by-side. Using 5.6.1 will allow you to customize the community string, and the other advanced options that were lost in version 6.\nSee this answer to install Airport Utility 5.6 on Mountain Lion.\n\nA: In El Capitan, I was unable to get 5.6 running. It showed an \"application damaged\" icon, and trying to open it resulted in a message \"You can’t use this version of the application “AirPort Utility 5.6” with this version of OS X.\" \nHowever, I did get this to work. I have an OS X Leopard Server install running in Parallels v11, and was able to get 5.6 running readily on the older OS. I put the Parallels network into \"bridge\" mode to the host system's Wifi.\nAnd it worked! Airport Utility 5.6 was able to see my Airport Extreme and adjust SNMP settings.\n\nA: After a resetting the base station to default settings using the latest Airport utility (6.1), SNMP is available on the community public.\nIt seems impossible to change the community or to update other informations like the system contact email.\n\nA: To repeat what Jason Salaz wrote: if you want to change SNMP settings you probably have to install Airport Utility 5.6 alongside 6.x. Trying to replace 6.x doesn't work well... either the install fails (typically) or if you get it to install, it will get overwritten later by an update.\nIf an automated script doesn't work, you can extract the app from the 5.6 .pkg file, available from Apple downloads, using a tool like Pacifist. Another option is to simply copy the app from a machine that is running it, rename it to Airport Utility 5.6.app, and then copying that to your Applications folder. Then you will be able to use both 6.x and 5.6.\nTo get to the (rudimentary) SNMP settings, open Airport Utility 5.6, click Advanced, then the \"Logging & Statistics\" button. In that panel you will find settings for turning on/off SNMP, allowing SNMP over internet (WAN), and the SNMP community string.

When I switch to another app (let's say Finder) by cmd-tab, then the next time I switch back to Safari by cmd-tab, I will be in the last full screen window that I was on.\nHow do I move from here to my other full screened Safari window? Is there any way to do this?\nI know I can move to the right/left space by ctrl-arrow, but I have no idea where the other Safari window is (I'd have to guess).\nEDIT: What I really meant is a keyboard shortcut, instead of Mission Control.\n\nA: Just going into the main Mission control window will solve this, it will give a nice summary like view of all your open (fullscreen) windows. Another way to switch between fullscreen windows is selecting the \"Window\" menu item or the Safari icon in your dock and choosing the right window from there.\nEdit\nIf you want to use a keyboard shortcut to accomplish this you can use an application that binds a keyboard shortcut to an Apple script, like FastScripts. The next step is placing the script in your /Library/Scripts folder and adding a shortcut to the script in the FastScripts preferences. \nI'm not really good with Apple scripts, but this is a sort of working script that I made:\ntell application \"Safari\"\nactivate\nend tell\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"Safari\"\n        tell menu bar 1\n            tell menu bar item \"Venster\"\n                tell menu \"Venster\"\n                    click menu item 14\n                end tell\n            end tell\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nThe big problem with this script is this:\nThe line click menu item 14 will make the first window that you see when you click on the \"Window\" menu item active, and changing it to click menu item 15 will make the second window active. However, obviously, this isn't included in my code, and I don't have the time to work on it today, so you can either ask someone else how to do this or wait until tomorrow. \n\nA: I use TotalSpaces for this.  It gives you an unlimited number of virtual desktops (each can be multi-monitor) and easy keyboard and visual navigation between them.  It basically does gracefully what Mission Control fails to do (I've had Mission Control disabled for a long time thanks to TotalSpaces).\n", "Q: Modify Expose button on my macbook for another shortcut? The F3 button on my rMBP has a figure which shows 3 rectangles, pressing the button without the FN key initiates the Expose function. I want to modify that key for another function. However I cannot directly modify it via preferences because pressing that button does not register as a specific keyboard shortcut.\n\nA: You could also change it to a normal F-key with FunctionFlip.\n\nIf anyone else is looking for a way to change it with KeyRemap4MacBook, just create a private.xml like this:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n<item>\n<name>test</name>\n<identifier>test</identifier>\n<autogen>--KeyToKey-- KeyCode::EXPOSE_ALL, KeyCode::F19</autogen>\n</item>\n</root>\n\nThe keycode constants are defined in src/bridge/generator/keycode/data. The test folder has a checkbox.xml with all the predefined mappings.\n\nA: Take a look at KeyRemap4MacBook, it should do what you're looking for.\n", "Q: Keep changed app icon after app update? I had used CandyBar to change my Mail.app icon. After apply the 10.8.2 Supplemental Update 1, the Mail.app icon has reverted. How can I prevent that from happening in the future?\n\nA: When you update your OS - (if it contains a Mail.app update) it will replace the previous version of the app with the new one and by doing this it will also replace the icon file.\nAnyway something that you can try after you've replaced the icon again:\n1.Open Terminal and enter this command - sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.p/Contents/MacOS/Finder\n2.Enter your password and press Enter\n3.WITHOUT switching to other windows press CMD + TAB and select Finder\n4.Press CMD + N this will open a new Finder Window with root privileges (BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL WHAT YOU DO)\n5.Press CMD + G and enter /Applications/Mail.app/Contents/Resources\n6.Find the Mail.icns(it should be the new one you chose) file - Right Click it and select Get Info\n7.Check the Locked attribute.\n8.Go back to the terminal window and press CONTROL + C this will close the Finder Window.\nThis should prevent it from being overwritten\n\nCommand line alternative:\nsudo chflags uchg /pathToFile/filename\n", "Q: How To Upgrade Snow Leopard to Lion (not Mountain Lion) I couldn't find Mac OS X Lion in the App Store. Can I go from Snow Leopard to Lion without migrating to Mountain Lion?\nMany programs are now dropping support for Snow Leopard (newer XCode, newer fortran compilers, etc.), but I don't want Mountain Lion. Mountain Lion still lacks support for some software that I like (ex. Little Snitch).\nWhat are my (legal) options?\n\nA: Call Apple, 1-800-My-Apple and order Lion over the phone. \nThis is the only way to get it now. Apple will email you a code you use on the App store to download it.\nBTW - Little Snitch is Mountain Lion compatible now.  I highly recommend upgrading to Mountain Lion.\n\nA: Or visit a nearby Apple Store after making an appointment for the Genius desk.\nA friend of mine was offered to upgrade his machine - which is not able to run Mountain Lion - from 10.6 to 10.7 for free at the Genius desk in Amsterdam.\n", "Q: Brand New Macbook Pro (Mid 2012) already with 2 cycle counts Yesterday I unboxed a MacBook Pro (Mid 2012) and I am disappointed that the battery has less than its \"manufacturer capacity\" and has 2 cycles already.

I think it's normal and it's probably a part of the in-factory testing.\nAs for the manufacture capacity - it's perfectly normal for it to deteriorate, but it's going to do it gradually (and slowly if you take care of your battery)\nHow much capacity has it actually lost?\n\nA: I unboxed my new MacBook Pro (Mid 2012) yesterday and it have 0 cycle \nSo i don't think it's ok !\n(did you get the wizard(1st time configuration) when you open it !? )\n", "Q: How to prevent OS X from launching programs from another disk? I just did a fresh install of Mountain Lion on an empty partition. How can I prevent the programs of the previous install from being shown in the contextual menus in Finder ?  I already asked Spotlight not to index that partition, but I still have references to them in the Open With menus.\n\nA: Try rebuilding the launch services database using the lsregister command. That database provides the information for the open menu, etc as noted in How to rebuild the LaunchServices database  from Macworld's Mac OS X Hints. Rebuilding the launch service database while running from the newly installed partition should fix the problem of trying to open Applications on the other drive partition. \n\nIf your \"Open With\" menu shows applications that are no longer installed, or shows some of them as duplicates, you can use the following Terminal command to rebuild your LaunchServices database:\n\nFor OS X 10.6 and later run:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchSe‌​rvices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system\n\nFor OS X 10.5 and older run:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user\n\nIf the problem persists after running the above command, try un mounting your original partition before running the above command again. Additionally, as noted on the hints article and when running the lsregister  command with no arguments there is some helpful output that will allow further customization to specify where to look for Applications, etc.\n\nA: Is it possible for you to move them to another drive or remove them? If you really want to keep them on the drive that they're currently on you can also make them, or the folder that they're in into a .zip file. \nOr if it is just about specific applications that come up all the time in the Open With... menus, then this link will show you how to remove specific applications from the Open With menu.\n", "Q: Create partition on MacBook Air that isn't deleted during restore I have a 20gb file that I need to back up and I don't have an external drive or access to any high-capacity cloud storage but I need to format/reinstall OSX Lion on my MacBook Air. On Windows and Linux it's possible to make a partition and just ignore it when formatting/reinstalling but being as ML will get pulled down through the App Store I don't want to risk losing the file. So, my question is: How (if at all) can I make a partition that the OSX installation program won't delete when I format and reinstall OSX?\n\nA: Make second partition on the drive using Disk Utility and as long as you don't install to that partition, it will not get erased by an OS (re)install. \nYou should be able to live shrink your existing partition and create this new space at the end if the partition view of the disk. \n", "Q: 2 colors for one ical event Is it possible to put two colors, representing two people, for one event on iCal?\nFor example, if both my wife and I are included on a calendar event, I would like to see both her and my colors against the calendar event.\n\nA: No, the colors are linked to the calendar, and in iCal a calendar can only have one color. All events for this calendar will be in the same color.\nAlternatively, you could create a seperate calendar for shared events with a different color, and save the event there, or you can share each other's calendar so your wife's calendar appears in your calendar list with a different color.\n", "Q: IPFW: IP blocked, but still can get in I am using Fail2Ban to dynamically add rules to IPFW.

If I right click on a bookmark in my shortcuts, there are no options to modify it. Usually in other operating systems, you can change a bookmark with the right mouse button.\n(The only way I found out to modify them is via the main menu.)\n\nA: If you select 'Show All Bookmarks', the Bookmark Library will open.  You can then right-click there and change.\nYou are quite right in that you cannot right click a menu item in OS X and have it perform a secondary function (not in any of the major browsers anyway).\nSo the quick way to achieve what you want is - Shift-Command B to bring up the Bookmark Library.\n\nA: It seems like that behaviour was never been implemented in Firefox on OS X.\nSee this bug report. \nBut you can use Command ⌘+Shift ⇧+B to get to the bookmarks menu and there you can edit all bookmarks by right-clicking.\n", "Q: icon for iTunes 10.7/music missing from System Preferences in Snow Leopard My music/iTunes icon: \n\n\n*\n\n*is present in the Dock\n\n*has gone from some panes of System Preferences.\n\n\nThis first screenshot is from the Spotlight pane, the icon is expected to the left of Music: \n \nThe second shot is from the CDs & DVDs pane, the icon is expected to the left of Open iTunes: \n\nHow do I get these icons back?\nSystem:  \n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro\n\n*Snow Leopard 10.6.8\n\n\nWhat I tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*reboot\n\n*login/logout\n\n*trash Finder and Dock preference files\n\n\n\nEdit 1:\nThe output of the grep command suggested by Graham Perrin in the comments is as follows:\nLaptop:~ myname$ system_profiler SPApplicationsDataType | grep iTunes.app  \n      Location: /Applications/iTunes.app\n\nIn the Language & Text pane, three languages are present in the following order:\n\n\n*\n\n*British English\n\n*Dutch\n\n*Russian\n\n\nLogging into a fresh user account does not solve the issue.

The goal is to insulate a code base from potential problems with new port upgrades.\nSo maybe if a port upgrade outdated command can be amended not to use the freshest of the fresh ports, you can avoid tracking down errors in ports affecting your code.\nAs far as I see,  port info port_name doesn't have any extra release date options:\n$ port help info\nUsage: info --category --categories --depends_fetch --depends_extract --depends_build --depends_lib\n            --depends_run --depends --description --epoch --fullname --heading --homepage     --index --license --line\n            --long_description --maintainer --maintainers --name --platform --platforms --portdir --pretty\n            --replaced_by --revision --subports --variant --variants --version\n\nI suppose the best alternative to this is to perform daily incremental upgrades. Then when something breaks, it's easier to rollback since likely only a few ports will change per day.\n\nA: You could potentially monitor the SVN repo that all the Portfiles are distributed in to determine when last each port was changed.\nTake a look here: http://guide.macports.org/#development.local-repositories, and set up a local copy of the macports trunk. Once in a while go see what revision number (#####) was committed about a month ago, and svn upgrade -r #####\nMake sure you remove the default macports source, though:\n#rsync://rsync.macports.org/release/ports [default]\n\nClearly a different approach to where you were heading with the port command, but it would work.\n", "Q: iPhoto problem after upgrading to Mountain Lion I had an iMac running Snow Leopard. When I upgraded to Lion, iPhoto didn't recognize the photo database and I spent a year organizing it again. The error message I received was something like: \"iPhoto didn't recognize your backup\".\nI want to install Mountain Lion, but I am concerned that I will encounter the same problem again. What can I do to be sure everything will be work fine after installing Mountain Lion?\n\nA: Firstly, make a backup of the library.  At least you will have that in-case anything does go wrong.  \nThen make sure you update iPhoto to the latest version before you upgrade the Operating System.  \nFinally, repair your Disk Permissions using Disk Utility http://support.apple.com/kb/PH5821\nI've updated many times and never had iPhoto be affected by an OS upgrade.  Thats not to say it isn't possible.  The above steps will put you in the best shape to move forward.\nIf you upgrade and have an issue with the iPhoto database, hold down Command and Option keys whilst starting iPhoto to get a list of rebuild/recovery options.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: Upgrading the OS will make no difference to iPhoto. So, not sure what went wrong with your Lion upgrade.\nThe best and only protection against issues when you upgrade is a back up - or two, or three. By all means use Time Machine, but you can also make additional back ups just by dragging the Library to another disk.\n", "Q: How do I change the region on an Airport Express? I purchased two of the current model Airport Expresses while I was in the US a few months ago. Now that I'm back in Australia, the only options I have when setting the country in Wireless Options are in the Americas. How can I get the Airport Express to allow me to change the region to Asia-Pacific, which would allow me to select Australia as the Country?\nNote: The reason I want to set the Country is that I've been having reception problems, so I want to be able to ensure that my WiFi setup is running on the right channels for other \"Australian-configured\" WiFi gear.\n\nA: You need to do a firmware reset (factory default) – see http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3728\nBeforehand, ensure:\n\n\n*\n\n*the mac through which you will be setting up the Airport Express (ie by use of Airport Utility) is set to Australia in its preferences (e.g. on MacOS these are System Preferences/International/Format and System Preferences/Date & Time/Time Zone).\n\n*the Airport Express can connect to the internet within Australia, at the time of first set up after resetting the firmware back to factory defaults.\nI believe the firmware attempts to determine its location on first setup (either via the IP address it sees on initial connection, or off the computer), which it then writes into its firmware.\n", "Q: Stuck without admin account on a MacBook Air running 10.5.8 I did a backup on my MacBook Air as I had lost admin rights and thought my best option was to carry out a reinstallation with the original disc which I obtain on purchase would assist.\nWhen done, I loaded the updates etc, all was well until I restarted after some updates.\nI lost admin rights so only had limited access as visitor, cannot go back to reload the software as keeps asking admin password.\nTook my mac to BTOption supposedly Apple Authorized Service Provider (info@btoptions.com) in Colombo Sri Lanka, they are as stumped and as lost as I am, any suggestions greatly accepted.\nThey say I need the firmware password to reinstall the system.\n\nA: Learned something new today:  You can break the firmware password with help from Apple.\nhttp://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13727_7-57542601-263/efi-firmware-protection-locks-down-newer-macs/\nThis note says that Authorized Service Providers are equipped for that?  http://support.apple.com/kb/ts3554\n\nA: A Google search reveals this page, which lists several possible fixes.\n", "Q: Is it possible to migrate keyboard shortcuts for all my applications via an export? I have a bunch of keyboard shortcuts setup for Pages, Keynote, and several other programs. Is there a way to export and then import these shortcuts? I just reformatted my home computer and am now going through the painful process of re-creating all the shortcuts. \nPaul Irish's dotfiles got me thinking about this: https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles\n\nA: It depends on how you have defined the shortcut keys. The files responsible for storing these preferences are in the usual place: ~/Library/Preferences\nYou could simply move the files that store the preferences over to the new Mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist\n\n*com.apple.universalaccess.plist\n\n*com.apple.iWork.Keynote.plist\n\n*com.apple.iWork.Pages.plist\n\n\nIf you were good at parsing JSON or XML, you could do the export to a text file as well using the plutil tool.\n\nA: The shortcuts for sandboxed applications are stored in ~/Library/Containers/*/Data/Library/Preferences/*.plist. The shortcuts for all applications are in ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist. You could probably just copy the preference files from the old account.\nI use a shell script like this to configure the shortcuts in the old-style property list format. You can print the current settings with defaults read.\ndefaults write -g NSUserKeyEquivalents '{\n\"Back\" = \"@\\UF702\";\n\"Go Back\" = \"@\\UF702\";\n\"Forward\" = \"@\\UF703\";\n\"Go Forward\" = \"@\\UF703\";\n\"Minimize\" = \"\\0\";\n}'\n\ndefaults write com.apple.finder NSUserKeyEquivalents '{\n\"Show Package Contents\" = \"@\\r\";\n}'\n\n\nA: The above answer is too complicated.  With Keynote 9 (v 5.3) and Mountain Lion, and assuming that the format bar is visible, you can simply define a key in Keyboard Shortcuts panel of the Keyboard System Preference:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select \"Application Shortcuts\", and click the + icon\n\n*Select the Keynote application.\n\n*For the Menu Title type the font name exactly as it appears in the format bar.  I entered \"Times New Roman\".  \n\n*Type the shortcut key (I used Option+Command+R).\n\n*Quit Keynote and restart it.\n\n*Select some text and type the shortcut key.  The font will change to Times New Roman.\n\n", "Q: Safari does not remember my settings I am using Safari 6.0.1 on OS X 10.8.2 and Safari does not remember my toolbar arrangement or other setting like the default search engine, homepage, etc.\n\nA: It seems like there is something wrong with your Safari preferences file, try trashing it. (It is located in your ~/Library/Preferences, press Command ⌘+Shift ⇧+G in Finder and paste ~/Library/Preferences in the text box to open that folder, search for 'safari' and trash the .plist file)\n\nA: Apple support solved the problem for me. There is nothing wrong with the Safari preference files. In my case the com.apple.Safari.plist file was blocked.\nTry this step by step:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Finder window click 'Go' then Option key to open Library\n\n*In Library highlight Preferences folder, then right click 'Get Info'\n\n*If under General you see Locked with a tick, this is your problem.\n\n*To unlock, open lock in the bottom right hand corner of the Preferences info box using your username\n\n*Click on the plus sign to add your name to get read and writing privileges\n\n*Untick Locked.\n\n\nIn my case when I reopened Safari it had all the features I had tried to save before without success. \nOne final important point. The way you select the home page in Safari preferences is to first open Safari in your chosen page, THEN go to Safari preferences and select \"Set to current page\". For some reason if you type in your chosen page in Preferences it doesn't work.\n", "Q: How can I right click on a Mac using only the trackpad in a dual-boot environment? I am absolutely new to Mac OS and can't determine hot to issue a right click on my Mac. If I want a shortcut menu to appear I can ctrl + click to get the same effect or I can use an old mouse that has two buttons.\nHow would I right click if I don't have a mouse and I have only track pad and my laptop is dual boot with Windows or Linux?\n\nA: If you have a MacBook Air you can \"right-click\" by placing two fingers on your trackpad and clicking with one of them. Of course this work when you are using OS X.\nYou can configure this option (if it isn't already configured) by going to Settings > Trackpad > Secondary click\nIf you are using Windows with Boot Camp instead, you should install the additional driver provided by Apple. They should allow you to right-click in the same way you do it on OS X.\n\nA: After installing Windows in an early 2008 MacBook Pro, I could not do a right click with the Trackpad. I did the following:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Downloaded Bootcamp 4.0.425  \n\n*Extracted the files\n\n*Looked inside the folder Drivers > Apple > x64 \n\n*Double-clicked on AppleTrackpadInstaller64.  \n\n\nThat installed the correct Trackpad driver. I just finished setting up windows 10 on a early 2008 Macbook Pro.  But first I downloaded and installed Bootcamp 6.x.x. \n\nA: With the new Boot Camp you'll need to enable this feature.  By default right clicking is actually disabled.  You'll find it under Control Panel ==> System and Security ==>  Boot Camp  ==> Track pad.

I don't have iTunes Gift Cards readily available in my country.\n\nA: Thanks for documenting the current state of play. Although most can buy gift cards from the store of your choice and load them into the App Store, if they truly are not easily available in your country just slowing down the cycling of cards you use for payment is the obvious choice out of this dilemma.\n\nA: If all you want to do is get that one app, perhaps you could ask somebody to gift it to you.  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201783\n", "Q: iMessage on iPad with 2 iPhone numbers Is it possible to use two different iPhone numbers for receiving iMessages on my iPad?\n\nA: I had the same issue but after signing out of imessage on my ipad and disabling imessage on my ipad, when i reenabled imessage on my ipad, the option to use my phone number appeared.\n\nA: Your iPad would only be able to receive iMessages through an email account. Normally it will default to your Apple ID, however you can add multiple email accounts to receive messages on through iMessage through Settings > Messages > Send&Receive > Add Another Email. \nUse the same AppleID/email account(s) for receiving messages on both phones and you will receive all iMessages sent to those accounts. \nAlthough the iPad does not have the option of receiving iMessages from specific phone numbers, I have tested sending a message from someone else's iMessage (OsX Mountain Lion) directly to my phone number and it showed up both on my iPad as well as on my iPhone. Both are on iOS 6. \n", "Q: how to re-mount USB drive \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I mount ejected external USB flash storage? \n\nSo, I plugged a USB drive.\nThen ejected it.\nBut it's still connected to my machine.\nis there a way to force a re-connect and avoid having to plug it out and plug it in again?\nSame goes to a password protected volume on my SSD or HD. It asks me for a password. I cancel. As a result the volume is not mounted. Is there any way to force it to ask me again without rebooting?\n\nA: For the USB, you will have to go to the extreme trouble of plugging it out, and then back in i'm afraid\nFor the SSD, you could try and open up disk utilities, and the volume should be greyed out on the left, all you need to do, it select the volume, then click the mount button on the top. I have done that with a volume on my MBP, but it might be different for a password-protected drive.\nHope this helps!\nRory Costello\n", "Q: AppleScript/Automator Workflow to restore OS X to \"mint\" condition Under Mountain Lion, I wanted to create an AppleScript that would essentially restore my OS X install to \"mint\" condition, if possible even to the point of showing you the ML welcome screen asking you for your name and timezone, yet preserving the apps I have installed, but remove any settings, configurations, or state. (I wanted to create an image I can re-use later with out any of the temp files, settings, or customizations). \nIs this or something close-to possible?\n\nA: I don't know what I keep on forgetting about Automator. Excellent idea.\nYou can try removing a setup file to flag configuration:\nin\n/var/db\n\n--w----r--   1 root        wheel             0  1 Nov 12:51 .AppleSetupDone\n\nRemove that file and I believe that the setup will happen next boot.\nBy the way, I think you might want to look into the system image tool\nman asr\n\nHere we have a slightly different way of looking at imaging, possible since Lion.\nYMMV, of course.\nEDIT: \nAlso, you could just create a new user.\nThat user will have default preferences. \ndefaults domains\n\nwill give you the pristine preferences, space delimited.\nAny of your old user's prefs that are not in the set of the new user prefs should be the ones you want to get rid of.\nAlso, you can run \ndefaults read\n\non the new user and save that to a file.

When using disk utility to verify/repair permissions (or verify/repair the disk itself), I've never been clear whether I should perform operations on the disk (\"WDC WD1200BEVE-00WZT0\" in my case) or on the volume nested beneath it (\"MacintoshHD\"), or both. I usually do both, but is this necessary?\n\nA: It can't hurt to repair permissions on your actual disk, but it is quite unnecessary, because \"Macintosh HD\" contains the actual operating system, so the stuff that you want to repair. \n", "Q: Can I screen share an OS X computer to several viewers over VNC? I want to give a demo to people remotely. I want them to be able to use any VNC client to view my current Mac desktop. Can I use the built-in screen sharing features to do that? I'm using Mountain Lion (10.8.2). I don't want to set up a special \"guest\" account. I don't want to share my account password with them. Everything I try under \"Screen Sharing\" gives the VNC user a Mac login screen, and doesn't connect to the existing desktop. When I enable the \"remote management feature\" it connects directly to the existing session with full control. I don't want all the viewers of my demo to have full control of the desktop, although that may be an acceptable work-around.\n(Note: I posted this on superuser.com, and I think it should go here instead, but I don't know how to \"move\" it.)\n\nA: To the best of my knowledge the answer to your question is 'No'. I do the same thing and I use GoToMeeting or GoToWebinar. They are commercial products that cost money but they work really well. (I'm not affiliated in any way... I just use their products). I give demos all the time with GoToMeeting. The monthly fee was totally reasonable for what I do.\n", "Q: How can I enable Mountain Lion Spellcheck in Google Chrome? Chrome's spellcheck has become cumbersome as of the new auto-correct spell check in Mountain Lion. I love that I don't have to go to the mouse and use a context menu for spell-checking---EXCEPT IN CHROME. \nIs there any way to replace Chrome's spellcheck with Mountain Lion's?\n\nA: Spell check is a system service so by using the standard Mac control for a text box, chrome would magically get to use the service. \nSince chrome isn't programmed to use the standard control (they wrote their own implementation) - you would need to either get the chrome devs to change the code or you would need to change it yourself and re-compile your version of Chrome. Both are likely to involve a serious amount of engineering since the code base is quite complex.\n", "Q: Is it legal to install a personal copy of Final Cut Pro X on my work computer? I work at a private school, but also do freelance video work on the side. I own a copy of Final Cut Pro X through the App Store, and was curious if it were legitimate for me to install this on the computer that I control at the school. \nIn Apple's Terms and Conditions, there is a specific line that states the following:\n\nThe Final Cut Pro X license agreement states that you are granted a limited non-exclusive license to install and use the Apple Software only on Apple-branded computers that you own or control in accordance with the Mac App Store Product Usage Rules located at http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/ww/ (\"Mac Usage Rules\"). Except as permitted under the Mac Usage Rules, you may not distribute or make the Apple Software available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time.\n\nThe software would only be used by myself and would exist only on the computer that is primarily controlled by me.\nThanks for any help you can provide!\n\nA: You need a lawyer to decode the legality of a license coupled with the local and state and national laws where you live.\nAs far as decoding the licensing terms - focus on who purchased the app in Apple's eyes. If you as a consumer (non-commercial use) bought the app, then I would say you are totally in the clear installing it on computers you control especially if others are not using the computers you control and that software at the same moment as you are and if you don't lease out that app or sell/rent it. If you have 15 macs at home and one at work, there is nothing I see in the EULA that says you can't install Final Cut Pro on all of them for your sole use.\n\nA: Apple Legal Issue:  Should be OK\nAs noted from the original posters Apple's Terms and Conditions quote it looks like installing Final Cut Pro X on your work computer that you control is allowed by Apple. \n\nThe Final Cut Pro X license agreement states that you are granted a limited non-exclusive license to install and use the Apple Software only on Apple-branded computers that you own or control in accordance with the Mac App Store Product Usage Rules located at http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/ww/ (\"Mac Usage Rules\"). Except as permitted under the Mac Usage Rules, you may not distribute or make the Apple Software available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time.\n\nSo you will probably not have anyone contacting you from Apple Legal, however I am no lawyer so thats the best that I can say on it. \nEmployer Legal Issue: ??? (Depends on your employers policies, most employers would not want their employees using their hardware for other work.)\nNow, the other gray area to consider is how your employer intends for you to use their hardware. They may not allow or want you to install software or use their computer for side work that's not contributing to their bottom line. So I would check with your employer and ask them if you can use their computer for side work. They may not want you mixing a personal business with their educational business, especially doing so on their hardware dime. Consequences of missing this point could be sever like being fired,  so do make sure that you are not violating your user agreement and terms of use for an employer owned computer.\nSo after legally verifying that you are ok on those two fronts you should be ok to install Final Cut Pro in a completely legitimate fashon. \n\nA: You can legally install FCPX on your work computer - just don't make it available for installation on other computers by sharing it on a network. If you are concerned about installing it on your machine @ work, ask the IT department. Since you run a self-managed machine, I can't see they would deny you unless they have specific regulations in their AUP about installing non-sanctioned software. Should your school use FCPX in other locations, you may be able to bypass the 'sanctioned software' aspect of the AUP.\nI also do freelance video-editing and work 8-5 at a private school. I have a personal copy of FCPX on my work machine. I use it when occasional video-editing tasks for my job require something more robust than iMovie, which is pretty damned good for most tasks.\nLastly, don't forget to wipe FCPX (and any other personal software) from the machine when you get the call from Hollywood!\n", "Q: Swap Hard Disks Is it in principle possible to swipe the hard disk out of a MacBook, swipe a new (blank) hard disk in, install the OS on the new disk, then swipe the old disk back in and find the machine operational again?\nI would like to tinker with a new hard disk (bootcamp and perhaps rEFIt), but if that fails, I'd like to continue from the installation I have right now.\nEdit Clearly, the hard disk will be unchanged. My question is whether the process of installing OS X / bootcamp will change something (SMC, PRAM, ...?) that makes the machine incompatible with the previous installation.\n\nA: Yes, certainly. Removing the original drive will leave it exactly as it was before. \n\nA: On the first boot after changing a drive it may take an extra couple of seconds for the new boot destination to be written to the PRAM, but it won't cause any issues. \n", "Q: Can I link two different kinds of Macs each using different OSes? Is it possible to link (run as one machine) my G5 PowerPC OSX 10.4.6 machine to my G5 INTEL running OSX 10.6.x or higher simultaneously? I want to run differing versions of OS X, and be able to use my Classic apps while still keeping up with Flash Player requirements. How can this be done?\n\nA: You can't really join seamlessly two separate macs, and have it all just work out of the box, eg having one Intel based Mac that can run the Lastest OS's and One older PowerPC Mac that can run all the Classic OS's and have it all work at the same time  merged into a single OS where all apps just run together.  Something like that may be theoretically possible but it has never been done, and would require Apples full support to do so. \nSo in other words Paying someone to port your old classic software to  the latest version of OS X would probably be less expensive than the solution necessary for merging two independent operating systems and architectures into one, so lets not even go there any further. \nThe good news is that there are options that will allow you to independently connect two macs or emulate a classic mac enviroment within an Intel mac.\nOptions: \n\n\n*\n\n*Just use both computers (each is working fine why mess with that) and connect them to make it work for you.\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect them physically and use each one directly. What you could do is get a KVM and an extra monitor to share between them.  A KVM would let you switch one USB keyboard, USB mouse, and monitor between the two Macs at the touch of a button or keyboard stroke. Additionally, the  second monitor could be used as constant output, for example it could be showing video content as a second display from the Intel Mac while you are working on your Classic Apps on the Power PC Mac on the KVM connected / active screen.\n\n*Another solution would be to network your two Macs onto the same network and then enable screen sharing or VNC on the Power PC mac and then connect to the Power PC from the Intel Mac, effectively giving you a picture in picture view to your older Power PC mac while working within the Intel Mac. \n\n\n*Use only the newer computer and find an emulation solution to run your legacy classic application on the Intel Mac. For more information on emulating classic on Intel macs see How to run Classic (pre OS X) apps on Intel Macs \n\n\n*\n\n*Sheepshaver seems to be the goto solution for emulating Classic OS, so if your software can work within \"MacOS 7.5.2 thru 9.0.4\" than this should be able to do it for you.\n\n\n", "Q: Select and drag text on Mac OS X 10.6 doesn't allow me to drag I have just been enlightened on what I previously thought was a short-coming of the whole Mac OS X platform - that like Windows, a user may select a block of text and drag it. This is particularly useful in developing.\nHowever, the reason I thought it wasn't an available option was because it has never worked for me. No programs allow for select and drag, and I've gone through several online tutorials and forums to see if anybody else has the same issue. None of my work-mates can figure it out.\nWhy would my whole system dis-allow text dragging? Now that I know it's possible, it's driving me crazy not being able to do it.\nI've gone through the System Preferences and the Mouse panel has no specific drag option. Trackpad has a single-finger drag option, but that's not allowing dragging, even with the trackpad.\nI'm on a Macbook Pro, from around 2008. I'm using an external mouse and running OS 10.6.\nEdit: apparently, the cursor should change when holding the mouse button for a second or two, but on my system, the cursor never changes, no matter how long I hold the mouse button down.\n\nA: As far as I know there's no preference to enable this, it's just a built-in feature with no on/off switch.\nMy best advice is to make sure that you hold down the mouse before starting to drag the text. There's some delay built in such that if you try to drag too quickly, you'll just end up selecting more text.\nThe process that works for me is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the text you want, then release the mouse button.\n\n*Left-click and hold on the selection for a second.\n\n*Drag the text to wherever you want it.\n\n\nThe holding before dragging is the key.\nI made a quick screencast to demonstrate how this works for me on 10.7.5.\n\nA: It does not work in most apps so I have to copy-paste into Notes, then I can drag and drop after 1 sec. to my desktop if I want to create a text clip. \n\nA: Since Lion (OSX 10.7) you need to enable this in \n\nAccessibility Preferences -> Mouse & Trackpad -> Trackpad Options -> Enable dragging.\n\nUsing \"drag lock\" means that you can continue to adjust the drag, finishing it with a single tap. Without a drag lock, the drag operation will finish if you stop dragging for a short time.\n", "Q: Route all traffic to a particular domain/subdomain without VPN I'm using OpenVPN through Viscosity.\nIs it possible to set it up in such a way that all traffic would go through the VPN, except traffic to a domain I'd specify (and all its subdomains, etc.)?\nSo only that one domain I'd specify would not use the VPN.\n\nA: You'll want to add a static route to addresses you want, specifying the first hop in the chain, which can be an IP address or network device.\nHere is a related question that involves establishing the static route at boot time.\nSetting a static route every boot with launchd / plist is failing\n", "Q: Shortcut to Clean up folder by Name? I would like to create a keyboard shortcut to Clean Up Folder by Name. Which can be done by right-click > Clean up by > Name \nWhat is the Automator code needed to achieve this ?\n\nA: On my Mac (running 10.7 Lion), there's already a default shortcut for this, ⌥⌘1 (optioncommand1). You can access the Clean Up By menu under the Finder's View menu, which will show the shortcuts assigned:\n\nNote that this option is only available on the Desktop or a Finder window in Icons mode (not List, Column or Cover Flow modes).\nIf you don't have shortcuts assigned by default, you can add them in the Application Shortcuts section of Keyboard Preferences.\n", "Q: How can one determine which user deleted a shared file on OS X Mountain Lion Server My girlfriend is a lab technician at a small pharmaceutical startup. She created a very important Excel file and placed it in a shared folder on a server that the \"IT\" guy set up. The server runs Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8.2).\nLast week, this important file went missing from this particular folder. There were several other files in this folder, but they didn't go missing.\nShe has since been able to recover the file from Time Machine, but wants to know how that file went missing. She assures me that no one in her department is careless enough to delete the file, but perhaps a higher-up with access to the shared file either accidentally moved/deleted the file (or did so deliberately due to the file's contents).\nThe issue here, is that due to a power struggle within the company, she suspects that someone may have attempted to sabotage (delete or move) this critical file which had data that could move the company forward faster in a particular direction than certain saboteurs would like.\nThe \"IT\" guys doesn't know much about server logs, etc. And I'm not a Mac expert. My question is this:\nIs there a way to find out who deleted or moved this critical file? Are there file change logs located somewhere on the server that could \"prove\" this action?\n\nA: Yes - by default, file deletions are logged along with many other important file sharing events.\nInstall the Server app on any Mac (or log into the server to run the app there or inspect the log file locally).\n\nSelect logs on the left, select AFP Access Log on the bottom and search for the word Delete. Once you've found the file deletion you care about, note the IP address and timestamp. Then search backwards in this log to see what user logged in using that IP immediately prior to that delete event.\nYou might also seek professional help if you want a forensic analysis rather than performing it yourself. Anyone that can look at the logs can change the logs and how you use this knowledge is more of a social problem than a technical problem. There should be Time Machine or better backups of the server shares, so you should be able to trivially determine the times files are deleted there as well with tools like Backup Loupe and hopefully you find that someone was careless rather than deliberate. Either way, OS X server has sufficient logging to determine a file access oddity if it came from a user that connected to the share as opposed to logging in directly to the server and deleting the file. That event would need additional auditing and logging, but I would start with analyzing the AFP access log since that's normally how files are accessed from a server.\n\nA: I am not computer savvy but I've learned a couple things which I'd be happy to share in case they help someone in the future.\nIf you're using a Mac server you should try screen sharing from your computer to the server and open the program called \"Console\" and check the logs between the time you last saw the file on the server (need to know the day and the TIME) and the first time you noticed the file missing. In \"Console\" you can see all the user's actions and what they've done on the server based on each computer's individual IP address.\nYou will have to go around to everyone's computer to find out their IP addresses, if you're all using Macs, open \"System Preferences\" and click on \"Network\" to see the Mac user's IP address. I'm not sure how to find IP addresses on Windows PC computers.\nIt takes a bit of sleuthing but you really need to know the time frames to help narrow down the search in the logs as there can be literally millions of tasks recorded in Console, also, you only have a certain amount of time before Console's history is no longer visible in the logs, so it is important to act fast and save a copy of the logs so you have proof of possible mischief.\nBest to bring in an IT expert (someone you trust) to help you analyze the data and to help back up your claim of sabotage to your supervisor.\nGood luck out there people!\n", "Q: Safari Auto Fill problem At some point I misspelled my name when I typed in my email address to one of the those log in boxes.\nNow the misspelling always comes up and fills in and I have to delete it and start over. \nI have tried clearing history and cookies and the auto fill feature but it still happens.\nHow can I clear this and why will it not use my correct one after I type it in.\n\nA: You can edit all of your AutoFill information under Safari / Preferences / AutoFill. \nAs your issue is with your contact information, you can, even, change it directly from your card in the Address Book application, as there is where it gets this information from.\n", "Q: How can I get iTunes to use a library on an external HD? I've configured iTunes to use a library on an external drive by going to Preferences > Advanced and setting the \"iTunes media folder location\".

I would like to import the locations from a csv file or kml file and see all the locations at once.\nBest: The app interprets the csv or kml and forwards me to the iOS native maps app with all the pins placed. This way I can use flyover mode and have a completely native map solution. \nNext best: The app plots the points inside the app, but using Apple's API. (Flyover would be great, but I'm not sure that is possible.)\nAcceptable, if I have to: Uses some kind of custom maps. I have found Galileo and arcGIS.\n\nA: There's quite a few applications for iOS that support GPX track information, which you could probably use to sort of meet your needs. I won't list them all, as there's quite a few (free and paid), with various focuses on walking/riding/hiking or photography (for geotagging images).\nI've used GeoTagr (formerly GeoLogTag) for quite a while for generating GPX files for geotagging photos. I believe you can copy GPX files in/out of it also, via iTunes (actually various methods to get the files out), but there are quite likely apps that make that process easier (try the ones designed for walking trails if you want easier import).\nAgain, there's many more, with many different features, so just do a search for GPX on the iTunes App Store and see what suits your needs (and let us know if any in particular suited your needs!).\nSomething like Trails Lite GPS Tracker or EasyTrails GPS Lite might be more appropriate as they're designed to import GPX track files also, to let you follow the trail. I see no iOS6 Apple Maps flyover screenshots, but that's pretty new so I'm not sure if it'll just come natively since they use the native iOS Maps API, or if they'd need to be modified to support such things.\nMaps+ is another interesting one, which supports trails and bookmarking points (you'd probably need the paid version though). This one specifically uses the Google Maps data, apparently even with iOS 6. This includes elevation maps, which may be useful for tracks.\nThe caveat is most of these types of apps require you to use GPX files, which may or may not be a downside for you, depending on the current format of your data points. It's a reasonably common format though, and I'm pretty sure things like Google Earth can produce GPX files.\nThere's really quite a lot to choose from though, many with free \"light\" versions to test out...\n\nA: Have you tried BatchGeo? I just have, and I'm quite pleased with the results. $99/month for the pro version is a bit hefty (for me) but the free tools are more than adequate for my purposes.\n\nA: This question is a bit old but things change rapidly on the App Store. \nFull Disclosure: I may have had a hand in the development of the following app ;)\nHave you tried PointPlot on the App Store?\nIt should do what you are asking, and it exports in a number of formats. You can open files of the following formats: KML, GPX, GeoJSON and its own native format. \nThere is a free version called iBuildMapAR so you can try it out. Some of the features you get with PointPlot ($0.99) get unlocked with an in app purchase\n", "Q: MacBook Pro CD burning is not permanent I am trying to burn a bootable CD to update my harddisk firmware.

On the network, it is in the DMZ. The rest of the computers in the network use an internal 10.0.0.x IP.\nI have OS X Server's VPN set to give clients IPs in the internal network, and it seems to give the client the IP (connecting on my iPad and checking the connection status shows this), but I can't access anything on the local network or internet while connected. On a Windows 7 client, I get a \"No Internet acccess\" or \"No network access\" error.\nI should also note that when I select IPs to give to clients in the VPN settings pane of Server, a slide-down dialog notifies me that there is an \"Unknown Network In Range\". I have the range set to 10.0.0.120 to 10.0.0.130.\nEDIT: I should clarify why I have the machine DMZ'd. I have done this because Server wouldn't allow me to set up Open Directory without the host/domain name I had set linking to the iMac's IP, and because my router's port forwarding is rather awful. I should also note that I have enabled the firewall to keep things safe.\n\nA: You have an iMac setup as a server, and it is DMZ'd?  Probably a very bad idea.  VPN provides protection.  With it in DMZ mode, all you need is Apple Remote Desktop and it's much faster.  Albeit, much less protected.  \nI'd UN DMZ that machine, and setup a proper VPN.  \n", "Q: Would it be possible to create a folder action that can push timed Notifications?

I've tried everything and I've checked Send & Receive and it won't even let me click on my phone number as an option. It also says \"waiting for activation\", under the option of turning iMessage on. How do I fix it to where it says my phone number and not my email?\n\nA: I've found the best solution to these iMessage and Face Time woes is to just turn the service off, then back on again. That causes it to re-activate with Apple's servers, which should register your phone number as a usable iMessage sender.\nThe \"Waiting for Activation\" message suggests that this process wasn't completed properly, and/or there's some issue with Apple's servers. Try toggling it, and if it still doesn't work, try it again later, as it may be a server side issue that you need to wait for Apple to resolve.\n\nA: I fixed the issue I had following this method using iTunes:\nFix for iMessage and FaceTime (YouTube) \n", "Q: Help in finding files (.vimrc) in Mac I've made a mistake of moving my .vimrc file from my home directory and now I don't know how I'm able to locate it.

I have tried the System Preferences -> Sharing -> Files Sharing option but it does not seem to get connected to my windows, it says the connection could not be established.\nPlease help me get over this frustrating compatibility issue.\n\nA: If the folder is shared from Windows and is accessible from other Windows machines then it should be accessible from your Mac as well. There are two possible causes to the problem you are describing:\n\n\n*\n\n*You are using OS X 10.8.0 and you are trying to connect to smb://<machine> instead of smb://<machine>/<share>. If this is the case then the solution is to connect to smb://<machine>/<share>.\n\n*You are using any version of OS X and you are trying to connect to smb://<machine>/<share>. If this is the case then you probably aren't entering the username correctly. On your Mac when connecting to a Windows file share you should try entering the username as WORKGROUP\\<username>. (Case may matter)\n\n\nNOTE: I got into the habit of always entering the username in that format way back in OS X 10.3 (maybe even earlier.)

The actual image would not be remembered by the app and would thus be obscure to any brute force attacker. This should work well, because its quite natural for many images, etc., to be stored and accessed on mobile devices. The app should still encrypt the key ring, and it should be careful about not creating a suspicious signal when placing encrypted content in the carrier medium. \nCall it a steganographic key ring (or key chain; similar to a steganographic file system) then. My question is: Does such an app (already) exist?\n\nA: A quick search reveals a range of steganography software and solutions for Mac.\nThe following all appear on the first page of results:\n\n\n*\n\n*iSteg\n\n*SilentEye\n\n*Stegosec\nAs @patrix mentions, security through obscurity provides little security.

I recently did a clean install/upgrade to Mac OS 10.8.2. I did a final update of my ongoing Time Machine Backup and verified Disk Integrity. After reinstalling and restoring my files, I have learned that some of my files and file changes are missing from the Backup.\nOne of the reasons for doing a clean install is that I have been having strange FSEvents failures for some time. If I would write a file from the terminal and then double-click that file in the Finder, I got a -43 File Not Found error until I reload the Finder window (leave and revisit that folder).\nI believe Time Machine relies on the same FSEvents subsystem to detect file changes. Just as the Finder cannot see the new files, the Time Machine doesn't bother to back them up.\nCan anyone confirm this theory? I need to better understand what is happening here so I can go about recovery. In other words, the data loss is silent, affecting an unknown subset of files, going back and unknown and possibly variable length of time. I am trying to diagnose the extent of the damage.\n\nA: Yes.\nIt is known that FSEvents is the basis for Time Machine, and in fact Spotlight indexing as well before that.\nIn both cases, it acts as a tripwire for the relevant parts of your system, so that Time Machine knows what it needs to back up and Spotlight knows what it needs to index.\nHowever, using FSEvents for backups does leave a tiny bit of room for error, as you have probably discovered. This old post from the Apple mailing lists details another idiosyncrasy.\nFseventer is a brilliant little app that can help you delve into the FSEvents world if you are interested.\nAt the end of the day, Time Machine isn't really considered professional-grade. It's brilliant for what it is, and I still use it, but I highly recommend pairing it with something like a weekly full disk clone (off-site if possible) for a more comprehensive backup strategy.\n", "Q: Alert time discrepancies when synchronizing calendars between iOS 6 and OS X 10.8 Mac running OS X 10.8.2 and iPhone running iOS 6. There is an issue synchronizing the alert times of events created on Calendar. Both devices are set so that the default alert times are 30 min before the start of the event.\nWhen creating an event on the iPhone, with alert (say 5 minutes before the start) which is different than the default 30 min, after synchronizing it appears on the computer with alert time equal to the default (30 min before start) and not the 5 min as created on the iPhone.\nWhen creating an event on the computer, with alert (say 15 min before start) which is different than the default 30 min before start; after synchronizing, it appears on the iPhone with two alerts, one equal to the created on the computer (15 min) and another, equal to the default (30 min).\nIn both cases, after synchronizing, the alert time stays as created on the device on which the event was created. After the second synchronization, nothing changes on either device, although there is discrepancy between the alert times on both devices. In iTunes, the checkbox in front of Calendars in \"Replace information on this iPhone\" is unchecked.\nI am not sure if this started after upgrading to iOS 6 or OS X 10.8, as I upgraded within 1-2 weeks and didn't notice the exact time when the problem started, but the problem didn't exist with iOS 5.1.1 and OS X 10.7.\nAny ideas how to fix that?\nEdit: iTunes either via USB or Wi-Fi is used for synchronizing. Nothing in the settings has changed since upgrading the computer to 10.8 and the iPhone to iOS 6 (at least not changed by me, the new versions of the operating systems may have changed something).\n\nA: Assuming you can still reproduce this on the current version of iOS and OS X, this would be a great bug report to get engineering to fix whatever is causing the data to not sync.\nYou only need a free developer account to submit the bug report:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/bugreporter/\nIt looks from your description that you're not making any configuration mistakes, but I'd re-do both account setup steps before filing a bug to be sure your case is reproducible. \n", "Q: Creating boot disk for Windows 7 on MacBook Pro EDIT: I gave in and burned the DVD from a windows PC and I was able to install Windows on my MacBook Pro with Bootcamp. Sorry, that I don't have a satisfying solution.\nMy goal is to install Windows 7 (32-bit) on my MacBook Pro (late 2007) with Boot Camp. (I'm trying to do all this on Mountain Lion.) I am running into multiple problems creating the disk image for Windows 7. I have an ISO file of the Windows 7 DVD. I am fairly certain, that the ISO image is not corrupted. I downloaded it twice, with the DreamSpark download manager, with the same results.\nInitially I tried to create a bootable USB key. The USB key is formatted as Mac OS Extended (HFS+). I opened Disk Utility, went to the restore tab, chose the ISO as source and the USB key as destination. The following errors occurred:\n\n\n*\n\n*When the ISO-image is unmounted: \"RESTORE FAILURE Could not validate source - Invalid argument\"\n\n*When the ISO-image is mounted: \"RESTORE FAILURE Could not validate source - error 254\"\n\n\nAfter repeating this a dozen times, I tried solve the problem from the Terminal as suggested in many forums:\n$ sudo asr restore -noverify -source /path/to/windows/windows_7.iso -target /Volumes/Untitled/ -erase\n    Validating target...done\n    Validating source...\nCould not validate source - Invalid argument\n\nSince this also didn't work, I then tried to burn the image on a DVD.

We are in the process of assembling iPad kiosks.\nWe are not writing an iOS app, iPad will just have a bookmark to a web application that will be hosted on our server. As far as the user is concerned, he won’t be able to really tell if it is an app or a website.\nWe need to be able to read membership numbers from a membership card, which is just a plastic card with magnetic stripe on it. I am told that to be able to use any swiper I need to write some custom code, but we are not writing any code, we are just pointing to the website.\nIs there a plug and play swiper? Maybe I can write some simple iPad app which will run on the background and will be able to accept input from the swiper and pass it to Safari, so webapp can get it? Hope it makes sense.\n\nA: No, there is no way you can do that. Apps can’t pass input to each other. Though there is a method which can be modified to do that, it definitely doesn’t suit you.

Unfortunately things which I add on Snow Leopard I am unable to see on Mountain Lion.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it some common issue, which could be easily fixed?\n\n*Or can I fix it at least as make it visible on Mountain Lion?\n\n\nI am syncing the keychains over Google Drive. I've considered the problem could be in the way Google Drive is syncing that, but it also happens when I copy it over Samba and replace the keychain on another machine.\n\nA: A lot of processes will keep the keychain open, and may not realize that it has been replaced by another keychain.

(Which won't work well with dropbox.)\nYou might want to investigate something else like Keychain2Go which knows about the contents of keychains and makes sure to sync in a fashion that works while other things have it open.\n\nA: Sounds like your Mac has permissions issues.  WHile the transfer through Google Drive would strip the permissions like using an external drive would, it's not working, causing things not to properly be transferred.

I would like to speedup the roaming of Macs (and maybe other devices).\nIs there a setting on the Airport base stations or in Mac OS to speedup AP switching for example?\nCurrently the network is built around 1 main Switch interconnecting 1 router and 4 Airport base stations using the same SSID:\n\n\n*\n\n*3 dual band Airport base stations\n\n*1 Airport 2.4GHz base station\n\n\nOn the 5GHz band, there is no overlap as each base station uses its own channel. \nOn the 2.4GHz band there is a very slight overlap between 2 base stations which are at opposite sides and at different stories of the building.\n\nA: Apple has introduced roaming across it's ecosystem with iOS 8 and OS X 10.10. You don't need to do anything as it's turned on by default. So, you can just update your OS on the Airport basestations as well as install Yosemite to take advantage of the changes.\nPrior Yosemite, I've not seen instructions on how to enable this so I believe it's part of the drivers that were updated for 10.10.\nThe software was designed to keep a fair connection alive as long as possible rather than hop around always looking for a better connection. Now that AirPlay and AirDrop and continuity exploit the MIMO antennas that are shipping across the Apple hardware ecosystem, we now get better roaming since the hardware is more capable.\n\nA: I faced a similar problem (slow roaming - or no roaming at all) even with OSX 10.10.x - I have 2 AP, one Technicolor and one Cisco-Linksys connected to the same switch and broadcasting the same SSDI on different radio channels.\nAfter some investigation I found a solution. You must be sure you have exactly the same authentication settings on the Wireless interface of the APs. In my case one AP was WPA/WPA2 and the other one was WPA2 only. When I enabled WPA/WPA2 also on the second one my Macbook Pro started roaming correctly.\n\nA: You can change the system preferences for JoinMode and JoinModeFallback to be the following:\n    JoinMode (String)\n        Automatic\n        Preferred\n        Ranked\n        Recent\n        Strongest\n    JoinModeFallback (String)\n        Prompt\n        JoinOpen\n        KeepLooking\n        DoNothing\n\nDo this using the airport command: \n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/A/Resources/airport\n\nRun the command to see the options, up the top you'll see a section on how to sec preferences.\nFor instance:\nsudo /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/A/Resources/airport prefs joinMode=Strongest\n\nNote, this preference isn’t permanent, so you may need to automate this or issue it for specific problem situations or network providers. \n\nA: I have the same problem but don't have an answer. However, I may have a path for further exploration. The airport utility on ML still has a legacy option to perform a WiFi network scan.\nairport -s           # full scan\nairport -s<SSID>     # scan only for SSID\n\nThe tool is under\n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Resources/airport\n\nand my suspicion is that triggering a scan also triggers a handover if another base station is better since the results are sorted by signal strength. Having said that one could write a tool which pings the default gw and triggers a scan on packet loss. If I have some time I will give it a shot.\n\nA: I face this issue in small businesses that with OS X.\nI have yet to find a good solution other than disconnect and reconnect to grab the closer AP.\n\nA: Try a same channel setup - configure all APs to the same channel. That way the device can pick up the signal strengths of the other APs without having to scan all channels.\nYou will limit the maximum throughout though, depending on the number of clients\n\nA: After trying to set both AP's with the same security settings and trying the JoinMode command, it was actually Moritz's suggestion that did the trick. \nSetting all AP's with the same channel would seem counter-productive at first, as everywhere on the net you find that you must always set APs on the least occupied channel. But it seems to me that it's the best configuration for various APs with the same SSID. My Macbook now correctly chooses the Wi-Fi with the strongest signal. \nSo I suggest setting all Wi-Fi's with the same settings: this means same security settings, same channel, practically everything. This is what worked for me.\n", "Q: How to mute the camera shutter sound effect? It used to be that I was able to use the lock switch on my iPhone to mute all alerts and sounds (with the exception of any music, video, etc.); and this included the camera's shutter noise.

I have an iPhone 4 with iOS 5.1.1, and the other day I found that it had downloaded on its own the iOS 6 update and it was sitting there in my phone, ready to be installed and taking about 2 GB of space. Since I have no interest at all in iOS 6 right now, I'd like to delete that update, but I don't know how. Does anyone know if it can be done?\n\nA: I had exactly the same problem: OTA will download software updates and they take up space on the device until the user installs them. Then when the next one is released, it takes up more space. You notice them under 'Other' on the capacity graph in iTunes.\nTo fix I jailbroke and installed the package called \"Software Update Killer\". It not only prevents future automatic downloads, it deletes the software that's awaiting installation. Notice the shrink in 'Other' next time you sync. For me both 6.0.1 and 6.1 were downloaded and I recovered almost 1.5 GB.\n\nA: It can probably be done if you have a copy of iOS 5.1.1 lying around on your computer, but people have had not much success doing that.\nOne sure way, though very tedious, is to save your SHSH blobs and use online guides to downgrade to iOS 5.1.1. \n\nA: I would imagine restoring the iPhone via iTunes would work (as long as you have a copy of iOS 5 (a *.ipsw file) on your computer). You might want to sync your iPhone with iTunes and/or iCloud before restoring the software.\n", "Q: Can the iPhone screen's digitizer be safely separated from the glass? I recently broke my iPhone 3G screen. I've had it replaced, and I still have the broken screen. Seems like the digitizer on that screen is fine and could be reused. \nI would like to separate the digitizer from the glass and try to do some hacks with it. \nCan I use a heat gun to take it apart from the glass, or will this damage the digitizer? Is there another way I can take it off?\n\nA: The digitiser is built into the glass with epoxy, so no, there is no way to separate it. \n\nWe tried.

It seems to be all apps, not just a specific app. \n\nA: Have him sign out of the App Store in settings, then sign in again, then purchase a free app.\nThis resets the digital certificate that tells the device it can run apps for that account.

Toggling the Auto-Lock setting might also be worth a try.\n", "Q: Is it possible to remember a wifi network in iOS 6 without automatically connecting to it? Once in a while I need to use my iPhone 4 for work related tasks that require a lot of bandwidth. When doing this I will connect to the wireless network at work, do what I need to do, and then disconnect so that any personal activity goes over 3g. Currently my choices are to either leave wifi off while at work, only turning it on when I need to do work tasks, or join the work network every time I need to do work tasks, then forget the network. Turning wifi off is annoying since I have to remember to turn it off before I get to work, and then turn it back on after I leave work. Constantly joining the network is also annoying since I need to enter my username, password, and proxy information. Is there a way to have my iPhone remember my work network so I can manually join it without entering all my information, but not connect to the work network unless I force it to? I haven’t found anything obvious on either the phone or the iPhone configuration assistant so I’m pretty sure the answer is no but it can’t hurt to ask.\n\nA: \nAs you can see from this screenshot, iOS will automatically join any available known network based on signal strength. As of right now, it is not possible to do what you are asking with iOS.\n\nA: Yes...\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the network to your phone.\n\n*Then touch the \"i\" next to the network and change \"Auto-Join\" to off.\n\n*Turn off wifi and then turn it back on.\n\n\nYou will notice that you are now on the cell network.  However, if you touch the wifi network that you just updated (in settings), you will then log into it.\nThen can repeat...to return to the cell network and turn off the work wifi network (while not forgetting it)...simply turn off wifi and turn it on again and then you will notice that once again you are utilizing the cell network and not your work network...and the wifi network is not forgotten and can be used again simply by touching it (in settings).\n", "Q: Can I configure a fixed IP address on my iPhone? Hi is it possible to configure a fixed IP on my iPhone?

You could also use a VPN profile to tunnel all traffic to a fixed IP if you had a router / server set up to provide that sort of IP / DHCP to iOS devices.\n", "Q: Video screensaver in mountain lion Can I somehow have a video loop as a screensaver in mountain lion?\nI remember the Save Hollywood app that worked for leopard, but nothing since then.\nIs there any way?\n\nA: Save Hollywood has been updated for OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion and is available as freeware.\nOther paid app options are Video Screensaver (on MAS) and My Living Desktop.\n", "Q: Growl notifications in Fullscreen Apps I've just re-installed Growl and noticed it's version 2.0 and for some reason cannot get growl notifications whilst in fullscreen applications like Chrome, Safari or iTunes. \nThe notification is displayed on the first desktop space though.\nHas this always been the case and I only just noticed? \n\nUsing growl 2.0 and ML 10.8.2\nThanks!\n\nA: If you are using Spaces as well as FullScreen (which it sounds like you are) Yes, this has always been the case.

Currently it's running on 4.3.5. iTunes just shows me a popup with the option to install iOS 6.0. How can I install 5.1.1?\n\nA: There is no way to do that. Unless you already have a copy of the iOS 5.1.1 package for your iPad downloaded, you can only upgrade to the latest supported version for your device.\n\nA: This is sometimes possible. The catch is that iTunes needs to do some sort of authentication with Apple's servers, and historically they only authorize the most recent version for a given device. However I believe there is some overlap after the release of a new version, when the previous version is still valid. Since iOS 6 is relatively new, it's worth a shot at least.\nTo get the actual file, check this page, which lists downloads from Apple.com of previous versions. Note that you need to download the specific file for your device.\nThen you can go into iTunes, and option-click (shift-click in Windows) the Update button for your device. You should get a file dialog, from which you can select the .ipsw file you just downloaded. You should then be able to go through the usual updating process, assuming Apple authorizes it.\n\nA: It seems there is no way to do that, i've download a legit ipsw file for ios 5.1.1 (ipad 2 gsm) then i tried:\n1) Upgrade + Shift, select the ipsw, itunes unpacks the file, and it fails when validating the signature with apple error 3194.\n2) DFU Mode, Restore + Shift, select the ipsw, same error (different number) when validating the signature.\nI'm really disappointed, i always like to stay behind in upgrades due to bugs and problems. Installing iOS 6 and losing the maps + youtube and more problems with battery and other stuff is not an option, on the other side the current version 4.3.5 does not support the AV Adapter, it seems i'm stuck and i'm not doing nothing wrong. \nI've raised a question if it's possible under the apple ios development to upgrade and downgrade ios versions, if it is i'll go with that option, but i'm not sure.\nGood Luck\nPS: If no solution i'll return my AV Adapter, and definitive i'll look different to apple products, no more iPads, this is not away to treat customers.       \n\nA: Jailbreaking is the way to access and fool with different .ipsws. An iOS device is not a little Mac. Confusing the two leads to misunderstandings, frustration, even heartbreak. \n\nA: Yes! You can if you're willing to jailbreak!\nUpgrade to iOS 6, then downgrade to 5.1.1.\nInstructions can be found here: Downgrade From iOS 6.0 to 5.1.1 without SHSH Blobs\n", "Q: How long does Mobile Safari keep read items of Reading List in cache? In iOS 6 the Reading List features has the ability to cache pages for offline viewing. I'd like to know how long these pages stay in the ever-growing cache of articles. Since I use this feature quite a lot I wondered if I have to delete this cache every so and so often. That's not very practical though since it will also delete the cached copies of unread items.\nI know that Mobile Safari keeps its history only for 7 days, so I assumed that there might be a similar mechanism that clears out read items from the Reading List cache. However, I found an item that is probably 9 days old today while I turned on Airplane Mode and browsed through the list of all items only to find old ones that still have their data in the cache.\nSo in short: does anyone know if (and when) this cache clears read items?\n\nA: You have to remove an article from the reading list to purge the contents.\nI suppose there is an implied storage limit since you would run out of space on a device once the cached pages exceed the local storage capacity and/or the capacity of iCloud to manage the content across devices.\nI haven't tested it, but iOS has the ability to mark some content as cloud backed / temporary and these articles might get culled if you reach a low storage watermark on iOS, but I've never witnessed that happen even on devices where I've run quite full.\n", "Q: iPhone 5: Does the Wahoo Key work with the Classic-to-Lightning adapter?

According to Wahoo Support, one would be\n\n... able to use the lightning adapter to continue using our Wahoo Key.\n  This would add about an inch to the bottom of the iPhone.\n\n\nA: I have a Wahoo key and a lightning adapter and it does not work.\n", "Q: How can I add reminders via the command line? Once in a while it may be useful to add some reminders to Reminders.app from the command line — especially because they are synced to iCloud.

The MacBook was in standby (as always) but very hot (not usual). I thought some process must have stopped the mac from switching to stand by and kept the processor busy, so no big deal.\nSwitched off, booted up normally. After a while the screen freezes and I hear three loud beaps (they repeat). This happend three or four times, every time it boots up as if nothing happened.\nThan it happend at a boot. The grey start up screen is interspersed with terminal messages repeatedly sagin \"8debugger called: \", three loud beeps. Turn off, turn on, everything normal again.\nI googled the issue and found out that three beeps signal a RAM issue. However most sources agree on the fact that system diagnostics are only run at startup - so this should not happen in other modes of operation. Also I'm puzzled since it did not always hang with three beeps (I got a “regular“ kernel panic most recently, with that black PNG in the middle of the screen, telling me to reboot).\nAlso I did a memtest, which reported no errors. It may be worth noting that every time the problem occurred I was playing some flash video. system.log and kernel.log do not contain any error messages (at least none relating to a kernel panic). \nWhat may be the cause of this problem? Is it possible that the RAM is damaged (without memtest reporting an error?) or simply loose somehow? In some forum I read it may be the logic board. Do you think that may cause the issue? What should I do next to identify the problem or better: solve it?\n\nA: You might try removing part of your ram and booting up; then trying with the full amount or first one then the other. As for acting up/freezing during operation, I recall having this same behavior with a loose RAM stick once so IMO it would also be worth reseating them.\nMEMTEST is not perfect BTW.\n\nA: While your problem may indicate a RAM issue, it may not necessarily be the memory sticks. It could be a problem with the logic board that seats the memory.\nI strongly recommend booking an appointment with a Genius at an Apple Store, or taking it in to an Apple Authorized Service Provider. \nThe easiest way to make an appointment is to go to Apple's website and click on the Support tab at the top on the far right. Scroll to the bottom of the page and in the lower right hand box click on the link for Check Your Service and Support Coverage (or just click the link I have provided).\nOnce on this page, enter in the serial number for your Mac. This can be found either on the underside of your MacBook Pro in small letters on the aluminum casing (if your machine won't boot up), or by clicking on the Apple Icon on the top-left of your Mac's screen and clicking About this Mac -> More Info.... Hit Continue\nThe next screen will display the service and support coverage for your Mac. If you bought Applecare, both telephone and repair service should still be covered. If not, you will likely have to pay a diagnostic fee to identify the nature of your problem, then pay for the labour and parts for what needs fixing.\nYou can book an appointment with a local authorized dealer directly from your service and support screen, or contact applecare support directly.\nGood luck!\n\nA: I've been dealing with this same freezing/3 beep issue myself for a couple weeks after upgrading my early 2011 MacBook Pro with 16 GB of OWC RAM. I'm running OSX 10.6.8, with an OWC 6G SSD in the main bay, and an OWC 3G SSD in the optical bay.  The problem also happens on the stock 4 GB of RAM that came with the machine.\nThen I came across this google forum page, it seems that there are a lot of people on 10.6.8 that have experienced the freeze and three beep problem because of an apparent conflict with Google Drive.  As I was reading the page, it occurred to me that a good amount of the freezes happened right after bootup, when Google drive and my other menu bar applications are loading.\nI've disabled Google drive from launching into the menubar after boot up, and hopefully this will finally resolve this for me.\n", "Q: Time machine for hd upgrade Does time machine work well for hd upgrades? Looking to go to ssd but don't want to lose things like custom plist settings, init.d items, .profile items and all my brew installed items. Is times machine going to help me here or do I need something like superduper?\n\nA: Carbon Copy Cloner is my recommended way to migrate a hard drive. It's like SuperDuper, but free. Does enough to get the job done.\nI wouldn't rely on Time Machine. There's quite a bit of stuff that's excluded from Time Machine by default. And it doesn't always follow symlinks around your file system properly when backing up. For example, I had trouble with it backing up duplicates of a few files installed by Homebrew instead of the symlinks that they were. It de-linked them. That could wreak havoc on your Homebrew install if you were to restore from it.\n\nA: Unless you are doing unusual things, Time Machine is the normal Apple-supported manner of restoring your entire Mac should the internal hard drive fail. In this case, you still will have the old drive and can connect it to do a sanity check using an inexpensive SATA to USB adapter.\nI figure I've got larger problems if the tools I need don't get backed up properly and Ian has linked to a nice question (ahem) that will let you know before you start if Time Machine is capturing the data you need. Using it might be a great test before you lose your primary hard drive and lose actual data.\nYou could also implement Carbon Copy Cloner or Super Duper and test them as your backup solution, but why not use this as a \"dress rehearsal\" for your chosen backup strategy?

How about downgrade to other versions (e.g. 4.1)?\n\nA: No, being enrolled within the Apple Developer's Program does not provide you with any kind of special downgrade possibilities. \nIn the other hand, being a Developer grants you the ability to upgrade to the newest yet-to-be-released version of iOS. \nSo, being the iPad 2 eligible for iOS 6, you won't be able to upgrade it to iOS 5.1.1 instead, enrolled as a Developer or not.\n", "Q: Lightroom catalog on external hard drive not readable Using Lightroom 4, when opening a catalog file on an external hard drive, I get error\n\nLightroom cannot launch with this catalog.

Currently I'm searching for an application by that I can remotely access another iPad screen just like Teamviewer.\nIs there any iPad application available which can be useful to access another iPad's screen.\n\nA: The iOS security sandbox will prevent any App store app from sharing the screen of any other app on a stock iPad.  However the built-in AirPlay mirroring will allow a user to send a mirror of their iPad display to an Apple TV.\n\nA: A clunky workaround would be to have the client take a screenshot and email or iMessage it to you. Screenshots are taken by pressing the home and sleep buttons at the same time until the screen flashes and you hear the camera noise. The screenshot is saved to your Camera Roll.\n\nA: What if you use reflection on the other person's iPad and then use a desktop viewer on your iPad to view the desktop that is viewing the other person's iPad? You just need a desktop as an intermediary between you both.\n\nA: You can try using RHUB iOS app. You can use it for conducting online meetings and providing remote support. It is free.\n\nA: Zoom lets you share pictures, and other thins - but, not the desktop.\n\nA: Bombar has ipad support.  It is from a pd or Mac though.

Given the increasing number of reports about malware for Apple computers, I am concerned by the fact that there's no simple way to physically block the camera while I'm using my MacBook Pro.\nIs it possible an OSX virus or maybe an exploit in Flash could be used to activate the camera, without turning on the green recording light at the top center? Or is this impossible due to the hardware of MBP?\nA related question arises concerning the microphone, could it be used by malware to secretly record conversations around the computer? If so, what are the best ways of preventing this?\n\nA: I'm fairly certain the green light is hard-wired to the camera, there's no way to activate the camera without activating the light, precisely for privacy reasons. If you're really concerned about it, you can always just use a piece of electrical tape to cover the camera (or fold a piece of cardboard over the top of the lid for a non-sticky solution).\nFrankly I wouldn't worry too much about the risk of malware. That particular piece of malware (MacDefender) was contained fairly quickly by Apple, it's very unlikely that you could be infected by it now, unless you maintain an unpatched system. There have been a few OS X security issues lately (such as Flashback), and they get a lot of press, but the actual amount of harmful software out there for a Mac is extremely low.\nMy advice is to keep your system up to date and avoid downloading files from questionable sources. But other than that, don't worry too much, unless you have a highly sensitive job (in which case there should be other people whose job it is to worry about it).\n\nA: Idk what the person is talking about re: the Hidden app. This is from the Hidden FAQ (http://hiddenapp.com/support/faqs/does-green-light-always-come-when-hidden-takes-picture/):\nPublished on 19/12/12\nDoes the green light always come on when Hidden takes a picture?\nYes. The light is hard-wired to the camera, it's a security feature from Apple.\nIt's not possible for us to disable it.\n\nA: no idea if this is still possible with the most current os x version, but where there's a will there's a way:\nhttps://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/handle/1774.2/36569\nUPDATE:\nThe linked paper describes a method to disable the LED on Apples internal iSight cameras.\n\nWe build two proofs-of-concept: (1) an OS X application, iSeeYou, which demonstrates capturing video with the LED disabled; and (2) a virtual machine escape that launches Terminal.app and runs shell commands. To defend against these and related threats, we build an OS X kernel extension, iSightDefender, which prohibits the modification of the iSight’s firmware from user space.\n\n\nA: If you are worried about it, you can do 2 things.\nIn System Prefs, go to Sound--Input, and turn the Input volume all the way down.\nAs for the camera, a piece of black electrical tape to cover it works perfect.\nThere used to be a website you could go to to demonstrate how a web page using java could take over your Camera and turn it on, but i think that security hole was patched back in 10.3, not sure if it's possible to do that anymore without installing something specific on your machine...\n", "Q: Completely clear all output from a Terminal window I would like to clear all output from a Terminal window (including all historical output) to get it back to a clean state as if you had just opened a new Terminal window, or a new Terminal tab.\nI can use the clear command to clear just the current screenful, but then you can still scroll up to see all the historical output. I'm using the Terminal to trace program output and at the end I would just like to do ⌘ + A to select all the text so I can grab the output from the just last run, without having to scroll up and see where it started. I could also just open a new tab, I was just wondering if this can be done in the same window? \n\nA: Have you tried the clear all combination ⌘+K?\nThere is also ⌥+⌘+K, which just clears the scroll-back.\n\nA: The combination ⌘+L will clear the output of last command in mac default terminal zsh.\n\nthis way you can keep pressing for as much cleaning you want to do\n\n", "Q: How can I configure custom repeat intervals for Reminders? I would like to configure an alert for a recurring reminder in Reminders.app on Mountain Lion. Currently the only options I have for repeating the alert are \"Every Day\", \"Every Week\", \"Every 2 Weeks\", \"Every Month\" and \"Every Year\".\n\nIs there a way to get more fine-grained control on the repeat schedule? For example I'd like to be reminded for something on Mon-Tue-Thu-Fri? The only way I found to accomplish that is creating 4 seperate reminders with a weekly interval, which I want to avoid.\n\nA: This bugs me too. It isn't possible to do in Reminders, but you can achieve the same thing by creating a repeating event in Calendar, which has a \"custom...\" item in the Repeat menu:\n\nThen you can specify exactly when to repeat the event:\n\nIt seems like an oversight that Reminders doesn't have the same feature (it would be just as useful), especially since the event/reminder detail UI is the same...\n\nA: I found out you can accomplish this with BusyCal, which has iCloud support.\nUnfortunately it comes with a $49.99 pricetag, which I am hesitant to pay for the sole purpose of adding custom intervals to reminders. I also prefer not to install a 3rd application in addition to Calendar and Reminders just for managing my tasks.\nThat's why I did some digging and found an alternative (though very cumbersome) way to accomplish this specifically for iCloud reminders, but probably for other CalDav accounts too. You'll also need to be comfortable with editing raw iCal files.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a reminder for your iCloud account in Reminders.app and set it to repeat weekly.\n\n*Locate the local cache of your iCloud calendars in ~/Library/Calendars. You should have one or more subfolders {UUID}.caldav. If you have multiple of these folders, you'll want to have a look in the Info.plist inside to determine the correct one. Look for the key PrincipalURL which should be something like https://p01-caldav.icloud.com:443/272548408/principal/ for an iCloud account. Make note of the server name, in this case p01-caldav.icloud.com.\n\n*You will have one or more {UUID}.calendar subfolders, where one of these will be a calendar specifically for reminders. You should find a .ics file for the reminders you created inside its Events subfolder, then you know you found the right calendar. Have a look at the Info.plist inside this calendar folder, and look for the value for CalendarPath.\n\n*Use a WebDav client like Transmit to connect to iCloud directly. Fill out the servername from step 2, your iCloud email address and password as credentials, and specify the value for CalendarPath (step 3) as the initial path.\n\n*When connected, you should see one or more {UUID}.ics files. Locate the correct one for the reminder you want to edit (UUIDs should match with the ones in the local cache) and edit the file. Look for the line RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY and edit that one to specify a custom recurrence. For my example I put RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,TH,FR instead.\n\n\nWhile Reminders.app on the Mac does not show anything different in the UI, I can see the change was effective on iOS:\n\n\nA: Ask Siri to 'remind me to order prescriptions every four weeks starting on Monday 20th January'\n\nA: I realize this is an old question, but I just discovered they recently added this feature to Reminders. \nOn OSX Yosemite, it appears they've since added the \"Custom…\" option under the repeat menu, so you can now add the more fine-grained controls that you could only add via the Calendar app or other workarounds. \n\n\nA: Fantastical allows you to do this and the price is a reasonable $20.\n\n\nA: I found that iCloud calendar (which I sync with my other devices) has a \"Custom...\" option here.  (No Siri required.)  That's how I did it when I needed an unusual repeat pattern.\n\n\n\nA: There's a great iPhone app from Readdle called Calendars 5 (£4.99) which has a tasks manager (as well as an intuitive calendar function) which will sync tasks back to Reminders and then via iCloud to your mac.

However, when I do that, it starts waking from hibernation (the grey screen with the progress bar appears) and then it restarts. Usually the battery shows half full, so theoretically it shouldn’t go into hibernation.\nAnybody else running into this problem? How did you solved it?

On my MacBook, I frequently end up with lots of overlapping windows on the screen, obscuring the desktop. I recently discovered the five finger 'swipe outwards' gesture that displays the desktop. Unfortunately this doesn't do exactly what I want; as soon as I select an application (typically a Finder window) from the dock, all the windows swipe back into place.

I'm looking for explanation of memory usage on my machine especially in light of the example in this screenshot below:\n\nI understand what is Free and Active means\nBut what are the meanings of Wired and Inactive?\nEspecially inactive, why does it use so much memory for something that we do not use?\n\nA: The number which is the most important in determining if your Mac is getting memory 'stressed' is the 'Page outs' figure. In Activity Monitor in Mavericks this is no longer shown, they now show the information in 'Swap Used:'.\nPage outs means the OS has determined there is not enough available RAM to run all the applications & processes which have been requested. What it then does is it 'pages' out to disk parts of memory which it determines are not being actively used. This means RAM memory (fast) is changed to HDD memory (slow). If this is happening a lot because there are a lot of applications running, and the user is going between applications, then there will be a lot of page outs, and page ins.\nIf you see page outs increasing then you should take action.\n\nA: The problem on my Mac is the \"inactive\" memory never seems to get purged unless I do a manual purge in the command window. It builds up and builds up until I get a popup window telling me to kill applications. Even after killing all my applications, I still have too much inactive memory to run anything. So, on my Mac running the latest version of Mountain Lion it is NOT true that inactive memory gets reclaimed when the free memory gets low. Either I have an app somewhere that has locked up a chunk of inactive memory that never gets freed, or the iOS has a bug in it. (I have 8GB of physical memory ... that ought to be enough!)\n\nA: Thanks to all the posters and commenters, this has been a instructive and useful thread for me. My recent experience might be useful to someone.  I use my Mac Mini with OS X10.8.1 and with 16G RAM entirely for prototyping software that will be run elsewhere.  I can assure you that I will not \"go back to Facebook in a few minutes or re-launch Word after quitting it\"--I do that on my macbook instead. \nMy task was to munge up a large bunch of data, i/o is time consuming, so the notion is to read as large a chunk of data to ram as possible at one swoop, process it there, and then write it back to disk, then repeat the process until done, which takes some hours. What I see is that every time I read in a new chunk of data, the inactive memory jumps--I suppose that the system AI assumes that I might want to use the old chunk again, which I don't--and the free memory drops.  \nAfter a few iterations of this process the free memory gets down to a just a few MB, the inactive memory will free up a few more MB, and then eventually after some minutes of quibling back&forth between free and inactive memory, the inactive memory will free up a few GB at once.  All is as @bmike describes, and both vm_stat 15 and Activity monitor show 0 page-outs.\nExcept maybe not quite.  Several times things have been moving along swimmingly, I head off to have a coffee or dinner and am not monitoring the process, and what shouldn't happen happens and the process suddenly throws off a boatload of page-outs and slows way down.  Stipulate that it's probably my crappy code that's causing the problem but I wish I could turn off the inactive memory just to eliminate that source of variability.\nIs it broken? I wouldn't say so at all, but I would say that I guess the memory management is not optimized for my use case. \n\nA: Inactive memory got a horrible rap due to a crappy name. It should have been called something like \"make your Mac really fast the second, third, and fourth time it does the same task\" memory except that's an awful name, too. \nApple re-wrote the activity monitor when it introduced several new features and added compressed memory, so some of this no longer applies to macOS that don’t show “Inactive Memory” but this still applies to Mac OS X memory management as documented against this version of Activity Monitor: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201538\nHere's how I explained things to someone new to the concept of virtual memory on OS X:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wired: The system cannot run without this amount of RAM (never swapped)\n\n*Active: Programs are really using this memory now or in the last few seconds\n\n*Inactive: Things that programs have read from the slow disk or elsewhere and said they never need again. Engineers know better, you will go back to Facebook in a few minutes or re-launch Word after quitting it. The same things happen again and again on computers.\n\n*Free: Totally Wasted RAM - the system only needs one or two MB free to cover short term allocation requests. For largest allocations, it simply uses some of the Inactive RAM by allocating it to active/wired and removing the information on what it used to hold.\n\n\nThe problem arises when Free+Inactive is less than roughly 1/3 of the total and then things can really get slow. \nInactive memory is bonus speed / double duty RAM. It serves as free at a moment's notice, but also makes repeated tasks much, much faster if the system guessed correctly and kept something in RAM that you will do again. It's faster than swapped memory since it's already loaded in RAM and accelerates things when the virtual memory system makes good guesses. \nWhen you are wondering if RAM is a problem, rather than looking at each of the 4 categories (5 if you count active swap), you can couple W+A as slowing down a new program/task and F+I as speeding up a new program/task. The more F+I you have, the more new programs you can launch before the RAM needs to rely on swapping to juggle the memory that has been allocated.\nYou don't really need to know how swap works since I mentioned it above. Basically, when a program is sitting idle and hasn't been used for days (or hours) the system will write that RAM to the hard drive rather than kill the program. This lets the system shuffle and handle all sorts of things relating to memory management and keeps each program from needing to talk amongst themselves to agree who will use less memory when the system runs out.\nHere is a real world example of how inactive RAM is used.\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit all apps and make sure the two Apps we are testing are not set to auto start when you log in\n\n*Reboot your Mac\n\n*Fire up your Activity Monitor and watch the RAM throughout\n\n*Time how long it takes to start Application A (MS Word would be a good choice)\n\n*Quit A\n\n*Time how long it takes to start Application B (Adobe something would also be good)\n\n*Quit B\n\n*Time how long the second launch of A takes\n\n*Quit A\n\n*Time B's second launch.\n\n*Time A's start the third time with B running.\n\n\nYou should see dramatic speedups for the second / third launch as the system learns to keep in inactive RAM the things these two apps need to run.\n\nIn your case - the total of Wired and Active means that some swapping to disk is likely happening and your Mac isn't as fast as it could be since your inactive RAM isn't large enough to store all the things you might need to reuse. If you have a fast SSD drive, this RAM allocation is OK and instead of starting to slow down once less than 1/2 of your RAM is F+I, you can cut things closer to like 1/4 of the total RAM for F+I before seeing noticeable slowness. These guidelines are general, and you'll want to watch vm_stat 15 or some similar interval to ensure continual and medium volume swapping isn't making your Mac slow.\n\nA: \nInactive memory used by recently active and quit apps. OS X keeps it reserved in case the user wants to open the program again. In it happens, OS X does not need to relocate memory that accelerates performance speed. If you do not re-open the program, after a while the memory of the inactive will be freed or relocated.(c)\n\nThis feature is cool when you have a lot of RAM, but when it's not it's quite annoying. Actually it's all about apple stuff. When you have powerful gadget or Mac everything is cool, but when when you device become older all features slows it. \nSo u have to use special tricks to manage it. \nFor inactive memory there is a command purge to free it.\n\nA: Inactive memory in essence, makes opening up formerly closed processes faster. If you find that the Mac OS is taking up too much memory you don't really need like from the dozens of tabs you opened on Safari or Chrome just use the 'purge' command in the Terminal. In OS X Mavericks just use 'sudo purge' instead (you will need to input your password). It shaves off precious seconds when you need to open something up again, but if you want to play a RAM intensive game or open a RAM hungry application I definitely suggest using the purge command.   \n\nA: Basically it's broken.  Inactive RAM should be \"purged\" automatically when Free RAM is low.  What's the point of holding RAM for previously opened applications hoping that the user will open it again?  The fact that Free RAM is low indicates that existing ACTIVE applications might not have enough RAM and is swapping NOW.  Keeping GB of RAM for closed applications is just dumb.\nAccording to Apple's own description, Inactive RAM should be purged or borrowed automatically when Free RAM is low.\nThis is clearly not the case.\n", "Q: Install 32bit Java 7 OpenJDK Motivation\nI have a proprietary java application which used to work under Snow Leopard but fails under Lion with the following backtrace:\nException in thread \"AWT-EventQueue-0\" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid display mode\n    at apple.awt.CGraphicsDevice.setDisplayMode(CGraphicsDevice.java:472)\n    at apple.awt.CGraphicsDevice.setFullScreenWindowSynchronized(CGraphicsDevice.java:363)\n    at apple.awt.CGraphicsDevice.access$000(CGraphicsDevice.java:25)\n    at apple.awt.CGraphicsDevice$1SetFullScreenAction.run(CGraphicsDevice.java:326)\n    at apple.awt.CGraphicsDevice.setFullScreenWindow(CGraphicsDevice.java:331)\n\nThe call to setFullScreenWindow only passes null, i.e. it attempts to restore from full-screen to windowed mode.

It's smart and slows down the charge appropriately whether you are using the device or not.\nPut another way, the device only asks for enough power to run itself and charge if needed from the wall. The wall doesn't send too much power so there's no risk of overcharging.\n\nA: TL;DR - Perfectly safe.\nThe iphone doesn't accurately display it's current charge level with the on screen indicator.  If you turn if on (it's in Settings, but off by default) the available battery range is the standard 0-100%.  But when it hit's 0%, it still has enough juice to safely close all your apps and save their state for future use.  You can test this by having a text half written as your phone dies.  Charge the phone u p, and hey presto, your half written text will be there to the letter, because it didn't just pull the power and turn off, it gracefully closed all the apps.\nLikewise, when it hits 100%, it doesn't actually stop there, it continues charging even further.  I'm not sure for the phone, but I believe that on an iPad 3 it will charge to the equivalent of something like 107%.  Why?  Well, leaving a battery fully charged without using it, is bad for it's health.  Also depleting a small amount of charge (say 2-3% and then recharging is also not ideal.  That's why if you have a Mac and you charge it fully, then use a bit so it drops to 97%, and then put it on charge again, it won't actually charge it any further, and will stay on 97% until it drops lower than that, at which point it decides it has safely depleted enough to make it worth charging again.  The iPhone does something very similar, but is more clever about it.  So it will say 100% before it has actually reached it's charge limit, and from that point on until you start to use sufficient battery, it will charge it to 107% (equivalent, roughly), then use battery until it drops back to %100, then charge to 107% etc etc and so on, so it never just sits there at full charge.  You have have noticed that occasionally when at 100%, it will take a long time to hit 99%, this is dependant on whereabouts in the \"overcharge\" cycle it is in.\n", "Q: How to back up iPhoto and iTunes using Dropbox Could someone explain in simple terms exactly how to back up iPhoto and iTunes (and if possible keep it synced) using Dropbox, please? I have purchased some additional space with Dropbox to do this, but I am not very technically minded and I don't know how to do it.\nI am using an iMac with Lion.\n\nA: I've done something similar to this, only mine is on a network drive, but the same steps apply.\nFirst, we need to copy your libraries to your Dropbox folder. So open a new Finder window and make sure you're in your Home folder.\nFor iTunes:\nNavigate to Home > Music. You should see a folder named iTunes here. Copy this folder to your Dropbox, wherever you want it stored at there.\nNow, if iTunes is in your Dock, hold ALT/OPTION and click the icon. If not, go back to Finder and navigate to Applications. Find iTunes in the Applications folder and do the same, hold ALT/OPTION and click the icon.\niTunes will open and ask you to choose a library. (If it bugs you about not being able to find the folder first, ignore it. We're about to fix that.) Click \"Choose Library\" and navigate to the iTunes folder you copied to Dropbox earlier. Select this folder and click open. iTunes will take a few moments to respond, but if all worked correctly, it will open up and you will see all of your music and such there.\nFor iPhoto:\nNow, navigate back to Home, only this time, open the Pictures folder. You should see a file named iPhoto Library. Copy this folder to your Dropbox, wherever you want it stored at there.\nNow, if iPhoto is in your Dock, hold ALT/OPTION and click the icon. If not, go back to Finder and navigate to Applications. Find iPhoto in the Applications folder and do the same, hold ALT/OPTION and click the icon.\niPhoto will open and ask you to choose a library. (If it bugs you about not being able to find the folder first, ignore it. We're about to fix that.) Click \"Choose Library\" and navigate to the iPhoto folder you copied to Dropbox earlier. Select this folder and click open. iPhoto will take a few moments to respond, but if all worked correctly, it will open up and you will see all of your photos there.\nNOTE: Keep in mind, one caveat to using this method is that you should only have iTunes or iPhoto open on a single machine at a time. Running it on more than one machine may result in some problems. Dropbox keeps the latest copy of a file, and quite often, while iTunes and iPhoto are running, they write to their main library file (think of it as a journal of what they're doing, including settings and changes like that). If computer A writes to the file and Dropbox syncs it, then computer B goes to write to the file, computer B might overwrite something it wasn't expecting to be there, corrupting the file.\nLong-story short, this method will keep your libraries in sync and available on any of your Dropbox devices. Just use caution if you choose to run iTunes or iPhoto on more than one machine at a time using this method.\nAlso, as far as being backed up, the music will be stored on Dropbox, so you can always get it back if your Mac dies or crashes. However, just remember, if you move or remove any files from the libraries in Dropbox, you won't have a spare copy. I highly recommend using Time Machine or another backup solution, and having it include your Dropbox folder to protect against this potential scenario.\nI know this was a lot of info, moreso on the warning side than the actual \"how-to\", but I'd rather give you a heads up now so you don't run into the same problems I've had in the past.\nGood luck, and enjoy your music and pictures!\n", "Q: Messages.app asks for iChat every time I open it Every time I open up Messages, it asks me to locate iChat. This is on a new machine that I migrated from an old one on Lion and then upgraded to Mt. Lion. I don't have iChat on this machine any more, as far as I can tell. How do I stop it from prompting me? (It seems to happen only after a restart.)\n\n\nA: (I haven't upgraded to Mountain Lion myself, but my understanding is that Messages has subsumed iChat.) That looks like the AppleScript find-the-application-named-in-the-script dialog. Do you perhaps have something that somehow runs a script when you launch Messages? If so, find that script and edit it to refer to application \"Messages\" instead of application \"iChat\" if that works, or remove it entirely.\n", "Q: How can I get Outlook to stop asking for a Keychain login if I don't want to use keychain? I don't want to use keychain for my passwords so I have not added any passwords to keychain.  This means that every time Outlook checks for mail it creates a popup window asking for my keychain password.  I have seen this question but this seems to require that I use keychain for password management.  \nIs there a way to get Outlook (actually everything) to stop looking for my keychain password?\nI am using OS X 10.5.8\n\nA: Keychain as you may be aware by now is the main system OSX uses to store your passwords. Anything you ask to be stored is sent to the keychain. Therefore if you choose not to save any passwords you will be asked to enter the password in every time it is required, which is what the keychain is designed to do.\nIf you do not want to save passwords to the keychain, then no you cannot get around the keychain pop up question.\n", "Q: Magic Mouse right click lost every day My Magic Mouse at work looses right-click functionality every day, although System Preferences says it's enabled. I usually leave the computer at the \"Login window\" before leaving, and authenticate again to resume the session the next day. When I do that, right-clicking doesn't work anymore. I have to turn the mouse off and back on again to re-enable right-click functionality. I'm running OSX 10.7.5, but the problem is present at least since I upgraded from Snow Leopard to Lion (an year ago, maybe?).\nI've googled this issue several times, and many other people have similar complaints, but I couldn't find a permanent fix. Does anyone know how to solve that? It's driving me crazy!\n\nI tried replacing the mouse, but the problem persists. So, I think the actual cause must be one of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*A problem with my iMac's bluetooth hardware\n\n*A bug on the Magic Mouse's firmware software\n\n*An on OSX bug\n\n\nA: I just talked to German Apple telephone support. They fixed the problem for me! With fresh  installs of 10.7.5 the problem is that two files are missing that are needed for the mouse. In my case I could get them from another computer I own that ran Lion and did have the files. To get to the files you need do this: \nGo to\n/System/Library/LoginPlugins/BezelServices.loginPlugin\ncontrol-click that file and choose \"show contents\"\nnow in the finder window navigate to \nContents/PlugIns/\nIn this folder should be two files named\nAppleBluetoothHIDMouse.plist\nand\nAppleHIDMouse.plist\nIf you don't find these files, you need to get them and put them in. \n\nA: I ran into this problem as well - I have a magic mouse and a trackpad which i keep in a drawer when not in use. My issue was a persist problem with the magic mouse LEFT click not working.\nIt turned out that some of the contents of the drawer were pressing on the trackpad and engaging its 'click'. Once I turned off the track pad, the mouse started working again.\n", "Q: Why can't I resize a window's height to make it smaller when it is at full height? I have two 21\" monitors at work which I attach to my early 2011 MBP (running 10.8.1) and I move various windows between the monitors. Sometimes the windows coming down to my laptop's screen are larger than it so they fit the maximum height (but are over the maximum width) of my built-in LCD.\nI can resize the width of a window by clicking its left or right edge and dragging, but when I try to resize the height, and it shows the up-arrow (or even in the corner where it shows the diagonal arrow), I can click and drag as much as I want but it doesn't resize the height, it only moves the window left and right if I move my pointer either direction.\nIn other words, the height is stuck when the window is the height of the screen. This only happens when the bottom of the window is at the top of the dock. When windows are smaller than the screen, resizing is fine.\nIs there any way to resize a full-height window on my LCD without moving it around then dragging from another corner or something?\n\nA: Are you running any sort of third-party window management software? That's the only reason I can think of that this wouldn't work for you.\nI can resize the height of my windows using the arrows on any visible edge, including the top and bottom of a max heigh window, and the diagonals. I tested this with the Dock hidden and visible, on the side and bottom, and with a window with a size exceeding that of the screen. Worked every time.\nIf you're not running any third-party software that might be interfering with window resizing for some reason, the only thing that comes to mind is that your mouse is very sensitive and you're moving it slightly before the click to resize actually registers.\nYou might also be interested in Moom. It's a pretty handy window manager that can do things like save preset window configurations for different display set ups, or do one-click window resizing to match a specific size in pixels (which you can bind to a hotkey). It's not a solution to not being able to manually resize, but if you're moving windows around different displays often, you may find it handy. Divvy is another popular app that does some of the same tasks, but I haven't tried it myself.\n", "Q: Skip an OSX version with App Store upgrades? I have a MacBook running Snow Leopard and newer MacBook Air running Lion.  If I buy the Mountain Lion upgrade through the App Store on my Air, will I be able to use the same App Store purchase on my older MacBook?\nOr are OS upgrades not multi-machine friendly (somehow different from other apps that are pay-once download-many)?\n\nA: You can upgrade to Mountain Lion from both Lion and Snow Leopard (SL). With SL you will need to be running the latest version 10.6.8 and then you can just buy it through the app store.\ncheck this link for more details:\nApple OSX Upgrade\nYou just need to make sure your machine can handle Mountain Lion which you can see with this app from the app store Mac Tracker - its a free app.\nOS' are like normal apps - they can be installed on up to 5 machines.\nGood Luck on the upgrade:-)\n\nA: The Licence Agreement for Mountain Lion may be different in your jurisdiction however the UK Mac App Store states for the OS X Mountain Lion License Agreement:\n\nB. Mac App Store License.  If you obtained a license for the Apple\n  Software from the Mac App Store, then subject to the terms and\n  conditions... you are granted a limited non-transferable, no exclusive\n  license:\n(i) to download, install, use and run for personal, non-commercial\n  use, one copy of the the Apple software on each Apple-branded computer\n  running OS X Lion or OS X Snow Leopard ... that you own or control.\n\nIf you are a commercial entity, then different rules apply\nBoth machines need the Mac App store to be accessed using the same AppleID used to purchase Mountain Lion.  You can also save yourself the 4GB download a second time around, by copying the Mountain lion Installer from the /Applications directory tot he other machine once downloaded in full, note the installer is deleted once it is installed so cancel the install once it is downloaded, copy it somewhere safe, then upgrade away.\n", "Q: What counts as data usage on the iPhone? I went from low usage of data on an average to over my limit and I do not know why. How can I tell? Does streaming music count? I have AT&T, so I think I have unlimited texting. Do photos on my phone count? Or just when you send them?\n\nA: Everything that is not either a) texting or b) phone calls uses data. (That is to say, everything that sends or receives something.) Streaming music uses a lot of data (streaming video uses even more). Photos only count when you send them or receive them. \nAlso, note that the phone will use a WiFi network if available instead of the cell network, so that data doesn't count.\nYour bill should give you some idea of how your data usage increased; if it doesn't a call to AT&T customer service (or visiting one of their stores) might be helpful.\n\nA: To keep track of your mobile data usage you could reset the \"Statistics\" on the phone on the first day of your billing cycle. To do this go to Settings → General → Usage → Cellular Usage and go to the bottom of the page. There you will see the amount of Cellular Network Data sent and received.\n\nA: Cellular data is utilized for services such as sending and receiving MMS, web browsing, app downloads and updates, sending and receiving mail, as well as iAds, and any other data transmitted via Apps. Phone calls do not count as \"data\" but do, obviously, count against the minutes on your plan. It is important to note that while connected to Wi-Fi, only MMS uses data. iMessage, Apps, mail, web browsing, etc, all utilize Wi-Fi over EDGE/3G/4G, while MMS does not, regardless of Wi-Fi connectivity.\nRegular SMS does not count against your \"data\" allowance, only against your text messaging plan.\n\nA: If you're on AT&T, you can install their \"myAT&T\" app which will tell you how much data you've used in the current billing cycle. The information lags by a day or so (it's not \"live\") but if your goal is avoiding overage charges it should give you an idea how much of your \"allowance\" you've used. \nLess relevant to this question: the app also tells you how many text messages are left in your billing cycle, how much your last bill was, etc. etc. - basically everything you can learn by logging in to their website.\n", "Q: What application is using a particular file? I have some FileMaker databases being served for dev purposes and I keep bumping into occurrences where the database/file is locked and I can't make changes to it.  \nHow can I determine what application is touching/using this file so I can kill it? \n\nA: Have you tried using the terminal command\n\n$ lsof 'Filename'\n\nFor a more detailed look at the file use\n$ lsof | grep -f 'Filename'\n\nShould give you the command that is using it and also the PID of that file\n\nA: Try adding sudo.

I've got a Macbook Air that is starting mysql on boot.  I've looked in LaunchAgents, LaunchDaemons, .bash_profile and .profile and login items.

Both connect fine and both have the same settings for DNS and search domain applied after connection.\nThe only difference actually is that one is Lion and second one is Mountain Lion. That's the end of the differences.\nAfter connecting to my vpn on Mountain Lion I cannot ping nor ssh to any address using domain name. And I don't mean local/private domain. I mean google.com for example. Nothing!\nHowever, when using nslookup/dig/host domain name is resolved just fine.\nOn the second machine with Lion everything works just fine. With the exact same settings.\nAny thoughts?\nI've already tried adding -AlwaysAppendSearchDomains and it didn't work [why would it, google.com is not under the search domain specified in my dns settings...].\n\nA: I solved my problem by switching to Vicosity. After installing Viscosity I imported my Tunnelblick configuration and have been able to connect to the VPN of my company instantly. In opposite to Tunnelblick Viscosity is not free. But the price is fine for me.\n\nA: Currently the solution for tunnelblick [ver 3.3 beta 54] is to manually configure DNS settings to have two entries:\n1. your VPN dns address\n2. your regular dns address\nfor me it looks like this:\n1. 10.10.0.1\n2. 8.8.8.8\n\nI know it's not perfect, but it works. I guess that for most people it shouldn't be a problem, especially that in osx you can configure multiple network profiles which will automatically switch when they detect changes in your network configuration.\n\nA: TLDR: add list push \"dhcp-option DOMAIN lan\"in the vpn server config. Server config is in /etc/openvpn/server.conf or /etc/config/openvpn or some other place.\nExplanation:\nAfter a lot of investigation I found out why it didn't work. Imagine in the network where the vpn server is I have a machine called arch. If I am in the same network pinging arch works.\nNow when I connect though the vpn I want to ping arch. But it fails.\nif I do dig arch or host arch it works. Where's the problem?\nUsing wireshark I found out that locally if I ping arch it queries the DNS for arch.lan (my dhcp supplies a lan search domain).\nI tried dig arch - works.\nI also tried dig arch.lan - also works.\nWhen I connect through the vpn (tunnelblick) I checked what it does when I do ping arch, and it does a DNS query for arch.openvpn.\nWhere does the openvpn come from? Well, it's a stupid Tunnelblick default. TunnelBlick supplies an extra openvpn search domain.\nHow do we fix it, well we can say to the vpn server to \"push\" to all vpn clients a search domain which overrides the stupid default from TunnelBlick. That's the line in the top.\nI tried viscosity it didn't work prior to the \"pushing\". Unfortunaly I uninstalled it before I started sniffing with Wireshark. So not sure what the problem with it was.\n", "Q: Window management with multiple displays and desktops I have a MacBook Pro with two connected displays. I keep windows on all three displays, and I have found Stay - which I discovered thanks to this question - to work very well for remembering what windows go where on all three displays after I've disconnected and reconnected my monitors. \nHowever, it's not quite what I need.\nWhen I use my MBP with the monitors connected, I don't use multiple Desktops - it's just not the way I work. So when I disconnect my displays and just use the MBP, I'm left with a jumble of windows from all three displays (the built-in one included) all on one Desktop.\nWhat I would like ideally is:\n\n\n*\n\n*to have the windows on each monitor move to their own Desktop when I disconnect the monitors;\n\n*then, when I connect the monitors again, the windows would whoosh back to their respective monitors and all be on the same Desktop. \n\n*(In a perfect world, it would also remove the two empty Desktops while the monitors are plugged in, but I'm not sure I can hope for that.)\n\n\nCan I do this with Stay, or is there another app (or system setting) I need to find to accomplish this? Is this even possible?\n\nA: I don't have an external monitor to test this on, but you could look at an app called Swapp that purports to be able to swap the contents of an external screen onto your main display.  I'm not sure if it works with more than 1 external monitor, but in theory you might be able to switch to a 2nd desktop on your MBP, and swap the windows from an external monitor onto it, hopefully being able to repeat the trick with a 3rd monitor on a 3rd desktop space.\nThere is also Display maid which looks similar.\nBoth have free trials.\nYou could also try this relatively simple but manual trick to shove windows to another desktop space, either before removing your external monitors or after:\nEnable Desktop Space control keys in System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Mission Control, check the boxes as follows:\n\nTo move windows, click and hold on any window titlebar and hit Control+2, Control+1, or Control+3 to instantly bring the chosen window to the desktop corresponding to the keyboard shortcut\n", "Q: How to use a wired headphone AND a mic at the same time on the Macbook Pro Retina? I'm surprised that the Macbook Pro Retina has only one 3.5mm audio jack. It seems that port can be either headphone or mic in depending on what's connected but I need BOTH at the same time for Skype! My Skype headset has 2x 3.5mm jacks - one for output (headphones) and one for input (Mic).\nHow is Apple expecting us to use Skype on the MPBr? I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*in-built speakers + in-build mic: The loudspeaker throws feedback into the built-in mic => unusable\n\n*headphones + in-built mic: Keyboard clicks and other ambient noises are picked up => unusable\n\n*microphone + speakers: Works but I can't use this unless I close my office door (i.e. only person in the room). I can't use this in coffee shops, campus areas, shared office environments etc\n\n*Bluetooth headset: Its a pain to make sure the headset is fully charged before the call and that it doesn't kill my WiFi (which it sometimes does).\n\n\nHow can I get a real wired headphone and mic to work with the MBPr? This thing is killing my conference calls ...\n\nA: You will need the same type of headset that you use with an iPhone. It will have one 3.5mm plug that carries both the stereo audio and mic input (aka a TRRS plug). Some examples are apple's own EarPods, Sennheiser's PX 200-II i's, and any other iPhone headset.\n", "Q: eclipse RCP juno 64 bit crashes on Mac OS X I'm trying to install eclipse RCP 64 bit version on my Mac (10.7.5). \n\nWhenever I tried to launch eclipse, I got this crash screen.\n\nWhen I tried to start eclipse using command line, I got Segmentation fault: 11 error message. \nWhat might be wrong?

When iTunes mounts my iPhone (this has also happened with my iPad), it's unable to recognize any of the content on the phone, so any changes to what it should sync are added on top of everything that it lumps into the \"other\" category, as if it doesn't recognize the data that's already on the device.\nWhat's going on, and how do I fix it? I'd like to sync my phone without iTunes forgetting everything that's on it every time.\nScreencap: All usage is \"other\", even though it's definitely not.\nScreencap: Audio accounts for 4.9GB of its usage anyway – it seems like it just doesn't recognize the audio that's already on the device.\n\nA: If you previously tried to sync your iTunes with your iPhone but the sync did not effectuate until the end (failed or incomplete sync) this could have corrupted your iPhone Library file which contains all the listings of your iPhone media tracks/playlists, etc. \niTunes sync would first deal with this file deleting and then updating it after which it will add/remove tracks physically on your device. If a previous iTunes sync failed to execute correctly or was interrupted, iTunes would have deleted or corrupted your iPhone Library file while keeping the tracks physically on your iPhone. An iTunes sync could fail due to many reasons - USB cable damaged, USB slot on computer or device damaged, manual abrupt unplug, etc.\nThis would result in iTunes failing to see your iPhone tracks the next time you connect your iPhone since iTunes used the iPhone library file solely to recognize the content on your iPhone. \nOn your iPhone, on the other hand, you could continue seeing and be able to play the tracks normally. \nIf you have all of your iTunes tracks already loaded in your iTunes library, simply reset your iPhone to factory settings via iTunes and let iTunes fully sync with your iPhone.

My Mac's hard drive was recently replaced, and I copied my folders over from my old drive to the new one. One problem, however, is my sites folder. Originally, I had them located in /library/webserver/sites/, but now they're just in /Users/.../sites. \nIf I try to create a new folder within any of the subfolders, it will prompt me for my admin password. The same happens in Coda when I'm trying to add a new folder, but there it just denies me.\nBasically, how can I fix the permissions on these files so that I no longer need to enter my admin password?

I would not want to lose my carefully chosen notification settings though so a \"temporarily do not disturb me\" would be perfect.\nNote: this is for OS X, not iOS...\n\nA: You can option click on the notification center icon in the menu to quickly enable or disable alerts and banners.\n(Notifications are temporarily disabled and will be automatically reenabled the next day)\n\nA: Make sure that Notifications are visible and then scroll down (I pull down with 2 fingers with natural scrolling on my trackpad), a new option Show Alerts and Banners with a toggle switch appears at the top, turn that off.\nWhen you want them back on, repeat the process and turn it back on.\n", "Q: Prevent dock from auto-showing on mouse over I currently have dock to auto-hide and would like it to stay hidden until I explicitly show it using a keyboard shortcut such as the \"Move focus to dock\" or \"Turn Dock Hiding On/Off\". I basically don't want it to inadvertently pop open when I move mouse to the edge of the screen (e.g., to access a scrollbar in a fullscreen app), and get in the way. I tried moving it to the left, which slightly reduced the inconvenience, but I am still ending up triggering it, as I use many apps in fullscreen mode, and tend to reach out to all sides. Since I am a heavy keyboard user, I don't mind occasionally using keyboard to select something in the dock (I map Ctrl+Esc to move focus to dock, and type the first one or two chars of the app to select it and press  to run it).\nI have come across workarounds that work well to (effectively permanently) disable it, but not good for my use case. E.g., this one to slow it down and this one to make it one pixel high and http://www.chaoticsoftware.com/extras.html.\nI looked through all the dock defaults by running command defaults find .dock, and nothing seemed relevant, but may be I missed something because it wasn't obvious, or may be because it has no entry (like a hidden default?). Anybody has any solutions or ideas?\n\nA: There's another hidden preference for the delay before the animation starts:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -float 9999999\nosascript -e 'quit app \"Dock\"'\n\nIt doesn't affect full screen windows though.\nThis would increase the delay to about a second:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -float 0.5\n\n", "Q: Display a notification with AppleScript I would like to trigger a notification with AppleScript.\nI have seen How can I trigger a Notification Center notification from an AppleScript or shell script? but I would like to have a native AppleScript solution if it exists.\n\nA: Growl has an AppleScript dictionary.

I ordered my brand new Macbook Air with 8 GB RAM and picked up from Apple Store two days ago. However after fully running out of battery for first time, I recharged it to 100% and coconutBattery says the capacity is 97%.\nI think 3% is considerably high for Macbook batteries, they can still last at 70%-80% capacity after 2-3 years.\nIs this normal, or should I return the device? Any thougts are appreciated.\n\n\nA: This seems well within the range I've seen. What really matters is how the voltage decays and you won't know if the battery is performing until you've had it through about 5 charge and discharge cycles.\nIf you are worried that your battery isn't going to perform, don't. With details like this, you can make a case for a battery swap from Apple before the one year warranty expires. With tools like pmset -g batt and the one you are using, a bad battery is one of the easiest things to diagnose and get fixed on a Mac these days.\n\nA: Unplug, let it drain a few percent and replug it back in and see if it restores the percentage. Some times the menulet shows under, but then comes back after a quick decrease before recharging.\n", "Q: Launch an app upon certain external trigger In iOS 6 and with the iPhone 5 is there any way (even if it is a 3rd party app) to do the follwing things?\n1) Lanch a certian application when\na) I pass a geo-fence (e.g. arrive home)\nb) I get logged in to a WiFi hotspot with a certain SSID\nc) the device is plugged to a power source\n2) Close a certain application when\na) I pass a geo-fence (e.g. leave home)\nb) GPS/Geo/Location is turned off\nc) WiFi is turned \nd) I get logged out from a WiFI hotspot with a certain SSID\ne) the device is unplugged from a power source\n\nA: U.S. Patent No. 8,254,902, otherwise known as \"Apparatus and methods for enforcement of policies upon a wireless device,\" was granted in late-August, and would allow phone policies to be set to \"chang[e] one or more functional or operational aspects of a wireless device [...] upon the occurrence of a certain event.\"\nApple was awarded this patent over the summer. They are looking at ways to disable features like the camera when in range of a certain AP, for example a AP near a locker room or bathroom or at concert and so on.....\nHopefully third party apps can find a way to take advantage of this as well.\nApple Location Software\nLink above explains it in much more detail.\n", "Q: How can I enter a shortcode on a 4G iPad?

An unknown error occured (0xE8000084)\nI've tried Googling for this error and no one else seems to have it.\n\nA: This issue is because the iPhone 3GS isn't compatible with the newer iTunes software. I've been trying for ages and the only option I have come across so far is to take the phone to an Apple Store. I have tried everything. I have tried calling apple, chatting with them online and I have even tried to download an old version of iTunes but nothing works. Maybe give apple a call and see if they can give you any advice. Probably will tell you to take the phone into the store\n", "Q: Why did my iPhone's GPS tracking get so bad? I started using the Nike+ GPS app on my iPhone 4 (not 4s) to track my running in summer 2011. The GPS measurement of runs was pretty consistent: runs on the same course would vary as much as a tenth of a mile from run to run, but I know GPS is not always as accurate as it is precise, so that doesn't bother me.\nSometime in September of this year (2012) the accuracy of my run tracking went way down. I had a few where the distance was under-measured by as much as 50%. I thought it might have been Nike+, but I installed Strava Run and had another run massively over-measured. Last weekend a 6-mile run (measured using gmap-pedometer.com) was measured as 0.17 miles on Nike+. (The Nike+ app, to its credit, has been regularly warning me that the GPS signal is \"weak\", so even it is dubious about the quality of its data.)\nHowever, in non-running applications, location services seem to be just fine. Maps places me in the right place. Weather apps (Dark Sky is my best example) know exactly where I am. Are they using something else to get my location? Reading this question and this one make me think this could be a hardware problem, but the inconsistency between apps puzzles me.\nETA: I have not yet installed the iOS 6 update, so this is still iOS 5.\n\nA: I regularly experienced similar problems with RunKeeper on my iPhone 4S where distance was over-measured. When reviewing the plotted map of my run I could see the coordinates jumping a bit erratically from one point to the other, accounting for the extra distance, and this for entire outdoor runs, not just sporadicly on spots with bad GPS reception.\nNormal run:\n\nBugged run:\n\nWhile I cannot give a definitive answer as to why this problem occurs, and why the iPhone seems to get stuck in this bugged state when it does, completely rebooting the iPhone (and possibly additionally toggling Flight Mode to reboot the antennas as well) seemed to always resolve it for a few days or even weeks.\nOn a sidenote, since I upgraded to my iPhone5 (with iOS 6 ofcourse), the problem has not presented itself again so far. Perhaps the problem was fixed in either iOS or in the hardware meanwhile.\n", "Q: How can I dismiss the App Store banner in Notification Center without taking an action? This is the notification that pops up from the App Store on Mountain Lion:\n\nAs you can see, the only options are Details and Update. Most of these banners have a 'close' button, to dismiss the notification without taking an action. On this one though, it seems like the only action I can take is opening the App Store with it. \nJust clicking the x in the Notification Center list doesn't get rid of this actual notification. \nHow can I close this without taking the time to open up the App Store? \n\nA: To dismiss the notification temporarily: \nClick and hold the banner and flick it to the right to put that notification in Notification Center. If you are using a Trackpad, You can hover over the alert and use two fingers to flick it to the left.\nThe notification will still remain in the Notification Center until you update.\nUnfortunately, there is currently no way to dismiss the notification permanently.\n\nA: Yep, duci9y's answer is the only real way to \"dismiss\" it. Unfortunately, Apple does not allow you to alter the type of notification. Therefore, there is never a close button. Now, if you are using a non-apple mouse, then you will have some problems doing duci9y's answer. I believe the only way you can dismiss it with a regular mouse would be to click on the notification button on the top right of the screen and then turn off notifications and then turn it back on. \nIt's not convenient, but that's how it works.\n\nA: You can turn off this notification. It's annoying AF. Go to your System Preferences and then to Software Update... UNCHECK THAT BOX for Automatically check for updates.\nThat banner will leave you alone now! Good Riddance.\nmr.\n\nA: Clicking on the banner itself -- not either of the buttons -- opens the App Store.\nYou can Quit or Close the App Store window, and the banner disappears.\nI just discovered this, so I don't know whether it will come back . . .\n\nA: on terminal\nlaunchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist\n\nsource:\nhttp://osxdaily.com/2012/08/06/disable-notification-center-remove-menu-bar-icon-os-x/\n", "Q: Batch Video Transcoding for the web OS X (GUI, not command line) Is there a way to batch transcode video files to mp4 and webm for HTML5 videos in OS X?\nOur video department needs to hand over a lot of videos in multiple formats consistently. Workflow current consists of utilizing Adobe Media Encoder for the MP4s and Miro Video Converter for the WebM files. \nThe video guys are all very familiar with Adobe Media Encoder, so the ultimate solution would be to have everything run through there, but Adobe doesn't look like any time in the near future they're going to support WebM -- still pushing Flash player.\nMiro Video Converter works great, but is lacking a way to queue/batch files. \nI've Googled but have yet to come up with a good GUI-based solution the video team can use for batching the multiple formats need to ensure videos work on the web everywhere.\n\nA: You should have a look on Sorenson Squeeze. \nIt is a professionnal video encoding software supporting a lot of formats including WebM, mp4(h264).\nIt has an intuitive GUI like Adobe Media Encoder.\n\nA: After posting this question, we ended up getting licenses for iSkySoft and for testing purposes, us developers use the newest version of Miro Video Converter which now has a batching option.\n", "Q: Mac doesn't reboot after reinstall of OS X This it what I did\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the recovery partition\n\n*erase your whole disk using disk utility...importany you erase all partitions.\n\n*After deleting all the data, select \"Reinstall Mac OS X\".\n\n\nMaybe i did something wrong with erase options,i really don't know, after the reinstall all partitions removed and (Mac OS X Base System ) only remain, with this screen\n\nwhat should i do now ?\n\nA: For some reason, the NVRAM either lost the pointer to where the install package was located to run it after the boot, or the data written has some minor (or major) problem and now your Mac can't find any bootable images.\nThe self help options are to power it off and:\n\n\n*\n\n*Attempt running Internet Recovery if you have an internet connection restarting your Mac and holding down the Command key and the R key (Command-R).

I know how to delete a podcast subscription form the iOS 6 podcast app (How to delete a podcast from new iOS 6 Podcast app?) but I'm having trouble deleting multiple episodes within a subscription.  \nEven if I have it set to save only \"unplayed\" and I mark everything as played, I still see hundreds of episodes listed (but not downloaded).  I realize they're not taking up space, but I'd prefer the list to be clean and just show the most recent / unplayed episodes.\nIn iOS 6 in general, is there a way to do a multiple select before a \"swipe to delete\"?  Or is there any other way to delete multiple instances of something without having to do it one at a time?\n\nA: The Podcasts app was updated for iOS 7 on October 22. I don’t think that this was a feature of iOS 6’s Podcast app, but if you are able to update to the latest version, there is an Edit button that can delete/mark-as-read multiple episodes or multiple subscriptions. (Assuming you’re not running an older device that isn’t compatible).\nThere isn’t a way to so multiple selects before a swipe to delete, though most apps have an “Edit” button to select multiple items before hitting the Delete button (as seen in Mail). In third-party apps, the interface depends on what the designer/developer built.\n", "Q: Can a Keyboard Shortcut be Set to Connect to VPN? I now this may sound quite lazy, but I connect to a VPN several times a day (since the laptop gets disconnected from time to time).\nI am aware of the \"Show VPN Status in the Menubar\" option, but is there a way I can make it a keyboard shortcut?\n\nA: You could create an AppleScript which would run a shell script to racoonctl - the specific commands will depend upon your VPN connection.  Then use Script Utility to enable the global Script Menu, then add a new keyboard shortcut in System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts, and assign it to the script (or use a launcher utility such as Quicksilver).\n\nA: *\n\n*Open the Automator utility and create a new \"Service\" workflow.\n. Set the workflow to receive \"no input\" in \"any application\" in the top-most menus.\n\n*Add the \"Run AppleScript\" action to the workflow, and replace its script contents with the following:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell current location of network preferences\n        set VPN to \"SERVICE NAME\"\n        set VPNactive to connected of current configuration of service VPN\n        if VPNactive then\n            disconnect service VPN\n        else\n            connect service VPN\n        end if\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nBe sure to replace SERVICE NAME with the name of your VPN connection, which can be looked up in the Network system preferences (if the name is truncated, click the Advanced... button and view the full name at the top of the Advanced Settings panel).\n\n*Save the workflow with a name like \"Connect to VPN\"\n\n*When this is finished, go to the Keyboard system preferences and select the Keyboard Shortcuts tab, where you can locate the \"Connect to VPN\" service in the Services section, and assign a custom keyboard shortcut to it. You should now be able to toggle your VPN connection on and off from within any application by using this shortcut.\n\n\nI personally assign `Control + Option + Command + V' to toggle my VPN.\nFrom cnet.\n", "Q: What makes a \"Special folder\" - a bundle in the finder I know applications are just folder bundles - I assume specifically formatted, and some metadata. I did a copy of my iPhoto Library from another disk - at first it was just another folder, then once I ran iPhoto, it became special again.\nWhat makes a folder a bundle? and how do i restore that metadata on a disk recovery?\n\nA: The extension of the folder determines if the folder is a special folder. For example, apps have the extension .app, Kernel Extensions have the extensions .kext, etc.\nSome folders, like the iPhoto Library, have extended attributes. They can be determined by running ls -@l in the parent directory of your folder. The attribute com.apple.FinderInfo stores the type of the folder. \nThe easiest way to copy the attributes, in my personal opinion, is to use the ditto Terminal command to copy the files. It works just like cp, except that it also ensures that extended attributes are copied.\n", "Q: In iOS 6, how can I convince Siri that New York City is not in Texas? This is NOT a rant about maps or its data.\nI live in New York City, and when I ask Siri for the weather, the results seemed a bit... optimistic.  I think it unlikely, for example, that it will be 84 degrees here in NYC on this brisk October afternoon.\nAfter getting the same (much too warm) results when asking for the generic \"weather here\" as well as \"the weather in New York City, New York,\" I clicked through the Yahoo button to their webapp, which confirmed that while Siri \"knows\" I'm physically in New York City, NY, that somehow results in a query to yahoo for New York, TX.\nIf I go straight to the Apple Weather app, it works fine:  both the current location and a directly-typed entry for New York, NY report the correct high of 57 degrees.   \nSo the problem appears to be somewhere between Siri's text parsing (which is working) and Yahoo.\nI've tried this on two friends' devices with the same results.\nHas anyone found a fix?\n\nA: This is a legitimate bug with Siri: http://www.macrumors.com/2012/09/24/siri-delivering-wrong-weather-forecasts-for-common-city-names/\nThe bug has to be fixed on Apple's end (or Yahoo's, or wherever exactly the problem is occurring).\nBut you can work around it temporarily by asking for the weather in \"Zip Code 10028\" (or whatever).  Note that you seem to have to say \"Zip Code\" - just using the number doesn't seem to work.\nThat's a bit surprising that you're seeing it now since it first popped up almost three weeks ago – you'd think they would have fixed it by now. I guess all you can do is wait and it'll resolve itself at some point.\n", "Q: List of connected users Sometimes, when need restart my Lion server, it warns me about the \"connected users\".\nHow is possible to show who is connected?\n\nA: Using the serveradmin command-line utility, you can send a command to the smb or afp file sharing daemons.  Running the following will return an array of users, including their ipAddress, login time, and account name.\nserveradmin command smb:command = getConnectedUsers\nserveradmin command afp:command = getConnectedUsers\n\nA typical line of output (for the user name) would appear as\nsmb:usersArray:_array_index:0:name = \"user_foo\"\n...\nsmb:usersArray:_array_index:1:name = \"user_bar\"\n\nIf all you are concerned about is the user names,\nserveradmin command smb:command = getConnectedUsers | awk -F '\"' '/:name/ { print $2 }'\n\nawk -F splits lines on the \" , while  /:name/ only operates on lines matching :name.  The $2 takes the second column of text (divided by \"), which is the user name.\nuser_foo\nuser_bar\n\n\nA: Try running the following terminal command to see the IP addresses of connected users:\nnetstat -f inet -n | grep '.548 ' | awk '{ print $5 }'   | sed 's/\\.[^.]*$//'\n\n", "Q: Mountain Lion System Freeze - Poor Memory Handling? Useful details: Core2Duo mid 2010 Macbook Air, 128Gb SSD, 2Gb RAM.\nSince I upgraded to Mountain Lion I've had this occur a few times. I'll be running my system and it'll completely freeze, no response to keyboard or trackpad other than the ability to hard power off. \nIn general it's when I have VirtualBox, Safari, Sublime Text 2, Terminal and Spotify running, but it'll be fine up until some unknown point and then thats it. Occasionally it'll unfreeze and I'll have messages about UI updates being suspended by (insert app here), but most of the time it forces the fans on high and starts trying to crunch on something. \nMountain Lion seems a bit snappier than Snow Leopard was for me on  this machine, but it seems to be a large chunk worse for memory management, has anyone run across similar issues? Starting points for me to try optimise?\n\nA: Since re-install Mountain Lion my system freezing very often (randomly). It seems like disk freeze for 15-30sec. I suspect some bug. But after huge effort to investigate problem I found that in my case the solution is to delete sysem logs.\nIn terminal:\nsudo rm /var/log/*\n\nI don't know what was wrong (it was clean install of ML) but it work for me (two days until now) and looks stable.\n", "Q: Is there an application for creating an text inventory of media files and/or applications For insurance purposes, I would like to keep a list of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*All of the movie files on my Mac\n\n*All of the music files on my Mac\n\n*All of the applications on my Mac\n\n\nThe lists needs to be updated regularly, and stored in the cloud (not iCloud). Being able to save the list files to a dropbox folder would be just fine. It should also be able to index network locations.\nThese files are from multiple sources, so I can not rely on the 'Purchased' functionality on iTunes (for example).\nIs anyone aware of an application that can do this? I could not find much on Google.\n\nA: I would say the best way to do this would be some sort of script that searches your drive on a scheduled basis, and dumps the results into a text file for you.\nSomething like:\nsudo find / -name \"*.avi\" -o -name \"*.mp4\" -o -name \"*.m4v\" -o -name \"*.mp3\" > ~/Dropbox/results.txt\n\nThe -o switch is the find equivalent of logical OR, so the above is searching the whole of your computer for any files (or directories) that have the extensions .avi, .mp4, .m4v, or .mp3\n\nA: I would suggest Delicious Library 2!\nIt allows you to create a catalogue of books, movies, software and many more from your physical CDs, books, or games by scanning the barcodes.\nFor digital media it does have support for Kindle ebooks out of the box, however if you want to add other digital media such as video or non-iTunes music, then you have to add it manually as there are no processes to find or import these items except those you write yourself using AppleScript.\n", "Q: iPhone Contact Sync I have a new iPhone, which is synced with iTunes for music. I have around 200 contacts on here - I read somewhere if I now sync my iPhone with Exchange, it will overwrite all my contacts, leaving me with only the contacts from my Exchange account.

I want to remove the automatic ratings from my songs:\n\nHowever, they don't disappear after right-click->Rating->None\n\nA: I have a smart playlist that displays songs with \"No Rating\" in order to listen to, rate them, and put them in the applicable playlists I have. My problem was that the Auto Rating for an album would give all other songs on the album (that the song I just rated was part of) a grayed out rating. Then when the Smart Playlist updated it would delete the grayed out songs from my playlist and I would have unrated songs floating around.\nTo combat this I enabled half-star ratings for my iTunes. http://www.instructables.com/id/How-To-Enable-Half-Stars-In-Itunes/\nI was using 1 star to denote a song to be deleted. (Wayyyy to much music in my itunes) But I changed that system to use a 1/2 star rating to denote deletion.\nThis is because the best way to keep songs from being removed from my \"Unrated\" smart playlist was to do this.\nGo to music, playlist view.\nSort songs by rating.\nGo to the first song that has no rating.\nClick it (It should be highlighted blue)\nNow, scroll alllll the way down to the last song.\nHOLD SHIFT and click that last song.\nNow all of the No Rating songs are highlighted.\nRight click,\nRating, 1 star.\nI then updated the smart playlist to show songs with a 1 star rating.\nNow, rating one song in an album will not change the ratings of the others in the same album and my Smart Playlist functions as intended.\nI'm currently 22% of my way through rating and sorting my 14220 songs. This 'fix' will save me a lot of time of having to go write down all the albums that iTunes automatically rated, then go to album view and one by one unrate the albums.\nIf you would like a somewhat easier way to unrate albums. Right click on the bar where \"artists\" \"songs\" \"time\" \"rating\" is and add the \"Album Rating\" to the bar.\nNow sort using that button and just look for the darkened star ratings. click 1 song in that album to highlight it. Then click and hold in the Album Rating for that song and drag to the left to give it \"No Rating\".\nTL:DR  I finally found a way to keep iTunes from pissing me off and wasting hours of my time.\n\nA: That is because the songs inherit an \"estimate rating\" from the album rating. If you want to remove these stars, you need to remove the album rating.\nClick on the left of the stars from the album the song belongs:\n\nthey are now gone:\n\nApparently, this is the only way to change the album rating (the right-click menu doesn't show any options to change the rating).\n\nA: I FIGURED IT OUT!   \nWhen you add a column view called 'Album Rating', it adds an Album Rating item in your right click menu also called Album Rating directly below Song Rating.  Return to Album View, right click on the album cover and select NONE in Album Rating and it clears it....\n", "Q: Configure QuickLook to open particular files I'm wondering if there's a way to get QuickLook open up files it doesn't recognize.\nFor example, I'd like to be able to have QuickLook view .mailsignature files in the basic text viewer.

I want it to continue backing up, until it finishes the backup, even when I close the lid of my computer in the middle of a backup.  Is there a way to do that?\n\nA: Your observation of how Time Machine is backing up is the same as mine. If TM is running a backup and you put your machine to sleep it will resume that backup on wake, but it will not keep your Air awake when you close the lid Unless you wish to prevent your Air from going to sleep when you close the lid, this is the expected behavior.\nTime Machine takes its sweet time, especially if you have a chunk of data that needs to be backed up. I tend to let my backup finish by plugging in my machine and running Caffeine and then putting it to sleep later. The truth is, though, I've never had a real problem with the backup restarting on wake.\n", "Q: Adding SMB share to sidebar in OSX Mountain Lion Is there a way to add an SMB share to the sidebar in Finder, such that when I click on the alias, it mounts the share and opens it up like a regular folder? You can do this in Linux and Windows, and if I recall correctly, OSX Lion.\nIt doesn't work on Mountain Lion (10.8.[0-2]).\n\nA: It works on 10.8.2 without creating an alias. You can drag the shared folder to the sidebar. It will auto mount after you have disconnected.\n", "Q: Why does iPhone Safari not save login credentials for a certain Wi-Fi hotspot? My Academy's wi-fi requires me to log in via a web-browser portal page before I have access to the internet. Safari on my iPhone doesn't save my username and password for it. Is there a way to manually force it to save them?\n\nA: check out this link http://www.ausbt.com.au/how-to-save-passwords-in-safari-on-the-ipad-iphone to setup autofill name and passwords for safari on IOS.\nAnd it totally is a matter of safari not remembering username/password.\nIt's a little hidden, but it's there, and thanks for asking a good question. The other answerers here must never have logged into a captive portal before or something.\n\nA: Do you really need to log in using Safari?\nOtherwise you go to 'System Preferences' > 'Wi-Fi' > Select the appropriate network > Log in > Deselect 'Ask To Join Networks'\nThis way, your iPhone remembers this Wi-Fi network and your iPhone will automatically connect to this network when you're within the range of the academy Wi-Fi.\n\nA: If this is a \"captive portal\" - a wifi network where you need to input your password into a form on a web page, or check a box agreeing to terms of use, then in my experience the iPhone will not remember the password.\n\nA: It's not a matter of Safari not remembering the password, its a matter of the network requiring login based on the browser.  Most captive walled gardens require it with every disconnect for security purposes.  \n\nA: I had this problem. Turns out I was in Private Browsing mode.\n", "Q: Why can’t I share my Internet connection with another Mac? I tried to share my Internet connection with another Mac but it failed.

The only problem is I've forgotten the password.\nI have a good idea of the parts of the password and managed to generate a 3000 line file with a list of possible passwords.\nI would like to know how I can test these against my image. A few years ago, I had found a handy open source app with a simple GUI which did this, but I can't seem to find it. Maybe someone knows what app I'm talking about. Otherwise, if anyone knows an other method to do this (perhaps with automator), it would be great. \nThanks\n\nA: The hdiutil command combined with a bit of bash scripting can accomplish what you're looking for. You'll need a plain text file with each password on a separate line, ending with a blank line.\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy and paste this into a text file:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nwhile read line\ndo\n    echo -n \"$line\" | hdiutil attach -quiet -stdinpass \"$1\"\n    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n        echo \"Password is $line\"\n        break\n    fi\ndone < \"$2\"\n\n\n*Save it and make it executable by running chmod +x /path/to/scriptfile in Terminal.\n\n*In Terminal, run /path/to/scriptfile /path/to/image.dmg /path/to/passwords.txt.\n\n*\n\n*It will run until it successfully mounts the disk image, and will output the password that worked. In my tests, it took 1.3-1.6 seconds per password, so 3000 passwords may take around an hour, depending on your system (although it could be sooner depending on where the password is in the file).\n\n\n\nThat should do the trick. If you're curious how and why it works, read on.\nExplanation\nWhile loop\n    while read line\n    do\n    […]\n    done < \"$2\"\n\nThis loops over each line in the password file (which is fed in via the < \"$2\" part) and executes  the stuff between do and done each time it loops. $2 is a special variable in Bash that represents the second argument passed to the script (i.e. if you ran ./foo bar blah, $2 would be blah). It's enclosed in quotes in case there are any spaces or other characters in the name that could cause problems for Bash.\nMounting the image\nhdiutil attach -quiet -stdinpass \"$1\"`\n\nThis is the command to actually mount the disk image (which we get from the command line arguments via the $1 variable, just like the password file). The -quiet flag means don't print any output (just to keep things tidy), and -stdinpass means get the password from the command line, not the usual OS X password dialog.\necho -n \"$line\"\n\nThe echo command simply repeats the input it's given, which in this case is an individual line from the password file, from the $line variable (which is again quoted in case the passwords contain special characters). The -n flag is the final piece of this puzzle, it prevents echo from repeating the newline character, which would be included in the password (and thus prevent even the correct password from working).\nWe use echo with a \"pipe\" (|) to send hdiutil the password. A pipe sends the output of the preceding command (echo) to the command after the pipe (hdiutil). This way rather than asking us for the password, hdiutil simply takes the text we read from the file. \nChecking if the password was successful\nif [ $? -eq 0 ]\n\nThis checks if the previous command was successful, by checking its exit code. The $? is another special variable that stores the exit code of the previous operation.\nIf the exit code is 0 (no errors), then we know that the password worked, and the if statement runs these lines:\n    echo \"Password is $line\"\n    break\n\nThis displays a simple message telling the user what the successful password is, then the break command exits the while loop and ends the program. We do this because the script would otherwise continue until it's checked every password in the file.\nCombining all these pieces together gives you a convenient way of automating an otherwise long and painful task.\n\nA: After trying dozens of Google searches, I found the app I had used many years ago. \ncrowbarDMG -> https://www.georgestarcher.com/?p=228\nHere is the Python script I used to generate the password list:\nimport itertools\npermutations = list(itertools.permutations(['part', 'PART', 'other', 'OTHER', '9', '@', '4', '%', '9', '#'], 4))\nfor (i, permutation) in enumerate(permutations):\n    print ''.join(permutation)\n\nI then used crowbarDMG to discover the password.\n", "Q: Is it necessary to eject external drives before logging out, restarting, or shutting down? Is it necessary or recommended practice to eject external drives before logging out, restarting, or shutting down? (The drives are not being unplugged.)\nBTW, I am aware that I need to eject my external drives before unplugging them, I just don't know if it's necessary when logging out or shutting down. It seems to me this should be obvious, but I can't find an explicit answer to this question anywhere. I am interested in answers for Snow Leopard, Lion & Mountain Lion OS versions, as I have 2 machines, one with Snow Leopard, the other with Lion, & I'll soon be upgrading Lion to Mountain Lion.\n\nA: There is nothing to gain from explicitly \"ejecting\" drives before logging pout, shutting down, or restarting in a normal fashion. MacOS X has a subsystem called \"Disk Arbitration\" (primarily the system daemon process \"diskarbitrationd\") which mounts drives other than the boot device when a user logs in and unmounts (a.k.a. \"ejects\") them when the user logs out. Because it operates outside of the context of a user login session, diskarbitrationd is able to assure that processes which are not directly managed by a user (Spotlight indexing, Time Machine, other users' login sessions, etc.) are dealt with correctly when unmounting devices. It also checks for (& usually can quietly repair) filesystem corruption issues before mounting drives. At a deeper level, the OS also  has a daemon (update) which flushes the filesystem cache to disk every 30 seconds and a carefully scripted process for shutting down (i.e. the first half of restarting) which assures that all filesystem devices are properly synched and unmounted before resetting or powering down the system. MacOS X is unique in this respect only in the fine details: all significant OS's have matured beyond the need to have users manually assure that drives aren't unmounted in a \"dirty\" state. \nThe possible exceptions would be if you do something outside of the operating system to halt or reset the system, such as disconnecting the main power or forcing a hardware reset by a long-press of the power switch. Both could cause filesystem corruption, but no one should be taking such steps except in rare and severe cases where one likely won't have the luxury of being able to manually eject drives. (e.g. smoke, flames, kernel panics, etc.)\n\nA: No, it's only recommended when unplugging the cable.\nThe reason why you eject is so that any processes reading and writing from the disk will cause OS X to notify you of the disk being in use and prevent data corruption that can occur by just unplugging the disk while it's in use.\nAdditionally the OS might queue different write operations to a cache before actually writing them to disk, and ejecting will make sure these are flushed to the drive before it is disconnected.\nHalting any processes from reading/writing to the disk and flushing the caches is implied when rebooting or shutting down the machine (unless you do a cold shutdown by pressing and holding the power button to turn it off). When logging out, the OS can flush the cache at its own discretion.\n\nA: No. The short answer is that you eject/unmount a storage device when you no longer wish to use it.\nIt is perfectly fine to leave an external drive plugged in if you want it available later for yourself or others (such as a Time Machine back up).\n", "Q: How do I find my Apple ID connected to my iphone if the phone has been lost? I've lost my phone and in order to access iCloud I need my Apple ID however I don't remember the one that is linked to my iPhone.  What can I do to find this out?\n\nA: There doesn't seem to be any easy way to do this.\nTo do it by trial and error, you can go to the iCloud web-site and login with each of your Apple IDs and try the \"Find my iPhone\" feature to locate it and/or send a message/tone to it.\nIf you have any other iOS devices with a similar setup, you can check on them as well.\n\nA: There's isn't really a way. I guess you could check iTunes or iCloud settings on your computer to see what account it used?\nAs well, Apple's iForgot has a tool that will help you find out which one of your email addresses is an Apple ID.\n", "Q: What is the meaning of the check box and circle in this iTune U \nIf it means watched, then I saw the check box is over there even though I selected unwatched column.\nDoes it mean downloaded? There is no tool tips and it's kind of silly to have 2 columns expressing the same thing.\nThe checkbox may means downloaded. What about the circle to the left of the checkboxes?\n\nA: The checkbox is a tool for downloaded items to specify if you want that specific item to sync to your device. There is a setting in your iTunes device list to sync only checked items in iTunes:\n\nIf you have that setting turned on, unchecking any song or video will tell iTunes not to sync that item to your device during the next sync.\nThe circle is a progress indicator for downloaded items: \n\n\n*\n\n*A filled circle indicates that the item is unplayed.\n\n*A half circle indicates that the item is partially played.\n\n*No circle indicates that the item has been played to completion.\n\n\nA: The blue circle tells you how much of the media file your have played. A full circle means that it has never been played or has been marked as unplayed. A half circle means it has been partially played. No circle means it has been fully played.\nAs for the checkboxes, they are just for marking purposes and can have multiple functions. You can create a new playlist with the marked files, sync them to an iDevice, tell iTunes only to play marked files, etc.\nOf course, a file you have not downloaded will not have a checkbox, as it does not exist on your computer.\n\nA: Check box is for you to check when you have completed a lesson.  The circles gradually fill  up as you complete the lesson.  \n", "Q: How to stop iPhone users from sending iMessages and send SMS instead I used to have an iPhone, but I changed to an android (shock, horror!).

It for once disables all flash content on the webpage, and when clicked transforms the flash content to an HTML5 video.\nDo we have an equivalent ClickToPlugin extension for Firefox?\n\nA: NoScript\n...can block plugins which you enable once via click-to-play or permanently by white-listing domains that they load content from.\n\nWhile its primary aim is preventing malicious JavaScript from running, NoScript effectively blocks Java™, Silverlight™, Flash®, and other plugins and embeddings (such HTML video/audio elements and downloadable fonts) on sites you didn't explicitly whitelisted.\nJava Applets, Flash movies/applications, Quicktime clips, PDF documents and other content won't be even downloaded from sites where you consider them annoyances or dangers, saving your bandwidth and increasing your navigation speed.\n\nNoScript's settings for blocking plug-ins can be found in:\nNoScript Preferences → Embedded Content\nOverall though, I'd not recommend this add-on if your goal it to merely to reduce  noise. NoScript has been written first to block javascript and it is a wonderful tool for that.\nHowever, because it's so powerful and configurable, it can be difficult to use for newcomers and takes a while to setup.\n", "Q: update programs installed by other user (other appleID) I use a mac install before by another user.

I'm thinking of disabling the option to sync apps with iTunes.  I realize this will wipe them from my device, I'm willing to do this once.\nWhat am I going to lose by this?  Right now it adds what I feel to be unnecessary time to syncing (I like to sync podcasts, music and have a backup on my Mac), and I often get apps restored to the phone that I want deleted!\nWill restoring my device from backup still work as expected?  Or does that require syncing apps to iTunes?  I see little reason to have a copy of the apps on my computer.  Unless that is the only way to have a backup of the apps user data as well..\nThanks.\n\nA: iOS is a beautifully designed operating system. Part of what makes it so great is the troubleshooting protocol, which is basically: (1) power cycle the device or (2) restore from a backup. I have an iPad and iPhone 4S that have separate configurations but are linked to the same iTunes user ID. This means that while I effectively have all the same apps available to me, I don't have to have them installed on both devices. As an example, my wife and son went out of town last week. I removed all of my apps that had important data that syncs between everything (he's 14 months old, and has an uncanny knack for manipulating the iPad in only the most unfortunate of ways), added some new videos and infant-appropriate games, and so forth. Basically I configured it to be an entertainment device specific for him, for that trip. When they return I'll simply connect it to my Mac and restore it to the state it was in the moment before they left. Gorgeous, simple, and hassle-free.  \nThe point is that Through iTunes, you have pretty granular control over what gets synced between your computer and the device. As far as backups go, see this article for detailed information about what does and doesn't get backed up to your computer. Of course, you can also backup information to iCloud. This is similar, but not identical to, the backup on your computer. This article lists what gets sent to iCloud. Having trouble deciding which service(s) to use? Apple even provides some pros and cons to consider in this article. As far as I know and can tell, stopping app syncing does not erase the apps, it merely stops backing them up beyond the current backup state. Deleting an app directly from your iPhone, however, \"...will also delete all of it's data\" (per the iOS warning message). That part is fairly transparent and self-explanatory.\nIf you don't want an application to be re-added to your iPhone, just use the \"Apps\" panel in iTunes and deselect the check boxes next to the apps that you've deleted from the device. You can also de/select the check box labelled \"Automatically sync new apps.\" This will prevent them from showing up again. Rinse and repeat for the other panels (e.g., Music, Photos). If time is a factor when it comes to syncing podcasts (this is mostly what I sync, too), I would try to do it at a time of day when it's a non-issue, like when you're eating breakfast or engaged in some other routine. Let it sync when you won't be messing with it anyway, and it is immediately a non-issue. \nHope this helps with your question!\n\nA: In theory there is no specific reason to sync apps to your computer if you download them all via the App Store on the iPhone. In practice I can think of at least two:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you delete the app and it gets pulled from the store later, you can't install it again\n\n*Similar if you delete an app and this app gets an upgrade requiring an iOS version newer than your iPhone is compatible with, you can't install it again\n\n\nIn addition I'm not sure whether app settings get synced/backed up if you don't sync the app.\n", "Q: Displaying 'note keys/labels' on Garageband for iOS (specifically iPad) I'm wondering if there is a way to display all the 'note letters' on the keys in the Keyboard on GarageBand for iOS. \nAt the moment it only displays the 'C notes' - for example C2, C3 and C4. \nI have no 'music-based technical knowledge' or expertise and would appreciate any help in being able to see all the notes displayed.\nThanks for your help!\n\nA: In order to enable note labels, you have to open\n“Settings” > “GarageBand” \nand than you are able to toggle “Keyboard Note Labels”.\n\n\nA: I'm pretty certain that there is no setting to overlay the note names on each key of the GarageBand-IOS keyboard.

As a result, this isn't a good solution unless there is a way to cache the PDF locally.\nI've looked in iBooks for some way to do this but nothing obvious is jumping out at me.\n\nA: First simple way, it requires Google Drive, however.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the iOS Google Drive app, upload your desired PDF and get the link of said PDF.  \n\n*Open iOS Safari and open the link in the browser; you should now see the PDF in Safari.\n\n*Click \"Share\" and then \"Add to Home Screen\". \nSecond complicated way, but goes to iBook; you will need Workflow the app.\n\n\n*\n\n*Get Workflow the app; open it, create a new workflow (click plus sign)\n\n*Find the \"action\" Get File and drag it to the right \"building area\".   \n\n*In the Get File action, uncheck \"Show Document Picker\"; you will see two new formlists pop up.\n\n*In the \"iCloud File\" form, type in any name, for now lets go with name.pdf; it should now look like: \n\n\n\niCloud File  /Workflow/name.pdf\n\n\n\n*Search the actions again for the action \"Open in iBooks\" and drag it over as well.\n\n*Swith to laptop (easier) and you must get the desired PDF, rename it to name.pdf, copy/move it to your iCloud Drive and into the Workflow folder. \n(if it doesn't exist, make a Workflow iCloud Account via the app)\n\n*Go back to the app, test the workflow we built by pressing the play button and it should open the PDF in iBook! \n\n*Lastly, press the gear and then press \"Add to Homescreen\", and ta-da! You now created a button on your homescreen to open your pdf in iBook!\n\n\nA: With the help of iOS 14 Widgets I wrote the app \"Folder Shortcuts @ Homescreen\", so you can access your folders directly from the Homescreen of your iPad or iPhone. https://apps.apple.com/us/app/folder-shortcuts-homescreen/id1559416278\n\n\nA: You can now do this with iCloud Drive, Shortcuts and a PDF reader.\n\n*\n\n*Copy the PDF file into the Files app and save it into the 'Shortcuts' folder (has to be located here or a subfolder under Shortcuts).\n\n*Open the Shortcuts app and create a new shortcut.\n\n*Add the 'Documents' action called 'Get File' and select:\n\n*\n\n*Service: iCloud Drive\n\n*Show Document Picker: unchecked\n\n*File Path: path to file under 'Shortcuts' folder eg. book.odf\n\n*Error if not found: can leave it checked or not\n\n\n\n*Add the Documents action called 'Open in...'\n\n*Uncheck 'Show Open in Menu'\n\n*Make sure it says Open 'File' in then click to select your PDF reader app.\n\n\nA: iBooks has an itms-books:// URL scheme, but according to Apple (second hand via this forum post), it's only  usable for ebooks and books in the iBooks store, not arbitrary PDFs.\n", "Q: Hide the Finder sidebar permanently I've Googled for this a little bit, and I wasn't able to find an obvious answer, so is it possible to hide the Finder sidebar completely?

Is it possible for a restored iPod touch to recover former apps that had been installed on an iPod touch?\nIs it possible for a deleted app to be re installed containing the same information from its previous use, and also still be signed in?\n\nA: If you restore using a backup that is recent, depending on the app, associated information will get restored (i.e. most games will generally have your high scores) as long as the app uses the standard way of storing data on an iOS device (which optionally involves iCloud).\nThis is the information that is at /var/mobile/Applications/{GUID}/Documents generally. Some apps do not store certain items there for security or space (in the backup, such as large in app purchase content) reasons.

It seems that iOS (6, on iPhone 5) does that too but doesn't recognize that this is the same calendar as the one in OSX.\nAs a result, when I sync all my OSX calendars with my iPhone, suddenly there are two birthday calendars, one seems to come from OSX and does not have the parcel icon. That calendar is called \"Birthdays\" when viewed in iOS. The other one seems to be the one intrinsic to iOS and just like in OSX has special parcel icon.\nI would have assumed that the two apps of the two OSes should figure out that this is basically the same calendar. To get rid of the double events in my calendar view in iOS I can uncheck that \"Birthdays\" calendar in iOS so that the events of this calendar are not displayed. But that calendar still gets synched from OSX and I can't uncheck the \"Birthdays\" calendar in the OSX iTunes sync settings because there this calendar is not listed.\nMy question is now, how do I get rid of the redundant calendar on the iPhone?  \n\n\nA: On the mac, turn off Birthday calendars in the Calendar app preferences.\n\nOn the iOS device, unselect the check next to the programmatic calendar to suppress those entries. Short of jailbreaking the device and patching the Calendar app, you can't suppress the package calendar - just show or hide it.\n\nAlternatively, you could purge all birthdays and anniversaries from all Contacts, but that seems too brute force to me when you can suppress each calendar with settings.

Let's say I  create a symbolic link of a directory on the NAS such as:\n[/share/Multimedia] # ln -s /share/MD0_DATA/Multimedia/test/ ./folder/symlink     \n\nIt works:\n[/share/Multimedia] # ls -la folder\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 admin  administ  34 Oct 14 19:24 symlink -> /share/MD0_DATA/Multimedia/test//\n\nI can also mv and cp files without problems to and from symlink when logged on the NAS.\nThis is the situation on the client-side, a Mac running 10.8.2:\nclient:~ myself$ id\nuid=501(myself) gid=20(staff) groups=20(staff),401(com.apple.access_screensharing),\n12(everyone),33(_appstore),61(localaccounts),79(_appserverusr),80(admin),\n81(_appserveradm),98(_lpadmin),100(_lpoperator),204(_developer)\n\nStrangely, the client doesn't recognize symlink as such; it's a normal directory instead (please note that according to the output I have rwx permissions):\nclient:folder myself$ ls -la\ndrwx------  1 myself  staff  16384 18 Okt 23:25 symlink\n\nThe same happens in the Finder, where the folder symlink doesn't appear as an alias, but as a normal folder.\nI can cd into symlink and I can also read files in it without problems. The same in the Finder.\nThe problem\nIf I try to write (mv or cp) a file into symlink on the client-side, it fails:\n client:folder myself$ mv test.txt symlink/\n mv: rename test.txt to symlink/test.txt: No such file or directory\n\nLikewise, any attempt to move or copy a file into symlink via drag-n-drop in the Finder returns the following error:\n\nThe operation cannot be completed because one or more required items cannot be found. (Error code = -43).\n\n(Moving/copying a file from symlink to another location on the NAS works just fine.)\nHere's the output of a write operation in the Terminal:\n client:symlink myself$ touch text.txt\n touch: text.txt: Permission denied\n\nInterestingly, I can successfully delete files which are already present:\n client:symlink myself$ ls -la\n total 64\n drwx------  1 myself  staff  16384 18 Okt 23:51 .\n drwx------  1 myself  staff  16384 18 Okt 23:48 ..\n -rwx------  1 myself  staff      5 18 Okt 23:51 text.txt\n client:symlink myself$ rm text.txt \n client:symlink myself$ ls -la\n total 64\n drwx------  1 myself  staff  16384 18 Okt 23:56 .\n drwx------  1 myself  staff  16384 18 Okt 23:48 ..\n\nI am really at loss on how to diagnose and solve this problem.\nThe relevant Apple kb states that Error -43 can have three causes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Illegal characters (none there)\n\n*Permissions (permissions seem fine, see the ls -la output above. I mount the share with the admin account of the NAS and I am logged in as an admin on my Mac client.)\n\n*Non-existent share point (the share exists and works well otherwise)\n\n\nAdditional informations\nHere's some more info for troubleshooting:\nThe global options in /etc/smb.conf on the NAS are set as follows:\n[global]\npassdb backend = smbpasswd\nworkgroup = WORKGROUP\nsecurity = USER\nserver string =\nencrypt passwords = Yes\nusername level = 0\nmap to guest = Bad User\nnull passwords = yes\nmax log size = 10\nsocket options = TCP_NODELAY SO_KEEPALIVE SO_SNDBUF=65536 SO_RCVBUF=65536\nos level = 20\npreferred master = no\ndns proxy = No\nsmb passwd file=/etc/config/smbpasswd   \nusername map = /etc/config/smbusers\nguest account = guest\ndirectory mask = 0777\ncreate mask = 0777\noplocks = yes\nlocking = yes\ndisable spoolss = yes\nload printers = no\nforce directory security mode = 0000\nveto files = /.AppleDB/.AppleDouble/.AppleDesktop/:2eDS_Store/Network Trash Folder/Temporary Items/TheVolumeSettingsFolder/.@__thumb/.@__desc/:2e*/\ndelete veto files = yes\nmap archive = no\nmap system = no\nmap hidden = no\nmap read only = no\ndeadtime = 10\nuse sendfile = yes\ndisplay charset = UTF8\nunix extensions = no\nstore dos attributes = yes\nclient ntlmv2 auth = yes\ndos filetime resolution = no\nmin receivefile size = 4096\ncase sensitive = auto\ndomain master = auto\nlocal master = yes\ninherit acls = yes\nwide links = yes\nfollow symlinks = yes\nwins support = no\nforce unknown acl user = yes\ntemplate homedir = /share/homes/DOMAIN=%D/%U\ndomain logons = no\n\nThe specific options:\n[Multimedia]\ncomment = System default share\npath = /share/MD0_DATA/Multimedia\nbrowsable = yes\noplocks = no\nftp write only = no\npublic = yes\ninvalid users =\nread list = @\"everyone\",\"gast\"\nwrite list = \"admin\",\"guest\"\nvalid users = \"root\",@\"everyone\",\"admin\",\"guest\",\"gast\"\ninherit permissions = yes\n\nThe logs on the client's side don't say much:\n/private/var/log/system.log (which includes kernel.log since 10.8) shows up occasional entries like:\n Oct 18 22:13:43 client kernel[0]: smb_iod_reconnect: Reconnected share MULTIMEDIA with server qnap-SAMBA._smb._tcp.local\n\nAnd /private/var/log/samba/ doesn't exist on my system.\nAny help is much appreciated.\n\nA: In your configuration, you have unix extensions = no which is fine, but that is why symbolic links on the server are showing up as folders and not aliases. In this mode the server resolves the symbolic links and the client never sees them. If the client tries to create a symbolic link, the server actually generates an alias file, not a host-OS symbolic link. Reasons for this include security (preventing someone from getting access to /etc/passwd on the server by creating a symbolic link to it) and client compatibility, as OS X and Windows and Unix have slightly different ideas about what constitutes a symbolic link but they pretty much agree on what is a directory or a file.\nPermissions issues with SAMBA are complex, so it's not clear that you do not have a permissions issue. Likewise symbolic like resolving is complex, so it is not clear that what you are doing should, in theory work, and there's always the possibility of a bug (most likely in the SAMBA server).\nWhen accessing a SAMBA server from a Mac, these identities and permissions are involved:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Mac User you are logged into the Mac as\n\n*The SAMBA user you are logged into the SAMBA server as\n\n*The SMABA server host OS user you get converted to\n\n*Unix-style file permissions \n\n*For NTFS and HFS+, associated file-system ACLs\n\n\nSo even though you have provided a lot of information, it's still not clear that you are not having permissions problems. The fact that you can mv and cp on the server (using what account?) does not mean you do not have a permissions problem preventing you from doing it on the client (using what accounts and with what effective account on the server?).\nIf the server is supporting ACLs and since you have options like inherit permissions = yes and inherit acls = yes set there could be some kind of ACL problem that is only allowing read access to directories accessed via symbolic links. There are several other avenues of investigation based on the server configuration.\nI would really expect you should be able to find more information in the SAMBA server logs than you have communicated. They should give you a much better sense of exactly what is being denied.\nFor what it is worth, I tried to duplicate your setup using an Ubuntu 12.04 host as the SAMBA server and could not reproduce your problem. Symbolic links worked for me as expected.\n", "Q: Is there any way to rename app name in lauchpad? I have 3 eclipses installed on my mac eclipse jee, eclipse for android and eclipse for php.\nall three eclipses are cooming in launchpad with the name eclipse.\nIs there any way i can rename app name like \neclipse jee, eclipse php, eclipse android in launchapad?\n\nA: You can by using an Administrator account and renaming the apps in Finder. LaunchPad will show the changed name accordingly.\nThere also is this app, which seems to make renaming items and other operations in LaunchPad possible. Unfortunately, it seems to be discontinued, so try it at your own risk.\nFinally, if you are comfortable with SQLite databases and SQL, you could manually make the necessary changes in the LaunchPad database. I'd advise you to first back up your database before you start tinkering with it. You can use the built-in sqlite3 command-line client to manipulate this database. You'll want to find the appropriate records in the apps table, and update their title field.\n\nA: Fer's answer works perfectly without the danger of renaming the apps. Perhaps it was misunderstood by some.\nThe easiest way to do this is to open Terminal, type ln -s (included trailing space) and drag the App to be \"renamed\" into the Terminal window twice. You should have the full path to the app in your command twice, modify the second path to rename the app, just keep the path the same.\nFor example, to rename \"Microsoft Remote Desktop\" to just \"Remote Desktop\":\nln -s /Applications/Microsoft\\ Remote\\ Desktop.app /Applications/Remote\\ Desktop.app\nYou don't even need to hide the original icon for the app in LaunchPad, as the new one replaces it.\n\nA: Create a symbolic link of your Launchpad app:\nln -s Launchpad.app Launchpad_renamed.app\n\n", "Q: How do I wipe my MBP drive to default? My MacBook Pro fell and is kinda cracked so since I have warranty from BestBuy, I want to do a complete wipe of the HDD and essentially restore it like it was brand new before I return it. (They’ll probably do it too, but I want to do it myself just to be sure.)\nI’ve backed up all my data and all I need to do is wipe it.\nWhat is the best way to go about this? I want to erase but obviously leave it in a working manner with OS on it etc.\nI thought I found the answer here, but that’s for an older OS and the MBA machine.\nI’m running the latest update of Mountain Lion.\n\nA: What you should do is similar in concept to the answer that you've quoted. The main difference is that your MBP will have the Restore partition on its drive instead of the USB solution for the MBA. \nFollow the instructions on Apple's recovery partition page:\n\nJust hold down Command-R during startup and OS X Recovery springs into\n  action. It lets you choose from common utilities: You can run Disk\n  Utility to check or repair your hard drive, erase your hard drive and\n  reinstall a fresh copy of OS X, or restore your Mac from a Time\n  Machine backup.\n\nSince you've already backed up your data, pick the erase and reinstall option, and you'll have a clean copy of OS X installed on the MBP before you bring the machine back for servicing/replacement.\n", "Q: iPhone: why is the Add Call button disabled for 15 seconds? When I make a phone call, the add call button is disabled for 15 seconds... I.e. it's grayed out. Then it becomes active and works as I expect. But how I can set up conference calls without this delay every time?\n\nA: You can only make a second call once the first call is connected. That delay is to connect and set up the first call.\n", "Q: Write a comment or description for an image in Aperture I have a ton of new pictures in Aperture (from a vacation.) I am trying to figure out the most productive way for me to crank through them and add a comment or new title. What I have seen calls up a dialog box for each image which will take a long time. Thanks\n\nA: @terrydev's answer is good if you want to set a lot of photos to the same caption/description.\nIf you want a faster way of entering individual captions, you can use the \"Info\" inspector panel (default shortcut is Ctrl+D or via menus: View / Inspector / Info). The drop-down menu at the top lets you choose which set of metadata to display, I think the default \"General\" one includes caption, version name and headline...\nYou can type data in any of those, tab between them as usual, and use Cmd+← or Cmd+→ to switch to the previous/next photo in sequence.\nThis can make it much faster than using the menu + pop-up window for each individual photo. The data will be retained in exported images (if you don't strip metadata on export), and will show up in Facebook/Flickr/etc based on these fields.\n\nA: Under the Metadata menu note the Batch Change option (Shift+Cmd+b). This allows you to add metadata to batches of photos at once. Note also that you can customise the fields available in the dialogue, so don't panic if the caption field (or whatever) isn't there. At the 'Add Metadata Info' drop down you can edit the preset and choose which fields you require\n", "Q: Publish an Aperture smart album to Facebook I can easily create a smart album with the 5-star rated images on a certain date.

This is a refurbished MacBook Pro - new to me.\n\nA: This is standard behaviour for a Mac, even if the user is in the Administrators group. The password is that of your user account, not the root account (which is typically disabled by default). OS X asks for your password in a number of situations, not just when using sudo.\nIf you've forgotten your user account password, you can reset it following Apple's instructions.\n\nA: You should always know the root pw of your machine. If not, you can reset it with the installation disks.\nBut what am I confused about is if you can use your admin user ID and password to override it?\n", "Q: 2008 iMac Running OS X 10.8.2 Won't Boot My 2008 iMac is having trouble booting—it never gets past the initial grey screen with the Apple logo and spinner.  After letting it try to boot (spinner working) for upwards of 10 minutes, I'll get the kernel panic \"You need to restart\" message, then a minute later it will go black, then restart.\nIn addition to this, the screen has \"noise\" pixels all over (not dead, but graphical noise).\nI've tried doing a Safe Boot (holding Shift while booting), but it never made it all the way through the boot.\nI've also tried booting into single user mode, but the pixel noise all over the screen limits my ability to read the output.\nOut of desperation (since nothing else was working), I did a RAM swap, but that didn't help either.\nIs there another way to approach this problem?\n\nA: The graphical \"noise\" makes me think that either the graphics drivers have been corrupted (and by the sounds of it, likely more OS components), or there's a hardware defect.\n\n\n*\n\n*Does the \"noise\" appear when the Apple logo is on screen, or just afterwards? If during the Apple logo, it's more likely a hardware problem, since that boot screen isn't based on the OS install. If afterwards, it may just be a problem with your install.\n\n*You can try booting off the Recovery Partition by holding down command-R when you boot.\n\n*\n\n*If this goes well, then it's likely a problem with your boot partition being corrupted. The recovery partition includes Disk Utility, which will let you run a basic check of your boot partition, which may or may not be able to fix things.\n\n*If this fails, then you either have a hard drive issue, or some other hardware problem, in which case you're almost certainly going to need to consult an Apple Store or Service Provider.\n\n\n*You can also attempt to boot off an external drive as segiddins suggested in the comments.\n\n\nSorry I can't be definitive, but it's hard to say for sure without having the machine in front of me.

It takes about 90 seconds to boot and shut down my MacBook Air. I have got it this year.  I have checked numerous things on the Internet but they don't help at all. What do I do?\n\nA: I agree with JWB's comment, more info on your computer and system would be helpful.\nThe \"standard\" Apple fix (when you call AppleCare) usually involves making a new user which is a useful thing to know how to do. Doing this will help you sort out where the problem is, at the system level or at the user level.\nGo to the Apple menu and choose \"System Preferences.\"\nClick on \"Users and Groups.\nUnlock the screen to make changes (you'll need to type in your user password)\nBefore doing the next step click on your user name (current user) and then click the Login items tab to the right. Are there things loading on login that you don't recognize or you think might be causing the problem? If yes make note of what they are. For example, on my computer I have only two things that load on login: Fantastical and Alfred.\nHit the + (plus) under the list of users to make a new user.\nCreate a new standard user (make the user name and password easy). You can choose login options and set Automatic login to the new user if you want to test complete boot up speed but this isn't really necessary.\nClose System Preferences.\nLog out of your current user.\nLog into the new user.\nShut down the computer.\nWas it faster? How about on restart into the new user. Faster?\nIf starting up from the new user sped things up there's something loading or running at the level of your user account that's causing the problem.\n", "Q: When is a message charged? I opened my contacts, clicked my friend's name and using his email, sent him a message. My friend's email is associated with an apple account. Yet when the message was delivered, it turned green. Does it mean that I was charged for the message? Is it necessary that the sender is charged whenever the message turns green? I don't have an SMS package or any other prepaid options. I have a simple AT&T plan with limited talk time and 300 MB of data.\nMy friend lives in a different country and uses an iPod through his home wifi.\nP.S.: I have asked this question on the official Apple forum (link). I think SE is a better place for such questions.\n\nA: When the text bubble is green instead of blue, you're sending a SMS instead of using iMessage, being, therefore, charged for that. \nMessages are sent as SMS when iMessage is unavailable, unless you disable this under Settings / Messages / Send as SMS.\nSo, as I understand it, you either sent it to an non Apple ID email address, or the text couldn't reach the receiver through iMessage, changing to SMS mode. \n", "Q: Installing wine with homebrew So, I am running a bit of a different install.

It is not particularly difficult if you're careful and precise, and excellent guides can be found on ifixit.com. If you have another iPhone available (that is no longer under waranty, as opening it up voids that), you could consider 'borrowing' one of the interfaces from the other phone. If you have the parts available, I recommend attempting to replace the WiFi antenna.\nAlternatively, you could attempt to insert another battery and hope it lives off the donor long enough to connect via usb without needing the wall charge.\nEither way, as you say it's water damage, it could do wonders to open it up and let it dry or acitvely dry it yourself - bowls of rice have done miracles.

If you sync them to your iPhone/iPad you'll also see the geolocations.\nTo do this on the iPhone/iPad itself, iPhoto for iOS may also let you do this (I don't have it to check). If not, you could try something 3rd-party like PinApp, though this will not modify the files in your Photostream (since Apple don't allow that), but can make a geotagged copy, which you can save (and then perhaps delete the un-tagged original?)\nOnce geo-tagged, it depends exactly where (in what application/device) you want the photo to be visible on the Map. iPhoto/Aperture can sync (via iTunes) with your iOS device to store photo albums on it (which will include geolocation info). And obviously the iOS apps let you save back to your camera roll and/or photo stream.\nYou could probably also email it to yourself or otherwise copy it back to your iPhone photo-stream if that's where you want it...\n", "Q: Can \"mdfind\" search for phrases and not just unordered words? Is there a way to search for an exact phrase using the mdfind utility? For example, I created two text documents titled \"test1\" and \"test2\". The contents of \"test1\" are:\n\nI love Apple\n\nAnd the contents of \"test2\" are:\n\nApple love I\n\nWhen I type this in terminal (I placed both files in ~/Documents):\n\nmdfind \"I love Apple\" -onlyin ~/Documents\n\nI get:\n\n~/Documents/test1.txt\n  ~/Documents/test2.txt\n\nHow would I search for the exact phrase \"I love Apple\" so mdfind only returns results containing those words in that order (in this case only \"test1.txt\")?\n\nA: You need to escape your quotes like so:\nmdfind \\\"I love Apple\\\" -onlyin ~/Documents\n\nThis results in just the one document being found:\n~/Documents/test1.txt\n\nWithout escaping them, I don't think the quotes actually get passed to the mdfind command, they're just interpreted by your shell to say that I love Apple is a single argument. With the backslash-escaping, the argument then includes the quote characters.\n\nA: The double quotes can also be placed inside single quotes:\nmdfind '\"exact phrase\"'\n\nThis would search only in the contents:\nmdfind 'kMDItemTextContent==\"*exact phrase*\"'\n\n", "Q: How to block unwanted sites from opening? How do you block websites on Safari?\n\nA: You can add an entry to your /etc/hosts file.

If I fill out a PDF form using Preview.app on Mac OS X, and email it to a Windows user, it appears to be blank when they open it in Acrobat. The same applies to some (most?) annotations.\nHow can I stop this happening?!\nI keep encountering this, both in my own work and friends/family filling in PDF forms using Preview.app. It can be a bit embarrassing in professional circumstances, getting a response of \"No, please send the filled out form, not the blank one!\".\n\nA: NB this seems to be fixed in the most recent versions of OS X, so workaround perhaps no longer required...\n\nWorkaround\nProbably the simplest / safest option is to 'flatten' the PDF before sending it, by printing it to a new PDF.\nAfter completing your form in Preview, go to the Print menu (cmd+P) and use the PDF drop-down in the bottom-left, selecting to Save as PDF... to generate a new, 'flattened' PDF.\nFlattened simply means that all annotations (including data in the form) become indistinguishable from the actual content of the PDF, as if they were part of it all along. This means you can't edit them anymore (in the new, printed PDF), which can be desirable, but also means they'll show up properly in Adobe.\nThe Problem\nThe actual cause of the problem is detailed here from Adobe, and that blog post also includes a script for Acrobat users to recover the data from a form filled in using Preview.app (it turns out Preview puts the data in the form, but doesn't specify how it should 'appear', so Acrobat shows it as blank/invisible).\nI'll leave it up to the reader to decide whether this is a bug in Adobe's software (for not showing form data without a specified \"appearance\") or a bug in Apple's software (for not including the \"appearance\" information).\nIf you've been affected by this bug, please consider notifying one/both of these companies of the issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple's bug report or feedback sites.\n\n*Adobe's feature request/bug report or bug base sites.\n\n", "Q: Why doesn't Messages recognize my contacts? Ok, so this summer I was in Korea. I used a Korean SIM card in my iPhone 4S while I was there. I ended up losing my iPhone before I came back to the US. \nI recently purchased an iPhone 5 and backed up all my stuff that used to be on my old phone. Everything works fine except when I text (for the first time) new contacts that I have recently added. \nWhen I do this, their number shows up in the Messages App instead of their name even though I have their number and contact info saved in my Contacts. When I click on \"add to contact list\" in the Messages App and I choose the contact, it adds a +82 in front of the number. 82 is the country code for Korea. I don't know why it does this. Can someone please tell me how to fix it? \n\nA: Go to Settings > Phone\nCheck that My Number is has been updated to your new number.\nAt times when changing SIM cards, the number does not update in this area.  This will cause issues like you have experienced.  I recently changed carriers (in the USA from AT&T to T-Mobile) and experienced a similar problem after swapping the SIM card in an unlocked iPhone.\nSee Apple Support for more information regarding swapping SIM cards.\n\nA: Have you tried turning International Assist off? It should be under Settings>Phone. Numbers that were previously in the phone before your trip to Korea are functioning normally, correct?\n\nA: Messages on Mac and iPhone will only display contact names if those contacts are in iCloud or on the local device.  If you're pulling in google contacts without syncing to either of the above, you'll lose the names.\nTo fix - sync the contacts to your local device (phone or mac).\n\nA: I had the same problem of phone numbers & not names to identify messages. I deleted the texts. Then clicked on new text. Found the name I wanted to send text to wrote text & sent. Now that name appears instead of number. \n", "Q: VPN - split tunnel routing I would like to use a VPN to access all sites external to our local intranet, but preserve local routing so that I can still access sites on the local intranet (e.g. in 10.0.0.0/8). I am using the Mac OS X native L2TP VPN client. How do I configure it to set this up?\nI have tried something like route add 10.0.0.0/8 [local router address], which works fine, but I would like to automate this process so I don't have to look up the local router address and run the command each time.\n\nA: The Split Tunneling Set is done by the Server (VPN Concentrator) in your Company. This is the common setup. Most of the Cases you want to surf the web and this works over the vpn tunnel if you are connected. In my Company we have to use the proxy of the intranet during the vpn connection. Anyway it is not possible from the client side automatically. But if you use a proxy in the intranet, you can configure this in the properties of the vpn tunnel.\n", "Q: Keep list of websites in Notification Center I want to keep stackexchange site as a notification so that whenever I want to open the site I just need to scroll down from the top and click on link of the site. Is there any way to do that?\n\nA: No, there is no way I am aware of of simply adding arbitrary links that do not expire once viewed.  You could create reminders or calendar links or any other sort of repeated notification which contain the URLs, but this is a most inelegant solution.\nIf quick access to the SE site is what you need, then you could put a link in your bookmarks menu or bar, or you could even place the sites in your reading list which means it's always in the top section after clicking bookmarks (assuming you don't use reading list for it's intended purposes.\nIf you want to open a URL without opening Safari first, the best option may be to go to the SE homepage, click the share icon and click add to Home Screen, and then either drop this into your bottom four home screen dock slots, or if you have more than one URL that you wish to use, then shove them all in a folder and put the folder in your dock.\n\nA: I would look at Launch Center Pro, an inexpensive shortcut app for the iPhone. \nWith it, you can set up a custom action for Safari (and many other apps) which will automatically open a link. \nTo create what you'd want, create a new action by first tapping the pencil icon in the upper right, then one of the plus buttons, then New Action and then either Bookmark or Safari > Bookmark.\nTo make it easily accessible, I have LCP on the dock of my iPhone.\n", "Q: Is there a free program for easily managing network locations? I move around from the office and elsewhere quite a lot. When I'm in the office, I need a static IP, elsewhere I don't. I have network locations set up, but it's extremely tedious opening up Network Preferences to change it essentially every day.\nIdeally I'd like an app where I can just select from the taskbar menu, like I can with Wireless networks, or a way to apply the IP config whenever I connect to that specific network.\nI've found paying apps, like Sidekick, which are massive overkill (I don't want to shell out £20 for an app I'll only use one function of), I just want a tiny utility. Is there such a thing?\n\nA: Check out something called ControlPlane. I've been using it for a while now and it can automatically change a whole array of settings from networks to printers on your mac depending on where you are like sidekick, but its free and so much better.\nLifehacker and Mac AppStorm featured it not long ago.\n\nA: I found an applescript solution that does what I need. I've tweaked it a bit from the original, but it provides a one-button solution for switching my network location.\nHere's the code I used:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n        tell network preferences\n\n                set activeLocation to the name of current location\n\n                set allLocations to the name of every location\n                copy \"Quit\" to the end of allLocations\n\n                set deleteFromList to {activeLocation}\n                set changeLocations to {}\n                repeat with i from 1 to count allLocations\n                        if {allLocations's item i} is not in deleteFromList then\n                                set changeLocations's end to allLocations's item i\n                        end if\n                end repeat\n\n                if (text of choiceLocation) = \"Quit\" then\n                else\n                        do shell script \"scselect '\" & (text of choiceLocation) & \"'\"\n                end if\n        end tell\nend tell\n\nExporting this from AppleScript as an Application, and pinning it to my app bar gives me a one-button Network Location Switcher.\n\nA: You can do that with Network locations. You can defined for example two profiles: work (fixed IP) and home (DHCP).\nAs you said chancing the location from System Preferences is tedious. However you can do the same from the  menu:  > Location.\n\n", "Q: How to install an Operating System after replacing optical Drive by a second HDD on MacBook white late 2009? I want to improve the performance of my MacBook white by donating it a Solid State Drive.\nBecause the prices are too high and I don't want to get stuck in space shortage, I thought of replacing the optical drive by my old 320 GB HDD and place a new 128 GB SSD in the original place of the HDD.\nThis way the SSD can use the SATA III connection while for the HDD the SATA II connection of the optical drive will be sufficient - I assume.\nBut since my Macbook has no recovery partition I was wondering:\nHow would I install any OS on the MacBook without the optical Drive? I have Snow Leopard on DVD. Since I like clean installations I have burned my App Store purchases of Lion and Mountain Lion on DVD to.\nAre there Any solutions for this problem available?\nI know there is the possibility for accessing the optical drive. I own a PC with Windows installed on it, but I never actually tried this out. Also I doubt, that the MacBook can access the optical drive of my PC while there is no OS installed on it.\nGlad for any feedback and hints, thanks!\n\nA: I assume you want to get the OS and apps on your SSD and the rest of your files on the HDD.\n\n\n*\n\n*Attach the optical drive to it's SATA II connection and the SSD to the SATA III connection.\n\n*Install the OS and apps on the SSD. \n\n*Replace the optical drive with the HDD.\n\n\nA: You would need to burn a Mountain Lion USB stick (I always do this too even though I have a DVD drive). Instructions here. I use Lion DiskMaker.\n", "Q: Can I have an Encrypted Partition in a 2 Partitions USB Stick? I have a new 16Gb USB key and want to take advantage of Disk Utilities feature to encrypt it, however I do need to move data from Mac to Windows from time to time. \nIs is it possible to have one FAT partition and one Mac OS Extended Encrypted Partition on a 16Gb drive?\nI've tried a number of times but cannot figure it out.\nThanks.\n\nA: Yes. It's pretty straight forward, to do so just:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Applications / Utilities / Disk Utilities. \n\n*Select the USB device and click Partitions.\n\n*Choose the number of partitions you want and resize them as needed.\n\n*Choose the format of each partition and click *Apply.\n\n*Once mounted on the Finder, Control+Click the Mac OS Extended partition and choose Encrypt.\n\n*You'll be prompted  to choose a password. Enter it and click Encrypt Disk.\n\n*Wait. Unfortunately, there is no progress bar, so you won't know exactly how long will it take. I just did it with a 4 GB USB drive and it took from 5 to 10 minutes.\n\n\nAnd it is done. \n\nA: Ok I found this thread hidden away in the Apple communities and it provided the solution. I was trying to do it through the Finder, I went back and tried it again using Disk Utility and it worked.

But for some reason it wont boot from the USB. I though this was the way to do it? When I created the image I chose \"compressed\" format.

I downloaded the .ipsw file. On clicking ⌥ alt/option + Restore in iTunes (10.7) and selecting the .ipsw file, I get the following error:\n\nThis device isn't eligible for the requested build\n\nI have tried editing the hosts file by adding a # in front of 74.208.10.249 gs.apple.com but the error still persists. Any suggestions regarding this?\n\nA: Whenever an iOS device is restored, it checks with Apple's servers to see if the version requested is still being \"signed\". If it is, the restore goes as planned. Right now, the only iOS version being signed by Apple is 6.1.3.\nThere is currently no way to restore to iOS 5.1.1 without being jailbroken in the past. \n\nA: What I have is an old 3g touch which has a maximum ios version of 5.1.1 and will never get any higher - they are pretty cheap on ebay - I can then use this for testing. If the device you buy has an older version of iOS it will be upgraded to a kosher 5.1.1 by iTunes.\n", "Q: Is it possible to make Keynote more accurate with autoplaying? I am currently preparing for an Ignite style talk (5 minutes, 20 slides, 15 seconds auto-advancing).\nSo, due to the talk format, I have set my slides in Keynote to autoplay (Inspector -> Document -> Self-playing, 15 seconds).\nHowever, I've realised that after a couple of slides, the timing starts to be off - such that the entire presentation will be ~5:05 (instead of 5 minutes)\nWas wondering, if anyone knows if it is possible to tweak Keynote such that the autoplay delays are more accurate?\nSome details:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using Keynote'09 v5.1.1\n\n*Tried using automatic slide transitions with 15 sec delays, same problem\n\n*Borrowed laptops from friends and it seems like Powerpoint and Mac Powerpoint seem to be spot on 15sec/slide (total 5min)\n\n\nThanks!\n\nA: My understanding is that this is due to the fact that the slide transition takes a certain amount of time - the 15 seconds is the total time the slide is undistrubed on the screen and it allows a certain amount of time for the changover - the way to check this is to set the timing to '0' and see what happens :) \n", "Q: Deploy Software On Macs Connected to Active Directory? We have about 50 Macs connected to our Windows Active Directory server and they work ok, they are bound up just fine using the built in functionality.\nHowever, the time has come, we need to install a piece of software across all of them and going around each individually would take forever. What software/route should I take to achieve this?\nAlso, if there is an easy way to run scripts or automate that would help as well.\nThanks.\n\nA: Munki is great, I use it as well as Puppet. But for only 50 Macs? I can't see setting up that for a smaller setup unless you are really planning for scale.\nApple Remote Desktop might be a little more adhoc. It's only about $80 on the AppStore. Once your Macs are setup to allow ARD to administrate them, installing software across 50 Macs is as simple as selecting them all, clicking \"Install Package\", and dragging in a .pkg or .mpkg file.\nIt also does remote control, send UNIX script, copy files, etc. A useful tool (albeit somewhat buggy at times) for small Mac shops.\nIf you want a free alternative to JAMF's Composer (which used to be free), you can try Absolute's InstallEase: http://www.absolute.com/products/InstallEase\n\nA: Look into Munki and Puppet. We have 100+ mac laptops and use Munki for software distribution (applications) and puppet for low level scripts and managing prepferences.\n\nA: I would use a combo of Jamf's Composer app ($99/Com,$79/Edu) and Apple's ARD3 to create ARD-pushable .pgk files.\nComposer is able to 'watch' as you install and configure a software package and keep track of all the new files added, old files modified and any preferences made during the installation, then will create a .pgk file of all these changes which you can then push out to the Macs with ARD3.\nARD3 is able to push out prebuilt .pkg and .mpkg files from software companies, too.\nIf you want to forgo ARD3, you can distribute the .pkg files over a network/on a USB thumbdrive/on a CD/DVD and have local user admins install them manually.\nThe Casper Suite mentioned by tron_jones can be quite expensive, and is designed to support Macs from soup to nuts. It is a bit of overkill for your purposes now, but perhaps can be of use in the future as your Mac's presence grows.\n", "Q: My OS closes down after 5 seconds of inactivity (with the alert pop-up) Since yesterday, when i'm running my computer, it shutDowns after 5 seconds of running. In order to make it work, i need to press continuously the escape key so the popUp alert  who close the computer can dismiss. \nWhen the os is launched, if i let the computer sit without any input, the alert panel appears, and if i don't do anything, my computer shuts down after the alert panel has been shown for 2 seconds. So this is very annoying.\n\nStrangest thing is, that it appeared the same way last year (between october and november), and it disappeared same way it appeared. I have tried to change calendar date and time, but it was unsuccessful.\nMy question is: What could cause this alert firing ? Can i get a way to catch the *$**%* process who send this? Of course i can re-install the OS, but that's out of the question.\nI have googled it and it seems that nobody has encountered this. I'm on Lion 10.7.4 and running it on a macBookPro, but last year on snow leopard the same thing occurred. I don't think it's a virus since it should appear on lots of computers, but it seems to appear only on mine.\n\nA: That window appears if you hit the power button, maybe your power button is faulty and thinks you are hitting it. This also would explain why this problem \"auto-solved\" itself without you doing anything (i.e. there was some dirt \"triggering\" the click, and it went away).\n\nA: I have this at my MacBook Pro 1286 and if I power it up and unplug the Keyboard cable everything works just fine. I will order another keyboard and see if this is really the problem. I will let you know ;)\n", "Q: How many copies of Mountain Lion does one App Store download get me? I understand that this is a pretty basic question but I cannot find a direct answer anywhere. I have two computers running Snow Leopard: a Macbook Air (2011, pre-thunderbolt) and MacBook Pro 2009, which can both run Mountain Lion. According to my programmer / Apple friend, I can download Mountain Lion once from the App Store and use it to upgrade both machines. Is this true? I'm using one 'account' I guess but it's still two different machines, but my (trustworthy) friend was insistent I could. I can't find confirmation in any of the reading I've done here or on the Apple website.\n\nA: You can install Mountain Lion on several Macs, provided that you use the same Apple ID for downloading it on them.\nThe Mountain Lion License Agreement explicitly says:\n\nMac App Store License. If you obtained a license for the Apple Software from the Mac App Store, then subject to the terms and conditions of this License and as permitted by the Mac App Store Usage Rules set forth in the App Store Terms and Conditions (http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/ww/) (“Usage Rules”), you are granted a limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive license:\n  (i) to download, install, use, and run for personal, non-commercial use, one (1) copy of the Apple Software directly on each Apple-branded computer running OS X Lion or OS X Snow Leopard (“Mac computer”) that you own or control.\n\nYou can read the license by clicking the Terms and Conditions link at the bottom of the App Store window (left of the FAQ currently) and searching the license for the words \"product usage\" (presuming your store's terms are in english).\n\nA: There are two different questions embedded in your question.\nOne is about license: If you purchase Mountain Lion, how many machines are you licensed to install it on.\nThe second is about the actual file you download: how many times can you use it without having to download again.\nPerhaps surprisingly, the answer to the first is simpler than the answer to the second. You are allowed, as the license says, to install Mountain Lion \"directly on each Apple-branded computer running OS X Lion or OS X Snow Leopard (“Mac computer”) that you own or control.\"\nCan you do this without re-downloading the (rather large) file?\nYes, but…\nYou need to download the Mountain Lion installer, then make a copy of the installer onto some external media before installing the operating system. The installation procedure will, by default, delete the install file once it is done, meaning that you can download it from the store again without buying another copy, but unless you copy the file before installing, you can only use the downloaded installer once (a rather frustrating experience, given how long it takes to download).\n\nA: Yes you can. The way I did it was simpler than some suggestions imply. I purchased it and directly downloaded it to one computer. Then when it came time to download and install on a second, I just went into the Mac app store the same way , clicked download. It says it is $19.99, but once you click to purchase and enter your apple ID, as long as you have already bought it on another computer under that Apple ID, it then gives you a message saying such, and that the download is free. \n", "Q: How can I tell when HD Voice is being used in a phone call? The iPhone 5 supports a wideband audio protocol for phone calls dubbed HD Voice that is supposed to improve the clarity of phone calls when it's used. Not all providers support it, but I've verified that my provider, Telus, does.\nHow can I tell when HD Voice is in use during a call? Is there a visual indicator in the phone app?\n\nA: As far as i know, iPhone5 dont have HD voice indicator, i realised this when calling my dad with his Z10, he said there is HD Voice title on his Z10 answer button but there is no particular hd voice symbol or what so ever on my i5. Well, the voice quality with hd voice is just so clear and different, you should know whether hd voice is on or not just by voice quality.\n", "Q: How can I make autocomplete in the shell work with case-folding? How can I make the autocompletion for files and folders in the bash shell work case-insensitively?\nIdeally, cd ~/doc + tab autocompletes to cd ~/Documents (correcting the case as it autocompletes), but if that's not possible autocompleting to cd ~/documents is acceptable too.\n\nA: You can do that by typing the following command in the terminal:\necho 'set completion-ignore-case On' >> ~/.inputrc\n\nif you want to go back to the original behavior you have the open that file and remove the line.\nThe file ~/.inputrc file deals with mapping the keyboard for specific situations. This file is the start-up file used by Readline, the input-related library used by Bash, perl and most other open source programs. \n\nThe configuration options in .inputrc are particularly useful for\n  customising the way Tab-completion works, e.g. with the ls command\nWhen a program which uses the Readline library starts up, the init\n  file is read, and the key bindings are set.\n\nYou can find more information about the file syntax in \"Bash startup files\".\n", "Q: Can iBooks be synced from an iPad to a new computer to save my documents? I formated my Mac after a few years of work and forgot to do books backup because iPad was lightly used. As a result all my books stuck on the iPad and if I want to add some new from a computer it wants to erase the existing books.\nWith iFile, I tried to copy books, but there are only folders, not epub files. \nSo is there any way to get them back or somehow combine with new iTunes library? In general I don't need those books readable on mac, just to restore and the ability to add new ones to the iPad.\n\nA: I would evaluate a program like PhoneView to retrieve the contents you like before setting up an iTunes or iCloud backup solution so you don't end up in this spot going forward. There are probably a hundred apps to load files from iOS to a computer, so you can search for one that matches your needs pretty easily. DiskAid also seems to be mentioned regularly even though my favorite is PhoneView.\nHere are some relevant details to flesh out how this will work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Software (not app) To Read Underlying iPhone Data\n\n*How to transfer a file from iPhone to computer when there is no Internet?\n\n*How can I back up my app data?\n\n*On iPad's iBooks, is there a way to sync and download all ebooks purchased else where?\nI have also heard many people express happiness at iExplorer for doing the same sort of recovery / transfer of files from an iOS device. Perhaps it will do a better job with your device since you remarked that several of the suggested apps didn't work for you in the comments.\n\nA: *\n\n*Download DiskAid (free trial). You can transfer all your music, books and apps over to iTunes from your iPhone. \n\n*Connect your iPhone to the PC. Open DiskAid. \n\n*Copy over your books and any other data you wish to backup.\n\n*Add the recovered epub files to iTunes, just like you did previously.\n\n*Do that for all other media type you wish to restore.\n\n*Sync your iPad. The content will be restored.\n\n\nA: If you're running Windows, you can try Library Tunes to change the ID of your new iTunes library to that of your old library.  It recovers this ID, so you don't need access to your old computer.  Library Tunes guides you through the process and automates quite a bit.  You can also use it to \"enable\" a whole bunch of computers you can manually manage your Apple device with.\n\nA: Those folders are ePubs converted by iBooks. \nCopy using your favorite app to a folder on your hard drive or use iExplorer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get to Media - Books\n\n*Export all to a folder on your drive\n\n*Open iTunes, connect to your device\n\n*Once they are all exported try to drag any entire folder named xxx-xxxx--xxxx.epub to the iTunes book section\n\n*If it works do this for all\n\n*Re-sync, it should add to both the iPad and your new library\n\n\nThe issue is that they are linked to another library or messed up with an Apple id.\n", "Q: Read/Edit Textedit icloud files on an iPad Does any one of you know a solution to either read or edit on an iPad files stored with Textedit on iCloud ? \n\nA: As @patrix said there is no way.\nHowever you can use iA Writer. It's an application available for Mac, iPad and iPhone, which allows you to read and write txt files, which are the same produced by Textedit. It as a native iCloud and Dropbox support.\nUnfortunately it is not free.\nAlternatively Brett Terpstra has an amazingly comprehensive review of iOS editors where you can find a replacement or be alerted when a program does in fact cooperate with TextEdit for document storage in iCloud.\n\nA: using iCloud Drive w/ iOS 9 it is possible.\n\"On your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch with iOS 9, you can access your files from the iCloud Drive app. To show or hide the app, go to Settings > iCloud > iCloud Drive.

I updated from 10.8.1 to 10.8.2 last week and since then I have yet to get certain vhosts working on my local sandbox.

Possibly you previously changed the global restrictions in /etc/apache2/httpd.conf to be more relaxed, and it got overridden during the update. The default is Allow none.

When I last configured it from scratch for the last time (the release of Mountain Lion), I was using the Apple keyboard. So, the default input method is the Belgian one.\nBut since, I bought another keyboard (Corsair K60). And as the keyboard layout is a bit different from classic Apple layout, I made my own with Ukelele.\nIt's been working really well since, I think, the last extra update pour 10.8.2. Since then, every time I switch to an app where you mainly type text (Notes, Sparrow, Twitter client, ... But not with Messages weirdly), OS X switch the input method to Belgian. And I can't switch back to my custom one.\nI've already checked I've selected the option : \"Use the same input method for all documents\" is activated. So, I'm a bit stuck here. Any help ?\n\nA: If the custom keyboard layout is in ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/, have you tried moving it to /Library/Keyboard Layouts/? That would normally prevent it from being switched to a default layout in password dialogs.\nIf you don't need the Belgian layout, there's also a hacky way to disable the default layouts.\n", "Q: Time Machine - List of Files that were backed up I'd like to know to see which files are getting backed up by my time machine? I often see a large amount of data being transfered and I'm not sure sure what it is.\n\nA: If you want to watch which files are being transfered in realtime you can monitor the time machine daemon with\nsudo fs_usage -f -R filesys backupd\n\nIf you see abnoramly large file transfer you might see disk images from virtual machines in the list\n\nA: I combined the above tmutil answer by BMIKE into this handy one-liner, hopefully it can help someone!\nThis will take the last 2 backups, and diff them for you. The sed is to put quotes around the backup names which will probably have spaces in them.\nsudo tmutil listbackups | tail -2 | sed 's/.*/\"&\"/' | xargs  sudo tmutil compare\n\n\nA: The command tmutil compare lets you compare file lists if you don't want to do it using ls or other commands that can show differences in files and folders like rsync and many graphical diff programs.\nYou can list backup paths and then copy them into the compare command. Example:\nsudo tmutil listbackups\nsudo tmutil compare \"path1\" \"path2\"\n\nMany people adore BackupLoupe as well. It makes a powerful database of what files are included with each backup interval.\n\nA: If you're interested in seeing what files are being read as the backup happens, you can use this command:\nsudo opensnoop -n backupd | grep -v 'Time Machine Backups'\n\nNote:  the above worked in earlier versions of macOS.  In High Sierra, something approximating this is:\nsudo fs_usage -f filesys backupd\n\nHowever there's a lot of noise from the backup volume itself that I haven't figured out how to get rid of.\n\nA: I really like this commercial software BackupLoupe for analysing my backups.\n\n\nA: You can use timedog for that. \n\ntimedog is a Perl script that displays the set of files that were saved for any given backup created by Mac OS X Time Machine. By default it shows those files that were saved in the most recent backup. The listing includes the file sizes before and after, as well as a total file count and size. The script includes an option to summarize changes to a particular directory depth, producing a more concise display, helping to get an understanding of which areas of your system are taking up the most space in the backups. It can also sort by size, and/or omit files below a given size.\n\n\nA: For me, on MacOS Ventura, the following code line works as a charme to show only files written to the backup disk:\nsudo fs_usage -f -R filesys backupd | grep RdData\n\n", "Q: Image dimension column in Finder? Is it possible to add a column in the list View in Finder, that displays the dimensions of image files ? \n\nA: Just add the word Pictures (capital P) to the front of your folder name, and you will miraculously get Dimensions and Resolution as a column option.  Then just rename it back.\nNote: You may need to right-click on the list view's header bar to see this option, rather than View > Show View Options (⌘ J).\n\nA: It would appear that the answer is no, not directly.\nOptions for columns include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Date modified\n\n*Date created\n\n*Date Last Opened\n\n*Date Added\n\n*Size (file size, not image size)\n\n*Version\n\n*Kind\n\n*Comments\n\n*Label\n\n\nand image size is not one of the choices.\n\nYou could, however, use a Folder Action to assign image size to the Comments field of a file in a folder and display the Comments column.\nNote that in icon view, you can press ⌘J and check \"show item info\" to display image sizes.\n", "Q: Adding Unicode decorators to text in Pages Is it possible to add a copied (via Cmd+C), for example, vector arrow to  a letter in Pages?

Specifically, 1.6.0_07 and 1.5.0_xx that will run on OSX Mountain Lion?\n\nA: You simply cannot get arbitrary Java versions for the Mac.  Apple provides their own Java binaries and does not provide every single Java release.  Also, those old versions have known security problems with active exploits in the wild, so it's dangerous to use them on a desktop system.  \nMy best recommendation would be to create a Linux VM using VMware Fusion and install the old versions either from the Linux package installer or using packages downloaded from Oracle. \n", "Q: Fix accepted invitation with \"floating\" timezone? I'm using OS X 10.8.2, iOS 6.0, and an iCloud calendar shared between the two. I have timezone support enabled. When I accept an emailed ics calendar invitation, it shows up in iCloud calendar with \"timezone: floating\". The invitation originated from EST and I am on PDT, so it shows up on my iOS and OSX calendars three hours late.\nNone of the calendar apps will let me change the timezone of the event. Looking at the ics raw data, I see that it was created by MS Exchange Server and I see that it specifies a timezone:\nBEGIN:VCALENDAR\nMETHOD:REQUEST\nPRODID:Microsoft Exchange Server 2007\nVERSION:2.0\nBEGIN:VTIMEZONE\nTZID:(UTC-05:00) Eastern Time (US & Canada)\nBEGIN:STANDARD\nDTSTART:16010101T020000\nTZOFFSETFROM:-0400\nTZOFFSETTO:-0500\nRRULE:FREQ=YEARLY;INTERVAL=1;BYDAY=1SU;BYMONTH=11\nEND:STANDARD\nBEGIN:DAYLIGHT\nDTSTART:16010101T020000\nTZOFFSETFROM:-0500\nTZOFFSETTO:-0400\nRRULE:FREQ=YEARLY;INTERVAL=1;BYDAY=2SU;BYMONTH=3\nEND:DAYLIGHT\nEND:VTIMEZONE\nBEGIN:VEVENT\n\nPossibly something could be done by the originator or by the Exchange admin, but it's a serious imposition to ask folks to go hunting for configuration problems because of what will look to them like a problem on my end.\nHow can I fix this? Is there a way to force iOS, OS X, or the iCloud web site to correct the timezone?\n\nA: The answer is yes. I've written an AppleScript that will convert the incorrect Exchange produced TZID to a properly formatted one. This means the fix is only on Mac OS. \nI've a post on this, https://thefragens.com/ical-exchange-time-zone-fix-chapter-3/\nLet's start at the beginning. Sometimes integration of a Mac in the corporate environment is a bit difficult and takes a bit of ingenuity. This is especially true when dealing with Exchange. The current versions of iCal and iCal Server are CalDAV and iCalendar compliant. Only Outlook 2007 is said to be CalDAV and iCalendar compliant. Previous versions of Outlook are not compliant and don’t play well with other calendar applications. Here’s the actual time zone (TZID) spec and the spec for how it should be formatted. You can see by looking at it that the TZID that Outlook produces is non-compliant.\nA quick Google search shows an article or two that explain this very well.\nI've found that there are at least 3 different types of invites that can be sent by Exchange/Outlook.\n\n\n*\n\n*METHOD:REQUEST - This is the usual email requesting that you attend a meeting.\n\n*METHOD:PUBLISH - This is essentially a publication notice for an event. It doesn't ask you to reply.\n\n*METHOD:CANCEL - This is a cancellation notice for an event.\n\n\nAdditionally, I've found that the emails that contain these invites are formated in at least 3 different ways. Sometimes the calendar event is within the body of the message and is encoded with Content-Transfer-Encoding in either 8bit or quoted-printable. Always the .ics file is attached.\nMy script does the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*It parses the message to either extract the calendar data from the body of the message or from the .ics attachment.\n\n*It then figures out if the invite is of type METHOD:REQUEST, METHOD:PUBLISH or METHOD:CANCEL.\n\n*If the invite is one of the first 2 types. The time zone is fixed and the event is imported into iCal. You might have to select into which calendar the event will be imported.\n\n*If the invite is of type METHOD:CANCEL then the script will locate the corresponding event and set it's status to cancelled.\n\n\n*\n\n*You will have to manually delete the event. It will appear in iCal to have a white strike-through font style.\n\n*Repeating events all seem to have the same UID (Unique IDentifier).\n\n\n\nI don't know why. Every repeating event will be thusly marked as cancelled. You will then manually delete the specific event and manually run the script again while the cancellation message is selected. This will reset the remaining repeating events back to confirmed. Yes, I know this is a bit of a kludge but I don't have a better method.\n\n\n*It will parse the message to allow for invites from multiple Exchange servers.\n\n\nMy script, now re-named iCal-Invite-Fix.scpt, will need to be customized for each Exchange server from which you receive invites. There are 3 properties at the beginning of the script. They are exchange_fragment, ical_tzid and myCalendar. These first two properties are lists and the order of the items is crucial. The specific item (position in list) of each list must correspond to each other.\n\n\n*\n\n*exchange_fragment is a unique fragment of the TZID that your Exchange server sends.\n\n*ical_tzid is the time zone of the Exchange server in proper format.\n\n*This means no spaces, though spaces are replaced automatically with the underscore '_'.\n\n*For instance, I'm in Southern California and the correct time zone should be written as US/Pacific or America/Los_Angeles. You can find this information by selecting the time zone drop down menu in the upper right corner of your iCal window and select Other.... If you look in iCal's upper right corner for the time zone menu bar the last example will appear as America/Los Angeles.\n\n*myCalendar is the name of the calendar that normally receives the events. It is needed for the cancellation to function.\n\n\n\nAs the image above shows there are now only 2 properties, both of which are lists. These lists work together as an array; which means the order of the list items is crucial.\n\n\n*\n\n*exchange_fragment contains unique fragments of the TZID that the Exchange server sends.\n\n*ical_tzid contains the tzid info that iCal expects to see.\n\n\nSave the script and either set it up to run from a mail rule or as I do call it from the System AppleScript menu. You will need to save the script in ~/Library/Scripts/Applications/Mail/ folder. Create this folder if it doesn’t exist.\nTo set the script up to run automatically you will need to create a new Mail rule as follows.\n\n\n*\n\n*Mail -> Preferences -> Rules -> Add Rule\n\n*Description \"iCal Invite Fix\"\n\n*If \"any\" of the following conditions are met:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Any Attachment Name\" \"ends with\" \".ics\"\n\n\n*Perform the following actions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run AppleScript \"~/Library/Scripts/Applications/Mail/iCal-Invite-Fix.scpt\"\n\n\n*Click \"OK\" and then \"Apply\"\n\n\n\nYou can also run the script manually from the system-wide script menu. To install this menu. Open up the /Applications/AppleScript/AppleScript Utility.app and check the Show Script menu in menu bar box. If you put the script in the folder location indicated above it will now be visible when Mail.app is the current application.\nDownload the iCal-Invite-Fix script.\nPlease let me know if there are any problems or you need help setting this up. The script was not entirely my creation and credit also goes to others. I’m quite certain any errors are likely mine. ;-)\nUpdated 12/28/2008: Added ability to use single script with multiple Exchange servers. The trade-off is a slightly more complex set up.\n\nA: I have used Outlook for telecons in many time zones on my PC Windows environment for many years. I never had a problem with a meeting invite being incorrectly scheduled due to the event being scheduled in a different time zone than I am in. Outlook always looks at the meeting invite, sees that it was scheduled in a different time zone, then schedules the event so it occurs at the proper time.\nNow I get an iPhone and set up iCloud to work with my Outlook calendar. All of a sudden, the iCloud calendar looks real stupid. It doesn't bother to notice that the events are being scheduled in a different time zone and schedules them at whatever time it was in the time zone from which they were sent. So I am either one hour late or early for my telecons depending on whether they were sent from some one either east or west of me respectively. This is pretty dumb. I expected more from Apple.\nI have fiddled with the time zone support in both iClound and on my I phone. It didn't help. I have read all the stuff about how time zones are so complex and hard as if the problem is insurmountable. This is allot of junk. Outlook has been doing this for years no problem.\nI love my iPhone, but am very disappointed that Apple can't get their act together on this.\n", "Q: URL-scheme details for Reminders application The Reminders application understands the reminders: URL scheme, so that you can invoke it, for instance, from Terminal as open reminders: (use of // is optional).\nWhat I'm looking for is documentation of further elements of this scheme. Specifically, I want to construct URLs that allow me to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*open a specific list\n\n*open a specific reminder\n\n\nI've tried things like reminders:74771907-EA34-4848-A935-0C839AE123CC using both list and reminder-item identifiers, but to no avail.\n\nUpdate:\njeeyul's answer points out that Reminders-related URL schemes are undocumented, which would likely cause rejection of apps that use them when submitted to the OSX/iOS App Store.\nFor private use, however, this is not an issue.\nSee:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/featuredarticles/iPhoneURLScheme_Reference/Introduction/Introduction.html for a list of official URL schemes on both iOS and OSX\n\n*https://superuser.com/questions/498943/directory-of-url-schemes-for-mac-apps provides good information for examining the schemes defined on a given machine.\n\n\nA: I don't know the details of URL scheme.\nHowever the scheme is x-apple-reminder not reminders\nIt can launch reminder app at least. \nHowever the host and path rule is not revealed yet.\nReminder widget can open Reminder with specific EKReminder, \nSo, there must be a scheme definition for it.\nThe scheme x-apple-reminder is undocumented, So using it should be rejected.\n\nA: jeeyul's answer mentions x-apple-reminder as an alternative URL scheme.\nWhile both reminders:// and x-apple-reminder:// work on OSX to merely launch the Reminders app, it turns out that the following works only with x-apple-reminder://, which shows how to open (jump to) a specific reminder:\nx-apple-reminder://{reminderId}\n\nExample: from Terminal, open the reminder whose ID is 0BFDC528-306D-47A7-8E8F-895ACCDC6FFA:\nopen x-apple-reminder://0BFDC528-306D-47A7-8E8F-895ACCDC6FFA\n\nHowever, doing the same for a reminder list does NOT work, so this part of my question is still unanswered - I'm still marking it as accepted for at least providing a partial solution.\n\nA: I found one tricks for proximity type reminders. \nI was looking for the way to find which proximity reminder triggered a shortcuts.    \nIf a reminder is a due date type, it’s pretty easy.  Shortcuts filter offers complete or due date sort fiction and selecting the latest completion reminder is the one who triggered a shortcuts.     \nBut if a proximity type reminder triggered a shortcuts, ios doesn’t offer such as “latest proximity  reminders”. \nI spent several hours to find an alternative and figured out this way works. \nFind Reminders where\n  List is YOUR_LIST\n  Sort by last modified date\n  Order latest\n  Limit on\n  Get 1 reminder\nThis method works for me. \nThis is very useful if you have hundreds of proximity reminders and if you don’t want to make hundreds of shortcuts associated with each reminder.   This methods can also pass text data from note section of reminders to a shortcuts. \nThanks\n", "Q: Does OS X Calendar (née iCal) support RDATE? I have an application that produces an iCalendar feed (RFC 5545). The calendar feed works on Google Calendar and on Android but I have been getting reports that it isn't working on OS X Calendar (aka iCal). The calendar feed currently uses the RDATE element extensively and validates.\nDoes iCal support the RDATE element?\nUPDATE \nI have managed to get recurrence working on Apple devices by using RRULE with EXDATEs.  The problem is this does not work properly on Android devices. (Argghhh!)\n\nA: I have not run exhaustive tests but empirically I have concluded that Apple products do not implement the RDATE recurrence rule.  \nApple products do appear to implement the RRULE but only a limited subset of this.  The extent to which the RRULE is supported might be deduced from the options available for setting recurring events in Apple apps.  It should be possible to support simple patterns (every day, every week, every 2 weeks, every month, every year) but probably not more complex patterns using BYMONTHDAY, BYYEARDAY, BYWEEKNO, BYMONTH, BYSETPOS.\nI've noticed that Google Calendar might display a full recurrence set whereas an Apple device that is synced from that calendar will only show the first event.\nI would welcome a more authoritative answer.\n", "Q: How do I change the name on my @me.com email.com? I'm divorced now and I've updated my name in iCloud but when I send an email from @me.com email my hyphenated name still comes up. How do I change that?\n\nA: Assuming that you're trying to change your full name (and not the email address itself), you can follow the directions in this Cnet article:\n\nFirst log into iCloud.com, then click the Mail icon to open the\n  Webmail application. In the Webmail application, click the gear at the\n  top right and choose \"Preferences\" from the menu that appears, and you\n  should see a window that appears with settings specific to your e-mail\n  account. Click the Accounts section and you should see editable fields\n  for Description and Full Name. Fill in your desired full name to\n  display, and save the settings.\n\nNote: Image courtesy of Cnet\n\nYour updated full name should then be used by the @me.com email address. The article also discusses how to change the displayed full name in the OS X mail client, but this example is a bit more generic.\n", "Q: How can I recover from failed app update? Twice now I have apps fail to install during an update and then been unable to restart the process or use the app. I am using the Update All function in the \"Apps\" App. \nLast time it effected only one app. Despite full reboots and going back into the Update screen the failed app was stuck at the \"Installing\" step. I could not resume the update or use the app. I finally deleted the app and reinstalled and things seem to go fine. \nThis time it failed installing the Twitter app and the two apps after it in the list now are also stuck. Again I've tried full shutdown and reboot with no luck. I can update other apps but those three seem stuck in limbo. I suppose I can delete them are reinstall as before but is there a better way?\n\nA: This has now happened a couple of more times. I've been able to resolve this the last couple of times by tapping the app back on the main screen (ie not in the app store). The label below it changes to 'Waiting'. Then tapping it again it changes the label to 'Loading' or 'Installing' and the update finally completes. I can then update other apps.\nOtherwise the only other solution is to delete and reinstall the app.\n\nA: Try transferring the apps to your iTunes library (if they are not already there) with the \"Send purchases\" function. Then sync your iTunes library with your iDevice. \nThis could clear the issue.\n", "Q: How can I view/inspect my Mac’s Parameter RAM (NVRAM)? Inspired by this question I started looking for apps that allow to read the data saved in my Mac’s Parameter RAM. Aside from a very antique (pre OS X) application for Classic, I could not find any. Is there any way to access the info stored in the PRAM on current Macs?\n\nA: To clarify, for PowerPC based Macs, this memory was called PRAM, but for Intel based Macs, the proper name is NVRAM.\nTo show the contents of the NVRAM or even manipulate them, you can use the nvram shell commando in Terminal. For info on usage, execute man nvram.\nIf you just want to display the entire contents of the NVRAM, you can execute it with th -p parameter:\nnvram -p\n", "Q: What could fix Calendar.app when one calendar does not show all events that should be synced with iCloud? I use iCloud to sync 4 calendars between my iPhone 4 (running iOS 6.0.1), iPad 2 (running iOS 6.0.1) and MacBook Pro Mid 2012 running Mountain Lion (10.8.2).\nAll events for 3 of the calendars sync correctly across all devices, however for one calendar:\n\n\n*\n\n*All events show at https://www.icloud.com\n\n*All events show in the calendar app on the iPhone and iPad\n\n*Hardly any events appear in Calendar.app on the MacBook Pro, some future events appear until after the date of the event and disappear from this calendar while remaining on the iOS devices and iCloud.com.\n\n\nI noticed it happening in the last few weeks. Previously it worked OK. I usually add events to the calendar from either my iPhone or MacBook.\nSo far I have tried: \n\n\n*\n\n*Removing the calendar from my MacBook Pro (signing out of iCloud, then deleting all calendars from ~/Library/Calendars) \n\n*Restarting OS X \n\n*Re-adding the calendar \n\n\n– but there are still events missing.\nIn Console I see no messages when I force refresh the calendar. \nMy Apple ID is a custom email, not the typical @me.com address (not sure that should make a difference).\nDoes anyone have any other suggestions for what could be causing it or how to fix Calendar syncing?\n\nA: Go to Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars and then Sync and all events that should get all your events to show.\n\nA: I have the same problem. I've tried numerous things to no avail. I've just tried to install BusyCal and sync it to iCloud to see what would happen. To my surprise, it cannot show any events from the offending calendar. iCal shows some. BusyCal shows none. I'm starting to think that there is some corruption in the calendar data.\nHope this helps progress a bit. Let me know if you find the answer.\n\nA: For iCloud, or for any other calendar service that uses CalDAV\nIf all events are present and correct on the server: \n\n\n*\n\n*use OS X to delete the account from Calendar\n\n*add the account.\n\n\nThe help provided by Apple notes: \n\nIf you delete an iCloud calendar account, the iCloud Calendar service\n  will be turned off in iCloud preferences and Mail, Contacts &\n  Calendars preferences. At any time, you can turn the service back on\n  and your iCloud calendars will reappear in Calendar, up to date. Any\n  devices or other computers using the iCloud Calendar service will\n  continue to have your most recent iCloud calendar information.\n\nIf the two steps above do not work for you, then try the equivalent routine on other devices that use the CalDAV service. So: \n\n\n*\n\n*remove the account from all three devices – iPad, iPhone and Mac\n\n*add the account to the Mac.\n\n\nIf that does not work around the problem, then we should wish for the debug menu but a related question How do I enable the Debug menu in Calendar? remains unanswered. \nA server-specific command, in Terminal, can result in logging of traffic. Results may be comprehensive but time-consuming to interpret. \nProbably quicker for troubleshooting: Like Paulo's answer, see whether a different CalDAV client – something other than Calendar.app – represents all of what's in iCloud. (This is towards identifying the problem – not discouraging you from eventual reuse of Calendar.app.)\nYou could try BusyCal, it's reliable (I use it myself, to work with an older and possibly less compliant CalDAV server). If not BusyCal, maybe Mozilla Sunbird Beta or the Lightning add-on for Thunderbird. \nThoughts\nA few months ago I had an issue with an event that included an unusual non-Roman character, but I can't recall whether the issue was visible in the web interface to iCloud, or in Calendar. \nConsole and privacy\nIf you view all messages, it's normal and proper to not see things relating to your personal data. This is for privacy. Bear in mind, that Console view of all messages is designed for all users of a Mac. \nConsole may prove useful – to view a different log after running a debug command – but first, try the steps above.  \n\nA: Events you create on your iPhone appear as invitations on the iPad and vice versa. You can only edit events on the device it was created and you can edit events when you are logged in onto Google Calendar.\n\nA: It's resolved itself.

On my Retina MacBook Pro, the Python IDLE development environment has blurry, non-retina text.\nIs there a way I can make the text retina?\nIDLE: \n\n\nA: At the moment this isn't likely to be fixable, unless you're fairly comfortable with OS X development and want to rewrite parts of the underlying GUI library.\nAccording to this bug report on Python.org, it's an issue with the TkInter GUI library, which IDLE apparently makes use of. TkInter in turn is based on Tk, which is a cross-platform GUI toolkit, which means it almost certainly doesn't use the standard OS X text renderer, which is the only way to get \"free\" Retina text.\nAs an alternative, perhaps look at ways to make the default python shell or IPython running in Terminal more useful to you?\n\nA: I'd say segiddins has it almost right, with a couple of slight adjustments that made that solution work perfectly for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy IDLE.app to the desktop.\n\n*Right-click the copied IDLE.app and select Show Package Contents.\n\n*Open Contents/info.plist.\n\n*Add the following two lines...\n<key>NSHighResolutionCapable</key>\n<true/>\n...to the end of the plist file, but before the last two lines (</dict>\n</plist>).\n\n*Save the plist.\n\n*Replace the original IDLE.app with IDLE.app you just modified.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Do Show Package Contents on the .app bundle.\n\n*Open Contents/info.plist\n\n*Add \n<key>NSHighResolutionCapable</key>\n<string>True</string>\nTo the end of the plist file, but before the last two lines (</dict></plist>)\n\n*Save the plist and launch the app!\n\n", "Q: Dual boot MacBook Air 2012 with Windows 7 - now boots directly into Windows So I attempted to set up dual boot (Boot Camp) on my new MacBook Air (Mountain Lion) with Windows 7 and failed spectacularly in the process. The Mac just boots straight into Windows now. There's no boot menu and I can't seem to find a way to boot to Mac OS X.  Hoping someone here can help.\nHere's how I got into this mess:\n\n\n*\n\n*Created a bootable Windows 7 USB key with an x64 Windows 7 ISO using Windows USB/DVD download tool.\n\n*Ran Boot Camp on the Mac, unticking the option to create a bootable Windows disk.\n\n*Chose a partition size of 64 GB for the Windows partition.\n\n*At this point I think the Mac tried to reboot itself, but as I was typing in a browser window at the time I seem to have cancelled that by mistake. So (and this is where I think I went wrong), I manually rebooted with the Windows USB stick in the USB slot.\n\n*The Mac rebooted and the windows stick took over, and I chose to install to the 64GB partition I made in Boot Camp. \n\n*This all went fine, but the Mac now boots straight into Windows, but seems to be missing drivers for lots of stuff, most importantly the wireless network card. \n\n\nI can't see any way to get back to Mac OS X.  I've subsequently read about a tool called rEFIt that I was perhaps supposed to run before Boot Camp, but I haven't done that to date.\nIs there any way to trash the windows partition and get back to Mac OS?\n\nA: Shut down your MacBook, then hold down Option ⌥ key and turn it on. You will see a boot menu, choose OS X. When logged in into OS X, click System Preferences > Startup Disk, and choose which OS to start by default.\nTo set up Boot Camp drivers, download them via Boot Camp Assistant (WindowsSupport) folder, write the installers to a USB stick, and run from within Windows.\n\nA: Install the free bootmanager REFit or one of its branches and everytime the computer boots (after the startup chime) a screen where you can choose which one to boot will show up avoiding this problem for good.

This is a question from Wil Wheaton's google+, but I would like to get an answer too, stackexchange style.\nSuppose you have all your music in a folder called /iTunes/Music. When you add files to iTunes, it puts them inside this folder, so it looks like this: /iTunes/Music/artist/album/track\nSuppose you recently eliminated about 10GB of music from your iTunes library, but stupidly left those files inside /iTunes/Music. You have the entire thing backed up and pristine on an external drive, so you don't need to keep that music in that folder.\nHere's the question: you want to write a script that will compare your iTunes library to the contents of /iTunes/Music, identify files that are in /iTunes/Music but not the iTunes Library file, and  move them to a new folder (probably in /tmp) so you can take a look, then delete them.\nOne possible solution  would be to write  a script which puts the output of ls (with appropriate flags) into a file, then diff that file with the contents of Library.xml, and move the resulting files into a new directory. Is it possible to do this?\nMaybe there is already an Applescript which can be used to achieve this?\n\nA: You could move the location of your iTunes Media folder, which will only move those files actually in the iTunes library.\nIt may take a while, even if the source and destination are both on the same drive (it's still got to tell the OS to move each file individually), but should leave behind any files that aren't in the library.\nThe iTunes Media folder location is set in iTunes Preferences, under the Advanced tab. This will of course only work if you have \"Keep iTunes Media folder organized\" checked (which judging by your question is the case).\nI would suggest something as simple as changing just the name of the folder it's currently set to (i.e. keep it somewhere in your home folder, or whatever drive it's currently on), and then move it back after you've cleaned out the 'orphaned' files.\n\nA: Try this script. It's from Doug's AppleScripts. I never used it, but sounds like what you are looking for.\n", "Q: How to open files from unknown developers without a warning in OSX?

Your question says \"simulate mouse-down events\", that's what's being covered in my answer. I used an application back in 2010, and I'm pleasantly surprised it's still being updated, and supports Mountain Lion.\nIt's called Mac Auto Mouse Click, and it's pretty configurable. You can set it to click anywhere on the screen and remember the position, and execute a whole series of commands, including keystrokes. It's also fairly simple to use.

I just got my iPhone 5, and I deactivated my iPhone 4. I am wondering if I can keep my iPhone 4 as a iPod that I run with.  Question is can, my Nike+ app still accurately track my runs?\nI would much rather continue using my iPhone 4 running equipment (special case, armband, etc) instead of going to buy new stuff. \n\nA: Yes, the GPS does not need cellular data or cellular service to work. It will get better results when GPS is offline if it can poll the location database and trilateralate from both Wi-Fi and cellular towers, but GPS is generally better than the these secondary sources of location data.\nThe phone should connect to Wi-Fi regularly to keep the location database up to date - perhaps while tethered to your iPhone 5 for optimal results.\nFor most situations it will work almost as if it were connected to cellular data and the cellular data switch was off.\n", "Q: Add recovery partition back onto drive after drive change \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to recreate Lion Recovery HD partition? \n\nI hope this question is different enough from the others that is doesn't get closed.\nI am first time Mac user, long time Linux user, so pardon my ignorance in the Apple terminology.\nI have a late 2011 MBP that I replaced the drive with an SSD.

I currently own an iMac G4 that I bought from someone online. But now that I try to update it, it won't let me. The Safari doesn't work and I really just want to clean it up and really start from fresh.\n\nA: You need to contact the seller and see if they have the original OS install discs, as they'll have iLife and a correct version of OS X. Barring that, try to get ahold of a set of retail OS install discs for anywhere from 10.3 (Panther) to 10.5 (Leopard). I'd suggest you get the newest your system will support. (It's important to look for retail discs so you don't have to spend extra energy trying to match your Mac's exact specs and model with the one the discs were shipped with.)\nHow to choose which disc to get if you can find multiple OS versions?\n\n\n*\n\n*10.2 - iMac G4s shipped with as low as OS X 10.2 (Jaguar), but an OS install/upgrade disc won't necessarily have the drivers to support your machine, and some iMac G4s may simply be too new for 10.2 to support them at all. \n\n*10.3 - This is the lowest you should go if possible. Look for install DVDs (rare) or packs of install CDs. (I think there's two or three CDs to install the OS.)\n\n*10.4 - Make sure you get a retail version of 10.4. This is when Intel Macs were introduced, and an Intel Mac's OS install disc will simply do nothing in your PowerPC iMac. Look for DVDs. (Code-named Tiger.)\n\n*10.5 - Not all iMac G4s support 10.5 (Leopard). Anything with a processor slower than 867 MHz won't get Leopard. If you have an 867 MHz or faster CPU, you can use any retail Leopard DVD (these discs are for both Intel and PowerPC). As with Tiger, be wary of system-specific install discs, as most (if not all) Macs that shipped with Leopard were Intel Macs.\n\n", "Q: How to set an iPad back to factory settings where I have forgotton the restrictions passcode?

Ideally a recovery partition would be created as well during the process.\n\nA: If you have some extra disk space to spare, I would recommend you to make an additional backup with SuperDuper (free for basic functionality, which is all you need in this case!):\nYou will create a bootable backup, from which you can then boot after you get the repaired Mac back. Test this backup by booting from it once (important) and play around a bit to see if everything feels as it should (improves gut feeling).\nThen, you would use SuperDuper, which obviously also is on the backup you have just booted from, and use it to \"backup\" back to your freshly installed, empty hard drive.\nUPDATE: To create the a recovery partition, you can use this useful hint from How can I create or recreate a Lion recovery partition?.\nUpsides of this method: You can immediately boot from your external disk, where the bootable backup sits, and you do not have to freshly install Lion, then upgrade to Mountain Lion, and then restore from the Time Machine backup.

Then presents them to you, to choose and edit, or play around, and then generates events directly in iCal which can be synced with the iPhone.  \n\nA: Asked quite some time ago, and the feature was not yet implemented.\nBut there is a work-around, using your friend Google.\nIn short:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create/use a Google mail account\n\n*On https://contacts.google.com create a contact with birthday and/or other dates:\n\n\n*Add your Google account to your iOS/macOS device - how? read https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/99358\n\n*In iOS Calendar, activate from that account the calendar Birthday\n\n*See your contact's birthday and/or other dates in the Calendar app:\n\n(Please excuse the unprofessional screenshot)\n\nA: Hmm, I can tell you how to add the field easily, but it doesn't seem to be widely supported.

I have tried 'Detect displays' and this doesn't help, since my mac appears to know that there is not a second monitor. How can I move the window back to my desktop without having to plug it in to another monitor and drag it across?\n\nA: I use a window manager by default (I highly recommend them anyway) and that will let you move windows back (my personal recomendation is Divy http://mizage.com/divvy/ - but I think they are all pretty similar)  \n", "Q: Can not open Mail app since I updated the last version of Mountain Lion (10.8.2) I just updated my version of Mountain Lion and then when I try to open my Mail app I receive this message :\n\nI tried to reinstall Mail but I don't know how to do it.\nAnyone know what the problem is?\n\nA: The correct version of Mail.app for OS X 10.8.2 (in my case build 12C60) would be 6.2, so your version is too old.

Once I VPN somewhere, it no longer uses those changes. Is there a way to set the search domains globally (ie. for every device: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and VPN) on Mac OS X Lion?\n\nA: There was a similar issue in 2002 with OS X. I found a few articles about it and I've been able to address this issue by simply adding \"local\" to the Search Domains in the advanced network properties of my network interface. This has allowed those of connecting via VPN to resolve .local hosts.\n\nA: Why not just add it to the adapter in question? i.e. ethernet or Wi-Fi: http://support.apple.com/kb/PH14159\nPer: https://web.archive.org/web/20150227052942/http://support.apple.com/kb/PH14159\n\nFor example, if you specify the search domain apple.com, typing “store” in your web browser takes you to store.apple.com.

They should have complete access to everything, they can create, delete, edit files but sometimes they can't move them or rename them. It seems to be limited to files they created but I'm not 100%, anyone come across this before?\nEdit:\nOn further investigation, it's not permissions it's file locking. Some programs including preview or opening files (assuming locking them) and not releasing. Killing all the programs or remounting the share sees to working but it's a workaround that's not really acceptable to the users.\n\nA: Feels a bit cheeky answering my own question but I've spent enough time searching through boards that don't go anywhere to know how frustrating that can be.\nIt's not a permissions issues, I like a lot people assumed it was a permissions issue. It's file locking. The Mac opens a file that's hosted on the server and closes it, but the directory above the directory the file is contained in stays open. It's this directory that can't be moved or renamed. To close the connection you can unmount and remount the share drive, or you can kill finder, or on windows server you can Right Click on Computer, Select Manage, Expand Roles, Expand File Services, click on Share and Storage Managment. Then click Action from the menu at the top, then Manage Open Files. That will bring up a dialogue showing all the open files on the computer, I like to order by open file so I can see the file paths in order. Select the problem folder(s) and click close selected.\nThe latter open sounds harder but once the dialog is open it's easier to manage if you have a lot of users.\nThis is still not a solution, it's a workaround but I thought I could help someone else search. \n\nA: Ensure that you are using the SMB/CIFS (Samba) protocol when connecting using Finder.\nTry typing cifs:// instead of smb://\n\nA: I concur with Keith's last answer: File Locking seems to be the root cause. His \"solutions\" also work for us, but none of those are of course a workable permanent solution.\nI have now replicated this problem with Mac OS X 10.6.5 - 10.8.2\nI have also verified that this is not a problem with \"Named Streams\" as described at http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4017.\nCreating file \".com.apple.smb.streams.off\" at the root of the share does not clear the problem.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 4.1 not responsive? I have an old MacBook Pro lying around that a friend left with me. I believe it is the 4.1 model, it should be the last one before the Unibody models came out (can't access About This Mac and the serial number rubbed off as well). I knew it wasn't working before but I tried booting it up to see if I could get it working.\nAnyways, it seems to boot up fine but the keyboard and trackpad seem non-responsive. It does say Remote Mouse in the top toolbar, I think my friend installed some software to use the mouse through her iPod, but I would think the trackpad would still work. Also, it's weird because it does search for WiFi hotspots and finds them and also when I press the power button the shutdown menu comes up.  My friend mentioned there may have been a hard drive issue.  Do you guys know what might be the problem and if it is fixable?\nOn a side note, I also have a 15\" late 2008 (5.1) model that I use but the optical drive is broken. Would I be able to swap the drive from the broken Mac to my newer one?\n\nA: It's likely that the controller for the trackpad and keyboard (I believe it's one chip for both) is dead. I had an issue where the keyboard and trackpad on an older pre-unibody model would become non-responsive, but the rest of the top case components were fine (power button, back light). It was tracked to a faulty controller in the top case, but the solution was to replace the whole thing.\niFixit sells replacement top cases, but they're rather pricey ($299.95 for the A1260-compatible part). You might be able to find a cheaper one used on Ebay or elsewhere. The repair itself is fairly straightforward.\nHave you tried plugging in a USB mouse or keyboard yet? If the problem is what I think it is, that should work fine.\n\nA: You can try an SMC reset or  PRAM reset as well, this could reset the \"potential\" issue with the firmware caused by the remote mouse.  \nMore than likely this is damaged from liquid or some other component failure.  USB keyboard and mouse are another test to try.  \n", "Q: Tap to tweet/tap to post is at the bottom of the notification center On iOS 6 on my iPhone the tap to tweet/tap to post buttons are located on the bottom of the notification center causing me to either have to scroll down or clear some messages before I can see them. \nOn my iPad it is on the top, which makes me think that is where it should also be on my iPhone. Is this normal expected behavior or has something gone wrong with my phone? \nAny possible fixes would be appreciated. \n\nA: In the Notifications section of the Settings app, you can tap the Edit button in the upper right to make handles appear (three thick horizontal lines) on each of the items  in Notification Center.\n \nYou can drag the items up or down by these handles to re-order them, so just drag the Share Widget item to the top, if that's where you want it, then tap done.\n", "Q: Two different versions of Finder in OS X 10.8 after migrating from OS 10.3 Panther While setting up new Mac Mini I checked the option to move files and settings from my old Mac to the new Mac. The old Mac was a 2008 MacBook Pro running OS X 10.3 Panther. \nEverything seemed to go well and all my apps copied over to the new machine, but when I open Finder I get the old Finder window, the one from OS X 10.3 Panther. If I open a folder using Spotlight I get an OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion Finder window.\nHow can I fix things so my system only ever uses the Mountain Lion version of Finder?\n\nA: The only way to fix this is to do a fresh erase and install to Mountain Lion and when you restore from the previous backup, do NOT transfer the settings.  FYI, if you made a \"Time Machine\" backup you had to be much newer than 10.3. \nIf this is the case then the backup should be fully compatible.  Just do not put a check mark in the settings box.

I'm trying to compile a file using Python and I receive this message:\nerror: could not create '/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/7.3/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tulip': Permission denied\n\nWhy is the permission denied? How can I fix this?\n\nA: It's trying to create a file in the system installation of Python (i.e. it's going in the root Library folder). That folder is only writeable by root (to prevent damaging important system files), hence why you're getting a permission error.\nRunning the command with sudo preceding it, i.e. sudo foo bar will give you the proper permissions, after asking for your password.

I'm getting desperate – since I got my MacBook Air three months ago I haven't used it a single time without Wi-Fi dropping.\n\nA: I finally \"solved\" the problem by just buying a new router. It seems my old router triggered some kind of bug in OS X - making it drop the Wi-Fi connection whereas Windows and Linux installs would remain connected. It seems the other routers I tried coincidentally caused the same problem. With my new router the drops seem to be gone and I can move my MacBook as much as I want without it disconnecting.\n\nA: This could be related to Apple deciding not to use 40Mhz channel width in 2.4Mhz band as to avoid Bluetooth interference which there devices use a lot.\n\nIt is also worth noting that this limitation seems to be a deliberate\n  attempt by Apple software (MAC OS X) rather than a hardware\n  restriction, as in 2.4 GHz band Apple won't allow 40 MHz \"wide\"\n  channels as they want to preserve the functionality of Bluetooth which\n  comes alongside with Wi-Fi in most Macs which shares the same\n  bandwidth spectrum. Allowing 40 MHz wide channels in 2.4 GHz band\n  would have severely constrained Bluetooth functionality.\n\nReference : iMac's inability to connect with WiFi 802.11n only access point \nNow, since in this case we are able to connect, and changing the router did fixed the problem I would guess this has something to do with the router login shuffling between 20 and 40 Mhz band when connecting to different devices.\n\nA: This is a topic I have followed online and in \"real life\" for several months. Anecdotally, Apple seems to have a wifi problem with the 2012 MacBookAir. I have no firm figures concerning how widespread this situation is, but I know of two other MacBook Air laptops that have displayed this issue: \n\n\n*\n\n*the MBA I purchased in hopes that I could use it attached to a\nprojector as the remote end of a video presentation at a conference I\nhad to miss for health reasons. I returned the computer one week\nlater after investing ten or so hours trying to fix dropping WiFi\nconnections.\n\n*my oldest daughter's 2012 12\" MBA that she still has and is now connecting more reliably, close to 95%+\nThe resulting story is long, but reading the full adventure might help to open your eyes to the minutiae that helped me resolve her WiFi nightmare.\nShortly after purchasing the MBA for my daughter, she started complaining of wifi drops, initially at home and then she began experiencing drops everywhere--but not at my office where my AirPort Extreme literally sits on a shelf, three feet above my head. My initial thought focused on signal strength and distance from the router. While attending college she lives at my parents' home. The walls are lathe and plaster and the WiFi access point was at the opposite side of the house. I don't remember the brand, but it could have been a Linksys or DLink, and was only a 2.4GHz wireless-G unit.\nWhile working with my daughter, I started some online research, including Apple Discussion boards. When I saw how many posts and complaints floated around the internet, and how few people had positive response from Genius Bar denizens, I figured that I would need strong documentation if I was going to get anywhere with them.\nI worked to document and remedy connection stability on two fronts. \nIf you'd rather cut to The Chase and skip the steps that expanded my understanding of the issue, scroll down to the end of my post.\nTracking and replicating problems with her computer\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple includes WiFi Diagnostics with OS X. Select Open WiFi Diagnostics from the WiFi menu while holding the OPTION key. \n\n*Don't worry about the three options on the main app screen, but first select Wi-Fi Scan from the View menu. \n\n*\n\n*The channel, width, band, signal and noise are all listed. \n\n*You want the least competition for channels. Change that at the router if needed. \n\n*Signal and Noise are affected by interference from walls, electrical wiring and other environmental issues. \n\n*\n\n*The larger the gap between the signal and noise represents a better connection.\n\n\n*Much of this information is available on the WiFi menu if you hold the OPTION key while clicking on the menu.\n\n*You can get a visual ticker tape for signal/noise by selecting Performance in the Network Utilities window.\n\n\n*Keep a log of approximate time/date, RSSI (signal strength), transmit rate and any important events. \n\n*\n\n*Don't worry about keeping this log religiously. \n\n*Make a note any time you experience a noticeable change in WiFi speed. \n\n*Note the times you reset the WiFi router.\n\n*Every time you have a WiFi drop, be sure to note the event and the signal strength and rate. \n\n*More than dates and strengths, look for patterns. \n\n*\n\n*At home, WIFI dropped\n\n*Logged out and back in\n\n*Walked from room\n\n*Connected to the DSL WiFi router at dad's house and dropped.\n\n*Rebooted laptop\n\n*Laptop on table\n\n*Lots if static from wind\n\n*At library, no WIFI drops\n\n*Just rebooted router\n\n*At dad's and connected to the Time Capsule. Not dropped.\n\n*At hardware store, WIFI dropped\n\n\n*Note any errors the MBA displays.\n\n*\n\n*Unexpected WiFi timeout\n\n\n\n*If all else fails, you have something to take with you to the Genius Bar or discuss with Apple support that has stronger documentation than \"The damn thing doesn't work!\"\n\n*I also attempted to replicate the WiFi problems with my early-2009 17\" MacBook Pro. My laptop remained connected every time we were together and hers dropped the WiFi.\n\n\nTracking and replicating problems with the router\n\n\n*\n\n*General router information...\n\n*\n\n*What make/model is your wireless router?\n\n*How old is it?\n\n*Are you connecting using 2.4GHz, 5GHz or both?\n\n\n*General site description...\n\n*\n\n*How far away is the router from where you use your MBA?\n\n\n*Create a wireless site survey with NetSpot\n\n*\n\n*It's a free download from the Mac App Store. \n\n*Use the program to draw out a map of where you use your computer (home, office, etc.) including all the interior walls between you and the router. \n\n*You walk around the site, using NetSpot to capture signal strength, noise and other information. \n\n*Post a capture of the results and I'll be happy to help see what might help.\n\n\n\nGenerally, you'll have better connectivity closer to the router. If you have a clear line of sight to the router, you should have a good signal.\nI know my daughter got sick and tired of having WiFi drop, rebooting the router and/or her MBA.\nHow I finally made things better\nI ended up controlling the two variables I could directly manipulate: signal strength and age of WiFi router. In the end, my solution improved internet connectivity throughout my parents' home, benefitting everyone.\nI started out replacing the router with another older, non-Apple one I had sitting around my office, possibly an old AirLink. No positive affect. Then I replaced it with a third slightly-newer, non-Apple router. Again, no change. In order to re-connect after a drop, my daughter would walk to the other side of the house and reboot the router every time there was a wireless drop.\nI brought a 30' length of CAT-5 from the office so I could position the various router closer to her bedroom. WiFi signal strength and overall quality improved, but she still experienced the drops three or four times a day. I think she would have been happy at this point, but the problem had become personal with me.\nAs I analyzed everything, I decided to introduce the one element she had not experienced from my office into my daughter's home:\n\n\n*\n\n*I snagged an AirPort Express from my shop and reconfigured it for her\nlocal network. It replaced the older, non-Apple router that was\nthere. Unbeknownst to me, we had the AirPort Express plugged into\na power outlet shared with a lamp that was controlled by a wall\nswitch. My daughter switched off the light when she would leave for\ncollege, and also the router. Quality improved once again, with\nsignal drops once or twice a day. My parents were starting to get\nannoyed by a twisty blue wire running through their home.\n\n*We changed the outlet to one with permanent power and after a couple \nof days the signal stabilized and seemed to finally start running\nproperly. However, my parents were still annoyed by the twisty blue\nwire running through their home. I figured I was close enough to a\nstable solution that I invested some money in hopes of staunching the\nflow of time and phone calls at all hours of the night. Money became \nless important than sleep.\n\n*I installed a AirPort Extreme where the DSL modem is located at the\nfar end of my parents' house, in my dad's office. The Extreme bathes\nthe office with multichannel 5GHz goodness that links between 300MBs\nand 450MBs. This one access point covers that half of the house with\n2.4GHz coverage and 150MBs to 270MBs connectivity.\n\n*I dragged a CAT6 cable through the hot and dusty attic to a location\nnear my daughter's bedroom, near the other end of the house. I\nattached an AirPort Express at this end which provides a near mirror\nof the Extreme.\n\n*I bound the 5GHz and 2.4GHz into a single SSID/Network name.\n\n*I enabled the Express to extend the Extreme's wireless network,\nconnecting the two access points for passwords and transparent\npassing from one access point to the other as one moves throughout\nthe house.\n\n*Both the AirPorts are powered and connected to the DSL modem 24/7.\n\n*While I was at it, I enabled a guest network with a separate\npassword.\n\n\n\nThe Chase\nI think the 2012 MacBook Air WiFi issue might be because Apple has integrated Intel's more aggressive power-saving modes into the laptop. In a drive to maximize battery life, these new low-power modes change how (and how often) the laptop communicates with the wireless access point.\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple introduces Intel's deep power states as Power Nap on their latest equipment.\n\n*From what I've been able to read on OEMs implementing the new lower\npower modes (and we'll group Apple in as just another OEMs), Intel needs\ngreater control of the various components on the motherboard and has met resistance. \n\n*The price-sensitive business model that drives the Windows world\nforces most OEMs to include the lowest-cost subsystems, not\nnecessarily the latest technology.\n\n*Since Apple does not play in the race to the bottom with prices and\nprofitability, the company often offers newer technology in their\nproducts.\n\n*Apple is pushing the limits of throughput vs power consumption with\nthe 2012 MBA's WiFi subsystems. My 2009 MBP keeps the WiFi powered on\nat all times so will never see the problem introduced when mixing an\nolder router with a newer laptop.\n\n*Older routers would see an IP address turning themselves off at\nrandom times...  which then would drop the connection.\n\n*The 2012 MBA expects wireless access points to provide a longer time duration\nbefore releasing a connection. \n\n*I found timeout durations in all the older routers' HTML-based\nconfiguration systems, but could not make a change to any of them\nfrom the default values.\n\n*When a system that has powered down the WiFi subsystem (even though\nthe user believes they are still working merrily right along) needs\nto ping the Internet, the MBA powers up the \"sleeping\" WiFi\nsubsystem, only to discover the wireless access point has terminated\ntheir connection.\n\n\nYes, this is a long-winded and overly-detailed story. I spent several hours this afternoon thinking through each element of the plot as I typed the events, and I'm somewhat embarrassed to admit I completely rewrote the ending because of thoughts developed and linked with random memories that I hadn't seen as possibly being interrelated. \nThere are many times that my quick, three line answer does not allow me the time to \"think with my fingers\". Instead of resolving an issue I sloppily (and possibly expensively) slapped a band-aid on the owie. \nI resolved the dropped network issue by replacing the \"antiquated\" WiFi router with a \"modern\" one. I just happened to select one manufactured by Apple. \nEither \n\n\n*\n\n*increase the time an older router will keep an inactive connection\nalive before timeout (which may not be changeable in any given older\nrouter), or\n\n*replace it with one that supports Intel's newer power-saving states.\n\n\nA: Have you tried re-installing your system? A clean install I mean.\nIt might be that for some reason some drivers didn't get installed correctly, or that something got corrupted.\nIt might also be that your Mac loses connection to the wifi for some reason, not sure what else to say. Have you Googled for your problem? It might be a common issue with MacBook Air Macs, in 2012.\nHope this helps. :)\n\nA: It's not easy to find a solution but the problem can from your wifi router.\nSuggestion, try :\n\n\n*\n\n*another channel (if you have an android device, some apps can help\nyou to find the better channel)\n\n*another wpa option aes/tkip\n\n*another place (microwave is not wifi friendly), less interference\n(other hardware)\n\n*another router (or upgrade with the last bios)\n\n\nhttp://www.pcworld.com/article/227973/six_things_that_block_your_wifi_and_how_to_fix_them.html\n\nA: Try change MAC dddress, because I think you device conflic with arp table on router wifi (or arp poisoning)\nS1: disconnect from wifi network, but not turn off wifi card\nS2: change your MAC address of wifi card by command: sudo /sbin/ifconfig en1 lladdr 0:23:15:58:f4:21\nS3: reconnect to wifi network and use about 1 hour\n\nA: I'll try to answer your question.\nFrom bullets 1-3 follows that problem is definitely in your MBA.\nFrom bullets 4, 6, 7 follows that problem is not in OS X software.\nFrom bullet 5 follows that problem is not in Wi-Fi chip hardware.\nIt follows that problem in other MBA hardware.\nFrom bullet 8 follows that problem is handled by OS X and Windows differently.\nYou wrote that Wi-Fi drops occur more often when you move MBA.

When I select 11 or any other channel, everything is OK.\nTry manually specifying the channel and see if that fixes your problem.\n\nA: I solved the problem by switching the wifi router to channel 11.\nI think that there is a problem with some routers in auto channel mode using 802.11n.  When the channel changes, Mountain Lion drops the connection. \n\nA: Wifi channel changing on router from one to another, in my case from 11 to 10, solved the issue.\n\nA: I had a similar problem with my Macbook air mid 2012. The wireless connection had been dropping randomly and then my macbook couldn't find my home network again, though it might found every other networks in the town. I changed my router's wifi channel settings from 12 to 11 and voila.

I want to edit Info.plist for TextEdit. (Here's why.)  I'm running OS 10.7, and I do have Xcode installed.  But every time I try to edit the file, it's locked and I can't save my changes.\nIf I try to save it with Xcode, Xcode asks if I want to unlock it.  I say \"Unlock\", but then an error says The file \"Info.plist\" could not be unlocked.\"; it says that this is because I do not own it.  \nIf I open Info.plist using vi in Terminal (vi Info.plist), I can't save changes even using :w!.  The error is E212: Can't open file for writing.\nHow can I make changes to TextEdit's Info.plist file?\n\nA: If you want to edit the file (as you describe above), you don't necessarily have to unlock it. If you're fine with working on the command line, you may edit the file using the command line tools provided by Apple. Prepend the commands with sudo to gain the required rights to modify the file (you will need to enter your admin password).\nNamely these programs are defaults and PlistBuddy (run as sudo /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy).\nWhile defaults is a more direct way of modifying the file, PlistBuddy has an interactive mode wich lets you preview your changes before saving.\nDocumentation for defaults\nDocumentation for PlistBuddy\nIf required, you can also use plutil to convert between the different formats.\nRemember that you can get help about all of these commands on the command line by typing man <command> (e.g. man defaults).\n\nA: It did not work for me allowing the edit by unlocking the file. I had to duplicate it, edit and then remove the original file.

Our company has a small office but we often work remotely. One of our service providers requires that we access their customer service portal from a known IP address. We don't all have dedicated IPs for our home connection so we were hoping to use our Airport Extreme base station to setup a forward.\nI expected to find this in Airport Utility->Network.\nThere is a section for Port Settings which we're using to forward specific ports to a windows machine on our local 10.0.1.x network. However, I'd like to forward the inbound traffic on a specific port back out to a public IP address so it looks like we're all hitting the portal from the office IP address.\nWhen I try to add another entry the IP address to forward to (labeled Private IP Address) is already set to 10.0.1.\nIs this possible with an Airport Extreme?\n\nA: I don't think this is possible. \nPossibly you could turn on a web server on one of your computers and forward the requests to that from the airport basestation. It then could be forwarded from that computer to the address.\n\nA: There is no way for the Airport Extreme to forward the request on it's own.\nThe router is there to forward traffic from your local network (LAN) out to the Internet (WAN) on an IP network. LAN traffic is routed with MAC addresses through a switch or Router.  NAT allows the single IP of your router to be shared by the LAN clients through Network Address Translate (NAT) but it only allows inbound traffic if it is in reply to a specific outbound request. Port forwarding allows requests for specific services to come into to a single IP address. Like a mail server, ftp, or ssh. It is most often used for gaming. \nWhat you are asking for is to allow an IP address that is not on your network to be allowed into your network and then translated as if it originated inside your network then the reply would come into your network and be sent back out to the IP address that originated the request. You may be able to set a proxy server up to do something like this but not an Airport Extreme Plus. It would expose your entire LAN to the Internet by opening up all incoming addresses because you would have the same problem as your vendor as to which incoming ip address to trust. \n", "Q: Does the new iPhone 5 Lightning connector still provide serial output (or does it when the dock connector adapter?)? I'm working on an iPhone DIY dock kit, that exposes the serial connection for controlling the music playback controls through the serial port (Apple Accessory Protocol).\nDoes anyone know if the AAP serial commands still work with the new Lightning connector, or even better, with the dock adapter (since I'm not going to be shelling out for Apple's hardware developer program just yet)? I've had a hard time googling it successfully, other than that the adapter works with some other hardware and things like the MintyBoost DIY charger.\n\nA: I dont't know if this is what your're looking for but anyways.\nMomentarily it is a work in progress. I hope we'll get some info soon.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f8aUUHrHKc\nP.S. I am not affiliated with this, I was just looking for it.\n\nA: I think you should talk with somebody with access to that API, an Apple Hardware Developer. The program is called MFi Program.\nAs I know, there is no easy go on that, as they keep things really private. \nAnd it costs a lot of money per year to have access to hardware details.\nBut I hope, you can find some info out there, google harder.\n", "Q: Completed Reminders not syncing to iOS from OS X Running the most recent version of OS X Mountain Lion and iOS 6.0, I'm able to sync all my Reminders between all my devices.\nHowever, though the Reminders themselves will sync across all my devices, their completion state will only cross the same platform (that is, if I complete a Reminder on OS X, all my Macs will show as complete, but not my iOS devices, and vice versa).\nIs there a setting that I can check somewhere to fix this, or is it working as intended?\n\nA: Quoting a solution I found in the Apple community web site:\n\nI was having this problem. I changed the syncing range on the phone (under Settings > Reminders) to sync All Reminders. I then logged into iCloud and opened the Reminders tab. This actually caused the reminders on the phone to match the ones in iCloud.  I then made changes on my phone while that tab was still opened and the changes started to appear in iCould (sometimes takes a few seconds - up to 20 or 30) and synched on my iPad as well. After that, all of my changes started to sync across all devices - iPhone, iPad,Mac and in iCloud, regardless of where I made the initial change.\nHopefully this will work for you too.\n\nLink here.\n", "Q: Can a Thunderbolt iMac be used in target display mode while booted into Windows 7? Slightly different than what I'm seeing in search:\nIf I have my iMac booted into Windows 7, can I (via Thunderbolt) use the iMac as a target display from my Thunderbolt MacBook Pro running OS X?\n\nA: Target Display Mode is not supported from Boot Camp\nRef: Apple KB - Use your iMac as a display with Target Display Mode\n\nIf your iMac is currently started up in Windows, it won't enter Target\n  Display Mode.

For example, on my PC, iTunes shows up on my husband's user name but not mine.\n\nA: When you install a software on windows it usually asks \"install for this account only or for all accounts\". It looks like your husband chose \"for my account only\". I do not know any option to change this later.\nLast week I re-installed a program I had the same problem with. When it asked me, I then chose \"for all accounts\".\nThe user settings for the existing installation were not harmed.\n\nA: The most simple thing to do is uninstall the iTunes and reinstall it selecting install for all users. Alternatively you can just install it under your username and it will likely realize that it's already been installed and may just allow the required files to be installed for your use. \nIt's possible though that the iTunes installed in such a way that it's only not visible to you but you can likely still run it. The simplest way to test this would be to go to, default on most computers:\nc:\\users\\[your username]\\desktop\n\non the admin account and place a shortcut to iTunes on your desktop. On the .exe for iTunes you might have to right click->Properties->Security and give the appropriate permissions to [your username]. If it works then you're done. If it doesn't it might be more tricky than that and it might not ever work without reinstalling. \n", "Q: Does deleting an iMessage on a device deletes it in all of the other iCloud synced devices? If I have my iPad and my iPhone synced through iCloud and I can see that my text messages  are being received/sent on both. If I send an iMessage on my iPad and immediately delete the entire text thread on my iPad, does it in turn delete the text threat off of my iPhone?  If not, does it show the iMessage I sent from my iPad?\nPretty much what happened was I was over my buddy's house and his iPhone and iPad are synced to iCloud.  I am assuming this because he had been text messaging me all day and all of the most current text messages were showing on his iPad.  I used his iPad to send a text message to my wife with some of our bank account information she needed. \nI immediately deleted the text thread from the ipad (My wife also has an iPhone so I am assuming it was an iMessage). \nMy question is does this iMessage go to his phone still if I deleted it?  Or does it delete from his phone because I deleted it from his iPad?\n\nA: My experience is you cannot actually delete an iMessage once and have it delete elsewhere.\nYou can only delete the local cached copy of a message to suppress it being showed/stored on that one device. If you turn off iMessage and turn it back on, you will see the messages from iCloud come back whether you deleted a message or not.\n\nA: I am not convinced that simply deleting a message from the Messages app on an iOS device actually fully removes that message from the device that you sent / deleted from. One time I got tired of having a long list of old messages conversations so I deleted all of them.  A few minutes later I was searching for something via spotlight on the same device & it started showing messages results with no actual conversations left in the messages app itself. \nThe answer to your actual question is unquestionably NO.  It will remain visible on another synced device until deleted from that device, and it may remain searchable via spotlight even after that. Although not the same per say, the concept could be thought of as being similar to a POP email account verses a IMAP email account. With POP the action that you take regarding am email once downloaded to some sort of application will not be reflected on the server. Checked a downloaded POP email on you I-devices mail app will not result in that email being marked as read on the server. \nIf you're worried about it, if its sensitive enough w information, I would go to each device, delete the message, go to the device's spotlight preferences & confirm that it is searching messages, and the perform a spotlight search using a word that may be specific to just that message. If nothing comes up I'd say you're reasonably safe. If it does show up you'll need advice from someone more knowledgable than me.  \n", "Q: Logs and eMail headers from THE Future\"? iPad Console Logs & eMail headers from the Future\n\nWhat does the  \"-700\" mean in an eMail header when next to Date/Time Stampt?\nI've noticed some of my iPad Console Logs display as +7hours AHEAD of the time they were collected.  \nAnd recently, I checked an eMail Header and noticed the same strange time shift when forwarded.  (specifically to /from certain recipients).\nWhat does this mean?  \nI have not found any location  on our planet which is 7+ hours ahead of PST Time?  \n\nA: The -700 is relative to UTC time and used to describe the time zone. UTC-700 is used in many places, probably including where you live.\nThe messages are shown with their UTC timestamp and the timezone offset. Subtract 7 hours from the time and you'll have the time in your local time zone. This is what computers do behind the scenes.\n\nAlso, one word of advice: the iPad console logs are meant for people developing software. If you're not doing that, looking through the logs is generally pointless. If things are working, don't worry about things you see in the logs :-)\n", "Q: How does using GMail via IMAP or Exchange affect battery life? What are the differences with respect to battery life between using the regular Gmail setup as opposed to the Exchange setup?\nI know that the Exchange allows for push, but is battery life affected much?\n\nA: I have an IMAP and an Exchange email account on my iPhone 4S and when I only use Exchange my battery drains faster than when only using IMAP.\nWhile I have configured IMAP to check for new email every 30 min, I must say I get lots of email in my Exchange account, that probably worsens the drainage.\nApple recommends here to \"Turn off push mail\", so it is a known fact.\nHow much is battery affected? I can't give you a number, it depens on many factors (how often data is fetched, number of emails you get, size of the emails you get) so just test it: disable Gmail IMAP, configure Gmail ActiveSync and compare.\n--EDIT--\nAfter reading Michiel's answer below I was curious and googled \"push vs. fetch iphone\" and have seen quite a few debates. The outcome tended to be that using push conserves battery life, but some opinions just said \"it depends\".\nMy configuration is probably unbalanced and that's why Exchange uses more battery than IMAP (which is fetched every 30 min and not the 15 min as I posted in my original answer, now corrected). Please take this answer as my personal (non representative) experience.\nIn the link above Apple also recommends to \"Fetch new data less frequently\".\nSo again, test it and find out for yourself.\n--/EDIT--\n\nA: It's a matter of Push versus Fetch.\nWith Push (Exchange), the mail-server pushes new messages towards your device. While with Fetch (GMail), the device checks on the mail-server once in a while to check if there are new messages.\nSo, logically, Push uses much less battery then Fetch. Since your Fetch-device will check on the mail server every x-minutes. No matter if they are new messages or not.\nPush will only connect to the mail-server if there are new messages.\nLuckily, you can configure your GMail account as a Push account following these guidelines.\n", "Q: How do I enable cache in iPad I want to be able to use an HTML5 WebApp, but my iPad won't cache the manifest. The WebApp works on Android and BlackBerry devices, so I know it's not the code.\nAnd is it different for the various iPad versions? \nI have the first gen. iPad, but I will need to be able to help folks with more recent iPads.\n\nA: Settings > Safari > Accept cookies > Always\n\n\nA: There is nothing to enable; all versions of iOS Safari on all iOS devices support the cache manifest by default and I'm not aware of any way to turn it off.\nIssues you're seeing are probably caused by bugs or unexpected behavior in iOS, Safari, or your code.\n", "Q: Why is the iPod Touch 5th gen able to record 1080p yet the iPhone 4 isn't? Looking at the specs, both the iPod Touch 5th gen and the iPhone 4 have five megapixel rear facing cameras. \nWhy, then, is the iPod Touch 5th gen able to record 1080p while the iPhone 4 is only able to record 720p?\nIs this a software limitation, or is there something better about the iPod Touch's hardware?\n\nA: Camera sensors are not only limited in their resolution, but also in the rate at which the image data can be read off of them.\nJust because a sensor can take 5-megapixel still images doesn't mean that all of that data can be read off the sensor fast enough to record (smooth) video. Even reading just a subset of the pixels (called pixel binning) to reduce the amount of data may not be enough to get 1080p images at, say, 30 frames per second.\nA web search indicates that the iPhone 4 uses an Omnivision OV5650 sensor. According to Omnivision's own product sheet for that sensor, it's limited to 720p video, so it's not just a software thing. I couldn't find any specifics about the sensor in the new iPod touch, but it's almost certainly a different one if it records 1080p.\n", "Q: If I erase and sync my iTunes library on my iPhone will I also lose my pictures that are on iCloud?

I still have 190 photos on my camera roll and about another 500 photos on iCloud.\nI want to add new music to my iPhone, and was able to transfer the existing music to my new computer, but I’m having trouble transferring the photos from the iCloud albums to my new computer. I have Windows XP on my current computer so I can’t download the iCloud control panel and use that.\nIf I erase and sync my iTunes library, with my new library will I still have those 500 photos that are in my iCloud albums?\n\nA: The photos won't be deleted from iCloud, as re-syncing your device won't delete, nor reset the Photo Stream. \nPhotos are deleted from the Photo Stream just by selecting the one you want to get rid of and taping the trash can icon, on iOS, or clicking Delete on the computer. There is, too, a Reset Photo Stream button in you account at iCloud.com.\nJust keep in mind that photos are stored in iCloud for 30 days.\n", "Q: Apple hardware connectivity What licenses are required to connect and communicate over a non-Apple hardware to and from iPad/iPhone?\nI have non-apple hardware which I want to connect to iPad and communicate with it by writing a program.\nHence I want to know all steps to be able to do that and how much will it cost.\n\nA: You may need to join the Apple MFi Program, however this does require you to be a registered company that can pass a credit check.\n\nWho should apply to the MFi Program?\nDevelopers who wish to develop electronic accessories for iPhone, iPad\nor iPod using licensed components and/or software should join the MFi\nProgram. Companies, organizations, government entities and educational\ninstitutions are eligible to apply.\nCase developers, app developers\nand developers of accessories that only use standard technology (e.g.,\nBluetooth Low Energy or standard Bluetooth profiles) do not need to\njoin the MFi Program.\n\nIf you just connect your device via Bluetooth then you do not need to join the MFI program.\nAll you will need to do in this instance is join the Apple Developer program for iOS devices, the cost for this is $99 a year.\nTo be able to develop the iOS app to communicate with your device, you will need an Apple Mac capable of running Xcode and costs will vary.\n", "Q: Why sh -c 'echo -n 1' is different from bash -c 'echo -n 1' I am on a Mac Book Air, OSX 10.8.\nI am trying to understand why these two snippets do not print the same output.\nsh -c 'echo -n 1' outputs -n 1 whereas\nbash -c 'echo -n 1' outputs 1 as expected.\nCould you help me explaining why and how to make them output the same (if at all possible)?\n\nA: Because apparently Mac OS is one of the systems which responds to the xpg_echo option when run in POSIX mode. Running bash as /bin/sh is equivalent to running with either --posix or setting POSIXLY_CORRECT.\nThe solution is to stop using echo except in cases where there can be no ambiguity. printf is the portable replacement. Never use option flags to echo, (and use printf if you do).\nThere are multiple incompatible historical implementations of echo which break its specification in a way that can't be fixed, and the option flags are therefore non-portable. I'm not aware of anything that currently implements POSIX echo correctly.\nshopt -u xpg_echo should modify this behavior. Also as you've already discovered, not running in POSIX mode.\nAlso you might want to upgrade... bash 3 is getting a little crusty. Many bugs have been fixed since.\n\nA: /bin/sh is actually a version of bash that starts up in POSIX mode (bash --posix) and also has some other changes. Another difference is that it interprets escape sequences by default:\n$ bash -c \"echo 'a\\ba'\"\na\\ba\n$ sh -c \"echo 'a\\ba'\"\na\n$ sh -c \"shopt -u xpg_echo; echo 'a\\ba'\"\na\\ba\n$ bash --posix -c \"echo 'a\\ba'\"\na\\ba\n\nprintf %s would work the same way in most environments.\nYou could also just write scripts for bash. OS X's sh doesn't prevent you from using Bashisms that might not work with the /bin/sh on other platforms, like dash on Ubuntu.\nSee also this question and the section about echo on this website.\n", "Q: Key re-mapping or how get HEX for button i have new macbook air  13\".

And if so, will I be able to re-download the Office file from Amazon Software Library? And, would this reinstallation solve my problem of not having the computer's Administrator Password?\n\nA: I the first place, there are ways of resetting the Administrator's Password. \nAnswering your questions, yes, you can reinstall the computer without this password. Just follow Apple's instructions. \nAnd, yes, you'll be able to re-download the software from Amazon, as stated in its Help Page:\n\nYou can download an unlimited number of times for personal use. To re-download, go to Your Games and Software Library through the \"Your Digital Items\" link at the top of the screen and click the download button.\n\nAnd, again, yes, making a clean installation will make a new Administrator user, with a new password which will be chosen by you.\nNote: Both of the links regarding OS X reference Lion, as you never stated which version of OS X you are using.

Verify the settings for account “gmail” or try again.\nThe server returned the error: The server “imap.gmail.com” cannot be\n  contacted on port 995.\n\n...And the following for Hotmail account:\n\nUnable to receive mail. There may be a problem with the mail server or\n  network. Verify the settings for account “Hotmail” or try again.\nThe server returned the error: The server “pop3.live.com” cannot be contacted on port > 995.\n\nI've tried sending mail and it shows that both gmail and hotmail are both offline.\nI have been on multiple forums with this problem and it seems the whole world is having the same problem with no fix. \nI've already tried the following to no avail:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've checked all my info is entered correctly.\n\n*Changing the 'incoming mail server' to IMAP.googlemail.com - this got rid of the warning sign but still, will not send or receive mail. The warning sign has now changed to a 'zig zag' sign next to gmail.\n\n*Changing the port number from 995 to 993.\n\n*Re-entering my password.\n\n*Deleting the accounts and re-adding them.\nNothing works. Please does anyone have a REAL fix for this?\n* Cant add this comment for some reason? But here we go:\nHi there,thank you for your fast responses. I have tried restarting my router and mail.app to no avail. Apologies - an error in my copy/pasting, the port for IMAP is 993. I just tried your terminal command and got the following:   imap.gmail.com: nodename nor servname provided, or not known. I just tried adding my gmail acc. on my sisters iPhone 5 and got the following: Unable to connect to SSL, would you like to try and connect without SSL? (Yes) and got this: The IMAP server 'imap.gmail.com'is not responding. Check your network connection and that you entered the correct information in the 'incoming mail server' field. Im sorry, I dont know what a VPN is.\nAlso, All of a sudden BOTH accounts just came back online and updated with new mails etc. I've 'essentially' not changed anything. I reset the app and the router well over 20 minutes ago prior to this. You'd think changes would be instant if that was the fix?\n\nA: I went into my network settings and added google's primary dns to the list. The address is 8.8.8.8 and it resolved my issue right away. \nMy home router was pulling something odd from my ISP, but everything else was still working. Adding Google's dns resolved it instantly!\n\nA: The canonical fix for troubleshooting Mail on OS X is to run the Connection Doctor (it's slightly buried in the Window menu without a keyboard shortcut to summon it) to isolate whether you have a general network error condition or a specific error on one or more of the accounts.\nEach mail account will typically have two servers - different internet ports and potentially different username / password / authentication details.\nOnce you can isolate a specific error message on a specific port to a specific IP address, you can begin to troubleshoot whether you have a configuration issue, a network reachability issue or a server issue.\nThe show detail button is helpful to log the exact transactions and communications between Mail and the server.\nIf you have a vexing problem, I have found that disconnecting the network connection and quitting Mail (or forcing a reboot while the network is off) will let you start Mail and disable all Mail accounts except for one and also check for a stuck message or two in the Outbox. File those away as drafts so that you can then run connection doctor, re-enable the network and systematically work on the communication needed between the Mail program and your mail server.\n\nA: I have the same issue, i have checked all the settings, and set the ssl to 993 as supposed to. \nhowever when you are in the main client and you click on take accounts online inside mail, next to your account, you get a drop down menu that states. \nThere may be a problem with the mail server or network. Verify the settings for account “support@rankmelocally.com” or try again.\nThe server returned the error: The server “server.yourwebhostingworld.com” cannot be contacted on port 143.\nNotice that the port 143 comes up, my port is set to the correct 993 so there seems to be an issue or bug here.  \nguess will have to wait until its fixed, until then you can use unsecured only. \n\nA: I've had this issue since upgrading to 10.8.4 and read the other day on the Apple site that more than likely what had happened was the draft messages were being stored on the remote server and a message with a stored draft had been already sent, but the server cache with the draft had not been updated… this was in regard to 10.5 so I figured that this issue must have been resolved by now. It didn't make any sense to me to begin with, but I fixed it by doing the following…\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Mail → Preferences → Accounts → Mailbox Behaviors\n\n*Untick the Drafts setting to 'Store draft messages on the server'\n\n\n\nAlso just for my own preference, I unticked the Junk setting to 'Store junk messages on the server.'\nWhen I restarted Mail I was able to connect for the first time in about 3 days and all of my new e-mails were downloaded.\nThe connection doctor testing did nothing for me.\nUpdate\nAfter a time this no longer worked either and I went back to using Thunderbird. I largely suspect (in my instance) the issue is that I'm running my own local DNS server and mDNSResponder keeps hanging when choosing between the OpenDNS servers for the web and the local DNS server for local files. When the order of preference for the DNS servers change, the Mail app can't find my mail servers so it crashes until I restart mDNSResponder. Thunderbird doesn't exhibit this behavior in my case.\n\nA: Found this via a Google search and wanted come back and share what fixed it for me. \nFirst a couple quirks I noticed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Did all the usual DNS resets and tweaks on my router and on the laptop...no luck\n\n*Not only was Mail not working, but a security app I had (Witness) was not connecting\n\n*Checked the logs and was seeing the following: DNSServiceGetAddrInfo() failed, error = -65563\n\n*Don't know why but Thunderbird worked fine\n\n\nDid a PRAM reset link and bam everything worked.\n", "Q: Recovering lost text messages on iPhone I have just realized that a sync is not a backup. I synced my phone days ago, but backed it up months ago.\nIs there anyway to get my synced text message history back?  \nThere was some really important info on there.\n\nA: I don't know if this Data recovery for iTunes is what you are looking for but you could give it a try! You could also try Dr.Fone\n\nA: Similar to Stephen, I don't know if this app can handle data recovery - i.e. if the phone has been zapped, but it's fantastic at offloading messages, voice and text, and any other data.

Is there really noticeable reduction of noise from fans in new MBP Pro 15\" Retina compared to original MBP Pro 15\"? I'm curious if the asymmetrical blades configuration of fans really makes that significant difference which Apple is stating.\n\nA: I have one, and it make a big difference. It's also a less unpleasant sound. I have to get the machine running pretty hot before I notice the fans at all. On my last machine, I would hear the fans all the time (granted, mine was a 13'', but several of my coworkers have 15'' and I hear their fans more than mine).\n\nA: They're in the new MacBook Air aswell\n", "Q: I repartitioned my harddrive while installing Windows 8 and lost my OS X installation, can I get it back? I tried to install Windows 8 on my MacBook using Boot Camp. Because the normal installer did not recognize the partition that was made by Boot Camp, I opened up the command promt and ran DISKPART. I selected my drive, selected my partition and entered CLEAN – and boom, my entire hard drive shows up as being totally empty. I do have a 1 week old backup and rolling back to it would not be too terrible, but I wonder: is there a way to restore my files?\n\nA: Repartitioning a disk like that is, unfortunately, a fatal operation for the data on it. There's an outside chance you may be able to take advantage of a data recovery service to extract some of the data from the drive but this is an expensive way to go.\nGood thing you have that backup.\nAs a general rule, before I do anything on my machines at the OS level (upgrade, reinstall, cross-grade, etc.) I take a snapshot of my drive using Carbon Copy Cloner and I test to make sure I can boot the Mac from that copied drive. Once I've confirmed the clone is stable, I proceed with the work on the main drive. If I goes wrong, I just clone the external drive back to my main drive and it's like I never messed it up in the first place.\n\nA: Ok, I managed to fix it myself! What I did was:\n\n\n*\n\n*Put TestDisk on a USB Stick\n\n*Boot into Single User Mode (by holding down CMD-S). This worked because I have two hard drives, a SSD and an old HD, and the System on the SSD still worked\n\n*Run TestDisk on the damaged volumne\n\n\nA: Two products I'd try:\n\n\n*\n\n*DiskWarrior\n\n*Data Rescue\nI'd start with Data Rescue since it doesn't touch the drive and specializes in recovering files. If you already have a backup and don't mind trying to recreate a new directory listing, Disk Warrior would be your first stop.\nBoth have excellent phone and web support, have been around for years and years and offer clear demos of the product if you are hesitant to spend $$ initially.\nDisk Warrior can make things worse if you let it write changes to the drive, so be sure you're sure you don't need to recover files or have a verified backup before clicking the \"change data\" button once the tool has previewed what it intends to do for you with your recovered data.\n", "Q: Emacsify OSX throughout: word-forward (⌥ + F) and word-backward (⌥ + B) instead of 'special characters'? Yes, the OSX already supports ⌥+← and ⌥+→ for moving the cursor word-backward and word-forward, but reaching for arrow keys is annoying. So, why not rather have ⌥+B and ⌥+F do this? I mean, not once have I (intentionally) wrote the integral sign ∫ with ⌥+B (apart from now). \nIn short, I'd rather have Emacs-like behavior (not just, say, ^+F for character-forward) throughout the OSX.\n\nRelated question: Stop using Mac keyboard Option as a modifier to character\n\nA: DefaultKeyBinding.dict\nCreate ~/Library/KeyBindings/ and save a property list like this as ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict:\n{\n  \"^ \" = setMark:;\n  \"^/\" = undo:;\n  \"^l\" = selectParagraph:;\n  \"^u\" = deleteToBeginningOfParagraph:;\n  \"^w\" = deleteToMark:;\n  \"^x\" = {\n    \"^x\" = swapWithMark:;\n    \"^m\" = selectToMark:;\n  };\n  \"^V\" = pageDownAndModifySelection:;\n  \"~@\" = selectWord:;\n  \"~b\" = moveWordBackward:;\n  \"~c\" = (capitalizeWord:, moveForward:, moveForward:);\n  \"~d\" = deleteWordForward:;\n  \"~f\" = moveWordForward:;\n  \"~l\" = (lowercaseWord:, moveForward:, moveForward:);\n  \"~r\" = centerSelectionInVisibleArea:;\n  \"~u\" = (uppercaseWord:, moveForward:, moveForward:);\n  \"~v\" = pageUp:;\n  \"~w\" = (deleteToMark:, setMark:, yank:, swapWithMark:);\n  \"~B\" = moveWordForwardAndModifySelection:;\n  \"~F\" = moveWordForwardAndModifySelection:;\n  \"~V\" = pageUpAndModifySelection:;\n}\n\nDefaultKeyBinding.dict doesn't work in some applications like Xcode or Firefox.

How can I play music that resides my computer on my iPhone (plugged in to my stereo)? I am at home, they are on the same wifi network. The computer runs Windows 7.\nI tried iTunes's sharing feature and my computer's \"library\" was listed on the phone, but  when I select it, the symbol spins for a minute then gives up. Once it did work, but it only listed about a hundred songs (of tens of thousands). I don't know why.\nI'd like to choose the music from the iPhone.\nEdit: I have much more music than disk space on my iPhone, so I can't copy it all.\n\nA: You want a DNLA streaming app for your iPhone, which can play a music library via a DLNA server running on your PC.\nFor the PC side, google \"windows DLNA server\" will get you current choices, but at this time there are Plex, Tversity, and Twonky\nOn the iPhone side, look at apps like Media:connect. There are summaries of current choices online, like this one: http://blog.dreamcss.com/iphone/dlna-streaming-apps-for-iphone/\n\nA: I can't offer you another option, but I have run into the sharing issue as well. Occasionally my iPhone will connect very slowly and not show my entire library. \nThe fix that has always worked for me, is to remove and then reset the home sharing Apple ID from the iPhone Music settings. This seems to reset everything to how it should be and has solved my issue in the past.\n\nA: I never thought to do this because I have an iPod that I generally use for music but it sounds interesting. I might try this app when I get home.\nhttp://wifi2hifi.cleverandson.com/\nIt's 3.99 but it supposedly works well, you need to download something on your computer for it to work; it looks like it only supports up to 10.6 but maybe you can find more information about that; it's likely compatible with newer versions. Also, the reviews said there is a few seconds of lag but as long as you don't have the sound on your computer or watching video it shouldn't be a problem. \nYou could also upload your music to music.google.com and stream that way. I haven't used it in a while though so I don't know how well it works anymore. At the time there was no app for it either so you had to do it through your phone's browser. \n\nA: Check out Subsonic. It's free and can stream to almost any device with a web browser. There's also and native iPhone client (and native clients for several other platforms). It can stream a stand alone music library or an existing iTunes library.\nIt's pretty easy to setup. Basically just run the installer and point it to your music folder.\nI've been using it for a few years and it works great.\n\nA: I'm surprised no one has suggested the Plex Media Server.   Basically you have the Plex Media Server running on your PC (either Mac, Windows, Linux) and can play media from your iPhone with their iPhone/iPad app.   \nYou can even set it up so you can play music/watch videos when you are not at home.  They will stream from your home PC.\nTake a look at http://www.plexapp.com/\n\nA: Have a look at Tonido. It does a lot more than music streaming, but it looks like it would fill your desired role well. You run a server component on your computer, and there's an iOS app for playback. If you want you can even access your music collection when you're not on your home network.\n\nA: You could also try StreamToMe (iOS & Mac App) and ServeToMe (Windows & Mac). I do believe it works over the internet as well, but am not sure as I haven't used it in quite a while. It allows you to Play Music, Videos and Photos.\n\nA: You can try WiFi2HiFi , works great..\nJust download the app onto your iPhone and PC or Mac .\nOn Itunes : https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wifi2hifi/id417409424\nMac or PC : http://www.wifi2hifi.com/\nWell Apple also has a solution , Airport Express but costs 99 $ .\n", "Q: Why is my MacBook Pro stuck on mute? I cannot hear any audio from my MacBook Pro, running OS X 10.7. Pressing F10/F11/F12 shows the volume overlay, but it stays at max volume with a (/) icon below it. In the Sound control panel or from the sound icon in the menu bar I can adjust the volume, but the Mute checkbox is greyed out. Rebooting does not resolve the problem.\n\nA: I had same problem, but none of these suggestions helped.\nI was almost desperate, since I found this interesting article: How to reset the audio system in OS X\nSo I begun to follow the steps suggested into the article. But I had to do a little more in order to restore audio capability. Here the steps I did:\n$ ps -ef | grep audio\n202   376     1   0 10:01AM ??         0:00.86 /usr/sbin/coreaudiod\n202   379     1   0 10:01AM ??         0:00.04 com.apple.audio.DriverHelper\n501   475     1   0 10:01AM ??         0:00.02 com.apple.audio.SandboxHelper\n501   528   504   0 10:02AM ttys000    0:00.00 grep audio\n\n$ sudo killall audio.DriverHelper\n$ sudo killall audio.SandboxHelper\n$ sudo killall coreaudiod\n\nthen open \"Audio MIDI Setup\" utility.\nAnd then toggling settings such as these can reinitialize the audio driver.\n\nMaybe this procedure will rewrite the audio configuration \n\nA: What I did was keep my headphone jack plugged in while turning up the volume (F12). Then, while I was turning up the volume I pulled out the headphone jack. This fixed it.\nIt almost seems as if I tricked it. I read a few other posts where you do this in the volume audio panel but those solutions did not work for me.\n\nA: The same thing happened to me but I found a solution and it should work. It's an easy solution so read carefully.\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off your MacBook. \n\n*When you turn on your MacBook a grey apple appears on the screen - before that grey apple appears press these keyboard buttons \nCommand + Option + P + R (hold the keys at the same time).\n\n*Hold they keys until you hear the sound you usually hear when you turn on your MacBook the second time.\nThe MacBook should be fixed.\n\nA: The headphone jack had a red LED glowing inside, which clued me in that it thought there was an optical cable plugged in. Plugging and unplugging a pair of headphones resolved the problem.\n\nA: I have experience with the same issue and think it's Apple fault in how OS X handles the dual function of its audio output. My solution was to install Ubuntu, it doesn't mute it anymore.\nSince using Ubuntu 13.04 now on my macbook pro early 2011, it never suffers from the infamous headphone jack problem. Removing the headphones, the internal speakers work, plug it in, the headphone works.\nHere're some articles that explain what's up with the headphone jack, and the root cause of this behavior:\n\n\n*\n\n*Continuing issues (and solutions) for the MBP's silent speaker problem - 4/2012\n\n*Getting Sound Back on a Macbook Pro (when the headphone is stuck on Optical) - 8/2012\n\n*Apple's finicky headphone jacks frustrate MacBook owners - 2/2009\nOn OS X, it just doesn't work. If I dare plugging in the headphones, I know that when I take it out, internal speakers will stop working, they will be muted, and not come back after a while. I've stopped plugging stuff in and out trying to make it work.\nI just installed a new OS that works. I suspect Ubuntu, maybe, just ignores all the stuff about the dual mode of the headphone jack.\n", "Q: Mountain Lion 10.8.2, Java Preferences has disappeared I just installed the latest Java update from apple (Java for OS X 2012-006) and I was looking to have a look at what's going on with my java(s) with Java Preferences app (which used to live in /Applications/Utilities though it seems it has now disappeared.

I've already reset the SMC but it didn't work.\nI have 8GB RAM and 4GB is always free.\nHow can I fix this problem?\n\nA: You will need to figure out what is causing a processing bottleneck on the Mac.\nYou'll need some understudying of basics like being able to tell if the virtual memory system is swapping (vm_stat 5 will show paging when you reproduce the issue) as well as Activity Monitor to see what the overall RAM and disk IO are as well as look for processes that are not responding or taking a lot of CPU time.\nThe fact that a reboot cures things shows that it's not a hardware issue or a software conflict, but instead a resource issue. Experience in doing this leads me to guess you either have some apps that have memory leaks and once the system starts swapping, you have enough CPU busy things that on occasion that slows the GPU / graphics subsystem.\nYou could also try quitting all apps when you notice the slowness and then just starting one or two apps to see if that resolves things. It seems odd that you always have 4 GB free, since I would expect you to reach a state over time where almost all the \"free\" memory converts to inactive to cache things that were used, but now out of active memory use.\n\nHopefully this process helps you find the culprit since there isn't enough detail to guess what's really happening. Good luck hunting this down.\n", "Q: Hide application menu bar How can I hide the Menu Bar? I am on mac Osx moutain Lion (10.8)\nYes, one can full-screen an app, but it does not solve my problem. Here are 2 scenarios to explain my problem:\nScenario 1:\nI am running macvim in one space and Chrome in another. Chrome by default 'merges' it window top bar with the tabs, but macvim does not. So, on my macvim I can see both the menu bar and the window's top bar. While chrome's window is indeed useful (It contains tabs..), macvim's top bar is useless. All the info is in the powerline I'm using.\nScenario 2:\nI have 2 displays, full-screen apps appear only on one screen and there is no way to have another app on the other screen (Unless if I missed that!). So I'd rather have, again, macvim on the first big display and chrome on the small one.  But then again, macvim's window topbar is here, taking useless space. \n\nI hope I made the point clearer!\n\nA: You can make the menu bar of an application hide automatically by adding this to the Info.plist:\n<key>LSUIPresentationMode</key>\n<integer>4</integer>\n\nWindows can't be moved over the freed up space though.\nIf the application is signed, modifying the Info.plist invalidates the code signature. It also makes sandboxed applications like TextEdit and Chess crash on launch.\n\nA: try switching macvim using keyboard shortcut (command+shift+F) instead of using the double arrow button on upper right corner of the macvim window. \n", "Q: Dictation not working in OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion I have enabled dictation in the preferences, but it fails to start.\nWhen I tap fn fn, the Icon with three dots appears, and quickly disappears.

What is the best way to monitor the bandwidth usage (preferably per device) that passes through my Airport Extreme router?\nThanks!\nRob \n\nA: The Airport Express/Extreme allows monitoring via SNMP if you enable it via the Airport Configuration Utility (version 5.6 ONLY).\nApple removed advanced configuration parameters from Airport Configuration Utility 6.0. Please download a version 5.6 of the utility from Apple’s support page to get a full access to all configuration parameters of your router. SNMP configuration is located under Advanced settings.\nFrom there, ANY snmp polling engine can get traffic as a whole.\nYou would be hard-pressed to find anything that could differenciate traffic between devices that isn't a real router (Cisco, etc) or custom built Linux box.\nI just found this during a quick serach: NetUseApp via iTunes Store allows you to monitor any SNMP device with a pretty interface.\n", "Q: How to find out frame rate (FPS) of an AVI video on OS X?

In iOS 6 on login (or opening any game) it says, \"Could not connect to Game Center server.\" In OS X Mountain Lion on login, it says, \"The data couldn’t be read because it has been corrupted.\"\nI've tried some steps to fix that were suggested in Apple's Support Discussions without success. These include rebuilding permissions, resetting PRAM, restoring the /etc/hosts file to its default state, and in OS X, logging in using Chess instead of Game Center.\nThat this is happening on both of my devices (MacBook Pro and iPhone 4S) makes me think the 'corruption' is occurring on Apple end, in the cloud. I'm wondering if anyone has experienced this issue and conquered it, or if Apple Support can do anything to restore this functionality on their end at a customer's request.\n\nA: I'm thinking that the server just must be down.

I cannot access www.lubuntu.net from my Macbook Pro running OS X 10.6.8. I have an idea as to what the problem is (see my opinion), but I did all the usual things anyway (see basic troubleshooting), just to check.\nBasic Troubleshooting\nI can access almost any other site from my macbook (for example this one). I can access lubuntu.net from my other laptop which is on the same wifi, meaning it's not a network, ISP, or router issue. Also the site is up, and this issue is persistent for several days.\nI can successfully ping the site. The site resolves to an IP (thus not a DNS issue). The problem occurs using three different browsers - Chrome, Firefox, Safari. I never use Safari, so it's not an extension issue, either. I cannot access the site even if I paste its IP into the address bar.\nMy IP is likely not banned, since (1) there is no reason to ban me and (2) my other laptop is able to access the site over the same network, going through the same router.\nRebooting does not solve the issue.\nMy Opinion\nI installed (and quickly uninstalled) a program called PeerGuardian, which blocks \"suspicious\" IPs. It is mainly used for blocking unwanted peers when downloading torrents. I think that it messed with one of the config files to block the Lubuntu site.\nWhich files should I check? I've taken a look at /etc/hosts, and that looks fine. Also /etc/resolv.conf looks normal. No idea where to go from here.\nEDIT: Here are the contents of system.log for my most recent attempt:\n\nOct 18 21:44:11 albatross com.avast.proxy[50]: Error reading receive buffer: read(): Connection reset by peer\nOct 18 21:45:20 albatross com.avast.proxy[50]: Defective HTTP request!\nOct 18 21:45:20 albatross com.avast.proxy[50]: Unexpected AV CHECKURL response code (501)!\nOct 18 21:46:24 albatross [0x0-0x165165].com.avast.AAFM[2093]: 18 Oct 21:46:24 ntpdate[2133]: no servers can be used, exiting\nOct 18 21:46:27 albatross avast![2093]: event_master_disconnected\nOct 18 21:46:38 albatross com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[322] (com.avast.helper): Throttling respawn: Will start in 5 seconds\nOct 18 21:46:45 albatross com.avast.proxy[50]: Error reading receive buffer: read(): Connection reset by peer\n\nDo you think this is a problem caused by Avast?

The KEXT is used to block connections to \"dangerous\" servers specified in so-called blocklists.\n\n*Find out whether the KEXT was the culprit.\nThe original poster booted his Mac into Safe Mode by pressing Shift during startup (http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1533). \nSafe Mode does a lot of things (http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1564), among them it loads only required kernel extensions, so PeerGuardian's KEXT wouldn't be loaded. \nThe original poster could successfully connect to www.lubuntu.net, so the KEXT was the offender.\n\n*Disable the KEXT.\nThe first try was to move the KEXT from /Library/Application Support/PeerGuardian to /tmp and reboot. That didn't help. The original poster then deleted the KEXT. I also asked him to check in System Preferences>Users & Groups>Login Items whether PeerGuardian was listed and remove it. \nAfter a reboot he could sucessfully connect to www.lubuntu.net.\nSo the bottom line is that, unfortunately, some programs cannot be uninstalled by simply dragging them to the Trash.\n\nA: I was also recently trying to fix the same issue and it came down to PeerGuardian. I just altered the settings but didn't remove it, but found this article about a program called AppDelete that mentioned PeerGuardian and a number of its files that it would leave behind if you simply removed from the Applications folder:\nhttp://dailyblogged.com/2506/appdelete-uninstall-anything-seriously/\nMaybe this can help you track down any remaining files that are causing issues with your machine.\n", "Q: AppleTV 3 on a LAN network (no internet) with a PPC Mac and iPhone I have had a few different things told to me on this situation. I have a wifi local area network set-up with  NO Internet connection.  I want to know if AppleTV will\n\n\n*\n\n*work at all with a PPC Mac \n\n*mirror my iPhone ie AirPlay \n\n*work at all without Internet (again Mac and iPhone on wifi LAN).\n\n\nI do connect to my Mac from iPhone 4S for a number of things now , and sync via USB (although I've heard that's not possible). \n\nA: The iPhone and the AppleTV should work just fine together (with or without internet).   Note that some router models do not work well together with AirPlay so if you encounter transmission problems this should be the first suspect.\nRegarding your Mac I believe that the latest iTunes for OS X 10.5 can do AirPlay. If you run an older version of OS X you should consider the most appropriate upgrade path.  It might give a better experience to buy a new mac instead of upgrading to OS X 10.5\n\nA: Airplay will work fine, but it will NOT stream movies from your computer without an active internet connection.\nA lot of people assume that it should work fine, but trust me, it doesn't. Everything from \"Home Sharing\" is going through your Apple ID, so without an internet connection, you can see your movies but not play them.\n\"Home Sharing requires a home network with an active Internet connection.\"\nSources: Experience / Apple support kb - http://support.apple.com/kb/ts2972\n\nA: I concur with Nick.   If you want to stream movies from iTunes on your computer, they MUST share a single iTunes account and both the computer and the ATV will need to validate that iTunes account by both independently accessing Apples authentication servers.  Thus they BOTH must have internet access.  BTW, both the ATV and the iTunes / computer will re-validate the iTunes accounts on a regular basis.  This means that they must not only have internet access upon initial setup but also maintain Internet access indefinitely.\n\nA: 1) ATV requires iTunes, if you want to get content from your Mac.  Your rev of iTunes on a PPC Mac might be too old.  What rev do you have?\n2) Airplay should work fine\n3) Should work too.  Perhaps someone would be willing to unplug their Internet for a few minutes to simulate that for you!\n\nA: One thing you want to take note is that Apple TV requires Activation like any other iOS device. And that requires a one-time working Internet connection.\nYou can of course do that with any other's network connection, even with the one in Apple Retail Store.\nFor the features you request, that's take a look.\nQuestion A. Will it work at all with a PPC Mac?\nSo the answer is it will. But I am concerned with the version that you have on your PPC Mac. AirTunes (now called AirPlay) has been built in to iTunes for like forever, so that shouldn't concern me. You can use AirPlay to stream at least audio to Apple TV. (Videos are added after iTunes 10 as I believe, but I am not sure if PPC Macs do that) \nAs I believe, \"iTunes Home Sharing\" exists on iTunes 10, so if you can run it, and find the option \"Home Sharing\" under iTunes's \"Advanced\" menu, you can browse your iTunes library on your Apple TV. BUT, activating Home Sharing, again for the first time requires you to authorize your Mac and Apple TV to use your iTunes account. Again, a one-time thing. (Home Sharing is added before/in iTunes 10, but again, I am not sure if PPC Macs have that)\nQuestion B. Will it mirror my iPhone via AirPlay?\nYes, it will. AirPlay mirroring requires a working LAN connection only, no iTunes account authorization or stuff. \nQuestion C. Will it work at all without Internet?\nSo, as I have answered the last two question, the answer is obvious, it will.\n", "Q: Is is possible to add tag, notes or labels to backups made by Time Machine? Is it possible to add label, tag or notes to Time Machine backups. Lets say after fresh reinstall of OS X - label it as \"Base System 1\" then after few days (at some point with more software/work) \"Designer Workstation - Base System 2\" etc. \nSo, in case if system needs to be restored to a known good state (because of crash or otherwise). It would be easy to look at tag/notes and decide which one to restore. Than to just look at date-time stamps.\nI know full bootable clones are the way to go. In addition to one bootable clone, it will be great to have multiple tagged restore points in Time Machine.\nIs there a way to achieve this?\n\nA: No, it's not possible to tag any specific revision in TimeMachine.\n\nA: In brief - tag a file on your filesystem and let Time Machine store the tagged file. You could also decide to keep a text file anywhere on the backup and adding tags / labels / narrative to that file. Someone could program a UI for this and present the history of Time Machine backups quite easily since everything is stored in a native filesystem storage view. I haven't seen any program that does tagging, but you might look at BackupLoupe for browsing your backups.\nIf you had a general purpose tagging system using spotlight - that also would work for searching since spotlight also indexes Time Machine backups:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tag any file in OS X using spotlight and a marker character\n\n*Tag files using finder and metadata fields\n\n*Many third party apps exist to add tagging to the filesystem - search the app store for \"file tagging\" if the previous links are not helpful for you.\n\n\nIn practice, I can usually figure out which backup I need by looking at the contents of a backup and checking the modified date of a specific App or system file to correspond with a specific update or install. I do see how for some, having a place to write detailed notes to evernote or a text file or elsewhere would be useful in parsing a Time Machine store - especially if your store isn't full or long enough where Time Machine starts deleting older backups to reclaim space for newer versions of files.\n\nA: Yes，I find a sample way to do that, just use the command line add a Readme.txt on the backup disk. My backup disk mount path is \"/Volumes/TimeHub\", Example command like this:\nsudo touch /Volumes/TimeHub/Readme.txt\n\nInput your password\nsudo vi /Volumes/TimeHub/Readme.txt\n\nInput your password againt, then, you can write down any info by vi, sample and easy.\n", "Q: How large is iOS? Inspired by this\n\nI am Ricardo Lopez, Test Manager for Surface RT. After the OS,\n  OfficeRT and a bunch of apps, you will still have more that 20GB. As\n  you say, you can always add an SD card and while you cannot add apps\n  there, you can get music, movies and photos there.\n\nThat Reddit comment is referring to the 32GB Microsoft Surface RT. Assuming everything, that means that Windows RT, OfficeRT, and a few small apps, the \"light\" version of Windows 8 requires around 12GB.\nDoes anyone have any data as to how iOS compares? How much space does iOS require? \nI know that it does not cut into the storage allocated for the user (i.e. a 16GB iPhone will offer almost that much to the user). Data on iOS 6 is preferred.\n\nA: The exact answer will vary by device, because there are separate iOS builds for each one. The easiest way to figure this out is to examine an iOS 6 install image (a .ipsw file).\nThe iPad 3 (Wi-Fi only) is the iOS device that is most similar to a Microsoft Surface, although the two are still very different. The iOS 6.0 (build 10A403) install image weighs in at around 1.15 GB.\nThe IPSW file itself is actually a zip file that contains several files, but most of them are fairly small. The root filesystem disk image, which contains the entire installed OS, weighs in at around 1.12 GB in this case.\nSomeone with a jailbroken device could decrypt the image and provide a more exact answer, that's a pretty good estimate of the amount of space it will consume on the device when installed.\n\nA: A quick survey of friends a while back has shown that you can expect the following amounts of usable space on an iPhone 5 with iOS 6:\n\n\n*\n\n*13.70 GB of space on the 16 GB model\n\n*28.00 GB of space on the 32 GB model\n\n*57.20 GB of space on the 64 GB model\n\n\nThe builds for iPad and iPod touch are different than each iPhone build, but the space taken by iOS when installed and overhead is in the 2.5 GB range across devices and storage configurations. The upgrade to iOS 7 left 27.94 GB of capacity according to iTunes when the device is connected.\nThe same iPhone 5 on iOS 8:\n\n\n*\n\n*?? GB of space on the 16 GB model\n\n*27.35 GB of space on the 32 GB model\n\n*?? GB of space on the 64 GB model\n\n\nA: The iOS 6 .ipsw file, used to restore it, is around 1GB, depending of the device. When installing through the iPhone itself, though, it asks for at least 2 GB of space. \n\nIt's fair to presume, then, that the required space is between 1 and 2 GB.\n", "Q: exclude certain mailaccounts from sound notifications In iOS6, on iPhone 5, how can I disable sound and vibration for a specific mail account only? I have one mail accounts that is a bit to highly frequented, which results in a lot of ringing and vibration. However all the other mail accounts behave just fine. \nUnfortunately I only see one global setting for the whole mail app.\n\nA: You should be able to accomplish this from the Notifications section of the Settings app, which allows you to set the kind of alerts each app uses:\n \nIn that panel, each of your mail accounts will be listed separately, and can be configured individually. I have one account, for example, set to not even badge the Mail.app icon, let alone play sound:\n \n", "Q: How to batch rename images, in reverse numerical order? My camera names its images IMG_0001.jpg, IMG_0002.jpg, IMG_0003.jpg, etc.\nI have about a thousand images and would like to rename them without having to do it manually if possible. \nIs there a good way to automate the process of renaming them in the reverse order - e.g. IMG_0003.jpg, IMG_0002.jpg, IMG_0001.jpg? \n\nA: Here's another shell script. You can save it as a normal text file and then run bash /path/to/script.sh from Terminal. Remove the echo to actually rename the files.\ncd ~/Pictures/\nIFS=$'\\n' # the input field separators include space by default\ni=1\nfor f in $(ls -r IMG*.jpg); do \n    echo mv \"$f\" \"IMG_$(printf %04d $i)\".jpg\n    (( i++ ))\ndone\n\n\nA: Try this in the Terminal:\nmkdir new\nls IMG* > 1\nsort -r < 1 > 2\npaste 1 2 | awk '{ print \"mv \" $1 \" new/\" $2} ' > 3\n. 3\n\nThe renamed files will be in the new folder.\nHere is a brief explanation of how this works: it creates a script named 3 that does the renaming. For that, it creates a listing of the images in alphabetical order in 1 and in reverse order in 2. Then one line is read from each file and combine into a mv command, which is executed when you run 3. The images are renamed into the new folder to avoid collisions.\n\nA: Name Mangler ($10 and has a free trial) or Name Changer (free/donationware) is also very good for this sort of thing if you're after a nice, simple app.\n\nA: You can use an Automator Workflow. \nSomething like this:\n\nSort Finder Items step will sort image names descending (IMG_0003.jpg, IMG_002.jpg, IMG_001.jpg). \nMake Sequential step will rename them sequentially (IMG_0001.jpg, IMG_0002.jpg, ...).\nCopy Finder Items step is optional, just to be sure not to mess with original files.\n\nA: You can use the perl rename.pl script looming around the web (for example, from here), and put it into the folder with your image files.\nIts usage is simple and documented and it is pretty powerful. To use it for your case, replace MAXIMUM_NUMBER by the number in the last photo, then run:\nperl rename.pl 's/IMG_0+(\\d+)/\"A_IMG_\".sprintf(\"%04d\",(MAXIMUM_NUMBER- $1))/xe' *.jpg && perl rename.pl 's/A_//' *.jpg\n\nTo explain:\n\n\n*\n\n*The first rename (before &&) will rename all files to MAXIMUM_NUMBER minus the number already in the file name. It will also prefix the filename with A_ in order to avoid overwriting already existing files.\n\n*The second rename simply deletes the A_ from the file names.\n\n\nNote that the rename.pl script can do much more than that if you ever need more complex renaming.\n", "Q: How can I boot my MacBook Pro from a DVD to update my SSD firmware I have a MacBook Pro 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 (mid-2011 model) running OS X 10.8.2.  I upgraded to an SSD which I bought from Crucial and works just great.  Crucial sent an email recommending I upgrade my firmware to get even better performance from my SSD. \nI downloaded the firmware to my desktop in the form of an ISO file from the Crucial website, and the instructions told me to burn this to a disk and change my boot order in order to boot from this disk.  I burned the disk but subsequently have not been able to get a bios screen or to be able to boot from the DVD I created.  I have tried holding down the C key but nothing seems to happen.  \nWhat do I need to do to complete the installation of the firmware?\n\nA: You should know there is no such this as \"BIOS\" on a Mac (the equivalent system is called EFI, but you don't boot into it to change settings). To boot from a DVD or any other external medium, you'll have to hold down the Option ⌥ key while booting.\nThen you'll get a list with all the bootable devices and there you can select the device you want to boot from. \nOr you can go to System Preferences > Startup Disk to select your disk and then reboot. Then you'll also boot from the disk.\n\nA: The guide provided by Crucial here is quite PC-hardware centric, that's why they talk about BIOS, I guess. Forget BIOS in a Mac context.\nYou say you burned a DVD. I've downloaded the ISO file from the update page, burned a CD and I couldn't boot from it either when pressing 'C' upon restart (as explained here: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1533]. The CD spun, but except for the noise nothing happened. (I own a Macbook Pro 2.2 GHZ Intel Core i7 (early 2011)).\nI've checked the ISO file, it is a Linux boot CD that I suspect is not tuned for Mac hardware. I'd say contact Crucial customer support.\n(The guide states:\n\nFirmware version 010G includes improvements which are specific for\n  Windows 8 and new UltraBook systems, although Windows 7 and other\n  operating systems and computer platforms may also see improvements.\n\nso maybe you are not missing much...)\n", "Q: System 7: How to unlock screensaver? I own a vintage \"LC II\" (a.k.a. \"Macintosh Performa 400\") with System 7.x installed years ago. Unfortunately I'm not able to log in anymore, because after the initial boot the screensaver fires up and locks the screen with a password.\nI would like to know either if:\n\n\n*\n\n*there are any key combinations or such to \"unlock\" screensaver/log in?\n\n*there are any key combinations to \"reset things\"?\n\n*there is a easy–to–follow guide to create installation floppies to re-install from scratch?\n\nA: There are a couple options.\nlhf is right -- holding down shift will disable all extensions on startup in System 7.x. If you are running OS 7.5, holding the shift key will bring up the extensions manager, allowing you to choose the extension you want to shut off.\nIf that does not work, you can boot from a disk as if you were going to install software. You can download Mac OS 7.5.3 from Apple. You technically only need the first disk to boot. Once you create the disk from the first image, boot from it by holding down command and option. \nThat should boot into a very minimal version of System 7.5 and bypass the screensaver.\n", "Q: Why can I sometimes not enter my password on my iPad?

I've also noticed that the orientation sensor doesn't work when I rotate it in this state (the lock switch is off).\nHas anyone else seen this issue? Is it a known problem? How can I fix it? So far I've fixed it by turned the iPad completely off and on, but obviously that's far from ideal.\n\nA: Just like a computer, an iPad is a software-driven device, and unresponsiveness like this is commonly the result of imperfect memory management.\nFrom my experience, the leading cause of iOS software instability is running low on application memory. This can happen after long periods of use without ever power cycling the device — days or even weeks. (How often are you needing to power cycle your device?) Even if the device works great, if it has been a while, turning it off and on is a healthy action, as it can re-allocate its full memory once again, just like restarting a computer.\nIf you aren’t noticing delayed or unresponsive behavior elsewhere, then perhaps a backup and restore would be a good thing to try, to rule out corrupt or damaged system software.\n", "Q: Subversion - Homebrew vs. Xcode command line tools I have to update Subversion on my system because I'm working with a server which is running the version 1.7 and this stops me to make commits.\nThis is the error it returns:\n$ svn commit\nsvn: The path '...' appears to be part of a Subversion 1.7 or greater working copy.  \nPlease upgrade your Subversion client to use this working copy.\n\nCurrently I'm running the version 1.6.18\n$ svn --version\nsvn, version 1.6.18 (r1303927)\n   compiled Aug  4 2012, 19:46:53\n\nCopyright (C) 2000-2009 CollabNet.\nSubversion is open source software, see http://subversion.apache.org/\nThis product includes software developed by CollabNet (http://www.Collab.Net/).\n\nI read this question in which the user asked how is it possible to install the version 1.7. They said that this is possible through MacPorts. However I'm using Homebrew as package manager.

Is that true? How can I manage it without removing the Xcode command line tools?\n\nA: No, there shouldn't be a problem having 2 different versions of Subversion installed at the same time. MacPorts and Homebrew will install their executable binaries to a different path.\nThe version which actually gets executed when executing svn in the shell depends on your $PATH environment variable, which contains a list of directories to search through, in order.\nIf your $PATH variable lists the directory where Homebrew installs binaries first (I believe this is the default configuration), svn will use the more recent version.\n", "Q: Where can I download Safari for Windows?

It will not mount in an external enclosure but disk utility is still reading that the hard drive is there, and I tried to repair disk and I am getting this error: (Disk Utility can’t repair this disk. Back up as many of your files as possible, reformat the disk, and restore your backed-up files.) So my question is how do I backup my files if the hard drive won't mount? The only way that I have been able to see the hard drive is through disk utility. I just want to be clear that I am using mac os x snow leapard.\n\nA: You could try following this hint from Macworld. It makes use of the Terminal (0$) to execute the UNIX command dd to copy everything bit-by-bit from your harddrive to another location.\n1. Determine UNIX id. of dead drive\nIf you decide to use this method you would first have to determine what the UNIX identifier of the attached disk is. Open up Terminal (Applications --> Utilities) and type the following:\n\ndiskutil list\n\nThis will give you a list of all connected drives and their partitions and it should look like shown here.\nProbably your boot drive is under /dev/disk0 and the drive in the external enclosure is under /dev/disk1. This could be different, look this up by finding the name of the dead partition in the list. Let's assume for the rest of this answer that the dead drive is under /dev/disk1\nNow if you can not find the name of the dead drive in that list, diskutil can not find your drive and the Macworld hint will not work for you. If you see it in the list, move on to the next step.\n2. Define destination\nThis method copies the whole disk byte-by-byte. If it encounters an error it will skip it and write zeros to the destination (read the hint for full details). So, the destination should have enough hard drive space to accomodate the whole hard drive you're recovering. So if you've got a 320GB hard drive, you'll need 320GB of destination space. If you have 320GB to spare on your bootdrive proceed to step 3. Otherwise get another external drive with at least 320GB of space and then proceed to step 3.\n3. Copy\nThe command given in the hint is:\n\ndd bs=512 if=/dev/rXX# of=/some_dir/foo.dmg conv=noerror,sync\n\nYou should replace /dev/rXX# with /dev/rdisk1 (according to our earlier assumption) and /some_dir/foo.dmg differs depending on your destination. If you choose your bootdrive you could change that line to: /Users/**yourusernamehere**/Desktop/recover.dmg\nIf you choose an external disk you should write /Volumes/**Volumenamehere** instead of /some_dir/foo.dmg \nTo summarise, your Terminal command would look as follows if you choose your boot drive as destination:\n\ndd bs=512 if=/dev/rdisk1 of=/Users/yourusernamehere/Desktop/recover.dmg conv=noerror,sync\n\nOr if you choose an external disk:\n\ndd bs=512 if=/dev/rdisk1 of=/Volumes/Volumenamehere conv=noerror,sync\n\nGood luck\n\nA: I would try to remove the hard disk and mount it in another PC.\nThan you can then try to use software for data recovery from a hard disk with the Journal File System. \nSome examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clever Files (OS X)\n\n*JFS Recovery Software (Win)\n\n*Geeksnerds JFS Data Recovery Software (Win)\n\n\nA: I would try to recover from possible bad sectors using the non destructive $89 Spinrite software utility from GRC.\nThat requires opening the MacBook, unplug the harddrive, move the drive to a PC and attach it to a SATA connector on the PC motherboard.\nThen start the PC using a Spinrite created bootable CD-ROM/floppy/USB stick.\nWhen Spinrite its default level 4 (data recovery) fails, start at level 1, then run the next round on level 2, 3 and finally run spinrite at level 4. \n\nA: Hard Disk Recovery or Hard Drive Recovery must be done by professional only.There are a variety of issues that can arise that can cause or lead to the malfunction of your hard drive. These problems are such that they can manifest themselves over a period of time or can happen suddenly, rendering your hard drive completely inaccessible. \n", "Q: Moving individual specific applications from Leopard to Mountain Lion I'm moving from an old 2007 MBP running Leopard OS X 10.5.8 to a new MBP running OS X 10.8.2 and I want to keep the new system as clean as possible.\nTherefore, I chose not to use the Migration Assistant. I'm wondering if it's possible to manually move specific applications by copying files from a Time Machine backup?\nIn particular I'd like to move Cinema 4D R12.5, but may also want to move other smaller applications.\nThanks for any suggestions.\n\nA: It depends, primarily on the way the application got installed initially\n\n\n*\n\n*Apps which get installed by drag&drop'ing the .app file into /Applications can just be copied to the new system. You will loose your preferences (unless you copied your ~/Library as well) but the application should work\n\n*Apps which need an installer may or may not work depending on whether the installer wrote stuff to other folders besides /Applications. Most installers probably do (there isn't a technical reason to use one otherwise)\n\n\nAnd of course you need to keep in mind that PPC applications are no longer supported under  Mountain Lion.\n", "Q: Switching from Ubuntu to OS X and I'm lost Situation\nI got tired of some bugs/annoyments in Ubuntu(=some programs coming along with it). For example after using compiz for a few days I found bugs that were\ndistracting my work flow pretty bad (e.g. https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/compiz/+bug/933776).\nWhat I also hate is what I call \"monitor lottery\", it starts when you plug in an external video-output to your machine. Sometimes you win, and most times you don't.\nI needed fresh air and Windows was not an option. I just don't like .bat, cmd.exe, C:\\, and those windowsy things.\nSo I bought 13\" Macbook Air.\nSomeday I probably will test how to code an app for my iPad, so being in Apple-camp helps.\nI'm trying to use the Macbook as my main working/coding laptop, because it is light and has better resolution than my current laptop(Thinkpad X220).\nProblem\nMaybe I'm not used to OS X's philosophy or something. I don't understand the window manager's behavior.\nI don't fully understand the behavior of the bottom dock.\nI'm quite lost.\nQuestions\nWorkspace = single virtual desktop\nWindow management\nWhen pressing Cmd-Tab and the app switcher pops up:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have 5 terminal windows open, and would want to bring one of them in front. Is it possible that Cmd-Tab would be window-switcher instead of app-switcher. I know I can switch to app's next window with a shortcut, but I would want to have all the windows in the switcher, regardless of what the app is.\n\n*When switching to a minimized app, workspace will be switched where the window should be, but the window stays minimized. Why? I would want it to be shown(unminimized?).\n\n*In my Ubuntu machine, I move window's position by pressing Alt, holding left mouse and dragging it from anywhere on the window. Also resizing works by holding right mouse button instead of left. Any solution to emulate this behavior?\n\n*I usually use windows in maximized mode. For example when I'm editing text, I do not want to see any distractions(like a browser window). To my mind, maximized means that a window takes all available space on the screen but does not cover the system's toolbars etc. But when I press the green (+) button, the window is streched vertically and the width stays the same. The weirdest thing is, that some of the windows strech only vertically, but some of them strech both vertically and horizontally. I want the maximize button to take all the available space. Is it possible?\nShortcuts\n\n\n*\n\n*In my web browser, I have always closed tabs with middle click. Also if I want to open a link to a new tab, I press middle click. How can I do that? I often browse news etc with one hand on the touchpad, so pressing Cmd while clicking isn't that good. Touching or tapping(not pressing the whole thing down with force to hear a click sound) touchpad with three fingers would be the best shortcut.\n\n*I want the following global shortcuts. The apps should open in the current workspace.\n\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl - < : New terminal window opens\n\n*Ctrl - Alt - b : New terminal window opens and it executes a command: 'ssh bla bla bla'\n\n*Alt - m : Maximize/Restores the earlier size of currently focused window.\n\n*Ctrl - Alt - c : Browser opens\n\n*Ctrl - Alt - s : Text editor opens\n\n\nIs there any program that would allow this?\nApps/Other stuff\n\n\n*\n\n*Terminal\n\n\n*\n\n*Pressing Alt-2 normally produces '@'. But in terminal, it does not produce that character but instead it starts a mode which says '(arg: 2)' on the left.\n\n*Not directly related to terminal, but is it possible to setup SSH so that the connection would not drop when lid is closed or internet disconnects? Any experiences of MOSH http://mosh.mit.edu/?\n\n\n*With my Ubuntu laptop, I edited files in a remote SSH server via STFP. Are there any good SFTP clients which could just mount the remote folder, like in Ubuntu it does.\n\nA: *\n\n*Resizing/moving windows with keypress and mouse in Mac OS X\n\n*Can I create a shortcut to open a specific application on OS X?\n\n*Best app to switch between all open windows (alternatives to Witch)\n\n*How do you maximize windows?\n\n*Safari 6: Open and close tabs with middle click?\n\nCtrl - Alt - b : New terminal window opens and it executes a command: 'ssh bla bla bla'\n\nYou can assing a shortcut to a script like tell application \"Terminal\" to do script \"ssh bla bla bla\".\n\nPressing Alt-2 normally produces '@'. But in terminal, it does not produce that character but instead it starts a mode which says '(arg: 2)' on the left.\n\nThat's why using option as a meta key is disabled by default. iTerm has a preference for using only the other option as a meta key.\n\nWith my Ubuntu laptop, I edited files in a remote SSH server via STFP. Are there any good SFTP clients which could just mount the remote folder, like in Ubuntu it does.\n\nI use Transmit Disk for that.\n\nA: Welcome to OS X. It can be a great aid to your workflow, and make you more productive. You should be able to adjust pretty quickly after the initial learning curve. Please be advised that there are some small things you'll have to change in your workflow, as OS X is after all a completely different OS. But over time, you'll grow to enjoy it. I'll address your specific concerns.\n\nDock Behaviour\nThe Dock has several sections. Assuming you kept your dock on the bottom, the left side contains pinned and currently running apps. This is actually similar to Unity. You can enable a \"dot\" under running applications by right-clicking an empty space in the Dock and clicking Dock Preferences from the context menu, and selecting Show indicator lights for open applications.\nAfter the divider, which can be clicked and dragged to resize the dock, there are your stacks. Stacks are previews to commonly-accessed folders, and you can drag any folder into this spot. You can preview the contents of stacks in several ways, right-click it to view the stack's options.\nTo the right of the stacks are the minimised windows or documents. OS X typically dedicates windows to documents, so the terms (especially in the old days) were considered pretty interchangeable.\n\n\nWindow Management\nThis was one of the biggest pain points when I switched, and now I really enjoy it.\n\nViewing Application Windows\nYou can quickly switch between open windows of the same app by pressing Cmd+`.\nAs you Cmd + Tab, you notice that you're tabbing through apps and not their individual windows. Note that you can activate an app (i.e. un-minimise or un-hide windows by holding down alt (option in the US).\nIf you want to see what windows an application has, you can either:\n\n*\n\n*Press the Down arrow while the Cmd + Tab selector box is over the app.\n\n*Right-click the app's dock icon and select \"Show All Windows\".\n\n*If you are in the app, swipe three or four fingers down on your trackpad (configured by  click the Apple on the top left, opening System Preferences, opening Trackpad, navigating to the More Gestures tab, and selecting to activate App Exposé with three or four fingers.).\n\n*Swipe three or four fingers down on its dock icon.\n\nAny of those options (there might be more) will take you to App Exposé, this will show all the open windows in the center of the screen, and any minimised or hidden windows as thumbnails.\n\nSwitching to a minimised window in a different workspaces\nThis behaviour is app-dependent. Using a Finder window, the behaviour is as you wish. i.e.  the window un-minimises itself, and the workspace is switched. Make sure to click the minimised window and not the app icon.\nYou might want to make certain apps available on all your workspaces. To do this, right-click the app's dock icon, and select its behaviour under the Options > Assign To section. The app needs to support this feature.\n\nMoving and Resizing\nWindows can be moved using only the chrome (the grey area above the app's actual content). Most of the chrome is on the top of the window, but certain apps such as Finder have bottom chrome that can be used to move the window around.\nOS X does not recognise right-click drags. It just doesn't. The only real way to resize windows is by dragging from any edge using the left mouse button.\n\nUsing BetterTouchTool\nIf you want, you can download the excellent BetterTouchTool. Under Preferences, Advanced, Action Settings, Window Moving & Resizing, you can choose to move the window under the mouse by simply holding down a key (e.g. the alt (opt) key.\nYou can use BTT to change certain behaviours to just the way you want them. It's extremely powerful. You can also assign custom gestures to do almost anything, in any app (or globally).\n\nBetterTouchTool's advanced settings.\n\nMaximising and Zooming\nOS X does not use the green \"+\" button  to represent \"maximise\". That's the \"zoom\" button. The idea is that the app expands itself to occupy as much space as it needs. Unfortunately, the behaviour is extremely inconsistent, especially with third party apps.\nMore and more apps are beginning to support the FullScreen mode, which was a feature introduced in OS X 10.7 (Lion) . This button, if an app has it, will dedicate an entire space to the application. It will be accessible from Mission Control.\nI'll give you two options, both involving third-party apps:\nBetterTouchTool has an option to enable Windows-style snapping. So when you drag a window to the top of the screen, it will expand to fill the screen.\n\nAnother option is to use RightZoom, which claims to change the functionality of the green zoom button to mimic a maximise button. It's free, but I haven't yet tried it.\n\nShortcuts\nYou can create a ton of shortcuts in OS X, even to specific menu-items from System Preferences. I'll address your specific concerns here.\n\nMiddle click to open and close tabs\nI long ago solved this with BetterTouchTool. All you need to do is assign a shortcut like below, and it will be mapped to a three-finger click on your touchpad. You can choose  anything else (e.g. three-finger tap if you prefer).\n\nMiddle click allow you to open a link in a new tab.\nSafari does not support the closing of tabs using middle-click. You either need to click the little \"x\" that appears over the tab, or press Cmd+W.\nGoogle Chrome supports middle click for both closing tabs.\n\nGlobal Shortcuts\nBetterTouchTool can make quick work of assigning some global shortcuts. I don't think you'll be able to replicate the Ctrl + Alt + B (opens a text box, then executes the command in a terminal).\nCmd + M will minimise a window, no need for BTT for this.\n\nEtc\nApologies, but I can't answer your MOSH question\n\nAlt-2 in Terminal\nOn my laptop, Alt + 2 produces the euro symbol, so it's keyboard-dependent. If you want the \"@\" symbol, it's normally found by pressing Shift + 2.\n\nSFTP\nI normally use CyberDuck for all my FTP needs. However, a quick web search  turned up this: How to mount SFTP shares in Lion.\n\nA: As a nonspecific suggestion, someone coming from Linux will probably appreciate Alfred. You can execute any Terminal shell command by hitting the Alfred hotkey (usually Alt-Space) and beginning the command with >.\n\nA: In addition to the great answer by @Redandwhite I suggest that you also look at another add on called 'Witch'.\nhttp://manytricks.com/witch/\nIt appears to change your command-tabbing to cycle between windows instead of just applications. I've never needed this myself, so can't vouch for it. But it may be just what you are after. \nAdditionally, you may like the application QuickSilver http://qsapp.com/ I use it to launch my applications rather than by clicking w/ the mouse. (it is similar to Alfred mentioned by @Andrew Lazarus above)\n\n", "Q: iOS: App to search All Content in PDF files?

The other Mac I have is a 4 GB MacBook Pro. I'm wondering if it would be possible to shuffle the memories between both of them, so I have a single 8 GB RAM stick in the MacBook, and in the mini I would put a 8+2 GB RAM?\nThe specific models in question are:\n\n\n*\n\n*a Mid-2010 model MacBook with 2x2 GB of DDR3@1067Mhz. \n\n*a July-2011 model mini with 2x8 GB of DDR3@1333Mhz. \n\n\nA: The answer to the general question is yes - Macs have never required paired RAM although many machines get a 5 to 15% speed boost if you pair the RAM. In some integrated graphics applications on the 2007/2008 era designs, this could be larger a speedup for some graphics operations.\nAs long as your Mac doesn't exceed the total RAM the CPU/logic board wants to handle, you can split up the banks in any way you choose.\n\nFor your specific models, I would look at a reputable RAM seller like Ramjet to see if people have been reliably making more RAM work in your specific models. Often Apple will say the maximum RAM is 4 GB but 8 will work well if you have top of the line chips with the correct timing. Also - be aware that mixing speeds of RAM (1066 vs 1333) can be problematic or cause the system to fail to start up. Normally, permanent damage is not done to the memory or the computers when you place the wrong RAM in, but it can lead to aggravating crashes, video glitches and slowness.\n\nA: Go to apple.com/support and type your serial # in the search bar.  If your RAM is above the recommended maximum amount of your machine, you stand a greater chance of getting errors.  However, a kernel panic usually indicates a bad stick of ram rather than improper amounts.  As a matter of fact, some larger sticks of ram are designed to only use the maximum amount allowed by the computer no matter what the size of the RAM.  It's just nog widely publicized.  \n\nA: I'm not the expert but I have done that and It works just fine. No issues at all.

Recently, I purchased a WD 1TB 2.5\" 5400 hard drive to upgrade. I used SuperDuper! and made a clone of internal drive to new drive via USB. After swapping the two drives, my laptop became very slow. Spinning beach ball appeared very often, almost everywhere. Did extended Apple hardware test, all ok. \nThen I put back the original 250 GB HDD in my MacBook Pro and took out the new one and things are fine again.\nI found this post with the same problem. Sounds like I am stuck; I can't upgrade my internal HDD?\nHas anybody successfully upgraded their HDD? I want to upgrade to SSD, but this time I want to make sure it will work before making a purchase!\n\nA: I upgraded this model to a 480gb SSD but I had to do two things. First, I replaced the disk drive cable with a new cable for 2010 MBP 15\" from iFixit. Second, per OWC, I used an SATA2 rather than an SATA3 drive.\nTesting showed the cable replacement was absolutely required. I didn't have an SATA3 drive to test against so I'm taking that one on faith.\nAssuming your replacement drive is an SATA2 drive, you just need to replace the cable.  It's not hard but e careful with the screws that attach the cable to the body. I stripped one and it was a PITA.\nIt's a whole new machine with an SSD. Very fast for everything except CPU-intensive stuff like encoding video.\n", "Q: iPhoto has missing photos but they can't be removed I have an iPhoto library of about 2100 photos. It's iPhoto 11, v9.4.1 (701.67).\nAt some point I imported some photo's from memory stick and played around with the 'store photos in library' vs. 'link to existing photos'.\nWhatever was the cause, now every time I open iPhoto I get several messages telling me photos are missing and whether I can find them. I tediously selected some of them one by one (why isn't iPhoto smart enough to look for the others in the folder I just selected?? :/ ) but some I still cannot find.\nI'd rather now remove them from my library, but every time I try to select a missing picture for deletion iPhoto freezes and I have to force-quit.\nI tried the repair options with Cmd+Option, but those don't seem to help and the thumbnails rebuild will just ask me for the source of 100s of photos so I just cancelled that.\nI also tried the script in: http://philatwarrimoo.blogspot.nl/2010/06/iphoto-script-to-remove-missing-photos.html but after some time iPhoto freezes again and the script times out.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Your Library is corrupted.\nDownload iPhoto Library Manager and use its rebuild function. (In Library Manager it's the FIle -> Rebuild command) Note: this does not require purchasing Library Manager\nThis will create an entirely new library. It will then copy (or try to) your photos and all the associated metadata and versions to this new Library, and arrange it as close as it can to what you had in the damaged Library. It does this based on information it finds in the iPhoto sharing mechanism - but that means that things not shared won't be there, so no slideshows, books or calendars, for instance - but it should get all your events, albums and keywords, faces and places back.\nBecause this process creates an entirely new library and leaves your old one untouched, it is non-destructive, and if you're not happy with the results you can simply return to your old one.   \n", "Q: Can I keep the BOOTCAMP Partition on \"secondary\" drive when upgrading to SSD? I have a Late 2008 MacBook Pro 2.53 GHz with 8 GB RAM and a 320 GB HDD. I'm running OS X Mountain Lion on the Macintosh HD (260 GB capacity, 100 GB used) and a Windows 7 on the 60 GB BOOTCAMP Partition.\nWhat I want to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install an SSD of 120 GB, move OS X there using Time Machine - don't see any problems here.\n\n*Keep the original 320 GB drive by moving it to the SuperDrive slot, erase the existing OS X system (since it will be migrated to the SSD)\n\n*Keep BootCamp unchanged on original (320 GB) drive. \n\n\nQuestion: Will the BootCamp partition still work after moving the internal HDD? It will obviously not be on the boot drive anymore, since that should be the SSD. \nIf not, is there a way to make it work so I don't have to put it on the SSD? \nIf not, are there tools for migration so I don't have to do a Windows image & reinstall?\n\nA: Yes it shouldn't be a problem. Using the option key during booting should show all available installations to boot.\n", "Q: Can I make the caps-lock setting stick, for external USB keyboard in Mountain Lion? I have a Macbook Pro running Mountain Lion, and I frequently use an (external) Apple USB keyboard with it.  In the Keyboard sys prefs, I set the \"caps lock\" key to be \"^ Control\", for both \"Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad\" and \"Apple Keyboard\" (i.e., external).\nWhen I unplug the external keyboard, and plug it in again, though, the \"caps lock\" key once again is a caps lock key.  I can set it back in the sys prefs, but it only lasts until I unplug it next.\nI have a different Mac running 10.7, with the same caps lock setting, and when I unplug the external USB keyboard, the caps lock setting stays set.\nIs this by design?  Is it a bug?  Is there a workaround?  Can I make Mountain Lion remember my caps lock setting somehow?\n\nA: It should stick even on Mountain Lion.\nTwo suggestions.\nFirst, you might use Onyx to validate your preferences.  \nSecond, try deleting ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.systempreferences.plist and logging out and logging in again.  \nIn either case, the pref file might be messed up and that could prevent it from being saved.\n", "Q: Can I restore individual iCal appointments using Time Machine? I use Time Machine to backup my Mac. While it is very easy to restore files and folders, I can't do the same with appointments in iCal. I am trying to recover an entire calendar that was accidentally deleted.\nApple provides instructions on how to restore from manually exported iCal archives. It sort of defeats the purpose of Time Machine, where backups are created automatically. By contrast, Time Machine works directly in Address Book in Lion.\nDoes anyone know if there is a way to restore iCal appointments (or calendars) using Time Machine? I know I can probably restore the cryptic calendar files in the Library folder, but I want to find a better way.\n\nA: You can; it will involve some command line work (which I'll list but not explain here):\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit iCal & Mail. Disconnect from the internet if any of your calendars are cloud-connected.\n\n*In Finder, open <home>/Library/Calendars/\n\n*Enter the Time Machine and go back to before the loss occurred. Identify the missing calendar.\n\n*Still in Time Machine, enter that calendar's folder. There is an Events folder here.\n\n*Restore the Events folder to your desktop (or somewhere else, but don't just \"Restore\" it back into the library).\n\n*Exit the Time Machine.\n\n*Open a terminal and go into the restored Events folder.\n\n*Concatenate all of the files (there's one per event) into one long events file named <whatever>.ics.\n\n*Open <whatever>.ics with your favorite editor and insert these 4 lines at the top of the file:\n\n\n\nBEGIN:VCALENDAR\nVERSION:2.0\nPRODID:-//Apple Inc.//iCal 4.0.4//EN\nCALSCALE:GREGORIAN\n\n\nand this line at the end of the file:\n\nEND:VCALENDAR\n\n\nand save the file.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iCal and import this file into the new calendar, which should now contain your events.\n\n\nA: JRobert's procedure got me close today, but not all the way with Mavericks and iOS 8. It seems some formats have changed since that answer.\nYou need to grep out the lines he suggests adding. Each file creates them, and the resulting .ics file from simple concatenation will contain too many. I grepped most out verbatim, but used ^PRODID: because each calendar version (iCal, Mac OS X) used a different string.\nWhen it was done, I used an editor to add a more modern PRODID at the beginning:\nBEGIN:VCALENDAR\nVERSION:2.0\nPRODID:-//Apple Inc.//Mac OS X 10.9.4//EN\nCALSCALE:GREGORIAN\n\nAt the beginning, and left the text to add at the end the same.\nFinally, you need to reconnect to the Internet before you import. iCloud would delete the entries after I successfully imported them after reconnection. Keeping it connected convinced iCloud that they should be left in the calendar.\nI still have no idea how the calendar was deleted. It happened a couple of days before the release of iOS 8, and it wasn't something I noticed happening.\n\nA: I asked staff at the Apple Store the same question, who consulted with a Genius. As of Mountain Lion, it is still not possible to go into Time Machine via iCal/Calendar. In other words, the only solution is to manually restore deleted entries from raw iCal/Calendar files (located in ~/Library) using Time Machine.\nThere is a related discussion on Apple Support Communities:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3851319?start=0&tstart=0\nThe person I spoke to also reminded me to turn off iCloud before attempting the restore procedure, as it may corrupt existing calendars.\n", "Q: Windows 8 won't recognize audio device on Macbook Pro (late) 2011 I just installed Windows 8 on my MacBook Pro, I then installed the Windows Support drivers and everything works great except for one thing, the audio.

I think I don't have anymore space. So what do I do now? Help?\n\nA: As noted in another answer, you'll need to remove some data if you want to install new apps. What you remove really depends on what's taking up lots of space — it might be apps (games in particular tend to be large), videos or music.\nYou can get a good overview of what's taking up space on your device by going to Settings → General → Usage. You should see a breakdown of how much storage each app is taking up. You can also remove apps from this screen, or if tap on the Music or Videos apps, you have the option of removing some media files more granularly.\n\nA: Maybe you can start with removing some of your unwanted apps. \nTo delete: Press and hold any of the app icons on home screen, then press the small cross button at the upper right hand corner of your unwanted app.\n\nA: Maybe you could try to go to settings, then you go to \" General Usage \" to see what are the apps who are taking to much space on your device. Then you just delete the unwanted apps.\n\nA: You have to register with the iTunes Store to be able to download.\n", "Q: iChat Download For OS X 10.6.8 I foolishly deleted iChat Application from my Mac with version of 10.6.8 for free disk space.

This event is an out of hours social event so I thought I would forward the invitation as an iCal event to my iPhone and add it to my Gmail calendar to keep things synced up. But when adding to my calendar my phone decided to send out an invitation to everyone who was invited to the original event inviting them to this event that had just been added to my phone.\nSo now not only does everyone in the office have my personal email address they also have a confusing second invitation from a random Gmail account to an event they had already accepted or declined.\nIs there any way I can forward calendar appointments like this without my phone emailing everyone attending?\n\nA: I am fairly \"late to the game\", but since no answer has been accepted yet, my input might still be useful:\n\n\n*\n\n*the \"meeting highjacking\" you describe in your question is fairly well known with Exchange and the iOS calendar app; in fact it can be even worse where simply accepting an invite on your phone may make you the \"owner\" of the meeting; this seems to happen more often the larger the number of meeting attendees gets. This issue is so severe that in my company we discourage people from accepting meeting invites from their phones.\n\n*as for the \"butchered description\" you describe in your answer: this, too is a well known issue between Exchange and the iOS calendar. iOS 8.3 supposedly fixed it, but since those cut off notes do not happen all the time, we do not have enough data yet at work to say for sure.\n\n\nA: Right the way I seem to have solved it is to just forward the appointment regularly in Outlook and not as iCal. This has added it to my calendar but totally butchered the description and I've had to rename some of it but it seems to have worked. It has been a lot more effort than manually adding it though.\nIf anyone still finds a better solution though that would be great,\n", "Q: Permissions of User directory are wrong after manual restore I manually restored the files in my User directory running cp from the Mac OS X Mountain Lion restore disk.

I've set up iMessage on my iPhone correctly (apple id) with Messages on my Mac (OSX Mountain Lion), and it syncs.\nBut the syncing isn't flawless.. Everytime I wake up my Mac after hibernation, it won't update my messages. I first have to restart the app a few times, to get all my messages. Sometimes even the order of the messages isn't correct.\nFrom my experience the syncing is still quite buggy.\nDoes anyone have the same issues, and maybe a workaround?\nps: I don't use wifi on my Mac, if that's relevant.\n\nA: The closest solution I found is to ping one of your connections.\n\nA: If you scroll up and down consistently in the sidebar (where all the convos are held) for a while it usually tends to send and receive. At first it might only do one side of the messages, but keep scrolling up and down and it will eventually all be there. Takes less than 15 seconds at most.\n\nA: the messages app is always slow, restart it (and wait a long time).\n\nA: You can't really do it. It's the server side that is laggy.

When I restart the phone after taking photos, the phone will continue okay and lasts 3 days.\nAre there any hints about this specific battery-drain problem? (I have already read the general battery hints.)\n\nA: I don't think its the GPS, do you have Photo stream turned on?  That will upload your pictures to iCloud.  One thing you can do is check usage to see what is doing on after you take pictures.  Is my iPhone 5S draining battery too fast (and is it due to process mediaServerD?) has good information in the OP about checking what is using your battery.\n\nA: You should try to kill the GPS. This is because the GPS will still be on even if you don't see the triangle icon, it will still be running in the background. \nThe same goes for Wi-Fi/Bluetooth. \n\nA: Turning off \"Location Services\" on your iPhone will eliminate GPS usage from draining your battery. Here's how:\n\n\n*\n\n*On your iPhone, open \"Settings\" > Privacy > Location Services.\n\n*Slide the button to Off.\n\n\nThis will disable ALL location services (GPS).

Is there a way I can hide a running app's dock icon Mac OS X?\n\nA: Important Note: In Mac OS X 10.5+ the method explained below only works for apps which are not using the \"Code Signing\" feature which was introduced in 10.5 to ensure authenticity of running code. The result of applying this method to a signed app differs; it might cause the app to  crash upon starting or results it unexpected behavior.\nYou can edit the file Info.plist contained in the directory of each App (e.g. /Applications/VLC.app/Contents/Info.plist)by adding the following lines:\n<key>LSUIElement</key>\n<string>1</string>\n\nFor example:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n        <key>LSUIElement</key>\n        <string>1</string>\n        <key>BuildMachineOSBuild</key>\n        <string>11G63</string>\n        <key>CFBundleDevelopmentRegion</key> \n        ...\n        ...\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nWhen you will start the App you will see the icon just for one second and the it will disappear.\nDockless and Dock Dodger do this change automatically in apps.\n\nA: *\n\n*This worked great. I wanted to open Mail every 15 minutes so I created a script in Applescript Editor that looks like this:\n\nrepeat\n      tell application \"Mail\"\n          activate\n          delay 60 * 15\n      end tell\n  end repeat\n\nThe delay of 60 is 60 seconds and I multiplied it by 15 (=15 minutes)\n\n*Then in Applescript I clicked \"Compile\" then \"Save\" and named it \"Mail Every 15\" BUT made sure to name it as an Application not as a Script in my Applications folder.\n\n*Go to your Finder and in your Applications folder is your new file \"Mail every 15\". Right click that file and choose \"Show package contents\">Contents.\n\nYou'll see a file named Info.plist in which you can open the file in your text editor by double clicking.\n\n*Once you open the file insert the code mentioned above and put just under the \"dict\" line\nNote: Once you start trying to edit it will warn you:\nYou don’t have permission to write to the folder that the file “Info.plist” is in.\nYou can duplicate this document and edit the duplicate. Only the duplicate will include your changes.\nGo ahead and duplicate it and make the 2 line change with the insert.\nSave the file to your desktop as Info.plist (just like the original file).\n\n*Your Finder should still be open, if not, reopen it by repeating step 3.\nRename the original file, I named it Info-A.plist (just for safe measure. I'm sure you could just move the file to trash but I didn't want to take chances.)\n\n*I Swapped places with the files (Moved Info.plist from the desktop to the \"Mail every 15>Contents\" folder and moved the Info-A.plist to the desktop)\n\n*Go to System Preferences>User & Groups>Login Items and then I clicked on the + sign to add a login application to start it at boot up or login.

I'm looking for a free or if not cheap solution to a situation we find ourselves in. Currently we have 5 designers all doing artwork throughout the day and then periodically, or when the mood takes them, burning it to DVD-R then running it through an ancient X11 Disc Catalog app we have. The problem is each person does it \"their own way\" and the disc numbers get mixed up from time to time and lost etc.\nI'm looking for a collaborative solution where perhaps they backup to a central server, however I don't really want a \"spare\" Mac just sitting there doing nothing.

Too many people are getting bogged down burning DVD's etc at the moment!\n\nA: I would look at getting a NAS (Network Attached Storage) box which appears to be basically a disk that can be accessed from anywhere on the network and is added to the network like any other machine. I would suggest using Ethernet to the router rather than WiFi.  (I just got a very simple 2TB NAS for £80 so can be inexpensive, although given this is a work setup I would expect to look for a more complete set up costing more, remember to work out the cost of losing a design before saying any solution costs too much)\nIn the simplest form a share can be mounted to each Mac where it will look like another disk in the finder. Then users can copy from their machine to the NAS.You would also have to set up another process to backup the designs from the NAS. Most NASes come with software that sets up automatic backups from Macs to the NAS. The other benefit of having the data on a NAS and not on DVDs is all the designs are quickly available. Your X11 catalog should also be able to work off this.\nMore complex NASs will include things like \n\n\n*\n\n*RAID which means you don't lose data when one disk fails.\n\n*allow you to add more disks to increase capacity\n\n*Do unattended backups to cloud or other off site storage\n\n*Could burn DVDs itself\n\n", "Q: Why are all of my windows tiny when I plug in an external monitor?

I have multiple virtual machines setup in VMware Fusion. \nSome of them are only servers (like Ubuntu), which I want to run without seeing the VMware Fusion icons or windows, a little like VMware Server does. \nDoes anyone have a solution?\n\nA: It appears you can start Fusion headless by executing the following:\n\n/Applications/VMware\\ Fusion.app/Contents/Library/vmrun -T fusion\n  start ~/Documents/Virtual\\\n  Machines.localized/[IMAGENAME].vmwarevm/[IMAGENAME].vmx nogui\n\nYou could also add /Applications/VMware Fusion.app/Contents/Library to your $PATH or create an alias to have easier access to the vmrun command.\nYou can find more info on the vmrun command in this PDF. While a bit out-dated, it should still contain relevant information on how to start and stop your server.\nIf you are interested in running headless Linux servers for your development environment etc, I can also highly recommend to use VirtualBox instead. It is free, has extensive command-line support, and while running headless VMs Fusion loses most if its advantages (seamless GUI integration) over VirtualBox anyway. What's more, tools like Vagrant can even facilitate running these environments to a much greater extent. With the addition of a paid add-on (\"provider\"), Vagrant can control VMWare as well as VirtualBox for you3.\n\nA: An additional way, you can start up the VMs you want and then force quit VMware Fusion using Command+Option+Shift+Esc\nThe GUI quits but the VMs run in the background. To manage these VMs you can start VMware fusion again as usual and it will show you what's currently running.\n\nA: The best I can figure without hacking into the Dock is to set VMWare fusion to launch at boot and hide itself. The OS is designed to show apps that call for a graphical interface, so it's really up to VMWare to program their app to run as a background daemon if you don't want to work around this OS feature.\nYou could also explore placing that app under Mission Control and putting it on a secondary virtual display so you don't see it unless you need to observe a guest OS.\n\nA: An alternative solution which is simple to hide the VM window is to press command+h. However, it does not remove the VMware Fusion icon.\n", "Q: Why would an iPhone 4S drops from 100% charge upon unplugging it? I have notice lately (in last two months or so) after disconnecting my iPhone 4s (with iOS 6) from the charger in the morning after an entire night of charger it immediately drops from 100% to 98%.  Is this a sign of a problem or normal battery aging.\nI do perform the monthly battery drain til power down as recommended by Apple \n\nA: It’s neither a problem nor a sign of ageing.\niOS devices, since the first iPhone, have used a method of charging their Li-ion batteries, which is different from normal charging as you know it. \nSuppose your device is at 10% charge and connected to the charger. The device will charge up to 80% in 2 hours. This is called fast charge. Now the device will charge up to 100% in another 2 hours. This is called slow charge.\nWhen the device reaches 95% actual charge, it displays “100%” as the current charge in the status bar. The device keeps charging till it reaches 100% actual charge, at which point charging is stopped and the battery discharges naturally. Note that still the displayed charge is “100%.” Now, when the battery reaches 95% while discharging, charging starts again and continues till you reach 100%.\nThis cycle is repeated until you disconnect the charger, at which point the displayed charge changes from “100%” to the actual charge, which may be anywhere between 95%-99%.\n\nA: Modern devices with a battery (iPhones included) are intelligent with charging and stop charging when the battery is full. Since the power supply of the adapter will be switched off at that point, your battery will start to slowly discharge just like when it would be unplugged. To avoid wearing down the battery by continuously \"topping off\" the battery after such a discharge while still being connected, it will not resume charging automatically until a certain threshold for discharging has been met.\nThe behavior you experience is this small discharge which happens during the time your battery was fully charged, and the moment you unplug the device. The confusion comes from how Apple decided to display the battery level, but the reasoning is that users will be more inclined to believing there is a problem with the battery when it appears it never charges to 100%.\n", "Q: Remove rogue keyboard shortcut in OSX I recently followed this blog to add a keyboard shortcut to lock the screen:\nhttp://hpmalte.blogspot.ca/2012/01/keyboard-shortcut-to-lock-screen-in-os.html\nI assigned the commandL keyboard shortcut to this script.

How do I solve this problem?\n\nA: Mac OS X is only supported as guest OS when the host OS is OS X - and then it only OS X Server that VMware allow the install of.\nTherefore I think you are missing some necessary driveres.\n", "Q: Is there a way to change the naming scheme for screenshots? \nPossible Duplicate:\nSave screenshot with my own name \n\nIs there any way, short of a third-party application (I'm quite fond of the baked-in functionality of the screenshot system in Mac OS), to change the filename that screenshots get named with when they're created?\nFailing that, are there any notable screenshot apps that give you better granular control over your screenshots, without nuking the process too much?\n\nA: If you can use the Terminal, screencapture lets you specify the name of the file (and much more).\n\nA: You can't remove the \"date at time\" portion, but you can change the \"Screen Shot\" part preceding it.\nOpen Terminal and run defaults write com.apple.screencapture name NAME_HERE (replacing NAME_HERE of course). Then run killall SystemUIServer.\nIf you want to change the whole format, then you'll either need a 3rd party utility, or you could come up with a script and folder action to rename the files immediately as they're created.\n", "Q: Why does SystemUIServer cause high CPU usage? The SystemUIServer process is taking 30% of my CPU. Searching around reveals a Snow Leopard daylight savings bug which is solved by removing the clock from the menubar. I am on Lion and I have tried this without success. Any ideas on how to fix this?\n\nA: Same problem here. The problem is caused by a third-party widget that uses the internet. For me, dropbox was the problem. If dropbox is updating my files, systemuiserver keeps using a high amount of CPU .. the only solution is to force quit it (using terminal or activity monitor) or disabling the third-party widget.\n\nA: Looks like there are actually a couple ways to solve this.\nI have been having the same problem, and today I also noticed my clock hadn't been showing the correct time in about 2 hours, and when I hover over the clock I get the spinning beach ball.\nSo I found from this article that you can simply kill the SystemUIServer process and it will just restart itself and all should be well again.\nIn order to kill the SystemUIServer process, you can simply open Activity Monitor, Filter by Process Name or %CPU (as it will likely be the highest CPU user), then select \"SystemUIServer\", and choose \"Quit Process\" from the options at the top of the window (button that looks like a stop sign).\nOnce you kill the process, OS X will simply re-initiate the process, and you should be back on track. However this seems to be only a temporary solution, and you may encounter it again.\nSo for a more permanent solution (if you are not afraid to venture into terminal land), try the process outlined in this article, which was provided by Joshua Taylor where you add a cron job to OS X that restarts SystemUIServer at the beginning of every other hour (automating the solution above to this problem):\n\nOpen your terminal (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app).\nType:\ncrontab -e\n..and hit enter.\nHit the letter \"a\" on your keyboard.\nEnter the following, using tabs for the large separations:\n0     */2     *     *     *    killall SystemUIServer\nHit the escape key on your keyboard.\nType:\n:wq\n..(that's colon, w then q) and hit enter.\nClose Terminal.app.\n\n\nA: This would terminate the process only if the CPU time is over 5 minutes:\n*/15 * * * * [[ \"$(ps -e | grep SystemUIServer | awk '{print $3}')\" > 5:00.00 ]] && killall -kill SystemUIServer\nIf you don't know how to use vi, you can modify the crontab with EDITOR=nano crontab -e.\n\nA: I've recently had the same problem on a Mac Pro running system 10.7.5 with DropBox installed. Updating to the current version of DropBox (2.6.2) has helped considerably, but not completely.  Instead of getting a system slow down with a spinning rainbow wheel and SystemUIServer reporting 98% cpu usage multiple (annoying) times per day, it is now down to twice today.\n", "Q: How can I know external HDD used time?

How can I know that?\n\nA: If your disk supports S.M.A.R.T. feature then you can learn it from Disk Utility through clicking to info button after selecting related disk from the disk list.\n", "Q: Why are all ports closed even without firewall or router? I have no router and the firewall is turned off in System Preferences. If I go to http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/, not matter what port I verify, it is closed.\nWhy are my ports closed even though I have no firewall or router?\n\nA: I think you're getting a bit confused about terminology. Typically ports are often referred to as open, closed, or not reachable.\nAn open port is one that is not blocked by NAT or a firewall, and has a service answering requests at it. An example would be if you enabled Web Sharing on your Mac, the standard HTTP port (80) would be open.\nA closed port is one that is reachable, but has no service to \"answer\" it. In some cases firewalls or routers with NAT will close ports, but usually this is a port that can be reached, but has no service there.\nAn unreachable port (which will often show up in port scans as \"timed out\") is one where the firewall or NAT actively ignores any attempt to contact it, rather than sending a response that says \"this port is here, but closed\". In theory this is more secure, since it doesn't even confirm to an attacker that there is a computer at the IP they're touching. In reality the benefit may be less, but I'm not qualified enough to make a definitive judgement. This is the status that will show up with most consumer routers and firewalls.\nYou may want to try a different port scanner, as in my tests, the one you linked doesn't distinguish between closed and ports that timed out.\n\nA: Do you have a specific service you are running and expect to find an open port on?  Connections to ports without anything binding/listening on them will be refused.\nIf you know the port number, you should look at the port forwarding or virtual server settings on your modem/router so the port is accessible through the NAT.\n", "Q: NAS Streaming Performance I recently bought a NAS drive (WD Personal Cloud) and it seems great - for everything but streaming video, it is very quick. However, when playing video files (480 and 720p) despite there being no other network traffic, VLC still occasionally pauses for about two seconds, then continues to play. \nThis happens about every ten minutes, and I was wondering if there is a) a better app, b) a way to tell VLC to cache ahead of time or c) something I'm doing wrong.\nI'm on a Wireless N network, zero other traffic - I was thinking it might potentially be the mac doing other internet related stuff in the background, but that's just an idea.\nThanks! \n\nA: I have since found a solution for this and would like to share:\nVLC (and most other video apps) have a network caching feature. By default its set at 1/100th of a second or so - using the images below you can increase it. \nThe trade-off is that you have to wait a few seconds when skipping or loading a film. \n1 - http://img.iamp.me/i5bN (click show all, bottom left)\n2 - http://img.iamp.me/65qz\n\nA: You have to check the video playback on the local computer first to avoid the problem is related to your video itself.\n", "Q: When switching to a different space, OS X sometimes just switches back to the previous space. Is there a fix for this? I've got a curious problem with my computer, which is set up with 2 spaces. I use the Move left a space and Move right a space shortcut to switch between them.\nQuite often, particularly the first time I switch spaces after rebooting, OS X just switches back straight away. The sliding animation finishes, and then - just as the desktop icons would ordinarily start to fade in, or the key window would appear highlighted - it switches back, putting me back where I was. Subsequent switches work fine.\nFor something so minor-sounding, it's surprisingly annoying. Has anybody else had this, and managed to fix it? I'm not really sure where to begin looking. There are no messages in the console.\nOS X Lion 10.7.5.\n\nA: I have the same issue on High Sierra and only just figured out what's causing the issue for me. It happens when I:\n\n\n*\n\n*have the same application open in both desktops/spaces, Chrome windows in this example\n\n*switch from Chrome to another application\n\n*change desktops\n\n\nIt will revert to the previous desktop and make Chrome the active application. Now when I change desktops it will not switch back. I have not yet found a solution to this issue, other than making the application that is on both desktops, the active application before switching.\n\nA: If you delete all the files from your desktop folder, the space switch works every time.\n", "Q: Can I restore from a 16GB backup to an 8GB iPhone I recently switched to Verizon.  My wife's phone was a 16GB AT&T iPhone.  Verizon had the 8GB version for free with the contract.  \nIs it possible to restore from the 16GB backup to the new 8GB phone?\nBoth are iPhone 4s.\n\nA: Ok, I got it done, but it took a little bit of a run around.\nI had failed to mention in my question that the size of the original 16GB backup was indeed close to 16GB.  Clearly not going to fit on the new 8GB phone.\nThe very first time I tried to restore from backup, I got a message about the size incompatibility.  Every subsequent time it would just hang at \"Estimating Time Remaining...\"\nNext, I decided to remove much of the superfluous data on the old phone, to get a new backup of it under 8 GB.  Trying to use this new, now smaller, backup resulted in the same hang up.\nAt this point I thought it just might not work.\nWith nothing to lose, I decided to have iTunes restore the phone to factory.  Then, the very first thing I did was try to restore from the new smaller backup...  Success!!\nSomehow the failed attempts before hand, were keeping the phone from successfully restoring from backup.\n\nA: You can pare down the backup by using selective deletions with an external tool such as iTunes Backup Manager \n\nA: Yes - the system will alert you if the contents cannot fit, but everything will be fine if the apps and data all fit on the smaller device.\n", "Q: How can I download iTunes U videos faster? I want to download the videos from iTunes U, such as iPad and iPhone Application Development.\nLectures of previous semesters were on YouTube, so those of us with slow Internet connections could download/watch them without having to wait too long. But the latest videos are only in iTunes and seem to be, high quality, large files only. They take too long to download. \nIs there a way to download these videos faster, or download lower quality versions just like YouTube?\nThis isn't exactly a MacOS question, rather it is related to iTunes. I am asking the question in this site, because I can't find any solution in the internet.\n\nA: I had the same issue. If u use Wi-Fi for Internet access, try using a different Wi-Fi network when downloading or restart your Wi-Fi router. Try using an ethernet cable for wired Internet access instead of using Wi-Fi. \nAlso check for updates for your computer or for any security software you may have.\n", "Q: Seemingly Irreversible Custom Keyboard Shortcut I have a late 2010 Apple MacBook (If that matters) and when I had OS X Snow Leopard installed, I created a keyboard shortcut that I seemingly can no longer reverse.  After upgrading to OS X Lion and now OS X Mountain Lion the shortcut is still carried over.\nThe keyboard shortcut is: whenever I click the 'fn' key, it will 'show desktop.'\nI have searched all of the 'Keyboard' section of System Preferences to see if I can deactivate anything there.\nI do remember that when I made the shortcut originally on Snow Leopard, it could be changed back.\nI remember when I had OS X Lion, I wanted to change it, but I couldn't figure out how (like now)\nI have tried the 'restore defualt' option in System Preferences > Keyboard, but that didn't work.\nIf anyone knows how to fix this or even has some sort of guidance to help me try and fix it, it would be greatly appreciated as this is becoming an increasingly inconvenient and frustrating problem.\n\nA: A similar question entitled \"Fn key shows the desktop on my Mac\" was posted in July 2012 on Superuser, and maybe of help.\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/455603/fn-key-shows-the-desktop-on-my-mac\n(If my answer is more appropriate as a comment, please convert it to one)\n\nA: Did you check the Mission Control preferences?

It is possible to connect a USB keyboard to an iPad (3rd generation) using the camera connection kit. \nHowever, my Apple keyboard does not work so which ones do? \nYes I know I could buy a wireless keyboard.\n\nA: Yes you can, but it doesn't seem to work under the new iOS6.\nSee: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqCk6nz80Ps\n", "Q: Safari on iPad can't resolve local network names I have a number of local Windows, Linux and Mac machines on my local LAN, but no matter what, Safari will not resolve them by name.\nHow can I get this to work as there is no \"server\" on my network? I use the machine names only without suffixes.\n\nA: It's likely that the computers are using NetBIOS name resolution (aka WINS or occasionally SMB). This is used commonly for Windows file sharing, and is typically set when you enter a hostname for a computer. On Macs and Linux, it's not always broadcast, unless Windows file sharing is enabled/installed, but it typically is, so it's usually a workable option for small networks without a lot of fuss.\nHowever, iOS devices don't use NetBIOS (since they don't do Windows file sharing, there's not a lot of point, and there may be licensing issues, I'm not sure). So unless you've explicitly set up DNS hostnames on your network, this is most likely why you can't address your machines by name from your iPad.\nThe best solution here is to assign hostnames using static DHCP on your router — because your machines most likely already use your router for DNS, you should be able to change your settings on the router without needing any changes on any of the machines. Most home routers have some way of doing this, but it varies from model to model. The basic process is to assign a DHCP reservation for each machine and add the host name (some routers might allow for a hostname based on MAC address, without a static reservation). Those host names should then be resolvable from all machines, including the iPad via DNS.\nIf you need further help with this, add some information about your router (although searching for an answer on Superuser might yield the information you need).\n\nA: I've had success resolving Windows hostnames to IP addresses (from my iOS devices) by installing Apple Bonjour (using the \"Apple Bonjour Print Services for Windows\" download package) onto the machine I wish to connect to, and then suffixing the server name with .local.\nSo:\nhttp://MyWindowsPC/\n\non my iOS devices becomes:\nhttp://MyWindowsPC.local/\n\nThese two steps work for me both within Safari, as well as via other iOS apps. \n\nA: As far as I can tell, Safari on the iPad can't resolve local network names. This functions seems to be broken by a recent iOS upgrade\nI still can browse by ip address. Is the ability to browse by local network names broken by the recent iOS upgrade or is there something wrong in my setup?\n\nA: You need to configure your setting in DNS for WiFi options.\nPlease check the link here.\n", "Q: Folder in root greyed out in Finder but accessible in Terminal I've just migrated from an old MBP to a new one.

If an Application shows a high CPU-load it could be the culprit. \nIn you case it's probably the 'Safe Sleep' function, the equivalent to the Hibernation Mode in Windows, which creates a temp. file on your HD to ensure a correct wake-up - even after a power loss.

On my iPad 3 (The New iPad), is it possible to switch between different versions of iOS (iOS 5 & iOS 6)? If so, how?\nWould also be possible to install Android and or Windows 8 on iPad? \n(I know for older versions of iPhone there is iphodroid and Bootlace, but these don't work on the iPad 3. There are also services that let you run Windows 8 on a computer and access it from iPad, but that is not the same as installing Windows 8 on iPad).\nI don't mind if the answer involves jailbreaking. \n\nA: None of what you want is possible. And it never will be possible until suddenly Apple and Microsoft get married and the marriage is watched on live television by more than 50 million people worldwide.\n\nA: If you have an iPad 3rd generation on iOS 5.x with iOS 5.x SHSH blobs (signature hashes) saved, you can upgrade and downgrade between versions of iOS 5.x. You can't downgrade from iOS 6.x back to 5.x though, since the exploits used for that process are fixed with iOS 6. For more information about the limited-circumstance iPad 3rd generation downgrades and upgrades, see this iPhone Dev Team blog post.\n(If you have an iPhone 4 or earlier device, you can upgrade and downgrade between any iOS versions as long as you have SHSH blobs saved for your target iOS version. This is possible because the iPhone 4 and earlier devices have bootrom exploits available.)\nYou're correct that the tools for installing Android on iOS devices only work for old iOS devices.

Effectively, each app has it's own folder on your iPad, and no other app can access the files within. It sounds silly, but it's a big part of security in iOS.\nIf you want to play media from an FTP server, you'll most likely need to get it with a player app that supports FTP (it looks like viPlay might, although I don't know if that's just the paid version, or the Lite version as well).\n", "Q: How to download youtube videos in Safari?

I use either of both of the following variants depending on what I'm trying to test:\nVirtual machines\nYou can run OS X 10.7 and newer inside recent versions of Parallels and VMWare Fusion. You can also run the server variants of older OS X versions this way; these older server variants also work on VirtualBox, which is free for personal use.\nAdvantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run multiple versions of OSX at the same time\n\n*Should be easier to automate (script) testing\n\n*Snapshots for easy rollback to previous OS states (e.g. different patch levels, etc.)\n\n*No need to repartition your disk\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*Noticeably slower than natively installed OSX.\n\n*If the software you want to test uses 3D acceleration or other non-USB hardware features, you will likely run into problems. Even USB devices may or may not work properly.\n\n*Parallels and VMWare Fusion cost money (but realistically, it isn't much)\n\n*Requires lots of RAM. It's just about doable with 4GiB, but I'd recommend 6-8 or more. RAM is pretty cheap, but some Macs are limited to 4GiB or non-upgradeable.\n\n\nI don't have Parallels, but when I tried it, installation was pretty straightforward. VMWare Fusion just requires the Lion Installer.app (or Mountain Lion Installer.app) from the App Store for setting up a VM. When it asks for a disk or disk image, just drag the installer .app from Finder into the assistant window.\nMulti-boot\nYou can install additional instances of OSX on your computers, and easily switch between them, either via Startup Disk in System Preferences or by holding the Alt/Option key when you hear the boot chime.\nYou can either repartition your existing disk - shrink it via Disk Utility and add an extra partition during setup - or install onto an extra hard drive or SSD. This can be an external USB or Firewire drive. Some Thunderbolt drives are also bootable.\nThe Installer.app\nIt's a good thing you've already purchased Lion, as you can no longer buy it from the App Store. The easiest will be to download it on your Mac running Snow Leopard: open the App Store, ensure you're logged in with your correct Apple ID and click the \"Purchased\" tab. You should be able to download Lion there.\nWhen the download is done, it'll be an App in the Applications directory. Do not run it as that would upgrade your Snow Leopard install. If going the VM route, you can use the .app directly, otherwise you'll need to extract the InstallESD.dmg from the .app bundle and \"restore\" it to a USB stick (min 4GB) via Disk Utility. You can then boot from this stick by holding the Alt key when you hear the chime.\nI also recommend backing up the installer app, as re-downloading it from the App Store from Mountain Lion is not possible out of the box. There are work-arounds, but I wouldn't rely on them continuing to exist.\n", "Q: Can I see any information about which machines are authorized against my iTunes account? When I just opened iTunes and authorized my Mac against it for purchases, it told me there were two machines authorized against my iTunes account (therefore, one other one). However, I can't think which that other one would be - I've had various virtual machines etc. configured against iTunes in the past. Are there any ways to find out any more about it (hostname, OS, etc.) so I can check out the situation and potentially deauthorize it?\nI'm aware of the limit of 5, and I'm aware of the ability to deauthorize all of them and start again. I'd just prefer to keep things clean and not have stray authorizations hanging around if I can.\n\nA: I also have the same problem and unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a way to view this kind of information at present. This is corroborated by several Apple Support Community threads here, here and here. \nAs you say, the only option seems to be to either try to figure out which machines are currently authorized and deauthorize them using iTunes (particularly difficult in the case of multiple VM's or machines you no longer have) or deauthorize all and start again.\n\nA: There really is no downside to de-authorizing all systems and then authorizing the systems you currently use.  It only takes a few seconds to authorize, and you can just do it the next time you use any system you want authorized.  iTunes will prompt you to authorize by entering your AppleID email and password the next time you start it on any system that was deauthorized.  Enter it, it authorizes, and you're good to go.\n", "Q: Why is Aperture showing thousands of Rejected, but there are only 3 there? My Aperture is showing 2.5k Rejected photos (count), but when I view the album, there are only 3 there. I tried rebuilding the database.\nI also tried switching and viewing the library in iPhoto, which shows no hidden photos. The library in Aperture shows no hidden photos. When I create a Smart Album having only Rejected items in it, it still only shows 3 items.\nMy Trash is empty too, and permissions are correct.\nAny ideas on what's wrong, and why it's showing this?\n\nA: Apparently aperture doesn't show photos that have been hidden in iPhoto. You need to open the library in iPhoto and unhide them there, I think. Then you can reject them in aperture again, and they should show up as expected.\n", "Q: Did iMessage beta on Lion finally stop working recently? I tried to send a message using the iMessage beta that I installed on Lion ages ago. The message didn't send, and then I noticed the prompt looked like this:\n\nI tried to exit iMessage and restart it, but it wouldn't let me log in with the following message after entering my Apple ID:\n\nDid Apple finally forcibly disable iMessage on Lion? Are there any solutions to using iMessage for me now? (I know I could upgrade to Mountain Lion, but I'm curious if there are any alternatives.)\n\nA: Yes, Apple did disable Messages beta for Lion users.  French blogger from Consomac found the following in the French strings of the beta:\n\n\nsource http://consomac.fr/news-1339-messages-pas-sur-lion.html\n\nAlthough this is not the exact error that you are receiving, inevitably it will ask you to move to Mountain Lion now that it has been released.  I encourage the upgrade, and if this problem recurs after you upgrade, try moving ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.imservice.iMessage.plist to the desktop and restarting your computer.  You can If this does not work, move it back and edit your question accordingly.\n", "Q: How to disable or delay \"Time Machine hasn't backed up your computer in x days\" message? Mountain Lion and later OS X releases have a very useful feature where Time Machine can alternate between multiple backup destinations. I use this to back up to both a network share at home and an external drive I keep offsite. Because I only have physical access to the offsite drive occasionally, I don't back up to it often.\nAfter 10 days, OS X gives me a message around the same time each day, such as:\n \nTime Machine is still backing up successfully to the network share every hour, so this message is unnecessary (and the second sentence is incorrect).\nI like being able to see when the last backup was completed, so I'd prefer not to remove the disk from Time Machine's destination list entirely. Likewise, turning Time Machine off (as suggested here) isn't an option because I still need my backups to run on the other drives.\nIs there any way to disable or delay this message? Ideally I would be able to set it to a longer period of time, so it could remind me to go do an offsite backup every month or so.\n\nA: Perhaps TimeMachineScheduler or TimeMachineEditor can help.\n", "Q: Apple TV won't connect to Airport Express I just bought an Apple TV last night. I have it sitting directly underneath my Airport Express. I have 2 wifi connections on my Airport, one for my stuff and one for guests.\nWhen I list the wifi connections in my Apple TV it sees both, however when I try to connect to either I get this message:\n\nThere was a problem connecting to the network.\nCheck your settings and try again. (-3906)\n\nI tried with a bad password just to compare the difference and I get this message:\n\nThere was a problem connecting to the network.\nThe Wi-Fi password you entered is not correct. Try again. (-100)\n\nSo it can see it, and tell it is the correct password; but it will not connect.\nMy MBP, MPA, Android phone, Xbox, and guests' windows laptops have all connected to this airport without any problems.\nIt does work if I connect the Apple TV to the Airport via ethernet.\n\nA: I have 2 apple tv’s.    One wouldn’t work anymore.     I went to Utilities, Airport Utilities and noticed there was a newer version available.   Once I installed the newer version my apple TV finally worked.   I don’t know if this will help anyone else, but it did the trick for me.     \n\nA: Unfortunately, my post was edited to the extent that its meaning was changed.\nTry making sure that the encryption method used on the Apple TV is set to WPA2, and not \"WPA/WPA2\" or some other type of autodetection.  I've experienced problems (with other devices) when connecting to WPA2 networks using that autodetection, and I was able to connect without an issue when manually setting the encryption type.\nI can't leave this as a comment because I don't have the rep points.\n", "Q: Open in Low Resolution checkbox on Retina MacBook Pro checked and disabled On a Retina MacBook Pro some Java applications (such as IDEA 11.1.3 that is supposed to support it) won't run in HiDPI mode. When I got to \"Get Info\" on the app, I can see that the \"Open in Low Resolution\" checkbox is checked and disabled. Is there a way to change this? I have Java 1.6.0_37 installed.\n\n\nA: It doesn't sound like the application actually supports HiDPI mode.  Here's a tutorial for modifying Microsoft Word's application package so it will support HiDPI Mode: http://imgur.com/a/0P5KY.  Perhaps it would work for this application as well.\nSummary of the link:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a backup copy of the application\n\n*Open the application folder, then right click the app and choose \"Show Package Contents\"\n\n*Edit Contents/info.plist\n\n*Toward the bottom of the file, just before </dict>, add the following lines:\n<key>NSHighResolutionCapable</key>\n<string>True</string>\n\n\n*Move the app package out of the applications folder.  Then move it back in.\n\n*The application may now allow a hacked, possibly glitchy retina mode.\n\n", "Q: Keyboard and Mouse freeze after deep sleep (Mountain Lion) I got a mid 2011 MacBook Air 13.6\" and its keyboard and mouse freezes very often after I leave it in sleep mode for some time and it wakes up. Only the power key and the lid detector are still responsive. It’s also possible to connect to it via VNC or SSH.\nI had a look into the error logs but I couldn’t find anything suspicious. I found out that the System Preferences app does not start anymore and all the OSX related menu bar icons seem to freeze too (Bluetooth, WiFi, Battery icons).\nFreezes after sleep mode seem to be a common problem but I couldn’t find any case yet that is like mine (others have a grey screen, no WiFi connectivity, still mouse responsiveness or the keyboard responsiveness comes back after a while – issues I don’t have).\nEdit:\n - Also the iSight Camera is not responsive anymore.\n - Notification Center and Hibernation mode do not seem to be the problem (I tested both).\n\nA: I had the same issue on my Macbook Air and Mountain Lion.\nThe quickest way to solve this is to disable the login screen or the \"ask for password\" setting.\nIf you're worried about privacy, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset PRAM\n\n*Reset SMC\n\n\nIf it still doesn't work, disable deep sleep mode (hibernate) by doing this:\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0\n\nNote that doing the above will only put your computer on battery sleep and this will affect battery life when you're not using your mac.\n", "Q: Full restore from backup, /Applications not backed up I recently had my hard drive replaced. I made sure my Time Machine backup was up-to-date prior to the handing it over to the Apple Store so I could simply restore, but I made one mistake: /Applications was not being backed up with Time Machine.\nI got my computer back today, and I now have a fully restored iMac less /Applications. This means the Dock is full of question marks... I have nothing. I'm typing this from the restore partition where I don't see any way to replace /Applications.\nAll I can think to do from here is start with a fresh install and work from there. Any ideas before I go down that route?\n\nA: If you hadn't backed up Applications, you're stuck there. But you should be able to just go and reinstall the applications. When you do, the dock will be normal again and you'll have the benefit of keeping your settings and everything else. No need to wipe the whole thing and restart.\n\nA: First thing is browse the backup using Finder or the Time Machine interface and see if spotlight can find a missing app at a different time interval than the one used for the restore. \nUnless you went in and excluded that folder from backups, those files are normally included in all backups, but perhaps there was a glitch in the backup or the restore and you can avoid having to manually reinstall the third party apps piecemeal. \n", "Q: What external HD can I use to my Airport Extreme Base Station for use of wireless Time Machine? The title pretty much says it all.  I currently have an Airport Extreme Base Station and I want to be able to use the USB port on it to hook up an external hard drive and use it as a wireless means of backing up my hard drives, and have Time Machine act just like it would with Time Capsule.\nHas anyone had success in setting this up? Is there a specific hard drive that has had success? Any spec I need to be looking for in shopping for a hard drive? Any help is appreciated.\n\nA: Unlike the Time Capsule, the Airport Extreme doesn't support being a backup destination, no matter what drive you use. It is possible to force Time Machine to use unsupported destinations, but this is unsafe - the AEBS lacks features that help protect data, and without them, the slightest network error can make your backups useless.\nSome of the technical reasons for this have been explored here: Why won't Time Machine work with a drive connected to an Airport Extreme?\nHowever, you can look for a network-attached drive that supports Time Machine, such as WD's My Book Live. These are drives that attach by ethernet instead of USB, and they implement the file-sharing features that Time Machine requires.\n", "Q: Force Time Machine to perform a deep traversal? How do I force Time Machine to perform a deep traversal? I've had this happen when I needed to once before, when it took about 120 minutes to go through 500 GB and Time Machine found about 10 GB worth of data that changed, which was exactly what I wanted at the time.\nNow however, I'd like to do this again, but I can't seem to do it. I've tried resetting TM by trashing com.apple.timemachine.plist, booting from my Snow Leopard startup disk (even though I'm running Mountain Lion), and probably other things that I can't think of right now (I've been spending hours on this problem so far).\nWhen I try to perform a backup, TM wants to backup my entire drive, which is about 500 GB, when I know that not everything has changed. I can even use TM to explore folders and go backwards in time and see that many folders have not changed in a while. So, I'd like to force TM to re-index my entire drive so that it picks up only the small changes rather than decides to back up everything.\nPerhaps, is there a way to purge the File System Event Store, where Time Machine goes to see what has changed recently? I assume that currently it probably lists that everything has changed, perhaps due to something I did while trying to fix this problem over the past few days.\n\nA: Deleting the .fseventsd directory on the backup drive would be one way to do it.\nHowever in my experience there have been a few times where Time Machine did a full traversal, estimated that it would have to back up the entire drive, and then proceeded to \n check everything but only back up files that were different. For example, this happened after upgrading from 10.7 to 10.8. The size of the new backup was much less than it first estimated.\n\nA: Booting in single-user mode may cause a deep traversal. It did for me once, but not subsequent times. Deleting /.fseventsd definitely will. It should be safe to do this in single-user mode. Deleting /.fseventd on the backup volume did not trigger a deep traversal for me. (My system continued on as normal and never even re-created it.)\n", "Q: Almost all files are locked in my Time Machine backups? For some reason my files are getting locked in my Time Machine backups. I mean, when you \"Get Info\" on one of them, the \"Locked\" box is checked. Folders are NOT locked, though.\nIs this normal? This doesn't apply to just Apple files either (such as .pages). It's happening to .txt, .avi, .png, etc.\nBy now, almost all the files in my Time Machine backups are locked. So when I restore a folder, for instance, every single file in it is locked. This has definitely not been the case for me before.\n\nA: Go to Disk Utility, select the partition of your drive with the Time Machine icon, and click Repair Disk to verify and fix any problems with permissions settings (see below image).  \nYou may also want to repeat the process with Macintosh HD to be safe.\n\nupdate Is this option checked for you?

Is anyone else experiencing these issues and are there known workarounds (besides quitting and re-opening Preview [although it does save your work and annotations right before, because of Auto Save...?] or using Skitch).\n\nA: It seems that a recent restore and fixing permissions and the disk in Disk Utility have cleared up the issue.

I just made the switch from an Android and I had this option there. Does the iPhone have it as well?\nAnd a second question: will the alarm activate when the phone is off?\n\nA: The alarm will not activate when the iPhone is turned off. This was tested with an iPhone4 running iOS6.\n\nA: As Pro Backup states, if the iPhone is off, it will not turn on by itself to activate your alarm.\nAnd as far as the stock alarm built into the iPhone, there's no option for you to enable a gradually increasing volume alarm. However, a quick Google search found the goodNite Lite - Alarm Clock Night Light app that should give you the functionality you're looking for in that department.\n\nA: I've been using Yocto Clock for my alarm. It has an increasing volume that can be adjusted up to 30 seconds. As far as turning the phone on goes, I don't think it does that. It does, however, use the proximity sensor to enable a kind of sleep mode. This allows you to turn the phone over, screen faced down, so it sleeps. The alarm still goes off, and picking the phone up enables the other features (like built-in flashlight).\n\nA: I got an app called \"Chronology\".  Its alarms do occur even when the iPhone is sleeping.  (I never turn my iPhone off, so I know nothing about that state.)\n\nA: Use the built in Bedtime function inside the iPhone Clock app on iOS 10.

Unknown error code.\"\nI need your help guys. That's why I partitioned my iMac's drive in the first place : to be able to debug under 10.7 as well (see here: Install 2 different OS X versions on the same machine/hdd ).\nSo, any ideas???\n\nHint : I've also tried to find any instances of \"Install Xcode\" installers on my MacBook Pro, hoping that there would be some left (appropriate for 10.7 that is)... but unfortunately all I've found didn't seem to want to work under 10.7. So I'm stuck - I don't think there's any other way I could manage to re-install it, other than through the App Store, and the... App Store doesn't seem to be working... :S\n\nA: I have a similar setup, but I've got 10.6 on one partition, 10.7 on another and 10.8 on yet another partition.  When the Mac App Store looks for installs, it will look at all the partitions for installed apps.  I think that is your problem: it is already finding Xcode on your 10.6 partition.\nHere is how I solved it and how I recommend you to do it as well:\nUnmount your 10.6 partition after you boot into your 10.7 partition\n\nIf you want to do this automatically, you have to edit the file:\n/etc/fstab\n\nInside of /etc/fstab, you need to place your partition's UDID like so:\nUUID=68613ECB-3492-3B8B-9FFF-55FB1F30A32B       none    hfs     ro,noauto\n\nnoauto means don't automount it.\nTo find the UUID of your drive, launch Disk Utility, select the partition and then press the Info toolbar button.  It will show you the UUID listed as Universal Unique Identifier.\nThen reboot and you should find that your 10.6 partition is automatically not mounted.\nAt this point, the Mac App Store should look for Xcode, not be able to find it, and then allow you to install Xcode properly.\n\nA: The reason that this happens is because the App Store detects any of the software installed on the machine, even if it wasn't through the App Store.  To resolve this, and to be able to download/install XCode on your current partition, load Disk Utility and unmount the 10.6 partition.  Then, load the App Store and install XCode. When it's done, remount the 10.6 partition in Disk Utility.\n\nA: Rather than install from the App Store, you could get Xcode from the download section of Apple's Developer Site. You may be required to create a developer account if you have one, but the free one should suffice, you don't need to sign up for the Mac or iOS developer programs.\nThis has the added feature of being able to choose precisely which version of Xcode you want, as it includes versions back to 2.2.1, from what I can see.\n", "Q: Is it possible to disable the game center completely and permanently in iOS 6? I am trying hard to avoid signing in to Game Center, but the interruptions and pop ups make this hard to do.\nMy impression is that after the third time I don't sign into Game Center, a pop-up asks if I want to disable game center. The text implies I want to be really sure as disabling GC means I'll lose so many wonderful features. It also tells me I can always enable it later in Settings. Each time I'm offered to opt out, I say yes intending to disable GC.\nIf this worked, I'd think it great, but the next time I launch a game, the now allegedly disabled and definitely signed-out-of Game Center (into which, by the way, I've never signed in) is back asking me to sign in.\nWhat can I do to avoid this?\n\nA: I'm concluding the answer is no until someone proves otherwise.\n", "Q: Copying to external USB drive in Mac OS X 10.8.2 yields \"Device not configured\" and hard lock I am copying using cp or mv on the command line a large amount (>500gb) of files each sized between 600MB and 2.6GB to an external drive (a Thermaltake BlacX Duet), but after a significant but inconsistent amount of transfer (e.g. 121gb) the following happens:\n\n\n*\n\n*A message pops up in a dialog box that says \"The disk was not ejected properly. If possible, always eject a disk before unplugging it or turning it off.\" (There were no physical events that took place that would have resulted in a disconnection) \n\n*The copy fails for an item and all subsequent items, complaining with various errors including:\n\n*\n\n*\"device not configured\"\n\n*\"Invalid argument\" (because the destination no longer exists)\n\n*\"No such file or directory\" (ibid)\n\n\n*The Terminal locks up\n\n*Executing 'Force Quit' on Terminal quits the Terminal, but it cannot be reopened\n\n*Finder locks up\n\n*No applications will start\n\n*Relaunching Finder causes the menu bar at the top and the dock to disappear\n\n*Rebooting does not succeed (i.e. one must hard-restart by holding the power button); variations on ejecting (before Finder locks) and unplugging the USB cable appear to have no effect on the inevitability of this result.\n\n\nNote that roughly the same result occurs when attempting the same copy in Finder. In particular the dialog entitled \"Copy\" remains open, clicking the \"Stop copy\" \"X\" button causes an indefinite pause with \"Stopping ...\" showing. One can still access the Finder, and even read from the drive, but relaunching Finder causes it to display seemingly indefinitely \"Application not responding\" and in any case one cannot start new applications.\nAfter rebooting, the destination has received most of the data. Disk utility reveals no issues with the destination drive.\nI have Spotlight disabled for the external drive, if that makes any difference.\nObviously the expected behaviour from copying is not to have the computer hard-lock requiring a forced reboot.\nFor obvious reasons (Terminal being locked, applications won't start) it is hard to diagnose the problem.\nAny insight would be greatly appreciated.\nEDIT\nI have had some success by repartitioning the drive into two main partitions of about equal size (460GB) on the drive at the beginning and end with a medium sized partition in the middle (as it seems that this error is occurring at around the \"middle\" of the drive size). However, I am uneasy about this very speculative solution. But if it works, I can get on with life. :) In any case, insight into the nature of the underlying issue is most welcome.\n\nA: The most common problem with external usb drives are the small power adapter with 2A. I have various WD Drives and all give up after a time with the same error \"The disk was not ejected properly...\". Without power the hd disconects (for a short time). I bought a bigger power adapter with 3 A and have no problems any more.\n\nA: The external drives continue to exhibit erratic disconnections, though they no longer seem to be connected to items being copied to the drive or not. Sometimes an error message will pop up spontaneously stating \"The disk was not ejected properly.\" For what it's worth I have tried other USB cables and all the USB ports on the back of the Mac. In any case, this may be a species of a known issue with the Thermaltake Duet and I will mark this as the answer (and leave it for anyone else who happens across a similar issue).\n\nA: This has been a recent discovery for me as well. Same situation. I'm running the latest update of 10.8.2 and Finder seems to lock up after doing some file transfers to an external drive, then prompting me with the message \"disk not ejected correctly\". I restart my computer, same thing happens. I'm becoming very disappointed that my computer can't do even the most simplest task. I hope there is a fix for this soon. \n", "Q: Can I use TimeMachine with a Thunderbolt hard drive? The Apple technicians told me that I needed a specific device to use Time Machine... namely a wireless device that had a relatively small hard drive.\nSince I use Oracle Virtual Box and have very large files, I think it would be best to backup using Thunderbolt, instead of Wifi.\nCan I use a normal Thunderbolt harddrive and have Time Machine work with that?\n\nA: Yes. You can use Time Machine with any directly attached hard drive.  It is much faster, although if you have a laptop, it is somewhat less convenient to remember to plug the drive in than to use wireless.  \nThe folks from Apple were probably recommending a Time Capsule, which is a wireless router with a built-in drive for backups. It's definitely an easy way to do it, but not required.\n\nA: As per Alan's answer, any drive will do.  It's your call as to how big it is, and how fast the access to it is etc.\nA point of note though, is that by default Time Machine works on a per file basis (at present), not a block basis, and as such those who use data that is held in single large files that regularly change, will find that TM regularly shifts a lot of data to their backup drive.  This can result in filling your backup drive quickly, constantly backup etc etc, and you may find that there is a better solution for certain files like these.\nFor example, Entourage stores all it's mail in a large database file.  Receive one email, and the whole database is backed up again.  Make any change whatsoever to a virtual machine file, and the whole file is backed up again, every hour.  The other day I was just using Twitter for an hour, and it backed up 14Gb.  I couldn't understand why as I hadn't used any other program, until I realised I has Steam running, and it has downloaded a couple of updates...\nIf your VM program of choice has the ability to make snapshot backups, you may be better off making a manual copy of your VM files to your TM disk (You can arbitrarily store data of your choice on the same drive as your TM backups, just don't use the TM folder structure), then exclude the file from future TM backups, and set up regular snapshots instead, backing those up.  Other workarounds exists I'm sure.\nOf course, if your data is important to you, you should do whatever it takes to back it up, and a Thunderbolt drive will handle it I'm sure, just make sure that you have a seriously large drive attached to ensure that it's not filled too quickly!  If you have say 100Gb of VM machines, and you use them all during a 7 hour working day, you could in theory push out 700Gb of backups per day, which Thunderbolt will certainly handle, but even if you have a 2Tb drive hanging off the wire, you won't even get 3 days worth of backups before it's full and starts replacing the earlier ones.  And that's not a very good backup regime if your data is important, in fact it's barely any better than a once a day drive clone.\nJust some things for you to consider :)\n", "Q: Is it possible to mount a hard drive to the back of a cinema display? I'm looking for a way to mount a Thunderbolt Hard Drive to the back of a Cinema Display.  I remember seeing a way for a hard drive to be mounted to the original monitor stand, but I am using this Sanus monitor stand below.\nCan anyone think of a way to mount a hard drive to the monitor or stand and still keep the ability to rotate the monitor 90 degrees?\nhttp://store.apple.com/us/product/H6017LL/A\n\n\nA: I don't know of any commercial products, but two ideas occur to me.\nYou use some strong adhesive/double sided tape, combined with Velcro (you'd want a large patch, nit just a couple panels) or zip ties to attach the drive to the back of your display. This would probably work better with a 2.5\" drive, but a 3.5\" might be feasible if you had strong enough adhesive. The catch is that it whatever you stick to your display would most likely be permanent.\nAlternatively, making/adapting some sort of shelf that attaches to the VESA mount point would probably work well. I'm thinking a metal bracket of some sort that would fit between the display bracket and mount, with a shelf at the top, to which you could zip tie or otherwise attach the drive, to allow for rotation. This would probably be more elegant and non-permanent, but you'd need to scrounge or be able to make the appropriate parts.\n", "Q: What setup is needed to stay backed up and online after retiring the TimeCapsule? My friend has the following kit in the house (although not all at the same time):\n\n\n*\n\n*His MacBook Pro 15\" with 500gb HD \n\n*Her MacBook Air 13\" with 256gb SSD\n\n*Daughter's MacBook white with 500gb HD\n\n*His and Hers iPad 3\n\n*His and Hers iPhone 5\n\n*Son's iPod Mini\n\n*Nanny's iPhone 4S\n\n*Grandpa has an iPhone 3GS\n\n*AirportExpress for the bathroom speakers (niiiice)\n\n*Apple TV in the lounge\n\n*XBox 360 in the lounge\n\n*Samsung Smart TV in the lounge\n\n*TimeCapsule 1TB\n\n*Western Digital dual-drive 4TB USB drive (formatted as mirrored 2TB), connected to the TimeCapsule.\n\n\nThe Apple TimeCapsule has recently become unreliable either failing to do TimeMachine backups or losing it's internet connection (even though it is wired to the broadband modem). Even before this, the performance of wifi TimeMachine backups was poor - 300MB of changes would not complete backup before battery ran out. I have to admit, mine is exhibiting the same behaviour.\nSo, he'd probably like to move away from a TimeCapsule network.\nWhat's an alternative setup to allow all the same (or similar enough) features and functions? Does he have to buy a Mac Mini Server?\nUPDATE\nThe internet connection works fine when we plug a Mac into the modem directly, but the TimeCapsule would not allow WiFi clients to connect, so pretty sure the TimeCapsule is at fault.\n\nA: You could certainly try backing up to a computer running a server version of the OS which allows for networked TM backups to it much like your Time Capsule.\nYou could also just get an Airport Extreme and roll your own Time Capsule equivalent.\nYou could try to nail the performance issues of you TC by attaching wired to see if things improve, and it may then prove simplest to just improve your Wireless capabilities by wiring a couple of cheap Airport Expresses to it, you could then even though a cheap switch on the end of one for faster backups if you have a large one.\n\nA: You don't need OS X Server for Time Machine backups. Regular OS X works fine so he could just repurpose the white MacBook into a backup server with the external hard drive and get her an Air instead.\nI agree that he should confirm that he doesn't have network issues with both his wireless LAN and WAN. Losing the Internet connection is more likely to be a modem or provider issue than a TC issue. Switching the connection to another router can confirm it. The new Apple AE is a good choice but an Extreme might be better if he needs multiple Ethernet ports at the router location.\n", "Q: How can I name a voice memo in iTunes How can I add a name or title to the voice memos that sync from my iPhone to iTunes on my Mac?

The thing is, I haven't been able to make it backlit.\nI installed Power Plan Assistant (and Trackpad++), and the \"Turn Off backlit keyboard\" option doesnt do anything. I thought if I clicked on it, it'd toggle whatever setting it is it uses to actually turn it off, and I could use that to turn it on.\nAs far as I know, I have the latest bootcamp drivers (i update anytime I get an alert about that), and the latest windows drivers on the bootcamp install.\nI've googled extensively about how to manually turn the backlit keyboard on on a bootcamp partition, but haven't find anything.

I find reminders pretty useless because once you're reminded once it doesn't remind you ever again, even if you haven't completed the task yet. It would actually be useful if every time I looked at my phone it displayed the reminder until I completed it.\n\nA: This is a problem os-wide in iOS, for other apps too, like calendars.  Once you have received your alarm notification, whether for a reminder, or a calendar alert etc, you're done.  There's no way to \"snooze\" or \"remind me later\" for these functions.\nThe only way to get this functionality at present, is to use a replacement app.  One such app is Due, the following blurb is copied from their website:\n\nPERSISTENT REMINDERS\nWITH AUTO SNOOZE\nOverdue reminders stay in sight until you're ready to act on them.\nAnd with auto snooze, your todo list never gets stale.\nBy default, DUE repeatedly notifies you of overdue reminders every minute* with its auto snoozing feature until you mark them complete, reschedule them, or turn off their auto snooze.\n*Auto snooze interval can be changed to every minute, every hour, or none at all. There are no finer auto snooze intervals on iOS due to system limitation.\n\n\nA: I found one that, at least at first impression, repeats its notifications until you acknowledge it, and, as I personally require, can have reminders created via Siri (via scooping them out of the stock reminders app).\nIt's called \"Alarmed\".\nThe only thing that annoys me so far, is when you accidentally check an item as completed, there are multiple steps required to undo it.\n\nA: Try Alarmed. Simple yet customizable and integrates with Reminders and Siri.\n\nA: No, there's currently no stock option (like a snooze, for example) of having Reminders.app repeatedly remind you about an item.\niOS 6 did introduce the badge device to the icon, though. So they're making progress!\nEdit: Normally, though, unless you actually go into Reminders.app from the notification on your device, it should still display the reminder(s) among your Notifications.\n\nA: A good repeating nagging reminder app is iReminder. It's on my home screen. You can set it to nag you at intervals other than the stock 1 min or 1 hour\n\nA: With the iOS 7 update, reminders can persist on the notification centre.\nTo configure it, go to Settings > Notification Centre > Make sure Today View is enabled > Make sure Reminders is enabled.\nNow, when you pull the Notification Centre from the top, your reminders will be listed under the Today tab.\n", "Q: Is there any way to disable the iPhone 5's passcode functionality while connected to Xcode?

I could then pick up where I left off on my home computer if I wanted to.  On the work computer, when I'd click 'eject' on my device in iTunes I would see a brief \"Syncing iPhone...\" window pop up and that would update the play counts and position of anything that I'd updated while connected.  If I didn't eject, then that data would sometimes be lost, which is understandable (and I would always make a point to eject so I wouldn't lose my position).\nNow (iOS 6, iTunes 10.7 (21)) when I get home all that information is lost and whatever the play count or status was on my home computer is written back to the phone.  I also note that if I start playing a podcast via my work computer over USB, and then open the video app on the phone (or the Music app if it's an audio-only podcast), it does not know where I left off previously and starts from the beginning or my home computer's \"play head\" position.\nAny ideas?  I've restored the phone not that long ago, but starting from new isn't something I'd like to do because of the time involved in reconfiguring everything.

Windows 7 was the predominantly used OS on it, and she hardly ever booted into OSX Snow Leopard.  She did change the graphics card at one point, but I dont think she booted into osx once after installing the replacement gfx card (xfx 6870).  \nShe tried to boot into OSX by holding the option key - but just received a blank screen and no video output.  When booting into windows, and selecting the 'boot into osx on reboot' option - now there is no video output at all - and no option to select boot OS - so we're really stuck now.  There are two chimes on boot.\nI really have no experience with Macs - and have no idea where to start troubleshooting this problem.  Any help would be appreciated!\nEdit:  I have done some reading and possibly the reason there is no video is because the xfx 6870 model has not been flashed, and doesnt support the efi-bootcamp menu.\nEdit: Are there any keyboard shortcuts to select the OS on the bootcamp os select menu? \nEdit: Finally got windows 7 booting again after digging out the broken 8800GT.  Now just need an idiot-proof guide on flashing the 6870 so it works in osx!\nEdit: After doing some reading - it appears that the last version of snow leopard should have support for the 6870 - so I will probably try booting to OSX with the old card, then running the system update - and hope that the old gfx card does not fail completely during this time.  Then - if we can boot into OSX with the 6870, we will try using this zeus tool http://www.groths.org/?tag=zeus - which appears the easiest way to flash the card.\n\nA: You could try setting the PRAM. I think that was still effective on those models. But you are probably right about the graphics card. You can still pick up \"cheap\" cards from places like Powermax or powerbookmedic or owc\n\nA: The Mac should boot without a video card. However, a malfunctioning video card will prevent it from booting. If the original card was an 8800GT, search the web for \"8800GT bake\" for instructions on how to fix it by sticking it in the oven for several minutes. I've done it twice as unbelievable as it sounds and it does work. However, that doesn't sound like your issue.\nYou should be able to find a guide on flashing the 6870 firmware to EFI on this site. It sounds like enough people have done it at this point.\nThough this post is obviously old since it is referring to Snow Leopard, I believe there wasn't really proper driver support for 6870-class video cards until Lion or even Mountain Lion.\nAll that being said, I have a non-flashed 6870 running in a MacPro3,1 with no issues. I haven't attempted the EFI flash simply out of laziness since the lack of boot screen hasn't bothered me enough and I've been fine with the rare occasions I boot camp into Windows 7 to use a bless script that I've put on my desktop years ago.\nThe only advice I'd give for anyone who wants to put in a PC card in a machine like the 2008 Mac Pro is to try to keep the wattage under 180W, avoid the latest GPU of the day (driver availability) and keep the original card somewhere in case things go wrong. Otherwise as long as your Mac boots healthy a PC card will work just fine.\nAll said and done, there doesn't appear to be a keyboard shortcut for which OS to boot into. You just need to have one of the OS options healthy enough and have the Apple drivers installed on the Windows side to get the boot camp options.\n", "Q: Which options exist for SSH tunneling clients on iOS? I need a solution that will work without jailbreaking, but answers that include that can help others are welcome but just might not be selected as the answer.\nOn Linux and on OSX, I use ssh on the command-line to open ssh tunnels so I can run client-server applications securely.\nI need to do the equivalent on ios (run some kind of tunnel in the background, while I run a client application through that tunnel).\nWhat tools or options exist and listing supported iOS versions would be even more helpful if you can provide that level of detail.\nHow can I set up a ssh tunneling service on iOS?\n\nA: If you are looking for an application to setup local port forwarding like:\nssh -f -L 3000:talk.google.com:5222 home -N\n\nYou could check SSHTunnel, it allows you to easily manage and precisely control your ssh tunnels. Can create and share SOCKS5 proxy (aka Dynamic Port Forwarding) or setup a Local Port Forwarding.\nAlso, you can manually specify the local port to bind, configure connection timeout, see logs and statistics etc.\n\n\nA: vSSH supports tunneling. You can setup tunneling in the \"Port forwarding\" section of the connection settings. Local, remote and dynamic (SOCKS proxy) forwarding are supported.\nYou are able to use tunneling even without opening SSH session (shell permissions are not necessary for ssh user in this case).\nDue to iOS limitation the app can work in background only for 10 minutes (iOS 5,6) or 3 minutes (iOS 7). vSSH reminds you about this timeout through Notifications. \n\nA: This isn't possible under the current iOS App Store rules (and this is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future). Apps are very limited in what they can do in the background, and keeping the sort of persistent connection that an SSH tunnel requires wouldn't be permitted.\nSome apps (such as VNC clients) have built-in SSH tunnelling capability to get around this, but if the apps you're using don't include it, the only option (short of jailbreaking) is to use the built-in iOS VPN capability. It doesn't support SSH, but it does support L2TP/IPSec, PPTP, and some other variants.\n\nA: iSSH supported opening tunnels. For example, I can set a tunnel on local port 4444 that points to an IP address and port 80. Opening localhost:4444 in Safari then loads that website through the tunnel. iSSH also has good support for saved configurations and public key authentication.\nUnder the App Store rules, iSSH is only allowed to keep the connection open for up to 10 minutes in the background, so after 9 minutes or so I'll get a notification and the tunnel will be closed if I don't switch back to iSSH quickly enough.\nAs of 2015, iSSH isn't available anymore. The same functionality likely exists in other iOS SSH clients, but I haven't tried any myself.\n\nA: I have it working for a jabber client (sort of) with vssh app to an Ubuntu server. Once the SSH session is open I launch top or glances to keep the session active, but it will seem to go dormant after 3 mins. After that I need to toggle over to the vssh app then back to the jabber client and it will work for another 3 mins.

I have to admit, I never thought that I'd see the day I preferred a different desktop browser to Chrome. But with the latest release of Safari, I'm a believer. It (to me) performs faster, looks better, and having that baked-in sync functionality with all my iOS devices and other Macs is... well, insanely great.\nThat being said, there are a few features that I miss from Chrome, but the one that I really miss is the multiple search engines you could invoke from typing the name of them and then either Space or Tab (e.g., type \"imdb\" and then Tab to search using IMDb's search query functionality).\nIs there some sort of less-advertised extension that I can get to bestow this upon Safari, or am I out of luck?\n\n\nA: Try SafariKeywordSearch. It allows you to set up custom searches triggered by keywords preceding searches. For example, I have it set so that goto Ask Different uses Google's \"I'm Feeling Lucky\" to send me to the first Google result for \"Ask Different\".\nThere's a good set of built-in defaults, and it's pretty easy to add almost any site-specific search out there, by making a small edit to the URL. There are instructions on the site.\n\nA: There is also Safari Omnikey, which has a dedicated toolbar button and which I found easier to use:\n\nSafari Omnikey\nChrome-like keyword search for Safari browser. Search Amazon, Wikipedia or any other site directly from your URL bar.\n\n\nA: Also, pull down the Safari menu, after \"About Safari\" is a direct link to Apple's extensions page. There are several that allow for different or multiple search engines. If nothing there you like, Google is, in this case, your friend.\n\nA: Searching on a page (eg: en.wikipedia.org) the first time adds this to the dropdown suggestions. In this case for example as \nsearch on en.wikipedia.org for \"your search key\"\nwhen you enter\nen.wiki your search key\nFor apple.stackexchange.com the prepended word apple to the search key might be sufficient.\nFor me it works on iOS and Yosemite.\n", "Q: Backups.backupdb folder is greyed out on my external time machine drive I use two separate backup drives to backup my iMac and MacBook.  I call one drive Time Machine and the other drive Mobile.  On Mobile, it shows a folder called Backups.backupdb and inside it has a folder for the iMac and the Macbook.  On the Time Machine drive it has the same folder but it is greyed out.  When I click on it to try and verify the two folders inside of it, nothing happens.  Any thoughts on why this is happening?\nThanks!\n\nA: This is a time machine backup that never completed.  The only way to get rid of it is to use Disk Utility and erase the drive and reformat it.  Sorry.\n\nA: Tony's answer isn't helpful for me so I’ll and provide another one.\nYou don't have to delete it. You only have to change the creation date. The Mac changes folders to a very specific date during certain operations in order to tell other applications not to modify the folder. If the original operation fails sometimes the date is not properly set back. Fixing this is most easily accomplished by using the terminal. A command such as\nSetFile -d \"$(date)\" *name_of_folder* \n\nwill fix it. I suspect this requires installing the extra command line tools from Apple but I don't have a fresh Mac to test that with.\n", "Q: Select specific tabs with Command-# key in Safari? Is there any way to mimic Chrome's behavior of selecting specific tabs with a Command-# combination (e.g., Command-1 selects Tab 1, Command-2 selects Tab 2, etc.)?\n\nA: It's not something you can do out-of-the-box, but there are ways to hack around that. This article will give details:\nhttp://www.andrewsavory.com/blog/2012/2423\nEssentially, the trick is to create a series of scripts and use something like FastScripts (or something like Alfred or LaunchBar) to run the scripts.\n", "Q: Mac security problems I'm having a problem installing an application (vuze). I've gone into the regular settings tab and I can't find anywhere to change any particular setting.\nI looked online and I just randomly see the same security tabs I found myself so...not sure what I have to change.\nAny ideas as to what I have to change in order to install this app?\nI'm new to the Mac game so not sure where I have to go.\nThanks in advance.\nEdit:\nThe message I get is \n\nYour security preferences allow installation of only apps from the mac app store and identified developers.\n\n\nA: A feature of OS X Mountain Lion is the ability to run only signed applications - that is, applications from Apple's app store - out of the box.  This is a configurable setting, however, and can be changed in the settings screen you seem to have already uncovered.  If you set the \"Allow applications downloaded from\" option to \"Anywhere\", your Mac should run applications downloaded from the internet as well.\n\nDo be aware of the security implications of this, and consider changing it only when necessary (and reverting the setting after you've installed the downloaded application which you trust).\nFor more information, and screen shots, see:\nhttp://www.maclife.com/article/howtos/how_tweak_settings_gatekeeper_mountain_lion\n\nA: Additionally, if you only want to run this one app at the moment, and leave the settings alone, Right Click on the app in the Finder and select Open.\n", "Q: Is Geotag Location Sent for iMessage Photos? When I send a photo to a friend via iMessage and not MMS, will the geotag location be sent along with the photo? If so, is there any way to remove the location before the photo is sent for privacy reasons.\n\nA: The location data is definitely sent with images sent over iMessage; I've saved an image sent by another person and itappeared on the \"Places\" tab in Photos. A trick you could use to remove the location data is to open the picture, take a screenshot (press home and sleep together) and then send the screenshot. The downside though is that it might be lower quality.\n\nA: There seems to be a bug/feature (at least in iOS 10.0.2) that prevents the geotag being applied when you take a photo from within iMessage. (You click the camera icon within iMessage and take a new photo.) If you attach a photo from your gallery that has a geotag, it will be sent as usual.\n", "Q: Spotlight's Privacy tab not backed up by Time Machine? I just did a full restore from Time Machine and noticed that my Spotlight Privacy tab was empty. Am I correct in assuming that this information is not backed up by Time Machine? I believe it's stored in /.Spotlight-V100/Store-V1/Exclusions.plist, and therefore it shouldn't be backed up because Time Machine doesn't back up a lot of the hidden files, especially in the root directory (/.fseventd being the example that comes to mind).\nSo is it true that it isn't backed up? And why isn't it stored in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.spotlight.plist then?\n\nA: Default Time Machine exclusions are in the file /System/Library/CoreServices/backupd.bundle/Contents/Resources/StdExclusions.plist\nIn 10.7.5 this file has a section named:\nPathsExcluded\nWhich contains:\n/.Spotlight-V100\nSo it is very likely that /.Spotlight-V100/Store-V1/Exclusions.plist will not be backed up by Time Machine.\nI don't know where the \"Spotlight Privacy tab\" preferences are stored.\n", "Q: How hard is the glass on Retina MacBook Pro I haven't got a screen protector for my MacBook Pro, and I am wondering just how easy it is to get a scratch on it?

If so, I might consider not getting a screen protector at all.\nAnyone with some experience?\nUpdate:\nAfter a year of testing, albeit I've replaced the upper component including display and the casing, I will say it is reasonably strong. Mine is the first-generation one, but I would imagine all future model is just as good.\n\nA: As you can read on: http://www.anandtech.com/show/5998/macbook-pro-retina-display-analysis\nthe glass is not the same as on the usual MBP but instead created using two layers of glass.\nBut the thing is the new Retina MBP does not have the cover glass. That does mean that if you scratch it in a way you are scratching the real LCD and not just a cover glass which would be the case if you scrach the display on a MBP.\nHope you can decide from that whether or not you should use a screen protector. \n\nA: I have an older version macbook pro. The anti glare version which also does not has this glass glossy layer. \nGot this MBP in early 2011 and been using it daily. In and out my bag, even dropped it 2 times and there are bumbs along the body. But the screen is still in perfect condition.

This will not require me to separately download and install these software. This should be similar to installation of the iLife along with the OS installation from the DVDs which came with Macbooks.\n\nA: You could do a clean install of OSX on a drive, install your base software, and set up any user accounts you use by standard (or just one \"admin\" account). Then use a tool like Disk Utility to copy that install over to a USB drive as a DMG file (in disk utility you use the backup/restore tool).\nOr you can just install the OS on that thumb drive and use Carbon Copy Cloner to clone it to any systems you need it on.\nNaturally you would need to follow all the terms of the EULA and not install this on anyone's machine who asks. \n\nA: Since hacking the actual install process is quite painful in terms of time and knowledge required, most people image rather than do the work to change the actual OS installer.\nFor this, you will want to use a packaging / deployment tool if you do this professionally. Here are three in terms of decreasing cost (and total functionality):\n\n\n*\n\n*JAMF's Casper Suite\n\n*OS X Server's NetInstall\n\n*DeployStudio\nYou can also, just use Disk Utility or another tool to clone a drive and remove the parts you don't want on the standard image. There are lots of tools and ways to accomplish your basic task, so choosing a workflow often depends on what else you need and how often you will be imaging.

Then it puts your query into the specified search engine and displays the results. \nYou could, too, edit the host file, redirecting form any of the default search engines to the one you want, but that wont be so neat. \n", "Q: Airport Extreme suffering wildly inconsistent speeds between 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz I have an Airport Extreme (will find actual version number later, as it's not able to tell from Airport Utility any more) that runs a 2.4 and 5 ghz network.  The 5Ghz one is almost always fast, but the 2.4Ghz one can produce some woeful speeds.  The following screenshots showing me using my ISPs speedtest tool from the same iMac on each network:\n\n\nI'm simply at a loss as to how to start troubleshooting this.  It usually works fine, but sometimes is so bad I cannot even connect to it.  The faster connection is pretty close to my maximum, so I'm happy with that - if I plug in direct via a cable it's usually similar to this.\nIt doesn't matter how far from the router I am, if it's decided to be slow, there is nothing I can see to either fix or troubleshoot it.  The latest 7.6.1 firmware is on the AE, and it does not show any errors or warnings.\n\nA: You are suffering from network congestion. Channel 11 is a very common channel and most 2.4GHz routers ship with that channel default. There are simply too many routers using channel 11 around your house. \nHowever, not many people in your neighbourhood are using 5GHz channels, so that is free from network congestion.\nThe solution to this problem will be to change your 2.4GHz channel from 11 to something else. \n\nA: If you've got a mac, you can see which channels are running on other nearby wifi networks. Just go to 'About This Mac' (apple menu) and click more info. Click 'System Report' and select Network - Wi- Fi from the left hand pane. In the interfaces section you'll your current network, then all other local wifi networks complete with channel and mode. Really handy tool for finding a free channel. 11 used a lot near me for 2.4Ghz and changing this made a real difference.\n", "Q: Aperture : unreadable JPEG on Mountain Lion After upgrading to Mountain Lion, some pictures in my Aperture library are unreadable. Aperture says the format isn't supported.\nI made some test and noticed that even the Finder, QuickLook or Preview can't read the picture either. However, Photoshop and Xee open it just fine.\nIt appears that system libraries can't read those pictures. With this in mind, I tried to take a faulty file to a Lion machine, and Aperture, Finder, QuickLook and Preview can open it without trouble. So, it's Mountain Lion related.\nNot all my pictures are concerned, just some of them (but enough to care, and maybe many more : I have to open them to notice they can't be read) and I couldn't find common properties such as the camera, the import tools or something like that.

I work as a student here and trying to help to fix the Mac environment. I might use the wrong terminology at times but I try to be as clear as possible. \nAssume we have a bunch of users with windows network accounts that they only ever used in our windows domain (we use AD). Now they start using Mac (joined to the domain) and we wanted to have a default profile that every user gets the first time he logs in with his network account with a preset background and lets say a shortcut on the desktop.\nWhat would we have to do that a user that logs in on a mac the first time that a copy of our default profile is used and then stored in his personal network folder.\n\nA: Have you looked into creating a local user template?

The problem now is how to deploy that user template to every new mac, but that's easily solved by other means (you can create a package and distribute it via ARD/munki/Casper, you can use puppet - which you should do anyway).\nMind you that every change to the User template will only affect new users; existing users have to be managed by other ways too (MCX via augmented AD schema, for example, is what we use).\n", "Q: Mirroring iPad to Apple TV using local router and using data connection? I have a iPad 3 or the new iPad and it's 3G. I plan on using this at trade shows so I can mirror what's on my iPad to the TV using Apple TV. We'll be using a local router instead of wi-fi because it's a fortune to purchase internet at shows. My question is once I access an app that requires 3g connection will I lose my connection to Apple TV?\n\nA: If your cellular network allows you can turn on the “personal hotspot” feature on iPad and connect Apple TV to that network. Then you can AirPlay the content to Apple TV (not mirroring) and at the same time use the cellular 3G network for internet. \n\nA: As far as I know the iPad can only have one IP-based connection at a time. That is either local Wifi or 3G. I am not exactly sure if you will loose the AppleTV connection or you won't be able to access the internet, but I sure you won't be able to have both.\nYou might want to try to bring another iPhone or iPad and use it's Personal Hotspot Feature. You would then connect the AppleTV and your new iPad to this Personal Hotspot Wifi.\nPlease note that the 3G is usually very crowded at trade shows, because you are not the only one using it ;-)\n", "Q: How to replace Mac OS X utilities with GNU core utilities? I found there is some differences between the utility command I used on the mac OSX and linux. I want to make my experience united. \nHow could I replace all my mac utilities with GNU utilities?\n\nA: Besides brew install coreutils, you may also need to install some other packages, such as gnu-sed, grep:\nbrew install findutils\nbrew install gnu-indent\nbrew install gnu-sed\nbrew install gnutls\nbrew install grep\nbrew install gnu-tar\nbrew install gawk\n\nNote that the --with-default-names option is removed since January 2019, so each binary has to be added to the path if they are to be used without the g prefix. \nOld reference (when --with-default-names was available): http://www.topbug.net/blog/2013/04/14/install-and-use-gnu-command-line-tools-in-mac-os-x/\n\nA: This adds symlinks for GNU utilities with g prefix to /usr/local/bin/:\nbrew install coreutils findutils gnu-tar gnu-sed gawk gnutls gnu-indent gnu-getopt grep\n\nSee brew search gnu for other packages. If you want to use the commands without a g prefix add for example /usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin before other directories on your PATH.\n$ brew info coreutils\ncoreutils: stable 8.21\nhttp://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils\nDepends on: xz\n/usr/local/Cellar/coreutils/8.20 (208 files, 9.4M)\n/usr/local/Cellar/coreutils/8.21 (210 files, 9.6M) *\nhttps://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/commits/master/Library/Formula/coreutils.rb\n==> Caveats\nAll commands have been installed with the prefix 'g'.\n\nIf you really need to use these commands with their normal names, you\ncan add a \"gnubin\" directory to your PATH from your bashrc like:\n\n    PATH=\"/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:$PATH\"\n\nAdditionally, you can access their man pages with normal names if you add\nthe \"gnuman\" directory to your MANPATH from your bashrc as well:\n\n    MANPATH=\"/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnuman:$MANPATH\"\n\n\nA: I'm not sure that I would recommend replacing them; however, you can install them to a different path and utilize them that way.  Overall, if you are coming from Linux and would like access to more \"generic\" *nix utilities, and a system similar to apt, then I would recommend looking into Macports:\nhttp://www.macports.org\nIt allows, for example, using the latest \"generic\" GCC, as opposed to/in addition to Apple's included GCC, just as an example.\n\nA: As an alternative to setting the PATH and MANPATH environment variables (which I would actually recommend), it is also possible to symlink binaries to an existing PATH location like this:\nYou need to know where Homebrew installs coreutils binaries.\n/usr/local/opt/coreutils/bin\n\nThe /usr/local/opt directory is where Homebrew stores relatively static files that are unlikely to change between updates.\nThen you can create symbolic links from there to a location that is already on your PATH. It must be a path that is loaded early on PATH, because the PATH is searched on a first-come, first-serve basis. /usr/local/bin is a good choice based on looking at echo $PATH.\nwhich sha256sum # prove it is not on PATH\nln -s /usr/local/opt/coreutils/bin/sha256sum /usr/local/bin/\nwhich sha256sum # prove it is on PATH\n\nThis way, it would almost as easy to create symbolic links. In some cases, like when you want tighter control, it is a good option rather than adding an entire directory to your PATH and MANPATH.\n\nA: I've written a script to do exactly this!  The script can be viewed here (or below).

How can I fix this?\n\nA: Unfortunately, this issue is rooted within iOS itself. Your phone automatically caches contacts for messages so that they can quickly be accessed when you're typing in a name or number, rather than querying the contacts app every time. \nThe only solution I have found to this is a full factory reset.\nThe reason being that data from the Messages app can only be changed by the phone itself, because of the nature of iOS, therefore the only way to force the phone to overwrite the caching in the messages app is to force the phone to overwrite the data in all of its apps.\n", "Q: how to store Time Machine backups on NFS and keep metadata? There is a Mac OS 10.7 (Lion) desktop, it stores Time Machine backups on a separate partition. Also there is an Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise) server with NFS daemon running, it exports a /BACKUP disk. This disk is mounted by Mac OS desktop and I'd like to copy Time Machine backups to this network disk. Which tool shell I use to store backups properly with all associated metadata, hfs extended attributes and forks? \n\nA: If you're explicitly looking to make a copy of the existing backups (a backup of the backups), you will need to make a disk image with Disk Utility. Time Machine uses hardlinked directories which are only supported by HFS+, so you need HFS+ in a container.\nYou'd be much better off running netatalk on the Ubuntu server, which will share the disk over AFP, allowing Time Machine to back up directly to it.

It works by encapsulating the standard ISO9660 CD filesystem within a partition, so that it will work unmodified if written to a USB/hard disk.\nThis patch/bug report discusses a problem in the way isohybrid sets GPT UUIDs, causing Disk Utility/OS X to fail to recognize the hybrid filesystem and consequently, failing to mount it. Hopefully it will be fixed at some point, making future Ubuntu hybrid ISOs compatible with Disk Utility.\nAlternative to extract/explore Ubuntu ISOs on OS X: Keka\nKeka is an open-source OS X frontend to the p7zip package, which is able to view and extract ISOs in addition to a myriad of other archive management features. While it won't let you \"mount\" the Ubuntu ISO on its own, it should let you view the ISO filesystem and extract what you need.\n\nA: This problem appears to be with Mountain Lion OS.

You can read all about it at https://wiki.mozilla.org/Apps …\n\nWebRunner\nPrism – MozillaWiki refers to Chromeless and WebRunner. \nFrom Salsitistas - Salsita Software: \n\n… Matthew Gertner\n  CEO and Founder\n… Before Salsita, Matthew led the development of a Mozilla Labs project called Prism (later WebRunner), a \"single-site browser\" that enabled users to turn web apps into desktop apps …\n\nhttp://www.salsitasoft.com/webrunner/ no longer presents the WebRunner page. There's a February 2011 copy in the Internet Archive Wayback Machine. \n\nA: Natifier does precisely this, for any app, for free, open source.\nhttps://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier\n\nA: In Safari, add the website you're viewing as a bookmark, either to your bookmark bar, or the bookmark menu.\n\n\n*\n\n*Click Bookmarks -> Show All Bookmarks\n\n*Select the option you chose (bookmark bar or menu)\n\n*Drag the bookmark to your desktop\n\n*You'll see a file with the name of your bookmark.  Double-click that, and you're set.\n\n\nA: There's no built-in OS X behaviour that exactly matches that of iOS, but you can use what's often referred to as a site-specific browser to turn sites into OS X apps.\nFluid\nFluid lets you turn sites into single apps that appear like any other OS X app — in their own windows, with separate dock icons. Pretty useful for web apps like Gmail, but you can use for on pretty much any site. It's free, but for $4.99 you get some extra features.\nMailplane\nLike Fluid, but specifically for Gmail. Since it's specific to Gmail, it's a bit more finely tuned, with toolbar buttons for the usual sorts of mail app actions. $24.95, with a  30 day free trial.\nAutomator\nIf you don't want a third party app, you can make a very basic site-specific browser using Automator. There's a good article from Andy Ihnatko on the subject, but the short version is:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Automator, create a new Application.\n\n*Add a Get Specified URLs action, and enter the URL of the page you want.\n\n*Add a Website Popup action.\n\n*Save it.\n\n\nThat will give you a standalone app you can run to get a browser for a specific site. But it's quite limited compared to solutions like Fluid or Mailplane — as the name suggests, it's more of a popup than a standalone app. \n\nA: You can create a browser chrome-free version of a page by turning it into a dashboard widget.  ( full instructions here: http://www.iclarified.com/entry/index.php?enid=273).\nCreating a Browser Widget on OSX\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the desired page in Safari. Go to file, then \"Open in Dashboard\"\n\n*Select the portion of the page that you'd like to be visible in the\n\n*widget, then press \"Add\". This will now appear as an interactive\n\n*widget, free of browser chrome, on your dashboard.\n\n\nThis maybe isn't exactly what you want but it's similar behavior.\n\nA: Google Chrome Apps, and Chrome App Launcher\n\n… I think Chrome is able to do something like this (Fluid) natively on Windows -- I wonder if feature parity for the mac version is on its way.\n\nMaybe this: \nGoogle Chrome Blog: A new breed of Chrome Apps, now available for Mac (2013-12-11)\nHighlights: \n\nA few months ago … Chrome Apps … today, you can access these apps\n  on any computer with Chrome …\n… offline … update automatically … sync to any computer where you're\n  signed into Chrome … behave and feel just like native software … by\n  name in the Spotlight search …\n… Chrome App Launcher …\n\nFrom an Internet Archive Wayback Machine copy of the page: \n\n", "Q: Clean install a Macbook without another Mac A friend of mine recently bought a new laptop and passed me his old Macbook Pro 6,2. I think he had Lion on it, but the installation CD has been long lost.\nI put in a new disk (he kept the original one), but how do I install OS X now?\nCommand+R gets me into Internet Recovery, but asks for an Apple ID (well, I registered for one). Then it complained the Apple ID was not used on iTunes (well, I loaded iTunes on my Windows laptop and set up the account, added the credit card details, etcetera, I even registered the serial number to my Apple ID on the website).\nNow it tells me that my Apple ID has not purchased Mountain Lion, but will not let me buy it from there, nor can I do it from iTunes. According to this Apple support question, you have to use \n\none of your personal authorized Macs\n\nWell, I don't have another Mac! How am I supposed to do this?\n\nA: This is an interesting situation.  If you have access to an Apple Store, I suspect that going to them would be the easiest way to resolve the problem.  Otherwise, if you have access to a Mac even temporarily, you should be able to sign in on the App Store using your Apple ID, and purchase Mountain Lion that way.  From here, I'm not sure if you'll be able to install Mountain Lion using Internet Recovery, because it is likely for Lion and not Mountain Lion (and I don't know if the Lion Internet Recovery supports Mountain Lion), however, from here, if you download the image, there are various tutorials that you can follow to either burn the installer to a DVD, or copy it to a USB flash drive, for instance: http://lifehacker.com/5928780/how-to-burn-os-x-mountain-lion-to-a-dvd-or-usb-flash-drive\nAs these are not officially supported solutions, my suggested option would be a visit to an Apple store.\n", "Q: Pressing the control key with AppleScript I use Voice Over and Dragon Dictate. I have figured out how to make Dragon Dictate press Control-Option-A, which makes Voice Over read a page of text, and now I would like to figure out how to tell Voice Over to stop reading through Dragon Dictate. The trouble is that the Voice Over keystroke is just Control. I have never been able to find any AppleScript key code for this.\nOn the same note, whenever I read about keystrokes in AppleScript, I get the impression that I'm always expected to press some other key along with the control, the command or the option modifier key. But what if I just want to press one modifier key through a program like Dragon Dictate?\n\nA: If you need to do something and hold it down, try something like this:\n                tell application \"System Events\"\n                    tell process \"Photoshop\"\n                        option key down\n                    end tell\n                end tell\n                DO OTHER STUFF HERE\n                tell application \"System Events\"\n                    tell process \"Photoshop\"\n                        option key up\n                    end tell\n                end tell\n\n\nA: This might work for you:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    keystroke control\nend tell\n\n\nA: There is a little app called Key Codes, which states that the key code for the control key is 65535 or 0xffff.\n\nA: keystroke control didn't work for me, but the key code of the left control is usually 59.\ndelay 1\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    key code 59\nend tell\n\n", "Q: How to tell what time I sent a text? Is there any way to find out when exactly an un-timestamped chat was sent?\nMy friend Max swears I didn't promptly inform him of my whereabouts this past weekend. I remember the exchange differently. \nA  screenshot:\n\nIs there any way to know for sure? \n(I am using iOS 6 on an iPhone 4S.)\n\nA: One way of doing this:\nDelete the texts above the un-timestamped text until the relevant message is assigned a timestamp. In this case you will just have to delete one message.\n", "Q: Can I \"restrain\" safari from using large % of CPU? Some websites make safari go crazy, and use 70% CPU! This causes everything else on this desktop to grind to a halt.\nIs there a way to restrict safari to never go beyond a certain amount of CPU?\n(btw - It's not just flash)\n\nA: Enable the Debug Menu in Safari. One of the commands is Pause Web Process, another is Crash Web Process. Or the web process can be quit (or Force Quit) in Activity Monitor or any similar app. \nAnd be sure to keep your Flash plugin current. Keep everything current/updated!\n\nA: It is not possible to set the CPU limit for websites, but it is possible to limit the plug ins and extensions.\nDisable things like\nJava\nand Flash Player\n.....\nor for more serious use\nEnable Safari’s Hidden Debug Menu\nQuit Safari\n\nLaunch the Terminal and enter the following defaults write command:\n\ndefaults write com.apple.Safari IncludeInternalDebugMenu 1\n\nRelaunch Safari\nThe “Debug” menu will be visible to the far right in Safari’s menubar choices. If you want to disable the menu, go back to the Terminal and type:\n\ndefaults write com.apple.Safari IncludeInternalDebugMenu 0\n\n\nA: There are a few extensions that can help you.\nClickToPlugin is a great extension as it lets you block any plugin you want. While plugins run in their own processes, they often tend to be poorly written resource hogs (I'm looking at You, Adobe Flash!).\nAny script blocker will do. There are several 3rd party scripts used by various websites that are not only annoying, they can also be huge resource hogs.\n", "Q: Mac Mail downloads my entire gmail account can i just get the last 30 days? Mac Mail every few days i find that it's downloading my entire account all over again. That's like 8 years work of email - which is really beginning to annoy me.\nCan I configure mail to only get recent mail?\n\nA: Apple's mail will get all the messages by design. There isn't a setting to tell it to stop after a certain volume of downloaded content or some message count or attachment count.\nYou'll find that altering the server settings if you can will be the only way to change the volume or number of messages.\nExchange has a setting to limit the number of messages and calendar items that sync. Gmail also has settings you can configure (under settings) for IMAP to download only the last 1000 mails. You can also exclude entire mailboxes and folders in Gmail to prevent them from ever being seen by an IMAP client such as Apple's OS X Mail or iOS mail apps.\nIf you can't alter your server settings, you may have to change the volume of messages you store in that email account.\n\nA: Thunderbird gives you this option. No server side config required.\n", "Q: How to update iPhone via iTunes without getting rid of apps that I purchased? I want to update my iPhone on iTunes but it says that it will delete all of the apps and media on my iPhone that I purchased.  I synced it but I don't know what to do next. It says it will only save my content.\n\nA: Make sure you have all your apps already loaded within your iTunes library. Then you can safely upgrade your iPhone via iTunes. At the end of the upgrade process iTunes will sync with your iPhone and will put back all your apps to your device.\n", "Q: Notification Center preferences shows duplicate apps I was running the Tweetbot for Mac Beta, and still had it installed when I installed the full release from the Mac App Store.\nNow I have 2 entries in my preferences for Notification Center, and I don't know which is which.  I have removed the Beta application, and only have the real thing installed, but oddly whereas the Beta had the 'Egg\" icon rather than the bird, both set of preferences use the bird icon.\nWhere does this preference pane get it's information about installed applications? How can I remove an app from the list?\n\n\nA: Open terminal and run this command:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user && pkill Finder\n\nOr, if you have OnyX utility app, go to \"Maintenance\" > \"Rebuild\" > check on \"LaunchServices\" (leave the other options unchecked) > execute\n", "Q: Java Plugin for Chrome on OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.2 I'm trying to use webex in Chrome.  To click on webex links, I need the java plugin.  However, it appears that a recent OS X Mountain Lion update removed the java plugin from my computer.\nWhen I try to install the java plugin in chrome, I see the following error:\n\nChrome does not support Java 7. Java 7 runs only on 64-bit browsers and Chrome is a 32-bit browser.\n\nIf you download Java 7, you will not be able to run Java content in Chrome and will need to use a 64-bit browser (such as Safari or Firefox) to run Java content within a browser. Additionally, installing Java 7 will disable the ability to use Apple Java 6 on your system.\n\nFine, so I try to download the Java 6 plugin instead, but it appears that Oracle has no Java 6 plugin.\nWhat gives?  How do I install the java plugin for Chrome?\n\nA: You are in luck, Apple released a \"fix\" for this issue:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT5559\nBasically Apple has provided some terminal commands that move the plug-in from the disabled folder to where it needs to be to work in Chrome.\nHowever you would be better off (read: SAFER!) by using the updated Java plugin from Oracle and a browser that can use that plugin, like Firefox or Safari.\n\nA: The Chromium project is working on it according to issue 18323, 115774 and 175129. So just give issue 18323 and issue 115774 a star to raise its importance for the Chromium developers.\n", "Q: How to stop messages from opening when I touch the icon When I only have one unread message (or all from the same person), it opens that thread when I open the Messages app. I don't want the thread to open automatically when I touch the message icon, and would rather it opens the list of message threads. What can I do to stop this automatic action of opening the thread? \n\nA: Silly answer: don't touch it.\nSensible answer: presume you are not wanting to send read receipts until you are ready? If so, note that it should return you to the same view you left it in, so to avoid this have a new conversation to a blank sender and select this conversation before minimising/quitting.\n\nA: They seem to have changed this behavior in ios 7.  It now goes directly to the list of messages rather than the latest new message.\n\nA: I have sometimes wondered about this behavior myself, and wish there was a way to change this. \nThe short answer is there is no way to configure this. \nI have used the notification center (iOS 5, iOS 6) as a bit of a workaround, but obviously this will depend entirely on what you want to do, and doesn't enable you to send new messages or reply to different threads. If you have a device with Siri, you may be able to use that as a bit of a workaround as well.\n\nA: Bit of a workaround, but if you go into Contacts, go into one and press Send Message, from there you can go back to the Message list and the new message will still be marked as unread.\n\nA: I hate this too. I just wait until a message from someone else comes in. Or I've used my email to send a message to my phone so it provides a secondary text.\n\nA: I have this problem to especially because when the read receipts are on, you dont want them to think that they are ignoring you...best thing ive found is to turn your read receipts off temporarily so you can look at it without them knowing then when you are ready to answer just go turn them back on.    \n", "Q: Getting the space key to act like the return key I come from a Windows background and I have gotten into the habit of hitting the Space key every time there's a popup on my screen that I want to close.  But on the Mac, it doesn't do anything, but hitting Return does.  Does anyone  know how I can get Mac to let the space key act like the Return key on modal dialogs?  I tried to find something in the Keyboard preferences but don't see anything related to popups.\n\nA: Press ctrl+F7 to enable Full Keyboard Access. This setting is also available in the System Preferences under the Keyboard preference pane:\n\nBy selecting 'All controls', you can tab around keyboard focus between the various widgets in dialog boxes, including buttons like OK or Cancel. It's slightly different from Windows, in that return is like pressing the fully highlighted button, while space is like pressing the selected / outlined button.\nThis image shows the difference between the two:\n\nIn this example, the Cancel button has focus (from tabbing) while OK is the default. So pressing space would select Cancel, while return would select OK.\nAnd for completeness, this one can be accepted by either space or return:\n\nIt's worth noting that some OS X dialog boxes (I've noticed this especially with dialogs asking whether it's OK to overwrite a file) will come up with, for example, Don't Overwrite as the default for return, and Do Overwrite as the focused item for space. This makes it a single key either way to do what you want, but you need to be sure you've got the right one!\n"]
