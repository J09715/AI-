["Q: How to transfer files from windows to Ubuntu instaled on VMware? I have Installed Backtrack(an Ubuntu based linux) on VMware and I have a file on main host(win 7) which I want to send to this virtual machine. What should I do?\n\nA: There are 2 ways 2 transfer file from windows to Linux (backtrack)\n1 . install ssh on backtrack and on windows Install filezilla \n then u can transfer file from windows to backtrack\n2 . install vmware guest tools & poweroff backtrack & share folder in Vmware \nas shown in pic \n\nadd folder from your windows & that will be Shared \nnow in start backtrack & login \nin terminal \nmount -t vmhgfs .host:/ /mnt/hgfs/\n\nthe shared folder will be in /mnt/hgfs/\nThrough ssh on backtrack (if not installed )\n sudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\nthen edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config\nset \"PermitRootLogin\" to \"yes\".\n\nsave & exit\n/etc/init.d/ssh restart\n\nthen ifconfig > check the ip address \n\nthen from windows open filezilla \n\nin host type the ip address of backtrack user name root password \"toor\" (if not changed)\n& then u can transfer file from windows to backtrack \n", "Q: On Win XP, Ubuntu One picks \"wrong\" homefolder I've installed UbuntuOne on a Win XP laptop connected to our company network. UbuntuOne doesn't let me sync folders on my local drive, but insists on me picking them from a network \"home\" folder which I don't use at all. Checking the settings, the UbuntuOne folder is however set  to \"always in sync\".\nAm I just misunderstanding the error message? Since I came to understand that nothing outside the UbuntuOne folder can currently be synced on a Windows system, shouldn't the message rather be telling me about the restriction to that folder - instead of: \"You can only choose folders on U:\\ \"?\nThanks for your help - I'm still a beginner with Ubuntu.\n\nA: Ubuntu One for Windows will only sync from your user's profile folder. We do have the intention of making it possible to sync from other folders.\n", "Q: How to see results after updating .gtkrc? I need to tweak my gtk2 theme. Currently I edit the gtkrc file, then go to System>Appearance>Customise, change the widgets to something else and then back again to see the effect.\nThis is slow and clumsy. Is there a command or something to trigger all gtk2+ windows to udpate? Or, is there a GUI editor where the results can be previewed immediately? (like firebug for gtk2?)\n\nA: I've used an app before that is like firebug for GTK, called Parasite but it can't update the widgets in the sense you are suggesting.\nYou could try something like:\nsudo compiz --replace &\n\nif you're using compiz, that is.\nAnother thing you could try would be to put the commands to change the theme in a script, and assign it to a keyboard shortcut. That way you could change your .gtkrc, hit the keyboard shortcut and watch as you save a minute of your life.\nI did a quick google search and found this thread on ubuntu forums.\nThe script would look something like this (assuming the theme you want to end up with is Ambiance, and the icon theme is ubuntu-mono-dark):\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#Change GTK theme:\ngconftool-2 --type=string -s /desktop/gnome/interface/gtk_theme Clearlooks\ngconftool-2 --type=string -s /desktop/gnome/interface/gtk_theme Ambiance\n\n#Change Metacity theme:\ngconftool-2 --type=string -s /apps/metacity/general/theme Clearlooks\ngconftool-2 --type=string -s /apps/metacity/general/theme Ambiance\n\n#Change Icons:\ngconftool-2 --type=string -s /desktop/gnome/interface/icon_theme gnome\ngconftool-2 --type=string -s /desktop/gnome/interface/icon_theme ubuntu-mono-dark\n\nYou may still need to close and re-open applications for the changes to take affect.\n\nA: Try The Widget Factory (in ubuntu repos). Install, then run with twf\nIt shows all the different widgets and you can select a theme from the menu. It's faster than the full theme change.\n\nA: If you're trying to change something on the panels, you can do:\n$ killall gnome-panel\n\nfor Ubuntu or\n$ killall xfce4-panel\n\nfor XUbuntu.\nI think Gnome will immediately restart the panels, but in Xfce, you'll have to restart them again:\n$ xfce4-panel\n\nI'd imagine it'd be the same with any other \"widget\" you're working on. Kill the process and restart it.\n", "Q: How do I install javahl _without_ pulling in all the openjdk stuff? On my linux box (oneiric, 64bit) I'm running Eclipse and java straight from the Eclipse/Oracle tarballs. I'd like to install the javaHL subversion libraries, which according to the subclipse wiki are packaged in the libsvn-java package, but if I do an\napt-get install libjava-svn\n\napt-get will pull down all sorts of dependencies related to openjdk, which I don't really care for. I'm not that familiar with apt-get too. Is there a way around this? Can I just install the shared libraries, without all the other stuff?\n\nA: download the lib-svn source package and build manually, in that case it wont download all dependecies by itself and you can avoid openjdk stuff.\nCheck this article on how to compile svn from sources\n\nA: According to this article I can just download the deb package and extract the files in the right location. In my case that's just \ncp $WHERE_I_EXTRACTED_THE_DEB/CONTENT/usr/lib/jni/* $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/amd64\n\nand no need to tell java where to look for libraries.\n", "Q: Ubuntu can't detect all windows drives as well as external drives Ubuntu has been running well on my dual boot system until today.

I find the Messaging Tray (the bottom bar) in GNOME Shell rather inconvenient. I'm looking for a way to disable it. KRSNA 2 ZED seems to have written an extension for doing just that, but I don't know how to install it. Any help would be appreciated.\nI'm using Ubuntu 11.10 32-bit.\n\nA: I just managed to hide the messaging tray.

But denNorske is right, Dropbox could be used too.  \nIt syncs files in the ~/Dropbox folder it creates, so to have it sync files that need to remain outside that location like configuration file, I believe you can create symlinks to them in ~/Dropbox and the Linux client will then sync the files correctly.  Create such symlinks on both computers to achieve the syncing you want.   The key is to determine which files/folders you need (which maybe someone else can supply).\n(Unless they're gconf settings or in some database that contains more than just the compiz or unity settings - you may not want to sync those between computers and change more than just compiz/unity settings.)\n", "Q: Package Operation Failed - Help Whenever I try to update or install programs I get the \"Package Operation Failed\" message.\nHere's whats it says in the details section:\ninstallArchives() failed: (Reading database ...\n(Reading database ... 5%\n(Reading database ... 10%\n(Reading database ... 15%\n(Reading database ... 20%\n(Reading database ... 25%\n(Reading database ... 30%\n(Reading database ... 35%\n(Reading database ... 40%\n(Reading database ... 45%\n(Reading database ... 50%\n(Reading database ... 55%\n(Reading database ... 60%\n(Reading database ... 65%\n(Reading database ... 70%\n(Reading database ... 75%\n(Reading database ... 80%\n(Reading database ... 85%\n(Reading database ... 90%\n(Reading database ... 95%\n(Reading database ... 100%\n(Reading database ... 242146 files and directories currently installed.)\nRemoving gparted ...\nProcessing triggers for bamfdaemon ...\nRebuilding /usr/share/applications/bamf.index...\nProcessing triggers for desktop-file-utils ...\nProcessing triggers for gnome-menus ...\nProcessing triggers for man-db ...\nProcessing triggers for hicolor-icon-theme ...\nSetting up couchdb-bin (1.0.1-0ubuntu17) ...\nuseradd: cannot lock /etc/passwd; try again later.\nadduser: `/usr/sbin/useradd -d /var/lib/couchdb -g couchdb -s /bin/bash -u 116 couchdb' returned error code 1.

Currently, I have Windows XP on one computer, and Ubuntu on another. I switch between the with a VGA box that allows me to switch which computer is connected to my monitor. For some reason, if I am viewing Windows XP while Ubuntu is booting, the screen will be black when I switch back over to it. I have waited 15 minutes on this screen, and nothing happened. I have also tried to \"wake it up\" by moving the mouse and using the keyboard. Ubuntu boots fine if it is connected to the monitor when it boots. Does anyone know what could be causing this?\nThe output of lspci -nn | grep VGA is:\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Intel Corporation 82915G/GV/910GL Integrated Graphics Controller [8086:2582] (rev 04)\n\nA: I would like to give an educated guess based upon my own experience with a video card that overheated causing Ubuntu to fail to load because it could not determine the correct screen resolution.\nWhen we install Ubuntu we are not required to set the screen resolution. Are we? So, how does the OS know the correct or optimum resolution of the monitor.\nThe OS interrogates the monitor to find the EDID. A quote from EDID Wikipedia\n\nExtended display identification data (EDID) is a data structure\n  provided by a digital display to describe its capabilities to a video\n  source (e.g. graphics card or set-top box). It is what enables a\n  modern personal computer to know what kinds of monitors are connected\n  to it. EDID is defined by a standard published by the Video\n  Electronics Standards Association (VESA). The EDID includes\n  manufacturer name and serial number, product type, phosphor or filter\n  type, timings supported by the display, display size, luminance data\n  and (for digital displays only) pixel mapping data.\n\nTo confirm this I quote Ubuntu wiki under the heading Adding Undetected Resolutions\n\nDue to buggy hardware or drivers, your monitor’s correct resolutions\n  may not always be detected. For example, the EDID data block queried\n  from your monitor may be incorrect.\n\nIn your case, when Ubuntu loads it cannot read the monitor's EDID block because you have not switched the monitor over to Ubuntu.\nThat switch box works by effectively unplugging the monitor from one machine and plugging it into an other machine. The switch that you turn physically cuts the cable from the VGA port on one machine and makes a connection to the VGA port on the other machine.\nI would guess that anyone booting Ubuntu without the monitor connected would have the same problem that you are having.\n", "Q: MySql is not starting xampp on ubuntu I have recently migrated to ubuntu and I have intalled Xampp for Ubuntu .. lampp\nas per the instructions mentioned on xampp website, i have installed the lampp\nlampp Installation\nAnd it was starting good.. when i changed the /opt/lampp permission mode to 777 by using from Terminal as chmod 777 /opt/lamp.\nAfter this when i start the lampp, it gives the below error in images in Terminal as well as web page error\nTerminal Error Image\n\nweb page error when i typed localhost/phpmyadmin it gives below error\n\nSo,\nhow can i revert the changes or \nhow can i start the mysql server service\n\nA: If you did a chmod 777 please do a \nchmod 775 /opt/lamp\n\nRegarding the error during startup...\nMySQL complains about my.cnf being world-writeable. MySQL does not use the config file if you change /opt/lamp/etc/my.cnf to **7. To fix that specific problem do a...\nchmod 644 /opt/lampp/etc/my.cnf\n\nand MySQL will use it again.\nRegarding permissions...\nFor directories 775 (or even 755) is more than enough and for files 664 (or even 644) is more than enough. Using 777 will let people from the whole world access your files where they can alter and execute those files.\nAnd a final note...\nI see XAMPP being mentioned in your image.

I am going to start making Ubuntu tutorial videos again but this time around I would like to know what is the best format for uploading videos to my personal blog or to YouTube. In the past I was using xdiv with avi container. But now I want to share the community's experience with this and I am looking for:\n\n\n*\n\n*The best or most recommended/used program to edit videos that comes with Ubuntu or has a PPA for Ubuntu.\n\n*The best codec that has a very good quality but at the same time makes the video's size smaller. As point 1, it should come with Ubuntu or have a PPA for it. This is a tough one for me since I am looking for a good one that shows good quality and good size. It has always been difficult for me to find the ideal one.\n\n*The best format or container for this type of videos. I get confused between ogv, mp4, mpg and which one offers better stuff.\nIn all 3 cases the software should be open source and I will be using/recommending Firefox and Chrome for the websites, so it will be limited to the technology that these 2 browsers can work with (NOT IE friendly).\nThe videos (if this helps in some way) will be captured with gtkrecordmydesktop since I find it delivers the best quality of several I have tested. If I am wrong please do correct me. After the video is made I will start using the editor and codecs asked in the 3 questions above.\nWhat I will be capturing is most of the time the desktop but also some screens of Virtualbox for showing 11.10 and 12.04 installation procedures. Apart from this some games running in Wine and some games running natively will also be showed (0 AD, UFO:AI..). I do not know if this will affect what codec will be recommended but I put this here as a bonus just in case.\nAny help will be appreciated. Thank you.\n\nA: I also use gtk-recordMyDesktop for recording screencasts with audio and it already meets most of your requirements.\nThe result of recordmydesktop is an Ogg Theora file (for example screencast.ogv). I usually do not have to edit it and just put it on a website. The HTML code for embedding the video looks like this:\n<video src=\"screencast.ogv\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" controls>Video is not supported by your browser</video>\nThis way the video can be displayed on the client browser without any plugins if they have at least Firefox 3 according to Wikipedia but I have only tested it with Firefox >= 8. I do not know if this works with Chrome and/or Youtube, sorry.\nWe use it for tutorial purposes in our company and I often record the screen of VirtualBox or a remote desktop session. It even works with low quality settings of 30 or 40 for video, capturing 7 frames per second. With this setting I get a filesize of about 1 MB for 1 minute of audio/video.\nIt works out of the box on Ubuntu 11.10 after installing gtk-recordmydesktop.\n\nA: I've used XVidCap Screen Capture and the quality is excellent, REALLY close to what I was seeing on my screen during the capture.\nIts default settings are DivX codec (in an MPEG file) and MP3 audio. The video quality is set to 90%.\nThe resulting files are really small (something like 15Mb for multiple minutes of recording at 1600*900).\nIf you want to use opensource codecs, there is OGG for audio and XVid for video.\nNotice, however, that when you upload to a website like youtube, the format doesn't really matter, as long as it's readable by youtube. Youtube will convert your video to its own chosen format (which is FLV afaik).\nTherefore, you should be focussing on quality and maybe size (depending on your upload speed).\nOddfellow mentionned above how to embed your video using HTML.\nAllow me to add two notes to that:\n\n\n*\n\n*It means you'll be hosting the video. I'm not sure if your blog allows you to do that, but hosting videos (especially multiple ones), consumes fairly much server bandwidth. If you have a hosting provider (free or paid), be sure to check the available bandwidth, and also make sure your host isn't too slow (or people will be getting lag during playback).\n\n*The code shown by Oddfellow is HTML5, the next generation of HTML which allows, among others, video embedding. Although you stated explicitely you will only support the most recent firefox and chrome, I would not recommend depending on HTML5 just yet. It's still unsupported by many browsers. And while the  tag is supported by Chrome and FF, AFAIK, there isn't one single browser that completely supports the whole HTML5 specification.\nThat said, you might be much better off simply uploading to youtube, and embedding the youtube video's into your website. It's really easy: once uploaded, on the youtube video page, there's an embed button that gives you the HTML code which you'll have to insert into your website.\nUpload your videos with at least a 1080p resolution and youtube will give you a great quality when 1080p is selected: perfect for Ubuntu tutorial videos!\n", "Q: Super + w & shortcut application access Super + W is great. But after all windows get displayed, I have to either click on one with my mouse or use the arrow keys. It would be better if each window turned into a letter, so I could access it quickly. \nAnyone know if this is possible? Thanks.\n\nA: It is possible if you are a programmer and can patch the Unity Compiz plugin to achieve it. Otherwise, there is no existing solution that can provide that feature.\nApparently though, the Super-w Spread Mode in Ubuntu 12.04 will support selecting displayed Windows by number (eg '1' for the left-most window, '2' for the next window to the right, etc).\n", "Q: Better sound with ALC883 possible?

I understand that it is a tool to deploy and manage huge cloud servers but can it just as well be used on a single server to utilize the simplicity of charms?\n\nA: Simple Deployments\nJuju can (from version 1.18) deploy to any Ubuntu Server with OpenSSH via manual provisioning:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://jujucharms.com/docs/2.0/clouds-manual\nThe basic process is you register your machine(s) with Juju via: juju add-machine ssh:10.1.1.2 for example.

Juju with MAAS lets you treat a group of physical machines as a cloud, essentially.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://jujucharms.com/docs/2.0/clouds-maas\nLocal (Container) deployments\nYou can also run charms directly on your workstation, which we call a local environment. You run each separate service unit as different LXC container on a single machine (Ubuntu only). \n\n\n*\n\n*https://jujucharms.com/docs/2.0/clouds-LXD\n", "Q: Why is Ubuntu permissive with outgoing connections by default? I am pretty newbie to Linux, as most of computers for resources in my school use Linux, I just installed Ubuntu to learn.\nBy default iptables and ufw sets policy as under:\nIPTABLES -P INPUT DROP\nIPTABLES -P FORWARD DROP\nIPTABLES -P OUTPUT ACCEPT\n\nufw default deny (default incoming).\nIn both cases, Linux all distros trust all applications including fames ftp, smtp, SSH, mail and all others allowing for outgoing traffic without notice or without concent. Which in turn leaves all 0-to-65535 ports open for outgoing traffic for all installed applications. \nFurthermore, there is no particular application control that which particular application like firefox, opera or other are granted access to internet in any firewalls so far I tried. All installed application can freely enjoys all freedom to access internet.\nIn all major distros netstat is tempered to provide minimum information.  \nMy concern is security....\nHow much security is offered by the OS (Linux), which allows all outgoing traffic and just blocks the access to incoming?\n\nA: This sort of discussion comes up from time to time and IMO the best answer is that Linux is not Windows and at this time the current firewall policy is considered sufficient by the Ubuntu developers / security team as, by default, there are no open ports.\nSee : https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/Policies\nThe utility of a firewall in the sort of concerns you have (malware or a cracker using the system for unauthorized activity has been debated but the consensus opinion is that it is not need by default (as you can see). That does not mean everyone agrees with the decision mind you ;)\nYou are free to disagree with the decision and either change your policies or send a mail to the security team if you wish.\nAs far as an application level firewall as exists in some Windows applications, suffice it to say it is not so easy to implement and although I have seen a few attempts to code such an application level firewall over the years, but, IMO, the technology is not there yet.\nYou might want to look at leopardflower I do not use it and can not vouch for how well it works.\nAnother, older attempt was tuxguardian, but as you can see it is no longer maintained and I would not advise you use it.\nThe closest thing in Ubuntu would be Apparmor.\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppArmor\nNo it is not precisely what you are asking for, it is just as close as it gets.\nOtherwise, IMO, this discussion is age old, if you search the Ubuntu Forums you will find a number of discussion, and also\nhttp://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/4137\nGood luck, I hope this post at least provides you with some information, although it is probably not the answer you were looking for.\n\nA: Outgoing connections require that they be originated from inside the firewall.  In most cases this will be a user initiated activity.  Configuring a firewall with a closed policy for outgoing traffic is a difficult undertaking and requires maintenance for each new service or Internet client which is installed.  Depending on the installed software and use of the system, it is possible the resulting firewall will be almost completely open on all but the privileged ports.\nAn open policy for outgoing provides a reasonably secure firewall without requiring a significant skill level on the part of the user.   The input and and forwarding policies provide a strong barrier against outside attacks and make the system relatively invisible to external probes.\nThere are programs which require all more most of the unprivileged ports to be open.  This leaves only the secure ports (<1024) that can be secured.  As on Linux(UNIX)-based system these ports require root privileges before they can be opened, there are few programs that can use them.  \nConfiguring a firewall with a closed policy for outgoing traffic is a difficult undertaking.   Firewall rules are required for each service accessed, and in some case the client software or network stack may need special configuration.   Many clients default to using ephemeral ports to outgoing access for TCP, UPD, or both as both source and destination  The ephemeral port range is effectively all ports over 1024 for forwarding routers and remote addresses.\n\nA: Why are all outgoing ports open? If you don't trust the applications you are running, then you have bigger problems: There is already an app running, which could do bad things. If you started this application it could remove all files in your $HOME.....\nYou should trust the applications that are running, if not you have bigger problems than open ports.\nIf you want to browse the internet, outgoing ports to 80 (http) need to be open. If you have an application that you don't trust, this application could use port 80 as destination an pass your firewall....\nIf you still want to control outgoing connections, you can do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disallow outgoing packages.\n\n*run a http-proxy with password access in your LAN. \n\n*Run a Mailserver in your LAN.\n\n*But many applications won't work anymore (Voice over IP, Skype, Chat ....)\n\n\nBut an evil application could read your firefox proxy settings, use the password and send information to an more evil server....\nIt is hard to control outgoing traffic. I would not do it.\n", "Q: Bridge Laptop's Ethernet to Wireless The laptop wirelessly connects to my router, while the desktop is connected to the laptop with an ethernet wire.\nThe desktop successfully can use the internet if I set the connection to be shared on the laptop.\nThe problem is, I need the laptop to forward the desktop's packets across the link unmodified, so the desktop is on the same network as the router.\nThe desktop needs its IP assigned by the router, so that I can access it from another computer as \"192.168.1.8\".\n\nA: You'll need to add something like this to your /etc/networking/interfaces file:\nauto br0                   #Creates the bridge\niface br0 inet dhcp        #Tells bridge to do dhcp\nbridge_ports wlanX ethY    #Ties bridge between two ports\n\nYou'll need to find the correct X and Y by using ifconfig and iwconfig. \nsource \n", "Q: How to set Default Web Browser, Mail Client, Video Player & Music Player in the system I am trying to find the option that sets, for the whole system the default Web Browser, Mail Client, Video Player and Music Player instead of having to do it for each type of file.

UBIFS does not work with what many people considers flash devices like flash-based hard drives, SD cards, USB sticks, etc.; because those devices use a block device emulation layer called FTL (Flash Translation Layer) that make they look like traditional block-based storage devices to the outside world. UBIFS instead is designed to work with flash devices that do not have a block device emulation layer and that are handled by the MTD subsystem and present themselves to userspace as MTD devices. \nThe same applies for JFFS2 -- UBIFS is more of a new/improved drop-in for JFFS2. So if you a trying to install UBIFS/JFFS2/LogFS at USB Flash drive it make no sense. In case flash devices that do not have a block device emulation layer like router or smartphone it does make sense.\nBut I guess you not going to install Ubuntu Server on top of your router/smartphone or something like that.\nHope it'll help.\n", "Q: How secure is an encrypted LUKS filesystem? I recently installed 11.10 on a fresh disk using entire disk encryption.  Can someone tell me how secure the encryption algorithm is?  Has there been any recent breaches with said algorithm?  I use a 36 character random passphrase so I know thats not a weak link.  What are the chances my client's data could be compromised if the hard drive was stolen?\n\nA: Here are two resources about attacks on this type of file system that seem to be interesting: \nhttp://dx.eng.uiowa.edu/dave/luks.php\nhttp://www.jakoblell.com/blog/2013/12/22/practical-malleability-attack-against-cbc-encrypted-luks-partitions/\nIn short, the latter document describes that it is possible to inject a remote code execution backdoor into the LUKS setup created by the Ubuntu 12.04 installer. This attack only needs access to the encrypted hard drive (it does not rely on manipulating the unencrypted /boot partition or the BIOS).\nWhile the attack is pretty bad, it does not apply to modern LUCS setups. The attack can only be applied if the block mode is CBC, for example if the cipher aes-cbc-essiv is used. Modern setups use other block modes, like the cipher aes-xts-plain64 (see this article on the ArchLinux wiki).\nTo check which cipher is used by your setup, run:\nsudo cryptsetup status [device]\n\nwhere [device] is your mapping, like /dev/mapper/sda3_crypt.\n\nA: Yes, it is secure. Ubuntu uses AES-256 to encrypt the disk volume and has a cypher feedback to help protect it from frequency attacks and others attacks that target statically encrypted data. \nAs an algorithm, AES is secure and this has been proved by crypt-analysis testing. The weakness actually lies within the cypher and the software to pass it the keys. Specifically lies in the keystore (which is stored in the header of the volume), the keystore is secured by a passphrase. Passphrases are of course open to some attacks such as dictionary/brute force (if this was successful, it would decrypt the keystore). Using long \"complex\" non-word passwords would reduce the chance of this happening.\nThe only other possibility to decrypt is using recording devices or social engineering to determine your passphrase.\nIn short, your computer is reasonably safe unless you are subject to serious organised cyber crime or Government investigation!\n\nA: I have created a Windows program that will perform a dictionary attack on Luks volumes. http://code.google.com/p/luks-volume-cracker/\nIts slow by design, trying around 3 keys a second. Other dictionary attacks will be similarly slow, so unless you've chosen an easy passphrase the weakness will not be the algorithm.\nBe aware of key stealing from memory, and caching of files, however.\n\nA: LUKS encryption method is potentially unsafe, at least in the way it handles the encryption process. Lets give it the benefit of the doubt the algorithms are safe and we can compare them to algorithm code that has been audited. Putting that aside, as a user, you aren't allowed to create a key that encrypts your data.  That's like telling someone, hey, I'll make up a password that encrypts your bank account, not you.  But, I'll be so nice to let you make up a password that encrypts my password. There is the security weakness with LUKS as I see it.\nLUKS uses a Master Key or what they call a Unified Key. This key is generated using the 'random' and 'urandom' programs installed on the Linux system. If these programs are compromised in some way, your Master Key becomes weak. No matter how strong your password is, the Master Key creation method creates a vulnerability.\nCompare this to TrueCrypt who mysteriously shutdown during the biggest leaks against US spying. TrueCrypt volumes that have been properly encrypted according to TrueCrypts documentation, have not been broken into.  The government threw all the tax payers money at TrueCrypt volumes and could not break them. This is legal record. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueCrypt#Legal_cases (TrueCrypt is 4th Amendment Approved)\nTrueCrypt allows the user to create the Master Key. During volume creation TrueCrypt allows the user to move the mouse around in the TrueCrypt interface for as long as they like which randomly manipulates the value of the Master Key being created. That puts the power of chaos in the users hand where it belongs. LUKS does not allow this easy programmatic feature.\n", "Q: Create yaffs2 file system on Ubuntu Server 11.10 How do I create and mount a yaffs2 file system?\n\nA: yaffs/yaffs2 is not yet supported in the mainline linux kernel, so you will need to compile it yourself.\nThere are detailed directions here : http://tjworld.net/wiki/Linux/Kernel/SimulateNandMtdDevice\nYou will likely be able to mount a yaffs/yaffs2 file system, but I am not sure you will be able to install into it or boot it with grub.\n", "Q: FTP over ssh hangs on \"Connection established: Waiting for Welcome Message\" I have looked far and wide and have not quite found the answer.

Until this version of Ubuntu, I hadn't experienced any problems with sound too.\nNow I have found that when I use a USB headphone and mic, I have to go into my Sound Settings menu (via a click on the volume icon in the upper right corner, or via the system settings menu) and manually change the hardware, input, and output settings to the USB setting.  Then, when I remove the USB headphones, I frequently need to change all three settings back to the Internal Audio setting.\nOnce I make these settings, everything works fine and I have full volume control.  However, sometimes when I use the volume controls within a webpage, it only increases the volume to the maximum level of what my system volume is set at.  For instance, if my system volume is set to low, then maximizing the webpage volume only will get as high as low volume.  So sometimes, I need to change the volume in both places.  However, if I change the system volume directly, it usually increases/lowers the volume to the desired level.\nThe graphical interface for setting volume has been easy enough to work with that I don't use the terminal commands for sound.

What I need, though, is a way to do this only for a specific application. For example, something like \"Remap Ctrl+S to send Ctrl+D, but only in Chrome\". Is there any way to accomplish this?\n\nA: autokey is like AutoHotkey for Ubuntu.  You can write scripts in python and have them execute  via keyboard shortcut and a windows filter (making it pseudo-application specific).  Your script can control keyboard and mouse events and even move windows around as an added touch.\n\nA: Your idea of using xbindkeys sounds good:\nin your .xbindkeysrc add a new keybinding:\n\"app_specific_keys.sh\"\n   Control+s\n\nThis will execute \"app_specific_keys.sh\" when you press ctrl+s. \nNow you need to define the script. It should get the active window and from that the name of the app which currently has the focus:\nxprop -id `xdotool getactivewindow` |awk '/WM_CLASS/{print $4}'\n\nThis would do the trick: it asks xdotool for the active window, then asks xprop for all properties of the window with the given id, and then reduces the very verbose output to the name of the application (actually its class). If you run this in a gnome-terminal you would get \n\"Gnome-terminal\"\n\nNow you need to define actions for your applications:\nif [ $N = '\"Gnome-terminal\"' ]; then                                                    \n    xdotool key --clearmodifiers ctrl+s                                                          \nelse                                                                            \n    xdotool key --clearmodifiers ctrl+d                                                          \nfi  \n\nSo together, the script \"app_specific_keys.sh\" could look like this:\n#!/bin/bash                                                                     \nW=`xdotool getactivewindow`                                                     \nS1=`xprop -id ${W} |awk '/WM_CLASS/{print $4}'`                                 \nS2='\"Gnome-terminal\"'                                                           \nif [ $S1 = $S2 ]; then                                                          \n   xdotool key --clearmodifiers ctrl+d                                             \nelse                                                                            \n   xdotool key --clearmodifiers ctrl+s                                          \nfi  \n\nThis should work, but as in this question, I have to admit that it does not. Probably because one of Compiz, Unity, Global Menu does not work well with the --clearmodifiers option of xdotool. A workaround would be to add a sleep in front of your script in oder to be able to release the keys yourself:\nIn your .xbindkeysrc change to this keybinding:\n\"sleep 0.5; app_specific_keys.sh\"\n   Control+s\n\nAs a sidenote: this will not work, if you want to change keys for programs which run in a terminal (e.g. vi or emacs in console mode). The returned application class would still be \"Gnome-terminal\".\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: Screen turns off on dual boot of Windows7 and Ubuntu11.10 I'm dual booting Windows 7 and Ubuntu 11.10 using wubi, and when I turn on my computer it takes me to the boot manager screen and I pick Ubuntu.

None of these worked, and I had to reinstall Windows using the Recovery CD I made on the previous installation. \nThanks everyone for your support.\n\nA: Simply try to repair your boot  (grub) with boot-repair CD.  You will find all the explications here. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair \n\nA: There are lots of possibilities that can cause to this kind of problem. It mainly depends on how you installed the operating system (Linux in this case). Did  you install it side-by-side with Windows? OR Did you do some sort of altering the partition table that was there before you install Linux.\nI highly suspect that you have done some sort of altering (i.e. shrinking or/and creating new partition etc.) to the partition table and hence to the partition where Windows was installed. As result of that your NTFS partition (Windows partition) might have corrupted. You can try to repair your NTFS partition but, first try these things.\nAssuming you're using later version of Debian, Ubuntu or their derived distribution and hence you have Grub 2 installed in you system:\nrun in terminal sudo update-grub2 enter your sudo password when prompted. See whether is there any error or abnormal output. (I have a dual boot system with Windows 7. So typical output would be something as shown below)\n\nAssuming things went well, reboot the system and try to load Windows 7. If you get the previous message (the one you have mentioned in the question) then, you have to go the next step, repairing your Windows partition.\nIf you can mount your NTFS partition it is better (and important) to backup any important data in that partition. \nNow install some packages (if they are not already in your system). Type in terminal sudo apt-get install ntfsprogs. Try to repair / resize your NTFS partition. Commands you need to type depends on what you wanna achieve at the end. So, before you do any thing, please go through the man pages of ntfsprogs\nIf nothing work for you then, you need to reinstall Windows and repair Grub boot loader (since Windows boot loader overwrites Grub (MBR)) if you want to login to Linux as well.\nHere are some good links regarding Dual Boot Windows 7 with Ubuntu.

When we submit an application to the Ubuntu Software Center, how long does it take to complete the review stages? Namely,\n\n\n*\n\n*Pending Review\n\n*In Review\n\n\nHow long (average or based on your experience) does it take to complete each of these two stages?\nAnd does the duration of reviewing change by type of application submitted (for Python, Java, etc)? Or is it all the same?\nEDIT\nMore details about my app:\n\n\n*\n\n*Its a commercial app (I put $2.99 as the price when submitting)\n\n*Its a Kakuro game (but the name is \"Sukaro\")\n\n*It is made in Java SE without using any external libraries\n\n*Its not platform-specific (as Java is platform-independent)\n\n*I submitted it without packaging (as I don't know how). I submitted the single .jar file\n\n*I provided all the required information (such as screenshots, etc)\n\n\nA: There are two \"queues\" ARB and \"commercial/paid\". For both the review pending stage takes the longest. This is where the submission is made into a package. If you submitted debian package source (the output of dpkg-buildpackage -S) then this stage will take a very short time. If you didn't follow instructions and submitted a binary deb the process takes MUCH longer as we have to deconstruct and subsequently reconstruct the .deb. If you submit a simple tarball, the packaging process is completely dependent on the complexity of the package.\nThe stages post review pending are quick. Once the app is packaged it goes to QA and once through QA (usually 24/36 hours max) then back to the developer to be listed.\nI hope that helps...\n", "Q: Why isn't my custom launcher appearing in the dash?

Is there a way I can make things just assume that when I run them I am running them as a privileged administrator (AKA root)? I know it could be dangerous and all, but its a risk I'm willing to take in the name of convenience.\n\nA: If you are only interested in specific things running as root, the setuid bit is the appropriate feature.\nBy setting this bit, the program will run with the permissions of it's owner. Therefore you can take a program, change it's owner to root, set it's setuid bit, and that program will then run as root with no special intervention.\nSome programs in Ubuntu are setuid by default - for example, ping\n> ls -l `which ping`\n-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 35712 2011-05-03 11:43 /bin/ping\n\nThis program needs to run as root because only root can open a port below 1024 for listening, which is required to listen for return packets.\nAs noted, allowing programs root permissions by default is dangerous, and is typically reserved for simple, well-audited programs - any program which could be exploited as the result of external input will run the risk of exposing your entire system to compromise, instead of just those areas your user account has access to.\n\nA: Normally I'd include instructions in an answer, but this is such a bad idea I'll point you to a couple places to read up on how to do this. You can take it from there. Note that when you break your system you can post here again for help, but people will laugh and shake their heads and make reference to pebkac errors, etc.\nFirst, the Ubuntu help page on Root/sudo. Note the three large, prominent warnings.\nHere's an Ubuntu Forums user that did something like this and couldn't fix their system.  \nKeep backups of your data if you do it, and consider the wisdom of trading security for convenience. Maybe put on an old Dead Kennedys album while you reinstall...\n\nA: Please don't do that. You're not only hurting yourself, but you're also hurting others.

I have enabled cpu virtualization on my gigabyte ga-ma770t-up3p and have successfully installed ubuntu 11.10 i386 (after amd64 failed to authenticate). I would like to know how I can verify whether or not my cpu virtualization is being used. I see activity on all 4 cores of my phenom II x4 955 black ed.\nI'm running ubuntu virtual machine in windows 7 pro host. \n\nA: In VMware, that stat you're looking for is CPU READY which is defined as:\n\nthe amount of time a VM is READY to RUN but must WAIT for a the right number of cores to become available.\n\nJust because you tell a VM to use N cores doesn't mean it will actually get the opportunity to use them all. If the HV doesn't have CPU time to lend out, all those extra VCPUs stall. You see you can't just have half of the VCPUs actually ready to do work, they ALL must be ready or the entire group stalls. You'll end up with less performance when compared to running a VM with a single CPU.\nAdding VCPUs doesn't always make your VM faster, the additional resource demand can actually crowd it out and result in less overall performance. The right way to do this is to start with 1 VCPU and benchmark your application and increase accordingly. \nThe more VCPUs you allocated, the higher the likely hood that when the HV is busy that you won't receive VCPU time.\nhttp://vmtoday.com/2010/08/high-cpu-ready-poor-performance/\n\nA: What virtualization software are you running?\nFor example Microsofts Virtual PC requires hardware acceleration while VirtualBox don't. Generally, if you in \"Settings > System > Acceleration\" checks [Enable VT-x/AMD-V] and the virtual machine don't crash, it's probably accelerated.\nOn https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=31920 you can see a typical error when trying to run on a unsupported hardware.\nYou can also try to disable hardware acceleration in the bios and see if you notice any difference in load on the host (or in the guest) :-)\n", "Q: Log viewer cant open syslog after messing up groups I was doing some VirtualBox stuff today and I had so add my user to vbox group, well I did it wrong and I removed myself from sudoers.

Previously I was able to see all the log files from \"System Log Viewer\", without having to use sudo or anything, just launching it as my normal user.\nWhat could be happening?\nbtw, I know I can access syslog from any text editor with sudo, but I want to find why I was able to access it from the GUI before without sudo and now I can't. I am using ubuntu 11.10\n\nA: Members of the adm group can read logfiles.

I recently got my first smartphone and its a HTC Wildfire S. In Windows, I installed DoubleTwist to manage and sync my music & video collection.\nBut as my primary OS is Ubuntu (11.04), are there any similar software to manage and sync my media collection to my Android phone?\nAnd if there are any, can it also work with the Market like iTunes does? (I mean, download from the PC and automatically install them to my Android device). Or just media will also be fine.\nSo any recommendations anyone?\n\nA: You can sync your media with apps like Banshee, but your phone must be recognized as a media player. Information about media devices is provided by the media-player-info package. Unfortunately, HTC Wildfire S is not there yet. You can help to integrate it in the next release by following instructions @ freedesktop: http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/media-player-info\nPlease create a bug report as described and post the link here. I will be able to provide a file that you need.\nAs for the Market integration - I don't think there is a software you can use.\n\nA: This is the precise use case of the Ubuntu One Files and Ubuntu One Music apps. The former will let you sync and manage 5GB worth of files remotely (any type) for free.

I tried my suggestion that follows and the result is that it shows the \"message\" icon, but it doesn't have any sub-options when clicked. I don't know if it affects the system though.\n\nWhat I would suggest is to change the group of allowed users for this service. I think you can set who can run the command (indicator-messages-service):\n$ ls -l /usr/lib/indicator-messages/indicator-messages-service\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 65016 2011-09-29 03:02 /usr/lib/indicator-messages/indicator-messages-service\n\nr = read, w = write, x = execute (open folder or run program)\n- rwx r-x r-x = r/w/x for owner (currently root), r/x for group \"root\", r/x for the rest (users not root and not in group root) \n\n\n*\n\n*Create a group:\nsudo addgroup msgok\n\n\n*Add the users for whom you want to allow the message indicator:\nsudo adduser myuser msgok\n\nChange \"myuser\" with your user.\nRepeat for other users.

It would also disable the execution of this service to other users, not root nor in group \"msgok\".\nTo undo the changes:\nsudo chmod 755 /usr/lib/indicator-messages/indicator-messages-service\nsudo chown root:root /usr/lib/indicator-messages/indicator-messages-service\n\n", "Q: Gnome Nautilus - USB automount not working Nautilus does not show my USB devices in its Devices pane.

I have a Radeon HD 4550 which supports up to 512 MB of shared memory.

Is this shared memory feature supported in ubuntu? and if yes how can I use it? I use the latest propriety drivers that amd support page offers online.\n\nA: HyperMemory is primarily a marketing term and the Windows drivers are more marketing friendly.

Make sure you enabled all possible features in the BIOS if possible.\n\nA: Yes it is supported in Ubuntu, we just don't see the gimmicky naming scheme being used.\n", "Q: How do I list all users logged into Gnome 3? I use Gnome 3 and I have 2 desktops on it (2 users).

How can I see which users are logged into Gnome3 in the same time?\n\nA: Try:ck-history --last\nThis will include users who logged in via Gnome / GDM.  I found that commands like 'who', 'w', 'finger', 'last' only display terminal logins.\n\nA: You can try the following command:\nsudo who -u -d\n\nThis should show you all logged in users - even the ones with dead processes.\n\nA: A logged in user will be running a process gnome-session-ctl.  Assuming that keeps running when you switch user, so you can look for that and get its owner:\npgrep gnome-session-c | xargs ps u | awk '/gnome-session-ctl/{print $1}' | grep -v gdm\n\nNote:\n\n*\n\n*Linux stores only 15 chars of the process executable name directly with the process, hence pgrep can only look for gnome-session-c.  Anything longer needs a lookup; ps gives us that lookup - and the user name.\n\n*gnome-session-ctl can appear as an argument to another process, so casually grepping ps for gnome-session-ctl without additional filtering may get false positives.\n\n*Excluding the gdm user is a safety net just in case gdm ever starts a ctl process - you probably don't want to kill gdm!  Maybe overkill but better safe than sorry.\n\n*Note that you could also go after some other gnome process such as gdm-x-session or gdm-session-worker.\n\n", "Q: Enable thumbnail preview when uploading files in Google Chrome/Firefox?

The only interesting thing that you can do is use the F3 to open another side file and F9 to hide/show file tree.\n\nA: I think that's the default behavior in 12.04, but it only applies once you are out of your home directory. (Sorry that that doesn't really help with 11.10.) So, if I start Nautilus in my home directory it shortens the path to be relative to my home directory.

I've also tried the username and password that I had set on install, still no luck.\nWhat is the actual procedure?\n\nA: You should only be using 127.0.0.1 if the frontend and backend are on the same machine. If they are on the same machine, then it should already know where the backend is. If that is failing it means the backend probably isn't running, which is most often caused by not having run mythtv-setup yet. \nIf they are on different machines, then you need to go to the backend and find the username/password combination. This will be located in the /etc/mythtv/mysql.txt file. (username should be mythtv, password will be something that was generated). On the backend, you will also need to run the Mythbuntu Control Centre and activate the mythtv service (allowing remote machines to connect to this backend). Again you will need to run mythtv-setup and go though the steps, make sure you use the actual machine IP though and not the loopback address.\nYou can verify if the backend is running or not with 'sudo service mythtv-backend status'\n", "Q: Why do Thunderbird Lightning notifications come late?

Do you want to add a parameter to the application behind the icon, so each time you run the application by clicking on the icon, the application is run along with the parameter? If that is what you mean, you should do as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal\n\n*Type alacarte, and press Enter.

For instance, here's a picture of my desktop using the theme:\n\n\nYou may notice that, when maximized, the buttons revert back to their old style.

I wonder if I can communicate via IPv6. I know this depends on the ISP. Is there any simple way how to deterimne if my ISP provides IPv6 connection or at least if my router provides this functionality?\nIf there is not such possibility to use \"real\" IPv6, what is the best way to simulate it on Ubuntu?\n\nA: Most routers do not have IPv6 support.  There may be a few coming on the market that do, especially if they are using a xxWRT based O/S.  IPSs are also racing to catch up.  I use OpenWRT on my router to provide IPv6 capabilities including a stateful firewall.  These techniques are equally applicable to Ubuntu on which I run my servers.  I started with a 6to4 tunnel and later upgraded to a 6in4 tunnel using a broker.  \nLinux (Ubuntu) kernels and utilities have long supported IPv6.  For a while this support was problematic, but the problems seem to have been worked out.  IPv6 is very good at self configuration.  However, auto-configured systems may not be easy to reach by name.  This could be considered appropriate for client systems.\nThe number of sites supporting IPv6 is small but growing.  I encourage you to explore IPv6.  Be aware that IPv6 can provide you internal systems with Internet routeable addresses.  Protect and firewall your systems accordingly.\n\nA: If you want to know if the ISP provides IPv6 you probably should just ask them. If their phone support people don't know then they probably don't offer it, or they don't offer it with production quality.\nRouters usually show something about IPv6 in their user interface. If your router doesn't mention IPv6 at all then you can assume it doesn't do IPv6. Too many routers still don't support IPv6. I have had good experience with the Linksys E4200 and the D-Link DIR-657 in case you want to buy a new one.\n\nA: Most ISP don't have IPv6 as of yet. If they do, you probably have to activate it on your router.\nAlternatively, there are many tunneling techniques, which encapsulate your IPv6 in IPv4 traffic to a tunnel broker which releases your traffic to the IPv6 network.\nIf you install such a solution with a tunnel broker you'll have true IPv6 connectivity, which may be a little bit slower because it has to be encapsulated and gets routed via a tunnel broker.\nThere are quite a few other ways to access the IPv6 internet from behind an IPv4 ISP if you like to experience with that.\n", "Q: is there a way to put basic banshee controls in the top bar of unity?

Unity-2D does not use compiz.\nIf you find that it is a compiz issue, then you are most probably affected by this bug-report.\nThis has been resolved and is awaiting testing by a larger group of users.

You must wait until the kernel-ppa team backports it to 10.04. This will be sometime in mid-May.\nYou should remove the kernel from synaptic.\nIf you want to add newer kernel for your lucid setup, try the kernel-ppa. The latest kernel is 3.0.0-15 (the oneiric kernel). It is backported to work on lucid. (The precise kernel will be here also after the release)\n    sudo apt-add-repository ppa:kernel-ppa/ppa\n    sudo apt-get update\n\nAnd open synaptic and you will find the new kernel metapackage. (On my 32bit system: linux-image-generic-lts-backport-oneiric )\nBut if you really need the 3.2 kernel, upgrade your ubuntu to precise. It runs quite good on my test machines.\n", "Q: What is the default Debian/Ubuntu console (TTY) font called? I'm currently running Ubuntu and a few other Linux distributions on my computer and since I use the TTY a lot, a good font is pretty important!\nDoes anyone know the name of the default console/TTY font used in Ubuntu and Debian?\n\nA: *\n\n*Ubuntu Mono from the Ubuntu Font Family (font.ubuntu.com) is the default GUI monospace terminal font on Ubuntu 11.10.\n\n*Terminus Font (terminus-font.sourceforge.net) is the default font on the Linux console (Ctrl+Alt+F1, $ /bin/setfont /usr/share/consolefonts/FOO.psf.gz)\n\n*GNU Unifont (unifoundry.com) is the default font for the CD bootloader menu, Grub bootloader, and alternate (text-based) installer where a software framebuffer is in use. (Unifont is full-coverage fall-back font).\n\n\n\nTechnical details\nThe GUI font is set, for Ubuntu, in the ubuntu-artwork package by a default setting in /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/ubuntu-artwork.gschema.override.  The change was made in Bug #865013 on \n2011-10-04 for Ubuntu 11.10.  It's possible to query the value of this setting (the user may have overridden or changed it) with:\n\n\n*\n\n*$ gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface monospace-font-name'Ubuntu Mono 13'\nThe configuration of the Linux Terminal consoles fonts is slightly more involved; there are a limited number of slots available for characters on the framebuffer, so the best subset is selected at package install time by the code in /var/lib/dpkg/info/console-setup.config with the result stored in /etc/default/console-setup.\nAs @Chen Xiao-Long notes, the console font subsets are built-up from a myriad of bitmap fonts sourced from different places; these are fully documented in /usr/share/doc/console-setup/copyright.fonts.gz.  When the hinting-work in Ubuntu Mono reaches a high-enough level, then hopefully it will be possible to bitmaps exported from Ubuntu Mono instead, see Bug #724022, at least for the areas where we have coverage.\n\nA: That's what I found in another post:\n\"Ubuntu Monospace comes preinstalled with Ubuntu 11.10 and it is the default terminal font.\"\n\nA: Well, I've just figured out the correct answer for Xubuntu 14.04 in TTY (text-only mode, no X), it's this one: /usr/share/consolefonts/Uni2-Fixed16.psf.gz\nI've compared the default console (CTRL-ALT-F1) with modified console (CTRL-ALT-F2), where I walked through:\nfor i in /usr/share/consolefonts/Uni*; do setfont \"$i\"; ls -l /proc/; echo -e \"\\nINFO: currently set font: $i\"; sleep 2; clear; done\n\n(I'd been interested in unicode fonts only)\n\nA: The default terminal font in Ubuntu (19.04, etc...) is named DejaVuSansMono and is found in:\n/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSansMono.ttf\n\n\nA: You can try the True Type (and GNU licensed) version of Fixed Sys.\nIt's not perfectly equal, but it's the most faithful version I've found.

When you boot your computer, hold the Shift key after the bios logo screen. The GRUB menu should display. Press E to edit the kernel command line, use the arrow keys to move to the line that says quiet splash, and add nomodeset there. Then press F10 to boot your system.\nThe boot process should be successful (hopefully). Then you have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make the setting permanent: edit the file /etc/default/grub as root by using the command sudo gedit /etc/default/grub from a terminal, add nomodeset after quiet splash, save the file, and type on the command line sudo update-grub.\n\n*Try the binary driver for your graphics card. An icon offering to install additional drivers should show up in the top panel; simply follow the instructions there.\n\nA: If your computer has ATI graphics, then the problem might be that you don't have the proper fglrx drivers installed.\nTry booting into your installed system with the nomodeset option editing the GRUB entry by pressing \"e\" when selecting Ubuntu 11.10. After \"quiet splash\" and before the next thing to it, enter nomodeset.\nThat will \"boot\" you into ubuntu, but will actually freeze at the splash. Press Ctrl + Alt + F1 to drop into a console.\nLogin with your username and your password, and when you're in, type \"sudo apt-get install fglrx\". These are the proprietary drivers for ATI cards \nEnter your password and install as required.\nReboot and Voilá\n...\nThat worked for me.

I have a collection of films on my computer and every film is stored in its own folder with image of its cover.\nWhat I would like to do is to change icon of each folder to icon of film's cover. Is there any way to do this quicker than right-clicking on each folder and changing icons manually?\n\nA: You can do this from the command line:\ngvfs-set-attribute -t string <directory> metadata::custom-icon file://<icon-location>\n\nreplacing <directory> with the name of the directory you want a custom icon for and <icon-location> with the location of the icon. For example, to change the icon of ~/Documents to a red apple:\ngvfs-set-attribute -t string ~/Documents metadata::custom-icon file:///usr/share/pixmaps/apple-red.png\n\nNow, to automate the process a bit, say that you have a directory ~/Videos/Films inside which you have one directory per film, each of which containing a file called icon.png that contains the desired icon. In that case you can type at the command line:\n{ while read -r d ; do [ -d \"$d\" ] && [ -e \"$d/icon.png\" ] || continue ; gvfs-set-attribute -t string \"$d\" metadata::custom-icon \"file://$d/icon.png\" ; done ; } < <(find ~/Videos/Films -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d)\n\nNotice that an open nautilus window will need to be refreshed in order for any icon changes performed on the command line to take effect.\n", "Q: Asus G73SW's backlit keyboard doesn't work, nor does the FN+F3- & F4 hotkeys Asus G73SW's backlit keyboard doesn't work, nor does the FN + F3 and F4 hotkeys.\nAny solutions for this?\n\nA: Perhaps this would work for your backlit keyboard.

Is there any software in linux for flashing nokia mobile phones ?\n\nA: No, there isn't one available for Linux, you are mostly stuck with Windows.\n\nA: Most of the phones will use a USB connection for flashing.\nIf possible, one of the solutions will be to use Windows inside VirtualBox for that effect.\nYou can configure VirtualBox to pass the USB connection with the phone directly to the virtual machine.\n", "Q: Command line tool to analyze network response etc I want to see the tcp communication when I make a http POST to a url.\nWhat I am looking for is, if they send a redirect during the tcp handshake.\nHow can I test for this?\ne.g. I make a http post to www.example.com/1/2 and then the server responds with a redirect to www10.example.com/1/2\nI have to sent a http post, and the posted value has to be an xml document. (I have a sample xml file on disk that I can send if the utility allows this).\n\nA: Use either tcpdump (a command-line utility) or wireshark (a GUI tool). \nWireshark is somewhat easier to use, it will capture all traffic from your network interface. You'd start a capture with wireshark, then go to your browser and do the transaction you want to do, then back in wireshark you just need to identify an http packet (they're clearly marked as such in the capture), right-click and select \"follow tcp stream\". This will show you the whole conversation including http headers, which should in turn include the redirects.\nTcpdump in essence does the same: it intercepts network traffic and lets you look at it, but since (AFAIK) it has no knowledge of specific protocols, it's up to you to make sense of the captured traffic.\nOne other option is for you to install the Live HTTP headers extension for Firefox. When you enable it, it will capture the request as sent by your browser, any responses sent by the server including redirects. It's potentially easier to use than Wireshark but it's limited to showing you headers from the browser.\n\nA: Tcpdump is well known command line network analyzer, it will dump traffic on a network. However, you need good understanding of TCP/IP protocol to utilize this tool.\nYou can get further details from the link\n\nA: I believe that for something simple like a HTTP redirect you can use wget but for anything more complex than that you'll want to use tcpdump\n", "Q: Genesys Logic, Inc.

They never worked in Linux, Windows or anything with electricity. I am not saying all but from 7 I tested 4 had the same issue. Of those 4 only one slot of SD worked, the rest did not. So maybe the problem might be the device and not Linux. I suggest to test it on Windows and if it is bad, buy a new one and test it on the place you are buying it from.\n\nA: They can work, all that is needed in most modern Ubuntu/debian distros is:\nopen up a terminal and run:\n apt-get install sg3-utils\n\nIf that doesn't get it to work, look at http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~ggbaker/personal/cf-linux\n", "Q: How do I increase the font size in Dash? I am a person with a visual impairment. Pre-Unity versions of Ubuntu allowed you to change all font sizes. Now the Universal Access feature is pretty much useless, as increasing font size to \"Large\" increases everything but the Application list in the Unity Dash, which is fixed at a size I cannot see. Thus, I see only icons and blurry small text, and there's no way to know what apps I have. \nObviously, this is a major usability regression, and I believe something that should have been accounted for in the fundamental design of Unity. If the Dash font is hard-coded and will always be unalterable, I will have to use another DE/UI, like Kubuntu or something. Furthermore, I can't believe this question hasn't been asked before. It's strange to include Universal Access with an OS, but not be serious about its functionality.\nIs there anything I can do to change the font size in Dash? I suppose that will require reorganizing the way the icons are displayed, showing less on each line, etc. I don't know how to do this.\nOr are there any plans to include a working Universal Access system in future versions of Ubuntu? Or should I move on and look for a different distro? Any advice is welcome. Thanks in advance!\n\nThe font size for the general interface (windows, apps, etc.) changes, but not the font size of the overlay UI in Gnome-Shell (App labels under Applications, etc.), nor in Unity, where the Dash UI App list font is fixed at a small size.\n\nA: If you're not comfortable with the command line, the font can be accessed by installing Ubuntu Tweak or GNOME Tweak Tool \nsudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool\n\nand going to the fonts tab (Tweaks > Font for Ubuntu Tweak) and changing the default font size (Ubuntu, 11) by clicking the 11.

In I was able to use xrandr in 10.04 to set my desktop size to twice 1680x1050 (3360x1050) and put my DVI output to the right of the VGA output.  Now the best I can do is mirror 1680x1050, which isn't very helpful.\nI've read somewhere that Intel drivers now don't support resolutions larger than 2048x2048 in either dimension.  Is there any way to get around this and get back to my initial set up?\n\nA: That's actually a limitation of compositing. It affects Unity 3D and (I think) Gnome Shell. However, if you change to a different environment such as Unity 2D or Gnome Classic, that limitation should disappear.\nWhen you log in, you can click the gear icon next to your name and choose Unity 2D.

Ubuntu try to kill my PC or it's should be like this?\n\nA: Many programs are - unfortunately - not multi-processing capable and run in a single thread/on a single processor. Some use threads, which can be executed on another processor core than the \"main\" program.\nIf you have a program that uses a single thread only, it only needs one processor and it does not make sense to move it around the other CPUs, because that takes time.\nHowever, you can be sure that the mapping of processes to cores is fine the way it is. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing)#Linux for some information.\nAnd no, processor cores do not overheat if only one is used over some time.\n\nA: I am experiencing similar odd behaviour with a quad-core processor. I only wanted to reply because I think I can maybe help clarify.\nThe problem is not that certain programs use only 1 core, I would understand that, however it's that certain programs are using all the cores asymmetrically.. So in other words at any given time only 1 of the 4 cores is at 100% while the others drop to 10 - 30. It operates like this for a few seconds and then switches cores.\nI've taken a screen-shot of this behaviour while using DeVeDe 3.21.0 (ffmpeg 0.8.4 is the backend, I think. -version says it was built with gcc 4.6.3) to better illustrate it:\nhttp://i49.tinypic.com/fblqj9.png\nUsing Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS, also here's uname output:\n3.2.0-33-generic-pae #52-Ubuntu SMP i686 athlon i386 GNU/Linux\nHope this helps clarify the problem.\n", "Q: Which release should I use for an ACER Aspire 1640 laptop?

Keep in mind the performance will be slightly lower than once it is actually installed, however. If you decide that Ubuntu's performance is not good enough for you on that machine, you may also want to take a look at Xubuntu and Lubuntu, both of which are officially-recognized derivatives which aim to have better performance on low-end systems.\n\nA: No doubt!

I get errors in .xsession-errors relating to my .bashrc that look like this (abbreviated): \n/home/mrled/.bashrc: 103: [[: not found\n[: 103: Linux: unexpected operator\n[: 274: -P :: unexpected operator\n/home/mrled/.bashrc: 520: complete: not found\n\nAs I said, when I run bash from a virtual console, I don't get these errors. Furthermore, if I remove my .profile, I can log in to X just fine. (I can also log in to a virtual console and use startx to initiate an X session that works, but this is of course not a long term solution.)\nHowever, I discovered that if I run /bin/sh -l, I do get the errors. Here's an example session (note: the bash prompt I have simplified to bash>, and the sh prompt is just $): \nbash> echo $SHELL\n/bin/bash\nbash> echo $BASH_VERSION\n4.2.10(1)-release\nbash> /bin/sh -l\n/home/mrled/.bashrc: 103: [[: not found\n[: 103: Linux: unexpected operator\n[: 274: -P :: unexpected operator\n/home/mrled/.bashrc: 520: complete: not found\n$ echo $SHELL\n/bin/bash\n$ echo $BASH_VERSION\n\n$\n\nQ1: Why is this happening?\nI understand that /bin/sh now points to dash rather than bash, but if that's true, then why is $SHELL still returning /bin/bash? \nQ2: What can I do to work around it?\nIs there a way to work around this? I want to keep my profile loading .bashrc so that I get the same environment on both login and non-login shells, but obviously I only want it to load for bash itself, not /bin/sh masquerading as bash. \nYou may have noticed the difference in the contents of the $BASH_VERSION variables above. I have tried wrapping my .profile in something like this: \nif [ -n $BASH_VERSION ]; then\n    # the rest of my .profile as above\nfi\n\nThe -n test should return true only if the length of the string is non-zero, however, even though in the session above, when I'm running under /bin/sh -l it returns an empty string for $BASH_VERSION, when it's included in my .profile like this, it passes the test! It them proceeds to source my .bashrc and give me the same errors as before. \nNow I'm really confused.\n\nA: You just have to use quotes on the variable BASH_VERSION to use -n\nif [ -n \"$BASH_VERSION\" ];then\n echo \"this is bash\"; \nelse \n echo \"this is dash\";\nfi\n\n\nA: Use /proc/[PID]/cmdline to see what the script is being run with and test for what it contains. The $$ variable will give us the PID of the running shell. Thus we can make a script like this,\n#!/bin/bash\nif grep -q 'bash' /proc/$$/cmdline ;\nthen\n    echo \"This is bash\"\nelse\n    echo \"This is some other shell\"\nfi\n\nHere's a test of the same script:\n$> bash test_script.sh                                                                                                \nThis is bash\n$> dash test_script.sh                                                                                                \nThis is some other shell\n\n\nA: You can make the fact that $BASH_VERSION is blank in dash work for you:\nif [ \"$BASH_VERSION\" = '' ]; then\n    echo \"This is dash.\"\nelse\n    echo \"This is bash.\"\nfi\n\n", "Q: Sound dies on Wine games I've been playing some old classic games (think 1999-2002) on Wine on Ubuntu 11.10 amd64 lately.

Not all applications in use nowadays, are represented by the High Contrast icon theme. I have been updating the High Contrast icon theme a bit, but it is more a personal project.

Now in Lubuntu 11.10 this does not work anymore. I can check the green tick, but this affects nothing, still always one and the same sink is affected.\nDid anybody have this before? Where is this function configured - is there a config file, in which I could change this configuration directly?\n\nA: It sounds like you most likely are experiencing a bug.\nIf you are not experiencing a bug, notice that switching the default output sink with pavucontrol will only affect programs you start -after- the change has been made. It will not affect programs that are already running.\nTo affect programs you already have running, each one will need to be switched individually under the pavucontrol \"Playback\" tab.\nYour pulse-audio configuration files are stored under ~/.pulse/\n\nA: An alternative is to use pacmd list-sinks and pacmd set-default-sink. There's a question related to this\n", "Q: How do I make my terminal display graphical pictures? This is a quick mockup I copy and pasted together. I imagine this being super cool and useful.\nDoes something like this exist already?\n\n\nA: Update 2021-03-02\nViu\nViu is an image viewer that can display images using either the kitty, iterm, or libsixel approach. It also has a fallback mode to display blocky ascii images.\n\nUpdate 2018-12-31\nkitty icat\nThe all around terrific terminal emulator kitty has an icat command to display images (does not work within tmux). Kitty also enables image previews within ranger (a terminal file manager), which is the method I currently use the most often (works within tmux).\n\n1. w3m\nWhile the main purpose of w3m is to provide in-console web browsing, it can also be used to view images in terminal. The relevant packages to install are w3m and w3m-img (on Ubuntu at least). You then need to disable the external image viewer wither by passing -o ext_image_viewer=0 or by going into the options menu ('o') inside w3m and disable external image viewing.\nNow, typing w3m <image_name> will display the image in terminal. w3m will use the entire terminal window, so you cannot see your previous commands until quitting w3m (think less, not cat). Note that if the image is to big to fit the terminal window, it will still be opened externally (in imagemagick for me). Also note that even though I read multiple places that w3m inline images would not work for gnome-terminal, it is working fine for me. It is a little annoying that you have to type q twice to close first the image and then w3m.\n2. Terminology\ntycat is part of terminology and displays images like cat displays text files and like imgcat works for iTerm2 on OS X.\n3. libsixel + mlterm/xterm\nInstall libsixel-bin and any compatible terminal (examples mentioned under 'Requirements' of this readme, for example mlterm or xterm compiled with the right flags and you can view images with the img2sixel command. Both these packages are available in the Ubuntu repos.\n4. FIM\nThen there is FIM which is an improved version of fbi. The homepage states that it can display images not only with the framebuffer, but also with X. However, it won't install for me. Edit I got it running by downloading the 0.5 trunk version, running ./configure --disable-exif and then temporarily removing anaconda (python distribution) from my path since it caused a conflict with libpng before running make and sudo checkinstall (you need to write in a version number manually with checkinstall, but it makes it easier to remove than make install). However, images are still displayed in a separate window, although like with fbi you do not need to be running X which is kind of cool.\n5. jupyter-qtconsole\nYou could also get creative and use the jupyter-qtconsole as your system console, configure it to show plots inline (%matplotlib inline) and then display the image using matplotlib =)\n6. feh\nfeh is using X to display images, but feh -x pops them up in a borderless window that can be quickly closed with q or x. Although images are not displayed in the terminal per say, I thought it was worth mentioning since it is the least intrusive way I have found so far and what I am using until gnome-terminal gets an imgcat/tycat equivalent.\n\nA: Maybe caca is what you want. For images:\nsudo apt-get install caca-utils\ncacaview /PATH/TO/image.jpg\n\nMake sure your terminal window is big enough.\nFor example, here is how this image is displayed in cacaview:\n\nI sometimes used it for fun to watch videos as ASCII in mplayer :) Like this:\nmplayer -vo caca /PATH/TO/video.mpg\n\n\nA: I wrote a tool to do this. I named mine Show Image In Terminal (siit).  It assumes you have a 256 color terminal and UTF8 support, and it's written in Perl.\nI dropped it in my ~/bin.  It assumes you have Image::Magick, Term::Size, Getopt::Long and Time:HiRes, which should all be available in your distro's repositories, or CPAN.\nMy intent was to ssh into my house, and quickly view images without launching a display over X. Script scales to appropriate width/height for the terminal you are in. I used UTF8 characters to effectively double the vertical resolution of your terminal, which really helps clarity. YMMV.\nSample shots here\nSource code here\n\nA: In addition to Joel's answer, Ranger terminal file manager with w3mimgdisplay extension can show images in full color and also supports \"oldschool ASCII art previews\". Here is how you can enable it. This may not be the exact thing you were looking for but a way to preview images in terminal.\n\n\nA: Just to add to the collection (perhaps also for future me), there is also an actively developing/maintained software named chafa that works similar to catimg. Both can show images in addition to GIFs.\nchafa:\n# install chafa\nsudo apt install chafa\n# open a file\nchafa file.gif\n\n\ncatimg:\n# install catimg\nsudo apt install catimg\n# open a file\ncatimg filename.gif\n\n\n\nA: This does not exist; gnome-terminal is only capable of diplaying text, at least as far as I know.\nHowever, you can call an image viewer from the commandline to see your pictures in a particular folder. So, going off of your mockup above showing you listing all .jpg pictures in the current folder, you can use Eye of GNOME (Ubuntu's default image viewer) from the commandline for something similar:\neog *.jpg &\n\nNote that the window which comes up will only show one image at a time, though you can use the provided arrow buttons to cycle between them.\n\nA: I have written a small C++ tool to convert images to ANSI RGB control codes and Unicode block graphics characters for modern terminals supporting these features: https://github.com/stefanhaustein/TerminalImageViewer\nInstallation:\ngit clone https://github.com/stefanhaustein/TerminalImageViewer.git\ncd TerminalImageViewer/src/main/cpp\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nUsage:\ntiv <image(s)>\n\nEdit: Changed links / instructions to the main repository; added usage.\nExamples:\n\n\nA: I made a very quick, simple one line shell function which solves the original question exactly as requested in the mockups. Note the screenshots below are actual images, not mockups.\nfunction lsix() { montage -tile 7x1 -label %f -background black -fill white \"$@\" gif:- | convert - -colors 16 sixel:-; }\n\n\nPrerequisites are minimal: xterm and ImageMagick (apt-get install xterm imagemagick). Your xterm must be in vt340 mode, which you can either set in ~/.Xresources or from the command line (xterm -ti vt340).\nLimitations: Only 16 colors are used over all images shown. That means, an image might look better when viewed on its own. (See below). \n\nUPDATE\nWhile my above answer is still correct, I've created an even better shell script which is able to do an 'ls' of images directly into a terminal. There are all sorts of improvements I added to make the images look better (more colors, proper alpha, JPEG orientation, handling lots of images, compact tile layout,...). It's still a fairly small program, but I figured people might want to customize it, so I've put it up on github: https://github.com/hackerb9/lsix.\n\nA: You can't do so in a terminal window, but you can do so in a Linux console using fbi. You need a framebuffer to allow this to work:\nsudo apt-get install fbi\n\nGo to a Linux console (using Ctrl+Alt+F1) and enter fbi <filename>\nIt should show your image.\n\nA: Here are some solutions in node.js (Installation instructions here).\n\n\n*\n\n*picture-tube\n\n\n*imaging\n\nTo install either, type npm install -g <package_name> where package_name is either of picture-tube or imaging.\n\nA: Another tool is catimg which can be installed using\nsudo apt-get install catimg\n\nIt does not actually view the image but turn it into colored characters.\n\n\nA: Another alternative is terminology:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=ibPziLRGvkg\nYou can install it on Ubuntu by adding the enlightenment-git repository:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:enlightenment-git/ppa\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install terminology\n\nOr in recent Ubuntu releases >= Vivid (15.04) it can be fetched from the official repositories.\nsudo apt-get install terminology\n\nTo view an image, type tycat IMAGENAME, and to view a list of images, type tyls -m.\n\nA: There's actually such a project named TermKit, if you'd like to test it - check out http://blog.easytech.com.ar/2011/05/21/playing-with-termkit-with-chrome/ but it's quite unfinished (since you seem to have a Mac, you should try the Mac-version since it's \"the original\")\nSo yes, it's an idea worth exploring, however - the switch between graphical and text-only mode must be quick since I don't always need the images viewed. Also - it needs to be fully compatible with e.g. Vim..\n\nA: Another option is ueberzug, which you can install using pip. Here I'm using it with fzf-ueberzogen, so to display image previews, you simply run the fzf-ueberzogen.sh command in the current directory as shown below.\n\n", "Q: OpenGL and switchable graphic cards I use a laptop and this laptop has readon AMD Radeon HD 6470M and onboad graphic card.\nWhen I run fglrxinfo, I get this error:\nX Error of failed request:  BadRequest (invalid request code or no such operation)\n  Major opcode of failed request:  136 (GLX)\n  Minor opcode of failed request:  19 (X_GLXQueryServerString)\n  Serial number of failed request:  12\n  Current serial number in output stream:  12\n\nIs it a problem ?

I would like to try archlinux, but I'm afraid it will mess up my grub bootloader, so that I can't get into ubuntu or windows anymore.\nIf I install archlinux on a new partition, and then use the ubuntu-livecd, can I just run update-grub to fix everything? If not, what do I need to do to keep my current setup and add archlinux?\nThanks in advance!\nUpdate\nIt worked out! Just install archlinux on a new partition, if it asks for a bootloader, skip it. Then the grub menu stays the same, so you can log into ubuntu and run update-grub.\n\nA: You should be fine with installing GRUB to the MBR. Once you boot into ArchLinux, you can add entries to chainload the other OSs on your system (i.e., Ubuntu and Windows). Please note that if you do install the Arch GRUB to the MBR, then Arch will become your primary OS, which will in-turn be used to boot other OSs. Also, note that ArchLinux is a DIY-system. So, you will have to manually set-up chainloading using this guide.\nYou can easily change this by booting into Ubuntu (either the Ubuntu on your HDD or the same LiveCD with which you had installed Ubuntu in the first place) and installing the Ubuntu Grub to the MBR. In this second case, Ubuntu will be used to boot the other OSs. This setup (with the Ubuntu GRUB on the MBR) is the one which you already have. As a side note, if you are planning on using the Ubuntu GRUB finally, then, during your original Arch install, you should tell Arch to install its GRUB to the \"/\" or the \"/boot\" partition of Arch instead of the MBR.\nIf you every encounter any problems, the ArchWiki should be the first place to check for solutions to your problems.\nHere are links to your question:\nBeginner's Guide\nGRUB\nWindows and Arch: Dual-boot\n", "Q: Brightness setting is reset to maximum at login My laptop's screen brightness is auto set to maximum at login (= at the login screen already).\nEven after I have adjusted it to lower it is again set to maximum after annother login. Is there a way to save the previous brightness settings in Ubuntu 12.04?\nAdditional Info by gentmatt:\nThis definitely seems to be related to the used graphics.\n\n*\n\n*When using the discrete graphics, the brightness is set to maximum on every boot.\n\n\n*When using the integrated graphics, the brightness setting which Mac OS X has set is used.\nBut Ubuntu does not change that setting. It uses the stored setting by OS X. Therefore, the brightness at login is only changed, when OS X changes the brightness.\n\nA: A possible solution:\nAdd \nxbacklight -set 80\n\nto the file\n.xinitrc\n\nThis will set the backlight to the desired value (80) whenever X is started.\n.xinitrc is the configuration file responsible for the X-Server.\n\nA: Some laptop's have that setting in the bios, like this: \nYou normally press the Del or F2 button during startup to get into the bios, the key is written on the first screen you see when your computer starts.\nBut I'm not sure if you can change these settings from ubuntu.\n", "Q: How to install MATLAB I have Ubuntu 11.10 and try to install MATLAB 2011a.

You'll typically create a profile with a certain name, you can do this in the GUI, but then you can run that profile from the commandline like\nunison -batch name_of_your_profile\n\nThis is useful since you can then make a cronjob out of it. Type crontab -e, then paste in the line\n*/15 * * * *      /usr/bin/unison -batch name_of_your_profile   &> /tmp/unison-cron.log\n\nand exit the editor. Your unison command will now run every 15 minutes, and output any errors to the file /tmp/unison-cron.log.\nActually, it seems like there's even a GUI for cron, Gnome Schedule(friendly intro to it here). Never tried it, but I guess it makes running Unison from cron even more user-friendly …\nSee also the Ubuntu wiki page on Unison.\nUnison is quite powerful, I've used it for a long time to sync stuff between two laptops, a desktop and a remote server … It's quite good at ensuring you get the newest and correct content, and if there's a conflict it's easy to merge. It's not a backup tool, though; if you delete everything on one end, you'll find it deleted on the other end too ;-)\n\nA: Lots of options... Many use rsync, as described here: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/backup\nI like the graphical version Grsync as described here: http://www.linuxloop.com/2009/04/21/how-to-pain-free-backups-with-grsync-and-gnome-schedule/\nMake sure to read the comments regarding scheduling...\n\nA: Have you tried unison and cron together? unison does the two way syncing. cron does the scheduling. These are command line tools, not GUI applications.\n", "Q: \"DEB\" packages recovery The main point is to make \"deb\" packages recovery.

I guess Thunar stores the meta-data in some other way.\nCan anyone tell me how to either set the emblems with a custom command (better solution) or change multiple file properties in Thunar?\n\nA: Thunar saves its metadata in a special file. You can find it at $HOME/.cache/Thunar/metafile.tbd. \nThis is a database and can be accessed using tbdtool (that is part of tdb-tools) \nUse it like this:\ntdbtool $HOME/.cache/Thunar/metafile.tdb\n\nTo show the contents of the database use the dump command.\n\ndump\n            Dump the current database as strings.\n\nIn your question you also wanted to insert emblems.

My host OS is Ubuntu 11.10. Till date I was using NAT configuration for my VirtualBox. Since today I decided to use Host-only networking as I did not want the wiki access to outside world. When I was using the NAT method I could access my wiki with this URL: http://localhost:8080/dokuwiki/doku.php. However after I switched to host-only way I am not able to do it. \nAfter seeing instructions elsewhere I realized that using http://192.168.56.101/dokuwiki/doku.php helps but it did not help me. As instructed here, How can I access Apache (on VirtualBox guest) from host? I tried adding following line to my hosts file\n\n192.168.56.101  userver\n\nwith the idea of using http://userver/dokuwiki/doku.php to access my site. Even http://192.168.56.101/dokuwiki/doku.php did not work. So can anyone help me on how can I go about this? \nAccessing with IP address in the URL would be OK, but I would like to know how I can set custom domain name for use.\nUpdate: As suggested by R.K. I restarted both virtual and physical machines. Then I observed that before connecting to Internet the wiki is accessible with http://192.168.56.101/dokuwiki/doku.php or http://userver/dokuwiki/doku.php. Once I connect to the web using my USB dongle(I use wvdial) the wiki becomes inaccessible.\n\nA: You'd have to set the virtual machine's IP manually or activate VB's dhcp server. From the documentation:\nFor host-only networking, like with internal networking, you may find the DHCP\nserver useful that is built into VirtualBox. This can be enabled to then \nmanage the IP addresses in the host-only network since otherwise you would \nneed to configure all IP addresses statically.\n\n", "Q: Speakers continue to play even after I plug in headphones on a Satellite L640 \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhy are my speakers working but not my headphones? \n\nIm using ubuntu 11.04 and window 7 in toshiba satellite L640.

Could you give me a practical example?\nOr will it just be easier for developers to port their application to our platform? So will I have to wait for them to do the job?\n\nA: This is not exactly accurate. Only Metro apps may be written using HTML5/Javascript/CSS in Windows 8. Microsoft is presenting HTML5/Javascript/CSS as one of at least two supported technologies developers may base their Metro apps on. (another is C#-based apps). In both cases Metro apps will run sandboxed in a special environment and will make use of WinRT which is a proprietary set of APIs and the accompanying platform support framework that will be included with Windows 8.\nYou may always try to run 'classic' Windows applications using Wine, but at least initially, you should not expect any support for running Metro style apps in Ubuntu.

The drive is a 2TB That I have configured to fat32 so that almost everything can read/write to it. I know that from using the search box on this site one fix is \"sudo nautilus.\" I went to my hdd in the file manager, right clicked , properties. under permissions i tell it to allow read/write, but it says it is a read only file system... I know from some googleing that there is a chance in a fix by unmounting the drive, then forcing it to mount. I heard that this causes a loss in data though, and the content on the drive is important (which is why i just don't reformat the drive). If it helps I just reinstalled Ubuntu, so i don't know if my old profile is the \"owner of the drive\" under the permissions tab because i made it the same user name...I know that if i go to a windows computer i can tell it to take ownership, where i can then disable read only. is there no way to do this from Ubuntu?\ngnomes@gnomes:~$ mount\n/dev/sda1 on / type ext4 (rw,errors=remount-ro,commit=0)\nproc on /proc type proc (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev)\nsysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev)\nfusectl on /sys/fs/fuse/connections type fusectl (rw)\nnone on /sys/kernel/debug type debugfs (rw)\nnone on /sys/kernel/security type securityfs (rw)\nudev on /dev type devtmpfs (rw,mode=0755)\ndevpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,noexec,nosuid,gid=5,mode=0620)\ntmpfs on /run type tmpfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,size=10%,mode=0755)\nnone on /run/lock type tmpfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,size=5242880)\nnone on /run/shm type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev)\nbinfmt_misc on /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc type binfmt_misc (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev)\ngvfs-fuse-daemon on /home/gnomes/.gvfs type fuse.gvfs-fuse-daemon (rw,nosuid,nodev,user=gnomes)\n/dev/sdb1 on /media/THIRSTY 2TR_ type vfat (rw,nosuid,nodev,uid=1000,gid=1000,shortname=mixed,dmask=0077,utf8=1,showexec,flush,uhelper=udisks)\n/home/gnomes/.Private on /home/gnomes type ecryptfs (ecryptfs_check_dev_ruid,ecryptfs_cipher=aes,ecryptfs_key_bytes=16,ecryptfs_unlink_sigs,ecryptfs_sig=40584e1d6fa2a33e,ecryptfs_fnek_sig=83ad2a5a52a1069e)\ngnomes@gnomes:~$ \n\nFstab:\n# /etc/fstab: static file system information.\n#\n# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a\n# device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices\n# that works even if disks are added and removed.

I hit ok to delete, now my external is up and running with full read/write capability's!!! \n\nA: I had a similar problem. Today I tried to copy a directory to my external Seagate FreeAgent 1.5TB external drive (FAT32 lba). Everything on it had suddenly become read only. I could not change permissions to the directories even as sudo. Tried everything I could think of even firing up the much hated Windows Vista partition which has destroyed countless years of DATA on another drive.\nI discovered that one tiny sub directory had an error I could not delete it so I rebooted the machine trying backtrack (A Root Only distro) and Xubutu again with no luck. I read about some Windows users having similar issues and fired that up again only to see the dreaded chkdsk screen come up during boot. \nWell this time instead of destroying everything on my drive it found and 'fixed' the bad sub directory. It created the stupid and useless \"FOUND.001\" dir and placed the contents of the bad dir in it, which I promptly deleted using Xubuntu. \nThe drive is now fixed and I hate to admit it but windows chkdsk was what fixed it. \nI DON'T RECOMMEND this as the 1st thing one should use for file system problems because in my experience it has always destroyed perfectly good file systems but in this one instance of 30+ years of IT it actually did some good. Try it as a last resort before reformatting and destroying your data anyways.\n", "Q: How to install KVM in Ubuntu 10.04? I am trying to install Ubuntu 12.04 on a USB flash disk and found this askubuntu question. However I am stuck at the part of the KVM. I am supposed to type this command at the terminal\nsudo kvm /dev/sdb -cdrom ~/.cache/testdrive/iso/ubuntu_natty-desktop-i386.iso\n\nI tried installing kvm using sudo apt-get install kvm\nHowever on running the command to install ubuntu, I get the following message.\n`open /dev/kvm: No such file or directory\nCould not initialize KVM, will disable KVM support\n\nI also get this a QEMU terminal\nStarting SeaBIOS (version 0.5.1)\nBooting from hard disk....\nBoot failed: not a bootable disk\nBoot from floppy ....\nBoot failed: could not read the boot disk\nBooting from CD-Rom....\n23MB medium detected\nBoot failed: Could not read from CDROM (code 000c)\nNo bootable device\n\nOn running the command,\negrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo\n\nI get an output 0. This means that my computer does not support hardware virtualization. \nComputer Specs\nIntel Core 2 Duo 1.83 Ghz, 2 GB Ram, Intel Graphics Card\nPlease help. I'll update the question as I get more info. \n\nA: Does your CPU support KVM ? What is the output of:\negrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo\n\n0 = that your CPU doesn't support hardware virtualization.\n1, or more, your CPU supports hardware virtualization, but you still need to make sure that virtualization is enabled in the BIOS.\nPlease update your question to indicate the output of those commands, what CPU you have, and what manufacturer (so we might be able to help with bios).\nUpdate: Fixed my typo and I see you updated your question as well. The output ( 0 ) indicates you do not have the hardware for KVM (sorry), I would suggest you try Virtualbox.\nIf you run kvm without the hardware capabilities, it will fall back to qemu, which will be slower then Virtualbox.\nThe error message you posted suggests the iso is corrupt, 23 Mb for an iso sounds too small, should be closer to 700 mg, try downloading the  iso again.\n", "Q: Ubuntu One Limit Concurrent Uploads / Downloads I installed Ubuntu One Indicator, and it shows that several files are being uploaded at once. It seems my network is very sensitive to many open connections, and even when limiting the speed, the amount of connections Ubuntu One has made, causes latency spikes.\nI was wondering if there were a way to limit how many files were being uploaded and downloaded at once.\n\nA: The way you limit how many files are transferred (uploaded or downloaded) at once is by setting simult_transfers to something lower than the default of 10 in the __main__ section of the syncdaemon.conf configuration file, and restarting syncdaemon.\nYou can edit the system configuration file, /etc/xdg/ubuntuone/syncdaemon.conf, or the user configuration file ~/.config/ubuntuone/syncdaemon.conf (or create a file there if one doesn't exist). I've found 3 is a good compromise value for when I'm on 3G; YMMV. If you don't have a user syncdaemon.conf and don't want to edit the system one, you'd want to create a file that looked like\n[__main__]\nsimult_transfers = 3\n\nIf the file already exists, you just add the simult_transfers line without the section header.\nOnce that is done, you can restart syncdaemon by entering\nu1sdtool -q; u1sdtool -c\n\nin a terminal.\n", "Q: Can you remove printer/scanner support? My laptop doesn't have a printer or a scanner connected and never will, as it doesn't work with my printer because of wrong cables.\nIs there a possibility to remove the printing/scanning related processes, services and packages to free up some resources or at least disable them from loading on start up?\n\nA: My advice would be to simply disable cups.\nsudo mv /etc/init/cups.conf /etc/cups.conf.disabled\n\nOr you could edit /etc/init/cups.conf and comment out the start line (s).\n#start on (filesystem\n#     and (started dbus or runlevel [2345])\n#     and stopped udevtrigger)\nstop on runlevel [016]\n\nSee http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#disabling-a-job-from-automatically-starting\nAlternately you can remove cups, but probably , at least IMO, more hassle then it is worth.\nCUPS is your printing service. The first command stops the service from running.\nThe link I gave you discusses Upstart. A service is a process that runs in the background, usually waiting for connections. In the case of cups, cups = Common Unix Printing System http://www.cups.org/ and it will share your printer if you configure it to do so.  Upstart is the process which monitors, starts, and stops various services.\nYou could as easily simply remove cups and sane (sane is for scanners), but probably more hassle then it is worth.\nIt is highly unlikely cups or sane is consuming significant resources or in any way slowing down your performance.\nIf, as you gain experience with Ubuntu / Linux, you wish a smaller, lighter system, it is IMO far easier to start with a minimal install and build up then start with a standard desktop install and start removing things.\nIf you are new to Ubuntu and Linux, take care in removing things you do not yet understand.\nSee also:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/LowMemorySystems\n\nA: Regarding the removing part...\nsimple-scan is for scanners. <600kb on disc. system-config-printer-gnome is for configuring printers. 1.6Mb on disc. It is part of the gnome desktop though so might not be that easy to get rid of. cups 1.5.0-8ubuntu6 is 8Mb. It might also be a hassle to remove since it is sort of a system wide system all programs that have a print funtion depend on.\nAll in all you might save 10Mb. I did not try removing them so if you do this be careful for any notice telling you about removing other packages. You would not be the 1st to remove gnome completely.\nFollow bodhi.zazen's post for just turning it off. I would advice doing that. If you need more space it is far easier to use an USB stick or external disc: lots of space at low cost.\n", "Q: I cant get samba to set proper permissions on created directories I have a ubuntu server sharing some folders using samba. When a client creates a new folder or file, the permissions aren't set according to the settings in smb.conf. \nMy current settings for a specific share:\n[share]\n    path = /mnt/share\n    browsable = yes\n    guest ok = no\n    writable = yes\n    read only = no\n    create mask = 0774\n    directory mask = 0774\n    write list = netuser\n\nWhen a samba client (a windows 7 box) uses the 'netuser' account to create a file or directory, the permissions become\ndrwxr-sr-- 2 netuser sambashare      4096 2012-01-22 21:14 New folder\n-rwxrw-r-- 1 netuser sambashare         0 2012-01-22 21:07 New Text Document.txt\n\nThe parent directory has the set group id flag, thus the sambashare group owner. The idea is that both samba users and server users belong to the sambashare group, and thus are to be able to edit, delete, and create files and directories. However, since created folders doesn't have the write flag for group set, server users cant create new files or folders in those folders without sudo.\ni have tested adding and removing the directory mask, force directory mode, directory security mode, and the force directory security mode, but the behaviors still remains. Newly created files and folders doesn't get intended 774 permission, but rather 764 and 754 respectively. \nWhat am I missing? Why doesn't samba set the correct permissions?\n\nA: After a lot of trial and error, this is the correct code to share samba dir using SGID and unix groups. If user connects anonymously he gets r/o, if he logs in and is a member of assigned group he gets r/w.\nI have group named 'admin' set as primary group to users with write privileges, everyone else gets read only rights.\nI force user to nobody, so different people working on same files don't interfere with each other.\nI set chmod 2755 on shared directory, so it inherits created directories with the same group 'admin'\n$ chmod -R 2755 /home/shares/test\n\nChecking if all is good:\n$ stat /home/shares/test\nAccess: (2755/drwxr-sr-x)  Uid: (65534/  nobody)   Gid: ( 1001/   admin)\n\nRelevant part of /etc/samba/smb.conf:\n[test]\n        comment = test\n        path = /home/shares/test\n        force user = nobody\n        read only = No\n        create mask = 0664\n        force create mode = 0664\n        directory mask = 02775\n        force directory mode = 02775\n\nThis post put me on right track, but testparm revealed 4 incorrect directives, so I'm sharing fixed config here.

I am using Ubuntu 11.10 and Apache2.\nDefault folder for webserver is /var/www \n\nA: The location of the shellscript is important, and the path you're using are important. Even if alert.sh is located at /var/www, the current working directory can be different. Use echo getcwd(); to get the current working directory. With an absolute path, you would use:\nshell_exec('/var/www/alert.sh');\n\nThe second possibility (most likely) is that the file mode (file permissions) is insufficient. The Apache webserver runs as user www-data. If the alert.sh is owned by you, has your group and has execute permissions for the owner only, the apache server cannot execute it. Possible permissions (practicing the least privilege rule) are:\n\n\n*\n\n*755 - owner: you - group: you\n\n*750 - owner: you - group: www-data\n\n*644 or 640 - owner: you - group: you or www-data\n\n\nThe last option works only if you execute the script like shell_exec('/bin/sh alert.sh').

I started playing with Conky a few days ago and managed to achieve this:\n\n(Note: although I've written it from scratch, I got inspired by this photo, credits to the author for their creativity)\nAs you can see, I have some free space between the digital clock (\"21:20\") and the connection statistics.\nNow I'd love to have what I called \"music bars\" in that space. That is, animated bars that move following the sound currently played by my music player (which is Clementine at the moment).\nI've already managed to display the current track, artist, year, etc. thanks to some scripts and the qbus command.\nHowever, I have to main questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How would I get the actual music data (I think it's called amplitudes)?\n\n*How would I animate that in a fairly smooth way?\n\n\nI'm using conky and lua with cairographics, but animation really seems to be something complicated, as I haven't found a way to make lua/cairographics \"repaint\".\nThis forces me to reduce the update_interval in .conkyrc to achieve something \"close\" to an animation.\nUnfortunately, setting a very small value to update_interval makes conky consume a lot of CPU resources, because it doesn't only redraw every (for example) 50 milliseconds, but it also recalculates variables and re-executes scripts if necessary.\nTherefore, for the animation, I'm looking for a way have a smooth animation (10 fps would be enough) without making conky eat up the CPU resources.\nIt would be awesome if anybody could give me some ideas. It does not necessarily have to be in LUA, and if there's a good alternative to conky (should be something lightweight), feel free to let me know!\n--\nThanks a lot for the ideas and suggestions!\n\nA: I think it is possible, using PulseAudio. I don't know how to go about it fully, but here is a utility I found that'll help you get the amplitudes - I suppose you could then find something to convert that into conky charts.\n\nA: I know it has been quite a while since you posted this, however I found a great CLI visualizer the other day:  https://github.com/dpayne/cli-visualizer\nNow, this does not solve your update interval issue of course, but you still might find it as interesting as I do. \n", "Q: No Sound on my Toshiba Satellite L455D-S5976 No Sound on my Toshiba Satellite L455D-S5976,  Running Ubuntu 11.10  32Bit,  ATI,  IXP AC97, Realtek ALC250 rev.2\nTurned the volume up on all volume settings.

How can I change the default text editor from gedit to vim? When I click on a text file, I want it to open in vim under the terminal instead of gedit.\n\nA: You don't say how you are clicking on this file, so I will explain a way to do it in Gnome from Nautilus.  It should work in other cases, I believe.\nFirst, to get Vim (or any app) into the \"open with other application\" list, you need to create a .desktop file in ~/.local/share/applications with a line in it like this:   Exec=<command> %f.  I just made one called vim.desktop with these lines:\n[Desktop Entry]\nCategories=;\nComment=Edit file in Vim\nExec=vim %f\nGenericName=Text Editor\nHidden=false\nIcon=vim\nName=Vim\nTerminal=true\nType=Application\nVersion=1.0\n\nThis made \"Vim\" appear in the list of possible apps when I right-clicked in Nautilus, and opened the file as expected.\nLet me know if there are any problems.  \n\nA: The problem with the vim.desktop approach is that each time it will open a new terminal window, instead of using an existing vim instance. This is probably not what you want, but I don't think there's any way around it.\nThe next best thing is using gvim, which is a GUI app, instead of a terminal app.\n\nA: Open defaults.list \nsudo -H gedit /etc/gnome/defaults.list`\n\nReplace \ntext/plain=gedit.desktop\n\nwith \ntext/plain=gvim.desktop\n\nSave and close.\nFor more details and screenshot check this answer: How do I stop gedit from opening anything?\n\nA: Pure command line based method:\necho \"[Desktop Entry]\nName=Vim Text Editor\nComment=Edit text files\nExec=vim %F\nTerminal=true\nType=Application\nIcon=vim\nCategories=Utility;TextEditor;\nStartupNotify=true\nMimeType=text/plain;\" > ~/.local/share/applications/vim.desktop\ncp /etc/gnome/defaults.list ~/defaults.list.bak # backup\nsudo sed -i \"s/=gedit\\.desktop/=vim\\.desktop/\" /etc/gnome/defaults.list\nmkdir ~/.icons\nwget -O ~/.icons/vim.png http://en.xn--icne-wqa.com/images/icones/1/4/vim.png # if you want an icon\n\n\nA: Save this as ~/.local/share/applications/vim.desktop:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Vim Text Editor\nComment=Edit text files\nExec=vim %F\nTerminal=true\nType=Application\nIcon=vim\nCategories=Utility;TextEditor;\nStartupNotify=true\nMimeType=text/plain;\n\nThen in Nautilus right-click on a text file, choose \"Properties\" and go to \"Open with\".

I have a USB headset with microphone (Logitech, model number appears to be A-00009) that I can't seem to get Ubuntu (Natty, 32-bit) to recognize. The hardware is an Asus K52F laptop. Following is the output from dmesg when I plug the headset in:\n[  528.093828] usb 2-1.2: new full speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 3\n[  528.165794] usb 2-1.2: device descriptor read/64, error -32\n[  528.341688] usb 2-1.2: device descriptor read/64, error -32\n[  528.517601] usb 2-1.2: new full speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 4\n[  528.589556] usb 2-1.2: device descriptor read/64, error -32\n[  528.765457] usb 2-1.2: device descriptor read/64, error -32\n[  528.941319] usb 2-1.2: new full speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 5\n[  529.348970] usb 2-1.2: device not accepting address 5, error -32\n[  529.421096] usb 2-1.2: new full speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 6\n[  529.828719] usb 2-1.2: device not accepting address 6, error -32\n[  529.828884] hub 2-1:1.0: unable to enumerate USB device on port 2\n\nI've tried this also on 2 other Linux machines: a desktop running Debian Squeeze and a netbook running Oneiric. Same result. I've done a lot of Googling, but most people having issues with USB sound devices appear to have gotten farther than this. Where should I look next?\n\nA: Its uncommon that a USB device announces itself and then refuses to communicate, I would say your headset is defect, its an hardware issue.\nPlease try to use it on the LiveCD to see if you have any further information or ask a friend (or if available) to try on a computer with a different OS. If it fails then there it will be for sure a hardware defect.\n", "Q: Is there a lightweight tool to crop images quickly? I need to crop images often - photos, printscreens, etc., and loading gimp for such a simple task takes way too long. Can you recommend a faster alternative?\n\nA: As people suggested on the Internet, try CropGUI: http://emergent.unpythonic.net/01248401946\nIt does just lossless JPEG cropping.\n\nA: How about Gwenview, which is a highly customizable and easy to use image viewer/image managing application. \n\n\n*\n\n*Crop function under \"Menubar -> Edit -> Crop\" or crtl + k   \n\n*Also supports simple image manipulations: rotate, mirror, flip, and resize, basic file management actions such as copy, move, delete and others.\n\n*It is a Lightwave Application (with MB) and can be extended using KIPI plugins.\n\n\n\n\nA: As a complement to the the main answers (gthumb, gwenview etc):\n\n\n*\n\n*An image can also be opened with a viewer but then cropped with a screenshot tool. There are many such tools depending on the desktop. As now there is an  Ubuntu Budgie I'll take that example: Budgie has a panel applet to easily capture and save images; it may need to be added to the panel from the budgie settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Opera browser has a crop and even editing tool. Opening the image in Opera (yes, you can), you can then crop and even add arrows and draw on it before saving.\n\n\n\n\n\nA: On the command line, the tool to manipulate bitmap images is imagemagick  or graphicsmagick  (GM is a split of the IM project, and more actively developed). This is a good option if you often use the same parameters.\nconvert raw.jpg -crop 800x460+100+20 cropped.jpg     # ImageMagick\ngm convert raw.jgp -crop 800x460+100+20 cropped.jpg  # GraphicsMagick\n\nFor ad hoc use where you need to see each image, you can use display (also from the ImageMagick suite) or gm display (GraphicsMagick) or Shotwell or Pinta or many other image viewers with light editing capabilities.\n\nA: I use mogrify on the command line.\nGo to the folder you want to modify and run:\n$ mogrify -trim *.jpg\n\nDone. It runs very fast. I just did several thousand images in 1 second.\nResizing is quite a bit slower.\nI followed up the previous command with this:\n$ mogrify -geometry 280x280\\> *.jpg\n\n(\\> indicates to resize to maximum dimensions specified, so all images will fit within)\nThat took 8 minutes.\n\nA: I had the same problem and created a tool exactly for that:\nhttps://github.com/weclaw1/inbac\nJust select the part of image you want to crop and press:\n\n*\n\n*X to crop, or\n\n*Z to crop and go to the next image.\n\nYou can install it using pip by typing:\npip install --user inbac\n\nor clone the repository and run it with poetry.\n\nA: You can crop and export pretty quickly with Shotwell, it's pre-installed. Failing that try Pinta, it's in the Software Center.\n\nA: Can try Nomacs also, cropping and resizing is easily working there!\n\nA: Gthumb is a nice image viewing/editing tool with simple editing tools like cropping. You can install Gthumb by running this on the command-line:\nsudo apt install gthumb\n\nInstructions for cropping in gThumb 3.2.8\n\n*\n\n*Open your image in gThumb\n\n\n\n\n*Open the Edit sidebar by pressing e or clicking on the easel in the top-right corner of the window\n\n\n\n\n*In the sidebar click on Crop and then crop the image as you desire\n\n\n\n\n*Once finished press Enter or Crop. Then, in the Edit sidebar press Save to overwrite the original file or Save As to save to a new image file.\n\n\nA: Batch jobs and command line programs don't work too well for cropping if you have lots of different things you want to crop (i.e. the subject is in different areas in each image). Image editors like gimp and even some lightweight viewers still annoyingly have crop hidden under a bunch of menus and then to throw load/save on top of that means most of your time is spent on navigation.\nI threw together a small python script to automate a lot of this process but still let the human choose where to crop for each image:\nhttps://github.com/pknowles/cropall\n\nUses imagemagick to do the crop, python/tkinter for the preview.\nIt automatically runs through all images in a directory, click the area to crop, scroll to adjust size, then space to save (in a subdirectory) and load the next image.\n\nA: ImageMagick. Launchable from CLI with $ display <img>. Has visual cropping. Very lightweight (about 10Mb aside from dependencies), requires little more than libx11 and GNOME's libxml2.\n\nImageMagick is a software suite to create, edit, and compose bitmap images. It can read, convert and write images in a variety of formats (over 100) including DPX, EXR, GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, PDF, PhotoCD, PNG, Postscript, SVG, and TIFF. Use ImageMagick to translate, flip, mirror, rotate, scale, shear and transform images, adjust image colors, apply various special effects, or draw text, lines, polygons, ellipses and Bézier curves. All manipulations can be achieved through shell commands as well as through an X11 graphical interface (display).\n\n\n\nA: XnViewMP or IrfanView (under Wine). They worked for me ever since the Bronze (Windows) Age.\n\nA: just installed KolourPaint (part of the K desktop environment which appears to include GwenView), and that did it for me. seems stable under RHEL6.5, and i'll try it with Trusty tonight. i have very simple goals with this: support ctrl-V for paste directly after the app is started (something the otherwise great GwenView doesn't support), and simple cropping (in this case, ctrl-T) and copying back to the clipboard for reuse in an office or instant messaging app. it also supports several paint features. still not a full replacement for irfanview (if there even is one...beginning to conclude there really isn't), but i'll live.\n\nA: The following is more of a hack.\nYou can use the mpv media player with the following crop script.\nJust bind a script-binding to toggle-crop in your input.conf, open your file in mpv, hit the binding and then use the keyboard arrow keys to move to the first corner, hit enter, and then do the same for the other corner and hit enter. mpv is pretty lightweight and this script shows a nice selection rectangle all the way. You can then hit s to save a screenshot of the result.\n", "Q: Cannot connect to wireless network with a Broadcom BCM4311 802.11b/g WLAN card I installed ubuntu on my old HP. it is the 11.10 version. I cannot find out how to connect it to my wireless network.

Is there any way that I can run this program on my Linux system without possibly getting a virus?\n\nA: Be aware please that even tough this will work probably fine, running a virus inside any live system is never a good idea, even if you are sure that you can revert / eliminate the effects of the virus. For a safer approach the answer from bodhi.zazen is recommended. This is the safest steps to run something that is not really safe.\n\nAny program running inside a wine prefix has only access to the virtual bottle in that .wine prefix folder in your home and nothing else. They are closed inside that bottle.\nThat said it is also true that a default created bottle also creates standard links in to your home folder and root file system, you need to make sure that those are deleted before running the executable. Some pesky trojans will scan drivers for executable or other specific file type and try to infect those.\nA better option is to create a new bottle and thus isolating it from your normal bottle, for that you need to run the .exe file on a separate prefix, do that by following this example:\nexport WINEPREFIX=~/wine_possible_trojan\nwine winecfg\n\nAt this point look for the mounted points created for the bottle, they should be on the drives tab, remove any letters that are not c:\\, that will prevent the trojan of fiddling with any files inside your home or the root file system:\n\nAfter removing the drivers from the bottle you can run the executable using the bottle you just created with using something like\nWINEPREFIX=~/wine_possible_trojan wine path_to_exefile.exe\n\nAfter that deleting ~/wine_possible_trojan will delete the bottle from your system eliminating the modifications done by the trojan inside that bottle.\nIf you are unsure you can also install a virus scanner in your Linux system and run that after )and maybe before to see if it picks anything up) deleting the .wine prefix. Have a look at this post for options available:\n\n*\n\n*Available anti-virus for Ubuntu 11.10\n\nThe other option would be, as bodhi.zazen said, to install VirtualBox from the Ubuntu Software Center, install Ubuntu or Windows (if available) in to a new virtual system in VirtualBox and run the .exe inside that virtual system.\nFor more information about VirtualBox please visit the Wikipedia page, the official VirtualBox page and have a look at How to install VirtualBox in AskUbuntu.com.\n\nI can see from the AV scan report you added to the comments that only 1 engine picked it up out of all of those on the list, I would say false positive.\n\nA: You would need to run it in an isolated test system, such as a VM and investigate what it does.\nWhat exactly is it ?\nIt is hard to believe you \"need\" to run an infected .exe.\nIt is possible you have a false positive as well (depending on how you detected the virus and what, if any, investigation you have done).\n", "Q: How do I bind right click to a keyboard shortcut? My friend has a Dell Netbook with a twitchy touchpad and doesn't really right click reliably (the pointer moves as you right click).\nHe would like to be able to do something like use a modifier key and normal left click and have that register as a right click in the UI. Unfortunately this netbook does not have the typical right menu shortcut key on the keyboard.\nHe is pretty sure this is not possible in standard GNOME, but how about Unity? Is this possible?\n\nA: Install xdotool and xbindkeys:\nsudo apt-get install xdotool xbindkeys\n\nCreate a binding in $HOME/.xbindkeysrc for e.g. Alt+:\n\"xdotool click --clearmodifiers 3\"\n  alt + b:1\n\nAnd then start xbindkeys (typically, this would go into your xinit file so that it is started everytime you log in.) \nNow the problem here is that although it should work with the --clearmodifiers option, something (Unity? Compiz? The global menu?) is preventing the alt key from getting released. An ugly workaround (until someone gives you a better answer) would be to add a sleep 1 and release the alt key yourself:\n\"sleep 1; xdotool click --clearmodifiers 3\"\n   alt + b:1\n\nSo: if you press Alt and click the left mousebutton, then release Alt within 1 second, you will get a right mouseclick (although with 1 second waiting time).\n\nA: You could also go to settings -> accessibility -> simulated second click.\nThis allows you, by holding the left click for long enough, to provoke the right click.\nI was looking for a faster approach than this answer, however it is still at least a 1 second wait, even on the shortest interval setting.\n", "Q: automatically run ls after changing path using autocd So everytime I change the directory I would like the new path to automatically get listed with ls.There are solutions if the path gets changed using cd but I never found a solution that would work when the path gets changed using the autocd option.\nWould be quite convenient, has anyone achieved that before?\n\nA: You can achieve this by changing the variable PROMPT_COMMAND, which is executed before PS1, e.g.:\nPROMPT_COMMAND='ls'\n\nThis will list each time you get a new prompt.  Of course you only want to execute ls if the directory has changed:\nPROMPT_COMMAND='[[ $my_currdir != $PWD ]] && ls; my_currdir=$PWD'\n\nThis checks if the new directory isn't the same as the last one set, and then executes ls, after which your current directory is stored in my_currdir\nI found an even better line here, where they use bash as a file manager:\nPROMPT_COMMAND='[[ ${__new_wd:=$PWD} != $PWD ]] && list; __new_wd=$PWD'\n\nsince it is possible that __new_wd is unset, you can assign a default value which will be used in that case (see bash man pages, search for :=)\n", "Q: why is chrome resolving domain names differently than ping which is resolving differently than ssh? When I go to me.com in chrome it tells me that domain can't be found.  When I go to me.com with ssh, it connects to that server.  When I try to ping me.com it pings localhost.  I want me.com to resolve to localhost in all 3 situations.  How can I accomplish this?  \nHere are my relevant files:\n/etc/hosts\n127.0.0.1       localhost.localdomain   localhost me.com\n::1     laptop  localhost6.localdomain6 localhost6\n127.0.1.1       laptop\n\n/etc/resolv.conf:\n# Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)\n#     DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN\nnameserver 127.0.0.1\nnameserver 127.0.0.1\n\n/etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head\n# Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)\n#     DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN\nnameserver 127.0.0.1\n\n\nA: Unless you're actually running a DNS server such as BIND or dnsmasq on the localhost, you don't want your nameserver stanzas to point to the localhost. If you are running a DNS server or caching service, you'll need to refer to its documentation for details on how to configure it so me.com resolves to the localhost. Once the DNS service is configured, you can test resolution of specific domain names with nslookup.\nChrome may be automatically appending 'www' to the front of your URL, you can make sure this is behavior is disabled by specifying the protocol portion of the URL explicitly, like so: \"http://me.com\"\nWe'd need to see your /etc/nsswitch.conf file to help with the ssh connection. ssh -v may also produce some useful output.\nFinally, if you want to connect to the localhost, it may be much less of a headache to simply specify 'localhost' as your hostname, instead of 'me.com' :)\n\nA: Try to clear your DNS cache and then remove all history in Chrome (should be somewhere easy-accessible under settings, this is good to do since I'm not entirely sure if Chrome is DNS-caching)\nSee http://www.ubuntugeek.com/howto-clearflush-dns-cache-in-ubuntu.html for clearing cache (I'm not entirely sure that is needed or is possible, but try it ;D)\nAlso try to dig me.com since that could give some helpful information.\nYou could also try by starting up Firefox and see if me.com goes to localhost.\nAlso - I don't think you have to (or should, unless you've got a DNS-server set up to replicate other DNS-servers) point your nameservers to 127.0.0.1 since /etc/hosts has higher priority than that of the nameservers per default (see the hosts-line in /etc/nsswitch.conf for your settings)\n\nA: To address the original question.\nFirst, why do you get three different results from Chrome, ssh and ping?\nIt looks to me as if these three programs use different resolver logic, perhaps using different libraries or different flanking code. It is known that ping uses the glibc resolver which obeys /etc/nsswitch.conf and /etc/resolv.conf. Hence ping first tries /etc/hosts and then DNS. So ping me.com pings 127.0.0.1. Perhaps Chrome skips /etc/hosts and can't find www.me.com in DNS. As for ssh, what host does it end up connecting to?\n\nA: You know if in your network has some proxy server? If has maybe is a restriction in this server. If you has control OK, but if other SysAdmin manage, you need talk with him.\n\nA: I am using resolvconf on Ubuntu 20.04 and for additional DNS servers added via resolvconf -a ..., I needed to edit the file /etc/nsswitch.conf so that in the line starting with hosts:, the word dns stands before [NOTFOUND=return]. So for me, it needed to be the following for Chrome and other browsers to recognize my additional DNS servers correctly:\nhosts: files dns mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] myhostname\n\n", "Q: Release input automatically in vmware Player grabs the input when clicked inside, then the mouse pointer is locked within the Player window and I have to press ctrl+alt for the Player to release input.  \nPreviously it all worked automagically, a few days ago, and I haven't changed the host (11.10) or guest (win XP) OSs or anything drastic like that.

This was the first time I used Ubuntu and was really happy with it. The boot and shutdown time was very nice and much shorter than on Windows Vista. I was pretty satisfied with the general performance of Ubuntu back then. As the versions passed, I noticed, that with every new release the performance is getting worse. I believe one reason could be Unity, since it is still under development. I'm also not really happy with this new UI direction everyone (Win8, Unity, Gnome 3) is heading now. These big buttons and text fields as my screen would be a touchscreen. I would prefer the old (but fast) GNOME 2.x. However this is a complete other topic. I read somewhere that the slow boot and shutdown could be about the network manager.\nThe second thing is the graphic performance. Unity and the general desktop environment is pretty slow, not that it's unusable, but when I press or click somewhere I notice a little delay. Games, compared to Windows 7, Minecraft runs much smoother than on Ubuntu. And a few other games too.\nI would like to know if there are any tweaks or something that I can improve the boot and shutdown time, graphics performance, etc.\nEdit:\nBootchart (large image)\nMy system:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dell XPS M1530\n\n*Ubuntu 11.10 32Bit\n\n*Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU T9300 @ 2.50GHz\n\n*GeForce 8600M GT\n\n*4GB RAM\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Did you install additional drivers for your graphics card? Try to install one using jocky-gtk. \n\n*Install preload which loads recently loaded(but not running now) programs data in the background so your system can load that program faster when you want to start it again. \n\n*Go to ccsm > Unity plugin>experimental . Change dash bar to static or no blur. Which reduces the delay of unity dash.\n\n*Must use swap, at least 1GB. If you did not keep a partition for swap then don't worry, you can create swap file without delete or create a new partition. Check here  Just copy paste the commands in terminal.\n\n*Remove unnecessary programs from you startup list. \nsudo sed --in-place 's/NoDisplay=true/NoDisplay=false/g' /etc/xdg/autostart/*.desktop \nRun the command first which will display all of your applications in \"start up application\"\n\n*Install laptop-mode-tools which will increase your laptop's battery life.\n\n*Add the line in /etc/sysctl.conf\nsudo gedit /etc/sysctl.conf \nvm.swappiness=10  [add the line at the end of the file]\nThis means your system will keep the cache in ram instead of swap as much as possible and your system's performance will increase.\n\nA: Have you done a clean install since 9.04, or have you just done upgrades each time?  It's possible that you have old/unneeded packages installed that are still running or causing slowdowns.  If you are able to, make backups of all of your data, wipe your drive, and do a fresh install of 12.04.  That may solve some of your problems.\nAs far as minecraft in particular, replace the jar files in 'natives' with the versions from lwjgl2.8.4, and run the game using the java-7-openjdk package.

Is this a bug or the normal behavior? In Gnome 2 this worked well even the screen is off.\nAny idea?\n\nA: you can type shutdown --help in a terminal to see various options\n\nshutdown --help\nUsage: shutdown [OPTION]...

Other valid\n  formats are +m, where m is the number of minutes to wait until\n  shutting down and hh:mm which specifies the time on the 24hr clock.\nLogged in users are warned by a message sent to their terminal, you\n  may include an optional MESSAGE included with this.  Messages can be\n  sent without actually bringing the system down by using the -k option.\nIf TIME is given, the command will remain in the foreground until the\n  shutdown occurs.  It can be cancelled by Control-C, or by another user\n  using the -c option.\nThe system is brought down into maintenance (single-user) mode by\n  default, you can change this with either the -r or -h option which\n  specify a reboot or system halt respectively.  The -h option can be\n  further modified with -H or -P to specify whether to halt the system,\n  or to power it off afterwards.  The default is left up to the shutdown\n  scripts.\n\nto make run you will need sudo shutdown now for instance will shut the computer down right away.\nhope this helps.\n\nA: Well, I'm pretty sure that this is a gnome bug with gnome-session-quit.\nWhile they solve it I've created a script to do this:\nyad --text-info --title LFTP --text='<b>El sistema procederá a apagarse en unos segundos...</b>' --image=/home/simon/.local/share/icons/lftp.png --image-on-top --timeout=10 --timeout-indicator=bottom --on-top --center --button=gtk-cancel:0 --window-icon=/home/simon/.local/share/icons/lftp.png || sudo shutdown -h now\n\nI use yad (a fork of Zenity) to show the alert.\n", "Q: How do I get Evolution Mail's RSS to work?

I could use the $GTK2_RC_FILES environment variable to define the colours profile only for one program, rather than overall.\nSecond, the text colours (highlight, titles, links, ...) are defined in NoteTag.cs file in the Tomboy sources (InitCommonTags() method). It's not possible to run the rebuilt Tomboy.exe file directly, though: you need to proceed to a \"sudo make install\" (in /usr/local) first to have all the libraries and resources moved to their expected location.\ne.g. use foreground-yellow instead of background-yellow on highlight \ntag = new NoteTag (\"highlight\");\n// tag.Background = \"yellow\"; // commented out\ntag.PaletteForeground = ContrastPaletteColor.Yellow; // <- inserted\ntag.CanUndo = true;\ntag.CanGrow = true;\ntag.CanSpellCheck = true;\nAdd (tag);\n\nHave fun.\n", "Q: How can I get my third screen (laptop + two monitors) running on w/ nvidia drivers?

For some reason, the switch didn't work, so I tried to revert back to the beta release once again. No luck either.\nThe funny thing is both Firefox and Chrome report that the flash player is installed.\nGoogle Chrome Plugin Tab\n\nFlash - Version: 11.2 r202\nShockwave Flash 11.2 r202\nName:

There were so many discussions about an Ubuntu with RR. They were so many pros and contras. At the end ubuntu wont be changed, the 6 month cycle system wont be changed. Thats fine! \nBut because there are so many people who would like to use an ubuntu with RR Im asking myself why isnt there an Ubuntu Derivate with RR. I couldnt found one, there are a loooot of Ubuntu Derivates but no RR. Is it just impossible? I mean Ubuntu = 6 months cycle, so the derivate have to be a 6 month cycle too? Is there no other option? Or are there already some smart guys trying to solve this problem? Thank you!\n\nA: Ubuntu has Rolling Rhino\nIf you want to read a blog about it, I'll refer you to\nhttps://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2020/06/ubuntu-rolling-release-rhino-tool\n\nUbuntu desktop lead Martin Wimpress has created a tool called Rolling Rhino. Its aim: convert an Ubuntu daily build image into a “rolling release” distro by opting into and tracking the devel series of changes/packages.   (Joey Sneddon)\n\nor from the source directly\nhttps://github.com/wimpysworld/rolling-rhino\n\nConvert Ubuntu into a \"rolling release\" that tracks the devel series; for the toughest of Ubuntu users.\n\nCreated by Martin Wimpress, (lead of Ubuntu Desktop at Canonical)\nWARNING:\nUsing Rolling Rhino will put you off-topic for sites such as this, just like my own use of the development cycle does.  (I moved to\ngroovy the day after the release of focal, I'll move to the h series the day or so after groovy becomes 20.10, and I've been on the\ndevelopment cycle since artful or before became 17.10, and know from experience problems can occur). You need to be aware that you'll have less support options using Rolling Rhino thus the warning given \"for the toughest of Ubuntu users\" should not be taken lightly !\n\nA: There is no official rolling release, all the supported Ubuntu derivative releases (Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Lubuntu, Edubuntu, Ubuntu Studio and Mythbuntu) are based on the Ubuntu release schedule, 6 months per released version and 1 LTS version every 2 years.\nThere are many rolling releases with unstable Debian based, ie:\n\n\n*\n\n*Aptosid\n\n*Linux Mint LMDE\n\n*AntiX\nThe closest that you will find from a rolling release supported by the Ubuntu base and using Ubuntu packages is +1, run it always on alpha or beta.\nThere is nothing wrong with assuming that Ubuntu +1 is something like a rolling release except for the fact that there is an EOL for the versions and once a version is released you have to force the system to use Ubuntu +1 again. It does not really fit the criteria for the name rolling release.\nIt's not a rolling release per se, but is the closest you will get.\nRolling releases (by definition) goes against what Ubuntu fights for every 6 months, basically before each release, packages are imported from Debian Unstable continuously and merged to the Ubuntu repos with modifications done for Ubuntu. A month before release, imports are frozen, and packagers then work to ensure that the frozen features interoperate well together.\nIts a lot of work to be done and supply you with stable packages.\n\nTo move your system to the next release use the command sudo update-manager -d, it will allow you to install the packages from the future release\n\nYou will receive constant updates for this until the version is really released in April 2012, after that you will be able to apply the command again and update to the next future release after a couple of days.\nPlease note that this is not the intent of Ubuntu and that (as mostly any rolling release) the packages might break your system. If you are not so familiar with recovering a broken system this is not really advisable. Having said that I have to explain that depending on the skills some Ubuntu users \"live\" on Ubuntu +1 (mostly bug catchers and developers, but they exist).\nIn the end, it's up to you: the unstable world of Ubuntu +1 or the stable comfortable sight of updated stable packages every 6 months.\n\nA: Bruno's answer works but since that was made, there has been a new way to do it without the hassle.\nFrom the Ubuntu GNOME Blog (works for all Ubuntu variants also!)\n\nThere is a release called devel.\nIf you put that in /etc/apt/sources.list instead of utopic/vivid etc, you will be kicked over the new devel version a few days after it opens.\n  No need to ever upgrade to the next version/release; just a dist-upgrade is enough.\nThese days, the devel series are a bit stable, there are lots of automated testing, that makes sure everything is installable and passes tests before it propagates to the main archive. There is the odd issue that slips through the tests, but they get fixed quickly and while we wouldn’t recommend it for a full production system, the people that want the latest and greatest GNOME and tinker a bit, would be fine on it.\nThis is how to edit /etc/apt/sources.list\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Open /etc/apt/sources.list\n\n*Replace the codename of your installed Ubuntu (vivid, willy, etc.) with devel\n\n*Save and run sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nOnce the next cycle starts, you don’t need to do anything except wait!\n\n\nA: For now, you might want to try Bodhi Linux. It is a Partly Rolling Release & is Ubuntu based.\n", "Q: Intel HD audio codec power management Is it possible to enable power management for intel-hda sound card audio codec ?

IIRC, gnome2 had the possibility to setup a .icon folder in your home directory and put some icons in it named as the executable you want it it assigned to.\nThen nautilus would use this icon for the launchers. I tried this while running Unity and it did not work. \nIs this not possible in Unity or did I just catch an app that does not work with custom icons?\n\nA: I have not used that method before, IMO easiest method of editing icons in your menu is to use alacarte \nYou can install it with\nsudo apt-get install alacarte\n\nYou can also put icon sets in ~/.icons and configure Unity to use them with gnome-tweak-tool \nYou can install it with\nsudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool\n\n\nA: As already mentioned, you can use ~/.icons folder with gnome-tweak-tool. It is easy. Put icon theme in ~/icons folder, install gnome-tweak-tool, open it, go to 'Theme' and change 'Icon theme'.\n\nA: In Unity the icons assigned to an application are specified in the .desktop file that application. They're a little tricky to edit since nautilus won't associate an text editor with .desktop files and the name displayed in Nautilus isn't the actual file name. You need to go to the command line to initiate an edit. 1st cd /usr/share/applications and then ls to see the actual files names, for example gthumb.desktop. From the cli you can run gksudo gedit gthumb.desktop or whatever file you wish to change. Goto the Icon= line and change the icon name.

I'm on Ubuntu 11.04. My root partition is filling up and I can't figure out what's causing it. Even stranger, when I run df -h, this is the output:\nFilesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda2             9.2G  8.8G     0 100% /\n\nAs you see, there should be about 400 MB free, but Avail shows 0. What could be causing this? I've even uninstalled some programs to free the space and it fills up again. Suggestions on how to find out which, if any, files are filling up the space are also welcome.\n\nA: A first shot: High traffic in an error log. I guess if you would download videos, you would know it. :) \n sudo du -sh /var/log\n\n\n\n*\n\n*-s is summary \n\n*-h is human readable (k, M, G, T) suffix \n\n\nFor me it is 20M, and beside the log-directory, there is a cache for the installations. Use \n apt-get clean \n\nIf this is your problem. \nOf course, you should check /home if it is in your root partition. \nIf you have to search big files iteratively, I can suggest a series of commands, which can be repeated and is pretty fast after the first initial step: \n\n\n*\n\n*You start at a suspicious directory at top level\n\n*Then you search all subdirs and files for their size, and sort numerically: \n\n\n\nsudo du -s /var/* | sort -n \n0   /var/crash\n4   /var/www\n44  /var/games\n124 /var/run\n2306    /var/tmp\n18538   /var/log\n251876  /var/cache\n1053231 /var/lib\n\n\n\n*\n\n*I stripped the example, to keep it short. So we see, that the bigest subdir is /var/lib, and repeat the step for /var/lib. Now the search is much faster, because the computated results are somehow cached:\n\n\n\nsudo du -s /var/lib/* | sort -n \n78116   /var/lib/apt-xapian-index\n104580  /var/lib/dpkg\n680503  /var/lib/postgresql\n\nand so on. Follow the biggest dirs to find the bigger files. You can't use -sh here, because sorting numerically does not work with the k/M/G/T for kilobyte and so on. \n\nA: When formatted, ext2/3/4 filesystem reserves a certain percent of disk space for exclusive use by the root user. By default it's 5%. The purpose of this is that the system can continue working and is able to boot even if non-privileged users fill up all the disk space available to them.\nIn general, filling up any filesystem beyond 95% of its capacity is not a good idea as this is causing excessive fragmentation which results in performance degradation - even after you free up the disk space.\nFrom man mke2fs:\n   -m reserved-blocks-percentage\n          Specify the percentage of the filesystem blocks \n          reserved for the super-user.  This avoids fragmenta‐\n          tion,  and  allows  root-owned  daemons, such as \n          syslogd(8), to continue to function correctly after\n          non-privileged processes are prevented from writing \n          to the filesystem.  The  default  percentage  is 5%.\n\nIf you're absolutely desperate, you can use tune2fs to change this value. See man tune2fs for more info\n", "Q: Ubuntu 11.10 on Asus K53TA Laptop no screen error?

For eg. gNewSense id based on Ubuntu or Ubuntu is based on Debian etc.\nSo Can anyone please tell what does this statement exactly means??\n\nA: It means that Ubuntu developers took Debian, added their tweaks and changes and called this Ubuntu. In turn, gNewSense developers took Ubuntu, added their tweaks and changes and called this \"gNewSense\". You or me, in turn, can take gNewSense, add something new and make another distribution.\nAl of them - Debian, Ubuntu and gNewSense - are Linux distributions, i.e. collections of software based around Linux kenel and GNU software.\n", "Q: Why is the size of my .Private folder so large? Last night I had about 190GB of free space on my 500GB HDD.  Today I have about 80GB free.  I ran df and discovered that my /home/jon/.Private folder is currently using 80% of my hard drive.\nWhat.  The.  Hell.\nI really don't need to encrypt my files that bad.  Can anyone tell me why I've lost so much space to this, and what I can do to recover as much free space as possible?\nI realize that I'm not going to get back 330-something odd GB of space, but I lost 100GB overnight.  I'm new enough to Ubuntu (and Linux in general) that I don't want to proceed without a firm understanding of what's going on here.\nThanks in advance, guys.\n\nA: Since its contents are encrypted, you are unlikely to be able to tell much by looking at the files in ~/.Private directly.\nInstead, you'd be better off looking at the unencrypted view of those same files in ~/Private.  The ecryptfs system has quite a low overhead, so if ~/.Private is large it is likely because you've placed a lot of data in ~/Private (or a program running on your behalf has done so).\n\nA: I just went through a similar situation on Ubuntu 16.04. Not having ever set up the ~/Private folder, but with the ~/.Private folder taking up 90% of disk space available. In my case I had enabled the /home folder encryption option during install; it seems that in such case the ~/.Private folder is set up automatically for the purpose. You can verify it, if the ~/.Private folder is a link to /home/.encryptfs this is most likely the case:\n$ ll ~/.Private\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 user user 33 nov  1 16:25 /home/user/.Private -> /home/.ecryptfs/user/.Private/\n\nI do not know exactly what causes this expansion of the encrypted file system, but it is basically the ~/.Trash folder. I just needed to empty the Trash in the DE to bring things back to normal. I suspect that when single files are removed from the Trash they somehow remain in the encrypted file system; emptying the Trash fixes this.\nNote that it may take several minutes for the system to report the correct space usage after the Trash is emptied. \n", "Q: How do I get LibreOffice with Presenter Console to display notes and next slide? I am running LibreOffice 3.4.3 with Sun Presenter Console 1.0.3 on Ubuntu 11.10 on a Dell Inspiron 1545 laptop. \nI would like to be able to view the notes for the current slide on my laptop while the slide is being presented full-screen through the attached projector.  Instead, all I can get on the laptop during a presentation is the normal view, where I have to manually advance to get from one slide to another. \nIs there a way to configure my settings so the two displays stay in sync on the same slide but one shows notes and the other doesn't?\n\nA: espertus,\nI had exactly your problem. on exactly the same software you have. This is how I solved it:\n\n\n*\n\n*get rid of everything that wasn't ubuntu-provided (including the Sun Presenter Console)\n\n*install the ubuntu-provided console with sudo apt-get install libreoffice-presenter-console\n\n*reboot\nNote that bullet 3. is essential. I don't know why, but if you don't reboot it will never work (just restarting LO won't work).\n\nA: Unfortunately, the Presenter Console is completely broken and has been for a couple of years. It appears to me to be abandonware, and getting Sun to fix anything was nigh impossible (I don't know about Oracle). It doesn't work on any computer I've tried, across multiple versions of Ubuntu and LibreOffice/OpenOffice. It's a shame that it no longer works, as I found it really useful.\nHere's the workaround I've found: Install pdf-presenter-console. It takes a PDF file and presents it. You can easily export Impress presentations to PDF, although there are a few features you can't use in such a case.\nAdvantages of pdf-presenter-console:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uses PDF files.\n\n*Works as advertised.\n\n*Includes a timer.\n\n\nDrawbacks:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can only use PDF files.\n\n*No support for notes.\n\n*No support for animation\n\n*The timer can't be disabled, though if you pass -d 0 it won't run.\n\n*Can only be launched from the command line unless you make your own custom .desktop file.\n\n\nA: I used Presenter Console last night and it worked just fine.  I am using Ubuntu 12.04LTS and Libre Office 3.6.0.2.  I down loaded the Presenter from a link on the LO site (The document foundation), and used LO Extension Manager to get Presenter into my Libre Office.\nI had my LAPTOP connected using it's VGA port which was cabled to the projectors DVI imput.\nMy laptop screen was two images, the larger being the Projected image and the smaller image was the next image in the Impress slide show sequence, I also has a clock for the current time and a clock for the presentation time.

For years, I've had the following in my sudoers file:\nscott   ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL\n\nFor those who don't know, this prevents sudo and friends (gksudo, etc.) from asking for a password. However, over the years, more and more stuff that once used sudo has been switched to using PolicyKit.\nI'm looking for an equivalent configuration for PolicyKit, such that it'll never ask me for my password.\nFor those who don't like my request, let me say this: I understand the reasons for the default configuration, and they are sound. I also understand the risks inherent in the configuration I want to make. Nevertheless, it's the way I want to set up my system. Those who don't fully understand the above shouldn't attempt what I'm attempting.\n\nA: You can use the same technique Ubuntu's Live CD uses by tricking PolicyKit and suppressing ALL password prompts by substituting the action with a wildcard.\nDISCLAIMER: The following will suppress ALL password prompts globally for everyone belonging to the admin group, with the exception of the login screen. It is EXTREMELY dangerous and should NEVER be implemented because chances are YOU WILL END UP BREAKING YOUR SYSTEM!!\nDon't say you weren't warned!\nNOTE: If you are running 12.04 or later, substitute \"admin\" with \"sudo\"!\nReplace \"username\" with your actual user name:\nusermod -aG admin username\n\nSwitch to root:\nsudo -i\n\nCreate a new policy:\ngedit /var/lib/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/disable-passwords.pkla\n\nAdd the following:\n[Do anything you want]\nIdentity=unix-group:admin\nAction=*\nResultActive=yes\n\nSave and exit. Then go try something that usually requires a password. :)\nNOTE: It doesn't matter what you use as your .pkla file name. You can name it anything you want.\nAnd last, this is the ONLY policy you'll need when it comes to suppressing password prompts because again, it does so globally.\n\nA: You can create a .pkla, either an all in one or a couple based on action groups, doesn't really matter.\nFor reference look in /usr/share/polkit-1/actions, open interested ones in a text editor to get action id's.\nAs far as a .pkla or 2 I find the best place to put them is here, it will be protected from any updates \n/var/lib/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d\n\nSo for example here is my main one, named package-manager.pkla though it extends a bit further than just package management policy's\n[Install package file]\nIdentity=unix-group:admin\nAction=org.debian.apt.install-file;org.debian.apt.update-cache;org.debian.apt.install-or-remove-packages;org.debian.apt.upgrade-packages\nResultActive=yes\n\n[Install package synaptic]\nIdentity=unix-group:admin\nAction=com.ubuntu.pkexec.synaptic\nResultActive=yes\n\n[Change add repo]\nIdentity=unix-group:admin\nAction=com.ubuntu.softwareproperties.applychanges;org.debian.apt.change-repository\nResultActive=yes\n\n[usbcreator format]\nIdentity=unix-group:admin\nAction=com.ubuntu.usbcreator.format\nResultActive=yes\n\n[Install bootloader]\nIdentity=unix-group:admin\nAction=com.ubuntu.usbcreator.bootloader\nResultActive=yes\n\n[Add users]\nIdentity=unix-group:admin\nAction=org.freedesktop.accounts.user-administration\nResultActive=yes\n\nNote that starting in 12.04 the group used for \"admin\"  user should be changed to sudo, ie. \nIdentity=unix-group:sudo\n\nAlso note that actions can be strung together per section, no spaces, use a ; in between id's\n", "Q: Internal Speakers not functioning after removing headphone I am using Ubuntu 11.10.

File sharing website MegaUpload has recently been shut down because they were hosting copyrighted files and therefore participating in copyright infringement.  This has caused other file sharing websites to shut down over similar fears.\nI can definitely see the possibility of copyrighted files being shared on Ubuntu One.  Does Ubuntu One have to fear the possibility of being shutdown at some time in the future?\n\nMegaUpload Shut Down by the Feds, Founder Arrested\nhttp://torrentfreak.com/megaupload-shut-down-120119/\nCyberlocker Ecosystem Shocked As Big Players Take Drastic Action\nhttp://torrentfreak.com/cyberlocker-ecosystem-shocked-as-big-players-take-drastic-action-120123/\n\nA: I asked Ubuntu One about the MegaUpload situation and the Ubuntu One cyberlocker. Is it possible, etc. Their response is attached below. I don't know how many people use Ubuntu One for file sharing via the sharing capabilities. I know I share our family photo's and home videos with my family and share the URL with them for easy distribution. \nI agree that Ubuntu One does not market itself as a file sharing service. It has a legal music store, etc. I don't believe it would be targeted. Regarding Deja Dup, I use it. Of course it gets backed up to my removable drive as well as my Ubuntu One Cloud. \nI feel secure in the way Ubuntu One is marketed that they would not be a target of any government action. Also, Ubuntu One states that will take down after notification copyrighted material. This is part of Megaupload's issue. They did not remove files, just links.\n-\n- Their response:\n\n\"Ubuntu One is not necessarily a file sharing service. We sync your\n  files between your devices. If you wish to share a photo, you own,\n  with a friend their is nothing wrong with that. I imagine this is\n  similar to sending email with attachments, We have strict policy about\n  sharing copyrighted material. It is not allowed and will be taken down\n  as soon as we are notified of such an incidence.\nI would definitely backup all data on your computer, and data on\n  Ubuntu One, Ubuntu One is a file sync service not a backup disaster\n  recovery service. changes made locally are synced to all devices and\n  cloud storage. This can be unexpected for someone expecting a static\n  backup of that file they just deleted. We are working on versioning\n  and un-delete and hope to have it available this year.\nOne good back up solution is Deja Dup in 11.10 it allows yo to upload\n  to your Ubuntu One cloud space and create statin backups.\"\n\n\nA: From the \"Acceptable use and conduct\" section of the Ubuntu One Terms of Service:\n\nAll usage of the services must be legal and not infringe any third\n  party's rights. You must not take any action or use the services in\n  any way that might bring Canonical into disrepute, affect the ability\n  of Canonical to provide the services, be illegal, or encourage illegal\n  activities. You may not use the services in any manner that might be\n  libellous or defamatory (more info on what that\n  means), that\n  contains threats or incites violence towards individuals or entities,\n  or that violates the privacy or publicity rights of any third party.\n  Some services have usage limitations as indicated at\n  https://one.ubuntu.com/plans, and you may not exceed these. As part of\n  the services, you may store data on Canonical's servers or those of\n  Canonical's suppliers. You should ensure that this data is not in\n  breach of any applicable law and does not breach any individual's data\n  protection or privacy rights. You shall indemnify Canonical in full\n  for any loss, cost or damages suffered by it as a result of your use\n  or misuse of the services.\n\nI'm not a lawyer, but I think that makes it pretty clear that Canonical does not allow for Ubuntu One to be potentially used for piracy on a large scale.\nAt any rate, I don't think Ubuntu One is in any danger as file-sharing is not its primary purpose: synchronization between your own personal machines is. I'm not a user of file-sharing sites like Megaupload, but in their case (from what I understand) their site was primarily meant for sharing vast quantities of files between anonymous users. If Canonical's primary plan for Ubuntu One was to facilitate piracy, then they would be more likely to become a target.\n\nA: There is absolutely no chance that Ubuntu One will be shutdown by \"the feds\", if you are referring to government agencies in USA. Ubuntu One is not located in the USA, but in the United Kingdom. However, Europeans are also under pressure, and there are initiatives like ACTA that might make things difficult in the future. I would consider it unlikely that Ubuntu One would be shut down. However, if you use your U1 account in an inappropriate manner, you should expect your account to be shut down by Canonical. \n\nA: I read where the US claims Dot Com and Dot Net web addresses give it jurisdiction because the registry is physically located in Virginia. \nSo regardless where in the world it is hosted or the files are located, if it is a dot com or dot net address, it's US jurisdiction. Verisign administers those Top level domains.\n\nA: If Hollywood or the FBI decide to shut down Ubuntu One, it does not really matter what Ubuntu One, Mark, the SLA or the Pope say. Everybody is at risk today.\n\nA: The basis of the indictment was that Megaupload's business model inherently promoted or at the very least condoned illegal activity. \nPrimarily, Megaupload and the Megavideo service were used to share zipped music albums, TV series and movies. \nAccording to this Wikipedia article: \n\n\n*\n\n*\"In practice, the \"vast majority\" of users do not have any significant long term private storage capability.\"\nThe difference here is obvious.\n\n*\"Because only a small portion of users pay for storage, the business is dependent upon advertising.\"\nIf you are familiar at all with television streaming websites you understand this part of the model well. These sites are often loaded with pay per impression ads and pop ups, and sometimes warez as well. I have yet to see any ads on Ubuntu One.\n\n*\"Infringing users did not have their accounts terminated, and the defendants \"made no significant effort to identify users who were using the Mega Sites or services to infringe copyrights, to prevent the uploading of infringing copies of copyrighted materials, or to identify infringing copies of copyrighted works\".\"\nAgain, this is not the stated mission of Ubuntu One.\n\n*\"An incentive program was adopted encouraging the upload of \"popular\" files in return for payments to successful uploaders.\" \nThis is an obvious move to foster black hat activity. \nSo I'd wager Ubuntu One is pretty safe in its current iteration.\n", "Q: No 3D after Ubuntu 11.10 updates - T420s Intel Sandy Bridge At rebooting my Lenovo ThinkPad T420s after the recent updates coming last Friday (not sure), I got severe graphical problems: could almost not use unity.\nI switched from Intel to Nvidia and loaded the restricted driver.

In that case, my java-script on the client side can just use this file to constantly refresh an image.\nAny ideas and suggestions are greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Yeah you're on the right path. Deal with standard images and update it with javascript.\nYou should have a look at webcam which is a little command line app that just snaps away and can upload over FTP. If you don't have an FTP server (eg only SSH) you could mount that and have it upload that way.\nOne note about refreshing the images: stick '?var=' + (new Date).getTime() on the end of the image URL each time you fetch it. This just forces the browser not to use a cached copy. And make sure you don't set the refresh interval too aggressive.\n\nA: To share webcam and mic, you can always just create a jitsi.org meeting (ie, WebRTC; or with any alternative).

It means, if root login is disabled in Ubuntu, you don't gain anything from adding a new difference from upstream, a difference that you will have to manage in every release and update.\n\nA: But while root login IS effectively disabled, having \"PermitRootLogon yes\" prevents fail2ban from being able to impose an IP ban on the offending address, because the expected error message is not logged in auth.log.

You may uninstall it, and reinstall the original version, meant to be used by ubuntu. Ubuntu makes heavy use of python, so it should be kept intact. But you should be able to add a second version in parallel - it just might not be a good idea to make this second version the default. \n", "Q: Starting and stopping server with a desktop shortcut I use\nsudo /opt/lampp/lampp start\n\nand\nsudo /opt/lampp/lampp stop\n\nevery time in order to start and stop the lampp server installed in my computer.\nIs there some way by which I can create an icon on my desktop, so that the above command get executed in terminal simply by clicking on the icon?\nThanks in advance\n\nA: Without being clever, you can create two launchers for your desktop to start and stop.

However, I've googled the issue and now I'm able to mount the card. But, I don't know what difference the command made that enabled the SD card to mount and usable? Please help!!\nHere is the command I've used to change the settings.\nsudo mkdir /media/MMCSD\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\nthen deleted the line starting with /dev/sdb1\nthen replaced it with the command below\n/dev/hdb1 /media/MMCSD vfat auto,user,sync,exec,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=007 0 0 \n\nThis did the magic. Please explain.\n\nA: Which bit don't you understand?\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo mkdir /media/MMCSD created a directory for you to mount the SD card to. Mounts require a \"mount point\", this is yours.\n\n*sudo nano /etc/fstab this edits /etc/fstab as root.\n\n*/dev/hdb1 /media/MMCSD vfat auto,user,sync,exec,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=007 0 0 is the mount command. When the system boots, it looks for the device /dev/hdb1 and mounts it at your new mount point. It sets the filesystem to vfat (a fairly typical filesystem for a SD as well as setting a number of fairly default options to allow you to use the drive from your user account.\n\nA: On top of Oli's excellent answer: \nfstab stands for file system table. It is a configuration file that tells the operating system what disk partition the Os needs to mount, as well as the mount point in your file tree. You can also mount/unmount paritions dynamically (see man mount). \nThe line you added to the file tells the the OS to mount the partition /dev/hdb1 at the mount point /media/MMCSD (your first step made sure the directory existed). The other options are fairly default, as mentioned.\n", "Q: Is it possible to queue file transfers in Nautilus like in Krusader? I have heard that Krusader has a great \"commander\" feature that allows you to start a file transfer and queue additional files to be transferred. They are transferred one by one in order, rather than kinda randomly all at once.\nIs it possible to do this in Nautilus (or with an existing Nautilus extension), or is Nautilus not intended for this kind of thing?\n\nA: Is it currently possible? No. Would it be awesome? Yes.\nI don't think it's a case of not being intended, it's just something that hasn't been done. If memory serves correctly, it took KDE a while to get it done.\nAnd it's all fairly low-level stuff. It's not a simple bash script that's running cps and mvs in the background so I don't think it's going to be as easy to hack into as you might like.\nYou might want to find a GIO developer (assuming it's still GIO that handles these things) and shake them until you know why this isn't in there yet. Unfortunately, GIO developers are a stealthy and paranoid bunch. They know you're looking for them so you might have to file a bug against it on the Gnome bug tracker to lure one out.\nBut in seriousness, remember the devs don't work for you (unless, bizarrely they do work for you -- which would be a strange coincidence). If you do find one, try not to startle them by running up to them, shouting and waving your arms around. Just quietly ask if it's a planned feature and if there's anything you can do to help.\n\nA: It is not possible in Nautilus, but it may not need to be. (Although see Oli's answer on requesting such a feature.)\nThe KDE equivalent of Nautilus is Dolphin, also a file manager with navigational and spatial features. Neither aims to be an orthodox (\"two-pane\") file manager, which Krusader is, so comparing Nautilus and Krusader features doesn't (necessarily) make sense.\nInstead, you may want to simply use Krusader, or a Gnome-based orthodox file manager, namely Gnome Commander.\n", "Q: Where do lucid-updates come from?

Occasionally I think of enhancements for open source software applications I use. Generally I track down wherever it is the project is hosted and log an request. I do not intend to contribute any code, I just want to make a suggestion.\nSome projects have guidelines for such requests (not allowing them, allowing them but frowning on \"me toos\", etc), but others don't. Are there any broadly applicable guidelines or widely referred to articles on how to do this appropriately? (And any notes on making a request from an Ubuntu context?)\n\nA: *\n\n*Ask in the right place.\nOne thing that really annoys developers is people asking things in the wrong place. This applies to all sorts of communications and finding out the right way for a particular project does take some investigative work.\nStart with the project documentation. Most large projects have a section about bugs and these tend to hint at where the best place is for certain types of bug. If the project is smaller or more informal, direct communication (email or chat/IRC) isn't a bad idea.\nIf the developer does get annoyed with you for sending direct emails and you've looked for alternatives, it's sort of their fault for not making it clear.\nIn our (Ubuntu's) context, Launchpad for bugs, Brainstorm for wider feature requests. In a lot of cases you want to swim upstream to where the project lives though. If you can get something fixed or added upstream, them you can talk to the Ubuntu maintainers about getting the patch or update pulled into Ubuntu.\n\n*Check that there isn't an existing request.\nWe close a lot of duplicates here and I know Launchpad does too. Duplicates waste people's time because they have to go through the triage process. If you can find an existing thread about something, go there.\nMost trackers have a \"subscribe\" feature so you can stay up to date. If the progress looks stalled, I don't think too many people would mind a \"What's the progress?/Can I do anything to help?\"-style poke.\n\n*Be polite. Be thorough. Be helpful.\nWe are almost never owed anything by an open source developer (except in the case where you hire them outright) so just remember that they're people with lives and jobs. Your requests should be clear, courteous and complete to avoid wasting time going through a waterfall of need-more-info/incomplete requests.\nRegardless of your ability, always find out if there's anything you can do to help a situation. Even if you can't help directly if you can tease out what needs to happen from the developer, other people can help. If you know people who could do certain elements, you could introduce them to the thread and ask if they fancy a crack at helping you.\n\n*If you can, think about donating, sponsoring or hiring.\nYeah I think I'm suggesting bribery. If you really need a feature to the point where not having it costs you money (directly or through wasted time), I don't think it's unfair to want to directly sponsor an improvement.\nA lot of projects don't like cash-for-bug payments but some developers may be open to it. They are people and people (unfortunately) need money. I have hired a small project's main developer for a day to improve something that was commercially very important to me but was very low-level on the scale of the project.\nIf you can't get anybody in the project to help there are always freelance sites where people code for cash. I see no reason you couldn't hire somebody to work on your bug, pushing patches to the bug tracker for review. Just make it clear that they need to work to the guidelines set out in the project and explicitly state how their work will be licensed.\nThis isn't really a very sustainable way of doing things but it is a way of giving back that might directly help you. It's worth a look if you're ever desperate.\n", "Q: LINUX and C : What does it mean this condition, and how to install the required packages in order to return true Using linux ubuntu with metasploit framework, i have a shell script which contains the following lines in the first begining of the file.

Ever since then, things do not print as they have been assigned to. It is printing tiny, and landscape always. I have since disabled Cloud Print on Chromium, signed out of all gmail services, even re-installed the drivers from Brother. But still it is printing improperly. I have an Acer netbook (Ubuntu 11.10 32 Bit) that I have the MFC-295CN installed on and when I Print from that (connected via the USB) it prints perfectly fine. How can I get my Desktop to print normally again?\nThank you for your time and answers.\n** Just remembered as well, when in LibreOffice I printed to file rather then Printer, it still printed that document improperly. It did not print to what I specified.\n\nA: Well turns out for me it was Google Cloud print that caused this.

I have read about the Unity HUD.\nIs that a mock up or a real thing? Can I install it on my current Ubuntu 11.10 installation or do I need to upgrade to 12.04?\n\nA: The HUD (Head-Up Display) arrived in early March in the development release of Ubuntu (Precise).  So there is no more need to go to a PPA to try it out.\nJust press the \"alt\" key to bring up the HUD.\nTed Gould's page about Searching Menus has some important insights and tips on the fuzzy matching algorithm used by HUD and how it tracks your menu usage.  It also notes the fun \"hud-cli\" command for command-line operation by users of the terminal, and has tips for how developers can make HUD work better for their apps.\nBefore selecting a menu item you're not familiar with, I suggest navigating to it with the down arrow and paying attention to which icon is displayed to the left of the \"Type your command\" box.  That tells you which indicator or application the menu item comes from.  E.g. if you're in the terminal application, press alt and type \"date\", and select \"Date > UTC\", you don't just find out what the current date is in UTC.  You actually choose the \"UTC\" entry (if you have one) under the Date menu and change the system timezone to the selected zone....\n\nA: I guess you could also compile the project from the Launchpad branches. As Mark Shuttleworth has pointed out, there are two branches needed, this one and this one. \nSo even if this is going to be in Ubuntu 12.04, any Ubuntu user with Unity could in theory compile the newest version of Unity, then these two branches, and HUD should work. But the process could be a little bumpy. \n\nA: If you are running 12.04, you already have the HUD. Just tap Alt. The HUD is not available for 11.10.\n", "Q: gnome-terminal ignores gtk theme I run oneiric with fluxbox as the window manager, and gnome-terminal appears to disregard gtk theme. The theme support does work in other gtk applications (for example, in gthumb and in firefox), but changing the theme makes no difference for gnome-terminal. I have oneiric, and I use lxappearance to change the theme. Am I wrong in assuming that gnome-terminal is a gtk application? Or is the problem elsewhere?\n\n\n*\n\n*Note that the checkbox \"Use colours from system theme\" in gnome-terminal configuration does not solve the problem, nor it is supposed to, since I am interested in the look and size of the menu, and the tabs, not their colour. ]\n\n*LXAppearance version is 0.5.1, and so it appears that it is GTK3 compatible. It even creates the file gtk-3.0/settings.ini in the home directory which contains the selected settings. This, I think, rules out http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=631897 as a possible cause.\n\nA: LXAppearance is the culprit after all. See https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=125540\nI tried copying the configuration file created by it to .config/gtk-3.0. After restarting gnome-terminal, the menus disappeared completely (or to be precisely everything is nearly zero-sized, and there is text). After commenting the .config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini line-by-line the culprit is gtk-font-name. Anyhow, this proves that gnome-terminal is a GTK3 app which does read the settings. \nSolution  was to install gnome-themes-standard and edit .config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini to  say \"gtk-theme-name=Adwaita\" (it is the only theme in the package, but it suits me fine). \nFinal remark: confusingly in the directory /usr/share/themes many themes have gtk-3.0 subfolder without being GTK3 themes. I hope it is of help to someone.\n\nA: This may not be a solution for you if you're trying to avoid too many Gnome dependencies, but I solved it by making sure gnome-settings-daemon was starting in my .xinitrc: after starting that, all my GTK2/3 applications suddenly paid attention to a whole load of settings they'd previously been ignoring. You can then use gnome-tweak-tool to change themes (or possibly lxappearance and then log out & in again?).\nI don't know where it lives on Ubuntu, but I found it in /usr/lib/gnome-settings-daemon/gnome-settings-daemon on my Arch system (it used to live in the $PATH before Gnome 3).\nHope that helps!\n", "Q: Changing hostnames in bulk I just need to rename the hostnames of all the Desktops based on their IP Addresses. For example if the IP address is 172.29.72.25 hostname should be assigned as node25, if the IP address is 172.29.72.26 hostname should be node26 etc etc. I have keybased ssh access to all these hosts. I thing this is possible via bash script, can someone help me? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Hostname is stored in /etc/hostname\nWhere address is a list of your IP addresses :\nfor A in `cat address` ; do NODE=\"node`echo $A | cut -d. -f4`\" ; ssh $A \"echo $NODE > /etc/hostname\" ; done\n\nFor each IP, we cut the last field off, prefix it with \"node\" and write it to /etc/hostname\nNow, that ought to work, but it will only work if your user has write privileges to /etc/hostname, which by default, standard users don't have on Ubuntu.\nWhat you can do is feed your password to sudo via STDIN ; e.g. echo \"password\" | sudo -S  ; note that this is not secure, because you'll leave your password in your shell history. Find it with the history command and delete this with history -d <historyId>.\nDon't, of course, write your password to a plain text file in your home folder...\nSo, altogether\nfor A in `cat address` ; do \n    NODE=\"node`echo $A | cut -d. -f4`\"\n    ssh $A \"echo 'myPassword' | sudo -S echo $NODE > /etc/hostname\"\ndone\n\n-- edit\nIf you want to rewrite the hosts file on each machine, you could add a little awk to the mix ; replace the pattern 127\\.0\\.0\\. with one that actually matches your subnet. It will write the remaining lines of the file untouched.\n/^127\\.0\\.0\\./ {\n        split($1, quads, /\\./)\n        print $1 \"\\tnode\" quads[4]\n        next\n}\n\n{ print $0 }\n\nThis will replace all hostnames for IP addresses in your subnet with \"nodeN\" where N is the last quad of the IP address.\nSo we add these commands to the for A loop above (compressing the awk script onto a single line and escaping characters as required). We don't need to be root to read /etc/hosts, but we do need to be root to replace it after we write it's replacement to /tmp\nssh $A \"awk '/^127\\.0\\.0\\./ { split(\\$1, quads, /\\./) ; print \\$1 \\\"\\tnode\\\" quads[4] ; next } { print \\$0 }' /etc/hosts > /tmp/hosts.new\"\nssh $A \"echo 'myPassword' | sudo -S mv /etc/hosts /etc/hosts.old\"\nssh $A \"echo 'myPassword' | sudo -S mv /tmp/hosts.new /etc/hosts\"\n\n", "Q: qt4-x11 4.4.7.0 in Lucid Can this version of QT4 be successfully be installed on Lucid.

Given a directory containing a source tree, is there a simple way from command-line to replace each source file with its beautifully reformatted equivalent?\nKeep in mind that usually a source tree for a project also contains files which are not source, and the sources themselves could be in different languages.\nI'm looking for some tool that supports as many languages as possible, because a project usually contains sources in many different languages. In particular, I'd be looking for something supporting xml/html, javascript, ruby, and java.\n\nA: You could use vim in ex and command mode, from the terminal.\nTo indent a single file:\nvim -c \"normal gg=G\" -e <file-to-indent> <<'EOF'\n:wq\nEOF\n\nTo indent files recursively, create the following script:\nindent-with-vim.sh\nvim -c \"normal gg=G\" -e $1 <<'EOF'\n:wq\nEOF\n\nNow, type:\n$ chmod u+x indent-with-vim.sh\n$ find . | xargs -I {} ./indent-with-vim.sh {}\n\nVim will do its best to reindent the files.

I've been using ubuntu server for a while, however I have never really invested time into iptables. I was wondering if there was a recommended way to setup iptables on a basic server intall. An iptables boilerplate essentially.\nAlso, an explanation of all of the most commonly used ubuntu server ports would be very helpful.\n\nA: It is fantastic that you are interested in iptables.\nAs you can see, however, there is a bit of a learning curve.\nThe basics are\nAll services listen on ports. One analogy would be an apartment complex, your ports are analogous to apartment numbers.\nCommon ports are \nFTP - 21\nSSH - 22\nApache - HTTP 80 ; HTTPS 443\nYou can get a complete list of ports from a google search or /etc/services\nThis might help as well\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/C/index.html\nFrom there, enter iptables. As a firewall, iptables is one way of limiting access.\nBasically you have 3 broad options.\n\n\n*\n\n*Public servers, ie apache. Here you will allow all traffic and blacklist bad acting IP (spammers)\n\n*Private servers, ie ssh. Here you will deny all traffic and white list authorized connections.\n\n*Limit. You may allow ping, but only at a certain rate.\nIf you are new to iptables, you may wish to start with ufw. ufw is a command line front end to iptables and is easier to learn. The syntax is very similar to iptables so it is easy to transition from ufw to iptables.\nSee:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo\nThat information should get you started. If you have a problem, feel free to ask a more specific question.\nI also have an introductory page to iptables if you like. I have maintained it over the years with feedback from people new to iptables, hope it helps.\nhttp://bodhizazen.com/Tutorials/iptables\n\nA: The recommended way (for beginners) is to enable ufw which in turn automatically sets up basic iptables rules for you:\nsudo ufw enable\n\nBasically this will block all unsolicited packets (for the full list of rules that are set up this way see sudo iptables -L).\nTo be able to connect to the server, you will have to allow a few ports, for instance\nsudo ufw allow 22/tcp\n\nto allow ssh etc. \n\nA: I recommend that you also add protection against some scan types and unusual (possibly malicious) tcp settings: \n\n-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,PSH,ACK,URG NONE  -j DROP\n-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,PSH,ACK,URG FIN,SYN,RST,PSH,ACK,URG -j DROP\n-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,PSH,ACK,URG FIN,PSH,URG -j DROP\n-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,PSH,ACK,URG FIN,SYN,RST,ACK,URG -j DROP\n-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN,RST -j DROP\n-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN FIN,SYN -j DROP\n-A INPUT -m state --state INVALID -j DROP\n\n(Via hideandhack.com.)\n", "Q: Can I snap windows by using Super Key? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWay to automatically resize 2 windows to take up half of the screen \n\nCan I snap windows to the left, right, maximize by doing Super+ArrowLeft, Super+ArrowRight, Super+ArrowUp ?\nThis is a feature in Windows 7 and is really useful.

I use Gnome3, but the same error has happened in Unity as well.\nApparently it works if I format the USB drive as NTFS or EXT3, EXT4. But, for many appliances, FAT is necessary.\nThe problem is also not with the USB port, because it works under Windows.\nIt did not happen before, when I had 10.04 installed.\n\nA: This is not about ubuntu. This is about file systems. Fat32's partitioning is different from New Technology File System (NTFS) or EXT. Because the partition sizes are different, you \"can\" have trouble about moving files to FAT32 from newer partitions.\nAdditionally, you can use \n`CONVERT X: /FS:NTFS`\n\nto convert your FAT32 driver to NTFS without data lose under Windows, CMD. But don't forget that; you won't be able to revert.\n\nA: The problem seems to be the file size not the type of usb device. I was trying to copy a vmware image over to my home directory and I received the \"Error splicing file: Input/output error\".. I then tried a 3 meg file. That copied over with no issue. I then split the vmware disk image into 10 meg files. This worked like a charm. I know this does not solve the problem but it does get you a work around until it's worked out.\nJust a note.... my file copy stopped at 62.7 meg each time.

I'm trying to figure out a way to get a list of the packages that are no longer available in the repositories that I have enabled. This workstation has been through quite a few versions of Ubuntu and has had many 3rd party repositories added and removed. I'd like to get a list of software that I have from these removed repositories, so I can clean it up or add back the appropriate repositories.\n\nA: To get a list of apps that are not in a Registered Repository or PPA do this:\nsudo apt-get install apt-show-versions\napt-show-versions | grep 'No available version'\n\nThat should output text like this:\napp1 1.0.0.14 installed: No available version in archive\napp23 0.3.6 installed: No available version in archive\napp332 7.0.9377 installed: No available version in archive\n\nFor me this worked and showed three apps I installed using DEB packages and weren't available in a Repo or PPA.\nDo remember though that it's impossible to check for all programs, only the ones that went through dpkg. For instance, some apps are installed by simply extracting them into the correct folders, or others use a standalone installer bin or script. So the best way is for you yourself to keep a list of apps you installed via any method other than APT.\n\nA: If you have aptitude installed use,\naptitude search '?obsolete'\n\nor its short form\naptitude search '~o'\n\nHere it is a sample output\ni A gcc-4.7-base - GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection (base package)\nid  libdb4.7     - Berkeley v4.7 Database Libraries [runtime]\ni   libudev0     - libudev shared library\n\nThe first character of each line indicates the current state of the package. The most common states are:\n\n\n*\n\n*p, meaning that no trace of the package exists on the system,\n\n*c, meaning that the package was deleted but its configuration files\nremain on the system,\n\n*i, meaning that the package is installed, and\n\n*v, meaning that the package is virtual.\n\n\nThe second character indicates the stored action to be performed on the package, if any, otherwise a blank space is displayed.\nThe most common actions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*i, meaning that the package will be installed,\n\n*d, meaning that the package will be deleted, and\n\n*p, meaning that the package and its configuration files will be removed.\n\n\nIf the third character is A, the package was automatically installed.\nFor a complete list of the possible state and action flags, see the section Accessing Package Information in the aptitude reference guide. \n\nA: aptitude search '~o'\n\nAptitude has some very powerful searching available.  Unfortunately the syntax is a bit unwieldy and you have to dig past the manpage to find the documentation, but its worth it.\napt-show-versions can also be helpful:\napt-show-versions | grep 'No available version'\n\n\nA: Starting with Ubuntu 19.10 it is also possible to run\napt list ?obsolete\n\nto get the list of obsolete packages.\nFor any release you could use the following Bash one-liner:\ncomm -23 <(dpkg-query -W -f '${db:Status-Abbrev}\\t${Package}\\n' | grep '^.[^nc]' | cut -f2 | sort) <(apt-cache dumpavail | sed -rn 's/^Package: (.*)/\\1/p' | sort -u)\n\nNo need to install extra packages for this, plus this is relatively fast. This will also find partially installed packages (but will not find those that have only configuration files remaining; that could be changed easily, though). Note: this does not care of which architecture the packages are.\nIf you want to include packages that have a different version installed than what is available from the repositories, you could you one of the following:\nUse modern apt:\n apt list --installed | awk -F/ '/\\[installed,local\\]/{print $1}'\n\nAs for Bionic (and maybe for earlier releases) there is yet another option:\nubuntu-support-status --show-unsupported\n\nread the package names under \"No longer downloadable:\" section.\nIf you use Focal or later release, you can use\nubuntu-security-status --unavailable\n\ninstead; you can read the package names below text \"packages are no longer available for download\". This is not the fastest option.\n\nA: More info to investigate.\n\nubuntu-support-status \necho \"$(sudo apt-mark showmanual | wc -l) packages marked as 'manually installed'.\"\n\n... ubuntu-support-status and apt-mark may require installation.\n\nA: There may be a cleaner way, but off the top of my head you can do\ndpkg -l | cut -f 3 -d ' ' > installed\nxargs -n 1 --replace=X apt-cache search ^X$ < installed | cut -f 1 -d ' ' > available\ndiff installed available\n\nCleanup the first few lines of the installed file: it will have headers.\nBonus if anyone can fix my syntax highlighting...\n\nA: As mentioned apt-get search is not a good method to check if a package is still available. Additional I've added everything to just one line:\nfor i in `dpkg -l | grep '^i' | awk '{ print $2 }'`; do apt-cache show $i > /dev/null || echo $i; done\n\n", "Q: How do I find out monitor make / model?

On the desktop, I have a script foo.sh and it outputs stdout to foo.log (e.g. with some command > foo.log)\nWhen I double click on the script, it generates the foo.log. However, I would like for the script to also present the stdout in real time (e.g. using tail -f foo.log).\nHow can I do this? Do I need to pipe the output to two places?\n\nA: This may not be the most elegant approach, but it appears to work:\nAdd the following to the script:\ntouch foo.log\nuxterm -e \"tail -f foo.log\" &\nsome command > foo.log\n\nwith gnome-terminal, replace uxterm -e with gnome-terminal -x. \nThanks to the Hilltop Yodeler for directing me to this solution.\n\nA: Unix's standard tee command allows you to redirect the command's standard input to one or more files and also print it to the standard output. So you can do something like\nmyscript.sh|tee mylog.log\n\nprovided that myscript.sh just prints to standard output (which would actually simplify it)\nTo open a terminal windows when you click on icon, you can wrap it in another script:\nxterm -e \"myscript.sh | tee mylog.log; read -p FINISHED\"\n\nThe difference with your solution is that you have a choice to either close the terminal window when the script finished or display \"Press any key to continue...\" message - with tail -f the terminal basically has no way of knowing when your script finished so you have to interrupt it with Ctrl-C. \nAlso, tail -f must be less efficient that printing directly to terminal, but this is probably not very important these days.\n\nA: I did Sergy's suggestion and if it worked, it may be a path problem.  Here is the exact command I used and the result was an xterm opening, showing the output of the script and then says \"Press return to close \".  I suggest you add path in front of the script name, and possibly the log file name.\nxterm -e \"./myscript.sh | tee ./mylog.log; read -p Press\\ return\\ to\\ close\\ \"\n\nAll my version of myscript.sh did was to echo several lines, but it worked.\n", "Q: What is a suitable place to ask for help when getting PPA build errors?

I have installed Compiz on Xubuntu 11.10 with\nsudo apt-get install compiz compizconfig-settings-manager\ncompiz --replace ccp &\n\nIn the process the XFCE window decoration theme is overridden by that of Compiz (Gtk) which uses the Adwaita theme instead of the Greybird theme. Since Gtk is doing window decoration, I cannot change it back using the XFCE settings.\nI just need compiz for scale and window switch and I would like to return window decoration to XFCE (Xfwm4) or to be able to change the Gtk window decoration theme.\nHow can I do that?\n\nI have found part of the (workaround) answer already:\n\n\n*\n\n*download Greybird Gtk theme\n\n*install theme (here is where I failed I think)\n\n*use dconf-editor to change the Gtk theme in org.gnome.desktop.interface\nThe problem really at stage 2 is where do I place the theme? I tried in ~/.themes/ and then changed the value of gtk-theme in the editor to Greybird. But I saw no change.\n\nA: installing gnome-tweak-tool would pull almost the entire Gnome as dependencies. I had the same problem today and I didn't want to install such a lot of unneeded stuff only to change one little setting and spent some time researching how these things are related and it seems it is indeed possible with gconf-editor (or gconftool-2) alone. \nThe key in gconf-editor is /apps/metacity/general/theme.\nType the name of an existing metacity theme into the text field (such as greybird and note that greybird is starting with a LOWERcase letter while most other themes are not!), hit enter and it should immediately change.\nYou can also change the arrangement of window buttons in /apps/metacity/general/button_layout (for example to move the window buttons to the right side where they traditionally belong use this: menu:minimize,maximize,close). Most other options in this section describe window behavior rather than style and don't have any effect on compiz, they would only be used by metacity.\n\nA: In XFCE/ Compiz , you have to use the Gnome Tweak Tool to change the window decoration, the XFCE settings only affect the GTK and icon themes.\nIf not installed, you can get Gnome Tweak Tool like this:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool\n\n\nA: I'm using xubuntu 17.10 and I'm experimenting with compiz. I use the Greybird theme but out of the box compiz window decorations do not follow the xfce theme. I had unwanted opacity in the title bar, ugly and non-themed window buttons, and a title bar which was too big. \nAfter compiz is active, try this: (thanks to arch linux documentation https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Compiz/Configuration#Workspaces_and_Viewports)\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences theme Greybird\n\nThis does on the fly changes. \nFor me, this changed the theme but I missed maximise and minimise buttons. They can be restored by\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences button-layout appmenu:minimize,maximize,close\n\nOr, you can use gnome-tweak-tool, click Windows and turn on Titlebar Buttons Maximise and Minimise\n\nA: Greybird is default theme for xubuntu and can be found in murrine-themes package in the repository. You can change install it with apt and change with xfce themes setting. Then try changing with dconf-editor. Also try gconf-editor and change window theme in shell section /desktop/gnome/shell/windows to Greybird if your dconf part doesnot work\n\nA: Install gconf-editor using apt and that works perfectly.\nInstall it using this command;\nsudo apt-get install gconf-editor\nThen either find \"Configuration Editor\" in your menu or type gconf-editor in a terminal.\n\nA: -Update in 16.04 \n-In Dconf-Editor org>gnome>metacity\nChange theme to desired theme.

I just installed ubuntu on my computer after that I instaled the recommended driver for Nvidia GeForce FX 5600XT and display resolution is 640x320 how can I change it to a higher resolution , I really would appreciate if somebody could help me ,thanks\n\nA: I followed these instructions to add 1680x1050 to my settings. It was pretty simple to follow:\nOpen the Terminal with Ctrl-Alt-T and type: xrandr Which will output something similar to this:\nScreen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1024 x 768, maximum 4096 x 4096\nVGA-0 connected 1024x768+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 0mm x 0mm\n   1360x768       59.8  \n   1024x768       60.0* \n   800x600        60.3     56.2  \n   848x480        60.0  \n   640x480        59.9     59.9  \nDVI-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nS-video disconnected (normal left inverted right x ax\n\nNext you'll add your monitor's resolution. For this example it's 1680x1050 so you would type this next in the terminal: cvt 1680 1050 and press return. \nYou will use the output of the the step above for the next step. Now past this (change to reflect your actual settings:\n1\nxrandr --newmode \"1680x1050_60.00\" 146.25 1680 1784 1960 2240 1050 1053 1059 1089 -hsync +vsync\n\nNext type:\n2\nxrandr --addmode VGA-0 1680x1050_60.00\n\nbe sure to replace the numbers with your own. This is where I had to change it a little from the tutorial I'll link to which goes into more detail. I had to change VGA-0 to VGA1 for it to work for me.\nNow you tell the server to display the new size:\n3\nxrandr --output VGA-0 --mode 1680x1050\n\nTo have the code appear in the Monitor settings panel you'll have to edit the gdm defaults by typing:\nsudo gedit /etc/gdm/Init/Default The settings will appear using the gedit code editor. \n\nFind these lines in the file:\nPATH=\"/usr/bin:$PATH\"\n\nOLD_IFS=$IFS\n\nYou'll add the three xrandr commands you've just entered which I've numbered in bold text above after those lines and save the file. \nIt worked for me.

The good news, is that it \"Just worked\". Meaning: I plugged it in, ran the gnome-lirc-properties and now I can control some parts of my desktop with it. \nIt seems, though, that it is not lirc handling it. I have killed lircd.

E.g. Volume up and down make the volume go up and down, mute works, the \"windows-button\" fires up banshee and so on. \nWhat is reading out my remote?

I don't know any real useful docs for how to configure it but /lib/udev/rules.d/95-keymap.rules and the files in /lib/udev/keymaps/ may give you some idea about how to do it.\n\nA: Like Florian said, Ubuntu is seeing the remote as a keyboard.\nYou can add the below to /etc/X11/xorg.conf to stop X from picking it up:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n  Identifier \"Remote\"\n  MatchProduct \"<your transceiver input name>\"\n  Options \"Ignored\" \"True\"\nEndSection\n\n(If there is no xorg.conf, just create it (sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf))\nTo get your input name:\ncat /proc/bus/input | grep Name\n\n(Just pick the one that seems closest to what you think it is, mine is \"Media Center Ed. eHome Infrared Remote Transceiver\")\nThen install lirc (sudo apt-get install lirc) and go through the setup process (I have to run sudo dpkg-reconfigure lirc to get the setup dialog to run for some odd reason)\nThen reboot (or run sudo restart lightdm and log back in)\n\nA: This is the correct version of the Option line:\nOption \"Ignore\" \"True\"\n\n", "Q: MySQL Administrator asks for password every time I have instlaled MySQL Administrator and it works fine, except one annoying thing.

A \"downgrade\" to kernel 2.6.39 fixed that issue.\n\n*No HDMI audio for Nvidia 8400GS (not a major issue to me but still, it works on WIN 7).\nI've search for various forum and bug listings with either no responses from Canonical or coders and zero solutions (I figured the kernel drop myself). \nIt seems kinda irresponsible to just drop system support that worked perfect recently just out of assumptions of someone getting a new system every few months.\nBackwards compatibility is what Linux developers and supporters constantly touts as it being excellent in. Unfortunately this isn't the case.\n\nA: I don't think I've ever heard anyone claim that backwards compatibility is Linux' strength. It's always been a huge weakness. But regressions happen. You file bugs when something doesn't work. You do that on Launchpad. Yes, Linux drops old hardware from time to time. You can't assume that a computer from 1995 will still be supported, for instance.

Which folders do I need to restore from a backup of my Ubuntu 11.10 installation to get the original state back except the harddisk change?\nDetails: \nI installed Ubuntu 11.10 on my internal SSD-Disk (SATA,60GB) and used my sofware-RAID5 array (3 internal disks, SATA) only for backups.\nI backed up the whole SSD-Disk with Back-In-Time(root). Now my SSD-disk failed and I plugged in a new disk (120GB, SATA) instead.\nThen I installed Ubuntu from a live-CD again. Then I installed \"mdadm\" and \"backintime\" from software center. \nMy RAID5 array wasn't shown in Nautilus and disk utilities, but I brought it back typing \"sudo mdadm --assemble --scan\" in a terminal window and mounting it in Nautilus afterwards. Backintime wasn't showing the snapshots until I changed the host name to the old name. Backintime now shows me following folders/files to restore:\n\n\n*\n\n*bin\n\n*boot\n\n*cdrom\n\n*dev\n\n*etc\n\n*home\n\n*lib\n\n*lib32\n\n*lib64\n\n*lost+found\n\n*media\n\n*mnt\n\n*opt\n\n*proc\n\n*root\n\n*run\n\n*sbin\n\n*selinux\n\n*srv\n\n*sys\n\n*tmp\n\n*usr\n\n*var\n\n*!initrd.img\n\n*vmlinuz\n\n*initrd.img.old\n\n*vmlinuz.old\n\n\nThen on my first try I restored every folder (which was a kind of silly, because it was deleting all the content of the excluded folder like \"sys\" instead of ignoring it). After rebooting, I got always the error \"error: no such device: 3b45...\" while booting and Ubuntu desktop didn't come up.\nThen on my second try after reinstalling Ubuntu I restored everything except following folders:\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev\n\n*/proc\n\n*/sys\n\n*/media\n\n*/mnt\n\n*/cdrom\n\n\nBut I still got the same error. Grub comes up, but then before showing the desktop it gets stuck with the same error message \"error: \nno such device: 3b45...\". So I installed Ubuntu from Live-Cd again.\nNow the important question for my third try is: which file or folder must I exclude to get my machine running? That means all my personal data and installed programs and ubuntu-updates back as it was like before, except that I now have got a different hard disk.\nMy back-in-time-settings of my last backup: \ninclude \"\\\", \nand excludes following folders/files:\n\n\n*\n\n*.gvfs\n\n*/home//.mozilla/firefox/.default/Cache\n\n*/home//.mozilla/firefox/.default/OfflineCache\n\n*/home/*/.local/share/Trash\n\n*/dev/*\n\n*/proc/*\n\n*/tmp/*\n\n*/sys/*\n\n*/media/*\n\n*/mnt/*\n\n*/var/cache/*\n\n*.cache*\n\n*/lost+found/*\n\n*/var/tmp/*\n\n*/cdrom/*\n\n*[Cc]ache*\n\n*.thumbnails*\n\n*[Tt]rash*\n\n*.backup\n\n**~\n\n*/root/Ubuntu One\n\n*.dropbox*\n\n\n(It seems this list is faulty and incomplete, but I am just starting to learn Ubuntu. Next time I will delete the \"/*\" at the end of the ignored directories. More improvement suggestions of this list are welcome).\n\nA: The error you experienced is because you restored your /etc/fstab file from your backup. Every partition has a unique identifier (uuid) which is used to mount the required root partition at boot time, even when the disk order has changed for some reason.\nFor a backup of settings in etc, you should be very selective and only backup things you changed manually. For normal backups I would recommend /home/* and run dpkg --get-selections > my-installed-apps and restore home and run dpkg --set-selections < my-installed-apps to restore everything.\n", "Q: How do I help uploading (printer) drivers to the Ubuntu repositories? I have a new printer (a Brother MFC-9970CDW, so a pretty new one at the hour of me writing) and I tried to connect to it through the \"Printing\" utility. But at the step where I am supposed to select the driver, my own printer is not listed in there. This is not a problem for me, since I can manually download the driver from the manufacturer site. Moreover it is a GPLv2 software.\nNonetheless, is there a way for me to help the community by uploading any proprietary driver to Ubuntu? I have read this Ask Ubuntu question \"How to get my software into Ubuntu?\" but it doesn't answer my concern, since the driver I am talking about is actually not a product of my own work.\n\nA: In this case, that question does apply.\nThe Brother printer drivers are, as far as I can see, under GPLv2 which means they're redistributable without permission from Brother under the terms of that license.\nThe hard part is collating them into something that is useful. You could generate a billion packages (one for each printer) or group them together to form single packages. This is largely a different topic (there are questions on packaging) but you'll want to talk to the people who maintain the drivers for printers in Ubuntu to see how things are currently done.\nBut license wise, you should be fine.\n", "Q: Window List on my Gnome Panel doesn't respect all of my icon theme I'm running Window List on my gnome-panel and a there are some apps that do respect my icon theme and some that don't.\nGnome-terminal does, Firefox does not.\nNautilus does, gVim does not.\nUbuntu 10.0, 32bit, elementary theme, Faenza icons installed from ppa\n\nA: Windows list is by no means perfect answer because of different GTK versions and Icon settings across the board.

For what I have heard HUD will make some of this changes but what does it actually offer for newcomers and old users of Ubuntu.\n\nA: Even though, HUD is still under development, one of the biggest +'s, in my opinion, is searching the capabilities within the program, rather than searching through menus and submenus. Again, this update might seem like an inconvenient feature, although that's biassed opinion without giving time to get used to.\n\nA: I do not wish to offer an opinion as this site is the place for answers to questions and not for expressing opinions.\nI have installed HUD. And I have been trying to work out what it does and how to test it. I have found this link:\nUbuntu wiki link on HUD\nBased on my experience of the last few hours this is my answer.\nHow will it affect new users? Not much. They will not even know it is there. There will need to be a lot of documentation to explain what this innovation can do for the user.\nHow will it affect old (experienced) users of Ubuntu? Not much unless they change the way they work. In using Unity I have been trained to use the mouse to access the Launcher, the Dash and the global menu. To benefit from HUD I now need to train myself to use the keyboard more than at present.\nI understand that HUD will get used to the way we work. When we use HUD to find an application or a file HUD will present us with options based on our previous work pattern. This will benefit all those who make use of HUD.\nThe effects of this feature will only become apparent as HUD is developed. It needs applications that cooperate with it. It is a very clever at what it does but at the moment I am wondering what is the point of it. At present it does not do anything that I am not already in the habit of doing another way.\nThe publicity about HUD is great but I need instruction in how to get the best out of it.  Otherwise I may just continue in the same way of working. Perhaps more features will be available as HUD is updated over the coming weeks.\nRegards.\n", "Q: Looking for IPTABLES and UFW readily available, the best proven rules ok i am up with UBUNTU finally, and liked the distro!\nparticularly ufw, synaptic and software manager.\nas i am pretty blind newbie to linux, i need some help securing Ubuntu desktop.

Thanks @all for that.\nHere's what i did,\n\n\n*\n\n*During boot hold SHIFT to see GRUB menu\n\n*Press e to edit\nYou will see something like this.\n\n    recordfail\n        load_video\n        gfxmode $linux_gfx_mode\n        insmod gzio\n        insmod part_msdos\n        ......\n\n\n\n*\n\n*I replaced $linux_gfx_mode with 800x600\n\n*press CTRL+x to boot\nNote: The resolution 800x600 means nothing here. I had tried 1024x768 instead, but it gave same result. No change in resolution of terminal/display. But I no longer found garbled text on my monitor.\nThis is a temporary solution. If this worked for you, you can make permanent changes like i did. By looking into /etc/grub.d/10_linux, i found that $linux_gfx_mode in /boot/grub/grub.cfg was being set by a variable GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX. So,\n\n\n*\n\n*edit /etc/default/grub\n\n*Add this line at the end GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=800x600 \n\n*sudo update-grub\n\n*sudo reboot\nNote: From the /boot/grub/grub.cfg it seems the variable $linux_gfx_mode is supposed to have values like keep or text, so 800x600 is not something thats expected. So, it might be that the system falls back to some default value, which solved my problem ;-)\n", "Q: Fresh install of 12.04 on release My current version of 11.10 is plagued with shutdown/reboot bugs that are basically unfixable because of something I did months ago. Coupled with totem errors, malfunctioning recent files... etc.\nWhen 12.04 comes out at the end of April, I have decided to stick with Ubuntu instead of switching to Mac. My filesystem has the following on different partitions:\n/\n(swap)\n/home\n/home/Videos\n/home/Television\n\nWhen I burn and run the install disc of 12.04, do I just pick the previous partions out in the advanced mode and then choose to reformat root / to perform a clean install? I don't care about the application packages I lose, I can easily download them again.\n\nA: Your plan should work just fine. With that said, I would still advise backups ;)\n", "Q: Can a Sempron processor play HD video? I want to assemble a low-cost media player computer.\nI wonder if a Sempron processor will be able to play High definition 1080p videos, of course on Ubuntu, xbmc or ubuntu TV, when available.\nWill this be enough?\nThe other choice is a bluray player and a usb hard drive.\n\nA: The Sempron is AMD's competing product to Intel's Celeron, AFAIK. In theory, you'd want a CPU with at least 2 or 3 cores, and video RAM of at least 256 MB (meaning if you're lucky enough to have an onboard graphics card with very stable 3D acceleration, it might suffice). Personally I'd recommend getting an Athlon, it's probably much better than a Sempron, and it's also obsolete so prices have been dropping phenomenally (the Phenom is still somewhat expensive, but I gather you want the cheapest price). I just bought a desktop kit that came with a Athlon 3 core CPU, it cost me $235 for the computer (after taxes, shipping and mail-in rebate deduction), granted that didn't include the monitor, mouse & keyboard, and I also got a dedicated graphics card, but I was able to get those at competitive prices. A Sempron CPU might do the trick, seems like the graphics card is more important than the CPU for getting 1080p, but considering the price difference I'd have to recommend the Athlon as much better value.\nRead more here: http://geeknizer.com/1080p-minimum-requirements/ (article is a few years old, but still relevant to your question).\n", "Q: Bluetooth connection works but Preferences shows not connected My Nokia N810 is Bluetooth paired with Ubuntu desktop and successfully transfers files. \nThe Ubuntu Bluetooth indicator shows the N810.

I've got it going manually but I wanted to know;\nIs the option to make diskless systems coming back to mythbuntu-control-center?\nWhere can I download the development release of mythbuntu-control-center to help make this happen?\n\nA: The diskless option in mythbuntu-control-centre (MCC) didn't make the transition when MCC was rewritten to allow plugins. (Previously all functionality was written in the MCC code) The main developer behind the diskless functionality left the team to go to University, and none of the other developers use that functionality so it has not been ported to the new MCC yet.

Setup in Ubuntu 11.10 installation gives me this message while in advanced partitioning:\n\"The file system type fat32 cannot be mounted on /home, because it is not a fully-functional Unix file system. Please choose a different file system, such as ext2.\"\nIs there a way to force the use of the fat32 partition so I can share it with Windows, but also using it as home?\n\nA: No. The problem is that vfat does not support permissions so you can not use it as home.\nYou are almost certainly better off using a shared ntfs data partition.\nAlternately you can install the fs-driver in windows\nhttp://www.fs-driver.org/\nIt will read ext2/3/4 and you are going to be better off using ext4 for /home.\n\nA: Obviously no because system can't manage user permissions on FAT32 but...

O_o\no_O O_O O_o X_X -_- X_X -_- o_o\n\nA: A slight improvement over the \"shared ntfs data partition\" recipe suggested by @bodhi.zazen is to set up /home on an ext partition, mount an NTFS partition at, say, /mount/disk and then replace directories the user's home folder with symlinks to directories on the NTFS partition.\n\n\n*\n\n*/home/username/Documents -> /mnt/disk/my_linux_data/Documents\n\n*/home/username/Music     -> /mnt/disk/my_linux_data/Music\n\n\netc. Then, if you make a point not to save files in your home folder directly, the process will be totally transparent.\n", "Q: How does \"Accounts Service\" work with lightdm? I have added two users using the command useradd but they do no show up in the lightdm/unity-greeter login screen. So there is no way to graphically login for them.  It seems Accounts Service (whatever that is) is not reading them in. How can I reload that or cause them to appear in the login window?  I am a Fedora user so I have no clue about Ubuntu and how it does these things. Thanks.\n\nA: For Ubuntu the recommended command to add a new user to the system is\nsudo adduser <newuser> --ingroup <group>\n\nThis will take care to add this new user to the system with settings defined in /etc/adduser.conf.\nThe low-level command useradd is available but not all default settings are made\n\nuseradd is a low level utility for adding users. On Debian, administrators should usually use adduser(8) instead.from manpage useradd\n\n\nA: According to the package information:\n\nThe accountsservice project provides a set of D-Bus interfaces for querying and manipulating user account information and an implementation of these interfaces, based on the useradd, usermod and userdel commands.\n\nSo, based on this information it seems that the only way to configure it is to configure those base services (usermod, useradd and userdel) which can be accomplished by editing the /etc/login.defs file. Specifically if you're looking for a way to show a user whose ID is lower than 1000 you have to change the value of MIN_UID.\nIt seems that the /etc/login.defs file is used in two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*To control defaults when accounts are created.\n\n*To control how the accountsservice accounts-daemon responds to D-Bus queries. \n\n\nShort answer\nSince ubuntu sets a user's group (GID) to be the same value as the user's ID (UID) I found that I had to alter both MIN_UID and MIN_GID in /etc/login.defs to get accountsservice to reveal my login to lightdm.\n", "Q: Problem with 10.04 start at my notebook after updating At my notebook I use UBUNTU 10.04\nafter regular updating I have got version\n  ...37\nand yesterday I update the system to the version ...38\nEvery day I switch off my notebook\nand for the last 2 version I have got the following problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*when I switch on the notebook I must type the password    and very\noften my keyboard is not active now ! i.e. I cannot type password\n\n*click RESTART does not help - the same situation\n\n*when I shout down it - it helps but yesterday I had to do it 5 times\nbefore I could type password\n\n\nhow can I solve this problem?\n\nA: So I guess you mean Linux kernel, something like\nLinux YOURHOST 2.6.32-37-generic #81-Ubuntu SMP Fri Dec 2 20:35:14 UTC 2011 i686 GNU/Linux \nwith version 37. \nDid you remove the old kernels?

I am not able to change the screen brightness on lenovo z570.\nEven the function keys for the brightness are also not working. Any idea ?\n\nA: Try switching off Num Lock.\nWith my z570 xubuntu the brightness keys are without function if Num Lock is active.\nWhen i switch it off every thing works fine.\n\nA: Finally got the brightness controls to work properly!\nThe issue persists due to presence of two backlight modules acpi_video0 and intel_backlight. You can cross check if both modules exists by running the below command.\nls /sys/class/backlight/\n\nIf you find acpi_video0 as one of the modules run the command:\nsudo tee /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness <<< 5\n\nIf no change is observed, it is time to remove this module. My assumption is that by default intel_backlight is ignored and acpi_video0 is being used by the kernel for handling backlight.\n\nSometimes, ACPI does not work well due to different motherboard implementations and ACPI quirks. This includes some laptops with dual graphics (e.g. Nvidia/Radeon dedicated GPU with Intel/AMD integrated GPU).\nOn Nvidia Optimus laptops, the kernel parameter nomodeset can interfere with the ability to adjust the backlight. Additionally, ACPI sometimes needs to register its own acpi_video0 backlight even if one already exists (such as intel_backlight), which can be done by adding one of the following kernel parameters in your bootloader:\nacpi_backlight=video\nacpi_backlight=vendor\nacpi_backlight=native\n\n\nSource\nSince acpi_video0 backlight did not change the brightness, you may need to use acpi_backlight=none as an argument as well. This line disables the acpi_video0 module from kernel parameters so that only intel_backlight handles the brightness controls.\nYou need to modify the bootloader file /etc/default/grub to add the above mentioned arguments. It should look something like this.\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_backlight=native\"                     \n\nIn case native does not work try with video, vendor, or none.\nUpdate the grub configuration:\nsudo update-grub\n\nReboot your system, the brightness controls should now work.\nMore details on my blog.\n\nA: If all else fails, you might want to try out the command-line utility xbacklight.\nYou can install it by running\nsudo apt-get install xbacklight\n\nThen if you want to make the screen brighter you can type\nxbacklight +50\n\n(or replace 50 with whatever percentage you'd like)\nOr if you wanted to dim the screen you can type\nxbacklight -50\n\netc.\nAlso if you really had the time, you might want to mess with key-bindings to make running those commands more convenient.\n\nA: Try the following and see if after a reboot your brightness keys are functional again.\nEdit etc/X11/xorg.conf and add the another line to the Device section: Option \"RegistryDwords\" \"EnableBrightnessControl=1\"\n\nA: I also have a Lenovo z570 and this worked for me with 16.04 and now with 18.04.\nThe problem in my case is because the system has added the acpi_video0 module incorrectly, and the brightness keys use this module instead of correct one for my hardware (intel_backlight).\nSee my full answer here.  \nTo cut a long story short, for the z570, the answer is to add the boot option  acpi_backlight=none which will remove the directory acpi_video0 from /sys/class/backlight/. This makes the system use /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight as required.\n", "Q: What do I need for \"Passwords & Encryption keys application\"?

I have a 10.04 image from vmplanet which I am very accustomed to, for my development work which revolves mainly around java, git and rails (using rvm). I didn't like the Unity interface so I did not seriously consider an upgrade to the 11.x versions, but now that a fair amount of time has passed and another LTS might be round the corner, I am trying to find out if there are other benefits in upgrading, or pitfalls I should avoid.\nEdit: I am also interested in factors relating to interoperability with Windows (either as an image or native install), i.e. file/folder sharing, networking\n\nA: Well, some basic things you may want to be aware of are that Oracle (Sun) Java is no longer in the repositories. You can still install it, via the official Java page, but it isn't nearly as easy to install and update as it used to be. Git, Rails, and RVM work fine in 11.10, and should in 12.04 as well.\nYou may run into various issues with program compatibility if you use a lot of lesser known packages, but most tend to work perfectly well in the newer versions of Ubuntu. The biggest pitfall is if you are using a 64-bit installation, programs requiring the old ia32-libs method of 32bit compatibility will not work, since ia32-libs is no longer supported.\nThe good news is that all the main programs will work just fine with no new issues, but there may be some minor issues with some fringe applications working, at least in the beginning.\nAlso, I recommend staying away from Unity if possible. Its not that great, and while it should stabilize considerably in 12.04, it still isn't terribly flexible. I recommend using Gnome-shell and getting accustomed with the way it works. I keep Unity installed in case I ever want to use it, but I have Gnome set as my default.\nOverall, you can't go wrong upgrading to the new LTS release when it hits stable, just be aware of what has changed and that all the programs you use have support for it.\nI'm not entirely sure what you mean by Windows interoperability, but nothing significant has changed in that regard with 12.04 that I am aware of.\n", "Q: How to make possible to install Samsung Kies? I am not sure where this question is set to proper place or not. If not then please guide me to that place.\nI have a Samsung Galaxy SII, and doing Android development.\nA couple of days before I was using Windows OS, but now I am using Ubuntu.\nIn Windows I am able to debug my Android app into Galaxy SII with the help of Samsung Kies, but I am not able to do this in Ubuntu.\nSo what is the alternate of it for Ubuntu. I have googled many times but still not get Kies that support for Ubuntu.\n\nA: Well, if I'm reading this right, you simply want to debug your app on your Android device. If that is correct, then all you would really need is the Android SDK and set up ADB or \"Android Debug Bridge\". Its not terribly difficult, but may take some work to get usb working correctly. You will also need to go to Settings>Applications>Debugging>Enable USB Debugging. If using Eclipse to do the application development, there are several tools that will automate sending the test version of the app to your phone.\nFor a more in depth answer, look at the Android Developer Site here: http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/device.html\nAlso, it appears that there is no solution for kies on linux. I don't know anything about kies, but the standard Android app development method should work just fine and there's plenty of documentation at the developer site.\n\nA: I have a Galaxy (great phone by the way) but sadly have to confirm that you won't get Samsung Kies working in Wine. If you succeed in getting Kies installed, you are unlikely to establish proper contact with the phone. This is I believe due to limited usb support in wine. (this is the reason tomtom home won't run in wine - it will install perfectly, but it can't talk to the device)\nMy attempts to get it working in a Win XP virtual machine running in virtualbox also failed - invariably the virtual XP installation froze and had to be forcefully shut down.\nDrag and drop in native (k)ubuntu works fine (but I suppose you already know that) but in my experience Kies needs a full-blown windows.\nIf you do succeed in getting it running in 'buntu I and no doubt many others will be very keen to hear.\n\nA: You do not need Kies or a driver to use ADB and the sdk on Linux. \nFirst go to the android developer web site and install the SDK and Eclipse. I expect as you are developing on Windows already you'll work this bit out following their instructions.\nIn Linux a usb driver can be in user space, that is built right into the program. The coder uses the libusb API for this. But there is a little more, it will not work out of the box.\nWhen a USB device is inserted into you PC the service udev is used to arbitrate how and where the 'device' is mounted. As your phone, when in debug mode, is unknown to the system it will only create the usb file node, which libusb uses to talk to it. Everything is a file in Linux. The problem is that this node is only accessible by the root account. You need to tell udev to allow a program, ADB in this case, talk to it with a normal user account.\nTo do this you create a file in /etc/udev/rules.d/\nI have one called 99-my.rules\nIn this file, for your S2, add the single line\nSUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ATTR{idVendor}==\"04e8\",ATTR{idProduct}=\"685e\", OWNER=\"YOUR USERNAME\", GROUP=\"YOUR USERNAME\"\nWhere YOUR USERNAME is, put your username.\nYou'll have to be the root account to do this, in ubuntu use sudo in front of the command your are calling. EG sudo gedit /etc/udev/rules.d/99-my.rules\nNow reboot or run sudo service udev restart\nPlug phone in and test with adb devices. Should show the phone ID.\nUbuntu is perfect for Android development, I use it at work all the time. Whilst the windows guys are trying to find drivers for a new device being tested I just do lsusb get the idVendor and idProduct values, add a new line in udev and restart the service and i'm up and running. :)\n\nA: You can run Kies on Ubuntu, I had it on my netbook for about two months before I changed to Mint. It works perfectly on Ubuntu, sadly though it does not on Mint, Lubuntu or Xubuntu.   \nYou will need Wine to downdload it. It will thow up an error message near the end but it will still work fine.\n", "Q: Does the Update Manager have a log? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhere can I look up my update history? \n\nIf Update Manager has a log of updates installed, where can I find it?

I installed Ubuntu to try it in my computer and I'm in love with it, but it doesn´t recognize my Intel 82915G/GV/910GL Express Chipset Family Integrated, I need help to do this, because I'm new to this OS.\nI tried to find drivers using Additional Drivers, and \nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-intel\n\nThis tells me I already have the lastest version.\nCan somebody help me to install this driver?\n\nA: The Intel driver is already installed by default in Ubuntu; I have the same chipset and, at the moment, I can't run Unity 3D with it. I just can run flawlessly Unity 2D, choosing it at the login screen.\nIf you want hardware acceleration, you could possibily try to add Xord Edgers PPA, but it's risky cause you could mess up your computer and I don't advice it, also because I don't know if with the updated driver you can succeed in using hardware acceleration and runnning Unity 3D.\n", "Q: How to hide terminal output when executing a command? When I launch certain programs from the command line like eclipse and document viewer in 11.10 it spews a load of information that seems inconsequential. \nAlso when they are run in the background they sometimes continue to produce output to the terminal which I am currently working on, which is irritating.\nI would like them just launch and keep the background stuff in the background. My reasoning is that if you launch these programs through the GUI (eg double clicking on an icon) these messages are never shown to me, so I don't need them in the command line.\n\nA: try adding --help as a command switch and look for \"quiet\" this should suppress the output , or just launch from GUI. and launch with the switch or find a way to suppress it via script\npersonally i launch from cli to get that output so im not sure its possible for all GUI apps.\n\nA: You can create a bash function that will alias a command name and add some extra functionality to achieve what you are asking for.\nFor example: let's say you want to launch gvim (a gui text editor) from the command line.\nyou could write a function like this:\nfunction gvim () {\n    nohup gvim \"$@\" > /dev/null 2>&1 & disown\n}\n\n(add this function to your .bashrc or .bash_aliases file so it is always loaded)\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*this will alias the gvim command with a bash function also named gvim (so when you type gvim at a bash prompt, it will call your gvim function, rather than executing the real gvim command.  Your function then calls the real gvim command (and accepts its regular args), with some added features:\n\n\n*\n\n*redirects stdout and stderr to /dev/null (suppresses output to the terminal)\n\n*uses & to run the command in the background (so your shell isn't blocked)\n\n*uses disown to remove the background job from the shell (so it won't appear in the list of active jobs)\n\n*uses nohup to detach the process from the terminal (so you can end your shell session or close your terminal without killing the process)\n\n\n\nA: If you can avoid writing stuff in the console, it depends on how output from the program is created. If it is streamed to standard output, then it is just enough to do\n$ eclipse >/dev/null\n\nand no output should be made.\nTo suppress error messages as well:\n$ eclipse >/dev/null 2>&1\n\nOr in bash, simply:\n$ eclipse &>/dev/null\n\nBut if they do it somehow differently then it might be a problem to stop it from writing in the console.\nif possible use the solution given by MuffinStateWide\n", "Q: Advanced disk usage analyzing software?

(It's almost identical to WinDirStat, if you're familiar with that Windows program. I believe Windirstat is based on kdirstat.) \nThe feature that I find most useful - and which is missing from a lot of disk usage software - is that you can delete files from within the program, saving the hassle of switching back and forth between nautilus or a terminal and the disk usage program to clean up files.\nIf you're using Ubuntu 11.10 you can't install k4dirstat from the Software Centre, but you can install a backport - see this thread: Can I install kdirstat...\n\nA: Two easy options, both available in the Software Center:  \nGDMAP \n\nFilelight \n\nIf neither of these meet your needs,edit your question with the specific features you want.

Now it's stopped working, this suddenly happened today but I haven't had an update since a couple of days ago so no idea what triggered it.\nSymptoms are the touchpad works fine at the login screen, but as soon as I login and the desktop appears it stops working. A USB mouse works OK\nI've tracked it down (I think) to gnome-settings-daemon. I have turned off \"disable-while-typing\" using\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.peripherals.touchpad disable-while-typing false\n\nIf I run\nxinput watch-props \"SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\"\n\nin one terminal, and then run\nxinput set-prop \"SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\" \"Device Enabled\" 1\n\nin another terminal, the touchpad is enabled for a few seconds, and then something else disables it again, here's the messages from xinput watch-props:\n\nProperty 'Device Enabled' changed.\n    Device Enabled (143):   1\nProperty 'Synaptics Tap Action' changed.\n    Synaptics Tap Action (303): 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0\nProperty 'Synaptics Edge Scrolling' changed.\n    Synaptics Edge Scrolling (294): 0, 0, 0\nProperty 'Synaptics Two-Finger Scrolling' changed.\n    Synaptics Two-Finger Scrolling (295):   0, 0\nProperty 'Synaptics Edge Scrolling' changed.\n    Synaptics Edge Scrolling (294): 0, 0, 0\nProperty 'Synaptics Two-Finger Scrolling' changed.\n    Synaptics Two-Finger Scrolling (295):   0, 0\nProperty 'Device Enabled' changed.\n    Device Enabled (143):   0\n\nso something (I believe gnome-daemon-settings) keeps disabling it.\nIf I'm quick I can move the mouse for a couple of seconds after enabling it so I'm sure this is the problem.\nAlso, if I switch to a virtual terminal (Ctrl+Alt+F1) and back to X again the touchpad is enabled for a couple of seconds before it gets disabled again.\nI can't see any settings in gconf-editor that would cause this, also I have no idea why it suddenly started happening.\nThis behaviour happens consistently between reboots now. It's the same whether I run Unity or Gnome shell so not specific to any window manager.\nAm I doing something stupid, or should I file a bug report?\n\nA: Try this:\nxinput set-prop \"SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\" \"Synaptics Off\" 0\n\n\nA: I have experienced the same behavior as the original poster of this question (on a different laptop) under gnome-session 3.2.1.

I'm trying to get a functional Ubuntu instance running in VirtualBox on my iMac 27\".  The iMac has a resolution of 2560x1440, and I'd like to run Ubuntu in full screen at that resolution.\nI've installed the Guest Additions that come with VirtualBox (rather than the ones in the archive).  I'm using Ubuntu 11.10 64 bit.  \nThe display currently runs at 1600x1200, and when I run the displays dialog (or xrandr), I get a list of resolutions that are 1600x1200 or smaller, and are all at 4:3 aspect ratio (whereas the iMac monitor is 16:9).\nThe settings for the virtual machine have video memory set to 128MB.  Whether I run the VM with or without 3D acceleration makes no difference to the available resolutions (although with 3D acceleration enabled, launched windows aren't visible – a different question perhaps).\nI have a natty VirtualBox VM that does run at 2560x1440, so I know it's possible.  However, I don't know how to achieve it.\nThanks,\njml\n\nA: Well this is embarrassing.\nIt turns out that all I needed to do was run in full screen mode and then Ubuntu will figure out the new resolution automatically.  I could have sworn I tried that.  Oh well.\nDon't know how to \"cancel\" this question, I'm afraid.\n\nA: This question has already been answered, however, I'd like to share the following post worked for me, namely commands I used were:\nxrandr --newmode \"2560x1440_60.00\" 311.83  2560 2744 3024 3488  1440 1441 1444 1490  -HSync +Vsync\nxrandr --addmode Virtual1 2560x1440_60.00\n\n\nA: I found increasing the Video Memory to 128MB in the Virtual Machine display settings worked for me.\n\nA: I've never used VB on Mac, but on Windows it might be impossible sometimes to get a high resolution. In general:\n\n\n*\n\n*3D accelleration (as far as I was interested in it last time) was highly experimental and may not work correctly.\n\n*If acceleration doesn'yt work, operating system (or rather GNOME) might not show options for making the resolution too high (or rather too expensive in the meaning of performance)\nThese are the limiting factors. However You may (carefully) try to change settings: create xorg.conf.new file and there in the proper section set the resolution.\nThe second thing might be that Your hardware (monitor) is not recognized by Ubuntu. So looking up xorg.conf.new would give us the hint.\n\nA: this may not be possible as i have found instances of 64 bit OS' under vbox to still be lacking comapred to 32 bit (i'm running 4.1.8) so it may be a current limitation of the 64 bit at this time , but maybe you can manually set the resolution in xrandr \nyou may want to refer to xrandr --help from a terminal \n", "Q: How do I preserve LVM while changing the physical disk?

I've replaced the HDD with a 120GB SSD, and to save some precious disk space I utilized one of Steve Hanov's tips for optimizing Ubuntu to run on a USB key or SD card; specifically, I implemented his third tip, and compressed /usr to a squashfs read-only volume mounted with a normal rw volume using unionfs.\nNow, I've installed another space-heavy program, and I'd like to repeat the procedure. However, I don't know how to... I can't inflate the squashfs volume to get to square one and do the same thing again, simply because there's not enough space on my drive left for that.\nHow do I go from where I am now to (approximately) where I would be if I had applied the space-saving tip the first time today?\n\nA: I believe one needs to simply make a new SquashFS volume with the new files.\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/8907/modifying-a-squashfs\n", "Q: How to update Zend Server Community?

If I do \n\napt-get update\n\nit doesn't help.\n\nA: apt-get update updates your whole system (if that software is part of any repository that is).

I often have many terminal windows open and switch between them with alt-tab.  Right now, they are all shown as the black \"utilities-terminal\" icon.  I would like to customize the icons so I can easily switch between them - how?\nI've tried creating custom .desktop entries and changing the Icon there.  But, that only changes the icon to launch the terminal.  Once running, it is shown as normal icon again.\n\nA: Firstly, what version of Ubuntu are you using? On 11.10 (and probably 11.04 and 12.04) the alt-tab switcher groups windows by default.\nAnyway, if you're looking to give terminal instances individual icons, I doubt that's possible apart from hacking Unity. If you're just looking to change the terminal, I believe you can locate your icon folder (sometimes at /usr/share/icons, other times at ~/.icons) and drop in a custom \"terminal\" image of the appropriate name and it should take effect the next time you log in.\nDoes this address your issue?\n", "Q: I add a PPA but the software does not show up in Ubuntu 11.10 updates nor Software Centre Every time I add a PPA I cannot see the package I'm trying to install. I suppose I must be doing something wrong! So here's my latest effort:\nIn a Terminal I typed:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:jeromerobert/misc\n\nand that seemed to work correctly\nThen I typed:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nBut when I go to Synaptic or Software Center the application I want to install is not there. Could someone please tell me what I'm doing wrong?\n\nA: From my experience there are 3 reasons why it would not immediately show up in the repositories of Synaptic or Software Center:\n\n\n*\n\n*You added the PPA, did the repo update and immediately went to Synaptic or Software Center to see it. For some reason, it takes a little more time for the package managers to reflect on the new changes. In Synaptic for example I can see the \"Refreshing Cache\" option in the search box when I add a PPA and go straight to it. I have to actually wait for the refresh to finish to see the package. If I go look for it it will not show up. Same goes with Software Center, doing an apt-get update does not make the package manager show in that instant the new package you want.\n\n*The PPA shows the package but you still can not see it in your package manager. This happens when the package has just been added to the PPA. For example, in my case when I updated the Wine PPA, the 1.4 was there for a whole day but I could not update to it until the next morning. For what I know, launchpad needs some time to get a package ready for download after it has been summited.\n\n*Cache problems. This can be quickly solved by just rebooting the PC. It happens when you are like me and don't need to reboot the PC because.. well because is Ubuntu, I can go on for days ^^. But in general is good to reboot after doing update after update of stuff.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: When your adding a PPA you not only have to type the repository followed by update you need to add the package you apt name.\nEXAMPLE PPA;\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:simonschneegans/testing\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gnome-pie\n\nAs you can see the last line is the name of the package I want \"gnome-pie\".\nIf you can find the name of the package then you can install it.  \n\nA: I had a similar problem and for some reason the corresponding PPA source file under: \n/etc/apt/sources.list.d/ \n\nhad the apt lines commented out with #.\nI removed the # marks and it started to work after I've performed an update:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThis is a bug somewhere, because I followed the instructions precisely.\n", "Q: Error: kernel headers not found.

That fixed it for me.\n\nA: To get a VirtualBox ubuntu server guest to correctly accept a guest-additions install you will need to have a minimal xorg package install:\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg xserver-xorg-core\n\nBy doing this, you will have the shared-folder support.\nAs you have found, the guest additions is one very large script - \"VBoxLinuxAdditions.run\"\nYou may be able to unpick this file - I wouldnt recommend it, because as newer versions of virtualbox is released, the version of guest-additions is usually bumped as well.\nIn addition, I would recommend (if you haven't already), install dkms.  When newer ubuntu kernels are updated, the guest-additions kernel modules will be automatically compiled.  Without dkms you will lose your shared-folder support when a kernel update is made.\nsource\n\nA: The message is misleading.\nIn my case it was actually missing dkms so before you install the addition run\nsudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-`uname -r` dkms\n\n\nA: (Even though this question has an accepted answer, I'm adding this answer in case it helps somebody else out...)\nAlthough I had identical symptoms, I tried out every suggestion to this question, and yet nothing worked. I finally found this thread suggesting it's the VirtualBox version not being up to date with the Linux kernel version.\nSo, if nothing works for you, try installing the latest version from: http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/ (at time of writing, this was 4.2.6 for Debian-based systems).\n\nA: I fixed this error by installing dkms and upgrading my version of VirtualBox. Turns out old versions of the VirtualBox guest additions often won't work with the latest kernels.\n\nA: The answer about you needing X to use guest additions is just ridiculus. The reason it works after installing X is that it pulls libglib as a dependency, but it would be really unnesessary to install the entire X server just to get the additions running.\nAll the packages you need are the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*build-essential\n\n*linux-headers-`uname-r`\n\n*libglib2.0-0\n\n\nObviously it's only part of build-essential and libglib that you need, but rather than investigating exactly which packages are necessary it's easier to just let them pull their dependencies. \nA sidenote is that these are exactly the same packages that you need for the vmware equivalent \"VMware Tools\" on a vmware machine.\n\nA: I have tried ALL the above solution and I am pretty sure that I have installed the proper headers but still no luck !!!\nroot@test:~# dpkg --get-selections | grep linux-headers\nlinux-headers-4.0.0-kali1-amd64         install\nlinux-headers-4.0.0-kali1-common        install\nlinux-headers-amd64             install\n\nAnd I have also installed latest version of Virtual Box as of today 5.0.4 but still I have the error when trying to install Guest Additions with error\nThe headers for the current running kernel were not found.\n\nSolution :\nIn the end what solved my problem is running the VBoxLinuxAdditions.run from /root directory instead of other directory like /home/ !!!\nI was originally running VBoxLinuxAdditions.run from /home/ directory and keeps having this dam error but after using command below from root directory, it's fine, problem solved!\ncp /media/cd-rom/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run /root/\nchmod 755 /root/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run\ncd /root\n./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run\n\nAfter this you can simply use reboot, then you should have Guest Additional done properly and FULL Screen too ! YAY !!!\n\nA: Usually i install the guest-additions directly via virtualbox (mount cdrom, sh ./VBoxLinuxGuestAddtions.run). However, most linux-distributions offer you a package which can be install via your package-manager. For me following command solved the issue:\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-dkms\n\n\nA: I think this error is cause by using an old version of Virtual Box or at least a old version of the Guest Additions ISO image.\nI achieved success by downloading a new ISO of the VBox Guest Additions and running the VBoxLinuxAdditions.run script\nI went here Virtual Box download site and grabbed a new ISO.\nFor reasons (too dull to go into) I could not update my version of VirtualBox on the (Windows) host, but I could copy the new ISO file to a local place on the file-system.\nThen, In the \"Devices\" menu on the VM window I chose a new virtual CD/DVD and picked the place where I downloaded the new ISO image.\nThen inside the Debian VM I went to \\media\\cdrom and ran the new VBoxLinuxAdditions.run script as root. (I had already installed dkms, current kernel headers etc.) Then the script stopped falsely complaining about the missing headers (they were not missing) and built the kernel objects it needed.\nThe whole reason for doing this was so that X.org would give me additional display resolutions and I could run the VM at a higher res than the conservatively set defaults.\n\nA: I was getting the same errors as OP when trying to compile the VirtualBox Guest Additions v4.1.12 in various flavours of K/Ubuntu 13.04 guests.\nBuilding the shared folder support module ...fail!\n\nThis is due to bugs (or unmet expectations) of the VirtualBox Guest Additions against various parts of the linux source (in the GUEST).

I installed OpenSSH server on desktop and now I'm able to connect to this from my laptop (also running Ubuntu) by typing \n\nssh -X \n\nthis allows me to run programs on the desktop and display their windows on the laptop.\nI'm wandering if it is also possible to run GDM on the desktop and display and control it by the laptop, so that if there is e.g. an update notice I see it, etc.? I'm not talking about the normal remote desktop which sends screenshots, because it's too slow.\n\nA: As an alternate, if your primary concern is with performance, take a look at FreeNX.\nFreenx is both fast and secure.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeNX\nhttp://alandoyle.com/tutorials/setup-freenx-under-ubuntu/\nhttps://launchpad.net/~freenx-team/+archive/ppa\nTo forward an entire session, you can also use Xephyr.

Sending it over SSH will theoretically be slower, since you add the SSH encryption. \nThere are plenty of applications available to show your desktop, but I would not advise to run it over X-forwarding. 3rd party applications will have settings to speed up your desktop (like f.e. disable the colors). \nIf you still want to test: I believe that you can start your desktop by typing\n gnome-session\n\n", "Q: What version of Unity will be used in 12.04 As the question goes, at the end, what version of Unity will be used in 12.04 for the final release. Will it keep on with the 4.x or will it use 5.x\n\nA: In Precise Pangoline, they have already upgraded the Unity package at the 5.6 for Unity (as stated here in Launchpad) and Unity-2D (as stated here in Launchpad)..besides, in the 5.4 version of Unity, they released the new feature, HUD, as explained by Mark Shuttleworth (you can read it here).\n\nA: Surely Unity 5.0 will be used by 12.04 \n", "Q: Run a script on login using ~/.bash_login I need to run a script when I login and logout in my Ubuntu.\nI tried to put the script in my ~/.bash_login but it didn't work.\nIs there a better location where I can run my script?\nMy script is located in /home/gsd/script/login.sh and it's executable.\nedit:\nmy script runs when i type: /home/gsd/script/login.sh and it set with +x\nnow, i only have: touch /home/gsd/test.txt in the ~/.bash_login to test.\nthe file test.txt is never created\nedit 2:\ngsd@laptop:~$ ll ~/.bash*\n-rw------- 1 gsd gsd 38639 2012-01-25 17:25 .bash_history\n-rw-r--r-- 1 gsd gsd    29 2012-01-25 15:22 .bash_login\n-rw-r--r-- 1 gsd gsd   220 2011-11-03 19:22 .bash_logout\n-rw-r--r-- 1 gsd gsd  3136 2011-11-04 08:00 .bashrc\n\n\nA: Login shells, regardless of if they are interactive or non-interactive read and execute the .profile\nInteractive shells read and execute .bashrc.\nOften you will see that /etc/profile sources .bashrc - thus all settings made in .bashrc will also take effect in a login shell regardless of whether it is interactive or non-interactive.\nThe order of execution of the initialization scripts for a shell is dependent on if the shell is interactive or non-interactive and not related to if it is a login script or not.\nWhen bash is invoked as an interactive login shell it reads and executes commands from the /etc/profile. Then Bash will then try in order to execute ONLY the first file exists and is readable of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*.bash_profile\n\n*.bash_login\n\n*.profile\nIf one of these files is found but can not be read, it will cause an error. \nThere is no error if any are NOT found.\nThis same process is followed when a non-interactive login shell is invoked with the --login option. \n\nA: If .bash_profile exists, then Bash will not read .bash_login (or .profile). This annoying feature is described in some versions of the Bash manual, but not all. \n.bash_profile and .bash_loginare analogous, so I recommend you put your commands in .bash_profile, because it's is commonly used and .bash_login is relatively unknown. Also consider putting your commands in .bashrc instead of .bash_profile. The manual describes difference between \"interactive non-login shell\" and \"interactive login shell\", so be sure to read that section.\nThe GNU Bash Reference Manual version 4.1: Bash Startup Files says:\n\nlooks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile, in that\n  order, and reads and executes commands from the first one that exists\n  and is readable.\n\nAlso see this question on superuser, and this Bash howto (Don't be deterred by the freeunix.dyndns.org:8088 address--- it's still a good quality manual and I have used it for years).\nUpdate, since you say you don't have a .bash_profile.\nIt sounds like you are not using what's called a \"interactive non-login shell\" (See the Bash manual for a detailed description).\nTo test this, add something like the following each file: .bashrc, .bash_profile and .bash_login.\necho \"DEBUG: I am .bashrc\"\n\necho \"DEBUG: I am .bash_profile\"\n\nThen log out and log in again. When you log in, I bet you will only see the phrase \"DEBUG: I am .bashrc\" but not \"I am .bash_profile\". If so, it means you are a \"interactive non-login shell\", which simply means that Bash will call .bashrc but not .bash_profile. For information why these dotfiles are the way they are, see @Andrejs Cainikovs's post below and http://mywiki.wooledge.org/DotFiles\n\nA: Bash only looks for .bash_login or .profile files if it is executed as interactive login shell. When it is executed as interactive non-login shell it reads .bashrc.\nCommonly it is the second case, i.e when you run gnome-terminal bash is run as non-login shell.\nThis clearly states that if you are booting into Gnome, .bash_login will not be executed. But if you lower runlevel to boot directly to bash, the same file will be executed upon succesfull login.\nI assume .bash_login will be executed in case of remote SSH connections as well.\nPartially ripped from here.\n\nA: Make sure the script you want to run is executable. Run chmod +x scriptname to do that. Also make sure the script starts with the correct shebang (#!/bin/bash for shell scripts). Lastly, use all full paths when executing it, e.g., /usr/bin/echo instead of echo just incase the environment that your script will execute in is not identical to the one you are used to.\n", "Q: Does any TV work with Ubuntu TV or only specific ones (Hardware requirements) I have a 1080p TV and was wondering if there is some kind of specific hardware for Ubuntu TV or any technical specifications for it that I should know. Will it work correctly with a 1080p TV with HDMI or does it work with only a group of TVs.\nWhat are the hardware requirements to use Ubuntu TV?\n\nA: You will be able to run Ubuntu TV with any TV by installing it onto a computer and connecting it to your television; however, Canonical is working with TV vendors to have Ubuntu TV software built directly into the unit so an additional PC or set-top-box wouldn't be needed.\n\nA: It's still in its infancy but \"Ubuntu TV comes with a box office built right in that gives you access to movie rentals, YouTube, and other online media outlets\". So you need to buy a new TV with the Ubuntu hardware in it if you are talking about an actual TV with actually Ubuntu on it. I bet they'll also start making settop boxes since then you can use it in any TV (that has the correct connections).\nVideo about Ubuntu TV\nYou can also install a development version of Ubuntu TV on your own PC so you can ofcourse use your netbook, notebook or PC to stream it to your TV (ie. your system sends the signal to your PC).

I use this machine remotely via NoMachine during the day and had some issues with Unity so I switched the desktop to Gnome while at home last evening. It worked fine, but when I'm using NoMachine the applications menu is missing from the top toolbar.\nI would like to switch it back to Unity, but it logs directly into the desktop without being able to set the desktop option.\nI'm guessing the desktop setting is contained in a file and I can edit it via ssh shell and Vim, but have no clue where the file is or what it's called.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Add a custom command to your Nomachine NXClient, which says gnome-session --session=ubuntu-2d. That will launch Unity 2D which uses Metacity instead of Compiz. NX is not capable of using Compiz (Unity) or Mutter (Gnome Shell). Unity 2D with Metacity works nicely though. \n\nA: This link explains what the problem is and how to get NX Client to work with Ubuntu 11.10. The instructions there worked for me.\nhttp://www.nomachine.com/tr/view.php?id=TR10I02623\nExcerpt for your convenience:\nThe system menu may be missing in a NX session running on Ubuntu 11.10 if the desktop environment is Unity 3D\nThe system menu is missing inside the NX session when the Unity 3D desktop environment is launched instead of Unity 2D. \nUnity 2D is the fallback for those X servers not supporting 3D graphics as it is for the X11 agent, nxagent.  However, if the hosting machine has support for a 3D graphic card, Unity 3D is launched  also inside the NX session. \nUbuntu 11.10 comes with a script, the Unity Support Test, to verify if the hosting computer supports or not Unity 3D. If yes, a file is stored in the /tmp directory. \nIn order to override this behavior and run Unity 2D instead of Unity 3D, it is necessary to delete the file created by the Unity Support Test tool inside the /tmp directory. This file has format /tmp/unity_support_test.X  where X is a progressive number,  for example: \n/tmp/unity_support_test.1\n", "Q: Encrypting Files and folder through terminal I am new to part of encryption on Ubuntu .\nIs there any way to encrypt files and folder with password from terminal ? without using truecrypt or cryptkeeper etc.\n\nA: You can encrypt and decrypt files with gpg\nTo encrypt a file\ngpg -c file.to.encrypt\n\nTo decrypt a file\ngpg file.to.encrypt.gpg\n\nBut gpg will not do entire directories. For entire directories you have several options, ecryptfs is popular.\n# Install if ecryptfs-utils if needed\nsudo apt-get install ecryptfs-utils\n\n# Make an encrypted directory\necryptfs-setup-private\n\nThat will make a directory \"Private\". Any data you put into the directory Private will automatically be encrypted when you log out and decrypted when you log in.\nIf you want a different behavior or a different directory ...\nmkdir ~/secret\nchmod 700 ~/secret\n\nsudo mount -t ecryptfs ~your_user/secret ~your_user/secret\n\nPut your data into ~/secrte\nTo encrypt\nsudo umount ~your_user/secret\n\nTo Decrypt\nsudo mount ./secret ./secret -o key=passphrase,ecryptfs_cipher=aes,ecryptfs_key_bytes=16,ecryptfs_passthrough=no,ecryptfs_enable_filename_crypto=yes\n\nHint: make an alias for that second command.\nSee http://bodhizazen.com/Tutorials/Ecryptfs or man ecryptfs for additional details.\n\nA: ecryptfs will certainly encrypt files and folders, ensuring that the data that gets written to disk is always encrypted, and that applications which need access to the cleartext context can get that seamlessly.\nHowever, to answer your question specifically, you can certainly encrypt a single file with a passphrase and gpg:\ngpg -c /tmp/file > /tmp/file.gpg\n\nTo encrypt a folder, you should use tar in conjunction with gpg:\ntar zcvf - /tmp/directory | gpg -c > /tmp/directory.tar.gz.gpg\n\n\nA: encfs, as suggested by the community docs, works pretty well. \nInstalling: In order to install you must first add the universe repository\nThen issue the command:\nsudo apt install encfs\nThen simply type into the terminal: encfs encrypted visible to create folders in the current directory   named encrypted and visible and set up a password. \nFor example, if I'm in the default (home) directory (use pwd to see where you are), this will create folders /home/ijoseph/visible and /home/ijoseph/encrypted for me, since my username is ijoseph. \nvisible can be written and read, and stores its data encrypted in the encrypted folder. \nTo \"hide\" your data and leave only the encrypted version of the folder, type\nfusermount -u visible. You'll want to do this before logging out or physically moving your laptop, usually, for protection. You'll notice everything disappears from the visible folder when you type ls. \nTo re-mount (re-gain access to the visible folder for read/write), run encfs encrypted visible again. \n", "Q: 100% CPU usage in Ubuntu 11.10 I recently installed Ubuntu 11.10 with Unity  to dual boot with windows 7 on my lap top. My laptop is running an Intel i7 quad-core and 8gb of RAM just as some background. I've noticed that when I'm running Ubuntu, my computer heats up a lot more than windows 7 and it seems like the battery life is a lot shorter. Using system monitor, I've seen that my computer goes through cycles of having 100% CPU usage to 20% to 1-3% and then back to 100% CPU usage. It does not, however, list the process that is eating up all this cpu (though occasionally, the gnome-system-monitor process is using 20% of my cpu). I was wondering what the problem is here? Is it a problem with unity? or is there something else going on? Mostly, when this is happening, I'm just using chrome or firefox, or empathy. Whats happening?\n\nA: By default, System Monitor will only display your own processes. You can show system processes by selecting Show -> All processes from the menu bar. Unity itself would never show up in the process list since it's just a plugin for Compiz. So if Unity was the problem, then Compiz would show a high CPU usage. Compiz 0.9 is slower than 0.8, this is confirmed. However, I see no reason why Unity itself should be very demanding, or why you would think so. \n11.04 and 11.10 were two very special versions in that there were large amounts of changes in the underlying system. As an example, my laptop had a battery life of about 5.5 hours on 10.04, 4.5 hours on 11.04 and 4 hours on 11.10. I've upgraded it to the development version of 12.04 (Precise Pangolin) and now it's back at about 5.5 hours. \nAll this is to say that you're not imagining it. Specially 11.10 has been very power hungry, and there is no single piece of software to blame. The Linux kernel has had some power issues as well, for instance. My desktop sounded like a Harley Davidson in 11.10, but not it's completely silent again. So it's a problem with 11.10 in general, and 12.04 fixes it on all my computers. While I don't want to recommend that you upgrade to it yet, at least it should be comforting to know that it'll most likely fix all those issues, and that it'll be available in the not so distant future. \n\nA: In system monitor select View All Processes.\nIn my case it was popularity-cont that was eating cpu.\nIt is part of the Ubuntu popularity contest which finds out what packages you have been using. That's fine, but not if it intrudes.\n\nA: I cut my cpu usage down to almost 0, when idle, by doing these three things.\n\n\n*\n\n*I uninstalled Mozilla Firefox.

So I would go for x64.\n\nA: As you can see, the debate rages =)\nIf you have a 64 bit processor you should start with a 64 bit OS, you are simply going to get better performance. If you google search you will find the benchmarks to back that ;)\nhttp://tuxradar.com/content/ubuntu-904-32-bit-vs-64-bit-benchmarks\nhttp://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=616&num=1\nTake note: most of the benchmarks are old as 64 bit has been on parity for long enough that the vast majority of people advise 64 bit (and so fewer people are publishing benchmarks).\n64 bit Ubuntu has been on parity with 32 bit for several years and you are no more or less likely to have problems with one vs another.\nIf you do run into the increasingly rare problems with 64 bit Ubuntu you could downgrade to 32 bit.\nIn terms of RAM, you can use up to 64 Gb RAM with a 32 bit PAE kernel, so the size of your RAM does not really enter into the equation, except that 64 bit will user your high ram more efficiently.\nUnderstand \"high ram\" is relative, but at a lower level 4 Gb is \"high ram\". If you wish to know the technical details, see the kernel discussions / documentation.\nhttp://linux-mm.org/HighMemory\nhttp://kerneltrap.org/node/2450\n\nA: I would go for 32-bit.\n64-bit does not give real advantages, except for being able to address more than 4 GB RAM. As you have 4GB 32-bit is not a problem.\nDisadvantage of 64-bit: data fields use twice the amount of memory: for example integers become 64-bit wide instead of 32-bit. So effectively, the available amount of memory drop by two (assuming everything is stored as an integer)\n", "Q: imagemagick convert command i have question regarding the convert and linux command in generate. i need to convert images using imagemagick\ni do:\nconvert -quiet -regard-warnings image.jpg -colorspace RGB +repage /tmp/tempfile.img\n\nthat works\nnow, when i do:\nconvert $tmpA1 -median 2 -clut $tmpA2\n\ni get:\nconvert: missing an image filename `/tmp/cartoon_2_17950.mpc' @ error/convert.c/ConvertImageCommand/2970.\n\nafter 3 day of searching i found this:\nconvert \\( $tmpA1 -median 2 \\) -clut $tmpA2\n\nand it works\nwhat is the purpose of the ( and )??\n\nA: Parenthesis limit the scope of an action. In this case it applies the median filter to just this input image, and then does something with that. You can read more about this in the manual (scroll down to Image Stack) and here's the extract:\n\nIn school, your teacher probably permitted you to work on problems on a scrap of paper and then copy the results to your test paper. An image stack is similar. It permits you to work on an image or image sequence in isolation and subsequently introduce the results back into the command line. The image stack is delineated with parenthesis. Image operators only affect images in the current stack.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu does not boot after bad shutdown I recently swapped from Windows7 to Ubuntu 11.10 due to problems with my Windows.\nUbuntu worked great for a few days with no problem, This morning I ran out of battery and the laptop shut down. I rebooted it and now it just displays an error message ( black screen with coding commands) it doesn't even go onto the purple screen anymore.\nAny help on this would be much appreciated..\nPs: would installing Ubuntu again make any difference?\n\nA: Reinstalling Ubuntu would most probably fix this problem. But in the event that happens you can do several steps. I recommend, if you want to fix the problem the first step is to run fsck from a LiveCD.\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert the LiveCD of Ubuntu and when you get to the Desktop open a terminal.\n\n*In the terminal type sudo fdisk -l to see all the partitions/hard drives you have. One of them is your Ubuntu system. It should look something like /dev/sda1 / /dev/sdb1 ....\n\n*Assuming you found the one you are using (Let us say /dev/sda1) do the following: sudo fsck /dev/sda1. It should start looking for problems in the partition like orphans and such.Most of the time this solves this. I have seen it happen sometimes in not only laptops but desktops also. After this there is no need for anything else.\n\n\nNow if you are not worry about the content or have already done a backup just reinstall Ubuntu, the LiveCD should give you the answer to \"Reinstall Ubuntu\" while executing the installation program from the LiveCD.\n\nA: First try:\nCtrl+c\n\nand then:\nAlt+Ctrl+F1\n\nIs it possible now to login (at least in text mode)?\n", "Q: Computer shudown during upgrade, Ubuntu not booting My computer shutdown because of critical temperature reached. I was upgrading my Ubuntu 11.04 to 11.10. Now, Ubuntu is not starting up.\n\nA: Basically you need to run a LiveCD to boot and use chroot to fix things.\n\n\n*\n\n*Get yourself a Ubuntu LiveCD\n\n*Boot from it\n\n*Mount broken partition:\nmount /dev/sdXX /mnt\n\n\n*Mount virtual filesystems:\nmount --bind /dev /mnt/dev\nmount --bind /proc /mnt/proc\nmount --bind /sys /mnt/sys\n\n\n*chroot to the mounted filesystem:\nmount --bind /usr/ /mnt/usr \nchroot /mnt\n\nNow you are 'inside' your normal partition and all commands you run are from that partition, same goes for the modifications! So you can fix your installation now.\nNormally you can continue/fix a failed apt-get using:\napt-get install -f\n\nYou might want to rerun:\napt-get dist-upgrade\n\nDepending on your problem (eg apt-get itself is broken due to the interrupted upgrade) you might to run some other commands in your chroot-ed environment as well. If you do not succeed you need to provide more details.\n", "Q: Is Unity 5.0 ready to use now? It seems relatively stable in videos and it isn't like the version of Unity I'm using in 11.10 is the most rock solid either, I have to restart it once in a while.\nIs there any reason I would not want to be using Unity 5.0 right now?\n\nA: It is somewhat well stable and also you can run it without risks in 11.10.\nIn case something goes wrong, use the command ppa-purge to revert back.\n\nA: It sounds like you're asking for a definite answer for something that is inherently indefinite. Software has bugs and some of those only show up in a portion of use-cases.\nIs it safe to use? Probably. I can't imagine it'll ever do any damage to anything and as Amith says, there's a PPA and you can purge that out with ppa-purge fairly easily.\nWill it crash? Explode? Be more stable? Who knows. I suggest you give it a test. If it has problems make sure you post new bugs on Launchpad so that, come release, other people in your situation have a better experience. \n", "Q: Problem: qt-gtk-engine I need to install this package in my Ubuntu 11.10 Oneric Ocelot. But, as I understand - this is obsolete now. But how can I install GTK+ engine for Qt?\n\nA: Many of the previous GTK+2 based theme engines have not been ported to use the GTK+3 API.  This also includes gtk-qt-engine - it looks like development of this has dramatically slowed.\nThere are a few engines with some very good themes being developed.\nFor QT-based apps you should use qt4-qtconfig and select the GTK style to make QT apps look similar to GTK based apps.  Then apply some of the excellent themes around which your QT-based apps should inherit the GTK characteristics.\nBelow are a selection of some AskUbuntu! Q&A's that you might care to consult.\n\nLinked Questions\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I theme my Qt app to resemble one written in Gtk?\n\n*What GTK+ 3 engines are available?\n\n*How do I change to a theme not listed in the Appearance screen?\n\n*Where to find great themes?\n", "Q: i386 deb package for amd64 machines I am building an application and I want to build a DEB package, but I have a problem...\nI want that the DEB package can be installed both 32 bits machines and 64 bits machines.\nThen I build a 32 bits package to support both architectures, but I have problems with the dependencies, when a 32 bits system installs the package, works good, but when a 64 bits system installs the package, the dependencies (shared libraries) to be installed should be the 32 bits ones (available on 64 bits repos.)\nHow can I accomplish that?\n\nA: A quick answer is given here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/32bit_and_64bit#How_to_Make_32-bit_Applications_Work_on_a_64-bit_Operating_System\nInstalling ia32-libs is surely the fastest solution, however it may not be enough, depending on the situation.\n\nA: With multiarch, this is easy. Just build a i386 deb. On an amd64 machine (if all the dependencies have been multi-arched in Ubuntu) the 32-bit versions of them will be installed.\n\nA: In the 64-bit installations, there should be an apt entry for the i386 repo, in which case you use packagename:i386 for the dependency, instead of packagename.  An example of this is wine, where you need 32 and 64-bit libs for running all your windows apps.\n", "Q: How can I elevate nautilus privileges to move or copy a folder as root? Say I have a folder open in Nautilus that's in my /home/user/temp directory. I'd like to move a folder from there to my /opt directory (it's a program). Is there a way I can elevate the copy command up to a sudo so that I can copy the folder without having to start a new instance of Nautilus from the command line? \n\nA: As far as I can say, based on what I know and have experienced:\nsudo is used for command line applications/commands and gksudo is useful when you try to run a program using the Run Application dialog window by pressing Alt+F2. \nI have read that gksudo is just the graphic version of sudo.\nAnyway, you can both drop sudo nautilus and/or gksu nautilus in a terminal for the purpose to do what you wish, having the same effect both commands. But if you want to omit the terminal and you wish to run it directly with the \"Run Application\" dialog window, just press Alt+F2 and write gksu nautilus, after which you will be prompted to enter your password, then the nautilus file browser will open with root privileges.\nAdditionally, you can achieve to open files/folders as root with a single click by using the \"Open as Administrator\" option via right click. Which in any case will open a new nautilus instance for the given folder and will open files as root, this may also open/run applications as root but I haven't tested it yet.\n\nYou can get the \"Open as Administration\" option in your contextual menu by installing nautilus-gksu via command line: sudo apt-get install nautilus-gksu or by using synaptic as shown in the next image:\n\nGood luck!\n\nA: you need to run Nautilus as root\ntype this in the terminal\ngksu nautilus\n\nnow you can move using the GUI.\nor use this command\nsudo mv -r /home/user/temp/<foldername>/ /opt/\n\n\nA: Here's the nautilus-script I use to open an admin (root) Nautilus window:\n#!/bin/bash\n# This Nautilus script opens the current nautilus window in admin mode.\n# Requires: perl, liburi-perl\n\nERROR_NEED_PERL=\"This script requires the liburi-perl package.

Spring? Groovy? Grails? Anything else?\n\nA: The answer: Yes.\nUbuntu is an operating system, just like Windows, and just like you can create open source software on Windows, you can create closed (and open) software on Ubuntu - just because the operating system is open sourced doesn't mean everything is open sourced. \nWhile selling it isn't really your question, it is indeed possible to sell commercial, closed source software in Ubuntu.\n\nYes, you can distribute proprietary software through Ubuntu by joining the Ubuntu Application Developer programme. In some cases the software is provided without a charge, and the developer makes money through advertising or upsells. In other cases a software license is sold to the user giving them rights to the software. Both systems are allowed in the Developer Programme.\n\nvia the Ubuntu Developer portals commercial software FAQ\n", "Q: What video card should I use with Ubuntu for a 27 inch monitor (color managed)? I want to buy a 27 inch monitor with a resolution of 2560x1440. I will use it for photography, so color management is very important. My current NVidia driver doesn't allow color management in Unity (Ubuntu 11.10).\nWhat video card should I buy to allow a color managed display with a resolution of 2560x1440?\n\nA: I got no answer, so I experimented myself and answer my own question in case others are interested too.\nFirst of all: the Phoronix site has lots of information about the performance of graphic adapters in Linux.\nSecond: color management in Gnome 3 (or Unity in Ubuntu 11.10) only works if the graphic adapter driver supports xRandR version 1.3 or higher. NVidia drivers don't, so NVidia adapters are not supported bij the Gnome color management tools. There are alternatives (like using dispCalGUI as a startup application), but these have drawbacks.\nAMD Radeon cards have open source and proprietary drivers that support xRandR 1.3. So I bought a HD 6850 card. These cards support DisplayPort cables. So I could connect my 27 inch monitor easily.\nThird: I tried the proprietary driver first because I expected better performance, but all kinds of errors occured. Using ALT+TAB to switch between applications for instance  led to weird problems (the Unity menu bar disappeared, and big jpeg's were not displayed by the default Gnome image viewer). So I returned to the default open source driver packed with Ubuntu 11.10. This driver works flawlessly with all kinds of software, and color management is supported.\nSo, now I am a happy 27 inch screen user. Editing photographs with Corel AfterShot Pro and stitching panorama's with Hugin.\nThanks Ubuntu! Thanks all open source developers! And thanks to Gnome.\n", "Q: Ubuntu CD not bootable I downloaded 11.10, and extracted it to a flash drive. now when i am booting it off the flash drive, it goes straight to Windows. i burnt the files onto a DVD and the same thing happens. it doesn't boot from the DVD. i tried a 11.04 CD and the computer boots from it no problem, which means, my computer is capable of booting from external devices. but form some strange reason, it isn't booting from the devices that has 11.10 on it.\nPlease help!!\n\nA: You should not have extracted the files as you said.\nThe .iso file you downloaded contains boot instructions necessary to make your computer boot the files you have at the moment, when you extracted the files from the .iso you extracted all the content files but not those necessary instructions.\nYou need not to record those extracted files but to record the complete .iso file.\nFor that (using Windows) I recommed ImgBurn (google for it, its free) and when you open the program select burn image, point it to the .iso file and select your CD/DVD as destination.\n\nA: If you burnt the image (.iso) to the flash drive correctly you should be able to change the boot options in the BIOS to boot from the flash drive before the hard drive.\n", "Q: How can I view the number of files in each folder in Ubuntu one folder?

(Pantograph, a Blender plugin, has only broken download links; VRM, another Blender plugin works with Belnder 2.4x, but not with Blender 2.6x.)\n\nA: You have two options:\nOption 1\nThe first requires a recent builds of Blender (available from Graphicall), which can now use the Freestyle rendering engine\n\nFreestyle is a software for Non-Photorealistic Line Drawing rendering\n  from 3D scenes.\n\nWithin Freestyle there exists a plugin, SVGWriter, that can write Blender scenes to SVGs. Instructions for usage are available on that page. Below is an example of its output:\nOriginal Blender render:\n\nFreestyle SVG output:\n\nFreestyle is still in development and you can follow its progress on their blog.\nThe still image SVG writer in SVGWriter currently only renders one image i.e. you can't render each frame to an SVG. I've rewritten the script to do this, and the author has informed me that my modification will be integrated into the main download in a future update. Here is the modification\nOption 2\nThe second option only allows you to render bezier curves. First, you must install svgwrite for Python 3. You can do this by going into the folder and running\nsudo python3 setup.py install\n\nYou may need to copy the svgwrite folder into .blender/version_number/python/lib/python3.2/\nYou then need to download SVGwriter for Blender. Install Git and then run\ngit clone git://gitorious.org/blender-2-6-svg-export/blender-2-6-svg-export.git\n\nInside the downloaded folder you will need to copy the Python scripts (those ending in .py) and overwrite the ones located either in ./blender/[version_number]/scripts/addons/io_curve_svg/ or in /usr/lib/blender/scripts/addons/io_curve_svg/ .\nFinally, in Blender, draw your bezier curve and then go to File > Export > SVG.

I have about 4.7 GB going to swap. That leaves about 21 GB of total space. I ran the Disk Utilization software and discovered some of the folders that were taking up too much space and deleted them.

I'm running Ubuntu 11.10 with GNOME shell.\n\nA: If you're running nautilus in as root, you'll see root's Desktop folder. Yours is likely in /home/yourname/Desktop (and the rest of your files are probably elsewhere in /home/yourname/)\nYou can use symlinks to make them available, but operating at root is usually not a good idea. Better to use sudo to run commands as root while logged in as your regular old user self. \nIn nautilus you can use go > location ... or ctrl-l to view and change the full path to the directory you're in. So do ctrl l and then just type in /home/yourname/Desktop to access the files in your own user desktop directory.\n\nA: If you launch as root you are in root's /home not your's. \n", "Q: How do I find Bluetooth in my BIOS? \nPossible Duplicate:\nDeactivate Bluetooth on startup \n\nI want to permanently disable Bluetooth, which I can't seem to do from the OS anymore. \nI've read that I need to make the change in my BIOS but I've gone through every setting in the BIOS and I don't see anything that rhymes with Bluetooth. \nHow do I stop it from launching on startup?\n\nA: Quite often BIOS has two sets of options.

Basically, I will have one or more Web Servers and 4 Riak servers (in a cluster).\nI want to use Shorewall or other firewall app to secure communications between the Web Server and the Riak Clusters so that no other servers can access the clusters but my own. Being the Riak is completely open on the server-side, this is essential before I take my servers into production.\nI assume I will have to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Shorewall on each of the Riak Servers\n\n*Lock down all ports initially\n\n*Open Port 4369 (epmd) and Port 8099 (handoff listener) on all Riak Servers + the range of ports defined in my app.config file\n\n*Open port 8098 and 8097 (for client) on all Riak Servers\n\n*Individually restrict access of one Riak server to the IP addresses of the other Riak Servers in the cluster + the IP address(es) of my Web Server(s). Repeat for other Riak servers in the cluster\n\n\nI can install Shorewall, but I'm not familiar with how to configure shorewall to do the above. I would appreciate some assistance.\n\nA: If you're going to use Shorewall just for being a firewall on machines with just one interface, it's a little bit of an overkill, in my opinion. Still, I do like to use Shorewall for this task anyway. Here's a short introduction that may help you to get started.\nSo, I'm assuming a single-interface IPv4-only configuration here. IPv4 and IPv6 versions of shorewall are independent but similar packages.\n$ sudo apt-get install shorewall\n\nAfter installing, everything is still disabled. First, let's copy over an example of a single interface configuration.\n$ sudo cp /usr/share/doc/shorewall/examples/one-interface/* /etc/shorewall\n\nThen let's configure the files one by one.\nTip: use the *.annotated.gz files for more annotations in your configuration files if you fancy that.\n\n\n*\n\n*zones - Leave as default. Configuring zones is mandatory, but since it's a single interface, it only contains one zone apart from the firewall itself (fw): net.\n\n*interfaces - Configure your single interface there. Default configuration will probably be quite okay, and I only remove dhcp as I'm not running DHCP on my servers.\n\n*policy - Defines policies for traffic between zones. As your number of zones is just one, this is easy too. By default, all traffic inbound is disallowed and all traffic outbound is allowed. Leave that default if you like that.\n\n*rules - This is where you configure exceptions to the policies defined. A simple example for allowing inbound TCP port 1234 from the whole outside IPv4 world would be this:\nACCEPT       net           $FW        tcp       1234\n\nConsider using some macros that help your config files more readable, like this one you probably want to set anyway:\nSSH(ACCEPT)  net:1.2.3.4   $FW\n\nTo allow SSH access from the IP address 1.2.3.4.\n\n*shorewall.conf - get it by gunzipping the shipped shorewall.conf.gz file. Check that IP_FORWARDING=Off if you don't do any forwarding and consider setting DISABLE_IPV6=Yes if you are not planning on configuring IPv6 on the machine. Finally, set STARTUP_ENABLED=Yes.\nEnable it for boot time too, in /etc/default/shorewall, set startup=1.\nNow check your current configuration by running\n$ shorewall check\n\nPlease do this every time you changed some file and before you actually restart Shorewall. It prevents downtime in case of a syntax error as it compiles complains about wrong syntax.\nIf all is well, you may give it a try to actually start:\n$ sudo service shorewall start\n\nAnd feel free to inspect the result in iptables:\n$ sudo iptables -L -n -v\n\n", "Q: Should I use use .htaccess to secure Wordpress, or can I use the virtual host config file? I`m using apache2 on ubuntu 11. I want to secure my wordpress site with .htaccess rules, but I understand that it is preferable to put the rules in the apache config file (httpd.conf).\nIf I understand correctly, the virtual site config file (under /etc/apache2/sites-available) is the config file for my wordpress, and not the main apache config.\nI want to put Mod_rewrite rules on my site, but when I put it in the config file of the virtual host, apache won't start (file to read the rules).\nSo, do I have to use .htaccess, or can I use the virtual host config file.\n(this is what I want to accomplish: http://journalxtra.com/websiteadvice/wordpress-security-hardening-htaccess-rules-4025/)\n\nA: Honestly, though it is technically \"preferable\" to put rule sin your apache config file, with something like a WordPress site, you're better off just using a .htaccess file, not least because almost everyone else who is hosting wordpress is doing it on a commercial web host where they don't have access to their Apache config files, so all the guidance out there assumes you're editing a .htaccess file. \n\nA: You should never put any site specific configuration in httpd.conf - use the site config file in /etc/apache2/sites-available instead. \nIf Apache complains you did something wrong. Most statements you can put into a .htaccess file need to go into a  section when you put them into the site config file - it's common error to forget this.\nIf you can't figure it out ourself please post the site config file that causes the trouble and the error messages you get when you try to start Apache.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server live cd rescue mode can't run fsck I have an ubuntu server virtual machine that crashed and I was forced to reset the virtual machine. When I booted, it did an automatic fsck, but I want to make sure that the filesystem is ok. I have searched for instructions on how to run fsck from an ubuntu live cd, but none of the instructions work!\nThe version of the ubuntu server live cd is 10.04.2 and when the live cd menu appears I chose \"Rescue mode\". I then went through the questions (similar to those during installation) and the final prompt asks you to choose a \"device to use as root file system\". I read online that I shouldn't mount the root file system if I want to run fsck, so I chose the option \"do not use a root file system\". Next option I selected was \"execute a shell in the installer environment\". I now get a command prompt, but when I try to run fsck /dev/sda1 I get \"fsck not found\".\nI'm completely lost and even the \"Official Ubuntu Server 2nd edition\" book doesn't explain the procedure properly.\nI hope someone more knowledgeable can help me out! Thanks.\n\nA: For anyone not seeing the disk devices (/dev/sda1 etc.), be sure to run \"Load installer components from CD\" from the main menu; say \"Do not use a root file system\" when prompted.\nTo run the actual fsck: You are correct that a generic fsck (which on other systems automatically calls the correct filesystem-specific fsck) does not exist. However, a range of filesystem-specific fsck are available, such as fsck.ext4. To see a list, type fsck without hitting enter and press tab twice -- the shell will display a list of possible completions. Pick the one that's appropriate for your file system (ext4 and ext3 are popular). I'm pretty sure that if you pick the wrong one, it will abort with an error message without causing any harm. Example:\nfsck.ext4 -f /dev/sda1\n\nThis runs the ext4 fsck utility on the first partition of the first SCSI disk. -f forces a full check even if the file system is marked clean.\n\nA: You will have to use the desktop cd (iso). You would boot the live iso with your VM, and run fsck from a terminal.\nThe server CD, as you can see, has a very limited \"live\" environment, and is used primarily for installation.\n", "Q: How to install Xubuntu complete version from the terminal?

To try to fix the problem I gave this command in terminal:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge wine wine1.3 .\nNow I suppose it is installing wine 1.2.\n\nA: The Wine application database contains information on the support status of very many Windows applications and games under different versions of Wine. When there are special instructions to follow for a specific application, they can usually be found there.\nA different option is to install PlayOnLinux, which automates these special steps and tries to use the best Wine version for each application.

My question then is: Will this updates in 3.3 be somehow pulled into the 3.2 kernel used for Ubuntu 12.04?\n\nA: Here is more information from the Ubuntu Kernel team on the work being done in this area:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/PowerManagementRC6\n\n*Improving Battery Life in Ubuntu Precise 12.04 LTS\n\n*Improving Battery Life in Ubuntu Precise 12.04 LTS (part 2)\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/PowerManagement/PowerSavingTweaks\n\n*RC6 Call for testing in Ubuntu 12.04 Precise Pangolin LTS\n\nA: If you are referring to the fix to the infamous ASPM power regression, according to this Phoronix article the fix has already been pulled into Precise. And looking at the changelog for the current Precise kernel, the patch \"pci: Rework ASPM disable code\" was pulled into Ubuntu's kernel at version 3.2.0-3.9. So yes :-)\n\nA: If you still have problems with the \"original\" 12.04-kernel, hit it with the 3.3 from http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/\nI still do 11.04 and the 3.3 works for me too, so i would give it a shot.\n", "Q: Will ALSA 1.0.25 version have time to enter 12.04 ALSA version 1.0.25 which comes with many good updates landed today.

I have tried other windows soft wares on wine the work fine... \n\nA: Sounds suspiciously like you're on an Intel graphics chipset. The open source driver doesn't include S3 Texture Compression for patent reasons. S3TC is used in almost all serious 3D applications, including games. Not having it tends to result in a lot of fail.\nI asked about this a while back and got an answer that worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there an easy way to enable S3TC on Intel graphics?\n\nA: Concerning the soundtracks: are they MP3s? I only ask because due to licensing issues Wine does not have mp3 support and the workarounds do not work. Some programs, like VLC have built in mp3 support and can play mp3s under wine, but games that use mp3s will not play them.\nYour lucky the game is not giving you an error about that, some games will not even run on wine until you delete it's sound files. Converting to OGG works for some games, however due to licensing issues with FFMPEG, you will not be able to use Linux to convert them. I had to use windows on my duel boot to convert the audio so I could go back to linux and use the  music in Wine.\n", "Q: Filter results into a usable variable I run the following command:\nsudo iwlist eth0 scan\n\nand get output that looks like this:\nCell 01 - Address: AB:CD:EF:12:34:56\n          ESSID:\"name\"\n          Protocol:IEEE 802.11g\n          Mode:master\n          Frequency:2.417 GHz (Channel 2)\n          Encryption key:on\n\nI won't bother filling it all out, as I'm trying to fix a laptop and I cannot simply copy the output.\nHow can I use built-in tools such as grep, awk, sed, etc. to fetch information given certain criteria? For example:\nI want to grab the mac address when knowing the essid. I also don't want to rely on the Cell # or line positions. Knowing common information, like the word Address before the mac is fine.\nExpected output:\nAB:CD:EF:12:34:56\n\nI want to use it in a variable, like so:\nsudo iwconfig eth1 ap $(command)\n\nWhere command would result in the expected result. If there's another way of pushing the result as a variable using > or something, that works as well. (command > sudo iwconfig eth1 ap $1)\nThanks.\n\nA: My personal preference for these things is pure bash. The script below should do what you are looking for.\nget_mac_of_essid() {\n target_essid=\"$1\"\n [ -z \"$target_essid\" ] && return\n interface=eth0\n\n # Ask for password now instead of in the middle of pipe below\n sudo -v\n\n mac=\"\" ; essid=\"\"\n {\n  while read line ; do\n   set -- $line\n   if [ \"$1\" = Cell ] ; then\n    # New network, so reset variables\n    mac=\"\" ; essid=\"\"\n    shift 3\n   fi\n   case \"$1\" in\n   Address:)\n    mac=\"$2\" # MAC is on this line, second field\n    ;;\n   ESSID:*)\n    essid=\"${1#ESSID:}\" # ESSID is on this line, first field after ':'\n    essid=\"${essid#\\\"}\" # Remove duoble quote at start\n    essid=\"${essid%\\\"}\" # Remove double quote at end\n    ;;\n   esac\n   if [ \"$essid\" = \"$target_essid\" ] && [ ! -z \"$mac\" ] ; then\n    echo \"$mac\" ; return\n   fi\n  done\n } < <(sudo iwlist $interface scan)\n}\n\nAfter pasting the above into your terminal, you should be able to run get_mac_of_essid name to get the MAC address associated with network \"name\" as many times as needed.\n\nA: I suggest learning the cut command. It makes this task easy. Forgive the echo, but I wanted to demonstrate on the original data.  \n$ echo 'Cell 01 - Address: AB:CD:EF:12:34:56  \n          ESSID:\"name\"  \n          Protocol:IEEE 802.11g  \n          Mode:master  \n          Frequency:2.417 GHz (Channel 2)  \n          Encryption key:on' | egrep Address | cut '-d:' -f2-  \n AB:CD:EF:12:34:56  \n\n$ echo 'Cell 01 - Address: AB:CD:EF:12:34:56  \n          ESSID:\"name\"  \n          Protocol:IEEE 802.11g  \n          Mode:master  \n          Frequency:2.417 GHz (Channel 2)  \n          Encryption key:on' | egrep ESSID: | cut '-d\"' -f2\nname\n\n\nA: AWK is very powerful and perfect for this. Basically, you want to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Save the address in the address line\n\n*If the ESSID matches your value, print it\n\n\nThe shortest version I could think of:\nsudo iwlist wlan0 scan|awk '/Address:/{a=$5}/ESSID:\"name\"/{print a}'\n\n/pattern/ is a regular expression that is compared with input. If it matches, the part after the curly brackets ({...}) is executed.\nThe awk command processes input line by line:\n\n\n*\n\n*If a line matches Address:, the fifth field is stored in a variable named a. Fields are whitepace-delimited lines.\n\n*If a line matches ESSID:\"name\", variable a is printed (the last address that matched).\n\n\nBoth rules are executed, but 1 comes before 2 so a is always set.\nManual page for awk\n", "Q: how do i shrink and divide the ubuntu partition after installing it alongside windows XP? i wanted to shrink the partition of my ubuntu to 20gb after i used the \"install alongside windows\" option and divided my HD into 2 partitions: (WINOS-60gb, ubuntu-100gb) my goal is to split HD into 3 partitions: WINOS-60gb, ubuntu-20gb, storage space-80gb. how do i do this?\n\nA: *\n\n*Back up your data first.

I have a 5th Gen Ipod Classic 150G. I've read there there are some issues with them and Linux. Clementine transfers my new music as files to the iPod as if it were a hard drive. I can look at the files from my computer but I cannot listen to them. How can clementine send my music so the ipod can see, read and play them?\n\nA: Not sure about Clementine as I don't use it. However I believe it's based  on Amarok 1.4 which IIRC did not have native ipod support. \nhttp://www.clementine-player.org/\nsuggests that you can copy the files to the ipod which means the ipod should see and play them. Remeber that when you copy files to the ipod you need to hit save otherwise the ipod's database won't get updated and so the new files won't be seen. Also, you might need to install libgpod to provide the functionality you need.\nIn my experience If you simply want to manage your Ipod then  I can confirm gtkpod is specifically designed for that purpose and works very well with my 80Gb Ipod classic. Also Amarok 2 works fine as well.\nHope this helps\n\nA: Which Clementine version do you use ?\nAt first, you should try the latest Clementine version (1.0.1), which should support your Ipod.\nYou can download the deb package for your Ubuntu version at:\nhttp://code.google.com/p/clementine-player/downloads/list\nor stay up to date with Clementine via PPA:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:me-davidsansome/clementine\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install clementine\n\n\nA: Check exactly the how big is your ipod(no such thing as 150GB ipod, 160 maybe) and the generation.\nMount the iPod (connect the cable, wait for the system to report it was mounted)\nClick the devices tab in clementine, and wait for the program to recognize the iPod\nDrag some music from the main list to the iPod window.\nIf this is what are you doing, you might also try to downgrade the firmware of the iPod( I read it is possible, this usually causes some pain)\nUse floola (search for it, alothough slow, this is the software that worked for me without any issues)\nLast, but not least: PRAY!!!\n\nA: I had a problem quite similar, I could put my music on my iPod Classic (160Go), I could then see them on my iPod but it was impossible to listen to it.

So try an 'apt-get --simulate install libssl-dev make' to get the list of packages you need to download from http://packages.ubuntu.com and install.\nThe specific answer to your \"How do I upgrade offline\" question has two parts, and you need both parts together for a successful upgrade. First, the Alternate CD image has upgrade packages for the default install. Second, keep that list of other packages handy, and download the latest versions of them all into an apt-zip or apt-on-cd repo.

I am on ubuntu 11.04 using ubuntu classic desktop environment and I want to try Gnome3, How should I install it and will installing it remove ubuntu classic?\n\nA: Upgrading to 11.10 will move you over to Gnome 3. I do not recommend upgrading to Gnome 3 in 11.04 since that can make things difficult for you later. When people refer to Ubuntu Classic, they're really talking about a shell called Gnome Panel. In a fresh install of Ubuntu 11.10, you won't have it. I don't remember if it'll be removed when upgrading. If so, you can easily reinstall it from the official archives: http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/gnome-session-fallback. This is the one we've used in all versions of Ubuntu prior to Unity. This shell is still available in Gnome 3 (hence also Ubuntu 11.10), but there are a few changes: \n\n\n*\n\n*Since Gnome now uses the Gnome Control Center for settings, there's no longer a System menu in the menubar at the top left. \n\n*Applets are now grouped either to the left, center or right. You can't have applets outside of these groups. This is due to an old bug that caused applets to be moved around randomly when changing resolutions, etc. You can still order them however you like though.\n\n*You now have to press and hold the alt-key (or super+alt) when customizing the panel. In other words; instead of right-click > Add to panel, you now use super+alt right-click > add to panel. The same is true when moving applets. You have to press and hold alt and then middle-click and drag. \n\n*You no longer have to lock applets. They're automatically locked in place when you move them. \n\n\nIf you use indicators, you'll need to install the indicator-applet-complete from a PPA. Open a terminal and use the following commands: \n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:jconti/gnome3\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install indicator-applet indicator-applet-complete indicator-applet-session\n\nIf you also want application menus to integrate with the panel, you can also sudo apt-get install indicator-applet-appmenu from the same PPA. \nNone of these will be automatically added, so you'll need to add them to the panel as you would with any other applet. \nSince the underlying technologies have changed in Gnome 3, applets need to be ported. That's why you have to install these from a PPA and not from the Ubuntu archives. If you use other panel applets, you should check first to see if they've been ported. If you don't, then these instructions will give you an almost identical experience to the one you had in 11.04, except for the differences I mentioned above. \nThis is an example of a Gnome Panel desktop in 11.10: \n\n", "Q: Should Ubuntu work with Dell Dimension 8200?

To avoid this you simply need to select a different set of fonts in Doc > Settings > Fonts. The Latin Modern family should give the same look and feel as CM, only using vector fonts.

I'm looking for good documentation (an example, tutorial, or guide) on how to add global menu support to a non-gtk, non-qt application.  (In gtk it works 'magically' for the main menu...). \nThe toolkit I want to use this with is kivy, which supports the glib-mainloop (e.g. for gstreamer), so in principle all should work there.\nI have seen the API reference of Dbusmenu and here, but that is not very helpful for understanding the mechanisms. \nThere is a short example for creating a launcher-quicklist which contains a dbus-menu, but not for the global-menu / appmenu. \nThere is a wiki page that does not contain any relevant information other then \"Work on supporting other the application menu on other toolkits would be welcome, but not a priority for the DX team, help wanted.\" \nThere is a little information in this graphic from the indicator-appmenu source code, but its not enough, can not be found on developer.ubuntu.com and requires more explanation:\n\nSo: \n\n\n*\n\n*What is the procedure that gets a set of menu items (Dbusmenu.Menuitem) to be displayed? \n\n*What role does the client and the server play? (Which of those is supposed to be run in my application? Or both?)\n\n\nSimilar question\n\nA: In general, I'd recommend using the toolkit supported ways to put menus in the global menubar... but, I'm assuming it's too late to convince you at this point :-)  Also, I'll note that even thought we're using Dbusmenu and registration in 12.04 the goal is to move to GMenuModel and marking the window with its menus by 14.04, so this information will become dated.  Ofcourse, the toolkit plug-ins will be updated ;-)  (last time I'll try, I promise)\nThe basic principle involved is that we need to know what menus are associated with which window.  We track the window using its XID and the menus are a path to the Dbusmenu Server on DBus.  You'll need both of those pieces of information to register.  The registration interface is pretty simple in that you basically pass both of those pieces of information to the registrar.  The registrar's well known name on DBus is com.canonical.AppMenu.Registrar.\nFor an example of how this can work you can look at the mock-json-app sample code that is in indicator-appmenu.  This is a small tool that will take the JSON file output by dbusmenu-dumper (which is in libdbusmenu-tools) and make a window that claims to have that menu.  It also handles things like the appmenu crashing, which might not be really required for most application (though is really important in development :-) ).\nTo create a Dbusmenu Server you basically just need to allocate the object and tell it where to appear on DBus (so you can give the location to the registrar).  For plugins like appmenu-gtk we use a generated path so that there is no conflict, but if you're controlling the app you can probably use a fixed path.  Then you create a tree structure of Dbusmenu Menuitem objects.  The root one isn't shown, but is passed to the Dbusmenu Server to start out the menus.  The first level bellow the root will be shown as items across the Ubuntu Menubar.\nGood luck, thanks to all the people who harassed me to answer this question.  I still believe that you should use the toolkit support (I lied about it being the last time), but good luck!\n\nA: Unfortunately, you will not find a friendly document for that. The global menu was developed with GTK and Qt in mind and, while it is theoretically possible to implement support for other webkits since the protocol is DBus-based, there was very little effort in making documentation available.\nThe best pointers I can give you are the source codes of indicator-appmenu and plasma-widget-menubar. You can read those to understand how the dbus protocol works.\n\nA: You can use python-dbus bindings, and use the API documented at http://developer.ubuntu.com/api/ubuntu-12.04/python/Dbusmenu-0.4.html for DbusMenu, to integrate with the global menu bar.\n", "Q: Safe remove of grub and lilo instead? lenovoZ570, i7 x64,8GB, 700GB, Nvidia Optimus+intel, 1366x768, win7+11.10 ubuntu+kubuntu.

But i work more with linux and remember \"lilo\" from suse doing a nicely job.\nIs it possible to remove this boring grub2 safely and install lilo, despite it is from a rival business?\n\nA: LILO is not from any business.  It is open source and the original non dos based Linux boot loader ( yes, originally you could load linux from DOS ).  It is still in the repositories if you want to install it, but at this point, using it is like using windows 3.1.  It is ancient and woefully inferior to grub2.\n\nA: If your Grub install works then I would not deliberately mess with it or with bootloaders in general unless you have to! If you do have issues with how Grub works on your system then LILO is still a very good option. It is more primitive than Grub and Grub2 but that often is a big plus. Note however that if you do end up with a corrupted LILO boot loader that it does not give you a command line option, unlike Grub and therefore you do then have to boot from a USB, CDROM or external drive and fix it manually.\nWhile they are not specific to Ubuntu, if you need more information these are useful sources:\nhttp://linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2008/01/22/lilo-and-grub-boot-loaders-made-simple.html\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/LILO\n", "Q: How to unblock something listed in rfkill?

So I would like to use something else: maybe there is an motherboard identificator or something else?!\nI need to get this id using Python...\n\nA: As our Self-Appointed Benevolent Dictator for Life would say: Note to content owners: DRM doesn’t work. \nEssentially, there is no reliable way of doing DRM (including the license key technique you are probably using). Instead it might be a much better approach to provide an easy way to buy the product to a reasonable price. This will probably result in a much easier code base for you, an easier distribution process, upgrade process and in the end happier users. \nA good example is OSMOS: you can buy the game online, and download it from then on for as many computers, architectures as you need and want. And they have a lot of happy users with this solution. \nAnother example is the Ubuntu One Music store (which I love) and where it is so easy to buy and sync music that I never again had the feeling that it might be easier to download a song from an illegal source.\n\nA: Other serial numbers (through dmidecode) seem rather inconsistent to me. On my media centre they pour out but on my desktop I can't see anything.\nI would have said if you wanted to do this, you just use eth0. Almost every computer has at least one ethernet port and that will always render a MAC address. There are some problems though:\n\n\n*\n\n*MAC addresses can be changed. Easily.\n\n*MAC addresses duplicate. Considering half the address is vendor/model ID, lots of vendors only get a few million unique keys and clearly make many millions more devices - so there are duplicates in the wild.\n\n*Some devices don't have ethernet port, it's disabled, or it's only occasionally on. This is a problem if you try to dynamically change which port you're IDing from. If you start on wlan0 because it's the only one available at the time and then eth0 comes on line the next time you check, you might annoy the customer.\n\n\nYou might do best to take an amalgum of hardware information (motherboard name, processor ID, number of CPUs, graphics name, amount/configuration of RAM etc).\nJust make sure you're not stupid about how paying customers go through the re-authentication process. As soon as you make this process harder to work through than just pirating it, you've lost the game. Oh and don't forget you'll need to advertise the fact you're collecting and storing this identifiable up-front, ideally before purchase.\n\nA: I think You should ask this question on gamedev.net forum.\nI'm sure someone there will help You. :)\nAnd how about creating a software key dependent on the hardware configuration?\nFor example:\nif one has a nVidia VGA then add to key 'x'\nif ATI 'y'\nIf har drive is HDD then add 'h'\nand so on you could possibly create a quite long letter or number combination that could be used as a key.\n", "Q: Unable to create Hotspot with internet connection for iPod 4G?

The first one is a red alert/warning icon in the upper panel. The other one is the notification bubble that mentions there is an update and how many updates are available as seen on this image:\n\nThe problem is that on the PC it does not mention any updates, nor does it show a notification bubble saying that I have updates.

The only way I have found not to have blank lines inserted is not to use the scroll wheel.  Has anybody else noticed this behavior?

Linux is extremely good at memory management. You could never hope to compete with it. And you wouldn't want to unswap just because you had free RAM. Because Linux knows what parts of the memory is most useful. In other words; you'd reduce performance drastically by manually moving unused memory from the harddisk and into RAM. \n\nA: See the section titled \"What is swappiness and how do I change it?\" on this page:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq\nBut, I also agree with Jo-Erlend Schinstad. If there is no urgent need to change the default behavior, it is best to leave it alone. However, I see that the article itself recommends a value of 10, while the default is 60. So, changing to the recommended value of 10 should take you the way you want to go (less swapping).\nAlso, part of your original question is, how to empty swap. swap is emptied every time you reboot.\n", "Q: Ubuntu startup script Is there a way to look at the script of things that Xubuntu does when it starts up? \nAlso to see the error logs it generates?\n\nA: The standard locations for startup scripts are:\n/etc/rc#.d/\n\nor\n/etc/rc.d/rc#.d\n\nWhere # is the runlevel that the system starts into.

I have an executable file mpiexec, whose full path is ~/petsc-3.2-p6/petsc-arch/bin/mpiexec.  Since I want to execute this command in different directories (without having to retype the entire path), I setup an alias in my home .bashrc file:  \nalias petsc=\"~/petsc-3.2-p6/petsc-arch/bin/mpiexec\"  \n\nwhich allows me to execute this mpiexec file at the command prompt easily by typing:  \npetsc myexecutable\n\nI tried to write a shell script file, named script, using my new alias petsc as a command.  After giving my shell script the appropriate permissions (using chmod), I tried to run the script.  However, it gave me the following error:  \n./script: line 1: petsc: command not found\n\nI know that I could just write the full path to the mpiexec file, but it is cumbersome to write the full path everytime that I want to write a new script.  Is there a way that I can use my alias petsc inside the script file?  Is there a way I can edit my .bashrc or .bash_profile to make this happen?\n\nA: *\n\n*In .bash_aliases:\npetsc {\n~/petsc-3.2-p6/petsc-arch/bin/mpiexec \"$@\"\n}\n\nOr put the function in .bashrc. Usually in .bashrc only config settings of bash are stored.\n\n*In Terminal: source .bash_aliases\n\n*Call it: petsc arg(s)\nAdvantage: you do not need export -f petscin .bash_aliases. Aliases are deprecated but using .bash_aliases for functions is ok.\n\nA: ALIASES\n   ...\n   Aliases are not expanded when the shell is not interactive, unless the expand_aliases shell option is set using shopt (see the description of shopt under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS\n   below).\n\nSo the real answer to this question, for those looking to use actual aliases in shell scripts instead of alternatives to them, is:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nshopt -s expand_aliases\n\nalias foo=bar\n\nfoo whatever\n\nAs for why I'd want to do this: Due to unusual circumstances, I need to trick a Dockerfile into thinking it's a shell script.\n\nA: *\n\n*Use your aliases in your shell script. \n\n*Source your script in your current, interactive shell instead of executing it. \n\n\nSo if you have a file called script.sh with your commands that include using aliases, simply type:\nsource script.sh\n\n\nA: In bash 4 you can use special variable: $BASH_ALIASES.\nFor example:\n$ alias foo=\"echo test\"\n$ echo ${BASH_ALIASES[foo]}\necho test\n$ echo `${BASH_ALIASES[foo]}` bar\ntest bar\n\n\nAlternatively define as variable then use command substitution or eval.\nSo for example, instead of defining the alias such as:\nalias foo=\"echo test\"\n\ndefine it as:\nfoo=\"echo test\"\n\ninstead. Then execute it by either:\nfind . -type f -exec sh -c \"eval $foo\" \\;\n\nor:\nfind . -type f -exec sh -c \"echo `$foo`\" \\;\n\n\nA: (EDIT: removed functions since I misread calling of mpiexec.)\nIf the only thing you need is less typing, why don't you just put the folder in $PATH? Or make a symlink to mpiexec from some folder in $PATH? Or (my favourite) put the alias in a script that you source in the calling script?\n\nA: Shell functions and aliases are limited to the shell and do not work in executed shell scripts. Alternatives for your case:\n\n\n*\n\n*(if you do not bother to use mpiexec instead of petsc) Add $HOME/petsc-3.2-p6/petsc-arch/bin to your PATH variable. This can be done by editing ~/.profile and appending:\nPATH=\"$HOME/petsc-3.2-p6/petsc-arch/bin:$PATH\"\n\nRe-login to apply these changes\n\n*Create the directory ~/bin and\n\n\n*\n\n*make a wrapper script named petsc containing:\n#!/bin/sh\nexec ~/petsc-3.2-p6/petsc-arch/bin/mpiexec \"$@\"\n\n\n*if the program allows for it, you can skip the shellscript and make a symlink using the command:\nln -s ~/petsc-3.2-p6/petsc-arch/bin/mpiexec ~/bin/petsc\n\n\nA: You can force bash to execute your script as an interactive shell with the -i flag. This will tell your .bashrc file to define aliases and other functions. \nExample:\n~ $ grep ll .bashrc\nalias ll='ls -lah'\n~ $ cat script.sh \n#!/bin/sh\n\nll\n~ $ bash script.sh \nscript.sh: line 3: ll: command not found\n~ $ bash -i script.sh\n..directory contents..\n\nMore info: \n$ man bash\n\n\nA: Some options:\n\n\n*\n\n*In your shell script use the full path rather then an alias.\n\n*In your shell script, set a variable, different syntax\npetsc='/home/your_user/petsc-3.2-p6/petsc-arch/bin/mpiexec'\n\n$petsc myexecutable\n\n\n*Use a function in your script. Probably better if petsc is complex\nfunction petsc () {\n    command 1\n    command 2\n}\n\npetsc myexecutable\n\n\n*Source your aliases\nshopt -s expand_aliases\nsource /home/your_user/.bashrc\n\nYou probably do not want to source your .bashrc, so IMO one of the first 3 would be better.\n\nA: Aliases are deprecated in favor of shell functions. From the bash manual page:\n\nFor almost every purpose, aliases are superseded by shell functions.\n\nTo create a function and export it to subshells, put the following in your ~/.bashrc:\npetsc() {\n    ~/petsc-3.2-p6/petsc-arch/bin/mpiexec \"$@\"\n}\nexport -f petsc\n\nThen you can freely call your command from your shell scripts.\n\nA: Please use #!/usr/bin/env sh instead of #!/usr/bin/env bash, then it works.\nsample:\nmy.sh\n#!/usr/bin/env sh\n\nalias k=\"kubectl --kubeconfig ~/shop/config\"\nk version\n\n./my.sh\n\nIf you have to use #!/usr/bin/env bash, then execute the script as the following way:\nsh my.sh\n\n\nA: You can use case statement like this when in a sub-shell:\nfunction execute() {\n        case $1 in\n                ls) $@ --color=auto ;;\n              grep) $@ --color=auto ;;\n             fgrep) $@ --color=auto ;;\n             egrep) $@ --color=auto ;;\n                 *) $@ ;;\n        esac\n}\n\n\n( execute $@ )\n\n\n", "Q: Safely Unmount External Drive on Lubuntu I'm using Lubuntu and have an external hard drive.\nI would like to safely unmount the external hard drive.\nClicking the eject button in the file manager unmounts the drive, but does not power it down. (EDIT: Clicking on mount and then unplugging the drive means, at least on my machine, that the drive is still spinning when it's unplugged. This isn't good for the drive, so it's not good for my data!)\nNaturally, 'umount' does not perform this function.\nI can issue 'sudo hdparm -Y /dev/sdb', but this still leaves the drive's light on and I don't think it syncs the drive.\nI seem to recall 'sudo sdparm --command=stop /dev/sdb' powering the drive down appropriately in the past, but this doesn't seem to be working now, and it's a mystery as to why the GUI doesn't have an option to do this.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: I think udisks --detach [device] can help you.\n\nA: You can use Gnome Disk Utility (palimpsest) to power down hard drive. In Ubuntu Gnome it is available under hard drive context menu (\"Safely remove ...\" I guess).\n\nA: This is an old thread, however, adding my answer just in case if someone wants to know. \nIn Lubuntu, you can first Unmount the drive by clicking on File Manager > External Drive > right-click and Unmount. \nNow, to Eject the disk safely, click on Menu > Accessories > Disks. Here select the drive you want to eject and click on the \"Power Button\" on the top. This will turn the device off and should be safe to remove. \n\nA: Menu → Preferences → Disks - Eject this disk button.\n\nA: Unmounting the drive is enough to sync it and to be safe in unplugging it, with the added advantage of being able to remount it, if you want.\n", "Q: How to recover data from NTFS partition that was made into a Swap partition? I have extremely important stuff on my windows partition which during the ubuntu 10.10 installation,when it said that I should create something called swap space, I selected it to be a swap space (without even knowing what it actually meant)\nThe Grub2 doesn't show up so I don't get a choice to boot Ubuntu or Windows. I don't get my windows partition as a removable device in Ubuntu either. When I go to disk utility and select the sda2 (i.e.. my windows partition) and click edit partition and select HPFS/NTFS for the type and tick bootable and click OK the small processing sign keep on rotating on the bottom right of the sda2 in the chart and after about 10 to 15 minutes it gives an unknown error and thus, I am still unable to use my windows.\nI am even worse than a beginner who doesn't know a thing about Ubuntu so please be patient and help me out.\n\nA: Don't let the panic invade you. Before trying anything, follow this steps:\nNote: to open a program, just press Super to open the dash, and search for its name.\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't turn your computer on. Instead, go get a Ubuntu live-CD and boot with it.\n\n*Immediately after it has booted, open a Terminal and disable the swap partition with:\nsudo swapoff -a\n\nIt's very important to do that, or your Ubuntu will overwrite the contents of the partition when it gets out of memory.\n\n*(Optional) If have an external disk with enough space, save a full copy of your drive on it:\nsudo apt-get install gddrescue\ncd /media/your-external-disk\nddrescue -v /dev/sd? backup.dd state.log\n\nBe sure to replace the ? with the letter of the damaged drive.\nRun GParted if you don't know which one is it.\n\n*Install testdisk with:\nsudo apt-get install testdisk\n\nand then run it with sudo testdisk.\n\n*This is the program that may save your bacon!\nThen, just follow these steps very carefully.\nIf you're lucky, you will be able to access your original files and restore your partition back!\n\nA: Probably you will not be able to access that partition from your ubuntu installation because its being used as swap space and should not be ummounted. You can try using a live cd like parted magic http://partedmagic.com/doku.php?id=start to boot and access your sda2 partition from there. If you didn't use a lot your ubuntu system after the install, probably you still can recover your data in that partition, but also it is very probable that your data was overwritten and lost when the partition was used as swap for your ubuntu system.\nYou can try using Testdisk from the parted magic live session to recover your ntfs partition \n\nA: I've had the same issue, even worse - I managed to turn into swap one of my NTFS drives and linux /home ext4 partition. Recovering NTFS partition was relatively simple using testdisk following what Alba suggested. Recovering ext4 required some more steps:\nAfter recovery using testdisk, gparted of linux-mint live boot drive still considered the home partition to be swap. In testdisk I had to do the following:\nAfter selecting disk and partition type, go to Advanced, choose my ext4 partition and choose [Type] in the bottom, change type to \"MS Data\" and then \"ext4\", after that there will be a [Superblock] option at the bottom. That gave me a list of superblock locations (backups I guess) like this:\n     Partition                  Start        End    Size in sectors\n\n\n\nMS Data                614402048  894853119  280451072 [Home]\nsuperblock 0, blocksize=4096 [Home]\nsuperblock 32768, blocksize=4096 [Home]\nsuperblock 98304, blocksize=4096 [Home]\nsuperblock 163840, blocksize=4096 [Home]\nsuperblock 229376, blocksize=4096 [Home]\nsuperblock 294912, blocksize=4096 [Home]\nsuperblock 819200, blocksize=4096 [Home]\nsuperblock 884736, blocksize=4096 [Home]\nsuperblock 1605632, blocksize=4096 [Home]\nsuperblock 2654208, blocksize=4096 [Home]\n\nTo repair the filesystem using alternate superblock, run\nfsck.ext4 -p -b superblock -B blocksize device\n\nso in a separate terminal tab I ran\nfsck.ext4 -p -b 32768 -B 4096 /dev/sda1\n\nAnd finally gparted saw the drive as an ext4 and not swap, I managed to mount the drive and finally see all my files back\n\nA: I had exactly the same problem and was able to restore the partition, it even booted the Windows as before the accident.\nWhen using testdisk, if there are many partitions and you're not sure which to undelete, what I did was to first find my lost partition that I wanted to recover and undelete it (change type from D to either P or L), then for the rest of the partitions in testdisk - switch type (in my case from D(elete) to P(rimary)) one at a time and testdisk will tell you at the bottom if the structure is OK or bad (in red). It is bad when there are overlapping sectors, so you could also tell that by looking at the start and end sectors for each partition. Also as long as the structure is OK, the undeleted partitions are all in green, when there is a conflict all rows turn white.\nThen I restored the boot from the boot backup as described in the last part of the link @Alba provided, and my Windows booted successfully.\n", "Q: Why did my keyboard stop working?

Turning it off fixed it.\n", "Q: Why does the grub menu list two different versions of Ubuntu to boot into after I upgraded? I successfully upgraded from 10.04 to 10.10, albeit with a bit of a struggle. \nHowever, after upgrading to 10.10, I rebooted to find that I had a new option. Windows XP, Ubuntu 10.10 AND Ubuntu 10.04. \nI was wondering why the new upgrade didn't overwrite the original 10.04 install. I have yet to boot from the 10.04 again. Is this common?\n\nA: Try the following: open a terminal, type sudo update-grub, hit enter and type your password (there won't be any stars or so) and hit enter again. Wait a little, and reboot your computer. Did this erase the Ubuntu 10.04 entry?\nIf it doesn't, try to select the 10.04 entry and boot on it.

You should now update, preferably by using E.G.O. The problem is I set the icon size to be too big in stylesheet.css. If you'd like to modify it, you only need to change the height to 22, in both places. The new version 4 will be available on Github & E.G.O very soon, and fixes several problems.\nFor everyone with the problem, press Alt+F2 and enter the following:\ngnomesu gedit .local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/show-desktop@l300lvl.tk/stylesheet.css\n\nThen, find and change the 'height' to a lesser value like 20/18/16/14 and then Ctrl+S to save, Alt+F2 and r to restart the shell.\n\nA: I found the issue myself.

This works for the EasyCap DC60+ which is based on an Empia 2861 chip.\nWith it plugged in type lsusb in a terminal to find out what type it is if the following doesn't work.\nAssuming it is supported, using VLC it should be easy. Connect the device and open VLC. In VLC select media/open capture device. If using S video as a source, hit play. If using composite you will need to take an additional step - hit advanced options and then in the video input box select 1 (that's composite - s video is 0 (default).\nIf all is good on the video front, there is then audio. If it works - great. If it doesn't,like on the Easycap you can always bypass the card with a 2XRCA into 3.5 jack and plug it into the mic/line in socket.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: How to add current time to the unlock screen?

But now I am afraid that every time I want to save or create something, whether using Rails console or my text editor, I'm going to get permission errors.\nShould I move my project into my home dir?\n\nA: Yes You should use Your home folder\nfor example \nmkdir home/YourUserName/Ruby\n\n\nA: Add your user to the www-data group.\nThen log out and back in.\nThe set your permissions in /var/www\nFiles are owned by root:www-data , permissions of 660\nDirectories are also owned by root:www-data , permissions of 770\nSee:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo\nOn a production server (anything publilc facing), I use the same ownership.\nPermissions -\nfiles 640\ndirectories 750\nOn a production server I edit everything as root ( sudo -e /var/www/file )\n", "Q: How To Fix A Corrupt .Deb? All right, so, I got a really persistent error. I tried to install mfc6490cwlpr:i386 (downloaded as mfc6490cwlpr-1.1.2-2.i386.deb) and installed it using either gdebi or the Ubuntu Software Centre, probably both even. Following instructions, I restarted my computer and the following error appeared on my upper bar in Unity:\nAn error occured, please run Package Manager from the right-click menu or apt-get in a terminal to see what is wrong. The error message was: 'Unknown Error:'<type 'exceptions.SystemError'>'(E:The package mfc6490cwlpr:i386 needs to be reinstalled, but I can't find an archive for it.)'. This usually means that your installed packages have unmet dependencies\n\nI tried several ways to remove it. Among the following commands:\nsudo dpkg --remove --force-remove-reinstreq mfc6490cwlpr:i386\nsudo dpkg --force-all -r mfc6490cwlpr:i386\n\nDigging further into history, I find this command:\nsudo dpkg  -i  --force-all  --force-architecture  mfc6490cwlpr-1.1.2-2.i386.deb\n\nI'm running on a 64-bit AMD processor.\nWhenever I do anything that involves apt-get, updating, synaptic or what what what, I get this error:\nReading package lists...

Done\nE: The package mfc6490cwlpr:i386 needs to be reinstalled, but I can't find an archive for it.\n\nThe updater recommended a dist-upgrade, which didn't work.\nDoes anyone have any ideas to remove the corrupt .deb? I can reinstall it later when I have more time to look into hooking up the printer. But for now, I'm more concerned about getting it off off my computer.\nWorth mentioning: I am NOT adept at the command line, though I try hard. I'm fairly dangerous with it, actually.\n\nA: (posted in question by OP)\n----FIX----:\nFixed it already. The following link helped: http://blog.bodhizazen.com/linux/apt-get-how-to-fix-very-broken-packages/\nHere's what it says: Go into the /var/lib/dpkg/info directory using the terminal. Do:\nls [PART OF NAME OF PACKAGE]*\n\nMind that the asterisk (*) is important. If all's right you get five results, of which 3 are green. At least, that was the case in my case. If you get more, write the name of the package almost in full and try the above command again.\nThen do:\nsudo rm [PART OF NAME OF PACKAGE]*\n\nAnd follow with:\nsudo dpkg --remove --force-remove-reinstreq [NAME OF PACKAGE]\n\nDon't follow this advice if you haven't tried anything else yet. I fear it's highly destructive, lol, but I survived the aftermath and apt-get is working again.\n\nA: The following is a graphical and clean method.\nOpen the Update Manager app, check for updates. You should see \"Partial upgrade\" appearing. Click on it and verify it proposes to remove your particular package only. Then proceed.\n", "Q: How can I add another GMail entity in Thunderbird? I have setup GMail to use another email account I have (non-Google), so when I send emails from GMails web UI, I can choose to send from that other domain. How do I add such an option to Thunderbird? That is, I would like to use GMails SMTP server, but send messages using my other account. \n\nA: In Thunderbird, if you click Edit > Account Settings, you will be given a window which allows you to make all sorts of changes.  From the menu on the left, choose \"Outgoing Server (SMTP),\" and then on the right side you'll see the current SMTP servers you have set up.  Click the \"Add\" button to, um, add a new SMTP server:\n\nOnce you have entered the new information into the smaller window, click OK.  You can now highlight this server in the Outgoing Server (SMTP) Settings window, and choose the \"Set Default\" button on the right. Choose the OK button at the bottom, and then close Thunderbird and reopen it, and when you send e-mail it will use the account you have chosen for your SMTP server.\nYour POP or IMAP server will receive mail, and your SMTP server will send it.\n\nA: Thunderbird allows you to use different identities for an email account. You can do this in order to use different formatting, signatures, reply-to addresses, templates, encryption, etc for different circumstances. For instance, if you have another email domain attached to your GMail account, you can add another identity for that domain. You can then choose which identity to send from when composing a message, as if you had several email accounts added to Thunderbird. \nIt's quite easy to configure: \n\n\n*\n\n*Open the View > Accounts settings in the main window.\n\n*Near the bottom of the dialog that appears, click \"Manage identities\"\n\n*Edit the preferences for that identity. \n\n*Compose a new message and notice that From can be changed when you write a message. When you do, all those preferences will be applied to the message.\n\n", "Q: which version of ubuntu should I install? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat is the difference between 32bit and 64 bit and which should I chose? \n\nHej,\nI am about to install ubuntu 11.10 on my laptop:\nhttp://reviews.cnet.com/laptops/dell-studio-s15z-2249cpn/4507-3121_7-33974716.html?tag=mncol;subnav\nI am not familiar with ubuntu and this is the first time for me using it.\nfirst of all, 32 or 64 bit?\nmoreover, after installing it, what should i do?\nDo i need to install any driver?\nthank you for any answer!!\n/matteo\n\nA: I advice you to install Ubuntu 11.10 64bits. You'll get the most from your computer.\nInstalling additional drivers is very easy and will be automatically proposed after the installation if it is necessary. If you are used to Windows, Ubuntu should seem far easier on that point.\nIf you encounter any other problem in the future, feel free to ask here on Ask Ubuntu !\n\nA: First and foremost, the laptop seems capable of handling 64-bit, so I recommend using any 64-bit version that suits your needs.\nNow, Ubuntu currently has 2 widely supported versions: 11.10 and 10.04. both are about to be replaced by 12.04. But if you want the transition to 12.04 to be smooth, I highly recommend you use the 11.10 version.\nIf you want the most stable environment for your laptop, assuming you'll be doing all sorts of crazy stuff on it, use 10.04. But 11.10 is stable enough for laptops and I've used it for my own laptop for months now without unintentional mess-ups.\nSo yeah, I recommend 11.10. I couldn't find any specific details on your laptop regarding Ubuntu, so that's kind of disappointing. But I'll just assume it'll run well. Dell is known to run well with Linux, as far as I know.\n", "Q: Can Sound Juicer become faster or should I use another program? I'm shocked at how slow Sound Juicer rips audio CD's. My machine is an Intel i7 with 4Gb RAM, so I thought that ripping would take just a couple of minutes. But the program takes it's time and lasts about 20' for each CD.\nIs there a way to configure Sound Juicer to make better use of the available hardware?\nIs there another program available for faster ripping?\nThe DVD is a Super Multi DL Drive. I guess it's faster than single speed. No serious errors on the command line after the extraction starts. Before that, gtk errors and glib errors. Running it from the command line is much faster.\nWarnings on command line:\n\n(sound-juicer:1285): WARNING **: Widget (GtkEntry) has more than one label \n(sound-juicer:1285): GLib-GObject-WARNING **: invalid cast from GdkX11Window' to GtkWidget' \n(sound-juicer:1285): Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_widget_get_display: assertion GTK_IS_WIDGET (widget)' failed \n(sound-juicer:1285): Gdk-CRITICAL **: gdk_cursor_new_for_display: assertion GDK_IS_DISPLAY (display)' failed \n(sound-juicer:1285): Gdk-CRITICAL **: gdk_cursor_unref: assertion `cursor != NULL' failed \nI've monitored the system, and the memory use stays below 800Mb, also, the processors stay mostly below 20%.\nNow, if a CD has 700Mb max, wouldn't it be possible to read the smallest song (in bytes) into memory, start processing that with one thread, read the next smallest song into memory and spawn the next process, etc? \nWith 4Gb RAM, and 8 processors, the computer should not have any problem ripping and encoding 4 CD's in memory at the same time. Or should it?\ndd: reading `/dev/cdrom': Input/output error\n0+0 records in\n0+0 records out\n0 bytes (0 B) copied, 0.0258942 s, 0.0 kB/s\n\nreal    0m12.087s\nuser    0m0.000s\nsys 0m0.004s\n\n\nA: The reason extraction is so slow is because sound juicer uses cdparanoia, which was designed to read the disc multiple times in a very low level mode and perform complex software error correction to work around bugs that many drives commonly had, and any physical scratches on the disc.  I think these days most drives manage to do it correctly themselves, and so cdparanoia is no longer really needed.  There appears to be an open bug to have sound juicer stop using cdparanoia here:\nhttps://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=313302\nIt appears that sound-juicer has a gconf setting named paranoia where you can configure the paranoia settings.  Open gconf-editor and change the value to 0 and things go MUCH faster.\n\nA: I'd say no, your ripping speed is based on your hardware for the most part. The only thing your software is doing is reading, arranging, and checking the data that the cd/dvd drive is scanning.\n\nA: DVD write speed is a function of the drive and of the actual media. The media write speed for that particular media will be on the packaging, you can't do better than that. The achieved write speed is usually reported by the writing software so you can see if the advertised speed is achieved. Your drive is likely SATA which is capable of speeds faster than your drive can handle.\n", "Q: More HD space after ubuntu instalation I am a newby user with ubuntu 11.10, and I have instaled it with windows installer.

I recently built a barebones machine (shuttle SH67H3), installed Oneiric (64-bit) and everything was great (no wireless card but wired connection was fine). \nNow our router has changed locations and I'm trying to get wireless to work.

Anyone using 11.10 + usb wifi adapter? \n\nA: Run lsusb to make sure the machine recognizes the adapter and confirm the chipset. You should see the following on one of the lines:\n0cf3:9271 Atheros Communications, Inc.\n\nThe machine needs both the proper firmware and driver to utilize the adapter. Get the htc_9271.fm firmware file from here (I used version 1.3, get whatever is most recent) and copy it to the lib/firmware/ directory. Next, download the compat-wireless drivers here. Unarchive it and build the ath9k_htc driver by running the following commands in order:\ntar xvf compat-wireless-2.6.38.2-2.tar.bz2\ncd compat-wireless-2.6.38.2-2\n./scripts/driver-select ath9k_htc\nmake\nsudo make install \n\nLoad the driver\nsudo modprobe ath9k_htc\n\nIf this does not work (you should now see wireless networks available), try unplugging the adapter and reinserting it. Also, a reboot might help but could require reloading the driver with modprobe again. \n\nA: If you haveng trouble using BT in you VM, Do not use VM, see this link https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/9511?cversion=0&cnum_hist=2 \njust boot BT in your computer if you are using cd or usb, and then go to Wicd Network manager > Preferences > General Setting > on Wireless Interface type \"wlan0\" refresh Wicd. hope this will help you\n\nA: I had the same problem...bought the wifi usb card, dead as a doorknob in ubuntu.

My hunch is that it's stalling when trying to resolve your computer's IP address. If you have control over the SSH server to which you're connecting, you could add\nUseDNS no\n\nto /etc/ssh/sshd_config to bypass the DNS resolving step. Optionally (and IMHO better/safer, but not always feasible), add your computer's IP address to the server's /etc/hosts so it resolves more quickly.\nIf it's slow during the session, that would sound like a lower-level networking problem, you can use ping to the server to diagnose round-trip times and see if they are OK (anything above 100-200 ms is going to start feeling sluggish for interactive use -depends on how patient you are :) ).\n", "Q: Error message \"Requiring Clutter, version 1.0\" displayed and Gnome-Shell refuses to start I'm having some problems with gnome-shell.

The netbook is a  Packard Bell EasyNote XS with a 7-inch screen – It use to run Windows XP very badly but it runs Ubuntu quite well.\nI completed the 11.10 install several days ago and the only issue I have is that the screen resolution is not quite correct.  Ubuntu offers me two resolutions 800x480 and 720x480.  Unfortunately the 480 part of this means that many of the setup screens are missing their bottom 1 centimeter. This issue seemed irrelevant until I realized that the action buttons such as OK, Back, Forward appear in this part of the screen, actually doing the Ubuntu install turned out to be a little bit of a Hit and Miss affair and I had to guess my way through it by counting tabs to the invisible action buttons.\nThe  Packard Bell EasyNote XS  netbook originally came with the VIA Unichrome 614100361 screen driver installed as part of the original WindowsXP.

Often they have years of working with TeX, try MathType after working with it for 15 mins, and then claim that MathType is much slower. \nThey also assume because you can pick symbols and structures using the mouse to buuld an equation that you have to. MathType defines keyboard shortcuts for virtually everything and let's you redefine them according to your own scheme. They are much shorter than TeX's keywords so fewer keystrokes are required. Finally, if the user happens to know TeX for an expression, they can enter TeX language for most things.\nMany TeX people claim efficiency because they rely on a library of TeX macros they'be built up over time. This increases efficiency by taking advantage of the repetitiveness of most math. MathType has a roughly equivalent feature with its customizable toolbar. It can't do everything TeX macros can do but it has one big advantage over them. You can create them on the fly. Macros mostly require forethought since creating them takes one away from the task at hand. In MathType, if you see that a subexpression you have entered is going to be needed several times later, in the same equation or in subsequent equations, you just select and drag it to the toolbar. Later, when you need it, just click on the toolbar cell and it inserts the subexpression.\nMy company, Design Science, makes MathType so I am definitely biased. I will say that TeX does a wonderful job of formatting math. And I mean no disrespect to Donald Knuth and the TeX community in general.\n", "Q: How can I re-enable the global menu in Firefox? Until recently, Firefox on my machine used the standard Unity global menu. However, recently the menu is no longer global and, strangely, is centered. See this screenshot:\n\nfirefox-globalmenu is installed, the extension is enabled on the Add-ons page, and all other programs work as expected. Furthermore, the menu is as expected in a guest session.\nHere are the extensions I have enabled:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adblock Plus 2.0.3\n\n*AutoPager 0.7.1.2\n\n*Firebug 1.9.0\n\n*Flagfox 4.1.11\n\n*Global Menu Bar Integration 2.0.2\n\n*InstantFox 2.6.1\n\n*Searchbar Autosizer 1.5.7\n\n*Tab Scope 1.1.3\n\n*Ubuntu Firefox Modifications 1.0.2\n\n*United States English Spellchecker 5.0.1 (frequently fails to check spelling, allowing words like \"spekk\" and rejecting all contractions such as \"can't\")\n\n*Unity Integration for Firefox 0.2.4\n\n\nHow can I get the global menu back?\n(This is Ubuntu Oneiric [11.10] with Firefox 9.0.1.)\nUpdate\nI restarted in safe mode (all add-ons disabled). Here's what I saw (note that the only change is that the menubar is no longer centered):\n\nNext, I renamed ~/.mozilla to try a fresh profile. The problem was cured. However, I consider this to be an unacceptable solution since I have a lot of settings, add-ons, stored data, etc., etc. that would be lost with a fresh profile, only some of which is covered by Firefox Sync. A solution that involves lost data is no solution.\n\nA: With your old profile, could you simply disable all extensions and see if the problem goes away? (Somewhat like the safe mode you already tried.) Then, re-enable one extension at a time and see. (Obviously, the global menu bar extension shouldn't be disabled.)\nIf it's just a single extension (instead of some tricky \"synergism\"), you may be able to pin-point which one this way and then decide if you can live without it or have to endure the novelty of a centered global menu.\n\nA: Disable, in the Add-Ons manager, ALL of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adblock Plus 2.0.3\n\n*AutoPager 0.7.1.2\n\n*Firebug 1.9.0\n\n*Flagfox 4.1.11\n\n*InstantFox 2.6.1\n\n*Searchbar Autosizer 1.5.7\n\n*Tab Scope 1.1.3\n\n*Unity Integration for Firefox 0.2.4\n\n\nThen re-test, and enable one-at-a-time (or each in turn).\nNote: I run Firefox with several add-ons (but none on this list) with NO problems.\n", "Q: libnotify, PKG_CONFIG_PATH I am installing spidermonkey on Ubuntu 11.10.

E.g. to move the current window one workspace to the right, use Shift-Ctrl-Alt-Right.\nThe key-binding can be edited in Settings->Keyboard->Shortcuts->Navigation.\n\nA: On Ubuntu 12 and above you do this in Settings->Keyboard->Short cuts->Navigation\n\nA: Use gsettings not dconf, cf. https://kubos.cz/2018/07/19/ubuntu-18-workspaces-grid\ne.g.\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings move-to-workspace-right \"['<Shift><Ctrl><Alt>Right']\"\netc\n\nA: I am using a probably an old styled shortcut, which is indeed simple. \nI am using Desktop Wall instead of the Cube, which is awesome but I got tired of the cube, then I switched to Desktop Wall. Which features key bindings for \"Move within wall\", \"Move with window within wall\" and a few other. I have the default setup which includes Shift+Control+Alt+[Key] (left, right, etc.) in order to \"move\" the window to the desired wall. As shown here:\n\nThe Cube features the same binding options in the appropriate tab inside of the \"Rotate desktop cube\", which may be useful for you as you can define several combinations for your desired key bindings in order to move your windows to a specific Face (n) (of the cube).\n\nIf you are using more than a single horizontal workspace, then you probably have a 4 faces cube with dual workspaces, which means: only one cube, with selective workspace. This way, you can combine both the Desktop wall key bindings with the Rotate Cube key bindings in order to obtain the effect that you expect to.\nBut you should first check if the normal Shift+Control+Alt+[Key] (left, right, etc.) are doing the trick. Otherwise this workaround may be tricky for you. (not tested by me, I am not using the cube anymore).\nWARNING: The \"Move to another Workspace\" option in the context menu is simply dropping the window to the chosen workspace leaving you in the current workspace. The \"Move with window [...]\" will make you \"fly\" to the given workspace with the window.\nGood luck!\n\nA: I assume you are running Unity.

It had just appeared there after I did something on accident with another program trying to format my other partition\n\nA: That was likely either a Manufacturer's Recovery Partition (unlikely since you installed Linux over it and because it is in an extended partition)  \nMore likely it was being used as swap space, as that is traditionally stored as the last partition on a disk, and is often in an extended partition.\nTo turn it back into swap, first right click on the unallocated space and select \"New\" then change the \"File System:\" box to \"linux-swap\". Leave everything else alone. Apply the change, the right click it and select 'swapon'\nEdit: The 'swapon' is only until you shutdown, to make it permanent you need to edit /etc/fstab to include the uuid (long character string) from the output of ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid | grep /dev/sda5. You can do this with nano /etc/fstab (works just like a regular editor, press CTRL+X to save and quit.\n\nA: If GParted is saying that space is unallocated, then there is no partition covering that portion of the hard drive.  If it said \"unknown\" previously, then you most likely deleted a partition.\nAs for what might have been there, one possibility is that it was your swap partition.  One way to check this is to look for a reference in /etc/fstab (e.g. a comment like \"swap was on /dev/sda5 during installation\").\nIf this is the case, then you haven't lost any important data, but I would suggest recreating the swap partition since it lets you better utilise the resources on your computer.

I'm on Ubuntu 11.10 and I wanna know which version (OpenJDK or Sun's one or whatever) is the best to develop applications and use it with Eclipse, and how to install it.\nThank you.\n\nA: You can have various JDK side-by-side in the same machine. This is needed because sometimes you are on a 64-bit machine but need to run a specific 32-bit stuff. Also there are others JVM availables, some (open source): JamVM, Cacao, JatoVM. They are usually made for a specific niche and unfortunately are not complete as the reference JVM (from Sun/Oracle). The official JVM (from Oracle/Sun), due to it's completeness, is your best bet in almost all occasions.\nSince you pretend to develop Android applications I highly recommend using the Sun (Oracle) 1.7 i386 JDK.

Not only it's the official JVM but due to android not having a 64-bit SDK.\nThis link provides  a step-by-step installation of the Sun (Oracle) 1.7 JDK:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install Oracle Java JDK 7?\n\n*How do I install Java?\n\nA: OpenJDK or Sun's Oracle's JDK... it depends on what kind of applications you're going to develop.

I have a desktop with one md raid1 which is used for boot, and one large md raid5 for everything else. On top of the md raid5, I have LVM with vg-root, vg-swap and vg-home. \nMy idea is that I keep the raid1 with ext4 as boot and I won't convert the LVM at once. Instead, I'll create a new btrfs root on the raid5, create a fresh home directory, move over configs and bare necessities, and then move things over as I need them. That way, the size of the potential restore will increase as the likelihood of bugs decrease. Now the question is; how do I actually do that? :)\nI'm hoping for some expert advise here. \n\nA: FYI, you don't need a separate /boot partition on a raid1; grub2 can boot directly from lvm on raid5.\nIf your raid5 is partitioned and currently LVM is using /dev/md1p1 as the PV, then you can shrink the PV, shrink the partition, and create a new partition using the free space to use for btrfs.\nYou will need to use parted to shrink the lvm partition after using pvresize to have LVM release part of it.  You will need to have parted use sectors for the units and delete the LVM partition, and recreate it with the same start sector, but a shorter length.  This will require either that the partition not be in use ( do it from a livecd ), or will complain that it could not update the kernel, and you will have to reboot for it to take affect.\nAfter that, you can use gparted to create a new btrfs partition using the free space, then add it to /etc/fstab, mount it, and transfer some files.  To move more space, you will need to repeat the pvresize and parted shrink step, then use gparted to move the btrfs partition to the left, and expand.  This will take a long time because it has to copy all of the existing data in the btrfs partition.\nIt would be much easier, safer, and faster to simply create a new LV using whatever space is currently free in the VG, and format it with btrfs, then transfer some files, shrink an existing LV with resize2fs ( assuming it's ext4, and it will need to be unmounted to do this ) and lvresize, then add the space to the btrfs lv with lvresize, and tell btrfs to use the new space with btrfs filesystem resize max /path/to/btrfs-mount.\n", "Q: Help - Ubuntu creates a temp file for every file I edit \nPossible Duplicate:\nPrevent gedit from creating files with the '~' suffix \n\nI dont know how to explain it very well so I took a picture of it. \nIt seems that every time I edit a Text file and save it, the sistem makes a file with the changes or whatever next to the other file.

I installed Jupiter on Ubuntu 11.10 and set the preference mode to \"Power Saver\" but haven't seen any noticeable difference. Does it really do what it claims?\n\nA: In OMGUbuntu, WebUpd8 and I think Phoronix they have an article about how it helps with the power management. Also several users have actually reported saving battery time. This of course changes depending on the hardware and the usage. For example, setting the mode to Power Saver while playing an intensive game or doing something process/power hungry will eventually eat the battery.\nSome links about this are:\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2010/07/jupiter-ubuntu-ppa-hardware-and-power.html\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2010/06/jupiter-take-advantage-of-asus-super.html\nhttp://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/02/jupiter-awesome-netbook-powerconfig-applet/\nhttp://eeepc.net/jupiter-adds-power-management-to-linux-netbooks/\nBut some suggestion would be to read the comments in each of this links, check the Jupiter site here: http://www.jupiterapplet.org/ for updates and support. Jupiter might help many laptops, netbooks and small eee but might not do much to others depending on the way they handle the power management. Most users actually have good reviews.\nLastly there are some improvements in the last days in the source: http://sourceforge.net/projects/jupiter/\nwhich at least suggests it is still active and work is getting to it.\n\nA: Here is the link to an article writteb by the creator of Jupiter.\nThe myth of linux kernel regression\n\nA: I have to say one thing, I do not know how it works and the only feature that I know is advertized by all is \"saves battery\" but I have installed it on my desktop (to answer another question) and forgot about it.\nIt was still running with max battery when I was playing games on wine and I have noticed that the game frame rate was very low (really really low), I troubleshooted the only possible cause as being jupiter and moved the profile to max performace, frame rate jumped without any reboots or something.\nSo, yeah, I know this is not definitive proof but I will say it is somehow managing your CPU / GPU settings enough to get you some power saving. How much I cannot tell without measuring power consumption at the PSU, but it is doing something.\n\nA: In my experience, it works if you are utilising your CPU, but if you are like me, and just trying to stretch extra time out of note-taking with the backlight on low, then no it's not going to help. Alvar and Bruno are right, it limits your CPU and GPU to a certain multiplier cap, which is great if you are trying to get extra battery life from reasonable intensity usage, but again, won't help in bare minimum situations (text editing, writing).\n\nA: jupiter limits the amount of performance you van get out of your cpu/gpu. \nDoes it help? Well Jupiter uses some power to work, but it does limit your performance. So really the only way you can save even more power is to dim the display, spin down the hard drive when possible. \nBut also if you want to get more battery life, don't use so heavy programs. \nYou should also look in power management. \n", "Q: Installed ATI Driver but no effects I am newbie to Linux so I don't know if this is a proper question to ask.\nI installed my ATI Driver on Ubuntu 11 (Im using ATI Radeon HD 2600 XT) and since my system info shows \"Graphic: VESA: RV630\" everything's fine, I guess.

I'm currently reading \"Linux System programming - talking to the kernel and C library\".\n\n*Suggested reading material related to device driver debugging?\n\n\nThanks.\n\nA: *\n\n*Well, as a kernel engineer, I've found in general the best lessons I learned\nwere the hard ones. Where I was challenged to dig deep and find new and creative ways to debug an issue or solve a particular sticking point. The motivation for sticking with that really came from my invested interest in a particular sub-system. If you're not committed to seeing things through then just stop now, it's all hard, it's the intensity of the war stories that vary :).\n\n*You can best help out in an area you're motivated to sustain the effort. Ask yourself how close you want to get to the HW and continue from there. For example there's a lot less applied OS concepts in general device driver development vs greater resource management issues like memory management, IO writeback, process scheduling. Device drivers after all are about banging the firmware to get what you want and then adhering to the interface for that subsystem, there are so many comparable works that it makes it relatively easy to get started there. The drawback is, you're working with HW, which is always a net drag on development.\n\n*That's a userspace book, you won't need that anymore :-p. The kernel is a service driven framework, understanding the whole user/kernel interface to begin with isn't going to be very useful if you dive right into the driver development for example, as you'll be quite insulated from userspace. The Linux Device Drivers 3rd edition is freely available and is a great reference.\n\n*See link below. Though most importantly, just start somewhere and hang on. It's supposed to be hard, test your patience, and commitment. Since you don't really know what you're interested in, it's the lessons learned from these skirmishes that will shape your future engagements. If you can't even do that, then kernel hacking isn't for you.\nI would advise that you find a mentor that will challenge you and be there for you while you come up to speed. I haven't tried this myself, but this project might be a good start for you: http://kernelnewbies.org/KernelMentors.\nI also suggest you become familiar with the kernel trace frameworks out there like ftrace, perf, and systemtap.\nGood Luck!\n", "Q: Error in installing Virtualbox guest additions iso file mount I have install Virtualbox 4.0.4-OSE on my Ubuntu 11.04.\nI want to install the guest additions of Virtualbox. but I've gotten this error:\n Failed to open the CD/DVD image /home/bigbang/.VirtualBox/VBoxGuestAdditions_4.0.4.iso.\n The medium '/home/bigbang/.VirtualBox/VBoxGuestAdditions_4.0.4.iso' can't be used as the requested device type.\n\nThe step I do for install it is:\nDevices > Install Guest Additions , then click yes to download the required .iso file from the internet and then click mount button after the file is downloaded and then it gives me the error.\nEdited: My host is Ubuntu and the guest os is XP.\n\nA: To mount and use guest additions you first have to make sure virtualbox-guest-additions is installed and ready to use.

I have Lucid running pretty stable out of box on my dual core 3.0Ghz Pentium with 1GB of ram, so would it be pushing it to throw Gnome 3 on there?\n\nA: I have tried searching the Gnome.org web site to find an answer. I have tried a web search based on Gnome 3 requirements. I am surprised at the number of times that this or a similar question has been asked on the forums of various Linux distributions  and the same answer is always given. It is a quote from this page:\nGnome Myths\n\nIt is our primary focus to build a modern operating environment,\nplatform, and user experience. It doesn't make sense to target the\nhardware of the past. GNOME Shell uses relatively primitive 3D\ncapabilities that have been available from essentially all computing\ndevices made in the last four or five years. This includes most\ndesktop and laptop computers, mobile devices, phones, tablets, and\nnetbooks. Where there are exceptions, largely, there are bugs we can\nand should fix.\nSo, the official plan is that people can still use the GNOME 2 shell\nwith GNOME 3 applications and libraries, if necessary, but this is a\ntransitional state, and to get the GNOME 3 experience, your computer\nneeds hardware acceleration.\n\nSo, the answer from the official source is \"you need a computer built in the last 4 to 5 years and to get the Gnome 3 experience you need hardware acceleration.\" And that means a video card capable of doing accelerated graphics.\nPersonally, I would not call that quote a proper specification of hardware requirements for running Gnome 3. But there you are.\nIn your case if you do not intend to fit a video adapter then you will not be running gnome shell or any other user interface. And that is fine. So, the \"hardware acceleration\" requirement is not appropriate.\nMy machine is four years old and it has a slightly lower specification than your machine and it is running Gnome 3 with Ubuntu Unity both in 11.10 and 12.04 development branch in a more than adequate way.\nBut for completeness of answer I repeat my comment that the video card is the key component for running the User Interface on a Gnome 3 desktop environment be it Unity, or Gnome 3 shell. And a video card with anything less 512GB memory will give a disappointing performance unless used in fall-back mode.\nUpdate:\nI have found the release notes for 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot which is the first Ubuntu to be built on the Gnome 3 desktop environment.\n11.10 system requirements\nThe minimum memory for the desktop is 384MB. But this comment might be more applicable for you:\n\nThe minimum memory requirement for Ubuntu Server 11.10 is 128 MB of\nmemory.\n\nAgain for completeness I add this link:\nUnity Graphics requirements\nIf the video card is capable of doing this it is capable of running Unity and I would guess that it is also capable of running Gnome 3 shell:\nOpenGL Version required by Unity\nUnity requires OpenGL 1.4 of higher. Because of the decoupling between Opengl versions and the first implementation of new extensions by hardware vendors, just having OpenGL 1.4 is not enough. The system must also have support for a number of OpenGL extensions.\n\nOpenGL Extensions required\nFramebuffer Object\nRectangle Textures\nNon power of 2 textures\nVertex programs\nFragment programs\nbuffer objects\nGLSL shader support\n(Optional) Other requirements\nMinimum 128MB of video\nmemory Minimum texture width/height 2048\nEnough > registers for vertex and fragment shaders programs\n\nRegards.\n\nA: Two points:\n\n\n*\n\n*the Gnome Shell version available for 10.04 is 2.28, is that what you are looking for?\n\n*the documentation says it requires 3D acceleration. You should check if that works properly on your computer.\n\n\nThere might significant changes on user experience between that version and the latest one (3.2 or something like that). I don't know any backports of Gnome Shell 3.2 for lucid.\n\nA: The absolute simplest answer:\nRun 12.04 LTS beta live and find out if the new UI tweaks will hurt you.  It's not a perfect solution, but it's a lot easier than parsing requirements for days.  \nIt's not exactly just Gnome 3, but unity AFAIK is based on Gnome 3.  If you can run one well from live, you should be able to run the other.\n", "Q: How can I set my system to suspend when inactive to a longer amount of time I run Mythtv on some Ubuntu 11.10 based machines.\nIn the power settings, I can choose from a list of time periods from 5 minutes up to 1 hour for the the machine to suspend when inactive.  I would like to set the suspend to occur at a longer interval, like 2 hours or 4.\nPreviously with Gnome, I would think that I could go into the gconf editor and find the key there, I am not sure with Unity where to override a setting like this.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: You can try with dconf-editor. If you don't find it install it with\nsudo apt-get install dconf-tools\n\nthen run it searching for dconf Editor in Dash or typing dconf-editor from the alt+f2 command line. The power settings are stored in\norg → gnome → settings-daemon → plugins → power\n\nTo set the timeout when plugged in change the sleep-inactive-ac-timeout option, to set the timeout when on battery change sleep-inactive-battery-timeout. \nThese options are indicated in waiting seconds before suspend (so a value of 14400 will suspend the system after 4 hours).\n\n", "Q: How to avoid updating some packages \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to prevent updating of a specific package? \n\nWhen using Ubuntu at work I have to untick Facebook and Twitter plugins for Gwibber every time the Update Manager starts (I get 403 - Forbidden). \nIs there a way to tell the Update Manager to stop looking for these updates without removing Gwibber?\n\nA: What you want is called Pinning: and can done in several ways. From the link...\n\nIntroduction to Holding Packages\nHolding a package basically means you're telling the package manager to keep the current version no matter what.

The installer never found any other disks other than the USB drive. Tried everything that I could find posted as viable solutions in the interwebs:\n\n*\n\n*Disabling Windows fast boot (and hibernation).\n\n*Disabling secure boot from BIOS.\n\n*Changing SATA settings to ACHI.\n\n*Removing Linux partitions (along all of my personal data) using tools in Windows.\n\n...until I decided to run a BIOS update in Windows. That finally did the trick.\n\nA: Some SATA ports have different controllers on the motherboard. Often times these extra ports are for eSATA, SATA3, SATA6, etc. When these ports are operating in new-ish modes then it is possible that Ubuntu wont understand how to use them. Switching SATA ports and changing the modes to the most universal often solves these types of problems.\n\nA: Just for others who might stumble upon this, I had the same problem but it was due to my apple raid card. I had to remove it, unplug the iPass cable and plug it in the motherboard instead, and make sure I was using a SATA HDD (and not a SAS HDD), and i finally got the ubuntu installer to recognize the HDD.\n\nA: As workaround I went in the BIOS and set the SATA Mode to \"IDE\" and the SATA3 Mode to \"AHCI\". After doing this the installer did detect the hard drive and installed Ubuntu alongside the other operating system.\nI called it a workaround and not a fix because the other operating system won't load with the SATA3 Mode set to AHCI, so every time I need to switch OS I am forced to go in the BIOS and change the SATA3 Mode.\nAnother problem I had after applying the workaround was that the boot loader didn't show up on the next boot but the other operating started booting without any prompt. I've fixed this other problem by identifying the Ubuntu partition with:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\n(which was sda6) and then running:\nsudo mount /dev/sda6 /mnt\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt/ /dev/sda\n\n\nA: I have exactly the same problem. I have the same ASRock motherboard and I tried different Linux distros without success. Finally Ubuntu 12.10 live usb booted correctly but my hard drive wasn't read.\nThe solution for me was to switch SATA connector:\nThe hard disk was connected to the SATA3_0 connector and I switch it to one of the SATA2 connectors (SATA2_1 to be exact). It works now. I didn't check if Windows (which is installed in a partition of that disk) complains about this.\n\nA: I had the problem with a brand new laptop. I had to turn RAID off (wasn't using RAID anyways) by the solution from here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run MSCONFIG\n\n*Enable Safe Boot (minimal)\n\n*Reboot into UEFI/BIOS and change to AHCI\n\n*Boot up into safe mode\n\n*Run MSCONFIG and disable Safe Boot.\n\n*Reboot\n\n\nInternal HDD detection works after that.\n", "Q: boot files Ubuntu 11.10 If I want to start the boot process, what file do I point to?  I have Ubuntu 11.10 installed on a separate disk from openSuse 12.1 and windows 7.  When I installed Ubuntu, I had to reinstall the OpenSuse to boot it and windows.  Using OpenSuse boot loader, I can't seem to get the boot menu configured to start Ubuntu.  I understand my problem is with the OpenSuse boot loader not being configured correctly.  As a newbie I don't really understand the boot process of a linux system.\n\nA: OpenSuse uses the Grub BootLoader. (A Boot Loader is a program that the BIOS looks for when the computer turns on, it is always located in the first 446 bytes of the hard drive). Grub then makes the filesystems of Ubuntu, OpenSuse, and Windows 7 available and looks to a file called /boot/grub/grub.cfg which tells it what operating systems are on the computer and how to boot them.\nThe Complex answer\nHere is and example of a grub.cfg file. This is what an entry for Ubuntu looks like:\n### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/12_os-prober ###\nmenuentry \"Ubuntu 11.10 (11.10) (on /dev/sda2)\" --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os {\n    insmod part_msdos\n    insmod ext2\n    set root='(hd0,msdos1)'\n    search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root 3582d70f-f4a5-484c-b14c-45cd740346b9\n    linux /vmlinuz-3.0.0-12-generic root=/dev/sda2\n    initrd /initrd.img-3.0.0-12-generic\n}\n\nThe insmod part_msdos line tells grub to learn how to read MBR partition tables\nThe insmod ext2 line tells grub to learn how to read ext2/3/4 filesystems\nThe set root='(hd0,msdos1)' line tells grub that /boot is located on HDD #0, Partition 1\nThe search ... line tells grub to look at Ubuntu's partition for files\nThe linux /vmlinuz-3.... line tells grub that the Ubuntu Kernel is named that, on /dev/sda2\nThe initrd ... line tells grub where to look for the boot image.\nThe Simple Answer\nBoot into OpenSuse and run the following:\nsudo find / -name \"grub.cfg\"\nsudo grub-mkconfig -o /file/found/in/above/command/grub.cfg\n\nThe first command will find the grub.cfg on your drive, probably at /boot. The second tells grub to look around for new operating systems and install them to the file you found above.\n", "Q: What happened to Firefox browse by name service in location bar?

Are this supported on Ubuntu 11.10 or 12.04. If not, what or how will Ubuntu run while using this type of hardware.\nThe last article I read about this was in Phoronix but it was almost a year ago: http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=OTIxOQ (Would be good if they made an updated one for 12.04)\nI only use the PC right now for making small videos, visiting askubuntu 50 times a day and\nmaybe playing l4d2, web programming and using virtualbox.\n\nA: No is the short answer for linux support of the Virtu GPU Virtualization by Lucid. \nIf you look on the Phoronix forums you will find many references to the lack of support with linux, notably this apparent response from Lucid themselves. This is more than likely due to the lack of high end games available for linux in the first place - it also apparently has poor performance on a Windows environment and for the extra cost may not be worth the effort.\nWhat will this mean for the motherboard to be supported under Ubuntu? I'm not sure but my guess would be the built in chip will be able to be disabled in bios so it is likely to allow the board to be used.\nAs this technology is for improved gaming performance and your primary use in Ubuntu is not really about gaming my recommendation would be to look into a different motherboard unless you will be dual booting with Windows and gaming with it.  \n\nA: You could also try to use something like longene 0.4 beta Ubuntu package, which allows running Windows kernel mode hardware drivers (limited to Windows binaries) on Linux.\n", "Q: how to launch grub menu for ubuntu guests in virtualbox?

(e.g. Skype, Eclipse, Opera, etc..)\n\nA: Could be any number of reasons, depends on the user and source.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open source. The packages in the Ubuntu repositories are open source. The others you mentioned may be packaged in a .deb, but not open source.\n\n*Patches. The kernel comes to mind here, you can download a kernel from several locations, but it may not have the Ubuntu patches.\n\n*Compatibility. Just because it is a .deb does not mean it will be compatible with Ubuntu.\n\n*Quality. This overlaps with #3 - one can convert a rpm -> deb with alien for example, but where is the quality control ?\n\n*Trust - This depends on your personal paranoia threshold. There are users with enough paranoia not to trust even the Ubuntu repositories. Others trust Ubuntu, but not a closed source binary blob.\n\n*Support. You will get minimal or no support from Ubuntu on .deb from elsewhere. Less with the closed source blobs (it varies with popularity of the product).\nMy general advice is that if is in the repositories, you are going to be better off using the Ubuntu repositories.\nIf not, IMO, you are better off compiling from source. Implied in doing so is at least some cursory review of the code. yes it is unrealistic to expect end users be able to jump in and start reviewing source code, but nothing wrong with getting a start. You will pick up on major problems (the code will not compile) off the bat.\nIf the source code is not available, and all you have is a .deb it comes down to trust.\n", "Q: Can I get Ubuntu One to automatically download and sync a folder?

If I remove it and add Unity again for some reason, I dont want the applet installed again. How can I prevent it from being installed? (or the global menu, java versions removing my custom installed one, etc... you get the idea).\n\nA: *\n\n*Is there any way to \"blacklist\" a package from being installed even as a dependency of another?\n\n\nTo prevent apt from installing a package foo, add a stanza for that package to the file /etc/apt/preferences which looks like the following.\nPackage: foo\nPin: release *\nPin-Priority: -1\n\nThis will prevent apt from installing foo and will also prevent apt from installing anything that Depends on foo.\nThe next closest thing I can think of is to put a hold on foo at its current version which prevents foo from being upgraded (unless dpkg is given the --force-hold option or unless apt overrides the hold). To put a hold on package foo, do the following.\necho foo hold | sudo dpkg --set-selections\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I overcome the fact that it is a dependency and still be able to upgrade my system?\n\n\nYou can install individual packages despite dependency violations using dpkg --force-depends.

I'm pretty sure I remember using something of the sort in the distant past...\n\nA: The Ubuntu Install Disk is a 'Boot Disk' in the sense that you can get into a working environment to fix whatever is causing the system to not boot. Ubuntu can be installed from Optical media by burning the ISOs to a disk in any operating system. Live USB installers can be made from Ubuntu with the Startup Disk Creator program and an ISO image. USB installers can be made from Windows by following the guide here, called the Universal USB Installer. \nIf you want to actually be in the environment of your brokenn installation,  you can press 'c' for Command Line during the Grub menu and can manually setup a new entry or press 'e' for edit on any of the existing entries and change it so it will boot again.\n", "Q: How to check needed power supply for my PC? I want to buy UPS, but don't know parameters. How i can check my hardware for it?\n\nA: If you want a real accurate measurement of power consumption, you need to measure actual current draw from the power supply with a tool like a WattsUp, while the system is under maximum load.\nOptionally, just look at your power supply's wattage (e.g. 600 watts), add the wattage of all the stuff you also want on the UPS (screen, speakers, and so on) and buy a UPS that can handle slightly more than that. UPS are normally rated in VA (Volt Amperes) rather than watts but for this purpose they should be close enough. For instance if the total wattage from your appliances is  850 watts, a 1000-VA UPS should have you covered.\n", "Q: How to remove duplicate in Nautilus devices list?

The problem lies with the fstab entry of the drive.\nStrangely enough, if the drive is mounted with UUID= it is shown twice in the devices list.

Can someone give me the line of code I need to  update every track with a given value (ex. year=85) to a certain play count number (ex. play count= 5).\n\nA: Certainly.\nOnce you have sqlitebrowser installed and connected (see Manually set track listen count in Banshee?), go over to the 'Execute SQL' tab and run something like:\nUPDATE coretracks SET playcount = [__] WHERE [field] = [value] AND [field2] LIKE [value2];\n\nexample:\nUPDATE coretracks SET playcount = 10 WHERE title LIKE '%Bach%';\n\nYou can get a list of the fields that are available by clicking the + next to 'CoreTrack' on the 'Database Structure' tab.\nIf you are not familiar with the SQL language, the above statement is saying: update make a change coretracks to the table named CoreTracks.  Change each row where title has a value that contains Bach.  The change to make is to change the playcount field to a value of 10.  If you have something specific in mind, I'd be happy to help with the SQL.  Put a comment below.\n\nA: Here's my solution: \nStep 1: MP3's have a \"BPM\" tag that I find virtually useless (who's in the mood for songs at 117 BPM only?)  Anywho, in iTunes/Rhythmbox/whatever you're importing from, sort your songs by play count, select all that have play count X, and change the BPM to X. Rinse and repeat.\nStep 2: Use SQLite Library Browser (as above), but this time, in the \"Execute SQL\" tab,  type \nUPDATE coretracks SET playcount='1' WHERE BPM='1'\n\nAgain, simply rinse and repeat.  \nI recently did this for my 15,000 song library.  Step 1 took about 30 minutes, but Step 2 took about 30 seconds.

I am aware that something called Zeitgeist is used to determine the \"Most Frequently Used\" part of the unity dashboard, but i was wondering what the specifics where. I know the amount of applications in this section varies, so it's not as simple as the # with the most uses today.\nIs there any (relatively) simple way of expressing the rules which dictate the listing and ranking of Most Frequently Used?\n\nA: Basic answer\nSimply put, the Most Frequently Used scope sorts applications by the number of times you've launched them. That is to say, if you've launched Firefox 1000 times, and Chromium 999 times, Firefox will be listed first. Even if you haven't launched Firefox in months and months.\nTechnical answer\nSimply put, the Most Frequently Used scope is a wrapper that searches a Zeitgeist.Index of installed applications with a result type of MostPopularSubjects. Zeitgeist measures this popularity with the zeitgeist-datahub daemon, which notices and updates its statistics each time you launch an application. You can look at the relevant lens code here, and the API documentation for Zeitgeist here.\nHaving looked at the current Zeitgeist code, it appears MostPopularSubjects is a simple sort by number of accesses. Additionally, given the same number of application accesses, the applications are sorted by newest first. It's a little more complex than this, but the SQL generated for a Most Frequently Used request is more-or-less:\nSELECT\n  subj_id,\n  MAX(timestamp) as timestamp,\n  COUNT(subj_id) as num_events\nFROM\n  event_view\nGROUP BY\n  subj_id\nORDER BY\n  num_events DESC\n  timestamp DESC\n\nIsn't open source beautiful?\n", "Q: How to resolve problem with two versions of Google Earth installed from different sources?  both I installed Google Earth 6.1 several months ago. I've just install GE 6.2 this evening by downloading the .deb package on the Google site. After the download, GE installed fine with the Software Center. I found GE 6.2 with the Unity lens and drag + drop on the Unity launcher. GE opens and seems to work fine.\nBut the issue is that I still have 6.1 on my computer, I thought it had been upgraded automatically to 6.2. I can find 6.1 on the software center as it says it is installed, but I can't find any 6.2. I open synaptic and can find 6.1 but not 6.2.\nSo my questions are: How do I uninstall 6.1 without breaking 6.2? Why is there no trace of 6.2 on my machine? Where is 6.2 installed on my hard drive, as 6.1 is on my home/.googleearth directory?\nFirst thanks to everyone for taking time to answer.\nSynaptic is already in my computer and I can now understand as I see the 2 packages related to Google Earth.   \nGE 6.2 is in a package called google-earth-stable and the older version is in a package called googleearth (see attached picture). What I still don't understand is that in Unity's Dash Menu I can see google-earth-stable and googleearth but in the Install Software tab of the Software Center, I can't see any trace of google-earth-stable installation or googleearth? Perhaps this is because there are not Software but packages?\nhttp://ubuntuone.com/06x7QZoWJXPE72Ceo5XCU7 \nCan I safely unistall googleearth without braking google-earth-stable via the Software Center?\nAlso I saw that in the snapshot that googleearth (older, v. 6.1) has a version of 6.0.3.2197+0.6.0-1 and the google-earth-stable (newer, v. 6.2) has a version of 6.1.0.5001-r0. Why is it that the product version numbers don't match the packge version numbers?\n\nA: Because you downloaded the .debs directly from Google the Ubuntu Software Center doesn't have a \"Repository\" available to check version information against. Repositories are a nice way of keeping everything well organized and have the benefit of automagically updating things. Repositories organize software into what are called packages, and these all have a unique name.\nIt is possible that Google gave the new version of google earth a new name, thus allowing them to both be on your computer at the same time, even if one overwrote most of the files from the other (or was prevented from doing so because of the existing package).\nThe easiest way to sort this all out is to see what packages are installed on your computer. Since newer versions of Ubuntu don't have synaptic installed by default you can either do option A, which requires no new software to be installed. Or option B which requires a painless install of synaptic.\nPress Control+Shift+T to open a terminal\nOption A\nRun this, then copy and paste the results into your question (use four spaces to indent each line):\nsudo dpkg -l | grep -i google\n\nThis lists all the packages installed on the computer (dpkg -l) and then filters out all the ones that don't have the word Google in them (grep -i google). The sudo gives you super-user/root privileges and the pipe | feeds the output of one command into the input for the second.\nOption B\nRun this: sudo apt-get install synaptic. This installs the synpatic package which will allow you to see and install packages without having to use a command line (I prefer them really). There is a search box near the top, plug in 'google' and then maximize the window. Screen shot the results, get them online, and link to them in your question.\n", "Q: Can't get Unity 3D to work in 11.10 I recently upgraded to 11.10 on my Lenovo ThinkPad T520, and I'm not able to load Unity 3D (I'm not selecting 2D at login menu either).  \nme@mycomp:~$ echo $DESKTOP_SESSION\nubuntu-2d\n\n\nI ran the unity support test below as well.  \nme@mycomp:~$ /usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p\nXlib:  extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0.0\".\nXlib:  extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0.0\".\nXlib:  extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0.0\".\nError: unable to create the OpenGL context\n\n\nAnd it looks like I only have one graphics card:\nme@mycomp:~$ lspci | grep VGA\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 2nd Generation Core Processor Family Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 09)\n\n\nAlso, Ubuntu lists nothing under the \"Additional Drivers\" window.  \nAny help would be extremely appreciated as I'm somewhat of a noob.

I will soon have a PC that can handle up to 32GB of RAM (Yeah my dream comes true) but I would like to know, because this is the first time I am jumping the 4GB boundary on a home computer, how much performance increase and general benefit will I have if I use 8GB, 16GB or 32GB for the system. Apart from the huge jump in price I want to see if it's worth buying more memory for Ubuntu, in this case 11.10 but soon 12.04 and how much of a difference it will be.\nI will be using the 64Bit version of 11.10 for normal activities like:\n\n\n*\n\n*OpenOffice (Max 6 documents opened)\n\n*Browsing with Firefox/Chrome (More than 10 tabs opened)\n\n*Listening to Banshee\n\n*Wine and some games \n\n*Virtualbox (Win XP, Win 7, Ubuntu)\n\n*Compiling from github like there is no tomorrow\n\n*Downloading with torrent app\n\n*Using Gimp and Inscape + Sozi\n\n*Using Openshot/Pitivi\n\n*Using Subdownloader for movies\n...\n\n\nA: More RAM never hurts, of course, but unless you will be doing some very resource-intensive operations you will probably rarely need more than 4GB of RAM.  Of those things you mentioned, the ones likely to demand the highest use of memory will possibly be games, Gimp and Inkscape, and possibly Openshot and Pitivi, but even here it depends on what you'll be doing.  If you do professional editing of graphics, though, some more RAM might help.  For my own needs, I've never used all of 4GB, and yet I'd still like to have 8GB, just in case.\nOn the other hand, if it's your \"dream machine,\" buying with the future in mind is a good idea.  We've all watched over the years as OSes and programs increasingly demand greater resources.  If you buy a large amount of RAM right now you might not use it for a long time, but eventually you'll probably be glad you bought it.\nWith that in mind, to make sure your computer is still your dream machine after several years, I'd make sure also to get the fastest CPU possible and lots and lots of storage.  A great graphics card is a must, too.  But I'm sure you've already considered all of that.\n\nA: Unless you are going to use something such as Virtualization (with several guests) I seriously doubt you will use more then 4 Gb.\nAs you probably know, you can watch your RAM use with top or free -m or one of the graphical tools.\nI suggest you start with 4 Gb and add an additional 2-4 if you are using swap (with 4 Gb).\n\nA: For GIMP (many large images open), fluid Openshot/Pitivi and some VMs you can't have enough RAM. \nMy workstation for example has 'just' 8 GiB and I have constantly 2 or 3 VMs open (each 1024 - 2048) and Java applications (Eclipse / Intellij) running, FF and Chrome with multiple tabs and several Flash applications open and just scratch the 6/7GiB mark.\n", "Q: How to set svn info response/call result language?

I have noticed so keyboard/mouse hanging and other issues since I bought my new computer and installed Ubuntu 11.10. \nI researched where increasing the /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail helps and it does.\nCurrently I do this by running  $ ls -R / in a terminal. Of course this just reads the directory and files.\nIt does in fact raise it to 4000 plus. Then it drops back down to 300 and 400.\nAfter looking and trying to find a solution, how can I increase the entrophy_avail without manually LSing the hard drives from the terminal?\nI must confess that I have been using Ubuntu full time since 8.04 and Windows completely free since Natty. I don't really understand this entropy_avail but my computer seems to do better when it is high at peak usage.  \n\nA: I have the same issue. I found haveged works the best. Simply run\nsudo apt-get install haveged -y\nand you are done. It will start itself and add entries to start on boot.\n\nA: This article here seems to have found a package that will essentially feed the random number generator with the output of the random number generator... essentially generating as much random as you need at the cost of have 'less random' numbers.\nThe reason that ls -R / works is because the primary source of random bits in linux is hardware noise. ls'ing the whole filesystem generates a lot of that.\nThe instructions from the other article are reproduced here:\nsudo apt-get install rng-tools\nsudo vim /etc/default/rng-tools\n#Set the value: HRNGDEVICE=/dev/urandom\nsudo /etc/init.d/rng-tools start\n\n\nA: Try using\nrngd -r /dev/urandom -o /dev/random -b -t 1\n\nThis worked for me.\n\nA: Increasing the avilible entropy pool gives more cryptographic random data for things like gpg and openssl to generate encryption keys.  The keyboard and mouse do not know or care how much entropy is available, and a lack of entropy should not cause anything to hang other than generating new cryptography keys.  In fact, normal use of the keyboard and mouse add to the entropy pool.\n", "Q: How to I install on an HTC Shift?

You can get a wireless card (usb or internal) that works with Linux for 10-20. With the price dropping, I usually purchase a new wireless.\nAt any rate, I have no experience with your card, but to get it working you will likely need to download the firmware and build a custom kernel.\nThese pages have the background information you will need:\nhttp://labs.igep.es/index.php/How_to_setup_Marvell_88w8686_SDIO_wifi\nhttp://wiki.laptop.org/go/Libertas\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile\nThe fact that these cards work with OLPC is very encouraging, not sure if the firmware alone will be sufficient or if you will need to read the third link and compile a kernel.\nWish I could give a better answer,but without experience with this card that was the best I could do for you.\nPerhaps someone with experience with that card will post a detailed walk thorough.\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu have any comic/anime/manga/series about it?

This is because a standard user will have certain processes running on the background (like Xorg), no matter whether it is active or not, which consumes memory. \nLogging out users that are unnecessary for your current work is recommended if you are low on resources or running processes that are very resource-intensive like compiling or playing a video game.\nAnother benefit to logging out users who don't need to be logged in is that it ensures you end any process that could be interfering with operations by another user. For example, if one user has a Nautilus window open for a volume that is not really being used, others users will not be able to unmount the volume (unless they use sudo and kill the Nautilus process, which is sort of like logging that user out, but way uglier).\n", "Q: Should I install 32 or 64 bit Ubuntu \nPossible Duplicate:\nDifference between 32bit and 64 bit? \n\nMy computer is a gateway nv55s17 with a 64 bit processor.

Lenses have a search_in_global property that is set to a boolean value. It is possible that you can connect to the session DBus and set the property yourself, but I haven't tried that. If you're interested, you can use D-Feet to explore the session bus.  \n", "Q: SSH between 2 PCs I've successfully managed to setup SSH server individually on 2 PCs(master and slave setup).\nI can login from the slave to the master but the vice versa isn't happening.\nFrom he individual PCs I can login to the localhost also.\nCan someone help me out? I've disabled the firewalls and tried everything. Should I provide more specific details regd this?\nI've installed the openssh-server on both PCs already. And I'm using the above mentioned syntax. Also, the error message I'm getting is:\n\nssh uname@10.5.10.251 ssh: connect to host 10.5.10.251 port 22: Connection refused\n\nWhereas this works perfectly fine when I ssh from the slave.\nOn trying ssh -v I get:\n\nOpenSSH_5.8p1 Debian-7ubuntu1, OpenSSL 1.0.0e 6 Sep 2011\ndebug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config\ndebug1: Applying options for *\ndebug1: Connecting to 10.5.10.251 [10.5.10.251] port 22.\ndebug1: connect to address 10.5.10.251 port 22: Connection refused\nssh: connect to host 10.5.10.251 port 22: Connection refused\n\nAnd pinging the slave from master works fine. This means that master is able to reach slave, right? Also, I've disabled the firewall on the slave using the UI.\n\nA: If you have installed SSH servers through apt-get via $ apt-get install openssh-server on both servers, you should be able to access them both ways with their respective IP addresses.\nIf you have only on one PC a SSH server, and you try the other one without a SSH server, it will obviously not work.\nAlso be sure to respect the target machine's username you try to connect with: $ ssh username@192.168.1.245.\n", "Q: Why am I not able to send an email from command line This is what I did (as per a few discussions on this website)\nmail -s \"hi\" addressee@email.xyz < test.txt\nWhere text.txt has the message.\nI checked to see if mail did exist and it does at /usr/bin/mail\nWhat am I missing? Is there a daemon that must be running? Is there more to this?\nI am running Ubuntu 11.10\n\nA: You need to install several packages namely as follows\n postfix mailutils libsasl2-2 ca-certificates libsasl2-modules\n\nthese packages are required for the proper setup of mail sending.\nHere is a proper way of setting this up and testing out by sending mail and the possible troubleshooting.\nHope this helps :)\n\nA: You will need to install a mail transfer agent.  I would suggest Postfix, since it is widely used and has a good security record:\nsudo apt-get install postfix\n\nYou should be asked a few questions about how you want to configure Postfix.  If your ISP requires you to send email via their SMTP server, choose the \"Satelite system\" option and enter their SMTP server as the relay host.  Otherwise, the \"Internet site\" option is probably best.\nWith that set up, the mail command line tool should be able to deliver email (along with anything else that relies on the /usr/lib/sendmail API).\n", "Q: Easy way to setup vpn server/client? I have root access on a server and I can access my server through ssh and my server and my laptop run ubuntu. What's the easiest way to setup vpn server/client such that when I connect the vpn all of internet connections go through the server?\n\nA: *\n\n*If you just want to tunnel HTTP traffic through the VPN, one of the easiest solutions would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set up a Squid proxy on the server and configure it to accept only connections from localhost. See this article from Ubuntu community wiki.\n\n*On the client: tunnel the remote proxy port (by default 3128) to a local port through ssh:\nssh -L 3128:localhost:3128 PROXYSERVERNAME\n\n*Configure your browser to use localhost:3128 as a proxy\n\n\n*If you want all of your traffic to go through the VPN, a solution would be to setup OpenVPN on the server side and the use the OpenVPN Network Manager Plugin on the client to setup a connection to the server. By default, OpenVPN configured through the NetworkManager tries to tunnel all traffic through the VPN. See another article from Ubuntu community wiki.\n\nA: I found shadowproxy super easy to use http://shadowsocks.org/en/index.html They have clients for a variety of operating systems as well.\n", "Q: Does 'Unredirect fullscreen Windows' option in compiz improve performance for video playback? I found this option in CCSM. It's unchecked by default. There's a tooltip explaining that it allows drawing on fullscreen windows to not be redirected to offscreen pixmaps.\n\nA: This option causes drawing to occur directly on the screen rather than drawing off-screen and then copying the drawn content back onto the screen.\nThus, yes it can dramatically improve graphical performance.\nHowever there can be a draw-back - on some graphics cards/monitors - using this option can result in dramatic flickering.  Particularly - this flickering effect can occur on full-screen apps.\nThus - its work experimenting, but if you see flickering, its best not to use.\nRemember using CCSM can break your desktop.\nIf you want to toggle this value, you can use:\ngconftool-2 --set /apps/compizconfig-1/profiles/Default/plugins/composite/screen0/options/unredirect_fullscreen_windows --type bool 0\n\nChange 0 for 1 to switch this option back-on.\n\nA: If you use the Nvidia proprietary drivers, it is very important to unredirect fullscreen windows, otherwise XVideo will not use sync to vblank and you will see tearing while playing videos. The Nvidia driver manual says:\n\nNote that the Xv adaptors will ignore the sync-to-vblank option when drawing into a redirected window.\n\n", "Q: Skype EULA pops up at every startup Everytime I boot my computer, Skype starts automatically after login.

It's been like that for a while, but I can't pinpoint when it started exactly.\n\nA: I was having the same problem, Skype was forcing my to re-accept EULA and was forgetting my settings e.g. whether I wanted pop-ups or not.\nThe EULA problem was corrected by removing the shared.xml in the .Skype folder:\n$ cd ~/.Skype\n$ rm shared.xml\n\nThe settings problem was corrected by removing the config.xml in my user's folder under .Skype e.g. if my user is pinocchio\n$ cd ~/.Skype/pinocchio\n$ rm config.xml\n\nRestarted Skype all is well with the world again.\n\nA: Skype holds its settings in a hidden folder ~/.Skype.\nPossibly you have the wrong permissions or possible corruption in the files the application uses.\nTry renaming this folder.  Then re-add your login details and retest closing and reopening the application.\nIn a terminal\nmv ~/.Skype ~/.Skype_backup\n\n\nA: I had the same issue, the problem was that config.xml was owned by root.\nThe solution was easy : \nsudo chown user:user ~/.Skype\n\nchange user to your login name (you can find it by typing :\necho $USERNAME\n\n", "Q: How to make a jar file run on startup & and when you log out? I have no idea where to start looking.

I'm not sure this is possible, but most of the time I'm logged out, and I still want to it crawl.\n\n\nAny ideas? Can someone point me in the right direction?\nJust looking for the simplest solution.\n\nA: Yes! It is possible. :) Upstart is the way to go to make sure the service stays running. It has five packages, all installed by default:\n\n\n*\n\n*Upstart init daemon and initctl utility\n\n*upstart-logd provides the logd daemon and job definition file for logd service\n\n*upstart-compat-sysv provides job definition files for the rc tasks and the reboot, runlevel, shutdown, and telinit tools that provide compatibility with SysVinit\n\n*startup-tasks provides job definition files for system startup tasks\n\n*system-services provides job definition files for tty services\n\n\nThe learning is very enjoyable and well worth it. Upstart has a website: http://upstart.ubuntu.com/ \n\nA: Here's a easy way to do that using SysVInit. Instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create the start and the stop script of your application. Put it on some directory, in our example is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start Script: /usr/local/bin/myapp-start.sh\n\n*Stop Script: /usr/local/bin/myapp-stop.sh\nEach one will provide the instructions to run/stop the app. For instance the myapp-start.sh content can be as simple as the following: \n#!/bin/bash\n\njava -jar myapp.jar \n\nFor the stop script it can be something like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n# Grabs and kill a process from the pidlist that has the word myapp\n\npid=`ps aux | grep myapp | awk '{print $2}'`\nkill -9 $pid\n\n\n*Create the following script (myscript) and put it on /etc/init.d.\n/etc/init.d/myscript content:\n#!/bin/bash\n# MyApp\n#\n# description: bla bla\n\ncase $1 in\n    start)\n        /bin/bash /usr/local/bin/myapp-start.sh\n    ;;\n    stop)\n        /bin/bash /usr/local/bin/myapp-stop.sh\n    ;;\n    restart)\n        /bin/bash /usr/local/bin/myapp-stop.sh\n        /bin/bash /usr/local/bin/myapp-start.sh\n    ;;\nesac\nexit 0\n\n\n*Put the script to start with the system (using SysV). Just run the following command (as root):\nupdate-rc.d myscript defaults \n\nPS: I know that Upstart is great and bla bla, but I preffer the old SysV init system.\n\nA: 3 quick suggestions...\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a Start script in /etc/rc3.d (multiuser console mode) with corresponding Kill scripts in /etc/rc.0 and /etc/rc6.d to kill your Java program in a controlled way when the system powers down (runevel 0) or reboots (runlevel 6) See An introduction to Runlevels.\nYou might be able to start your Java app in runlevel 2 (rc2.d) but, as a crawler, it will need TCP/IP. So make sure your networking service is available/started in your runlevel 2 beforehand. Networking is definitely up in runlevel 3.\n/etc/init.d contains all the actual start/kill scripts. /etc/rcN.d directories just contain links to them, prefixed with S or K to start or kill them respectively, per runlevel N.\n\n*A process run by crond should persist between logouts. Maybe add it to your crontab. \n\n*A process run with nohup should also persist. See nohup: run a command even after you logout.\n$ nohup java -jar myapp.jar &\n\nBy default, myapp.jar's standard output will go to a file named ./nohup.out, or $HOME/nohup.out if the former isn't writeable.\n\nA: Also be aware when making aplications with:\n  update-rc.d myscript defaults \n\nTo have permissions 0755 and to use or get before your .sh the path.\nLet's say your script is on /root/test.sh , you should first change to CD /root/ before accessing test.sh.\nSo best way is to make a SH on init.d and there change the path to your sh and execute it in the start function.\n\nA: Simple startup scripts with Java version checking for Linux auth-agent\nand Windows auth-agent.bat\n\nA: The easiest way is to use supervisord.

Though from the output it seems like multiple devices may be in trouble. I am guessing multiple disks may be in questionable state, hence the faulted state on sdb and sdc. Figure out what might be wrong with them and your pool may prove you wrong. This does not look like a fatal state of pool.\n\nA: Can you just mixed up disks?\nOnce I mixed up disks and zpool said \"disks contain corrupted data\". After I connected disks in previous sequence it started working.\nMaybe after you imported tank zpool recognized right sequence.\n\nA: I think the previous posters have highlighted the problem. The probable cause was due to the way you specified the disks.\nMy experience is with ZFS on Ubuntu. Though I do use ZFS on freenas as well, I've never had to delve into the bsd implementation.\nCertainly for Ubuntu, you are strongly advised to specify your devices by-id rather than by descriptor: i.e. /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-SATA-long string that uniquely ids the physical disk rather than /dev/sda.\nUsing by-id device removes any dependence on the specific SATA port the disk is connected to.\nGareth\n", "Q: dual boot ubuntu installation mishap I have Windows 7 pc ,where i had 2 partitions, a c drive for my system files and a d drive for my data. \nI decided to install ubuntu 11.10 a couple of days ago and thought of install it in a separate partition of its own. So i made a separate Linux partition of 30GB. I downloaded ubuntu on my usb stick and installed. \nDuring the installation process i was asked where to install ubuntu so i opened up a screen that was similar to this one\n\nThere were six partitions present ( I had made only 3 partition via windows). Their names were totally different from the ones that i had given in windows. So i selected a drive which had the same size as my Linux partition that i had made in windows ( no other partition had the same size). I clicked on install now and got an error message saying that \"There was no root folder set\". I set the newly made partition as my root folder and clicked install now. Now out of the 6 partitions that were created 3 were logical ( i had only created 3 partitions in windows). As soon as i clicked install now, the system asked me where i wanted to put my \"swap space\". I selected one of the logical drives and hit install. Ubuntu successfully installed on my system and at the end it asked me to reboot. I did and got the following error message:\n\"missing operating system\".\nI was shocked. I tried my windows recovery disk ( that i had gotten when i had purchased my laptop) and there i went into startup repair. In the startup repair option i was not able to locate windows. The system asked me to click the \"Load drivers\" button to load the drivers to my harddrive where windows was installed, but i could not locate any drivers to my harddrive. I tried this several times but to no success. I panicked and installed ubuntu, now this time click \"ok\" at every step( not worrying about the partition and all). The os installed correctly and i am now able to access my harddrive. NO data within the c drive is lost. All the windows system files are intact.\nI wish to recover my windows installation. How do i go about it?\nThank you in advance. I do not want to format my computer and install windows again.\n\nA: I'm not 100% certain I understand what happened, but it sounds like your bootloader is messed up.  The partition you chose to use as swap would have had its data erased and been reformatted as a Linux swap partition.  Since you haven't managed to boot the system since it's probably recoverable if it was important.\nThe simple way to fix it is probably to reinstall Ubuntu.  That should also reinstall GRUB.  You'll want to choose for your swap partition one that is not in use for anything else.  Depending on your machine you may be able to get away without one, or to use swapfiles, but that's a different discussion.\nIf that fails, http://www.supergrubdisk.org/ has a neat utility disk which should let you restore the Windows bootloader without having to reinstall Windows.\n", "Q: How do I print a PDF file?

Let's say, for instance, I wanted to try the Cinnamon desktop in Ubuntu. Are there any dangers (in terms of stability & security) in adding the Linux Mint repository to my software sources? Should I opt instead for the ppa created especially for Ubuntu?\n\nA: If at all possible you should use the PPA for Ubuntu. The ppa is going to be more compatible.\nIf you need you can try to use the Mint repositories, but mixing and matching repositories can be problematic. If you do so, use pinning and install the minimal number of packages from Mint.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/PinningHowto\n", "Q: Upgrade to Firefox 9 crazy dependencies? Today I logged into my Ubuntu 10.04 remote dekstop machine for the first time in a while. I noticed that Firefox 3.6 would be upgraded to Firefox 9.

I think that pages load more smooth and quicker in Firefox 9, so this is great.\n\nA: Upgrades on Kubuntu might have a lot of dependencies .Firefox needs only some of them of them\nSuch as the xul-ext-ubufox.

The kind of transparency I'm seeing in Ubuntu 11.10 is it will show the desktop wallpaper. This is not what I want.\nWhen I first installed Ultimate Edition, transparent windows would show the window right below them, not the desktop. This is the kind of transparency that I want. How can I get Ubuntu to function like this again? \n\nA: I'm not entirely sure what of this accomplished what you're trying to do, but here's what I did that did result in the transparency you want:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installed Ubuntu 11.10\n\n*Installed Xfce4\n\n*Turned on 'Enable display compositing' (Settings -> Settings Manager -> Window Manager Tweaks -> Compositor (tab).\nBut, before I turned on compositing, I wasn't getting pseudo-transparency, either (which is what you're describing).

(for both 10.04 and 11.10)\n\nA: Ultimate Edition uses to come pre-installed with compiz and its plugins. \nYou need to install Compiz and check if the default plugins includes those needed to enable transparent windows, such as \"Opacity, Brightness and Saturation\", which controls the transparency of the windows, \"Opacify\" reduces/increases the opacity of the window based on the mouse over windows behavior.\nSee this https://askubuntu.com/a/1046/9598. And this: https://askubuntu.com/search?q=transparent&submit=search (a search in the site will provide lots of answers to your question).\nI hope this give you a clue on where to begin.\nBTW: I am not sure that Compiz will work fine on XFCE, when I tried Ultimate Edition it didn't, but it was the 2.8 release which used Gnome as Desktop Manager.\nGood luck!\n\nA: After you have done what Geppettvs D'Constanzo said, you can hold down alt over the window you want to make transparent, then scroll. It works wonderfully and you can see any non-minimized windows beneath. I hope it will work for you in XFCE!\n", "Q: How to change terminal settings by file configuration?

Whether you're using windows or linux as your host OS, it's probably the same problem.  \nWindows:\nextended versus ati eyefinity group(probably something similar for nvidia)  \nLinux:\nExtend/twin-view versus xinerama  \nIn both cases, if your multiscreen setup has the OS thinking about them as separate displays, you can get seamless on one monitor to work.

How can I prevent Banshee from remembering what files I have played? I really hate the way it keeps surprising me by automatically playing, after the current track, the previous file it had played. I really HATE that. I was just listening to a beautiful piece of music and in a nice mood when Banshee, without asking me, immediately afterwards, started playing a really annoying answerphone message from earlier.\nMy solution so far is to manually delete all files in the playlist, but obviously that's not a long term solution. I cannot find an option anywhere that says \"Do not remember my history\"\n(Did I mention I hate the way Banshee plays my files without asking me?)\n\nA: Take a look and see where playback or smart mode is in preferences and change it or switch off smart-mode. Or check playback repeat or shuffle is off.\n\nA: Sounds like that file ended up in your play queue from having been opened earlier. Banshee relies on its own library in your Music folder (which it assumes is all music), and while it tries, its design doesn't cope well with opening audio files outside that library. It's still a really nice application for playing music in the background, though!\nIf you'd like, you can keep Banshee but change this behaviour. Open System Settings, choose the Details panel and then \"Default applications.\" Here you can set your music player to something other than Banshee. I set mine to the default Movie Player, and VLC is a fine choice as well.\n\nNow when you open an audio file it will be played in that application you selected. When you wish to use Banshee, you can start it from the dash or the sound menu :)\n\nA: I have filed a bug on this behavior, and am determined to fix it!\nhttps://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=699961\n", "Q: How do I use get_media_file() in the latest Quickly?

I.e. get_media_file(f) is the equivalent of \n\"file://\" + os.path.join(get_data_path(), \"media\", f)\n\nAnd get_data_path() will return /home/stefano/hello/data.\nThese functions are defined in hello/hello_lib/helpers.py and hello/hello_lib/helloconfig.py.\n\nA: It seems you just give it the name of the file in your data/media directory. \nFor example, if you want data/media/foo.png, you just call get_media_file('foo.png').

Let's say I install Wubi to a USB. Let's also say that I, while using my USB version of Ubuntu, saved a file. \nIf I ran that same USB of Wubi on a different PC, will I lose that file?\n\nA: The answer is yes and no. It depends. If you, for example, create three partitions on your flash USB drive like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Partition 1 with Live Ubuntu\n\n*Partition 2 for your Wubi installation (this partition will be overwritten each time you install a new Wubi)\n\n*Partition 3 to be set as home\n\n\nIn such case, if you set each time on every computer installation the same way, your home partition will be untouched.\nHowever, I would recommend not to use Wubi, but an ordinary Ubuntu (or Xubuntu, or even Damn Small Linux) installation on the pendrive. I did the latter once and that worked really well. I've had three computers with Microsoft Windows on each hard drive. On micro-SD cards I had installed 3 Linux systems: Debian Lenny, and on one 8GB flash pendrive I've had my home partition with all my data projects and stuff.\nWhen I needed Linux, I just plugged in the micro-SD card and my home partition pendrive before booting, and I would have had a fully functioning Linux distribution. I am sure you could do the same with Wubi.\n\nA: I think you're confusing Wubi. That installs Ubuntu within Windows. You can install it to a USB but it's booted via the Windows installation (the Windows boot manager). You can't plug that USB in to a new computer and expect to boot it (even if that computer is running Windows), and you cannot boot it as a live USB. \nAny file you save on the Wubi install (wherever it's installed) will be permanently saved.\nWhat you're probably thinking of is creating a bootable USB with persistence. This allows you to boot from a USB on any computer, and also any file you save will be available on other computers. This is very different to Wubi.

It is using the b43legacy drivers:\nfilename:       /lib/modules/3.0.0-14-generic/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/b43legacy/b43legacy.ko\nfirmware:       b43legacy/ucode4.fw\nfirmware:       b43legacy/ucode2.fw\nfirmware:       FW10\nlicense:        GPL\nauthor:         Michael Buesch\nauthor:         Stefano Brivio\nauthor:         Martin Langer\ndescription:    Broadcom B43legacy wireless driver\nsrcversion:     0355EB47C162A7D873BD576\nalias:          ssb:v4243id0812rev04*\nalias:          ssb:v4243id0812rev02*\ndepends:        mac80211,ssb,cfg80211\nvermagic:       3.0.0-14-generic SMP mod_unload modversions 686 \nparm:           pio:enable(1) / disable(0) PIO mode (int)\nparm:           bad_frames_preempt:enable(1) / disable(0) Bad Frames Preemption (int)\nparm:           fwpostfix:Postfix for the firmware files to load. (string)\n\nThe issue that I'm having is with the transfer rates. When Ubuntu auto sets the rate to 54Mbps, I get very slow speeds. I tested on my LAN by using iperf.\nI have a Windows laptop on my LAN via Wi-Fi that is running iperf in server mode. On the Ubuntu laptop, I run iperf in client mode and connect to the Windows laptop. iperf reports speeds just under 1Mbps (anywhere from 600Kbps to 700Kpbs).\nI know my LAN itself is not the issue. I have an iperf app for my Android phone. When I enable the Wi-Fi for it and join the LAN, running it in client mode connecting to the same Windows laptop reports speeds of about 10Mbps. I also have a desktop PC with a wired connection to my router. When I run iperf on the desktop in server mode and run iperf on the Windows laptop in client mode, iperf reports speeds that are about 20Mbps.\nHere's where it gets weird. I change the rate to 11Mbps on the BCM4306 on my Compaq:\nsudo iwconfig wlan0 rate 11M\nI rerun the iperf tests on the Compaq and now I am seeing speeds in the 2Mbps to 3Mbps range. Much better!\nHowever this confuses me as I am certain that the BCM4306 does both 802.11b and g, yet it is acting as if it can only handle \"b\" speeds.\nI would love it if I could get the BCM4306 to work properly at the 54Mbps rate. I tried installing the compat-wireless drivers from linuxwireless.org, but I ran into a whole other can of worms there that I'd rather not get into unless someone feels like it may be related to the drivers I am using.\nDoes anyone know how I can get my BCM4306 working properly at 54Mbps?\nThanks in advance.\nEDIT:\nI forgot to mention something. This Compaq has an Ethernet adapter as well. If I disable the BCM4306 and run the iperf test in client mode again to the Windows laptop while hard-wired to my router, I get speeds of 19Mbps. So all these iperf test tell me that it is isolated to the BCM4306 itself.\n\nA: The reason why 11M works better than 54M is that at different rates the signal power (and the range) is different. The slower the better range.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11b-1999#Range\n\nA: Make a script in /etc/network/if-up.d , you can name it what you wish, call it BCM4306\n# graphical\ngksu gedit /etc/network/if-up.d/BCM4306\n\n# command line\nsudo -e /etc/network/if-up.d/BCM4306\n\nPut the following code into it\n#!/bin/sh -e\n#\n# Sets speed of interface to 54M\n\nif [ \"$IFACE\" = \"eth1\" ] ; then\n    iwconfig wlan0 rate 11M\nfi\n\nMake it executable\nsudo chmod a+x /etc/network/if-up.d/BCM4306\n\nIt should work when you reboot or restart your network.\nNote: 11M is an odd value, have you tried 54M or 150M ?\n", "Q: How to configure Dash to not start in fullscreen? I have an older screen with a max resolution of 1024x768.  According to all that I have found, Dash will always open full screen with a height of less than 799.  That makes it very hard to drag things from Dash to the desktop when the desktop cannot be reached when Dash is open.  I need to make Dash use less than the full screen so I can drag things to the desktop. This method (drag to desktop) seems to me to be the only viable way for non-techies to get things on the desktop.\nI seem to be able to drag from Dash to the application bar on the left of the screen.  Why can't I drag something from there to the desktop?\n\nA: If you drag a thing from the dash to the right screen border the dash in Unity 3D (but not in Unity 2D) closes so you can drop that thing on the desktop.\nRun\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity form-factor Desktop\n\nfrom the command line if you don't want the Dash to open in full screen mode.\n\nA: It setting the form-factor doesn't help & if the Dash doesn't close when dragging because you can't reach the edge you can try a little trick.\nGrab the icon & start dragging with cursor. Then tap the super button which should close the Dash & expose your desktop where you can then drop the icon.\n", "Q: how to ping & use specific network card \ni have 3 network cards , 1 Lan (wired) , 1 wireless network card & 1 is wireless usb\nhow do i ping from specific network card ?\n& how do i use specific network card for specific application\n\nexample \ni want to ping google from wlan0 \n\nexample for specific application\ni want to use firefox or transmission from wan1\n\nUPDATED\nLan ip 192.168.0.2 > Working Properly \n\nWlan1 ip 192.168.0.3\n\npin -I wlan1 google.com\n\nUPDATE\nTry pasting the output of route -n and/or ip route.

That is good, as multiple gateway routing is quite an advanced topic and somewhat difficult to handle well.\nThis goes beyond what you asked in the original question.

Although I got quite proficient in installing and dealing with ATI driver issues, I don't know anything about NVidia's problems or issues. \nLooking through askUbuntu quite a lot, I see a lot of problems generated by the ATI video cards, and in comparison, I hardly see posts related to NVidia cards. Are the drivers for the latter so good that everything runs out of the box?\nSo, to keep it short, if I would to change my system now, should I go for an NVidia video card or should I stick to my ATI?\n\nA: Currently the AMD drivers are more open to linux development. But before this Nvidia was way more stable for linux and AMD had the most issues. So AMD still has some catching up to do. I would say for now nvidia is still best to go with.\nThe most driver issues that I've experienced with nvidia was lately with optimus technology on newer laptops. The bumblebee project is doing a teriffic job at battling that however. It's a matter of adding a ppa or two, installing via apt-get and you're good to go.\nIt's your call. But even if you're not afraid to get your hands dirty I would not urge for AMD, because there's always something to do for the nvidia cards too to keep things running nice and smooth. If you want the least possible hastle it's a no brainer, nvidia.\nReasons being: 1) they're still ahead when it comes to driver stability.\n2) nvidia used to be more stable and so it has a much larger comunity behind it to counter linux problems with nvidia cards.\n\nA: It does seem like nvidia has a reputation for better linux compatibility than ATI.  However I believe this is less true today than it was in the past.  Also, if you're considering doing any bitcoin mining (a stretch, I know) ATI cards will do it faster.\n\nA: I have both, and they both work fine.  \nBonuses with ATI -\nBetter opencl performance\nCheaper for more stream processing units\nMore development in the open drivers  \nBonuses with nvidia -\nThey have a mature freebsd binary driver(probably not relevant for you)\nGenerally more stable for the time being\nIf you dual boot, they have less issues with windows gaming if you have a multi-gpu card  \n\nA: I would suggest getting nVidia because I've never had any problems with any of those. With ATI cards I've had a lot of trouble regardless to used operating system: for example with X1650 Battlefield for free didn't run under XP. \nBut to be honest I also have two ATI cards and both of them work well under Ubuntu Lucid (X1650 and integrated X2100).\nHowever in general after a few years of expierience with both producers I choose nVidia when thinking about new PC. Also because of CUDA compiler and other technologies and proffesional libs I get for free when buying VGA card.\n\nA: As of now do not go for AMD cards. AMD cards has some issue due to which they are not usable in Gnome3 Environment. Luckily Ubuntu is not using Gnome3, otherwise I would have forced to use another distro. For last couple of months, I have used Gnome3 in many distros and they have the same screen flickering issue. Even after months, AMD did not resolved this issue. So better to stick with Nvidia. \n", "Q: No tilde and no caret on german keyboard In the course of a 11.10 install I lost network connect. So I skipped retrieving update packages and completed install, doing upgrade in the newly installed system. Everything is working fine, but the keyboard layout is not quite correct. Most keys are mapped correctly, but some are missing, for example the caret (below °) and the tilde (Alt-Gr + + )\nAny hints?\nThanks in advance\nMartin\n\nA: This is the default German keyboard layout: the keys/key combinations you mention are set as \"dead keys\" (\"Akzenttasten\"), so you need to enter a space after them to have them displayed (which would also enable you to easily enter e.g. â or ẽ if you enter the character you want to \"decorate\" instead of space).\nIf you don't want those keys to be \"dead\", you need to select a keyboard layout with no (or fewer) dead keys as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the control center (\"Systemeinstellungen\") \n\n*Choose keyboard settings (\"Tastaturbelegung\") (in the first row)\n\n*Switch to the layouts (\"Belegungen\") tab\n\n*Click on the little plus sign in the lower left to add a new layout. You might want to select \"Deutsch (ohne Akzenttasten)\" or something like \"Deutsch (nur Grave-(`) und Acute-(')-Akzentzeichen)\". Once you've decided for a layout, click on \"Add\" (\"Hinzufügen\").\n\n*Move that layout to the top of the list using the button with the up arrow (^).\n\n\nAs soon as you have installed more than one keyboard layout, a little keyboard icon will appear in the indicator area which will allow you to switch keyboard layouts quickly. If you're happy with only one layout and want to get rid of it, use the keyboard settings control panel just remove all the other layouts except for the one you want to keep.\n", "Q: Audio not working on new install of 11.10 I am excited to join this community!

Thank you for any help!\n\nA: It's not a Linux question - or even Ubuntu, but...\nYou have the Ubuntu CD in the CD drive, right? If you do, then apparently your computer boots from the hard drive first. You can change that.\nWith computer's make/model in mind, find the manual online in order to learn how to get into the computer's BIOS and how to select a different boot device at boot time. Then you can either change the boot order in the BIOS or choose it at boot time. \nIf you want to hack though it instead, insert the Ubuntu CD in the CD drive.\nAs the system first boots, you may see a \"Boot Options\" menu.

In case it's relevant, the laptop in question is the Lenovo W500.\n\nA: Your friend's laptop includes a fancy new thing where it actually has two video cards: one for low power consumption when it isn't doing much and one powerful one for performance on the fancy stuff. Linux support for the switching mechanism between the two is still pretty sketchy.\nFor that laptop in order to get fancy accerated desktop stuff like Gnome-3 to function, you will need to be running on the faster ATI graphics card.

This is also true when installing in a virtual machine. Therefore there is no good reason (not even being lazy) to not install Ubuntu directly.\nFor testing you could even boot your virtual machine to an Ubuntu live environment from the installation CD .iso without installation in a minute (but then you will not have benefits from Guest Additions)\n\nIn summary: you do not need a preconfigured virtual machine for testing Ubuntu.\n\n\nA: Bitnami.org has preconfigured Ubuntu LAMP Stacks (http://bitnami.com/stack/lamp/virtual-machine).

What's the reason behind it? and if i were to make an Icon How can i link Icon A to Icon B?.\n\n\nA: In general you create links when you want to have the same content reachable under different names. \nSince some applications are looking for add and other for list-add, it is easier to provide both icons, then to change the software to only look for one of the names. \nAnother reason is that designers might want to keep the set of icons small, and thus provide related topics with the same icons. \nLinks in general are generated with the ln command. \nExample: ln -s target.svg linkname.svg creates a symbolik link between the two files. \nYou can read the documentation of ln by running man ln or a shorter version ln --help.\n", "Q: How to invoke kernel with serial console?

I don't mind this in general, however I'd like to be able to turn off the cooling pad under it. I tried the things outlined in the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4702216/controlling-a-usb-power-supply-on-off-with-linux\nhowever this doesn't work anymore in Linux 3.0.0. I read the kernel docs:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.mjmwired.net/kernel/Documentation/usb/power-management.txt\nand tried this (also outlined here - http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/How_to_reduce_power_consumption):\nfor i in /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/power/autosuspend; do echo 1|sudo tee $i; done \nfor i in /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/power/level; do echo auto|sudo tee $i; done\n\nI can confirm this works properly for some devices - e.g. my USB keyboard auto-suspends as expected. However, some devices do not - e.g. my USB touchpad, USB hub it's connected to and the cooler are left with power.\nMy questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why are devices behaving differently? Does this mean that it's up to each of the devices to decide whether to suspend?\n\n*Is there a way to determine whether a device will go into suspend mode?\n\n*Finally, is there a way to force a device to power down?\n\n\nA: I had the same problem on a Toshiba Satellite L550D.  I am running Linux Mint 17 and kernel 3.13.\nI had Mint 9 on it previously and it ran really well. All USB ports powered down and the cooling pad went off too.\nNow it stays on and I found that the application acpitool was very helpful in solving the mystery.\nacpitool -w    \n\nlists all of the devices and their current status (either disabled or enabled)\nI had 3 devices (the USB ports) that were \"enabled\".\nWith acpitool -W # (number of entry) \nthe device is set to disable.\nI did it for all three devices and the power now goes off when the laptop goes into suspend.\nThis configuration will not survive reboots. So something more needs to happen (e.g. a startup script or some configuration change that will make those settings stick)\n\nA: The reason for that can be hardware related and nothing to do with software.\nSome motherboards now a days have an option to allow some of the USB ports to be always powered no matter the state of the computer: if its plugged in / batery connected, there is power on that USB connector.\nThat feature can be easily identifiable by the different symbol on the USB port and some computer makers have also an option on the BIOS to enable/disable that feature\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu Internet stops working I have a very big Internet problem in Ubuntu.

Note that this isn't your IP address on the Internet, just your local address. You can always go to whatismyip.com for an easy way to see it.  \n \nIn your screenshot, eth0 is an Ethernet connection, and wlan0 is your wireless connection. To get your IP address in the Windows virtual machine, try typing ipconfig/all at a command prompt (Start/Accessories/Run/type 'CMD', and looking for your default gateway there:  \n \nIn this example, my guest sees the Ubuntu host as 10.0.2.2\n\nIt may be that the VM sees it as a wired connection, even on a laptop with the host using wifi.\n", "Q: How to set the different default character encoding of `gnome-terminal` from the system default locale? It seems that the gnome-terminal program use system default local as its default encoding when it is started. For some reason, I can not change the system default locale setting.

Is it possible to set the default locale of gnome-terminal (different from system default locale), or let gnome-terminal remember the last used encoding? \n\nA: Method one: set appropriate variables. For example (try running this from the shell):\nLANG=C /usr/bin/gnome-terminal\n\n(depending which locale settings you need you may want to set other variables, type \"locale\" to see the complete list)\nIf it works, you can wrap it as shell script (just save such line as sth like \"myterm\", make it executable and puth somewhere in the PATH) and just use \"myterm\" to spawn new terminals.\nMethod two: you can use similar trick inside gnome-terminal configuration. Enter profile preferences (Edit/Profile Preferences), click [x] Run a custom command instead of my shell, and use sth like   \n/path/to/mybash\n\nas your custom command. /path/to/mybash should be executable and contain\nexport LANG=C\nexec bash\n\n(or sth similar) Note that this is \"per-profile\", so if you use multiple terminal profiles, you may need to repeat it.\nPS If you need multiple encodings, just create multiple profiles and use appropriate one whenever you need.

Which files/directories can I move to RAM drive to have the system working faster?\nI'm planning to upgrade my laptop's memory to 8GB soon, so I'll have some fast memory to use. How to configure the system to work optimal with this memory?\nThe next changes I consider next are:\n- upgrading hard drive to SSD\n- start using virtualization (I need Windows sometimes)\nEdit:\nMaybe I can sacrifice boot time, and copy some files to RAM drive during boot?\n\nA: To mount /tmp /var/log and /var/tmp in RAM. Add these lines to the end of fstab to mount /tmp (temporary files) as tmpfs (temporary file system):\ntmpfs /tmp     tmpfs defaults,noatime,mode=1777 0 0\ntmpfs /var/log tmpfs defaults,noatime,mode=1777 0 0\ntmpfs /var/tmp tmpfs defaults,noatime,mode=1777 0 0\n\nSave, then: sudo mount -a\nReboot for the changes to take effect. Running df, you should see a new line with /tmp, /var/tmp and /var/logs mounted on tmpfs.\nNote: all log files will be lost after a reboot, to back them up manually run this in terminal:\nrsync -av /var/log/* ~/saved_logfiles\n\nTo move Firefox Cache Into RAM:\nType about:config in firefox address bar and click I'll be careful,I promise!.\nRight click on blank area and create a new string value called:\n browser.cache.disk.parent_directory\n\nSet its value to /tmp\nRestart Firefox.\n\nA: As per the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard for Linux, /var/tmp should NOT be placed in tmpfs:\nhttp://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_2.3/fhs-2.3.html#VARTMPTEMPORARYFILESPRESERVEDBETWEE\n\nThe /var/tmp directory is made available for programs that require temporary files or directories that are preserved between system reboots. Therefore, data stored in /var/tmp is more persistent than data in /tmp. Files and directories located in /var/tmp must not be deleted when the system is booted. Although data stored in /var/tmp is typically deleted in a site-specific manner, it is recommended that deletions occur at a less frequent interval than /tmp.\n\n\nA: There's not much from a default installation to put on a ramdisk, since it will be erased every time you boot. A ramdisk is only usable for temporary files.\nSo directories to run of a ramdisk I can think of are /var/run/ and /var/tmp/ (maybe /tmp).

When I install Ubuntu, the first thing I usually do is remove some programs and install some others. To get that done, I enter the following in a terminal:\nsudo apt-get remove applicationA applicationB applicationC && sudo apt-get install applicationX applicationY applicationZ.\nThis works nicely, but the problem is that I have to confirm twice: first I have to confirm the removal of the applications, and after some time I have to confirm the installation of the others. It would be great if I only had to confirm once, because I wouldn't have to come back to the computer in the meantime. Is there any command to get that done?\nPlease note that I'm not looking for workarounds in e.g. Synaptic Package Manager. I want to do this from the command line.\nThanks.\n\nA: Use the -y option for apt-get.\nFrom the man page:\n\n-y, --yes, --assume-yes\n      Automatic yes to prompts; assume \"yes\" as answer to all prompts and\n      run non-interactively.

With aptitude install commands add - after the package name to have it removed, and with aptitude remove commands add + after the package name to have it installed. \nIf you enter \nsudo aptitude install pkg1 pkg2- \nthe first packages will be installed while the second one will be removed. \nHowever, on the other hand, if you use \nsudo aptitude remove pkg1+ pkg2 \nthe second package will be removed and the first installed.\nSource: for a more detailed explanation of apt and aptitude, see the Debian Handbook.\n\nA: From the apt-get man page:\n\ninstall\n  [...] If a hyphen is appended to the package name (with no intervening space), the identified package will be removed if it is installed. Similarly a plus sign can be used to designate a package to install. These latter features may be used to override decisions made by apt-get's conflict resolution system.\n\nYou can append a hyphen to the package name, then apt-get will remove that package.

I've allways made \"simple\" backups, saving all my files normally in folders on my external hard drive. I've already used the tool that Windows 7 (on my desktop computer) offers to make backups, but it isn't realy diferent from copying them manualy.\nYesterday, I decided to give a chance to Deja-Dup, and I made a backup from my netbook, and them I restored them to a virtual machine, just for experiment. And I felt realy amazed when I saw that Deja-Dup, because it backups all my home folder, was capable to restore not only my files, but also all my apps configurations and even my background! I think this app is incredible, and it deserves to be used on my computer! :D\nBut there is one problem. I have about 100GB of data, and I want to have it on both netbook and desktop (Ubuntu and Windows. I don't use it on my desktop because of some games I bought and wich I can't play on Ubuntu). It's a lot of data to duplicate.\nIf I skip some files from Ubuntu backups, like pictures, my Background will disappear, and I will have to put those files separatly, which will take much more work than backing up everything. I just wanted to know: Is there a way of accessing those files without having to restore them, from Ubuntu/Windows? I mean, to open the backup files like 7zip would open a zipped file, so I can take just what I want from the backup files, on any OS.\nI want also to say THANK YOU to Ubuntu developers and to the comunity that make this OS so freaking amazing. Ubuntu is the best OS I've ever used, specially with Unity desktop. Please continue with the great work!\n\nA: Yes, it's possible. Go to the directory where the file used to be, (eg: Pictures), open the folder in Nautilus, and click \"Restore Missing Files...\"\n\nIf a file or directory has since changed, and you want to restore previous versions, right click on the file itself, and choose \"Revert to Previous Version...\"\n\n\nA: If you need to access some of your back-upped files frequently, go for a back-up solution like Rsnapshot or BackInTime, and leave duplicity-based backup solutions like Deja-Dup. It will save you a lot of time.\n\nA: Deja-Dup uses duplicity, which stores backups as a set of encrypted archive files. There exists no simple method to access the files in the backup than restore via duplicity or Deja-Dup\n\nA: There is a Windows Duplicity frontend called \"Duplicati\" (at www.duplicati.com) which does the same deja-dup does for Windows, and might be able to access your backup. You might lose some file attributes (e.g. access rights, read only flags, thumbnails etc) when restoring on Windows, but this might be acceptable. If it works, give me a thumbs up, I'm also curious :)\nBUT: if you really want to use all your files on both Windows and Linux I highly recommend you get some NAS (I have good experience with WD Mybook Live, they are quite cheap and good), then you can access your files from both computers at the same time and don't need to sync all the time. \n\nA: If you need direct access to your backup files, then rdiff-backup is the very best answer. It creates a mirror of your original files and directories, and changed/deleted files are stored as increment files, which must be first restored, of course.\nBut accessing a file that is in the mirror? Simply locate it on the backup, and copy it over to your computer. Likewise, restoring the most recent version of your backup is a simple as copying files.\n\nA: It'd be nice to have a gui that shows backed up file versions and allows you to delete specific file versions from the backup (a security need I have) or restore them to original or other folders.\n\nA: the fies will be in a .gz format. you can open them without restoreing them. if you open the volume dir. you can use \"file-roller\"\n", "Q: After downloading the latest 64-bit ver., that .iso installed a 32-bit platform in my notebook!

Number 1 could be possible but I don't really know much about plymouth.\nFirst off, create a small shell script containing these lines:\n#!/bin/bash\nmpg123 -q $1 &\n\nI chose to save it as /usr/local/bin/play-sound (Also make sure mpg123 is installed).\nYou can use any command-line player you like. The & at the end of the line is imortant since lightdm will wait untill the script finishes. And we want the sound to play during lightdm. And the $1 will be replaced by whaterver file we specify when executing the script later on. Also remember to chmod +x the script.\n2 ) Edit /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf and set greeter-setup-script=play-sound <file.mp3> somewhere in the [SeatDefaults] section. Make sure the mp3 is accessible for all (not in an encrypted home folder or such). Don't use a long file as it will play it until the end.\n3 ) Run gnome-session-properties from a terminal or run-dialog. Click Add, enter a nifty name, set the command to play-sound <file.mp3>. Add a comment if you want. Click Add and then Close. This will make the selected file play when the current user logs in. If you want the file to play for all users just move the resulting file from $HOME/.config/autostart/ to /usr/share/gnome/autostart/. I might add that there are more ways to set a login-sound for gnome. This is just a quick way. \nI have tested these two solutions in ubuntu 11.10 running gnome-shell and unity. If I get some time over I will look in to the matter of running audio when plymouth runs. Or if anyone else knows ho to do this feel free to join in.\n\nA: There is no option to set custom sound. But you can hack it.  ubuntu run files from /usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo so place your desire file and rename it(File format ogg).\nAs an example if you want to change login sound then replace desktop-login.ogg with your file.\n", "Q: How to determine which version of gfortran is installed?

First, some background: KDE4 doesn't have a \"desktop\" per se, but uses a \"widget dashboard\". Users can make this behave like a traditional desktop, by using \"folder view\". There are two similar ways of showing this dashboard/desktop: either as a transparent overlay over all of your windows (\"dashboard\"), or by hiding all the current windows on screen (\"desktop\"). Each can be triggered by a keyboard shortcut, by a mouse-click on a widget (plasmoid), or by pushing the mouse cursor into the corner of the screen.\nKeyboard shortcut\nTo show the widget dashboard, the default keyboard shortcut is Ctrl-F12.

Okay, there's tons of questions about recovery partitions, but most, if not all pertain to Windows.  My question is, \"Can you make a bootable recovery partition FOR Ubuntu?\"  I'm soon going to put Ubuntu 11.10 on a separate disk so that I can have a full TB for Windows 7, and a full TB for Ubuntu.  \nBUT, I want to have it like Windows has, and be able to recover Ubuntu, should something go wrong and still have my current installation intact for later recovery.  Is this possible?  I've been searching and searching, unable to find out how to do this, but there's GOT to be someone who knows how to do it!  \nI've contemplated using the contents of a custom installation ISO, but, I don't think you can \"burn\" an ISO to a partition...if anyone can help me with this, I'd be ever so grateful!\n\nA: *\n\n*There is a wiki page about this and it is old. No progress on it since 2009.\n\n*On brainstorm people have strong opposing opinions about this. Look at the related topics and you can see it is asked alot but there is also alot of discussion about why we would (not) need it.\n\n\nBasically the anwser is... no, because there are better ways. Or more like ways Unix/Linux users have been using for years and years. \nBesides regular backups of home, data partitions and conf files (mysql conf and apache conf if you have them) if you want a plain and simple method have a look at the dd command. It can clone a complete disc onto another disc and you can use dd again to put it back on that disc. More info and info on dd.\nIn general: if you have a copy of your home and important files you can always re-install and put those files back. \nJust found https://askubuntu.com/questions/99626/what-are-the-benefits-to-use-dd-command on dd. It's a great reference.\nYou can create a bootable liveCD/USB for recovery instead.\n\nA: You can use dd but it takes a long time and basically copies your free space as well as your data. I also have found some cases where it simply fails - perhaps due to some bad blocks. I would advise something more high level such as rsync where you have some control over what you are copying, and you are only copying real data (which means a smaller backup), and also you can synchronize this without copying everything (required with a dd backup).\nThis sort of solution is currently available in the form of the Wubi migration script. While primarily created for Wubi installs, it also works on a normal install and essentially makes a fully bootable backup with a synchronization option. There are some limitations, such as not supporting encrypted /home or more exotic installs, but it does support separate /home, /boot, /usr and / partitions. \nIf you want a compressed backup that you can selectively restore from, then using tar makes more sense, as described here: Howto: Backup and restore your system! \n", "Q: How apt-get selects from a list of alternative dependencies? I understand that in the Depends: section of the deb control files, a package may specify alternative dependencies separated by | symbol to satisfy a single dependency. \nMy question is, how does apt-get decides which one to install when there are alternatives? \nIs there a way to manually alter this selection using something similar to apt_preferences?  \nFor example, if a package depends on java and in the Depends section we have openjdk-6-jre | sun-java6-jre, how can I force apt-get to install openjdk-6-jre provided that the system does not have either packages installed?\n\nA: In the Debian Policy Manual, Chapter 7 - Declaring relationships between packages you can read\n\nIn the Depends, Recommends, Suggests, Pre-Depends, Build-Depends and\n  Build-Depends-Indep control fields of the package, which declare\n  dependencies on other packages, the package names listed may also\n  include lists of alternative package names, separated by vertical bar\n  (pipe) symbols |. In such a case, if any one of the alternative\n  packages is installed, that part of the dependency is considered to be\n  satisfied.\n\nI cannot find any other useful information about list of alternatives in the whole document, so I should conclude that, in case none of the packages in the list is already installed, the first one in the list would be chosen.

I have a server with Xubuntu 11.10, which is gonna be 12 kilometers away (in a factory of my dad's company) in 3 days. So, in 3 days I have to come up with a solution how to administer it remotely. The computer is in the other room for now, so it's easy to go there, login and after that to control it remotely. I installed Vino and made it to start when the session starts. But that means that you have to go, log in and THEN comeback on your laptop and administrate it remotely. So, my question is: \nHow can I make vino-server to start when Xubuntu is loaded (that means the login screen)? I've done this two years ago on Ubuntu 8.10, but can't remember how.\n\nA: I was in a similar situation looking for a way to administer some remote Ubuntu servers around the country.\nA quick and dirty solution is to have Ubuntu automatically login, have vino in the startup applications, and then set the screensaver to lock in 1 minute.\nIt's not the most secure method, but all of my servers are running headless in controlled/secure environments so my one minute of exposure is acceptable to solve my dilemma.\nThe other option would be to not use vino.

I want to add my compiz settings to a git repo but I'm having a hard time isolating the relevant files. My home directory is a bit of a mess here. I see gnome, compiz, and gconf everywhere. Which are the right ones? :)\nThanks.\n\nA: It depends on your set-up. They are stored in several locations. The best way for you to find them is to open your Terminal Ctrl-Alt-T, then type sudo locate compiz and press Enter. It will return several results, but you can tell by the names which will contain your settings.\n\nA: In my Ubuntu 14.04.3 + Mate 1.8.2\ndconf dump /org/compiz/profiles/mate/ > my-compiz.ini\n\nand restore by\ndconf load /org/compiz/profiles/mate/ < my-compiz.ini\n\nplease note that the import/export by compiz, the export works, however, the import will fail to restore all settings.\n\nA: On my machine, which appears to be Ubuntu 14.10:\n~$ lsb_release -a\nNo LSB modules are available.\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 14.10\nRelease:    14.10\nCodename:   utopic\n\ncompiz settings turn out to be stored in ~/.config/:\n~$ locate compiz | grep ~ | less\n<...snip...>\n~/.cache/compizconfig-1/wall.pb\n~/.cache/compizconfig-1/workarounds.pb\n~/.config/compiz-1\n~/.config/compiz-1/compizconfig\n\nThat ~/.cache/ directory probably isn't worth my time to back up, but on inspection ~/.config/ has a bunch other things that are also worth backing up.\nIf you're planning to back up your Compiz settings, you might just want to back up the entire parent directory of your compiz settings - you're more likely to end up in a familiar desktop environment that way.\n", "Q: How to associate an icon with a shell script? \nPossible Duplicate:\nApply icons to bash scripts \n\nEnvironment: Ubuntu 11.10\nI have a Java application as a jar file. I have created a batch file that contains the following line:\njava -jar ~/MyApp.jar\n\nWhen I execute this batch file, the Java application works as expected.\nTo create a desktop link, I copied this batch file into my \"Desktop\" folder. This results in an icon appearing on the desktop. However, the icon shows \"Java\" on it. I would like to associate a different icon to this desktop link. Would appreciate it if someone can point me in the right direction.\n\nA: Try modifying your .desktop file. Look for the [Desktop Entry] for your java file and change the Icon value.\nMaking a \"launcher\" that will run your script will let you do this. Make a file called MyApp.desktop then edit it with a text editor like gedit.\nNext paste this code into the file, changing the values for your program-\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=MyApp\nTerminal=true\nExec=/usr/bin/MyApp.sh\nIcon=/usr/share/icons/icon.icon\n\nFor Exec= put the path and name of your script file, for Icon put the location and name of the icon you want. For Terminal= put true or false if you want it to show the terminal or not.\nThis will give you a file that you can put anywhere, in the unity launcher, or on the desktop that you can run the script and it will have the icon you want.\nOn The newer versions of Ubuntu you will need to right click the file and select \"allow launching\".\n", "Q: AMD Radeon HD 5650M Ok, so I've got the 5650 as a discrete gpu and integrated 4200.

I have a 1080p wmv video that I'd like to convert to a lower quality (preferably 720p) video. I would like to keep the audio intact. How can I accomplish this in Ubuntu?\n\nA: Time has moved on a little since the original accepted answer for this question in 2012. Newer versions of FFmpeg would be better to use FFmpeg's 'scale' video filter.\nI give an example below, using this filter, which also simply copies the audio track as you have requested:\nffmpeg -i input.wmv \\\n       -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -tune film -crf 22 -vf scale=-2:720 \\\n       -c:a copy \\\n       output.mp4\n\nThe -tune film option given above can be omitted or you could try -tune animation depending on the type of video clip you are using.\nIf you decided that you would like to transcode the audio a good choice would be to use the external library libfdk_aac as follows:\nffmpeg -i input.wmv \\\n       -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -tune film -crf 22 -vf scale=-2:720 \\\n       -c:a libfdk_aac -b:a 128k \\\n       output.mp4\n\nThis is certainly what I would do with a wmv file that I was scaling, you will find the results more than acceptable...\n\nA: Since you used an ffmpeg tag I will use that for the answer.  \nffmpeg -i input.wmv -s hd720 -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -c:a aac -strict -2 output.mp4\n\nChange the video quality by specifying a different CRF parameter. See the x264 encoding guide for more info.\n\nA: If you want to keep intact all the audio tracks, subtitles and so on, you should use something like this:\nffmpeg -i input.mkv \\\n       -map 0:0 -map 0:1 -map 0:2 -map 0:3 -map 0:4 \\\n       -vf scale=-1:720 -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -preset veryslow \\\n       -c:a:0 copy -c:a:1 copy -c:s copy \\\n       output.mkv\n\nIn this case, the input.mkv file has two audio tracks and two subtitles. You can specify all the audio tracks (or subtitles, or videos, etc.) one by one or as a single entity (as I specified for subtitles).\nHope it helps...\n", "Q: Conky colors wont show up I am running Gnome 3 and am trying to get conky to work.

What does this error mean? Any ideas on how to correct it? \n(I am running Ubuntu 11.10)\n\nA: Usually this error means that you could have been changing between different languages (locales) and something has caused this to error erroneously.\nYou could try regenerating your list of locales with\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure locales\n\nFor me the result was:\nGenerating locales...\n  en_AG.UTF-8... done\n  en_AU.UTF-8... done\n  en_BW.UTF-8... done\n  en_CA.UTF-8... done\n  en_DK.UTF-8... done\n  en_GB.UTF-8... done\n  en_HK.UTF-8... done\n  en_IE.UTF-8... done\n  en_IN.UTF-8... done\n  en_NG.UTF-8... done\n  en_NZ.UTF-8... done\n  en_PH.UTF-8... done\n  en_SG.UTF-8... done\n  en_US.UTF-8... up-to-date\n  en_ZA.UTF-8... done\n  en_ZM.UTF-8... done\n  en_ZW.UTF-8... done\nGeneration complete.\n\nThen resetting your local locale with:\nsudo update-locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8\n\ni.e. use one of the Locale values in the output above\n\nA: In my case, the problem was that /usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/root_locale is expecting to see individual locale directories in /usr/lib/locale but locale-gen is configured to generate an archive file by default.\nI fixed it by running: \nsudo locale-gen --purge --no-archive\n\n\nA: The problem may come from the lower case in the \"utf8\" instead of \"UTF8\"??\nWarning: No support for locale: en_US.utf8\n\nThis code seem to solve the problem.\n> sudo update-locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8\n> echo $LANG\nen_US.UTF-8\n\nIt is also possible to go in local languages settings in theory.\n\nThen \"Apply System-Wide\" should also update the local.\n\nA: I see you are running ubuntu11.10 (oneric) @2011, although the above answers may have solved this issue in that version, the warning message still exists, and the answers provided did not fix the problem in my case:\nFrom a fresh install of Ubuntu 14,04 (trusty[Mint 17.1 ISO]) and upgrading to ubuntu 18.04 (bionic[Mint 19.3]) applying 6 upgrades in total.

When I'm producing graphics or PDFs, I might be creating new files and overwriting old ones more than once per minute as I find errors and then overwrite the old files. No, the answer isn't to only produce a PDF only once, because many errors only become apparent when you convert the ODT to a PDF and view the result. So I might create the 'same' PDF a dozen times before I'm happy with it. The same happens when I am creating PNG files from Inkscape.\nU1 syncs immediately, so every time I save something, off it goes, uploading huge files over my mobile broadband connection and slowing my PC to a crawl. I end up having to disconnect U1. For me, U1 is a very handy file backup solution and an easy way to sync my desktop and laptop.\nWhat I want is to be able to set the sync delay for U1. I don't want it to sync every time something changes, I want to, for example, have it sync every 30 minutes.\nThe only way I can think to do this now is have U1 work off a copy of my files that I rsync with a cron job every 30 minutes. But that means using double the disk space, which is ridiculous.\nBut it would be much nicer if U1 had a setting \"number of minutes to wait before syncing a changed file\".\nIs it possible?\n\nA: The easiest option is not to edit files inside of the Ubuntu One directory directly.\nEdit them in another directory and just copy them to the Ubuntu One directory once you think that they should be synced.\nThere is no option to delay the upload of dirty files inside of the Ubuntu One directory.\n\nA: Why don't you just pause U1 sync while you are working, and when you stop your work you activate it again? It seems the easier thing to do...\n", "Q: Illuminated USB keyboard flickers Does anyone know where I can download a driver for the VAKOSS TK-487-UK illuminated keyboard to run on Ubuntu?

In the past, I've upgraded Ubuntu 10.10 to Ubuntu 11.04 using the auto-upgrade function. Unfortunately, the upgrade didn't go very well, and I ended up with a broken 11.04. Because of that, I had to manually reinstall 11.04 from a LiveUSB.\nAfter that, I didn't want to risk to get my system broken again, so six months after, I installed 11.10 from a LiveUSB too, instead of upgrading from 11.04.\nBut this method starts to annoy me, and I'd like to use the auto-upgrade function  to upgrade from 11.10 to 12.04 in April. Besides of making a full-system backup, what can I do to make this Ubuntu upgrade go as smoothly and error-free as possible?\n\nA: I usually don't have any problems upgrading, here is what I do for my computers:\n\n\n*\n\n*Read the Release Notes.\n\n*Plan accordingly - Though we strive to make the upgrade experience easy and troublefree sometimes bad things happen, an operating system upgrade is a major thing. Have good backups and don't do an upgrade during a point in time where it would become inconvenient for you to have to fix something.\n\n*Keep it simple - I don't have exotic multidrive setups or things that need me messing around with grub or my partitions. I use the default layout the installer recommends for \nmy laptop, and a simple SSD/HDD setup for my desktops.\n\n*Don't use PPAs - Even though the upgrader will disable PPAs there's no way to guarantee that disabling them will remove the bad packages as they're untested.\n\n*Be concious of the software you use - Even if something might not be exactly the tool I am looking for if a package is in main I will tend to use it instead of software that might be in universe or a PPA. The more popular something is (or if it's in main) then I can be reasonably confident that it's more well tested than some obscure program. For example the resolver in aptitude is untested, so I don't use it.\n\n*Don't follow instructions on things that you don't understand as they might break things in an upgrade, especially if it's on a website that doesn't get updated or allow for community peer review. Unfortunately most \"linux tips\" websites publish this information with no regard to the consequences, especially with things that drastically changes parts of the operating system.\n\n*Participate with other community members on certain hardware. For example I have a Thinkpad so I follow along the Thinkpad mailing lists, this puts me in a pool of people who will give me the greatest chance of helping me if I need it. This is especially useful for laptops as you want to ensure that things like suspend and resume work perfectly.\n\n*Next time you purchase new hardware don't buy things that are known to be horrible with Linux support, especially if you had to do post-install fixes to make it work. Seek out hardware from companies that do support Linux and double check that the thing is supported well. \n\n*You don't have to upgrade right away - I have a friend who teaches at a University and as a general rule he doesn't upgrade on release, he upgrades at the end of that semester. He still gets a new version of Ubuntu on a regular basis, he's just \"off cycle\" a bit and upgrades after a bunch of fixes have already gone into that current stable release. \n\n*Test the version of Ubuntu you are upgrading to on a live CD first. confirm you hardware works (video card, monitors, wireless, etc).\n\n", "Q: Atheros AR9285 does not work on 11.10 I have installed the 11.10 and everything went smoothly.

What should I do? Do I need somthing called LAMP?\nI have seen this question on WordPress Answers, but I wonder if someone could provide instructions that are more Ubuntu specific or easier to follow, especially if they are relevant to the Unity interface.\n\nA: You can use sudo tasksel to install a local LAMP server.\nAfter selecting LAMP you can install it (you may need to scroll down the list to find the 'OK' button) and while installing, tasksel will ask you for the password for the MySQL installation (which is very important not to forget!).\nThen you can open your browser and type http://localhost and you should see It works.\n\nA: 2016 solution \nA very good guide can be found from mentioned urls at the bottom.\nHere is a breakdown for you,\ninstall mysql\nsudo apt-get install mysql-server php5-mysql\n\nInstall Apache\nsudo apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-php5\n\nafter installing mysql and apache you should get localhost up and running.

I am going to start a project soon, and want to make sure all libs are included that are not natively installed. Is there a way to check this without compiling on a clean machine?\n\nA: If you're building a .deb package, you can use pbuilder to do a test build. Since pbuilder builds in a clean chroot environment, it's a bit like building on a clean machine, without the hassle.

Specifically KDE on Ubuntu On one of my laptops, I installed all of the popular DEs because I like to experiment with them.  I have Unity, GNOME Shell, KDE, and xfce all installed.  It seems that KDE and GNOME don't \"get along\", and makes things messed up such as words and characters on the screen.  Also, it appears that some applications get mixed up with each other.  Is there any way to make the DEs less \"messy\"?  -  Ubuntu 11.10\nAlso, is there a way to install KDE in a way that DOESN'T install a bunch of other stuff that isn't needed.  Such as the KDE sentences...  They aren't needed since I already have the GNOME applications.  Also, when you install KDE it also changes the shutdown and startup screen to Kubuntu instead of Ubuntu.  \nIn response to a comment on my question, I tried to install KDE-core but I could not find it.  And will installing KDE mess up the fonts in my other DEs?\n\nA: I think that if you want to experiment with different Desktop Environments it is perhaps best to do that on virtual machines rather than the computer you use all the time. \nEach DE installs so many other programs you're bound to get some clashes, and certainly lots of alternative apps you probably don't want (how many office apps do you need?)\n\nA: Check this page, it shows how to get an uniform look for Gnome and KDE apps\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Uniform_Look_for_Qt_and_GTK_Applications\n\nA: To install KDE without a lot of other stuff, depending on which other stuff you don't want installed, you could probably do:\nsudo apt-get --no-install-recommends install <KDE package name>\n\n\nA: For plymouth option see this page too.By this way you can change which logo should come on booting ubuntu.\n\nA: You can install only the kde-plasma-desktop or plasma-desktop package in Ubuntu, they give you the basic desktop environments needed for kde. I think kde-plasma-desktop is better, since it is more parent package for plasma-desktop and not bigger than it's child (plasma-desktop).\nAs for the startup and shutdown screen, enter the following commands in terminal. If you have already installed the kubuntu-desktop package.\nsudo apt-get remove plymouth-theme-kubuntu-logo plymouth-theme-kubuntu-text.\nYou can also install the packages with names starting with kde-config-xxxx, since they provide the volume control, networking_applet, bluetooth and other system-configuration functionality for the KDE. \nDon't forget the kde-config-gtk package and gtk3-engines-oxygen, gtk2-engines-oxygen and optionally oxygen-moleculepackages. They provide you the uniform look and feel in KDE and GNOME. (\nPrevents ugly look of Gnome apps, when opened in KDE).\nYou can install other recommended packages as per your need by \n\n\n*\n\n*opening the synaptic package manager, \n\n*search for kubuntu-desktop package in the search bar, \n\n*right clicking on the package name, pointing the mark recommended for Installation list, \n\n*and selecting a package from newly appeared sub-menu. \n\n\nNote: From my experience, I see that, after opening firefox in KDE, when you open it again in GNOME, you will get ugly looking font-rendering of firefox. This happens because KDE use Full hinting style, where Gnome use Slight hinting style. To prevent this,\n\n\n*\n\n*delete the file in your home directory with name .fonts.conf after login in Gnome session \n\n*or edit the file with replacing hintmedium with value hintslight.\n\n\nHope this will help.\n\nIf don't like to remove kubuntu-logo splash screen\nIf you simply want to switch to ubuntu splash screen, you can do this by entering following in terminal\nsudo update-alternatives --config default.plymouth and selecting ubuntu-logo.plymouth by entering associated number. This will restore Ubuntu splash screen.\nYou must enter sudo update-initramfs -u command following the previous command, to save the change.\n", "Q: How to pay for an app in Software Center I have seen several apps that cost an amount in Software Center to adquire them. So I have some questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How does one pay for this apps?\n\n*What currency is supported?\n\n*What methods of payments are supported?\n\n*How does the system know I am the one that paid for a app if I format the PC. Is there a way to store the app I bought?\n\n\nA: If you pay for the app, it's handled through your Ubuntu Single Sign-on account. You have a username and password (which can be the same as Launchpad).\nI don't know what payment options are available, since I've only downloaded free apps that use that system. Upon payment, you get what amounts to a special PPA with the program.\nThere's a menu item that will let you restore previously-purchased items. I think it just adds the PPA and installs the package.\n", "Q: Cannot load plugins in current version of Calibre The filter for loading downloaded plugins in Calibre seems to be broken.  \nThe official manual for creating plugins says that plugins should bi in zip format with the appropriate init.py file. However the filter on the GUI for loading plugins (Preferences -> Plugins (under advanced) -> Load plugins from file) puts up a filter for filetypes of type \"Plugins\" and doesn't display any files.  This seems to be an error in the configuration, but I do not know how to fix it.  I'm using the version of Calibre in the current Ubuntu release repositories (0.8.8), unity interface.  The problem has been documented elsewhere and it suggests this has been fixed in the most recent version, but I'm not sure what the best solution is (e.g. I'd rather not use versions of packages setup outside the Ubuntu package manager that won't receive the automatic updates, etc).\nAny suggestions for the best work-around?\n\nA: *\n\n*Ctrl+c downloaded plugin file in Nautilus\n\n*Ctrl+v in \"Load plugins from file\" dialog window\n\n\nFor now, it's only solution to do it in GUI without using command-line solution ...\n\nA: I accidentally found a better workaround.\nI opened the folder contents where the plugins were downloaded. I then chose the plugin I wanted and dragged it into the Calibre add-plugin-from-file dialog window. Voila! ALL the contents (i.e. all the other plugins as well) appeared in the Calibre dialog window. The \"plugin\" file-type filter also greyed out. This is obviously a Calibre bug.\nTry it.

Literally, monitors connected by ethernet.\nXmonad is a window manager that is like Vim for your desktop. It manages your windows for you so you can focus on more important things like programming.\nWhen I go onto my computer, I first stop gnome with sudo service gdm stop and then run xinit & xmonad.

If someone has physical access to your computer (hard drive) they have root access, regardless of OS.\nThis is why they keep servers in locked rooms =)\nSecond best is an encrypted installation. That will make it difficult or impossible for someone with physical access to access your data, assuming the computer is shut off and they do not install a modified kernel.\nTo further refine my answer, now that you have asked about setting up a kiosk ..\nFirst, you need root access via some mechanism, sudo or su, take you pick, to perform system administration. Since completely disabling sudo , su, or all root access is unrealistic. With what you have posted, I would look at locking down your kiosk with apparmor (take a look at the apparmor profile for the gurest account as a template).\nIf you do not know how to use apparmor, use a distro that is built as a kiosk. Why re-creating the wheel?\nOptions here \n1) Use Ubuntu with the guest account. The guest account is confined by apparmor:\nhttp://dangertux.wordpress.com/2011/11/22/341/\n2) There are other options\nFedora makes a kiosk spin, locked down with selinux\nhttp://spins.fedoraproject.org/kiosk/#home\n3) Other distors\nhttp://webconverger.org/\n\nA: You can't get rid of sudo the way you think, but you can explicitly define what users are allowed to do, all the way from disallowing sudo through to requiring passwords for particular commands.

On a regular basis I forget to add && shutdown -h now to a long-running process. Is there any way to add a shutdown -h now command after the first command was invoked? It is not intended to interrupt the ongoing process. Maybe it is possible to watch the PID?\n\nA: I do this all the time.\n\n\n*\n\n*Start the process.\n\n*Realize that I forgot to do my && command.\n\n*Hit Ctrl+Z to suspend the process and return to the shell.\n\n*Run fg && shutdown -h now to:\n\n*\n\n*Foreground and resume the process you just suspended.\n\n*Then, after it finishes, it'll run what you wanted to run.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can poll as suggested in other answers like this:\nwhile ps -p $PID ; do sleep 5 ; done ; shutdown -h now\n\n\nA: You could do something like this, which will check whether the process is running every 5 seconds and take appropriate action:\nwhile true; do\n  if ps -ef | grep -q '[l]ong-running-process'; then\n    sleep 5\n  else\n    sudo poweroff\n  fi\ndone\n\nNote the square brackets in the grep expression.

Does compiling a downloaded linux kernel (e.g 3.2) make the OS (e.g ubuntu) faster on that specific machine?\n\nA: In my experience yes. But the benefits mainly come from eliminating unnecessary features, and selecting a few others, such as your processor type. Also, make it a ultra low latency for desktop use. I've been compiling the kernel for years and for me the difference is always noticeable. But there are other benefits. Boot times are also improved.\nHowever, it's very time consuming to get to select only the options you need.\n\nA: In general , no.\nThere are, however, some exceptions to \"no\". For example the liquorix kernel or Ubuntu kernel Flavors. These are generally performance tuning and can make a difference (the server kernel is faster for servers, and will not improve desktop performance).\nWith Ubuntu, if you are running the proper kernel flavor, you should be good to go.\nNote: The Liquorix kernel also has some patches (in addition to performance tuning).\nThe other exception would be if you have some unusual hardware.\nBut in the vast majority of cases, performance is not a \"standard\" reason to compile a kernel.\nSee:\nUbuntu wiki compile kernel\n\nA: The most accurate answer is, as bodhi.zazen said, not usually but with a few exceptions.  Most of those exceptions are hardware related, but some are just configuration issues.  Justification for my answer follows.\nI've compiled twenty-six kernels between two machines in the last month attempting to performance tweak.  What I found:\n\n\n*\n\n*Changing cpu type in .config to the native architecture and removing options that support other architectures improved file I/O throughput by more than 10% in benchmarks (enough I can \"feel the improvement\") and reduced delay following user input in XFCE on Xubuntu 12.04 -32bit on my 1.8GHz (K8) Mobile Sempron 512MB RAM laptop.  The same changes had no quantifiable or perceivable impact on my 1.73GHz Core2 Duo 2GB RAM laptop in Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit, but did cause one formerly stable application to become crash prone.\n\n*Changing HZ in .config to 1000 dramatically improved responsiveness to user input when under high CPU load in both systems.  It also made window focus changes in X instantaneous in all conditions.\n\n*The BFS patch increased battery life in both systems by a few minutes.  Just enough to be measurable and consist, but not enough to matter much.  Benchmarks revealed no statistically significant performance changes, but both systems \"feel\" faster.  I suspect this has to do with scheduling priority being more beneficial to the typical workloads on those specific machines.\n\n*All other .config combinations tried resulted in decreased performance on both systems.\n\n\nI spent ridiculous sums of time compiling and testing different configurations.  For all that, only five kernels produced a desireable result, out of twenty-six attempted.  Seven kernels were not even operable (either unbootable or failed to start X).  I recently installed the Liquorix kernel from repository and netted all the above improvements plus a roughly 50% frame rate increase in both the Windows games I play through WINE on the Core2 system.  That only took a few minutes, and nothing broke.\nIs my OS better because I compiled my own kernel?  Well, yeah a little.  Until I find something that runs slower/breaks, because I failed to find it during testing.  Is my OS faster?  No.\n\nA: I don't know how about kernel, but in general compiling apps from source usually makes them work faster (I usually do it with dev libs like CGAL, or apps like ParaView). Of course when compiling process is optimized for the architecture and so on.\nHowever I don't think that compiling a kernel would make it faster that much that it had a visible influence on the performance. In my opinion it would only be visible in performance counters.\n\nA: I compiled a kernel for an EeePC 900A just to remove unnecessary drivers and features, to boot without extra initrd, to set the default I/O scheduler, to optimize for Atom, and to disable debugging and some performance- and responsiveness-degrading power-saving features. (it's being used as server for various little things). Less boot time needed^^\nAbout one year ago I tried it before, but Chromium only showed blank Web pages - with clickable links...\n", "Q: How To Change Login Screen Background On 11.10 \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I change the wallpaper in LightDM? \n\nHow do i change the background of the login screen on 11.10 i have tried Simple-lightDM-Manager and now all i get is a black screen with dots and the logo\n\nA: It's in the file /etc/lightdm/unity-greeter.conf.

Double-check that it's on \"enabled\". Also, try rmmod dell-laptop, and see if the rfkill status changes. If so, please let me know, as this shouldn't happen on this laptop model.\nAs for the wired network, that should work out of the box and with no problems.

Then plug in the cable and look at the log output, to see exactly what happens when you connect this.

After installing AMD Catalyst driver 12.1 on my laptop, it worked after a few tweaks. I was jumping with joy prematurely because the driver finally worked, only to find out later after a reboot that the proprietary driver went nuts yet again (same with the earlier AMD graphics drivers last year I've tried).  \nAs usual when using fglrx I get a black screen instead of GDM, and if I do manage to get to a desktop I get the error from AMDCCCLE control panel that it cannot initialize because the device or driver is not found (something like that). So going back, Ctrl+Alt+F* keys are useless.  After a couple reboots with the same result, I continued to recovery mode and deleted all fglrx related installs. I proceeded to reinstall  a few packages as suggested on this page - http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Natty_Installation_Guide#Removing_Catalyst.2Ffglrx. \nNote that I've done this several times without issues but the flgrx drivers.

Try tracing the process, and see what happens:\nstrace -f ./h_affine.ln -haraff -i img1.ppm -o img1.haraff -thres 1000\n\nCapture the output, search for \"exec\", and see if there are any clues about what the problem was. Basically, strace just lists all the kernel calls a program uses as it runs. This is very handy because all the things you imagine a program doing (messing with data, etc.) is just internal detail - strace captures everything it actually does.\n", "Q: Cannot install libsyck0-dev I've been trying to follow this tutorial to install Nginx but my Ubuntu 11.10 cannot install libsyck0-dev.

In Ubuntu 11.10 the package libsyck0-dev doesn't exist any more so you can't install it.\nIf you just want to install Nginx you can use the package from the official package sources. If that doesn't fit your needs for some reason try to find a tutorial that's written for a more recent version of Ubuntu. \nQuite likely not only Ubuntu but some of the software it describes has changed in the 3 years since the tutorial has been written, too.\n", "Q: How do you see what packages are available for update FreeBSD user joining your ranks.  I've been asked to look after an Ubuntu Server running 10.04 LTS.   \nI see from /usr/lib/update-notifier/update-motd-updates-available that there are a number of updates on the server however I do not see a way to tell which will be updated.\nWould anyone be able to point me in the right direction so as I can see which packages will get updated when I run apt-get upgrade?\nUPDATE:\nCan't answer my own question at the moment so throwing this in here for the time being:\nAlong with the apt-get upgrade --dry-run suggested below, \n/usr/lib/update-notifier/apt-check -p will list all packages that have updates available.\n\nA: You could install aptitude if it isn't already installed. It's a great tool for managing packages in a headless setup.\n\nOtherwise if you just want to see what's going to happen when you run something, use the --dry-run argument and it won't actually do anything, it'll just tell you what it would do:\nFrom the apt-get man page\n\n-s, --simulate, --just-print, --dry-run, --recon, --no-act\n          No action; perform a simulation of events that would occur but do\n          not actually change the system.

Reference: aptitude user's manual\nBy default, aptitude search shows for each package its name, description and a few flags, but you could also adapt the output to your needs. For example, to list only the package names, the command would be:\naptitude search -F '%p' --disable-columns '~U'\n\n(--disable-columns avoids padding whitespace at the end of the lines)\n\nA: As of now (Ubuntu 16.04) you can use apt list with the --upgradable flag;\nsudo apt update\napt list --upgradable\n\nand you will get a list with all upgradable packages.\n", "Q: Automatically mark emails as read in Evolution 3.2.2?

They all have folder.svg in them so I'm not sure what to change.\nAlso - my icon is a .png file, how do I convert it to .svg?\nThanks\n\nA: You can't convert .png to .svg as far as I know but if you can find a .svg file of the icon which you want, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your theme's Places folder may not be the right location. If you can find \"folder.svg\" in there that's ok but if you can't, you should open your theme's \"index.theme\" file with gedit and then check its Inheritences's Places folders. It should be in the folder named \"16\".\n\n*When you find \"folder.svg\" as an original file, not a link, change its name as \"folder.svg.backup\" and then copy your .svg file to here and name it \"folder.svg\".\n\n*Make a link your new \"folder.svg\", copy and paste it to all other folders in your theme's Places folder. Don't forget to make these links' names \"folder.svg\"\n\n*When you log out and come back, your folder icon must be changed.\n\n\nCheck out these answers to convert .png to .svg as mentioned in the comments.\n\nA: Based on my experience changing the folder.svg icon :\nFirst of all you can use a folder.png file, rename it into folder.svg and be done.\nSecond there is a folder.icon file in the .../places/48 (default nautilus zoom is 48) that for some reason might index and cache the file for shorter loading times which I removed until I restarted nautilus to see changes applied to size 48.\nNautilus uses the appropriate icon size for the appropriate display size (zoom) of folders in nautilus seemingly to save loading times. So if you only change .../scalable/folder.svg it will only apply to the \"unused\" big and tiny sizes. You will need to see which sizes are still the old icon and replace these too.\nWarning: I think you need to kill nautilus and restart it to refresh changes and also it won't start anymore if it doesn't find a folder.svg file.\nThis is the result for size 48 :\n\n", "Q: Disable Ubuntu One FaceBook Sync I have a question about the Facebook sync.

However how can I access the Menu via in hotkey when I use Gnome?\n\nA: Its the same hotkey in both Unity and Gnome-shell\nIn Unity, press and hold Alt to display the Global menu - then press the corresponding shortcut key - for example Alt+F\n \nIn Gnome-Shell - likewise, use the same key-combination.\n\n", "Q: Can I mount single folders in a 2nd HD to a master folder I have on my main HD? Essentially I have a server setup as a media device running MuthTV for my main tv off the Ubuntu comp and then I have several other PC's in the house which connect to the shared folder of my server to watch from the other TVs.\nTo make things look nice and organized within both Myth and my folders I divided stuff up as such, a main Video folder which is shared and within it a Movie, TV, Stand Up, Music Videos etc.. I previously ran out of space on the main HD and bought a new one, what I did then was transfered the entire Movie folder to the new HD and mounted it in the Video folder as 'Movies' essentially not messing with my organizational scheme.\nHowever, now its my TV folder which is almost too big to sit on a HD by itself without allowing for room to grow.  So what I want to do now is get another HD and instead of mounting the entire HD in the Video folder somewhere, to put it elsewhere and just mount folders I have put in the new HD to the TV folder.. essentially meaning I could have 'The Big Bang Theory' appear in my TV folder but actually be located on the new HD.. I also would like to have many different shows folders come off that new HD essentially mounting many folders to that TV folder.. if that makes sense.  I am not sure mounting is the word I am looking for for how to accomplish this but I wasn't sure what other methods there were.  Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Each disk partition has an identifier, i.e. /dev/sda1, /dev/sdb2 and so on. You can mount, or map, any of these to any \"point\" on the filesystem, point meaning a \"directory\". So what you want can be achieved no problem.\nSay the new hard disk you add is /dev/sdc1 (I'm thinking since you have 3 hard disks already, but please change if your drive letter is different). In a nutshell, you'd have to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount the new device manually in /mnt: sudo mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt\n\n*Copy stuff from the old folder to the new device: cp -a /Videos/TV/* /mnt\n\n*Move the old folder out of the way (don't delete yet, until you're sure it's all working well): mv /Videos/TV /Videos/old-TV\n\n*unmount new device: sudo umount /mnt\n\n*Create mount point (empty directory to which the new device will be attached): mkdir /Videos/TV\n\n*mount new device to mount point: sudo mount /dev/sdc1 /Videos/TV\nIf you now go to /Videos/TV you should see all the files you have in the new device. Also, if you issue the df -h command, you should see a list of devices, space usage and mount points.\nNote that in order to make step 6 permanent, you need to add an entry in /etc/fstab:\n/dev/sdc1 /Videos/TV  ext4  defaults  0  0\n\n", "Q: How to rsync a folder when the folder path contains special chars?

Some applications use web services to provide services to users (especially Unity lenses). Things with APIs that might change, or things that might be updated. So what happens when someone submits a Reddit Lens and then a week later it breaks and it needs to be updated? \nIs there a process where I as an application author can update my application in the software center independent of the Ubuntu release cycle?\n\nA: Definitely. If you are an app author who has submitted an application to the Software Centre through the My Apps web interface on the Ubuntu App Developer Site, you can distribute updates following this easy process:\n\n\n*\n\n*Updating your app in the Software Centre\n\nA: Probably try to update in Github, Its will support all Linux.\nNot specially Ubuntu. \n -\n\n\n*\n\n*You will get more response and \n   2.you will reduce your app bug also. so more advantages.\n\n", "Q: What should I think about before using one partition as /home for two different systems? My situation is as follows:\nUbuntu with GNOME-Shell installed on /dev/sda3, with it's own /home directory.\nLubuntu installed on /dev/sda5, with it's own /home directory.\nData files (music, movies, stuff for school) stored on /dev/sda4.\nI use both Ubuntu and Lubuntu and I would like to keep this setup of two different partitions, instead of one partition with both Ubuntu and lubuntu-desktop installed on  it.\nI would like to use /dev/sda4 as a /home partition for both Ubuntu and Lubuntu. This would have quite some advantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*Applications in Lubuntu and Ubuntu would always be up-to-date with each other because they share the same ~/.config directory\n\n*Right now, I usually save stuff in /dev/sda4, but as this is not my real /home directory, I usually have to refer to /dev/sda4 in a lot of applications when e.g. saving something. This annoys me, I'd like to just be able to save it in my /home directory.\n\n\nIn this question, I've read the second and third answer, about problems that might appear. But as I'm planning to use both Ubuntu 12.04 and Lubuntu 12.04, I doubt that there will be any problems, as these distributions are very much alike, and they are released on approximately the same date (so it's not like using Ubuntu 12.04 and Lubuntu 10.04).\nIs there anything I should be aware of before implementing this setup?\nWould there be any consequences, other than the ones I just mentioned? \nIs there a way to get approximately the same results, in a safer way?\n\nA: You should be just fine sharing a home directory as you are. My opinion would be that you are sort of going about it the hard way, I would use a single install with both lxde and ubuntu-desktop, but if it works for you, well that is the advantage of Linux, you have choice.\nYou alternates would be it either use a shared data directory, and sync config files as needed or use a  unique user name for each distro (with the same /home).\n", "Q: Take text from a file and insert to a mysql table using a script I would like to take data (some text) from a file and insert it into a mysql field, using a script.\nI have tried:\nmysql -u root -p password dbname << INSERT INTO tblename (fieldname) VALUES (LOAD_FILE('filename'));\n\nand\nmysql -u root -p password dbname << EOF INSERT INTO tblename (fieldname) VALUES ('$filename'); EOF\n\n\nA: Not strictly Ubuntu related, but you want LOAD DATA INFILE, the documentation of which can be found at:\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/load-data.html\nProbably something like..\necho \"LOAD DATA INFILE 'filename' INTO TABLE tblename;\" | mysql -u root -p password dbname\n\nYou could also use dbname.tblename and then drop dbname from the mysql command, they'll be equivalent.\n", "Q: Most appropriate desktop environment for corporate desktop I have deployed a few Ubuntu 10.04 LTS systems for small business users. It uses Gnome 2 DE and users are happy with it. With upcoming new LTS release I have a problem - default DE Unity is not suitable for small business environment. Most work is done with LibreOffice programs, internet browser, email client and file manager. Current options are either Kubuntu or Xubuntu. Each option has its own drawbacks - KDE might be too complicated and have some desktop compositing problems on low end systems, while Xubuntu lacks some features as it is preconfigured with alternative, lighter, software.\nAre there any other options of stable and supported desktop environments?\n\nA: If your users are used to Gnome 2 I would recommend opting for Ubuntu and then installing 'gnome-session', this will allow users to choose the Gnome 3 fall-back mode at login which is similar to Gnome 2 in appearance and functions with all Gnome applications.\n\nA: I'd strongly suggest going for Xubuntu.

They have been ignored, or old\n  ones used instead.\n\n\nA: With issues like this, you can usually narrow down the problem by looking at the errors as a result of running:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nWith your latest update to your question you can see a 404-error which indicates that a web-page cannot be accessed (a 404 is a standard web-response).  In this case, the elementaryArt PPA is not accessible.  Usually this is a server issue - which disappears if the server comes back-on line.\nHowever, in this case, if you look on launchpad, the PPA in question does not have an oneiric repository.\nAs to why you get untrusted packages error - usually this is because the signature for a repository needs to be updated or is temporarily unavailable.\nIn your specific case, the repo-keys have been \"refreshed\" via the update/upgrade action.  \nIf you at a later date receive errors such as BAD-SIG and/or NO_PUBKEY you can fix these via the linked questions below\n\nLinked Questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I fix the GPG error \"NO_PUBKEY\"?\n\n*What is the easiest way to resolve apt-get BADSIG GPG errors?\n", "Q: Nvidia vs. Battery Dilemma I recently purchased a LG a410 notebook, with Nvidia GeForce 310M GPU.\nWhen i installed Ubuntu (11.10) my battery used to last about 3 hours.\nBut, since i moved to Gnome3, i noticed that i didnt have the proper graphics driver installed.\nSo, i installed the Nvidia drivers, and everything, including 3d works perfect. The problem is: my battery now lasts only for less than 1 hour.\nI have read on some forums that Nvidia Drivers are known to consume more battery power. Since my GPU does not seem to have the \"optimus\" technology, there is no use to try the \"bumblebee project\".\nI had the idea to add to grub the option of loading OR NOT the nvidia graphics. This way, when i wanted to save battery, i would boot into the \"no nvidia mode\". But i have had no success on disabling the Nvidia drivers.\nI have tried to add it to the /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf as \"blacklist nvidia\", \"blacklist nvidia-common\", and \"blacklist nvidiabl\" but nothing seems to work.\nIs there a way i can choose between booting WITH or WITHOUT the nvidia drivers??\nObs: changing the xorg.conf file to Driver \"nv\"  or Driver \"intel\" does not work (x does not start)\n\nA: Have a look at Choose at GRUB menu whether NVidia driver should be used for creating a boot option to stop the nvidia driver from being loaded.\nnv is a very old opensource driver, superseded by the nouveau driver. That's why setting it does not work for recent hardware.\nAfter blacklisting modules in /etc/modprobe.d you need to run sudo update-initramfs -u to get the blacklist during boot.\n", "Q: Notebook MSI GT640 - noisy fan - Ubuntu 11.10 x64 I have all time this issue when using Ubuntus, the fan (fans?) runs most off the time and between 60%~100% even in idle which is weird. The GPU temperatures are mostly around 80 degrees and I don't think it's right :(\nI always use Jupiter with power saving preset and add the line in linux default like this:\nquiet splash pcie_aspm=force i915.i915_enable_rc6=1\n\nSo it helps a little (fan just doesn't run all the time 100%...)\nWhat else can I do?\nThe notebook spec is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Core i7-720 (8 threads)\n\n*NVIDIA GTS250M\n\n\nSo it's rather one of the first, not so silent and cold notebooks;), with Core i7 family and without optimus technology (as nvidia GPU is the only graphic card built-in) but anyway I don't have theese strange hot times in Windows 7.\n\nA: I'm sorry to only add upon this complaint, but I have the exact same issue and have had even larger issues with other distro's. I wanted to know if this had anything to do with the new 2nd gen i7 / the threading or architecture , or just another HP heat issue. It is depressing because I worry about physical damage at the temp it runs at under medium load and may have to consider switching to VM for the mean time. \n", "Q: where is adobe acrobat reader I wanted to make it easier to use some programs. I wanted them to be on my desktop.  I found them using Dash and dragged them to the desktop.  When I now try to execute them, I get the message that they are not trusted applications.  I searched and found a post that says to Right click - Properties - Permissions and check Make executable.  The problem is that I can't because I am not the owner - root is.  How do I fix this?\nIf I drag it from an executable place, it should be executable in the new place.\n\nA: First make sure you've installed acroread with the Software Center or Synaptic -- it will be installed as executable. Right click any PDF file and acroread should be an option to open with although it's likely not the default which will be Document Viewer. If you select Preferences you'll be able to use the Open With tab to make acroread the default. It sounds like you were trying to drag a PDF file onto an Adobe Acrobat Reader icon to open it. I'm not sure that will even work, depends on the application. Normally you wouldn't place an application on the desktop or in the launcher, you'd be dragging a .desktop file that launches the application. Those .desktop launchers are located in /usr/share/applications. There you'll find a launcher you can drag to the launch bar or copy and paste on the Desktop.\n", "Q: Unable to connect my dell bh200 blue tooth head set Hi I am using dell studio laptop with ubuntu 11.04 and very recently I bought dell bh 200 blue tooth head set but I am not able to connect and pair with my laptop, a quick googling showed few examples for setting it up I amnot able to find ALSA in the sound settings so that Ican listen to the music, how do I set it up, kindly help me out\n\nA: This is a bug in bluez which still shows incomplete in the tracker.\n", "Q: How do I download things from the source repository? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I get the source code of packages installed through apt-get? \n\nI want to look over some programs to help me learn programming, so I enabled the source repository in Ubuntu.

I had a feeling it's because Ubuntu isn't taking full advantage of my graphics card so i went to install the additional drivers. The normal proprietery one does nothing to help the window issue and everytime i try and install the post release update it says \"Sorry Installation of this driver failed\"\n\nA: I can't comment on the failed post-release update in the restricted drivers tool, but I have experienced the laggy windows and I read that you can un-tick \"Sync to VBlank\" in the OpenGL module in the General section of ccsm (if you don't have ccsm, sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager, then just run \"ccsm\").  I also read this affects mostly ATI cards.\n\nA: If you have an ATI Graphics card, you can't install the post-release-update one because the fglrx-updates ubuntu package is broken (bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/fglrx-installer/+bug/949641)\nI also got that problem.  So I went ahead and installed the normal one.  It does not fix the laggy windows on my computer, and it also caused my computer to become unstable. (Reported Bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/fglrx-installer/+bug/995184)\nSo I'll just wait until the fglrx-updates package is fixed.

In a browser I assume some server side magic happens to make this work. Is there an incantation I can use to emulate what my browser does? can curl do this? \n\nA: By default, the filename of the URL is used as the target filename. If redirection occurs, it is preferable to use the final filename. That can be accomplished with the --trust-server-names option of wget:\nwget --trust-server-names http://example.com/file.php\n\nFrom the manual page of wget:\n\n--trust-server-names\n   If this is set to on, on a redirect the last component of the redirection\n  URL will be used as the local file name.  By default it is used the last\n  component in the original URL.\n\nIf the target filename is not what you intended, you can use the -O (long option: --output-document) option as in:\nwget http://example.com/file.php -O meh.tar.gz\n\n\nA: The \"magic\" is server side, not in the browser, so you just wget or curl the url.\n", "Q: I killed my GUI and Startx cant find a \"screen\" First off let me mention that this problem happened a while ago so i may have forgotten some of the details.

Basically, I want to have Ubuntu 11.10 play sounds when events occur, like adding and removing a USB or FireWire device, when it finds hardware, pops up a notification, or mounts a new volume. Like how KDE and Windows does that. Is there a program or a daemon that can monitor for this stuff, or can it be doe a different way?\n\nA: You can customize the built-in Ubuntu sound scheme by replacing the files located in /usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo.  As far as making Ubuntu play a sound when a drive is mounted there's not really a 'neat' way to do that.  However, if you were to change the autorun settings (system settings -> Removable Media) to a script that plays a sound file and then mounts the drive that would do the trick, but I don't think that's the \"right\" way to go about it.\n", "Q: Reset Amarok version I'm running Ubuntu 10.04 and I tried Amarok.\nIt was quite cool, but I wanted to try the latest version so I typed into the console:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nworked so far I got an updated version now. \nBut the problem is this version is not very compatible to Ubuntu 10.04 and many features aren't working properly...\nHow can I change it back?\n\nA: Downgrade from the PPA\n:~$ apt-cache show ppa-purge\n\n\nDescription: disables a PPA and reverts to official packages \nThis program disables a PPA from your Software Sources and reverts\n  your system back to the official Ubuntu packages.

I have a Dell Server on which I've been running Microsoft Server 2008, I want to turn it into a simple home server for file sharing and media streaming.  I'm fairly new to Linux, but understand a lot.  \nI want to know which would be the easiest for a noob to install and get up and running.\nI have two hard drives, a 250Gb and a 1Tb, I'll be installing the OS on the 250Gb drive and don't mind loosing the rest of the space if necessary, as I'll be using the 1Tb drive for file storage. The other two computers on my network are running Windows Vista and I plan on keeping it that way (at least for now).\nI'm leaning toward Desktop as it will have a GUI, and make things a little more familiar for me...then I just have to load additional 'apps' to get the full server functionality right?\nWhich is the best OS version (or what do I need to make sure I'm running) to make this machine discoverable and compatible with the Windows machines?\n\nA: If you aren't planning to turn it into a Lamp Server (Linux Apache Mysql PHP) and just want to use it to share files on a local network I don't see any advantage of you installing the Server edition. The regular desktop version will easily suffice for that. But it's also important to note that the Server edition can quite easily have a GUI installed on it was well to make administration slightly easier. \n\nA: Managing servers for the most part involved editing configuration files and thus many people manage servers with ssh using nano and command line tools.\nIf you are unfamiliar with the command line, the desktop can be somewhat helpful, but here you will be using gedit and nautilus, and still editing configuration files.\nIMO, if you want a graphical interface, it is better to web tool, such as webmin or pphmyadmin which will give you an actual graphical interface to the server configuration.\nhttp://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-install-webmin-on-ubuntu-11-04-natty-server.html\nhttp://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/index.php\nThe other potential advantage of the server edition is that it has the server kernel , which will give you better performance then the desktop kernel\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/Dev/Flavours\nTo get you started with servers, see the Ubuntu server guide\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/C/index.html\n\nA: Thanks for the feedback folks...\nI went ahead and installed Ubuntu Desktop 11.10 and messed around with folder sharing permissions got everything working.  \nThe OS installation ended up taking longer than accessing the folders!\nI'm satisfied so far!\nI'm sure I'll be trolling around the forum reading posts and asking for advice in the future, responses were so quick!\n", "Q: Can I remove the gwibber packages without removing ubuntu-desktop?

I know you'll ask \"Slow compared to what?\"  It's slow compared to Ubuntu 10.  And it's much slower when compared to Windows 7 on the same system.\nI'm using a Dell Latitude E6400, with a 2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo CPU, Nvidia Quadro NVS 160M, and 6 gigs of RAM.  I have a high speed 1 TB disk, with plenty of empty space.\nHas anyone observed this?  Are there any people out there with the same hardware whose systems are very fast?  Thanks.\n\nA: It can be any number of reasons. Compiz is being rewritten, and it seems to be a little slower, currently. Linux has had some issues as well. \nIt's very difficult to say exactly what it is. What I can tell you is that you're not imagining it, and that Precise is very much faster and cooler. 11.10 in particular has been rather slow and hot. There's been major transitional work done, so maybe that's contributed to it as well. In any case, 12.04 is going to fix those things. The improvements are already more than noticeable. \n\nA: I had an abnormally slow experience on a computer with an older graphics card until I set my profile to use Unit 2d,  After that ut was back to normal.\n\nA: Same problem here in dell inspiron n5110 with nvidia gt525m...

I just got a message from the default disk analyses software (Baobab)\nthat I only have 1GB left on the hard drive.

Or is that a BIG NO NO in Ubuntu?\n\nA: Deleting /var/log is probably a bad idea, but deleting the individual logfiles should be OK.\nOn my laptop, with a smallish SSD disk, I set up /var/log (and /tmp and /var/tmp) as tmpfs mount points, by adding the following lines to /etc/fstab:\ntemp        /tmp        tmpfs   rw,mode=1777    0   0\nvartmp      /var/tmp    tmpfs   rw,mode=1777    0   0\nvarlog      /var/log    tmpfs   rw,mode=1777    0   0\n\nThis means that nothing in those directories survives a reboot.  As far as I can tell, this setup works just fine.  Of course, I lose the ability to look at old logs to diagnose any problems that might occur, but I consider that a fair tradeoff for the reduced disk usage.\nThe only problem I've had is that some programs (most notably APT) want to write their logs into subdirectories of /var/log and aren't smart enough to create those directories if they don't exist.  Adding the line mkdir /var/log/apt into /etc/rc.local fixed that particular problem for me; depending on just what software you have installed, you may need to create some other directories too.\n(Another possibility would be to create a simple tar archive containing just the directories, and to untar it into /var/log at startup to create all the needed directories and set their permissions all at once.)\n\nA: You must not remove the entire folder but you can remove \"Old-Packed\" log files without harming your system.\nFor a typical home user, it's safe to remove any log file that is compressed and has a .gz extension (as you can see in the picture).\nThese compressed log files are old logs that are gzipped to reduce storage space, and as an average user, you don't need them.\n\n\nA: I had and issue with enormous log files (like 100G each) with some useless messages from gnome 'cannot find video buffer' or something. Doing:\n\nsudo rm -rf /var/log/user.log\nsudo rm -rf /var/log/syslog\nsudo rm -rf /var/log/messages\n\ndid not solve the problem, but doing \nsystemctl restart syslog.service\nright after freed space used by those files.\n\nA: I wouldn't delete the entire /var/log folder - that will break things.\nYou could just destroy the logs as @jrg suggests - but unless the things writing to the log files (mostly syslogd) are restarted that won't actually regain you any disk space, as the files will continue to exist in a deleted state until the filehandles are closed.\nBetter would be to find out why the logs aren't being rotated (and later deleted). logrotate is supposed to do this for you, and I suspect it's not being run each night as it should.\nFirst thing I would do would be:\nsudo /etc/cron.daily/logrotate\n\nThis should rotate the log files (so kern.log becomes kern.log.1); and you can then delete kern.log.1 etc to free up the disk space.\nIf everything is good so far, the next question is why this isn't happening automatically. If you turn your computer off at night, make sure you have anacron installed.\n\nA: I had a several GBytes /var/log folder that I made shrink to less than 250MBytes using both /etc/systemd/journald.conf and logrotate:\nconfig for journald: (cf man journald.conf)\nSystemMaxUse=250M\nSystemMaxFileSize=50M\n\nconfig for /etc/logrotate.conf:\ncompress\n\n/var/log/journal {\n    daily\n    dateext\n    delaycompress\n    copytruncate\n    notifempty\n    missingok\n    rotate 3\n    size 500k\n    sharedscripts\n}\n\nalso look into files in /etc/logrotate.d/*\n\nA: DISCLAIMER: I am not an expert on this, use at own risk!\nAfter finding that my /var/log/journal folder was taking several GB, I followed:\nhttps://ma.ttias.be/clear-systemd-journal/\njournalctl --vacuum-time=10d\n\nwhich cleared 90%+ of it\n\nA: You should look at the logs and see what is getting written to them. My guess is ufw/iptables (you are logging all network traffic).\nufw - when you log all packets, you will get large logs. If you are not going to review the logs, turn logging off. If you wish to monitor your network, use snort. Snort will filter through the thousands of packets you receive and alert you to potentially problematic traffic.\nMy guess it that ufw is the culprit and you are getting a large log in kern.log because you are logging packets there as well.\nSometimes there is a kernel or hardware problem that fills the logs. In that event it is best to fix the problem or file a bug, you will need to review the logs to do that.\nIf you can not fix the problem, you can configure syslog to as to not fill your logs.\nSee http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man5/syslog.conf.5.html\nIf you provide more details on the problem we can help debug it better.\n", "Q: Tool to backup repository list There is a utility called y-ppa-manager https://launchpad.net/y-ppa-manager which helps to manage your ppa repositories in ubuntu.

I have a huge number of photos, and I want to move just my /Pictures folder to a second SATA drive in my computer for performance reasons. I want everything to work as it is now, except that /Pictures will be by itself on the second drive.\n/Home (sda) and the second drive(sdb) are encrypted. For the primary drive, I chose the encrypted home option at install. Later, I added the second drive. I formatted it and chose encryption using the Disk Utility. I can reinstall if this all has to be done at once.\nWhat I tried so far was adding a symlink to the new drive from inside /Pictures, and using PySDM (to modify Fstab) to auto-mount the second drive at boot. Since the second drive is encrypted, this didn't work. It can't be mounted until I login and unlock the keychain with my password.  \nAlso, the symlink added an extra step in the file paths, which broke some custom links.\nln -s /media/Pix /home/tom/Pictures and all variations of this with and without trailing slashes give me either a link inside /Pictures, or no link at all. (possibly missing something simple here?) Drive 2 (sdb) is /Pix, and all my pictures are in folders at its root directory. I want to click on Pictures from my home folder in Nautilus, and be taken directly to the root directory of the second drive. This just isn't happening. I either get a new link inside /Pictures, or I'm taken to the empty /Pictures folder (on sda)\nWhat's the best way to do this? It's important to keep everything encrypted, and have /Pictures work just like if it was in /home. I also need my automatic backups to be collecting the photos in their new location.\n****Edits**\nI tried following RAOF's answer but I'm stuck now. Here's how far I got:\ncryptsetup was already installed, I edited it and copied the suggestion exactly, it now looks like this:  \n# <target name> <source device>     <key file>  <options>\ncryptswap1 /dev/sda2 /dev/urandom swap,cipher=aes-cbc-essiv:sha256\nsdb_crypt UUID=<redacted>-4ef3-a4ff-7c9db92025d7 none luks  \n\nI have an encrypted /home obviously, that's the other entry.\nls -lah /dev/disks/by-uuid\n\nsimply didn't work, I get \"ls: cannot access /dev/disks/by-uuid: No such file or directory\" \nls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid/\n\ndoes work, it's the method here on the Ubuntu help page\nThat gives me the following:\nls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid/\ntotal 0\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 2012-02-06 08:15 <redacted>-40ba-be89-9591daf722c9 -> ../../sdd1\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 2012-02-06 08:15 <redacted>-4ef3-a4ff-7c9db92025d7 -> ../../sdb1\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 2012-02-06 08:15 <redacted>-49da-bcca-879e44afe63c -> ../../sda1\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 2012-02-06 08:15 <redacted>-4cee-9ef7-c745ee596438 -> ../../dm-1\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 2012-02-06 08:15 <redacted>-48ed-9725-5179cd588c28 -> ../../dm-0\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 2012-02-06 08:15 <redacted>-4bb6-bf6e-197af4d6afdc -> ../../sdc1\n\nThe problem now is with fstab. I have tried several variations, and none work so far. Here's what I started with:\nUUID=<redacted>-4bb6-bf6e-197af4d6afdc /home ext4 defaults 0 2\nUUID=<redacted>-4ef3-a4ff-7c9db92025d7 /media/sdb1 crypto_LUKS noauto 0 0\nUUID=<redacted>-49da-bcca-879e44afe63c / ext4 defaults 0 1\nUUID=<redacted>-4cee-9ef7-c745ee596438 /media/Pix ext4 noauto 0 0\n\nwhich tries to mount the encrypted partition at boot, which is too early since I haven't entered my password yet. I removed the last line and changed the second entry to auto, like below.\nUUID=<redacted>-4bb6-bf6e-197af4d6afdc /home ext4 defaults 0 2\nUUID=<redacted>-4ef3-a4ff-7c9db92025d7 /media/sdb1 crypto_LUKS auto 0 0\nUUID=<redacted>-49da-bcca-879e44afe63c / ext4 defaults 0 1\n\nThis asked me for my passphrase for /sdb_crypt (with UUID) at GRUB, before I can even login.\n\nI entered the password for the drive but I guess passphrase=/=password, this failed. I restored the backup fstab from a live cd, but now but I don't understand how to \"edit /etc/fstab so that it mounts /dev/mapper/sdb_crypt in the right place.\" from RAOF's answer. Any ideas? And now I suspect I have more entries than I need in fstab, which to remove?\n\nA: If you want to set up the second drive at boot time then you can use cryptsetup to mount it as a part of the boot process.  That will prompt for the drive's passphrase during boot.  To do this, you should apt-get install cryptsetup (if it's not already installed), and then edit /etc/crypttab; it should look something like this:\nsdb_crypt /dev/sdb none luks\n\nAlthough, since the /dev/sd x names are not necessarily stable over hardware changes, I'd find out what the UUID of the drive is and use that.  You can find the UUID in /dev by running ls -lah /dev/disks/by-uuid.  You'll get output that includes something like:\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  10 Feb  2 17:30 deadbeef-baea-9233-1828-ae12b3ed4ff3e -> ../../sdb\n\nand from that you would add the following to /etc/crypttab:\nsdb_crypt UUID=deadbeef-baea-9233-1828-ae12b3ed4ff3e none luks\n\nHaving done that you'd edit /etc/fstab so that it mounts /dev/mapper/sdb_crypt in the right place.\nOnce you've got that set up, I'd just symlink ~/Pictures to wherever you've mounted sdb_crypt. There's no need to put a symlink in the existing Pictures directory.  You'll need to move all the existing files into your crypted directory, remove the existing Pictures directory, and then ln -s /where/you/mounted/sdb_crypt ~/Pictures to create the symlink.\nThe reason this is difficult is that this whole thing is basically a missing feature.  What you really want to do is to tell the desktop that it should auto-mount your drive when you log in - that would mean that you could easily do the same sort of thing with any gvfs-able mount: SMB, ssh, etc.  I guess patches would be welcome ☺.\n\nA: Have you tried turning the Pictures directory into a symlink to the new location? This saves the extra step in the file paths, everything stays in place.\nAlso, encrypted or not, I don't see why the second drive must be mounted at boot time. Wouldn't it be enough to have it mounted at login? To achieve this, the same procedure like mounting the home must be followed. The symlink ~/Pictures will be dead before the mount completes, but this is (given a correct implementation of the mount process) just during login, after mounting ~ and before mounting the second drive. Do you consider this an issue?\nThe ecryptfs PAM documentation might contain some relevant pointers.\n", "Q: LTSP client synchronize blackberry address book & calendar with evolution I'm trying to setup blackberry sync'ing with Evolution on a LTSP client. \nIt works on the server.\nI'm using Ubuntu 10.04 64bit on the server and here are the instructions \nI've followed to get the server working:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install required syncing packages\n\n\n\n    $ sudo apt-get install libopensync0 multisync-tools libbarry0 opensync-plugin-evolution opensync-plugin-barry\n    $ msynctool --addgroup BB\n    $ msynctool --addmember BB barry-sync\n    $ msynctool --addmember BB evo2-sync\n    $ msynctool --showgroup BB\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Find PIN number on phone and entered it in to the config\n\n\n\n   $ msynctool --configure BB 1\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Syncing\n\n\n\n   $ msynctool --sync BB\n\nThis all works but it's no good as the user logs into their thin client \nnot the server.\nRunning the same steps on the client I get the error:\n: Synchronizing group \"BBtofile\"\n: Unable to connect\n: Error while synchronizing: Unable to open fifo\nAt first I thought this would be a USB issue, as I was plugging the \ndevice into the client and using a server side program.

If it is possible, maybe you can dump the data on the client (if it is hdd-free, set up a ram-disk, or use one that LTSP client has created). And after that, import/export to evolution.\nThis might be hard, or easy, depending on what flags you can send to this sync software. You will however, need some scripting to make it easy for your users.\nFurther reading:\nhttp://linux.about.com/library/cmd/blcmdl4_fifo.htm\nhttps://beej.us/guide/bgipc/html/single/bgipc.html#fifos\n", "Q: Is there a configuration that let's me run the desktop from 9.10? Just installed Ubuntu 11.10 and it runs so slow, even with all effects and services turned off. I put in Ubuntu 9.10 on my computer the other day and it runs like a dream. I even find Ubuntu 9.10 more visually appealing than 10.04 onwards. I also like the extra effects that you can make in appearance, they just look better.\nMy question is:\n- Is there an existing distribution (or a way to create one) based on GNOME 2.x that has the latest security updates, a software for handling drivers like jockey-gtk, and the latest Ubuntu repositories?\nI have tried to use Debian Squeeze, which is close to what I want, but my main criticisms are that the repositories are out-of-date and there is no simple application for installing proprietary drivers like jockey-gtk in Ubuntu (which I've tried running on Debian with little success).\nI'd really appreciate anything you can tell me to help me achieve this, but please don't suggest GNOME fallback session. It still runs very slowly (and doesn't look the same). I'm not here to provoke anybody, it is just the environment I work best in.\nThanks in advance\n\nA: There are no official or unofficial Ubuntu based distributions based on such an old version of Ubuntu.\nWithout knowing more about your PC, my suggestion would be to use a more lighter version of Ubuntu that both combine the same traditional gnome-2 workflow that you are used to.\nLubuntu and Xubuntu are the main official distros I would warmly recommend.\nIf you are looking for \"visual effects\" - then Xubuntu together with its own compositor is your best bet.\nBoth distros uses the same version of Jockey as Unity based Ubuntu.\nIf you really want to use a Gnome2 based interface - stick to 10.04.  It is the LTS and as such will receive security updates upto April 2013.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 10.04,10.10,11.10 boot but don't load after fresh install, graphics to blame?

I don't even have Python 3 interpreter currently, and was surprised by this Wikipedia article: link while I searched for 12.04 release date.\nIt mentiones Python 3.2 as default Python interpreter in Ubuntu 12.04, while IMHO I wouldn't have expected Python 3 so soon.\nIs Wikipedia information correct?\nI found also this: link but it's not clear as which would be default\n\nA: 12.04 will probably have both 3.2 and 2.7 on the CD - the plan is to port Update Manager to Python 3. Typing python at a command prompt will still get you Python 2.7, though.\nI think the Wikipedia article is giving the most recent version which is installed by default, rather than the 'default Python interpreter'.\n\nA: To see what version of packages are in use in the different releases of Ubuntu, use http://packages.ubuntu.com. \nIt shows that Python 3 is not the default in Precise.

By default 2-finger tap was set to right click and 3-finger tap (3FT) to middle click (button 3). 2-finger tap works fine when I set tap-action to x x x x 1 3 2 or x x x x 1 2 3, meaning that, it's not the middle click event that is being grabbed but the 3FT, before it even gets translated to an event defined by tap-action. Proof that 3FT is in fact detected is that whenever I 3FT inside an unmaximized window I get this:\n.\nI followed instructions from the Ubuntu Forums but my system got really unstable for an unknown reason: from sporadic log-offs to frozen screens to tap-click not working at login. I reinstalled 11.10 because of it and now I'm posting this.\nAny one can see through this problem?\n\nA: I am not very sure if this will be helpful to you, but you can try to adapt the instructions of this question: Swapping the double and triple finger tap actions on trackpad.

There is ALSA, Open Sound, PulseAudio, OpenAL ...\nIs there one \"favoured\" or \"standard\" or \"recommended\" lib to use in sound-emitting software in Ubuntu? (I'm particularly interested in videogames)\n\nA: The fractured Linux audio landscape is basically a myth nowadays. All sound technologies on Ubuntu that have not been deprecated or dead for six years are complementary. To paraphrase Lennart Poettering with slight updates and an Ubuntu app-developer perspective:\n\nI want to write a media-player-like application!\n\nUse GStreamer!\n\nI want to add event sounds to my application!\n\nUse libcanberra, install your sound files according to the XDG Sound Theming/Naming Specifications!\n\nI want to add sound to my game!\n\nUse the audio API of SDL for full-screen games, libcanberra for simple games with standard UIs such as Gtk+.\n\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu or XUbuntu on old computer We've got an old computer at home which has really been left unused for a few years. It was the 'family computer' for a few years, and it is absolutely clogged down with programs, and runs so slowly it is almost useless - I'm sure you know the type. I think we got it new in 2004, and from memory, the specs are:\n512 mb RAM\n40 GB harddrive\n2.0 GHz processor\nI'll have to double check about the graphics card, but I'm pretty sure it's less than 128 MB\nAnyway, a friend recommended Ubuntu to give this old computer a new lease on life, but I just wanted to ask here if there's anything I ought to know before going ahead with this. In particular, should I use an older version of Ubuntu, or possibly XUbuntu (which I've seen people talk about here), as for me quick response is far more important than flashy icons that may lag when you click them.\nI'd rather not spend any more money on hardware. As I say, this computer is effectively unused today, and if we could just restore it for lag-less web browsing and word processing I think we'd call this a success.\nThanks for your help!\n\nA: Based upon your specifications, Xubuntu will be a better fit since the minimum requirement is 256Mb RAM.  \nRAM is the key - your processor is fine to run any version of Ubuntu.  \nIf you can invest in some more RAM then Unity 2D will work for you.  If you have a 3D Accelerated graphics card then you could also use Unity-3D or Gnome-Shell.\nXubuntu has a great compositor built-in - so you can get fairly good visual effects without the \"lag\".  Since this is a \"family\" computer - I presume you previously have had MS Windows installed.  You'll find the Xubuntu interface fairly similar - a panel based desktop with a \"start\" button and icons for open windows on the panel.\n\n\nA: I believe a perfect solution for your needs would be Lubuntu, which is a light version of Ubuntu. Im successfuly running this distro on a similiar configuration and never had any problems. Main difference between Ubuntu is that it contains LXDE, very fast and light window manager and its actually installed by default. Have a look there:\nlubuntu.net\nLubuntu is a part of Ubuntu family which means you still have access to apt and all the Ubuntu applications and all the updates. It was rebuilt/designed to allow you to install Ubuntu on low-end computers.\nYou may find some additional information here:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu\nIt says there that minimum system requirement is Pentium II or Celeron system with 128 MB of RAM, but with that amount of memory you may encounter some slowdowns. Since you declared much higher amount- this solution is all you need.\n\nA: From your specs I think Lubuntu, Xubuntu or maybe an older version of Ubuntu (like 9.10) would work well. \nBut if your serious about speed you might consider Puppy Linux which can load its self on to your RAM for really fast running on old computers. It also takes up only 256 MB of disk space with OpenOffice.\n", "Q: Xorg 11.10 kernel 3.0.0-16-generic running Extremely High CPU memory. Was a bug Introduced in recent update?

My office is going to buy a bulk number of desktop PCs (for developmental purposes).\nI encouraged them to buy PCs without a pre-installed OS and then install Linux.\nMy colleagues agree with me but they are not regular users of any Linux-based OS, so they want to choose a Linux OS which is best for our purposes and user-friendly and I suggested Ubuntu.\nNow I want some data to support my position, what's so good about Linux and specifically Ubuntu?\n\nA: 1. Linux is free.\nThis is a huge factor. Linux is free to install. When an update comes along, it's free too. The majority  of the software is free. Not having to pay for the OS and updates to the OS can be a huge long term cost savings for your buisness. When you buy a computer with Windows on it, you are paying the \"Windows tax.\" Part of the money you paid for that computer goes to Microsoft. If you decide you don't want Windows on it and you call up the manufactuer and you tell them that, in many cases they will refund you a portion of the cost of the computer. \n2. Linux is Reliable\nThere are computers and servers out there running Linux that have uptimes of years. Why? Linux takes the user into consideration and tries to make restarts few and far between.\n3. Linux is Secure\nEvery year, millions of dollars worth of important data is lost in virus and malware attacks. Don't let your buisness be a target. The number of viruses written for Linux operating systems is a fraction of that of Windows and Mac OSs. Why? Because Linux is a lot harder target then Windows and Mac. Linux patches security vulnerabilities as soon as they are discovered, with many people poring over the code, looking for code that might cause problems. All software in the Ubuntu Software Center is virus-scanned. In Linux, no user has too much power. In order to perform any administrative action, you need to re-enter your password. This stop many malware attacks in their tracks.\n4. Linux is user-friendly\nLinux has may features that set it aside from the other OSs that make the everyday user experience enjoyable. Things like the Software Center. Having all sodtware in a central repository in which other people can review and provide feedback on the app helps the users decide whether or not they want to download the app and the developers to fix any problems that users might be having.\n5. Linux is Customizable\nYour Linux is your Linux. Feel free to change things you don't like and add things you do, and share those changes with the community. Easy to use graphical tools let you tweak your Linux experience to just the way you like it.\nWhy Ubuntu?\nAfter all of this, you are probably thinking to yourself \"Man, this Linux thing sounds cool, but what makes Ubuntu so special?\" It's simple. Ubuntu was designed from the ground up with the user in mind. Super user friendly and with a community of users willing to help just a few mouse clicks away, Ubuntu is Linux for Human Beings.\nConclusion\nThat's why you should use Ubuntu. Don't believe me? Ask anyone on this site, they'll be glad to tell you thier experiences. Still wondering is a different Linux distro might be better? Go ahead, try it out, there's nothing stopping you. Linux is all about freedom.\nStill want more info? Check out http://whylinuxisbetter.net .

The device used for bridging must be set to manual in /etc/network/interfaces which excludes it from network manager. For setting up a bridge, follow the instructions of the Ubuntu community help. What works is to have eth0 bridget and e.g. wlan0 managed by network manager. So it is possible to connect to wifi networks conveniently. Unfortunately this does not work for OpenVPN connections. Hence one will have to start them manually with sudo openvpn /etc/openvpn/client.confm given that the client configuration file is created.

If source, in which format, whole app as zip, tar.gz...?\n\nA: I'll also point you to Uploading your app.\nIdeally, you should submit a Debian source package. A Debian source package consists of 3 files (with extensions .dsc, diff.gz, orig.tar.gz), which you should put in a compressed archive (a tarball, zip file, rar...) and upload into My Apps. This will allow reviewers to easily test and publish your app.\nHowever, there are some important caveats:\n\n\n*\n\n*If your app is commercial or proprietary software: we still recommend uploading a Debian source package, but if you are not experienced in packaging you can also upload either a binary Debian package (.deb), your source code in a compressed archive, your binary executables and all files needed to run your app in a compressed archive, and the commercial packagers will package and publish it for you.\n\n*If your app is Free Software and gratis: we recommend using a Personal Packaging Archive (PPA). You can specify the location of your PPA in the 'Any additional notes for the application reviewer' text box in the Overview tab of your app's entry in My Apps. You can also learn more about PPAs in the packaging section of the Ubuntu App Developer Site (*)\n(*) Sorry for the confusion here, we've recently switched to recommending PPAs for Free Software gratis apps, and the web UI might be a it confusing.\n\nA: See Uploading your app.\nIdeally you should submit a .deb package.

I think that they're for resizing, but all that happens is that the window moves with my cursor.\nHow am I triggering this? How can I stop triggering this? What are they supposed to be for?\n\n\nA: Those orange circles are the Unity Grab Handles, a Compiz plugin designed to make resizing and moving easier with touchscreens or touchpads. By default, it is triggered by a three-finger tap over the window.\nIn the accepted answer of this question:\nHow do I use Unity drag handles?\nthere is a very detailed guide to configure the handles.

I want to be able to access it (at least my OSX user's home folder) from Ubuntu without having to launch a media player (or anything else) as root. Also, because I occasionally want to fire up my machine in OSX, I don't want to change anything that I would need to change back frequently (I read a lot about changing UID--I don't exactly understand what this entails, but I wouldn't want to have to change my UID back and forth depending on which OS I'm using. Similarly, I don't want to change file system permissions back and forth).\nAlso, I saw something about a \"noowner\" option, but that doesn't seem to do what I want it to.\nSo I guess I'd like to be able to do something like this:\nsudo mount -t hfsplus -o noowner /dev/sda2/ /media/Mac\n\nAnd then be able to access all of my media (at least everything in my OSX user's Home folder) without dropping in as root. (for clarity: the above command line entry doesn't do what I want it to do, but I want to be able to do something similar).\nOr would it be better to change my UID? And if so, how?\n\nA: The documentation for the linux kernel implementation of the HFS+ filesystem lists a uid mount option that allows you to \"own\" all files (and maybe some other options that might be useful too).\n\nA: I know this is old, but there is another way around it that seems to work just fine for me. Since all of the files were owned by a \"root\" user, all I did was issue su root from the terminal and ls -lah /media/Macintosh HD from there. By using root, I was able to bypass the permission denied error. \n\nA: bindfs is the answer. It will take an already mounted file system and provide a view of it with whichever uid you'd like:\nsudo apt-get install bindfs\nmkdir ~/myUIDdiskFoo\nsudo bindfs -u $(id -u) -g $(id -g) /media/diskFoo ~/myUIDdiskFoo\n\n\nA: I wasn't able to figure out how to ignore the permissions, but I ended up changing the UID on my Ubuntu account to match my OSX account:\nsudo useradd -d /home/tempuser -m -s /bin/bash -G admin tempuser\nsudo passwd tempuser\n\nEnter new password. Log out, log in as \"other\" with username \"tempuser\" and the password you chose earlier. Open a terminal and type:\nsudo usermod --uid 501 yourusername\nsudo chown -R 501:yourusername /home/yourusername\n\n*change \"yourusername\" to your non-temporary user name and 501 to the UID of your Mac account (first Mac account starts at 501, but subsequent users will have different UIDs).\nLog out of tempuser and log back into your normal account (this is important; don't just switch users--bad things happen). Open a terminal window and type:\nsudo userdel -r tempuser\n\nFor more details, visit this page.\nCaveats\n\n\n*\n\n*Only one linux user can gain access. This setup will not allow multiple linux users to access multiple user directories on the HFS+ drive. This is because Apple locks down user directories (and media directories like Music) to 700 (rwx------).\n\n*Once you change your UID the login manager will stop listing that user. You have to change the UID_MIN option in /etc/login.def from 1000 to 500.\n\n*Finally because the user UID has changed, access to the drive becomes a permissions confusion. You will have to note the exact location of your user's home folder to view it. Tab completions and browsing through the file manager will become problematic to folders outside the original Apple user's home folder without sudo.\n\n\nA: This is general option I am using works perfectly\nmkdir /media/test\nmkdir /media/diskhfs\nmount /dev/sdb1 /media/test -o rw\nbindfs -o perms=775,mirror=userorid --map=99/userorid:@99/@uderorid /media/test /media/diskhfs\n\n\nA: I was able to get access to files from an old Macbook hard drive by running the file manager with elevated privileges.\ngksudo thunar\n\nThen copy files as needed.\n", "Q: MythTV + File Storage in one box I would like to build a headless Ubuntu server to work as (backup) file server + work as MythTV backend server recording and sharing TV in Home network.\nIt should have flexible hard drive handling to allow adding more disk (mostly old ones) to the pool and keep data safe if some disk will brake, like in UnRaid / FreeNas systems.\nIs there something ready to use on top of Ubuntu servers to create something like this?\nThanks -El Toro\n\nA: What you want to do should be possible.

Can anyone suggest how i can get around the sudo password or clean up space another way?\nThanks J\n\nA: Two solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Live cd: Boot a live cd, open a terminal, run sudo tune2fs -m 0.5 /dev/sda1 (If your first partition is low on space, and is on ext filesystem. You can check this with a df -T command.) This will regain the root reserved free space, and you can boot normally to clear some more. This will only work on ext[2,3,4]. On the live CD there is no password for sudo, just hit enter-.\n\n*Recovery mode: After POST, hold down right shift button until GRUB menu appears, select recovery mode. When you get to the menu, remount everything as rw (there is an option for that). And select root. If you haven't set any root password, it will drop you to the root shell immediately. Run apt-get clean and apt-get autoremove. Here you can also run the command written in the live cd solution.\nUpdate\nAs you can log in normally on tty1, run the sudo tune2fs -m 0.5 /dev/sda1 (please replace the partition with the one on which you are low on space)\nLet me know if you had any problems.\n", "Q: AMD Switchable Graphics (HP Probook 4530s-specific) - any way to enable?

To enable the proprietary driver from Nvidia, you have to open Additional drivers, as you already did. I think that this answer here should solve your problem, changing the graphics mode in your BIOS from Optimus to Discrete or Integrated. There are also other solutions involving bumblebee, which is a linux support driver for the Optimus technology and there is the official Ubuntu documentation here.\n\nA: For some reasons, selecting the \"Optimus\" option in the BIOS solved the problem. With this option enabled, my Nvidia card is now used. I wonder why selecting the \"Discrete Graphics\" option in the BIOS settings does not work properly. It seems that only the \"Integrated Graphics\" and \"Optimus\" options are fully supported by Ubuntu.\nBut I might be missing something...\n\nA: To use the nvidia optimus  (using 2 graphics cards) in ubuntu you need to install the bumblebee package. This will add the possibility to use the intel onboard graphics cards, but also use the nvidia when you start an app with the optirun prefix. (e.g. optirun firefox)\nProject page here: https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/Bumblebee/wiki/\n", "Q: How to add a launcher to a program/script inside my home dir?

Then I write ~/bin/foobar.sh as the command, but when I try to click on the launcher, it gives me the errors I mentioned above.\n\nA: The panel launchers don't do the same expansion of special characters as bash does, so ~ and $HOME don't do what you think...\nThe easiest solution is probably to use bash -c \"~/bin/foobar.sh\" as the command.\n", "Q: Switch back to pseudo-transparency? First off, I realize that what I'm hoping to get is not the expected behavior.\nOn my older desktop, I have the following set up:  Ubuntu 10.04.  Xfce running (installed after the fact).  I use the Xfce4-terminal, with transparency turned on.  In this set up, as expected when a terminal window is over the desktop, it shows the desktop background image.  However, if I drag the terminal window on top of a window, it continues to show the background as if the window wasn't there.  \nIt's kind of weird that way, but I've gotten used to it.  \nNow, as I've set up my new desktop (11.10 w/ Xfce installed) transparency works the 'normal/correct' way, but I'd rather have it go back to leaving out windows.  \nSo is it possible to get my new setup to do the old way?\n\nA: (In response to David's comment I offer this answer as a possible solution, as it worked for David and me with recent versions of Xfce.)\nIn Xfce, you can go to settings > settings manager > window manager tweaks and switch off the compositor, which manages transparency and the overlaying of X windows. You can do it via the command-line with xfconf-query:\nxfconf-query -c xfwm4 -p /general/use_compositing -s false\n\nThat should give you back pseudo-transparency, as long as you are not running any other compositors and only the standard Xfce window manager. With compositing on I had full 'real' transparency with guake and with it off I had the old style 'pseudo' transparency. \nYou will also have to restart guake to see any difference. This is about the only way to do it I think, as there won't be any settings in guake itself as it is highly dependent on your own customised setup and whether you have compositing enabled in xfwm4 or in whichever window manager you are using on your setup.\n\n", "Q: Can't install libmodman from source I have this file libmodman-2.0.1.tar.gz, and want to install it, so I extracted it, navigated to the directory, then ./ configure and I get this :\n\n~/Downloads/libmodman-2.0.1$ ./configure\n  bash: ./configure: No such file or directory\n\nThis is the content of the libmodman-2.0.1 directory: \n/cmake/\n/libmodman/\nAUTHORS\nCMakeLists.txt\nCOPYING\nINSTALL\nNEWS\n\nIn the file install is this:\ncmake ./\nmake\nmake test\nsudo make install\n\nI tried cmake ./ in the terminal but i get this :\n\nbash: ./cmake: Is a directory\n\nHow can I install this file?\n\nA: You should be trying to run cmake in ~/Downloads/libmodman-2.0.1/\nThen once you have done that as the INSTALL file says, run make, make test and then sudo make install.\nSo that is:\ncd ~/Downloads/libmodman-2.0.1/\ncmake ./\nmake\nmake test\nsudo make install\n\n", "Q: My df totals don't come close to adding up... why? \nPossible Duplicate:\next4 partition size / free space discrepancies \n\nThe results from a df on my main drive on my server don't add up.

I have both Windows 7 and Ubuntu installed on a shared machine. Because a lot of the non-developers use Windows, I'd like to change the boot order to make it easier for them.\nCurrently the boot order looks like the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 11.10 kernelgeneric *86\n\n*Ubuntu 11.10 kernelgeneric *86 (safe boot) \n\n*Memory test\n\n*Memory test\n\n*Windows 7 on /dev/sda6\nHow do I change the default order so that Windows 7 is at the top of the list?\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows 7 on /dev/sda6\n\n*Ubuntu 11.10 kernelgeneric *86\n\n*Ubuntu 11.10 kernelgeneric *86 (safe boot) \n\n*Memory test\n\n*Memory test\n\n\nA: I know this is a very old question and I don't have enough reputation to comment this, so for anyone still looking to do it without Grub-Customizer because of it's infamy:\nThis method assumes you have a dual-boot with one Linux and a Windows installation. Since the order in /etc/grub.d specifies the order in which they are called, you could simply call os-prober first and then add the remaining entries.\ncd /etc/grub.d\nmv 30_os-prober 05_os-prober\nsudo update-grub\n\nThis works great and puts Windows on top of the list.\nI can't find the source, but will provide it if I come across it again.\n\nA: From the tombuntu site (article by Tom): \n\nGRUB can be configured using the /etc/default/grub file. Before you\n  make any changes to it, it may be a good idea to back it up by\n  creating a copy:\nsudo cp /etc/default/grub /etc/default/grub.bak\n\nYou can restore the copying the backup over the original:\nsudo cp /etc/default/grub.bak /etc/default/grub\n\nOpen the file using the text editor with root privileges:\ngksu gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nThe line GRUB_DEFAULT=0 means that GRUB will select the first menu\n  item to boot. Change this to GRUB_DEFAULT=saved. This change will\n  make it easier to change the default item later.\nSave and close the file. Run this command to apply your changes to\n  GRUB’s configuration:\nsudo update-grub\n\nThe configuration change we made allows the grub-set-default and\n  grub-reboot commands to be used at any time. These allow you to change\n  the default boot item permanently or only for the next boot,\n  respectively.\nRun grub-set-default or grub-reboot (with sudo) with the number\n  of the menu item to boot (the first item is 0). This command will\n  change the default to the second item:\nsudo grub-set-default 1\n\n\n\nA: You can use an easy-to-use the GUI application called Grub Customizer to make your life a little bit easier. As the name suggests, you can do much more than just reordering GRUB menu entries with it. You can install it from a PPA in 18.04 and older releases, and from the official repositories in 20.04 and newer.\nIn 18.04 and older releases, add this PPA (you can skip this command on 20.04 and newer):\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\n\nAnd then run:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\n(See also this Ask Ubuntu question: https://askubuntu.com/questions/35629.)\nThere is an How-To Geek article about it, How to Configure the Linux GRUB 2 Boot Menu the Easy Way. Take a look at it if you're interested. Also, there is a solved thread on the Ubuntu Forums, Change boot order in GRUB 2 that mentions this tool.\nHere are some screenshots:\n\n\n\n\nSome troubleshooting:\nThe Grub Customizer settings may work only from within the latest Linux/Ubuntu installation, the one that installed the Grub.\nFor example, if somebody has two OS-es installed (Windows and Ubuntu), and then installs a third OS (Manjaro, etc) and then tries to follow the above answer, Grub Customizer changes will not work when made from the second OS (Ubuntu, in the example). The program has to be installed in the third OS, as it seems that Grub Customizer can only edit the Grub files created by the installation of the system on which itself is installed.\nThe files that determine the Grub boot menu come in most cases with the latest system installed on a machine, so Grub Customizer has to be installed and used from that Linux system.\n\nA: You can also change the grub default boot entry from the command line without having to install any additional tool.  This won't change the order in the list but it will allow a different OS to boot by default, which sounds like what you may want anyway.\nFirst, make a backup copy of /etc/default/grub. In case something goes wrong, you can easily revert to the known-good copy:\nsudo cp /etc/default/grub /etc/default/grub.bak\n\nThen edit the file using vim or the text editor of your choice:\nsudo vim /etc/default/grub\n\nFind the line that contains\nGRUB_DEFAULT=0\n\nand set it to\nGRUB_DEFAULT=x\n\nwhere x is the index of grub menu item to which you would like to boot to by default. Note that the menu items are zero-indexed. That means that the first item in the list is 0 and that the sixth item is actually 5.  So to boot to the sixth item in the list, the line would read:\nGRUB_DEFAULT=5\n\nIf you forgot the order of the items, take a look at /boot/grub/grub.cfg. Each menu entry is specified by a line of type:\nmenuentry 'Ubuntu' [options] {\n\nYou can also chose the default by the name instead of index, e.g.:\nGRUB_DEFAULT='Ubuntu'\n\nif there was a menuentry 'Ubuntu' line on /boot/grub/grub.cfg. This may be a better method, as it does not depend on the order of the entries, which could change.\nTo use a kernel in the \"Previous Linux Versions\" sub-menu use:\nGRUB_DEFAULT=\"Advanced options for Ubuntu>x\"\n\n(make sure to include the quotations), where x is the index of the old kernel on the sub-menu, or the name of the kernel as it appears in /boot/grub/grub.cfg. For example,\nGRUB_DEFAULT=\"Advanced options for Ubuntu>Ubuntu, with Linux 5.4.0-45-generic\"\n\nThen build the updated grub menu:\nsudo update-grub\n\n\nA: BEFORE STARTING\nPlease note that this will make a large mess of all of your GRUB files. Please be aware of that annoying issue!\nThat is all you need to know prior to starting.\nOn startup, enter Ubuntu. When Ubuntu starts up, enter either the terminal. Enter the following commands:\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nWhen that command opens, chnage GRUB_DEFAULT=0 to GRUB_DEFAULT=saved and then enter. Update GRUB with the command\nsudo update-grub\n\nFinally, set default OS with sudo grub-set-default NUMBER. NUMBER is the number of the OS that you want to set to default.\n\nOR\nInstall GRUB-customizer with the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\nCited from: https://tipsonubuntu.com/2016/07/20/grub2-boot-order-ubuntu-16-04/\nThis may provide more detailed information on what you are looking for. I hope this helps.\n\nA: first\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\n\nsecond\nsudo apt-get update\n\nthird\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\nOpen Grub Customizer\nAnd you can edit your grub\nYou can even change your grub wallpaper\nit's a great tool\nRisk Involved whether you use the tool or edit the grub.cfg file\n\nA: Open up a terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T), or press Alt+F2.\nType gksu nautilus and press Enter.\nThat will open up the file browser Nautilus with permission to change files owned by root.\nNavigate to the file /boot/grub/grub.cfg and double-click to open the file in a text editor.\nCut, move and paste the sections in that file that belongs to different operating systems. You must be very careful when doing this, as if you do it wrong then you won't be able to boot anymore. Windows boot can always be repaired with the tools from a windows installation disc (FIXMBR), that overwrites GRUB-MBR with a typical Windows-MBR.\nI have tested it from Ubuntu 9.04 to 12.04 and it has worked fine every time.\nBut I have only tried to move the Windows boot section to the top of the list to make it become the default.\nIf my memory is correct, each boot menu section in the file starts with a begin ... and ends with an ...end. And spans multiple text rows.\nThe text in that file has become a bit more complicated and it doesn't look the same in the last Ubuntu version as in previous versions. So use your brain to save you from doing a mistake.\n\nA: I tried the following and got good results.\nOpen up a terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T),\nType sudo gksu nautilus and press Enter.\nType in your user password.\nNavigate to the file /boot/grub/grub.cfg.  Copy and Paste the file into same directory, should create copy of the grub.cfg file for backup purposes.  Then double-click grub.cfg to open the file in a text editor.  \nIn the file you will find the line (set default=\"0\").  Edit the 0 to the line number in Grub that you want to load.  Mine was the sixth line, so I used 5, as the first line is considered 0.  Save the file.  Reboot the pc and if you chose the correct line it will be the highlighted one when Grub loads.\nGood luck\n", "Q: How can I install a newer kernel? I'm running the current stable Ubuntu version (Oneiric) but have issues with the shipped kernel. Newer kernel versions seem to have fixed it, but the kernel-ppa/ppa does not contain the most recent kernel which is why I want to install the kernel from the next stable version (Precise). Since I want to be able to unload out of tree kernel modules, the mainline kernel from http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline cannot be used.\nI also have have Virtual Box installed which also need to work in the new kernel so the \"kernel headers\" have to be upgraded as well.\nHow am I supposed to install the kernel packages from the next stable version (Precise) without upgrading all other packages?\n\nA: You can install the mainline kernel from the ppa\nhttp://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/\nOr you can compile it yourself\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile\nThe problem you are going to have with those options is twofold\n\n\n*\n\n*Neither the mainline kernel or compiling a newer kernel are going to have the standard set of patches Ubuntu applies, most notable is Apparmor.\n\n*Any packages that depend on the kernel, Virtualbox, nvidia, wireless, etc, might not work.\nYou would need to debug those things yourself or wait for the Kernel team to release an updated kernel. Support for the mainline kernel or custom kernel is limited, more so for third party packages such as virtualbox , nvidia drivers, etc.\nI am not trying to either encourage or discourage you, just pointing you in the right direction. I have been using a custom kernel on gentoo for almost 2 years now, but doing so requires a moderate amount of effort on my part.\nFrom the kernel team FAQ\n\nThe mainline kernels builds are produced for debugging purposes and therefore come with no support. Use them at your own risk. \n\nYour other option is to build a custom kernel. This is also poorly supported and requires some advanced knowledge \nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile\n\nBuilding and using a custom kernel will make it very difficult to get support for your system.\n  While it is a learning experience to compile your own kernel, you will not be allowed to file bugs on the custom-built kernel (if you do, they will be Rejected without further explanation).\n\nYour best option may be to install 12.04.

In order to submit patches and items to certain projects as well as qualify to run as a moderator of Ask Ubuntu, I need to sign the Code of Conduct.\nHow do I do this?\n\nA: It is made very easy to sign the Ubuntu Code of Conduct\nLaunchpad offers a step by step guide to do so:\nhttps://launchpad.net/codeofconduct *\n *Note that you will only see links to the codes there if you have already signed it\nThis will open the following page:\n\nAll you have to do is following the steps outlined.\n\n*\n\n*The first step is not necessarily related to signing the conduct but of course you need a launchpad account first, and you also need to create and upload a PGP key to later sign your agreement.\n\n*Download the Code of Conduct.\n\n*Sign it!\n\nYou will be guided through all steps you may need to succeed. There are even popups for additional help in case you get stuck.\nOnce you have done all (should not take you more than 5 minutes) you will hopefully never have to do this again.\nOf course you will also be able to withdraw your signature any time.\n\nA: First, make a PGP key as outlined here.\nThen, download a copy of the code of conduct from here.\nThen, Read the code of conduct. You aren't signing a document with legal standing, but you are signing something that will affect the opinion of your fellow community members, and if you don't agree with it, then don't sign it.\nThen, open a terminal and run the following:\ngpg --clearsign UbuntuCodeofConduct-1.1.txt\n\nThat will create a file along the lines of UbuntuCodeofConduct-1.1.txt.asc.\nOpen that file in a text editor and copy it.\nOn the Ubuntu Code of Conduct page, click \"Sign it!\" then paste into the textbox. Click \"Continue\". Congratulations, you've signed the Ubuntu Code of Conduct!\n\nA: Although the answers given already are great in detail, I'd like to add one of my own. There is a tool that automates the process (including generating a PGP Key): The Code of Conduct Signing Assistant. There's a PPA available and also a separate .deb file.\nIt guides you through the whole process, so you just have to follow the steps and in the end you'll have signed the Ubuntu Code of Conduct.\nDisclaimer: I'm the author of this tool.\n\n\nA: As you say, in order to have use launchpad to its fullest and have the ability to submit patches, help in certain projects that you find interesting and overall be involved in the launchpad community and other related communities in launchpad there is a \"Code of Conduct\" that you must first agree upon which basically says that you will behave accordantly and not go Rambo III on everyone.\nTo do this you must first (Assuming you already have your fingerprint. If not look below):\nGo to http://launchpad.net and Register an account. After registering you should see something like this:\n\nClick on your user account and on the bottom you should see an option that says \"Signed Ubuntu Code of Conduct\":\n\nIn my image it says YES but if you have not already done it, it should give you a link to the Code of Conduct page. If you click on the link it will send you to the CoC page where you can read the whole CoC and Accept and Activate it at the bottom of that page. Before accepting you need to enter your Fingerprint in the CoC page:\n\nNow this is only in the launchpad website.\nFor this to work you also need your PGP Key since this is the way to \"Accept\" the CoC.\nTo do this you first:\n\n*\n\n*Open the Dash and type password then look for the Password & Keys app:\n\n\n\n*Go to the Menu and Select NEW. It should open a window where you will select PGP Key:\n\n\n\n*Follow each step of the PGP Key until you have your PGP Key. This is the key you will first use in the Passwords & Keys to publish in the Ubuntu keyserver.\n\n\n*In the Password & Keys, select the My Personal Keys tab, and then your key. Open the Remote menu and click Sync and Publish Keys... Press the Sync button to start the sync. You might need to select the Ubuntu keyserver using the 'Key Servers' button first.\n\n\n*Again in Passwords & Keys, click My Personal Keys then your key and either double click it or press spacebar. Select the Details tab. Copy the code from the \"Fingerprint\" section.\n\n\n*After you have copied your fingerprint go to the CoC page I mentioned before in the beginning in launchpad and you should see an option that says Fingerprint. Just paste the fingerprint you just copied there and accept.\n\n\n*Done you have officially accepted the Code of Conduct in Launchpad.\nThere are a couple of links that are good to know why you need to sign:\nWhy Sign CoC: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SigningCodeofConduct\nSteps to do this (Including terminal commands): http://www.wikihow.com/Sign-the-Ubuntu-Code-of-Conduct\nAnother nice question link here: How do I make a PGP key?\n", "Q: How do I install and mount an exFAT partition? I have searched around here and with Google, and none of the instructions I have found work with Oneric.\nHow do install exFAT and mount an exFAT partition in the latest release of Kubuntu?\n\nA: You will need the packages exfat-fuse and exfat-utils to allow you to read and write on exFAT drives:\nFor 14.04 and higher:\nsudo apt-get install exfat-fuse exfat-utils\n\nAfterwards you just need to plug in the HDD and you're good to go.\n\nA: 13.10 and later\nYou will need the exfat-fuse and exfat-utils packages.  Install them with:  \nsudo apt-get install exfat-fuse exfat-utils  \n\nYour exFAT formatted drives should now (auto) mount fine.\n", "Q: How do I sign the Leadership Code of Conduct?

In your terminal, you can ask GPG for your key's fingerprint by typing:\ngpg --fingerprint\n\nGPG will display a message similar to:\n  Key fingerprint = `0464 39CD 2486 190A 2C5A  0739 0E68 04DC 16E7 CB72`\n\ncopy only the numeric fingerprint: 0464 39CD 2486 190A 2C5A 0739 0E68 04DC 16E7 CB72.\nStep 2: Visit your OpenPGP \nStep 3: Paste the fingerprint that you copied in step 1 into the Fingerprint text-box, then click the Import Key button. Launchpad will use the fingerprint to check the Ubuntu key server for your key and, if successful, send you an encrypted email asking you to confirm the key import. \nNote : this is a brief ... from launchpad process..... both process take a while so just take your time...\n\nA: On some systems such as lubuntu where the password and keys (seahorse) app is not available, a good and simple way to make PGP key is using gpa (GNU privacy assistant). It is a graphical frontend for gpg. This method also apply to others ubuntu derivatives.\n\n\n*\n\n*install gpa \n\n\n\nsudo apt install gpg gpa\n\n2.launch gpa from your applications menu\n\n3.Hit the Keys menu then select New Key . you are presented with a new window\n\n4.Type in your full Name, click forward, then type in your geniune email address.press forward. Now select the option to do a backup later.\n\n\n*enter a passphrase (could be a word or phrase) to protect your PGP key\n\n*Now you have successfully created a pgp key. It is actually a pair, consisting of both your private key and public key\n\n*To use PGP in ur correspondence, for example for exchanging email securely you need to give the other party your public key. So lets first export your public key then you can send it to them. To export, open gpa and select your key. Now hit Keys menu followed by export keys. Give your public key a name and save it\ntip: to ensure you exported the public key, open it with a text editor and check if there is a starting line\n`-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----`\n\n", "Q: How to use open/openvt with command line arguments?

I played some .rmvb (RealMedia) movie yesterday, and it was damn slow.\nI use ATI/AMD proprietary FGLRX graphic driver and default VLC setup.\n\nIs there anything I can do to speed it up?\n\nA: Have you tried changing the video renderer in VLC? Also, i think there is a enable hardware decoding checkbox. Also, (at least when using mesa drivers from the optimized ppa) there might be a package that will allow nVidia VDPAU to work with ati cards. One more thing, if your really desperate, buy a Broadcom crystal hd.\n\nA: Also, have you compared the perfomance differences with using the free drivers and the ATI ones? When you use the free drivers, make sure you have \"libgl1-mesa-dri\", \"libosmesa6\", and \"libgl1-mesa-dri-experimental\" packages installed. For better results, add the ppa \"ppa:oibaf/graphics-drivers\", \"ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\", and install the \"libg3dvl-mesa\" package. Your card seems similar to mine at least in terms of age. I have a ATI Radeon Xpress 1150 (RS480M), and these free drivers work for me.\n\nA: VLC is quite problematic on some formats. What gives me very good results playing .avi files is Smplayer. You can install it from the Ubuntu Software Center or from Synaptic (it depends on your preferences).\n", "Q: Hard disk setup for Ubuntu installation I have the following hard disk setup:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*C:\\ Win 7 OS disk NTFS\n  \n*D:\\ Recovery Disk NTFS\n  \n*F:\\ General NTFS\n  \n*G:\\ General NTFS\n  \n*SYSTEM NTFS\n  \n*HP_TOOLS NTFS\n  \n\nThe HD is 500GB in size and is a dynamic disk with the partitions as mentioned above.\nThe C:\\ drive is the Windows 7 OS disk. It has a lot of space. Should I shrink it and create a new partition out of it and install ubuntu (dual boot) there or shrink a partition other than the OS partition. Note that the disk is a dynamic disk and has 6 partitions (thanks to HP). I imagine it is better to install a different OS( and bootloader) in the partitions at the 'edges' like C:\\ or G:\\ . Also, which file system is it better to install ubuntu in? ext4 or ntfs? If I uninstall ubuntu in the future, can I reclaim an ext4 partition using windows?\nEDIT:  Oh rats. The disk is a dynamic disk! I read that dual boot cannot be done on a dynamic disk - it only permits one OS to be installed. Any methods to convert dynamic disk to basic disk needs deleting the dynamic disk. However I saw some tools  which claimed they will magically convert dynamic to basic without data loss. \n\nA: For your configuration I think a Wubi install would be the best. \n\n\n*\n\n*Pros: you don't need any partition making, you don't need any resize, you can safely remove from windows\n\n*Cons: 2-3% slower than bare metal install (you would not notice)\n\n\nIf you are on windows, and insert a live cd/usb it will autorun, and give you the option to install ubuntu inside windows.\n", "Q: Is there a PPA for gdb 7.4?

This message appears before the splash-screen.

I posted to\n  grub-devel about this and the upstream maintainer pointed out that,\n  even aside from multi-device problems, writing to btrfs from GRUB is\n  fundamentally risky because:\nthe same block may be used by multiple snapshots every tree\n  which uses a given block will contain its checksum, and so on\n  recursively\nHowever, btrfs reserves space at the start for the boot loader. This\n  space is more than GRUB needs to embed itself, and so we could use 1KB\n  of it for an environment block.\nIn any case, this is not a new problem that arose from using\n  subvolumes, nor does it prevent booting (you get a spurious \"Press any\n  key to continue\" prompt, but if you just ignore it it'll boot anyway).\n  Downgrading to wishlist.\n\nHope this helps\n\nA: I'm running al development branch of Raring Ringtail.\nI experienced the same problem about a sparse file not allowed message. GRUB not showing at all and booting straight into Ubuntu.\nI was reading a Linux Magazine (LXF), which had a few articles about recovering and repairing partitions, files, bootloaders and other stuff.\nOne of the article writers mentioned a simple tool to be used...

I've set swappiness to 10 as recommended in a few guides but what other setting can be tweaked? Are there any tweaks for the CPU?\n\nA: Your question is broad and the answer could vary from a short set of tips to a dissertation on the Linux kernel =)\nGenerally speaking, the default configuration is going to do well. From there you sort of need to start to break it down a bit more and start to get specific, specific to your hardware and what you want to optimize.\nYou can make some adjustments using sysctl\nYou will find many blogs / posts on suggested settings, such as\nhttp://www.ubuntugeek.com/performance-tuning-with-system-control-sysctl-in-ubuntu.html\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Sysctl\nA google search will turn up additional tips, both for security and performance.\nBUT they are often somewhat short on details.

The Close/Minimize/Maximize buttons are very small.  They look good but are so small I can't always push them with my finger.  I don't want to use a stylus in this case.  How can I set them up to be larger without changing away from unity?\n\nA: The button images are stored in the themes /usr/share/themes. Open you theme's folder, for example Ambiance. In that folder you'll find folders for GTK 2 and 3 as well as folders for metacity-1 and unity. Those two folders contain the icons you're interested in. These icons are PNGs which means fixed size. I suggest you first backup the icons you wish to change and then replace the icons with those of a larger size. Note there are icon variations for each of the icon states to indicate things like pressed, focus and unfocused. You'll need a close, minimize, maximize and unmaximize version which will then get color varations for the various states. I've changed the orange close icons to blue on my system. I've not tried changing sizes but I'd think that at least a wider icon would work if not both wider and higher. Changed icons will need to be placed in both the metacity-1 and unity folders always keeping the same names as currently used.\n\nA: You could try another theme with bigger window control buttons (don't think they have anything to do with Unity). Search for \"Appearence\" in Dash to open the theme selection interface.\nAs far as I can remember there were very few pre-installed themes, so you may need to look for an alternative.\n", "Q: Why should I jump from Windows to Ubuntu I wonder if you guys can give me an impartial advise on whether if I should jump from Windows to Ubuntu. No bias to Ubuntu please.\nI work in a small company with 10 pcs. The Sales department use Sage Accounting package and therefore we must have Windows running on these pcs and the main server. Other departments are mostly for documentation, email and forecasting. The dispatch department use bespoke package and web based packages (depending which couriers they talk to).\nWe also have one dedicated email machine that handles all sales enquiries. Our head office also insists that we use a Mac to produce product catalogue.\nWe also have a MS ACCESS application that we link via the web to our head office in US.\nSo far we have a Win2008 server running MS SQL for SAGE, all pc's are Windows based.\nThe question is \"Should we jump to Ubuntu from Windows?\"\nBearing in mind that most of our staff are not very good with computers. I fear they will be even less so if we switch to Ubuntu. Apart from the cost, what are the strength and weakness of using Ubuntu in our office as compare to Window? Do we need to hire some specialist to do the support?\n\nA: Welcome to Ask Ubuntu! No, you have a team of specialists willing to help right here. If Sage is essential to your business, the parts of the company that require it should stick with Windows. The other parts of the company should do just fine with Ubuntu, Ubuntu has a reputation of being built from the ground up to be user-friendly. Apart from the obvious cost savings, for more reasons on why Ubuntu is better then Windows in many cases for basic everyday business tasks, see my post at Why should my business choose Ubuntu? . Hope that helps! Leave a comment if you have any more questions.\n\nA: These are really a set of questions, but as a general recommendation, I would say that you shouldn't jump onto anything. You should investigate the opportunities and test your assumptions. Trying Ubuntu is very easy to do without any consequences. You can just put it onto a memory stick, and then you can boot it. It all takes just a few minutes. Familiarize yourself with it first, and then test it on your users. \nIn my experience, the less experienced users will have the least difficulties switching operating systems. After all, most of the concepts are very similar. The more experienced you are, the more the differences counts. I wouldn't expect the user experiences of Windows and Ubuntu to be a large obstacle to your users. \nBut from your description, your company seems very locked down into environments that themselves cannot legally be used in other environments than Windows. I would begin with replacing applications one by one, making sure that the replacements are available on many platforms. For instance, if you use Outlook for email, then you might want to see if there's a chance you could switch to Thunderbird, since it is available for both Ubuntu, Windows and OS X. Once you know that all applications are available on different platforms, then you can switch the operating system itself, and the users won't notice much of a difference. \nOf course, your primary goal is to get your stuff done. It should also be a goal for you to increase your company's flexibility by reducing the platform dependency. Because there are lots of benefits of using free software. You might want to start using other types of devices, like tablets, and having a clear focus on platform independence will help in that regard as well. But don't rush into things. You should define your long-term goals and only replace things when you've tested to make sure that the replacements will get your stuff done. \nYou probably won't need to hire specialists. However, Canonical offers support services at reasonable rates, and they have a lot of experience with professional migrations. I would certainly recommend that you get in touch with them and see what they have to offer. It might make things very much easier for you. \nIn any case, I would wait until Ubuntu 12.04LTS is released. It'll be supported for five years and it's a significant upgrade from 10.04LTS. And you should stick to LTS releases, which are upgraded every two years. \n", "Q: Why is 'ppa-purge' not installed by default? A lot of websites encourage you (OMG Ubuntu...) to install ppa's but doesn't tell you how to uninstall it. On a default install it's possible to install a ppa by a one-liner but uninstalling isn't a one-liner...\nSecond:\nThe names of the apt cmd's are strange -> 'apt-add-repository' and 'ppa-purge'.\nWhy not 'apt-add-repository' and 'apt-purge-repository'??? (create an alias could help)\nIf I'm right, precise will have a 750 MB iso, so they should deffinitly add 'ppa-purge' to the default disc.\nIs there a dev that could explain me why 'ppa-purge' is not installed on default Ubuntu 12.04?\n\nA: Software that is included by default on the CD/ISO is generally expected to be useful to normal users doing normal use cases. \nGenerally PPA's are meant for development and testing, not regular end user consumption as there's never a guarantee that anything in a PPA is tested and working:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are PPA's safe to add to my system and what are some \"red flags\" to watch out for?\nIf a user is using a PPA then the extra step of adding ppa purge isn't really that much more effort as that person should already understand the risks of using PPAs; that and  it's easy to find in the archive already. Sort of like how we don't ship a compiler by default; the people who know they need it know how to install it already.\nadd-apt-repository can remove a repository with the -r switch, but all this does is remove the repository, it doesn't roll back the packages to the prior version like ppapurge does.\nThat being said, I've not seen anyone ask for ppa purge to be installed by default as it is.

If you do, then you'll have to install them, since they're not used by default. But what you should do, is to install OpenSSH Server. It will allow you to securely connect to your machine from other computers, get a secure shell or share files. SSH can also be used for a lot of other things. \n\nA: J-E Schinstad is dead-on. Unless you're using something like an old Palm smartphone where it's just too hard to find a SSH client, there is no benefit to using Telnet and FTP rather than SSH and SFTP. Using SSH rather than legacy protocols is not just more secure, but it gives you other handy options like flexible port redirection (good for bypassing overly conservative firewalls) and stream compression. On top of this, it's actually easier to configure because the default settings for the SSH server can be pretty open without causing a gaping security hole, wheras the default telnetd configurations that Ubuntu provides have to be locked down pretty tightly.\n\nA: There are two different things that can be the problem here:\n\n\n*\n\n*For any network service to run on a given port, there must be code ready to accept connections.  For telnet it is telnetd, and for ftp it is ftpd.  Both are usually started by inet.d or the equivalent daemon manager.\n\n*Even if such a service is running, there might be firewalls in between blocking access.  This can both be on a network device like a router, or on the machine itself.  These rarely refuse connections though, but rather just drop packets giving timeouts instead.\n\n\nYour system is most likely not configured for either telnet or ftp.  You will need to either ask the administrator, or - if you - consult the documentation to see how to enable it.\n", "Q: Manually copy software (.deb files) from apt-get archives from one machine to another causes fetch error I copied the apt source directory from /var/cache/apt/archives/ on my laptop (11.10) to my work PC (11.10).

If f use the Ubuntu update manager to install updates, it says: \"waiting for unattended-upgrade to exit\", but no update happens. Now it won't update anything.\n\nA: Go to /var/cache/apt and delete the lock file. Clear the \"updates\" folder.\nThats it.\n\nA: Are you referring to the '/etc/apt/' directory, with the 'sources.list' file in it? Or the '/var/cache/apt/archives/' directory, where package archives are stored?\nCan't really answer your question as to what's wrong without knowing which. If you want to update one machine from the files downloaded by apt-get off another, you're going to need to become familiar with how apt-get structures its package lists and archive files and set up a 'sources.list' file to suit, or use something like apt-mirror.\n", "Q: Can Thunderbird send an out-of-office autoreply? I couldn't find a way to configure out of office auto reply mechanism in Thunderbird like there is in Outlook. The only way i have found through searching online is to create a message filter but that needs the laptop and Thunderbird to be running all the time, which is stupid in my view. Please share if you know a way.\n\nA: Thunderbird and Outlook are local E-Mail-Clients so they must be running to answer your E-Mails. The difference is, that Outlook is often connected to an Exchange-Server which sends those Messages on your behalf (and runs all the time btw.). Thunderbird doesn't have such a Server equivalent and therefore doesn't provide the functionality you are asking for. You need to find out which Mailserver your company is running and configure your out-of-office note there (ask an Admin).\n\nA: Probably we can work with the add-on for Lightning being worked upon which definitely solves the extended out-of-office functionality but lacks in caching of events.\nHow you do it is..\n1.

This has been supported with amd64 CPU's for some time now, but only landed for Intel in the Precise version of kvm.\nOtherwise, you can avoid this and use qemu (which KVM is based on), and not have hardware acceleration (note, it is MUCH slower), but usable.\n", "Q: Something Different with ATI Driver? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I speed up Unity with an ATI card? \n\nI have ATI radeon HD 4850 and use ati 12.11 Driver on my ubuntu.

Some hardware causes issues when working under Linux (mostly because of drivers problems). If I may suggest something, please see Ubuntu certification website. There You can find descriptions of issues (if any) and given workarounds to them. Choose one that is described as least problematic for Ubuntu. That is how I would make a choice if PC is not bought already.\nThe second thing is, that a lot of hardware producers don't care about (quite large) Linux users community. So if You have chosen some equipment, see what it has inside, and check if producers offer drivers for linux on ther websites or on the CDs/DVDs that come with it. This way You will not only avoid problems with drivers, but also support Linux community by choosing Linux friendly producer.\nAnd personally I would suggest laptop with nVidia VGA card, but that is my personal suggestion.\nAs for second question: of course You can install Ubuntu\nYour processor is 64 bit so You should choose 64bit OS.\nRegards\n\nA: Probably not what you want to hear, but I would wait for 12.04 LTS to hit stable if you're new to ubuntu.  That way you don't either  \na)install an old LTS that's about to go end of support\nb)install a new intermediate only to reinstall 12.04 in a couple months\nc)install 11.10 only to reinstall 12.04 or go through an upgrade process  \nI can just see installing 11.10 and then wanting to keep all settings and not liking some weirdness that can happen during the dist-upgrade process.\n", "Q: 'adobe-flashplugin conflicts with flashplugin-downloader' error while trying to install adobe-flashplugin I'm having some hard time getting straight with my adobe flash plugin.\n$ sudo apt-get remove --purge adobe-flashplugin flashplugin* nspluginwrapper\nReading package lists...

When installing a new package via apt-get install, I usually just tick yes if it is a program I need/want, but, I read through it, and, I am a little curious as to what the sections actually mean.\n\n\n*\n\n*How does apt-get know what packages are \"suggested\"?\n\n*What is the difference between \"The following extra packages will be installed\" and \"The following NEW packages will be installed\"?\n\nA: When a package is created, its author gives it a list of suggested packages, these are things that you don't need, but might want to have.\nWhen you install a package, it will automatically download that package, plus any other packages that one says it depends on.  \"New\" packages is the combination of the packages you explicitly told it to install, and any dependent packages that it needs in order for them to work.  \"Extras\" are just those that it needs, but you didn't specify.\n\nA: There are three basic ways an Ubuntu package can depend or pull in other packages:\n\n\n*\n\n*Depends - this is a hard dependency, the program you are installing requires this other package to run. If you try to uninstall one of these packages, your program will be uninstalled with it.\n\n*Recommends - this is a package the is needed or recommended for normal use of the program you are installing, but the program will work without it. By default Ubuntu will install these (unless disabled with --no-install-recommends) but it won't complain if you remove them later on.\n\n*Suggests - this is a package that can enhance the program you are installing but is not considered a part of normal use. These packages are not installed by default (unless enabled with --install-suggests) and would be considered like a \"hey, you might find these interesting\" from the package developer.\n\n\nBy default, Ubuntu installs packages marked as depends and recommends, and all these will be listed as extra packages, unless you specified some of them explicitly on the command line.\nPackages marked as NEW are all the packages that are about to be installed, i.e. the packages specified on the command line and all extra packages.\n\nA: Basically your machine stores a database of all program files installed.\nWhen you ask for something to be installed, apt-get first checks the local list to see if it's already installed. If not then goes out to the web to bring down a up-to-date list of files available from the repositories.\nEach program has a list of what files it requires to work properly (called Prerequisites or Required) and what programs rely on it (called Dependences)\nApt-Get then checks through the local list to see if everything is there. If not it selects the prerequisites required and adds them to your install request.\nHelp Has Been Taken\n\nWhen you install a program, its dependencies must be installed at the same time. Usually, most of the required dependencies will already be installed, but a few extras may be needed, too. So, when you install a package, don't be surprised if several other packages are installed too - these are just dependencies which are needed for your chosen package to function properly.\nBy default, many useful programs are already installed when you put Ubuntu onto your computer. However, you may need a particular piece of software that serves a purpose not served by the default applications. You might just want to try an alternative program to one which is already installed. In other words, you need new software.\nPlease check the following articles: \n\n\n*\n\n*Installing Software \n\n*What are Repositories?\n", "Q: How to get the java compiler for ubuntu?

I'm very comfortable using the command line and I run Ubuntu Server on my own home server. Though I feel that Ubuntu Server really lacks the ease of use and friendliness that the Windows Server 2008 provide. Don't take me wrong, I do understand the reasons to why there is no default GUI for Ubuntu Server and I don't think it needs one either. But for users who simply want to put up a home server it might be helpful to manage it all from a simple interface. It's also much easier to get a complete overview from a graphical shell.\nWouldn't it be great for unexperienced users to just get a \"server manager\" (with no extra setup to get a web server and a web interface up and running) where he/she can install/remove, start/stop services by just enabling a switch? There is a lot of web interfaces available but no native interface. What is the reasoning behind that this has never been implemented? Has it been proposed before?\nI've just played around with the idea in my head for a while, how the GUI should look and if you could implement \"Charms\" to install services locally and stuff like that.\nPlease be kind and try to enlighten me and not just flame this idea :)\n\nA: In the Unix world if you want to do something, the fastest way is via command line. The programs and services are created for only one purpose, to do the job.\nThe servers are usually far away. If someone has a slow connection, the GUI might kill the whole connection, but using command line or web pages can overcome this problem.\nAlso if a GUI is developed, it can introduce more bugs, and the software gets immediately larger. Plus it has more dependencies (Qt, GTK, mono, vala, ...) and when these dependencies change, it might introduce even more problems.\nA Web based management is better, because the web page can be rendered in any web browser. The code is nearly twice as small as for a GUI. If you want to manage your local server, you just open a browser on the desktop and open localhost.\nIf you want to try a very good home/small buisness server manager, try ebox (zentyal). It is in the official ubuntu repository. It sets up everything, and it is very nice.\n\nA: I suggest to give \"Webmin\" a try. I already used it quite often, especially if non-experienced people need access to one of my servers. It comes with its own small webserver installing itself usually on port 10000. It is as far as I know not part of the official ubuntu ppas but you can download a deb-package. However, I experienced it works best when it is compiled from source.\nWebmin\n", "Q: How to optionally maximize so that the launcher won't get hidden? Firstly, I very much like it when the launcher autohides when I really need all the screen space. The problem is, there are a lot of workflows when I want a large app screen, but the launcher should remain visible. I have found I spend a lot of time maximizing terminals and browser windows by hand, by resizing them to take almost all of the screen. This is annoying.\nYou can toggle the behavior of the launcher from the settings, but what I really want is to have two possible maximize actions: Maximize up to the launcher, and maximize to fill the screen. Is there any way to be able to have both available at the same time?\n\nA: I hope you are not using a notebook, as some of this may not be efficient without the full keyboard and a mouse.\nThere is a Compiz plugin called \"grid\" in the \"Window Management\" section of CompizConfig Settings Manager (CCSM).  I believe it may be enabled by default, so you can try it to see if this helps.\nMy suggestion, using this plugin, is to press Alt-Ctrl-KP5 (that's the 5 on the numeric keypad).  This combination will, on the first press, make the window fill all available space, but without being maximized.  The advantage is that you can then resize from the left to quickly expose the launcher.  You can do this even quicker than grabbing the left edge by using yet another Compiz plugin that may be enabled by default: press and hold the alt key, then using the middle mouse button to click on the left side of the window and drag to the right.\n", "Q: Radeon 9200 and Unity problems after adding xorg-edgers PPA I though that doing:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nIt will fix my really SLOW interface using Unity in Oneiric...\nNow, where I found this \"solution\", says that if something goes wrong I would have to put:\nsudo ppa-purge xorg-edgers\nBut after that console says\nsudo: ppa-purge: command not found\nAnd if I have no solution for this, what would you recommend me to use for a faster interface?\n\nA: You will need to install ppa-purge if it hasn't already been installed:\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\n\nThe usual syntax to use this is \nsudo ppa-purge ppa:[foo]\n\nwhere [foo] is the PPA to remove.\nThus for the xorg-edgers PPA you should use\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa \n\nAs to your general graphical issues with edgers - you should read their front-page\nIt makes it clear that the PPA is highly unstable.\nSome people have found that installing the proprietary drivers resolves slow/laggy windows.

I have access to the web interface of the server and printing the test page works like a charm. \nI can also edit all the default printer options, viewing the queue and so on.\nThe only thing that I can't do is installing and find the printer from other clients on same the LAN. I tried it with Windows 7's default searching and nothing appears, I tried to install a new TCP/IP port with the server's IP address and add the printer's driver manually but didn't work either.\nWhat I have to do or check to get this to work? The only problem is that the printer isn't visible on the LAN but it's correctly installed on the Ubuntu server.\n\nA: Do you have a GUI desktop environment installed? You should be able to run /usr/share/system-config-printer/system-config-printer.py and enable sharing connected printers, then on other computers enable show shared printers.\n\nA: I will help but this is from the top of my head so you might need to change some stuff:\nFirst verify you have the printer connected and samba/cups installed. So if you do a apt-get /aptitude search you should have the packages cups and samba installed. Cups is to handle the printer. Samba is to handle the sharing in case a Windows system will connect to that shared printer (Your case). If you do not have them installed then:\nsudo apt-get install cups samba or using aptitude sudo aptitude install cups samba\nAfter that we start with the configuration of them. Since you are on the server version of Ubuntu you do not have any default way of using a GUI solution (I say default since some people install GUI packages) so the following is for pure server:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit your samba main configuration. The file is in /etc/samba/smb.conf. To edit the file simply type sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf If you are root you do not need the sudo part. \nWe want to change the following variables and remove the comment (# or ;) symbols in front of them if they have it. So for example:\nIf it looks like this # workgroup = WORKGROUP you would leave it like this\nworkgroup = WORKGROUP (Without the # symbol).\nIf it looks like this ; guest = yes you would leave it like this\nguest = yes (Without the ; symbol):\nworkgroup - Change it to the workgroup you are using on your network. If your network is \"xtreme\" like in my case it should say:\nworkgroup = xtreme (Remember to remove the comment if it has one)\nsecurity - Change it to share. It will save you several issues later on.\nsecurity = share\n\n*Edit your samba printer section. \nThe printer section would look something like this:\n [printers]\n    comment = All Printers\n    browseable = no\n    path = /var/spool/samba\n    printable = yes\n;   guest ok = no\n;   read only = yes\n    create mask = 0700\n\nwhat we want to do is change browseable to yes and guest ok to yes\nShould look like this after editing:\n [printers]\n    comment = All Printers\n    browseable = yes\n    path = /var/spool/samba\n    printable = yes\n    guest ok = yes\n;   read only = yes\n    create mask = 0700\n\nThis is all.

If I click on the desktop/background picture in Ubuntu 11.10 (Unity) and start typing text, a little text input box appears containing my written text. If hit return the box goes away along with the text. \nWhat is this for? I am just curious. Is this a lovely feature I am not enjoying the functionality of due to my ignorance?\n\nA: That is the GNOME3 desktop Nautilus search integration.\nYou can test that by giving the desktop focus and start typing something that exists in your Desktop, it will jump to that item.\n\n\nA: The textbox that appear on the lower-right corner of folder windows including the desktop itself (as well as in a variety of other applications) lets you type in text that is matched to the beginning of each item present.\nFor the desktop, files and folders are automatically selected if their names start with the characters you type into that text box. This feature allows you to select an item on the desktop, in another folder, and in many other applications (for example, some music players) by typing in the first few letters in its name.\nThis text box comes up when you start typing; if you want to dismiss it, press Escape (or click elsewhere, including the desktop itself).\n\n\nA: You can't write on to the desktop itself (not even in Windows). The window you see is a kind of filtering of files etc as said in those answers.\nUse widget named  sticky notes to easily write note on desktop.

However, rebooting my computer would kill wifi again. My workaround consisted in blacklisting a module called dell_laptop, which was problematic and was blocking my wifi.\nSo, please run this command and comment what is output, lsmod | grep sony.\nIf the module sony_laptop is loaded, you should proceed to blacklist it, and reboot your computer. \nTo blacklist a module, run the following command: \nsudo echo \"blacklist sony_laptop\" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nWhich is just a way of appending the echoed line to the file referenced. You might as well do it with your text editor of choice.\nIf you wonder where am I getting all this voodoo from, check this bug report at Gnome Bugzilla.\n\nA: I haven't used a Sony Vaio, but other laptops I've used have a function key to disable/enable wireless.  It's usually accessed with a \"Fn\" key in conjunction with some function that is the same color as the Fn key (often blue).\nAlso, the BIOS often has a setting you can change at boot time.  There could be one that makes it default to disabled until enabled.\n\nA: sudo echo \"blacklist sony_laptop\" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf \n\nseems to work for me. Also, the switch seemed to be tricky and the wi-fi would go out and the switch needs to be flipped occasionally. \n", "Q: Formatting of \"Release Notes\" window I was trying to upgrade from 11.04 to 11.10 following this guide.

Every tutorial I read says that you should not be installing rvm with sudo for a single user install.\nWhy can I seem to get it installed without running sudo?\n\nA: As I documented here in another question, this should install RVM on a per-user basis.\n\nA: tl;dr remove the /etc/rvmrc file and restart, then install again.\nYou must have installed the ruby-rvm package at some point which creates a /etc/rvmrc file which sets the rvm_path environment variable to /usr/share/ruby-rvm which requires root privileges. To remove the ruby-rvm package run sudo apt-get purge ruby-rvm this is required even if you already ran an apt-get uninstall (since /etc/rvmrc is considered a configuration file)\n", "Q: Need help installing 11.10 on an Asus eee 1015PX Background - I had 11.10 running on the netbook no issues for 2 months, then after update yesterday the entire OS was a mess and unusable, so I attempted a clean install. I made a boot USB of 11.10 as recommended since my original was destroyed, but whenever I try to install I get Errno 5. I've re-done my USB it 8 or 10 times now, ultimate boot said the hard drive is fine and I can run 11.10 perfectly from the USB itself. Then when I proceed to install when running I get Errno 5 again. The drive was reformatted last night as my dads last ditch attempt of recovering anything and I only have one USB stick, so running 11.10 on USB isn't really viable, and neither is running a netbook without the net.\nBoth are equally desirable outcomes to this \n\n\n*\n\n*11.10 working and stable\n\n*10.10 recognising I have a wireless card\n\n\nRemade usb, still not working.

I also have 2GB of ram in my notebook which was upgraded before my first install of 11.10.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: This was resolved by re-downloading the .iso so that the MD5SUM was correct and then reformatting my USB key and trying repeatedly to install. Looks like I have a faulty USB drive. Lesson learnt, don't install an OS with a faulty USB drive. I'll go buy a new one now I think. Thanks for all the help One Zero and C.S.Cameron, you guys are great.\n\nA: Confirm MD5SUM of downloaded iso is OK.\nI have seen problems installing from Live USB's made using UNetbootin and Universal, if you have been using either of these try Startup Disk Creator, (from the Live CD or USB).\nIf you made the Live USB using Startup Disk Creator, try UNetbootin instead.\nSometimes one works better than the other.\n", "Q: MIDI to VMPK to QSynth to Audio? I'm currently using Jack (qjackctl) + VMPK + qSynth to try to simply jam a little bit on my keyboard on my Linux machine. I can see all of the inputs and outputs, but I'm still not getting any sound. \nHere's my Jack connection map:\n\n\nHere's VMPK, showing that I'm able to play notes with my USB Midi device:\n\nFinally, here's qsynth:\n\nIf I wire my USB device directly to QSynth, I see activity in the bottom left, but if I wire it to VMPK then to QSynth, I don't see activity. In either case, I don't get sound.\nI don't know how I should have this thing wired. It seems like I should wire my Keystation USB device to VMPK, then wire VMPK output to the synth. However, I  don't hear any audio at all, and I've quite a few things.\nWhat am I doing wrong here?\n\nA: First of all, VMPK does not pass MIDI data through it. That means that if you use it to play notes it will output them, but if you'll provide it with MIDI input it will highlight the pressed notes, but will not output them. To enable passing MIDI to the output, go to menu Edit->Connections, select \"Enable MIDI Thru on MIDI output\", and confirm by pressing OK. This will get your MIDI connection to work as on the picture you provided, and QSynth will recieve the MIDI input from your external controller.\nI am not sure how did you set up QSynth, as it cannot be deducted from these screenshots you have provided (silly QSynth!). However, there are some things you should make sure to get it to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a soundfont, as QSynth will not make any sound without some. Click on the 'Setup' button, then in tab Soundfonts use the Open button to select a sf2 file (if you don't have one, install package fluid-soundfont-gm or fluid-soundfont-gs, or look for them on the web, as thousands of soundfonts are available for free). After that change QSynth will ask you to restart it's engine, allow him to, by answering 'Yes'.\n\n*Afterwards, make sure the ALSA connections are as they should be (QSynth will reset it's when restarting the engine). Also, remember to connect it's audio output to system output in JACK's audio connections window.\n\n\nI hope it will help you. Ask in case of any further problems :)\n\nA: Just to add my 5 cents..\nIf you want to save the QSynth output to a .wav file, click the + button near the QSynth1 to add a new driver, and select Audio Driver: file.\nAs long as the engine is restarted, it will save the output to /home/fluidsynth.wav\nSimply close the QSynth when you are done recording and would like to listen to your creation :)\n", "Q: How to run.vhd file ( virtual PC image ) in ubuntu 11.10 How to run a .vhd file (VirtualPC image) in Ubuntu 11.10 and which software can be used to run it?\n\nA: CONVERT .VHD (VIRTUALPC) FILE TO .VDI (VIRTUALBOX) FORMAT\nTo do this, I proceeded as follow:\n\ninstall qemu package (sudo apt-get install qemu) convert .vhd file:\nqemu-img convert -O raw myfile.vhd myfile.bin once the file has been\nconverted, we convert it to .vdi format using VBoxManage: VBoxManage\nconvertfromraw myfile.bin myfile.vdi –variant standard\nnote1: “variant” is specified to ensure we have an expandable vdi file (.bin\nfile is 17Gb, .vdi file will be only 1.5Gb)\nnote2: in previous version, “convertfromraw” command was called “convertdd”\nThat’s it.\n\nSimply load your vdi file within VirtualBox, do it for all three xp .vhd files and you can now use all these VM more easily.\nhttp://www.qc4blog.com/?p=84\nhttp://www.qc4blog.com/?p=721\n", "Q: How do I access a WUBI install after installing a third OS alongside Windows?

Wine browser seems to use Gecko, and IEs4Linux has been abandoned (and I'm not sure ActiveX even worked with that). Google Chrome only supports ActiveX in Chrome browser in South Korea in windows, because the major South Korean banks have been running their web apps with ActiveX for a long time. Apparently it's possible to run Chrome for windows in Wine, but even then if you get Google's patched Chrome for the South Korean market, I don't think it would be available in any language other than Korean. If your computer can handle it, I'd recommend running XP in VirtualBox, otherwise you may want to dual-boot and grab the photos from your cameras that way and store them on a shared partition. It might be less of a hassle to just use a memory card reader, I certainly hope you're not relying on this ActiveX feature for productivity.\n", "Q: Unity3D loads all the time instead of selected desktop session Every time I log out, and change session, select Unity2D and login Ubuntu is loaded, to what it seems to be in Unity3D.

In other words, what icon name do I have to put in dconf-editor/org/gnome/shell/extensions/icon-manager -> top-bar to get rid of the Removable Devices (and Ubuntu One) from sys tray?\n\nA: You can possibly try this GNOME extension:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/7/removable-drive-menu/\nThis extension adds a \"status menu for accessing and unmounting removable devices.\"\n\nThis extension does not remove the removable devices from the messaging tray. You might want to try and hide the messaging tray to partially achieve the result you are looking for.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to hide the Messaging Tray in GNOME Shell?\n\nA: This is a twofold answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*removing the icon in the tray;\n\n*adding the icon in the panel.\n\n\n\n1. Removing the icon in the tray\nThis seems to be a development issue regarding Gnome-Shell usage on Ubuntu. A similar case is the redundant keyboard-layout icon, which appears both in the tray and panel. I reported the bug to Gnome, who explained:\n\nUbuntu has patched gnome-settings-daemon to use libappindicator, which\n  falls back to legacy status icons if the required DBus daemon is not\n  running. This is the case when running GNOME Shell, which does not\n  support app indicators (the \"indicator\" in the top bar is build into\n  the shell), so the patched g-s-d falls back to a legacy icon which is\n  shown in the message tray\n\nSo regarding removal of the tray icon, I am not sure there is an easy answer (it might be a bug or development goal for Ubuntu instead), but someone may surely be able to provide a hack.\n2. Adding the icon in the panel\nTo add the removable device icon in the panel, you need the Removable Drive Menu extension.\n", "Q: Set desktop resolution for standard 11.10 VNC server Is it possible to specify a desktop resolution for the built-in ubuntu 11.10 vnc server?\nIt defaults to 640x480 when I have no monitor connected (headless), and I can't find a way to change it. Does it have any command line parameters?\nA similar issue has been posted:\nSet screen resolution when booting with no screen\nNote: The box is set to auto-login, so if I can change the auto-login resolution (with no monitor), that could possibly help.\n\nA: Figured it out myself, finally.\nApparently the problem was that since there is no monitor, no valid \"screens\" are started up when the box boots, and therefore no resolutions are available in the Unity settings dialog. \nHowever, when no screens are found, it seems the system defaults to a \"virtual desktop\", with a 640x480 resolution. The system does support virtual desktops that have different resolutions than the connected monitors (in this case none), so the trick was to change the default virtual desktop resolution. That can be done in the /etc/X11/xorg.conf.\nMy file currently looks like this.\nSection \"Device\"\n       Identifier      \"Default Device\"\n       Option  \"NoLogo\"        \"True\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n   Identifier    \"Configured Monitor\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n   Identifier    \"Default Screen\"\n   Monitor        \"Configured Monitor\"\n   Device        \"Default Device\"\n   SubSection \"Display\"\n       Depth    24\n       Virtual 1280 800\n   EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nThis seems to suffice, and you can change the \"Virtual 1280 800\" section to whatever you want. And the reboot the box. I am using the built-in vino VNC server.\n", "Q: Syncing my iPod Touch (And Others) libimobiledevice doesn't work for me. I've got Ubuntu 11.10 and I'm trying to put music on to my iPod Touch 4Gen running iOS 5.0.1. \nI have tried every program available in the Ubuntu software center for sycing iPods and I get basically the same response from each one: \"[cannot apply changes etc, ect, etc]\" I've tried rigorously with Banshee and Rythmbox with no success. \nI've even tried running iTunes on Windows XP in VirtualBox with no success. I've tried running iTunes through Wine and it results in an error message saying something along the lines of \"[Please install Apple Application Support and then reinstall iTunes]\". I am considering Jailbreaking my iPod but I cannot find Absinthe that works with my iPod and with Ubuntu. In addition I'm not sure how ** works with Ubuntu. I'm really in a pickle here. \nIt would be ever so helpful if I could indeed have some help with this issue.\n\nA: I have tested gtkipod with Ipod Touch 4 Gen but 8GB. I also tried Banshee and Rhythmbox, both failed. Even with the latest Shuffle or Nano.\nFirst install the gtkpod iPod Manager  in the Software Center.\n\nAs you can see when starting the program it has on its list the 4 Gen of Touch:\n\nAlso checked with latest Shuffle and works. The only one that works actually.\nIf a user uses Banshee or even Rhythmbox they will hear a woman in the Ipod saying that you need to sync it with itunes. The only one I have known that correctly syncs is gtkpod.\nUPDATE - Funny, today my Ubuntu got 2 updates in the Update manager about Iphones and Ipod.\n\nA: To elaborate on Mark's answer, apps like RhythmBox and Banshee and others rely on gtkpod to be able to sync properly - to update the database file on the ipod.  This works for older iOS versions earlier than 5, but with version 5 Apple changed the checksum algorithm used on the database file to lock out other applications and no one has yet (as of 6-Feb-2012 AFAIK) figured out the algorithm.\nReference from October.\nThere is already at least one bug in Launchpad about it: Bug # 601251 - Rhythmbox/gtkpod can't write to iPad music database.\nI have found several mentions of methods to get it to work, but they all require jailbreaking your iPod and manually reverting the internal database version marker from 5 to 4 (or earlier).  I've not be willing to do this yet, but here's one example (I have not tried this).\nGetting iPod syncing working with 4G touch - iOS5\nMore googling for 'ipod 4g sync ubuntu' will find more links to other descriptions of this technique.\nFor now, we can't sync unbroken iOS5 devices in Ubuntu.  I've built a Windows VM in virtualbox and put iTunes on it and have done syncing through that, though it's overkill (uses way more memory than I'd like so I don't do it often).\n\nA: The current version of gtkpod does not support the 4th gen iPod Touch see the SourceForge release notes here\n\nA: Your Windows on Virtualbox solution may be the only viable way, but you have to install guest additions to enable USB 2.0 controllers, and so make it able to your iPod to connect to the Windows inside Virtual Box. Good luck! ;)\n", "Q: Error Installing Git with Apt-Get When I attempt to install git on a server distribution of Ubuntu 11.04, I get an error.

I have done a fair chunk of work on Facere.py and made a couple dev docs in facere/, its now mid night so I got to bed.\nI get to class and open my netbook and i see facere.u1conflict/. wide eyed i look in it and see only facere.py (who has one line \"from TKinter import *\"). I proceed to check my phone, facere/ doesn't exist, i check my desktop, folder is gone there too, I check one.ubuntu.com as a last hope. nothing. \nThe work I did last night was mostly educational and I could probably recreate it better than it was in about half an hour. What I'm really concerned with is that this isn't the first time something like this has happened. what is happening that Ubuntu one is deleting my files every now and then? it is really disconcerting and kind of makes ubuntu one less enticing to people when I brag to windows users about how I never worry about loosing my data because it is in the cloud.\nAny insight?\n\nA: If you check your trash bin, it might still be there on whichever device you used to create the lost file. I normally delete my files permanently when I'm done, which made it obvious that Ubuntu One recently started sending out-of-date files to the trash instead of renaming them.\n\nA: Ubuntu One is not a proper tool to perform version control of source codes. The reason for that is that it knows nothing about the contents of the files and treat each file as an opaque binary blob - i.e. if both versions of a file were modified it has no way to merge them of to do anything meaningful apart from marking them as conflicted.\nFor any text-based file formats and especially for program sources I would strongly recommend to use a proper version control system - which, apart from ability to merge files, has tons of other features specifically designed for this kind of distributed work (for one thing, even if something went terribly wrong, you always can roll-back to a previous version of a file). \nGet yourself a free account at github and be happy :)\n", "Q: (1Gb RAM) very slow and freezes often on 11.10 my Netbook ist very slow with 11.10.

NOTE: If you have multiple NICs in the machine, make sure you are editing the settings for the correct adapter, the interface managing the host/DNS or this won't work!\nAdd your domain name to the host setting directly below the additional DNS.  This may be redundant, but this is how I set it.  For example, mydomain.something.local\n\n*Edit the /etc/hosts file and just add the IP address of the DNS server at the top of the file, or directly before the \"127.0.0.1 localhost\" line.\n192.168.1.231\n\n127.0.0.1 localhost\n\n\n*Edit the /etc/nsswitch file and make these two lines read as follows:\nhosts:          files dns\n\nnetworks:       files\n\nReboot the machine and try connecting again.

I have a monospaced font (PT Mono) that I prefer to use in programming IDE's. The font has only Regular, all other Bold and Italic are derived by slanting and \"boldification\" of the Regular. The problem is that the \"boldified\" characters are wider than regular ones, so the source code strings in the IDE window are now composed of non-monospaced characters.\nHow do I control the \"boldification\" of the font so it would not become wider than regular?\nThe problem is illustrated on the screenshot below (PT Mono, no dedicated bold). See how \"unsigned char\" and \"sizeof\" words are moving out from their proper positions.\n\nHere an another example, Droid Sans Mono (no dedicated bold).\n\nAnd here an example when the font has dedicated bold version (Liberation Mono). Bold and regular are aligned perfectly.\n\nSo, the issue is definitely in frivolous boldification rendering in situations where bold is not provided. The font engine is to blame.\nUPD: There is a file /etc/fonts/conf.avail/90-synthetic.conf which if being referenced from /etc/fonts/conf.d/ tunes the font engine to perform synthetic emboldening of the fonts that do not have the bold version. If the symbolic link to this file is removed from the /etc/fonts/conf.d/, the emboldening disappears. This is not what is exactly wanted, but at least this cures the case of monospace fonts being not monospace (see below, PT Mono). The fine tuning of the emboldening is still wanted (either by configuration file, or by freetype2 patch.\n\n\nA: mbaitoff, I'm posting this as addition to your update, not as an answer\nIf user creates file named ~/.fonts.conf:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM \"fonts.dtd\">\n<fontconfig>\n    <match target=\"font\">\n        <test name=\"spacing\" compare=\"eq\">\n            <const>mono</const>\n        </test>\n        <edit name=\"embolden\" mode=\"assign\">\n            <bool>false</bool>\n        </edit>\n    </match>\n</fontconfig>\n\nthen, applications can use bold monospaced font if available, and disable \"synthetic boldification\" if used font does not have bold typeface.\nIt is just alternative, and slightly different approach with different result\n", "Q: Attempting to install Postfix on an Amazon EC2 instance and getting 404 not found \nPossible Duplicate:\nInstalling packages to unsupported Ubuntu editions? \n\nBasically I am trying to install postfix and getting 404 errors.

Most critically, my system has apparently been overheating (under medium load) and summarily shutting down.  One factor which I have already discovered is that the back fan is not spinning.

The aliases setup this way will be lost upon a reboot and you will need to recreate those aliases;\n\n*if you need a more permanent solution, you can edit /etc/network/interfaces file and add alias' definitions there. \nFor more details on these two methods please visit Ubuntu Linux: Creating ethernet alias for eth0 network device. \nIf you only needed 2 instances of your program, I would recommende using a virtual machine, but for running five instances you will need 4 virtual machines which is not practical as it will almost halt your machine.\n\nA: In NetworkManager's applet you can choose Manual instead of DHCP.\nThen, you can add to the list more than one address.\n\nA: Actually this is not an answer to the question in the tilte, but to the question in the body!\nThe easiest way might be to just use different port numbers for your instances. Then all instances share the same ip address, you send the data to 127.0.0.1 via different ports.

I have my home directy encrypted with ecryptfs. Does ecryptfs lead to fragmentation?\nI have the feeling that reading files, displaying folders and login became continuously slower and slower (although it was not noticeably slow at the beginning). The hard disk makes a lot of seek noise even if I open only a text file. \nIn /home/.ecryptfs I see many big archives (that probably contain the encrypted files), so I'm wondering if Linux file system online defragmentation gains anything here.\nWhat options do I have to increase performance? Should I decide whether I maybe better do without encryption?\n\nA: I am programming with python in my home directory, and I have a Python virtual environment for project packages.\nFor my programs startup times are considerably slower on eCryptfs as Python issues many stat() system calls when locating module files; because many of these stat calls result in \"file not found\", and such results are not ever cached, but we still pay penalty for the ecryptfs, things are consistently sluggish.\nUpdate\nI ended up removing ecryptfs from my home dir by moving the ecryptfs mountpoint to ~/private, copying most files out of the ~/private to my uncrypted homefolder. Things are now fast again. Maybe the performance penalty would be less for some other CPU, I have an Asus 1215N with Atom.\n\nA: I haven't made any hard core measurements so take the following with a grain of salt but I have noticed extremely poor performance with ecryptfs in the following scenarios compared to a dm-crypt'd LV (mounted as /home/username):\n\n\n*\n\n*du on a folder with lots of files. It takes several minutes while only a few seconds using dm-crypt of the whole partition   - this is by far the worst case\n\n*opening a folder with lots of items in mutt takes several seconds (around 20 on a folder with 10000 items) while it is almost instantaneous with dm-crypt\n\n*git operations are slower (by some, not a lot) compared to dm-crypt\n\n*applications such as firefox take noticeably longer to start but we are still in the seconds range\nI just moved to dm-crypt (with pam_mount) and couldn't be happier!\n\nA: Phoronix has run a suite of tests and a couple of articles on eCryptfs performance when encrypting home directories:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=ubuntu_910_encryption&num=1\n\n*http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=ubuntu_jaunty_encrypt&num=1\nMy take away from those articles is that encryption (as expected) according to the benchmarks, does impact read and write performance to a degree.  On small CPUs (Atom processors), and on fast hard drives (SSDs), this is perhaps more noticeable.  That said, by using eCryptfs, you're only paying that performance penalty when reading/writing data to your home directory (and not the rest of the system, as you would with full-disk encryption).  Furthermore, with faster processors, the amount of time spent doing that encryption/decryption often fits within the IO wait accessing the data from disk, which is usually the bottleneck.\nAs to your particular issue, if you're hearing a lot of \"hard disk seek\" noise, it sounds to me that your system is swapping data from memory to disk, and back and forth.  If you've chosen to use eCryptfs, then Ubuntu will automatically encrypt your swap space (which is required to safeguard your encrypted data).  However, encrypted swap is very expensive, too.\nPersonally, I overload my systems with lots of RAM (8GB on most of my systems), and disable swap entirely.\n\nA: calls such as truncate() and ftruncate() that increase file size are slower on ecryptfs because it has to fill with encrypted zeros, unlike normal file systems that just create holes in the file. \n", "Q: Is my boot process normal?

While booting with Live USB, it hardly takes 25 seconds.\nThe boot process stops for about 20 seconds at \"resume libcrypt version\" line. And those fscks are performed at every boot. Are those fscks necessary?\nEDIT: Bootchart\n\n\nA: The normal booting time is 40s (including BIOS). You might have some \"not so good\" hardware which causes this problem. Also you must have kept many things on boot and installed many packages. But you need not worry.\n\nA: You might try starting Terminal and then entering the code below, modified for your circumstances/ needs.\nsudo tune2fs -c 50 /dev/hda1\n\nThe 50 should make the system execute fsck every 50 boots. 50~100 is deemed usual.\nThe hda1 might be hda1, hda2, hda3...   or sda1, sda2, sda3... depending on your setup.\nYou'd get more info by entering man tune2fs. The down arrow takes you down through the manpage.\n", "Q: How to increase clipboard size? If I try to copy-paste a large amount of text (from Firefox to LibreOffice), the amount of text thus copied is truncated.\nWhat setting / application imposes this limit (I assume it is the DE)? And is there anyway to increase the size of the clipboard?\n\nA: You can use GLIPPER which is Klipper's Gnome Cousin. Click here \nGlipper \nSome of the features are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Will not truncate your data. At least I tested by copying from my Blog a whole post that was 3387 words total.\n\n*You can have a maximum of 1024 entries (Klipper can have 4096). But I think that having 100 is enough.\n\n*Very easy to use, just highlight some text and done. You do not need to copy it. Just highlighted it.\n \nAfter installing it you need to logout/login to make it show on the panel.\n\nA: I've been using parcellite for a while and I'm quite happy with it.\nIn the preferences menu, behavior tab, the Max Data Size (MB) option seems to address your problem (according to the tooltip, 0 means no limit)\n\nA: You can try to install GPaste. It's a clipboard manager for gnome-shell that let you set some options.\nI can't check it easily (no Gnome-Shell installed), so feel free to downvote or notify me if it doesn't work.\n", "Q: Overriding DSDT did it work? I have compiled a kernel using a custom DSDT file. I just want to make sure the kernel is using it.

If you're confused by the \"this is unsafe, tainting kernel\" line, it means that you won't get support from the kernel developers should anything go wrong in your kernel.\nUsually, you do not have to override the DSDT as errors in it should be corrected by the kernel (or a BIOS update if it really is wrong).\n", "Q: How do I enable a touchpad? I installed Ubuntu 11.10 several months ago, but I haven't found a proper way to enable the touchpad.\nI once tried something I can't recall the name.\nDoes any one have any suggestions?\nUpdate:\nHere's what cat /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf shows:\n# Example xorg.conf.d snippet that assigns the touchpad driver\n# to all touchpads.

I use the grep command to search for a string in many files. Is there something similar to \"search and replace\"?\n\nA: You are looking for the sed command. For example, to replace the \"dog\" with \"cat\" in all text files in the current directory:\nsed -i 's/dog/cat/' *.txt\n\n\nA: sed comes to mind. Example:\nsed s/cat/dog/ <input >output\n\nThis searches for cat in a line and puts dog on it's place in the file input and writes to file output.\n\nA: sed is the right tool; but, as an alternative, you can even use ex commands in vim:\nvim -c 'args <files> | argdo %s/cat/dog/g | x'\n\nwhere <files> is the list of files or patterns in which you want to make the substitution.\n\nA: You can use Vim in Ex mode:\nfor b in *.txt\ndo\n  ex -sc '%s/OLD/NEW/g|x' \"$b\"\ndone\n\n\n\n*\n\n*% select all lines\n\n*s substitute\n\n*g replace all instances in each line\n\n*x save and close\n", "Q: Why does the unity top panel not show the Chrome icon? It does on gnome shell and cinnamon (linux mint).\nWhy not in unity?\n\nA: In Unity the \"top panel\" is a menu bar only, when an application is running in Unity you get an arrow on the left side of the icon (and an additional arrow on the right when the application is focused)\n\n\nA: To add to Jorge's answer, multiple instances of a program show up as multiple white dots to the left of the Launcher icon (up to three I believe).  Single white triangles on the left indicate active processes.\n \nClicking on the button on the unity bar displays all the windows or fades the desktop and brings up small versions of the windows that you can click on to select the one you want.\n\nIn Oneiric, the left side indicators (dots or triangles) turn blue when the application wants attention.  (In Natty, a blue triangle appeared in the upper left on the Ubuntu button, but that button is now on the top of the Launcher in 11.10.)\nAlso, depending on your Backlight settings for Unity, the application that wants attention gets backlit with edge illumination. Below, you should see the Synergy and GEdit icons are not backlit, while the Synaptic and the Gimp icons are.  The GIMP icon also has the subtle edge illumination effect. (And The Gimp has a bug where it always requests attention when starting up.)\n\nUse the Compiz Configuration Settings Manager to change the backlight mode.  Mine was defaulted to \"Backlight Always On\" - so all the icons were backlit (as in the earlier screenshots).  Changing it to \"Backlight and Edge Illumination Toggles\" now has the active windows backlit and the ones wanting attention edge-illuminated.\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I configure Unity?\n\nSee also this question on how to bring the demanding application to focus.\nand this one on auto-raising chat windows when demanding attention\nThe Launcher should provide as much functionality as seeing Chrome in the top panel.\nYou can also make extensive quicklists that show customizable menus when right-clicking on the Launcher icons.  \nSee this excellent question: What custom launchers and quicklists are available, and in your case in particular: Chrome quicklist\n", "Q: Why do Firefox, Preferred Applications and x-www-browser disagree on default browser? Firefox claims it's the default browser (Edit -> Preferences -> Advanced -> Check Now), Preferred Application also lists it as the default, but x-www-browser runs Chrome. Is there really more than one setting for the Ubuntu default browser?\n\nA: Honestly, I don't know where the Firefox / Preferred Application setting lives. However, x-www-browser is managed by the \"alternatives\" system in dpkg. You can interactively change it by typing this at a command prompt: \nsudo update-alternatives --config x-www-browser\nSo, not a complete answer but might let you straighten things out and move on :)\nUpdate\nThis page describes where Gnome keeps its preferred applications settings. The page refers to Linux Mint, but the same principles should apply: http://www.libre-software.net/change-the-default-application-linux-mint-ubuntu\nSo yes, they're different.\n", "Q: Is there an equivalent to Adobe Creative Suite? Adobe has the creative suite - are there any alternatives for Ubuntu?\n\nA: If the linux equivalents like gimp, inkscape and scribus fail to meet your needs, why not install the latest version of WINE and run Adobe's own suite on your linux/ubuntu setup, but be warned things may get buggy although I have been running Photoshop without any problems for a while... Go here:\nhttp://www.winehq.org/download/ubuntu\n\nA: That is really a pity that Adobe didn't create the version for Linux.\nHowever I used Inkscape, Gimp and Scribus for my hobby graphics. But finally when I bought Adobe Creative Suite I don't want to go back. The truth is that Inkscape, Gimp and Scribus are superb, but CS is much beyond them. However I am sure that regardless if You master Inkscape, Gimp and Scribus or CS5 You can make astonishing stuff.\nI have heard that Xara Xtreme is comparable to Illustrator and for now it is the best vector graphics soft for Linux. It did impress me, and I would reccomend it.\n\nA: As far as I know, there isn't such thing as a \"Creative Suite\". What you have instead are several alternatives to the different programs in Adobe's suite:\n\n\n*\n\n*Gimp vs Photoshop\n\n*Inkscape vs Illustrator\n\n*Scribus vs InDesign\n\n*Tons of editors and IDE's (such as Netbeans, Eclipse or Bluefish; or Kompozer, which is a WYSIWYG HTML editor, or Bluegriffon which is its rewritten although harder to use version) instead of DreamWeaver\n\n*etc\n\n\nThose programs might fulfill your needs individually. The thing that they miss, though, is the great integration between Adobe's suite products (same icons, same GUI, easy to share things between them and so on).\n\nA: There is Ubuntu Studio which is an Ubuntu derivative that is made for artists.\nIt comes pre-installed with the following graphics tools:\n\n\n*\n\n*The GIMP\n\n*Inkscape\n\n*Blender\n\n*Synfig Studio\n\n\nAnd a bunch of other tools.\nIt is kinda like a creative suite as an OS.\n\nA: Gimp is a little alternative to Photoshop but photoshop is so much more powerful than Gimp.\nInkSpace is a good free/open source application comparable with Illustrator.\nZendStudio is a good commercial IDE for php. Other IDE supports more language.\nLinux will have a better position if there is a Adobe Creative Suite like suite. \n\nA: I have an Imac with Adobe CS3, which I was considering to upgrade except for the cost. I rather spend the money on a new computer with more RAM. \nI have opted to try Corel Draw Creative Suite 6. I picked it up for 50 bucks on Ebay, the only catch is it only runs on Windows which I can run on a virtual program. I haven't tried it yet because I'm waiting for the new computer with more RAM. That's something you may want to consider. \nI'm pretty sure you can run a virtual program with your operating system. Read up on the system requirement for whatever virtual program you use. There is a free one called virtual box, but I don't know how good it is. \n\nA: For an alternative to Acrobat, try PDF Studio:\nhttp://www.qoppa.com/pdfstudio/\n", "Q: How do I move applications from one workspace to another I'm using 11.10 - please can someone let me know how can I move programs from one workspace to another.\nI'm used to the Gnome-2 style - is there a way to achieve something similar in 11.10?  \n\nA: You can do it. \nYou can use Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Arrow key to move programs from one workspace to another.\nI also made a fancy-smancy video showing you how its possible to drag windows between workspaces.\n", "Q: unable to set input method as ibus in gnome-language-selector I want to be able to type in Hindi  and want to set input method as ibus in gnome-language-selector window as shown on this blog\nhttp://www.pinyinjoe.com/images/ubuntu/1104/Language-Support.jpg\nHow ever each time when I select input method as ibus and close the window I log out and login again.Now check the ibus window preferences as in this snapshot\nhttps://picasaweb.google.com/107404068162388981296/UnknownAsianLanguage#5704526930860552098\nthe options to Hindi which should come as shown in this snapshot \nhttp://www.muktware.com/sites/default/files/images/applications/ibus-install-3.jpg\n is missing in my machine.

that uses Intel + Nvidia at the same time.\nTo enable your Nvidia card you need to install Bumblebee or disable the Intel card in your BIOS (if possible).\nIf disabling your Intel card in your computer's BIOS is not an option you have no choice other than use Bumblebee.\nIf you need information about Bumblebee please have a look at this post, it explains in detail how to enable support to run Ubuntu with both the Intel and the Nvidia card activated\n\n\n*\n\n*Is a NVIDIA GeForce with Optimus Technology supported by Ubuntu?\nIf you are using Bumblebee already that does not mean that vdpau support is installed, you need to install vdpau support for your card as described here\n\n\n*\n\n*How to enable VDPAU on GStreamer?\nAfter you have successfully managed run run bumblebee vainfo will still fail because the Intel card will still be the default card.\nI have found a script that will switch the card from the Intel to the Nvidia and try to open the media player. The basic instructions to use this are described here, remember this is a script from outside sources, no warranties that this will work are given, you can test it yourself.\nHere are the instructions taken from the bug report:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Build hybrid-windump but don't use the included xorg.conf! \n  https://github.com/harp1n/hybrid-windump (includes borders for entire dumped window) \n  https://github.com/gebart/hybrid-windump (included better cursor support, but dumped window will cover portion of Intel desktop and can't be moved) \n  \n*Start the Bumblebee X server \n  optirun glxinfo \n  \n*Run Compiz (or Metacity) on Nvidia display so the dumped window can be moved around. If you skip this, VDPAU playback will be green. \n  DISPLAY=:8 compiz --replace & \n  \n*Run mplayer2 \n  DISPLAY=:8 mplayer -vo vdpau videofilename & \n  \n*Dump window \n  ./windump :8 :0.0 & \n  \n*You now have VDPAU output! \nNB: This also works with Ironhide. \n\n", "Q: How do I configure Thunderbird to send plain text emails by default? Title pretty much says it all.  I want to tell Thunderbird to edit and send emails in plain text by default.  \nHow do I do that?\n\nA: As @enzotib pointed out in the comment, this is set up in the Account Options, under \"Composition and Addressing\"\n \nThen Thunderbird will compose emails in plain text. To switch from plain text for one email to HTML, hold shift while you click on Reply, Forward, or compose and it will let you compose in HTML.\n\nA: To stop Mozilla Thunderbird from asking you about the desired format when you compose a rich text message and click Send:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select Tools - Options (or Thunderbird - Preferences ... on a Mac) from the menu.\n\n*Go to the Composition category.\n\n*Make sure the General tab is selected.\n\n*Click Send Options...\n\n*Under Text Format, make sure something like Ask me what to do is NOT selected.\n\n\nI recommend Send the message in both plain text and HTML, which preserves any rich formatting while giving recipients a chance to choose a plain text alternative. \n", "Q: Slow wacom on virtualbox. Is it possible to solve it? I have a Wacom Bamboo that works out-of-the-box on Ubuntu 11.10 (even pressure). The problem, though, comes when using it on VirtualBox. \nIf I don't allow VB to access it, it recognizes the tablet as a mouse and works well (the same as when you plug the tablet the first time in Windows [normally, not on VB] and don't install the drivers). However, when I install the drivers and allow VB to access the tablet via \"USB devices\" it becomes really slow. I get pressure-sensitivity in Photoshop, but in exchange of a lag of seconds. \nThe question is.. is there a chance to solve this or is this something inevitable when using a tablet through VirtualBox?\nSorry, forgot some info:\nVirtualbox version is 4.1.8 (Oracle version, not the OSE), guest is Windows 7 (though I think it happened the same in XP). \n\nA: Try to use the options in Virtual Box like:\nSettings -> System -> Enable... (tablet)\n\nAlso ensure you have installed VB Guest Additions and the VB extension pack. And be sure to enable USB 2.0 support in USB options\n\nPlease note that Windows 7 will recognize your tablet as a touch interface and you will not see the mouse moving (although you will still be able to click). To solve this, you must disable mouse integration. \n", "Q: What tools do I need to use to report a bug in a developers PPA? When you want to report an error the best way to report a package in Ubuntu is                                   sudo ubuntu-bug package.  \nBut what if the package is in a developers PPA and I want to report an error with enough information, what tools can I use to generate that necessary information?\n\n\nA: The Ubuntu project & community does not take responsibility for PPA and their packages. The only packages that the Ubuntu community maintains are the ones found in the main, restricted, universe and multiverse repository.\nMost of the times, there is no way to use Ubuntu standard tools (like Apport) to report bugs against non-Ubuntu packages. You have just two options when you find a bug in a package provided by a PPA:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you think the bug is also in the Ubuntu \"official\" package, then remove the PPA package and test the Ubuntu package. If the bug can be reproduced, use ubuntu-bug to report it.\n\n*If the bug is only in the PPA package, you should get in touch with the maintainer(s) of the PPA.

GRUB automatically became the default boot loader.\nI don't want to mess with my windows7 installation. I just want Ubuntu on my external HD and GRUB should load only when I boot from my external HD. \nAlso, should the entire external HD be used for the installation or will a partition of say 30GB work.\nI have my Windows 7 auto backup in the same external HD too. Does Windows make the external HD bootable or something while storing the system images and backup files in my external HD, because then installing Ubuntu also on the external HD might cause problems.\n\nA: One solution is to make sure that the boot loader is installed to the MBR of the external disk.\nIf possible remove the internal disk before installing Ubuntu, make sure that Ubuntu only finds the external disk during the installation, when you want to run Windows7 you need to select the internal disk as boot device on your BIOS, when you want to run Ubuntu you need to select you external USB disk as boot device on the BIOS.\nThis way you have 2 disks, separate, both with information on the MBR and a boot loader but no interference between the 2 of them.\nAbout the sizes and partitions, if you are making backups to the external disk I recommend that you make a 3rd one on another drive just to be sure and during the Ubuntu installation choose \"Install Ubuntu along side with Windows\", Ubuntu will try to re-size the partitions on the external disk and install it self to the space you assign.\nIf you are not going to make a intensive use of Ubuntu for now 30Gb sounds good enough, you can re-size the partition later on to take more space from the backup partition later on if needed.\n", "Q: Why ubuntu sources are different to the originals?

They are allowed to do so, as almost every software there is free-licenced. They do not try to cover it, these changes are visible to anyone. In fact, they even change the package's version to indicate that it differs from the original release. The apt-get source command you executed downloaded you openssh-server in version 5.8p1-7ubuntu1. Notice the suffix. (You can check the version with any package manager). The scheme orig_version-XubuntuY is very common among all the packages. The X number indicates the revision number in Debian, and Y stands for revision number in Ubuntu.  Maybe you know about it, but as a side note to everyone who might read this answer: Most ubuntu packages are copied from Debian repositories - so if Debian developers released version 5.8p1 seven times, releasing it to repositories each time they have included their changes, and, this is the first time Ubuntu developers have released it with their changes, the resulting version number will be 5.8p1-7ubuntu1.\nWhy would they want or need to include own changes, if the upstream version is good enough?\n\n\n*\n\n*The upstream packages are provided for general audience. However, Ubuntu, as any other distro, has many specific changes, for example a tiny bit different organised file system. In this case any application that uses these parts of system's architecture, that are changed in Ubuntu exclusively, needs adapting to Ubuntu.\n\n*\n\n*A good example is that most apps are prepared so that they can work with Apport - the crash detecting and bug reporting tool, that is used in Ubuntu exclusively.\n\n\n*In many cases (though not in case of openssh-server) these changes are needed to ensure proper desktop integration. Not many apps are aware of Unity, since it's not common on other distros. This means that if the application should integrate with the indicators, Dash, or whatever else, the Ubuntu developers have to implement this feature and release the app with their changes to the repository.\n\n*All post-release bugfixes are released as a local (Ubuntu-wide) change to the source. The apps are never updated to a newer upstream release within a single release of Ubuntu. That means that if your Oneiric was released with openssh-server 5.8p1 it will not be updated to 5.9p1 - you need to wait for Precise, or get it yourself. However, Ubuntu provides updates that fix critical bugs and security issues. These fixes has to be applied to the version that's in approprieate Ubuntu series - in your case it's Oneiric - and released as changes done to the 5.8p1 version.\n\n*Sometimes applications developer's quality requirements are lower then Ubuntu's. From time to time it happens that Ubuntu developers fix a bug in an application before uploading it to repositories.\n\n*It happens also that the revision number is increased without any changes being introduced. This is the case when an application needs to be rebuild because of significant changes to (or new version of) a library it depends on. Then the revision number is increased just to bump the package version.\n\n\n\nYou can get more information about the changes at these two places:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://launchpad.net/ubuntu\n\n*http://packages.ubuntu.com/\nThere you can find the package you are interested in, choose the version you are interested in, and even download the debian source package to manually read all the .patch files, which are provided by Ubuntu developers and applied to the original source when building an Ubuntu package. \nAlso notice that these changes are always explained briefly in the package's changelog (available both at these sites and by using most package managers on your computer - but there is the link to your's openssh-server - read it at least to notice how the version number changes as patches are included).\nI hope you'll find it clear!\n", "Q: Difference between \"daily-live\", \"daily-preinstalled\" & \"daily\"?

I want to start jackd on startup either during boot or during logon instead of PulseAudio.\n\nA: You can add it to your start-up applications but maybe that's not very good idea as not all audio applications support jack. To make things easier there exist programs for managing and starting jack, and I think that is recommended way to use it. At least untill you get familiar with jack, and don't need assistance\nSo instead just launching it on start-up you could install QjackCtl or Patchage, and start and control various aspects of jack\n\nA: You don't need to replace pulseaudio.

You can not completely prevent a DDOS mind you.\nhttp://blog.bodhizazen.com/linux/prevent-dos-with-iptables/\nThe trick with iptables is to tune it to your server, my rules may not work for you, you may need to be more liberal or strict, but it should get you started.\nFor ssh I use these iptables rules for rate limiting.\nsudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -m tcp -m state --state NEW -m recent --set --name SSH --rsource\n\nsudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -m recent --update --seconds 600 --hitcount 8 --rttl --name SSH --rsource -j DROP\n\nsudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT\n\n3) For monitoring network traffic I highly advise snort, especially on a busy server.

Go to the manufacturer's site, go to their support section or the place where they offer drivers and software for download, and there will be a place to search for your model.  Chances are, they have a link to a PDF manual there.  Open it and search for the term Sync.

How? I am running Ubuntu on a VM.  I want to import my email contacts from Mac OS X google mail account into Thunderbird on Linux.

Then upload it to a personal storage (that is encrypted) to which you have access via a web interface from inside the virtual machine. In the client, download the file and import the exported contacts via the address-book (you can find it in the extras or by pressing its shortcut: [ctrl]+[shift]+[b]). There go to Extras->Import and you will be able to select the file you have created.\nThunderbird should be able to open all the file types that Google can export.\nIt would be even easier, if you would be using the online accounts that were introduced in 11.10 (iirc) with Evolution.

I took the path less traveled and installed Ubuntu on my CR-48. Mostly this is a completely standard install, minus it using ChromeOS's kernel (for drivers) but the main drawback is the 8GB SSD-- it became full rather quickly. At present I'm looking at 320MB free on the drive.\nI purchased a 16GB SD card and mounted it for DATA access and was able to offload some files to it, but it's highly under-utilized at the moment. I'm going to modify the boot configuration and mount some other directories there. Because it's flash memory, I'm thinking that good candidates are files that are written once and then read many times. I don't mind slow loading times so much, but I want to avoid completely stalling my system while I'm at it.\nI want to move /home to the external drive out of convenience-- I figure what configuration files are loaded don't need to be super speedy for performance reasons, and I want to be able to throw stuff in Downloads safely. Is it safe to move /bin, or other things like /var and /etc? The external drive is much slower than the SSD, but Linux also has some of the best RAM caching algorithms I've ever seen. I do know I want to keep /opt on the SSD, as that's where the Chrome cache seems to end up, so I want that to be as fast as possible.\nI guess that's a lot of buildup: my question is, which / directories in ubuntu linux need to be fast, and which directories can be moved to a slower drive without significantly impacting performance?\n\nA: There are a few additional things to consider apart from performance when moving root-level directories to separate mounts. \nOne of them is the fact that some directories are expected to be present during the early stages of boot process, before any partitions are mounted. I mean, moving /boot would obviously break things unless you take care to modify the bootloader telling it the new location of the directory. \nSimilarly, mount command is located in /bin, fstab is located in /etc and the very first process invoked by the bootloader, called init, is located in /sbin. Also, my understanding is that some binaries in /sbin may use libraries from /lib.\nI'm not saying that it's absolutely impossible to have those directories somewhere else - Linux is incredibly flexible - but it's kinda \"proceed with caution\" thing.\nMy understanding is that /opt, /usr and /var can be moved without much trouble, but I would expect that moving /usr to a slow drive would slow down things considerably as it contains all the GUI programs you're using all the time. At least, the programs will start much slower.\nAnother consideration is how much disk space you're going to gain by moving the directories to another drive... /bin is about 9 megabytes and /etc on my machine is 25 MB - definitely doesn't worth the trouble. /usr is the bulkiest one, so if anything, I would just move /usr and leave the rest on the root partition.\n", "Q: where do I get ndiswrapper v1.57? I am trying to get my wireless adapter to work.  According to some places, I need v 1.57 of ndiswrapper.

I don't know enough to know weather what I do works or screws up my system.\nWhere can I get a compiled 32 bit version of ndiswrapper for Ubuntu 11.10?\n\nA: You can get the latest ndiswrapper from the official website on Sourceforge (at the time of writing version 1.57 is the latest stable release). Ubuntu 11.10 has ndiswrapper-common version 1.56, Ubuntu 12.04 offers version 1.57. Honestly, although having the latest release of any software is ideal, I highly doubt that using ndiswrapper 1.57 over 1.56 will really make a big difference with your wireless adapter. I recommend first trying with the ndiswrapper-common package available in the repositories, if that doesn't work, then grab the latest stable release from the Sourceforge website and install it from source. Alternatively, you may be able to download the deb packages (your 32-bit compiled binaries) in launchpad for Ubuntu 12.04, but this could break your system and is not encouraged.\nNdiswrapper is tricky enough as it is for those configuring their wireless adapter in Ubuntu for the first time, it's best not to complicate things and use the version available in the repositories if that version can suffice.\n", "Q: ./configure not working \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I install tar bz2 and gz files?  \n\nI am trying to install Java 7 via tar.gz, but when it comes to the command \"./configure\", it says it don't exist.

I can fix this by switching workspaces, and the screen will stay at a constant brightness. Changing the brightness using the function keys triggers the problem again. Occasionally if I change workspaces too late the touchpad will stop working. This happens on Joli OS too, but not on Windows. Interestingly, the flickering goes on at the logon screen in Ubuntu, at which point I press Control Alt Left / Right. But, the flickering does not happen at the logon screen in Joli OS, but after I login it starts.Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: I used to have a similar problem with MSI U100 but an upgrade... well, I believe from Karmic to Lucid fixed it. Or maybe I somehow fixed it and forgot how. I do not have that laptop anymore. Maybe the problem was re-introduced after that or maybe (less likely) your problem is a separate one.\nIf you search internet you'll find that there are numerous reports of people having this problem with U100 and U120 netbooks, with different Linux distributions.\nSome reports suggest that upgrading BIOS fixes the problem. In case you decide to proceed you can get the new BIOS from the MSI website \n\nA: I set the automatic logon option in the logon screen settings to on, thereby bypassing the logon screen entirely. For some odd reason that worked. The screen does not flicker and I can change the screen brightness through the function keys without any problems. Odd. Maybe this is a bug in GDM, lightdm or JDM, but I don't have enough information to file a bug report.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu 11.10 from LiveUSB I'm trying to install 11.10 on my computer to dual boot it with windows 7 and when I'm in the try Linux area and try to install Linux off of my liveusb I get to the point where its supposed to ask if i'd like to install it alongside windows 7, but it never shows that option it only shows the options to install over the entire hard drive and the advanced options one ie it never recognizes that I have anything else on my hard drive could someone help me?\n\nA: Forget all these.

How to install LaTeX package called \"standalone\" properly so I can get update with Synaptic package manager?\nI know I can manually download the file and install it.\n\nA: \nUPDATE (2015-12-07): standalone.sty should now be installable with a simple\nsudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra\n\n. Keeping the answer for reference.\n\nThe search\nsudo apt-file search standalone.sty\n\ndoesn't give any results. This means that the package cannot be installed using Synaptic.\nThe reason is found in the answer by Martin Scharrer: The package is not included in TeXlive 2009 because it's too new. TeXLive 2009 is the version packaged with Ubuntu, there is no TeXlive 201. Also, the Ubuntu packages don't seem to receive updates once they're out.\nThe above is the reason why I installed TeXlive using tlmgr in my home, in ~/.texlive2011. Works like a charm.\n\nA: After installing and updating apt-file (sudo apt-get install apt-file; sudo apt-file update), I ran apt-file search standalone.sty and saw that it belonged to texlive-latex-extra.\nSo I just installed it (sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra) and it worked.\n\nA: I'm the author of standalone. It is newer than TeX Live 2009, which is the version installed by Ubuntu and Debian. The current TeX Live version is 2011. If you install the vanilla version directly you get a TeX packages manager called tlmgr which can be used to install and update packages as long as they are part of TeX Live. I heavily recommend you to do a manual install. You can find instructions on TeX.SX: How to install “vanilla” TeXLive on Debian or Ubuntu?\nThen you can install standalone with the following command:\ntlmgr install standalone\n\nBTW, you can update the packages and tlmgr itself using:\ntlmgr update --self --all\n\n\nAn alternative is to install only the package manually. This can be very easily done using the TDS ZIP file available under http://mirrors.ctan.org/install/macros/latex/contrib/standalone.tds.zip. Simply unzip it in your local TEXMF folder, usally ~/texmf. You might need to run texhash ~/texmf afterwards.\n", "Q: OpenCL broken on 11.10, CUDA works I have two GPUs, one is AMD (fglrx-updates) and one nVidia (nvidia-current), drivers from x-swat PPA.

I guess it should be responsible for HDMI port, but I didn't manage to run it as mentioned.\n(2) My solution for the \"mouse problem\" is to use \"void mouse\" on display \":8\" and than connect to it using VNC. In that manner I get a small window on my main laptop screen showing what is on the monitor.\n(3) Nvidia tries to force some high resolution like 1920x1200 on the monitor causing smaller ones to show \"incorrect frequency\" message. One solution is to run \nnvidia-settings go to \"GPU 0 > DFP-1\" section and unmark \"Force Full GPU Scaling\". It may be also necessary to set another frequency. The problem is if the monitor shows \"incorrect frequency\" message how to run nvidia-settings on it.

It should theoretically run without any problems and you can run it in Ubuntu.\nPlease visit their page for more information, there are precise instructions there:\n\n*\n\n*Dell BIOS updates using Debian based Linux systems\nHere are the instructions from the linked page\nsudo wget -q -O - http://linux.dell.com/repo/firmware/bootstrap.cgi | bash\nsudo apt-get install firmware-addon-dell\nsudo apt-get install $(bootstrap_firmware -a)\nsudo update_firmware\n\nPlease note: I have not tested this myself, you might first drop an email to Dell support to ask them if this method deprecated or if there are any issues with it.\nNote: As per 2020, this is outdated. firmware-addon-dell is not available for Ubuntu 20.04 and the the last commit to the github repo of firmware-addon-dell (https://github.com/dell/firmware-addon-dell) was on 2011.\n\nA: Recent Dell BIOSes have a built-in upgrade module.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the appropriate .EXE upgrade program from Dell website.\n\n*Write this file to a USB drive.\n\n*Insert said USB drive and reboot.\n(NB : if your computer boots in UEFI mode, you can instead put the .EXE in the /boot/efi partition : it should be found automatically)\n\n*As the Dell logo appears, press F12 to enter the One-time Boot Menu\n\n*In this menu, select Bios Flash Update. If this entry does not appear, your BIOS does not have the built-in upgrade module.\n\n*In the upgrade module, locate the .EXE upgrade program on the USB disk.\n\n*Launch the upgrade process.\n\n\nA: My 7 Steps To Happiness without using any external drives \nI've recently updated the BIOS of my Dell Latitude E6500 from version A27 to A29 under Linux Mint 17 KDE (= Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Trusty Tahr) with the CLI and here is what worked very well for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the needed DELL Software sudo apt-get install firmware-addon-dell smbios-utils wine\n\n*Check your BIOS version: sudo dmidecode -s bios-version My output: A27\n\n*Download your BiosUpdateFile.exe (in my case E6500A29.exe) for your specific device from the DELL Support Page\n\n*Switch to the directory which nests your E6500A29.exe and extract the *.hdr file from it with the command: wine E6500A29.exe -writehdrfile\n\n*Update BIOS: sudo dellBiosUpdate -u -f E6500A29.hdr\n\n*Reboot: sudo reboot now\n\n*Check your BIOS version again: sudo dmidecode -s bios-version My output: A29\n\nA: EDIT October 2015\nIn the post-Win7 era this answer has outlived its usefulness. Look at the other answers first. Read no further unless you have time to burn.\nOther answers posted to this question may work with older hardware, but I posted this after my experience of upgrading the BIOS of a Dell Inspiron 7520 (vintage 2012). Checking dates on unofficial Dell support web sites suggests that this may also apply to other Dell models since 2010 or even earlier.\nThe first step is to get information about your current system. In Ubuntu you can check the BIOS version with the following two commands:\nsudo dmidecode -s bios-version\nsudo dmidecode -s bios-release-date\n\nYou need information about your computer's hardware when querying the manufacturer's website. For Dell this is often printed somewhere on the underside in the form of a Service Tag and an Express Service Code. If this is not easy to read, the information can be obtained in the following way:\n1) Install libsmbios:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install libsmbios-bin\n\n2) Get the service tab etc. from the system:\nsudo getSystemId\n\nThis will produce output like this:\nLibsmbios version:      2.2.28\nProduct Name:           Inspiron 7520\nVendor:                 Dell Inc.\nBIOS Version:           ANN\nSystem ID:              0xNNNN\nService Tag:            NABCDEFN\nExpress Service Code:   NNNNNNNNNN\nAsset Tag:              \nProperty Ownership Tag: \n\nwith the key information in the BIOS version, the System ID, the Service Tag, and the Express Service Code.\nArmed with the above information, go to the Dell web site and download the appropriate driver(s) for your particular computer.\nSo far so good, but you will notice that the download is a Windows executable. Just as this cannot be run under Ubuntu (or any other Linux), it also will not run under legacy versions of Windows, in particular MS-DOS or any emulation of MS-DOS. This is in spite of anything it may say on the download page about being compatible with earlier versions of Windows; using any legacy DOS-type environment the .exe runs, but exits without doing anything except printing out an annoying message.\nSo, here comes the fun bit: you need a Windows 7 (or later) environment in order to run the BIOS upgrade. And how do we do that on a single-boot Ubuntu machine (or even a computer running legacy Windows, like XP)?\nThe key ingredient at this point is a Windows 7 Repair Disk. There are several ways to obtain one, including buying one from sources on the internet, or making friends with someone who has a Windows 7 computer. If you are lucky your computer manufacturer bundled one with your box. I chose to make one on my Ubuntu machine, using a copy of Windows 7 running in VirtualBox, adapting the instructions for making a rescue disk from this web site.\nThe good news is that it does not seem to matter which version of Windows 7 the Repair Disk is obtained from. Since this is a BIOS upgrade it does not even matter whether you use 32-bit or 64-bit versions if your computer is 64-bit.\nOnce you have a Windows 7 Repair Disk, the rest is easy. You can make it into a bootable USB if you wish, but if your box has a CD drive this is unnecessary. Here are the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Put the downloaded BIOS upgrade .exe on an ordinary USB flash drive.\n\n*Reboot you computer from the Windows 7 Repair Disk, hit the Space bar when prompted.\n\n*Navigate to the command prompt. (Use Recovery Tools->Command Prompt). \n\n*Find the correct drive letter for your USB (on the command line dir a: then b, c, etc. till you find the right one). \n\n*Navigate to it on the command line (type the drive letter with colon).\n\n*Run the file by typing its name (note tab auto-completion works :)).\n\n*From there, just follow the on-screen instructions, and make sure your computer stays powered-on while the upgrade completes. \n\n\nNote there are TWO automatic reboots before you get back to your Ubuntu startup screen.\n\nA: First, I would not update the BIOS unless there is a specific problem that requires a BIOS update to fix (such as activation of Virtualization technology).\nIf a BIOS update goes bad your computer can be rendered a paper weight.\nPersonally I use FreeDOS, although there are other options.\nI put it on a flash drive with unetbootin and add the bios_update.exe to the flash drive.\nYou then boot from usb and run the bios_update.exe from the DOS command prompt.\nIf you can to boot a usb, you can burn a CD.\nThe Arch wiki has great information with several additional options.\nSee : https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Flashing_BIOS_from_Linux\n\nA: For Older Dell Machines\nI have an old Dell desktop (Dimension E520 circa 2006) running Ubuntu. To update the BIOS I downloaded the required .exe from Dell. Then I tried to run it using the following:\n\n*\n\n*Using a USB drive with FreeDos. The machine wouldn't boot into FreeDos and it gave a Device not ready error.\n\n\n*SystemRescueCD - same problem as 1) above.\n\n\n*Used a Windows 7 64 bit installation disc, booted into Windows command prompt environment but an error \"image type is not present\" is returned.\n\n\n*In another thread I discovered that the error in 3) can be overcome using a 32 bit Windows disc. So I tried again with 32 bit. This time the exe ran, clicked the prompts etc. and no error messages, but the BIOS wasn't updating.\nFinally, I tried the method outlined here on the Dell support forums.\n\n*\n\n*Download the Dell Diagnostic Distribution Package (DDDP)\n\n\n*Run the DDDP & follow the prompts\n\n\n*Navigate to the DIAGS folder created by the extraction\n\n\n*Remove all files from the DIAGS folder except for the following:\nCOMMAND.COM,\nDELLBIO.BIN,\nDELLRMK.BIN,\nAUTOEXEC.BAT,\n& CONFIG.SYS\n\n\n*Add the BIOS .exe to the DIAGS folder\n\n\n*Navigate to C:\\Dell\\Drivers\\R174621\\ and run the DDDP .exe.\n\n\n*choose the Create a Bootable CD option (there is also an install to Flash Drive option, but I haven't tried this).\n\n\n*Load the CD into the machine. Reboot, F12, boot from CD and run the BIOS .exe.\n\nA: On newer machines, post 2015 I believe, you can simply put the .exe updater (even though the official description only mentions Windows) in /boot/efi/, reboot, press F12 and select Flash BIOS upgrade. I did this with the XPS 15 9950 and it worked like a charm. Also see BIOS update dell.\n\nA: You do not need Windows to install any firmware updates from their site, just follow the instructions posted here.\nFrom the Dell website:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the WIndows/DOS BIOS installer for your hardware from dell.com  \n\n*Download the latest SystemRescueCD and burn it to a blank CD or install it to a USB flash drive.\n\n*Copy the Windows/DOS BIOS installer to a FAT formatted USB stick or the one that you installed the SystemRescueCD on.\n\n*Boot from the CD or flash drive.\n\n*Choose to boot from FreeDOS in the floppy images menu.\n\n*Make sure you do NOT load HIMEM and EMM386 memory managers. \n\n*Change to the USB stick (typically C: if you do not have any FAT partitions on your HDD).\n\n*Run the installer\n\n\nExample when running the A14 update for the E7240 machine.\n\n\nA: Have you seen the DellBIOS - Ubuntu Wiki article??  It seems to be quite thorough and answers your question on how.\n\nA: These instructions from Dell worked perfectly for me after a couple of previous unsuccessful tries.\nhttp://www.dell.com/support/article/us/en/19/SLN171755/en\nComprised of:\n\n\n*\n\n*USB stick\n\n*FreeDOS Base ISO 1.0\n\n*UNetbootin\n\n\nUpdated my Dell Latitude E6420 easily from BIOS version A07 to A08 to A23 (A08 was required before I could flash in one go up to A23).\nSimple and fast.\n\nA: fwupdmgr is a firmware update manager client utility package that is provided by fwupd which is installed by default in all currently supported versions of Ubuntu. To update the BIOS of a Dell laptop  turn off Secure Boot and temporarily turn off TPM under the Security tab in the BIOS. You can turn TPM back on in the BIOS when you are finished updating the firmware.\nTo update the firmware run the following command in an Ubuntu terminal.\nsudo service fwupd start\nsudo fwupdmgr refresh\nfwupdmgr get-devices # scans all hardware devices and checks if updates are available\nfwupdmgr get-updates # prints \"No updatable devices\" if no updates are available\nsudo fwupdmgr update  \n\n", "Q: How to update Wine to the latest version? I just formatted my laptop and got rid of Windows 7. Yay ;-)\nEither way, Wine is version 1.3.28 here, and I need it to update (there are some bugfixes) for my game so I need a more recent version. This is the version I got from the Ubuntu software manager. How do I get a more recent version or Wine version 1.4?\nI've already added the repo into my repository, but still no updates.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Add the correct repo\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa\n\nUpdate your sources list\nsudo apt-get update\n\nUpdate or install wine to the version on the PPA\nsudo apt-get install wine1.3\n\nNote: even tough the package name is wine1.3 the listed version on the Ubuntu wine packagers PPA contains version 1.4~rc1-0ubuntu1~ppa1~oneiric1.\n\n\n\nA: In your case, since you have the 1.3.x repository it means you have the PPA from the wine site (ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa). You will have to wait until Scott Ritchie gets time to update to it. Right now he updated to the RC1 for the 1.4 branch. RC2 came today but like always the update depends on whether he gets time today or the following days.\nRemember that even if the developing branch is called 1.3.x it really is the \"Alpha\" or Work in Progress versions of the 1.4.\nIn WINE, the ODD versions are for development. The EVEN versions are the stable ones.\nSo the 1.0.x was the stable and 1.1.x was the development versions for 1.2\nThen the 1.2.x was the stable and the 1.3.x was the development versions for 1.4\nWhen 1.4 comes out you will see 1.4 as the stable version and 1.5.x as the development branch.\nFor more information see How to install and configure Wine?\n", "Q: Grub2 boot loader doesn't appear on boot Okay, install goes smoothly every time.

I installed Ubuntu in the dual-boot configuration so that I can still boot up in Windows. But I just want to get Windows off of the machine.\nAnyone know how to do this without having to go through another Ubuntu install?\nAlso are all of the Ubuntu updates safe to take? Does Ubuntu have restore points in case something goes haywire from the updates?\n\nA: *\n\n*Uninstalling an OS usually means deleting the entire partition. Use the Ubuntu live CD/USB to expand the Ubuntu partition afterward.\n\n*All offered updates are tested and should be quite safe to install.\n\n*No restore points.\n\nA: Since your question is really several questions, I'll divide my answer into parts. Unfortunately I'm sitting on my windows laptop now, so I can't generate any screenshots or even test the programs and see where all the options are - if there's something you can't find, don't hesitate to ask.\n1. How do you remove Windows from a dual-boot configuration without having to go through another Ubuntu installation?\nWhen you installed Ubuntu alongside Windows, the installer created (at least) one new partition on your hard drive, on which Ubuntu was installed. Windows usually occupies two partitions (one for the boot loader and one for C:\\), so that would mean you now have three.\nIf you, when you start Windows, have any files you want to save on C:\\, you need to back them up before you continue. One way to do that would be to simply copy them to the Ubuntu partition, which can be done by following these steps:\n\n*\n\n*Boot your computer into Ubuntu\n\n*Open Nautilus (the file browser, equivalent of Explorer in WinXP) and find your Windows partition in the device list on the left. Click the device.\n\n*Find your files on that partition, and copy them to somewhere you can find them. If you put them in ~username/backup they won't be in anyones way.\n\nNext, you want to remove the Windows partition entirely, in order to free the space so Ubuntu can use it. This most easily done with GParted.\n\n*\n\n*If you don't have GParted installed, install it by opening a terminal and entering\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\n*Open GParted by typing gksu gparted &\n\n*In GParted, locate the Windows partition, select it, delete it and click Apply. Warning! After you do this, the data on your Windows partition is lost forever!\n\n*Mark the empty space, find \"Create new partition\" somewhere and choose an appropriate name (\"Data\", for example). If you intend to only use Ubuntu in the future, you can format the drive as ext4 - but if you may want to move back to Windows you should probably choose NTFS so Windows can use that partition. NTFS works almost as well as ext4 under Ubuntu, but there are a few quirks - for example, Google Chrome (and Chromium) cannot download files to an NTFS drive.\n\n*Open \"Storage Disk Manager\" (for example by searching for it in the Unity search box). Click the partition you just created (you might have to look around for a while and click several of the /dev/sdaX options...) and configure it to mount on startup. Note the mount point that is shown - this is where on the Ubuntu file system you will access the files on the partition from now on.\n\nInstead of creating a new partition and mounting it, you could also start from a Live CD/USB and expand the Ubuntu partition. However, I would strongly recommend having a separate partition for stuff you want to keep regardless of OS version. My reasons for this will become apparent in the next part of this answer...\n2. Are the Ubuntu updates safe to take?\nIf, by \"Ubuntu updates\", you mean the updates provided by the package management system every now and then, then yes, they are safe and stable. However, the upgrade process between Ubuntu versions (for example from Ubuntu 11.04 to 11.10) is not always as stable, and it is usually recommended to install the new version from scratch instead of upgrading. (A fresh install is also usually a lot faster...)\nBecause this is so, it is often useful to have separate disk partitions for stuff you want to keep between upgrades. On my Ubuntu machine I have separate partitions for /home, /boot, and /data - and that has saved me many times when I screwed up some weird configuration file and had to reinstall Ubuntu to fix it.\n3. Is there any such thing as a restore points in Ubuntu?\nNo, there is not. Therefore, it is extremely important that you take care and backup any sensitive data that you do not want to lose before you alter your system.\n\nA: 1.Just delete the partition of windows...but while doing it be aware of where your grub is installed...\nCoz when I had done it,I lost my grub..!!!\nthough it can be restored by booting live and using bootupmanager....But still it would be good if you find out the details of the grub problem and only then proceed... :)\n2.All updates are tested.But the updates from 3rd party repositories you add may not be safe and cannonical/ubuntu does not take any responsibility of it.\n3.No restore points availible.You can use Ubuntu Tweak to generate Desktop,Applications backup and also the default backup program Deja-dup :)\nAlso as I constantly suggest,use UBUNTU ONE or DROPBOX or any othe cloud service to back up...IT HAS SAVED ME RECENTLY..!! :)  UBUNTU ONE IS A BLISS..!! :D\n\nA: You can use os-uninstaller. See details here.\n", "Q: How can I click the \"Home Folder\" on dash to open another Nautilus explorer when there is one already opened?

I have a Asus Brazos laptop with Ubuntu 11.10. I would like to share the internet connection of my Nexus One with my laptop.\nIn my Nexus One. I've seen these two options: USB tethering and Portable Wi-Fi hotspot do I have to make some configuration with them?\nAny suggestions to accomplish this?\n\nA: There are two ways to do this. Either by turning your phone into a hotspot, or by tethering via a USB cable. In your wireless setting on your Nexus you'll find this screen:\n\nSelecting \"Portable Wifi Hotspot\" will let you configure your phone as a wireless access point, you can then join your laptop to this access point just as you would normally use wireless. Make sure you configure the access point to use WPA in the \"Portable Wifi Hotspot Settings\" so you're not inadvertantly providing everyone around you with free wireless on your data plan!\nThe 2nd way is to plug in your phone into your laptop via the USB cable and then selecting \"USB tethering\". Ubuntu will think your phone is an ethernet connection and just connect automatically.\nI've done both, but given the option I use the tethering more as having both radios cranking on the phone can go through battery quickly, when you tether at least the phone stays charging.\n\n\n*\n\n*Documentation from Google\n\n", "Q: Any reason not to start openvpn as root? I'm running openvpn (client) on a home ubuntu server.\nI currently create the connection with the command:\nsudo openvpn /path/to/config/file\n\nIf I don't run it as root, I get an error that the TUN interface can't be created.\nI found an old thread on the topic where someone suggested adding your user to netdev, but after doing that I still get the same error.\nHow urgent is it to solve this problem? Does it really matter if I init the openvpn connection as root or not? Is it a security hazard?\nThanks!\n\nA: By default OpenVPN runs as root because needs it to create TUN devices.\nI dont know if there's any security hazard, but in their wiki, you can find a guide to start OPENVPN with other unprivileged user.\n", "Q: How to force Network Manager to set auto negotiation to false/off for a particular NIC (eth0) on start-up? It so happens that I have a NIC that is only able to establish a connection with the current network when auto negotiation is set to false. In windows, this can be achieved rather easily by changing the NIC properties via Device Manager. Currently I am only able to do so in Ubuntu (10.04 if that matters) via the following after login:\nsudo ethtool -s eth0 autoneg off speed 100 duplex full\nsudo service network-manager restart \nPS: I have read reports from ubuntu forums that it may be necessary to remove network-manager and only use /etc/network/interfaces for configuration, but I intend to do so only as a last resort. I would also appreciate it if someone can add auto-negotiation ethtool to the list of tags.\n\nA: There seems to be no way to do it within Network Manager. Editing /etc/network/interfaces on the other hand is clumsy and causes delays in later editions of Ubuntu like 12.04 (see this and this). In the end the solution offered here turns out to be best (for now), by adding the ethtool command to rc.local:\nsudo -H gedit /etc/rc.local\n\nethtool -s eth0 autoneg off speed 100 duplex full    # put this above 'exit 0'\n\n\nA: If someone else ends up with this problem of trying to configure network interfaces in 18.04, It turned out network manager was setting auto-negotiate to off for me, so on reboot nothing seemed to be working; ifupdown (deprecated), netplan, probably some other option because we can't pick a technology.\nUse\nnmcli c show \"Wired connection 1\"\n\nTo display current settings.\nUse nmcli c edit \"Wired connection 1\" to interactively set values (traverse the settings hierarchy with goto and back, change and set for values. There's built-in help):\ngoto 802-3-ethernet.auto-negotiate\nchange\nsave persistent\nquit\n\n\nA: I've had better results putting ethtool scripts in /etc/network/if-up.d. According to Network Manager documentation, scripts in /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d will be run after NM 'fiddles with interfaces'. On my 12.04 system, the only script is 01ifupdown, which will then run scripts in /etc/network/if-up.d (also /etc/network/if-post-down.d).\nThis sequence of events seems to happen well after the login screen appears on my system.\nI've found many occurrences of the following line in the system log which may explain what is causing the delay:\nNetworkManager[871]: <info> (eth0): carrier now OFF (device state 100, deferring action  for 4 seconds).\n\n\nDo not forget to put interpreter description (#!/bin/sh) as the first line of your script. Otherwise it will not work as NetworkManager uses the run-parts utility to run them. They also need to be owned by root and have write permission only for their owner.\n\nA: As Jeff M hinted, you can do this with NetworkManager and I've had pretty good luck doing it that way.\nCreate a file in /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/ named 50-ethtool-autoneg-off and put the following contents in it. Note you can change eth0 to eth* if you want to disable for any eth device, you could also add eth*|en* if you have a system using the newer \"predictable kernel names\".\n#!/bin/sh\nmyname=${0##*/}\nlog() { logger -p user.info -t \"${myname}[$$]\" \"$*\"; }\nIFACE=$1\nACTION=$2\n\ncase ${IFACE} in\n    eth0)\n        case ${ACTION} in\n            up)\n                log \"Disabling auto-negotation on $IFACE\"\n                ethtool -s $IFACE autoneg off speed 100 duplex full\n                ;;\n        esac\n        ;;\nesac\n\nYou do need a shebang #!/bin/sh or #!/bin/bash from the examples I've seen, and the permissions he mentioned are definitely important. It should be at least read/execute for root, and writable makes it easier to update without having to change permissions or force your editor to save.\nsudo chmod 0744 /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/50-ethtool-autoneg-off\n\nIf you have any issues with this let me know and I'll do some experimenting, but I'm currently using a similar method to change an interface from speed 1000 to speed 100 due to instability at the default speed.\n", "Q: Cross-platform Duplex scanner with good support in Ubuntu? I have tried Canon P-150 (review here), it works to some extent in Windows but I also use many other systems such as Ubuntu so it would be convenient if I could use the same scanner over many computers. Any good open-source-supported duplex scanner in small size on this market? If I could find an open-sourced duplex scanner with proper support, I am pretty sure I could get it working over the different systems. Or is this a pipe-dream? What about if I contacted some printd -software in my server that loaded the proprietary bits every time making the \"obfuscated\" scanner more cross-platform-compatible? Any such project around? (I know that would not really solve the social problem of distrust between manufacturers and users -- but just a random idea to get the so-called \"scanners\" even to work.)\n\nA: I have very good personal experience with the HP digital senders. \nbasically something similair to this this, http://www.ebay.com/itm/HP-9200c-Digital-Sender-Scanner-Only-21-051-scans-/170830490394?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item27c64a6b1a#ht_500wt_1129\nbut there are plenty versions around.\nI claim good compatibility since its a stand alone device.\nVery nifty. It can send you the scanned files directly as emails (pretty platform independent) there is also an app that scans the file directly to a folder on your desktop (probably not as independent as the email feature)\n", "Q: Is the power-cog supposed to turn blue when updates are available? My understanding was that the power-cog was supposed to turn blue when updates are available. But I've noticed that the updates-manager icon appears on the launcher with updates and my power-cog never turns blue. Also the envelope-indicator never turns blue when i have new emails.\nAre these bugs? Was I mistaken in expecting this? Is there something I need to do to activate the \"blue\" functionality?\nUsing 11.10 with Thunderbird..\n\nA: No, the power cog stays the same. You will be notified that updates are available by the Update Manager icon appearing in the launcher. If you want to customise it further, see this post.  \nFor the mail icon, William's comment is correct. Thunderbird has to already be running for it to notify you by changing the icon to blue.\n\nA: The mail icon turns blue only if Thunderbird is open and set up to check for mail automatically.\nI do not think that the power icon was intended to turn blue if there are updates. On my system, Ubuntu 11.10, the update notifier icon shows up (red or orange) and after the updates are done, if they require a restart another blue round arrow icon shows up.\n", "Q: The legality of duplicating the GUI of a commercial OS in an Open Source Desktop I had a question about the legality of duplicating the design of a commercial OS to an Open Source desktop. Let me just cut to the chase.\nIs it illegal to create a Desktop Window manager that behaves like, and looks like the Macintosh GUI?\n\nA: As far as I know, patents in Desktops are applied usuaislly to the interactivity concepts. The color pallete, font size, menu items, i.e., the style are not patentable. What can be patented are the concepts of a desktop - such as: a dock and finder (their interactivity and possible algorithm). \nSince the style is not patented, many FOSS substitute applications clone or inspire the GUI style of their proprietary versions (examples as: Cheese and Photobooth, Pidgin and MSN). \nNow, shipping the desktop GUI with a patented concept such as a dock can infringe patents. So, in the end the company needs to be careful to use abstract interactive desktop concepts on their GUI.\nSide note: The problem with patents is that usually they are very very broad. For example, in the dock component patent we can definitely fit the Ubuntu Unity and Windows 7 Menu.\n", "Q: Convert PDF to image I'm trying to convert a PDF file (it's a book) into an image.\nWhen I using convert like this\nconvert book.pdf book.jpg\n\nor like this\nconvert book.pdf book.png\n\nthen I get this warning\nWarning: Short look-up table in the Indexed color space was padded with 0's\n\nfor each page.\nIs there some other tool I can use for conversion to get a bunch of images for this, or can someone show me a different way to solve this problem?\n\nA: One different way would be GhostScript:\ngs -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=jpeg -r96 -sOutputFile='page-%00d.jpg' input.pdf\n\nwhere -r96 is desired dpi resolution\nOutput are multiple JPEG images.\nYou can generate transparent PNGs also if you wish:\ngs -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=pngalpha -r96 -sOutputFile='page-%00d.png' input.pdf\n\n\nA: convert -geometry 1600x1600 -density 200x200 -quality 100 file.pdf file.jpg\n\nWhen converting to jpg, you can use the -quality option. The \"best\" quality would be -quality 100.\nThere is a much simpler way to split multipage pdfs into a jpg:\n\nconvert -quality 100 -density 600x600 multipage.pdf single%d.jpg\n\n    The -density option defines the quality the pdf is rendered before the convert > here 600dpi. For high quality prints you can increase that number.\n    The %d just before the jpg suffix is for automatic numbering of the output pages 0,1,2...\n    The -quality option defines the compression quality of the output jpg (0 min ... 100 max)\n    The .jpg suffix defines the output format.

I just downloaded Ubuntu 11.10 for the first time. I really enjoy the launcher on the left hand side but have a problem. After playing around with adding applications in it, there are large spaces from the last application to workspace switcher. If I try to drag a new application into the launcher everything moves farther down, instead of filling in the space in between apps. When I right click on the launcher in a blank spot it reads \"drop to add application.\" I'm looking for a way to have all of the applications close together with no spaces, like when I first downloaded Ubuntu. \n\nA: I was having the same problem. My launcher seemed to be under the impression that there were numerous icons between the last icon on the list and the workspace switcher, which caused it to take up a ridiculous amount of vertical space.

But I have 2 choice:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows Active Directory\n\n*Ubuntu samba\n\n\nWhich one is reliable and secure? What are the advantage and disadvantage of both?\n\nA: It depends a bit on what you're actually trying to do.\nIf you just need a simple file server, then Samba is probably a bit more complex to set up if you're not familiar with Linux, but on the other hand it scales better than Windows and it doesn't require any license fees. \nRoughly the same is true if you need a domain controller, except that Samba current stable release (3.6) only does domain control in NT4-style domains. For Active Directory domains you will need Samba 4, which hasn't been officially released yet. Samba 4 lacks some Active Directory features that are present in Windows Server, but it's sufficiently complete for most small setups. It may be alpha in name, but it's really stable and used in production by a number of people. Samba 4 is definitely less polished than Windows though.\n", "Q: Removing the underlines from menu key words If I click on a menu at the top of the screen in, say, Gimp, and navigate through the options, then key words - or rather, key letters - suddenly become underlined.

If I upgrade to an LTS version, will it be able to upgrade to the next non-LTS release or will I be stuck with an LTS version of Ubuntu?\nI am currently using a non-LTS version of Ubuntu. When the next LTS comes out, should I upgrade, or should I skip it and wait until the next non-LTS version is released? I always prefer having the new features, so I don't want to stay with an LTS version and wait 2 years till the next LTS is released.\n\nA: There is no need to skip an LTS release. Those who want long term support without having to upgrade often may want to skip non-LTS releases, but there is no reason to skip an LTS release! You can simply use it and ignore the fact that it's LTS. Yes, you will be able to upgrade from 12.04 to 12.10, but NOT directly from 11.10 to 12.10.\n\nA: If you install a LTS release of Ubuntu that will not mean you will be stuck with it until the next LTS release. You will still be able to upgrade to the next version on the release cycle when ever you desire.\nAn LTS release if just another release except you are given more support interval.\nFrom the Ubuntu wiki\n\nA normal Ubuntu release is supported for 18 months. Previous Ubuntu LTS releases are supported for 3 years on the desktop and 5 years on the server. Starting with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, LTS releases will be supported for 5 years on both the desktop and the server.\n\nYou are free to upgrade from 12.04 to 12.10 as soon as its out, but be aware that if you do so it will no longer be covered by the LTS support and will be regarded as a standard release.\n\nA: When 12.04 LTS comes out (in mid/end April), it is still 'just another' release in the release cycle. Meaning it brings new and fresh things with it.\nNow it's up to you - and you alone - if you want to keep the LTS for the full support time, or as soon as 12.10 gets released, to upgrade to it. \nIn any case though, if you want to stay on 11.10 and hop on 12.10, you still would need to upgrade to 12.04 in order to be able to upgrade to the 12.10 release.\nUpgrades from one release to the following one are mostly seamless. A LTS release means, that it is a very stable release and conceived for long time users (companies, etc), but you are not bound to it!\n\nA: I would reccomend to wait a month or two, when the major bugs are fixed, and then go for LTS version. I only use LTS releases because more than innovations I need OS stability and robustness. And LTS releases (after some fixes at the very beginning) give me that. It is worth to use LTS releases IMHO.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 11.10 x64 and AMD Processor slow performance I'm having a problem with the last distributive of Ubuntu.

In Java, in order to support proxies, you need to have that support compiled in, or change your networking settings to use a proxy.\nHowever, Minecraft does not look at the network settings, so unless your proxy is set to all Internet traffic being sent via a proxy (which sometimes breaks things), it will not work.\n(Setting up proxy support in Java apps can be a pain, so I understand why the Minecraft devs left that out)\n", "Q: Add custom location in weather applet I am trying to add a custom location to the Weather Report applet (also known as libgweather) in Ubuntu 11.04.

I use a proxy to bypass it.\nWhat if I use my own squid server will it bypass my ISP block sites?  I need an easy and simple way to bypass blocked websites.\nFor DNS server I have tried OpenDNS and Google DNS. Now I'm using my own DNS server.\nAs for Tor, I have used it, it work fine at bypassing the block but not for playing YouTube or Flash videos. As tor using Arora browser, maybe that's why its not playing videos. \n\nA: It depends on how your ISP blocks websites.\nIn the simplest case, ISP's DNS server only returns wrong answers. Simply writing nameserver 8.8.8.8 (that's google's public DNS server, you can also use alternatives such as OpenDNS (208.67.222.222) or others, or your own DNS resolver) to /etc/resolv.conf will solve that.\nIf the ISP blocks traffic to certain IPs, you need to route through at least one other node, for example with an HTTP proxy (such as squid), SOCKS proxy, VPN, or an anonymization network such as Tor. The proxy must be installed in a censorship-free location; installing squid on your local computer will not change anything.\nIf the ISP blocks by keywords (i.e. uses Deep Packet Inspection), you can avoid those either with a VPN or an anonymization network, or with encrypted (e.g. HTTPS) connections.\n\nA: VPN software can be used for bypassing such restrictions as it fully encrypts the traffic between your server and your machine. I've written instructions for setting up the server and client in How do I setup OpenVPN so I can securely use the internet from an unsecured hotspot?\n\nA: Here are instructions on how to use Google DNS.  If you scroll down the page you will find instructions on implementing the change with Linux.  \nYou aren't limited to Google DNS, you can use OpenDNS which is also popular.\n", "Q: Touchpad stop working I have an HP 430 PC-Notebook using Oneiric.

Here is how I solved this:  \n1) Use the utility \"xev\" to determine what numbers the buttons you are wanting to remap correspond to.  You may have to install this package using \nsudo apt-get install xev  \n\nOnce xev is installed type \"xev\" into a terminal, and an X window that is white with a black box will pop up.  Moving your mouse into that window will begin registering events to the terminal.  Reading the output of that carefully will tell you the numbers of your mouse buttons. On my mouse, the left and right tilt map to buttons 6 and 7 respectively.\n2) Now we are going to use the utility \"xbindkeys\" to remap the mouse buttons to key presses.  If you don't already have this installed you may have to install it with \nsudo apt-get install xbindkeys\n\n3) Create a file in your home directory called \".xbindkeysrc\".  This is what xbindkeys will read to see what you are remapping.  The contents of my .xbindkeysrc file are:\n \"/usr/bin/xvkbd -xsendevent -text \"\\[Alt_L]\\[Left]\"\"\n   m:0x0 + b:8\n\n \"/usr/bin/xvkbd -xsendevent -text \"\\[Alt_L]\\[Right]\"\"\n  m:0x0 + b:9\n\nSo this tells my computer to send the keyboard button presses \"Alt+Left\" or \"Alt+Right\" to the system using the virtual keyboard (xvkbd) whenever button 8 on mouse 0 is pressed or button 9 on mouse 0 is pressed respectively.  These keys correspond to the the forward and back keys in most applications.  This will work, for example, in Nautilus, chrome/\nNote: you may need to install xvkbd if not already present on your system. sudo apt-get install xvkbd\n\nA: Easystroke is, well easy to configure.\nsudo apt-get install easystroke\n\n", "Q: How to run Lineage 2 on Ubuntu?

I don't want to expose my wallpaper to other people who share my computer, is there a way I can disable this feature or work around it?\n\nA: To Hide YOUR Wallpaper\nFirst and foremost, it sounds like the wallpaper is sensitive.  So you should make sure no one else can view it anyway, regardless of whether it's displayed on the greeter or not.\nTo prevent people from viewing your wallpaper file:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the File Browser\n\n*Navigate to the wallpaper file\n\n*Right click on it\n\n*Choose Properties\n\n*Select the Permissions tab\n\n*Under \"Others\", select the \"Access:\" dropdown and choose \"None\"\n\n\nThere.

Now enter the following command:\ndbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=org.freedesktop.Accounts /org/freedesktop/Accounts/UserYOURID org.freedesktop.Accounts.User.SetBackgroundFile string:YOURWALLPAPER\n\nWhere YOURID is the user ID you just got and YOURWALLPAPER is a path to the wallpaper you want to use.\nNow, if you change your desktop wallpaper after doing this, the greeter wallpaper will be reset to the desktop wallpaper.  So you will have to enter this command again to maintain separate wallpapers.\n\nA: For 12.04 \nTry the following commands in a terminal.

The problem is it's not respawning automatically when I kill the process.\nenv DAEMON=/usr/bin/memcached\nenv DAEMONBOOTSTRAP=/usr/share/memcached/scripts/start-memcached\n\nstart on started\nstop on runlevel [!2345]\n\nrespawn\n\npost-stop script\n  start-stop-daemon --stop --pidfile /var/run/memcached.pid --name memcached --chuid nobody --user nobody --exec $DAEMON --signal TERM\nend script\n\nexec start-stop-daemon --start --quiet --exec $DAEMONBOOTSTRAP\n\n\nA: This is a good start, but there are a few things you may have misunderstood about upstart here:\nstart on started\nThe started event is emitted every time any job on the system is started. You probably meant to have something else after started, like start on started networking. That would be incorrect too unfortunately, as networking is not really as meaningful as its name would imply. For memcached, it can pretty much run any time after runlevel 2 has been reached. So\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nWorks, and is necessary given your stop on rule:\nstop on runlevel [!2345]\nI know its a bit confusing, but you actually have to use '^' instead of '!' here, so you want\nstop on runlevel [^2345]\nAlso its worth noting that this will stop on runlevel 1, which is \"single user maintenance mode\". But your original start on would not start back up on runlevel 2. That would be a bug, so make sure that runlevels are respected properly.\nYour post-stop and exec ignore the fact that upstart is going to try and track this pid, but because the start-memcached script exits (because it lets memcached daemonize itself) the pid will be lost. This means upstart can't respawn, because it is not aware of the pid in the first place, and doesn't know that it has died.\nIf you want to be able to have it respawned, you probably want:\nexpect daemon\nexec $DAEMONBOOTSTRAP\n\nThere is no need to use start-stop-daemon in this instance. Upstart will keep track of the pid and when you do 'stop memcached' it will send it a SIGTERM. Also the config file of memcached already runs memcached as a user other than root (memcache actually) in Ubuntu 10.10 and later, so you probably don't need to worry about changing userid either.\n\nA: Here is the Upstart script I've been using for memcached.  This is strongly influenced by SpamapS response, but with a key tweak to drop use of start-memcached.\nUsing start-memcached results in three process forks to create the final memcached daemon process.  Upstart appears to only supports zero through three forks:\n\n\n*\n\n*Zero forks with no expect clause,\n\n*One forks with the expect fork clause, or\n\n*Two forks with with the expect daemon clause.\n\n\nIn my testing using expect daemon with the start-memcached wrapper occasionally resulted in Upstart tracking the wrong process ID, at which point Upstart enters a broken state where Upstart hangs when trying to start or stop the process.  Bummer situation that is difficult to fix without a reboot.  The discussion leading to comment number 47, here, has some good advice on whatto do if this occurs.\nAs a result I've moved away from using the start-memcached wrapper and simply inlined memcached configuration within the Upstart script below.  Since the process is run directly by Upstart there is no need for an expect clause.  A few other notes are included in-line.\ndescription \"memcached\"\n\nenv MEMCACHED=/usr/bin/memcached\n\nstart on runlevel [2345]\n# Not sure why it was recommended to use ^ rather than !.  I'm sticking with !.\nstop on runlevel [!2345]\n\n# This test is completely optional, I'm just paranoid.\npre-start script\n  test -x $MEMCACHED || { stop; exit 0; }\nend script\n\nrespawn\nexec $MEMCACHED -m 384 -p 11211 -u memcache -l 127.0.0.1\n\n", "Q: How to disable (hide) weekday in gnome-shell (GNOME 3.x) clock? I can't find a way to remove weekday name from clock applet in gnome-shell, is it possible without editing the source?\n\nA: Two answers to your original question:\nFor Unity, choosing 'Ubuntu' at the login screen you can do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the time and select 'Time and date settings'  \n\n*Select the 'Clock' tab\n\n*Un-check 'Weekday'\n\n\n \nFor Gnome 3, choosing 'Gnome' at the login screen you cannot do it:  \nThe setting does not exist as the screenshot shows below.\n\nBest bet may be a Gnome 3 extension, or a bug report.\n\nA: If you're using GNOME 3.x then you can adjust clock setting using gnome-tweak-tool. However, you can take out the the date but not the day (i.e. Sat cannot be changed so far as I can tell)!\nsudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool\n\nYou can also look in g-settings via a terminal: \ngsettings list-keys org.gnome.shell.clock\ngsettings set  org.gnome.shell.clock show-date false\ngsettings set  org.gnome.shell.clock show-date true\n\nwhich gives only two options: show-date or show-seconds!\nOr you can open up the configuration editor, then open \"org\" - \"shell\" and you will see calendar and clock which you can change manually.\nWhen you open the Tweak Tool and go to Top Bar, you will see the option for showing/hiding the date:\n\n\nA: I case you've missed it in comments, here are two patches:\nHide weekday\nhttps://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=669778\nCustom format\nhttps://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=669782\nHowever, they need a verification on the latest version of GNOME since I'm no longer using it.\n", "Q: select and drag-paste in terminal Generally this feature is there in web-pages, text files that when you double click( or select some text area) and drag it some other location, then it gets paste over there.\n\nlike above I selected so that and drag.\nI was wondering if same is possible in gnome-terminal which we use in linux system.\nIf any one has idea kindly share.\n\nA: It doesn't look like it. You can drag into the terminal, but apparently you can't drag from the terminal.\nPerhaps you already knew that though.\nWhat you should know, is that selecting copies into a separate buffer, that middle clicking pastes from. That'll be a bit faster anyway, and it works with gnome-terminal.\n\nA: You can't do it visually, in a GUI-mouse fashion. The terminal is line-oriented and selection only works within that framework.\nSee gnome-terminal usage guide\n\"To select a character at a time, click on the first character that you want to select and drag the mouse to the last character that you want to select.\nTo select a word at a time, double-click on the first word that you want to select and drag the mouse to the last word that you want to select. Symbols are selected individually.\nTo select a line at a time, triple-click on the first line that you want to select and drag the mouse to the last line that you want to select.\"\nThe 'dragging' mentioned here refers to adding to the selection area, not dragging the selected text.   Once you finish dragging and lift up on the mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.  Then you can use the middle-mouse button to paste it into your destination application.  \nOr, once the text is selected, use Control-Shift-C to copy, or right-click in gnome-terminal and select Copy, and then Control-Shift-V to paste, or select Paste from the context menu in gnome-terminal.   These are extra keystrokes or mouse clicks.  The automatic placement of the selected text onto the clipboard makes it very nice to just go paste with one mouse click.  That's only one more mouse-click than the feature you're seeking.\nIf you want, you can add a request for this feature to the gnome-terminal package at Launchpad.   I don't see any bugs there about this.\n(Need link to procedure to adding feature requests/bug reports here.)\nAlternatively, you can try a different terminal emulator:\nList of good emulators from TechDriveIn\n\"List of terminal emulators you may never have heard of\"\nArgument - er, Discussion - on the best terminal emulator\nI won't list them all here, reading the information about each from these links or your own search should help you decide which is the best one for you.\n", "Q: Portable User Account Is it possible to create a portable User Account in Ubuntu?

Is there a place in \"Ubuntu\" that stores a complete list of what keys/combinations/shortcuts are bound to what?\nWhat are Unity's keyboard and mouse shortcuts? list some \"Unity\" shortcuts to the Dash, Launcher, etc. and How to list Compiz keybindings in use? shows a way to list compiz bindings, but I'm looking for more than that (not just a few of the keybindings limited only to Unity or Compiz) although it's a start. \nIs there a global list of key bindings/key combinations/keyboard Shortcuts in use, that is stored somewhere in Ubuntu or is there a way to compile and list them? One that applies to Ubuntu and things running in it (Unity, Compiz, Shortcuts to Programs, etc.). \nSurely, Ubuntu must store this somewhere for the key combination pressed on the keyboard to be directed to what it's connected with? If there is no such place in Ubuntu, then post so as an answer, so future users, that search, will know.\n\nA: No, there is no single place where all shortcuts are stored.  Applications can choose to store their configurations wherever they choose.\nThat said, you're mostly looking at two levels: the application level (like Ctrl-C for copy in Firefox), and the window manager level (like Win+D to show the desktop).  Compiz uses gconf to store its configuration.\nFor applications, you can roughly divide them by their toolkits.  Namely, GTK apps use gconf too.\n\nSurely, Ubuntu must store this somewhere for the key combination pressed on the keyboard to be directed to what it's connected with?\n\nNot quite. The focussed application gets first kick at an X keyboard event, but if it doesn't, it bubbles up to other applications, namely the window manager.  Thus, you can have a game that captures Alt+F4 and doesn't close the window (damn you, Jamestown!). I think you're thinking it goes to some central event router, then matched against some database, and routed to its destination.  It's more like passing a bottle of drink around: pass, take a swig if you want and pass the rest, or take the whole thing and be greedy. \nThe Linux/FOSS environment (you may have noticed) is pretty democratic, and getting all applications to agree on a single central keyboard configuration repository is a fool's errand.  For one thing, you've got unmaintained applications that were written a long time ago and wouldn't know about it.\nUpdate: According to the Xlib docs on the subject: \n\nStarting with the source window, the X server searches up the window hierarchy until it locates the first window specified by a client as having an interest in these events. If one of the intervening windows has its do-not-propagate-mask set to prohibit generation of the event type, the events of those types will be suppressed.\n\nAlso, \n\nTo receive KeyPress , KeyRelease , ButtonPress , and ButtonRelease events, set KeyPressMask, KeyReleaseMask, ButtonPressMask, and ButtonReleaseMask bits in the event-mask attribute of the window.\n\nAnd you can set an attribute to disable propagation.\nThe problem is, you don't tell X which keys to listen for, so you can never tell a priori what keys the application listens for (let alone what they do) or really whether they intend to propagate it up if they are in fact listening for it.  Thus, a central registry is impossible at the X level, so you'd have to do it at the toolkit level, which is merely practically impossible. :D\n\nA: Since Ubuntu 17.10\nOn this paths:\ndconf dump /org/gnome/desktop/wm/keybindings/\ndconf dump /org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/  # Custom\n\nYou can also use dconf-editor (GUI) or gsettings (CLI).\nSince Ubuntu 12.10-17.04\n~/.config/dconf/user (in dconf-editor: org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys.custom-keybindings (custom shortcuts)   \n~/.config/compiz-1/compizconfig \nUntil Ubuntu 12.04\nThe shortcuts are placed differently depending on witch desktop you are using (gnome/unity, kde, xfce, lxde,etc).   \nFor gnome, they are under\n~/.gconf/desktop/gnome/keybindings (custom shortcuts)   \nand under\n~/.gconf/apps/metacity.  \n\nA: Your window manager gets the any key events before applications do, so if it wants to consume those events, it does so and your applications will never receive them. If the window manager does not want to react to the key events itself, it passes them along to the application. \nYou can verify this by yourself in the following way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start a terminal.\n\n*Start xev | grep KeyPress, the X event viewer.\n\n*Press Alt, note that xev shows that it got the key event in its terminal window.\n\n*Press Ctrl, again note that xev got the event. Take note of what the terminal window looks like right now.\n\n*Press Left arrow to go to another workspace. (I'm assuming you have that as a window manager shortcut key.)\n\n*Press Right arrow to go back to where you are running xev. Note that it never received any key events for you switching workspaces via left and right arrow keys -- the output is the same as it was in Step 4.\n\n\nSo you see that the window manager in practice gets all key events and if it does not want to capture them, it passes them along to the application. The application then gets to do the same for its own widgets (like how you can press Enter all day long in your web browser but it won't do anything until you put the cursor in the address bar or some field where you can enter text).\nIt is up to the application to set its own shortcuts, and applications are configured independently of each other.\nIn KDE 3.x, if I recall correctly, you could set the default shortcuts (e.g. Ctrl-s for save) in the KDE Control Center and it would apply to all applications written with the Qt toolkit, but I don't know if that's still possible since their switch to KDE 4.\n\nA: Applications store their shortcuts independently, so there is no central place, where they are stored. \nI don't understand the whole process of the interaction keyboard--OS--kernel--X11--Window Manager--Desktop Environment--Applications, but if a certain window, like Gedit, has the keyboard focus, it can handle the input on its own, and it does so.  \n\nA: In 11.10, under System Configuration -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts you get a pretty big list of them. Is that what you are looking for?\n", "Q: where can i download geforce gt425m driver? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow well do laptops with Nvidia Optimus work? \n\nHi people i have just installed ubuntu 11.10, so i do not know much about it.\nMy problem is that ubuntu does not recognize my graphic card.\nI use intel HD integrated (i3 processor)\nNvidia geforce GT 425m.\nBut ubuntu does not recognice my graphic card, under system info it says \nProcessor: Intel® Core™ i3 CPU M 370 @ 2.40GHz × 4\nGraphic:Unknown\nOS-type:bit\nHope some one can help me.\nThanks \n\nA: You can try to run jockey (just type jockey in terminal) to see if it will work.\n\nA: It's a sandybridge processor, which has an integrated graphics card.\nIt uses Optimus and there are no official drivers for Linux, which means you can only use the integrated graphics card (the one on your processor).

Until recently, Nautilus had an optional \"spatial\" mode as an alternative to its usual browser mode. Users could enable it by opening Nautilus's preferences and selecting \"Open each folder in its own window.\" Choosing this option resulted in a stripped down interface, and folders would always open in the same place on the screen. It looked something like this:\n\nThat checkbox is still there, but it doesn't do the same thing: while every folder opens in a new window, those windows are all the same size and positioned the same way. Nautilus doesn't restore the size and position of each folder, which is what spatial mode was all about. This difference really shows if someone opens a folder in a new window, and then opens the same folder again. Nautilus will create another window instead of focusing the existing window.\nI help someone who is currently using Ubuntu 10.04, and he will be upgrading to 12.04 in the future.

Everything works fine. I'm running it at startup, but I have a problem with rebooting.\nWhen I type sudo reboot now the state of the virtual Windows 7 isn't saved. After the reboot the virtualbox starts, but instead of the running Windows I get the Windows' 7 crash boot menu and the windows is booting again.\nIs there an option that Ubuntu could send some signal to the virtual box to safely close the instance before the host reboot?\n\nA: In case you really need to shutdown while a virtual machine in Virtual Box is running you could define your own script for a manual shutdown where you place a command to save the machine state before the shutdown process starts:\nVBoxManage controlvm <name> savestate # <name> is the name of your VM\ngnome-session-quit --power-off # this example displays the power-off dialog for >11.10\n\nAlternatively you could also generate a script that always runs at shutdown.\n\nA: If you use sudo reboot programs are given the kill signal ending them automatically without giving an application time to act on such situation. This is not a bug, it has always worked the same way and that is the expected behaviour.\nThere is a similar question where you can see which commands are given when you press the shutdown, reboot, suspend, etc button on the user menu, such solution should ask you what to do when trying to close a window with a running application and its preferable (in your case) to the sudo shutdown approach. Have a look\n\n\n*\n\n*https://askubuntu.com/a/1367/25863\n\nA: I would recommend a more sophisticated approach including an upstart job, a start and stop script. As example I am using Windows XP, as my home directory lets use tombert ... which you should change accordingly. It has the advantage of whatever you do (reboot, shutdown, pressing the power button) it handles your virtual machine nicely.\nFirst the upstart job, put into /etc/init/winxpvm.conf:\ndescription \"WinXP VirtualBox job\"\nauthor \"Thomas Perschak\"\n\n## 0: system halt\n## 1: single-user mode\n## 2: graphical multi-user plus networking\n## 6: system reboot\nstart on started rc RUNLEVEL=[2]\nstop on starting rc RUNLEVEL=[!2]\n\n## upstart config\nkill timeout 120\nkill signal SIGCONT\nnice -10\n\n## start WinXP VirtualBox\nexec /home/tombert/scripts/winxpvm-start.sh\n\n## stop WinXP VirtualBox\npre-stop exec /home/tombert/scripts/winxpvm-stop.sh\n\nThe upstart job starts the virtual machine in runlevel 2 (which is in graphical mode), and in my case it increases the priority with nice. In order to nicely shutdown the virtual machine I need to \"disable\" the upstart termination using the kill signal SIGCONT statement. This leaves the virtual machine running at first (avoiding the default SIGTERM). After 120 seconds the SIGKILL is send anyhow. Instead I am running the winxpvm-stop.sh script.\nSide-Note 1: The stanzas start on started runlevel [2] and stop on starting runlevel [!2] do not work. One has to specifically mention the job rc.\nSide-Note 2: What is confusing also from the upstart manual: The kill signal stanza specifies the signal sent after 5 seconds. In this example I set it from SIGTERM (default) to SIGCONT - but the 5 seconds timeout I was unable to change. The kill timeout stanza specifies the timeout after which the SIGKILL is sent - which signal one cannot change. An improvement therefore would be to define new stanzas term signal and term timeout.\nHere the start script winxpvm-start.sh:\n#! /bin/bash -e\n\nfunction dostart()\n{\n    echo -n \"Running WinXP ... \"\n    vboxheadless --startvm WinXP\n    echo \"now closed\"\n}\nexport -f dostart\n\nif [ $(whoami) != \"tombert\" ]; then\n    su -c dostart tombert\nelse\n    dostart\nfi\n\nSince all the settings etc. are done in user mode (as my login is tombert), even when run as root I change the account to tombert. The user of course could be changed in the upstart configuration but this solution leaves me the option to start/stop the virtual machine \"by hand\" from the console.\nThe more interesting is the shutdown script in winxpvm-stop.sh:\n#! /bin/bash\n\nfunction dostop()\n{\n    ## check if WinXP is running\n    vboxmanage showvminfo WinXP --machinereadable | grep -q 'VMState=\"running\"' &> /dev/null\n    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then\n        echo \"WinXP not running\"\n        exit\n    fi\n    ## try gracefully shutdown\n    echo -n \"Shutting down WinXP ... \"\n    #vboxmanage controlvm WinXP acpipowerbutton\n    vboxmanage guestcontrol WinXP execute --image \"%SystemRoot%\\system32\\shutdown.exe\" --username tombert --password <mypassword> --wait-exit -- \"-s\" \"-f\" \"-t\" \"0\" &> /dev/null\n    ## check vm status\n    INDEX=60\n    while [ $INDEX -gt 0 ]; do\n        echo -n \"$INDEX \"\n        vboxmanage showvminfo WinXP --machinereadable | grep -q 'VMState=\"running\"' &> /dev/null\n        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then\n            echo \"gracefully done\"\n            break\n        fi\n        sleep 1\n        let INDEX+=-1\n    done\n    ## close forcefully\n    if [ $INDEX -eq 0 ]; then\n        vboxmanage controlvm WinXP poweroff &> /dev/null\n        echo \"forcefully done\"\n    fi\n}\nexport -f dostop\n\nif [ $(whoami) != \"tombert\" ]; then\n    su -c dostop tombert\nelse\n    dostop\nfi\n\nFirst I do the same as in the start script - I am changing the user from root to my account tombert. Now lets look at the function dostop. First I am checking if the virtual machine is even running. Then I am trying to \"softly\" shutdown by sending a shutdown directly to WinXP using guestcontrol. Here you must provide the credentials for the WinXP account, which in my case is tombert and a password. The Windows shutdown will gracefully close all applications and power off the operating system (normally). Then lets check the virtual machine state continuously using showvminfo. Doing this at least 60 times with 1 second timeout (do whatever you think appropiate is here) should leave the virtual machine enough time to shutdown gracefully. Note that the call to showvminfo also takes a little bit less than a second (at least on my computer) so this gives it ~120 seconds in my case. If everything brakes we can forcefully shutdown using the poweroff statement.\nYou also should see the acpipowerbutton, but unused. This is because it does not work reliable. If you are logged on to Windows, or even worse multiple users, Windows will show a confirmation shutdown dialog preventing the system from shutdown. This is also the reason why the acpibutton in the /etc/default/virtualbox will not work 100% reliable. Also the poweroff will forcefully shutdown the virtual machine - same as a long-press power button. Therefore it is best to set this to empty:\nExcerpt from /etc/default/virtualbox:\n# SHUTDOWN_USERS=\"foo bar\"  \n#   check for running VMs of user 'foo' and user 'bar'\n#   'all' checks for all active users\n# SHUTDOWN=poweroff\n# SHUTDOWN=acpibutton\n# SHUTDOWN=savestate\n#   select one of these shutdown methods for running VMs\n#   acpibutton and savestate causes the init script to wait\n#   30 seconds for the VMs to shutdown\nSHUTDOWN_USERS=\"\"\nSHUTDOWN=\"\"\n\nTo make it perfect you might want to change the power button behaviour:\nExcerpt from /etc/acpi/powerbtn.sh:\n#!/bin/sh\n# /etc/acpi/powerbtn.sh\n# Initiates a shutdown when the power putton has been\n# pressed.\n\n# @backup\n# plain shutdown\n/sbin/shutdown -h now \"Power button pressed\"\n\n# fini\nexit 0\n...\n...\n\nThere is one little drawback left. When the virtual machine is still booting and the guest control service is not up (in the virtual machine) it will not receive the shutdown command. A rare case ... but think about it.\nThats it, hope it helps.\n\nA: Follow this answer to change your system policy for rebooting\nYou can't streamline this into reboot. AFAIK init.d scripts will not work because it takes too much time, but you can run the command like this:\nVBoxManage controlvm <vm> savestate&&reboot\n\nwhere <vm> is the name of the Virtual Machine\n\nA: You can send a shutdown request to the virtual machine with:\nVBoxManage controlvm <vm_name> acpipowerbutton\n\nBut if you do this in an init script, the script should not exit until the shutdown has completed.  We may be able to detect that by polling the VM's drive file (.vdi) with lsof or fuser in a loop.  Or as a cheap workaround, sleep 20 may suffice.\nHere is what I am currently using in the close block of my init script:\n# This always returns 0, even if an error is displayed!\nsu - \"$DAEMONUSER\" VBoxManage controlvm \"$VMNAME\" acpipowerbutton\n\n# Wait until the disk file is no longer open...\nfor attempt in `seq 1 20`\ndo\n    fuser \"$VMDISKIMAGE\" >/dev/null 2>&1 || break\n    sleep 2\ndone\n\nreturn 0    # A better script would return success/fail\n\nNear the top of the file I defined:\nVMDISKIMAGE=\"/home/$DAEMONUSER/VirtualBox VMs/$VMNAME/$VMNAME.vdi\"\n\nThis may not actually close the VirtualBox app itself, but it does wait for the VM to complete shutdown.  Also it does not work if the virtual machine is still in the process of booting up (many operating systems ignore the power-off button during this phase), or if you are emulating an old system with no ACPI support. \n", "Q: How do I generate a TSP art?

Install the recommended proprietary graphics driver from the default Ubuntu repositories and then reboot the computer to enable the graphics driver.  \nThe proprietary AMD graphics drivers from the official AMD website sometimes have marginal performance improvements over proprietary AMD graphics drivers from the Ubuntu repositories, however this comes at a cost of increased risk of problems, including boot failure. The real advantage of installing the proprietary AMD graphics drivers from the official AMD website is that they sometimes work better with very new models of GPUs because they are more up-to-date than the proprietary AMD graphics drivers that come from the default Ubuntu repositories.  \nNote: If you have already installed a proprietary graphics driver that you downloaded from the official AMD website, the command: ubuntu-drivers devices will automatically show it as the recommended driver, so if you want to know the recommended proprietary AMD graphics driver that comes from the default Ubuntu repositories, you have to uninstall the proprietary graphics driver that you downloaded from the official AMD website before you run ubuntu-drivers devices in order to show this information in the terminal. \n", "Q: Show all running windows when moving mouse pointer to top-left corner hotspot? Currently in 11.10 (and also 12.04), slamming your mouse pointer in the top left corner of the screen does nothing.  Worse, even clicking there is a dead zone; I would expect to have at least the dash open when clicking there.  Not sure if this is a bug or not.\nIdeally I would like to have the Gnome 3 behavior, which shows all open applications when you move the mouse pointer to the top-left corner.\nI know I can do something with Compiz Settings; I can configure a script to run, however I don't know how I can make a script go ' Super + W '?   Is that possible?\nI hope there will be a full and unified settings panel again when 12.04 goes live; it's a bit strange to not only use a whole separate settings panel for some things, but even one that's not installed by default!  And 'corner hot spots' should definitely be a function in there, to assign common actions and keystrokes to that.\n\nA: Although xdotool is a more generic solution, compiz has a solution for this:\nInstall CompizConfig Settings Manager, go to the Scale plugin, Bindings tab and choose 'Initiate Windows Picker'. Choose any corner/edge to show all the windows.\n\nA: To make a Script to invoke Super+W you need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install xdotool (sudo apt-get install xdotool)   \n\n*Create a new empty document in gedit and add this:  \n\n\n\n#! /bin/sh\n\n# Assumes compiz binding for Scale is Super + W\n\nxdotool keydown Super && xdotool key w\n\nxdotool keyup Super\n\n\nThen save, make it executable (right click the script and set it to executable) and create a Launcher (.desktop file) in the Unity Launcher.\nAlternatively to make use of the Compiz Hot corners take a look here.\n\n\n*\n\n*Hot corners not working after updating to 11.10\n\nA: In 13.04:\nInstall Unity Tweak Tools. Go to 'Window Manager' -> 'Window Spread' and choose 'Hot Corners' tab. Bind top-left corner to 'window spread'.\n\nA: I really hope this helps someone!\nI've been using Windows for 20 years!!!\nI used a Mac for the first time on a temporary assignment recently and loved it (want one now - they're like silk!) \nSo I started thinking about Linux OS (because Mac is based on unix isn't it?), and in particular I loved this behaviour.\nSo I came across Fedora (20) and just \"chose\" it (without looking for this hotspot behaviour actually) and was really pleased to find it had a top-left hotspot active by default.\nSo I started learning Linux/bash/cli and most solutions on Stack O F and whilst googling for answers were for Ubuntu and never worked on Fedora! \nEventually, looking for an extra hour for \"Fedora only\" solutions time after time wore me out (4 days!!!) so I ditched Fedora (nice, slick, solid - just not as popular therefore not as well supported in the \"googling for answers\" sense) in place of Ubuntu!\nMan, was I disappointed about this hotspot thing!\nUbuntu 14.04 didn't have this feature straight out of the box, nor was it configurable!\nI figured that I could \"skin\" my desktop so I googled \"ubuntu touch corner screen like fedora\" and found this web-page\nHere it said that Gnome Shell 3 had this behaviour and it was available in the \"Ubuntu Software Centre\" (which is on the Ubuntu dock by default)  \n\nIf you want to install the GNOME Shell on Ubuntu, just head into the Ubuntu Software Center and search for GNOME Shell. Install it, then log out of your system—you should see a small gear icon on the login screen, which you can then use to boot into the GNOME Shell instead of Unity.\n\nI tried out 3 of the 4 gnome shells from this package and found them to be a backwards step, as in \"going back in time\" backwards!\nThere's nothing wrong with Gnome shell for those who love it - that's just my 10 minute appraisal after using Ubuntu Unity for 24 hours and switching to Gnome for a quick appraisal! The webpage above also showed it to be lacking in features and a touch irritating \nAbout the Gnome Dock (and why it's outdated):\n\nNot only is it annoyingly hidden away, but adding more icons shrinks it down, à la Mac OS X, as opposed to making it scrollable like Unity's. This doesn't seem like a problem at first, but it gets a lot harder to use if it shrinks down far, and it starts shrinking down long before it fills the entire side of the screen...\n\nCompare this to the Unity dock:\n\nUnity's dock is sadly not movable from its left-hand position, which is very annoying (Isn't Linux is supposed to be super customizable?). However, despite this annoyance, it does have some nice Ubuntu integration that you don't get in the GNOME Shell—for example, you can right-click on Thunderbird's dock icon to compose a new message or browse your address book\n\nand more Unity goodness...\n\nThe Dash: You can access Unity's application launcher—called the Dash—by hitting the Windows key on your keyboard or by hitting the Dash icon at the top of Unity's dock. The Dash is a panel that replaces the drop-down menus of classic GNOME. From it, you can search through all your installed apps, settings, files, or even music from one location. You don't need to click on the search box either—just open up the Dash and start typing. It'll even show you apps that you don't have installed, but that you can download from the Ubuntu Software Center, which is convenient. By default, the Dash searches through your apps, though you can hit the icons across the bottom of the Dash to search through files or music through their own \"lenses\". This is a pretty nice feature, and it makes the Dash pretty versatile\n\nMost people would probaly say I'm a Unity fan but I'm not - I'm a fan of clever design and good UI/UX - and to be honest I've only been using it for around 24 hours and reading this comparison really helped me decide and I started to get cold feet (change my mind) about this whole Gnome shell thing!\nSo then I thought \"this thing's called Ubuntu Unity right - why not try \"Ubuntu Unity hotspot\" in google\"  and that led me to this thread real quick!\nSo I started reading the solutions and saw the nerdy code idea and thought ... nah!\nI like coding but I'm rubbish at it and this linux bash/cli thing is pretty confusing:\n\"root, sudo, chmod, chown, 777, 644, owxr, /, ~/, $HOME, ls, vi, pwd, as root, never login as root, owner of apache2, PERMISSIONS (great but confusing), yum, rpm, apt-get\" etc, etc. \nI'm sure you get my point!\nAnyway, that made me try the CompizConfig solution and I got some sort of error whilst installing and that made me think it wouldn't work so I went on to  install Unity Tweak Tools.\nI followed the instructions and blam...it worked!\n\nGo to 'Window Manager' -> 'Window Spread' and choose 'Hot Corners' tab.\n\nYou can install it from the Ubuntu Software Centre and you can access it from the \"Dash\" by clicking the top icon on the dock (default) or by hitting your Windows/Start button.\n", "Q: How can I enable wifi on my Ubuntu 11.10 xps l702x? Network configuration:\n'Wireless is disabled by hardware switch'\n'Enable wireless' is disabled and I can not enable it\nWhen I press Super+F2 - no results. Wifi is not fires on a pad.\n\nA: I had the same problem, this fixed it for me:\nsudo modprobe iwlagn power_level=5\nsudo modprobe btusb reset=1\nsudo rfkill unblock all\n\nThen disable and re-enable wifi with fn+f2.\nAfter that, fn+f2 works, bluetooth can be disabled without disabling wifi, and wifi can be re-enabled after it is disabled.\n\nA: Had the same experience. I disabled wireless (in Ubuntu's network manager) and then was unable to re-enable it. Fn+F2 doesn't do anything inside Ubuntu; I needed to reboot Windows to re-enable wireless, where Fn+F2 behaved as expected.\n\nA: I had the same problem with the Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition (i.e. Ubuntu pre-installed). A workaround was to reboot, but it only helped when I first pressed Fn+F2 again (so that it should work) and then re-booted.\n\nA: The Intel wireless driver module appears to have been renamed.

That is: in sqldeveloper.sh replace ~ with path to home dir.\n", "Q: How do I open new windows of a running app on another workspace under Unity? Since Ubuntu 11.10, it is really difficult to get multiple workspaces like Ubuntu 10.04.\nFor example:\nWhen I wanted to open a new Firefox window, I just had to go to the next workspace and hit the Firefox icon.\nWith Unity, this isn't possible anymore. When I hit the icon, it goes back to the original Firefox window.\nI know it is possible to use GNOME Classic, but this doesn't work very well and is not stable.\nHow can I achieve this?\n\nA: You rely on a couple of flawed assumptions. First; it is not obvious that Mark Shuttleworth makes all these decisions. I hardly believe Ubuntu would've become such a success if he was a one-man show. It is a collective effort. Also, you assume that \"this really handy function\" has been thrown away. It hasn't.\nOk, now let's look at your question. It seems to be about how to launch a new instance of Firefox when there's already one running. Easy; middle-click it. Or if you use keyboard shortcuts, append Shift. For instance, if Firefox is number two on your launcher, press Super+Shift+2 to launch a new instance. You can then use Super+BAT (button above tab) to switch between Firefox instances, and you'll be moved to the correct desktop if they're on different ones. It will remember the window order, so you will also be able to use Alt+Tab to switch between the most recently used instances per application. \nThe cube and other Compiz effects are still available. Unity itself is a Compiz plugin, so none of those options have been removed. \n\nA: Click the icon with the middle mouse button to open a new window instead of going to the old one.\n\nA: Another solution is to Right-Click the icon in Launcher and select \"Open a New Window\".\nI've tested in 12.04 and it does not switch workspaces, even if the current Firefox is in another workspace, and you right-click its icon, workspace will not switch. And your new window will be opened in your current workspace.\nThe only con of this approach is that not all applications have this \"New ...\" option in their right-click menu. But thankfully there is for, just to name a few:\n\n\n*\n\n*Firefox\n\n*Nautilus\n\n*Gedit\n\n*Terminal\n\n\nWhich, for me, easily cover > 95% of the applications I want to open multiple windows.\n", "Q: How can I run different XFCE sessions for the same user? I like to have two (or more) different XFCE sessions for one user which have differences in autostart programs, panel design and others.\nIs it possible to make that, are there profiles for XFCE? (For LXDE, there are)\nHow can I set / switch between different profiles?\n\nA: I am not sure whether the settings that you want are user- or session-specific. You can try and see.\nIn Settings Manager - Sessions and Startup - General: check 'Display chooser on login' so as to be prompted after login to chose between your Xfce sessions. To save a certain session, you can save it manually ( Settings Manager - Sessions and Startup - Session) or check 'Automatically save session on logout\" (Settings Manager - Sessions and Startup - General). \n", "Q: Change curser location to bring up Unity launcher I want the launcher to show when I move the cursor to the top-left corner instead of the left edge because the way it is it tends to show when I don't want it to. How can I do that_\n\nA: For 11.10 and earlier\nTo adjust the reveal mode of the Launcher, you can use compizconfig-settings-manager . You can install CCSM by running the following command in a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\n\n*\n\n*What are some of the issues with CCSM and why would I want to avoid it?\nAfter installing CCSM, open it and click on 'Ubuntu Unity Plugin'.\n\nClick on the option and click on the option for 'Reveal mode'. There, you can choose which part of the screen should trigger the launcher.\n\nFor 12.04\nThere is a much easier way to change the reveal mode of the launcher in 12.04.\nTo do that, you can right click on the desktop and click 'Change Desktop Background' option. \n\nAfter that, in the 'User Interface' application that appears, move to 'Behaviour' tab. There, you can change the 'Reveal spot' of the launcher.\n\n\nA: Right now you can't do this in Unity on Ubuntu 11.10 You can try out GNOME 3, or test the amazingly stable 12.04 beta, in which they have implemented in Unity 5.2, or you can install the Unity team's PPA and use the beta version of Unity. 11.04 also had this feature.

Click on the \"Preferred Applications\" icon. Select the \"Utilities\" tab, and under \"File Manager\", drop down the list and select \"Nautilus\".\nSummary: Applications Menu/Settings/Settings Manager/Preferred Applications/Utilities/File Manager, then select Nautilus.\nThe next step is to go back to the Applications Menu and click on \"System\", then click on \"Synaptic Package Manager\". When Synaptic opens, search for the package named \"nautilus-share\". If it is not already installed, install it now. Close Synaptic when you are finished, then reboot the computer. When you open a new folder window, right-clicking on any folder will allow you to set the \"Sharing Options\".\nNote: Any folder icons that you already placed on your desktop using Thunar will remain Thunar objects. Delete them and create new folder icons with Nautilus, if you want to.\nAnother note: If you want to see \"Shared Folders\" on your Applications Menu, go to Applications Menu/Settings/Main Menu, and in the left column, select \"System\". You will see \"Shared Folders\" in the right column.

When I install Ubuntu, it never shows an option to set a password, yet there is a password when trying to log in to the admin account and when I try to install packages. I can't change the password in Root because when I try to it says \"Authentication manipulation token error\". When I try to fix the shadow password thing in root it says access denied.\n\nA: You aren't supposed to add a password for the root account. We have something called the sudo mechanism to handle that. Instead, you add users to the admin account. All those users can then run commands or programs as root by running sudo command for terminal commands or gksu command for GUI apps to run as root, such as gksu gcalctool though that example obviously makes no sense) \nWhen you're being asked for a password when installing things, etc, it is your own password you should use. This way, it is possible to enable others to do administrative tasks without having to share passwords and keys. It is also configurable to allow someone to run a specific command as root, but not others, but you won't normally touch that. \nThe first user you created is by default the admin account. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo\n\nA: You can use root privilege to run commands/applications by adding sudo , gksu key word on start of any command. like sudo gedit and it will ask you admin password\nAlso for switch terminal to root level, use sudo su.\nIn any case, you can change root password by following procedure:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Start a terminal (by pressing Ctrl+t)  \n\n*Run sudo -s to accessing root privilege   \n\n*Run passwd root for changing root password.

Preferably png or pdf?\n\nA: A typical .ai file (from version  9 up), saved the normal way (with PDF compatibility) does not need any special conversion (in most cases). For example, if you take a typical .ai file ...as I said, saved with PDF compatibility which is the default ... you can simply add .pdf to the end, and then open it in your default PDF viewer.

Better to use a persistent /home (make a file on the usb called home-rw ).\nSee:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCD/Persistence\nIf all that is too much hassle, do a standard install to the flash drive (not unetbootin, install ubuntu to the flash drive).\n\nA: Updating a persistent install will quickly fill a flash drive, once filled it will not boot until the casper-rw file is reduced in size.\nYou can not upgrade a persistent flash drive since the kernel is part of a read only file.\nYou should be able to get wireless, FBReader and VLC working on a persistent system, if you forget the update.\nIf you need the latest updates and upgrades you can do a Full install to an 8GB or larger flash as Bodi.Zazen suggests.\nIf you absolutely need to update a persistent flash drive, you can use casper-rw and home-rw ext2 partitions that are not limited to the 4GB size FAT32 files are.\n", "Q: How to retain the wireless settings using ndiswrapper I have an older laptop and Ubuntu does not have drivers for my wireless PCMCIA card.  So I found the Windows drivers and loaded them with ndiswrapper via the Windows Wireless Drivers utility app. I can load the drivers and the card then works fine... no problems at all. The problem is to keep these settings once the machine is shut down or rebooted.  At present, the settings are lost if this is done and I have to reinstall the wireless driver every time. I have tried various suggestions on how to keep the settings but so far none of them have worked.\nThere has to be a configuration file somewhere that contains the wireless setup info but I do not know what or where it is.\n\nA: I have run into similar problems in the past trying to get a Linksys WUSB54G to work with ubuntu.

You can get there by pressing AltF2, entering /host and then CtrlD to bookmark.\nFrom Windows you can use something like http://ext2read.blogspot.com/ to access the root.disk (readonly).\nI recommend storing data on /host if you want to access it from Windows.

Additionally, I'd like to make their entire account non-writable, with the exception that they may write if the app allows them to create a document.  Of course if the app they are allowed to run needs to write logs for example, this will need to be enabled too.  The intended result is they wouldn't be able to right click on the desktop and create a directory or document.  They might be able to download an executable, but not execute it.\nHow can I do this?\n\nA: AppArmor or SELinux should answer. \nAppArmor seems more common at this point, but you'll need to dig a bit to find information on configuring it for users (most tutorials only mention program profiles, not user profiles). The AppArmor documentation has details, particularly the language quickstart and the profile language reference.\nThe level of restriction you desire will require a lot of testing and tuning to get right. There are a lot of required permissions that aren't immediately obvious. For example, Mozilla will want to log browser history somewhere, and many programs put files in the /tmp hierachy.

Ubuntu is aware of Windows 7, while Windows 7 will try to make Ubuntu disappear.\nWhile your windows partition needs to be very large, Ubuntu will not need too much space.\nI recommend you set your partitions manually when installing ubuntu like this:\nprimary 1: Windows partition you cannot get rid of\nprimary 2: ?Gb Windows partition.\nextended 1: 8GB Ubuntu '/' (system)\nextended 2: 256MB-1GB 'swap'\nextended 3: remaining ntfs for your documents, music and video.<br>\n\nThis way you can share data between both operating systems, with minimal issues.\nI use this setting with 1 windows and 2 linux distros.\nWith 'Minimal issues' I mean you may be asked wether to execute a file or view it even if it is not a program on linux, or finding a lot of thumbs.db files, System Volume Information or .Trash folders. Or problems with symbolic links.\nOh yeah, and don't forget to backup all your data first!\n\nA: I have a Ubuntu and Windows 7 dual boot that works fine, with a partition \"/home\" that can be used to share files. From my experience a 10-20GB partition for Ubuntu and swap 1-1/12 times the size of physical ram works the best. \nLifehacker did a great guide to doing this exactly, following is the link. http://lifehacker.com/5403100/dual+boot-windows-7-and-ubuntu-in-perfect-harmony\n\nA: The following Ubuntu Community documentation link will give you instructions on how to remove your WUBI install from inside Windows 7 \nYou should then have a good read through the Ubuntu community documentation on setting up a dual boot system\n", "Q: GNOME-Boxes vs VirtualBox Which would be \"faster\" more \"responsive\" virtual machine software? GNOME-Boxes or VirtualBox?\n\nA: GNOME Boxes is a graphical user interface similar to virt-manager aimed to access virtual machines based on Qemu or for viewing remote desktops:\n\nThat said, Boxes will be sharing a lot of code-base with virt-manager project, mainly in the form of libvirt, libosinfo (not yet used by virt-manager) and qemu.GNOME\n\nTherefore it is not expected that there will be any performance improvements in comparison with existing virtualization software listed here. It may however be easier to access you virtual machines from GNOME. There is also a question on this topic here.\nFrom my experience Virtual Box is so easy to handle that it does not really need any user interface other than the one provided. It also has the advantage of a being a cross- platform application.\n\nA: Although speed is a relevant question, I think what would be more important is how it handles processor threads and memory allocation. \nI'm newish to Xenserver and definitely no experience with Gnome-Boxes (yet), but I've been using VirtualBox and VMWare for a few years now.  VMWare V-Sphere (I believe this was only available with an Enterprise license) has the nice bonus of being able to throttle up/down processors and cores and dynamic ram allocation - meaning if another VM requires more power or memory, it has the ability of doing so without going below certain thresholds that may impact performance overall.  \nVirtualBox - does not have this feature from my experience. Granted you can set a \"Maximum\" throttle for the CPU use, and the amount of virtual cores to use, but I don't believe I've seen settings to dynamically allocate memory (Perhaps the memory allocation is a maximum and it throttles it down/up in the background if needed?) \nI'm sure XenServer and the Xen Project have these features built in, but I'd be curious to know how Gnome-Boxes handles it, or if it handles these situations better than VirtualBox. I think I'm going to throw a system together to test this unless someone has this information already :-)\n\nA: The question is whether Gnome Boxes or VirtualBox will be \"faster\" or \"more responsive\"...AFAIK there is too little information available about Gnome Boxes at the moment to draw a conclusion. Keep up with the news and see how Gnome Boxes will shape up.\n", "Q: Firefox default download directory on Xubuntu I am not much familiar with Linux and cannot find the default\ndirectory where the Firefox stores downloaded files.

I have gcc 4.6.2 installed (installed from tar source) in my ubuntu server 10.10 64 bit, I have also installed gcc 4.4.5. I want to uninstall gcc 4.6.2 and make my old gcc 4.4.5 default. How can I do this?\n\nA: Don't need to uninstall 4.6.2. If you have installed it from the repositories and also have gcc 4.5 installed, you can do:\nsudo update-alternatives --config gcc\n\nwhich will allow you to choose what is your default compiler.  Uninstalling gcc 4.6.2 could impact other packages.\n\nA: First, don't change the default compiler used by your OS super-user. The packaging guys have carefully tested that everything works with 4.6, and if you change that you risk destabilizing your system, and that could end badly.\nWhat you can do is adjust the default compiler for yourself only by simply altering the PATH variable in your shell setup.\nSo, simply add this:\nPATH=/path/to/your/gcc/bin:$PATH\n\nto your ~/.profile or ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc or whatever is most appropriate to you. (Or just add it to all of them to be on the safe side.\n\nA: In GCC 5.1.0, the best method so far is to install it somewhere else with DESTDIR and then use that to decide which files were generated, as mentioned at: https://stackoverflow.com/a/25304014/895245\nAlthough there is no top-level uninstall target, some directories do have it, in particular gcc, so you can do:\ncd build/gcc\nsudo make uninstall\n\nThis does not remove everything that was installed, but it removes major executables like gcc, g++, cpp... contained in that directory, so it might be enough.\nAnother dirty workaround:\nsudo find /usr/local/bin -maxdepth 1 -mtime -1 -delete\n\n", "Q: SSH Streaming Audio So I have been using mplayer to stream my music through SSH from my laptop to my Ubuntu box using:\nssh user@ip-address \"cat /Some/Random/Directory/*mp3\" | mplayer -\n\nI was just wondering if there is a better way of doing this because currently I cannot skip through songs and such.\nDoes anyone know of a better way or a better program to stream music other than mplayer? Or perhaps some suggestion about the mplayer configuration?\n\nA: Install Subsonic, perhaps? You can stream music from it, play music on the hosting computer (if you want), and it can play your music on iPhone and Android devices, too (using special apps, of course).\n", "Q: Are existing updates available after end of support? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to install software or upgrade from old unsupported release? \n\nI am using Ubuntu 11.04 at the moment. I like GNOME 2 and its classic desktop environment. I would prefer to stay with it for as long as I can, even after it reaches EOL (end of life).\nHowever, I am not fully satisfied with Natty and am considering downgrading to 10.10, which expires in April this year.\nSuppose I install Ubuntu 10.10 after April, will the existing updates be available, or will Canonical kill off the repositories for 10.10 completely? Will the Software Centre still be functional then?\n\nA: From memory, the repositories for end-of-life releases are moved within weeks of the EOL date.\nTo clarify - they are moved, not removed.  EOL release repositories are available at http://old-releases.ubuntu.com\nEnd-of-support means that Canonical will no longer actively push out updates and security patches.  You will be responsible to do this yourself - probably through downloading sources yourself, compiling and installing.\nAs time goes by, though, you will find that the usual source of newer software - PPAs, will tend to dry up as the maintainers move onto newer versions of ubuntu.\nMoving the repositories doesn't mean that you will be unable to install software - you will just need to repoint your sources to the old-releases area:\nEdit /etc/apt/sources.list and change 'archive.ubuntu.com' to 'old-releases.ubuntu.com'\nYou can do this with sed\nsudo sed -i -e 's/archive.ubuntu.com/old-releases.ubuntu.com/g' /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nthen update with\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nThus - synaptic/software-center etc will still work correctly.\n", "Q: Is there a plugin for eclipse that packages .deb files for an existing project? I was wondering if there is a plugin for Eclipse that allows the user to build a version of the project/application that is packaged in a .deb?\nIf possible to be able to modify the configurations before building it.\n\nA: There is no plugin that does this.  This is because Eclipse has never been made for that purpose, and therefore does not include all the particulars of Ubuntu Packaging.  Any plugin that might do this would be sketchy at best, and would probably screw up the package in a manner that violates Debian packaging.\n(Ubuntu is based off of Debian, and uses Debian .deb package formats :P)\n", "Q: Ubuntu hostname on lan config My host computer is Windows 7 64.  I have VirtualBox with an Ubuntu 10.04 Server x64 running as guest.  My Ubuntu Guest has an ip of 192.168.1.104.  I have openssh installed on the guest.  I can ssh into ubuntu from Windows. On my host Windows OS, I can type 192.168.1.104 into the browser, and get your standard It works! apache message. My ubuntu guest hostname is \"ubuntuserver01\"  When I type in \"ubuntuserver01\" into the browser address bar on my windows host os, it wont connect to the server on the guest.  Is this just a problem with my /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts files (and what do I need to change?) or am I missing something else?\n\nA: This is because when you type \"ubuntuserver01\" you are asking the DNS to look for a TLD with that name, try appending \".local\" (only works if you router actually does this sort of mapping).\nIn other words, if you want that to work you need to add a mapping on your router. Or, this isn't recommended for a simple tasks, change your DNS settings on Windows to point to another server that knows this mapping. The \"other\" DNS would be one you own.\nThe mapping would be something similar to this:\n\n\"ubuntuserver01\" -> \"192.168.1.104\"\n\nPlease also note that when and if you do create your own DNS server, you still need to make sure the all the TLD's and other common mappings are in your new configurations along with this new one. Failing to do so will block your Windows machine to be able to resolve any website and will basically be blocked off from the internet.\n", "Q: Unsupported SysV option when invoking ps I've installed Ubuntu 11.10 today.

It's a well-known convention (aids maintainability), avoids splitting user data across multiple, un-related hierarchy (aids maintainability and helps automate backup routines), and requires less manual intervention (i.e. less mistakes--say you type 'o' instead of 'g' in your chmod command and don't notice).\nIf you've changed the file structure as part of a transition away from single-user sites, you might want to investigate vhosts.\n", "Q: Why is my laptop not using the new Firefox menu layout?

Recently I installed Ubuntu 11.10 using wubi at my laptop Toshiba C660-1C8 (with built-in Intel HD Graphics). When I previously used Windows, I had many drivers from Toshiba including Display Driver installed. Graphics was very good. But there is no drivers for linux from Toshiba.\nNow at Ubuntu my graphics is very granular, blurred, with low contrast. Are there drivers that can help me? How can I make my graphics better?\nResolution is set to native 1366x768 at both Windows and Ubuntu\n\nA: I suspect that Toshiba (and other OEMs) don't write any drivers for their laptops, but rather re-distribute whatever Intel, Rbroadcom, Realtek, Nvidia, and others provide them with.\nIntel has its GPU driver built into the Linux kernel, so that you don't have to search, install and troubleshoot anything. Unfortunately, the Linux driver compares poorly to its Windows counterpart. It under performs, causes xserver crashes, lacks power management features, etc. To get a better driver, you have to wait for Intel to release one, hopefully sooner rather then later, though honestly, I wouldn't hold my breath just yet.\n", "Q: How to install JDK5 in Ubuntu 11.04 I have installed 11.04 in my machine.

I am using ecryptfs for my home directory. I now want to switch to an SSD but my home dir is currently 350gb in size and I don't have the money to buy an ssd that size. What I got is a 128gb ssd that I want to install the root system on, as well as the \"base\" of my home directory (incl. source code, configuration files, i.e. the files used most often). All the subdirectories that contain lots of data but are rarely accessed (music, pictures, documents) I want to keep on a plain hdd and just link the directories in. However esp. for pictures and documents I really do want to keep encryption. \nIs there an official / efficient / easy / secure way to soft-link directories from another location into my home directory and also being encrypted? Ideally ecryptfs would handle this automatically, however auto-mounting of these directories (preferably at least semi-automatically but definitely securely) would be an acceptable compromise.\n\nA: You can accomplish this using mount.ecryptfs_private's alias feature.  From the manpage:\n   mount.ecryptfs_private  is a mount helper utility for non-root users to\n   cryptographically mount a private directory, ~/Private by default.\n\n   This program  optionally  takes  one  argument,  ALIAS.   If  ALIAS  is\n   omitted, the program will default to using \"Private\" using:\n    - $HOME/.Private as the SOURCE\n    - $HOME/Private as the DESTINATION\n    - $HOME/.ecryptfs/Private.sig for the key signatures.\n\n   If ALIAS is specified, then the program will look for an fstab(5) style\n   configuration in:\n    - $HOME/.ecryptfs/ALIAS.conf and for key signature(s) in:\n    - $HOME/.ecryptfs/ALIAS.sig\n\n", "Q: Why is HUD not installing on 12.04? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat is the Unity HUD and how can I install it on my system? \n\nI have recently installed ubuntu 12.04 Precise Pangolin from usb.\nI really want to test the new HUD thingy but it is not installing, i`ve added the ppa, update and upgrade and nothing :( when i press Alt key it just shows me the menu on the top panel.\n\nA: You need to tap the alt-key for it to become visible. Pressing and holding alt the way you've done in the past will have the same consequences as it has in the past. That's the goal. It isn't intended to replace, but to supplement. \n", "Q: Rhythmbox interface All versions of Rhythmbox I've used looked something like this\n\nNotice at the top, there are two wide toolbars, one with buttons, the other with the song title and progress slider.\nApparently, it's possible to unify the two to make Rhythmbox look something like this:\n\nAnyone knows how?\nPS: I use Ubuntu 10.04 and Rhythmbox 0.12.8 bundled with it.\n\nA: The Rhythmbox version that was first hosted on sourceforge (v0.8.5) first existed with a GUI as per your second screenshot.\nSince the software was moved under the Gnome umbrella, the GUI has been changed as per your first screenshot.  Unfortunately, you cannot reskin rhythmbox to have the old GUI.\nThere is a rhythmbox fork:\n\nThe second screenshot looks very much like the proposed \"Rhythm-e\" elementary version of Rhythmbox - this is/was a fork of Rhythmbox proposed for Elementary OS.\nThe current status of Rhythm-e looks rather quiet looking at launchpad\nThe screenshot is from a webupd8 article\nThere are some nice screenshots of this on deviantart - Rhythm-e is deprecated and is no longer being developed, Beatbox which is the new Music Player from the elementary team was favored over Rhythm-e.  However this is not available in Lucid.\n", "Q: How Can I Use Ubuntu As Firewall Server Can Ubuntu be configured as a firewall server , if yes how ? , if no why ?\n\nA: The built-in Ubuntu Firewall called Iptable.  By default iptable allows all traffic. So, you need to configure based on your needs :)\nHere Is Basic Commands on Iptable \nTyping\nsudo iptables -L\n\nlists your current rules in iptables. If you have just set up your server, you will have no rules, and you should see\nChain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination         \n\nChain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination         \n\nChain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination\n\nPlease see the whole how to on help.ubuntu.com\nA simple iptables script\n#!/bin/bash\n# flush all chains\niptables -F\n# set the default policy for each of the pre-defined chains\niptables -P INPUT ACCEPT\niptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT\niptables -P FORWARD DROP\n# allow establishment of connections initialised by my outgoing packets\niptables -A INPUT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\n# drop everything else\niptables -A INPUT -i eth+ -p udp -j DROP\niptables -A INPUT -i eth+ -p tcp -m tcp --syn -j DROP\n# accept anything on localhost\niptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT\n\nI have network interfaces on eth0 and eth1, so this script has rules which cover both; if your interfaces have different names, you will need to edit the rules to cover that. This drops everything incoming, except for connections which were initially established by my outgoing packets (thanks Luke! - see comments); which means it's no good for servers.\nI put this script in /opt/scripts/iptables.script and made it executable. Once you run it, you can find out whether it has worked by displaying your current iptables rules with:\nsudo iptables -L -v\n\nI then created a simple init script to start/stop the firewall in /etc/init.d/firewall:\n#!/bin/bash\nif [[ $1 == start ]] ; then\n  sudo /opt/scripts/iptables.script\nelse\n  sudo iptables -F\nfi\n\nThen I symlinked this into my /etc/rc.* directories using the update-rc.d tool, so the firewall starts before the network comes up:\nupdate-rc.d firewall start 20 2 3 4 5 . stop 99 0 1 6 .\n\nSource \nHope this help :)\n\nA: I prefer ufw HELP it is a wrapper around iptables, and more easy to configure.\n", "Q: Ubuntu changes drive order with multiple HDDs My motherboard is GIGABYTE GA-890GPA-UD3H, and I have 4 internal HDDs. The first one (sda) contains various Ubuntu versions. Others HDDs contain Windows XP, Windows 7, and data. However the drive order changes when there is a kernel/software update (all the 4 HDDs are connected). After a reboot,  sda has become sdc. All the HDDs are repositioned.  Can someone please explain how and why this happens. Is there a way to stop this from changing?\n\nA: The drive are named (sda, b, ...) in the order they are ready for the system I think and it changes, mainly if you have usb ones. Anyways, if you mount them using UUID instead of sda, sdb, you will have no more problems as UUID are fixed.\n", "Q: Using OpenVPN for a single window How do I use OpenVPN for only one window/process?\nExample Case Scenario:\nI want to use a US only website on Firefox, but use my ip on the chromium process\n\nA: The only way you could do that would be to have a proxy server on the same network (or host) as the OpenVPN server and to configure Firefox to use that proxy. You'll have to ensure that the OpenVPN server only pushes routes to it's own network and doesn't make the VPN the default route.\nThis is because OpenVPN (and indeed any true VPN) works at a networking level, not a process level.\n\n\nPlease give me steps or a tutorial on how to do that \n\nThere is an official how-to on installing Squid and for OpenVPN. For anything detailed you need to provide details of the networking setup of your VPN server so we know what your options are.\nAt a high level, configure:\n\n\n*\n\n*OpenVPN to use routing, not bridging\n\n*Squid to accept any client on the subnet you're using for OpenVPN\n\n*Firefox to use the IP of the OpenVPN server's VPN subnet\n\n", "Q: How do I enter a file or directory with special characters in its name? I want to enter the following folder in the terminal:\nMilano, Torino (Jan)-Compressed\n\nHow should I write the command cd to enter this directory?\nSpaces and several other special characters like \\, *, ), ( and ? cause problems when I try to use them in the command line or scripts, e.g.:\n$ cd space dir\nbash: cd: space: No such file or directory\n\n$ cat space file\ncat: space: No such file or directory\ncat: file: No such file or directory\n\n$ cat (\nbash: syntax error near unexpected token `newline'\n\n$ echo content >\\\n> ^C\n\n$ ls ?\n(  )  *  ?  \\\n\nHow do I enter file or directory names that contain special characters in the terminal in general?\n\nA: To open a folder containing a space surround it in quotes like cd \"Some Directory\" or escape the space with a backslash, like: cd /home/kudic/Radna\\ površina.\n\nA: That command is ambiguous because spaces are normally used to separate arguments. cd does not know what you want to do but you have two possibilities to solve it:\nEither you \"mask\" the spaces (and all other special characters) so that the terminal knows you mean the space as a character and not as a separator:\ncd Milano\\,\\ Torino\\ \\(Jan\\)-Compressed\n\nOr you put your folder name or path into quotes:\ncd \"Milano, Torino (Jan)-Compressed\"\n\n\nA: If this directory is in your home folder then type:\ncd \"Milano, Torino (Jan)-Compressed\"\n\nelse give absolute path:\ncd \"/…/…/Milano, Torino (Jan)-Compressed\"\n\nif there is a double quote in file name then escape that with \\\"\n\nA: Another option although not the best in this case is to use wildcards.  You can try:\ncd *Torino*\nIt is best to use this method when there is a distinct word or phrase in the name of a directory not shared by others.  For example I have mount points /media/DataSSD and /media/DataHDD.  Autocompletion doesn't work until I type nearly half of the name so to get to my HDD partition I just type \ncd /media/*HD*\n\nA: A little tip: tab completion ;-)\n\n\n*\n\n*Just type the first letter e.g cd Mi (or more letters if needed) and press Tab. Terminal will help you by completing the rest words.  \n\n\nAnother way: drag and drop\n\n\n*If you can see the directory and if you want to access it using terminal, just type: cd first and then drag and drop the directory on the terminal and hit enter.  \n\n\nA: Write it as:\ncd 'Milano, Torino (Jan)-Compressed'\n\nOtherwise it treats Milano, as the folder name. This happens because of the spaces in the name of the folder. Alternatively escape a few of the special characters:\ncd Milano\\,\\ Torino\\ \\(Jan\\)-Compressed/\n\n\nA: tl;dr: To quote a special character either escape it with a backslash \\ or enclose it in double \" \" or single quotes ' '. Tab ↹ Completion takes care of proper quoting.\n\nWhat you're asking for is called Quoting:\n\nQuoting  is used to remove the special meaning of certain characters or words to the shell. (…)  There  are  three  quoting  mechanisms:  the  escape character, single quotes, and double quotes. \n  [citations taken from man bash]\n\nQuoting with the escape character \\\n\nA non-quoted backslash (\\) is the escape character. It preserves the literal value of the next character that follows, with the exception of <newline>.\n\nSo to enter a directory or a file with a special character, escape the latter with \\, e.g.:\ncd space\\ dir      # change into directory called “space dir”\ncat space\\ file    # print the content of file “space file”\necho content > \\\\  # print “content” into file “\\”\ncat \\(             # print the content of file “(”\nls -l \\?           # list file “?”\n\nbash's Programmable Completion (aka Tab ↹ Completion) automatically escapes special characters with the escape character \\.\nQuoting with double quotes \" \"\n\nEnclosing characters in double quotes preserves the literal value of all characters within the quotes, with the exception of $, `, \\, and, when history expansion is enabled, !.\n\nSo to enter a directory or a file with a special character, escape at least the latter or a greater part of your filename or path with double quotes, e.g.:\ncd space\" \"dir     # change into directory called “space dir”\ncd spac\"e di\"r     # equally\ncd \"space dir\"     # equally\ncat \"space file\"   # print the content of file “space file”\ncat \"(\"            # print the content of file “(”\nls -l \"?\"          # list file “?”\n\nAs $, ` and ! keep their special meaning inside double quotes, Parameter Expansion, Command Substitution, Arithmetic Expansion and History Expansion are performed on double-quoted strings.\nQuoting with single quotes ' '\n\nEnclosing characters in single quotes preserves the  literal value of each character within the quotes. A single quote may not occur between single quotes, even when preceded by a backslash.\n\nSo to enter a directory or a file with a special character, escape at least the latter or a greater part of your filename or path with double quotes, e.g.:\ncd space' 'dir     # change into directory called “space dir”\ncd spac'e di'r     # equal\ncd 'space dir'     # equal\ncat 'space file'   # print the content of file “space file”\ncat '('            # print the content of file “(”\nls -l '?'          # list file “?”\necho content > '\\' # print “content” into file “\\”\n\n\nYou can find more about Quoting in man bash/QUOTING, on wiki.bash-hackers.org and on tldp.org.\n\nA: C-like strings and $'string'\nAmong other things, one can use $'...' type of quoting to make use of ANSI-C backslash characters such as \\n and \\t, including those you've mentioned.  From bash 4.3 manual:\n\nWords of the form $'string' are treated specially.  The word expands\n  to string, with backslash-escaped characters replaced  as  specified\n  by the ANSI C standard. \n\nThis is particularly useful with files which contain newlines, tabs, when you're writing complex awk lines where you need to make use of different ways to distinguish between single and double quotes, when filenames themselves contain single/double quote mishmash,etc.\nFor example, creating and listing such files:\n$ touch a$'*'b  c$'\\n'd                                                     \n$ ls  a$'*'b  c$'\\n'd                                                       \na*b  c?d\n\nYou can make use of character hex values, such as:\n$ touch 'file(name'\n$ ls file$'\\x28'name\nfile(name\n\nprintf\nSame idea as before - take advantage of escape characters:\n$ ls \"$(printf \"file\\x28name\")\"                                             \nfile(name\n$ echo \"Hello World\"  >  c$'\\n'd                                            \n$ cat \"$(printf \"c\\nd\")\"                                                    \nHello World\n\nUse inodes:\nEvery file or directory has special data structure associated with it called inode, which are referenced by a particular decimal number. So you can use that to indirectly locate the file with particular inode via find command, and do something with it:\n$ echo \"This is a test\" > file$'('name1\n$ ls -i\n5898996 file(name1  5898997 file?name2\n$ find -type f -inum \"5898996\" -exec cat {} \\;\nThis is a test\n\nAvoid dealing with individual files when you can use glob\nWhen you don't have to deal with individual files, just take advantage of * glob character in shell and quote variables when passing them to other commands. It makes dealing with difficult filenames much easier:\n$ for f in ./*; do echo \"$f\" ; done\nfile    name2\nfile(name1\n\nNote the use of ./ - a safeguard against filenames which may contain leading - in them.\n", "Q: How disable purple screen at boot time when it shows?
