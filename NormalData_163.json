["Q: Problem installing GIMP on 12.04 Get following error while trying to install GIMP 2.8 on Ubuntu 12.04:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n gimp : Depends: libgimp2.0 (<= 2.6.12-z) but 2.8.6-0precise1~ppa is to be installed\n        Depends: gimp-data (<= 2.6.12-z) but 2.8.6-0precise1~ppa is to be installed\n\nHow do I update those dependencies?\n\nA: To install Gimp 2.8.10 on Ubuntu 12.04, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:otto-kesselgulasch/gimp\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gimp\n\n\nSource:Thorsten Stettin\n", "Q: Custom WebApp not appearing in Unity Launcher I created a custom webapp in order to have it in the Unity launcher. The thing is that I followed some instructions found on the web and I can actually search for it in the dash. I click on it and it opens Firefox and it goes to the proper destination. So, that's good.\nNow, what I want is for the webapp to appear in the launcher when it is launched from the dash so that I can right-click on it and select \"Lock to launcher\", but that does not happen.\nI know this question has been asked already (https://askubuntu.com/questions/232291/custom-unity-web-app-not-appearing-in-the-launcher) but it did not get a single reply. \nDoes anybody know how to make the webapp visible in the launcher?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: OK, so I found the way.\nI just had to drag and drop the icon from the Dash to the Unity Launcher. Now it is locked there.\n", "Q: CD Creator/Burner has frozen I was burning something on to a blank CD. Now at the top it says \"100% Done\", but well I don't know? It shows the downloading status at like 1/4, but it's been like this for hours. Under that it says \"Creating Image Checksum\".\nAny ideas what's up?\n\nA: Try quitting from (or killing) the CD Creator software, then ejecting and reinserting the burnt CD and see if the data is on it or not.\nI am having problems with k3b (a different burning program) at the moment where it tells me the burn has failed, but when I check the logs I see it failed after the process was 100% complete, and when I check what is on the CD it is all there.\n", "Q: pg_ctl: command not found, what package has this command?

I want it to be in the middle_middle of my screen.\nSolution:       alignment middle_middle # Display in middle of screen, horizontally and vertically centered\n\nThat should fix your issues.  Have fun Conkying!\n\nA: You can try Conky Color wich is really easy to set up.\nhttp://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/CONKY-colors?content=92328\n\nA: Instead of setting own_window_type to dock, set it to override.

I have read a lot of forum posts but I can't decide which is the better one for my PC.\n\nA: The only reason I can think of that you would use the 32 bit version of Ubuntu in a PC with a multi-core, 64-bit processor is if you had less than 4 GB of RAM. Even then, you will still see better CPU performance with the 64 bit version, just less efficient RAM usage.\nSince you have a machine that is specifically designed to run a 64-bit operating system, you should go with that. Nowadays, most applications run on 64 bit machines. Unless you have a specific application you want to compile and run for 32 bit Linux, you should go for the 64 bit version.\n", "Q: Use of 802.1x security option in network? I was passing through network settings and noticed this option 802.1x security for this connection? Available to tick. I did never pay any attention to this option untill now, I just want to know what does this option exactly stands for? Security against what/for what? I got wired connection and wonder do I really need to activate it and if so then why? Just in short help would be appreciated, because I was googling and I didn't find exact answer to my question.\n\nA: IEEE 802.1x is a port-based Network Access Control mechanism for connecting to A network based on smart card or domain certificate.\nTypical usage are seen in large organizational network where each machine is given an unique certificate. While logging into/ connecting the network, the authenticator verifies the certificate and let the machine connect to the network.\nIt is useful when you are in large LAN and you need to secure the environment. The scope of the protocol is limited to LAN/WLAN.\nMore info : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.1X\n", "Q: Can I set Grub to not boot a default OS? I'd like the computer to wait at the Grub screen for me to make a choice, rather than picking one option and running with it. Is there a way to have no default operating system in Grub?\n\nA: Yes you can.\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Alt + ctrl + t \n\n*Type command, sudo gedit /etc/default/grub \n\n*change the GRUB_TIMEOUT value to -1.

If not it's okay I'll stick to it this way.  Don't want to damage anything. \n\nA: I'm confident you can just tell Grub about the Windows installation and use it to select the OS to load on startup. I haven't mucked about with this in a while, but this page should get you on the right track: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2\n\nA: Ubuntu's bootloader (Grub) can offer to boot to Windows. That's the default, anyway. When you boot to your 160GB drive the should be a menu appear. If there isn't hold the left Shift key and that should force it to come up.\nIf Windows isn't an option on that screen, make sure you shut Windows down properly (quite important), boot into Ubuntu and run sudo update-grub. That should tell you all the options it's adding to the boot menu as it runs.\nIf you don't see Windows, run sudo os-prober and see if that detects it and then update your question accordingly.\nBut if that works, after that you can leave BIOS pointing at your 160GB drive and use Grub to switch. You can edit Grub options to make it more usable too, like changing the default, changing the timeouts, etc. \n", "Q: Video won't play correctly I'm new to linux and I've installed ubuntu 12.04 on a dual boot PC.

Sometimes BIOS recognises it as a hard disk drive, so, in this case what you have to do is set BIOS to boot from hard disk drive as first option (priority) and, in the hard disk drive list you have to place your pendrive at top of the HDD list.

I tried ifdown, but this command tells me that wlan0 is not configured, and I tried nmcli c up/down, but this command does not seem to 'reread' the changed configuration?\nSo how to make this work?\n\nA: You must use:\nnmcli nm wifi on/off\n\nno nmcli c up/down. \n\nA: The commands ifdown/ifup just manage interfaces in /etc/network/interfaces. These are explicitly not managed by the NetworkManager.\nSo static interfaces (which could be static or dynamically assigned IPv4 and IPv6 addresses) I usually manage there instead of by the NetworkManager. Most often it's servers, as I don't use use graphical interfaces on servers.\nNM is in my opinion most usefully on laptops and not on stationary computers, but your mileage might be different.\n", "Q: Change the output from a background taks to notify-send Recently, I've started to use Karma as my JavaScript testing service.

If you wanted everything in a single notification it would be as simple as:\nnotify-send \"Summary\" \"$(command)\"\n\nReplacing command with echo \"hello\" or your karma command, or whatever.\nYou could also do one line per notification, if each test result were on a line, such as:\ncommand | while read line; do notify-send \"Summary\" \"$line\"; done\n\nPossibly with a sleep 1 in there to avoid flooding the notifications, although without some app to collect the notifications, that may be a bit difficult to follow.

The solution to bring the wallpaper back to functioning order is thus:\nsudo apt-get remove cinnamon*\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nAnd afterwards log out and log back in.\nWeird thing is: this actually removed Nemo and now I don't have a graphical file manager.\n\nA: I have the same problem as you with the black desktop.

A lot of our members staff have trouble finding which counties various cities and towns are in. \nOur work involves writing and sending letters, of which the county is a mandatory field. I want to create a table in LibreOffice Calc that has all the respective counties for each city and town. \nUsing the data in this table, I want to be able to create a page where you can simply type the city, press enter and it displays the county that it's In. Maybe even postcode too? \nI don't want to use Ctrl +F. Is there a way to do it?\n\nA: Well, look. First of all: If you wish to forcefully use \"Excel\" (as mentioned in your original question and the comments) you will be in the need to use it via WINE, which may decrease the speed on how do you do this task and certain functions (like the vertical and/or horizontal lookup functions) may not work as expected. \nI suggest you to give a chance to LibreOffice Calc, which handles both Excel (.xls and .xlsx) and LibreOffice (.ods) file formats. This way you can share your document with MS (Windows) based system users and work with the data without a major issue in any direction.\nNow, let's cook fast food.\nLet's say we have a spreadsheet with the details of your customers, as shown in the next small table called \"Clients\" (see the name at the bottom of the spreadsheet).\n\nNow, let's rename \"Sheet2\" and use the \"Search Form\" name for it. After which we'll setup certain cells in order to contain the desired data as follows:\n\nNow, having in mind that we have a \"vertical list\" where the data is having a column name and rows containing the details of each record, we'll use the LibreOffice's VLOOKUP function in order to search for the desired data and bring the results on the corresponding cells, as follows. \n\n\n*\n\n*In the C7 Cell of the \"Search Form\" spreadsheet, (which will correspond to the \"State\" Data), we put: the next formula:\n=VLOOKUP(C5,Clients.A2:G7,2)\n\n*By Default we'll see a #N/A error message in the cell but it is caused by the NULL data in the \"City\" cell (C5), we'll solve this issue by writing something in the C5 Cell, something like \"San Antonio\" and the form will deliver the right State in the proper cell as shown in the next screenshot.\n\nNow, in a different recipe, we'll use the same data but this time we'll sort the columns based on a different order as shown in the next screenshot:\n\nI will explain later the need to change the order on the columns. For now let's focus on the creation of the new search form formulas in order to bring the data in the right place.\nNow, to look for the \"Name\" field, we write the next in the C14 and C16 cells respectively:\nC14: =VLOOKUP(C12,Clients.A2:E7,4)\nC16: =VLOOKUP(C12,Clients.A2:E7,5)\nThis will give the next results when looking for \"Portha, Joseph\":\n\nPlease note that -nevertheless- the data in the first form (the search state based on city form), are wrong this time. \nThis is because the VLOOKUP function is using the first column data in order to retrieve the proper results. If we translate the formulas we say that:\nIn the first example:\n=VLOOKUP(C5,Clients.A2:G7,2) means:\nMatch the data contained on C5 in the vertical array of Clients from A2 to G7 and show me the data in the column number 2.\nIn the second example:\n=VLOOKUP(C12,Clients.A2:E7,4) means:\nMatch the data contained on C12 in the vertical array of Clients from A2 to E7 and show me the data in the column number 4\nNow, this can be useful for practicing some VLOOKUP exercises in order to learn how to create a customized search form.\nIf you wish to download the .ods file that I used for this exercises just click right here.\nNow, if you need to run simple search solutions you may wish to use the \"Filter\" options in the \"Data\" Menu of LibreOffice. To do this simply go to the spreadsheet where the data resides, make sure it includes headers (titles for the columns) and hit the \"Data\" Menu, then \"Filter\" next \"AutoFilter\". Your column names will get a small button with an arrow pointing to downside. If we hit any of these small icons we'll see useful filtering data in order to separate the data in a reduced group which will contain only the desired data as seen in the next screenshots:\nAuto Filter buttons\n\nAuto Filter options for the State Column selecting only the Texas State\n\nResults of choosing only the Texas State in the drop down filter options. Please note that the small icon for \"State\" is now blue, indicating filtering on this criteria\n\nIf you wish to do some additional search, you can run a \"Standard Filter\" from the options on any of the drop down auto filter buttons and you will see something like this:\n\nIn this dialog window you can use as many filter criteria as you need in order to keep only the desired data, remember that filter criteria values shows a drop down menu with a selection of the values in the table.\nI hope this help you to solve your issue.\nFinal words: If you insist on using Microsoft Excel remember that the VLOOKUP/HLOOKUP and Standerd Filter, the same as other functions works the same both in LibreOffice and Microsoft Office and there is no problem when converting, unless you experience some kind of issue with translations, lets say: In Spanish we use BUSCARV/BUSCARH and other spanish words to create the formulas.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Camdesk doesn't work I'm trying to use camdesk following this OMG article, but camdesk isn't working and not sending any error messages.\nI open it in terminal using:\n./camdesk.py\n\nA white square appears in the middle of my screen and nothing happens.\nThen I launched it using:\npython camdesk.py\n\nAnd the same thing happened.\n\nA last attempt, I tried:\npython3 camdesk.py\n\nIt returned:\nFile \"camdesk.py\", line 12\n  if event.keyval == gtk.keysms.Escape :\n                                       ^\nTabError: inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation\n\n\nHere is a picture of what it looks like, a gray featureless box that has a slight dropshadow:\n\nI recorded a video to show the problem.\nyoutube video\n\nA: I faced the same problem and I get two solutions: \n1.- After running ./camdesk.py precione F1 and start working. \n2.- If you want to execute the command, and you need to work immediately add the following line at the end of init method: self.player.set_state (gst.STATE_PLAYING) \nstay follows. \ndef __ init__ (self): \n. \n. \n. \nbus.connect (\"sync-message :: element\", self.on_sync_message) \nself.player.set_state (gst.STATE_PLAYING)\n\n\nA: It's probably working fine.

Bazaar will start the configured text editor where you can enter it, no need to \"ask for it\".\nI also omitted lp:~path/to/code intentionally. After you do a bzr push lp:~path/to/code once manually, Bazaar will remember that location and next time it's enough to do simply bzr push.\nLet me know if you need anything else.\n\nA: Shell scripts are pretty easy to start with. The first line must be #!/bin/sh (a shebang — just copy-paste). Then put one command per line.\nIf you want the script to stop if a command fails, add the line set -e as the second line.\nIf you're debugging a script and want to display the commands it's executing just before they're executed, add set -x as the second line.\n#!/bin/sh\nset -e\ncd /directory/to/code\nbzr commit\nbzr push lp:~path/to/code\n\nThe best way to “ask for commit comment” is to open an editor for you to enter it. That's what bzr commit does.\nSave this file in the directory ~/bin (create it if it doesn't exist) and give it execution permissions (chmod +x ~/bin/push-my-code on the command line).\nIf you invoke this script from a command line, then typically you'd already be in the right directory, so you wouldn't need the cd command first. Rather than a script, in that case, you might add a function to your .bashrc:\ncommit-and-push () {\n  bzr commit &&\n  bzr push lp:~path/to/code\n}\n\nThen typing commit-and-push will run the two commands bzr commit and bzr push. The && sign at the end of the first command means that the next command isn't executed if the first command fails (so if you notice you made a mistake while typing the changelog entry and cancel the commit then nothing will be pushed). If you always push to the same place, leave off the argument to the push command — just bzr commit then bzr push is enough.\n", "Q: can I get rid of virus, by re-imaging the 32 bits desktop with Ubuntu?

Do I re-format the desktop internal hard drive before or after installing Ubuntu ? and How ? don't want vista anymore.\nThanks in advance. (I'm a complete Ubuntu novice and complete idiot about pc desktop)\nGeoff\n\nA: If you no longer need any of the data on the desktop's hard drive (i.e. the files from when you used Vista), then you can install Ubuntu on the desktop from a Live CD. When it gives you the options for formatting and partitioning, choose the option that will use the whole drive, with default partition options. This will install Ubuntu on the desktop's hard drive and you won't have to worry about any viruses that were on that hard drive before, since it is a fresh install.\nThen you can use Ubuntu to access files on the external drive.

However, on my one ubuntu installation, for some reason when I run sudo su and type history, I just get this:\n$ sudo su\n# history\n1  history \n\nBut I know for certain that a lot of commands were run as sudo user, but when I ssh out and ssh back into my ubuntu server, they do not display, like how they do on the other servers. Do I have some switch or something disabled on this one server? How can I regain access to view the history of commands run as sudo user? \n\nA: history is what's known as a builtin. It's essentially a bash function that operates within your session (like the rest of the logging that feeds ~/.bash_history too).\nWhen you run sudo something, that's happening within your session, not root's. Additionally, when something is run with sudo, it' doesn't spawn a separate bash session and then run the command. It's just executed with the correct privileges (I'm simplifying the truth somewhat).\nThis mildly undercuts Lekensteyn's different shell point. It's true, it just doesn't matter. Neither root bash or dash is the shell running the command. You can prove this by running something like sudo -u $USER whoami and then looking at ~/.bash_history. There is only one command. If this were another shell, I would expect to see sudo -u $USER whoami followed by whoami.\nAlso sudo su -c 'echo $0' outputs the parent shell (bash in my case) though I'm not sure if this is as significant.\n\nAnyway, when you run sudo something it just goes into your own ~/.bash_history. If you want to see the command that you've run with sudo, run:\ngrep -E '^sudo' ~/.bash_history\n\n\nA: Some possibilities why you do not keep shell history:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your root shell is not /bin/bash but /bin/sh (symlinked to /bin/dash). Change this with the chsh command.\n\n*The filesystem where /root resides is mounted read-only, so the history file cannot be written.\n\n*The variable HISTFILE is set to a value other than /root/.bash_history. An empty file disables history, other values are used as location to write the history to.\n\n", "Q: Lenovo Ideapad battery limit I have an Ideapad Y400 running Ubuntu 13.10.

I can not seem to find one. Does it have one or does it not? When I looked on the website and on searches it said nothing about this.\n\nA: Ubuntu, and Linux in general, are virus-resistant by design in at least two ways:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Fragments of Windows executable code (viruses) don't natively run on Linux. The system call method differs.\n\n*Linux/Unix does protections/permissions differently from Windows, so the execution of an evil script by a user can only harm the user executing it, not the system. Viruses want to harm the system.\nYou can get Anti-virus programs for Linux, but they are used for checking E-mail for Windows viruses (e.g. on mail servers).\n\nA: Ubuntu does not come with an Antivirus installed by default, but there are antiviruses available for Ubuntu. Clamtk a Graphical front end to ClamAv, Avast, Click here for more information on this.\n\nA: Ubuntu doesn't come with antivirus, it depends on user permissions, and security updates to keep itself from becoming infected. Additionally most antivirus tools available for linux DON'T scan for linux viruses, they only scan for Windows based viruses. The approach of updates and permissions makes it difficult for a virus to infect a system, and very difficult to determine if a linux system has files on it that contain viral code. It's one of Ubuntu's biggest drawbacks in my eyes, because many people end up unconciously helping to spread viral code to other systems. It should however be noted that there aren't very many viruses for linux (as far as we know).\nComodo Antivirus For Linux is one of the best free antivirus products I've found for Ubuntu, it comes in 64bit and 32bit, but only scans for Windows viruses. It also doesn't work on all versions of Ubuntu due to driver problems.\nClamAV is a simple manual scan only antivirus for 32bit and 64bit, again it only detects\nwindows viruses.\nPersonally I would suggest running a Windows manual scan antivirus product in wine since you will have a better selection, and either way you only detect windows viruses.\n\nA: It doesn't generally need an antivirus because it's not Windows or Mac. Viruses of Mac and windows don't affect Linux. The viruses that they do make for linux are little to non-existent. If they are seen, they're are  likely to be patched in the kernel updates in a short amount of time.

My laptop's current hard drive has only Ubuntu 13.10 installed on it.  My goal is to remove it, put it in a SATA to USB enclosure, and run it from there.  I'll be putting a drive with Windows 8 back in the computer.  Before I go mucking about inside it I'd like to know - is this a feasible idea?\n\nEDIT\nTrailRider was on the money.  It works just fine and SecureBoot is not an issue; however, even with no drive put back inside and no  other drives plugged in Ubuntu recognizes its drive as sdb1.  \nWith an SSD connected through USB 3.0, it seems to be running as fast as it did while inside.  I haven't tried any heavy lifting yet, though.\n\nEDIT\nInterestingly, after I put the Windows drive back in the the computer and booted to Windows once, it would no longer boot again from the Ubuntu drive.  Once I put the Ubuntu drive back in the computer it booted just fine again.  I'll have to investigate more.\n\nA: This should work fine, the only snag would be if the Secure Boot stopped you, but as it is not preventing you from booting it now I don't think it will as an external drive.  \nYou may get a strange result when running update-grub in that it may find the Windows disk and then include it in the boot menu but I don't see that as being an issue other than it may not chain load Windows correctly if you try to select it in the menu(it should boot if both HDs were in the computer, not sure if Ubuntu is outside, It think it still would but...). It would not affect Windows loading form it's own disk just if you tried to select it in grub.\nOne thing you would need to be careful of is to make sure that any new grub install would not install into the Windows drive.  This is were is might get tricky, Ubuntu should see it's HD as sda and Windows as sdb  You would just want to make sure of that before allowing any grub to install from the updates.\nYou can check that from the terminal:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nthe -l tell fdisk to only list the partitions so don't forget it. (that is a lower case letter L not the number 1 BTW)\nIf one disk has a GUID(gpt) partition table it will tell you that fdisk cannot understand GUID partitions, use GNU Parted you can do that by typing:\nsudo parted -l\n\nYou could also just use parted first instead of fdisk.\n(Ubuntu will show up as an EXT4 filesystem while Windows will be NTFS, they will not likely be labeled Ubuntu and Windows, unless you have label them yourself)\nIf you see that Ubuntu sees itself on sda then any new grub installs will be fine, if you ever find yourself needing to use boot-repair to get Ubuntu booting then make sure that it only installs grub on the Ubuntu disk(in this case when booting from the LiveUSB/DVD the external drive should show as sdb and the internal will be sda) just make sure that you have the box unticked that installs grub on all disks.\nNote that booting from the LiveUSB also includes when doing an upgrade/new install, you may need to click \"Something Else\" in the Window on how you are going to install Ubuntu and instruct it to install on sdb.  If it gives you the option to \"Replace Ubuntu 13.10 with 14.04 or upgrade to 14.04)  then it should be okay but I would still click the something else to make sure that the box at the bottom is showing that grub will be installed on the proper drive, you can then click the back button and let the install take care of it. If not you will have to use the something else window to force the grub install to the correct disk and will have to select the mount points by hand.\n\nOne last thing, you may have lower performance from a USB drive as the data transfer will be slower, but it will mostly affect you by programs loading slower, after they are loaded, I doubt you will notice any difference, unless you are doing something that is causing a lot of read/writes on the disk. The programs themselves, should be mostly loaded in the memory.\n", "Q: If I install Ubuntu linux on an external hard drive can I save the data on that same hard drive? I am planning on installing Ubuntu on an external hard drive.  My question is where does data get saved when I use this OS?  For instance, if I create a folder on the desktop of Ubuntu where is that information being saved?  Ideally, I want all data related to my Ubuntu OS stored on the external drive… Is this possible?\n\nA: It will be saved on whatever partition you install it on. As long as you can boot from the hard disk, it will save there.\n", "Q: Ubuntu and windows not working. My computer says \"error,  no such device found grub rescue>.\"  how do I fix it?  I have an HP Pavillion desktop pc.  It was running Windows 7 yesterday when I selected to install some \"important\"  updates. After the said updates were installed,  I restated the computer as prompted.  \nAfter a while the computer just went off and said  \"Bootmgr missing\"  and I ran Ubuntu from an old live cd I had.  I installed Ubuntu into a 8 gb flash drive,  and downloaded a windows 7 iso since I misplaced my cd.  \nAfter downloading the iso I created a bootable usb with the iso to replace the cd I lost. I tried booting from my usb to load windows installation but it doesn't work. Now when I load up the pc it says that error message I put in the top. \nAs for technical experience,  I'm mostly a windows,  but I can use terminal in Ubuntu too,  as long as you directly spell out what I have to put in.\n\nA: Option 1 :Before you restart to complete the update, unmount any pendrive or portable hard disk drive.\nOption 2 :Use grub customizer to customize the entry.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer \n\nOption 3 :Recover your boot using Boot-Repair\nOption 4 : Fix your windows via a windows disk.7 Bootloader until you can access windows.\nI hope this will help you. :)\n", "Q: Skype and Google+ on Ubuntu 13.10 I am thinking about installing Ubuntu 13.10 in my computer, but I am afraid because I must use vídeo chat with Skype...

Normally I can control it with mocp via SSH and use the mocp volume control. Without X, there is no sound output.

I had routinely used a VGA cable to plug in my external ASUS monitor.  when entering the \"disply\" app, ubuntu would recognize it as \"ancor communications\", and give appropriate resolution options.  I set it on its side, set the display to clockwise, and used it as a vertical monitor for months without problems.\nall of a sudden, for no reason I can tell, it stops working.  When I plug it in, it is no longer recognized as an \"ancor communications\" monitor, and it only gives me really coarse resolution options, which are useless.\nI fished out a HDMI cable and plugged that in.  Lo and behold it recognizes the brand of the monitor, and looks sharp and nice.  But after about 5 minutes of being plugged in the computer starts to get reaaaaallllly slooooooow.  I unplug and everything seems fine, but I have no external monitor.\nWhy did this break and how do I either make my external monitor recognizable through VGA (as it was before) or not crash in HDMI (which would be nice)??\nThanks for any help.  I have no idea why this doesn't just work as it did before.\nEdit1:  Added the bounty yesterday because I really want to fix this and I have no idea how to do it.

those which worked for you):\n#!/bin/bash\nxrandr --newmode \"1280x1024_60.00\"  109.00  1280 1368 1496 1712  1024 1027 1034 1063 -hsync +vsync\nxrandr --addmode VGA1 1280x1024_60.00\nxrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1280x1024_60.00\n\nSave it in /etc/vga_setup.sh (You will need root privileges to save it here, but if you want you can save it anywhere you want.) Then make it executable: sudo chmod a+x /etc/vga_setup.sh Test the file if it works: in a terminal simply /etc/vga_setup.sh If it works, no errors reported, then:\nOpen /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf in your favourite text editor (you will need root privileges so use sudo or gksu), and add these lines to the end of the file:\ndisplay-setup-script = /etc/vga_setup.sh\nsession-setup-script = /etc/vga_setup.sh \n\nSave the file. Reboot. Should work. (If after reboot your GUI doesn't come up don't afraid, just switch to virtual console (CTRL+ALT+F1), login, and remove the added lines from the /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf file and reboot, then come back here.)\n", "Q: I am running Knoppix on my desktop. How do I switch to Ubuntu? Probably a really simple solution, but I can't figure out how to install Ubuntu onto a system running Knoppix.

Is there an easy way?\n\nA: Just do a fresh install of Ubuntu on the same machine.\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/install-desktop-long-term-support\n(You may want to back up /home first, if you have files there you want to keep.)\n", "Q: Recovering photos from a formatted drive on Ubuntu I installed Ubuntu on an old computer I had, which ran Vista. I choose to do a clean install of Ubuntu over the entire HDD. Later on I found out that there were old precious photos on that HDD.

PhotoRec ignores the file system and goes after the underlying data, so it will still work even if your media's file system has been severely damaged or reformatted.\n", "Q: How to Install AMD graphics in ubuntu 13.10 in HP probook 440G1 with haswell integrated I have HP Probook 440G1 with Integrated AMD graphics (mars) (discrete) and Intel core i7 Haswell as integrated.

IP forwarding is turned on. Additionally, the server acts as a secondary DNS for websites I host. I am looking to install ownCloud on the server, and that's where my question arises.\nWhen I attempt an SSH connection to the server from behind the server, using its public IP address, the connection times out. I assume this is because it appears that my computer is using the same IP address, and that creates an issue at some point along the way.\nI'm worried that installing ownCloud on the server will produce the same issue. In other words, if I create a DNS record for cloud.mydomain.com, that points to the server's public IP address, then I worry that if I try and access cloud.mydomain.com from behind the server (and thus, because of IP forwarding, appear to have the same IP address as the server), I simply won't get a proper response.\nIf this is the case, how do I fix this?\nThank you so much!\nSigned, \nSpencer\nUPDATE: Let me provide more information about the setup, as it may be relevant. The server has Shorewall installed. All necessary ports are open. IP_FORWARDING in shorewall.conf is set to On. The server itself sits behind a NAT. So it amounts to a NAT within a NAT. I know this isn't the best setup, but it's what I'm stuck working with. The DSL modem that generates the first NAT is configured to forward all open ports (in this case, 22, 53, and 80) to the server. The server provides DNS for the outside world, and for my local network. Today (12/5) I set up Apache on the server, opened port 80 on both the server and the modem, and the problem persisted: I can access the default Apache page from outside my network, but not from behind the server. Any help you can provide would be much appreciated!\n\nA: So, I ended up abandoning this setup, but as I've learned more about the interplay between routers, DNS, etc., I believe the issue I was experiencing was a NAT/IP forwarding issue. When, from behind the double NAT, I typed in the domain I would have liked to use (e.g., cloud.domain.com), the query would return the public IP of the network (e.g., 1.2.3.4, at the top of the double NAT), which because of IP forwarding would cause issues.\n", "Q: AMD Catalyst Control Center not saving multi monitor settings So I am using gksu amdcccle to make changes but for some reason whenever I select the 'Multi-display desktop with display(s)' option to extend my desktop the changes never save on restart or re-log.

Next, I went to the setting for Static NAT in the Firewall section. Here there is a table with fields for \"Networked Computer/Device\" and for \"Public IP Address\". I set the RPi's name to correspond to the static IP address I had already set.\nIn order to make sure the NAT would happen, I checked that all my computers' network settings had 192.168.1.1 as the first DNS server. (It may already be set that way by default.) I am using mostly OSX--the DNS setting can be found in Network in System Preferences--click the \"Advanced\" button and select the \"DNS\" tab.\nMy router is for Verizon FiOS (Westell A90-9100EM15).\n", "Q: hibernate is diabled on ubuntu 13.04?

Please follow instructions here: How to enable hibernation?\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu 13.10 I installed ubuntu OS in my lap but after installation, it showing dual OS (window, previous one & the ubuntu). But I don't want the dual OS. So can you please guide me to install the recommended ubuntu OS in my lap.\nPlease provide me the step by step instructions, so that i can able to understand and implement it.\n\nA: You will find the instructions here:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/install-desktop-latest\nIn step 4 you can decide, if you want to install Ubuntu alongside Windows (dual OS), or replace Windows by Ubuntu. Choose the latter. Sometimes reading helps :-)\nBut if you already had difficulties with that, I assume you have no experience with Ubuntu at all, do you? Then I would strongly recommend to keep Windows alongside Ubuntu at least for the first months until you got more comfortable with Ubuntu. In case something isn't working in Ubuntu, you can still boot into Windows and get it done. I've been using Ubuntu for almost 7 years now, and still run Windows alongside it, just in case I need to use some software only availiable for Windows. Sometimes there is just no alternative in Ubuntu. That's a pity, because I really love Ubuntu (and dislike Windows)!\nDon't forget to backup the data you might have saved in Windows folders (like \"My documents\" etc.) before you replace it by Ubuntu.\n", "Q: How would I make this bash script that displays certain system processes related features? Basically I need to make a bash script that acts as a handy tool for diagnosing performance issues. The script needs to first determine each unique process owner on the system, and then for each user that has current processes on the system it needs to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Determine the number of processes owned by that user\n\n*Determine the sum of memory for all processes owned by that user (SZ)\n\n*Determine the sum of the current CPU usage for all processes owned by that user (C)\n\n*Determine the cumulative time (TIME) and process name (CMD) of the process with the highest cumulative time owned by that user (Hog: process)\n\n\nI guess the first step would be to determine all of the unique process owners on the system, and then loop through each?\n\nA: If you want to have a quick look at processes, use top and read the man page to learn how to sort by various columns\nTo find (most of) the information you want: \nps ax -o user,sz,pcpu | \nawk '\n    NR>1 {n[$1]++; sz[$1]+=$2; cpu[$1]+=$3}\n    END {\n        for (user in n) \n            printf \"%-8s  %4d  %12d  %.1f\\n\", user, n[user], sz[user], cpu[user]\n    }\n'\n\n", "Q: HP 2000-2d04TU Notebook (Ubuntu 12.04) wireless internet disabled I have a HP 2000-2d04TU Notebook pc.In my system I have loaded ubuntu 12.04 but  wifi is disabled in my system.\n\nA: *\n\n*Run the below command to check if your wifi is hardblocked or softblocked,\nsudo rfkill list\n\n\n*If your wifi is softblocked then try to unblock it by running the below command,\nsudo rfkill unblock wlan\n\n\n*If it is hardblocked,then try to find the hardware switch to enable wifi.\n", "Q: Use of Diffrent terminals I have searched a lot about it but could not get an answer. I read somewhere that linux Ubuntu has 6 or 7 terminals. \nWe can start them by pressing -\nCtrl+Alt+(F1-F6)\n\nand to get back to GUI-\nCtrl+Alt+F7\n\nSo what i want to know is what is the difference between these 6 different terminals , and how can we use them as per to different purposes??\n\nA: In fact there are not only 6 or 7 ttys, there are many more. You could see them, try\nls /dev/tty* | wc -l\n\nAll the consoles are not always active. You need to activate ttyN in order to switch to it with Ctrl+Alt+F N. You can activate any tty with openvt command also. See man openvt. \nReason why there so many ttys, may have historical baskground. In old days Linux was used in terminals (without X server). \n\n\n*\n\n*To do multiple tasks at the same time it was indispensable to have more than one ttys.\n\n*due to any accidentally break, it was required to have another tty from where system could be monitored.\n\n*Even to read more than one man pages, different ttys were needed. \nNowadays for most users don't need that many — in fact most users never see anything but first 6 ttys to be available for CUI login and the virtual console that X is running on. As Rinzwind mentioned all these terminals are mostly identical.\nBut there are a few people who patch their kernel to allow more than 63 consoles(special ttys), because they run large machines with many hardware consoles.\n\nA: There is no difference between the 6 terminals -by default-. It is up to the user to think of use cases.\nOn a server setup I have seen these used to automate a login after booting up to start software. It is also possible to have the desktop to show more than 1 desktop manager: Unity on tty7, KDE on tty6 and XFCE on tty5 (but installation wise it might be a bit more difficult than it used to be).\n\nA: Virtual Terminals are provided as a convenience. They come in very handy when troubleshooting problems with the GUI.\nOn servers that do not have a GUI they are indispensable.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_console\n", "Q: Can't install Ubuntu 13.10 due to insufficient available disk space When trying to install Ubuntu, on the preparing to install page, the first bubble is left unchecked. The one where it says, \"has at least 5.9 GB available drive space\". Everything else is checked, \"is plugged into a power source\" \"is connected to the internet\". I can't figure out how to successfully delete any space on the disk. \nThat's because there isn't anything on this machine. I had windows 8 but got rid of it for Ubuntu. I tried Ubuntu but then it kept freezing so i tried re-installing it again, and it went crazy again. And now, after my third try, it shows this.\nOn GParted, under partition, it shows unallocated with a size of 883.03mib. I've tried other methods of deletion here but they all fail by using the terminal.\n\nA: The 5.9 GB are about drive space not allocated to any partition.\nIf you have nothing on the drive to keep, delete all partitions (/dev/sda1, /dev/sda2, and all the others). In gparted you might have to first unmount them.\nThe other option is wiping everything out using fdisk:\nsudo fdisk /dev/sda\no\nw\nq\nsudo reboot\n\n", "Q: I have just accidentally uninstalled synaptic manager.

I have a virtualbox running ubuntu 13.10 (running on a 13.10 host) that has two shared folders on the host that are mounted at boot. A while ago the guest ran some updates that broke the folder sharing, the guest could no longer see the devices to mount them. I had a hunch from reading around that it might be something to do with the guest additions, as getting the 4.3 release of virtualbox from the oracle repo and updating the guest additions solved the problem. The issue is, today's linux headers update broke the mount again, and there doesn't appear to be an updated guest additions to go to! (re-installing them doesn't work).\nObviously at a basic level, not installing the updates would prevent this problem. However I'd be interested in finding out exactly why it's behaving like this.\nI'm a bit out of my depth here but if someone could point me in the right direction of a solution I'd appreciate it.\nIf there's more useful info I can provide let me know.\nFull error message I'm now getting when trying to use the manager to mount the Guest Additions CD Image:\nUnable to access \"VBOXADDITIONS_4.3.4_91027\"\nError mounting /dev/sr0 at /media/ptinkler/VBOXADDITIONS_4.3.4_91027: Command-line 'mount -t \"iso9660\" -o \"uheper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid,uid=100,gid=1000,iocharset=utf8,mode=0400,dmode=0500\" \"/dev/sr0\" \"/media/maplecroft/VBOXADDITIONS_4.3.4_91027\" exited with non-zero exit stats 32: mount: unknown filesystem type 'iso9660'\n\nA: Virtual Box shared folders functionality depends on guest additions kernel modules. A kernel update should automatically reload all modules using dkms (which should be installed by default).\nUnfortunately this does not always work as expected. Then we have to reinstall the guest additions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install Guest Additions in a VirtualBox VM?\nGuest additions will then be available after a reboot of the guest.\nIf this fails it is worth to try again as sometimes the installation does not work as expected (without errors or warnings).\nIt may also worth to try to remove the guest additions before we install them again using the uninstall script (replace x.x.xxx with your version of Virtual Box):\ncd /opt/<VirtualBoxAddtions-x.x.xx>/\nsudo ./uninstall.sh\n\n\nA: This worked!\nMy internet was working from guest OS. So I could download the additions ISO and extract. Also was able to install it easily\nI also had taken two steps before this (not sure if they helped, but they shouldnt hurt since the steps downloaded all headers and prepped kernel for guest adds)\nSteps:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential module-assistant\nsudo m-a prepare\n\n\nA: Open Ubuntu in VirtualBox.\nOpen FireFox and go here.\nFind your version of Virtualbox and click the link to open it.\nDownload your version of VBoxGuestAdditions (iso):\nOpen it in Archive manager and extract files\nrun:\nsudo VBoxLinuxAdditions.run\n\nReboot.\n", "Q: squid3 stop/waiting, is this a bug?

Given a \"ganged power switching\" capable active USB2.0 hub, and - amongst other USB devices - an external HDD is attached to it.\nMost probably the electronics or the firmware of the external HDD has some issues, and every time it has its random glitch the system doesn't recognize the HDD anymore. I mean, lsusb doesn't list it anymore, however at least the disk is still spinning.\nMy question is that is there any software based way to make the HDD re-recognized, while the other devices in the HUB remain untouched?\nSome way that simulates as if I plugged the HDD right now into a particular port, replaying the needed handshake usually done when I plug in an USB harware (I assume there must be some protocol, but unfortunately I don't speak USB).\nIt implies that the following approaches are dead ends within the above context:\n * changing the USB hub to a per port power switching (HW based solution)\n * changing the HDD to a reliable one (HW based solution)\n * plug out and back into the HUB the HDD (HW based solution)\n * using usbreset or similar (will have impact on the other plugged in devices too, since I have a ganged power switching capable HUB)\n * playing with the USB related kernel modules (will have impact on the other plugged in devices too)\nWorst case I can buy another HUB to put that between the original hub and the unreliable device(s) of course. But until that it is still an interesting question whether the above operation is possible at all.\nThank you in advance!\ncheers\n\nA: I can't think of a way that doesn't somehow involve restarting your USB stack, which would of course affect all your USB devices, not just the HDD.\n", "Q: Ubuntu-Windows 7 dual boot, windows broken And I'm considering reinstalling windows 7, should I remove ubuntu beforehand?\nhttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-system/black-screen-before-login-after-installing/ca7e7876-1b1d-4cd1-aceb-d69a8eafdd10\n\nA: *\n\n*you dont need to remove ubuntu.You can just delete the windows partition on ubuntu and reinstall windows on the same partition.\n\n*To delete a windows partition,you need to install gparted partition editor on ubuntu.Run the below commands on terminal to install gparted,\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\n\n*Open gparted ,locate the windows7 partition and format it to ntfs filesystem.\n\n*Then bootup the windows-live-disk.During windows installation select the custom option and then select the ntfs partition you formatted it on gparted and install windows to it.\n\nA: Last time i was in the same situation , So if you delete windows partition it will affect grub for sure, actually in my case that happened .

Then create the file /etc/apt/preferences with this content:\nPackage: *\nPin: release a=saucy-proposed\nPin-Priority: 400\nTo do so you may open a terminal and type sudo gedit /etc/apt/preferences.

Is it at all possible to have the same ubuntu with the same updates and installed apps, sometimes boot in a vmware/vbox/or-similar inside windows, and sometimes be able to boot it on the startup of the computer ?\nWithout having to migrate from one place to another each time.\n\nA: [Please note that I have never booted an OS off a phyiscal drive using a vm but it can be done.]\nYou can assign a vm to use a hard drive partition directly rather than a .vdi, .vhd, or .vdmk file. You can do this under the VM settings in Vmware player by adding a generic scsi device and choosing the partition you want. Please note that the vm only has access to that partition which presents a few problems: \n\n\n*\n\n*On BIOS computers the bootloader is stored on the hard drives mbr and therefore will not be available to the vm making the OS unbootable. You will need to create a virtual hard drive that has a bootloader setup to boot an os from the scsi device. On UEFI systems a similar problem will occur.\n\n*The swap parition won't be available, I'm not familiar enough with swap to suggest a work-around for this. Missing swap won't prevent booting, but you should get an error message at least the first time, and it will affect performance of the VM if you don't have a swap partition.\n\nA: intresting idea!

Is there any way that I can increase my ubuntu partition space so that i dont need to install ubuntu all over again.\nthanks in advance.\ni have this link\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/114503/how-to-resize-your-ubuntu-partitions/\nshould i try this or there is some other way.\n\nA: As far as I know you cannot increase the partition while Ubuntu is running. However you do not need to re-install Ubuntu either. Simply get a live USB or Ubuntu install disk and select the \"Try Ubuntu without installing\" option. You can then use Gparted to resize your partitions. If you do not have a spare USB or install CD then I don't think there is a lot you can do...\n\nA: The post which you provided is allright, and it actually mentions that you need to boot from live CD/USB to resize your root partition (otherwise you can't unmount it). This link is probably even more instructive as it talks about re-allocating space between partitions which is your case: http://gparted.org/display-doc.php?name=moving-space-between-partitions.\nThe possibility of data loss in process is very small but if you have any life-or-death data on any of the partitions, you'd better back it up.\nWhat is quite possible though is that your boot will get broken as you are moving the start of your root partition where the grub files are, so boot.img may not find them. You will then end up in GRUB rescue mode which isn't a very big issue though, it's utterly fixable.\n", "Q: I can not boot ubuntu 12.04 I have installed windows xp after installed ubuntu 12.04.

I live in Sri Lanka. And I dont have a good internet connection. So I already have ubuntu 10.10 which I got from shipit.ubuntu.com some time back. And distributed some copies of it to my friends so they have started to use linux like me. But the problem is I can't download the latest version of ubuntu LTS edition because of the weak internet connection I have. And also it's not available in shops in Sri Lanka(They also have the old version ordered from shipit) So is there anyway I can get a Ubuntu LTS CD shipped to my place so I can distribute copies of it to my friends. I really want one to give to people I know. So is there anyway I can get a Ubuntu disk shipped to my address?\n\nA: Your 10.10 CD is a coaster now. Don't try to install from it. I mean it. Frame it or throw it into the sea and don't look back. Cool people don't look back.\nFirstly, try a torrent. Even on a weak internet connection you can usually get something downloaded and verified. This is because a torrent is chunked up into tiny bits and each bit needs to be verified before it's happy.\nThen, if you're still desperate, get ready to pay for a CD. There are dozens of companies selling CD and USB versions of Linux. These are all under open licenses so you can copy them in most cases. Which one for you? Who knows. Google buy linux cd and see what looks good.\nIf you've got more patience, talk to your Sri Lankan Team Loco. They're there to help Sri Lankan Ubuntu users out. I'd be shocked if somebody there couldn't send you a CD for the price of the media and postage (or less).\nFailing that, you're in the position where you need to beg people. Or train pigeons to steal other people's CDs and fly them back to you... But I think the other options are fundamentally better.\n", "Q: What is the purpose of Compiz (if any), inside Ubuntu 12.04, if I use gnome-classic (gnome-session-fallback)? This question would serve me to figure out if I can remove, or replace compiz, if I don't use Unity. I seem to be running into a lot of desktop/window bugs, such as windows unminimizing on the wrong workspace, windows not activating when unmaximized (nasty one), and now, white taskbar buttons.\nI would appreciate a comprehensive answer that makes me understand what is the place of compiz among software products like Gnome, \"Unity\", lightdm, metacity, which are, for me, stuff that overlap in functionality in a blurry way.\nI have a friend who said he removed compiz from his 12.04 installation, as if not needed. That sounds dubious to me, since I use something called ccsm (CompizConfig Settings Manager) to tweak various desktop stuff all the time.\nI also hear (read on launchpad) that \"compiz is dead\" (or will soon be). If you look at development, pretty severe bugs are progressing very slowly. I would like to know what to turn to, in the future. I should add, I very much tend to stick to gnome-classic, because the Unity thing always seemed a step backward (or sideways) to me: big buttons intended to be \"tapped\" on a tablet rather than clicked, a launcher that never did what Alt+F2 did in previous versions (2 simple things: autocomplete and suggestions). \nDidn't mean to wander, question in the title, thank you.\n\nA: Compiz do not work on gnome-shell. However you can use it using compiz --replace command.\nThis link provides more detail\nhttps://live.gnome.org/GNOME3Myths\n\nA: \nI would appreciate a comprehensive answer that makes me understand what is the place of compiz among software products like Gnome, \"Unity\", lightdm, metacity, which are, for me, stuff that overlap in functionality in a blurry way.\n\nGnome 3 use Mutter as Window Manager, hence no Compiz. Unity uses Compiz as plugin (actually Unity appears as plugin in the CCM) hence if you remove Compiz you will bring down Unity since Unity depends of Compiz (you can check it out using aptitude why unity compiz and will result in unity Depends compiz). Other windows manager doesn't use compiz or has an option to integrate compiz as desired but it's not necessary for the correct functionality, just to pimp up the display.\nCompiz is ultimately a x-window-manager and can be replaced with easy in any Desktop Environment except Unity.\n", "Q: how to store data on a \"secure\" place so that nobody can access to it I am building a \"Kiosk-Computer\"-Terminal for my client.\nAt the moment the \"Kiosk-Mode\" is accessing into Ubuntu with the guest-user, this is enough for my costumer at the moment. ( btw. if somebody know a good opensource kiosk lockdown software, please tell me. )\nBut one questions is unclear, what if somebody take the harddisk out, or, take the whole computer and then accessing with another computer to the harddisk, the answer is, the thief will have access to the data.

Or can i encrypt selected files, the maingoal is that these files which i would encrypt are config-files for sensitive software which should run on the guest user...hope you understand me..\nbest regards \n\nA: If you want to encrypt your hard drive – or any of the files on it, for that matter – you have to be prepared to enter a password at least once per boot. That's the price to pay.\nSorry if this sounds harsh, but it's just the way it is. In order to encrypt something, you have to have a password you enter every time. Without it, e.g. with the complete key lying somewhere on your hard disk, the encryption would be useless since anybody could decrypt your files.\n", "Q: Unable to create Live usb pen I know there are tons of post about this already and i have read most of them.\nbut still they don't answer my question.\nAs said above i am trying to create a bootable usb pen with ubuntu 12 on it\ni have use the linux usb creator\ngot a error that it's unable to boot the kernel\ni used LILI \ngot a error that it's unable to boot the kernel\ni renanemd some files on the stick \ngot a error that it's unable to boot the kernel\nand i know the stick ( intenso 32 gb ) is up to the job\nthere was a backtrack version on it before\nbut even with that i had loads of troubel there was one post\nthat solved my problem but i can't find that post anymore\nit was about creating a active partition on the usb pen\nso the computer would see it as a hard drive en then installing\nlinux on it like i would install it on a hd.\ni can't even find a live cd version that i download and can run\nof cd (' don't have a checksum program anymore on my windows)\ni am running windows 8\nlooking forward to your replies\nkind regards Nigel\n\nA: A few things you could try if you haven't already:\n\n\n*\n\n*you can try Unetbootin, an other program to make live usb sticks\nfor multiple linux distros\n\n*you can try to re download your immage in case your download is\ncorrputed\n\n*if you have an other USB laying arround you can check whether that one works (if only to see where the problem is at.\n", "Q: Application integration with Unity launcher I like to integrate a application (a digital shredder, a interface for shred command) to allow drag-and-drop files from Nautilus to launcher icon and then open the program and fill the file path field. This is possible? I guess I need some code. The program is written in Python.\n\nA: There is some simple  drag-and-drop support built into Unity. If an application can take a filename as a commandline argument, you simply need to use a variable in the Exec field of the desktop file.\nTake for example Gedit's desktop file (with some content removed for readability):\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=gedit\nGenericName=Text Editor\nComment=Edit text files\nExec=gedit %U\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nStartupNotify=true\nMimeType=text/plain;\nIcon=accessories-text-editor\nCategories=GNOME;GTK;Utility;TextEditor;\n\nIf you drop a file on a Gedit launcher in Unity, the %U will be replaced by the file's uri.\nThe variable is part of the Desktop Entry Specification:\n\n\n*\n\n*%u - A single URL.

Trying to follow these instructions:\nUsing ALT + Keycode for accents? \nto make typing accents easier (and consistent between OSX at work and Ubuntu at home) and I can't for the life of me figure out how to set a compose key.

I do wish that \nWhat are Unity's keyboard and mouse shortcuts? were updated for 13.10\n\nA: The general way to troubleshoot such a problem is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Look in the layout settings whether there is a layout which provides the feature you want to look. Also check there whether you can change the options for a certain layout to behave the way you would like.\n\n*Look in xev for the keycodes and keysym of the left and right ALT respectively, and reconfigure it with xkbcomp so the right ALT has the ISO_Level3_Shift keysym. Following is the relevant section from my XKB layout:\nkey <RALT> {\ntype= \"ONE_LEVEL\",\nsymbols[Group1]= [ ISO_Level3_Shift ]\n};\n\nTo get your layout use\nxkbcomp $DISPLAY keylayout.xkb \n\nand edit it in a text editor. To upload it to the Xserver use\nxkbcomp keylayout.xkb $DISPLAY\n\nIf it works you have to make it permanent by writing a script with the previous command in it and making it autorun on startup. (You can make it autorun either with the /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf file or any other way you like.)\n\n*If the right ALT has the proper keysym and some keys with the right ALT key produces the desired output, but some others don't, then only change the keysyms for that ill behaving key. More instructions for this situation here.\n\n*If none of the above works, then it is possible that you have a special, programmable keyboard, which was programed in a way that it sends the same scancode for the left and right ALT keys, so the kernel sees them the same. In this case either reset your keyboard or program it correctly. Check this Q&A for a similar problem.\nP.S. There is a good wiki about linux and keyboards here.\n", "Q: Area drawing - Huion Tablet I've tried everything here on ask ubuntu and found good solutions for tablets drawing of HUION brand.

(starting from the left top edge), and the same occurs with useful drawing area on the tablet itself.\nIn my case, my monitor is 1368x768 and it seems that the drawing area is only 346 pixels wide by 192 pixels high (values ​​only for you to understand better what happens)\nI installed the drivers WizardPen, calibrated and managed to resolve the drawing area on the monitor, but the tablet functional area remains small (the area of the drawing tablet is too small, the pen works up to a point and discards the rest of the area)\nI would like to help.\n\nA: There is a Huion Driver (kind of a beta version, but I gather it is slated to be included in the kernel, if it has not already), in the Digimend project, at \nhttps://github.com/DIGImend/huion-driver \nWorks like a charm, with my H610.\n\nA: I am running Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS, 64-bit version, and I was able to get a Huion 420 drawing tablet to work by downloading and using terminal to install the digimend drivers found here: https://github.com/DIGImend/digimend-kernel-drivers/releases/download/v6/digimend-kernel-drivers-6.tar.gz.\nI was having the same symptom of screen area of the tablet being too small.

I've got some Ubuntu 10.04 and 12.04 systems that have an inet6 (IPv6) address. However, our firewall is configured to deny all and some pass rules are added for inet (IPv4) addresses. Do I need to care about updating our kernels when a change is made to them to address IPv6 vulnerabilities?\n\nA: If your systems are not reachable using IPv6 – if the firewall drops all IPv6 connections, that is – I don't see why you should worry.\nOn a general note, keeping your system up to the latest security fixes is still a very good idea. Next month you might decide to use IPv6 and by then you probably have forgotten about this vulnerability – after all, it doesn't affect your system right now.\n\nA: What is the IPv6 addresses do do you talk about?\nThere are link local addresses that each network device get, which start with fe80::/10 (not shore about the net part, the prefix are right though.\nThose are not allowed to be transfered cross routers, so these are nothing you need/can bother about.

I have MySQL installed on my localhost. What happens if I have a problem with mysql and I want to re-install it again? Do I lose my existing databases?\n\nA: Use sudo apt-get remove mysql-server. \nDon't use sudo apt-get purge mysql-server, which will remove the files in /var/lib/mysql.\n\nA: No, reinstalling mysql-server will not delete you database files, only delete the package files of mysql-server. You will be able to access your files(database) after you re-install the server.\nTo purge and install mysql-server:\nsudo apt-get purge mysql-server\nsudo apt-get install mysql-server\n\nIf you want to delete the database too, you must delete it first before you remove mysql. To delete the database cleanly, on the mysql prompt type:\ndrop database <database_name>\n\nI found another way to delete the database files, but I am not sure whether this is a clean way to delete the database, so take it with a pinch of salt:\nFrom a question on stackoverflow:\n\nIt(The location of the database files) is installation specific, but if you've /var/lib/mysql , then:\n\n*\n\n*MyISAM tables will be stored in individual files in /var/lib/mysql/databasename/\n\n*InnoDB resides in /var/lib/mysql/ibdata (unless you've used the innodb_per_table setting, in which case it's stored much like for MyISAM tables)\n\n\nSo check the location of your databases in these two locations and delete the directory of the databases(requires superuser privileges to read and delete).\n\n*\n\n*See also: Similar question on Unix & Linux\n\nA: This is an old question, but nevertheless, here are my 5¢:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do a backup of the database first, e.g., using mysqldump.\n\n*Now, do sudo apt-get purge mysql-server mysql-server-5.7. It will ask you whether you really want to delete the database files, click on Yes\n\n*Reinstall mysql using sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-server-5.7\n\n*Start the mysql database\n\n*Recreate the database and its user using the mysql command line utility\n\n*Import the dump from your backup\n\n\nYou may ask what this whole procedure is good for: There are cases where the mysql database has had many large transactions and occupies to much space on the disk. Destroying and rebuilding the database is a way of shrinking it again.\n", "Q: Problems with permissions in apache Ubuntu 13.10 I have had some problems with setting up my localhost.\nI have been following this guide --> how-do-i-set-up-a-local-domain-name-in-apache-and-ubuntu\nBut now I'm stuck my localhost only returns a 403 error so there is some problems with my permissions but i have no idea of what it should be..\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\nRegards Peter\n\nA: Let's say your webserver runs as the user www-data and that your site's document root is /var/www/blah.\nCheck that the www-data user has permissions to enter /var/www/blah with:\n\n\n*\n\n*As root, run su - www-data then cd /var/www/blah.

I’m playing games and there is always lag,I was wonder if there is a way to remove and possibly prevent lag without downloading anything or using the terminal?\nI tried looking but there is only stuff on removing lag on Windows :(\n\nA: Lag can be caused by many different factors, and it depends on the software you are attempting to run. The key causes are usually, INTERNET CONNECTION, cpu, storage device, graphics card, and ram.\nIf you have a poor graphics card try running the game a really low resoulution with eye candy dialed down.\nIf you have a poor cpu don't run anything else at the same time as you are playing (eg don't listen to you music collection at the same time).\nIf you have a slow storage device (for example a laptop hard drive) consider setting up a ramdrive (eg tempfs) and running the game from their via a chroot.\nIf you have not much ram consider adding a larger swap partition and store it on the fastest drive you have.\nIf you have a terrible internet connection, try adjusting the game's internet settings to match what you have. Remember most internet connections have bad times of day and good times of day due to high or low usage of other users, so try playing at a different time and see if that helps.\n", "Q: I cant install sdl because it has unmet dependencies My input is: \nsudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev\n\nand the output is:\nSome packages could not be installed.

How do I connect it to Ubuntu?\n\nA: External hard drives are normally plug and play in Ubuntu. Just insert the external hard drive cable and turn the external hard drive on, and it will be mounted automatically. For that matter you can also mount an internal hard drive in a external hard drive enclosure and it will normally be mounted automatically in Ubuntu too, which is useful for accessing data or doing data recovery on an internal hard drive from a different computer.\nAll currently supported versions of Ubuntu support the NTFS and FAT filesystems out of the box.\n\nA: As danijelc and karel have mentioned, you can just plug and play with most hard drives. If the hard drive does not appear on your desktop, you can try running the following \nsudo mkdir /media/hdd\nsudo mount /dev/<your device> /media/hdd\n\nwhere <your device> is most likely /dev/sdb1 or similar.\n", "Q: Impossible to see files in Trash via Nautilus I saw some posts here teaching how to lead with it problem but any of them helped me.\nMy problem is i deleted the Trash icon from my Desktop, and after that, i noticed few days after that accessing the Trash via Nautilus in my Ubuntu 12.04 does not show any file even it have files in it, where i can see through ~/.local/share/Trash.\nSo, how i can solve the problem of seeing my files at Trasg through Nautilus and restore the desktop icon of it?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: If you have files in the Trash, you could find it in ~/.local/share/Trash/files/.

I Would like to understand all challenges in upgrading and how to solve the issues them. \n\nA: There are a couple of things to note.\nFirstly, you cannot go straight from 8.04 to 13.10. You can however jump releases if you are using LTS releases (8.04>10.04>12.04). This is going to take a bit of time, so make sure you're prepared for that. Also make sure you have backed up your important data in case anything goes wrong.\nSecondly, you will need to modify your repositories (if you haven't already) to point to the old-releases. Edit /etc/apt/sources.list and change every (xx.)archive.ubuntu.com to old-releases.ubuntu.com\nE.g. ://au.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/natty/main/source/Sources would be changed to ://old-releases.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/natty/main/source/Sources\nThen run sudo apt-get update and make sure it works without errors. If it does, run sudo apt-get upgrade and then do-release-upgrade to upgrade to the next major version. You can then continue to use do-release-upgrade until you get your system to the version you want.\nNote that do-release-upgrade requires update-manager-core to be installed, so you may need to install that before upgrading.\nOnce you have finished upgrading, you should change your repositories back to the current list if they haven't been automatically, or otherwise just remove the old-releases entries if they are still in there.\nYou can see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades for more information on upgrading releases that are past EOL (End Of Life).\nGood luck.\n\nA: I think this would be a very bad idea. We have a server that is on 10.04, and last year I wanted to update or version to keep up with what is current. I simply upgraded to 10.10. After the upgrade, I reboot the server. Gnome was wreaked, I couldn't even login via GUI screen. I had to Ctrl+Alt+F1 to login. I am not sure why our server took the upgrade so hard, but it did. Our MySQL database process wouldn't start up either.\nI would recommend making an image of your server hard drive with some software, before you try upgrading. If you are not using RAID Clonezilla is a good choice.\n", "Q: Howto create a new C++ based Ubuntu touch project in Ubuntu SDK?

If you know more, feel free to add it here\n", "Q: Create multiple sites in a single apache instance I need to have multiple local sites in apache. So I add a virtual host for each one:\n#/etc/apache2/sites-available/example.com:\n<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80>\n        ServerAdmin webmaster@example.com\n        ServerName  www.example.com\n        ServerAlias example.com\n\n        # Indexes + Directory Root.\n        DirectoryIndex index.php\n        DocumentRoot /var/www/example.com/htdocs/\n\n        # CGI Directory\n        ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /var/www/example.com/cgi-bin/\n        <Location /cgi-bin>\n                Options +ExecCGI\n        </Location>\n\n\n        # Logfiles\n        ErrorLog  /var/www/example.com/logs/error.log\n        CustomLog /var/www/example.com/logs/access.log combined\n</VirtualHost>\n\nAnd then I do sudo a2ensite example.com and sudo service apache2 restart.\nThe problem is that root-relative paths don't work. For example when I say <link href=\"/css/somefile.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> somewhere in /var/www/example.com/htdocs/index.php, apache fails to serve /var/www/example.com/htdocs/css/somefile.css to browser (browsing: localhost/example.com/htdocs)\nWhat I'm missing? \n\nA: I think the problem is that you access the site with localhost/example.com/htdocs\nYou can do the following:\nIn your vhost configuration switch ServerName and ServerAlias:\nServerName  example.com\nServerAlias www.example.com\n\nrestart apache2 with:\nsudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart\n\nNow in /etc/hosts add the 2 lines:\n127.0.0.1 example.com\n127.0.0.1 www.example.com\n\nYou sould now be able to access the site with www.example.com or example.com.\n(This works if you are working on the same machine where you have your apache installed)\nAnd your path should work as expected.\nPlease comment, if you have any problems.\n\nA: Ah! I think I understand your problem...\nThe link tag can use a full path, but the full path starts at the document root:\n<link href=\"/css/somefile.css\" .../>\n\nThe full path on disk (/var/www/example.com/htdocs/css/somefile.css) would not work indeed.\nWhat Apache does is this:\nDocumentRoot /var/www/example.com/htdocs/\n+\n<link href=\"/css/somefile.css\" .../>\n=\n/var/www/example.com/htdocs/css/somefile.css\n\nThe DocumentRoot is some kind of virtual root (/) directory as far as the website is concerned. This prevents your visitors from accessing files they should never have access to (think of a file such as: /etc/passwd)\n", "Q: How to find all files with size greater than...? Is there any GUI software that can explore a tree and find all files with size greater than some amount? Neither Nautilus nor Nemo seem to be able to do this. In my memory, I could do this with PC-Tools in DOS 3.0.\n\nA: And if you are looking to search for a particular type of file, use this:\nfind . -name *.js -size +1M -ls   \n\nSearches for all files of type .js with a size greater than 1MB\n\nA: *\n\n*In the shell tools we have find:\nfind / -size +1M\n\nFor files over 1 megabyte.\n\n*And in the GUI's we have the Disk Usage Analitizer (baobab):\nsudo apt-get install baobab\nbaobad\n\nThere is a bunch more on this question of SuperUser, but for all ends and propose baobad is enough.\n\nA: When I need make more free space on servers I use this command. It find all files bigger then 50 MB and \"du -h\" make berret list of files and \"sort -n\" after pipe make list numericcaly sorted by file size. \nfind / -type f -size +50M -exec du -h {} \\; | sort -n\n\n\nA: gnome-search-tool is what I use.

I searched google, and surprisingly nothing came up.\n\nA: That is up to you and whether you trust the developers of the third-party software. It simply letting you know that it is third-party software. It is not saying it is safe to install it, nor that it is unsafe to install it.\nI would be surprised if there were any issues with it at all, but I'm certainly not going to guarantee that.\n\nA: The third party software checkbox during the Ubuntu installation proceedure is used to add in some proprietary drivers and software, all files included in valid ubuntu installation discs are safe, just make sure you download Ubuntu from trusted sources. It's good that you asked though, that's a great way to approach any software installation.\n\nA: When you add a PPA repository you have to do it with add-ppa-repository \"ppa name\" command, example:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:pidgin-developers/ppa\n\nIf you already added it and see a message indicating a missing key number you can run:\nsudo apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com \"key\"\n\n", "Q: VirtualBox fails to start machine after installing extensions I just added extension pack and my Windows machines won't start.

I tried some of the other suggested solutions but they didn't work for me. How can I fix this?\n\nA: As it has been already stated\n\nThe version of extension-pack MUST match the VirtualBox version.\n\nBut you don't need to install the latest version of VirtualBox - you just need to install matching extension pack.  \nYou can find all older VirtualBox releases (and corresponding extension packs) at https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds - just download extension pack that strictly matches your currently installed VirtualBox. After you locate your major build number, click on \nExtension Pack  All Platforms\n\nto download the appropriate extension pack.\n\nA: THE RIGHT WAY\nYes, other answers are right: you have a extension-virtualbox mismatch. However, there is a better way, a more Ubuntu way, to solve this using the distro's own installer which is packaged as virtualbox-ext-pack and found in the multiverse.\n\n\n*\n\n*If the multiverse is not enabled, enable the multiverse.\n\n*Close out of VirtualBox.\n\n*In the terminal, run sudo apt-get install virtualbox-ext-pack\nif for any reason that's already installed and you want to have reinstalled (thus guaranteeing you fix all the problem).\nsudo apt-get --reinstall install virtualbox-ext-pack\n\n\nA: The version of extension-pack MUST match the VirtualBox version.\nYou can do this easily in Ubuntu by running:\n\nsudo apt-get --reinstall install virtualbox-ext-pack\n\n\nIf this still does not fix your issue, you can manually install the matching VirtualBox extenstion, by following the below instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the latest .deb file for Ubuntu from here:\nhttps://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads\n\n*Double click on the downloaded .deb file.

It will download the client, install it and install a lot of small extensions (selected stuff from winetricks, missing libraries, etc.) known to be needed by Steam. Maybe it works this way.\nThis also allows you to keep different programs in separate wine prefixes (think of it as separate windows installations within wine), which can prevent different programs interfering with one another.\nFurthermore it allows to choose the wine version without much effort.

I had \"WinFonts\" folder in home directory including many true type fonts (.ttf) which I would like to install to be applied for use widely across Ubuntu system and apps.\nI need help guiding me to make this step?\n\nA: Installing TTF fonts system wide it's not difficult. You just need to create a directory inside one of the system font directories (you find them listed in /etc/fonts/fonts.conf), put there your *.ttf fonts and then update system font cache with fc-cache -fv (With the options -f for Force  re-generation of cache files and -v for Verbose).\nAs suggested by @emk2203 you should put custom fonts in a subdirectory of /usr/local/share/fonts, so it's easy to tell them apart from distributor provided fonts (they are in /usr/share/fonts), and it's easier to backup or restore them if needed.\nStep by step:\n\n*\n\n*Create your custom fonts directory:\nsudo mkdir /usr/local/share/fonts/truetype\n\n\n*Copy your *.ttffonts there:\nsudo cp ~/myfonts/*.ttf /usr/local/share/fonts/truetype/\n\n\n*Update system font cache:\nsudo fc-cache -fv\nIf you want to add more fonts later, just copy them to your /usr/local/share/fonts/truetype/ directory and update system font cache as above.\n", "Q: automatic Boot up from USB So I have ubuntu 12.04 on my usb, it loads perfectly and works.\nWhen I boot up my laptop (Windows 7) a menu box appears to ask how I want to run ubuntu, the first selection is Default which I use, the next being somewhere along the lines of \"Install ubuntu\", then a load of other selections\nWhat I ask is, is there a way for Ubuntu to boot up without bringing up the box?

I had Ubuntu 12.04 on my laptop but it went unstable after some automatic updates.

I also had many pop-ups with error messages. \nI've tried many things now - installing 12.04.0, installing 12.04.3 and 13.10, but it's always the same (errors and the number of error messages vary a bit - for example with one installation the touchpad didn't work either). It doesn't matter if I do the \"Erase and reinstall\" or \"Something else\" and choose manually to format Ext4, the problems are still the same. But, when I run Ubuntu from my USB stick, then everything works! So, the clean install is not really clean? How can I get it to really delete everything and get Ubuntu to run from my hard drive as good as it runs from USB stick?\n\nA: With exception of /home a clean install is really clean. As you can see in your installation logs. Instead of countless attempts to fix issues by just reinstalling the operating system you should instead try to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make screenshots, photos or write down the error messages.\n\n*Put them into your favorite internet search engine, because you might not be the only one getting these error messages.

Last time I used VLC was may be a week or 2 ago. I first noticed the behaviour when trying to play a mp4 video I had played before without trouble in VLC. Then I got the message:\nNo suitable decoder module:\nVLC does not support the audio or video format \"h264\". Unfortunately\nthere is no way for you to fix this.\n\nThen I successfuly played it with SMPlayer, UMPlayer, gxine, Xine and GNOME MPlayer. However it was not possible to play it in the default Ubuntu Application Movie Player, Banshee Media Player, Dragon Player and VLC Media Player. On all not functioning Players except VLC I was hit by a pop-up window with title:\nInstall extra multimedia plugins?\nPython (v2.7) requires to install plugins to play media files of the\nfollowing type: H264 decoder\n\nGstreamer ffmpeg video plugin (i386)\nGstreamer plugins for mms, wavpack, quicktime, musepack (i386)\n\nIn addition none of those players is able to play any Flash Video format flv ... Without any message nor pop-up. For h264, I still can play the sound but no video.\nTrouble is I already have these packages installed in architecture amd64. I don't see why I would have to install plugins for i386 ?\nHowever the common point with all these players is (may be) they use Python. I am sure for VLC that they use Python.\nI didn't install anything Python related since those video players worked fine. Only the system updates.\nSo I don't see what else I can do and why suddenly my Python 2.7 is not working anymore for VLC and other Media Players ?\nHas anyone any insights on this quite unheard of situation ?\n\nA: I found the issue. In any Debian or Ubuntu distribution there is a libopenjpeg2 package. The version installed is (for all Ubuntu distribs) 1.3+dfsg-4.6 . The developer of this package is http://www.openjpeg.org. Their Google Code website is at http://code.google.com/p/openjpeg. This comes with other packages like libopenjpeg-dev and openjpeg-tools.\nI saw that the version shipping with the distributions was their first release dating back to May 2009. Then I decided to compile and build myself the latest 2.0.0 version (from Nov. 2012). That was working fine. I named my new package libopenjpeg2.0. That was fine. Everything was running OK. Then I decided to get rid of the oldest version 1.3 and right after I began to see some applications would not start like DeVeDe, VLC Media Player, Banshee Media Player, Movie Player and others ... Some like DeVeDe launched from the command line reported the library libopenjpeg.so.2 as missing.\nRe-installing libopenjpeg v1.3 solved the issue. I learned through this process that the OpenJPEG releases 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0 are not incremental releases of the same stuff. You basically need all of them installed in different package names.\nIn Debian Unstable I saw the version 1.5 build in package libopenjpeg5 and had some hints that the 2.0.0 version would be in package libopenjpeg6.\nPackages for the 1.5 version might be found here.\n", "Q: Problems installing Ubuntu 12.04 LTS using USB and bootable DVD - Mac Im trying to install the developer version of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Desktop Developer edition. It's the 64 bit download version as my mac's a Intel Core 2 Duo. According to the Ubuntu website, I should be able to install Ubuntu using a bootable USB or DVD. The USB first;\nLong story short, it failed. I think this has something to do with Apple nailing down its software. I could select the USB when I held Alt on the keyboard - 2 USB's appeared and none of them worked; the screen would go black and stay black.\nThe DVD approach hasn't fared much better. I bought new DVD-RW DVD's with a capacity of 4.7GB each. Again, according to the Ubuntu site, here, all I need to do is open Disk Utility and burn the ISO to the DVD. Then press C on start up and boot from there.\nI did that but here's the problem - the DVD just keeps getting ejected by the mac. \nWhat's the problem here? If I can't install Ubuntu onto this Mac using USB or DVD - what else can I do?\nThanks\n\nA: It can't be done, based on how I wanted it installed. I tried various options and none of them worked. The only alternative is to install VirtualBox and use it to run Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Flash plugin or additional plugins in Firefox I have been trying to read my online training on Yahoo, but when I click the icon for training, a message box appears saying that I should install additional plugins.\nI have tried to install the additional plugins by selecting Tools -> Add-ons in Firefox, but nothing seems to work. \nWhy can't I install the Flash plugin in Firefox? And why is Firefox unable to use Adobe Flash Player?\n\nA: You should install flash-plugin via Ubuntu Software Center via repositories. Te best way to do this is by installing package \"ubuntu-restricted-extras\" which includes many useful codecs and plugings like flash and java.\n", "Q: transmission crashing and data loss http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2109152\nThis is happening to me, in the sense that transmission is freezing, I have to force quit, and I lose all data downloaded since it was launched.  It's very annoying.\nIt's some sort of unity problem, it affects other windows--transmission is just the most annoying one it happens to.\nThis guy's thread never got answered after a year--I hope I don't have to wait that long.\nI blame compiz.  Other distros have tossed it and ubuntu needs to get on board.\n\nA: My solution to that occasional issue was to replace Transmission with Deluge, which is more featureful and seems to be more solid.\n", "Q: installing java in ubuntu this is my first time using linux ubuntu. \nI'm trying to install java, i downloaded the file from the java website, extracted the file to the desktop and the extracted file's name now is jre1.7.0_45\ni'm following this to install the java\nhttp://www.wikihow.com/Install-Java-on-Ubuntu\nbut omg i can't even get past number 2.\ni get\nReading package lists...

So far, the best alternative I can come up with is lxde and xrdp but I don't want to slow down my juju nodes like that. \n\nA: Once you deploy the instances they are normal Ubuntu Server machines, so you can admin them any way you want to edit files. \nThough keep in mind that many public providers do not open ports by default, so to get something like xrdp working you'd have to configure that afterwards. \n", "Q: get error when try fstrim Below is my /etc/cron.daily/fstrim file:\n#! /bin/sh  \n\n# By default we assume only / is on an SSD. \n# You can add more SSD mount points, separated by spaces.\n# Make sure all mount points are within the quotes.

Among the filesystems that can issue Trim requests automatically are Ext4,[25] Btrfs,[26] FAT, GFS2[27] and XFS.[28] However, this is disabled by default due to performance concerns,[29] but can be enabled by setting the \"discard\" mount option.

I cannot move or edit them, or add applets to the panels. Newbie to Linux... have scoured forums and tried all the hold ALT & right Click or hold SUPER & right click etc. \nRelease: Ubuntu 13.10 (saucy)\nGNOME: 3.8.4 (Ubuntu 2013-09-04)\nKernel: 3.11.0-14-generic (#21-Ubuntu SMP Tue Nov 12 17:07:40 UTC 2013)\nOS Type: Linux\nGCC version: 4.8 (i686-linux-gnu)\nXorg Version: 1.14.3 (15 October 2013  09:23:29AM)\n\n\nA: Gnome has moved away from the let-the-user-customize-it approach, since Unity is built from Gnome it also encompasses this new ideal.\nOption #1:\nYou can run an older version of Ubuntu such as 10.10 which was the final release of Ubuntu to utilize the old style gnome (Gnome2.32), but beware the repos have been moved so you will need to reconfigure you apt list to install software from the Ubuntu repos. This release isn't supported anymore, so it no longer receives bug fixes or security updates, and therefore is not an advised option.\nOption #2:\nYou can install a different desktop environment like KDE, or XFCE. I prefer KDE myself but XFCE has a fairly Gnome2 like appearance so it may be more to your liking. If you want to try these you can install them from apt or you can download Kubuntu or Xubuntu which are the official ubuntu projects that utilize those desktop environments rather than Unity.\nOption #3:\nYou can install a different desktop environment that is branched from the Gnome project such as MATE which is built from the Gnome2 code. I found Mate had some serious bugs, but all projects do in the beginning, it may since have improved, and has quite a fan base. There are also some others like Cinnamon to consider.\nOption #4:\nYou can give Unity a try, maybe you'll like it? I don't.\n\nA: If you are in the Gnome shell rather than Unity it should be Alt+Left click and hold to drag panels, and Alt+Super+Right click to bring up the context menu to edit. I think the need for the extra super is that Compiz swallows the Alt+Right click. This works for me in 12.04 and it works on 13.10 too.\n", "Q: Login bar disappears when I try to log in I try to login but when I press enter the login bar disappears and it doesn't login.

People are telling me to restore something but I don't know how.\n\n\nA: Try to :\n1-Restore the /etc/issue file: sudo mv /etc/issue.backup /etc/issue \n2-Restore the /etc/rc.local file: sudo mv /etc/rc.local.backup /etc/rc.local \n3-Then reboot (sudo reboot) \n", "Q: Multiple deployments, one machine, how to expose them all In juju, if you were to create multiple wordpress (or any other) deployments on the same machine, how would you set that up such that all of those sites could be simultaneously exposed while being viewable?\n\nA: At this time there is no easy way to do this. There is some container support in Juju but network addressability issues still exist. In the near future you'll be able to deploy multiple charms to a single machine using either LXC or KVM containers.\nYou could fork the WordPress charm and add WordPress Multi User support. It's on the roadmap for that charm but progress is slow.\n\nA: Unfortunately I don't know a lot about Juju specifically, but I suspect something like this may be possible:\n\n\n*\n\n*wordpress1 deployed and listening on local port 8001\n\n*wordpress2 deployed and listening on local port 8002\n\n*wordpress3 deployed and listening on local port 8003\n\n\nThese sites would then be proxied to the outside world by something like Apache using name-based virtual hosts. Assuming you have only one routable IP address, you'd then set up Apache to listen on that IP and expose a reverse proxy in such a way that clients requesting wordpress1juju.com are connected to the server running on 8001, etc.\nSomeone with Juju experience would likely know how to do this sort of thing in more detail.\n\nA: By viewable, do you mean accessible by something other than your computer? If so, it's probably the firewall. try:\nsudo ufw disable\nThen try to access from another machine.\nWhen done, run:\nsudo ufw enable\nIf turning off firewall worked, you may want to configure your firewall to let in port 80 (http)\n", "Q: Brother MFC-7820N network printing of PDF files is extremely slow I've got a Brother MFC-7820N configured as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Device URI: ipp://printy.mcnally.home\n\n*Make and model: Brother MFC-7820N BR-Script3\nThe URI works from every computer on my network (both Linux and Windows). I can connect to the printer at that address and look at its status etc. via its built-in HTTP server, so I'm pretty confident that there are no network issues.\nedit — the Ubuntu system in question is a 13.04 installation. I've had the same problems for quite some time however.\nThe problem I have is that printing PDF files takes an insanely long time from my Ubuntu machine(s).  The exact same files can be printed from Windows (both other Windows 7 machines on the network, as well as a Windows 7 VM on my Ubuntu machine) in a very small fraction of the time. By \"insanely long time\" I mean that a one page document can take from 5 to 15 minutes to print. Sometimes they simply never finish, and I have to restart the printer after a half hour or more.\nThe effect is the same — precisely the same — whether I print from Firefox's built-in PDF viewer or from evince or anything else.\nThere are a zillion references on the internet to this problem, but nobody seems to really know what's going on, and no published \"solution\" I've seen actually works (or has any effect whatsoever, really, other than those suggestions that make printing fail completely).\nDoes anybody know what it is that one needs to do in order to get an Ubuntu machine to do ... whatever it is it needs to do in order to print to these Brother networked printers?\n(Hooking the printer up to USB or whatever is absolutely not an option for a variety of reasons.)\n\nA: Here is a valuable link.\nThe key bit of advice from that page is that the default BRScript and Foomatic drivers do not work with stuff like PDF files.  That sure is my experience too. Instead, there are other drivers:\nsudo apt-get install brother-lpr-drivers-laser brother-cups-wrapper-laser\n\nThose show up (for me anyway) in the (so, so terrible) \"New Printer\" interface in xfce as the \"Brother MFC7820N for CUPS\" driver. That one works.\nedit — as of 13.10, you have to select \"MFC7820N for CUPS\" from the Brother printer list in order to find the driver.\n", "Q: Many USB Multimedia Keyboard issues in Ubuntu 13.10 This same keyboard worked fine all the time in Ubuntu 12.04 (though on a different laptop). I now have 13.10 installed on a new laptop and I'm getting a few annoying problems with my external USB keyboard, specifically the multimedia functions. \nProblem 1:\nThe \"calculator\" or \"www/internet\" buttons do nothing. If I go to the Shortcuts control panel and try to bind \"Launch Calculator\" to a new accelerator, pressing the Calculator button does not register at all. It's just not detecting that I pressed it. \nProblem 2:\nThe volume up and volume down keys work a little bit -- however once I tap them once or twice, it infinitely keeps pressing the key forever, forcing the volume either to maximum or silent. I have to unplug the USB cable and plug it back in to stop it. \nI imagine this has something to do with evdev but I have no idea how to fix it.  I have tried troubleshooting using the steps at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Hotkeys/Troubleshooting but when I run sudo evtest I get nothing when I press the multimedia keys (regular keys give feedback). \nNote: my laptop has a built-in keyboard with volume controls, and they work normally as expected. \nOutput of lsusb:\n\nBus 002 Device 002: ID 8087:8000 Intel Corp. \nBus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\nBus 001 Device 002: ID 8087:8008 Intel Corp. \nBus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\nBus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub\nBus 003 Device 005: ID 8087:07da Intel Corp. \nBus 003 Device 008: ID 1e54:2030 TypeMatrix 2030 USB Keyboard\nBus 003 Device 006: ID 059f:0828 LaCie, Ltd \nBus 003 Device 004: ID 1a40:0201 Terminus Technology Inc.

The volume up/down problem persists.\n\nA: Sounds like an USB problem to me. Here is what you might try : build you own kernel with a modified hid.h value (usb2.0 driver), to allow the USB 2.0 to be more permissive. I used to do that until kernel 3.11 was out for my Perixx gaming mouse. \n\nBuilding a new kernel with modifier hid.h value :\n1) Open a terminal (ctrl-alt-T)\n2) Launch the command :\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install fakeroot kernel-wedge build-essential makedumpfile kernel-package libncurses5 libncurses5-dev\nIt installs the requiered packages for the kernel building. You can apt-get remove <packages> afterwards to uninstall them if you wish. \n3) Enter the following commands to create a directory for the kernel sources : \n\n\n*\n\n*mkdir ~/source\n\n*cd ~/source\n\n*apt-get source linux-image-$(uname -r)\n4) Type :\n\n\n*\n\n*cd linux\nPress Tab to auto-fill the name, then press Enter.\n5) Launch :\n\n\n*\n\n*gedit include/linux/hid.h\nFind (Ctrl + F) the line #define HID_MAX_USAGES and change it's value to '64000'.\n6) Launch :\ncp -vi /boot/config-`uname -r` .config\n\nTo copy the configuration file of your current system.\n7) (Optionnal) To speed up the building process, you can adjust the concurrency level. Launch :\n\n\n*\n\n*export CONCURRENCY_LEVEL=#\nReplace # by the number of your CPU's cores + 1 (Dual-core will be \"3\", Quad-core \"5\", …)\n8) Launch :\n\n\n*\n\n*make-kpkg clean\nTo prepare the directory needed by the building process.\n9) Launch :\n\n\n*\n\n*fakeroot make-kpkg --initrd --append-to-version=-sk kernel-image kernel-headers\nThis will start the kernel building process. It can take a while (between 1h and 8h following your hardware). If the process is interrupted for some reason, you should launch the command rm ~/source and start over from step 3. The kernel binaries .deb will be placed in ~/source. \n\nTo install the new kernel :\n1) Open nautilus (file explorer) and go to /lib/modules.\n2) Open a Terminal and launch :\n\n\n*\n\n*cd ~/source\n3) Type the following commands and press **Tab to auto-fill the version of kernel, named here (KERNEL_VERSION) :**\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo dpkg -i linux-image-    \n\n*sudo dpkg -i linux-headers-\nBoth commands (once filled by Tab) must end by .deb\n4) Launch : \n\n\n*\n\n*sudo update-initramfs -c -k KERNEL_NAME\nYou have to replace KERNEL_NAME by the name used by the directory containing the modifier kernel (should end with \"-sk\" in nautilus).\n5) Launch :\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo update-grub\n(and also sudo update-burg if you use BURG).\n6) Restart the computer.\nYou now run a custom kernel ! Congrats' \n\nIf that doesn't work, the problem is NOT caused by HID (usb2.0 driver) and I have no idea how to help you :)\n", "Q: Problems booting Ubuntu, \"gave up waiting for root device\" I had very odd things happen after I decided to upgrade my Ubuntu 12.04 installation to the newer 13.10.\nI decided to upgrade version by version to avoid losing my configuration. The upgrade from 12.04 to 12.10 brought up the first problems with the graphic drivers. I had to remove the ATI fglrx package to get the x server to work. Then similar issues in 13.04. The worst part was after upgrading to 13.10 when Ubuntu won't load at all. I finally tried to format the partition and make a fresh install, to no avail. At this point even going back to 12.04 won't solve the problem.\nTrying to boot in safe mode will bring up the \"gave up waiting for boot device\" message (I'll attach a photo when I get hold of a PC - I'm on my phone right now).\nOne very odd thing I noticed is that the computer became extremely noisy, the fan is spinning as if some heavy process was consuming lots of resources, either when on the Live CD or even with just the initial Grub screen. Typing top won't reveal anything.\nI can load my Windows 7 installation on another partition just fine, and the fan quiets down in Windows eventually.\nI think something may have happened to the MBR, but using the boot-repair package did not fix it.\nAny ideas on what might be causing the issue / how to solve it?\n\nA: Well, I managed to solve the boot problem creating a boot partition. Why Ubuntu was booting fine beforehand and now it needs a boot partition is beyond my comprehension. Anyway, following the procedure explained in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootPartition I can now boot into Ubuntu 13.10.\nThe problem with the fan noise is still persisting, and I think is related to the graphics card. I'll keep working on that.\nEdit:\nThis page: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver has info on reducing the fan noise.

I followed the suggestions in this answer: https://askubuntu.com/a/287862/118240 to use gdisk to zap the GPT table. After that, I could not boot into Windows 8; the boot goes directly to the USB drive with Ubuntu. Anyways, fortunately I had created a backup with the gdisk 'b' command. I restored the backup with 'r', 'l', and 'w'.\nNow, upon loading, GParted shows the error: /dev/sda contains GPT signatures, indicating that it has a GPT table. However, it does not have a valid fake msdos partition table, as it should. Perhaps it was corrupted - possibly by a program that doesn't understand GPT partition tables. Or perhaps you deleted the GPT table, and are now using an msdos partition table. Is this a GPT partition table?\nWhen I click yes, GParted shows my partitions, but with red errors that make me nervous:\n\nRunning sudo gdisk /dev/sda shows this:\nPartition table scan:\n  MBR: not present\n  BSD: not present\n  APM: not present\n  GPT: present\n\nFound valid GPT with corrupt MBR; using GPT and will write new protective MBR on save.\n\nI don't have proof, but I'm 95% sure that before I zapped the GPT table, MBR said something other than not present. And I'm 50% sure it wasn't present, but I can't remember what (I'll probably remember in a few days when this is solved...).\nI don't have any important data on Windows (I just purchased the computer), but I'd rather not have to re-install it (I'm don't know if I'd have to re-purchase Windows 8, as it shipped already installed on the computer and I don't have a CD?).\nAnyways, can I safely write a new protective MBR with gdisk? Will that preserve my partitions, or have I done too much damage already? If not, are there any steps I can take?\n\nA: You last entry shows that gdisk will write a protective MBR with a write. So use gdisk and write the partition table. \nsudo gdisk /dev/sda\nCommand (? for help):\n\nat commands use p to list partitions, if they look ok then do a write at gdisk command. If not ok use q to exit. ? will show commands. It will just rewrite the gpt data, but also automatically write a correct protective MBR entry.\nThe protective MBR has just one partition table entry so old partition tools like fdisk will not try to write to it without at least showing that it is gpt. You only delete all gpt data if you install Windows in BIOS mode. But your Windows is UEFI and then can only be UEFI.\nYour example of having a backup of the partition table just shows how important that is. Without the backup, recovery is difficult or maybe impossible.\n", "Q: How can I stop less from storing history? Every time I search for a term in less, it stores my search in the file .lesshst.

This will not store any history of less from now on, until you change the .lesskey file.\nFrom the man page of less:\n\nENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\n   Environment variables may be specified either in the system environment\n   as usual, or in a lesskey  (1)  file.   If  environment  variables  are\n   defined  in  more  than one place, variables defined in a local lesskey\n   file take precedence over variables defined in the system  environment,\n   which take precedence over variables defined in the system-wide lesskey\n   file.\n\nLESSHISTSIZE\n          The maximum number of commands to save in the history file.

These assignment statements affect only the environment seen by that command.\n\nMore about that specific use at https://stackoverflow.com/a/52208927/117471\n\nA: Add this to your ~/.bashrc:\nexport LESSHISTFILE=-\n\nTo verify, you can now start a new shell, delete the ~/.lesshist file, and then start using less.

I just purchased an HP Pavilion 17 Notebook PC 17-e055nr. I wanted to install Ubuntu on a Western Digital 120 GB (WD1200U017-001) portable hard drive, while leaving the Windows 8 installation on the internal hard drive undisturbed. This is my first attempt at installing Ubuntu on a UEFI Secure Boot machine.\nThe procedure used is:\n1) Download the LiveDVD image, ubuntu-12.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso.\n2) Use \"Start Up Disk Creator\" on an existing Ubuntu machine to create a LiveUSB stick.\n3) Use gparted on an existing Ubuntu machine to delete all partitions on the portable hard drive.\n4) Disconnect the internal hard drive in the laptop (this is unnecessary but insures the internal drive is not altered).\n5) Boot the laptop with the LiveUSB stick and install Ubuntu on the portable hard drive.\n6) Reconnect the internal hard drive to the laptop.\n7) In the BIOS Setup, use Boot Options to change the UEFI Boot Order (a. USB Hard Disk, b. OS boot Manager).\nWhen powered up, if the portable drive is attached then Ubuntu loads. If the portable drive is not attached then Windows loads.\nThe procedure initially worked and I was able to boot Ubuntu from the portable drive once. After shutting down, the laptop never again recognized the portable drive as a bootable device. I repeated the above procedure with no success.\nThinking the Western Digital portable drive was at fault, I switched to a Toshiba 1 TB Canvio Basic 3.0 portable hard drive. The procedure worked. I was able to boot from the Toshiba drive several times. Then the HP laptop continually failed to recognize the Toshiba drive as a bootable device.\nAs an experiment, I used the above procedure on an Acer Aspire 5102WLMi (non UEFI Secure Boot) laptop and the Western Digital portable hard dirve. Everything worked fine on the Acer laptop. I tried to boot the HP laptop with the Western Digital drive created but the HP laptop failed to recognize a bootable device.\nThrough out this endeavor, the HP laptop consistently recognized and booted Ubuntu from the LiveUSB stick.\nI am not sure where the problem is:\na) the HP Pavilion 17 Notebook PC 17-e055nr hardware\nb) the Insyde F.17 BIOS\nc) Ubuntu 12.04.3\nThe lack of a stable Ubuntu install is unacceptable. My only options now seem to be update the BIOS, a direct install onto the internal hard drive, or to return the HP laptop to the store. My thinking is to return the laptop and wait another year for the UEFI technology to mature a bit more.\nAny thoughts or comments would be most welcomed.\n\nA: Under EFI, there's really no such thing as a \"boot drive\" in the same sense as under BIOS. Instead, EFI stores EFI boot loaders on the EFI System Partition (ESP), and it stores references to them in NVRAM. My suspicion is that this all worked fine when you set up the new drive, but then if you unplugged it and powered up, the firmware may have \"helpfully\" removed the NVRAM entry for the external disk, so that it never worked again.\nMy recommendation is to install a boot manager, such as gummiboot or my own rEFInd, on the computer's main hard disk. That will enable you to select which OS to boot at each boot. In the case of rEFInd, the Ubuntu option won't appear if the external disk isn't plugged in, and if you set the default to Ubuntu with a short timeout, the result will be a boot to Ubuntu when the external disk is plugged in and to Windows when it's not. The caveat to this is that if you leave Secure Boot enabled, you'll have to jump through some extra hoops, as described on the rEFInd Secure Boot page. It's likely to be easier to disable Secure Boot. (Note that Secure Boot is just one EFI feature, so you can continue booting in EFI mode even with Secure Boot disabled.)\nA similar solution is to install Ubuntu's GRUB on the internal disk's ESP rather than on the external disk's ESP. I don't think this would switch automatically between OSes when the external disk is plugged in vs. not, though.\n", "Q: Using Ubuntu 12.04 live from USB stick first time user id and password I just created a USB flash drive with 12.04 live.

There is a slim possibility that you will not have the supported drivers for your wifi card, but ubuntu won't let you install without a connection so you'd know. \n\nA: The best part is you are having Dell , What all you need to do is Install Ubuntu with consideration of Ubuntu System Architecture and after installation completes install all needed softwares and do -\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nand then Ubuntu Software Center and click on edit and then Software Sources in that go to additional drivers as shown below -  \n\nand your driver consideration is done, it will automatically additional driver for wifi and Graphic card if needed.\nHope it solves your problem.\n\nA: Dell machines have been pretty well supported on Ubuntu ever since Dell started selling laptops with Ubuntu pre-installed.\nThe only way to know for sure though is to run the live environment from a CD/DVD or USB.\nCheck out Ubuntu's guide to trying Ubuntu, and make sure you click \"Try Ubuntu\" first!\n", "Q: Trying to install CUDA on Ubuntu 13.10 Amazon g2.2xlarge GPU Cluster Does anybody know a way to do this?

I cannot tell anything about the Dell model.\nDock display support\nYou are required to install a firmware update for the dock using Windows, to make the dock display work with Linux. There is a patch on the way to make the dock compatible even with the older, buggy firmware.\nOne (1!) external monitor works fine connected to the dock. You can NOT use more than one, as the proper support for Display Port Multi Stream Transport hubs is missing in Linux. When connecting multiple monitors to the dock, the output is cloned on all of them.\nHowever, you can add an additional monitor by connecting it via VGA to the notebook directly. You would have to plug that manually. when un/docking.\nDock audio support\nYou need to do some fixing to make the docking station audio jack work.\nDock USB support\nNo issues.\nOther (Linux) issues\nMore info is well documented in a github wiki page of user leoluk.\n", "Q: Why is it on startup it takes me to a terminal login and vty instead of lightdm?

If this gives you your regular graphical desktop, we can look into why lightdm isn't started automatically.\nMissing desktop environment\nIf the above didn't help, you are probably missing your desktop environment.

I'm using for example following script xrandr --output VGA-0 --auto --right-of LVDS-0 to enable VGA output on the right from my notebook. Please specify what you mean by monochrome... by xrandr you can simply switch graphics mode of any graphics output, so it could be on one clik in the menu panel. Read xrandr --help on how to switch it to different monitors/modes\nColors off\nYou can use xrandr to tune colors... can suit your needs. watch for brightness and gamma settings\nUpdate: you can use xrandr to change saturation as well by the set attribute, example: xrandr --output TV --set Saturation 0-100. But the device and the driver should support it... otherwise you will get BadName error. I can imagine, that you will change it trough the color profile of your display. Solution very much depends on what you have.\nMonochrome icon/colour theme\nYou can switch monochrome theme on the fly in System settings - windows manager by choosing a monochrome theme. you can run settings from command line by xfwm4-settings see the man page for details: http://swoolley.org/man.cgi/1/xfwm how to switch it from the command line.

But the Ubuntu install doesn't run in Windows like a VM. It's not hosted at all. The only virtual part is the Ubuntu partition. \nSo you can't use any programs, like the nvidia control panel, that are only installed in Windows.

I that official Ubuntu documentation (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq) recommends having 2x ram for the swap partition and indicates that x is the minimum why aren't we defaulting to larger swap sizes, especially considering the relatively low expense of storage?\n\nA: Relatively low price of storage? Pfft. I have 24GB of RAM and 120GB of SSD. I'd strongly mind if I lost 48GB of SSD to swap.\nThis question deals with the high-RAM views in the industry. Basically, if you have tons of RAM, it's unlikely you're going to need tons of swap unless you're dealing with very specific workloads that could force things into swap.\nRAM+.5GB simply ensures there's more than enough to push all of RAM into swap at hibernate without too much of a fight. That should cover most behaviours.\nIf you're on a low-RAM system, you'll probably need more.\n", "Q: How to make lxpanel show up on both the monitors I recently installed lxpnael for having a all open windows list.

I am using iso image of 64 bit ubuntu named \"ubuntu-13.10-desktop-amd64.iso\" .. Please help me, I have tried various solution but did not fix it for last 3 days.\n\nA: I just encountered a similar issue when trying to install Mint 16 and Ubuntu 13.10 on my system (dual boot with Windows 7, replacement for existing Mint 15 installation). Both  Installations resulted in this message and reinstalling / reconfiguring Grub didn't fix it.\nIt seams that - at least in my case - the installer thought that I wanted to use EFI (Secure Boot) which is not the case. I explicitly disabled it in my UEFI BIOS, but when I checked /boot/grub it only contained a 'x86_64-efi' folder, the needed 'i386-pc' folder was missing (required for BIOS / non-EFI setup).\nThe following solution worked for me (with Ubuntu 13.10):\nBoot Live DVD/USB, open shell and execute:\nsudo -s\n#where sda1 is my root partition\nmount /dev/sda1 /mnt\nmount -t proc none /mnt/proc\nmount -t sysfs none /mnt/sys\nmount -o bind /dev /mnt/dev \nmount -o bind /tmp/ /mnt/tmp\n# chroot into your ubuntu installation\nchroot /mnt\n# remove all those grub efi packages\napt-get remove --purge grub-efi-amd64 grub-efi-amd64-bin\n# and re-install grub with the bios (non-efi) packages only\napt-get --reinstall install grub-common grub-pc os-prober\n# if there is an error repeat the setup via:\ngrub-install --recheck /dev/sda\n\nAdditional notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have a separate boot partition you need to mount it too before reconfiguring grub.\n\n*It may be necessary to leave some free (unpartitioned) space before the first partition for the boot loader (can be done with GParted in Live system).\n\n*If apt-get can't reach (find) the remote archive hosts, try to manually set the DNS server (at home usually the router's) IP, e.g.: \"echo nameserver 192.168.0.1 >> /etc/resolv.conf\"\n\n*Note that the setup may be different for GPT (non MBR partition table) + this will surely not work when dual booting with a system that needs EFI.\n\n\nA: Solution from this link works on Ubuntu 13.10, try once again, but in your case commands should look like below.\nsudo mount /dev/sdb5 /mnt\nsudo grub-install /dev/sdb --root-directory=/mnt\n\n\nA: I don't know if the user is encountering this problem on new machines or not, but this is what I found in a new PC I just received from my boss at work.\nAs usual, I wiped out the HDD to get rid of Windows, and installed Ubuntu 13.10 using a bootable flash drive. After installation and restart, I encountered the following error message:\n\n'/boot/grub/i386-pc/normal.mod' not found.\n\nAfter lots of reading on the web, and not being too happy with what I found, I decided to check the BIOS. One thing I discovered futzing around with my new PC's BIOS settings is that this new machine has two booting options; EFI or Legacy. The machine boots using EFI as default.\nI turned off my new PC, inserted the Ubuntu bootable flash drive, turned on the PC, hit F9 (might be different in other machines) until I got the boot source options. I selected to boot from the flash drive in Legacy mode. Hit Enter, and reinstalled Ubuntu again.\nThis time around, upon rebooting my machine, the PC booted normally.\n", "Q: Tried Gnome 3.10 on Ubuntu 13.10. How can I get Unity back?

You can type uname -m when you try Ubuntu Live (i.e. without installing)... if it shows x86_64 then you should install the 64 bit version of Linux, otherwise you have to install the 32 bit version.\nAlso, as Raj said it seems to be a problem with the installation medium or the software, especially since you are using Windows 8 64 bit on the same machine.\nIt is important that you use the right software to create/prepare the USB stick with the Ubuntu iso.

It acts as a DHCP server for 5 machines connected to a private 172.x.x.x network for internet access. The machines netboot from an image on the server.\nI tried to update the list of MAC addresses to add some new machines to the system, following instructions from our ex support company. It couldn't find the .txt file even though it was in the same folder. I Googled and it suggested file corruption. \nThere were about 60 updates pending. I originally selected no but after trying to reboot into recovery mode mode I think I must have said yes to these updates by accident. \nAfter installing the updates and rebooting, there are multiple graphics issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*No window decorations\n\n*Menus don't work.\n\n*Firefox doesn't really work\n\n*Sometimes X just doesn't work at all. I'm left with TTYs.\n\n\nI've never used unix/ubuntu before. And the support company has gone bust! I'm assuming that there was some file corruption already, but the huge update has also changed some of the settings for the DHCP and the video, along with who knows what else.\nHow to solve these issues ?\n\nA: The configuration sounds like it's been set up manually. The default DHCP settings will auto-allocate IP addresses to new MAC addresses ad store that lease for a period of time. \nThe settings, by they way, aren't in a .txt file. They're at /etc/dhcp3/dhcpd.conf and you can edit them from the console with nano like so:\nsudo nano /etc/dhcp3/dhcpd.conf\n\nYou should be able to edit that without the graphical session. I don't know why there's even a desktop installed. Most Ubuntu servers work headlessly (without a monitor or desktop). It's certainly unneccessary for a DHCP server.\nNothing you've described suggests corruption. It all points to you not having a clue what you're doing yet you're still making systemic changes. I don't understand how you could think this would end in anything but pain... Now you're in a position where a server and all its clients are down. And you're also getting close to the end of the lifespan of 10.04. The desktop support (ie Firefox and all the other graphical applications) have already expired. You shouldn't be using them. You need to upgrade the entire OS.\nIn short, everything's broken and you don't know how to fix any of it... It sounds to me like you desperately need to engage the services of a new support company. Or employ somebody with Ubuntu server experience (not that hard these days).\n", "Q: Tally ERP 9 Need native solution for UBUNTU i have install Tally ERP 9 on ubuntu using wine. but its pretty slow and facing lot of problem. your forum suggested to us VM ware or other virtual os but that goes slow after lot of data entry in tally and also cannot use in full screen.\nWe most do Tally and other works together like checking document while using tally and lot more work.. for that every time switch to win7 to ubuntu is headache. please provide some native solution for Tally. as this program is used by over 90% of Small and medium entreprise in india. if this works well then ubuntu will boom in domestic business market in india. i hope you will provide any further solution for this.\nThanks\nJitendra\n\nA: Install Oracle Virtual Box, and then Install Windows XP ,then tally ERP,  it will be fast. \nOtherwise there is no native solution for tally.

At the moment the Nvidia drivers are a pain in Ubuntu, if they could get this all working and stable, that would rock!\n\nA: All the features offered by Geforce Experience are designed exclusively for Windows. \nSince it deals with hardware drivers and settings for Windows-only games, there also is no need for it on Ubuntu.\n\nA: It is now possible to compile a version of OBS with NVENC to use your graphic card to encode what OBS record : just download this script script link and run the following command ./install_ffmpeg-nvenc_obs.shin your download folder and that will install you OBS with NVENC support OBS-NVENC.png called OBS-PORTABLE\n", "Q: open PDF files in Firefox I have Firefox and It was working fine.\nRecently , I cannot open PDF files even though I have a PDF tools . it start open it and then stuck ...\nso I have to download all PDF files in order to have a look at .\ncan anyone explain me the problem ???\nI have Firefox 25.0.1 and Ubuntu 12.04\n\nA: Try to download \"adobe reader\" or \"viewPDF \"from ubuntu software center. \n", "Q: Can the Norton Bootable Recovery Tool read Linux partitions? I have a PC that I can dual boot between Windows 7 and Ubuntu.\nIf I use the Norton Bootable Recovery Tool to scan the PC for viruses (by booting from the Norton CD), will then Norton also scan the Linux partition? Can it read the Linux file system format? \n\nA: I don't think that it will scan your Linux partition.\nNorton Bootable Recovery Tool comes only in 32bit, but it will not run correctly in x64 environment.  Also NBRT.exe is the shell the windows boots to. \nNow normally there's no need to scan Linux partitions, but if you want to do so, I would recommend that you download the Bitdefenter Live CD, and use that to scan both windows, and Linux partitions.\n\nA: There is no definitive info on the product site of the manufacturer. But since it only refers to repairing unbootable Windows installations, it is extremely unlikely to work on Linux installations, which makes it completely unnecessary to support non-Microsoft file systems. I can't even imagine how to prevent Windows from booting with malware located on a secondary partition.\nIf your question was, if you can repair a malware infested Linux installation with NTBR: No. There is not a single word on the product page about any other OS than Windows.\nEdit: I find it very unlikely that NTBR will touch your extfs partitions, because it can't do anything useful with them within its scope for the reasons mentioned above, and because it would be very unwise to do something destructive, if it doesn't even know what it's dealing with.\n\nA: First of all Norton Bootable Recovery Tool is integrated with Windows Preinstallation Environment (WinPE).\nSo basically its scans your pc and the windows based partitions like fat32 and ntfs  and makes your computer little slower, secondly it can not check linux partitions .even it wont detect it for consideration .As linux uses ext format of partition.\nSo there is nothing for Norton Bootable Recovery to look inside linux partition as it cant. \nOne of the biggest advantage of any linux distro over windows is they cant be affected by any virus easily, there is a rare chance of that , means you probably dont have to care about viruses in linux. \nHope thats what you wanted to know. \n\nA: Just in a chat with a Norton tech about NAV and internet security on a dual boot machine. After a lot of explanation, he said that Norton should not interfere until Windows is booted. He also said that Norton was able to scan (not specifically NTBR) the Linux area. Haven't got my dual boot machine in place yet, so this is just 'What he said.'\n", "Q: Can't boot ISO to my laptop in UNetbootin (Xubuntu 12.04 & Ubuntu 12.04) I was trying to install Linux Mint (and a few other OS's) through UNetbootin.

I've tried pressing F6 immediately after turning on the device but that didn't work.

(Runtime failure)\n\n\nSo I'd very much like to keep the second behavior, without the first if at all possible.\ndescription \"MyJob\"\n\nrespawn\n\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [!2345]\n\nscript\n    exec python /usr/local/bin/myscript.py\nend script\n\nAnyway, I could live with the dual behaviors if the initial restart or start commands return non-zero when the script exits within a small window.\nHow can I do this?\n\nA: I figured it out.\ndescription \"MyJob\"\n\nrespawn\n\n# retry 4 times in 3 seconds\n# This should ALWAYS be true:\n# 4 times * sleep .5 < 3 sec\n# Otherwise it will continue respawning forever\nrespawn limit 4 3\n\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [!2345]\n\nscript\n    exec python /usr/local/bin/myscript.py\nend script\n\npost-start script\n    # Time after starting service should unquestionably be running\n    sleep .5\n    if ps fax | grep '[m]yscript' ; then\n        exit 0\n    fi\n    exit 1\nend script\n\n", "Q: SFTP connection successful, but can't upload files I followed this guide.\nI am using Ubuntu Server and Filezilla, and I can succesfully connect. However, I can only read and download files, not upload or edit them. If I change the file permissions to either 777 or 766, Filezilla can no longer connect.\nAnyone know what I'm doing wrong?\n\nA: Your chroot path must be owned by root and have permissions of 755 or 750. If you change that sshd will reject connections, because such a chrooted environment is considered insecure. Writing to the chrooted directory with sftp is not possible.\nYou should make a new subdirectory under the chroot directory, and that directory's ownership and permissions can be changed to anything. So you can write to that subdirectory.\n", "Q: Sound problem in Kubuntu 13.10 I have a sound problem on Kubuntu 13.10 which I find rather annoying. The problem comes in two stages. \nBy default, I cannot listen to skype. So, following a suggestion similar to this one, I added the usual tsched=0  to the line\n  load-module module-udev-detect tsched=0\n\nin the file /etc/pulse/default.pa. At this point, skype started working well. But this broke the audio on my Netflix connection (through Wine & Firefox), which worked flawlessly earlier on. I quickly discovered that, getting rid of the tsched=0 addition, restored a correct sound on Netlfix (via Wine-> Firefox), but again compromised the audio on skype. \nIn the end, I have a major and a minor question.\n\n\n*\n\n*Are there settings that accommodate both skype and Netflix?\n\n*If the answer to the previous question is no, is there at least a way, complex though it may be, to restart PulseAudio without rebooting the pc? \n\n\nA: I have found a solution to my question number two, i.e. how to switch from one configuration for pulseaudio to another without rebooting the pc. \n1) Comment out the following line in /etc/pulse/default.pa \n  load-module module-udev-detect \n\n2) The following two commands will restart pulseaudio with or without (respectively) the tsched=0 option:\n  pulseaudio --kill &&  pulseaudio --start --load=\"module-udev-detect tsched=0\"\n  pulseaudio --kill &&  pulseaudio --start --load=\"module-udev-detect\"\n\nThe reason for commenting out the line above is that, when restarting pulseaudio, the command pulseaudio --start reads both the command line option and the configuration file, where it will find a conflicting prescription for module-udev-detect in the case of the first command, which will then fail with error message \n  E: [pulseaudio] main.c: Daemon startup failed.\n\nCommenting out the line above prevents this error. All of this can be easily scripted, and one of the two commands above (in my case, the second one) can be inserted into /etc/rc.local, so that after boot, a fully working configuration for pulseaudio is in place. \n", "Q: Missing 50GB on my 100Gb harddrive I have a 128GB harddrive formatted with the btrfs. However, for some reason I'm missing around half of the disk space. Do any of you have any idea of how to fix it?\nSee this screenshot for details\n\n\n\nA: The output of btrfs subvolume list / shows multiple subvolume snapshots (apparently created by an apt trigger for backup). Those can claim a lot of disk space, if many file blocks have been changed since the creation of the snapshot, and they don't show up in the directory listings (and therefore don't contribute to the disk usage of the listed files).\nYou can delete old (or all) snapshots with btrfs subvolume delete [snapshot name] (see man 8 btrfs for details) if you feel you don't need them anymore. Afterwards a periodically (typically every few seconds) run btrfs kernel service will release the now unused disk space within a minute or so.\nIf you want do disable or reconfigure that apt trigger, I suggest you create a new question.\nOn a completely different note, I suggest you add the ssd mount flag to your root partition. /home has it already.\n", "Q: What are the Default $PATH Values? On Mac OS X, the default $PATH values are:\n/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin\n\nWhat are the default values on Linux?\n\nA: There are path builtin the shells which is \necho $PATH\n/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\n\nThen the default path for Ubuntu is:\necho $PATH\n/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games\n\n\nA: There's an easy way to find out:\nprintenv\n\nOr, more directly:\necho $PATH\n\nBut, if you're just looking for some quick info, Ubuntu typically sets the path to:\n/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/games:\nFor questions like this, you can usually dig up the answer by reading the Bible.\n\nA: Depending on which Linux your using, it might be different.  If you have a login to a linux already, just type 'env' to see your environment variables.  \nIf you want to know how the PATH env variable is getting built, have a look at .bashrc and .bash_profile in your home directory.  If more curious, you can also look at /etc/profile, /etc/profile.d/* (if exists) and manual for bash (man bash).\n\nA: On a default Ubuntu desktop install $PATH is:\n$ echo $PATH\n/usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games\n\nBut in a minimal chroot environment created by debootstrap, $PATH only contains:\n# echo $PATH\n/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\n\n\nA: To see the default path use what other mentioned in answers:\necho $PATH\n\nTo edit use:\ngedit ~/.bashrc\n\nThis default PATH variable are defined under /etc/enviroment.\n\nA: Environment path values are stored in .bashrc file in ubuntu.\nThe system-wide PATH variable is defined in /etc/environment\n\nA: bash will set PATH to a hard-coded default value if it's not set in the environment:\n$ env -i bash -c 'echo $PATH'\n/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin:.\n\nWe can check that this value is indeed hard-coded, and not read from the environment or some file, using the strings utility:\n$ strings /bin/bash | grep /usr/sbin\n/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin:.\n\nHowever, I get a different result on my Arch Linux machine:\n$ env -i bash -c 'echo $PATH'\n/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin\n\nSo, the default is chosen at the time the bash binary was built, which depends on the Linux distribution in use.\nThe bash man page states:\n\nPATH\nThe search path for commands.  It is a colon-separated list of directories in which the shell looks for commands (see COMMAND EXECUTION below). A zero-length (null) directory name in the value of PATH indicates the current directory. A null directory name may appear as two adjacent colons, or as an initial or trailing colon. The default path is system-dependent,\nand is set by the administrator who installs bash. A common value is /usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin.\n\nHere, \"installs\" likely refers to make install (as opposed to installing a pre-built binary using a package manager), so \"administrator\" would refer to the distribution vendor.\nThe \"INVOCATION\" section in the man page describes the startup process, which may affect the initial value of the variable.\n\nA: The canonical location seems to vary across distributions.  With Debian 10, the system-default PATH is defined in /etc/login.defs.  The default PATH for normal users is its ENV_PATH variable and the default for super-users is ENV_SUPATH.  These will be used for sessions that don't spawn shells (e.g. cron jobs)\nOther defaults may be defined by the per-shell scripts, including:\n\n*\n\n*/etc/bash.bashrc\n\n*/etc/csh.cshrc\n\n*/etc/csh.login\n\n*/etc/profile\n\n*/etc/profile.d/*\n\n", "Q: Unable to boot on windows after installing ubunu I just intalled ubuntu(the real one) and now i am unable to run on my previous win7.\nAs far as i know I didn't overwrite the windows partition.\nIf I try to launch windows it breaks down directly(with safe mode too). \nWindows isn't able to start (I even lost access to the f11 menu) and asks me to insert a boot device (which I do not have sine it was pre-installed). \nI followed some tipps and installed boot_repair which gives the following output http://paste.ubuntu.com/6525891/ (some EFI detected).\nAltough I am a newbie I presume the error is coming from the ubuntu booter.\nI am completely lost so thank you for any help :)\n\nA: Before proceeding to any further make sure the Ubuntu System Architecture you are trying to use is supported by you processor then,\nTry Boot-repair  to repair you grub , for doing so you have to boot ubuntu live usb or dvd and after booting click on try-ubuntu.\nWhen desktop screen appears press Ctrl+Alt+t  for opening terminal and run the follwing commands into the terminal -\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && (boot-repair &)\n\nAfter that the boot-repair window will appear ,in that select Recommended repair option . After completion restart your pc .it will be fixed. If you need assistance clcik on the link mentioned in first line. \nhope it will work.\n\nA: Your description of the Windows boot failure is quite vague, so it's not clear if the problem is in GRUB's handoff to the Windows boot loader (which should be fixable in Linux) or in some subsequent Windows-specific step (which would require fixing using a Windows recovery disc). If the former, you might try a USB flash drive or CD-R of my rEFInd boot manager. (One caveat: You'll need to either disable Secure Boot or jump through extra hoops to get rEFInd to boot with Secure Boot active.) If rEFInd can get both Windows and Linux to launch, you can install its Debian-package version in Ubuntu. rEFInd will then take over from GRUB as your primary boot manager.\n\nEDIT: The boot configuration data (BCD) is data that the Microsoft boot loader uses to help with the boot process. I'm foggy on the details, but you can think of it as being roughly analogous to GRUB's configuration file, grub.cfg. Thus, your error message definitely indicates that the problem is on the Windows end -- although it's entirely possible that the file was accidentally deleted or damaged by Linux. I recommend you try using a Windows recovery disc (I have no URLs; try Googling for one, but be cautious -- something from some random Web site might be malware!) or post on a Windows forum for advice.\nOne more comment: There's a chance that the problem was caused by the Windows 8 (if that's what you're running) Fast Startup feature, which turns a shutdown into a suspend-to-disk operation. This means, among other things, that filesystems (including the ESP's FAT) are not properly shut down, so that when they're accessed from Linux, they can be damaged; and when you reboot into Windows, it will be confused by the changes made by Linux. Thus, it's critical that you disable Fast Startup. Various Web pages describe how to do this, like this one. Note that the Windows Fast Startup feature is completely different from any \"fast boot\" or \"fast startup\" feature you might set or disable in the firmware, so don't think that you've dealt with the issue by adjusting your firmware.\n\nA: The origin of the error was way more simple... The installation disk my friend gave me turned out to be actually a 32 bit version. \nTherefore gnud was 32bits too and unable to run 64bits windows7.

It is to my understanding that (as it was many moons ago at universities and the like) you can still use one central setup to do the processing/video/account/file management and have terminals to access it that merely function as a screen, keyboard, and mouse which to provide input back to the main PC.\nSSH is an easy way to do this from a command line point of view, but I have a few old laptops that would function excellent as terminals, while leaving the load to my self-proclaimed super computer...

If you're using KDE, you can't simply swap out one for the other. Kubuntu was designed and built around KDE, so while it's technically possible, it would be a lot of command-line work, and you could potentially leave your computer unable to boot if you're not extremely careful.\nIn fact, it's so much work, that I suspect it would probably easier just to back up your /home/ folder to a cloud service or external drive and start with a clean install of Mint right off, which comes with Cinnamon already.\nIf, on the other hand, you want to \"keep it in the family,\" then start with a clean install of Unity-powered Ubuntu, then follow the directions in the first answer to replace Unity with Cinnamon.\nOnce you've finished the clean install of one or the other and you've verified that everything works, simply restore the contents of /home/ from wherever you backed it up to, and you're done.\n\nA: To have a solved solution for this answer:\nMake sure, you do not have cinnamon-session installed, by typing this command:\nsudo apt-get install cinnamon cinnamon-session_\n\nThe underscore will mark cinnamon-session for removal upon installing the coorect cinnamon package.\n", "Q: want to access local Ubuntu server to get files to hosting I do have local Ubuntu server with files, I need to access those files and upload them to my website hosting.

Some of them needs some libraries, but you can find info for every single app here in WineHQ.\n\nA: In fact you can use with Wine almost all portable windows applications. Just create a folder, let say, Portable, where to add the launcher from the portable application. After that, using that launcher (it will stay in the Ubuntu system tray) you can open from there all programmes from this directory. Also, most of Windows programs work portable too. Once you install them you can move all the folders inside Portable (just must to be in the other partition than where you have that program installed) and the launcher will see them and you can launch them. Once that is working you can uninstall them from Wine and use them portable.\nOnly programs that do not work as portable are system programs (antivirus, registry clean, etc) but anyway you do not need those kind of Windows programs under Linux/Ubuntu.\nSorry for my English.

The particulars as to why are as follows, but the essense of my question is basically captured in in that first sentence; how might I automatically execute a command some time after startup?\nThe details:\nI'm using boinc in conjunction with my cuda-enabled graphics card.  It all works great, except for the fact that when I start up my computer fresh I get a gpu missing error in the boinc manager.  This is easily fixed with a sudo service boinc-client restart but this needs to be done whenever the computer starts up in order to engage the GPU.  My hunch is that boinc is starting before the necessary graphics card drivers load.  (Seems reasonable, right?)  Anyway, if you know a more elegant way than I've proposed above to resolve this, I'm all ears but, as far as I'm concerned, restarting boinc like 2 minutes after the computer starts up is good enough for me.\nThanks for any insight!\n\nA: Stick the command in /etc/rc.local which gets executed after all the other start-up stuff. You could put a \"sleep 5\" before it too to delay 5 seconds more for example. No need for sudo if rc.local as it is executed as root.\n", "Q: Made an executable .jar , runs on Windows but Ubuntu doesn't run it?

My system is a dual boot, windows 8 (Originally windows 7, if it matters)/Ubuntu.\nThe other day, I shrunk my Windows partition, to extend my linux partition. It's not the first time I've done it, but it's the first time I've had any issues. I shrunk windows using EaseUS Partition master, that went with no problem. I booted a live CD to extend my Linux partition, it all seemed like it was working, then all of a sudden it froze. Here's where I think I messed up. I thought I had to restart my system.\nWhen it booted back up, I was met with the grub rescue command line, had no idea what I was doing, so I googled it. I ran the commands I found on google to try and boot my linux back up, didn't work. I booted into the Live CD, and tried a grub repair. Restarted my laptop once again, was met with a different grub screen (Grub version 1.99).\nNo clue what I was doing, tried the commands again- They kept telling me file not found, then that I needed to load a Kernel. Well, I tried changing the commands I used, and successfully booted into windows.\nI booted from the live CD again, and tried to mount the Ubuntu partition. It was practically empty. There was only random system folders/files (One was the Initrd.img file or whatever, that I needed for Grub booting- so not sure why it said the file wasn't found) But all my user data was GONE.\nIs there any way I can rescue my data? Or even my system maybe? Any help would be greatly appreciated, sorry for the verbose explanation.\n\nA: Try taking a look at  how to recover partition data.\nIf this doesn't work there are other methods of file recovery as noted in this post.\n\nA: Always backup your important data, especially before doing any risky stuff like partitioning.\nI am no expert, but it seems to me that by rebooting the system, you interrupted the partitioning process. So I think your Linux partition is corrupted. There are a few things you can do:\n1) Try to fix your partition with command-line utility called fsck. I've used this tool in the past to repair corrupted partitions. Keep in mind that some data may get lost in the process. So you might want to make an image of your corrupted partition before proceeding. Once the partition is fixed, Linux might still not boot, but you can at least copy your data using a Live CD.\n2) Use GParted to attempt a data rescue. To do this, run GParted from a Live CD (e.g. PartedMagick) and go to Device > Attempt Data Rescue.

I am setting up bazaar, and need to tell it my identity using whoami command.\nAm confused as to whether I should provide my real name, or my online/pen name for the purpose?\n\nA: There is not necessarily a single correct answer to this question. Bazaar stores the claimed email address in revisions when they're created, so that people can tell who committed which revisions. If you don't plan to publish the branch in a public location, it does not matter at all really. If you do plan to publish the branch or hope to have the changes merged into an existing public project, the identity provided is how you will be attributed.

The installation seemed to work fine (I installed Ubuntu on my third hard drive). Now how do I boot to Ubuntu? \n\nA: If your computer came with Windows 8 or 8.1 installed, there will be an option in your BIOS settings to boot into legacy or UEFI mode. (You can access your BIOS settings by pressing F2 or F8 or a different key depending on your motherboard, Google it and it should be easy.) \nWhile on your Windows partition, create a bootable USB stick using the software called Rufus, because Rufus gives you the choice to create a USB stick that can be used on UEFI or legacy boot. Chose and create your USB for MBR bios (legacy).\nAccess your bios and change it from UEFI to legacy mode. \nOnce you boot your computer with your USB stick plugged in, install it in a partition of your choice. The only downside to that is that your every time that you want to boot to your other operating system you will have to change your bios settings (to UEFI if you want to boot to your windows 8.1 and to Legacy if you want to boot to your ubuntu).\nI have done the same thing and my dual boot works like a charm with Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 14.04\nLink to download Rufus for Windows: http://rufus.akeo.ie/ \n(Get the latest version for best results)\n", "Q: Dialogue Windows Look Wrong After Upgrade I recently upgraded to 13.10, and I'm noticing that nearly all of the dialog windows look like they're from 1999.

Is there another way to install Ubuntu or shall I gut the Dell and use the case as a flower pot?\n\nA: As long as you can connect to the internet, you can use the network installer.\nYou would need a decent connection but you should be able to use it  \nThe link to get them is in this page, I am including the page as I'm not sure if you want 12.04 or 13.10:\nAlternative downloads\nIf your computer was an XP computer it may do better with a lighter weight Ubuntu desktop like Xfce or LXDE (the ones used in Xubunt or Lubuntu). The catch however, is that you will have to install the standard Ubuntu and then install the other desktops if you find that Unity is too slow for you as as far as I was able to determine, neither have network installers as an option.\nYour computer may do fine running the standard Ubuntu, my old XP computer was able to handle Unity fine in 11.04 and 11.10.  I bought a new computer just before 12.04 came out so I can't say about the newer versions but it is likely that my old computer would still run fine.  Mine was not a top of the line XP model so if you have a very good XP computer as you question states then I think you will be ok with Unity, I was just including the info about Xfce and LXDE \"just in case\"\n\nTo add some more info, the network installer is not as simple as the LiveCD method so you should check out the install instructions(there is a lot of info here so be prepared for a long read)  \nThis is the install info for 12.04\nThis is the install info 13.10\nWhile I cannot help with the network install, there are a lot of user here and somone can help you if you are unsure about how to do it.  Just post another question about how to use the network installer and I think some kind soul will help you in short order.\n\nA: You have to use the network installer that will download and install the OS direct from inetrnet.\nElse, you have to use an external CD/DVD rom and you can install using the standard installer.\nCheck this for more information about installation methods for Ubuntu\n", "Q: Ugly fonts in Firefox with infinality I recently installed truetype-infinality and infinality-fontconfig on my Xubuntu and set the rendering style to OSX.

I've been programming for about a year and a half on Windows and I've just started getting used to the way things work on that platform, but now I'm interested in development on Linux and I've been having a tough time getting used to the workflow, lack of IDE, and command line compilation with GCC. I'm running Xubuntu 13.10 64bit, by the way..\nTo test the waters, I did what many people do and wrote a quick C++ 'hello world' program.\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main()\n{\n    std::cout << \"Hello!\\n\";\n    return 0;\n}\n\nMy first issue is; this program seems to get a compilation error when I try to compile it using GCC, but it compiles fine when I use the G++ compiler:\ngcc hello.cpp -o hello\n/tmp/ccbmUmzf.o: In function `main':\nhello.cpp:(.text+0xa): undefined reference to `std::cout'\nhello.cpp:(.text+0xf): undefined reference to `std::basic_ostream<char, std::char_traits<char> >& std::operator<< <std::char_traits<char> >(std::basic_ostream<char, std::char_traits<char> >&, char const*)'\n/tmp/ccbmUmzf.o: In function `__static_initialization_and_destruction_0(int, int)':\nhello.cpp:(.text+0x3d): undefined reference to `std::ios_base::Init::Init()'\nhello.cpp:(.text+0x4c): undefined reference to `std::ios_base::Init::~Init()'\ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\n\nWhat's going on here, is GCC failing to recognize that my code is C++ or something?\nMy second issue is with trying to use libraries: I was under the impression that the GTK+3.0 development libraries come included with (X)ubuntu, but when I try to follow the simple tutorial here, i get the following error from G++:\ng++ hello.cpp -o hello\nhello.cpp:1:21: fatal error: gtk/gtk.h: No such file or directory\n #include <gtk/gtk.h>\n                     ^\ncompilation terminated.\n\nSo then, I interpreted that to mean that the libraries for GTK+3.0 aren't installed.. So I checked apt-get, and I didn't really see anything that looked like what I needed.. Do i have to build GTK+3.0 from source, or is there some PPA somewhere that I need??\nThese issues are really frustrating to me.. I know that a lot of people swear by the GNU/Linux development workflow, but as someone who is used to working in Visual Studio, I'm finding the process to be somewhat opaque and unintuitive. Right now I'm using Mousepad on Xubuntu to edit my code, and while it has color-coded syntax, it seems to do very little beyond that. I know that eventually I'll have to deal with multiple files and creating makefiles and, at this point, I'm dreading it!\nWhatever help you can give to a novice programmer and total Linux/GNU noob is very welcome!\n\nA: Advice\nFirst of all, you don't have to settle for no IDE. Install Eclipse, it's available in the Ubuntu Software Centre. You also want to install CDT for Eclipse which gives you C/C++ support. Second I'd very much advise you to focus on C++ and Qt instead of C and GTK. Qt is a great cross-platform framework that uses C++ and QML (a JavaScript-like language for UI), and Ubuntu is moving more and more towards using Qt for their future desktop and mobile development. These tools will allow you not only to create beautiful applications for Ubuntu desktop but also for Android, Windows, Mac, BlackBerry and other OSes. An excellent Qt-specific IDE is QtCreator, also available in the Ubuntu Software Center, you should check it out along some Qt tutorials.\nAnswer\nTo answer you question directly, even though I strongly recommend doing what I outlined above, you likely need the -dev versions of the libraries you use. For GTK 3, you likely have to:\nsudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev\n\nThat should get you all GTK 3 headers.\n", "Q: Alternatives To Leopard Flower On Windows I usually setup my firewall to block all network access to programs I don't feel need internet access. The only similar program I've been able to find for Ubuntu is Leopard Flower, but it seems to be a rather unheard of project and so I'm hesitant to start using it, and I'm wondering if there is perhaps something more common that has similar features. I would like to be able to block operating system components, and regular software from accessing the network (send/receive), as well as block individual ips on a per program basis.\n\nA: iptables is the low-level tool for manipulating how the kernel deals with network access, but it is rather complicated to use directly. So there are wrapper programs such as ufw:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW\nwhich make the task of setting up firewall rules somewhat easier.\nThere is a GUI for ufw as well:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Gufw\nHaving different rules for specific programs would be more complicated.\n", "Q: 64-bit installation of Ubuntu doesn't recognize more than 2.9GB of RAM My BIOS recognizes 4GB, Ubuntu 13.10 only sees 2.9GB.

You have 1 Gig of RAM that can not be accessed. This can happen because of several things, but I would guess that the update updated video drivers and that your card is \"using\" part of that RAM. \nYou may want to check that your RAM is not \"marked bad\" with something like Bad RAM.\nBasically you need to figure out where the missing memory is. It's there, your system sees it, it's just mapped to something different then your used to. \nanswer taken from here.\n\nA: Turns out, after a BIOS flash, that one of my sticks of RAM was dead.

I am not sure if those two apps are related to the issue, but this is the only thing I can think of.\nReading other similar questions around AskUbuntu (about 8 of them), I could not find a solution that would work for me.\nThe problem is not related to the headphones (same issue with three sets), and the internal speakers of the laptop work fine. The headphones are still recognised as the speakers are muted when the headphones are plugged.\nThe issue is not a hardware issue as I could boot into a usb startup disk with 13.10 and use headphones without any problems.\nWhen a sound is supposed to be sent to the headphones (music, or sound when changing the sound level for example), I only get a little \"breathing\" sound or a crackle.\nI played with the sound settings to no avail (changing the output manually), as well as alsamixer.\nI also tried reinstalling (and purging) the following packages:\n\n\n*\n\n*alsa-base\n\n*pulseaudio\n\n*indicator-sound\n\n\nBut nothing changed.\nI also tried editing the following files:\n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf\n\n*/usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/paths/analog-output-headphones.conf\n\n\nas suggested in that question, but still no results.\nI am sure I could reinstall the whole system but I have so many apps, ppa, configuration files and documents everywhere that I would rather find a smaller fix.\nI was wondering if you had any idea of other packages I could try to uninstall ; purge ; reinstall? \nOr any other idea?\nCheers!\n\nUpdate: I edited this as I now figured out that it is Audacity's problem. Every time I try to use it, my headphone port stops working straight away, and even when Audacity is closed, I can not use anything else with my headphones. It takes a few days before the problem fixes itself somehow.\n\nA: I found a workaround that I described in the bug report mentioned in the other answer (bug 1257956, related to bug 1018262).\nI went into Audacity and changed the microphone source in the drop-down menu from \"sysdefault: Headphone Mic:0\" to \"sysdefault: Internal Mic:0\" and it fixed it.\nI can now use my headphones, even when I restart Audacity.\n\nA: It is apparently a bug with Audacity 2.0.3 to 2.0.5, it messes up Alsa, as described on Launchpad. I haven't found any way to repair this, except reinstalling and not using Audacity.\nAccording to some Google searches, you could maybe bypass that bug using OSS instead of Pulseaudio, or try an older version of Audacity, but I haven't tried it, I'm tired of reinstalling Ubuntu (once with 2.0.3 and once with 2.0.5)\n\nA: I ran into this same problem with the 2.1.2 version of Audacity that comes with Ubuntu. I installed Audacity 2.2.0 from \nhttps://launchpad.net/~ubuntuhandbook1/+archive/ubuntu/audacity\nand now my headphones work again.\n\nA: Changing the input source from sysdefault: Headphone Mic:0 to sysdefault: Internal Mic:0 prevents the problem from occurring again.\nTo fix the problem once it has occurred, try disabling and re-enabling your microphone (using the mute button) in your sound settings. \nAt least with my desktop environment (Gnome), the headphone jack starts working again once I do that.\n\nA: I had the same problem.\nAfter starting Audacity I executed\nalsactl init\nwhich enabled the sound for my headphones.\n", "Q: Using Ubuntu 12.10 and LAMP I have installed Ubuntu 12.10 LTS Desktop and LAMP on Dedicated HD running Win& 64bit.\nWhen I try to Start Apache2  with sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start I get error message on dashboard \"Sorry there is nothing that matches your search\" this happens wit many commands in the Terminal.

Any one know how to fix this issue?\n\nA: There are a wide variety of potential reasons for this. I can't comment to ask for more info, so I'll do the best I can here :)\nOne thing to do is to look for any messages that mention \"afs\" in the kernel log. Either look in /var/log/kern.log, /var/log/syslog, /var/log/messages, or the output of the dmesg command. AFS may be complaining that it cannot contact certain servers, which could explain why something is hanging.\nAnother way to look into this further is to get a stack trace of all processes on the system. You can do this by running the following as root:\n# echo t > /proc/sysrq-trigger\n\n(Reference: https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysrq.txt)\nAfter running that, there should be a ton of information logged to the the kernel log (either /var/log/kern.log or others, as mentioned above). You'll need to provide that information to an OpenAFS developer so they can interpret it and say what's going on. You could send that information to openafs-info@openafs.org, or openafs-bugs@openafs.org. Be sure to include the version of OpenAFS you are running, as well as what platform (version of Ubuntu, or Linux kernel version).

So, 644 for files, and 755 for directories is appropriate (or 664 and 775 if you want to give a group write access).\n\n*It is not recommended to set any of it to be writable by the web server, ie www-data, except for any specific files your web scripts to be able to write to.  If so, it's better to set the user or group of those files to www-data than to make them world-writable.  Note that any time the www-data user can write to any file within the web root, whether it's by setting the user or group on those files, or making them world-writable, it's a potential security problem.

Should I use \"primary\" for Ubuntu and \"logical\" for Windows?\n\n*What should be the location for the new partition?\n\n*What should I choose in the \"Use as\" dropdown menu where I have: Ext4 journaling file system, Fat32 and so on?\n\n*Should the mount point be /boot for Ubuntu?\n\nI do not know which settings would be optimal for Windows and which for Linux, and I prefer asking directly instead of just taking some of the answers on Google for a not completely similar problem.\nAdditionally, are there any settings I have to be aware of during the installation to make sure we can choose to boot from Linux or Windows every time we boot?\n\nA: The simple answer is: first install Windows on the whole disc. after you finished that install Ubuntu and choose the 'install alongside Windows' option in the installation menu. this should take care of everything automatically.\nBut you can also choose to partition the disc manually, which gives you more controll but makes it a bit more complicated. \nIt remains that you best first install Windows, In its installer you already leave some space free for your Ubuntu installation.\nnow you install Ubuntu, In the \"use as\" drop-down you choose EXT4. and as mount point you choose \"/\".\nNow when you manually partition I would advise to make a separate partition for \"/home\". this is where all your documents and application settings are stored. that means that when you reinstall Ubuntu the next time none of that should get lost (although always backup!). in this setup you make a relative small partition (for example 20 gb if you have the space) for your Ubuntu and applications and mount it as \"/\" and the rest of your disc a partition mounted as \"/home\" for your documents.\nedit: I forgot about the swap partition, in both cases where you do the partition manually you have to make a small partition (max twice the RAM in your system) and select under \"use as\" Swap!\n\nA: its simple , first install Windows on Primary Partition  C Drive and then use any partitioning software to delete any of the partition in which you want to install Ubuntu or use Windows Disk Management to delete that partition .Preferably choose the last partition of your disk  having at least 20gigs.\nCreate Bootable USB Stick y using Universal Universal Installer , as explained here or create a bootable Dvd as Shown here.\nThen restart your system and enter into Bios and change the boot Priorities to either USB or Dvd, depending on what you are using to install it.\nAfter Saving changes restart your pc and connect USB then Ubuntu Installation Interface will be prompted , in that choose INSTALL UBUNTU , provide all the details , When it ask for where to install choose Something Else , here you have to be very careful , do exactly what I am about to say -\nLook at the partion , there will be one named as FREE SPACE click on that then click on + to split it into usable partition  , then change the size of the partition by scroll down option or enter it manually ,the size should exactly same as the Physicall ram or Double of it and in the format option choose SWAP AREA let it be logical and check at the end of SPACE.  till now we are done with creating swap partion.\nNext click on + again and let the size as it is then check begining of the space and choose partion EXT4 and in the mount Option choose / that is for root partition means everything will be installed in it, and let this to be LOGICAL.\nClick next and Install it .\nRemember both the partitions are LOGICAL , swap is at the end of space and root at the beginning ,in swap just select format as SWAP AREA with no mount option and for root Partition choose the partition EXT4 with mount point / .\nHope i have explained exactly what you want.\n\nA: ...\"primary\" for Ubuntu and \"logical\" for Windows? Nope! Windows OS should be installed to a primary partition; for Ubuntu you can use either primary or logical.\nFor an Ubuntu installation you'll need at least one partition (ext4/ext3/ext2) for the root ( / ) partition (at least 5GB). A swap partition of size equal to (or up to 3 times if you're short on RAM) the size of your RAM is recommended. Although newer systems have a good deal of RAM available, a swap is still recommended if you use sleep or hibernation features. These two are the recommended partitions. (If you like, you can create separate partitions for /home, /boot, ... You can have them all in the logical partitions.\nHere is the layout of my partitions.\n\nIn my hard disk sda, sda1, used for Windows and sda2, for Ubuntu's root ( / ) partition  are primary (but you can use a logical partition for / ). A swap partition of size equal to 1.5x RAM in logical partition.\nIf you're not very comfortable partitioning on yourself, you could allow Ubuntu installation disk do it for by choosing install alongside Windows option.\n", "Q: Indicator Synapse keyboard shortcut I'm trying to change Indicator Synapse keyboard shortcut using dconf-editor.\nnet -> launchpad -> synapse-project -> indicator \n\nOn shortcut i set \n<Control>space\n\nbut nothing changes.\nNotice that event the default keybind is not working (Super Alt space)\nI am using ubuntu 13.10\nAny ideas?\n\nA: This is a known issue Shortcut to activate synapse resets to Control-space every reboot and still pending.

I expected badsectors to check every sector, and I thought this would also increase the \"Reallocated Sector Count\" (as I assume this only increases as sectors are used).\nFrom what I've read, it appears \"Reallocated sectors\" are unreadable/unwriteable sectors identified by the hard drive, which are remapped to another area of the drive - and this is transparent to the OS?\nBad sectors are sectors unreadable/unwriteable sectors identified by the OS, and are marked 'bad' to prevent their use by the OS.\nI'm struggling to see \n 'a' how the OS can identify bad sectors, when the drive should be transparently remapping them?\n 'b' How my OS is finding more bad sectors than the drive has reallocated sectors? (are reallocations only triggered by 'write' actions?\nA summary with a link to a detailed resource is fine - I don't mind the reading, but all the part-answers I've found so far say fun fsck, run badsectors or \"replace the drive ASAP\"\n\nA: Your guess is right. The drive only reallocates a sector when a write operation fails. Check wikipedia. Also take a look at the Current Pending Sector Count S.M.A.R.T attribute. The pending sectors are those which had read failures but no write failures, upon writing to these sectors the sectors will be reallocated.\nThe OS would know nothing about a remapped sector, because remapping is transparent, this means that is the OS try to write to a sector e.g 27643 and that write fails, then the drive will remap the sector internally to another physical area. Then when the OS tries again to write to sector 27643 it will succeed. The OS doesn't know that it is writing to a different physical area.\n\nA: A bad sector is simply a cluster of storage space, which appears to be defective. The sector won’t respond to read or write requests.  Bad sectors can happen on both hard drives and SSD’s. Bad sectors can happen from physical damage that can’t be repaired, and software errors that can be repaired.\nReallocated sector is when your hard drive finds a bad sector, and swaps it with one of the reserved sectors set in the drive at time of manufacturing for such instances.   Once a sector is swapped, the drive would report that the drive is free of bad sectors to the OS.   Keep in mind that there are a certain set number of reserved sectors, and once that number is used, then it’s probably time to replace the drive.\n", "Q: How to get xgterm I have installed scisoft version 7.5. \nI need to run iraf in the scisoft from xgterm.

However - with all disk operations there is always the possibility of failure and that should always be weighed during resizing.\nMake sure you have nothing mounted to the drives you're attempting to resize, ensure that you have ample CPU and RAM to perform the operations. If you're on a Laptop make sure it's plugged in and that it won't suspend or hibernate while performing these operations. Lastly this can be time intensive - my last tip is, while gparted is running it may appear unresponsive or frozen.

(Same as WUBI)\nI have done: sudo losetup /dev/loop1 /mnt/<disk file location>/root.disk.\nI can now see that .disk file using disk utility and it has a ext4 filesystem.\nHow can I add this disk (and a swap .disk file) to the Ubuntu Installer so I can install Ubuntu into the .disk files.\n\nA: Wubi uses two distinct techniques. The disk image technique downloads a preinstalled disk image file that has been compressed. Then it uncompresses this as the root.disk and then uses resize2fs to make it whatever size you want. Then it remains to create the user account at login which it does with a preseed file:\nd-i clock-setup/utc boolean false\nd-i time/zone string $(timezone)\nd-i passwd/user-fullname string $(user_full_name)\nd-i passwd/username string $(username)\nd-i passwd/user-password-crypted password $(password)\nd-i user-setup/encrypt-home boolean false\nd-i netcfg/get_hostname string ubuntu\nd-i debian-installer/locale string $(locale)\nd-i keyboard-configuration/layoutcode string $(keyboard_layout)\nd-i keyboard-configuration/variantcode string $(keyboard_variant)\n\nAll the $(xxx) are replaced by the Wubi installer - most are fairly straightforward, but my attempts to get the password correct failed (easily reset later).\nThen it remains to boot the install with the preseed file:\nloopback loop0 /ubuntu/disks/root.disk\nset root=(loop0)\nsearch --set=diskroot -f -n /ubuntu/disks/root.disk\nprobe --set=diskuuid -u $diskroot\nlinux /vmlinuz root=UUID=$diskuuid loop=/ubuntu/disks/root.disk preseed/file=/ubuntu/install/preseed.cfg wubi-diskimage ro quiet splash\ninitrd /initrd.img\n\nAnyway that's the easiest way to get Wubi manually installed. I recently did it on a Virtual machine running EFI firmware.\nThe other technique is to get ubiquity (the desktop installer) to install directly to the root.disk. This requires a preseed file as well. Wubi kicks off the installer via grub4dos, then uses the kernel extracted from the ISO to boot the ISO (which has been saved to disk). Then it preseeds the installer. This is a lot more complex than using the pre-installed disk image.\n", "Q: How to solve the phpmyadmin not found issue after upgrading php and apache? Recently I have install the PHP, Apache, MySQL, phpMyAdmin, python in my Ubuntu Desktop 12.04.3 LTS to use it as a LAMP server.

The LAMP server runs great. Then i thought to upgrade the whole LAMP server I mean the PHP, Apahce, MySQL, phpMyAdmin etc. Then I searched in google and get some ppa which got the latest versions of these softwares. Then I added those ppa. The ppa links:\n1. https://launchpad.net/~tuxpoldo/+archive/phpmyadmin\n2. https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/mysql-5.6\n3. https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/apache2\n4. https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/php5\n\nThen is used these ppa and firstly upgraded the phpmyadmin then MySQL server then Apache and then PHP.\nAfter upgradation of phpmyadmin and mysql server the whole LAMP server runs well with the updated mysql server and phpmyadmin.

Please help me as fast as you can. I am in great trouble for this.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Most probably your apache doesn't load the configuration of the phpmyadmin part.\nThe link you made from /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf to /etc/apache2/conf.d/phpmyadmin.conf may not be valid anymore after the update. Make this link again, but notice the names may be different. After that, restart apache.\n\nA: Usually this is an issue after a vanilla install in 16.04, 18.04 and 20.04 (Focal Fossa) and higher too.\nTo fix it:\nsudo ln -s /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf /etc/apache2/conf-available/phpmyadmin.conf\nsudo a2enconf phpmyadmin.conf\nsudo systemctl restart apache2\n\n\nA: Create a link in /var/www like this: \nsudo ln -s /usr/share/phpmyadmin /var/www/ \nNote: since 14.04 you may want to use /var/www/html/ instead of /var/www/\nIf that's not working for you, you need to include PHPMyAdmin inside apache configuration. \nOpen apache.conf using your favorite editor, mine is vim :)\nsudo vim /etc/apache2/apache2.conf\nThen add the following line: \nInclude /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf \nFor Ubuntu 15.04 and 16.04 \n\n\n*\n\n*sudo ln -s /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf /etc/apache2/conf-available/phpmyadmin.conf\n\n*sudo a2enconf phpmyadmin.conf\n\n*sudo service apache2 reload\n\nA: you can also install this by manual process.\njust download file to your web root folder.(/var/www/phpmyadmin)\nfor more Click Here\nDownload from here \n\nA: Here is another alternative way to do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add to /etc/apache2/apache2.conf this \"Include conf.d/*.conf\" if it is not already there.\n\n*Next execute those two commands:\nsudo ln -s /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf /etc/apache2/conf.d/phpmyadmin.conf\nsudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload\n\nIt should be working.\nNOTE: Depends on which Linux flavour you are using.

Mostly the answer by Luis Alvarado.\nAnd to add on all the current answers here, I would like to add 1 more reason that I keep having with the Firefox beta PPA. (Though the other answers here are most likely the correct solution for you)\nWhen trying to upgrade a package by adding a new PPA, if the package doesn't get upgraded you can check on launchpad to make sure there is a successful build that is available for your version of the OS.\nFor example I have added the PPA for Firefox beta.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mozillateam/firefox-next\n\nMy system is Ubuntu 13.10 x64. So checking the PPA on launchpad (https://launchpad.net/~mozillateam/+archive/firefox-next/+packages), it seems that, currently, the build for that specific Ubuntu version on the 64 bit architecture failed. Thus the package did not get upgraded and I got stuck with the release version of Firefox instead of the beta version.\n\nAs long as the PPA is on launchpad, you can always do this check.\nIn your case, you need to check https://launchpad.net/~yorba/+archive/ppa/+packages.\nCurrently there doesn't seem to be any failed build, but this answer can be helpful for future & similar problems.\n", "Q: How to make php files by which MySQL, PHP, phpmyadmin, Apache, Python etc. details will show? How can I make a php files which will show the details of PHP, Apahce, MySQL, phpMyAdmin, Python and Ubuntu system usage and information.\n\nA: PHP see http://php.net/phpinfo for examples. Basically put ... \n<?php\n\n// Show all information, defaults to INFO_ALL\nphpinfo();\n\n?>\n\nin a file inside your document directory and name it phpinfo.html and you can access that file from your browser when apache is running.\n\nApache\n\nI would advice to use the apache module mod_status\n\nThere is also mod_status built into Apache web server to get server\n  status from a web browser. With this module you can easily find out\n  how well your server is preforming. All reports are generated in a\n  html format. You can easily find out following type of information:\nTotal number of worker serving requests\nTotal number of of idle worker\nFind the status of each worker, the number of requests that worker has performed and the total number of bytes served by the worker\nTotal number byte count served\nOther information such as CPU usage, number of requests per second,current hosts and requests being processed etc.\n\n\nSo this can be done by setting up apache. Example. \nMysql has a command mysqladmin -u root -p status to show various settings but there is no modules for this to show that in a browser. The same goes for Python. Probably because of security concerns that this is not available.\nIf you need more things you need to elaborate on the \"etc\". \n", "Q: How do I Share a Wired DSL Connection as a hotspot?

After having done that, restart the system to see gdm in effect using command:\nsudo reboot\n\n\nBut if want lightdm back, open a terminal and enter:\n\nsudo apt-get install lightdm\n\nThen go to a tty (press ctrl + alt + F1) and enter the following:\nsudo stop gdm\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm\n\nand choose lightdm to be your default display manager. Restart the system with:\nsudo reboot\n\n\nA: I had this problem, and I pulled out the shotgun. I had another sudo enabled account that I logged into. I found that I could 'su' to the affected account, so terminal mode was fine. BUT, I wanted it fixed now, so:\nI moved all files out of the home directory of the bad account to /home/store (store was JUST a directory, NOT a home directory for a user). \nMake sure to do TWO 'mv' commands. 1} sudo mv /home/bad_account/* /home/store, and 2) sudo mv /home/bad_account/.* /home/store.\nWas on Ubuntu, so I then ran sudo deluser bad_account\nThen sudo adduser bad_account\nThen sudo mv /home/store/* /home/bad_account, and sudo mv /home/store/.*\nThen finally sudo chown -R bad_account:bad_account /home/bad_account\nbad_account == good_account now.\n\nA: A lot of people call out permissions on .Xauthority as being the culprit here, but it can be other files, too. I had this problem, and fixing .Xauthority was not enough.\nLogin as the user (Ctrl-Alt-F1), then do:\ncd ~\n\nsudo chown -R username:username .* *\n\n(note: including .* since * won't pick up hidden files)\nIf that doesn't work, I think you can safely rule out your manifestation of this issue as being permissions-based.\nAnother thing to try is logging in as a guest. If that doesn't work, nothing you do to a user's home directory will make any difference.\n\nA: Press CTRL+ALT+F1 and log in there and run:\n$ sudo chmod 1777 /tmp\n\n$ sudo chown root.root /tmp\n\nThen press CTRL+ALT+F7 then try to login using GUI.\nSome times this happen of you dont have proper permissions on /tmp\n", "Q: Lost all my data on the harddisk I have windows 8 before installing ubuntu 13.04 on my lenovo z580 laptop.

Now I want the guys in our network to be able to type my ip/site and view what Ive been working on. I have set up virtual hosts on my server to run this site. At the moment if I connect my cell to the network and type my ip I see the default apache \"It works\" but if I do ip/site I get a not found. I not much of a system guy so I would appreciate any help.\n\nA: The requesting machines have to ask for the virtual hosts by name as part of the request for apache to know which site to serve up.\nIf the virtual host names are not actual hostnames that can be resolved by DNS, then you'll need to add these names to the client machines \"hosts\" file or equivalent.\nFor example your server maybe has 192.168.1.17 as and IP and you've set up a few virtual hosts in apache on it and called them \"testsite\" and \"experiment.whatever.tld\".\nJust using the ip with no hostname in the request (by typing into browser for example) apache will serve  the first virtual host it finds.\nBut it sounds like you maybe are not actually using virtual hosts? The files you want to show are in for example /var/www/somecoolsite/index.html ? You may need to make sure to include the trailing slash in the url: http: //ipaddress/somecoolsite/ unless you have apache configured to add it it by default as needed.\n\nA: The Document Root for Apache Web Server by default is /var/www. When you type your machine's network IP address it is directed to the index.html (default page) in the document root directory. But for IP/site you'll need a directory named site in the /var/www. Try this:\nsudo mkdir /var/www/site\nsudo touch /var/www/site/testFile.txt\n\nNow try entering IP/site; you should get a page with header Index of /site and your testFile.txt indexed under it.\n", "Q: Deepin Game Center on Saucy?

So test it out:\nFirst run in a terminal:\ntail -f ~/.xsession-errors\n\nThis will open .xsession-erros in a \"live\" mode, showing everything what is newly written to it. Then launch a browser and open a flash video (e.g. youtube, but not in HTM5 mode). If then the error message pops up in your terminal then flash is causing your problem. So just right click on the video -> select Settings... and uncheck Enable hardware acceleration. If it wasn't flash, then try opening other graphical apps which you use regularly and watch if the error pops up in your terminal, then turn off hardware acceleration in that app. \n", "Q: Unable to boot Ubuntu after power failure The battery in my laptop became dislodged, and when I turned my laptop back on and tried to boot ubuntu I was faced with this:\nmount: mounting /dev on /root/dev failed: No such file or directory\nmount: mounting /proc on /root/proc failed: No such file or directory\nTarget filesystem doesn't have /sbin/init.\nNo init found.

Dear fellow Ubuntu users, for two years now I've been using Ubuntu. Although I love the system, it's quality is going downhill, steeply. Every new update (12.10, 13.04, 13.10) the issues only seem to get worse. Now my system laggs every other minute (freezes for a couple of seconds) and is unresponsive at times. Firefox, for example, seems to crash every 10 minutes (but only for a few seconds where a grey zone overlays the whole browser window).\nI figured my issues could be due to Unity failing as I found many people on the internet with the same conclusion so I exchanged Unity for Gnome only to discover that it didn't fix anything (it actually added to the problem).\nA second guess would have been a malfunctioning or slow HDD, running a benchmark yielded following results:\n/dev/sda:\n Timing cached reads:     2 MB in  6.42 seconds = 319.19 kB/sec\n Timing buffered disk reads:   2 MB in  4.38 seconds = 467.79 kB/sec\n\nWhich is extremely strange since I wouldn't expect cashed reading to be slower than buffered reading.\nSo having said this, can anyone tell met whether I should be on the lookout for a new HDD or whether my OS is in fact failing?\nWorking for school has been extremely annoying with a laggy system like this and I desperately need a fix here. What I have tried/done:\n\n\n*\n\n*HDD benchmark\n\n*installing GNOME rather than Unity\n\n*Reinstall every Ubuntu OS from 12.04 to 13.10,\n\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Are you sure it's not a memory issue?

I'm hoping someone here can help me understand how Ubuntu 12.04.3 scans the SCSI bus periodically.\nI've enabled SCSI logging via this command:\nscsi_logging_level -E 3 -S 3 -M 2\n\nWhen I plug in my BlackBerry 9800, I see the following set of messages periodically (charge mode, not UMASS mode):\n[102356.446327] sd 32:0:0:1: Done: SUCCESS\n[102356.446331] sd 32:0:0:1:  Result: hostbyte=DID_OK driverbyte=DRIVER_OK\n[102356.446335] sd 32:0:0:1: CDB: Test Unit Ready: 00 20 00 00 00 00\n[102356.446343] sd 32:0:0:1:  Sense Key : Not Ready [current] \n[102356.446347] sd 32:0:0:1:  Add.

Sense: Medium not present\n\nFinally, when I switch to UMASS mode, the medium is detected as present and the corresponding sd device nodes are created.\nEverything is working as expected, but I would like to understand this functionality. So, what is triggering the periodic scan of the bus? Is there service somewhere which triggers this, or is this done directly by the kernel?\nUpdate I\nThe messages are definitely coming from the kernel, so I believe that the kernel is responsible for the scanning of the SCSI devices. However, it's still not clear to me as to what is triggering the periodic rescan of my BlackBerry device.\n\nA: Okay. I finally figured this out.\nThe polling is handled by the kernel directly. It does not happen in the SCSI layer as I originally thought, but it's handled at the block device layer. This was added several kernel versions ago, however it is disabled by default in kernel.org source.\nYou can change the default polling interval with the following command (you must be root):\necho 2000 > /sys/module/block/parameters/events_dfl_poll_msecs\n\nor the sudo friendly version:\necho 2000 | sudo tee -a /sys/module/block/parameters/events_dfl_poll_msecs\n\nI assume that during the Ubuntu init, this is set, or maybe they directly patch the kernel.org source with their own default value.\n", "Q: What is the newest version of PHP/MySQL for Ubuntu 10.04?

I've searched high and low for an answer to this and haven't been able to find one, so hopefully someone here can help. \nI was working on an essay and had made substantial progress but had to take a break, so I saved it, closed Libreoffice Writer and walked away.  When I came back to start work again and opened Libreoffice Writer, it said that the document hadn't been saved and offered me a chance to recover it, which naturally and unthinkingly I took.  However, the document it so helpfully restored (and also overwrote my newer version with) was in fact a previous version, so at the moment it looks like I've lost several days' worth of work.  \nI've checked Ubuntu One, but it only has the updated version.  I can't click 'versions' in the file menu of libreoffice.  I've followed the instructions on this thread but with no joy (there was nothing in the folder): http://ask.libreoffice.org/en/question/6652/how-to-recover-former-version-of-document/\nIf anyone has any suggestions, I'd be enormously grateful, because at the moment I'm despairing slightly.  \nThanks in advance. \n\nA: It's probably too late for that but you could try running a file recovery program like PhotoRec on the partition the doc was saved on. \nThis will only work on the off-chance that the updated revision isn't occupying the same file system block as the old one. Make sure to use your partition as little as possible until the file recovery is complete. Every additional disk write holds the risk of overwriting the file you are searching for.\nAlso, PhotoRec has no way of discovering what your files used to be called. After running the file recovery you might have to go through a long list of documents to find the right file and revision. Here are some pointers on how you can make this process easier.\nAnother note: This should not happen and it's very unfortunate that it did. After all of this is done you should consider reporting a bug on LO's bug tracker (and maybe link it by editing your question). This is severe enough to warrant immediate attention.\n\nA: When you see the recovered document is a very old version, don't save it. Do a Save As and give it a unique name.\nThen open the original document again and this time don't select the recover option. Hopefully it is more recent. Do Save As a different unique name. \nNext search with google on if other recovery options are available. You now have 3 copies of the file:\nOriginal unrecovered version\nRecovered version from first step\nError free saved version of unrecovered version from second step.\nWhen things go wrong-- save... Save... SAVE!!!!!\n", "Q: Do I need BIOS or UEFI installation? I have a new Asus Zenbook here, and honestly I don't know exactly the model and if it has BIOS or UEFI. When I go into BIOS before booting, I see nothing that says UEFI, and it looks pretty much like my BIOS on my old PCs.\nThere is already a Windows 7 installed.\nHow can I find out if I need to install Grub / Grub2 in BIOS or UEFI mode?\n\nA: The main question is do you need UEFI? If you don't or don't plan too or just don't know, either, install it as is or deactivate it. There isn't a real \"reason\" why you should select one or another that goes beyond of what you prefer. Each method has advantage and disadvantages but either way the decision is yours at the end and since you are not interested in dual boot, may as well not do it.\nPersonally, I don't use UEFI as I don't have a UEFI capable system, if you have one and you don't foresee any troubles, maybe do the jump and use UEFI all the way.\n\nA: See this page for information on determining your hardware's capabilities and your Windows boot mode. (In brief, if your disk uses MBR partitions, Windows is booting in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode; if the disk uses GPT, then Windows is booting in EFI mode.) You should match your Linux boot mode to your Windows boot mode; if you don't, you risk creating complications for yourself.

I am not so sure about how/if Windows will see hda3. The safe way would be to use gparted from a live System to move that partition so that is is adjacent to hda2.\nAfter that you can create a regular installation.\n\nA: It is safe to create that partition between the others.(More exactly it is no more riskier than creating a partition anywhere on the disk.)\nThe names of the partitions in your final linux install possibly will be different than what is shown now.

You can see this with the command df. For example: \n(0)samsung-romano:~% sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/tmp \n(0)samsung-romano:~% df -h\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n[...]\n/dev/sda6       480G  192G  265G  42% /home\n/dev/sda2       3.7G   30M  3.5G   1% /mnt/tmp\n\nLook --- the sda2 partition has 30M used. Now if I copy a large file (around 1.9G) under /mnt/tmp:\n (0)samsung-romano:~% sudo cp tmp/00032.MTS /mnt/tmp \n\nThen I have: \n(0)samsung-romano:~% df -h | grep sda \n/dev/sda1        88G   11G   74G  13% /\n/dev/sda6       480G  192G  265G  42% /home\n/dev/sda2       3.7G  1.9G  1.6G  55% /mnt/tmp\n\nSee? The big file is now on the other disk. If I u(n)mount the disk, now, the bigfile will be invisible. \nLook: \n(0)samsung-romano:~% ls -l /mnt/tmp/*.MTS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2006482944 Dec  6 21:24 /mnt/tmp/00032.MTS\n(0)samsung-romano:~% sudo umount /mnt/tmp\n(0)samsung-romano:~% ls -l /mnt/tmp\ntotal 0\n\nNotice: I had to use sudo here because the permission of the mounted disk. You should use a bit more complex command to mount the disk and make it available to write to it as a normal user --- but that would be another question (probably already answered somewhere). \n", "Q: can't ssh using l2tp-ipsec-vpn on 13.10 I am connecting to my office using l2tp-ipsec-vpn v 1.0.9 on Ubuntu 13.10.

It pops up on screen, but when I try to format the partition this error pops up (/dev/sdc is mounted). When I try to check the file system this error shows up (Device is mounted and no online capability in fsck tool for file system). I have unmounted, and mounted properly several times, but still nothing. When I run the Smart Data test this is what fails (ERROR ID 197). I am really hoping to get some help with this, and any help given would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: If you're getting a SMART warning with pending sectors (ERROR ID 197), it means that your disk can't reallocate sectors correctly. Read errors on a sector will not remap the sector immediately, and the disk will probably fail anytime.\nNote: I would recommend that you backup your data off the drive, if you have any, just to be on the safe side.  Also you may want to test the drive with Seagate's bootable utility, to verify if the drive needs replacement.\n", "Q: Can't Ping External Network on Ubuntu I installed BIND on Ubuntu and nslookup is successful, pinging my hostname is successful, but pinging an external site (i.e. www.google.com) does not work. \nI receive the error message: ping: unknown host www.website.com\nAny ideas why I can't ping an external network?

In this specific instance I have mostly only found vague descriptions like \n\nInstalling this package will pull in support for MP3 playback and decoding, support for various other audio formats (GStreamer plugins), Microsoft fonts, Java runtime environment, Flash plugin, LAME (to create compressed audio files), and DVD playback. \n\nfrom http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/ubuntu-restricted-extras \napt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras tells me that I am installing one package: ubuntu-restricted-extras.\nEspecially in this case, I'd like to know what I'm putting on my computer and what agreements I am tacitly agreeing to by doing so. I'd also sort of like to know what the difference between the various *ubuntu-restricted-extras packages are. \n\nA: The ubuntu-restricted-extras has the following:\nflashplugin-installer\ngstreamer0.10-ffmpeg\ngstreamer0.10-fluendo-mp3\ngstreamer0.10-pitfdll\ngstreamer0.10-plugins-bad\ngstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly\ngstreamer0.10-plugins-bad-multiverse\ngstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly-multiverse\nicedtea6-plugin\nlibavcodec-extra-52\nlibmp4v2-0\nttf-mscorefonts-installer\nunrar\n\nDue to the legal status of the software included in ubuntu-restricted-extras, the package is not included by default in Ubuntu.\nYou may also take a look at Ubuntu Packages\n\nA: Use this\napt-cache show <package name> | grep Depends:\napt-cache show <package name> | grep Recommends:\n\nor\napt-cache depends <package name>\n\nYou can use this for see specific packages to be installed in your system:\n $ apt-get install -s <package name> | grep Inst | cut -d \" \" -f 2\n\n", "Q: My graphic card overloads when i use flash player When I just use my laptop normally everything works just fine. \nBut as soon as I watch a youtube video or anything else that uses flash player in firefox my laptop starts to sound very loud. I have checked my CPU performance when this happens and my CPU is not at more then 10-20% (intel i5 quad). As soon as I pause or close youtube/flash my laptop isnt so loud anymore. \nI figured this might have to do with the graphic card and I wanted to know if there is any tests I can run to see how my graphic card is behaving when I'm using flash player. \nWhen I run System testing I get this:\nOpenGL vendor string: ATI Technologies Inc. OpenGL renderer string: AMD Radeon HD 6400M Series OpenGL version string: 4.2.12337 Compatibility Profile Context 13.101 Not software rendered: yes Not blacklisted: yes GLX fbconfig: yes GLX texture from pixmap: yes GL npot or rect textures: yes Compiz supported: yes\n\nBecause I use flash player a lot I'm quite concerned about how my laptop is behaving. I run ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\nHow to fix this issue ?\n\nA: I more or less ran into the same issues on an old (outdated) PC*: CPU started to work really hard and Youtube videos became choppy when played at fullscreen - HD videos even in a small screen. I eventually discovered that copy-pasting the URL from a Youtube video into VLC Player (use CTRL-N, then paste), virtually eliminated all choppiness and gave me smooth fullscreen videos. Not a perfect solution, but might be an acceptable work-around for some.. Btw DVD-video is also normal when I play it in VLC-player.\nAs a side-note, I also noticed that most videos played smoother on the Youtube site when I was using a Ubuntu live-USB (although I did get pop-ups about flash not being installed just before the video started playing).\n*Pentium IV 2,8 GHz, about 1,7 Gb of ram, HP Compaq D330, Graphics card: Ati radeon 9200PRO - so I suppose it could be a mix of old hardware, bad drivers and imperfect browser-plugins. Btw I experienced the same issue in a whole bunch of Ubuntu flavours and Mint, but Lubuntu still performed best (because of the low system load).\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 Volume up down mute stopped working I'm using a Lenovo SL500 for several years now and suddenly the Volume keys\nstopped working. It could be that a kernel updated caused it - I don't know.\nHowever when I go to the keyboard settings -> Shortcuts -> Sound and Media, I can set e.g. Volume Mute with my multimedia key and then it says \"AudioMute\". But when I later hit the Volume Mute key nothing happens.\n\nA: I found a solution: deleting ~/.pulse then logout. Next time it happens I will try the other answer too.\n\nA: I had the same issue on 15.04\nThere was no .pulse but there was .pulse-cookie.

Sorry if there are a lot of similar question to this but the answers I found from others differ from one another. Anyway, I'm running a dual boot of Windows 8 and Ubuntu 13.10.\nMy problem is whenever I boot to Ubuntu, my laptop's battery gets drained rather quickly compared to when I boot Windows. I also noticed excessive air blowing from the side vents of my laptop whenever I'm on Ubuntu. Also, if it's worth mentioning, my laptop is a Lenovo G505s.\nAfter doing research, I found out about these:\n\n\n*\n\n*Laptop mode - I read that it is not needed in 13.10 but I also read from other guides that I need to install it?\n\n*TLP - Must not be installed with Laptop mode. Is this a good power management tool?\n\n*Jupiter - Do I need this as well?\n\n*I installed powertop but I don't know how to use it. Please help with this. Here's the report (I think this is the relevant one): Link\n\n*I also did the necessary tidbits like lowering brightness, only using WiFi when I need it, etc.\nAny other suggestions would be extremely helpful. Thank you in advance.\n\nA: You can use either laptop-mode-tools (which come pre-installed) or TLP, but not both at the same time. There is no big practical difference between the two, the consensus appears to be that TLP is somewhat more advanced, while laptop-mode-tools is somewhat more stable.\nYou can use powertop (sudo powertop) to see your biggest energy consumers, and to check (under \"Tunables\") if laptop-mode-tools/TLP are working properly - most parameters are supposed to switch to \"Good\" once the laptop is unplugged. Sample:\n\nSome minor parameters (like VM writeback timeout, swappiness etc.) which are not auto-adjusted can be adjusted manually. Google will help you to find out how.\nHowever, if your laptop has AMD/Nvidia graphics, power drainage is probably caused by the opensource X graphic driver. In which case, as much as we all like opensource, you have no option but to install proprietary video drivers (fglrx/bumblebee respectively). You will easily find the how-to's on the web.\n\nA: I'am not linux expert but it seems to be a video card problem. Try to install the correct driver and the vents should stop and your battery would drain slower (but not even close to windows)\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 slowing down due to X taking 50-100% of CPU I have strange issue. I use my PC mostly to run some Java app, execute some command line, watch movies and use browser (Chromium), eg. to watch YouTube, play some Flash games and read. Not much more.\nSome time ago I spotted some issue with one of the processes taking a lot of CPU and causing low frame rate (2-4FPS or similar, even though the sound is okay) until I restart my machine. The command is as follows, when viewed using htop:\n/usr/bin/X :0 -background none -verbose -auth  /var/run/gdm/auth-for-gdm-EirVFF/database -nolisten tcp vt7\n\nFrom https://askubuntu.com/a/179795/18697 it looks like that may have been caused by bad driver or some extra features taking too much processing speed.\nFrom Settings->Details->Graphics I know, that the driver setup is \"Intel® Sandybridge Mobile\", but I have not found the ability to change that, nor I found any other settings (eg. related to Compiz). According to my PC specs, the card I have is NVidia GT520MX.\nI could mess with various configuration files, try to install various external libraries, but I think there is some standard way to deal with that.\nHow can I fix this problem, so X stops taking so much CPU and the PC works faster?\nUpdate:\nI applied tips listed here, which came down to typing the following commands:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current nvidia-settings\n\nBut when I run sudo nvidia-settings, I see the following message:\n\nYou do not appear to be using the NVIDIA X driver.  Please edit your X configuration file (just run `nvidia-xconfig` as root), and restart the X server.\n\nThe problem is, that nvidia-xconfig is not found in my system, and installing nvidia-current does not change it.\nAny additional clues?\n\nA: I think the nVidia driver you reference is a kernel module.  This means you have to unload and \"blacklist\" nouveau (or any other such kernel video driver).  The installation of the nvidia proprietary driver usually does this by making modprobe configuration entries.  But unless you're very familiar with how these drivers work (as in, bind to the text console), and you can poke around in /sys to deactivate them, you'll have to reboot.  That will basically \"purge\" nouveau and allow nvidia to take effect.  Then nvidia-settings can use its proprietary protocol(s) to manipulate the nvidia kernel module.\n", "Q: unity-service-panel.log taking 18+ GB Im having strange unity-service-panel.log file behavior in Ubuntu 13.10., which in 5-6 days filled up to 18.5 GB worth of space.

How to copy wine in pendrive and how to install it on other computer without internet connection? I want to install it on my friend's pc... \n\nA: Just download the .deb files.  You can get them Here.  Once downloaded, you can save them to your pendrive.\nYou might also want to download winetricks.\nYou can also use synaptic, to generate a package download script.  If synaptic is not installed, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo apt-get install synaptic\n\nOnce installed, run it, enter your password, and follow the screens below:\nSearch for Wine\n\nRight click on the latest wine version, and click on Mark for Installation\n\nThis will mark wine, and all necessary dependencies, and get everything ready for installation.\n\nClick on File, and choose Generate Package Download Script, and then save it to a location of your choice.\n\nNavigate to where you've saved the file, and double click it, and then click on Run in Terminal.  This will start downloading all the files to the same folder.  Once all the files have been downloaded, go to terminal, and run the command:\nSudo dpkg -i *.deb\n\n\n\nA: To download the package files you can go to either PPA or by searching Ubuntu package list, the first option will get the most up-to-date version, while the latter will give you the default one. It is up to you which option you will go with.\nNote that you will need to download dependencies to the packages as well as the packages themselves, since your friend will have no way to get them oneself.\nOnce you have brought those packages to your friend's computer and placed them in some directory, go to that dir in the terminal and type:\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb\n\nThis will install these packages (if everything is working).\nAlso, if you are planning to often perform such off-line installation process, you may wish to install apt-offline, which will then be able to generate on your friend's computer the signature of all the files to download, and then you can grab them on yours.\nOf course, the initial install of apt-offline will need to be via the option discussed above.\n\nA: You can use Cube in downloading wine packages in computer with internet connection and install it to an offline computer in later use.\nRun cube in your friend's pc, then transfer the whole cube to a USB. Find a computer with internet connection and download wine on that (Windows or Linux). Then go back to the original computer to install downloaded packages.\nYou can download Cube and full tutorial at Cube Launchpad Page\n\n\n", "Q: Is there a compressed memory available for 12.04?

I didn't want to change the /root/.smb/smbnetfs.conf file because there's different users in need to map this share.\n\nA: In the Files section of the smbnetfs man page, it says:\n\nPlease  create configuration directory ~/.smb.  This directory should contain at least two files: smb.conf and smbnetfs.conf. You may copy smb.conf from the /etc/samba directory. You can find a sample of smbnetfs.conf in the /etc directory.\n\nIf this works as advertised, you should be able to bypass the root conf file there.\n\nA: Actually the documentation on smbnetfs states that it reads ${HOME}/.smb for the user who issued the mount command and since vmassuchetto making mount through fstab, that user will be root.\nThere is however a solution:\nIn /root/.smb/smbnetfs.conf is a string:\n#read auth data from ~/.smb/smbnetfs.auth\ninclude                    \"smbnetfs.auth\"\n\nIf memory serves me well, by default this should be commented out.\nIf path to smbnetfs.auth isn't provided, as is in above example, smbnet fs will look for it in ~/.smb/.\nSo you can place smbnetfs.auth anywhere on file system and with any permissions to provide the user the way to edit it.\nI'd suggest vmassuchetto to uncomment this and create a file /root/.smb/smbnetfs.auth with flowing content:\nauth USER_NAME \"USER_PASSWORD\"\nauth WORKGROUP USER_NAME \"USER_PASSWORD\"\nauth COMPUTER_NAME USER_NAME \"USER_PASSWORD\"\nauth COMPUTER_NAME/SHARE_NAME USER_NAME \"USER_PASSWORD\"\n\nFirst line will instruct smbnetfs how to handle all not specifically mentioned computers.\nSecond line will instruct smbnetfs how to handle all computers from workgroup and/or domain with that name.\nThird line will provide credentials for specific computer and forth is for a share on a specific computer.\nAll strings should start with word auth for credentials or with # for comments.\nAll parameters can be encased in \" to shield special symbols, same way as \"USER_PASSWORD\" in example above.\nParameter USER_NAME can be specified with leading domain name or workgroup: DOMAIN_OR_WORKGROUP/USER_NAME\nAnd as last resort you can always use this command:\ncd /media/network/DOMAIN_OR_WORKGROUP:USER_NAME:USER_PASSWORD@COMPUTER_NAME\n\n", "Q: No new release found for Ubuntu 13.04 I tried to upgrade ubuntu with do-release-upgrade command.

Does ubuntu allow users to run ESET Smart Security? I am considering upgrading ubuntu from Windows 7 but I'm not sure if it allows the use of outside security programs.\n\nA: I assume you are talking about the Windows version of ESet Smart Security. The first thing to consider is that ESET smart security is made to run on windows. Software made for one OS generally doesn't run on other OS.\nBut there is an exception. A software compatability layer called Wine has been written for linux which allows you to run Windows software in linux. You can run many windows software & games using it. However not all windows software works.\nAntiviruses, firewalls and sandbox software don't generally run well under wine. Trust me I've tried.\nHowever you can use antiviruses made for linux. ESET has http://www.eset.co.uk/Home/NOD32-Antivirus-Linux . There are also Comodo for linux and Bitdefender.\nThere is also the free \"Clam TK\".\nImp: You don't have to remove Windows 7 to install Ubuntu. You can dual boot them.\nNote: Also linux IMHO doesn't need an antivirus. Not many viruses have been made for linux and also linux has a more secure environment. Linux malware are extremely rare.\n\nA: For most Linux distributions you do not need anti-virus software - but you can get Linux ones, like ClamAV, which will run on Ubuntu.\nThere is a page on the eset site - http://www.eset.co.uk/Home/NOD32-Antivirus-Linux - which says it will run on Linux, but I don't know how.\nYou don't really need to have anitvirus software for Ubuntu and other Linux systems, as it has so little market share against other systems like Windows and Mac OS, meaning that virus writers would not gain much from them.\n\nAlso, Linux is much better security wise than systems like Windows, which seems to have the security holes built in. Viruses, and other forms of malware can still pose a threat, the same with all computer systems, but not as much as would be posed to Windows or Mac. \nThere is this article which explains this some more.\n\nA: Lets put things clear:\n\n\n*\n\n*ESET Antivirus (the Windows version) wouldn't do any good in your Linux.\n\n*Linux has a poor compatibility with malware and a high security scheme by default, from the first moment you boot up, that makes it unlikely target for virus.\n\n*The only reason why using an antivirus in linux is to not allow spreading of malicious files to windows systems, that is, to help stop virus from infecting virus systems.\n\n*You can't (or is too difficult for being feasible) run a Realtime Windows Antivirus on Linux using Wine. Wine is just a compatibility layer meant to allow certain windows programs to run in linux, it won't make your system magically run windows applications as if it were native.\n\n\nBottom line:\nYou can have an antivirus in Linux, you must if you share files with Windows, you shouldn't install a Windows antivirus in Linux, you could be more at peace if you think things calmly.\n", "Q: 13.10's Text Entry Settings are missing some input methods in GNOME Flashback I added the input method \"Chinese (Pinyin)\" in \"Text Entry Settings\" while using Unity. However, when I now login with \"GNOME Flashback\" or \"GNOME with Xmonad\", \"Chinese (Pinyin)\" does no longer show up in the list of \"Input sources to use\". Also, it is not available in the list \"Select an input source to add\".\nWhen I log back into Unity, \"Chinese (Pinyin)\" appears again as if it had never been gone.\nWhy is that?\n(I can still switch between \"English (US)\" and \"Chinese (Pinyin)\" when not logged into Unity. However, the little overlay that shows the input candidates is missing when not using Unity, making Pinyin input useless. This issue may or may not be related.)\n\nA: The basic issue comes from the different ways that Unity and Gnome Flashback integrate input methods with Unity using Text Entry settings and ignoring ibus-setup, while Gnome Flashback still uses ibus-setup.\nFirst let me say that I'm using 14.04. In Unity, I can add pinyin through Text Entry. When I login with Gnome Flashback, pinyin is indeed not available from Text Entry as you say. But input method switching from the menubar indicator still shows pinyin and pinyin entry works fine.\nIf this is not the case for you in 13.10, you can add pinyin entry from Gnome Flashback, but it works a little differently. \nDon't use Text Entry. Rather, use ibus-setup in a terminal (the gui looks a little different that it used to, by the way). \nGo to the Input Method tab, click Select an Input Method, and scroll down to Show All Input Methods. You may need to click Select an Input Method again, but this time when you scroll down, you will see Chinese. When you highlight Chinese, pinyin and other input methods (depending on what you have installed) will popup on the right; but pinyin should be there by default. Choose the one you want.\nIn 13.10, integration of input switching into Text Entry and the use of the new version of ibus-setup was still something of a work in progress; so it's possible that you are experiencing a bug. But either following the above method with ibus-setup in Gnome Flashback or upgrading to 14.04 should provide a workaround for you.\n", "Q: MatLab installation from .iso problem I tried installing MatLab on Ubuntu 12.04 from an .iso, unsuccessfully. The .iso file is mounted, but when I go to the mounted folder and type ./install , I get this error message:\nError: Cannot locate Java Runtime Environment (JRE).\nThe directory /mnt/iso/sys/java/jre/glnx86/jre does not exist.\n\nThat seems pretty normal, since the directory glnx86 doesn't exist, but instead, in the install script, it seems like this should be exchanged with glnxa64, which does exist. I tried to modify the script in the install file and deleted the glnx86 values, retried to run the script, but then I get another error message:\nPreparing installation files ...\nInstalling ...\n/tmp/mathworks_11559/sys/java/jre/glnxa64/jre/bin/java: 1: /tmp/mathworks_11559/sys/java/jre/glnxa64/jre/bin/java: Syntax error: \"(\" unexpected\nFinished\n\nCan someone help me out of this, please?\n\nA: The last version of MatLab supported by a 32-bit Linux OS is the 2012a. All versions coming after this one can only be installed on a 64-bit Linux OS. I upgraded my OS to Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit, and installed the 2013a version of MatLab following the instructions that already exist in the forum. By the way, it looks that the fix for \"ia32-libs\" (mentioned as comment on my previous question) is only needed for older versions of MatLab, in my case there was no need to get the package. \n", "Q: Executable files on my computer cannot be executed and cannot be run by terminal I'm really new to ubuntu and linux, so everything has flown straight over my head, but this problem is obviously not normal. I've looked all over the place for a solution to this problem, but all the answers to related issues have not helped. \nThis is just the most recent example, but it applies to all executable programs. Programs do not run, and I receive this message when I do not allow to execute file as program:\n\nCould not display “starbound”.\nThere is no application installed for “executable” files.\n  Do you want to search for an application to open this file?\n\nWhen I go to the program's properties and check the box allowing it to run as a program, it simply does nothing.\nWhen I try to run the program through the terminal, it will not allow me. It even shows \"starbound\" in the ls display. This is the full terminal entry:\nroot@john-System-Product-Name:/home/john/Extracted_Games/Starbound/linux64# ls\nasset_packer      launch_starbound_server.sh  libGLEW.so.1.7  starbound.ico\nbootstrap.config  launch_starbound.sh         starbound       starbound_server\nroot@john-System-Product-Name:/home/john/Extracted_Games/Starbound/linux64# ./starbound\nbash: ./starbound: Permission denied\n\nIf anyone has a fix or possible explanation for this please respond.\n\nA: You have to make the file executable: Just right click on the file -> Properties -> Permissions -> check Allow executing file as program.\nOr from terminal:\nchmod u+x starbound\n\nUpdate: I missed that you wrote that even if you tried checking the box to allow the program to execute it did nothing. That is another problem that the program is not showing up. It can be a program error, error with your setup, or if it is a terminal app then it won't show up if you start it by double clicking it. I don't know what kind of program is this so I can't help until you give us some directions. But what you should try:\nchmod u+x starbound launch_starbound.sh launch_starbound_server.sh starbound_server\n\nSo we made all those files executable which based on their names should be executable. After this please try running launch_starbound.sh from terminal:\n./launch_starbound.sh\n\nDoes it report errors? Maybe the server thing should be started first? Try running launch_starbound_server.sh first from terminal. Does it report errors? \n\nA: Assuming I'm right in believing you have right clicked on the executable itself, went to properties, went to permissions, and checked \"Allow executing file as program\" and that didn't succeed\nSeems to me (upon looking at starbound and my best guess being it is a game) I feel you are trying to run a Microsoft Windows application under linux, which just isn't going to work.\nYou need to either use WINE to run windows executables or (I believe this game is available through steam) download steam for ubuntu, which I believe is even available through the ubuntu software center, and run the game from the steam client itself.\n", "Q: Why is there no option to download ubuntu using torrent?

Or the other way around?\n\nI need to recover some pictures and some documents from there...is there anything I can try?\n\nA: Though you can't mount it, you can read the filesystem with TestDisk and recover files from it.\nTestDisk Step-by-Step will help you through the process.\n", "Q: How to add the wildcard to any user or database using phpmyadmin? How can I add wildcard to any database and it's user using phpmyadmin so it will accept both connections from local and WAN?\n\nA: I would strongly caution what level of access you assign to databases and users without fully understanding the security implications of doing so!\nWhile granting users limited access to certain databases using wildcard hosts is generally okay and many times is necessary, granting unrestricted or high-level access opens your system to security exploits like SQL and PHP injection attacks.\n\nIn phpMyAdmin, click on the Users tab; find the user account you wish to edit and click on \"Edit Privileges\" link. In the dialog that opens, locate the \"Change Login Information / Copy User\" field. In the \"Host\" field, select \"Any\" from the pop-up menu or add % to the field - this sets the wildcard to allow that user access to the database from any IP or host.\nDatabase privileges are assigned per-user, per database. To give a user access to particular databases, you can assign them in the same dialog as above under the \"Database-specific privileges\" fields. A single user can have access to multiple databases with unique permissions on each database.\n", "Q: HP dv6 2020sa // battery?

You have to power off, take the battery out, and then put it right back in.  When you boot, it will charge, but as it runs down, near the end, you have to do this again. I dscovered this trick by accident; I was going to buy a new battery, so took the old one out to get a number off it.  I put it in, booted so I could use it, and it was charging.\nNew (Chinese) batteries are only a few dollars.  Even if yours isn't dead, it will be someday, so this isn't a bad thing to have on hand.\n", "Q: Converting into mpeg4 for cinelerra without quality loss Whilst I am mostly editing films in OpenShot, I am not sure it has quite caught up with cinelerra in terms of features. Plus the currently installed version of OpenShot is still a little buggy and crashes sometimes.\nHowever, I am having problems getting my footage into the correct format for cinelerra. I have the correct video codecs installed (mpeg-4), and I'm converting footage from various different camera devices into the quicktime container format with mpeg-4 video. However, the cinelerra documentation says it also wants mpeg-4 audio format which I believe is (als) when using avconv.\nI have some m2v files with no audio (back from when I was using a mac and final cut to make dvds), and we would like to re-edit these. So I want to use something like in shell script:\nfor f in *m2v; do avconv -i \"$f\" -c:a als -c:v mpeg4 \"${f/%m2v/mov}\"; done\n\nHowever if I call this the mov file produced has really poor quality (although both it and the source have 720x576x25), and if I look at its properties in Nautilus, it says that its video codec is 'ffodivx', and not mpeg-4.\nIs there anything I can do to convert these videos into format desired without the quality loss? Other files I've converted (from .dv and .mts) convert fine using the same method. So I presume the issue is in decoding the source rather than encoding the result. In Nautilus the source file says its video codec is FFMPEG2, bitrate 7519 Kb/s.\nThe result only has 556 Kb/s, maybe this is the problem?\n\nA: Okay, I'm not sure if this is the best way to do it or not, but I've managed to convert the video without quality loss by specifying the bitrate when calling avconv as so:\nfor f in *m2v; do avconv -i \"$f\" -b:v 8000k -c:a als -c:v mpeg4 \"${f/%m2v/mov}\"; done\n\n", "Q: GRUB not booting correctly after dual boot install I followed these instructions to dual boot windows 8 and ubuntu:\nInstalling Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI\nI was successfully able to install ubuntu.

You can do this risk-free by using the CD-R or USB flash drive image; prepare the medium and try it. If you can boot to both Linux and Windows, you can then install the Debian-package version under Ubuntu. rEFInd will then take over from GRUB as your primary boot manager. You may need to clean up unwanted boot options by deleting files from the /boot/efi/EFI directory tree in Linux or by using the dont_scan_dirs or dont_scan_files options in refind.conf; see the rEFInd documentation for details.\n", "Q: Can't detect realtek RTL8101E/RTL8102E ethernet controller I need some body give me insight in this issue:\ni have damn toshiba satlellite C850-A989 with ubuntu 13.10 installed, the wireless card work fine.

Together with a IP address it forms a TCP address.\nA port is called \"open\" if some program listening on that TCP address for incoming connections. It's called \"closed\" if there isn't any such program or the kernel is filtering away network packages for this address.\nBy default Ubuntu doesn't filter any network packages. So to open a port all you have to do is to start a program that listens on that port.\n", "Q: Error on installing eclipse from software center I have installed eclipse from the software center and when I open it I get the error that sayt to see a log file.

I heard Richard Stallman say that Ubuntu contains non-free blobs. Why does it have such blobs and what functions do these non-free blobs and system components do that free software can't? Does Canonical include these to keep control of Ubuntu project?\nAre there any distros that don't include such non-free firmware blobs by default?\n\nA: Check wikipedia:\n\nIn the context of open source software, a binary blob is a closed source binary-only driver without publicly available source code. The term usually refers to a closed-source kernel module loaded into the kernel of an open source operating system \n\nWhat do these do what free software can't? Nothing in theory. But in practice a hardware company doesn't want to release an open-source driver for their hardware, because it would give hints to their rivals about the hardware design. So e.g. Nvidia and AMD doesn't release open-source drivers. No problem, you might say, the community does it, we have the nouveau and radeon open-source drivers. Yes, but we all know that those drivers have quite a few problems e.g. with power management and hardware acceleration and some others. Why? Because only the hardware manufacturer knows the correct design of their hardware, the community can only guess about how the hardware works internally. So the problem is that until the hardware specifications are closed and kept in secret the community can't make proper open-source alternatives.\nDistros without such blobs? I don't know, but check out this and this page.\n\nA: Stallman is correct.  The Linux kernel includes several pieces of nonfree firmware for peripheral devices.  This firmware is not stored on the device; it must be copied to the device every time it boots.  Without the \"blobs,\" the device can't be used.  The advantage of downloading firmware to the device is that it allows updating the device by simply updating the firmware on the computer.\nThe problem with these \"blobs\" is that they are just that--a chunk of binary distributed by the manufacturer.  The knowledge to run the devices is often kept proprietary.  Richard Stallman and other free software advocates object to this because they are not provided the source code used to create the binaries.  Most distributions, including the official Linux kernel, still ship these blobs because they vastly improve compatibility with devices (there's not an open alternative to them), and because it's \"just\" firmware.\n(Side note: some people note that if you advocate for open firmware then you're only a couple steps away from advocating for open HDL diagrams for FPGAs, which would compromise companies' hardware intellectual property.  However, note that firmware can still be malicious; for example, cellular modem firmware has unrestricted network access and pretty broad access to the system as well.  That's one justification for the absolutist stance of \"no non-free software.\")\nThere are many distros that create \"truly libre\" Linux distributions.  One of the more popular ones is called Trisquel.  They're based on Ubuntu, and have a thorough deblobbing process.  The FSF uses this distro when they want to hand out Live CDs.  The one that I last heard of Stallman using is called GNewSense; it's based on Ubuntu and Debian.  Anything that the FSF endorses will be totally blob-free.\n\nA: \nDoes Canonical include these to keep control of Ubuntu project?\n\nI think this is demonstrably untrue. It is hardware that requires these blobs, and so it is the users who are in control of what hardware they purchase, not Canonical. If a user chooses to use only hardware that has free software drivers, then no blobs will be used.\nTherefore it isn't anything to do with Canonical \"keeping control\", since users have the choice of using Ubuntu without using any binary blobs. This means that Canonical have no specific control in this area that they could exert anyway.\nThe blobs are only shipped for the convenience of users who have already made a non-free hardware choice.\n(Disclosure: I work for Canonical. This answer reflects my own personal view; I cannot speak for my employer in this area.)\n", "Q: How can I configure nginx?

It also appears that I'm running named.\n# more /run/resolvconf/interface/eth0.dhclient\ndomain ec2.internal\nnameserver 172.16.0.23\n# more /run/resolvconf/interface/lo.named\nnameserver 127.0.0.1\n\n/etc/resolv.conf is a symlink to /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf\n more /etc/resolv.conf\n # Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)\n #     DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN\n nameserver 127.0.0.1\n search ec2.internal\n\nIf I edit resolv.conf to point to 172.16.0.23 instead of 127.0.0.1 it works correctly, but after reboot it changes back.\nAdditionally, here is the contents of /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d\n/etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d# more base\nnameserver 172.16.0.23\ndomain ec2.internal\nsearch ec2.internal\n\n/etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d# more head\n# Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)\n#     DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN\n\n/etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d# more original\nnameserver 172.16.0.23\ndomain ec2.internal\nsearch ec2.internal\n\n# more interface-order\n# interface-order(5)\nlo.inet*\nlo.dnsmasq\nlo.pdnsd\nlo.!(pdns|pdns-recursor)\nlo\ntun*\ntap*\nhso*\nem+([0-9])?(_+([0-9]))*\np+([0-9])p+([0-9])?(_+([0-9]))*\neth*\nath*\nwlan*\nppp*\n*\n\nThe config files seem to be setup correctly, but it keeps going back to 127.0.0.1.  I guess it wants to point to 127.0.0.1 so it can use the local named service, which seems like a really odd thing for Ubuntu to install and use by default.\nWhat am I doing wrong?  Is there a 'preferred' way of doing this, instead of messing with resolvconf should I get the local named service to resolve correctly?\n\nA: *\n\n*Make /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base empty. The information in it is provided dynamically by dhclient to resolvconf.\n\n*If you don't need to be running named locally, uninstall the bind9 package.\n\n*If you need to run named locally and you don't want to use it to resolve names locally, set RESOLVCONF=no in /etc/default/bind9 and then reboot.

I'm a novice and don't know where to find the info.  I have an Adapter-g wireless router.  When I connect through the modem, I get high speed.  When I connect through the router and modem, I get slower.  Both are Ethernet connections.  I have a Linksys wrt54g.  I know it needs replacing for my Comcast high speed but I don't want to buy an \"n\" if it's not compatible. \n\nA: Run lspci in terminal, and it will show what wifi card you have and it will even show you what modes does it support. (If it doesn't show the modes then just search for specifications on the internet.)\nBut I think you should buy an \"n\" router anyway. G routers are way too old, even \"n\" routers are being phased out. \n", "Q: How to enable display of framebuffer images (e.g. in w3m, fbi) within byobu (pts)? I'm trying to run a minimal Ubuntu 13.10 installation without X Window System on my old laptop. One of the most useful tools I rely on in this setup is byobu; however, it seems to prevent me from using applications capable of displaying images in framebuffer.\nOne such program is the browser w3m (installed with its w3m-img package). Executed from outside byobu (in tty1), though only if preceded by sudo, it displays web pages with images loaded as expected. However, if byobu is enabled (and thus my terminal is no longer identified as tty1, but rather as dev/pts/1), there's no way to get w3m to display images (no matter if I launch it with sudo or not).\nThe same applies to the fbi image viewer. Outside of byobu (but again, only if I launch it with sudo), it works without any problems. With byobu enabled, it instead produces an error message, the relevant bit of which seems to be\nioctl VT_GETSTATE: Inappropriate ioctl for device (not a linux console?)\n\nAs far as I understand, it all has to do something with the fact that byobu relies on a pseudo-terminal, and with some arcane permission settings (as the sudo requirement I mentioned seems to indicate).\nThanks in advance for any help with this!\n\nA: As Braden Best's answer says, you need to add your user to the video group.\nBut you can also do it with the following command:\nsudo usermod -a -G video {your username}\n\nLog out and back in (or reboot) after doing this to see the change.\n\nA: The framebuffer device (/dev/fb0) is owned by user root and group video\n$ ls -l /dev/fb0\ncrw-rw---- 1 root video 29, 0 Jan 27 11:00 /dev/fb0\n\nTo avoid using sudo to make programs using the framebuffer work, you would add yourself to the video group.\nFirst, edit the file. I'm using vim for this example, and assuming no prior knowledge of how to use it.\n$ sudo vim /etc/group \n\nWhile in vim, find the video line. To do that, just type /video followed by Enter\nThen, add yourself to the group by typing Shift+A followed by your username, and then save the file by typing esc followed by :wq, and Enter\nA quick restart of your shell, and you should be able to use programs like fbi without prefixing it with sudo\n", "Q: qml file and app.js not found I am a newbie in ubuntu app development.

So, does windows get deleted? and if not how to i change back and forth between the two? \n\nA: You have the option to Dual Boot between Windows 7 and Ubuntu. Typically this works well and you will be presented with an option to boot Ubuntu or Windows every time you boot. The important thing to watch for if you want to keep Windows is when installing, choosing the option to install Ubuntu side-by-side. Here is more information on Dual Booting Windows and Ubuntu: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot\n\nA: \nDoes windows 7 stay on the computer or get deleted?\n\nYou decide when installing Ubuntu. You can keep Windows 7 and boot into both; or you can remove Windows 7 completely.\n\nand if not how to i change back and forth between the two?\n\nIf your computer came with Windows 7 then probably by using Grub 2. It shows a menu every time you start the computer that lets you choose which OS to boot. By default it will auto-boot Ubuntu if you don't change the option within a few seconds. This is automatically set up if you install Ubuntu on a drive that already has Windows on it.\n", "Q: wd tv live streaming media player I just recently bought the WD TV Live streaming media player.

Or just relink it. For example for firefox this would be the easiest way:\n\n\n*\n\n*We have to hide the folder name, so make a new directory\nsudo mkdir /usr/lib/icefox\n\n\n*Next we make a link to firefox executable\ncd /usr/lib/icefox\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/firefox/firefox icefox\n\n\n*Now modify the firefox launcher\nsudo vi /usr/lib/firefox/firefox.sh\n\nAnd there change the MOZ_LIBDIR or MOZ_APP_NAME variables appropriately so they should read:\nMOZ_LIBDIR=/usr/lib/icefox\nMOZ_APP_NAME=icefox\n\nLeave all other lines untouched.\nAfter these firefox should show up as icefox in ps/top/htop.\nIf you don't like this method you have to modify the source code of top/htop/etc. All of these reporting programs get their data from the /proc filesystem. For e.g. the file which you should modify in htop's source is this. There you have to change the ProcessList_readCmdlineFile function. Just insert an if section after the \n command[amtRead] = '\\0'; \n\nline in which you check whether it is a process of which you want to hide it's name and if it is, then modify the command char array to what you want. Then after the changes you have to compile htop for yourself and use this modified version instead.

Is there a special way to install Ubuntu on this way enabling dual boot without much configurations ? Thank you in advance\n\nA: If you've installed Windows in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, then you should be able to install Linux in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode just as you would on an older computer. The main caveat is that, if you used Windows to repartition the disk in MBR mode (rather than the GPT that it presumably used before), Windows will not have completely wiped the GPT data, and this will confuse the Ubuntu installer. To fix this problem, run my FixParts program on the disk. It will detect the stray GPT data and offer to wipe it out. You can run either the Windows version of FixParts or the Linux version from a live CD.\nOTOH, if you've installed Windows in EFI/UEFI mode, you should read my page on Linux EFI-mode installations and the Ubuntu wiki on EFI. Between the two, you ought to be able to get it running, provided your firmware isn't one of the most badly broken ones.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.10 TTY wont open I'm new to Ubuntu and Linux in general.

When I later want to shut it down, the lid is still closed. It used to power down just fine with previous versions of Ubuntu (12.04 and 12.10 for sure, 13.04 probably as well).\nEver since I installed Ubuntu 13.10, instead of powering down, my laptop now goes to sleep immediately after logging me off. The actual shutdown sequence only happens if I open the lid again, otherwise my laptop stays suspended.\nSo I have been caught a few times with my laptop still on when I expected it to be off. Not a good idea to shove a running computer inside a closed bag that I carry around!\nSearching around, I find a lot of people with the opposite problem (computer shutting down when they really want to suspend). I also read many people advising to make changes to some \"systemd\" setting to ignore the suspend altogether, which I am wary about: why would I want to disable suspend completely for a single type of situation while I still want my laptop to suspend when I use it on battery power? And even more since it used to work just fine with previous versions of Ubuntu.\nDo you guys have any idea what the problem might be, or how I could troubleshoot this deeper?\n--- EDIT:\nI am left with an additional question: is this problem specific to my computer, have I done something wrong to cause it? As soon as I have time, I will try to work on this. Like, does this happen from the live CD? Does it happen on a different laptop computer? Does it happen with a completely clean install on my current computer? I will let you know what I find out.\n\nA: You need to configure logind.conf - this would not disable the suspend,  it would just to tell it to ignore the lid switch, or just lock screen.\nThis would also override any of your user's power settings, but it will work in the login screeen or when it is shutting down, when it is outside the user session and unaffected by the user's power settings.\nYou can configure it via:\nsudo nano /etc/systemd/logind.conf\nand change the HandleLidSwitch=\nline to:\nHandleLidSwitch=ignore\nHere is a qoute from a manual page  - note it can take other values like lock, poweroff etc.\n\nHandlePowerKey=, HandleSuspendKey=, HandleHibernateKey=,\n  HandleLidSwitch=\nControls whether logind shall handle the system power and sleep keys and the lid switch to trigger actions such as system power-off or\n  suspend. Can be one of \"ignore\", \"poweroff\", \"reboot\", \"halt\",\n  \"kexec\", \"suspend\", \"hibernate\", \"hybrid-sleep\" and \"lock\". If\n  \"ignore\", logind will never handle these keys. If \"lock\", all running\n  sessions will be screen-locked; otherwise, the specified action will\n  be taken in the respective event. Only input devices with the\n  \"power-switch\" udev tag will be watched for key/lid switch events.\n  HandlePowerKey= defaults to \"poweroff\". HandleSuspendKey= and\n  HandleLidSwitch= defaults to \"suspend\". HandleHibernateKey= defaults to\n  \"hibernate\".\n\nThe manual page is here\n", "Q: Is this partitioning scheme for Windows7/Ubuntu fine? This isn't an exact copy of my previous question.\nI have an ASUS K53U laptop with Windows 7 64-bit installed. I want it to dual-boot with Ubuntu (Linux-Secure-Remix, preferably). I have previously used WUBI on this laptop. I have an AMD processor, 698GB of hard drive space and 4GB of RAM.\nCurrently my partitions are arranged like this:\n\nRECOVERY\n      Size: 25GB\n      Filesystem: ???\n      Used: ???\n      Free: ???\n\n  OS\n      Size: 300GB\n      Filesystem: NTFS\n      Used: 70.4GB\n      Free: 229GB\n\n  DATA\n      Size: 373GB\n      Filesystem: NTFS\n      Used: 206GB\n      Free: 166GB\n\n  total:   698GB\n\nWhat I think I should do to install Ubuntu is this:\n\n*\n\n*Shrink DATA by about 100GB\n\n*Create an extended partition in the space created\n\n*Inside this extended partition,\n\nMake a 4GB swap\n  Make about 32GB / (root)\n  Everything else: /home\n  \n  Is this a good scheme? Can I improve it? Will it work? How do I put it into practice? (is GParted fine?)\n\nThank you in advance!\n\nA: I think you are right, you can do it by Gparted in Ubuntu Live CD, first you can shrink the DATA 100GB by WIndows Disk Manager.\n\nA: This will work: this looks very much like what I do with my own laptop (the only differences are that I don't have a DATA partition and that sizes are different). I now create all my Ubuntu partitions within the extended partition and GRUB2 can start Ubuntu just fine in that configuration.\nPlease note the following however. In the past, I have used other custom bootloaders that would simply change the active partition dynamically during boot. This would not work in your case as the active partition must be a primary partition. This is probably not a problem as you will likely use GRUB2 to manage your multibooting.\nThe Ubuntu installer has an option to automatically reduce your Windows partitions and install alongside. If you want more control, you could indeed use Gparted to prepare your partitioning scheme. I believe it's also possible to manually resize your partitions in the Ubuntu installer, but it may feel a bit trickier there: Gparted sounds like a good choice to really see what you're doing. You will then need to select the last option in the installer to manually assign your partitions (\"/\", \"/home\" and \"swap\", plus the Windows partitions if you want to access them, just make sure not to format them!).\nOn a personal note, I still prefer to shrink my NTFS partitions directly from Windows (inside the Disk Management console or using the DISKPART utility and its SHRINK command), but it hardly seems to matter nowadays.\n\nA: I think it's ok too. \nTake a look at this irc log to get some ideas of what you could do with those partitions. \nhttp://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2011/10/19/%23ubuntu-classroom.html\n", "Q: moving from ubuntu 32 bit to 64 bit I have a all in one panel PC - Lenovo Ideacenter B300 with Ubuntu 13.10 (32 bit).  \nI also have the following mount setup:  \n/dev/sda3 on / type ext4 (rw,errors=remount-ro)\n....\n​/dev/sda7 on /home type ext4 (rw)\n....\n\nI just found out that my PC actally has a 64 bit architecture (lscpu):  \nCPU op-mode(s):        32-bit, 64-bit\n\nand so I would like to reinstall ubuntu 64bit GIVEN that I have my /home data on another partition.

My recommendation is to enter System Tools -> Software Update -> Configuration -> Ubuntu Software (tab) -> Download from: -> (then choose a different server, I got mine set to Spain Server but another choice/option I have is to set it to Main Server). So you'd have to change your setting to a different server. Once the change is made you'll have to type your password in order for the change to take effect.

As all the other font packages do, they just got renamed to be less format specific. The Liberation font from ttf-liberation package can now be found in fonts-liberation. With 13.10/saucy all the (transitional) ttf-* packages were finally dropped, but not the fonts themselves.\nWorkaround for broken font dependency\nOnly the qesteidutil package seems to contain the outdated dependency. You could download the package and update the control file within the debian directory of the package.\nAlso please check if /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ria-repository.list really contains the release name you want to download packages for. If not, edit the file and run sudo apt-get update. If you still encounter issues, then take a look at How do I resolve unmet dependencies after adding a PPA?\nSuggestion: build your own packages\nSince sources are available, you could rebuild one or all of the packages. The packages however are incompatible to the Debian guidelines as they all seem to be missing copyright information and may be more (see the packaging guide for information on how to get started and how Debian compliant packages should look like).\nA closer look at the setup script\nThe script is used to write distribution specific repository files to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ria-repository.list, which deviates from the default naming convention for these files and implies that the script should be run after each release upgrade, unless you know what to fix. It will leave you without installable packages for saucy, as they do not exist currently. The script also fetches and installs the repository key from the key server.\nIf you build your own signed packages and want to distribute them, you would need to modify these parts of the script. The best solution would be a Ubuntu PPA, given that the source code is really Open Source and free to distribute (should be, as I can see a lot of files containing the LGPL license text when browsing for example https://svn.eesti.ee/projektid/idkaart_public/branches/3.7.2/).\nSummary\nI know this looks like I am just complaining or talking you into packaging, but I am confident that these little issues can be sorted out.\n\nA: Your problem is mainly that you are mixing repositories. You are trying to install quantal packages in a Saucy system. This you shouldn't happen! The https://installer.id.ee/media/ubuntu/dists/ shows that they do have packages for saucy ready, so you should change to that repository. If you paid for the service, you must contact their support if you got any troubles.\nRemove any quantal reference from your sources and add saucy's which they have packages ready.\nTo do the first run this:\nsudo sed -i '/quantal/d' /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*.list\n\nand add this to your source.list:\ndeb https://installer.id.ee/media/ubuntu/ saucy main\n\nYou must make sure that you have the apt-transport-https package installed.\n", "Q: How can I make files received by Bluetooth be saved in my own specified folder?

The guide that I follow for remove it is that answer, this and this. How can I uninstall it? I know that it is installed for the output of java -version and javac -version \nHere any information:\nThe dpkg --list | grep -i jdk command gives nothing\nThe command java -version gives:\nThe program 'java' can be found in the following packages:\n* default-jre\n* gcj-4.6-jre-headless\n* gcj-4.7-jre-headless\n* openjdk-7-jre-headless\n* openjdk-6-jre-headless\nTry: sudo apt-get install <selected package>\n\nThe command javac -version gives this:\n`TThe program 'javac' can be found in the following packages:\n* default-jdk\n* ecj\n* gcj-4.6-jdk\n* gcj-4.7-jdk\n* openjdk-7-jdk\n* openjdk-6-jdk\nTry: sudo apt-get install <selected package>\n\nif I run ls /usr/lib/jvm it says that there isn't such directory.\nI would like to remove JDK and JRE before install packages. How can I do that?\n\nA: I see that you've already uninstalled the JDK (Java Development Kit) and JRE (Java Runtime Environment). The openjdk-*-jre* is actually the JRE (Java Runtime Environment) of OpenJDK, the JDK of OpenJDK is something like openjdk-*-jdk.\nWhen you run java and the system says The program 'java' can be found in the following packages: ..., it means you have not installed any JRE yet. When you run javac and the system says The program 'javac' can be found in the following packages: ..., it means you have not installed any JDK yet.\n-or-\nMaybe you have installed one, but you have not properly set it up. This happens if you install JRE/JDK without using package manager, i.e. not using apt-get, aptitute, Software Center, Synaptic Package Manager, etc. If you install JRE/JDK by using package manager, I am sure that you can run java or javac, i.e. if you run java -version or javac -version the version you have installed will be printed instead of a suggestion of package you need to install. However, it is not the case. Let's say that you have uninstall any JRE/JDK.\nHow to uninstall\nThis is the answer about how to uninstall (because the question is \"How to uninstall JDK\"), just ignore it if you have uninstalled it.\nThe simplest way is to use terminal. First, type:\napt-get autoremove <list-of-package-names> -s\n\nIt will do a simulation, so you can see what packages will be removed. If you are sure about what you do, just run the command without -s parameter and use sudo. For example:\nsudo apt-get autoremove gcj-4.6-jre-headless gcj-4.7-jre-headless openjdk-6-jre-headless openjdk-7-jre-headless\n\nDANGER! Pay attention on the list of package you are about to remove (you will see it before confirming the actual execution), because it will also remove packages that depend on the package in the list (parameters after sudo apt-get). So, any application that needs JRE/JDK to run will also be removed. I have warned you :).\n", "Q: Sound coming through my speakers in ubuntu I'm just trying to get some sort of sound coming thru my speakers.

I would normally solve an answer like this through trial and error, but I'm afraid I'll lock myself out of this server...\n\nA: If you want to disallow password logins then just set PasswordAuthentication no in the sshd_conf on the server.\nI don't recall exactly, but I think at least no root login is the default.\nAttempting to log in as any user on the system, who does not have your public key in their ~/.ssh/authorized_keys will ask for the password, whether or not a password is set, or a shell is available, if password login has not been disabled.\nI think what you want is simply:\n\nPasswordAuthentication no\nPermitRootLogin no\n\nThis will disallow any root login, either with ssh key or password, and will require users to login with a valid key, as included by having the public key in that user's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file.\n", "Q: It is possible to update a Live USB with persistent installed?

I have an old laptop prone to overheating and a good solution I found was limiting it's CPU usage to below 50%.\nOn Windows, I can do this by changing the power plan I am currently using, and altering the Minimum CPU Usage and and Maximum CPU Usage properties.\nWhere can I do something similar on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS?\n\nA: You can use cgroups to control how various system resources are allocated.\nhttps://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroups/cgroups.txt\nNow set some parameters that are available for tuning:\nsudo echo 1000 > /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu.cfs_period_us\nsudo echo 500 > /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu.cfs_quota_us\n\nWhich means \"for every 1000 microseconds, allow the / cgroup to consume 500 microseconds of cpu.\"\nMore info:\nhttps://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Resource_Management_Guide/sec-cpu.html\nThe commands above are from memory (I'm at home on Mac now), but they give the general idea.\nOnce you are able to see that indeed cpu is limited to 50% (using top for example to view), then it's left as an exercise for the reader to make these changes persistent.\n\nA: Follow these steps to limit the CPU usage and hence decrease temperature.    \nStep 1 : Download the script file from the following link:\nhttps://github.com/Sepero/temp-throttle/archive/master.zip.\n         Extract the zip file   \nStep 2 : Start the terminal and mount the extracted folder and then run the command\nsudo ./temp_throttle.sh 80 \n\nIt's done.\n", "Q: How to get a list of installed applications without booting into Ubuntu?

Is there any way that I can get a list of installed applications (on the Ubuntu partition) so that I can easily install them on a new hard drive?\n\nA: You should be able to tell dpkg to search the database on the inactive filesystem. For example if you have mounted the failing disk's root filesystem at /mnt/old then you can try\ndpkg --admindir=/mnt/old/var/lib/dpkg --get-selections\nor \ndpkg-query -l --admindir=/mnt/old/var/lib/dpkg\nThe dpkg --get-selections command would be preferable (if it works) since you can import its output directly via dpkg --set-selections on the new system.\n\nA: I can think of a couple of different things, just from looking at the HDD: \n\n\n*\n\n*Look at /opt for those random packages that get installed there\n\n*Look at /usr/share/applications to get a listing of all the applications that have a shortcut that shows up when you search Unity.\n\n*Look at /etc/ to see if you've missed anything that's just a CLI tool.\n\n\nIf you ever get it to start up, you could type: \nsudo dpkg --get-selections\nThat will give you the most comprehensive list.\n", "Q: Ubuntu will not boot after upgrade I upgraded from 10.04 to the next version and now I see the Ubuntu logo briefly and the screen goes blank.

You were trying to simply copy the contents of the Windows XP Installation medium to a USB drive and got a \"BOOTMGR missing\" error when trying to start the computer with this USB drive.\nMy first idea was to replace the boot sector on the USB drive with a Windows XP boot sector, which would try to load NTLDR instead of BOOTMGR. However, this failed to take into account that with either boot sectors (older XP version or updated Vista and newer version) the Windows XP Installation medium is not designed to be started from USB (unlike that of Windows Vista and newer).\nFrom other comments that you made, I seem to understand that you do not own a physical copy of your Windows XP installation medium, but rather have an ISO copy of it.\nThe logical advice from here is simply to burn your ISO copy to a CD-ROM and to use that disc to start the computer and install Windows XP the way it was designed to be. This solution does not seem to appeal to you. Maybe you don't have a CD-ROM drive or burner in that computer?\n\nA: *\n\n*Winusb doesn't support windows xp.so follow the simple steps given below,\n\n*Download multiboot,and then follow this guide to make bootable windows usb.\n\n*Already tested Windows XP, Ubuntu and Windows 7.\n", "Q: Broadcom Hybrid Chipset Wifi Works Bluetooth Does Not I have a HP Envy Touchsmart 15 and it has a hybrid Broadcom chipset that's both Wifi and Bluetooth.

I upgraded my distro from 12.04 to 13.10, but it seems to have crashed my machine.  I'm dual-booting, and grub is okay - but my desktop appears with errors.  I can't shut down properly, because the GUI is gone, and an internal error appears upon boot.

I don't know if I should upload a log (netstart no longer seems to work).\nPlease help me get my OS back; I have a lot of data stored that I can't afford to replace.\n\nA: First of all; backup your important data. You can do this from the terminal with a simple cp command. Usually your data and personal settings are saved in your home folder (e.g. /home/username/). You can use cp -a to backup your home folder to an external drive (see man cp). Preferably, the external drive should have a Linux file system too (e.g. ext4), otherwise you will lose your file permissions.\nIf your home folder is actually on a separate partition (I believe the Ubuntu installation does this by default now), then you can easily revert to Ubuntu 12.04 without losing your data and personal settings. To check whether your home folder is on a separate partition, run the command df from the terminal. If \"/home\" appears in the \"Mounted on\" column of the output, then it is indeed a separate partition. To revert to Ubuntu 12.04, just reinstall it using the official Ubuntu 12.04 installation disc. During installation, tell it to replace Ubuntu 13.10, but keep and reuse the existing home partition (do not format the home partition). If you are lucky, it will appear as an option during installation at the partitioning step. If not, you will have to select manual partitioning (see question 285212). Again, do not format the home partition.\nIf your home folder is not on a separate partition, you can still install Ubuntu 12.04 using the official installation disc, but you will lose all your personal data in the process (because it is on the same partition as Ubuntu itself). But you can easily restore your data and personal settings with the backup you created. Just copy everything back into your home folder (e.g. /home/username/) after installation.\nSince this is a clean install, you will have to reinstall any software that was not installed by default. But that is easily done via the Software Center.\n", "Q: Reset settings of gnome-control-center sound program I have Ubuntu 13.10 installed on my notebook. I have a problem only with skype.

If you can boot to Linux using that, then installing the Debian-package version should get rEFInd working as your default boot manager.\nA variant on the GRUB 2 installation option is to run Boot Repair. This will install a fresh copy of GRUB on the computer, so it's essentially another way to re-install GRUB.\n", "Q: How to know if I have muxed hardware I'm reading this page.\nRegarding this statement\n\nvga_switcheroo is the kernel mechanism that allows you to switch\n  between GPUs if your machine has a hardware mux.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Does this mean manual or live switching (i.e. automatic)\n\n*How to know if I have hardware mux ?

I found it while looking up what a Mux is.\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/hybrid_graphics\nMaybe that will help you decide if you have Mux or not.\nIn the screen shot it shows that you are using the proprietary AMD driver. To use the vga_switcheroo you have to use the X.org X server (open source, tested) driver. \n", "Q: .sh file opens with emacs instead of running I installed Android studio, and this program starts from the studio.sh file. If I run it from the terminal it goes well, but if I double click on it, this file is opened with emacs.

I'm trying to view some 4K resolution MP4 videos generated by a Galaxy Note 3 on my mid-2010 MacBook Pro 7, 1 running Ubuntu 13.10. \nUsing any of the standard major video players (VLC, Totem, etc.), I'm having difficulties seeing anything. Just as Evince presents PDFs in a limited resolution for the purposes of speed, is there a video player that can do something similar for the presentation of 4K video in a lower resolution so that I can view it? Alternatively, is there some fast way for me to convert the video files to files with specified lower resolutions? \n\nA: An easy way to view 4K videos is to use latest version of VLC, e.g. 2.2.1, which is now 4K-ready. For some Ubuntu distros, you can install latest VLC from this PPA: \nppa:ed10vi86/video.\n\nA: Install ffmpeg.  Then, from the command line, ffplay -vf scale=1600:900 my-4k-video.mp4 .\nOr, ffmpeg -i in.mov -c:v libx264 -vf scale=1600:900 -c:a copy out.mov .\nIn either case, change the x- and y-resolutions 1600 and 900 as you wish.\n", "Q: gedit and ssh \"ImportError: No module named 'cairo'\" Short description: I want to run an instance of gedit, provided by my Ubuntu 13.10 \"Server\" on another Computer.

It is a major pain, in my experience, to get it back.  I would advise you to purchase a new hard drive, disconnect/take your old one out, and install fresh on to the new drive.\nInstall Windows first, manually configuring your partitioning, then install your linux.  Purchase a USB adapter/caddy/enclosure for your old hard drive, and copy off your data from it.\nMessing around with partitions is dangerous and if you don't have good backups, then you end up in a very unfortunate position where you have deleted your actual data.\n\nA: If you've accidentally deleted partitions, try using TestDisk. I can make no promises, but it may be able to find and restore your missing partition(s). Note that you may need to adjust their partition type codes with fdisk (if the disk is MBR) or with gdisk (if the disk is GPT).\n\nA: I just solved the same type of scenario on my computer like 10 minutes ago.  \nFollow the answer in this post:\nWindows Boot Partition was deleted after re installing Ubuntu 13.10 and can not boot into Windows\nIf it doesn't work let me know and I might have a few other steps you can try before doing what the post says.\n", "Q: Wireless (WPA2) keeps asking for password I am on Ubuntu 14.04 (i686).\nI read that there is one or more reported bugs related to this issue.

However I never faced this issue in 13.10.\n\nA: Not sure about bugs. I had this problem on both Linux and Android and it ended up being faulty router firmware.

The advantage over xwininfo is that you don't need to select a window, which can be handy when you are checking a virtual framebuffer created with Xvfb. \nHere is a snippet of the relevant output of the command xdpyinfo:\n....\nscreen #0:\n  dimensions:    1024x768 pixels (260x195 millimeters)\n  resolution:    100x100 dots per inch\n  depths (6):    8, 1, 4, 16, 24, 32\n  root window id:    0x4d\n  depth of root window:    8 planes\n  number of colormaps:    minimum 1, maximum 1\n  default colormap:    0x20\n....\n\nThe depth of root window reflects the bit depth of the root window, in this example it's 8 bits.\nThe depths property lists the supported bit depths, the first number indicates the current bit depth.\n", "Q: Packaging non-SDK app as click? I have a program that I created using Free Pascal Lazarus, and I would like to share it in Ubuntu, but how do I pack it with .click?\nI have read this\nhttp://developer.ubuntu.com/publish/apps/packaging-click-apps/\nbut my program has nothing to do with Ubuntu SDK, or Qt creator, it is just a Linux program, maybe uses GTK, so how can I pack it with .click?\nThank you very much.\n\nA: The click packages are designed to be self-contained apps that are currently only supported on the phone/tablet version of Ubuntu. They cannot specify dependencies on other packages (such as free pascal, which is not included in Ubuntu). Once full convergence is ramped up in Ubuntu though, it should be possible to package more apps such as yours, as click packages.\nFor now, your best option will likely be to create a PPA for your app on Launchpad, and create Debian (deb) packages for the dependencies, and the app itself.\n", "Q: How do I install java?

No \"Boot from USB\" option.  Someone here kindly\nsuggested a link which reported they got added options by changing \n\"Secure Boot Mode\" under the \"Security\" tab to \"Legacy\" but on my PC, \nthat option isn't selectable, ie, the selection cursor just bypasses \nthat selection. The only 2 selectable options are \"Reset to Setup Mode\" \nand \"Restore Factory Keys\".\nAnyone know who/where the usual suspects are hiding? How to flush\nthem out?\n\nA: First, be sure that you've actually plugged an EFI-bootable USB flash drive into the computer. The option may not be present if there's no USB flash drive inserted or if it's not bootable in EFI mode.\nIf you've done that, I recommend you try another image for diagnostic purposes. Another distribution should work fine if you've got it handy. If you want something quick to download, there's a USB flash drive image of my rEFInd boot manager that you can download and prepare quickly for testing purposes.\nAnother thing to try is another physical medium. I've seen a few reports of USB flash drives that work fine in an OS but that firmware doesn't seem to like. I'm not sure of the cause of the problem, but if this is what you're running into, a new USB flash drive might fix it.\nYou could try using rEFInd to work around the problem. Install it on your hard disk from Windows (see the rEFInd documentation for instructions), or use it on another USB flash drive. When you boot to rEFInd with a bootable USB flash drive plugged in, it should give you an option to boot it. This might work around EFI bugs, but probably not hardware incompatibility.\nSpeaking of EFI bugs, you might try upgrading your firmware.\nFinally, you could try setting up a partition with the Ubuntu installation files on it and use rEFInd to boot the installer from there. In theory this should work, but there may well be some \"gotchas,\" and I don't have detailed step-by-step instructions.\nTry these in whatever order you like; I don't mean to imply anything by their ordering (except for the first item, which is the most basic one).\n", "Q: What is the Ubuntu equivalent of the Windows Start Menu? Is there an equivalent of the Windows \"Start Menu\" in Ubuntu from where all installed programs can be easily accessed?\n\nA: For those interested in the XP-style Start Menu on  Ubuntu , there is classic menu indicator  ( which originally was meant to mimic old Gnome menu , which was in Ubuntu way before Unity Dash came around )\n\nIt's written by Florian Diesch , one of the esteemed members of AskUbuntu community and is available for installation via \nsudo apt-get install classicmenu-indicator\n\n\nA: Equivalent of windows start menu in Ubuntu is Dash. Press Super key (AKA  key on a Windows-style keyboard) on the keyboard to open up dash. There you can search for installed applications, document, directories and also you can search for online materials (like games, musics, news, etc).\n\nYou can directly access the application lens by pressing Super+A (ie:  + A). Through that you can access installed, recently used applications.\n\nA: Unity, the default UI since Ubuntu 11.04, has this wonderful Dash desktop search utility. You can access Dash by hitting the Super key (aka    key in Windows keyboard). \nAt the bottom of the Dash, click the application lens among others, as shown in the snapshot (in Ubuntu 12.04 you can directly access this using Super + A):\n\nClick \"Installed: See ... more results\" to view a menu list of all installed applications.\n\nClick to launch the application you want. Use arrow keys or the scroll bar to browse for more application down the list.\n\nBut the Dash is not limited to this...

It don't seems to have something to do with Unity where I found something about focus problems in the web.\nWhile the installation process the first problems happened: sometimes I was not able to press a button with the mouse. In this case I took the keyboard.\nBut when the window manager is started, Ubuntu gets unusable for me. Sometimes the focus seems to stick in a window. When this is the case, I can move the mouse over an other window, but I am not able to set the focus in it - it stays in the other window. Also if I use \"alt-tab\". Sometimes it even happens that focus of keyboard sticks in one window and focus of mouse in an other. \nThe strange thing is that this happens in 8/10 boots. So not every time, but most of the time.\nI already tried to use Gnome desktop because I thought it might have something to do with unity, but it was the same there. MS Windows works without problems on this hardware.\nI found a very similar question here with Ubuntu 12.04. I also use Chrome so it might be related to it. But for me it happens with all windows if the problems start:\nMouse and keyboard focus problem\nHave you some ideas? Did you already hear of such problems? What logs might be interesting?\nThanks!\n\nA: I've encountered the exact same behavior over multiple installs on my current hardware. What consistently solved it for me was killing and restarting the x server. A system restart was never sufficient, the glitch persisted after a vanilla reboot.\nThe method I employed was to first enable ctrl+alt+backspace to kill and restart the x server: http://www.humans-enabled.com/2013/10/ubuntu-1310-enable-controlaltbackspace.html\n\n1.)

I'm obviously appealing the developer for an Ubuntu version, but I need a short-term solution :)\n\nA: Follow these steps :(includes formatting the entire disk and will get a fresh system)\nStep 1:\n\nBoot from windows 8 disk and modify the partitions as you wish. Keep in mind that you will need partitions for\n  1. Windows\n  2. Ubuntu\n  3. Swap space\n  4. Other Data\n  So, install windows in the partition you prefer.\n\nStep 2:\n\nInsert the Ubuntu disk and install Ubuntu in the partition you prefer by allocating some Swap space.\n\nThat's it. Normally both the OS will dual boot without any problem. But if you are not getting any GRUB (Boot menu) , You should run the Boot repair.

I read that u-series Ubuntu release that will be delivered in October 2014, designated 14.10 is not derived from another series. What is this u-series and what are the other series? Is there going to be a major change in the kernel architecture or something else?\n\nA: At this time there is no release codename for Ubuntu 14.10 yet but following tradition after the Trusty Tahr (which was the \"T\"-series) there will be a codename with letters \"U\", hence the interim name \"u-series\".\nAlso see: How are release codenames chosen?\nIt would be rather speculative to say which changes will actually land in the 14.10. release but it appears that Mir will be replacing X-Server, we will see Unity 8, and Covergence there.\n", "Q: How do I remove Windows Vista off my Ubuntu laptop? I have Ubuntu 13.10 installed as a dual boot and I no longer want Windows Vista on my laptop. What is the easiest way to remove Vista from Ubuntu?\n\nA: To remove Windows all you need to do is to delete the Windows partition. Before you begin I suggest you do a complete back up just in case you delete the  wrong partition!\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert the live CD or USB for Ubuntu and open the partition manager(Gparted)\n\n*Find all the Windows partitions, right click and Delete it.(Make sure you are not deleting the wrong partition!)\n\n*Now right click on the Linux partition and choose Re size option and include the deleted windows partition. \n\n*Select the Apply all Operation. \n\n\nAfter deleting the partition if you still find any Windows entries in the grub go to the Linux terminate and type sudo update-grub and you are good to go! \n", "Q: when to use -f or -a tag in if loop I'm confused between two tages that can be used in if statement in bash scripting.\nOne is -f and other is -a.\nTheir description states as follows:\n[ -f FILE ] True if FILE exists and is a regular file.\n[ -a FILE ] True if FILE exists.\n\nNow, while using the if condition in my shell script how can I know which tag should I use. Like I have a script which takes regular backups using tar and creates a file file-name.tar.gz so how can I know which is a regular file. Thanks.\n\nA: Regular files are all the text or data file, it can be a binary file as well. For regular files the output of ls -l would be like,\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 username group 74 Nov 27 16:03 mytext.txt\n\nIn general the first place for a regular file a - should appear. In such cases if [ -f FILE ] would be appropriate.\nNon-Regular files are devices, pipes, sockets, tty etc. all other that fall under \"Everything is a file\" philosophy as pointed out by drc. You can go through Unix_file_types for more information.\nYou can verify the ls -l output of some like,\ncrw-rw---- 1 root tty 4, 1 Dec  9 13:41 /dev/tty1\nbrw-rw---- 1 root disk 1, 11 Dec  9 13:41 /dev/ram11\n\nFor all the non-regular files you should use if [ -a FILE ]\n\nA: For tar files – and basically any other file you create – -f is the correct choice.\n-a is for special files like device nodes, fifos and such, which according to the Unix philosophy of Everything is a file are presented as files in your filesystem.\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu with Android in Samsung Galaxy Note hi I am a user of Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 and I just have seen an app \"Ubuntu for Android\"\nI have Android 4.1.2 in my Note.

An error message displayed \"application not found\". What happened and what should I do now?\n\nA: Don't try to open the ISO file downloaded.  The error message that you're getting is because you don't have an application associated with ISO.  What you can do is either burn the ISO to DVD, or create a bootable USB flash drive.\nIf you're using windows, you can use ImgBurn to create the DVD or use Unetbootin to create the bootable USB.  \n\n\nIf running Ubuntu please see Installing Ubuntu\n", "Q: Dock icons settings lost after reboot I have installed 12.04 on my desktop machine, everything works fine except for a few annoyances.\nAll modifications I do to my dock (I add/remove icons) are lost upon reboot/logout.\nIf it helps, I've done a clean system install but I have been keeping my home folder.

From man mycrpt, I see that it is a tool to apply one of the algorithms (ciphers?) specified in mcrypt --list-hashes.\nWhereas scrypt is an algorithm in and of itself, so the tool can apply only that.\nIs this correct?\n\nA: Mcrypt is a simple crypting program, a replacement for the old unix crypt . When encrypting or decrypting a file, a new file is created with the extension .nc and mode 0600. The new file keeps the modification date of the original. The original file may be deleted by specifying the -u parameter. If no files are specified, the standard input is encrypted to the standard output.\nMcrypt uses all the symmetric algorithms included in libmcrypt.Man Page \nScrypt is a password-based key derivation function created by Colin Percival. The algorithm was specifically designed to make it costly to perform large scale custom hardware attacks by requiring large amounts of memory, and is designed to be far more secure against hardware brute-force attacks. In 2012, the scrypt algorithm was published by IETF as an Internet Draft, intended to become an informational RFC, which has since expired.Tarsnap\n", "Q: Sound Stops working after I close my laptop lid My laptop's (hp envy touchsmart 15, running ubuntu 13.10) audio stops working after the laptop sleeps or if I close my laptop lid (the current setting are the on closing the lid the laptop does not go to sleep).

You could (and should, if this is your actual use case) just run sort filename > sortedfilename.\n\nAnyway, back to redirects...\nThe input redirect (<) reads from a file and pipes that into stdin. To answer your question, it is directly equivalent to cat filename |.\nThe sort command looks for stdin in lieu of a filename argument and does the sorting and pipes that to stdout. The output redirection (>) can then be used to send that into a file rather than the screen.\nIf you really want to blow your mind, read TLDP's chapter on I/O redirection. It's probably a bit more raw than your book but it's solid, tested stuff.

They are a \"dumping ground\" of sorts filled with information the authors of the software deem interesting or useful.\nOften there are mechanisms to control the verbosity of the logging in the configuration files for the software. This can be useful when troubleshooting as it gives usually much more information which may lead to a solution. Once things are working the way they should be, the log level can be adjusted to only show errors or extreme situation for example.\nVirtually all software that performs logging does this in different ways in my experience.\nI would guess that the first field in that example is the timestamp of the logged event represented as seconds since boot.\n", "Q: How to reinstate dualboot after upgrading to Windows 8.1?

However, it does not have a valid fake msdos partition table, as it should.  Perhaps it was corrupted -- possibly by a program that doesn't understand GPT partition tables.  Or perhaps you deleted the GPT table, and are now using an msdos partition table.  Is this a GPT partition table?\nError: Both the primary and backup GPT tables are corrupt.  Try making a fresh table, and using Parted's rescue feature to recover partitions.\n(udisks-error-quark, 0)\n\n\n\nA: I ran into this problem with writing onto an old drive that had been written as a live linux disk. \nSolution if you just want to erase the disk /dev/sdX:\nsudo gdisk /dev/sdX\no  \n\n(agree to delete partitions)\nw  \n\n(agree to write partition table)\nAnd then you have a perfectly blank drive.  All that remains is to create a partition if you want to use it.  \nNote: Gdisk is a disk partitioning tool, and it can erase your disk if not careful. It is designed to create, modify, and erase partitions.\n\nA: Chances are your disk originally contained a GUID Partition Table (GPT), but you created a new Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table over that with a tool that doesn't understand GPT. Because GPT takes up more space than MBR, this means that there's leftover GPT data, and parted is becoming confused because of that.\nIf this analysis is correct, then the easiest solution is to run FixParts on the disk. FixParts will offer to remove the leftover GPT data, and thereafter you should be able to use the disk normally. (You don't need to do anything else in FixParts; just tell it to remove the GPT data when it asks you about this and then exit.)\nThere is a caveat, though: It's also possible that you had a GPT disk but that something accidentally wrote an MBR partition table to the disk. In this case, you probably want to recover the GPT, not wipe it out! If this is the case, the solution is to run gdisk on the disk. It will detect the problem and ask if you want to use the GPT or MBR data. Tell it to use the GPT data, check that it's correct by typing p and comparing the output to whatever you believe to be correct, and then type w to save the changes.\nBoth FixParts (fixparts) and gdisk are part of the gdisk package in Ubuntu. It's usually not installed by default, so you may have to install it by typing sudo apt-get install gdisk.\n", "Q: MSI GS70 reboot and select proper boot device or insert boot media I just bought an MSI GS70 and I wanted to install Ubuntu from a Live USB.

Should be easy to install/setup.\n\nA: For mirroring a website I like to use httrack rather than wget with recursive retrieval options.\nDescription: HTTrack saves websites to your computer (Offline browser).\nHTTrack is an offline browser utility, allowing you to download a World Wide website from the Internet to a local directory, building recursively all\n directories, getting html, images, and other files from the server to your computer. \nHTTrack arranges the original site's relative link-structure. Simply open a page of the \"mirrored\" website in your browser, and you can browse the\n site from link to link, as if you were viewing it online. HTTrack can also update an existing mirrored site, and resume interrupted downloads. HTTrack\n is fully configurable, and has an integrated help system.\nTo install in the terminal:\nsudo apt-get install httrack\n\n\nA: After you properly mirrored your website with wget or anything else just cd into the downloaded webpages root directory and run this:\nfind . -iname \"*.htm*\" -exec grep -l \"WHAT_YOU_ARE_SEARCHING_GOES_HERE\" {} + | xargs -d \"\\n\" firefox\n\nThen firefox will open all the pages which contains your search. \n(Or a little bit more if your search term is present only in the webpage's HTML tags. If this is a problem for you, then it can also be solved by another pipe, which filters out the HTML tags.)\n\nA: You could use grep, but pipe the output into a webpage, so that it is understandable as most of the tags would be removed, for example:\ngrep -d recurse 'SEARCH-TERM' /PATH/TO/FOLDER/WITH/WEBPAGE-FILES > OUTPUT.html\n\nThis would remove most of the tags and stuff, though it would be cropped to indidvidual lines, so you could use the -C option to show some of the context of the search result.:\ngrep -d recurse -C 5 'SEARCH-TERM' /PATH/TO/FOLDER/WITH/WEBPAGE-FILES > OUTPUT.html\n\nwhere 5 is the number of lines in each direction to give the search result more context.\nFor more options, see man grep\nReally, a web browser is the best tool to search a web page - I can't think of much else\nOh, and to make sure that you search only webpages (with the extension .htm or .html):\nfind . -name \"*.htm*\" -exec grep -d recurse -C 5 'SEARCH-TERM' /PATH/TO/FOLDER/WITH/WEBPAGE-FILES > OUTPUT.html\n\n\nAlso, to improve any downloading of webpages / websites with wget, look here.\n", "Q: drivers ATI Radeon HD 4550 no Ubuntu 12.04 LTS What do you recommend!

The colors you choose there will not override site colors, but options are limited. There is also a checkbox here that will allow sites to set their own coors, and one to use system colors.

Now it doesn't show any partitions (see attachment). and says \"unallocated space\" whereas it is allocated and there is data that are really important and I cannot afford to lose.\nI want to ask is there any way out to recover this information. I have already used testdisk and it has found three partitions successfully whereas the fourth one is still missing. If you recommend using the same software (testdisk) kindly guide me how can I find the fourth one as well and how can I recover them later on (after finding the right partitions).

Posts related to testdisk has worked for me to some extent but still I am confused. If you mind asking like this, kindly remove this question. I don't mind. Sorry for any inconvenience caused. Thanks\n\nA: First of all, stop using the disk immediately. And don't do anything to it unless you are sure it will result in your disk's partition recovery, otherwise you may harm your data when attempting to recover it.\nAfter that, all the testdisk related posts are useful for the specific case, as you mention. And for your specific case please have a look at this video by Amzertech in Youtube, which explains exactly what to do when deleting a partition the way you did.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EncqYP1ijFg\nIf everything is fine and you have not done anything harmful to your disk, there are good chances for you to bring the whole partition back with ease, after which I will suggest you to back up everything, format the disk again and place the data inside of it, in order to avoid crossed clusters and these things. Which reminds me that if your hard disk drive is having crossed clusters or data you may lose a lot of information.\nGive testdisk a chance and please inform if you succeed on it by commenting on the answers to your question.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Explaining \"-bash: No such file or directory\" Why would bash claim that a file doesn't exist when it clearly does?\n$ ls -l a\n-r-x------ 1 configurator configurator 3904 Dec  7 10:36 a\n\n$ file a\na: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.2.5, stripped\n\n$ ./a\n-bash: ./a: No such file or directory\n\n\nA: The problem likely isn't the file you're trying to run, but a file it depends on. Run ldd on the file to see if any of its dependencies can't be found.\n\nA: You get this error because you try to run a 32-bit executable on a 64-bit operating system.\nAnd the message No such file or directory does not refer to your executable file called a. Instead the error it refers to a helper program that's needed to run the 32-bit dynamically linked executable a.\nYou can find more information referring to static and dynamic linkage in this answer.\n", "Q: Saving live video streams Can anyone suggest software to download / grab live video streams from Ustream, Youtube etc. as they are streaming live?\nVideo downloading tools do not work with live streams.\n\nA: rtmpdump can capture live and not live rtmp streams well (plain rtmp and encrypted sessions too). But it looks like youtube is not using rtmp flash  streamin for their live broadcasts. Instead they come up with some other idea.\nCheck out Stefan Sundin's instructions on how to capture youtube live streams.\nFor Ustream rtmpdump should work. Helper scripts and instructions for Ustream can be found here or here.\n\nA: You could always just record it from your screen with SimpleScreenRecorder or something.

Ubuntu installation on windows PC I am installing Ubuntu alongside windows 7 because I believe Ubuntu is more secure (in terms of viruses, spyware etc).\nSo the computer will be contain both OSs. In such a situation, is Ubuntu still as secure as if it was the only OS on the computer?\nOr is it more vulnerable because viruses can get onto the Ubuntu partition when using Windows OS?\nThanks\n\nA: If you use WUBI, then it is a little bit less secure.\nIf you do a proper ubuntu install then it can be considered as safe as if it was alone. Technically it is possible for a virus running on your windows installation to make changes to your ubuntu installation. But it is a hard job because windows doesn't support the linux partitions used in ubuntu, so the virus have to contain a file system driver for those linux partitions. This is a very very unlikely situation and I think there is no such virus for windows which does such things.\nSo you can consider your ubuntu installation as safe as if it was alone. \n\nA: Just as secure as running it standalone. Windows cannot even access the windows partition without special software, and even if a virus did somehow find it's way onto there when you booted Ubuntu it wouldn't do anything, it would just sit there unable to do anything, Ubuntu being virus free doesn't just mean it won't get them, it means they just plain do not work.\n", "Q: Shape/Throttle an IP on the network (QoS) I've got a server running 12.04 set up as a modem. DHCP, NAT, etc.\nI need to know how to reduce the speed of a single IP on the network or set the speed of each individual IP.\nMy problem is my brother's GF keeps running torrents 24/7 , making my internet horribly slow. Asking her to stop hasn't worked, so now I need to control her connection.\nI think my options are either limiting her to, say 4mbps down and 300kbps up... or throwing QoS at her. I've no idea how to do either.\n\nA: I recommend reading the Linux Advanced Routing & Traffic Control HOWTO, in particular the examples on rate limiting a single host or netmask and a full nat solution with QoS.\nEssentially you have to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mark packets from that particular host in the PREROUTING chain of the mangle table\n\n*Set up some prioritizing or rate limiting traffic control\n\n*Make sure the market packets fall into the low priority resp. limited class\n\n\nUntested, but something along these lines (feel free to edit if you notice a mistake):\niptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -s 192.168.0.666 -j MARK --set-mark 1\ntc qdisc add dev ppp0 root handle 1: cbq avpkt 1000 bandwidth 10mbit \ntc class add dev ppp0 parent 1: classid 1:1 cbq rate 512kbit \\\n   allot 1500 prio 5 bounded isolated \ntc filter add dev ppp0 parent 1: protocol ip prio 1 handle 1 fw classid 1:1\n\nNotice that you can't directly use tc filter to filter on the IP of that host, since the tc filter applies after NAT, so it will see your public IP, which cannot be used to differentiate the packet.\nUsually you'd rate-limit upstream packets, since there you have the most control, and since on a common ADSL link the upstream is more easily saturated by p2p traffic. If you want, you can also attempt to rate-limit the downstream by deliberately dropping packets. You'd do that using another traffic control setup, this time for packets forwarded over the local network device.\n", "Q: How To Include Additional Software In preseed.cfg For Ubuntu Server 13.10 I am doing fully automated installation of Ubuntu Server (Saucy) 13.10 and also wants to include custom additional softwares,The Format of preseed.cfg is: \nd-i debian-installer/locale string en_US\nd-i debian-installer/language string en\nd-i debian-installer/country string NL\nd-i debian-installer/locale string en_GB.UTF-8\nd-i console-setup/ask_detect boolean false\nd-i keyboard-configuration/modelcode string pc105\nd-i keyboard-configuration/layoutcode string us\nd-i netcfg/choose_interface select auto\nd-i netcfg/dhcp_failed note\nd-i netcfg/dhcp_options select Configure network manually\nd-i netcfg/get_nameservers string 192.168.1.1\nd-i netcfg/get_ipaddress string 192.168.1.42\nd-i netcfg/get_netmask string 255.255.255.0\nd-i netcfg/get_gateway string 192.168.1.1\nd-i netcfg/confirm_static boolean true\nd-i netcfg/get_hostname string demo\nd-i netcfg/get_domain string www.demo.com\nd-i netcfg/wireless_wep string\nd-i mirror/country string manual\nd-i mirror/http/hostname string archive.ubuntu.com\nd-i mirror/http/directory string /ubuntu\nd-i mirror/http/proxy string\nd-i mirror/http/mirror select CC.archive.ubuntu.com\nd-i clock-setup/utc boolean true\nd-i time/zone string US/Eastern\nd-i clock-setup/ntp boolean true\nd-i clock-setup/ntp-server string ntp.example.com\nd-i partman-auto/disk string /dev/sda\nd-i partman-auto/method string regular\nd-i partman-auto/choose_recipe select atomic\nd-i partman-partitioning/confirm_write_new_label boolean true\nd-i partman/choose_partition select finish\nd-i partman/confirm boolean true\nd-i partman/confirm_nooverwrite boolean true\nd-i partman-md/confirm boolean true\nd-i partman-partitioning/confirm_write_new_label boolean true\nd-i partman/choose_partition select finish\nd-i partman/confirm boolean true\nd-i partman/confirm_nooverwrite boolean true\nd-i passwd/user-fullname string demo\nd-i passwd/username string demo\nd-i passwd/user-password password demo123\nd-i passwd/user-password-again password demo123\nd-i user-setup/allow-password-weak boolean true\nd-i user-setup/encrypt-home boolean false\ntasksel tasksel/first multiselect ubuntu-desktop\nd-i pkgsel/include string openssh-server build-essential juju ruby virtualbox kvm git openstack\nd-i pkgsel/update-policy select none\nd-i grub-installer/only_debian boolean true\nd-i grub-installer/with_other_os boolean true\nd-i finish-install/reboot_in_progress note\n\nI tried to include custom softwares juju,openstack by write them in the end of %post, \nBy this way:\n%post\njuju\ngit\nopenstack\nruby\n\nBut i got parsing error, Now i tried to include those softwares in pkgsel/include but again got error, Is there any way to fix this?\nCan i do this using late command?\n\nA: You haven't pasted the exact error, but one place to start looking is that the packages \"juju\" and \"openstack\" do not exist.

I am trying to figure out where to download Ubuntu for Android and it isn't appearing anywhere on this site. Please help!\n\nA: The Ubuntu for Android source code has not been released yet (and is non-trivial to integrate into an existing Android image, requiring some modifications to the graphics stack to share the HDMI port).\nWhat you can play with right now is Ubuntu Touch, which is a full phone OS rather than something that coexists with Android.\n", "Q: What is the purpose of ubuntu-vg partiton? So, I'm new to partitioning and recently I installed ubuntu 13.10. I followed several online tutorials on how to create disk partitions effectively and all of them said that after ubuntu is done installing, I should have three partitions - home, swap and root. I installed GParted and saw that I only have two partitions - boot and ubuntu-vg, which is a part of an extended partition. My question is is ubuntu-vg a replacement for mentioned partitions? If I will want to, say, dual boot ubuntu with windows in sooner future, is it dangerous to resize it or mess with it in any other way? Thanks in advance :D\n\nA: 'vg' is a Volume Group, used in Logical Volume Management https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lvm  and not needed for simple installations. However, there's nothing wrong with it, per se, and should you go dual-boot later, it will be no more problematic than standard partitioning.\n", "Q: Where is the command `gnome-display-properties` After upgrading from Ubuntu 11.04 to 13.10, the command gnome-display-properties is gone.

I put the ISO file on a USB stick and made it 'bootable' or whatever. When I restart my computer and hit F12 to go to the boot menu, there is no option to download Ubuntu from my USB stick. I tried going into the BIOS menu and then tried running the CD/DVD option and neither of those worked. Am I missing something? The USB stick should be bootable and ready to go with the Ubuntu 12 ISO\n\nA: That does not have to do anything with ubuntu itself, that means that your usb stick is not properly attached, or not recognized by bios.\nProblem caused by ubuntu could be, that usb is not bootable, and it then automatically switches to boot from hard disk, but it is recognized by boot menu.\n\nA: To make a bootable flash drive you do not just copy an iso file there. You need to use some program to write image to your usb drive. It can be done many ways. You can use THIS MANUAL as an example.\n", "Q: system variable for directory shortcut? Is there a way to create a variable CUSTOM_DIR, linked to the directory /home/user/folder1, \nIt is that not only in the shell, but for every program, process etc. The CUSTOM_DIR refers to that directory ? \nIt would be great if it's set only at an user login, and anyway in a file in the /home/user directory. \nI suppose that .bashrc file afflicts only shell, am I wrong ?\n\nA: You are so close! Depending on how you want to do it.\nApproach 1\nIf you want it to be in command line, then it's done via .bash_aliases and our Ubuntu .bashrc is already configured for that.  You will find .bash_aliases in your home directory ( ~/ or $HOME )\nIn your .bash_aliases file, enter each line for each alias you want to set up.  I.e.\n    alias myweb=\"cd /var/www\"\n    alias privfold=\"cd $HOME/secretfolder\"\n\nThat's for command line if you want to jump straight to a folder.  \nApproach 2\nAs for filesystem as itself.  Enter this:\n  cd /home/myhome\n  ln -s /var/www mywww\n\nThis will create a folder in your home directory at which this folder points to your /var/www (typical location for webserver).   'ln' is a symlink that ties between these two folders.\n", "Q: Celeryd not running at startup I ran sudo update-rc.d celeryd defaults\nAll good. \nI ran: \n/etc/init.d/celeryd start\n\nAll good. \nI restart machine.  \nAll bad.  \nsudo /etc/init.d/celeryd status\n\nceleryd not running (no pidfile)\nI'm a noob on linux and I don't even have the first idea of where to look to find some error messages.

Dash is a simpler shell which doesn't read the ~/.bashrc file and doesn't set the user@host command line prompt. You can check by looking in the /etc/passwd file, or using\ngetent passwd username\nand you can change the default shell to the more usual bash using\nchsh -s /bin/bash\nif you are logged in as the user whose shell you want to change, or\nsudo chsh -s /bin/bash username\nto change another account's login shell. To prevent this happening again, you can either specify the login shell on the useradd command line using the -s or --shell options, or use the higher-level utility adduser instead. \n\nA: The basic Bash prompt is just a variable named PS1. This variable is usually set up in the ~/.bashrc file. The bash shell reads that file when it starts and sets up the variable. If the PS1 variable is not set up in the .bashrc (or .profile) file, then it you will have no prompt. In your case the PS1 variable is set to $:\nexport PS1=\"\\$\"\n\nYou can experiment with the variable, e.g try:\n\n\n*\n\n*export PS1=\"\\u\\$\"\n\n*export PS1=\"\\u@\\h\\$\"\nYou will see how the prompt changes. Edit your bashrc file the way you want your prompt to be shown. For more info go here.\n\nA: as seen in another question, which solved it for me\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/1064774/212948\n\nAs shown on this Ubuntu wiki\npage, you should run\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure dash\n\nand select the option not to use /bin/dash as the default\nshell. Making the change this way will not only fix the symlink\n/bin/sh, but will also configure other parts of your system to\nbehave correctly, such as making sure that man sh points to the bash\nmanpage instead of the dash one.\n\n", "Q: How can I extract the data from a corrupted .docx file?

I can't chmod 000 for a folder in Ubuntu 13.10\n\nA: There is a manual page for chmod here.\nBasically, look at this table on that page:\n\nYou can change the tick boxes, so that different people have different permissions.\nOwner is the permissions on that file of the owner of the folder - usually the user that has created them - can be changed with chown.\nGroup is the permissions on that file of the group of the folder - can be changed with the chown or the chgrp commands.\nOther is the permissions on that file of everyone who does not fall into the above two categories.\nSo running chmod 600 /PATH/TO/FILE will change the permissions so that  only the owner can read the file, and write to it.\nYou can also do the same for folders, but by using chmod -R 600 /PATH/TO/FILE so the contents of the folder is the same as well.\nThe thing is, if you try entering it as 000:\n\nThen no one can access or write to the file, except root, and the owner if they change the permissions again. This can work, but there is not much point to it as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Anyone who is logged in as the owner could remove the file.\n\n*They could change the permissions back again, either by chmod, or by  & Properties\n\n*If they are not the owner of the file, you do not need to chmod 000 .., just use chmod 600 ..\nSo if you want to stop people accessing the file, encrypting the file with a password would be the better idea. So to stop people accessing a file or folder, open Archive Manager, and click New - create one that you can encrypt (under Other Options) - I use .7z, as then you can encrypt the file list to. Then type the password you want to use.\n\nThen you can add files:\n\nThen you have an encrypted archive with your files secure inside - though it can still be deleted... \n\nA: The owner of the folder will always have to have access.\n\nA: But I am able to do this in my SLES Box\nuser@DemoBox:/export/home/n/user : ls -l test\nls: cannot access test: No such file or directory\n\nuser@DemoBox:/export/home/n/user : mkdir test\nuser@DemoBox:/export/home/n/user : ls -ld $_\ndrwx------ 2 user EDC_EOO_OS 6 Dec 10 04:35 test\n\nuser@DemoBox:/export/home/n/user : chmod 0000 $_\nuser@DemoBox:/export/home/n/user : ls -ld $_\nd--------- 2 user EDC_EOO_OS 6 Dec 10 04:35 test\n\nuser@DemoBox:/export/home/n/user : lsb_release -a\nLSB Version:    core-2.0-noarch:core-3.2-noarch:core-4.0-noarch:core-2.0-x86_64:core-3.2-x86_64:core-4.0-x86_64:desktop-4.0-amd64:desktop-4.0-noarch:graphics-2.0-amd64:graphics-2.0-noarch:graphics-3.2-amd64:graphics-3.2-noarch:graphics-4.0-amd64:graphics-4.0-noarch\nDistributor ID: SUSE LINUX\nDescription:    SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 (x86_64)\nRelease:        11\nCodename:       n/a\n\n\nA: That way no one will have any access to that folder! You can hide it by adding . at the start of it's name. I believe chmod does not allow you to take all permissions away from the owner. \n", "Q: How can I get the option to install alongside Windows? Prior Ubuntu Desktop Install alongside Windows Vista failed due to power failure.  During installation and prior to failure, I got to the Installation Type and checked to install alongside Windows.\nI am once again trying to install, however when I get to the Installation type, the only choices I have are Replace Windows and Something Else.  I am not ready to replace/remove Windows at this time.  How do I get a clean install with all the Installation Types available?\n\nA: Do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*boot into windows, right click my computer and select manage. Under disk management remove all the Linux partitions being very careful not to remove the windows partition.\n\n*Remove the partitions to the point where windows describes it as un-allocated space.\n** Verify you can still boot to windows otherwise grub won't install properly. if you can't boot windows, boot into recovery mode with a windows disk and at the command line type bootrec.exe /fixmbr.\nOnce you get to the point where windows boots, you can re install Linux.\n", "Q: Raid controller question \"hardware RAID Array Maximum size: 2.3TB\" I am looking to get a raid controller for my ubuntu server (used as a media server with plex) I am looking to ger this http://www.sybausa.com/productInfo.php?iid=530 however, I am new to raid, and the sentence \"hardware RAID Array Maximum size: 2.3TB\"\ndoes this mean it can not take 2.3TB per disk, or it can not take more than 2.3tb in total. \nI am looking at using 4 x 2tb disks at RAID 5. \nMany thanks! \n\nA: The way they have it worded means 2 TiB for the whole array, but this appears to be a SIL fake raid card, which I believe supports arrays larger than that, but only 2 TiB per disk.  If you are looking for a real hardware raid, you should look elsewhere ( i.e. more expensive cards ).  If you don't need to dual boot with Windows and don't care about the slight performance advantage of true hardware raid, then you could use Linux software raid, which does support larger disks, and can be used with the built in SATA ports on your motherboard.\n", "Q: Delete all ubuntu desktop stuff from ubuntu server I have Ubuntu server VPS, I installed 3 months ago some packages to try to get a remote connection, without success. Anyway, now I'm cleaning some stuff from my server, the problem is that I found a lot of usefulness packages like Firefox, Thunderbird, ubuntu-wallpapers, unity 2-d, etc ... My question is, is there anyway to safe clean those packages that are related to ubuntu desktop version? Perhaps that there is some \"magic\" command.\nThank you very much for your help. \n\nA: The following command sequence removes the ubuntu-desktop metapackage and then all automatically installed, unneeded packages (i. e. nothing depends on them anymore).\napt-get remove ubuntu-desktop\napt-get autoremove\n\nIf autoremove doesn't do anything, then somehow all the dependencies of ubuntu-desktop are not flagged as “installed automatically”, which is required for autoremove to select them. You could set this flag for every recursive dependency (manually or with a script), but I don't think it's worth the work, if you don't experience problems related to desktop packages.\n", "Q: Virtualbox on Ubuntu /Windows XP viruses or security issues? I wanna install Windows XP in a Virtualbox on Ubuntu 13.10, I will install it only for being able to use a programs of the government for inputting taxes ( the Argentine government hasn't make programs for Linux yet) ,it doesn't use internet, I'd like to generate the file and then send it trought internet but from Ubuntu; and play Pes 2011 (it doesn't use internet too) . Do I need to install an antivirus or anything else in Windows? I'm afraid viruses can infect Ubuntu,though I won't use internet from Windows. \n\nA: Ubuntu vulnerabilities come from outdated programs. If you keep your computer up to date your system will be more secure. A virus* in Windows VM can not affect Ubuntu. \nYou can't play games like Pes2011 in virtualBox, but you can install Pes 2011 in Wine. Also you should try to run your taxes programs in Wine and PlayOnLinux first.\n\nA: XP is rather outdated, and not as secure as newer versions.It is also EOL in 2014, and you will not be getting security updates after that. While having AV is usually a good idea, a virus that affects your VM is unlikely to affect your main system in the current state of things. Crossplatform VMs are rare.\nHowever, to be safe, I'd probably get the XP system set up and up to date, then snapshot it. That way, you can roll back to a system which has a known state of being virus free. This would leave you the option of using a non resident malware protection like malwarebytes rather than a resident protection like MSSE (which I'd recommend). I'd also work as a limited user if possible since the reduced permissions means better security - it limits the damage a virus running under your account can do.\nYou could probably run the tax software in windows, print it with a PDF printer, and send the pdf to ubuntu to print via a shared folder.\n", "Q: how to make /usr/lib owned by root again I chowned -R username /usr/lib and now i cannot sudo or do any thing really due to sudoers.so belonging to username.\nHow do i fix this and make /usr/lib owned by root again?\n\nA: *\n\n*Reboot the system to enter grub. Select recovery mode. Enter root shell\n\n*Remount the system with read/write permissions: mount / -o rw,remount\n\n*Run chown -R root:root /usr/lib. Once done, reboot.\n\n\nA: Try with one of the following :\nsudo chown [USERNAME]:root /usr/lib\n\nOr\nsudo chmod 0755 /usr/lib\n\nUse option -R with chown if its just for recursive.\n\nA: It's very easy!\nBoot with Instalation CD (Ubuntu), and go to /media/ubuntu/(your disk Ubuntu), then execute:\nsudo chown root -R /usr/lib\n\n", "Q: How to make v4l2ucp's \"Exposure, Auto Priority\" persistent on reboot? My laptop's webcam has the common too dark issue, and what fixes it is using v4l2ucp and activating \"Exposure, Auto Priority\". The problem is, the setting reverts after every reboot. Any way to make it persistent? \n\nA: I figured it out myself, posting here in case someone stumbles upon this with the same problem.\nI figured v4l2ucp must be just a GUI for something that works with command line, so if I can find the command for auto exposure, I can run it on startup.\nI found and installed the command line utility v4l2-ctl with:\nsudo apt-get install v4l-utils\n\nReading its help with:\nv4l2-ctl -h\n\nI found it has a value called exposure_auto_priority which is used like:\nv4l2-ctl -c exposure_auto_priority=1\n\nAdd that to your startup applications and you're cooking.\n", "Q: Can we set the root without password? Suppose that I had set the root password before with ssh key. Hereinafter, I want to let the root without password. Is there a way to do that?\n\nA: In Ubuntu the root account has no password but is locked by default, so that you can not log in as root using a password.  If you paste your public key ( ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ) into root's authorized_keys file ( /root/.ssh/authorized_keys ) then you can log in via 'ssh' as root without needing a password.\n\nA: Yes you can set the root without password to SSH login without password, but it's highly not recommended, user other user then use su to become root.\n", "Q: gma500_gfx vs cedarview-graphics-drivers? I am using Ubuntu 12.04.3 Kernel 3.8.33 on an Intel N2600/GMA3600 Netbook. Ubuntu currently runs in 1024*600 resolution which is perfect for my netbook. \nHowever the graphic performance is very poor. I am stuck with Unity 2D and video playback is dreary. Glxgears reports framerates (<1) and CPU usage for glxgears is 100% (as reported by top). The driver in use is gma500_gfx.\nI read somewhere that the proprietry drivers in repositories can give hardware accelarated video playback and OpenGL ES support. However, the cedarview-graphics-drivers fails to install with kernel>3.2 and Xorg>1.1. \nI am planning on downgrading to Ubuntu 12.04.1, \nwhere these drivers can be installed ?\nWill it provide better video playback than gma500_gfx ?\n\nA: I have a similar 2600/cedarview netbook which is currently running mint 16 with the MATE desktop.  I've had xubuntu 12.04 and kubuntu 12.04 to 13.10 running on it but MATE has become my favorite GUI for a low powered machine.  It's faster than KDE (though you can set up KDE to run pretty well in 1Gb) and I just don't like XFCE.  And I won't run a non ubuntu desktop in ubuntu.  Mixing &  matching desktops is just silly.\nFirst off, I have to point out that you should not be using a gnome 3 or unity based desktop on cedarview based hardware.  Sorry, but that's all there is to it.  You don't get decent 3D acceleration and I seriously doubt you ever will.  I don't know where you read that such drivers exist in repos but ... all I can say is that there's a lot of very good info on ubuntu on the web and a lot of very bad too.\nFor example, there is a right way and a wrong way to get this gpu working in 12.04 and there are many, many things that point you to the wrong way and far fewer that tell you the right way.\nWhich is ... install 12.04 and keep updating until there's nothing left.\nThere's a reason that cedarview-graphics-drivers don't appear in the repos anymore.  Those drivers were moved upstream into the linux kernel and they're not appropriate anymore.\nMint 16 is based upon ubuntu 13.10 and it's still using the gma500_gfx driver.  That's not going to change.\nAccording to glxinfo | grep direct I have direct rendering, but according to glxgears I'm getting less than 150fps, which isn't good.\nThis doesn't actually bother me because it's a netbook.  I don't use it to play video, just for knocking around out of the home.  I can certainly understand how it'd be more of a problem for others.  But such a machine wouldn't play HD very well anyway even if the gma were well supported.  It's unfortunate that there are people who buy netbooks fully expecting to play 1080p video properly (not that you did) but they're out there.\nAnyway, there is absolutely no point trying to downgrade your 12.04 version.\n", "Q: Untrusted Application Launcher So I'm trying to create a desktop icon for an application, and I dragged it from the top-left menu (I think it's called Dash or something). I clicked on it and it says it is untrusted and refuse to execute it.\nI found out that I have go to Permission and check the checkbox saying \"Allow executing file as program\". However, when I open up the Permission dialog it says \"I am not the owner, therefore I cannot change those settings.\" Everything is disabled and I can't check it.\n\nWhy is this happening and how do I \"make myself the owner\"?\n\nA: *\n\n*Open a terminal with Ctrl + Alt +T then run this command: \ncd ~/Desktop\nsudo chmod +x sublime_text.desktop\n\nChange Desktop to whatever your desktop is called in your language. \nchmod is a command line command to change permissions, +x make it executable\n\n*or instead you can run: \ncd ~/Desktop\nsudo chown yourusername sublime_text.desktop\n\nchown is command line command to change file owner\n\nA: *\n\n*Open a terminal with ctrl+alt+T and type in the terminal: gksu nautilus\n\n\n*Enter your password when prompted and your file browser should emerge.\nThis will make you root until you close the file browsing window, which is necessary to edit the file (as you can see that only \"root\" has permission.\n\n\n*In here navigate to the file you want to edit.

I have been thinking about upgrading to 13.10, the current release of Ubuntu. I am running 12.04 LTS. I was wondering how I would do this without having to back everything up, or do I need to back everything up? Thank you!\n\nA: While backing up your files may not be necessary to upgrade your operating system, it is always recommended, as things can and do go wrong during upgrades. Instructions for upgrading your installation can be found on the official Ubuntu help site here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes\nYou should not skip upgrades (i.e. going directly from 12.04 to 13.10) unless you plan on simply backing up your data and doing a fresh install of Ubuntu 13.10. To avoid having to do a fresh install, you should upgrade to each \"in between\" version of Ubuntu (i.e. 12.04 to 12.10 to 13.04 to 13.10) but still, it is strongly recommended that you back up your data before proceeding with any upgrades.\n", "Q: \"E: Unable to locate package update\" when I try to update my system, why?

Done\nBuilding dependency tree       \nReading state information... Done\nE: Unable to locate package update\n\nIt just doesn't work! Isn't install update the text I should put after sudo apt-get to install updates on my Ubuntu system? If not, what command should I write?\n\nThis question is trying to address some common mistakes by users not used to the APT system and apt-get.\n\n\nA: APT tool apt-get has simple commands that you need to know before hand what they do, and in what circumstances use it.\nIf what you want is update your packages list, the correct command is:\nsudo apt-get update\n\njust that! You don't need to write anything else before nor after. Is just sudo + apt-get + update. Done.\nTo install packages or programs in your system, you first need to know the package name. If you don't know the package name is recommended you use a GUI (like Ubuntu Software Center or packagekit), search and install your program using it. If you know the package name then you only have to:\nsudo apt-get install package_name\nReplace package_name your package name. You can install several packages at once, just write them with an space between them. If you are still getting:\n\nE: Unable to locate package package_name\n\nThen try updating your list or reviewing the instructions you are following, maybe is just a typographic mistake. If name of that package is unknown for apt-get that is the error you will get.\nFor upgrading the packages that you already have installed, aka update all your system, you need to do:\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nNothing else. It will upgrade all the packages that you have installed in your system.\n", "Q: What is the power consumption difference between GUI and Shell? I was wondering if there is any difference in power consumption between regular graphic interface mode and command line shell mode. And if it is what is the difference? Could I use Ubuntu on the battery longer in shell then gui?\n\nA: Short answer: NO, simply switching to virtual terminal (VT) won't save you power.\nLong answer: It depends.\nThe power consumption of your PC depends on some factors:\n\n\n*\n\n*What power management techniques does your hardware possess?\n\n*What power management techniques does your OS/kernel possess? Can it use and use correctly the possibilities present in your hardware?\n\n*How much time are the hardwares (CPU, HDD, wifi, etc.) are in use on your system: If the load is small, then the OS/hardware can use their power saving techniques to reduce power consumption.\nIt is clear that switching to CLI will change nothing in regards to the first two points. Okay, that is in theory not 100% true, because if the kernel switches the graphics driver (from proprietary to FOSS) when you switch to VT, then the power saving techniques available to the kernel can be different. But this case is largely theoretical, because the open-source drivers have worse power management capabilities than the proprietary ones, and if you are using proprietary drivers you are advised by the manufacturer to turn off driver switching because the proprietary drivers don't handle that well. \nSo all is decided in the third point. If the load is smaller on your PC when you use the VT than when you use the GUI, then you are saving power (if the OS/hardware support it). But this is only because of YOU using less demanding programs, less features, not because of the switch to VT. You can put a high load on your computer even in VT, you can stress all your hardware there also (even the VGA can be stressed there too with some computation). And on the opposite, you can put minimal load on your PC in a GUI session also.\nSo to sum up, it is all decided on the programs you use on your PC, and how you use them, not on the switching to VT. \n", "Q: How do I unmute the sound?

More specifically, I want to know if when I put the Ubuntu OS on my flash drive if it is permanent or not. As in,can I delete the Ubuntu installation files after I install it on my computer and use it as a regular USB again? I just want to install Ubuntu on a unformatted hard drive and then be able to use my USB like normal again.\nSorry, I know I must sound very redundant. Thank you for the help.\n\nA: After installation, you can use Disk Utility to reformat the USB drive so that it will work like normal again. The method for doing so can be found in this thread How to format a USB drive?\n\nA: While everyone's answer is technically correct that you can reuse it, it is not always the best answer.\nYou really need another way to boot computer to make repairs or in an emergency. If not at home and system crashes a live flash drive install can let you keep working and probably access data on drive. Without a repair tool you are out of luck.\nIf dual booting with Windows you should buy another small flash drive and create another repair drive for Windows.\nThen for the data you may want on a flash drive buy a larger one, depending on how much data you have.\nAlso if you use the dd procedure to create flash drive you have to use dd to zero out MBR as the dd procedure does not create a standard MBR,only then can your create a new partition table and formatted partitions.\n\nA: Germar wrote:  \n\nNope. You can always reformat your USB again and fill it with\n  what ever you like.\n\nUnfortunately that's not my experience.  It seems that most flashdrives (including Kingston) can be made bootable once, and they will work OK,  but the problem comes when you try to reformat them ready for burning a new .iso on to them.   I've destroyed two flashdrives this way;  something (but I'm not sure what) happens to their boot sector and they become read-only and can't be reformatted.  I've tried a whole host of different tools to try and resurrect them without success.  \nI've posted some details of all this at this tomshardware page.     It seems that the boot sectors on different flashdrives are all different and proprietary,  and they react in different ways to having an .iso burned on them.  Some people have reported they've been able to successfully reformat and re-burn new .iso's on to their flashdrives,  so I know it's possible to do this with some brands,  but I need to know which ones.   Before anyone burns an .iso on to a flashdrive,  they should find out what brands allow this process to be recycleable and which ones don't.  \nIf anyone has info on this branding issue, please post it on the above tomshardware url or e-mail me directly on sleepy@zzjohn.co.uk.    Meanwhile I'm trying to find out which flashdrive brands support making them bootable,  and which ones don't.  especially since I've discovered the hard way that Kingston don't. \n\nA: This is not true, I used a generic 8 Gb flash drive as a boot for Kali and the space it took is not able to reformat, I've tried everything I've found online to remedy this and its stuck. I tried reformatting and making it a Ubuntu drive and it just boots to Kali again. So it appears I'm stuck with a Kali boot USB drive...\nEDIT: Delete the partition, reformat \nhttps://www.all4os.com/windows/properly-delete-a-partition-on-usb-drive-using-diskpart.html\n\nA: In most cases, all using a USB drive as a boot media does is reformat the drive to a normal file system, add a bootloader and copy files over. In most cases the drive's FAT32 which is pretty universal.\nIf you never intend to have the drive plugged in at boot, or your system dosen't have USB drives on top of its boot order, simply deleting all the files will sufface. Otherwise simply reformat the drive to your preferred filesystem.\nThe process of setting up a USB drive to be boot media dosen't affect its viability as a re-writable media in any way.\n\nA: Yes. Normally I create a primary partition on my usb and make it bootable. If you do that then you better reformat it again but if you just use a bootloader you can just delete it from your usb and use it as a regular usb. \n\nA: yes, you can use it as normal again. I just installed Lubuntu on my netbook using a flash drive. Open disks management (Lubuntu = Preferences> disks), and then in the list of devices, select your flash drive, then click the gear> power off. The next step, click the gear> edit partition ...> uncheck bootable> type = FAT (it was my choice)> Change. Then, in the dropdown list, select a quick> Type = what you want (ex = FAT)> Name = the name of your flash drive.\nSorry for my bad English, translated with google translate. Please fix if there any mistakes.\nMarco\n\nA: I am a Windows user, and I have met with this situation frequently.To revert back the pendrive to normal state, i.e., even when formatting the pendrive does nothing and the entire disk space is reduced to few MBs,then you need \n\n\n*\n\n*Get Rufus or similar usb bootable maker software\n\n*Get any windows .iso file\n\n*Make your pendrive bootable this time with the windows iso file and you're good to go.\n\n\nA: Nope. You can always reformat your USB again and fill it with what ever you like.\n\nA: you don't install anything on your computer (hence the defenition of a bootable USB drive) , and you can reformat the USB drive at any time; thus it is not permanent. \n", "Q: How do I route the output of a single program to a mic input? First, some context: I'm a part of a TF2 server that includes lots of micspam. I'm in the process of writing a guide on how to do this properly- namely using a media player and some form of audio pipe. On Windows, we achieved this by using Virtual Audio Cable or VB-Cable. I really haven't found any sort of equivalent on Ubuntu, at least none that worked for me.\nFor this, I want to know if there's some way to take audio from a single program, such as Banshee, and route the sound output into a mic input. Ideally, I'd like to be able to do this without changing sound servers.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: To redirect to mic input is not possible AFAIK, but fortunately it is not needed. What you have to do is just set up a new pulseaudio SINK which will automatically have a monitor SOURCE. No external programs needed, pulseaudio does the job. (Basically to accomplish such things is why pulseaudio was developed.)\nSo the question is whether you want to hear the sounds which you redirect to your new sink? (Play it on your speakers.) Or you don't.\nIf you DO want to hear what you are redirecting then follow the technique what I use for sending music over skype:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get the name of your default sink:\npactl list sinks\n\nIn the output search for the name of the sink. It will be something similar to this: \"alsa_output.pci-0000_00_14.2.analog-stereo\"\n\n*Run the following command with the appropriate change in the master= section to your above found default sink name:\npactl load-module module-remap-sink sink_name=secondary master=alsa_output.pci-0000_00_14.2.analog-stereo\n\n\n*Open the application FROM which you want to redirect sound and start playing the sound in it.\n\n*Open the application TO which you want to redirect sound and start recording in it.\n\n*Start pavucontrol (If you don't have it: sudo apt-get install pavucontrol)\n\n*While your applications are playing/recording sounds: In pavucontrol, on the Playback tab change the sink from what it is on (Built-in ...) to the remapped sink (Remapped Built-in ....) for your application. On the Recording tab make similar changes for your recording application: change it to something like Monitor of Remapped...\n\n*Still in pavucontrol on the Input devices and Output devices tabs: change Show: to All Input devices and All Output devices and make sure that the remapped sink and its monitor source is not muted and have enough volume.\n\n*After this your setup should be working.\nIf you want to make your new sink to be automatically setup when pulseaudio starts: Edit the /etc/pulse/default.pa file and add the following line with your default master sink name in it (You will need root permissions to edit the file, so use sudo or gksu)\n    load-module module-remap-sink sink_name=secondary master=alsa_output.pci-0000_00_14.2.analog-stereo\n\nPavucontrol stores our changes (or at least for me it does), so next time you won't have to redirect the sinks-sources in it. (But if it won't save it for you, then do redirect them when you need.)\nIf you don't want to hear the sounds what you redirect then use simply\n load-module module-null-sink\n\nin the appropriate places (without sink_name or master section) and change the redirections in pavucontrol similarly as you did with the remapped sink but now with the null-sink and its monitor. \n", "Q: I have a windows 8.1 and I would like to know how to install ubuntu 13.10 on it?

My own optimal plan is usually not so good a year or two later as things change.\nMy suggestion anyway is shrink Windows a lot. I prefer small system partitions so most activity is closer together on drive and larger data partitions. Not sure about your games and if they all can be in a separate NTFS or d: partition.\nFor Linux I would use generous 25GB for / (root). I keep /home inside root but have all data in data partitions both NTFS and Linux formatted including some normally hidden data like Firefox & Thunderbird profiles.

Recomended version of ubuntu, kernel and graphics driver depends very much on that. Anyway, if you don't have Unity, in most cases you can use native non-3D drivers.\n\n*As you would have a older notebook with low amount of memory, consider to make final tweeks about disk swappiness and other performance tweeks to extend your battery life. \nUbuntu can give you a great value in comparison with W Vista. \n", "Q: Ubuntu installation unsuccessful in Windows 8 I installed ubuntu from USB flash drive.

I am very new to Ubuntu.  If I use IDLE I am using Python 3.3.2+, whereas if I go the terminal and type python --version it says I am using 2.7.5+.  As these versions are not compatible with each other, I can not run code created in IDLE from the Terminal.  So how do I make sure that I am only using one version of python in ubuntu.\n\nA: Python 3 has introduced a number of backwards incompatible changes. That is why your python 3 code does not run without error when using the python command. To answer your question \"how do I make sure that I am only using one version of python in ubuntu\", you should note that the two python versions live in peaceful cohabitation. They can coexist. In a terminal just use the command python to run your python 2 code and python3 to run your python 3 code.\nIn response to Rahil's comment on why Ubuntu ships with two python versions:\n\n\n*\n\n*A lot of software was written for python 2 and is not \"ported to\" or adapted for python 3 yet. There is also some software in Ubuntu that still needs python 2. In the future this will most likely no longer be the case.\n\n*There are quite a number of python third party packages (bits of software that you can reuse in your own software or toolbelt). Not all of these packages have been converted to python 3 either. \n\n", "Q: knotes note location  \nI use Knotes to writes notes and then I like to put all those notes on my Desktop\nBut the problem is:\nEverytime I reboot my Ubuntu The location of notes stored on desktops changes and the note\nis shifted to places like behind the Dock or half part on the edge of desktop etc..\nHence everytime I log on to ubuntu I have to reset the position of the notes.\nWhy is this happening and How should I stop this strange behaviour of notes?\nI have tried reinstalling Knotes but it doesn't help!\nThanks you in advanced!\n\nA: Warning: Alternative software, not a solution ahead; you are warned!\nI would rather recommend to use Xpad, a much better software to store notes. knotes is probably optimized for KDE environment and may not work very well on Unity interfaces.\nTo start xpad when you reboot your system, do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type \"Startup applications\" on the dash and open the application\n\n*In the window that pops-up, click on \"Add\"\n\n*In th dialog box that pops-up, enter \"xpad\" as the name and xpad as the command and \"notes\" as comment and then click on \"Add\".\n\n\nA: Do you have Compiz running, and your KNotes are in Rich-Text mode?\nKNotes Rich-Text mode causes the KNotes to change size, in a way that messes up Compiz's placement of KNotes. (or at least that's what it looks like to me)\nIf you leave the KNotes in Rich-Text edit mode, and turn off Compiz, The Knotes Shrink vertically every reshowing of KNotes, but at least they keep their position for the most part.\nTurning off Rich-Text mode in KNotes fixes these problems, but you're left with plain text after each login.

To the OS it looks like 8 cores, so the distinction is probably not relevant here. Sorry. :-)\nOK, so the operating system can use the i7 to effectively do 8 things at once. But that assumes that it has 8 things at the one time to do. If it only has one thing to do, then it will only use 1 core.\nThis is where threading comes in to play. Programs can be written to use threads - GIMP and ImageMagick are two programs I know that do this. When they have a complicated task to do, they split to work up and execute it in different threads, which the OS assigns to different cores. Try setting ImageMagick to work on processing a really large JPEG, and you will see all 8 cores get busy.\nNow, I am not sure if gedit is multithreaded or not - but even if it is, the main work when opening a 70M file is processing the disk interrupts as the file is loaded, and I think that work gets restricted to one core.\nWhat can you do about it? Just get busy, multi task, have your computer do lots of things at once, then the load will be spread out over the cores.\n", "Q: Does terminal have quickedit mode? I like the quickedit mode in Windows cmd.

But to copy/paste from/to the terminal you'll have to use Ctrl + Shift + C and Ctrl + Shift + V respectively.\n\nA: There is already something equivalent to this: by highlighting any text (not just in the terminal, but in almost any application), that text is put into the xclipboard. You can paste it by clicking the middle mouse button. If you're using a touchpad with no middle button, Ubuntu should allow you to click both buttons simultaneously to simulate a middle mouse click.\nThis is distinct from the ctrl+c/ctrl+v clipboard you are probably used to.\n\nA: I recommend you install guake terminal (sudo apt-get install guake). It's great for usage and has many pretty features.

You simply write there the directory from/to which you want to upload files. (or just browse to that directory) e.g: /www/data\nYour remote site is where the FTP-server is.

How to do this ? I was using live iso (from usb) but it's very slow. I want to have no data on my computer every time when I turn it on, no browser cookies, no music, no downloads etc.\n\nA: You can just use the Guest account of a freshly installed Ubuntu. It will be reset every time you logout.\n\nA: As far as I know you can reset all settings of gnome and related things but if you are talking about package management and all then I think it is difficult!\nThe best way is to create two accounts One as Administrator and other as Student.\nDon't add this student user into any sudoers file etc.i.e don't give root access to student account So that These users will not be able to install or remove anything related to system.\nIf you want to clear all the settings and remove all the data from this student at the time of booting then you can write down the shell script for this and then add this shell script in startup applications.So everytime you reboot your PC this shell script will run and it will do the task!

What is the difference between GNOME, KDE, Xfce and LXDE desktop environments?\n\nA: Wikipedia has a comparison so you can look it up there. And the arch wiki has another too. Just read them through.\n\nA: these are all desktop environments, you can still launch the same applications but how you get there and what they look like is a bit different. With some desktop environments you can change the appereance a lot (like KDE) while others will hardly allow you to change anything.\nan other big difference is how much resources they will take from your system. If you have problems running Unity (default for Ubuntu) or KDE, XFCE or LXDE might run just fine. \nAs far as I know there is no connection between Gnome and the Mac OS.\n\nA: *\n\n*Unity is a nice 3D desktop environment designed for good performance on recent hardware. Unity is a graphical shell for the GNOME desktop environment. In 17.10 and later the Ubuntu Desktop uses GNOME as the default desktop environment instead of Unity. \n\n*KDE is an alternative lighter weight desktop environment to Ubuntu's default interface. Plasma is the default desktop interface for KDE. It includes an application launcher (start menu), the desktop and the desktop panel (often referred to simply as the task bar).\n\n*Xfce is a lightweight 2D desktop environment designed for better performance on older hardware.\n\n*LXDE is a minimalistic desktop environment, somewhat like Windows XP in look and feel. It is designed to run on legacy hardware which requires a desktop environment that has minimal system requirements.\n\n\nFor screenshots and information about the comparative system requirements of different desktop environments refer to How do I find out which version and derivative of Ubuntu is right for my hardware in terms of minimal system requirements?.  \n", "Q: Computer boots only to grub rescue mode I set up a dual boot with Windows 8 and Ubuntu.

Is there any package like Lamp to handle DNS, Email, Apache and other needed softwares for a web server? \nI'm looking for a software like Plesk and Cpanel. But an opensource one.\n\nA: AlternC: It is basically a great open source software, which is quite easy to install and use as well.\nAlternC is user friendly, and it's capable of managing large hosting services, and offers plenty of features. The licensed AlternC GPL provides automatic installation, configuration and web based control panels. Few of the web services provided by the software are domain control, ftp accounts, email configuration, website statistics, and you can literally do everything that cPanel offers… The documentation and user manuals are available in French, though the translations are available in English too.Om Thoke\nBaifox: It is yet another GPL control panel, which is great for managing hosting services. The unique feature of this control panel is that it is lighter than most of the other controls panels; it offloads the work from the server and does not disturb too much either. Hence, the performance of the server remains unaffected, and the CPU consumption low.Om Thoke\nYou may also take a look at ServerPilot.  ServerPilot is the best hosting control panel for developers and businesses running their PHP applications on cloud servers.ServerPilot\n\nA: I have tried these three systems, which are suggested by vultr.com for their VPS server subscribers - \n\n\n*\n\n*Virtualmin/Webmin - has the most functionality  \n\n*VestaCP - is the most fast and simple but has fewer functions  \n\n*Ajenti - is a bit complicated\n\n\nYou can see brief review and quick install steps here on vultr.com knowledgebase. \nBut they are not as end-user friendly as WHMCS/Cpanel. I can say they are convenient for experienced developers and webmasters. \nUpdate 2015-03-08: I have recently migrated several Cpanel servers to Virtualmin servers on Ubuntu 14.04, and the experience of setting up the servers, as well as migrating the cpanel accounts has been a breeze.

I have a bootable USB with ESXi 5 on it, does anyone have any tips on how to get the virtual machines installed on a Linux machine? This is something that I've never done before! \n\nA: My personal advice (as a professional systems administrator with a great deal of experience with virtualisation - both Ubuntu and VMware-based) is that if you even need to ask this question, you will need to hire consultants/experts to implement what you need.\nThere's a number of reasons for this, but first and foremost is the quality of the implementation. If this is the first time you've used virtualisation, Ubuntu or VMware (you didn't specify which), can you honestly guarantee that everything will be set up exactly right, when these servers are going to be used in a business environment? Can you be counted on to fix things when they go wrong and know enough about the set-up to troubleshoot?\nA few explanatory points:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu and VMware ESXi (aka vSphere) are both operating systems - you can use one or the other as your server's base operating system.\n\n*VMware ESXi is a hypervisor - a special type of operating system which means it can easily run other systems as virtual machines. You can use ESXi to run Ubuntu virtual machines, but not the other way around.\n\n*If you already have virtual machines that you were running on VMware and now you want to run on Ubuntu, ask yourself Why?\n", "Q: how to recover deleted ntfs patition with data entirely while installing ubuntu 13.04 I've installed ubuntu 13.04 onto my hp 2231tx computer. During installation all of my data was erased. I didn't know all of my three partitions would be deleted.\nI was shocked after finding out that all of my personal data was erased. I didn't know what to do to resolve this problem so I search google for an answer.\nI found a program called testdisk and I used it to recover about half of my data. Among this data weren't my personal photos and videos. Is there a way to recover the other half?\n\nA: In short: no, your data cannot be recovered, and please learn from this experience and back up your data regularly, and also make sure you fully understand what you are doing to your system before you start. By and large, if you erased your partitions, you've erased your data.\nThe more you use the drive and write data to it, the less change any retrieval application will be able to recover anything, so in all honesty, if you've formatted the drive, installed Ubuntu and booted into it, the chances of you being able to recover anything are almost nil - I'm surprised the tool you chose was able to recover any data at all.\n\nA: As others have said, you should use this as a learning experience about the importance of backups, particularly when doing anything risky like repartitioning the disk or installing a new OS.\nThat said, there's a chance that PhotoRec or a similar tool (there are some Windows-specific tools that are similar in broad strokes, but I don't have any URLs handy) may be able to recover some files. Be aware, though, that the longer you use the disk in its current state, the more likely it is that additional files will be irrecoverably damaged or erased. Thus, if you really need any files from that disk, STOP USING IT IMMEDIATELY! Use it only along with PhotoRec (or something similar), and be sure to use another physical disk as the recovery target.\n", "Q: Is Toshiba L50-A-1CU compatible with Ubuntu?

Actually, Toshiba disappeared from the list completely.\nCould someone confirm if Toshiba L50-A-1CU is compatible with Ubuntu?\n\nA: You are taking a risk, probably Ubuntu will work, but there are no guaranties. \nthe biggest risk I see by scanning the specs is that the laptop seems to has a nvidea optimus chip.

Gambas2 is a full-featured object language and development environment built on a BASIC interpreter.\nAccording to its creator, Benoît Minisini, Gambas does not try to be compatible with Visual Basic. Instead, Gambas is an improvement over VB6. He claims that Gambas' syntax and internals are far better than that of VB6:\nGambas is a free development environment based on a Basic interpreter with object extensions, a bit like Visual Basic™ (but it is NOT a clone!).\nGambas includes an interpreter, a compiler, an archiver, and a graphical Integrated Development Environment or IDE.Visual Basic Alternative in Linux\nTo download Gambas, and more info check out the website.\n\nA: I think Qt Designer is the closest you can get on Linux. \n", "Q: How are a Debian package's dependencies handled when it requires \"package A or package B\" for dependencies? In Ubuntu 12.04 (and Debian and the other Ubuntu versions), the nginx meta-package has dependencies listed on nginx-full or nginx-light.  What is the rule of which of those dependencies the system will try and install first?  Or is it just random?\n\nA: The meta-package provided as part of the nginx source package depend on either nginx-light or nginx-full.  What that means is when you install nginx the first of the dependencies listed will be tried, and if that is not available, it will try the other dependency.\nIn a rare case that a package's dependencies are missing, the package will fail, and apt will report that there's dependency issues.\nWith the nginx source package, though, the binaries for nginx-light and nginx-full are both part of the same source package, so doing sudo apt-get install nginx will fail unless you enable the universe repositories.  By enabling the universe repositories, nginx-light and nginx-full and the other variants of the nginx binaries (each having their own set of \"loaded\" nginx modules) will all be available, so you wouldn't run into this dependency issue, except when using nginx-extras or nginx-naxsi in place of nginx-light or nginx-full.\n", "Q: How to use Evince to loop over ps files in current folder?

Ubuntu Software Center is supposed to replace several utilities provided by other piece of software as can be seen in the rationale, but I can't find equivalent functionality in Ubuntu Software Center. Where I can find the development plans of Ubuntu Software Center and any other packages included in Ubuntu?\n\nA: For the general Ubuntu development you may want to check the Work Items Tracker. The amount included in this site is overwhelming since it covers all milestones on all aspects of Ubuntu.\nThe about page covers relatively what the site is: every aspect of development and bug targets of the meeting held by the different organs of Ubuntu, like Ubuntu Developer Submit, the MOTU meetings, and any other teams are captured, analyzed and tracked here.\nYour specific concern is somewhere, about here.

I'd like to know if this is possible, and what files I would need to download in order to do this.\n\nA: If you have the proper cables to successfully connect the Laptop HD to your Desktop Computer, then you should be able to boot from live CD and install Ubuntu on your Laptop Drive.\nI wouldn't think that Ghosting the drive would be necessary, as it sounded like you might have been alluding to.\nI think a simple live CD install would be fine for the laptop HD.\n", "Q: Fix my read-only pen drive to read-write My 8 Gb pen drive has suddenly change to read-only.

I'd like to set a password for the guest account.  How can I do this? (This question is not answered under the similar question in this forum, see below.)\nThe last time this was asked on this forum it was suggested that there was no reason to set a password on guest as it was equivalent to set up a new, regular account with a password.  It seems to me that this is not the same thing.  The guest account is secure by default, limits access to the file system and is self-cleaning, regular accounts are not.  By self-cleaning I mean that it leaves no loose files, no internet history, no potential viruses (I know, Linux has none), etc. since it all takes place in temporary space.  \nIt is good to have the guest account protected, too, in some situations. For example, if you live in a group house and have a common computer you may want to share freely with people you know but otherwise limit expensive internet access. Not everyone has the same situation.\nOne suggestion last time was to \"Open a terminal ... Then type passwd and the user name. So it should be passwd guest\"  This didn't work in my hands, even with sudo. Linux replied \"user 'guest' does not exist\"  Am I doing something wrong?\nIf Ubuntu is not designed to allow a password on the guest account then, in the spirit of Linux, if you think this is a reasonable thing to do, let's look for a workaround.  \nAnyone?\n(I'm a newbie, so let me know where I'm being naive.)\n\nA: The Guest Account exists as a created-then-destroyed-on-logout account that is limited in what it can do and exists without a password.  That is the purpose of a \"guest account\" - limited access, automatically-destroyed-on-logout.  It is not designed to run with a password.\nYou can create a \"guest\" account that you can keep as a normal user (not a guest user) by making a user named \"guest\" and setting a password on that, though, and then potentially restricting their access.  You can then disable the normal \"guest account\".  (The guest account system however will never have a password.)\n\nA: One suggestion last time was to \"Open a terminal ... Then type passwd and the user name. So it should be passwd guest\" This didn't work in my hands, even with sudo. Linux replied \"user 'guest' does not exist\" Am I doing something wrong?\nThat is because the guest user is only present when the guest account is used. It is created when you login as guest and it is deleted when you logout.\nAs others said, the guest account cannot be made easily password protected. To see why, just open the /usr/sbin/guest-account script. This is the script which is used for setting up or removing the guest account on login/logout. It contains the following code:\nif PWSTAT=`passwd -S \"$USER\"` 2>/dev/null; then\nif [ \"`echo \\\"$PWSTAT\\\" | cut -f2 -d\\ `\" != \"L\" ]; then\n  echo \"User account $USER already exists and is not locked\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n\nThe above snippet shows that before the script sets up the guest environment it checks whether there is a user named guest in the system. If it finds such a user it checks  whether it has a locked account. If it doesn't have a locked account then the script exits with error and the guest login will fail. So even if you decide to make a permanent guest user and setup a password for him, you will fail, because it won't have a locked account.\nWhat you can do is to investigate the script to know what is done in the setup and in the cleanup. Add a guest user to your system with a password. Write a script which mimics the guest-account script in the way you like.  Then just use the /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf file's session-startup-script and session-cleanup-script sections to specify your newly written script as the script which should run for this guest user. (for instructions with the lightdm.conf file look here ). But note that lightdm has a bug (?) and because of that the session-cleanup script fails to run when you directly shutdown from the account, so the guest should always log-out before shutdown.\n", "Q: How to understand / be aware of Ubuntu bug fixes?

I tried making a Hard Link to it, but for some reason it won't let me.\n\nA: Or instead you can try Dash... You can view a list of all installed applications or you can type in the names for quick search...\nUnity, the default UI since Ubuntu 11.04, has this wonderful Dash desktop search utility. You can access Dash by hitting the Super key (aka    key in Windows keyboard). \nAt the bottom of the Dash, click the application lens among others, as shown in the snapshot (in Ubuntu 12.04 you can directly access this using Super + A):\n\nClick \"Installed: See ... more results\" to view a menu list of all installed applications.\n\nClick to launch the application you want. Use arrow keys or the scroll bar to browse for more application down the list.\n\n\nOr you can create a bookmark for the directory. For this browse to the /usr/share/applications directory and in there press Ctrl + D and the bookmark will show up in the Nautilus' side bar (use F9 to toggle side bar visibility).\n\n\nA: We probably never need to open the directory /usr/share/applications under normal desktop usage, beacause all installed applications can easily be accessed through the Dash.\nIf for other reasons we often need a quick access to /usr/share/applications we may want to bookmark this location in Nautilus.

It worked all fine, but after a while, unity starts to use the LXDE icons in the panel at the top, and the menus are somehow smaller (see the screen shot). Does anybody know why this is happening or what I can do?\n\n\nA: Since all of these DEs are using the same user, some might use the same paths for e.g. icons, which would explain why you are seeing the same icons in the some DEs.\n(I think .icons is used by probably more than one DE).\nNo idea, though how to seperate them.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu on Acer Aspire V5-573G-54208G50AKK: nothing happens I have this brand new Acer Aspire v5-573g-54208g50akk laptop. I started the preinstalled Windows 8 and then changed the boot priority to USB. But right after I choose Install Ubuntu or Try Ubuntu on the menu screen, the screen goes black and nothing happens. \nI used Universal-USB-Installer-1.9.4.5 to create a bootable USB stick.

I can go and and play with the boot orders all I want but my computer will always read my hard drive first. What do I do to get Ubuntu on my computer?\nComputer Info ------>  http://instagram.com/p/hrCjIQLa8a/\nComputer Info ------>  http://instagram.com/p/hwJ11WLa8j/\nIt would be great if someone could help me figure this out!\nYou guys rock....\n\nA: First make sure in BIOS that you have USB option boot-up above Harddrive or simply put HDD all the way down. \nSecond use unetbootin for writing image into USB stick.\nThat should do it. \n\nA: I guess you want to boot from a Live USB. So what you have to do is to plug in your Live USB, then turn the computer on, enter BIOS and check how is your USB stick read/considered by BIOS. Sometimes it is not considered/recognised as a Removable Device but as a Hard Disk Drive, so enter Boot tab and check if your USB is recognised as a HDD, if it is so, then set it as first HDD (place it at the top of the HDD list, 1st. priority). Save and exit.\n", "Q: Wireless card not working (Atheros 9287) I installed Ubuntu 13.10 some days ago in my Desktop, which has installed a TP-LINK WN881ND. The problem is that Ubuntu don't find any networks to connect, even though there's, at least, 5 networks in my region - the other OS (Windows 8) detects the board. \nIs there any solution for this? I've been searching for a solution for weeks and no one seems to solve the problem.\nNote: My network access is purely based on wireless, so I can't access the internet on Ubuntu, just on the Windows. \nInfo:\nModel: TL-WN881ND\nChipset: ATHEROS 9287\nEdit\nThanks to Julian, now I can see some of the connections. However, the one that I use in home doesn't showed up.\n\nA: Did it work in 13.04? I had a similar problem with 13.10 (worked fine in 13.04), but with a different wireless card (Ralink RT3290). The solution was to upgrade the Linux kernel to 3.12 from 3.11. The instructions given in this answer work fine. I also didn't have an Ethernet to get the .deb files. I used another machine and transfer them with a USB. Worth a try?\n", "Q: Wireless network adapter not working on Ubuntu new Ubuntu user here\nI have a dual-boot system with Windows XP and Ubuntu (I don't remember which version exactly, but it's fairly new). I have a wireless network adapter (from Cisco, connected by USB port) that works just great on the Windows side of my system, but I don't know how to get it working on the Ubuntu side. There is no problem with the adapter or the computer (as far as I'm concerned); I'm just not familiar enough with Linux and Ubuntu to get it up and running. Any suggestions?\n\nA: go to \"software & updates\" from the ubuntu dash, go to the additional drivers tab (furthest to the right), you should see a disabled driver that should be the one related to your network adapter. Enable it.\n", "Q: Fatal server error: no screens found I am trying to install a new graphics card (Nvidia GeForce 6800 GT) but am having problems.\nWhenever I boot I get to tty-1, and startx gives me a \"Fatal server error: no screens found\".

The dd command works under all\nLinux distros and other UNIX like operating systems too. A master boot\nrecord (MBR) is the 512-byte boot sector that is the first sector of a\npartitioned data storage device of a hard disk.\n\nMBR Total Size \n  446 + 64 + 2 = 512 \n  Where, \n  446 bytes - Bootstrap. \n  64 bytes - Partition table. \n  2 bytes - Signature. \n  512 vs 446 Bytes \n\nUse 446 bytes to overwrite or restore your /dev/XYZ MBR boot code only with the contents\nof $mbr.backup.file.\nUse 512 bytes to overwrite or restore your /dev/XYZ, the full MBR (which contains both\nboot code and the drive's partition table) with the contents of $mbr.backup.file.\nThe dd command to copy the MBR (identically sized partitions only) is as follows:\ndd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb bs=512 count=1\nThe above command will copy 512 bytes (MBR) from sda to the sdb disk. This will only work if both discs have identically sized partitions.\ndd command for two discs with different size partitions:\ndd if=/dev/sda of=/tmp/mbrsda.bak bs=512 count=1\nNow to restore the image to any sdb:\ndd if=/tmp/mbrsda.bak of=/dev/sdb bs=446 count=1 \nThe above commands will preserve the partitioning schema.\nThe Linux sfdisk command can make a backup of the primary and extended partition table as\nfollows. It creates a file that can be read in a text editor, or this file can be used by sfdisk to restore the primary/extended partition table. To back up the partition table in /dev/sda, enter:\nsfdisk -d /dev/sda > /tmp/sda.bak\nTo restore, enter:\nsfdisk /dev/sda < /tmp/sda.bak\nThe above command will restore extended partitions.\nTask: Backup the MBR and Extended Partitions Schema.

Why is xterm being displayed in the env var?\n\nA: It has the same reason why almost every webbrowser (FF,IE,Safari,Chrome,...) uses Mozilla in their User Agent String.\nThe TERM variable set to xterm only means that your terminal is compatible with the xterm terminal (has the same capabilities), so the system can treat it and communicate with it as it would with an xterm.

I've decided to go ahead and make the change to Ubuntu; and based strictly on a first-ever positive experience with the USB Ubuntu Desktop Trial.  All seems okay, finally, as far as hardware and drivers (Dell Intel board) under the default install.  Presently running Win7pro; and I haven't got a clue: Will the installer do everything for me, or do I need to learn a bit of the command prompt coding that I keep seeing here on the forum?  I recall learning all Dos5 (cmd prompt) within a few hours, but how deep is Ubuntu Desktop?  Any pointers or links would be appreciated; and thanks in advance.\n\nA: As a Ubuntu newbie myself I can only share my experience thus far. The Ubuntu Software Center helps for managing software without working with the command prompt. While I'm not qualified to make this statement, avoiding the terminal altogether isn't an option. As I've learned more commands and shortcuts, my speed of interaction has increased. \nThe Ubuntu Desktop has a lot of depth to it, so it really depends on what you want to do. For example, if you mostly surf the web and use simple programs like word processing and playing music, you can avoid using the terminal.\nThe Installer will get you set up with most of the basics, past that you can find a lot of other programs in the Ubuntu Software Center. \n\nA: If you install from Live CD/USB it should do everything for you (unless there is a problem, which is rare if the hardware is fine in the Live USB version).

This is because percona-server-server-5.6 depends on libdbd-mysql-perl, which depends on libmysqlclient18. This is documented in percona server bug 1407889.

I bought the computer (HP envy M6) from a pawn shop under the impression it had Windows 8 installed, with a duel boot version of Linux. \nNot the case at all. It is running Kubuntu KDE Desktop. \nCan't figure out where the version is. And only kubuntu. \nHere's the kicker. Every time I try to do a recovery mode boot, absolutely nothing happens. Besides the system freezing up. So, sorry for going off on a little tangent there.\nThe reason I need to boot into recovery mode, is so I can reset the admin password, then uninstall kubuntu. \nHow can I resolve ?\n\nA: Welcome to Linux (be it your choice or not, you're still welcome :P ).\nIf your goal is to uninstall KUbuntu I will be the first to inform you that you do not need to go through the effort of resetting the password. You can simply overwrite it with whatever OS you choose.\nIf you'd like to know how to install a fresh copy of KUbuntu (or any Ubuntu variant) I'd be happy to help. But even if you choose a different OS I'd still recommend a clean wipe when first purchasing a used computer. You never know what's on it (virus, child porn, etc).\n\nA: I tried to just run my Win7 disk, along with various other tidbits that would change anything on the system (network setup, adding a printer, so on and so forth.... whole reason I'm trying to remove Kubuntu in the first place, because it is a major p.i.t.a.) and it said i need admin capabilities. So, Logically I figured that I had to remove the password for the root user and / or remove the account completely from the computer and just boot as a root user. Tried both, neither worked. i have a slight theoretical knowledge of Linux, but no knowledge of actually using the system (besides fedora 17... and that was just to brute force wifi. lol) \nI've tried every variant of the passwd command i could think of, nothing seemed to work. (e.g. (x's being the username): passwd -d xx xx, passwd -d Xx Xx, passwd xx xx -d passwd Xx Xx -d.... also including sudo before each variant, just incase... you get the idea... lol) Every time, Without fail, i get this:\nUsage: passwd [options] [LOGIN]\nOptions:\n  this is a long list of boring letters and crap explaining different commands. \nSo. if there is any way to just wipe the computer or something to that effect that can make this go away, i would be okay with just doing that. Short of smashing it, or covering it in neodymium magnets, because i have already disapproved of those.... lol.  Any ideas would really be welcome... \nedit this was supposed to be a comment, not an answer\n", "Q: linux-headers uname mismatch The headers I have in my /usr/src are linux-headers-3.2.0-57-generic and linux-headers-3.2.0-57-generic-pae, but \nuname -r\n\nreturns \n3.0.0-12-generic-pae\n\ncat /proc/version agrees with uname.\nI downloaded the linux source.

This will help diagnose the issue with the update-manage, but that's mostly tangential to your kernel problem since that updates via apt. Did you recently do a distribution upgrade? \n\n*Additionally a listing of sudo dpkg -l. You'll want to try to trim that down to packages that seem relevant. I don't have a shell handy or I'd grep it out for you. Try headers , linux, etc.\n\n*Additionally, have you rebooted since your last apt-get upgrade? If not, the upgrade may not have taken effect yet since the kernel needs may need to be brought down to update.\nOlder kernel versions can be removed from your system using your regular package management preferences (apt, synaptic, etc). This will ensure you are running the newest version.\n", "Q: How to add ohci_pci to initram Hello i just downloaded the ubuntu 13.10 and installed it on my computer. Rebooted and it wanted to me to unlock a disk with the passphrase i put. I noticed my keyboard wasn't working and i went to google on my laptop. Eventually i came to 1 post of my hour search that said anything to help me.\n\"From a live CD you should be able to open your encrypted root, then set up a chroot there and update the initramfs on the boot partition\"\nNow i booted up the live cd and i went into \"try ubuntu\" so i could try and get a console window open and figure this out.

Could anyone help me out im just trying to get my keyboard to work so i get finally just get into the desktop without using the \"Try ubuntu\" with the cd\n\nA: OK, let me try to decipher a bit.\nYou installed Ubuntu 13.10 by erasing your entire computer and installing from an Ubuntu disc.\nAfter the installation, when the computer was booting up, you were prompted for a password.\nQuestion 1: Is this the first time you were prompted for a password or has this always happened when you turned the computer on\nQuestion 2: Did you select the 'encrypt your home directory' option during installation?\nAfter you entered the pasword (which I'm assuming you used your keyboard to do) you entered Ubuntu and discovered your keyboard was not working.\nQuestion 3: Do you have a wireless keyboard?\nDuring your search (which was to attempt to fix your keyboard) you discovered a post relating to initramfs.\nQuestion 4: What made you believe this post was relevant to your keyboard?\ninitramfs is used for several purposes, but most commonly it is for booting your OS from a RAM disk. I don't think this applies to your situation, so we're going to skip the rest of that paragraph.\nSo your goal is to have a clean working copy of Ubuntu. Good news, that's not terribly difficult since you're OK with wiping your computer. My first suggestion however is to switch to a simple keyboard if you have one. No wireless, USB preferably, without any fancy gaming buttons or screens. If you don't have one of these available we can try other options, but nearly all simple USB keyboards work out-of-the-box. (To be honest, nearly all keyboards work out-of-the-box, but for the sake of simplicity lets try to reduce variables).\n", "Q: How do I boot to console with Refind?

Low Graphics mode almost works, except I don't have a mouse and no keyboard controls seem to work, so I can't click through options. \nThe other options never actually drop me at a prompt.\n(I tagged the question with Refit, but I am actually using Refind). \n\nA: If you're booting kernels directly with rEFInd, you can hit F2 or Insert to see a list of boot options laid out in the /boot/refind_linux.conf file. If none of them work, you can highlight one and hit F2 or Insert again to open a line editor that enables you to edit the options passed to the kernel.\nIf you're booting from rEFInd into another boot loader, such as GRUB, you'll need to use that boot loader to pass options to the kernel. In GRUB, you'd do this by selecting the kernel from the menu and hitting the \"e\" key to edit the options.\nEither way, I can't say precisely what options you should pass, because it's not clear what's wrong with your system or what options might help. As a starting point, single will boot into single-user mode, which should disable the GUI and enable you to fix things if you're sufficiently skilled with text-mode commands. (This is one of the options that rEFInd will probably provide by default, although this depends on the /boot/refind_linux.conf file.) The nomodeset option will get past some common video problems.\nIf you need more help, I recommend you post more details, such as precisely what is and is not working.\n", "Q: Photoshop looks terrible in 13.10 I have been using Photoshop CS2 for years on various versions of Linux and Ubuntu. In recent years, I've found that installing it with PlayOnLinux has had the most consistently reliable results.\nHowever, on a fresh install of 13.10, the Photoshop interface looks terrible. The fonts are clunky, and in the image below, it's not an image of a white box on a black backround with a square drawn in a black line. It's actually just a plain white image. The surrounding black area is where ordinarily Photoshop is supposed to be a neutral gray canvas, and the black square is a selection area, which is supposed to be a dotted line.\nHow do I get Photoshop's proper interface, as I've had with every version of Linux and Ubuntu previous to this?\nHere is a screen grab:\n\n\nA: You can fix fonts by installing ms fonts. Open your software center and search for them.\nBy the way looking for review of application in winehq is also good idea.so that you can know what's the problem is & if somebody did provideed any solution you can use that.\nBottom line is look at winehq also.\n\nA: The problem turned out not to be the latest version of Ubuntu, but the latest version of Wine.\nI reinsalled Photoshop following the instructions on this web page, with the additional step of selecting an earlier version of Wine. Current version of Wine is 1.7.x, but I used 1.6.2, and now Photoshop looks right.\nHere's how Photoshop looks when it's displaying correctly:\n\n", "Q: how to combine partitions I have one partition that is full and about 17gb of unallocated space which I would like to combine. When I try to unmount the partition I get an error that says could not unmount. Is there any way of doing this ? \n\n\nA: You can't unmount a root(/) partition.Because your running ubuntu was using it.Once you logged in into ubuntu,automatically its root partition will be mounted.\nIf you want to  unmount /dev/sda1 partition then you have to run live-disk.\n\nA: You can think of the root filesystem (/) as the C: drive in windows. It contains (unless you tell it otherwise) nearly all of the operating system files. In order to do any operations on the partition mounted on / you need to unmount the partition. To unmount the partition you have to stop using all the files on the partition. To stop using your operating system files you need to shut down your computer.\nSo how might one do this? Well, we could use a different operating system. A Linux live CD is an entire copy of Linux compressed onto a CD. When you boot it, it creates a root partition in your RAM, instead of your hard drive. This allows you to play with your hard drives partitions (including /dev/sda1) unencumbered. \nThere are of course other methods as well, for example you could install Linux on a second hard drive and attach that to your computer. Or you could network boot your computer, which works much like the CD but instead it uses a TFTP server.\nHowever there is one other thing that is going to get in your way, even if you use a Linux live disk: your swap space. The partition /dev/sda2 (and the swap partition /dev/sda5 that it contains) will prevent you from expanding /dev/sda1 into the unallocated space. Thankfully, it is easier to stop using the swap space. You an turn it on and off momentarily with sudo swapoff -a and sudo swapon -a, however that is not the full solution. Once you turn the swap off, you need to move the swap partition. If you move your swap partition, you must tell Ubuntu that you did so. \nThis can be done in the file sudo vim /etc/fstab. There will be a long string followed by swap that will look like the line below. This is where you tell your computer where the swap to use is. After you move your swap, you need to get the new string to use here. This can be obtained using lsblk -f.\nUUID=4209c845-f495-4c43-8a03-5363dd433153  none      swap      defaults              0      0\nSo the full procedure looks like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot a live CD, or another OS.\n\n*Turn off the swap, if the OS automatically started using it\n\n*Delete swap and extended partition\n\n*Recreate swap elsewhere (and extended partition if you want)\n\n*Update /etc/fstab\n\n*Extend /dev/sda1\n\n*Reboot\n\n\nNow there are things that can wrong in this process. Namely, you could mess up your /etc/fstab or your /dev/sda1 can get corrupted. The first is not really a big deal, as you can always boot a live CD and fix it. There's a good chance your computer will actually boot fine with an error on the swap line anyway. The second is a much bigger concern. Modern tools are pretty good at expanding partitions, but to be safe ALWAYS BACK UP THE DATA ON THE PARTITION / DISK YOU ARE EDITING.\nSources:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/fstab#UUID\n", "Q: How can I install the alias command?

I tried sudo apt-get install alias but this did not work. \n\nA: alias is actually built in to your shell environment (which is bash by default). To learn more about it, run man bash and then search for the alias builtin by typing /alias<ENTER>. (/ to tell man to search again).\nA few tidbits I have come to learn about alias:\n\n\n*\n\n*To run a command in its original form, run \\command\n\n*Aliases do not work in shell scripts\n\n*Functions are preferred to aliases in most cases due to the higher flexability, but aliases are still useful for simple renames or common switches\n\n*Add your aliases to the end of your ~/.bashrc (or ~/.zshrc, or whatever)\n\n\nA: To make an alias just add the following line at the end of ~/.bashrc\nalias <commcnd>='/path/to/executable'\n\nOr,\nalias <command>='some command -option'\n\nFor example to use rm -i as an alias say,rr, just add the following line at the end of ~/.bashrc\nalias rr='rm -i'\n\nNext run the following in terminal,\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\nNow onwards when you run rr filename it will implied as rm -i filename\nTo know if you set an alias try the following in terminal,\ntype rr\n\nOutput will be like,\nrr is aliased to `rm -i'\n\nHope these would help.\n", "Q: Explain: eval `dircolors /path/to/dircolorsdb` Would someone be able to explain to me what this line does.\nI understand that eval creates a command by concatenating arguments.

Simply remove the default SSL configuration from the sites-enabled folder using sudo rm /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default-ssl and Apache should start up no problem. To re-enable the ssl site after you've adjusted the configuration you can run sudo ln -s /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default-ssl.\nThe second answer is the correct answer, which is to take a good look at the Apache documentation to determine why your configuration is incorrect. Because the values in your error log look like the defaults from a fresh Apache install I included the first answer, but after you do the above you should dedicate some time to reading the documentation. You will learn a lot and will find out why there was no snakeoil.pem file and what a snakeoil certificate means.\nYou can find the general documentation here: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/ \n(or http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/ depending)\nYou can find general configuration documentation here: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/quickreference.html\nYou can find the mod_ssl documentation here: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/ssl/\n\nA: It looks like You have forgotten sudo:\nsudo service apache2 reload\n\n\nA: You need to create a SSL certificate for your server and link the SSLCertificateFile (a .crt-file) and SSLCertificateKeyFile (a .key-file) to your certificate and certificate key.\nThis is done in the configuration file which Apache reads on startup.

If you have GPT partition tables, use gdisk or better parted. That's what the error message is trying to tell you.\n\n*Linux doesn't use drive letters.\n\n\nTo answer your question:\nYes it's normal that the drive or partition where the Ubuntu root filesystem resides is not shown in the launcher as a removable disk drive or physical drive. Use Nautilus (the \"Files\" application) to browse your computer and files.\nYes you are right, \"filesystem\" in Nautilus is the drive where Ubuntu is installed on. When filesystems are mounted via the /etc/fstab file they will not show up (with some exceptions like the /media location) as a icon in the launcher or physical drive in Nautilus.\n", "Q: How can I install Origin software I need to install \"Origin\" software for graph plottings, analysis, etc. It is basically windows supported.

How can I save licence file in C drive / installation???\n\nA: you can find it in the home directory under .wine a hidden directory.

I know in Nautilus 3.6 the keyboard shortcuts can be changed in ~/.config/nautilus/accels, however in 3.4 that file does not exist. Is there another file in version 3.4 that I can use to edit the keyboard shortcuts?\n\nA: I believe I've figured it out:\nThe keyboard shortcuts are in ~/.gnome/accels/nautilus.\nThe shortcuts appear like this:\n; (gtk_accel_path \"<Actions>/ShellActions/TabsMoveRight\" \"<Primary><Shift>Page_Down\")\n\nTo change a shortcut, modify the final quote section to the keyboard shortcut you want, and then remove the semicolon at the beginning. For example, if you wanted to change the above shortcut from Ctrl + Shift + Page-Down to Ctrl + Shift + Right, then change the above line to:\n(gtk_accel_path \"<Actions>/ShellActions/TabsMoveRight\" \"<Primary><Shift>Right\")\n\n", "Q: The best LAMP Stack with a GUI for Web Dev I'm a spoilt windows user and always have used a WAMP stack with a GUI that allows me to start or stop apache and mysql services.

To install \nsudo apt-get install phpmyadmin\n\nWith this you can manage MySQL database in GUI way.\n\n*To have Apace GUI you can use rapache , with this tool you can manage both local & remote connections.\n  sudo apt-get install rapache\n\n\nA: To the best of my knowledge, phpMyAdmin doesn't allow for the starting/stopping of the mysql service. The MySQL Workbench app is a GUI and does allow for remote MySQL Server administration, including starting and stopping the server and many other functions. I run it on my Ubuntu workstation for running queries, creating dbases and tables, user admin, and managing backups of mysql.\nThe command line is actually easy to use for starting and stopping services like Apache and mysql:\nsudo service apache stop will stop the process.\nsudo service apache restart will restart the service (loading any new configs).\nsudo service apache start will start the service.\nReplace apache with mysql in the command for the same functions.\n\nA: I concur with douggro as I am a fan of command line.  However, there is python-based app that I use it with so much benefit for my other purposes when using my server.  You could run this app right off your browser even if apache is not up.\nWebmin\n wget http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/webadmin/webmin_1.660_all.deb \n sudo dpkg -i webmin_1.660_all.deb -y\n\nSince you are using WAMP stack, this probably is beneficial for you as well -who knows.\nUsermin\n wget http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/webadmin/usermin_1.560_all.deb\n sudo dpkg -i usermin_1.560_all.deb -y\n\nYou can control MySQL and even more functions.

Using the Live DVD you can only do a fresh install of 13.10 (Back up suggested). If you really want an upgrade instead of a fresh install then you have to upgrade to 12.04->12.10->13.04->13.10 For more information visit https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes \n\nA: I'd highly recommend fresh install instead of upgrading.

Ubuntu does not show the 101GB (NTFS in which Windows is installed) partition in the devices and gparted shows an exclamation sign beside this particular partition, asking to run chkdsk /f on windows and rebooting twice (this was not shown while I was on LiveCD) but I am able to successfully mount this partition using terminal.\nMore info (if it may help with another question): Initially the /home was around 246GB and I shrank it to 146GB and installed windows in 100 GB (logical partition). \nLater when I got to know that windows won't boot from logical I managed to move that 100GB (after deleting it) out of extended by moving the 100GB unallocated space to bottom and decreasing the size of extended partition.\nI installed windows in this (now) Primary partition and repaired grub. But grub didn't show windows loader option. So I again repaired windows boot loader. Now here I got two windows options, Windows 8 and windows 8 on volume6. The earlier is the option for the windows which I earlier installed when that was a logical drive. My (second - it is not related to Ubuntu though) question is why and how is windows boot loader is getting info about the previous installation of windows as I had deleted the partition later.\n\nA: This brought so much memory for me from the past which often happened to me.  \nThe fix that worked for me: use your installation cd and start the system off from it.\nSelect the option from menu, \"Rescue the broken system\"\nYou will go through the cycle of series of questions which it would lead you to partition section.

I can't get from you question whether are you able to boot into ubuntu after you did a boot-repair from the Live CD? If you can do that, then do it.

I have installed smoothly PTR 6.0.1 according to this site (How do I run Cisco Packet Tracer 6.0.1?), but when I want to run it this error appears:\nPacketTracer6: error while loading shared libraries: libQtScriptTools.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nI have Ubuntu version 13.10. \nCan somebody help me with this? Thanx.\nEDIT:\nHello, so I have installed this libqt4-scriptools:i386 library and now this error appears:\nPacketTracer6: error while loading shared libraries: libQt3Support.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory.\n\nI find this library here:/usr/local/PacketTracer6/lib/libQt3Support.so.4\n\nA: PacketTracer6 tries to load a library called libQtScriptTools.so.4, but cannot find it. This usually is caused by one of two things.\n\nLibrary missing\nThe first, more likely cause: The library is not installed. Luckily, the fix is easy.\nRun\nsudo apt-get install libqt4-scripttools:i386\n\nThat will install the 32-bit-version of the library, which is necessary because Cisco ships a 32-bit version of PacketTracer6 only.\n\nProblems with the library path\nThe second cause: The library is installed, but PacketTracer cannot find it. In order to work around that, you could run \nLD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libQtScriptTools.so.4 /path/to/packettracer\n\nafter replacing the paths with the real ones from your system.\n\nUpdate: Since PacketTracer also seems to need libQt3Support.so.4, but doesn't use the version it ships with, you will have to install libqt4-qt3support:i386 as well. \n\nA: The following lines of code can be found in the inside the \"install\" file.\nsudo apt-get -y install lib32z1\nsudo apt-get -y install lib32ncurses5\nsudo apt-get -y install lib32bz2-1.0\nsudo apt-get -y install libgcc1:i386\nsudo apt-get -y install libstdc++6:i386\nsudo apt-get -y install libssl-dev:i386\nsudo apt-get -y install libqtwebkit4:i386\nsudo apt-get -y install libqt4-scripttools:i386\n\nOnce the above packages are installed you should be able to run the application.\nNote:\nlib32bz2-1.0 failed to install on Ubuntu 15.04 and the application still seams to run just fine.\n", "Q: How to remove Windows 7 if I have installed with Wubi?

You may have a buggy EFI that's causing problems. Sometimes upgrading will solve the problem; however, upgrading alone may not be sufficient -- you may need to jump through some extra hoops, like re-installing or doing the next two steps.\n\n*Boot an emergency system in EFI mode and run the Boot Repair tool. This can fix many such problems. You may need to use the advanced menu and select the option to back up the Windows boot loader file and copy GRUB in its place. (I realize you don't have Windows, but some EFIs are badly broken and look for its boot loader.)\n\n*Try my rEFInd boot manager. You can try the USB flash drive or CD-R version risk-free. If it works, install the Debian-package version in Ubuntu. If that works, you're done; but if not, boot into Linux using the CD-R or USB flash drive and then try using the alternative naming options.\nYou can try these things in any order that you like.\n\nA: I went back to legacy boot mode, set up the MBR GRUB and Ubuntu is running fine.

It was because my /boot partition was full and therefore apt couldn't unpack and install anything.\nHere it is:\nHow to handle out of space errors\nCheers, \nJustin\n\nA: Fire this at command line:\n $ sudo apt-get install -f \n\nThis checks your lib and if it finds unmet dependency, it'll fetch the needed files and install them.\nMeanwhile - that dependency version of image-generic told me that you are running on 12.04.  Perhaps this case will do the trick:\n    $ sudo apt-get install syslinux-themes-debian-wheezy\n    $ sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n    $ sudo dpkg-reconfigure -a\n\n\nA: I just ran into this unmet dependencies problem while trying to do an \"apt-get upgrade\", but also had the additional issue of /boot having run out of space. \nSome errors which provide clues that your /boot is out of space:\n\ngzip: stdout: No space left on device\nNo apport report written because the error message indicates a disk full error\n\nThis meant that apt-get was helpless, with \"sudo apt-get install -f\" and \"sudo apt-get autoremove\" failing to work.\nIn the end, the link in Justin's answer provided the solution:\n1) Check how many old linux-generic kernels you've got installed:\nfind /boot -type f -regex \"^.*-generic\"\n\n2) If more than 2, manually clean out the old ones\nsudo find /boot -type f -regex \"^.*XX-generic\" -delete\n\nReplacing XX with the number of the old kernel you wish to remove (e.g. find /boot -type f -regex \"^.*24-generic\" -delete) Make sure you leave the latest two kernels (highest two numbers).\n3) Now you've got space to fix the unmet dependencies:\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\n", "Q: How to remove Debian screen at system start?

No matter which device I use, when I start Skype, all messages are there after a minute or so. \n\nA: Google's Chat (previously called Talk, now Hangouts) uses the XMPP protocol to send and receive messages. XMPP does not support cross-device history.\nGoogle thus added a proprietary extension to Hangouts to enable that feature, using GMail as storage backend. Unfortunately, there is (currently) no way for Pidgin to use that extension.\nIf you are really set on having the history synchronized, you could use the Hangouts web client on Google+.\nEDIT: There is at least one XMPP extension for centralized history[0] and client synching, as well as \"Carbon copy\"ing messages sent from one client to other open clients, but Google, Facebook, and others who built chat services on XMPP decided it was more in their interest to silo off than to work together and allow interoperability.  They could have published their extension as a spec.\n[0] Example: http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.html .  There may be others.\n\nA: There is a XMPP standard (XEP-0136) for storing server-side message history. However, it is not clear that this is the mechanism that Google is using for their history function. See eg, this question (from 2012) and this one (from 2011), or at least as of those questions it doesn't appear supported.\nHowever, Pidgin doesn't actually in any case officially support this extension. See this (6-year old, ouch) request that the feature be implemented, and more recently another. There might be unofficial plugins to do this, though.\n\nA: There is a Chrome Extension (by Google) that allows you to manage your hangouts outside of the browser - a bit like the current \"pop-out\" ability but more stable.\nhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hangouts/nckgahadagoaajjgafhacjanaoiihapd\nNot exactly what you were asking for but I just found out about it and it's pretty good. Not as good as seamless Pidgin integration but better than using the \"pop-out\" feature.\n", "Q: \"cannot find operating system\" while preparing a bootable USB stick from ubuntu-12.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso I followed the steps in http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows and know that my USB stick is bootable.\nIt starts booting, but then shows an error message:\n\ncannot find an operating system.\n\nI have used the same setup and installed it by double clicking the wubi.exe from Windows -- it downloaded ubuntu-12.04.3-wubi-amd64.tar.xz and installed.\nSo I know it is the right OS, but I am having trouble installing from my bootable USB stick.

It keeps asking which program to I want to open with. It isnt like windows when it automatically knows.\n\nA: It depends on what you;re trying do launch. If you download *.exe files it won't be executed unless you use particular apps like e.g wine. If it's only a picture or text document, you'd have to know what extension it has e.g. schedule.pdf (pdf is what's called extension). Afte that you can figure out if you're missing an application to execute this file.\n\nA: The .pkg tends to be a package application. It is used by many programs so you need to install the same program on your home computer that you use at school.\nSometimes adding a .zip to the end of the file name will allow you to open the file as some of the .pkg files are actually zip files.\n\nA: In Ubuntu, the equivalent to Window's .exe files are the .deb files. You can just click .deb files in Ubuntu and they'll install just as easily as with Windows (it's actually easier, since you won't have to go through all those annoying \"Next\" buttons). So one thing you could do is check for a Ubuntu or .deb version of the programs you're downloading.\nAlternatively, I recommend you enter the \"Ubuntu Software Center\" (look for a shopping bag icon in your left panel) and search for programs similar to the ones you use in Windows.\n", "Q: Ubuntu GNOME vs Ubuntu \"normal\" with gnome So, I know there is the Ubuntu GNOME distro.\nAnd then there is Ubuntu, where I can add (and hence use) gnome.\nWhat's the difference between those two?\nFor example, we know that Canonical patches certain Gnome packages to \"fit\" Unity. Does the Ubuntu Gnome distribution (without Unity) include the Canonical modifications or is it pure Gnome?\n\nA: Ubuntu GNOME edition will give you an experience which resembles more the vanilla GNOME 3 installation. By installing \"normal\" Ubuntu you'll get Unity, and if you install GNOME on top of that, you'll end up with all traditional GNOME apps as well as \"Unity apps\".

First you install one of the distros, say Fedora. Then you install Ubuntu. Pay attention to the installation instructions, which will ask you if you want to wipe your hard drive or if you want to install the new operating system alongside the other one that's already installed (i.e., if you want to dual-boot).\nIn order to install Linux, make sure you have an installation media (CD, DVD or USB pendrive) and boot you system with this media inserted.

And for that I want CUDA-5.5 on Ubuntu 12.04.\nI went for dual boot with Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04. Installation of Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04 went fine. Then I followed the steps mentioned here to install CUDA-5.5 on Ubuntu 12.04, but could not go beyond the installation of the Nvidia drivers (Step I). \nAfter installing the proprietary Nvidia driver (NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-331.20) suggested by Nvidia for K20 & C2070 and rebooting, the display freezes at the screen with the Ubuntu logo, before the login screen appears.\nI've also tried with removing the proprietary Nvidia drivers and installing ppa based drivers, but that too doesn't work. Also as I would be needing CUDA, so I have to use proprietary Nvidia drivers. \nHow can I fix this issue ?\nI would appreciate any help with fixing this problem.\nEdit: To add, after attaching the GPUs to the mother board, the mother board expects the display to be taken from the discrete GPUs instead of the integrated graphics card on the mother board. So, currently the display is being taken from the C2070 card.\nSolved: My problem is resolved. I just followed the instructions given for installation of CUDA-5.5 on Nvidia's website here. Earlier I had tried to install the .run files for the drivers which didn't work.

I need this for image classification and testing. Picasa allows me to do it perfectly with easy back and forth switching so that I can identify changes in illumination, small movements, and large movements. Making it into a movie using ffmpeg is not an option as I require the individual images.\nFor example, say I observed between images 24 and 25 there is an Illumination change and I want to experiment on those two frames.\nThe problem with the existing image viewers in Ubuntu is that they are very slow compared to Picasa while moving back and forth and hence is inconvenient. Also, I noticed a tendency that after 10.jpeg, the default image viewer in Ubuntu switches to 11000.jpeg. And before 10.jpeg, it passes like 10999 -> 1099 -> 10.\nIs there any such image viewer which works like Picasa? Like really smooth while moving between pictures and also in order.

The other one is a strange DVD from someone else, I do not really know if this DVD is fine...\nBoth of the DVD supposed to have Ubuntu on it. Now, I do not know which DVD is mine... I mean which I burned by myself. I copied this to DVD to my PC and compared the two respective folders using cmp. It showed no difference. Does it mean that I can use any of it for installing Ubuntu? \nThanks\n\nA: Just generate a checksum for both DVD's and if they have the same checksum then they contain the same data. If you only want to compare the two disks, then the md5sum /dev/cdrom command is enough, run it for both disks. If you want to compare them to the genuine iso, then you will have to read the more detailed instructions.\nWhy this method is better than simply cmp-ing the mounted directories:\n\n\n*\n\n*cmp can only tell whether the 2 disks are identical, it won't help in telling whether they are genuine, whereas md5sum helps in the latter case too.\n\n*Comparing the block device files are a much simpler command, than comparing the mounted folders. \n\n*Checksum comparison can be done with only 1 optical drive, whereas comparing by cmp needs 2 optical drives.\n\n\nA: You could just identify when the disk was burned - see here.\nBasically just run this:\ndd if=/dev/sr0 bs=1 skip=33581 count=17 | hexdump -C\n\n(This will only work if /dev/sr0 is where the disk is mounted)\nYou will get something like this:\n[wilf@comp ~]$ dd if=/dev/sr0 bs=1 skip=33581 count=17 | hexdump -C\n17+0 records in\n17+0 records out\n17 bytes (17 B) copied00000000  32 30 31 33 31 30 31 36  31 39 31 36 34 32 30 30  |2013101619164200|\n00000010  00                                                |.|\n, 0.000152142 s, 112 kB/s\n00000011\n[wilf@comp ~]$ \n\nLook for the bit like\n|2013101619164200|\n\nSo this means that this 13.10 disk I burned for another computer was done on:\n2013 November 16th  , at 17:16:42.00\nThen you can find the time difference between the disks.\n\nA: Safe files on the two discs doesn't mean that you can use any of those two install Ubuntu. I mean, the disc you burn yourself may fail to boot successfully. What you need to do is insert those discs one by one and try to boot from those. If they boot safely , they might be the same.\nIn order to solve your problem I recommend to find the date of burn of the 2 discs.   The answer is here.\n\nA: I would try get the information on the DVD-Recorder used for burning the disk.

Let's say my hostname is\n>hostname\nABCabcABC\n\nAnd, if my local people open a browser and open http://ABCabcABC, they can reach my website. \nI want my website to be reached at, let's say, http://aaa\nI tried changing my hostname with hostname command. It didn't work. \nI tried to make a new VirtualHost file and typed a new 'ServerName` value, but it didn't work either. \nHow can I fix this? \nThanks in advance. \n\nA: Basically you need to provide domain name service to your network so the computers now how to turn names into IP addresses.\n1) Setup a DNS server which you can link aaa to the machine, and get every computer on the network to use this DNS server for resolution.  You can also set it up to cache web entries so it gives a slight performance improvement to your network, and it allows you to add other names in the future.\n2) Add to the /etc/hosts file (or hosts on windows) that aaa resolves to a certain IP.  Same immediate effect as above in resolving aaa but no other benefits, if you want to add bbb you'd have to visit each machine again.\nThe hostname setting is only the name the computer things of itself as, it doesn't help any other computer on the network find it by name.\nThere is actually a third option, if you're using a custom DHCP server (ie. not a router, but a *nux based daemon) you can pair your DHCP server with your DNS server so when hosts are assigned IP addresses their name and IP is automatically added to the DNS server... this effectively allows connection by the hostname file.\nThere are some lightweight DNS servers on the market I've not tried, the big two heavyweights are PowerDNS and Bind\nMethods 1 & 2 allow you to point multiple names to the same computer, method 3 allows the first name to automatically get registered, but you'd have to manually edit zones (as in method 1) to have multiple domains point to the same machine.\n\nA: This spells the DNS issue.  Setting up your own DNS servers is quite a complicated and time-consuming process, because you are required to have 2 physical machines with its own IP address and is different from each other's IPs before DNS could work.  \nAs a quick and easy fix - outsource your DNS needs to DNS provider.  I am very happy with https://dnsimple.com/ and this is the best service at very reasonable rate.  And it is one of the best company after trying 5 different companies.\nBesides, check my article regarding virtual hosting on apache2.  I included the formatted working structure of directives.

This is all about my problem.\nConfiguration :\nI'm on an MSI-EX600 laptop with 3GB RAM and nVidia GeForce 8400M G. \nThe display driver currently in use is Nouveau (xserver-xorg-video-nouveau), the OS is Ubuntu 13.10\nSymptoms :\nSometimes I get these graphical glitches/artifacts/corruption that garbles up GUI elements, often to the point that I can't use it and have to log out or restart (it re-initializes the display I guess).\nIt got really annoying so I looked into it and discovered that it happens when opening large images in Firefox or Thunderbird. Image Viewer works well, but open a 4000px wide image in the browser and my screen fries.\nI checked Resource Manager and there's no shortage of CPU or RAM (I don't have swap). Another symptom is playing Flash video consumes too much resources - it spins the fans like crazy. It's not heavy lifting and this PC isn't that old, so I expect it to work. It worked fine when it had Windows. It seems to be be a software issue.\nWhat I tried :\nTrying to fix this I attempted to switch to an nVidia proprietary driver (from Software & Updates > Additional Drivers ). This resulted in blank screen, so I restored Nouveau at boot and gave up. I tried again just now, but the latest nVidia driver doesn't work. I won't pick another one from the list because each time it takes forever to restore Nouveau from Recovery Mode, instead of there being a simple option to scrap last installed video driver.\nI tried configuring a refresh rate of 60Hz at startup - xrandr -r 60 in Startup Applications, still didn't do the trick.\nHow can I resolve this problem ?\n\nA: I've found virtually all errors of this type to be solveable by running MOZ_DISABLE_IMAGE_OPTIMIZE=1 firefox in a terminal, to test if it works.  If it does, I just add  MOZ_DISABLE_IMAGE_OPTIMIZE=1 to /etc/environment (you would then have to log out and log back in for this to take effect from your desktop environment I think, although from a newly opened terminal it'd work.)\nThis pretty much does what the name suggests –  it ONLY sends image data to the video card for actually on-screen images.  This has just the effect you'd expect – it avoids firefox's problems with >4096 and >8192 images with lots of cards, which in some cases is due to firefox ignoring the hardware limit, and in other cases driver bugs on cards that are supposed to support those larger images.  It also avoids firefox running out of video RAM and crashing on lower-video-RAM systems like the Atom with GMA500 I had recently (32MB of video RAM!).\nThe consequence is firefox burns a few % CPU decoding and sending images as you scroll, which otherwise would have been pre-loaded on the card.  This also works on remote X sessions, with the same effect... on a large image page, instead of a big chunk of network traffic on page load as firefox pre-sends all the images, you get traffic as the person scrolls.\n", "Q: Error pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks I have Ubuntu 12.04 LTS installed on my machine, I tried to install a new version of libc6 which I downloaded from here I made that because a new version of libcv depends on it, I thought after installing libcv dependency it will be installed!

An Ubuntu+Windows+Chromium OS is what I want.\nNow, I think my problem is a bit deep and tricky, but I'd really like you guys to help me in anyway you can.  \nSo here it is. I'm having trouble installing Windows to a GPT type partition table, which means I have to stick to the MBR type. Unfortunately, it only allows 4 primary partitions, or 3 primary + 1 extended partition.\nI know I can install Ubuntu, as well as Windows to logical partitions. I'm not sure about whether Chrome OS can be run from logical partitions.  \nMy problem would probably be solved if I'm able to run Chrome OS from logical partitions. I'll have to keep 1 primary partition as System Reserved in order for Windows to boot normally. Out of the 2 primary partitions left if I choose this case, both of them will go for Chrome OS if it's not possible to install it to logical partitions. [Chrome OS needs at least 2 partitions to run, at least that's what I found out of my week long research. ]  \nI read the answer in this post, and I feel it's kinda incomplete. The answerer hasn't addressed the second partition needed by Chromium. Neither has he addressed the swap partition needed by Ubuntu. If this answer is considered, 5 primary partitions would be needed at the least. Which ain't possible with MBR.\nCan anyone here help me with my problem please? I'd really appreciate your help. :)\n\nA: *\n\n*Install Windows, which will occupy the first 2 primary partitions, use its Disk Management tool to reduce Windows partition as desired, and create a \"Recovery Disk\" under Windows.\n\n*Boot your computer from live Ubuntu disk, start GParted, delete the \"System Reserved\" partition and grow the Windows to the right, to take up the empty space left by the \"System Reserved\" partition.\n\n*Restart your computer and if Windows fails to boot, repair using the Windows Recovery Disk. (NB: I tested this successfully with Windows 7 only.)\n\n*Boot your computer from live Ubuntu disk again, start GParted, create 2 primary partitions for Chrome OS, and then create a 4th Extended Partition, which may contain, for example, a partition for Ubuntu /root, a partition for /home and a swap partition.\n\n", "Q: How to get an ubuntu workspace switcher that is always visible? I've probably asked this question before, but is there any way to get an Ubuntu workspace switcher that is always visible?\nObviously, I don't mean the full screen version.  I mean a small \"thumbnail\" version, that shows tiny representations of the existing windows, and gives you the ability to drag those \"mini-windows\" in the workspace switcher.\nThis isn't a new idea.  The old Solaris OpenWindows had this, and there have been a couple of applications on MS Windows that do this, like \"sDesk\" (there were two applications with this name) and \"Dexpot\", which is still actively maintained.\n\nA: There are a few ways I know of to make switching worspaces easier and faster.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can search for \"cairo\" dock in the ubuntu software center. This dock has a workspace switch applet which you can set to always be on top. I don't know if it supports dragging and dropping onto the applet.\n\n*Another way is pressing super+S. On a windows keyboard this is win-logo+S or on a Mac press command+S to show all the virtual desktops. This way you can grab active windows and place them on the desktop of your liking. Double click on the desired workspace to zoom in to it.\n\n*Yet another way of switching between desktops is to hold alt+ctrl followed by a directional key (left, right, up, down). You can drag active windows from one workspace to another by adding shift to that combination: alt+ctrl+shift and a directional button.\n\nA: Ubuntu Unity has not such direct option. I think they consider it archaic. But there are ways how to run xfce, lxde or gnome desktop environments and those have it. Or you can run Xubuntu or Lubuntu.\nFor Ubuntu Unity 13.04, read this guide: http://kurtis319.blogspot.sk/2013/04/workspace-switcher-gone-after-upgrading.html\n\n\n*\n\n*Inistall unity tweak tool: sudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool\n\n*Start it: unity-tweak-tool or via Unity dash\n\n*Choose Workspace Settings\n\n*Switch Workspace switcher to ON\nIn between the icons on the left you will see the Workspace switcher icon.

Here are a few scenarios.\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 105 = Alt_R\" #=> This disables both Control keys and doesn't work like ALT-GR, virtually the key doesn't do anything.\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 105 = ISO_Level3_Shift\" #=> Same as above\nIs there a way to address these problems?\n\nSetup:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 13.10\n\n*External USB keyboard (Kinesis Advantage Pro)\n\n\nA: Switch to a virtual console (CTRL+ALT+F1) and run \nshowkey -s\n\nThis will print out the scancodes of the keys, so just press those left and right CTRL keys and see whether they have the same scancodes. After you verified that, wait 10 seconds and don't press any key, so the showkey program can return. Then switch back to X (ALT+F7).\nIf the scancodes were different, then there is hope that those keys can be remapped differently (because the kernel sees them different), if the scancodes are the same, then there is no way for a different remapping.\n\nA: If you have two keys with the same scancode, remapping those keys to another action will remap both keys with that scancode. There's no way (as far as I know) to differentiate two different keys if they have the same scancode.\nAs @falconer suggests, you can see if your two keys in fact are different or the same by checking with showkey -s in the virtual console. Remember how to switch back to X (ALT+F7) so you don't get stuck in the virtual console.\nIf you press your two keys that you wish to map differently, and those two keys gives you the same output here, then you need to look for another solution.\nThe external keyboard you are talking about does in fact have keys with the scancodes mapping to actions that you suggest are missing (Control_L and Control_R) - I would recommend you to reset the keyboard to it's default settings and check the output of your keys with xev again.\nMake sure that you start with the correct Operative system settings, on your keyboard they are:\n=+ + w for windows.\n=+ + p for PC (non-windows).\n=+ + m for Mac.\nSetting that up before you start remapping will get you off to a good start with all the scancodes that you need.\nAs for the Alt-GR issue, ISO_Level3_Shift should be the correct action for this key (as far as I know). Keys with that action triggers the behavior of Alt-GR correctly.\nAdditionally, when tampering with scancodes and actions it may be nice to have some kind of software like KeyMon which will tell you what key or key combination you are pressing.\n", "Q: Installation completed but not saved to hard disk I am new to ubuntu and am installing ubuntu from a usb stick.I install it and it installs fully and asks me to restart computer and when i do i have to install it again as it doesnt save ubuntu in my hard disk\n\nA: Remove the installation medium(live-usb device or live-disk).After that change the boot-order to hard-disk as the first option in bios.\n\nA: Oh huh - sounds like your Ubuntu was installed ON THE USB.

As soon as I connected it and turned it on it worked, and I printed two Ubuntu test pages. Then it stopped printing anything from Ubuntu although it will print or scan from XP.  what canI do?\n\nA: Try it with \"hplip\". Available on Ubuntu software center. This is support for HP printers.\nIf you know your printers' IP (assuming it's wireless), you can enter this in your browser to see if it is connected and try to adjust preferences.\n\nA: Go to http://localhost:631/.  This is the CUPS 1.7.2 site where you will manually register your printer.  When you get to the site, click on the Printers tab; you may very well see your printer listed here, but it may not have been registered automatically.  Weather you see it listed or not, click on the Administration tab and enter your printer information.  (My printer was listed when I clicked on the Printer tab, and it was also recognized by Ubuntu, but it still would not print because it was not registered automatically.)  After you finish entering your printer information, your printer may very well start working properly.

It is very easy to do, and does not require any configuration files.\nsudo ln -s ~/path/to/yoursite/ /var/www/html/yoursite\n\nThe last portion of the above may be different for you. The above is what I use in Linux Mint 17. The '/var/www/html/' directory is the default apache \"site\" folder.\nSo yeah, for anyone who is looking for a clean, easy method to map a site without actually placing their site's directory in the default apache folder, there ya go.\nNote: I am not sure if the above is appropriate for production environments, but for local development, it seems to be okay. The reason I am unsure is because the symlink carries the permissions of the folder in the home directory, which is (most likely) \"owned\" by the user. If you need to, you can obviously change that to the more secure 'root' like the apache directory, but I leave mine alone as I am just using this in a development environment.\n\nA: I solved this by following this guide.\nA really neat solution which enables you to create a folder in your specified \"Sites\"-folder and then access it without having to add a sites-available for every new site.\nTHE guide ->\nhttp://css.dzone.com/articles/drop-folder-directory-and-have\n", "Q: Why it is important to Securing /dev/shm and /tmp I see a lot of blogs talking about security and specially how to secure /dev/shm and /tmp\nI would like to know why it is important to secure these folders?\n\nA: /tmp and /var/tmp are supposed to be world-writable (and sticky) so that all programs and/or users can create their temporary files there. \nFrom TLDP:\n\nWorld-writable files, particularly system files, can be a security hole if a cracker gains access to your system and modifies them. Additionally, world-writable directories are dangerous, since they allow a cracker to add or delete files as he wishes. To locate all world-writable files on your system, use the following command:\n\nsudo find / -perm -2 ! -type l -ls\n\n\nand be sure you know why those files are writable. In the normal course of operation, several files will be world-writable, including some from /dev, and symbolic links, thus the ! -type l which excludes these from the previous find command.\n\n", "Q: Can't make bootable USB I'm trying to create a bootable USB - I get the error message:\nAn error () occured while executing syslinux.

I suppose I could copy iptables rules from fresh installation, where do I find configs then?\n\nA: I found it.\nApparently, firestarter is installed on Ubuntu 12.04 either by default or as a dependency or recommendation to something I normally install. It was present on two different 12.04 machines but I don't remember installing it. Also never heard about it anywhere.\nFirestarter only considers one of your network connections your internet gateway, and by default that's the wifi. So it sets up your linux firewall to block all incoming connections for wifi, but not ethernet, because it considers ethernet to be your local network.\nThe tricky part is that ufw and gufw, which seem to have replaced firestarter as Ubuntu's recommended firewall, have their own set of iptables rules, so they don't even notice firestarter is there and can't switch it off.\nTo get rid of the firestarter rules temporarily, launch firestarter and click the stop button.\nTo get rid of firestarter and its rules permanently, do:\nsudo apt-get remove firestarter\nYou can now either leave the firewall as it is and possible disable samba when you're on public wifi, or you can set up a couple of rules of your own with ufw or gufw.

It does also say the appropriate gstreamer plug-ins need to be installed.  Does anyone know what these are?  \nI used this test site and the YouTube HTML5 page to verify that h.264 support works in Google Chrome on my Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit, but does not work on Firefox 26.\n\nA: Firefox 33 and beyond\nMozilla added support for OpenH264 as a plugin in Firefox 33. To enable this plugin Firefox will now automatically download a binary from the OpenH264 website the first time you start the program.\nThat sounds great, doesn't it? Wait… that was a pun.\nWhile this is indeed a very convenient solution it should also raise privacy and security concerns when software automatically downloads binaries from sites affiliated with Cisco Systems or other companies, no matter how transparent the process and license agreement is.\nNot directly related but if you prefer to automatically delete cookies when Firefox gets closed and can't find the right cookie to keep for persistent HTML5 playback then I suggest to install YouTube ALL HTML5.\nTests with 14.04.2 and 15.04 VMs\nMy guess was that only installing an H.264 decoder binary wouldn't be enough, so I set up 2 new virtual machines: \n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04.2 with restricted addons installed during installation\n\n*Ubuntu 15.04 without restricted addons installed during installation\n\n\nAfter the installation of both VMs was completed I booted the systems, updated them again, installed VM guest additions, started Firefox for the first time and rebooted for the actual testing.\nSince YouTube also offers their open sourced WebM formats and I wanted to avoid going into to much detail about test methods I needed to use another HTML5 capable site to test proprietary H.264 playback support. I chose Vimeo, because they say they default to HTML5 and they don't seem to support WebM, which I consider not to be a good thing.\nWhenever I made some changes in the test, like installing a package or enabling/disabling something in Firefox I closed and launched Firefox again.\n14.04.2 with restricted addons\n\nAs you can see in this screenshot only the OpenH264 plugin is enabled in Firefox, all the necessary GStreamer packages in different versions are preinstalled and the video plays as expected.\n15.04 without restricted addons\n\nAs you can see in this screenshot the OpenH264 plugin is enabled, there is no Flash plugin, a few GStreamer packages in different versions are preinstalled but the video does not play! Instead the site immediately tells us that the video can't be played. Why is that?\n\n\n\n*\n\n*AAC is missing! – To put an explanation simple, there is a file on the server that is fed into our browser. If you look for it using the inspector from the context menu in Firefox, you will find an MP4 with AAC-encoded audio. The error message could be more clear but it makes sense since we don't have a decoder for AAC currently installed.\n\n*Update: Looking again into this issue with Firefox 41, I found that OpenH264 seems to be disabled in about:config through:\nmedia.fragmented-mp4.exposed;false\nmedia.fragmented-mp4.gmp.enabled;false\n\nSetting these to true had no effect. Further settings I tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*media.audio_data.enabled;true no effect.\n\n*media.mediasource.enabled;true Vimeo didn't use MSE before, enabling these and related settings had no effect.\n\n*media.fragmented-mp4.use-blank-decoder;true result: a solid green canvas and a constant sine wave audio signal.\n\n\n\n15.04 with restricted addons\nA smart approach would have been to install gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad-faad, but this doesn't make the particular error message on Vimeo go way, so let's install all the restricted addons.\n\nAs expected, everything works if you install the restricted addons package afterwards, but you may want to set the Flash plugin to something else than enabled in Firefox to be sure to use HTML5 video.\nAnalysis or just make it break\n\nApparently gstreamer1.0-libav is the only package you need to remove to get the error message back. So it was using libav's AAC decoder? I didn't dig deeper to find proof for that nor did I look for which decoder will be preferred (e.g. if OpenH264 is of any use currently on Linux) or if Vimeo throws this error message due to some other dependency not being met despite H.264 and AAC decoders being installed.\nSummary and outlook\nTo sum it up, playback of current mainstream content does not only require an H.264 decoder but also an AAC decoder and H.265 is already preparing to replace the older one. Also I don't see the corresponding specification for MP4s with H.264 to be changed towards recommending a more open source friendly audio codec in the foreseeable future.\nSeriously, push for WebM! You get VP8 + Vorbis as the H.264/AVC contender and VP9 + Opus as the H.265/HEVC contender.\n\nA: For 12.04 / 14.04 / 18.10\nJust visited the HTML5 Youtube test and I have H.264 checked; you probably will need to install Ubuntu restricted extras to get the gstreamer codecs.\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\nYou may need to restart.\n\n\nA: \nFirefox currently uses OpenH264 only for WebRTC and not for the video tag, because OpenH264 does not yet support the high profile format frequently used for streaming video.\n\nSource: http://andreasgal.com/2014/10/14/openh264-now-in-firefox/\ngstreamer1.0-libav is probably the only option to add support for the H264 HTML5 video tag in Firefox for Linux.\n\nA: For 14.04\nThe solutions above are not working anymore with Trusty Tahr 14.04.\nThe reason for this is the package gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg has been replaced by gstreamer1.0-libav but Firefox is planning to support gstreamer 1.0 only with version 30.\nSo in the meantime you can install the gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg from saucy for your appropriate architecture here : \n\n\n*\n\n*https://launchpad.net/~mc3man/+archive/trusty-media\n\nA: With Firefox30 you have to install  gstreamer 1.0. You should also install most of the plugins : bad,ugly,...\nDon't get confuse by the package name, you should install :  gstreamer1, not gstreamer (the one/1 number is as part of the package and not a \"version\"). The same rules apply for all plugins : \"gstreamer1-plugins-...\" \nHere's a more complete url to test your browser html5 capabilities and codec support  :\nhttp://html5test.com/\n\nA: I would suggest installing\nsudo apt install ffmpeg\n\nand then restarting firefox.\n", "Q: Trigger play/pause event One can configure the play/pause key on his/her keyboard to start/pause music of any music player that supports this function.\nI'm writing a program that should trigger these events.

I went to a keyboard testing site on a laptop that I just installed yesterday.

Like check for input? Secondly, how do I re-bind it to do what it is supposed to?\n\nA: The ultimate low-level test for keyboard keys is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Ctrl+Alt+F1 to switch to a text mode console.\n\n*Type your username and password at the login prompt (press Enter after each).\n\n*Run the command showkey and press keys. The command prints a scan code when you press a key and another code when you release the key.\n\n*Wait 10 seconds without using the keyboard and the showkey program will exit.\n\n*Log out of the text console by running the command exit, and switch back to the graphical interface with Ctrl+Alt+F7.\n\n\nIf pressing the Left key does nothing then you have a hardware problem, otherwise you have a software problem.\nIf you have a software problem, check if you've inadvertently set up the Left key as a shortcut key. (You can check this first if you prefer.) You can list all the keys that have been grabbed as shortcut keys by an application. Install the xdotool  package. Open a terminal window and run the command\nxdotool key XF86LogGrabInfo\nless /var/log/Xorg.0.log\n\nThen look at the file /var/log/Xorg.0.log in a text editor. Scroll to the end and look for a line that says “Printing all currently active device grabs”. If there's anything below that line about the keyboard, some application wants a key for its own use.\nThis command doesn't list keys that are used as shortcut keys in the desktop environment.

The other options are for making different partitions for different directories. A common one is to have \"home\" in a separate partition. This is not necessary, but can be useful if the operating system gets junked; your personal files will be safe.\nMake sure the boot is set to the correct drive.

Is \"trying out\" Ubuntu 13.10 on a USB drive through EFI as safe and secure as Ubuntu 12.04? Will it save my files/data at all? cause that's exactly what I wouldn't want.  My MacBook pro will only boot Ubuntu through \"EFI\" mode while holding ALT when starting up the laptop, There is 2 options, Windows, and EFI. When I click the Windows boot option it won't detect that there is Ubuntu on that USB so  Ubuntu  will only start up and work while booting through EFI. What's the difference with EFI btw? And when it loads up the screen, its so small that you can barely see your cursor. How do I fix the size of the screen layout as well?? \nThanks,\n Sky\n\nA: EFI is a way of booting operating systems, like BIOS. Generally speaking, Windows will boot using BIOS, while Mac and Linux will boot using EFI (or UEFI). I believe that you can now get Windows to boot using EFI as well though (and you can also boot Linux using BIOS), so it's not quite as simplistic as I'm suggesting.\nIf you can boot it with the \"EFI\" option but not the \"Windows\" option, just use the \"EFI\" option.\nRegarding saving files, this will depend on what files you create and how. If you are using ubuntu's \"Try it\" option, then as long as you aren't saving the files to the physical drive, then you will be fine. As soon as you reboot the computer (or turn it off), those files will be gone.\n", "Q: Help finding/installing kernel headers-3.11.0-14-generic I just switched to Ubuntu 13.10 and I'm trying to install VMplayer in order to run windows based applications.

Then edit fstab and remove the ,usrjquota=quota.user,grpjquota=quota.group,jqfmt=vfsv portion.\nsudo mount -a\n\nto reload the fstab entries.\nSadly there is no explanation in the HowTo you used describing the intent or application of enabling quotas.

If your services are running normally, there's usually little need to enable them except in scenarios where storage capacity is limited based on the number of users utilizing those assets.\n", "Q: sending email if disk space exceeds I have a script to calculate available disk space and alert by email if the limit exceeds a given value defined by me. Here is the script:\ndf -H | grep -vE '^Filesystem|tmpfs|cdrom' | awk '{ print $5 \" \" $1 }' | while read output;\ndo\n    usep=$(echo $output | awk '{ print $1}' | cut -d'%' -f1  )\n    partition=$(echo $output | awk '{ print $2 }' )\n    if [ $usep -ge $Alert ]; then\n    MessageSpace=\"Running out of space \\\"$partition ($usep%)\\\" on $(hostname) as on $(date)\"\n    spacealert\n    fi\ndone\n\nNow, the problem is if I have two disks whose limit has exceeded the given limit then it will generate two seperate mails. Can I make it to send just a single email to me. Thanks. \n\nA: One approach is to create a temporary file and write any over-usage alerts to that file.  If, after we go through all the partitions, the file is not empty, an email message is sent:\ntmpfile=\"$HOME/.fs_usage_check.tmp\"\necho -n \"\" >\"$tmpfile\"\ndf -H | grep -vE '^Filesystem|tmpfs|cdrom' | awk '{ print $5 \" \" $1 }' | while read output;\ndo\n    usep=$(echo $output | awk '{ print $1}' | cut -d'%' -f1  )\n    partition=$(echo $output | awk '{ print $2 }' )\n    if [ $usep -ge $Alert ]; then\n        echo \"Running out of space \\\"$partition  ($usep%)\\\" on $(hostname) as on $(date)\" >>\"$tmpfile\"\n    fi\ndone\nif [ -s \"$tmpfile\" ] ; then\n    mail  -s \"Disk Space Warning\" someone@host <\"$tmpfile\"\nfi\nrm -f \"$tmpfile\"\n\nI am not familiar with the spacealert utility that you were using so I substituted mail for sending the email.\nBy the way, I think the awk/while/read statements can be simplified a bit:\ntmpfile=\"$HOME/fs_usage_check.tmp\"\necho -n \"\" >\"$tmpfile\"\ndf -H | grep -vE '^Filesystem|tmpfs|cdrom' | awk '{ print $1,$5 }' | while read partition usep ; do\n    if [ ${usep%%%} -ge $Alert ]; then\n        echo \"Running out of space \\\"$partition  ($usep)\\\" on $(hostname) as on $(date)\" >>\"$tmpfile\"\n    fi\ndone\nif [ -s \"$tmpfile\" ] ; then\n    mail  -s \"Disk Space Warning\" someone@host <\"$tmpfile\"\nfi\nrm -f \"$tmpfile\"\n\nIn this simplified form, the usep variable changes slightly: it still has the '%' sign attached.  We need the percent sign removed in order to do numeric comparison. Bash has a special parameter expansion for removing such suffixes which looks like ${var%pattern} or, to remove the longest pattern matching suffix, ${var%%pattern}.  In our case, because the pattern itself is a percent sign, the same as bash's magic character, we need either to escape it (as in ${usep%\\%}) or to use the longest match command (as in ${usep%%%}).\nNote that the do while loop is in a pipeline and therefore in a subshell (I am assuming you are using bash or dash or similar shell).  Thus, none of its environment variables survive out of the loop.  The temporary file, of course, survives and that makes it good for signaling whether a message should be sent.\n", "Q: Asus laptop power management I have a couple of symptoms that make me think Ubuntu has some problems identifying all the components of my laptop (Asus N56VJ-S4051H).\n\n\n*\n\n*When starting the computer from the OFF status, the fan goes to full speed just after the boot manager (EFI) chose the OS.

I have nearly 20 years linux experience and this reminded me of the bad old days. do not attempt this if you are newbie.\ni don't think thats particularly HP's fault but ubuntu seriously need to release an installer that includes bumblebee because most new laptops now have this setup.\n", "Q: where to add code for disabling OPTIONS method in apache a web application security assessment recommends me to disable OPTIONS method on the webserver\nim running Apache/2.2.22(ubuntu)\nThe solution i found so far was to add this certain code. \nRewriteEngine on\nRewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} !^(POST|GET)\\ /.*\\ HTTP/1\\.1$\nRewriteRule .* - [F]\n\nim quite confused where to add this specific code, i have 3 .conf on my /etc/apache2\n\n\n*\n\n*apache2.conf\n\n*httpd.conf \n\n*ports.conf \n\n\ndo i just add the snippet anywhere inside the .conf file?\n\n[edit]\nafter adding the config on my apache2.conf OR httpd.conf im getting this error when i try to restart\nInvalid command 'RewriteCond', perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration\nAction 'configtest' failed.\n\nThe Apache error log may have more information.\n   ...fail!\n\n\n[edit2]\n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN\">\n<html><head>\n<title>301 Moved Permanently</title>\n</head><body>\n<h1>Moved Permanently</h1>\n<p>The document has moved <a href=\"http://192.168.5.1/web/\">here</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<address>Apache/2.2.22 (Ubuntu) Server at 192.168.5.1 Port 80</address>\n</body></html>\n\n\nA: If you have configured vhosts for your site you can add inside your required vhosts.

It must be partitioned in order to use it at all. Depending on the options selected when you installed Ubuntu, you may actually have more than one partition on the drive.To create another partition, you will first need to shrink another partition in order to make room for the new one. You can use gparted (gparted.sourceforge.net) to do this. Download and burn the ISO image and restart your computer with it. Most operations are quite evident in how to accomplish them. After you shrink the first partition, you will be able to create another.As with any major disk operations, make sure you back up your data first. Also, it is possible to run GParted from Ubuntu, but you run a greater risk of losing data by doing so.\n\nA: Try to use Gparted,if it impossible to do it from Ubuntu try use Live Gparted,you can boot Gparted from USB drive or CD and then re-partition your drive\nbut beware if there's only 1 partition,there's high possibility that the whole Ubuntu including it's bootloader,etc. (Boot stuff) is on that partition and there is also high possibilty to not able boot your Ubuntu due the MBR re-write.Make sure you not also have free space boot also partition that not have any connection with boot stuff.\nSo for safe i suggest you to re-partitioning your drive from your Ubuntu.\nP.S.:If you install Windows after Ubuntu,you will lost your Ubuntu Bootloader (Not the Ubuntu) because Windows re-write the whole bootloader on the disk.But you can always fix your bootloader\n", "Q: installation problem in VLC Media player How to run media player in Ubuntu?\nIs it require any plug-in or any installer package?\nNeed step by step help , please help me.\n\nA: just type the following in terminal:\nTo open terminal press the keys Ctrl +Alt+T\nsudo apt-get install vlc\n\nand you are done.\n\nA: Use the existing media player available in UBUNTU. Else, if you have preference for VLC, open the UBUNTU software center and search for VLC. Once located, press install. You may have to keyin your administrative password for installation to be successful. Once VLC is installed, an icon will be available in the launcher bar on the left side also. Click it, select the media you want to play and that's it.\n", "Q: How can I fully integrate my Windows files with Ubuntu using dual boot setup? I am totally new to Linux/Ubuntu. I installed Ubuntu 12.04 alongside Win7 from a USB stick. I was under the impression that doing this would allow me to access my files from within Ubuntu just as I've always done using Windows. \nHowever, although I can still access the files easily from the Windows partition in the file manager, the files are not fully integrated into my Ubuntu environment. I.e. whenever I want to use them, I have to navigate to the Windows partition. E.g. I would like to 'import' my existing music files - which right now are in my Music folder in Windows - into Rhythmbox, to make playlists, etc. But I cannot! The best I can do is navigate to the Win partition and open the files individually from there.\nWhat I want is for all my files to 'just be there' for me in Ubuntu as they are in Windows, without having to always navigate to my Windows partition. Is there a way to do this? \nThanks for any guidance you can give.\n\nA: You can make your Windows partition automatically mounted to Ubuntu by editing the /etc/fstab if i'm correct.but it won't mount untill you logged in\nso here are the steps\n1-Open terminal and run blkid as super user\n2-you will see several line of partition UUID.keep it open and open new terminal\n3-now run gedit /etc/fstab also as super user\n4-now on the bottomest line or make new line if there isn't any and type \nUUID=(your windows partition UUID)\n5.followed by space (partition mount point) space (filesystem type,so i assume you also want to write to Windows partiition so you can use ntfs-3g for the filesystem type) space  defaults  space 0 space 0\nwell that i usually do\nAnd with this you not only can read from windows partition but also wrtite to it,but Windows partition will not mounted if it isn't clean yet or you're not logged in yet\n\nA: The only way is to create a symbolic link for the folder( which contains music files in ntfs partition) in the default Ubuntu Music folder.To do this run the below command in terminal,\nln -s /path/to/the/folder/which/contains/music/files/present/in/the/ntfs/partition ~/Music\n\nNow you can access the ntfs music folder inside the default Ubuntu Music folder.\n\nA: While this probably isn’t best solution, copy-pasting from Windows partition to home folder in Ubuntu may solve your issue. \nAlthough is unclear from your question if you wanna keep the files in Windows partition or  not. I assume that you're using partition map without specific \"data\" partition in Windows, it means physically your files are  burned in Windows installation on Windows partition. \nNote that some programs may help you in this for example Shotwell can be pointed to specific folder to read your photo information but it can also read photo information and copy photos on Ubuntu partition whenever you point it (by default photos will be imported to pictures folder). \nWhen dual booting I usually have a third data partition for files I wanna use on both OS installations. I point nautilus to the files (same as Windows). In nautilus you can achieve that by installing gconf-editor using\nsudo apt-get install gconf-editor \nrun it and choose apps, nautilus preferences. When location of files adjusted as per your  needs tick always use location entry to make it permanent.\n", "Q: Invalid argument - Brother scanner not working after upgrade (brscan2 driver) I recently upgraded Ubuntu 13.10 (Saucy). \nScanning via my MFC-420CN had been working in Ubuntu and Linux Mint installs up though Olivia and Oneric.  However once I upgraded from these, scanning broke.  I installed a fresh copy of saucy to verify that it wasn't just something to do with the upgrade.\nBrother's website has a notice that all brscan1 models no longer support usb scanning as of Ubuntu 11.10, but it doesn't seem to apply for brscan2 and brscan3 models.  Moreover I found several other posts that seem to indicate at least brscan4 models are currently working. However I have been unable to verify scanners using brscan2 (or other divers other than brscan4) and ubuntu 13.10 (actually 12.10 and greater) are currently functioning.\nFor cross-referencing / to help others with the problem the complete list of brscan2 scanners is as follows:\n DCP-110C  DCP-115C    DCP-117C    DCP-120C    DCP-130C    DCP-135C    DCP-150C\nDCP-153C    DCP-155C    DCP-310CN   DCP-315CN   DCP-330C    DCP-340CW   DCP-350C\nDCP-353C    DCP-357C    DCP-540CN   DCP-560CN   DCP-7010    DCP-7020    DCP-7025\nDCP-750CW   DCP-770CW   DCP-8060    DCP-8065DN  MFC-210C    MFC-215C    MFC-230C\nMFC-235C    MFC-240C    MFC-260C    MFC-3240C   MFC-3340CN  MFC-3360C   MFC-410CN\nMFC-420CN   MFC-425CN   MFC-440CN   MFC-465CN   MFC-5440CN  MFC-5460CN  MFC-5840CN\nMFC-5860CN  MFC-620CN   MFC-640CW   MFC-660CN   MFC-665CW   MFC-680CN   MFC-685CW\nMFC-7220    MFC-7225N   MFC-7420    MFC-7820N   MFC-820CW   MFC-845CW   MFC-8460N\nMFC-8660DN  MFC-8670DN  MFC-885CW   MFC-8860DN  MFC-8870DW  MFC-9420CN\nSimilar previously asked questions / problems (but for brscan3 driver hardware):\n\n\n*\n\n*After upgrading to 12.04 the scanner from Brother Printer MFC-290C does not work\n\n*xsane exits with \"Invalid argument\" while scanning with Brother DCP-J725DW, what does it mean?\n\nSo far I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing sane-utils\n\n*irections at brother's website regarding the brscan2 install, including using the dpkg -f flag\n\n*editing /lib/udev/rules.d/40-libsane.rules to include\ncode:\n# Brother scanners\n\nATTRS{idVendor}==\"04f9\", ENV{libsane_matched}=\"yes\"\n\n\n\n*\n\n*copying files form lib to lib64:\n\n\ncode:\ncd /usr/lib\nln -s ../lib64/libbrscandec2.so.1.0.0 .\nln -s ../lib64/libbrcolm2.so.1.0.1 .\nln -s ../lib64/libbrcolm2.so .\nln -s ../lib64/libbrscandec2.so.1 .\nln -s ../lib64/libbrscandec2.so .\nln -s ../lib64/libbrcolm2.so.1\ncd sane\nln -s ../../lib64/sane/libsane-brother2.so.1.0.7 .\nln -s ../../lib64/sane/libsane-brother2.so.1 .\nln -s ../../lib64/sane/libsane-brother2.so .\n\n\n\n*\n\n*installing ia32-libs and repeating the sane-utils install\n\n*removing the 64 bit brscan2 driver and replacing it with the 32 bit one, but results of scanimage with the 32 bit driver set-up for usb or network mode were less than promising:\n\n\ncode:\n# scanimage -L\n\nNo scanners were identified.

There are two problems here.\n\n\n*\n\n*The error Invalid argument is not a argument problem, but is a write access problem.\n\n*The other problem is that the bus and dev number are wrong from the scanimage error.\n\n\nHow to find and fix the problem?\nInstall the brscan4 drivers from the brother website\nsudo dpkg -i brscan4-0.4.2-1.amd64.deb\n\nCheck to see if it works\nsudo brsaneconfig4 -d\n\nTest to see if the scanner is installed (scanner need to be powered on).

This is one of the problems in the scanimage. The bus is 003 and the device is 002 and not bus 5, dev 1 as per scanimage\n$ lsusb\nBus 003 Device 002: ID 04f9:60a0 Brother Industries, Ltd**  \nBus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\n...\n\nTo fix the problem, you will need to use the path based on the location of the brother scanner in the lsusb command. In my case it was bus 003 and device 002. Note that if you unplug the USB cable to the scanner and plug it back in the device, you will get a new number and/or bus. (The number return back to 2 when you reboot the PC)\nExamples:\nsudo cd /dev/bus/usb/003\nsudo chmod 666 002\n\nor just:\nsudo chmod 666 /dev/bus/usb/003/002\n\nScanimage need to fix the message when it can not access the scanner to have the right bus and dev number and also tell the user that the problem is a write access problem.\nBrother needs to update the driver code so that global user can write to the scanner i.e. chmod 666 to the scanner driver location  \n\nA: Try this program called VueScan, I was searching for mfc-420cn driver and i ran into this website: \"http://www.hamrick.com/\" I haven't been able to test this though (because I still have yet to find the power cable to my old printer that's been collecting dust.), but it did say it would support a vast variety of printers, so I thought I should post it. Anyways, hope this helps.\n\nA: I ran into the same issue, and according to https://wiki.debianforum.de/Brother_Scanner the \"Invalid Argument\" error can be caused if the printer is connected to an USB 3 port (controlled by xhci_hcd). It started working for me as soon as I switched to an USB 2 port (controlled by ehci_hcd).\n\nA: I'm using Ubuntu 13.10 32bit\nI use MFC-7820N and everytime I upgrade the kernel I have to reinstall all the brother drivers.  The ones I have are: brmfc7840nlpr-2.0.2-1.i386, brscan2-0.2.5-1.i386, cupswrapperMFC7840N-2.0.2-1.i386\nI then double check that the rule \"ATTRS{idVendor}==\"04f9\", ENV{libsane_matched}=\"yes\"\" has not been modified or deleted in /lib/udev/rules.d/40-libsane.rules\nAfter all that I reboot.\nLastly, I will give the brother printer it's own USB host controller, just as a extra measure for testing.\n", "Q: Is there any command line interactive tool like meld?

I've been progressively turning more and more things off and it still won't boot the LiveCD.\nI've tried the following scenarios, booting into the Ubuntu 13.10 64-bit LiveCD and the LiveUSB with the following options turned off in this order:\nFAIL == Black screen after moving past the bootloader screen, with ANY Linux\nTurning off Secure Boot - FAIL\nTurning off Secure Boot and Intel Rapid Start Technology - FAIL\nTurning off Secure Boot, Intel Rapid Start and Win 8 Fast Startup - FAIL\nSwitching from UEFI to UEFI with CSM, with all the other previous stuff still off - FAIL\nTurning off UEFI and Switching into Legacy Mode - It will boot gParted and Fedora, but still won't boot Ubuntu or Lubuntu. Both *buntus get to the loading screen that says *buntu and has the progress bar made of dots below it and then they just sit there. This is not a tenable option either from what I've read because Windows 8 won't boot in Legacy Mode anyways.\nI should say, I installed the Windows 8.1 upgrade prior to attempting any of this.\nSo it sounds like there are two problems here. The UEFI issue and something else preventing it from loading properly even in Legacy Mode.\nFor the UEFI issue, I am trying to get a BIOS update for this laptop, but MSI's website is poor.\nI have also heard of a boot manager called reFind. Will this assist me?\nAnd I don't know what the problem is with the Legacy Mode? Perhaps an nVidia issue? Is there a set of boot parameters I can use?

You must use the legacy bios option.\nYou can download the net boot install here: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/netboot/13.10/\nI have an MSI GE40 too and Ubuntu runs on my machine.\n\nA: Boot into Windows, open the pendrive you have with the Ubuntu installation, execute Wubi.exe and follow the installation, hope this works.\nPS: if this doesn´t work http://sourceforge.net/p/linux-secure/wiki/Home/\n", "Q: Converting an ARF file using nbr2mp4 with Kubuntu 13.10 I followed the NBR2MP4 converter procedure on the WebEx site and also reviewed the step-by step instructions at https://askubuntu.com/a/362719/219130 but no matter what I do, it just doesn't work (i.e. doesn't output any MP4 file).\nFrom within the nbr2_mp4 directory:\n$ ./nbr2mp4 my_file.arf /tmp/ 5\nConverting /home/username/nbr2_mp4/my_file.arf to /tmp/my_file.mp4\nRetrieving video data, fps=5...\n\nI tried many different options with or without DEST and FPS, with and without sudo, and whatever I do, it just doesn't output any file, ever.\nOn the WebEx site it says Linux OS: 32-bit Ubuntu 8.10/9.04 so it might simply be that the scripts are incompatible with 13.10, but I'd rather know if others have the same issue too?\n\nA: nbr2mp4 converter comes with the libraries it requires but doesn't read them from the directory.\nJust run\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH='./'\n\nto let nbr2mp4 'see' it's own libraries.\nThen the converter can be run as\nnbr2mp4 XXX.arf\n\nTo make sure that the conversion is in progress check if one of /tmp/wbx_nbr*.h264 files size is increasing.\nTested on Ubuntu 16.04 64bit\n\nA: In my case, in Ubuntu 16.04 AMD64 I still needed these 32-bit libraries:\nsudo apt-get install libpangox-1.0-0:i386 libpangoxft-1.0-0:i386 libgtk2.0-0:i386 libasound2-plugins:i386\nI found out which libraries I needed by\n\n\n*\n\n*trying to run ./nbr_play\n\n*looking for the missing library with dpkg -S (e.g. dpkg -S\nlibpangoxft-1.0.so.0)\n\n*installing the library in its :i386 version.\nBut that was much more difficult than just downloading the windows player msi from https://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html and running it inside wine (and I still receive an mmap allocation error): \nwine msiexec /i path/to/nbr2player.msi\nThe program is called Network Recording Player and should end up in your application menu.\n\nA: I had the same problem. In my case, some libraries required by nbr_play (the actual binary executed by nbr2mp4->nbrplay->nbr_play; nbr2mp4 and nbrplay are shell scripts). Just installing the missing libraries solved the problem.\nYou can check for missing libraries with 'ldd nbr_play'.\nAlso be aware that nbr_play is a 32-bit program. If you are using a 64-bit system, there is a chance that you already have installed the 64-bit versions of the libraries but not the 32-bit versions. In such a case you must install the 32-bit version of the libraries too.\nThe reason why the linker errors (unresolved libraries) are not shown when you execute the command is because the errors are redirected to /dev/null in the shell scripts mentioned above.\n\nA: There is no need to install nbr2mp4 , which anyways didnt work on my Ubuntu 18.04 bionic. To Play .arf file , do following\n1> Download nbr2player.msi (yes, windows installer) from webex link above or google it.\n2> Right click and choose Open with option and then choose , \"Find New Applcaition\"\n3> Ubuntu will suggest Q4Wine for the application, install it.\n4> Now have your, Q4Wine know the path of downloaded msi file and install the nbr player.\n5> Open nbr player using super key and browse to arf file and viola, play it.\nAdditional optional step :\nAbove steps works, but in case dependencies were still missing for Q4wine , install winetricks\nsudo apt-get install winetricks\nRetry 5 steps.\n", "Q: What is the difference between a desktop environment and a shell? I may be asking a basic question for many of you.\nWhat is exactly linux environment ? and what the relation between linux environment and shell? and what the relation between linux environment and running processes?\nSorry if my question makes no sense !\n\nA: I assume by \"Linux environment\" you mean environment variables?\nEnv vars are local to every shell - so if you set one in one terminal window it will not show up in another. Child processes will inherit a copy of their parent's environment, so if you set particular variables and then start a program, that program will see those variables, too - but neither parent nor child can change the other's variables.\nDoes that answer your question?\n", "Q: unable to install vlc noob question kubuntu Whenever i type sudo apt-get install vlc.\nit comes with an error saying that unable to locate the package\nthis is happening with all other installs too, am i making any mistake,\nit is my first hour with kubuntu.\n\nA: Have you tried:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nthen retry (Also I assume you mean apt-get install not app-get install?)\n", "Q: Django Model to manipulate LDAP Entry I am currently working on a project involving Django framework and OpenLDAP.

(and so on, about 10 test users)\n\nIn order to manipulate my LDAP entries from Django Models, I use django_ldapdb python package. In models.py file in django I defined the following things:\nclass LDAPEntry():\n    base_dn = \"ou=Accounts,dc=example,dc=ro\"\n    object_classes = [\"groupOfNames\"]\n\n    group_name = CharField(db_column=\"cn\", primary_key=True)\n    member_attribute = CharField(db_column=\"member\")\n\n    # methods for displaying the group name(__str__ & __unicode__)\n\nAfter that, I open up a Django Shell, and start playing around with some queries:\n#this returns a instance for the Accounts group\ngroup = LDAPEntry.objects.get(group_name = \"Accounts\")\n\n#then i try to see the members that are part of this group\ngroup.member\n\n# and this returns the following thing:\nu'cn=test1,ou=Accounts,dc=example,dc=ro'\n\nAfter noticing this, I realize that the member field, in my Django Model, has information about only the first member attribute in my LDAP Accounts entry, in LDAP database.\nWhat I want to ask is: is there a possible way in which I can tell a Django Model Field to hold multiple values? ( i want my \"member\" field to hold information about all the member in Account Group, basically holding all the Distingueshed Names of the users).\nThank you very much.\n\nA: It turns out that the situation can be resolved by changing:\nmember_attribute = CharField(db_column=\"member\")\n\nto:\nmember_attribute = ListField(db_column=\"member\")\n\nAnd by this all the member values in Accounts entry are fetched.\n", "Q: CPU stuck on minimum frequency after resume from suspend and unplugged (Dell Latitude E6540) I have a Dell Latitude E6540 (4th gen. core i7 processor).

Is there any way to change this variable in python ?\n\nA: There is no way to change the environment variables from a child process. And there is an exactly same question on SO.\n\nA: There is a workaround to what you want to achieve. Assuming you use bash as your shell, you can write the changes to bash initialization files(I chose ~/.bashrc):\n#!/usr/bin/python\nimport os\nos.system('bash -c \\'echo \"export a=100000\" >> ~/.bashrc\\'')\nos.system('bash -c \\'source ~/.bashrc\\'')\n\nYou need to prepend bash -c, since python uses sh as the default shell.\n\nIdea derived from a similar question on SO(different from the one falconer posted).\n", "Q: Problem Installing Ubuntu on Lenovo Ideapad U330p I cannot get Ubuntu 13.10 64-bit ISO installed on a Lenovo Ideapad U330p (i5 core, SSD) preinstalled with Windows 8, by using a Ubuntu USB live stick.\n\n\n*\n\n*I tried various live usb creators (the build-in one crashes, but the\nrest Live USB Creator, mkusb script, etc work ok). \n\n*I tried also with various UEFI / Secure boot options in bios (no secure boot, no uefi = legacy), with no luck.\n\n*I tried also with EFI, and without the EFI folder on the USB and legacy bios install, no luck.\n\n\nThe most I can achieve is to get the Ubuntu live usb first screen with the Ubuntu options shown, but then with any option I choose (Try, or Install) after a few seconds I am left with a black screen, and nothing happens, no matter how much I wait. I have then to power off the machine.\nI am not sure this is related to UEFI, but it does not seem like.\nDoes anyone has any experience with this type of machine - Lenovo Ideapad U330p?\nPreferably, I would like to get rid of the preinstalled copy of Windows 8 completely and install only Ubuntu there (I do not want a dual-boot system, but I can live with dual-boot system if than is the only way). Any install mode (legacy or UEFI, MBR / GDI) will do.\nUpdate: Some details (I have read all relevant ubuntu/uefi related links here, and in ubuntu wiki):\n\n\n*\n\n*I disabled win8 fast boot and hibernate\n\n*I have disabled secure boot\n\n*I tested with uefi and also with disabled uefi (legacy)\n\n*I tried with Ubuntu usb with EFI folder, and renamed EFI folder\n\n*I tried with various programs to create the Ubuntu USB\n\n\nWith some of these combinations it does not work, but with UEFI and secure boot disabled - I see the grub-like menu, and without UEFI at all I see the boot screen with options. However, no matter what option I choose, it freezes (screen becomes black after one second or so after that), and only the power off button works.

After selecting the Try or Install, the screen brightness was set to 0. So I could see only pure black. Using the laptop brightness keys worked and the live Ubuntu is working fully ok. A bit stupid, but the screen was so black, I did not to came to the idea of using the brightness buttons (one has to press it two-three times before one can see the light on the screen).\nTo answer some of the questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*For the usb, I tried Unetbootin, usb-creator-gtk (crashed), Live USB Creator, and mkusb script from http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2172971 on Ubuntu. The current usb I used for the last test is the one created with mkusb script. May be the others have worked too, but I could not tell.\n\n*I disabled secure boot in bios, and I changed the boot menu order in bios. In U330p bios can be reached via the small nova button - I am using a small screwdriver to press it.\n\n*After Try Ubuntu without installing from the grub, one has to use laptop brightness key to see the screen.\nSo I will install Ubuntu next :), thanks for all the help.\n\nA: I can't comment, so sorry if this isn't a perfect answer:\nI believe the problem is that Secure-boot is enabled in your BIOS settings.

Then by setting the 'keep-downloaded-packages' option BOOL value to false, apt-get will automatically delete a packages .deb file from the /var/cache/apt/archives/ directory, immediately after installation (just like 'apt clean').\nNote that apt itself uses a separate binary directive for the same option, and per this apt NEWS entry, since Nov 2016 (so at least Debian 9 (Stretch)) this has been set to \"false\" by default. If (for whatever reason) this is not the case for your system, you can append the below to your config file.\n# Remove downloaded .deb files after installation by apt\nBinary::apt::APT::keep-downloaded-packages \"false\";\n\nNOTE: I cannot speak to other desktop environments, but KDE Plasma's Discover software center is not affected by either of these options, and so any package installations or upgrades conducted through Discover will keep the cached .deb files, and you will need to run apt clean to remove these.\nFor a convenient index of all apt configuration directives/options, open \"/usr/share/doc/apt/examples/configure-index.gz OR JUST configure-index (in later versions)\".\n\nA: You just need to add it at the apt configurations files. Just run:\nsudo sh -c \"echo 'DSELECT::Clean \"always\";' >> /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99AutomaticClean\"\n\nThis will trigger automatic clean each time you do upgrade.\nLets explain this entry, from the man page:\n\nClean\nCache Clean mode; this value may be one of always, prompt, auto,\n             pre-auto and never.  always and prompt will remove all packages\n             from the cache after upgrading, prompt (the default) does so\n             conditionally.  auto removes only those packages which are no\n             longer downloadable (replaced with a new version for instance).\n             pre-auto performs this action before downloading new packages.\n\nMore info:\nhttps://groups.google.com/d/msg/linux.debian.user/aK2jvfL_tuw/rUd6i6bd4YQJ\n\nA: Write a shell script! \nsudo nano /usr/bin/aptinstaller \n\nInside this file type: \n#!/bin/bash\nsudo apt-get install $1\nsudo apt-get -y autoclean\nsudo apt-get -y autoremove  \n\nSave and exit from nano and type:\nsudo chmod +x /usr/bin/aptinstaller \n\nNow everytime you would type \nsudo aptinstaller <package-name> \n\nIt would install and then clean. \n\nA: My workaround, though not a real solution, is to set the archives directory to /tmp. It won't be cleaned automatically after an install but it will be cleaned on reboot.\nI created /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99clean and added:\nDir::Cache::archives /tmp;\n\nAlternatively you could mount /var/cache/apt/archives using tmpfs, though that will obviously use up RAM and I wouldn't recommend that option.\nIn /etc/fstab, for example:\ntmpfs /var/cache/apt/archives tmpfs size=128m,mode=755 0 0\n\n\nA: A hack appears to be adding the following to e.g. /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/clean (via):\nDPkg::Post-Invoke {\"/bin/rm -f /var/cache/apt/archives/*.deb || true\";};\n\nThis will clear the cache automatically after dpkg has been invoked by apt.\nThis does not clean the cache after apt-get update though, the hook APT::Update::Post-Invoke might be used for this.\nThe best method still appears to be calling apt-get clean / aptitude clean manually.\n", "Q: Disabling discrete NVIDIA card on ASUS r501vb on 13.10 Saucy, vgaswitharoo or bumblebee?

It's not Ubuntu-specific, but it should help you understand the principles involved and steer you around some of the common pitfalls.\nThe Ubuntu wiki's page on EFI may also be helpful. It's more Ubuntu-specific than my page.\nIf you're not able to boot a medium in EFI mode, then it's possible it's not been properly prepared. Some \"generic\" tools to create a bootable USB flash drive from a CD/DVD image file don't properly set up the EFI boot loader, so you may want to try another tool. If you've got a working Linux system, use dd, as in dd if=imagefile.iso of=/dev/sdc (to create a USB flash drive at /dev/sdc from imagefile.iso).

It describes how to burn a generic image onto a CD/DVD on a mac, but to be used with an intel PC - not a mac.\nA mac has a different boot mechanism, called (U)EFI.

So it must have been disconnecting the computer to switch the jumper and next I tried switching off at the power supply for enough time to clear the MB and then tried boot and was successful and the DVD's are functional again.  Go figure.\nSo to boot Umbutu, I will need to either switch off or disconnect power supply or figure out what is happening.  For now, it switching off power supply, good that I have long arms.\nNeed to look and see if Light Scribe has Linux version\n", "Q: dpkg returned an error code(2) #computer@computer-Satellite-L755:~$ sudo apt-get install \nReading package lists...

I like how the different keyboard layouts are handled in Ubuntu - I can customize the switching keyboard shortcut to Shift+Caps Lock, I can rig the Caps Lock keyboard LED to show the alternate keyboard layout...\nBut I find it much more convenient to use the ibus transliteration stuff instead of switching the keyboard layouts. I understand, that keyboard layouts are a completely different thing and entirely unrelated to the ibus stuff.\nI'd like to mimic the keyboard layout handling behavior with ibus - specifically switching the input methods with Shift+Caps Lock (and as a bonus - rigging the LED to show if the alternate input method is active)\nOn ibus-setup I see no way to set the next input method as Shift+Caps Lock.\nI tried the following values: \n\n\n*\n\n*<Shift>+caps-lock\n\n*<Shift>+CapsLock\n\n*<Shift>+Caps\n\n*<Shift>+Caps Lock\nThe problem might be that I don't know how to spell the \"Caps lock\" properly for ibus...\n\nA: I guess the problem can be solved from the point of Linux Mint, where the ibus-setup application's capturing pressed key window is not broken. \nThe correct spelling is Caps_Lock...\n\n", "Q: Temporarily Use a Different Version of a Package to Resolve Unmet Dependency How can I temporarily use a different version of a package so that I can install another package that depends on it?

Assume I can run any script with root privileges in tty which I've prepared beforehand, and after 5 or 10 seconds the power will go out. What's the best way to minimize the damage (like maybe unmounting all devices, or closing all open files)?\n\nA: Anyway you can shutdown from terminal using the command,\nsudo shutdown -h now\n\nor,\nsudo poweroff\n\nAfterwards you need to put your sudo password. Here is an answer describes how you can shutdown from terminal without entering password. To do so,\nJust run sudo visudo from terminal and add the following line:\n%user_name ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /sbin/poweroff, /sbin/shutdown\n\nThis allows you to run the above commands, using sudo, however with no password.\nSo, sudo poweroff or sudo shutdown -h now will now result in a password less shutdown.\nIf you want a step further ahead you can make a alias named stopnow or whatever, \nalias stopnow='sudo poweroff'\n\nThat would enable you to shutdown the system by only running stopnow in terminal.\n\nA: Alt+Print Screen+R,E,I,S,U.

Ubuntu: 13.04 - raring\nExchange: MS 2007\nThunderbird: 1:24.1.1+build1-0ubuntu0.13.04.1\nEvolution: 3.6.4-0ubuntu1\nEvolution-mapi: 3.6.2-0ubuntu1\nEvolution-ews: 3.6.1-0ubuntu1\n\nMy company uses exchange for Mail and also has a 'brand style' email template and signature. I can't seem to find a good Linux solution that allows both to work to company standards.\nThe Company's Brand formatting\nIt is essentially a Calibri font/sans-serif; font size:11.0pt; colour#1F497D. Any Linux mail I use must be able to default to that when I write a new message, forward or reply.\nThis has been set up because the rest of the company uses outlook.\nInitially I had hoped to use Thunderbird, and bought an ExQuilla licence which sync's perfectly (though slower than outlook). However the colour #1F497D isn't one of the default swabs for colour choices avaible under Preferences>Composition>General>HTML>Text Colour. I could get the right colour by manually copy pasting the Hex code into the colour selection tool in the write window... but this was fiddly and requires me to keep the hex code constantly on hand... Instead I installed last colour picker, which jumps to the last swab I used. More useful... but still not ideal.\nEvolution offers a one up in this respect, I think I can here customise the composition look of my email as per company standards... so I looked to move...\nExchange Server 2007 settings\nThis guide initially looked very good. So i aimed to install evolution and MAPI.\nsudo apt-get install evolution\nsudo apt-get install evolution-mapi\n\nAnd so I installed Evolution and Evolution support for the groupware suite. I quickly found I couldn't select the correct protocol, however this was resolved by installing the missing dependency, as per this solution via:\nsudo apt-get install python-samba\nThis seemed to be working better. I made an account as follows using the evolution account assistant, I've included dummy names.\nFull name: Joe Blogs\nEmail Address: Joeb@mycompany.co.uk\n\nThe MAPI attempt\nSo first I tried setting Server Type under 'Recieving Email' to Exchange MAPI.\nFor configuration my server settings were initially:\nserver: exchange.mycompany.co.uk\nusername: joeb\ndomain name: [empty]\n\nSo i entered domain name in as \"mycompany.co.uk\"... Authenticate... entered by (definitely correct) password. However in the Mail authentication request box it rejects the password and says Password is incorrect.\nI've juggled with these heavily trying my owa address which is along the lines of mail.extention.ourcompanymailserver.net/owa... no joy.\nSo I went back over to thunderbird and the working server address I had tied into thunderbird: https://mail.extention.ourcompanymailserver.net/EWS/Exchange.asmx\nFollowing the thread here I tried by exchange address, still no joy. This site again suggested I used my server IP address... however I don't know that and there's no sysadmin to help us here!\nI figured I could just ping the server\nping https://mail.extention.ourcompanymailserver.net/\nwhich came back with an IP that I then stuff into evolution.. no joy.\nI then noticed there was an evolution EWS module. which I installed\nsudo apt-get install evolution-ews\nWhich seemed to get me further, now I could get through the initial install and appeared to get a working setup, but a sync from my server wasn't forthcoming \nan EWS_DEBUG=2 evolution gives me lots of\n\"(evolution:16603): Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_entry_set_text: assertion `text != NULL' failed\"\n\nSadly turned up nothing on Google... \nAnd so I'm stumped. I can't seem to move to Thunderbird because it won't customise my email in a way that suits my company... and I can't use evolution because of exchange issues... \nIt be great to get this setup as my entire home setup is Linux... and I have quiet designs to get more of my colleagues to shift given their windows 8 frustrations!\nAny advice on resolving this... or a smarter point of intervention (Thunderbird?) would be much appreciated!\n\nA: I have finally found a solution. To be clear this does not solve my problems with Exchange and Evolution but is a workaround that allows me to use Ubuntu Linux with my business email!\nRequirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*Thunderbird\n\n*ExQuilla plugin (please not this is now paid for on Thunderbird v24+ since November 1, 2013, at time of licence purchase in 2013, this was US$10)\n\n\nYou then need to edit the msgcompose.text_color in the about:config section.\nMany thanks to Sanil Kumar for his solution found here:\n\nIn Mozilla Thunderbird, normally we can change write(compose) window\n  Text color by picking color from Text Color window or we can give any\n  costume color by putting HTML color code or String name. \nBut this color will only effect the current Write window. Next time\n  Text color will be the default color. we can set permanent Text Color\n  through the Menu Tools->Options. \nSelect composition tab from Options Window. Select Text Color in HTML\n  option of General Tab. Color which you selected from this option is\n  permanently set for all Write window. But unfortunately we can't\n  provide custom Color on this option.If you still need to provide a\n  Custom Text Color for all Write window then you have to follow these\n  steps on your risk.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Select Options from Tools Menu\n  \n*Select General Tab under Advanced Tab of Option Window\n  \n*Click Config Editor button\n  \n*Click on \"I'll be careful, I promise!\" in about:config windows warring message to continue\n  \n*Type Text and Hit Enter in about:config window Search box \n  \n*Double Click on \"msgcompose.text_color\"\n  \n*Enter you Custom Text Color HTML Code in msgcompose.text_color box and Click OK Button\n  \n*Close the about:config and Pick a new Write window and Type some text and check your Text Color\n  \n  \n  This will set your custom Color as Default Text Color for Write Window\n\nThis allows me to receive exchange emails to Ubuntu and customise the email style to fit with my Companies in-house standards.

I start jenkins web server using command java -jar jenkins.war. It works great.

Look at the scripts in /etc/init.d/ for examples. These are short shell scripts that allow you to do things like service httpd start and service httpd stop and even service httpd status to find out if httpd is running, or if it's supposed to be running but isn't.\nThere is a great example script for the Hudson service, which functions very similarly to Jenkins (they are sibling forks of the same codebase) here: https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/HudsonUbuntuLinuxStartupScript\n\nA: append & after your command , I mean \njava -jar jenkins.war &\n\n", "Q: How to upload or save on FTP to /www folder on Ubuntu 12.04 localhost?

What is the simplest way to accomplish that?\nTo explain in more detail: There are two machines on the same WAN, but one of them can access the Internet and another one can't. It's possible to talk from one machine to another, though. So the point is to set up the proxy server on the Internet-able machine (having Ubuntu installed).\nNote: This is not about using one machine as the bridge on the same LAN, that can be done easily, this is a different approach (as i understand it).\n\nA: My scenario involved the same thing with the only exception that the other machine (needing internet) was an Android tablet in my case. I used iptables for routing. It is an easy and out-of-the-box solution on Ubuntu/Debian platforms. Here is a sample routing script that you can run on the internet-enabled machine:\n#Instead of ppp0, use the interface you use to access the internet\n#Instead of wlan0, use the interface connected to your \"internet-needy\" machine\n#####Enable Forwarding:\nsysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1\niptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT\n\n###########Create NAT rules using IPTables\niptables --table nat --delete-chain\niptables --table nat -F\niptables --table nat -X\niptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ppp0 -j MASQUERADE\niptables -A FORWARD -i ppp0 -o wlan0 -j ACCEPT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED\niptables -A FORWARD -i wlan0 -o ppp0 -j ACCEPT\n###########\n\n#Allow through firewall\niptables -A OUTPUT --out-interface wlan0 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT --in-interface wlan0 -j ACCEPT\n\nOnce you run this script, your ubuntu machine acts as a router between the internet-needy machine and the internet, forwarding the internet packets to and fro between them.\nJust keep in mind that routing happens at a much lower level than proxying and thus is better in performance. The only disadvantage is that you can't do such things as filter out content or user-authentication based on the proxy client. However, if you just want internet-sharing with good performance, I recommend this method.\n\nA: The very easy solution is to install a Proxy server package, such as polipo.  For a single machine serving internet to one other device that is probably all you need to do.\nsudo apt-get install polipo\nThen just configure the polipo service to allow connections from the other device, for example un-comment and change the following lines in the /etc/polipo/config file:\nproxyAddress = \"0.0.0.0\"\nallowedClients = 192.168.56.0/24\nThen restart the polipo server to update its configuration:\nsudo /etc/init.d/polipo restart\nThe more complicated part is to convince your other device(s) to use the polipo proxy server.  Setting a proxy depends entirely on the software on the non-directly connected machine.\n", "Q: how to create recovery DVD? I have brought Dell vostro 2520. It has preinstalled ubuntu.\nCan you please tell to how to create recovery disk?\nSo that after format, I can reinstall ubuntu.\n\nA: You can create a Live DVD or USB, which you can use to reinstall Ubuntu. It also comes with a full desktop you can run right from the boot media and install tools to recover your system with.

How can I type \"ñ\" with a UK layout using Alt Gr?\nI'd like to be able to just press Alt Gr+ and get \"ñ\".\n\nA: Ctrl+Shift+U and then write the unicode codepoint of the letter, for Ñ it is 00D1 and press Space. This works for any unicode character in most of the X applications.\nOkay so it looks like I only read the title. If you want to use Alt Gr+N:\nxkbcomp $DISPLAY keylayout.xkb\n\nOpen the keylayout.xkb with your favourite editor end search for the symbol which has the mapping for N, something like:\n    key <AB06> {\n    type= \"FOUR_LEVEL_SEMIALPHABETIC\",\n    symbols[Group1]= [               n,               N,      braceright,               N ]\n};\n\nAnd change the third value (e.g. braceright) to ntilde and the fourt value (e.g. N) to Ntilde . Save and\nxkbcomp keylayout.xkb $DISPLAY\n\nAfter this it should work. (For me it does.) But it is only for this session, to make it permanent make a script named /etc/keylayout.sh like\n#!/bin/bash\nxkbcomp /etc/keylayout.xkb $DISPLAY\n\nMake the script executable sudo chmod a+x /etc/keylayout.sh and add the next line to /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf:\nsession-setup-script=/etc/keylayout.sh\n\nSource for the Alt Gr method: link\n\nA: The layout \"English (International with AltGr keys)\" has the ñ/Ñ using AltGr + n and AltGr + Shift + n. Others AltGr/with dead keys layouts has the key somewhere, but if you want a surekill you should use Unicode.\n\n\nA: Check out the Compose Key, configurable in many systems. The default key combination is Compose~n\n", "Q: No option to install Ubuntu alongside Windows 8 While trying to install Ubuntu, the installer does not give me the option of installing alongside Windows 8.  It instead gives me the option to install inside Windows 8.  What should I do?\n\nA: When you see a prompt to install inside Windows 8, that suggests that you opened the installer from within Windows while it was booted.\nYou cannot install Ubuntu alongside Windows when you are booted into the Windows system.  You need to write the installation ISO to a USB or a DVD, and then boot to the USB or DVD.\nPlease also refer to this question and its answers if you run into problems, as Windows 8 systems that use UEFI won't work with Ubuntu side-by-side and you may have to make changes to make it work and behave.\n\nA: \nThis is a bug. I'm not sure if it's a known bug, but I can confirm its existence. Unlike you, I'm running Windows 7. After booting an Ubuntu 14.04 - Desktop X86-32 Disc I was not greeted with the expected \"install alongside Windows\" option, but instead \"install inside Windows\" if you click \"install inside Windows\" it reboots your computer. I would like to emphasize this is not a Wubi installation attempt. The disc was booted. I am an experienced user who has installed Ubuntu and Windows many times, so I know how to boot an Ubuntu dvd/usb.\nSince the installer did recognize the Windows installation I just needed to manually put the installation settings in using \"something else\", and was able to successfully triple boot Ubuntu, Windows 7, and Windows XP. In your case keep in mind that Ubuntu doesn't play nice with Windows 8 so you will likely need to run boot-repair after installing Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Installation of epson scanner on ubuntu how do I install an epson scanner sx200 on ubuntu 12.04 32 bit? I have tried the simple scanner and it does not work\n\nA: Try this.  Download the right drive for your architecture for the printer and the scanner here.  Once downloaded navigate to the folder where the file(s) were downloaded, and just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo dpkg -i <file_name>.deb\n\nFor both the printer, and scanner files.\n\nA: Just had a similar problem with an amd64 machine running Ubuntu Raring (Uberstudent actually). There are two files to be installed for your i386 machine (i.e. 32 bit) and one for printing.\nsudo dpkg -i iscan-data_1.22.0-1_all.deb iscan_2.29.2-1~usb0.1.ltdl7_i386.deb epson-inkjet-printer-escpr_1.3.0-1lsb3.2_i386.deb\n\nAccording to epson's own faq  you should be sure to install the ltdl7 version and not the ltdl3 for the scanner. You will also likely need to be connected to the internet when you install as the printer deb file unpacks then runs apt-get to install alien and other files to convert the contained rpm file to deb. \n", "Q: No multi boot after installing Ubuntu 12 with WinXP I managed to install Ubuntu 12 alongside with my previously installed WinXP on my Toshiba Satellite C655.

It will (re)install Grub and hopefully get it to recognize your Ubuntu installation.\n\nA: I had all kinds of problems with a 12.04 install alongside XP, in logical or primary partitions, either automatically or manually created - it didn't matter. Couldn't get grub multi-boot to come up and the computer would go directly into Windows no matter what I did. Boot-repair asked me to cut and paste 3 command lines that couldn't be executed because there was nothing to be found in the target location (that is to say that grub wasn't \"there\" to be uninstalled). I did everything from a FIXMBR prior to reinstalling 12.04, to a complete reformat and reinstall of XP, to a complete reformat of the entire disk and just a lone install of 12.04 to simply eliminate the possibility that I had a bad install disk (test which showed everything was fine . . . other than the fact that the install changed my BIOS boot settings to \"Ubuntu\", but I suppose that is normal . . .).\nOn the other hand, testing showed that Ubuntu 10.10 correctly installed grub without issue after previously installing XP and manually configuring primary partitions, in contrast to the 12.04 failure to get the job done, and boot-repair's incapability of fixing the glitch. \nAs a windoz user accustomed to workarounds and not heavy on programming, and just about out of options, I decided to do a clean install of XP again, (formatting the entire disk and starting from scratch), and THEN to install Ubuntu 10.10, and THEN to upgrade to 12.04 using the 12.04 install program, and everything went off without a hitch.\n", "Q: \"Ubuntu\" and \"Ubuntu 13.10\" in my Grub boot list I have got \"Ubuntu\" as well as \"Ubuntu 13.10\" in the list of boot-able partitions when Grub appears.

It sends an error report on internal exceptions, but since the app isn't written in C, it cannot catch a SIGSEGV and send an error report on that.   (Not that that would be a good practice in C either).\nI would think that it should be possible to have upstart kick off a script to send the error report, but I can't figure out how to do this.   There seem to be three possible approaches:\n1) a post-stop script.   However, EXIT_SIGNAL is not available in a post-stop script\n2) start on stopped.  Create a separate upstart config with a start on stopped script.  This works great, but only if I remove respawn from the original config.   That's not acceptable.\n3) Use scripting techniques:\nscript\n  cmd &\n  PID=$!\n  wait $PID\n  if [ $? = 139 ] ; then cleanup ; fi\nend script\n\nHowever, the upstart script block appears to work like set -e in a shell, so the script exits when cmd fails, and we never get to the if block.\n\nA: Got it to work.   The trick is similar to #3, but use a shell script in a file rather than inline in the upstart.conf.  That way you can skip the -e and you can use bash rather than dash.\nIf you really want to avoid a separate script, you can bypass the -e behaviour by using ||:\nscript\n  cmd &\n  PID=$!\n  wait $PID || export EXIT_CODE=$?\n  if [ $EXIT_CODE -eq 139 ] ; then cleanup ; fi\nend script\n\n", "Q: I can't get the Nvidia driver to work, anyone any ideas?

Rather it looks like what it really does is have a running daemon re-read the configuration files.\nTo start an ibus-daemon, and especially to keep it running even when you close the Gnome Terminal where you started it from, use the -d or --daemonize option like this:\n$ ibus-daemon -d\n\nNow you can close the terminal window and the ibus-daemon will continue to run.\n\nI was having trouble with the cinnamon desktop crashing, and going into fallback mode, and then asking if I want to restart cinnamon.

It uses what they call an 'input method', which is a way to use a keyboard of one sort or another to select from a much larger set of characters or symbols.  There are 'input methods' for many different human languages.  You can also easily have multiple languages and multiple keyboards that you use (or so it seems).\n\nA: ibus restart will only reset the internal state of ibus, so it doesn't work if ibus daemon is not running.\nIf you want to start ibus again from the command line or in a shell script,\nibus-daemon &\n\nseems do the trick.\nNote that if ibus is already running, this command will automatically terminate the older instance (similar to ibus exit) and the new process will take place, so you probably do not need ibus exit and ibus restart.\n\nA: *\n\n*First solution:\n\nYou can add these lines to file /home/$USER/.bashrc.\nFirst, you open file /home/$USER/.bashrc with this command:\nsudo gedit ~/.bashrc\n\nand then you add these lines to the .bashrc file:\nexport GTK_IM_MODULE=ibus\nexport XMODIFIERS=@im=ibus\nexport QT_IM_MODULE=ibus\n\nThen, you logout and login again.\nThis is my solution.\n\n\n*Second solution: you can download the ibus engine that you want to use, example ibus-bamboo\n\nDownload ibus-bamboo:\ncd Desktop\nwget https://github.com/BambooEngine/ibus-bamboo/archive/master.zip -O ibus-bamboo.zip\n\nor clone from github:\ngit clone https://github.com/BambooEngine/ibus-bamboo.git\n\nBuild & install\ncd ibus-bamboo\nsudo make install\nsudo apt install ibus\nsudo apt-get install ibus-gtk3\n\nThen you restart ibus (After LOG OUT)\nibus restart\nibus-setup\n\n", "Q: Screen doesn't reactivate on acer aspire v5-123 I recently installed ubuntu on my new Acer Aspire v5-123 laptop, after using it with great satisfaction for years on two other laptops.\nFirst I got the more common problem of the display manager not starting, but I solved that by installing the proprietary driver.\nBut now I have the problem that every time I close my laptop screen or plug in the HDMI cable or do something else that make the screen goes black, it won't turn on anymore.

A more secure option is to use public key authentication with a passphrase while turning off password authentication on the ssh server, but this isn't what you asked for.  See the link at the bottom of this answer for instructions if you decide to do this instead.\nTo use ssh without being asked for any passphrase, you need to generate your keypair while leaving the passphrase field blank.  \nTo check if you have already generated a keypair, check for the files id_rsa and id_rsa.pub in your ~/.ssh directory.  If they are already there, you can delete them or move them to create a new keypair.  \nNote, if you delete them you will lose access to any ssh servers you are using then old keys to authenticate to if password authentication is turned off on the server.\nTo create a new keypair, run the following command:\nssh-keygen -t rsa\n\nAccept the default location for the keys and leave the passphrase blank.\nTo give your public key to the ssh server you want to connect to, use the following command:\nssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub username@remotehost\n\nAfter completing these steps, you will be able to log in to the remote server without a password from the computer you are using.\nReference: http://tombuntu.com/index.php/2008/02/20/public-key-authentication-for-ssh-made-easy/\n\nA: Some time ago, i suddenly started being asked for a passphrase to unlock my ssh key when doing git push.  It turned out that to stop being asked for a passphrase it was enough to add SSH Key Agent (GNOME Keyring: SSH Agent) to Startup Applications (in my case -- just to check the checkbox):\n\n", "Q: No login possible after reboot possible hang up I just assembled a small box containing of a sata ssd, 4 GB ram and an Atom board (NM10 D2700 Cedarview on a Motherborad D270S from Foxconn).

THIS POST IS NOT A DUPLICATE ALTHOUGH IT HAS BEEN MARKED AS SUCH.

It is a duplicate of\nis it possible to make ubuntu ask for my password before mounting usb-drives?\nthe problem is, they did not answer that persons question, at all. He did not ask about encrypting a drive. His issue, as is mine, is not protecting a single flash/usb drive, it is protecting his Ubuntu system from someone inserting a usb/flash drive\nHe, as well as I, want Ubuntu to prompt for our password before mounting any USB drive that gets inserted. How can I do this? \nI found this topic\nHow to make Ubuntu ask for password when mounting partitions?\nbut that is for either all drives, or for specific ones. All drives will not work for my setup, as I do not require it to mount internal drives. The individual drives setup will not work either, because in this case the UUID is unknown, so setting it up ahead of time is not possible.\nI thought the original poster stated the problem well, and it was not a case of misunderstood question, the person answering just did not answer the question asked.\nI went to add to that already started topic, but the guide that popped up suggested I not ask further questions if the topic is not answered. I hope I did the right thing by creating a new topic.\nEDIT: More explanation was asked for. I have internal drives, that do not get mounted when the machine boots. They are dm-crypt encrypted drives that get mounted when I enter my key at the cryptsetup prompt, after the machine is booted and logged in. So requiring the password for ALL drives will not work.\nAs I mentioned the UUID of an unknown usb/flash drive is well, unknown, so the specific drive setup in fstab will not work either.\nIs there a way to require it for all External drives, but not the Internal ones?\nI appreciate all the suggestions, even the off-topic ones that do not answer the question I asked\nEDIT again: Thinking about it, could udev be used to write some rule for this?

For that to know you should look into the source code of udisks, device.c, on line 6674 starts an if branch, which is:\nif (is_device_in_fstab (device, NULL))\n{\n  action_id = NULL;\n}\nelse\n{\n  if (device->priv->device_is_system_internal)\n    action_id = \"org.freedesktop.udisks.filesystem-mount-system-internal\";\n  else\n    action_id = \"org.freedesktop.udisks.filesystem-mount\";\n}\n\nSo you can see that org.freedesktop.udisks.filesystem-mount is only for mounts which are not considered internal.

After installing ubuntu \"D:\" partition is gone but totally gone -.- there was 500gb before installing ubuntu but i have just 298 gb hdd space so what can I do guys:\n\n\nA: Having a separate C: and D: suggests there might be two physical drives. \nFrom what I see above, you have a Root partition of 243MB in /dev/sda1, and then an ubuntu-vg LVM partition of 298GB, /dev/sda5, within the extended partition /dev/sda2. I would, very carefully, examine what's in /dev/sda5 and copy anything you want to save to an external drive, then delete (in this order) /dev/sda5, /dev/sda2, save the change, then expand /dev/sda1 to fill almost the entire drive, leaving room (2GB? 4GB? However much your RAM size is) for the swap partition. \nAfter you have set /dev/sda1 to roughly 294-296 GB and created the /dev/sda5 swap (inside an extended partition /dev/sda2), save again. \nThen, check what's in /dev/sdb by clicking on the spin box at upper left which now says /dev/sda 298.09GB for I suspect the 500GB drive is really /dev/sdb and /dev/sda is a 300GB drive.\n", "Q: My touchpad stops working when my computer's memory is full Sometimes my computer runs out of memory (or overwise bugs somehow for a few seconds), and after that touchpad stops reacting to anything.

with my Ubuntu 12.04 OS.\nFirst I thought I could do it trying to connect it via usb, but it didn't get recognized. Epson doesn't provide any software packages for Linux to configure the printer on the local network, not automatically nor manually.\nSolution:\nSo the only solution I found was using the only Windohws pc I had. I installed the software that came along with the printer onto that pc and ran through the wizard until the printer was automatically configured into the wireless network. Once that was succeeded, install the appropriate deb package from the Epson website (Epson does provide the drivers for Linux!). You will need to download them from the Epson website, because they don't come standard in Ubuntu 12.04. In my case I took the 64-bit version.\nOnce you installed the appropriate deb package for your Ubuntu 12.04, when you go to your dash and type in printing and open the program. You click on Add and click on network printer. Make sure your printer is powered on! And wait for about 30 seconds. It should get listed automatically. Select your printer and then click forward, it should automatically start searching for the appropriate driver from your newly added drivers. In the next screen you can modify the printer name if you like or keep it like it is and click on apply.\nYour printer should now be fully functional. Try to print a test page to see if it works.\nWhen you open dash again, type scan and open the program \"simple scan\". Place your printed test page on the scanner and click scan. It should start scanning your test page and voilà!\n\nA: Downloaded driver from website may not compatible with 12.04. Try with the Epson Inkjet ESC driver which is in Main Ubuntu Repository :\nsudo apt-get intall printer-driver-escpr\n\nYou can use Mtink for printer maintenance:\nsudo apt-get install mtink mtink-doc\n\n", "Q: if i manually compile php, should i uninstall it in dpkg first? Around 2 years ago I attempted my first PHP compile and succedded.  I occasionaly upgrade my compile script as I add modules and new versions come out.\nHowever, I'm finding that apt-get unattended upgrades keep overwriting my PHP installation periodically.  The last happened last night and downgraded my installation from 5.5.1 to 5.3.10\nIt happens very infrequently, but still brings the server down before I realise what has happened.\nI ran dpkg -l and can see even when I have my 5.5.1 setup, the dpkg version still reads 5.3.10.  I presume this is because I have done my own compile of php5.  Should I:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall PHP from apt-get and block it's install in future\n\n*Install my custom compiled version differently so dpkg recognises it?\n\n*Just go ahead and block dpkg from allowing php updates.\n\n*As yet undetermined 4th options?\n\n\nYour help is appreciated.\n\nA: \nInstall my custom compiled version differently so dpkg recognises it?\n\nThe most sane solution is that you build your own deb packages and install it using apt/dpkg. This is easy since you only have to take the Ubuntu sources, replace the orig.tar.gz file with your own, check the patches that Ubuntu apply and presto. The only downside is that you can uninstall it later at will (?) and some quirks that you may find while you figure out how to do stuff. IMO, this is the most recommended.\n(You can also set up a build server to build PHP each time you update it)\n\nUninstall PHP from apt-get and block it's install in future\n\nIf you use this, apt doesn't know that you have php installed and whenever you try to install stuff that depends on PHP... well...\n\nJust go ahead and block dpkg from allowing php updates.\n\nThis is not sane. You have two php's installed and God knows what bugs or security holes could be open. The best is that your production environment is stable with all it's patches and stuff.\n", "Q: How do I download a file using SVN+ssh link?

I'm exploring compiling/running simple C++ programs from the bash shell (in Ubuntu 12.04). Being new to Linux in general, I actually have a couple questions.\nFirst, it seems that Ubuntu/Linux does not display file types in the .abc format, as Windows does. I get that the OS doesn't need that extension to know the file's type, but isn't it more convenient for the human user to be able to read off that information at a glance? How am I supposed to know what type a given file is?\nSecond (and relatedly), if Linux seems not to care about extending a file name with the type information, why is that when I create a simple C++ program in gedit and just call it 'test', the compilation doesn't work (using the g++ compiler btw), but when I name the file 'test.cpp', it does work? \nDoes Linux need/care about the extension, or not? I feel like I'm getting mixed messages here, and I would really like to understand. \n\nA: You don't have to name your file with a particular suffix, however the gcc/g++ compilers use the suffix as a shortcut to decide how to process the files. If you want to use a different suffix (or no suffix) you can tell the compiler what kind of file it is explicitly using the -x command line option - see the answer to this similar previous question Compiling C source file without .c suffic\n\nA: In any operating system, what you said is correct: a file's extension does not determine the type of file. Extensions are used to tell programs (and humans) what to expect the file's type to be. Generally, files with no extension are binaries, however, that is not a strict rule.\nDoes it matter if a file has an extension? It depends on the program. Some, like OpenOffice or Gedit, will not ask any questions about the file name extension, but will open the file anyway regardless of what error may occur. Smarter programs like g++ will examine the file name extension before parsing to prevent human error. And then there are programs like media players that trust you to use the correct extension for a file and use the extension to determine how to run.\nIn conclusion you could say that Linux doesn't care very much about file name extensions. This leaves it up to humans and programs to make educated decisions about naming their files. Extensions have their place, but they are not the determinant on what a file is.\n\nA: \nhuman user to be able to read off that information at a glance?\n\nRemember that Linux is an Unix-like operative system. Since ancient times *nix used different methods to identify what a file is about, like file, the shebang, the magic bit, etc. UNIX/Linux development as DOS, CP/M that Windows heritage does. So extensions are generally less significant to most Linux utilities and tools.\n\nHow am I supposed to know what type a given file is?\n\nYou ask the system to tell you. For that it's file and most (if not all) File Managers use the magic bit to identify what a file is about.\n\nif Linux seems not to care about extending a file name with the type information, why is that when I create a simple C++ program in gedit and just call it 'test', the compilation doesn't work (using the g++ compiler btw), but when I name the file 'test.cpp', it does work? \n\nThis is for portability and since they were like that from the beggining. Since Linux doesn't care about the extension, but Windows does, then they make that both OS recognize what the file is about.\n\nA: Unix was created with the idea of files, descriptors, permissions, pipes, links and programs etc interacting with each other. It was assumed that the programmers would do it right. So the whole linux branch of Unix is built on the same idea, not strict type extensions used as a basis for system organisation. It just happens to be the case that the early c compilers that were used to build unix had file extensions to make interaction with object, source and compiled files easier to use. So they've stuck.\nWindows doesn't use type extensions to help human users, but because the structures it uses are far less flexible.\nFinally, gnu/linux/ubuntu are also learning experiences of necessity and you should have a positive attitude to the differences between them and Windows, because you are really going to learn how computers work by doing that.\n", "Q: Can't mount shared folder in Ubuntu 12.10 Server Guest Virtual Box I have filled out the shared folder options in Settings -> Shared Folders of a shared folder with a name of 'share'.

Thank you!\n\nA: Resize your Windows partition from Windows. If Ubuntu says it can't tell how much space is used then that's a pretty big red flag to me to not mess with it, from Ubuntu at least. If it can't see what's inside the partition then it won't be able to move it or resize it likely.\nYou should be able to make a logical partition in the empty space you create that can hold a partition for Ubuntu and Linux swap.

Is this possible, and if so, how?\n\nA: Meng Tian already answered this question here, but the answer is probably even more relevant to my question. Since I did things slightly differently, I'm posting my own answer here.\nYou can launch programs with a different style/theme by placing GTK2_RC_FILES=/usr/share/themes/YourFavoriteTheme/gtk-2.0/gtkrc before your program's command when running the program from the command line.\nFor example, if you wanted to run leafpad with the Bluebird style/theme, you could just enter this at the command line:\nGTK2_RC_FILES=/usr/share/themes/Bluebird/gtk-2.0/gtkrc leafpad\n\nIf you want to make this simpler, you can create an executable .sh script file and put this code in it:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nGTK2_RC_FILES=/usr/share/themes/Bluebird/gtk-2.0/gtkrc leafpad \"$@\"\n\nIf you do this, you can also create a launcher for this script which will launch the program in the correct style.\nNote: the \"$@\" allows you to pass arguments through your script to your program. This was all I needed for my purposes, but if you need to do something fancy like pipe output to the program, this script may not work.\n", "Q: How to fix Netbeans 7.4 (and Netbeans 8.0) Ugly Text and Popups in Ubuntu 13.10?

Either would work. All I want is for the chipset to be supported out-of-the-box on Ubuntu. I won't always be around, so whenever a system update gets installed, I don't want to have to recompile some obscure drivers for the server's Wifi to work.\nNdiswrapper is also out of the question, as I have tested it and have found it to be quite unstable, especially when streaming large files over large periods of time.\n\nI need something that has mainstream, integrated kernel support. I looked on the usual pages in the Ubuntu docs, as well as various forum posts and a number of web sites, but after roughly four hours of research (kill me now), the only thing I'm sure of is that Linux has always had trouble with supporting Wifi cards, and while less bad today, the problem is still somewhat present.\n\nCan anybody recommend a stable, no-hack-necessary Wifi card or dongle that will work out-of-the-box with Ubuntu 13.10?\nThank you very much for your time!\n\nA: If you haven't already did this.

I have a 3TB Seagate internal drive that I've been using on Windows for a while. My PC doesn't have UEFI, and I needed to boot Windows from the Seagate drive, so I couldn't format it as GPT (Windows doesn't allow booting from a GPT disk with a legacy BIOS). The only way to see all 3TB was to use Seagate's DiscWizard utility. Please note that although DiscWizard also has backup functions, my only use for it was the driver it installs that makes a 3TB drive look like two separate drives, one of 2TB and one of about 800GB. This question has nothing to do with backup.\nI just installed Ubuntu 13.10 today, on a different drive. I'm not using any kind of dual boot scheme, I just pick which drive to boot from with the BIOS.\nWhen I'm in Ubuntu, I can see the 2TB portion of the Seagate drive, but not the 800GB part. I went to the Seagate website to see if they had a Linux version of DiscWizard, but apparently they don't. The drive is almost full, so I really, really don't want to reformat it.\nSo my question is, is there any driver for Ubuntu that will allow me to see the last 800GB of my data, without forcing me to back up all 3TB and reformat it?\nThank you. \n\nA: My recommendation is to bite the bullet: Back up the disk, repartition it, and restore the data. I admit that I know nothing about this DiscWizard software, but I know from experience that such things tend to be non-standard and to be unusable outside of their designed environments (in this case, Windows).\nMoving forward, see my answer to this question (which it seems you've also answered).

To take advantage of full HDD capacity I have to use GPT partition table. I want to dual-boot Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 13.10 (64-bit) from this HDD.\nFrom what I find out for now (from AskUbuntu and my own tests) is that Ubuntu can support GPT partition table even without UEFI on motherboard while Windows 8.1 needs UEFI to do that.\n\n\n*\n\n*Will Ubuntu 13.10 in fact boot from HDD with GPT partition table when only legacy BIOS is available?\n\n*If Ubuntu can boot that way, what is stopping Windows from doing so? I know that answer for that question might be outside of the scope of AskUbuntu, but it might give full picture. In other words - how is Ubuntu superior to Windows that it can boot from GPT-partitioned HDD even with only legacy BIOS available?\n\n*Is there any way to dual-boot Windows and Ubuntu from 3TB HDD in a way that at least lets Ubuntu use full capacity while leaving Windows with less space?\n\n\nA: *\n\n*The answer to your first question is yes, because I am doing it now.  \n\n*I would guess it's probably a Microsoft design decision to encourage adoption of UEFI, rather than a technical reason.  UEFI allows Secure Boot and similar stuff that is more important to MS than to its customers.\n\n*I don't know of a way to let windows boot from GPT with a legacy BIOS, but there are a couple of ways you can work around the restriction.  \n\n\nOne is to run Windows in a VM under Ubuntu. \nThe other is to run Windows from a second hard drive, formatted as MBR. Just install Ubuntu on the GPT drive as a single boot system, Windows on the MBR drive as a single boot system, and use the BIOS to pick which one to boot from (on my PC, you just hit F12 during the POST to get a boot device menu).  It's a lot easier than mucking around with Microsoft's byzantine BCD scheme.  You only need about 30GB for a Win 8.1 pro system partition, and you can buy much bigger drives than that for very cheap.  If necessary, you can still have an NTFS partition on your big drive for your Windows data.\n\nA: I basically agree with user225005 -- the Windows limitation is, in a technical sense, in its boot loader; the BIOS-mode boot loader requires the use of MBR, and Microsoft has decided (for whatever business reason) to not support GPT. In theory, somebody might be able to write a BIOS-mode boot loader for Windows that would support GPT, but I don't know how hard it would be in practice. (There may be things further up the stack that would flake out.)\nUsing a second drive, as user225005 suggested, is the simplest way to work around the problem. If that's impractical, you might look into using the Developer's UEFI Environment (DUET) or Clover. These are both EFI implementations that can be installed like a boot loader on a BIOS-based computer. DUET is intended for developers and is not easy to install, but the page to which I linked includes pointers that should help. Clover is a Hackintosh (OS X on standard PC) boot loader, which is easy to install from a Hackintosh environment, but there's no documentation about installing or using it without OS X. Both work well on many Intel-based systems, but they don't get along as well with AMD CPUs. FWIW, I'm booting a laptop via DUET, which works reasonably well -- but I wouldn't recommend that the average user set this up unless it's absolutely necessary.\nAnother option is to use a hybrid MBR. This is an ugly and dangerous hack that enables Linux to see the whole disk via GPT and Windows to see up to three partitions via a modified MBR. Macs rely on hybrid MBRs when dual-booting with Windows, and you could do the same for a Linux/Windows dual-boot. As detailed on the page to which I linked, though, hybrid MBRs are very flaky, and a mistake when using them (such as using a Windows partitioning tool to modify your partitions) can lead to disaster. If it's a choice between the two, I'd recommend you try DUET or Clover first, and then fall back on a hybrid MBR only if you can't get DUET or Clover to work.\n", "Q: unable to connect or detect internet single from our router I have just installed Ubuntu on my wife's HP and for some reason the wireless is not picking up our internet provided by our building.\nWhat can I do?

How to clear text that existed in a text file without opening it?\nI mean for example I have a file as hello.txt with some text data in it, and how can I clear the total text in that file without opening it?\nBy this, I mean not using any editor like nano, Gedit, etc.\n\nA: Another approach - cp the /dev/null to the file\nxieerqi:$ cat testFile.txt                                                                                        \nFilesystem     1K-blocks     Used Available Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda1      115247656 83100492  26269816  76% /\nnone                   4        0         4   0% /sys/fs/cgroup\nudev             2914492        4   2914488   1% /dev\ntmpfs             585216     1152    584064   1% /run\nnone                5120        0      5120   0% /run/lock\nnone             2926072    98096   2827976   4% /run/shm\nnone              102400       76    102324   1% /run/user\n\nxieerqi:$ cp /dev/null testFile.txt                                                                               \n\nxieerqi:$ cat testFile.txt\n\nxieerqi:$ \n\nWhy does this work and how does this work ? The testFile.txt will be opened  with O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC flags, which means if the file exists - it will be truncated, which means contents discarded and size set to zero. This is the same flag with which > operator in shell opens the file on the right of that operator. \nNext, cp will attempt to read from /dev/null and after reading 0 bytes will simply close both files, thus leaving testFile.txt truncated and contents effectively deleted.\nKnowing that, we could in theory use anything that allows us to open a file with O_TRUNC. For instance this:\ndd of=testFile.txt count=0\n\nSmall difference here is that dd won't perform any read() at all. Big plus of this dd version is that it is POSIXly portable. The dd specifications state:\n\nIf the seek= expr conversion is not also specified, the output file shall be truncated before the copy begins if an explicit of= file operand is specified, unless conv= notrunc is specified. \n\nBy contrast cp /dev/null testFile.txt isn't necessarily portable, since POSIX specifications for cp cover what happens only if source_file is non-regular and when -r/-R flags are specified (big thanks to Stephen Kitt for pointing this out), but not what happens when -r or -R are omitted, which is the case here. However it appears at least GNU cp defaults to using rule 3 in the same spec, which is truncating the existing file without changing its type. \n\nA: Not the shortest answer but...\nThis answer is based on another from Super User. Although not the shortest bash command, truncate is the most readable for average newbies:\n$ echo Hello > Hello.txt\n$ echo World! >> Hello.txt\n$ cat Hello.txt\nHello\nWorld!\n$ truncate -s 0 Hello.txt\n$ ll Hello.txt\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 rick rick 0 Mar 20 17:32 Hello.txt\n\nParameters used with truncate command here:\n\n*\n\n*\"-s\" set the size\n\n*\"0\" size will be zero\n\nClear everything except first 10,000 bytes\nAn advantage of truncate is you can specify how much to keep, not just zero:\n$ truncate -s 10000 Hello.txt\n\n... will truncate everything after the first 10,000 bytes. This could be useful if a program went crazy and dumped many Megabytes of data into a small log file:\n\n*\n\n*Run the truncate command for a reasonable larger normal size of 10K\n\n*Open the file with your text editor and press End\n\n*Highlight and PgUp to delete the remaining bytes that don't belong (usually recognizable by ASCII garbage characters).\n\n\nA: The easiest way is to truncate a file is to redirect the output of the shell no-op command (:) to the file you want to erase.\n: > hello.txt\n\n\nA: If a file was created with the name hello.txt and was provided with some texts then the below command in terminalctrl+alt+t will remove all the text in the hello.txt file,\necho \"\" > hello.txt\n\n\n\nA: I have to do this all the time with log files. The easiest way I have found is with the following command:\ncat /dev/null > hello.txt\n\nThis deletes allo of the content of the file, and leaves you with an empty file without having to open it  in an editor, select text,  any of that stuff. More specifically what it does is to replace the contents of the file with the contents of \"/dev/null\", or nothing. It's pretty slick, actually.\nThe only caveat is that the user you are currently logged in as must have write permission to said file.\n\nA: Just open your terminal with CTRL+ALT+Tand type as \n > hello.txt\n\nthat's it, your data in that file will be cleared with out opening it even .\nExample:\n\n\nA: I am also going to use redirection like rajagenupula's answer. But there is a little more flexibility. Open a terminal and type,\ncat > hello.txt\n\nAnd press Ctrl+C. It will wipe out the previous file. If you want upto this much it is fine. \nIf you wish you can do something more after wiping the file. In this way not only you can wipe a file without opening but also you can write a few lines with proper formatting in the file. Say you wish to write \"Ubuntu is the best OS\" after wiping the file, just do\ncat > hello.txt\nUbuntu is the \nbest OS\n\nThen press Ctrl+C. Now the previous file is wiped out. At the same time words are there in two lines as I put them.\nSee the example:\n\n\nA: vi filename -c ':1,$d' -c ':wq'\n\nworked the best for me because of the particular permission it had\n\nA: So, I see a lot of redirections being used to answer this ;)\nA little different approach with the combo: rm & touch\nrm hello.txt && touch hello.txt\n\n(yeah... yet another cheat!)\nSo with this command combo the file hello.txt wasn't opened and in the end you still have file hello.txt in its place with the contents cleared.

When I installed 13.10 I had the same issue with flash. The issue is that Ubuntu no longer ships with flash.\nIn the software center try looking for the package Adobe Flash Plugin. This should give you the latest version of flash available for Ubuntu. Your browser will need to be restarted after the fact though.

There's a few useful options, such as viewing only a specific user.\n\nA: /var/log/auth.log\n\nThat contains a lot more than just plain logins (sudo calls, etc) but logins are in there too.

Windows has a signature system which allows you to make sure that an executable hasn't been modified after it has been signed. I used to use this as a security measure in Windows.\n\n\nDoes linux have such a system which allows developers to put signatures in executables and .debs so that the user can verify them? So, for example some one gives me a modified version of a program. I can see if the programs signature is valid or if it has a signature in the first place.\n\nA: Software that is in the repositories does not really need a signature. We can assume that the software coming from those can be trusted. \nBut it is possible to check it through its md5 checksum. Launchpad page on MD5 checksum step 2:\n\nStep 2: Open a terminal, change to the directory where you have saved the file and accompanying signature, then enter the following:\n\ngpg --verify signaturefilename\n\n\nReplace signaturefilename with the signature's filename.\ngpg will now try to check the signature against the signer's public key. If your version of gpg is configured to retrieve public keys automatically, you can skip to step 4. Otherwise, you'll need to fetch the signer's public key manually. \n\n\nA: DigSig (Digital Signature... in the Kernel) and DSI (Distributed Security Infrastructure), but unfortunately, this project is no longer maintained. \nDigSig, is a Linux kernel module, which checks RSA digital signatures of ELF binaries and libraries before they are run. Binaries are to be signed with BSign.\nDSI (Distributed Security Infrastructure), is a security framework which targets distributed environments, and is meant to address any specific security issue such platforms may be concerned with. More particularly, it is meant to address security needs of carrier-grade Linux clusters, for the telecommunication domain.DigSig\n", "Q: Wrong cursor directions and brackets in right to left languages I successfully write in Arabic.\nBut there's a problem with symbols like brackets (), <> , and full stops.

But not all application have it or use it by default.\nWith Logical Cursor Movement, the cursor move as visual in LTR languages but it look like reversed in RTL languages. You should think: Left as Backward and Right as Forward.\nLogical cursor movement was counted by RTL languages users as bug, before implementing visual movement algorithm. Nowadays, GTK/Qt/KDE covers such missing option in applications as Unicode become universal standard. So most applications developed using these kits use visual cursor movement.\n\n\n*\n\n*Gedit uses visual cursor.\n\n*As I know, LibreOffice (which I think you was aiming to) supports both with Logical as default.

Why does SSH want to use a home directory which isn't even there? I'm logged in as example2.\n\nA: The way a simple SSH command work is as follows:\nssh user_name@host\n\nIf you omit user_name and just run ssh host it will assume that you mean the same user that is currently logged in to your machine. Let's say your login is jdoe, then it will become equivalent to ssh jdoe@host.\nPlease note that the user that you are logging in as must be a valid user to be logged on to that computer. With some exceptions, that probably do not apply in this case, you should be able to go to that machine and log in locally by using that particular user name and the password that you have entered.\nIf you control both machines and wish to create a user on the remote one, you need to run:\nsudo adduser user_name\n\nJust change user_name to the name that you wish your user to be, once again if that is jdoe you would type sudo adduser jdoe. You will be asked for password, name of the user, etc.\nAlternatively you can use useradd command, but it is a lower level command, and should probably be avoided.

If for some reason this does not work with your provider we need to know why and what we have to address manually.\nA lot can be changed with ncpa and only stating that you have access via their website is not very clear, do you mean they run a proxy at that address, or is this the address from their gateway? Do you get an ip-adres automatically or do we have to assign by hand? etc\nTo install a program through commandline you use: sudo apt-get install programname\n,but if you are a newbie I would start with the graphical interface.\nKeep your questions simple, you now ask for several things in one item, and just some troubleshooting commands can take books to describe if you do not properly address what you want to find/fix.\n", "Q: Ubuntu OS security My friend suggest me Ubuntu OS instead of windows 7 because on ubunut no virus,trojan,rootkit this is true ?\nThanks,\nMichi\n\nA: Yes and no. Mostly yes:\nFirstly, the way linux handles ownership of files, programs run by the user do not automatically have permission to alter system files, and that is what a virus tends to want to do. This makes it intrinsically much more safe than Windows even when people do write malware to attack it. It is often said that as so many less people are on linux there are almost no viruses (etc) written for it, whether this is because of the shear difficulty of writing the viruses, or because of the lack of effort is (arguably) not the point. The reality is there is almost no malware.\nSecondly, any security problems which are detected in linux are patched quickly and update automatically, no need for lots of extra (often expensive or annoying) protection software. So it is a lot safer, but the idea that there is absolutely no malware is not strictly true.\n\nA: Viruses exist for all platforms, but they tend to affect the Windows world more because:\n\n\n*\n\n*There are simply more Windows machines available to attack.\n\n*The Linux security model (user-level security) used in Ubuntu is VASTLY superior to that of Windows.\n\n\nBasically, using Ubuntu (Linux) puts you more ahead in the game than a Windows user (ex: not allowing you to log-in to the GUI as root by default), but it can't save you from bad habits or bad system administration.  Don't log-in as root, don't run a web browser as root or via sudo, and don't download software that you don't trust.  Good habits go a long way, and Ubuntu makes it easier to employ good habits.\nThis question Do I need to have 'antivirus software' installed? does a great job of detailing this subject.\n", "Q: STC Alcatel X080S Modem not working in Ubuntu 13.10 I am really blank, don't know what to do.

Plugged the USB device into my Linux box WITHOUT the USB hub ... success!\nMoral of the story: Not all USB hubs supply enough power in each direction to qualify a device as being a mountable device.  It would be so nice in these circumstances if one got a pop-up from auto-mount or somebody saying something like \"USB device blah-blah-blah does not qualify as a mountable device\" - or at least, insert something that dmesg could yell about.

I typically work with a local XAMPP stack with staging copies of my production environments. \nI'd really like to be able to open a file I'm working on in a web browser. Obviously I can open the browser and visit the localhost/whatever URL, but I'm hoping there might be some sort of nifty right-click type solution. \nAnyone know of anything. Or do I have to dust off the old C skills and try to programme a plugin myself? \nThanks for your help. \nJ \n\nA: yes you can do it. Just type the file path in the URL area and then it will loads. \nas you said you just want to open the text file.\n\nA: I am not allowed to comment for clarification yet, so I will answer. It sounds like you are looking to open source files you are editing, .php .css .js in your browser instead of gedit.\nTo do this, in Nautilus, right click on a file you want to open in your browser, a .php file for example. From the drop-down menu, choose 'Properties'\nIn the window that opens, click the third tab over \"Open with\"\nFrom this tab you may choose your desired program, firefox, chromium, etc, and then click the 'Set as default' button. If you do not see the browser you want to open them with, you can click 'Show other applications'\nAfter this .php files will open in your browser, and if you right click, there should be a \"Open with Text Editor\" to open them in gedit for editing.\nHope this helps\n\nA: I don't think this is possible \"out of the box\". But it should be pretty easy to do with a bash script.\nIf you look at the nautilus page for making a bash script appear in the context menu.\nYou should be able to use NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_CURRENT_URI to check if the file is inside the correct folder for your server to run it. Then be able to use NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_FILE_PATHS to get the file you selected. An example which should work as long as you don't select more than one file is (And if you are in the wrong directory it will open your local host!):\n#!/bin/bash\nserverloc=/path/to/server\nNAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_FILE_PATHS=$(echo \"$NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_FILE_PATHS\"| grep  \"$serverloc\")\nfirefox localhost${NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_FILE_PATHS:${#serverloc}} > file.txt\n\nJust save that as LoadOnServer.sh in\n~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts or ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts (depending on verion of nautilus, see comment below). And open this directory in the terminal and run:\n    chmod +x LoadOnServer.sh\nNow right click on a file.

I have Ubuntu 13.10 and Windows 7 installed on my computer. Even if most of the time I use  Ubuntu, I would like to upgrade win7 to win8.1 (as student I have it free). \nI'm wondering if the installation of Windows does not work without touching the dual boot or the ubuntu partition or ubuntu configuration.\nCan I go on without be worry?\n\nA: It depends.  If you have installed Ubuntu and Windows in UFEI mode, my guess is that everything should be fine.  However if your boot loader is stored on an MBR Windows will definitely overwrite Grub.\nIn either case, it's best to just make a boot-repair-disk that will automagically fix grub.

You add virtual interfaces to the \"physical\" interface. \n\nA: It looks like this is actually not supported. What you can do is add several up or post-up stanzas which can then add addresses to an interface. I opted for this solution:\nauto eth0.10\niface eth0.10 inet static\n    address 192.168.1.61\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n    post-up ip address add 192.168.1.62 dev $IFACE\n\n", "Q: Black screen appears when I select Ubuntu at the boot screen I tried to install ubuntu 12.10 but the installation didn't complete.

This isn't desirable as that's where the rest of the traffic is running whereas 172.16.0.0 network is dedicated to the iSCSI link. Having said that, I can manually initiate the link to the iSCSI target using:\nsudo iscsiadm -m node --targetname \"iqn.2000-01.com.store\" --portal \"172.16.0.1:3260,0\" --login\n\nThis works fine, but again, needs this to be automatic.\nPlease let me know if there's a way to handle this.\nThanks!!\n(Please note that I've obfuscated the target name for privacy)\n\nA: It looks like there are a couple ways of doing this. The quick and dirty way is to delete the /etc/iscsi/nodes/iqn*/whateverIP directory for each one you don't want. \nAlternatively, you can edit the 'default' file under each iqn to change connection from automatic to manual. But, if you do another discovery, your changes will be overwritten.\nThere also appears to be a way to bind an physical NIC to an iface file which will allow you to control the network that the iscsi traffic flows. \n", "Q: Using GParted to rescue data and format hard drive to NTFS I'm having problems booting to Windows XP due to bad sectors on the hard drive.

The licensing of the software in Ubuntu does not restrict the hardware on which it can be installed. The only restrictions are technical (is your computer the same architecture, is the boot system handled in the normal way, etc…).\nYou didn't say which iMac you have, but if it is a PowerPC machine, it may be more troublesome, as more modern versions of Ubuntu aren't as well supported on PPC any longer. Also, some apps are heavily dependant on x86 optimizations, and may not be available on PPC at all (depending on what you are wishing to do with the machine). For basic usage, you should be fine, though.\nIf it's a newer Intel iMac, then of course it should work better, and you will be able to do more with it.\n", "Q: Using different wallpapers on multiple monitors (Gnome 2 + Compiz) This seems like a simple question, yet I could not find any satisfying answer using Google or Ask Ubuntu.\nSo I have a triple-monitor setup. Basically what I want is simply to have a different background on each of the three monitors. Now I am not speaking about different virtual desktops (aka workspaces) here. Most of the solutions I googled were about different backgrounds on different workspaces. I have only the one workspace, but three monitors, like so:\n\nMonitor 1 (on top) is my big TV that's attached to the wall above my two normal monitors.\nI am using Gnome 2 with Compiz (aka gnome-session-fallback aka Gnome Classic (with effects) in the login manager dropdown list) on Ubuntu 13.04.\nI tried the following methods trying to set a different background for each monitor:\n\n\n*\n\n*ccsm (compiz-config-settings-manager), that is, setting a background via the window manager (Compiz). More precisely, I used the Wallpaper plugin of Compiz. \n\n*gnome-control-center, that is, setting a background via the Gnome System Settings. More precisely, I used the Background panel in the Gnome System Settings.\n\n*XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=Unity gnome-control-center, that is, settting a background via the Gnome System Settings, but mimicking Unity behavior. More precisely, I used the Appearance panel in the Gnome System Settings.\n\n\nHowever, none of these methods seem to enable me to select a different background for each monitor. In each case, I can only set a single background (or possibly several that can then be cycled periodically, or used for different workspaces) for all three monitors. Then, I typically have options like center, tile, crop or scale that control how this single background is rendered across the three monitors.\nThe workaround I have gone with so far is to use Gimp to create one \"big\" background that encompasses the entire virtual resolution of all three monitors together. Basically, I create one big background image of size 3840x2160, in which I paste three backgrounds at the right places. Then I set this big background as the single background for the three monitors using possibility (1) or (3) above, and use the span option to span this big background across all three monitors. This results in three different backgrounds on the three monitors, provided the three smaller backgrounds were placed correctly on the big background image (Note: possibility (2) does not offer a span option).\nHowever, this seems like an awful hack to achieve such a simple thing as setting a different background for each of my monitors. It also has several disadvantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I want to change the arrangement of the monitors (the big TV on top can be slided some way to the left or to the right, and I like to adjust the monitor positions accordingly using xrandr or an associated GUI such as the Displays panel in the Gnome System Settings, so as to keep mouse movement intuitive), clearly the upper background does not slide along with the monitor it's supposed to be displayed on, which means I only see part of the upper background.\n\n*The big background has some gray areas (dead space) in the upper corners that are uselessly loaded at login time by Compiz or Gnome when the big background is loaded.\n\n*Worst of all, when I want to change a single one of the three backgrounds, then I have to gimp-edit the whole big background. This is too much work considering I simply want to change a single background (yep, I know about Gimp layers, but still) - this ought to be possible with a few clicks and without a heavy-weight image manipulation program.\n\n\nThe first point means this workaround is not robust. The second means it is not efficient. And the third means it's a pain in the butt :)\nSo my question is this:\nIs there some way - using either Gnome 2 or Compiz - to simply tell the system that I want a different background for each monitor? This would be the logical approach to me, as it would actually tell the system what my intention is. It would also be more efficient.\nReally, it feels like this cannot be such an uncommon scenario. I would think many people have multiple monitors; and at least some of those must prefer to have different backgrounds on these monitors. So can it be true that there is no straightforward solution, and users are expected to come up with awful hacks such as creating their own custom backgrounds with heavy-weight programs in order to get this to work?\n\nA: From webupd8.org it seems there are 2 options. (copy from the website plus some extra things added by me):\nThe default Ubuntu Appearance settings doesn't let you span a single large wallpaper across both monitors or use a different wallpaper for each monitor, but there are two applications that you can use to do this.\n\n\n*\n\n*The first one is SyncWall. Install it in Ubuntu using the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install syncwall\n\n\nHere's how my desktops looks like after using SyncWall:\n\nCurrent Features\n\n\n*\n\n*Scheduling : you can change wallpaper at start-up, by interval or at fixed time\n\n*Ability to use/define system hot-keys to change wallpaper manually.\n\n*Basic multi-monitor support in order to share the wallpaper across screens\n\n*Ability to add some special effects (emboss, edge, blur, ...) to the displayed wallpaper.\n\n*Ability to rate images in order to display them more often (if random order is selected)\n\n*Several resizing methods and background filling\n\n*Network synchronization of wallpaper change by defining a server and clients. Display parameters are shared across the network (same resizing type on all the desktops)\n\n*Supported files :SyncWall uses Qt plugins to load image, so by default it can read basic formats as BMP, PNG, JPG. You can add more formats if needed by using bridge plugins to the FreeImage or the Devil libraries.\n\n*For linux platform, the common windows managers are supported (Gnome, Gnome3, KDE3, KDE4, XFCE, ...).\n\n\n*Another such tool is nitrogen , which besides being able to set the same wallpaper to extend across displays, it can also be used to set a different wallpaper to each monitor. \nNitrogen is available in the official Ubuntu repositories so to install it, search for it in Ubuntu Software Center or use the following command:\n sudo apt-get install nitrogen\n\nNitrogen doesn't have a desktop file, so run it from the command line:\nnitrogen\n\n\nTo be able to set a different wallpaper for each monitor, you must disable the file manager from handling the desktop. This means you'll no longer have folders on the desktop.\nIn GNOME / Unity, install GNOME Tweak Tool:\n sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool\n\nThen open GNOME Tweak Tool and on the \"Desktop\" section, set \"Have file manager handle the desktop\" to OFF.\nAnd finally, to have the wallpapers restored each time you log in, add \"nitrogen --restore\" to your startup applications.\nHere's how my desktop looks like with different wallpapers for each monitor:\n\nFeatures :\n\n\n*\n\n*Multihead and Xinerama support.\n\n*Recall mode to restore wallpapers via startup script.\n\n*Uses freedesktop.org standard for thumbnails.\n\n*Can set GNOME background.\n\n*Command line set modes for script usage.\n\n*Inotify monitoring of browsed directories.\n\n*Lazy loading of thumbnails - conserves memory (new in 1.3).\n\n*\"Automatic\" set mode - determines best mode to set an image based on its size. (new in 1.4).\n\n*Display preview images in a tiled icon layout (new in 1.5).\n\n\n\n\nNitrogen seems to be the best option. Syncwall seems to be using the hack you described (large image to split across several monitors.\n\nA: Edit (2019): Nitrogen is no longer maintained. Nitrogen doesn't fully work on newer Ubuntu distros.\nYou can use nitrogen\nTo install it, run the following command in terminal:\nsudo apt-get install nitrogen\n\nBecause nitrogen doesn't have a desktop file by default when is installed, you need to run the following command from terminal to start it:\nnitrogen\n\nHow to use it?\n\nIn it's Preferences, add your wallpaper folder, then at the bottom [...] select Screen 1, 2, etc., to set a different wallpaper for each monitor:\n\nTo be able to set a different wallpaper for each monitor, you must\n  disable the file manager from handling the desktop. This means you'll\n  no longer have folders on the desktop.\nIn GNOME / Unity, install GNOME Tweak Tool:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool\n\nThen open GNOME Tweak Tool and on the Desktop section, set Icons on Desktop (previously Have file manager handle the desktop) to OFF.\nAnd finally, to have the wallpapers restored each time you log in, add the following command:\nnitrogen --restore\n\nto your Startup Applications.\n\nSource: UBUNTU MULTI-MONITOR TWEAKS (FULL SCREEN FLASH FIXES, SPAN WALLPAPER ACROSS MONITORS, MORE)\n\nA: the XFCE Desktop Manager Plugin (that comes in the xubuntu-desktop package) allows you to edit each display individually while still retaining the folders on your desktops. \nA screenshot of my 2 desktops with the manager open : \nin the yellow box it says \"Move this dialog to the display you want to edit the settings for.\"\nI'm sorry i cant be more help as to giving instruction on to how to install it, nor what the actual plug in is called ( I tried to find it but decided to re-install the whole package instead ) - But hopefully this leads you or somebody on the right track, and this answer can be improved through edits.\n\nA: HydraPaper is the best option since 2020.\n\nA: I was glad to see there actual was a Gnome/Unity answer.  \nThat said, I still feel switching to KDE might offer a more consistent experence.  \nKDE's native settings manager not only allows for multiple wallpapers across multiple monitors, it allows them to be set differently for each virtual desktop AND Activity. (Activity's a like virtual desktops that contain virtual desktops and can be configured to have different settings, such as a screen-saver after 5 minutes of stillness in one activity, but no timeout when switched to another, say for presentations or movies.)\nMoreover, it handles the addition and subtraction of monitors on the fly (via plugging and unplugging HDMI) without issue!! \n\nA: sudo apt-get install feh\n\nfeh --bg-center <path_to_big_image> --no-xinerama\n\nNo need to hide your icons from desktop\n\nA: I'm looking for a command line method of doing this. Hyrdapaper's OK but I don't want to have to start a GUI to pick my images. I have a script that already handles all of that, setting images are predetermined intervals. I just need to know how to set each monitor separately and/or span an image. feh looked like it might be a solution however it doesn't actually set the wallpaper. Or rather it says it but doesn't show it until the terminal I'm typing the command in loses focus (I have pointer focus on). Then the background changes for a second then goes back to my current background.\nNote I'm using Mate with Compiz if that matters.\n", "Q: Resizing my /home partition from ubuntu I currently have Ubuntu 13.10 installed, with a separate partition for / and for /home. The question I have is can I resize the /home partition from the Ubuntu installation or is it better to boot live usb? \n\nA: IMO it is best to manage your partitions when running a live USB. You would then manage your partitions with gparted (graphical interface).\nYou likely have to first unmount the hard drive swap partition (you can unmount partitions from the gparted interface).\nYou may have to resize in steps depending on your layout.\nmake / smaller (put the free space adjacent to /home) -> apply changes -> make /home larger -> apply changes\nIf you are using LVM or extended partitions it may be mor ecomplicated.\n", "Q: Environment variable is not update I try to set the $PATH reference to the current working directory, one machine work as expected, but another machine is not.\nbasically, I have set below line in .bashrc\nexport PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH\n\nif I move directory to /123, I expected that the $PATH will updated to /123/bin:$PATH but it isn't.\nAre there anyway to make it read the current $PWD to use in $PATH?\n\nA: Add the following line in ~/.bashrc to add ./bin directory in PATH\nexport PATH=./bin:$PATH\n\nNext you need to run in terminal source ~/.bashrc to affect the change.\n\nA: If you want to be in the subdirectory bin of the current directory that is ./bin so:\nexport PATH=./bin:$PATH\n\n\nA: The PATH variable is not automatically updated.  When you move a folder such as /home/$USER/bin to /home/$USER/notbin you'll have to manually update your $PATH environment variable.  That will fix the issue.\nIt may also help to manually update the full directory path you're adding to $PATH.  If your directory you're adding to $PATH is /home/$USER/stuff/programs/someprogram/bin then $PWD won't really help you that much.  Therefore, knowing where your stuff is stored, and putting in the full path, will make almost-certain that the correct directory ends up in the $PATH variable.  (since .bashrc is located in your ~ dir, $PWD inside of ~/.bashrc will always be your home directory, when its called.)\n", "Q: How do I get my Rock Candy Xbox Controller t work on Ubuntu -- [ ERROR ] ------------------------------------------------------\nNo Xbox or Xbox360 controller found\n\nBus 001 Device 002: ID 8087:0024 Intel Corp.

Xboxdrv won't recognize it and it seems even the computer will not.\n\nA: Try the steps from this post. Basically it involves two steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing xboxdrv from a PPA which contains a more updated version of the package: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:grumbel/ppa && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install xboxdrv\n\n*Blacklisting the xpad driver by adding blacklist xpad to your /etc/modprobe/blacklist.conf\n\nA: Here was my solution.\n\n*\n\n*Download the source code for xboxdrv from here:\nhttp://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/xboxdrv/\n\n\n*I used the 0.87 version: xboxdrv-linux-0.8.7.tar.bz2\n\n\n*Extract it using the tar command in a useful directory:\ntar xvjf xboxdrv-linux-0.8.7.tar.bz2\n\n\n\n*Determine the USB ID of the controller by running watch lsusb and then plugging in the controller. The device should pop up note down the ID. Example: 0e6f:011f\n\n\n*In the src directory find the xpad_device.cpp file. (Not the hpp version!)\n\n\n*Open the file. Inside you should see a list of devices.\n{ GAMEPAD_XBOX360,          0x24c6, 0x5000, \"Razer Atrox Arcade Stick\" },\n{ GAMEPAD_XBOX,             0x045e, 0x0202, \"Microsoft X-Box pad v1 (US)\" },\n{ GAMEPAD_XBOX360_GUITAR,   0x1430, 0x4748, \"RedOctane Guitar Hero X-plorer\" },\n{ GAMEPAD_XBOX_MAT,         0x0738, 0x4540, \"Mad Catz Beat Pad\" },\n\n\n\n*Copy one of the entries and modify it to reflect your controller.\n{ GAMEPAD_XBOX360,          0x0e6f, 0x011f, \"Rock Candy Gamepad for Xbox 360\"},\n\n\n\n*Install required libraries for compilation. For other distros these  may be different. This list can also be found in the README.md file included with the tarball.\nsudo apt-get install \\\n  g++ \\\n  libboost1.42-dev \\\n  scons \\\n  pkg-config \\\n  libusb-1.0-0-dev \\\n  git-core \\\n  libx11-dev \\\n  libudev-dev \\\n  x11proto-core-dev \\\n  libdbus-glib-1-dev\n\n\n\n*Uninstall xboxdrv if you already have it installed.\nsudo apt-get remove xboxdrv\n\n\n\n*cd to the extracted xboxdrv directory and run scons.\ncd /home/foxyv/Downloads/xboxdrv-linux-0.8.7\nscons\n\n\n\n*After scons is done configuring the build, run make.\n\n\n*When make is finished building, run sudo make install to install the compiled application.\n\n\n*Plug in your controller! You may need to restart the xboxdrv daemon using sudo service xboxdrv restart\n\nA: I tried long and hard to get xboxdrv to work with this controller. I recompiled the source code but it would crash. The driver built into the kernel worked but it wasn't loading by default. That was an easy fix.\nI just had to run modprobe xpad as root. When I unplugged the controller and plugged it back in, it lit up.\nTo make it start on boot make a file in /etc/modules-load.d/xpad.conf with the contents xpad and make sure the systemd-modules-load.service is enabled with systemctl.\n", "Q: Relay access denied error 554 I'm having trouble setting up a mail server, after following this tutorial I am still unable to send email to anyone outside of my server.\nI have installed and configured PostFix, Dovecot, Squirrellmail \nThe exact error message I get is: \n\nTransaction failed 554 5.7.1 email@example.com: Relay access\n  denied\n\nThere could be an issue with my PostFix config file below (mail_version = 2.9.3)\n# See /usr/share/postfix/main.cf.dist for a commented, more complete version\n\n\n# Debian specific:  Specifying a file name will cause the first\n# line of that file to be used as the name.

A few of them are webapp shortcuts like Tweetdeck that I created from the Chrome web browser. I have no idea where it is stored on the hard drive or how it's called or how to find it, assuming that setting the full program name as command in the startup application window would start it up on login (like thunderbird launches Thunderbird).\nAdditionally I'd like each one of those programs to be displayed on a specific workspace (I use a 3*3 virtual desktop setting), like Tweetdeck showing on workspace 2 and Thunderbird showing on workspace 3. Preferably without the need of installing software, rather a script or extra command.\n\nA: In chrome, open up tweetdeck. On the right-hand side of chrome, click the Menu button, then choose Settings.\nIn the settings tab, under \"On Startup\" choose \"Continue where I left off\"\nYou can close chrome, and re-open it to test. Now everytime chrome is started, it should have tweetdeck open, unless you close tweetdeck. Feel free to add other tabs or apps and it will open all those too.\nFrom Dash Home start typing \"Startup Applications\" and click to open it.\nClick on 'Add'.\nName it, browse for the command you want to open, add a comment if you wish.\nIn your case, browse to /usr/bin/ then click on \"google-chrome\", and hit the Open button\nNow each time you startup, chrome will open, and when chrome opens, tweetdeck should be running.\nI am not familiar with opening specific windows in specific workspaces, but I believe that is already answered here:\nHow can I get a startup application to run in another workspace other than #1?\nThat describes a program called devilspie as well as the Compiz method\nScript to run the shortcut:\n#!/bin/bash\n/opt/google/chrome/google-chrome --app-id=hbdpomandigafcibbmofojjchbcdagbl --profile-directory=Default\nexit 0\n\n", "Q: Strange update: \"Safe and Easy Web Browser from Mozilla firefox\" Following one or two updates I have now Mozilla Firefox version 25.0.1 installed on Ubuntu, which works fine. \nToday I noticed that the Ubuntu Update Manager is suggesting me to install a strange \"Safe and Easy Web Browser from Mozilla firefox\" (30.6 Mb) update, along with a transitional package, and English, Hungarian language packs, which is strange, because I have already both English and Hungarian language packs for Firefox 25.0.1 installed. \nAs I know Firefox 25.0.1 is the currently latest version, and Firefox updates comes always with a new identifying sub-number (not named), without language packs.\nHas anyone received such a huge update with that name? What is this? A new, second browser from Firefox, a security update (too large for that, and why sent with language packs), or was it sent by mistake? Do I need it at all?\n\nA: I run 12.04 as well and Firefox is labelled as \"Safe and Easy Web Browser from Mozilla firefox\" in Update Manager\nIt should be safe to update. I am running v 26.0\nThe language pack update is expected with a new version/update\n", "Q: Up arrow and .bash_history have different commands, so where does the up arrow get its data? I seem to have discovered that the ~/.bash_history file doesn't contain what is displayed when you use the up arrow. I found this by doing a command like so\nsmbclient -L 10.2.10.240 -umyuser -p\"mypassword on the command line is bad\" \n\nThis command is actually wrong, it has a mistake, the -u is actually supposed to be a -U and so this command failed. \nHowever I also realized that that was bad to do, because it puts your password into the history, I went into .bash_history and what was interesting was that it doesn't have the mistake. It only has \nsmbclient -L 10.2.10.240 \n\nand that's it. But this is were it gets weird, if you use the up arrow the whole command including mistakes is there for you to edit. \nSo the question is, why is there a difference between what is in .bash_history and what the up arrow displays? Where does the up arrow data live?\nBefore you point it out; it's quite convenient in this case because it prevents my password from being saved, but, that's not why it's doing this, I also tested it with correct options and then it does save the whole command including passwords and all. \n\nA: The ~/.bash_history file is only updated when you close/exit from the terminal. While you are in the terminal you can browse backwards in commands which was entered in that session. So if you exit from that terminal session your history will be updated with the missing command.\nAlso if you put a space at the beginning of a line, before the command, that command won't be saved in the history. This is a good practice if you issue a command which you don't want to be included in the history.\n\nA: Your question is answered but in addition, if you want to enter the realtime data in history you enter: history\nentering !directly followed by the history number re-executed the command, in the man pages you will find some nice ways to alter your command before executing. \n\nA: The main differences between the contents of the history file (which is usually ~/.bash_history) and the current history (which is accessible with the up and down arrows and the history command) are:\n\n\n*\n\n*As others have mentioned, the current shell's history is not usually written to the history file until the shell exits.\n\n*Of equal importance, the current shell's history is not usually read from the history file except when the shell is launched.\n\n\nTo put it another way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Commands in current shell aren't written to the history file until the shell has quit (i.e., it writes them on exit).\n\n*Commands added to the history file (for example, by another concurrently running shell instance) after the current shell has started running are not accessed by the up and down arrows, nor by typing history and pressing Enter.\n\n\nHowever, the history command, which is a shell builtin, has options that change this behavior. You can explicitly tell the shell to read from or write to the history file. Specifically, you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*write this shell's entries to the history file after the existing ones (-a) or instead of them (-w)\n\n*read the history file and add unread entries (-n) or all entries (-r) to this shell's history\n\n*clear this shell's history entirely (-c) or just remove a single entry (-d offset)\n\n\nFor more information:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run help history in a Bash shell.\n\n*Take a look at the Bash Reference Manual, section 9.2 Bash history builtins.\n\n*You may also be interested in Is it possible to make writing to .bash_history immediate?\n", "Q: Laptop won't connect to wireless after 13.10 update This morning I went ahead and ran the software updater to upgrade my Ubuntu which was at 13.04 to the newer 13.10.

I used a usb flash drive and installed ubuntu alongside Windows. After restarting my computer, I was unable to load windows, so I used the boot-repair while in legacy mode. I was able to get back into windows, but after restrating my computer I was not able to get into either Windows or Ubuntu and now the machine wont boot to either OS. It only boots from USB. If I have the USB I used to install linux in the port before I start the machine, it goes directly to the GRUB menu where you can choose either to install or try ubuntu. When there is no flash drive in the port, then I get a message about a failed boot disc. I have tried changing the boot order as well as restoring all default settings. Still nothing is working. I am new to the UEFI and Ubuntu and have never dual booted with the UEFI interface. \n\nA: I think it will be best to step back to your original system:\nHP Restore pre-installed windows8 system\nand then install Ubuntu next to your windows by using the guidelines mentioned in this post:\nInstalling Ubuntu on a pre-installed windows 8 64 bit uefi system\n", "Q: Installing KFaenza Icons on Kubuntu I am unable to install the KFaenza Icon set. Steps tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the Application Appearance section of the KDE System Settings, I clicked on the “download new designs” button. A dialogue pops up which allows you to browse different designs. When clicking on “install”, a few options turn up (apparently different versions). Clicking any option leads to an error.\n\n*I visited the corresponding opendesktop.org page for the KFaenza icon set. Below the description, an array of download options is available. They lead to an expired paste and to “omploader.org” which does not contain a website (the DNS record does not seem to be set up).\nThe opendesktop page also has various comments complaining that the resources have vanished, but offer no solution.\nHow can I install the Faenza icon set for KDE? I could copy the icons over from an old install, but I'd rather not sudo cp something into system folders if avoidable.\n\nA: There are many ways to install the icon themes – this is one\nSearch online for the KFaenza theme, e.g. using the search term: “KFaenza kde rpm”. A hit: http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=kfaenza-icon-theme\nDownload the most recent package: kfaenza-icon-theme-0.8.9-5.fc20.noarch.rpm\nThe RPM can be unpacked to an usable archive with the rpm2cpio command (must be installed first):\n$ rpm2cpio kfaenza-icon-theme-0.8.9-5.fc20.noarch.rpm | cpio -idmv\n\nThis will unpack the KFaenza icon theme into the current directory (./usr/share/icons/KFaenza/...). The options for the cpio command can be viewed online: -i takes the archive from STDIN, -d creates the necessary directories, -m preserves modification times (not strictly necessary), and -v produces verbose output.\nThe unpacked KFaenza folder then has to be copied over into ~/.kde/share/icons/ to make it available:\n\nNow the KFaenza theme can be picked from the KDE System Settings 〉 Application Appearance 〉 Icons. Apply the change, and the KFaenza is there!\n\n", "Q: I want to uninstall Python3 and just use 2.7 I typed in this to the terminal:\nsudo apt-get remove python3\n\nAnd it gave me the following output:\nReading package lists...

I'm still pretty new to Linux, so I haven't been doing a whole lot. The past couple days I've tried installing LAMP, then uninstalled it because I would probably never do anything with it. I then installed SSH, then uninstalled it because I probably would never login to it remotely. Then I install samba so my wife could access the files on my computer from hers and use my PC as a backup.\nAll is fine and well... until I reboot. I am unable to login. I type my password into the password field, and hit enter and nothing happens. If I type the wrong password in, the little wheel spins for 1/2 second then says 'incorrect password'. With the incorrect password, no wheel shows up - the password field fades away and the screen just sits there. I've waited about 10-15 minutes for something to happen, but nothing does.\nI've tried to Google around to solve the issue, but nothing I've seen seems to do the trick. I am able to login through the command line (ctrl-alt-f1) just fine, just am not able to login in through the GUI.\nIve looked at my auth.log and found this:\nlightdm: pam_succeed_if (lightdm:auth): requirement \"user ingroup nopasswdlogin\" not met by user \"andrew\"\n\nI remember seeing something about pam when I was installing/configuring ssh and/or configuring keys for it, but I don't remember specifically what. Plus, I removed ssh shortly after I installed it - so could it still be causing an issue?\nI've tried the following:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm\n\nwhich says nothing and returns me back to the command prompt\nI have tried removing ~/.Xauthority - which didn't help.\nMy .dmrc file is about four lines.

No luck.\nI'm at a loss of what else I can do. Any ideas?\n\nA: I have had the same issue a couple of times, appeared to be something corrupted in my user profile. Removing the following files and directory located in your home directory always gives me back my login:\n.cache/\n.Xauthority \n.ICEauthority\n\nYou can do so by switch to a text-based virtual console (Ctrl+Alt+F1), logging in, and running:\nrm -rf .cache\nrm .Xauthority\nrm .ICEauthority\n\nNo go back with Alt+F7, log in and (hopefully) be happy again.\n\nA: I was able to fix the issue with help from this thread: \nSpecifically, with the following commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\nsudo apt-get -f install\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure ubuntu-desktop\nsudo reboot\n\n\nA: So I came across this problem 2-3 times before. \nSolution to this is simple. Once your free space memory comes close to null, your cache memory and other corresponding memories starts not to respond. So best thing to be done in this scenario is, free up some space from your /home or /opt or /Documents or /Downloads or any software which might take extra space, you should remove it. For this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Ctrl+Alt+F1\n\n*Do login and password\n\n*Remove some items and thereby create free space (this is just like normal terminal, so you do the corresponding task of freeing up some space)\n\n*After enough removal of redundant items, press Alt+F7\n\n*Now, when you login, you will see your normal screen.\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\nA: PROBLEM:\nThis issue occurred for me on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS perhapse because I used following command while researching to solve the issue of graphics not showing 3D menus etc.:\n\"sudo apt-get clean\" or \"sudo apt-get autoclean\"\nand then \"sudo apt-get autoremove\" when suggested by the system (??)\nwhich i think removed so many basic UI level packages from the system.\nWORKAROUND which worked for me:\nFrom recovery mode (boot option) or from login screen press alt+ctrl+F3 to get the terminal.\nInstall ubuntu-desktop by following command:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\nIn my case I hit the \"unmet dependency\" or \"packages held\" problem. To sove it I used aptitude package by following command.\nsudo apt-get install aptitude\nsudo aptitude install ubuntu-desktop\nIf not working then, try following commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get update (again)\nsudo aptitude install aptitude (again)\ncheck if package is installed successfully by using following command:\nsudo dpkg -l ubuntu-desktop\nThen,\nsudo apt-get -f install\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure ubuntu-desktop\nsudo reboot\nAfter that, problem should be resolved. (This also solved the problem of graphics 3D menu effect not showing - the hard problem - may be because all basic level ubuntu packages are removed by command \"sudo apt-get clean\" or \"sudo apt-get autoclean\" or \"sudo apt-get autoremove\" and then installed back by \"ubuntu-desktop\".\nHope this is helpful to others.\n\nA: I had same issue on fresh install of ubuntu 20.04 with gnome 3 (after apparently changing some wrong config value and not installing Software Updater stuff before reboot). These steps helped:\n\n*\n\n*Switch to the gui-less terminal with Ctrl + Alt + F2 shortcut, enter your login and password as prompted.\n\n*Enter following commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\n\n\n*Reboot\n\nLogin should now work\n\nA: I solved the problem by liberating some free space(about 3g). You may cut data stored on your computer from any folder e.g Desktop or Downlload or home etc.\nStep1:\nCtlr+alt+F1\nEnter login and password\nStep2:\nConnect a pen drive or USB or external hard drive with enough free space(nb:depending on how much data you wish to cut)\nSudo fdisk -l (to verify name of storage device)\nSudo mkdir /media/usb\nSudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/usb\n Step3:\nSudo mv Download/. /media/usb \nSudo umount /media/usb \nSudo reboot\n", "Q: How to install the latest IPython notebook in Ubuntu 12.04?

In fact, if select recovery mode it actually brings up the following menu:\nRecover Menu (limited read-only menu)\n  resume - Resume normal boot\n  fsck - Check all file systems (will exit read-only mode)\n  remount - Remount / read/write and mount all other file systems\n  root - Drop to root shell prompt\n\nand if I select resume I get the following output:\n<timestamp> tpm_tis 00:00: tpm_transmit: tpm_send: error 4294967234\ninitctl:Event failed\n\nUbuntu 11.10 <server> tty1\n<server> login:\n\nEverything works fine after that. \nOther things I've noticed:\n1) when booting normally, the Num Lock and Scroll Lock lights on they keyboard show (after pressing the corresponding keys), but the Caps Lock doesn't\n2) Ctrl+Alt+Fx to switch TTY's doesn't work\n3) this link doesn't help much: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Troubleshooting/BlankScreen\nSo, back to the original question: why is my machine not showing anything when booting (in non-recovery mode)?\n\nA: I used GRUB to edit the boot configuration. Appending nomodeset to the end of the main Ubuntu boot configuration so that it looked like this:\nlinux /vmlinuz-3.0.0-12-generic-pae root=UUID=<another long hex value> ro nomodeset\n...did the trick!\n", "Q: Problem with uploading files with filezilla I'm running a nginx server on ubuntu server 12.04.3 LTS but unfortunately I'm not being able to upload files with filezilla to it.

Turns out it was actually caused by the apt-cacher-ng proxy that I use for caching package downloads.

Because originally the upgrade path was 12.10 -> 13.04 -> 13.10. But support for 13.04 was dropped earlier than 12.10, so the new upgrade path is directly 12.10 -> 13.10.

So copy files from the mounted ISO to another folder and then make changes you want. You can then use mkisofs to generate a new ISO from the modified folder.\n\nA: As explained in other answers, ISO images apparently always get mounted as read-only.\nIf you want to make changes to your *.iso image, use a GUI such as ISO Master or Furius ISO Mount. See How to mount an ISO file? for details.\n", "Q: How to update an ISO image using Jigdo? I am trying to update the ISO image of Ubuntu using Jigdo . Can any one explain the exact way to do this ?\n\nA: Jigdo only works with non-live images. Since Ubuntu dropped the Ubuntu Alternate image, the only image that will work with Jigdo is the Ubuntu Server image.  Even then that image is now using some kind of live image to make installation faster so Jigdo won't be nearly as efficient as before.  If you're just looking for ways to minimize the amount of data needed to update a 13.10 64-bit image, you're probably best to use zsync as it seems to be the most efficient way to do delta based updates of the live images.\n", "Q: Bluetooth headset never gives me sound options I have Buffalo headset with microphone that I know works fine becaue I routinely use it on a Windows 7 computer.\nIt connects to my Ubuntu 13.10 computer fine:\n\nBut when I open sound preferences, there is no sound device related to the Buffalo headset (The kenwood is just a USB speaker system):\n\nMy computer usually sends audio to a pulseaudio on another machine where the speakers are connected, as per this answer.

In the sound settings look under the Output tab, there you will find your headset, and change the profile to Telephony Duplex (HSP/HFP).\n\nBut after we did a chat conversation with Dave M G it turned out that his problem was coming from a special network configuration of his pulseaudio services: which is that his sound applications (music players, sound settings, pavucontrol, stc.) were talking directly to the remote pulseaudio server. But the bluetooth daemon on his PC didn't follow suit, it didn't talked to the remote one, instead it tried to connect to the local PA server, which was non existent that time. \nWhen we launched a local PA server in verbose mode it clearly showed that the bluetooth daemon is connecting to the local server, but because every other sound application connected to the remote server there was no sound sent to the local server to hear from the bluetooth headset, and also the BT-headset didn't show up in the sound settings dialogs, because those applications were also manipulating the remote server. After tracing down the problem, Dave M G decided and managed to reconfigure his sound network setup and solve the issue.\n\nA: This worked for me (Using Headset: \"Jabra BT8020\" and Ubuntu 14.04)\nMaybe helpful for other bluetooth headsets as well\nIn a terminal:\n$ pactl load-module module-bluetooth-discover\n\nSource: launchpad: Comment 13 on bug \"blueman and pulse's module-bluetooth-discover (A2DP audio sink devices failed to work with \"bluetoothd : Unable to select SEP\" in system log.)\"\n", "Q: Unable to dual boot Ubuntu with Windows 8 I already have windows 8 installed in c drive of my laptop, am trying to install Ubuntu in D or E drive, it is showing as unable to mount those drives, how to install Ubuntu into D or E drive with out deleting or formatting windows8. please help me thank you.\nMy laptop details:\nHP pavilion G6.\nShould i do any settings in boot-manager?\n\nA: You have to give some no formated free space to ubuntu installation. after installing you can use your drives D and E by mounting them.\nIn general, the concept of Partitions and Drives in linux are different from in windows.\nAll the files are organized like a tree around the root(spelled the directory /) directory which has been chosen at the time of installation.\nin linux you can have your data s in windows partitions format(FAT,NTFS), But sorrilyunfortunately, Windows does not support Linux formats. \n\nA: Download the Ubuntu iso , prepare a live usb, its fairly easy.

Basically, to run an OS, the system needs to access kernel and to load OS into virtual memory to start operation in booting up the system.  GRUB is the 'engine' that is responsible in loading up all of data in order to boot up the system.\nWith Linux structure, a small portion of hard drive is being used for booting up only.  After the OS is being loaded and sync-ed with kernel (BIOS of your motherboard), it'll then mount your main partition where / and /home/yourusername is located.\ntypical structure that is common among Ubuntuians:\nsda1 master disk (where your GRUB resides) - classified as \"primary partition\"\nsda2 as extended partition.  you will never see that partition because it is a \"box\" that hold \"boxes\" such as your sda5 - thus classified as \"extended partition\".  \nsda5 as logical partition where all of your main directory resides in. (i.e. / or /home/yourusername or such).\nThese structures are what enable Linux to operate.  So, these files above are what control and assist in swapping and mounting these partitions so that way your OS can be loaded.\nBut, just a word of caution - these files are not something you would want to mess with, otherwise you might may need to revisit the re-installation of system, who knows.\n", "Q: How to reduce Internet usage for Updating Ubuntu? For better performance Ubuntu needs updating.  But it consumes Internet usage too much. A solution is needed for this.

It will warn you what other items will be removed along with it.  You can also use Ubuntu Software Center to remove some items.\nIf you don't use webmail, remove Thunderbird. If you don't use remote desktop, remove Remmina. If you don't play the default games then remove them also. If you don't use Libreoffice eliminate them as well.

If yes how do I go about this?\n\nA: After a discussion I had on IRC Freenode #ubuntu-unity I have now a solution which I wanted to share.\nIt is fairly easy to turn an ordinary scope into a master scope. To start just create a normal scope e.g. by following the scope tutorial.\nThe only thing which needs to be different is the scope file. Instead of copying it into a specific scope your directly copy it into /usr/share/unity/scopes/. Additionally in the scope file add IsMaster in the scope section\n[Scope]\n...\nIsMaster=true\n\nAs a master scope can define its own filters and categories add those as needed to your scope file as well.

I guess it was the reading many times that made it clear in my mind.\nSecondly I'd be interested to know if any others find that Win7 is slower than WinXP.\nThe broken hard drive has the famous “click noise of death” including when it is fitted into the SATA/USB converter via the newer laptop.   I doubt if that hard drive still works.\nwilf - When you refer to \"disk\" I guess you mean to acquire a blank CD disk.   I have never done that before so would be curious if there is anything I need to know in advance.\nBy the way I found Ubuntu from http://geekyprojects.com/storage/how-to-recover-data-even-when-hard-drive-is-damaged/\n\nI searched for Operating Instructions for Ubuntu Rescue Remix and the best place I've found is http://www.geekyprojects.com/storage/how-to-recover-data-even-when-hard-drive-is-damaged/\n\nA: I would use a USB stick, or disk with Ubuntu on, to boot 1, from which I could work out whether 1's hard drive still works - It would be a 'Live' environment of Ubuntu, with disk and file managers, which should work, and mean youw would not need to install anything.\nBasically, your first method should work OK, but if you do all the stuff from a Ubuntu session on a USB stick or disk, then you would not wipe the Ubuntu install on the 4 hard drive, and could copy all the stuff from 1's broken drive to the new 4 drive form the Live Ubuntu session.\nThis will all depend on the type of 'broken' you mean on the first drive...\n\nHere is a step-by-step guide (tested on Windows 7 Pro 64bit):\nFirst download the Ubuntu 14.04 (latest version of Ubuntu, main version 32bit) from here. This should be perfectly capable of recovering any data etc from your computer, and anything else can likely be installed easily. Note this download will take a while, and will require at least 1 Gigabyte in space.\nThen open where it was downloaded to, right click on the 'ubuntu-14.04-desktop-i386.iso' File and click 'Properties'. You should be able to see something like the following, with similar sizes (note, not all computers and programs may get the exact same size):\n\nThe iso file should be around 970MiB (1017118 KiloBytes) in size - if the download had stopped suddenly try again (I managed to download it fully on the second try using Firefox), or use the torrent download (you can do this with BitTorrent, you can exit it when has downloaded)\nIf you are still not sure the file has been downloaded properly, you can check the MD5SUM of the file, using these instructions, the program available here, and this file with what the MD5SUMs should be (use the one for ubuntu-14.04-desktop-i386.iso).\nYou can then burn the DVD to a disc. There are instructions on that here. You should be able to use the Windows program to do this, you shouldn't need a third-party (other companies) program to do it (if you do, you can use InfraRecorder, instructions on using it are here ).\nInsert a blank DVD (ignore any autorun options), then right click on the downloaded iso file and click 'Burn disc image'. Select the Disc burner, and tick 'Verify after burning' so the disc is checked afterwards. When finished it should show:\nNote: Writing on the disc what you have put on it (ubuntu-14.04-desktop-i386.iso) and the date is great for future reference. Permanent markers work fine for this.\nYou can then check the disk to see if it has been burned correctly - take the disc out and put it in again. You may get this Autorun option (probably a good sign that it has burned correctly): \nSelect 'Open folder to view files' and you should get:\n  \nYou can then eject the disc and put it into the computer you want to recover the files from. When booting, get the computer to boot from the CD/DVD drive. You said you had the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*CD/DVD -  what you want it do, boot from a disc in the CD/DVD drive\n\n*+HDD - boot from the hard disk\n\n*LAN (or PXE or Ethernet) - boot from the internet - this means it will search the connected network for something to boot from, and will return errors if it can't find anything. See also: Preboot Execution Environment\n\n*FDD - Floppy Disk Drive (probably) - is this computer that old? :-)\n\n\nThe only two options that are likely to work ar CD/DVD and HDD - the first will boot from the disc, what you need to \nWhen booting the disc, you should get a purple screen then a screen with the Ubuntu logo. When prompted press 'Try Ubuntu'. This means that Ubuntu will run off the disc, and the memory in the computer - any files you save to Ubuntu's won't be saved as this is in the computer's memory - use a USB stick to save/copy to.\nWhen the desktop loads, open the Nautilus file manager from the launcher on the left. Looking under 'Devices' you should see the entry for the computer's hard disk partitions, as well as a any connected USB drivers. The directory 'Users' (or 'Documents and Settings' for Windows XP) in the root of one of these drives should contain your user's files.\nIf you can't access the disk, you may need to do something else to get the data off of the disc. \n\nRecovering files\nIf you only have command line access to Ubuntu, you can run mc to use the midnight-command file manager:\n\n(You can run mc -a if the lines are not drawn properly)\nThis is a command line file manager - you can find out how to use it here, also here - you can use the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Tab and the arrows keys to navigate\n\n*The function keys:\nF1 - help.\nF2 - user menu (to compress files etc)\nF3 - view (checking contents of a file i think)\nF5 - copy\nF6 - rename or move\nF7 - create a directory\nF8 - delete\nF9 - pull-down - accesses the menu bar at the top.\nF10 - quit. Closes mc, as well as mcedit and any unwanted open menu. \n\n\n*Ctrl+O to switch to and from command line - useful for running mount commands etc\nDevices plugged into the computer should be automounted in the media directory - if not, you will need mount them manually - for example:\n\n\n*\n\n*To make a directory for the partition to mount to\nsudo mkdir /media/windows-partition\n\n\n*To mount the partition - you can find the device (/dev/sda2 for example) from the output of sudo fdisk -l or sudo parted -l - a large partiton (you can find sizes in sudo parted -l) formatted to NTFS or FAT should be the main windows partition. Your user files should be contained within 'Documents and Settings' in the root of the partition.\nsudo mount /dev/sda2 /media/windows-partition/\n\n\n*To unmount the partition, run\nsudo umount /media/windows-partition\n\nYou can then copy the files over using mc - copying should mean you can check whether you have the files you want afterwards.\n\nA: Given that you already have a second working laptop AND a SATA/USB converter, you don't necessarily need to buy another drive - you can transfer it directly onto the new laptop (if it has space).\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove broken drive from old laptop.\n\n*Connect broken drive to the SATA/USB converter.  (Note: if the old hard drive isn't SATA, this won't work and you'd need to do things differently).\n\n*Use data recovery tools on the new laptop to try to copy stuff off the broken drive onto the drive inside the new laptop.\nIf you want to use Ubuntu for data recovery (because it's free), then you will need to  be able to load Ubuntu onto a bootable DVD or bootable USB stick.  Once you have that you can boot the new laptop with Ubuntu.\nTo boot from USB or the DVD without removing the internal disk in the new laptop, you'd have to reconfigure the boot order in the BIOS setup of the broken laptop.\nOnce you have Ubuntu running, you start the data recovery.\n\n\n*\n\n*Firstly, you may be able to mount the broken hard drive to copy things from it.  Sometimes a hard drive won't boot but it can still otherwise be mounted from another OS.\n\n*Otherwise if the drive is more heavily corrupted you may need to use testdisk - available in Ubuntu - to do recovery.

I am using Ubuntu 12.04 and Bitcoin client v0.8.6.0-g03a7d67-beta and Qt version 4.8.1 as the GUI.\nMy CPU is heating up and is automaticly shutting down after 30 minutes and sometimes after many hours. This is occurring both while synchronising with the block-chain or while reindexing the blocks on disk.\nAfter the CPU overheating my laptop (Dell Inspiron R15) switches off and has corrupted my sync. Other users have mentioned to start by typing in terminal bitcoin-qt -reindex. At the the end of the index around week17 my CPU overheats again.\nReading around I found topics about switching off the \"generate bitcoin\" option inside the bitcoin.conf file but on my Ubuntu (including hidden files) I can not find that file.\nAny tips or help on this overheating issue? I have also posted this on bitcoin Stackexchange.\n\nA: Adrian's answer is valid and is looking at it from a potential root cause. But my preferred answer was a work around that got answered in the bitcoin stackexchange\nDirect Quote:\nUsing bitcoin-qt you can go into Helps->Debug Window->Console and then type\nsetgenerate false\n\nBy default it should already be false so my guess is that you have a fast internet connection and that your computer receive a lot of blocks in a short time. Your computer then need to check all the ECDSA signatures for the transaction and this can consume a lot of CPU.\nI had an overheating issue like that when I was mining litecoins with my laptop. I installed the cpufreq package to decrease my cpu frequency about 30% and everything was fine then.\nIf you have a dual-core processor you should type something like this in your terminal.\nsudo cpufreq-set -c 0 -u \"1.8GHz\"\nsudo cpufreq-set -c 1 -u \"1.8GHz\"\n\nI then decide to browser around for CPU Freq scaling and decided to use the following indicator-cpufreq indicator\nComputer did not overheat and got the job done without suffering to much performance loss.\n\nA: Because your issue is CPU related, your computer is likely to shutdown anytime you have excessive processor usage (not just bitcoin).\nThere is a script called temp_throttle that you can use to limit your CPU speed when it reaches a specific temperature. This will keep your computer from getting too hot and powering off. You can find temp_throttle here.\n*Disclaimer- I am the author and maintainer of temp_throttle.*\n\nA: I use cpulimit utility. Typical usage:\ncpulimit -l 220 -e bitcoin-qt\n\nIt means: do not let 'bitcoin-qt' process use more than 220% CPU (C. O. comment: more than 100% because quad-core processor)\nMind 'apt-get install cpulimit'  may install version without multi-core support.\nThat does not look elegant. I wonder how can system itself throttle heavy processes when CPU is overheating.\n\nA: Bitcoin is necessarily expensive in terms of processing power. Even if you don't choose to mine coins, your machine will first verify the block chain, which can consume a lot of CPU time.\nYour shutdowns would seem to indicate that your hardware could probably use a service - shutdowns due to overheating should not occur even under prolonged full CPU load. Try cleaning your vents and CPU heatsink and making sure your fans are free of dust and obstructions.\nMining using traditional CPUs is a virtually futile exercise at the time of writing. The only cost-efficient way of mining Bitcoin presently is using custom ASIC based miners designed specifically for the task. If you want to participate in mining, I would advise that you invest in this hardware, or buy the hardware from one of the companies that will host it for you in their datacentre.\n\nA: Overheating is a problem with your hardware setup, not bitcoin. I have all too much experience with overheating while playing high resource intensive games. I've burned up 8 GB of RAM from overheating. Overheating is a much more serious danger to your equipment than just to your CPU. It can kill other components of your PC too, including your hard drives. Some people recommended some good software fixes to throttle your CPU, but you really need to invest in some cooling components to fix this problem or you could risk more than just frying your CPU. For laptops, they sell equipment like cooling pads like this one: https://www.bestbuy.com/site/enhance-laptop-cooling-stand-blue/5845304.p\nDo some homework and find out which types of cooling systems would work best for your laptop. Cooling laptops is not an area I've explored. My link is just an example. You should look up your exact CPU and on the data sheet there is a range of acceptable operating temperatures (in fact you can do this with all your components and should to make sure they're operating at safe heat levels). You should always stay below the max temperatures on the data sheets. I use Open Hardware Monitor http://openhardwaremonitor.org/ to keep an eye on all my equipment. It will run in the background and tell you the max temperatures your equipment reaches, which is a very useful tool to help with tweaking how much cooling equipment you need. \nPersonally, I use a desktop PC with a Corsair obsidian case http://www.corsair.com/en-us/obsidian-series-450d-mid-tower-pc-case . It's easy to clean because of the magnetic pads and it has a top vent that I use a https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835181103 Corsair Hydro H100i closed liquid cooling system to water cool my CPU. My CPU temp barley ever exceeds 55 C. It has maxed at 65-70C before in the summer when intense gaming and intense heat are in my room. This is still well below my CPU threshold of 80C. I've overclocked my graphics card (which increases heat) and I have never had any issues due to heating since while using corsair equipment. There are videos on youtube that have shown quantifiable research that certain water cooling models work best for reducing temperature over others, which is why I use the H100i. \nLook at buying cooling as sort of buying a warranty for your computer. The cooler your components are running on a daily basis, the longer the lifetime of your computer since there is less chance of a hardware failure. Learn from my mistakes please. I have fried over 4 video cards, some RAM, an AMD CPU, and multiple hard drives from custom building my PCs in over a decade that I've been doing it all because I decided to skimp out on cooling. Cooling is a very important part of electronics that is often overlooked and I have had many friends whose computers have died simply because of inadequate cooling (especially in alienware type laptops for gaming). Stock cooling systems on almost any system, especially laptops, typically just suck. Good luck and godspeed.  \n", "Q: Dual Boot: Windows 8 is fine, Ubuntu is fine, but will only boot when dvd is in the disk drive I have a new computer with Windows 8.1 and have gone to work at dual-booting with Ubuntu 12.04.3. I can boot Windows 8 from the grub menu just fine, and Ubuntu appears on the menu and I can select it, but it will remain on a blank screen, same color as the grub menu, and does nothing, no error message. However, if I put my Ubuntu DVD in the disk drive before starting up, I can select Ubuntu from the grub menu and it always starts up perfectly.\nOne thing I noticed is that if the disk is NOT in the drive, I see a little message \"efi disk read error\" appear several times just before the grub menu is displayed. The message does not appear if the disk has been inserted. Could someone let me know what's going on?\nAdditional details:\nJust following my Ubuntu install, the initial problem had been that Windows was not recognized and didn't show up in grub. I ran boot-repair (results) from my Ubuntu installation (BIOS would not boot from the optical drive after installing Ubuntu). Following this, it appeared that everything was fine - I could boot Windows and Ubuntu, and I couldn't tell you whether it was because a disk was in or not. I didn't take note of this at the time.\nAfter this I did some various installing of software on Windows, and also got the grub menu customizer on Ubuntu to shift around my menu options, and shove some ones I don't plan to use much into folders. But that's all. And this morning I noticed that I could not boot Ubuntu unless the disk was in the drive.\n\nA: Concerning the \"efi disk read error\" message, I think you need to disable the Windows \"Fast Startup\" feature, as described here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can a Windows 8 partition be mounted in Ubuntu if \"fast startup\"is switched on?\n\n*How to Turn \"Fast Startup\" On or Off for a Hybrid Boot in Windows 8 and 8.1 (Windows 8 Forums)\nDoing so will not fix your more important \"black screen\" problem, but this problem is at least as serious in the long term, since failing to address it can result in filesystem corruption and, in extreme cases, an inability to boot the computer at all.\nThe \"black screen\" problem is a known one, but there are numerous different causes and solutions. The most general solution seems to be to use the nomodeset kernel option, but there are several others, many of which are unique to particular chipsets. Searching this site reveals several questions on this topic, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Black screen after GRUB, can't install. UEFI\n\n*Asus G75VX / Xubuntu 13.10 EFI installation Blank Screen\n\n*Why my live installation results blank screen?\n\n*My computer boots to a black screen, what options do I have to fix it?\nI can't promise that any of these (or numerous others here or elsewhere) will help you, but I recommend you start with these answers.\n\nA: Also:\nIt looks like boot repair ran its \"buggy\" UEFI rename function. I am not sure it is always required, but it is for those UEFI that internally hard code UEFI to only boot the Windows efi file. So Boot-Repair renames the Windows file and makes grub2's shim be the Windows file. The UEFI thinks it is booting Windows but is really booting grub2/shim and then from grub2 menu you can boot Windows.\nbuggy-kernel detected. Do you want to activate [Backup and rename Windows EFI files]? yes (if any choice fails, please retry with the other)\nThen renamed /EFI/microsoft/boot/shimx64.efi to bootmgfw.efi\nActual Windows boot file, originally bootmgfw.efi, becomes this:\n/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bkpbootmgfw.efi\nWith the renamed file you cannot directly boot Windows from UEFI menu as it really is shim.\nAnd a Windows update may rewrite the bootmgfw.efi file overwriting the shim version, so then if you can only boot the Windows version you have to rerun boot repair. If you can boot Ubuntu entry in UEFI menu, undo the rename.\nTo undo & to rename files to their original names, you just need to tick the \"Restore EFI backups\" option of Boot-Repair.\nWindows UEFI install should  have backup of bootmgfw.efi here:\nC:\\Windows\\Boot\\EFI\\bootmgfw.efi from a working Windows x86_64 installation.\n", "Q: DJ: pioneer DDJ-T1 with traktor in ubuntu by wine I have a friend who wants to move to Ubuntu.

Some sort of disk file type, perhaps? Help!\n\nA: Simply copying the files to a drive will not work! You need to use an ISO image writing application (Windows 7 has one built in). You'll then have to enter your BIOS and make sure your external HDD is selected as a boot option.\nEDIT: This will only work if you're burning to a CD/DVD. If you want to burn to a flash drive, take a look at http://www.pendrivelinux.com/. You'll probably have to do this first, then install onto your external HDD during installation.

I know with windows, it likes to go nuts when you're idling, and I was just wondering if there was any sort of similar maintenance tasks that I should be concerned about with Ubuntu.\nI know you don't have to worry about fragmentation with Linux (due to ext2/3), and I was just wondering if there was anything other common maintenance tasks that would be pointless for Ubuntu or Linux in general.\n\nA: Ubuntu, like other Linux systems, has a group of scheduled maintenance tasks that run automatically that maintain the system logs, temporary files, and other tasks. Most of these tasks are scheduled as cron jobs that run during anticipated period of low use (like during the overnight hours) but will also run if they have not been performed after a certain time period has elapsed.\nFile system checks are run on startup if a hard system shutdown was detected.

I tried update-grub, I also tried os_prober and then update-grub. I also tried boot-repair, but none of these seemed to work. Here is my bootinfoscript output:\nhttp://pastebin.com/QD8Bx0jQ\n\nA: I noticed that the script lines from the os_prober are not inserted in the grub script file at all.

I only have access to the server via a terminal and I can't use graphical tools such as GParted!\nI want to create a new partition from a part of the root (about 768mb) for swap.\n# df -h\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/vda         20G  1.3G   18G   7% /\nudev             10M     0   10M   0% /dev\ntmpfs           199M  4.9M  194M   3% /run\ntmpfs           100M   12K  100M   1% /run/user\ntmpfs           5.0M  4.0K  5.0M   1% /run/lock\n\n\nA: The answer depends on whether you can unmount the partition to shrink, or not. In your case, you probably cannot unmount the partition. In Linux (UNIX/MAC OS), mounting a partition refers to using the file system and mapping it to the mount point (in your case /). Unmounting means that you stop using the filesystem, and remove the mapping to the mount point. You cannot unmount the filesystem containing your running OS.\nIf the partition can be unmounted\nLets assume you want to shrink a 200GB ext4 partition on /dev/sda4 mounted to /data. It currently contains music and movies or similar, so you can temporarily unmount it. You want to create a 4GB swap. \nsudo umount /dev/sda4\n\nto unmount the partition.\nsudo resize2fs /dev/sda4 196G\n\nto resize the ext4 filesystem to 196 GB, assuming that there is enough space. Now, you have to shrink the partition. I currently belive you need to use cfdisk to delete the existing partition, and recreate a smaller partition in its place. You can then also create a new partition for the swap. \nsudo cfdisk /dev/sda \n\nwill give you a text-based gui to inspect your partition table. I would recommend you to print the partition table to a file or screen at that point, and take note of the current configuration as backup. You can then select /dev/sda4 and delete the partition. In its place, free space will be displayed. Use new to create a new partition with 196 GB in its place, and set the type to ext4. Then, move to the trailing free space and create the 4GB swap partition with type swap. Note: I did not test these commands, as I can't play around with my / at the moment.\nIf the partition cannot be unmounted\nYou cannot shrink a mounted ext3/4 partition (see manpage of resize2fs). As you are running your OS from /, you cannot unmount /. That means you have to boot another OS (e.g. from USB key) to do the changes.\nIn your case, it is a remote server (on KVM most likely), so you might not be able to boot from USB/ a live OS image. There might be other ways to change the partitioning from your vServer provider through an admin GUI. I believe that is your best bet currently.\n\nA: You cannot shrink/edit a partition if any of the partition on the storage device is mounted.  So in order to unmount and edit the root filesystem, the OS need to be shutdown. Then boot into a live system and edit the partition as described in other answers.  \nAlternative solution  : swap file\nAs an alternative to creating an entire partition, a swap file offers the ability to vary its size on-the-fly, and is more easily removed altogether. Swap file can be hot plugable. i.e can be added and removed without unmounting/turning off the OS.     \n\n\n*\n\n*Create a 512 MB file called /swapfile. This will be our swap file.  \nfallocate -l 512M /swapfile  \n\nOR  \ndd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1M count=512\n\n\n*Set the right permissions (because a world-readable swap file is a huge local vulnerability): \nchmod 600 /swapfile\n\n\n*After creating the correctly sized file, format it to swap:   \nmkswap /swapfile\n\n\n*Activate the swap file:  \nswapon /swapfile\n\n\n*Edit /etc/fstab and add an entry for the swap file:  \n/swapfile none swap defaults 0 0\n\nMore details at arch linux wiki.\n\nA: First of all is important to know that you cannot resize to shrink your root partition if you are using it (This is called online shrinking). You can only grow it online. This is supported by the resize2fs command. I will assume the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*You don't want to loose your information on the root partition.\n\n*You don't have physical access to the hard drive in order to use a LiveCD. This can apply to a virtual environment or a remote one. In the case of a virtual one you can still manage to boot from a LiveCD if you set the VM to boot from a LiveCD. This is assumming the VM supports outputting the Desktop GUI from where you would run the Gparted app to resize easily. But since this is less likely I assume you can not.\n\n\nThere are 2 type of partitions that you can resize, the LVM partitions or Logical Volume Manager partitions which support Online resizing (Shrinking/Growing) since the creation of the galaxy and the standard partitions most of us use. Right now the only one that has almost 100% support of complete online resizing (Shrink/Grow) is the btrfs filesystem (Which is still in development). I will explain how to do the normal partitions most of us use in the ext4 filesystem.\nResizing (Growing) the Partition\nTo grow your partition you can do it with the root mounted. To do this simply do:\nsudo resize2fs /dev/sda1\n\nProvided you already have the empty space ready to be merged. Afterwards I recommend rebooting for the changes to take effect correctly. The command above would resize to the maximum permitted. If you wish to resize to a particular size then simply add the size at the end:\nsudo resize2fs /dev/sda1 25G\n\nNote that if you want to specify 25.4 GB, you can not use the \".\". you would need to go down one unit of measure. In this case from GB to MB, so it would look like this:\nsudo resize2fs /dev/sda1 25400M\n\nThis way you will have a partition of 25.4G\nResizing (Shrinking) the Partition\nShrinking the partition is a two step process which involves:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reducing the size of the file system by the amount needed.\n\n*Reducing the size of the underlying block device to match that of the file system.\n\n\nBefore reducing the capacity of a file system you need to reduce the size of the block device (Which can be a partition or a logical volume). Since this is not available for any of the ext* file systems you won't be able to shrink it from 20 GB to 19.5 GB to create the 500 MB swap one.\nEven Ext4 does not support online shrinking. If you try to do it you will get the following:\n\nYour only bet as far as I know is to either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install another Ubuntu version on the same server (On another partition) that can then be used to shrink the root partition of the original Ubuntu Server.\n\n*Install Ubuntu server from scratch with the size you actually want\n\n*Use the Ubuntu Server Live Image to resize the partition. For this case, you will need to get to this screen:\n\nAnd choose the Resize option as shown in the image above. From there you will select what the new size will be since from here you can unmount the unit and shrink it if you want.\nAs an additional help here is the gparted filesystem suppor http://gparted.org/features.php which gives a very detailed list of supported ones and includes if they have full online resizing. Btrfs is amongst them.\n", "Q: Automate Ubuntu 12.04 vm in kvm I am trying to automate using virt-install + preseed, ubuntu12.04 vm's with kvm.\nI need the vm's to be hosted on specific lvm volumes I had created for each one.\nWhen I run the script I get: ERROR    A size must be specified for non-existent disks.\nThis is my install.sh file.\nMy \n#!/bin/bash\nsudo virt-install \\\n--name=test \\\n--connect=qemu:///system \\\n--ram=1024 \\\n--vcpus=2 \\\n--os-variant=ubuntuprecise \\\n--hvm \\\n--virt-type=kvm \\\n--network=bridge:br0 \\\n--location=http://mirrors.usc.edu/pub/linux/distributions/ubuntu/dists/precise    /main/installer-amd64/ \\\n--file=test.img \\\n--graphics vnc,port=5901,password=test,listen=0.0.0.0,keymap=ja \\\n--disk path=/dev/VG/testing,size=9.7 \\\n--extra-args=\"auto=true priority=critical initrd=/install/initrd.gz preseed/file=preseed.cfg\" \\\n\nThis is my preseed.cfg file(most likely there will be errors in this file, even though debconf says its ok, but I cant get this far):\nd-i debian-installer/locale string en\nd-i console-keymaps-at/keymap select en\n\nd-i netcfg/get_nameservers string 8.8.8.8\nd-i netcfg/get_ipaddress string 192.168.0.20\nd-i netcfg/get_netmask string 255.255.255.0\nd-i netcfg/get_gateway string 192.168.0.1\nd-i netcfg/choose_interface select eth0\nd-i netcfg/disable_dhcp boolean true\nd-i netcfg/dhcp_options select Configure network manually\nd-i netcfg/confirm_static boolean true\nd-i netcfg/get_hostname string test\nd-i netcfg/get_hostname seen false\nd-i netcfg/get_domain string ymotongpoo.local\n\nd-i mirror/protocol string http\nd-i mirror/country string manual\nd-i mirror/http/hostname string archive.ubuntu.com\nd-i mirror/http/directory string /ubuntu\nd-i mirror/http/proxy string\n\nd-i clock-setup/utc boolean true\nd-i time/zone string Europe/Athens\nd-i clock-setup/ntp boolean true\n\nd-i partman-auto/disk string /dev/vda\nd-i partman-lvm/devide_remove_lvm boolean true\nd-i partman-md/device_remove_md boolean true\n\nd-i partman-auto/method string regular\nd-i partman-lvm/confirm boolean true\n\nd-i partman-auto-lvm/guided_size string max\nd-i partman-auto/choose_recipe select atomic\n\nd-i partman/default_filesystem string ext4\n\nd-i partman/confirm_write_new_label boolean true\nd-i partman/choose_partition select finish\nd-i partman/confirm boolean true\nd-i partman/confirm_nooverwrite boolean true\n\nd-i passwd/root-login boolean false\nd-i passwd/user-fullname string bob\nd-i passwd/username string bob\nd-i passwd/user-password-crypted password $1$R00dFhRl$7zb6nzVUMbrBT5pchDkJl.\nd-i user-setup/allow-password-weak boolean true\n\ntasksel tasksel/first multiselect standard\nd-i pkgsel/include string openssh-server\nd-i pkgsel/upgrade select safe-upgrade\nd-i pkgsel/language-packs multiselect en, ja\nd-i pkgsel/update-policy select none\nd-i pkgsel/updatedb boolean false\n\npopularity-contest popularity-contest/participate boolean false\n\nd-i grub-installer/only_debian boolean true\nd-i grub-installer/with_other_os boolean true\nd-i finish-install/reboot_in_progress note\n\n\nA: The error message ist clear: \"ERROR A size must be specified for non-existent disks\" Looks like the file specified by \"--file=test.img\" dosn't exist.

How can I see this splash screen again ?\nThanks for your answer.\n\nA: Boot to Linux and run the mkrlconf.sh script that comes with rEFInd. (If you installed rEFInd from the Debian package, it will be on your path. If you installed rEFInd in OS X, you'll need to extract it from the .zip file that you presumably used under OS X.) This will create a file called /boot/refind_linux.conf, which will hold additional kernel options, probably including the ones needed to create the splash screen.

I will report to the Ubuntu Studio folks.  \n", "Q: Are there some packages I need to install to run apps compiled with mono C#? I use MonoDevelop for writing and compiling C# code. I am wondering if there are some prerequisite packages to run built applications?\nAlso, output is always *.exe. Does it need to be like that and can I remove .exe?\n\nA: Mono programs require the Mono runtime, which is provided by the mono-runtime package. Like other programs, they may also use shared libraries provided by other packages.\nMonoDevelop is itself a program written in C# that uses Mono. Any Ubuntu system with the monodevelop package installed will also have mono-runtime and some other support packages installed. This happens automatically when you install monodevelop using Ubuntu's package manager, because it declares the other packages it needs as dependencies.\nSo you likely don't need to install anything else just to run programs that use Mono. If you're developing Mono applications, though, then I suggest installing the mono-complete package, which will give you most of the development tools you're likely to want to use.\nIf you want to install less than what mono-complete gives you, then you can just install mono-devel. If you want to install less than that, and just get the C# compiler and the libraries it requires, then you can install mono-mcs. The C# compiler is called mcs; if you want to run it directly from the command line, you would use the mcs command.\nIt sounds, from your question, that you already have these things installed.\n\nAs for the .exe suffix that the C# compiler automatically appends to the binaries it produces: yes, you can remove that and they will still run just fine. You might not always want to, though. Having .exe at the end isn't necessary, but it doesn't do any harm. It makes your programs more readily portable to other systems, which you may or may not care about, depending on what you are doing.\nIn particular, if you copy those executables to a Windows system, they will probably still run, but if you've removed the .exe suffix, then Windows won't know what to do with them. This is because Windows uses file extensions to determine if a file is considered a program. (Of course, you could rename them back.)\n", "Q: My server is making me download the code instead of running it I am running an ubuntu server 12.04 but unfortunately I am not being able to make the interpreter run the code exactly.

How do I connect to a x3270 IBM Mainframe using the GNOME Terminal? I am not sure how to do this. Is there any documentation on it?\n\nA: You need to use Telnet. Lucky for you there is a tool for this called  x3270 - IBM host access tool. \n x3270  opens  a  telnet  connection  to an IBM host in an X window.  It\n       implements RFCs  2355  (TN3270E),  1576  (TN3270)  and  1646  (LU  name\n       selection), and supports IND$FILE file transfer.  The window created by\n       x3270 can use its own font for displaying characters, so it is a fairly\n       accurate  representation  of  an  IBM  3278  or 3279.  It is similar to\n       tn3270(1) except that it is X-based, not curses-based.\n\n       The full syntax for host is:\n              [prefix:]...[LUname@]hostname[:port]\n\nInstallation (x3270 \n)\nsudo apt-get install x3270\n\nAccording to the information in Ubuntu Software Center you will need to install the x3270 fonts manually since they are required (xfonts-x3270-misc \n):\nsudo apt-get install xfonts-x3270-misc\n\n\nA: Another tool that you can use is c3270.\nc3270 opens a telnet connection to an IBM mainframe host in an Xterm window or Virtual Console. It can also connect to an IBM AS/400 as a 5250 terminal using the AS/400's 3270 emulation.\nc3270 is similar to tn3270(1), and x3270(1) except that it is curses-based, not X-based.\nc3270 implements RFCs 2355 (TN3270E), 1576 (TN3270), and 1646 (LU name selection), and supports IND$FILE file transfer.UA\nTo install click c3270 \nOr, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal.

But if Vista is broken Ubuntu/Grub will not fix it. Grub will error out after selecting Vista forcing you to reboot. \n\nwould it repair vista enough to use or rather not overwrite any info\n\nUbuntu will never fix a Windows operating system. And the installer will overwrite Vista if -you- tell it to do so. \nIf you have hardware related problems installing Ubuntu will not fix those, if you have problems with a Microsoft version you need Windows tools to fix that problem.\nYou need to treat Ubuntu as a separate operating system that has nothing to do with Windows. Besides that Ubuntu will let you see the windows partitions and copy files over from it. But on a system level you need the operating system itself.\n\nA: \nwould it repair vista enough to use or rather not overwrite any info\n\nIf the problem is very simple (such as you somehow removed the boot flag from the vista a drive) then maybe. But probably not. If vista itself is broken this will not fix it.\nThe best option for you here is to plug back in the SATA drive (see my comment on your question). Boot to USB. You should be able to mount your vista partition (open the file browser and click on the Vista drive). You should be able to get to your files. If you can get to the files you can back them up to another a different HDD or to an external drive.\nNow you have your files. You are safe to start \"abusing\" the vista partition to try to get it running. Or to shrink the partition and put ubuntu dual boot on. But probably the best option if you have your files backed up is a clean install. Either clean Ubuntu (good idea) or clean Vista (probably a bad idea, it was always an unstable operating system which is no longer in mainstream support, if you really want to use Windows it may be worth switching up to Windows 7).\nFinal piece of advice. What ever operating system you choose. Do not have your files on the same partition as your system. This way how ever much your system screws up you can always do a clean install without loosing any files. \n", "Q: Can't see files (created by windows) on NTFS Partition I have a NTFS Disk that is used to share all my media files between Windows 7 and Ubuntu. Unfortunately after I saved some new videos there using Windows I can't see them in Ubuntu. It just wont \"refresh\" and show the new .avi files. They work pretty well in Windows.\nUbuntu Linux was hibernated and the NTFS volume mounted.\nWhy is this happening?\n\nA: The file system was still mounted in OS1 (Linux) while you modified it through OS2 (Windows). Since OS1 was hibernated at that time, it doesn't know about these changes. It will only know about them after umounting and re-mounting the file system.\nIn the future you should avoid such situations by unmounting the “shared” volume before suspension, because OS1 may unknowingly overwrite intermittent changes performed by OS2 and thus corrupt data or even the file system irreversibly.\nYou must only ever modify a mounted file system through the directory tree below its mountpoint(s)¹.\n(¹ Some tools work on mounted file systems directly and will state so explicitly in their documentation.)\n", "Q: Unetbootin does not show Ubuntu 12.04 Unetbootin does not show Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

But is it just me or did Wine not come with the installation as cited here\nI've used the previous version on the same machine with it included, up & running great. I understand it's in the software center & I can just download it from there. But, where is it on my newly installed OS? No searches of my system have found it?\n\nA: Wine stores the stuff you do on in it in .wine, a hidden file in your home directory. Inside it is drive_c, which is a sort of virtual version of the Windows C drive, and where Wine installs the exe files.\nYou can check whether it is installed by running wine --version in terminal, and if it is not installed, you should be able to install Wine from here  .\nIf you cannot open exe's with it, you may need to edit wine.desktop in /usr/share/applications, and replace the NoDisplay=true line with NoDisplay=false.\n\nA: after you installed wine via the software center you can install windows installers by right clicking the installer and choose open with --> 'wine windows program loader'. however you first need to allow the file to executing. to do this you right click, select properties and go to the permissions tab. here check the 'Allow executing file as program' box. you can configer some settings of wine with the program 'Configure Wine'.\nyou can also take a look at the program 'Play on Linux' it helps you to manage installed programs. it creates a new instance of wine which allow you to have specific configurations per program and it has pre configured installs for a lot of programs (mostly games)\nI am not sure what programs you want to run under wine but in general I would advise first to search for native alternatives on Linux since not all programs will run good under wine.\n", "Q: Is there any non-linear presentation software for linux like Prezi Desktop I like non-linear presentation software like prezi.  The problem with Prezi is it is not open source and not a desktop client (For linux).  You will say use Libra-Office Impress but it is linear and I hate that.  If there isn't any non-linear presentation software for linux like Prezi Desktop, than is there a plugin that make Libra-Office Impress like it or Apache OpenOffice?  I want a desktop client, and not a web-base app!\n[1] Linear Presentations are those presentations in which the flow of the presentation is controlled by the person who is presenting. The concept is frequently employed in multimedia applications and presentations. An example of linear presentation is a pre-recorded movie presentation.\nSources\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.ask.com/question/what-is-the-definition-of-linear-presentations\n\nA: Have a look at Sozi.\nTo use Sozi, you first create an SVG file containing everything you want to present in a graphics program of your choice, for example Inkscape. After you've created the presentation image, you open it with Sozi and define your animations.\nSozi will export the presentation in a standalone HTML file, viewable in most modern browsers.\n\nA: Dizzy is a browser based java script non-linear presentation software. Open source and based on SVGs. Never used it though.\nAs a warning which you probably don't want. From conferences always the worst presentations are the non-linear ones. The audience tends to end up disorientated, or more interested in the animation than the content. So if you are going to use a non-linear style try to stay away from trying to wow the audience with animation, and wow them with great content.\nGoing the opposite direction from prezi LaTeX beamer is great once you get used to it. Open-source, and makes you concentrate on good content rather than animation!\n", "Q: Install Java 6 besides Java 7 on ubuntu 13.10 Java 6 could be installed besides Java 7 on ubuntu 13.10?\n\nA: Lets ask aptitude:\naptitude why-not openjdk-7-jdk openjdk-6-jdk\nUnable to find a reason to remove openjdk-6-jdk.\n\n(the first line reads: aptitude why not install openjdk-6-jdk if I have openjdk-7-jdk installed)\nSo, the short answer is: yes.\nLong answer: if you use apt-get to do it you can.

Most of them seem to be full out media managers.\nI keep my media on an external drive and don't want the .nfo generating program to worry about keeping track of anything because I don't actually use this machine for viewing any of the media.\nMy ideal program would:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Allow me to choose a file/folder containing specific types of media files (music, tv shows, movies)\n  \n*Match the files online with a scraper using the standard sources (tvdb, etc.)\n  \n*Rename files using the scraped data\n  \n*Generate .nfo files using the scraped data\n  \n\nFileBot has been an excellent tool for doing steps 1-3, what would be really nice is if there was a plugin for it to generate the .nfo files. (I haven't been able to find one yet)\nAnywho.\nMy question is. Does anyone know of a good piece of existing software for doing this?\n\nA: I lost track of this account, I just logged in and saw that this question has received a fair number of views.\nI've since been using TinyMediaManager for handling TV Shows and Movies.\nHints for TMM:\n\n\n*\n\n*TV episodes can get messy if the filenames aren't standardized. It can be set to handle a number of different season/episode formats. Season 1 Episode 3 could be S01E03, x103, or whatever else you can think of. After having TMM mistake resolutions like \"1920x1080\" in the filename for Season 1 Episode 8. I decided to stick with the S01E03 format and only scrape that format. In case you have a collection of episodes that aren't already in this format, I use pyRenamer to rename the files into that format (which takes some getting used to, an understanding of regular expressions is helpful).\n\n*DVD order vs aired order, some shows will order their episodes differently on DVD vs how they were originally aired. TMM has an option to use one or the other, but you will need to know which order the episodes are in prior to scraping/renaming. Episodes can end up with the wrong names/metadata but the episode order will remain the same. If you scrape the episodes the wrong way, you can just change this setting and rescrape.\n\n\nMusicBrainz Picard for music. This program can be somewhat painful and it took a significant amount of time for me to update the metadata on my music library.\nHints for MBP:\n\n\n*\n\n*Most albums by lesser known bands, and even some by major artists, won't show up in the MusicBrainz database, if you are willing to put in the effort you can add them to the database yourself.\n\n*Some albums will match with albums with a similar name by a different artist. Some of these incorrect matches boggle the mind by how far off they are. When you're looking up albums I suggest batching one artist at a time so that when these false matches occur it will be obvious by the artist name.\n\n*I  often have trouble getting/maintaining a good connection to the db from the Picard app (not sure if they expect me to have a better connection than I do, or if their servers are a little overwhelmed). Often it will tell me that an album wasn't found but really it just gave up looking for it. Looking up the album multiple times often solves the problem. If it still doesn't find it, you can look up the album in a browser and add it to Picard from there. If you can't find it via the MB website, it probably hasn't been added yet (sometimes it's just hard to find).\n\n*There are often many versions of each album (different releases in different countries, remasters, etc), you'll need to figure out which one you have (often your album will be identical to several versions).\n\n*Album information (including alternate versions) often fails to download with or without any error message so you may end up refreshing the album info in Picard, or using the browser again to find the right version.\n\n*When you open your browser from one of the Picard context menus (right click -> open release in browser) you will be able to search the database for your album, once you find it there will be a \"tagger\" button that will allow you to import the album information to Picard directly. If you just open a browser and navigate to the website, the \"tagger\" button won't be there.\n\n\nThe initial process of updating my music library was very painful, I did it occasionally over several months, a few dozen or so albums at a time. After getting through that, updating meta on new music as I add it is fairly quick and easy.\n\nNeither of these programs are perfect but after some getting used to, they get the job done.\nNote: both of these programs would normally be used to keep track of your entire library. I use them just for getting meta/renaming before I move the file into my library. I keep a directory for media that is to be updated and one for files that have just been updated (with sub-folders for TV/Movies/Music). I load media into the programs from the to be updated and use their renamers to have the files transferred into the updated directory. After which I will check to make sure nothing went wrong (only happens if I've made a mistake) in the renaming and use an rsync script to move the files into their final destinations.\n\nA: XBMC can do 1, 2, and 4.  Just add the files to an XBMC library and then export the library to \"separate files\".  see more here. This will create .nfo files based on the data that XBMC scraped.  \nFrom there you could write a script that renames the media files (and .nfo files) based on the information contained in the .nfo files.\n", "Q: efi disk read error and secure boot error before GRUB splashscreen I have finally got Ubuntu and Windows 8 booting correctly under EFI on Dell i660. However I am seeing error message right before the GRUB splash screen -\nerror: efi disk read error.

If I disable the Secure Boot in BIOS I get rid of the loading module error, but am still getting the efi disk read errors. Are there are logs that I can look at ? Nothing surprising in /var/log/*.log.\nThanks!\n\nA: Concerning the \"disk read error,\" I recommend you disable the Windows Fast Startup feature, as described here or here. That feature is better called \"Fast Corruption\" in a dual-boot environment, since it can result in disk corruption. That may be what's causing the problem, but I can't guarantee that. It's also conceivable that you've got a defective disk, so running a SMART test on the disk may be worthwhile. If it shows bad sectors, replace the disk immediately!\nAs to the module error, I wouldn't worry about it, so long as GRUB works correctly; or you can disable Secure Boot. (Disabling Secure Boot will increase your risk of becoming infected by pre-boot malware, though.)\n", "Q: How to decrypt information from package versions? What these numbers mean? Take look at concrete example from aptitude:\nchromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra could be upgraded to version                     \n31.0.1650.63-0ubuntu0.13.10.1~20131204.1, but it is being held at version     \n30.0.1599.114-0ubuntu0.13.10.2.              \n\nWhy so many numbers? How can I tell whether I should upgrade or not? The last thing I want is to prevent upgrades in future because newer software might require older packages. I don't recall holding this package and others as well.\n\nA: Technically:\n31.0.1650.63-0ubuntu0.13.10.1~20131204.1\n|----------| | |----|\n  Upstream   |    |\n  version    |    |\n          Debian  |\n          version |\n               Ubuntu\n               Versioning\n\nThat cover the basic, but what about the next numbers?\n\n\n*\n\n*The 13.10 is the version of Ubuntu, since the packages of different versions of Ubuntu are compiled quite differently and will collide if they have the same name in the mirror. These packages are exclusive to that version of Ubuntu.\n\n*.1 means that is the first version for that package.\n\n*~20131204 Is the date the package was built.\n\n*The second .1 is in case the package is built twice the same day.\n\n\nNow, why in the world has a complicated version number? Because Chrome/ium is compiled separately but must have the same versions on all releases of Ubuntu, and to differentiate them all the package managers use these kinds of overly complex versions number.\n\nI don't recall holding this package and others as well.\n\nIn this case is \"held\" has another meaning. It's being held because apt will break dependencies if it gets upgraded. This cases are normally solved upgrading both packages or using an advance resolver like aptitude.\n", "Q: Password reset will not let me type I tried doing the password reset but when I went to enter in the new password it would not let me type.

However, if you have a \"default\" nano, you should see a small help menu at the bottom of the screen like this:  \n\nIf you don't see such a menu, it is possible that you need to go into /etc/nanorc and look for something like this:\n## Don't display the helpful shortcut lists at the bottom of the screen.\n# set nohelp\n\nUncommenting the second line causes the menu to be hidden. You may prefer to copy /etc/nanorc to your home folder as .nanorc and edit that copy for user-specific modifications.\nYou can also access nano's built-in help (and shortcuts) by pressing Ctrl+G at any time.\n\nA: You can use Ctrl+K to delete a line. \nBut strictly speaking Ctrl+k does not delete lines permanently. The most recent set of deletions are stored in a buffer. These lines may be re-inserted at the current cursor location using Ctrl+U. You can use this to cut and paste.\nHere you can find some useful shortcuts of nano\n", "Q: can not paste or make new folder on file system directly with out gksudo nautilus? I have installed ubuntu 12.04, But I can not paste or make new folder in File system, however I can paste new files with gksudo nautilus, but how can i do directly without gksudo nautilus??\n\nA: You need superuser(sudo) privileges for creating(this implies pasting) files in locations other than your own home folder(/home/$USER/). gksudo is just the graphical sudo, so you need to open graphical applications with gksudo.\nSo, if you want to create files/folders in directories such /home/(not /home/$USER), or / or any other directory than /home/$USER/, you will need to use gksudo nautilus.\n", "Q: Scrolling with a touch screen On a touchscreen, dragging your finger around behaves like you are using a mouse.  Is there any way to make dragging on a touch screen scroll rather than select the text?\nI'm running ubuntu desktop 13.10 with kernel 3.11.6-amd64 \n\nA: It looks like Ubuntu Unity currently only supports 3/4 finger touch gestures https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Multitouch... However, it is suggested you can use Ginn https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Multitouch/Ginn to define custom gestures. I have not tested it (yet) but bou might be able to make it work for you.\n", "Q: Help locating linux/version.h I'm trying to fix an old program, Previous issues I had could be found at\nMissing modversions.h\nWhen I make the program it gives me the following error,\nkaodv-mod.c:22:27: fatal error: linux/version.h: No such file or directory\ncompilation terminated.\n\nSo I ran \nfind / -name version.h\n\nwhich returns\n/opt/VBoxGuestAdditions-4.3.2/src/vboxguest-4.3.2/vboxguest/include/VBox/version.h\n/usr/include/linux/dvb/version.h\n/usr/include/linux/version.h\n/usr/src/linux-headers-3.8.0-29-generic/include/config/arch/want/ipc/parse/version.h\n/usr/src/linux-headers-3.8.0-29-generic/include/generated/uapi/linux/version.h\n/usr/src/linux-headers-3.8.0-29/include/uapi/linux/dvb/version.h\n/usr/src/linux-headers-3.8.0-29/include/xen/interface/version.h\n\nThis clearly proved that linux/version.h is present\nIn order to fix this, should I change \n#include<linux/version.h>\n\ninto \n\n#include</usr/include/linux/version.h>\n\nOr is it possible to make changes to the Makefile\nP.S: Makefile\n\nA: First you need to install kernel-headers\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)\n\nIf it doesn't work then try this also\nsudo ln -s /usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r)/include/generated/uapi/linux/version.h /usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r)/include/linux/version.h\n\nEdited for types.h:\nsudo ln -s /usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r)/include/uapi/asm-generic/types.h /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build/include/uapi/linux/types.h\n\n\nA: With apt-file you can find any file Ubuntu provides:\n$ apt-file search linux/version.h\ngcc-arm-linux-androideabi: /usr/arm-linux-androideabi/include/linux/version.h\nlinux-headers-3.11.0-11-lowlatency: /usr/src/linux-headers-3.11.0-11-lowlatency/include/generated/uapi/linux/version.h\nlinux-headers-3.11.0-12-generic: /usr/src/linux-headers-3.11.0-12-generic/include/generated/uapi/linux/version.h\nlinux-headers-3.4.0-1-goldfish: /usr/src/linux-headers-3.4.0-1-goldfish/include/linux/version.h\nlinux-libc-dev: /usr/include/linux/version.h\nlinux-libc-dev-arm64-cross: /usr/aarch64-linux-gnu/include/linux/version.h\nlinux-libc-dev-armel-cross: /usr/arm-linux-gnueabi/include/linux/version.h\nlinux-libc-dev-armhf-cross: /usr/arm-linux-gnueabihf/include/linux/version.h\nlinux-libc-dev-powerpc-cross: /usr/powerpc-linux-gnu/include/linux/version.h\nruby1.8-dev: /usr/lib/ruby/1.8/i686-linux/version.h\n\nFrom this list, linux-libc-dev looks like the most promising candidate.\n\nA: There is no include/generated/uapi/linux/version.h in source code tree starting from linux kernel 4.14;\nHere is a way how to generate it under Ubuntu\n\n\n*\n\n*Install linux headers\nsudo apt install linux-headers-`uname -r`\n\n\n*Go to linux headers directory\ncd /usr/src/linux-headers-`uname -r`\n\n\n*Generate version.h\nsudo make include/generated/uapi/linux/version.h\n\n\n*Create symbol link to generate file\nsudo ln -s $PWD/include/generated/uapi/linux/version.h include/version.h\n\n"]
