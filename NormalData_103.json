I was trying to shutdown my PC through SSH. I executed\nsudo shutdown now\nThe user was logged-out and Ubuntu starting turning off, but it froze at the last screen with the Ubuntu logo and the loading dots. Any idea where the problem might be?\nAlso, what's the difference between shutdown and halt? What other similar commands are there?\n\nA: What you need to do is power off the computer after it shuts down by running the command below:\n\nsudo shutdown -P 20\n\n\nA: From the MAN PAGES:\nShutdown - \"shutdown arranges for the system to be brought down in a safe way.  All\n       logged-in users are notified that the system is going down and,  within\n       the last five minutes of TIME, new logins are prevented.\" Time mentioned here is an amount specify by the user that is shutting down.\nHalt - \"These programs allow a system administrator to reboot, halt or poweroff\n       the system.\"\nThe difference is that Halt can be more \"aggressive\" when shutting down than Shutdown itself. It has parameters than can literally force the system to shutdown without regarding services or opened programs. If you run halt without any parameters it will simply execute the shutdown command. Something like an alias. If you run it for example with the parameter --force it will \"force\" the system into a reboot really fast.\nIn the case of halt or shutdown, they will wait for all processes to finish correctly before turning the PC off or rebooting. If a service or app does not close or does not close properly you will see what you mention there (The ubuntu logo with the dots).\nThe proper way in the terminal for a single user or multi user is shutdown. But if the shutdown is not working verify what services you have running and which one is causing the slowness or freezing of the shutdown.\nWith that in mind, there are several ways to reboot or shutdown the system:\nRebooting - shutdown -r, reboot\nIn this case, reboot is simply calling shutdown -r.\nShutting Down - halt, shutdown, sudo init 0, shutdown -h now, poweroff\nIn this case, poweroff is the same as calling shutdown -P\nAs you have noticed, The shutdown command can do a lot of stuff, here is a small list of it:\n-r  Requests that the system be rebooted after it has been brought down\n-h  Requests that the system be either halted or powered off after it has been brought down, with the choice as to which left up to the system\n-H  Requests that the system be halted after it has been brought down\n-P  Requests that the system be powered off after it has been brought down\n-c  Cancels a running shutdown. TIME is not specified with this option, the first argument is MESSAGE\n-k  Only send out the warning messages and disable logins, do not actually bring the system down\n\nAs does the reboot \n-f, --force                 force reboot or halt, don't call shutdown(8)\n-p, --poweroff              switch off the power when called as halt\n\nThere is however a difference between shutdown down through the terminal and clicking on the Shutdown option in Unity. The latter will ask the user for interaction with any unsaved work (like libreoffice, inkscape...). the former will simply send a signal to all processes telling them to close. No user interaction will be needed so any unsaved work will be gone.\n\nA: One another command for shutdown system is \nsudo init 0\ninit 0 calls all of the shutdown scripts and gracefully shuts down your machine. \n\nA: \nWhat is the proper terminal-way to shutdown?\n\nshutdown -h now\n\nor \npoweroff\n\n\nA: Create a script:\n#!/bin/bash \nshopt -s nocasematch\nread -t 30 -N 1 -p 'Shutdown now? (Y/n) '\n[[ \"$REPLY\" =~ n ]] || sudo poweroff\n\n\nA: Depending on hw, sw and configuration, the hang on could be do to anything.

I've installed two Chinese fonts from the repos: UMing and UKai. I like better how UKai looks, but the default font picked by Ubuntu (when selecting a non-Chinese font) is UMing. For example, my desktop font is Droid Sans, but the Chinese caracters are picked from UMing.\nHow can I choose UKai for the default Chinese font?\nP.S. If I just change the desktop font to UKai, I won't get the Droid Sans latin characters, so that's not a solution.\n\nA: Unfortunately, there isn't a GUI configuration editor for you to use to deal with this problem under Ubuntu.  The GUI font selectors under Gnome or Unity only allows you to select one font per option, while the Font Manager allows you to enable/disable fonts only.  \nBut, as is the typical case of a Linux system, you actually can configure this, only you'll need to dig up the configuration option from lots of documentations.\nNow, straight to the point: you'll need to edit/create the file ~/.fonts.conf. \n\n\n*\n\n*The file does not exist by default. However, if you've used things like Font Manager, then there might be a placeholder file at ~/.fonts.conf telling you to use ~/.config/font-manager/local.conf instead, in which case you should create the latter.  \n\n*You should first open ~/.fonts.conf to check. \n\n*To check if the file exists, a simple way would be to open the file manager, go to \"Home\", check \"View->Show Hidden Files\" and see if you can find .fonts.conf.\n\n\nOnce you've created the file, put the following code in it:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM \"fonts.dtd\">\n<fontconfig>\n    <alias>\n        <family>sans-serif</family>\n        <prefer>\n            <family>Droid Sans</family>\n            <family>UKai</family>\n        </prefer>\n    </alias>\n</fontconfig>\n\nWhat it does is create a font resolution fallback list.  When a program is requesting a sans-serif font (most GUI fonts are sans-serif by default), the system would try to use the first font (Droid Sans) for a character. If the font does not support that character, the second (UKai) will be used.  I'm not sure if specifying Droid Sans as the first preference has any significance, but you might as well keep it, just to be safe.\nNote also that you'll need to logout of your account and login again to see the effect. \nFor me, the effect is immediate after logging out and logging in again, and the font choice works system-wide.\nThe above answer is based on a related blog post: Fedora 中文字体设置\nEdit\nThere is also a more comprehensive configuration sample under /etc/fonts/conf.avail or /etc/fonts/conf.d (I don't remember exactly which) whose name contains zh-CN. Inside is a set of configuration used for adjusting the exact fallback font order, which is far more suitable than the above method. Just copy the content in the file into ~/.fonts.conf or ~/.config/font-manager/local.conf and change the ordering of fonts to suit your needs.\n\nA: Since Ubuntu has changed a lot (with latest version of 18.0.4 lts).

In that case, consider the use of Firefox profiles.\nStart the Profile Manager (add the -no-remote option if you've already a Firefox instance running):\nfirefox -ProfileManager\n\nFrom there, you can add and remove Firefox profiles and set the default one. You can run multiple Firefox instances next to each other by adding the -no-remote option like this:\nfirefox -no-remote -P default\n\nHere, default is the profile name which corespondents to the ~/.mozilla/firefox/xxxxxxxx.default directory. If you want to start a profile which is not known to Firefox (i.e. not mentioned in ~/.mozilla/firefox/profiles.ini), use:\nfirefox -no-remote -profile /media/EXTERNAL/firefox-profile\n\n\nA: Firefox profile directories are a pain (if not impossible) to version, mostly SQLITE and JSON (main formats used to store data), are not handy with Git (though you can tweak in order to diff them).\nThe extension's directory, including big XML files are not better.\nThe config.js is often cluttered with 2k-long directives coming from extensions and automagic timestamps.\nAFAICT Firefox is the most problematic application WRT to home-versioning.\nIf you add varying extension-paths & versions (distribution/home-variable) and core file format variations along with Firefox upgrades into the picture, then it becomes very hard to track.\nI was never able to version correctly a couple of profiles between Debian and Gentoo.\nSo actually nothing stops you to version Firefox profiles, but you'll fight to diff most files and never expect a merge to succeed for anything else than the user.js file.\n", "Q: Unable to connect to detected wireless network while connects to wired I'm using a dual boot pc with windows and ubuntu 10.10.

For example I want to extract some files with File Roller into /usr/share/ where apparently root is required but instead of the error that it gives me I would like a password prompt.\n\nA: To directly answer your question: No, there is no way (as far as I am aware) to make a program to ask for a password instead of failing when it doesn't have enough permissions to perform an operation. There are two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Some programs are aware that they need administrative privileges for some operations and ask for a password before doing something (i.e. Software Center asks for a password before installing programs). \n\n*Most other programs need to be started with necessary privileges. As it has been mentioned, you need to use sudo [command] (in terminal), gksu [command] (in Gnome/Unity) or kdesu [command] (in KDE) for that.\n\nA: The usual way is to go in command line mode (alt + F2 xterm, or dash terminal) then use gksudo file-roller and enter your password.\nsudo and gksudo will give you root privileges.\n\nA: You'd have to start File Roller using gksu as mentioned by the previous user. When you add items to your startup bar, you can use a command such as faxanswer that requires privileges:\ngksu faxanswer ttyS4\nIf you are using that File Roller once to update stuff in /usr/share, it's better to just use the Run command than create a permanent icon.\n\nA: Is there any way to make programs ask for password when root is required?\nYes - with the helper scripts.\nHere is an example with the bash copy (cp). The copying (backup) is wrapped in the perl script to check the owner of the file. The script is using the perl stat /1/ command. Here the script is called from the KDE service menu /2/. If the file is owned by the root /3/ then the  KDE frontend for sudo is used /4/, /5/.\nbackup.pl:\nusage: \"backup.pl filename\"\n#!/usr/bin/perl -w\n\n$FILENAME = $ARGV[0];\n\n$MARKER = \"_Backup_\";\n\n($DAY,$MONTH,$YEAR) = (localtime)[3,4,5];\n$DAY_STAMP = sprintf '%04d%02d%02d', $YEAR+1900, $MONTH+1, $DAY;\n\nfor ( $I=0; $I<101; $I++ ) {\n   if ( $I > 99 ) { die system (\"kdialog --sorry '...too many copies'\"); }\n   $INDEX = sprintf '%02d', $I;\n   $NEW_NAME = $FILENAME . $MARKER . $DAY_STAMP . $INDEX;\n   last unless (-e $NEW_NAME);\n}\n\n$UID = (stat(\"$FILENAME\"))[4];\n\n@Q_COPY_COMMAND = (\"\\\"\", \"cp\", \"$FILENAME\", \"$NEW_NAME\", \"\\\"\");\n@COPY_COMMAND = (\"cp\", \"$FILENAME\", \"$NEW_NAME\");\n\nif ( $UID == 0 ) {\n   system (\"kdesudo bash -c @Q_COPY_COMMAND\");\n} else {\n   system (\"@COPY_COMMAND\");\n}\n\n\nLinks:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/stat.html\n\n*http://techbase.kde.org/Development/Tutorials/Creating_Konqueror_Service_Menus\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo\n\n*http://kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=72106\n\n*https://launchpad.net/kdesudo\n", "Q: Problems with Broadcom 4313 on 64-bit Ubuntu 11.04 As the title says, I have issues with my wireless connection.

Now I cannot boot. Please help? The problem: I was asked by a pop-up window whether I wanted to upgrade to a new version of Ubuntu. I clicked yes, and followed prompts. I then left it to get on with its thing as it seemed to be taking a while. Unfortunately my netbook, which wasnt plugged in, ran out of battery before the installation was completed. When I next attempted to boot up Ubuntu I just get the main loading page with the dots under the word ubuntu. It never progresses from that point. I need a fix.\nI realise there are existing threads on this topic but I can't understand the responses to them. If you can help me to sort this problem out then its important for you to understand that I have zero knowledge of Ubuntu or how it works. A friend set me up on ubuntu in the first place and by and large I've never had any problems so haven't had to fiddle with code. I've been running Ubuntu alongside Windows (I'm on windows now), on a split hard drive. As I can no longer boot Ubuntu I can no longer access any of the files on the ubuntu half of the hardrive.\nTo give you an idea of where I'm at, I have a vague idea that there's a thing called a terminal and at a push I might work out how to open it. At this point, confronted by an utterly perplexing code, I give up. I repeat, I do not know what SUDO is. I do not know anything whatsoever about commands or how they work. I'm willing to learn but I need talking through this step by step. Assume I know nothing and you'll be spot on. If someone could help me with this I would be very grateful as there are an awful lot of files in limbo which I'd dearly like to regain access to.\n\nA: First off, your main friend in this situation is a live CD or live USB. You need one before you can continue. If you don't have one, you'll need access to another machine. Follow the instructions on the Ubuntu.com website (in the download section) to create it.\nThe easiest--though not necessarily the best--approach is to boot from the live CD, rescue your files, and reinstall. Here's a better approach, but be warned: It depends heavily on the terminal.\nFirst, find out the name of your root partition. You can use GParted for this (it's included on the live CD). It will probably be something like /dev/sda1 or /dev/sda2. Its format will probably be ext3 or ext4 and will definitely not be NTFS or FAT32. I'm assuming in this answer that your root partition is /dev/sda1, but be sure to change the commands below to reflect the actual partition!\nFirst, mount the root partition on /mnt.\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\n\nNow, bring across some important other parts of the filesystem via bind mounts (bind mounts make a particular directory available at some other location).\nsudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev\nsudo mount --bind /dev/shm /mnt/dev/shm\nsudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc\nsudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys\n\nNow, chroot into your system. This means that your terminal will be operating in your install (not the live CD environment), so you can execute commands as if your machine were bootable.\nsudo chroot /mnt\nsu - yourusername    # Replace with your login username\n\nNow, you can try to recover your system. The first thing to try is this:\nsudo aptitude install\n\nIf that fails, it will likely tell you a command to run. If so, follow the instructions given.\nHopefully, that'll do it for you. Once the process finishes, you should be able to reboot normally.\n", "Q: rtl text in emacs I'm using emacs to write my thesis. I need to create a Hebrew abstract.

So how do I get it?\n\nA: You need to enable multiverse repositories to install rar.

My external monitor doesn't have audio, so I want to keep the audio in the laptop's speakers. How can I do that?\n\nA: Go to the sound menu at the top of the screen and click preferences. Alternatively, execute the command alsa-mixer. Under the output tab, see if there is an option in the dropdown for HDMI Output.\n\nA: On the volume icon on the desktop, there should be an icon of the external HDMI device. Press that and you should be able to disable that device for sound and it will automatically use the built in sound of your laptop.\n\nA: What worked for me was going to System Preferences > Sound > Output and choosing my headphones as the device for sound output.\n", "Q: Verify Email address (Not just syntax) Is there any software in Ubuntu that can verify email address (not syntax, email exists or not). I need a software or script or anything to check whether an email address exists or not (not email syntax).\n\nA: If you really need to verify that the address is valid you need to send a message, and get an appropriate response.   This is commonly done by embedding a link to a web page which completes the address verification.  \nVerifying addresses prior to actual delivery can be unreliable.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Many servers will detect hosts are verifying addresses and begin falsifying results, or start classifying their email as spam.\n\n*Other sites accept all mail to their domain and simply drop invalid addresses.  The ratio of dropped addresses to real addresses can be used to classify the sender a spam sender.\n\n\nChecking that the domain portion of the address has an MX is a good validity check.  A few valid email addresses may have an A record without an MX record, but most of these domains will be invalid.  The syntax of the user portion of the address can be validated.  A simple syntax check works in most cases, especially if you limit only accept the routing portion of the address.   Addresses like \"Some user\" <someuser!host#otherhost@example.com> are more difficult to handle.\nI have run a periodic validation script on user's email addresses.  This did do validation by connecting to the mail server and validating the recipient.   This was done with a limited set of domains from a trusted domain.   Some domains had to be handled as special cases as they would give high rates of false positives or false negatives.   In either case, the validation call-out was disabled for that domain. \n\nA: To verify that an email recipient really exists you have to send a message to the server, if you get no return the user exists, else you get your email back with an error message.\nThere is no other way of doing this, there are so many mail servers out there that even if one server supported this option that would not mean all of them would.\nNot much you can do :(\nThere are scripts (as you know) that verify syntax and force you to double check it but the true verification comes in the form of a email sent to that address to verify if it exists and to verify that the user inputted an email address of his own.\nOfc you can use an library that checks if the server exists (like libmail-verify), but to check if a user exists that is another issue.\n\nA: apt-cache search email | grep verify returns libmail-verify-perl\nAfter installing it check the man page for details, should be exactly what you need.\n", "Q: why syntax error near unexpected token ' fi ' #!/bin/bash\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\necho -e \"please insert user name :\"\n\nread un\n\necho \"$un\"\n\nlen=${#un}\n\necho \"$len\"\n\nze=0\n\nte=10\n\nif [ \"$len\" -eq \"$ze\" ]\n\nthan\n\necho \"no argument\"\n\nexit\n\nfi\n\nif [ \"$len\" -ge \"$te\" ]\n\nthan\n\necho \"the Argument maximum 10 alphanumeric\"\n\nexit\n\nfi\n\n\nA: In short: spelling error: it's then, not than.\nLonger story: the syntax of the if command is this (boldface characters mark words that cannot be omitted or replaced):\n\nif test-commands; then\n    commands;\n  fi\n\nwhere you can replace the ; token with a new line character.\nThe shell will interpret than as part of test-commands, but then it finds a fi statement, which is incorrect (and, yes, unexpected) because it never encountered the then part.\n", "Q: I seemed to have deleted my kernel pae headers how do I recover?

It says that I have to install some packages first for using git and stuff if I'm running a clean server, which I actaully do:\nsudo apt-get install g++ curl libssl-dev apache2-utils git-core\n\nOkay - everything's good so far. But why should I install some apache stuff, when I only want to use node.js?\nDo I really need that?\n\nThis question is only relevant for people, who want to compile node themselves. I recommend using the simpler and safer  apt-get method.\n\nA: The name apache2-utils is misleading. It is not a part of the Apache server. Apache just depends on stuff that you can find in this package. As it turns out, the compiler (or node itself) depends on the same utilities.\nThis means, that after the compilation and installation of node apache2-utils can be safely removed via sudo apt-get remove apache-2utils. This applies to the other packages aswell. However I don't recommend removing any of the packages. You will likely want to recompile node as soon as there's a new version.\ntl;dr You're doing nothing wrong, when installing apache2-utils. It is a package of utilities, needed for compiling node. You can remove it after compilation.\n", "Q: How submit a bug fix to Ubuntu?

The biggest issue I have found is that when it does connect, it doesn't stay connected. \nIt continually connects and disconnects to the network. Does anyone know why this is happening, and how I would go about fixing the issue? Thank you and look forward to trying your solutions.\n\nA: There are several reasons for that, possible causes:\n\n\n*\n\n*your disk have hardware failure, like I/O errors...\n\n*You have multiple firewalls enabled, and it is better to have only one, maybe \"gufw\" is the best... and it needs to deny all with rules to allow out udp 53 and allow out tcp 25,53,80,110,143,843,993,5060,8080\n\n*Your OS is not with all modules inserted, type: lsmod > list1.txt\nThen create an USB installer with the \"startup disk creator\" using the ISO of your installation CD (a pen of 2 GB is enough) then boot from that USB PEN and choose \"try Ubuntu\" and type there: lsmod > list2.txt and copy this file to the same location the one above and open  both in text editor and see if there is missing modules in list1.txt...\nTo install missing modules use first modinfo \"name of the module\" after the description see if it needs dependencies and install those first if not, just copy the full path of the ko file and type sudo insmod \"paste path/file.ko\", after all modules inserted no need for reboot things should start working fine...\n\n*If you do not use proprietary driver, then might solve the problem due to the fact that the CPU is having trouble to process all the system in realtime, and that lack of CPU speed and Bridge speed causes wi-fi to disconnect, so try to install proprietary driver for your wireless card or disconnect every USB device that is not needed by your system to connect to the internet. If you do not find how to do this, go to \"software center\" and type \"additional drivers\" and if not installed, install it, then start it and activate all drivers available cause it will speed hings up and using less CPU...\n\n*This one is certainly your case, you are booting from an USB disk and using very fast speed which causes system resources to collapse, and has to shutdown one, and because the USB disk is the boot disk it chooses to disconnect the Wi-Fi! Solution is to connect the USB disk to an hub of less speed, like if was connected to USB3, use an USB2 hub which causes the USB disk to work at USB2 speed, if it was using USB2 then use an USB1.1 hub...\n\n*This is a long shot, and at far, your browser internet agent got corrupt or hacked by some intermediary that poses for an \"authority\" of contents provided by you, but this is a false authority, and just a cyberbulling occurence, cause there is no internet content that violates internet rules set by the internet authorities, and besides that you or anyone do not have nothing to do with the contents received, because everyone just enters the URL and the server decides which content to send, like, if two guys access the same URL at the same time, they get different pages content cause the server sends data according to lots of parameters and is configured to apply local country rules, like nudity can be considered ilegal in one country and not in other country. There is also the copyright issue but this also is not possible to violate, cause the copyright is not the act of making copies but the act of posing to be the author, that said, if one uploads copyrighted material without trying to own the copyright does not violate any internacional copyright rule. This two are the most common accusations by false \"authorities\" which makes your agent set your browser ID has an internet criminal act origin, causing every server in the world to disconnect that browser has soon it processes the browser agent, which sometimes takes several minutes... \n", "Q: Modem Network DIsconnected.

How do I edit an invalid sudoers file? It throws the below error and it's not allowing me to edit again to fix it.\nHere is what happens:\n$ sudo visudo\n>>> /etc/sudoers: syntax error near line 28 <<<\nsudo: parse error in /etc/sudoers near line 28\nsudo: no valid sudoers sources found, quitting\n\n\nA: If you messed up your sudoers file, you'll need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot into recovery mode (hit escape during boot, choose the recovery mode option on the grub screen)\n\n*Choose the 'Enable networking' option (if you don't your filesystem will be mounted as read-only. who knew)\n\n*Chosee the 'Drop to root shell' option\n\n*run visudo, fix your file\n\n*Reboot with normal grub option\n\n\nsource :- http://mario.net.au/content/recover-etcsudoers-ubuntu-1204\n\nA: Always use visudo to edit your sudoers file, never edit it directly yourself. It will prevent you saving it to disk unless it validates.\n\nA: For WSL users, accessing a bad sudoers is much more straightforward:\nwsl.exe -u root visudo\n\nIf you cannot recover the file manually this way, you can reset it to the default installed version (adapted from this answer) with:\nwsl.exe -u root -e apt install --reinstall -o Dpkg::Options::=\"--force-confask,confnew,confmiss\" sudo\n\nImportant:  This will reset all configuration files associated with sudo, including other customizations done in /etc/sudoers.d.\n\nA: On a modern Ubuntu system (and many other GNU/Linux distributions), fixing a corrupted sudoers file is actually quite easy, and doesn't require rebooting, using a live CD, or physical access to the machine.\nTo do this via SSH, log in to the machine and run the command pkexec visudo. If you have physical access to the machine, SSH is unnecessary; just open a Terminal window and run that pkexec command.\nAssuming you (or some other user) are authorized to run programs as root with PolicyKit, you can enter your password, and then it will run visudo as root, and you can fix your /etc/sudoers.\nIf you need to edit one of the configuration files in /etc/sudoers.d (which is uncommon in this situation, but possible), use pkexec visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/filename.\nIf you have a related situation where you have to perform additional system administration commands as root to fix the problem (also uncommon in this circumstance, but common in others), you can start an interactive root shell with pkexec bash. Generally speaking, any non-graphical command you'd run with sudo can be run with pkexec instead.\n(If there is more than one user account on the system authorized to run programs as root with PolicyKit, then for any of those actions, you'll be asked to select which one you want to use, before being asked for your password.)\nIf that doesn't work--for example, if there are no users authorized to run programs as root via PolicyKit--then boot from an Ubuntu live CD (like the CD you probably used to install Ubuntu) and mount the filesystem for the installed system. You can do this by running sudo parted -l to view your partitions--there is probably just one ext4 partition, and that's the root filesystem. \n\nSuppose the installed Ubuntu system's root filesystem is on /dev/sda1. Then you could mount it with sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt. Then you can edit the installed system's sudoers file with sudo nano -w /mnt/etc/sudoers. Or, even better, you can edit it with\nsudo visudo -f /mnt/etc/sudoers\n(which will prevent you from saving a sudoers file with incorrect syntax).\n\nA: There is nothing wrong #include sudoer.d\nremoving #include sudoer.d won't make any difference. \nBut please make sure you don't have any syntax errors.\nI had same issue but and spent hours to fix and just figured out they are syntax errors.\nRefer to manual and make them right.\nFor example \nSay your username is : dolly\nI used following which is wrong\n dolly ALL = (ALL) ALL NO PASSWD: ALL\n\ncorrect syntax is\ndolly ALL = (ALL) ALL //give permission to everything, not good\n\nor\ndolly ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/thurderbird //good, give specific permission\n\nhope this helps\n\nA: Type in:\npkexec visudo\n\nThen change last line\n#includedir /etc/sudoers\n\nTo:\n#includedir /etc/sudoers.d\n\nIt should solve your problem.\n\nA: run recovery mode then type this \nchown -R root:root /etc/sudoers.d\nchmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx /etc/sudoers.d/\nchmod u=r,g=r,o= /etc/sudoers.d/*\nonly the group and user root should have read privelege \n\nA: When this happens to a non-GUI system (your production server, maybe) the pkexec fails with this error message:\npolkit-agent-helper-1: error response to PolicyKit daemon: GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.PolicyKit1.Error.Failed: No session for cookie\n==== AUTHENTICATION FAILED ===\nError executing command as another user: Not authorized\n\nIn this situation, using pkttyagent can be helpful. If you want to remove a corrupted file in sudoers.d directory, use this:\npkttyagent -p $(echo $$) | pkexec rm /etc/sudoers.d/FILENAME\n\nIf you want to recover the default /etc/sudoers, you can use this gist to copy the default configurations, putting it in a non-root accessed place (e.g. your $HOME). Then, you can overwrite your sudoers file:\npkttyagent -p $(echo $$) | pkexec cp ~/sudoers /etc/sudoers\n\nNOTE: Using this approach, after running your command, probably your access to the shell will be gone. But I'm sure losing one shell session is much better than losing your server! (According to the manpage, this is the normal behavior: When its services are no longer needed, the process can be killed.)\n\nA: You can also login as root on a tty console with Ctrl+Fn (Fn from 1 to 6) and run visudo.\n\nA: pkexec visudo\n\nthen revert your mistakes\n\nA: if anyone else like me didn't have pkexec installed, or was not able to run vi, visudo, nano or any other editor to change sudoers file you can be sure with this process.. I was saved with this:\n\n\n*\n\n*reboot\n\n*hold shift key while booting to have option for recovery mode (enter it)\n\n*enter command line as root (second last option at my grub menu)\n\n*remount boot device for rw, and apply exec right for user, and edit file\nmount -n -o remount,rw /\nchmod u+x /etc/sudoers\nvisudo /etc/sudoers\n\nfix that mistake and be happy :)\n\nA: You can edit your boot entry while in grub as well.\nSimply reboot your pc, and wait for grub to show. Then press \"e\" on the \"Ubuntu\" entry to edit it.\nLook for a line with \"linux = \" or \"kernel = \" and simply add an \"single\" to the end of that line.\nThen press F10 to boot this temporarily modified boot entry.\nThis will give you a shell (without GUI) with root rights and you can edit the sudoers file with s.th. like nano /etc/sudoers back to its previous state.\nThen reboot and its done.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 16.04 running on a VirtualBox (shouldn't make a difference), the above methods didn't work for me (invalid row in the end of the file). What did work was:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart the VirtualBox\n\n*Let it boot normally, until it asks for your username & password in the console\n\n*Login normally with your username\n\n*Then when you end up in the console (provided your box doesn't boot into a GUI), simply give the command su - and then give your own username's password.\n\n*It should now end up in root@ubuntu-xenial:~# prompt, if the /etc/sudoers isn't too broken or empty. Not sure what would happen in that case.\n\n*Then you can simply run visudo and fix the file.\n\n*Then Ctrl + X and it will prompt to Save modified buffer. Press Y and Enter\n\n*Restart the box and it should work now.\n\n\nIn case your /etc/sudoers is empty or missing something, and you can edit it, then here's the contents of mine:\nDefaults env_reset\nDefaults mail_badpass\nDefaults secure_path=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin\"\n\nroot ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\n%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\n%sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\n\nA: Good practice: a backup terminal window and run sudo su there. On another termianl run visudo or sudo vim /etc/sudoers. If anything goes wrong, go back to terminal one and fix the file. You may ask, why not just run sudo su before visudo in one terminal? This works as well, but has higher risk of you closing the terminal before you know it. \n\nA: There is a way simpler solution. Without rebooting, recovery mode, or pkgexec (pkgexec didn't work and have no idea why or how I should use it), simply do:\nsu root # switch to root user, without using sudo (which is broken at this point)\nyour_favorite_editor /etc/sudoers # e.g. nano\n\nAnd then just fix the syntax error!\n\nA: Adding this for the new wave of WSL-based Linux VMs. When I locked myself out of my debian-based WSL2 VM (Pengwin) which didn't have pkexec and the root password was not set, here's what I found fixed the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a Windows Powershell as administrator (right-click 'Run as Administrator')\n\n*Set the default user on the VM to be root (because it won't ask for a password) per this how-to: \n\n\n<distro.exe> config --default-user root\n\nExample:\nubuntu1804.exe config --default-user root \n\nor\npengwin.exe config --default-user root\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Re-launch your distro.\n\n*You should now be root and can go fix your sudo problem.\n\n*Repeat the process to set the default user back to normal.\n\n\nA: If you have access to reboot the server, you can reboot it and catch it at the grub prompt for Ubuntu. Press 'e' to edit the grub boot config.\nFind the line that starts with linux and is indented, then go to the end of that line, and add a space then init=/bin/bash. Next press F10 to boot the server. At the root shell prompt enter mount -o remount,rw / and press enter.\nNow you have access as root to modify the /etc/sudoers or /etc/sudoers.d/filename.\nOnce you have finished modifying the files as needed, enter reboot -f and the server will reboot as normal, and your sudo issues should be resolved.\n", "Q: Postfix + Gmail.

Following SarveshLad comment I was trying to recover more space and running Bleachbit application when I got another error of low space on HD. Then the system froze. How on earth can my Ubuntu fill up HD with over 100GB within minutes?\n\nA: According to your df listing, you have plenty of free space on /.  After you get one of these messages, check df again and if it still shows plenty of free space, check the output of dmesg for errors.  It is possible that you are getting an error that is causing the filesystem to be remounted read only, and that might be confusing the free space notifier.  From the livecd, you should open the disk utility and check the drive's SMART status to make sure it doesn't have any bad sectors or anything.  Running the long self test might be a good idea too, and checking the filesystem after that.\n\nA: This is almost certainly due to being actually out of space on the root filesystem.  If you have lots of free space on your drive, then you likely have a separate filesystem for your user data.  This is a common setup.\nTo find the amount of free space on all your partitions, run the \"disk free\" command, df.  You do not need to be root.  You'll get something like the following:\nFilesystem           1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda1              9614116   8382396   1134048  89% /\nnone                   1541244       284   1540960   1% /dev\nnone                   1546180      4804   1541376   1% /dev/shm\nnone                   1546180       372   1545808   1% /var/run\nnone                   1546180         0   1546180   0% /var/lock\nnone                   1546180         0   1546180   0% /lib/init/rw\nnone                   9614116   8382396   1134048  89% /var/lib/ureadahead/debugfs\n/dev/sda3             32218292  12333212  19885080  39% /home\n\nAs you can see, I have a separate root filesystem (the first one listed) and user data filesystem (the last one listed), and my root partition is pretty close to full.  If your df output shows you that your root filesystem is actually full, you need to delete some files (careful which ones!), or resize your partitions.\nA useful terminal command for finding what's eating up all the space is the \"disk usage\" command, du.  Invoked without any parameters, it starts listing the sizes of every file in the current directory, and in every directory below.  More useful for tracking down usage is in your scenario is sudo du -s -h -x /*, which will give you the total amount of space used (-s) by each file or directory at the top of your root filesystem (/*), without looking at other filesystems (-x), in human-readable numbers like \"124M\" (-h).  Don't worry if it takes a while to complete, it will take on the order of minutes the first run through.\nDon't delete files without first knowing what they are, of course.  But, in general, you won't break your system if you delete files in the following directories:\n\n\n*\n\n*/tmp (user temp data -- these are commonly all deleted every reboot anyway)\n\n*/var/tmp (print spools, and other system temporary data)\n\n*/var/cache/* (this one can be dangerous, research first!)\n\n*/root (the root user's home directory)\n\n\nIn addition to the locations above, the following locations are common culprits:\n\n\n*\n\n*/opt (many third-party apps install here, and don't clean up after themselves)\n\n*/var/log (log files can eat up a lot of space if there are repetitive errors)\n\n\nSo, check those first.  If it turns out that things look correct and your root partition is simply too small, you'll need to resize your partitions to fit.  There are a myriad of ways to do that, but likely the easiest is to boot from an Ubuntu LiveCD (get it from the Ubuntu site's download page) and run the GNOME partition editor gparted.  You may have to install the gparted package first (from within the LiveCD environment, run sudo apt-get install gparted or use the software center).  In any case, it is a graphical utility that will allow you to right-click on the partition and select \"resize\".  \nN.B. -- do not have any operating systems hibernated as you resize partitions, or it will either not work, or do terrible things to your hibernated OS.\n", "Q: aptitude state is corrupt - how do I fix it? It appears that the aptitude state is corrupt - note that apt-get and the other dpkg tools still work fine.

As other tools are working, there's no harm in trying:\nsudo mv /var/lib/aptitude/pkgstates /root/aptitude.pkgstates.backup\nmv .aptitude .aptitude.backup\n\nIf aptitude starts working properly after those changes, you can remove the backups.

The problem is that they take some time to load (for example eclipse). \nis there any way to do auto-login on the account and lock screen so no-one else can use my account?\n\nA: Use gnome-screensaver-command -l right after the list of programs you load.\nIt will lock your screen when you run it.\n\nA: Maybe use a utility like preload to load the applications into memory for you prior to login:\nsudo apt-get install preload\n\nThen Eclipse, Firefox and friends should start up in a jiffy.  I haven't tried it myself, though, and you should probably read up on how it works and how to configure it.\n", "Q: Authenticate user that has no password? I've set up my user account so that no password is required to login and I need to install some updates.  However when prompted for the password, it says authentication failed if I leave the box blank.  I don't have a password, how am I supposed to authenticate?\nEDIT\nI tried the method in Reset lost administrative(root) password but it came out with an error: Authentication token manipulation error password unchanged.  What does this mean?\n\nA: Auto login is not password less, it just bypasses the password and logs you in automatic. you still have a password, its the same one you used for the installation and the installation wont run if the password box is empty. You must have used something to install, that is the same password you need atm.\n\nA: All you have to do is go to Users and Groups, then set a password. I didn't have a password originally but after trying for ages, I just set a password on the default administrator account and entered that same password when it was asking for authentication and it worked.\n\nA: When at grub (hold shift while loading) press 'e'. You'll enter a boot parameters edit mode.\nFind a section with your kernel, actually you'll need line like:\nlinux   /boot/vmlinuz-3.0.0-17-generic root=...\nAppend the line with \"init=/bin/bash\" and press Ctrl+x\nYou'll boot to a shell with root privileges. Use 'passwd' to change root password. \n\nA: You may try this...\nIt worked for me...\nsudo passwd root\n\nIt first asks for your password.\nThen changes root password\nIf you forgot your password you may be able to do this by creating new user a/c and then entering that new password\nHope that helps...\n\nA: Drop to root shell as in the link you mentioned and before resetting the password, remount the file system using the command:\nmount -rw -o remount /\n\nAfter that you may update your password by the command:\npasswd <user_name>\n\neg. passwd sam\nAfter that enter a valid password  ( meeting the minimum requirements for strength) and confirm it\nwhen prompted.\nThis should work out.\n", "Q: Unable to burn to CDs with Brasero or K3b (cdrecord and cdrao(?)) both fail.

claims I may need to change the permissions (which I tried). That doesn't seem to work, and all the Google searching I've done seems useless.\nI recall something about power calibration failing - but I was on my way to bed, and later to church, when I was trying to burn the CD - so I did not have the time to record what it was.\n\nI have tried:\nsudo chmod 4755 /usr/bin/wodim - no go.\n\nBTW - the drive can read CDs just fine, though it takes forever to show what's on them (the laptop is a wee bit old (almost 4 years!), and I've kept upgrading since 8.10 or 8.04, so I think that might be the problem with the speed).\n\nIs there a way around these errors? Or is this a hardware issue? If I need to add more debugging info, let me know.\n\nI tried this on another system with 11.10 (another laptop) and it's fine...\n\n(I'm experienced enough so you can ask me to do dmesg and all the jazz :D).\n\nA: It could be that your optical disk is failing. If you have a USB optical drive on hand, try using that, and see if it works.\n\nA: For now, I am unable to check up on the status of this issue, but it seems the drive is working fine for the most part. I will probably update if anything changes (since I'm on 12.04 now).\nUPDATE:\nTurns out the drive laser is shot :).\n", "Q: Can not telnet to 25 port I can not connect any mail server using telnet through 25 port. I can connect with any web-server using 80 port.So i searched for my open port \nsudo nmap -sS -p 20-2550 localhost\n\nIt shows:\nNmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)\nHost is up (0.0000060s latency).\nNot shown: 2524 closed ports\nPORT    STATE SERVICE\n22/tcp  open  ssh\n23/tcp  open  telnet\n80/tcp  open  http\n139/tcp open  netbios-ssn\n445/tcp open  microsoft-ds\n631/tcp open  ipp\n902/tcp open  iss-realsecure\n\nNo 25 port open. When i try to connect with mail-server it just timeout. How could i enable telnet 25 port.\nThanks in advance\n\nA: Port 25 is used for SMTP, for sending mails which is different from receiving mails using POP3 or IMAP. To check if something is listening on port 25, use sudo netstat -tunlp (TCP, UDP, numeric addresses, listening services, show programs (for which you need sudo)). If the output is large, try filtering it by appending | grep :25 so it becomes sudo netstat -tunlp | grep :25.\nIf you're trying to telnet to external servers or network IP's, be sure that the router or your provider does not block port 25. Here, the Dutch ISP KPN blocks port 25 which will make your requests go into /dev/null (hence the timeout).\n", "Q: How can I reset my desktop to be like new? After I upgraded to 11.10, I made some mistake which totally destroyed Unity(I'm not sure at all what I did). I deleted all the configuration files that I knew of, and now at least it will start, but it's using the Raleigh theme and the Gnome icon theme. I can't do anything to change it in Gnome-Tweak or Appearance settings. The problem isn't just limited to unity; it affects Gnome, too. If login to the guest session, everything is fine.\nThe themes, theme engines, and icon themes are installed.\nNote: I have tried everything, and no answer on this site has fixed my problem, including this one\nSo is there a way to reset everything back the way it was, but still keep my bookmarks, passwords, and application settings?\nunity --reset doesn't work.\n\nA: Since login to guest works nice why not create a new user, backup your files in to the new user account, delete the old user?\n\nA: As far as I know, everything in linux is a file. Therefore, this should be enough to reset gnome :  \nrm -rf .gnome .gnome2 .gconf .gconfd .metacity\n\nAfter removal, log out, and back log in.\n\nA: After a lot of trying things out, I backed up my .config folder, created a new account, and replaced my config folder with the new one.\n", "Q: Thunderbird addon to send one email to multiple recipients? is there a thunderbird plugin/addon to send one email to more than one recipient without using cc or bcc and only to field.  I am not looking for a bulk mailer just something to help me email the same message to my employees without them knowing who I sent what to ?\n\nA: Mail Merge for Thunderbird works great, unless you've updated to Thunderbird 11.0. The 'Personalize' function uses a contact list (address book) you create, ie 'Salesmen'. The message you type is sent as an individual email for each person on that list.\nWorked great until Thunderbird updated to 11.0. BTW- it's considered 'deadware' now. Too bad.\n\nA: Open your address book, click the button Add List, enter the name of the recipients you want to mail to on the new window.\nAdd the list to bcc, done.\n", "Q: Is it possible to remove \"Nautilus search box\" from the desktop? The Nautilus search box (I don't know if there is a name for it), it shows up whenever I start to type when I'm on the desktop (All applications are closed). \n\n\n*\n\n*Is it normal feature?\n\n*Is it a problem or a bug?\n\n*Is it possible to remove it from the desktop only?\n\n\nA: I would think this is expected behavior when using the 'Have file manager handle the desktop' option. If it's showing up with that option disabled then that could be a bug.\nI believe that option is now default enabled for both unity* & gnome-shell - I'm assuming you're using 11.10, you haven't specified what you're on.\n\nA: I just had this question answered for me in my related question. It is a Gnome Shell search the desktop tool. It highlights relevant things on the desktop.\n\nA: For Ubuntu 16.04, Use The Tweak Tool and Turn Icons on Desktop off.\n\n", "Q: Vinagre only gives 800x600 RDC resolution, how to increase? Using Vinagre on Ubuntu 11.10, when I RDC into a remote Windows XP machine, I only get a 800x600 resolution on the remote display. I can't increase it on the Windows machine, it's stuck at 800x600. Any way to customise?\nIf I use Terminal Server Client on Ubuntu instead of Vinagre, I can adjust the res. Any way to fix for Vinagre?\n\nA: I couldn't figure it out either.  I'm now using remmina based on this post: http://www.jonathanmoeller.com/screed/?p=3411\nremmina has more (or easier to find) settings, right when you set up the connection.\n-Amir\n\nA: A quick hack:\n\n\n*\n\n*mv /usr/bin/rdesktop /usr/bin/rdesktop.bin\n\n*create the file /usr/bin/rdesktop to with the contents:  \n#!/bin/bash\n\n/usr/bin/rdesktop.bin -g 1024x768 $*\n\n*chmod 755 /usr/bin/rdesktop\nThe remote desktop viewer, vinagre, just runs rdesktop, so this in effect sets the default geometry.\n\nA: Remmina → Vinagre, if only because it allows different RDP resolutions, and it includes a feature to import tsclient config files.\n", "Q: Wireless dropping out on a BCM4313 My connection keep dropping out: I have to click on my home wifi-network to disconnect and reconnect to the internet.\nI tried to set MTU to 1500 as this post[1] suggest but my wireless keep dropping!\n[1] http://mylinuxramblings.wordpress.com/2011/10/16/how-to-stop-ubuntu-11-10-wireless-dropping-out/\nThe following question did not help me either: How do I stop my ethernet network connection from dropping?\nMy config is the following, ubuntu11.10 on HP Pavilion dv6, wifi using a WEP key:\n$ lspci | grep -i eth\n07:00.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.

The powertop program shows the power usage, but only after about five minutes. Before that, it shows:\n\nno ACPI power usage estimate available\n\nThat's one of the limitations of the powertop program. What program is recommended for reliably monitoring the power usage? Is it possible to get a power usage history similar to the memory usage history in the System Monitor as well?\n\nA: Have a look at s-tui: https://amanusk.github.io/s-tui/. Runs in the terminal, shows you the parameters pertinent to the CPU.\n\nA: You can have a look at PowerAPI (on github), which gives the power consumption at the process level on Linux. According to some experiments, it is more accurate than Powertop.\n\nA: As you surmised in your comment the limitation is not with the software but with your battery not reporting correctly.\nTo clarify these software tools below will only measure power consumption on laptops when running on battery. For desktop or server machines the only current solution is an electronic watt-meter that plugs into the mains socket.\n#Power Statistics\nIn Ubuntu Precise 12.04 there is a new power statistics history window. This can be accessed by clicking the battery item in the application indicator menu then selecting Latop Battery tab.\n\n#Powertop\nAs mentioned by the OP this program provides information on per process/device power usage.\n\n#Powerstat\nAnother alternative that measures process/device power usage is powerstat that was written for Ubuntu by Colin King. There is a detailed review of its features on hecticgeek.com.\nIt can be installed from the PPA: ppa:colin-king/powermanagement\n\n\nA: I found that only TLP was able to report power consumption in near-realtime (<3 s delay), while at least for my system Gnome Power Statistics (gnome-power-statistics) and upower had a delay of 120 seconds before the values updated again.\nTo see current power as reported by TLP, use this command:\nsudo tlp-stat --battery\n\nEnvironment: ThinkPad X201 Tablet with Ubuntu 20.04. TLP together with the SMAPI kernel module (that TLP recommends) installed with sudo apt install tlp tp-smapi-dkms, then TLP enabled with sudo tlp start. It may be that the SMAPI kernel module enables the more frequent updates, as it provides a different way to access and configure the battery.\n\nA: Intel has a cross-platform (MacOS, and Windows) app called 'Intel Power Gadget' which provides for logging of power consumption information, including cumulative power measurements, via a command line version and a GUI version.\nIntel have a version of Power Gadget for Linux but it hasn't been updated for a while.

I run a dual-boot (windows XP on ntfs + ubuntu 10.04 on ext3) on a crappy 6 year old laptop. Today I wanted to shread 8gb or so off the right end of my XP partition and give it to ubuntu. I ended up getting an \"unable to satisfy all constraints\" error when trying to enlarge the extended partition ubuntu was sitting on, which I suppose was because it had problems \"rounding\" to the nearest MiB. A google search into some forum post (which I can't find anymore) said you could just tell it to do no alignment (the choices were MiB, Cylinder, or None). I did this and everything seemed to work fine.\nI just rebooted and it hung after selecting Ubuntu from the GRUB loader. However, when I restarted it again (mostly absent-mindedly) it suddenly worked (this itself is weird - I was expecting having to manually change GRUB, as GParted itself suggested during the partitioning), though some things seemed sluggish for a few minutes (I can't tell anymore).\nFeeling paranoid about the weird hanging, auto-solution, and sluggishness, I did some more googling. I turns out that the GParted document says: \"Use None only if you have an in-depth knowledge of disk structure, partition tables, and boot records. This setting places partition boundaries relative to the end of any immediately preceding partition on the disk device. This setting is not guaranteed to reserve or respect space required for boot records.\" Further reading/googling seems to say that I also may be missing out on extra performance on SSDs or compatibility with old OSs, though neither of these apply to me.\nSo, questions:\n\"Considering I do not have the \"in-depth knowledge\" suggested by the GParted docs, will I be fine?

I'd recommend the 64-bit variety so you can get the most out of your hardware.\n\nA: The simple 'rule of thumb' is that if you have >=4Gb RAM and a 64-bit capable processor then you should install 64-bit OS. \n\nA: install 64 bit version and use this command to install 32 bit libraries,so that you dont have any problem running 32bit software..\napt-get install ia32-libs\n\n\nA: According to Newegg.com, the specs for your Dell laptop look just fine (http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834200286&nm_mc=KNC-GoogleAdwords&cm_mmc=KNC-GoogleAdwords-_-pla-_-NA-_-NA).

In the case it's not auto-mounted, you could add a line to /etc/fstab to mount it on boot.\nThere's some info in Ubuntu wiki on the subject\nStep 2: Suppose your NTFS partition is mounted in /media/disk_c. Then you can just create symlinks in your home directory to the folders on the NTFS partition. \nIf you want to replace the \"built-in\" Documents, Pictures directories, I would advice to remove them in terminal because Nautilus tracks any changes to those \"special\" folders when you change them via Nautilus and adjusts its settings, so renaming Documents to Documents.old and creating a new Documents symlink via Nautilus would not behave as you expect\nrm -rf /home/myusername/Documents\nln -s \"/media/disk_c/whereever/the/target/folder/lives/in/windows/My Documents\" /home/myusername/Documents\n\n", "Q: Stop folders opening with different application than the file manager After upgrading to Ubuntu 11.10, I once right-clicked on a folder and told it to open the folder with Movie Player (\"Open with other application...\"). \nNo harm done there, right?

How can I disable this shortcut, that I want to use for another purpose in my emacs configuration?\n\nA: It works in Ubuntu 13.04 and 14.04 LTS. \nGo to System-settings -> Keyboard (menu) -> Shortcuts (button) -> Windows (tab) and then select Toggle-shaded-state and press backspace to disable it, and close the window.\n\nA: You can change it in System Settings → Keyboards → Shortcuts → Windows.\n\nA: When You're using Compiz, then goto CompizConfig Settings Manager -> General -> General Options -> Key Bindings -> Toggle Window Shaded -> Edit -> empty the shortcut s.\n\nA: In 18.04, I used dconf-editor to change\n/org/gnome/desktop/wm/keybindings/toggle-shaded\n from\n['<Control><Alt>s']\n to\n['<Control><Shift><Alt>s'] so that emacs will get my regex search keystroke, but I can still (will I ever?) rollup the window shade.\nc.f. ctrl + alt + S on ubuntu 18.04 triggers a screen size toggle but is not listed in keyboard settings\n", "Q: Where to change this colour setting in KDevelop? In KDevelop, when you change the name of a variable, a function or the definition of a function, a little message appears below the editor (see image). In this instance it says \"Declare function 'get' as: 1 public cv::Matx34f\". However, I can't read this because the background is ?brown? and the text is black. \nThis changed after upgrading to Kubuntu 11.10.

How would I give them limitted sudo access such that they could still issue commands like\nsudo apt-get install epstopdf\n\nI imagine this could be an incredibly stupid question as once root user access is given, they could do whatever they want. Therefore, is there any way around this? I am open to suggestions\n\nA: sudo is exactly made for that. By editing the sudoers file you can give users specific privileges. See the manual page of sudoers(5) for details.\n\nA: Open a terminal and type sudo visudo. At the end of the file (really the last line in it) type %yourusername% ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt-get install where %yourusername% is replaced by your username.\nAfter that you wont be prompted for a password to use sudo apt-get install anymore but please understand this is a very risky solution, there is a reason why you need to type a password for some commands, the use of these commands without password can leave your system open for some dangers. Use with caution.\n\nA: From my answer to similar question on the Linux stachkexchange: link\nFor me the option with visodo required additional steps:\n\n*\n\n*Add yourself to the sudousers:\n\nLogin as root via su -, open sudo editor by visudo and add next lines:\n%yourusername% ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt-get install\n%yourusername% ALL=NOPASSWD: /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend\n\n\n\n*Exit session(root and yours) typing exit <Enter> exit <\\Enter>\n\n\n*Reopen it and type:\n sudo chown  %yourusername%: /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend\n chmod  u+w /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend \n sudo chown  %yourusername%: /var/lib/dpkg/lock\n chmod  u+w /var/lib/dpkg/lock\n sudo chown  %yourusername%: /var/cache/apt/archives/lock\n chmod  u+w /var/cache/apt/archives/lock\n sudo chown  %yourusername%:  /var/lib/apt/lists/lock\n chmod  u+w  /var/lib/apt/lists/lock\n\nPS: I also  added the visudo file lines to allow myself to update repos list:\n%yourusername% ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt-get update\n\n", "Q: How can I fix \"Check email\" broken icon in the unity menu?

A standard installation of Wireshark doesn't give the program permission to access the network interface. \nI suppose I have to run the program with sudo, but do not know how to add it to the icon - if that's the way to do it.\n\nA: You can also run Wireshark with root privileges by running gksu wireshark from the terminal.\nNote that there are security concerns with running Wireshark in this mode, namely that any exploit that compromises Wireshark now has root privileges rather than user privileges. This is more of a concern with Wireshark than other application because, by it's very nature (capturing and processing arbitrary input), Wireshark is more vulnerable to exploits than typical desktop applications. You are probably safe on a SOHO network, but you should be aware of this concern before proceeding.\nCitations:\n\n\n*\n\n*Capture privileges: Most UNIXes\n\n*Security including:\n\n*\n\n*Why is Wireshark so buggy?\n\n*Administrator/root account not required!\n\n\n*Debian README (also applies to Ubuntu)\n\n\nA: you can try this also, open the terminal, run this command\n# setcap 'CAP_NET_RAW+eip CAP_NET_ADMIN+eip' /usr/bin/dumpcap\n\nrun wireshark as a non-root user\n\nA: For WireShark there's a better way. The bit that normally needs root is the packet collection application and this can be configured to allow certain people to use it without sudo, gksu, etc.\nIn a terminal (very important that you're in a terminal, not just the Alt+F2 dialogue) run this:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common\n\nThis will ask you if you want to allow non-root user to be able to sniff. That's what we're aiming for, so select Yes and hit return.\n\nThis adds a wireshark group. Anybody in that group will be able to sniff without being root. This is obviously more secure than just letting anybody sniff but does mean there's no password checking. Technically any person with access to a computer logged in with a wireshark account will be able to sniff. If that's acceptable to you, carry on.\nIf not, run that again and select no.\nThen you just need to add the user to that group. Run this:\nsudo adduser $USER wireshark\n\nAnd restart or log out. When you're back in it should let you start sniffing without any fuss about being root.\n\nA: Really you do not need to launch WireShark as root. Please read official page. In brief you should do:\nsudo groupadd wireshark\nsudo usermod -a -G wireshark $USER\nsudo chgrp wireshark /usr/bin/dumpcap\nsudo chmod o-rx /usr/bin/dumpcap\nsudo setcap 'CAP_NET_RAW+eip CAP_NET_ADMIN+eip' /usr/bin/dumpcap\nsudo getcap /usr/bin/dumpcap\n\nThen log-out and log-in again. \nNote: this method was tested on 16.04 LTS, 17.10 and 18.04 LTS.\n", "Q: Install packages without starting background processes and services Sometimes installing some applications will start a process or service from the application being run automatically on installation. How do I install without starting them?\n\nA: What I ended up doing is emulating what debootstrap does when installing packages, except I used dpkg-divert:\nFirst move the real files out of the way:\ndpkg-divert --add --rename --local /sbin/start-stop-daemon\ndpkg-divert --add --rename --local /sbin/initctl\n\nThen create dummy versions:\necho \\\n\"#!/bin/sh\necho\necho \\\"Warning: Fake start-stop-daemon called, doing nothing\\\"\" > \"/sbin/start-stop-daemon\"\nchmod 755 \"/sbin/start-stop-daemon\"\n\necho \\\n\"#!/bin/sh\necho\necho \\\"Warning: Fake initctl called, doing nothing\\\"\" > \"/sbin/initctl\"\nchmod 755 \"/sbin/initctl\"\n\nThen do your apt-get upgrades, installs, etc., and then clean up with:\nrm /sbin/initctl /sbin/start-stop-daemon\ndpkg-divert --remove --rename /sbin/initctl\ndpkg-divert --remove --rename /sbin/start-stop-daemon\n\nI know there are other commands that can be used to stop/start services, but debootstrap only cares about start-stop-daemon and initctl, so I followed suit.\n\nA: There's a slightly hackish, but quite reliable way to do this which I've been using for a while in an automated installation script.\nFirst create a directory, for example /root/fake, which contains symlinks to /bin/true called:\ninitctl\ninvoke-rc.d\nrestart\nstart\nstop\nstart-stop-daemon\nservice\ndeb-systemd-helper\n\nYou could also make them bash scripts that do nothing and return success.\nThen include that directory at the front of $PATH when installing packages:\nPATH=/root/fake:$PATH apt-get install whatever\n\nThis only prevents daemons from starting/restarting, while things like creating an initramfs are still being done.\nExplanation\nThe scripts which are being executed at package installation and removal execute invoke-rc.d or others of the mentioned commands to start and stop services. They don't however call them with absolute paths (at least I haven't encountered one that does).\nSo by inserting the faked \"no operation\" commands at the beginning of $PATH, the real commands never get called.\nSince only the commands used to start/stop services are being faked, everything else, in particular important tasks like updating/creating initramfs-images still work.\n\nA: A quick one-liner:\necho -e '#!/bin/sh\\nexit 101' | install -m 755 /dev/stdin /usr/sbin/policy-rc.d && apt-get install **Package** && rm -f /usr/sbin/policy-rc.d\n\n\nA: Background daemons are started with invoke-rc.d, which makes sure that the daemon is not started if its rc script says it is not supposed to run in the current system runlevel.  You can override its idea of the current system runlevel by setting the environment variable RUNLEVEL.  Nothing is supposed to run in runlevels 0 and 6, but it appears that invoke-rc.d is buggy and runs things anyhow if you use these runlevels.  Most daemons do not run in runlevel 1, so you can prevent them from being started on install like this:\nsudo RUNLEVEL=1 apt-get install redis-server\n\n\nA: There is a better solution:\ncat > /usr/sbin/policy-rc.d <<EOF\n#!/bin/sh\nexit 101\nEOF\nchmod a+x /usr/sbin/policy-rc.d\n\n", "Q: ./configure: Mono version not recognized during MonoDevelop config I want to install MonoDevelop 2.10 and I have cloned the current release with git clone git://github.com/mono/monodevelop.git however running ./configure I get the error:\nchecking for UNMANAGED_DEPENDENCIES_MONO... no\nconfigure: error: Please install mono version 2.8 or later to install MonoDevelop.\nPlease see http://www.mono-project.org/ to download latest mono sources or packages\n\nAlthough I have Ubuntu 11.10 with Mono JIT compiler version 2.10.5 (Debian 2.10.5-1) (output of mono --version) this error seems to be trolling me.

I added the same script to /etc/network/ifup.d, and as I expected, I am getting a warning \nCould not change permissions for\n/home/deckoff/MyBookLive/GVFS-mount\n\nI suspect the reason is that the script that re-mounts at reconnect is run as sudo.

Is there a way to burn .mp3 music on CD in Ubuntu 11.10? There is Brasero installed but I also installed k3b.\n\nA: In brasero, you should be able to select new audio project, then drag and drop files.\n\n Of course you'll probably notice the files I'm using in this example are .ogg.  \nThat's just another format for multimedia files. You'll want to drag .mp3 files since it sounds like you want them to play on a device that supports mp3. \n\nA: If your CD player can play MP3 CDs, you can create a Data Project in Brasero and copy your MP3s onto the CD as regular files. This allows you to fit 100--200 songs on a CD depending on their quality.\nBUT, different players have different limitations on things like filenames, limits of subdirectories, etc. so it may take some experimenting to figure out what your MP3 CD player can and cannot play.\nOtherwise, if your CD player does not support MP3s, you're stuck with regular audio CDs (80 minutes).\n\nA: Just use Asunder. sudo apt-get install asunder. It works out of the box with fixed (up to 320 kbps) and variable bitrates. Though, I did have to go to preferences and change the CD-ROM device to /dev/sr0.\n\nA: In the past I have burnt many mp3 files with K3b to data disc and played them in a car cd/mp3 player.

I have Ubuntu 10.10. I know that one cannot directly jump from 10.10 to 11.10. So, first I have to upgrade to 11.04, then 11.10 . But how could I be sure that 11.04 and 11.10 will work on my pc? Is there any way to check that? Also, should I backup my data? And if yes, which folders?\n\nA: One way I usually test this is by using the liveCD iso image. I often take the .iso image and write it to a USB stick using the USB creator that Ubuntu has.\nUnfortunately, that does mean you have to download more things, as you end up downloading each version twice:once as a liveCD and once as Packages.\nEven if the Live(USB or CD) does work, there could be a small chance the upgrade doesn't do as well as you had hoped. It never hurts to have a backup. I usually use rsync like this (after plugging in an external drive, but in this case even another partition would work):\nrsync -avx --exclude '.gvfs' / /media/<drive>/<folder_you_want_backup_in>/\n\n\nA: Yes, unfortunately Ubuntu does not support jumping across versions. (It could work though, if you have some experience with apt.)\nFirst, you really want have a backup of your data. While, it's likely that your data does not actually get deleted during the process, if something goes wrong, it's much easier to recover if have a backup. All your personal data is in /home/yourusername/, system-wide configuration stuff is in /etc/. Many applications store their data in /home/yourusername/.appname/. The most simple backup strategy is to save everything in /home/ to an external HDD or network share.\nIf 10.10 works on your computer, all future version should also work. If something goes wrong (like an issue with the display driver), you can still restart with a fresh install of 11.10 (and the restore your backup.).\nActually, if you want a standard install of 11.10, backup + install 11.10 + restore data is probably faster than several upgrades.\n", "Q: How to integrate ubuntu one in pcmanfm (Lubuntu file manager)?

In the first case run chkdsk /f on Windows\nthen reboot into Windows twice. The usage of the /f parameter is very\nimportant! If the device is a SoftRAID/FakeRAID then first activate\nit and mount a different device under the /dev/mapper/ directory, (e.g.\n/dev/mapper/nvidia_eahaabcc1). Please see the 'dmraid' documentation\nfor more details\n\nIs it necessarily a hardware problem? If not, is there a way to repair the HD from Ubuntu?\n\nA: ntfsfix worked for me :\nsudo ntfsfix /dev/sdb1\n\nProvided in the ntfs-3g package.\n\nA: NTFS is a closed source Microsoft file system, and you'll need Windows to repair it, by running chkdsk /f, as suggested.\nIf the problem is hardware related, you'll have to replace the hdd.\n\nA: chkdsk /R is a pretty important command when  things get hairy with NTFS. Unfortunately I don't know of a Linux tool that comes close to covering everything it does. In short, to run it, you're going to need some sort of Windows recovery disk.\nIf you don't have one to hand, there's an ISO offered up in a thread on another set of support forums (see the first answer).\nThere are tools like ntfsfix (part of the ntfsprogs package) that can do surface checks on NTFS disks but they don't tend to be able to fix the drives.\n\nA: i have encountered a similar situation once,then i kept the harddisk on windows,then a popup appeared asking to check the disk for errors.\nif didn't ask goto computer,right click on the drive and then click on  properties,there would be a tab \"tools\"\n\nselect \"check now\"\nthis type of errors occur if you dont safely remove harddisks.\n\nA: Background:\nSo I was facing, more or less, the same issue. Around 12 files on the NTFS partition of my HD were inaccessible nor could they be deleted. Got to know about them through backintime's error logs. Fired up my Window 7 on vmware, accessed that folder containing the files through shared folder and copied them to a new folder. But for some reason I was not able to delete those files (0 bytes) from Windows 7 either. No surprise there, the OS did not have low-level access to those files.\nntfsfix did not fix it, said nothing was wrong, and fsck said all's cool with the the device. I could not chkdsk /R because the files were shared through network drive. And I didn't have Window 7 installed on my physical machine.\nSolution (steps for vmplayer, but could easily be followed for virtualbox):\n\n\n*\n\n*Add a new HD to your vm (had to start vmplayer as root)\n\n*When prompted for the disk type choose physical disk\n\n*Choose the correct device (for this reason vmplayer was started as root)\n\n*Select \"Use individual partitions\"\n\n*Select the partition containing the buggy files\n\n*Finish adding\n\n*Start the vm\n\n\nFor me Windows 7 detected the new partition and did a checkdisk on boot. It had a lot of (Index) cleaning to do. The buggy files were gone. And the problem solved.\n\nA: I got this after newly fomratting an SD card as ntfs, all I had to do what umount it first.\nsudo umount -l /dev/sdx1\n\nthen mount worked again\n", "Q: Is there any way to have several open terminal windows with different themes?

I have Ubuntu 11.10 installed and am using GNOME 3.2. I am left with no other option than to restart gdm or to reboot the system, when GNOME freezes.\nGNOME freezes at times when resuming from suspend and every time I search in the dashboard, inspite of having GNOME 3.2 compatible theme installed. \nIs there any option to restart shell from tty? Or is there any other solution to recover from the freeze?\n\nA: Typically when gnome-shell fails to respond you can do 1 of two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Alt+F2 and if you get a dialog for executing commands type restart\n\n*Ctrl+Alt+F2 to switch to terminal console 2 (tty2), login and try killing gnome-screensaver and/or restarting a replacement gnome-shell with: pkill gnome-screensaver switch back to tty7 ( Ctrl+Alt+F7) to check your Gnome screen, if not, go back to tty2 and gnome-shell --display :0.0 --replace & (which was suggested before by steve and msdin respectively)\n\n\nIf both fail, then you need to restart your display manager (gdm, lightdm, kdm). Typically: sudo service gdm restart\n\nA: I have been having a similar problem.  When screen saver / lock is supposed to engage, instead the screen freezes (showing what the screen was showing prior).  The mouse is enabled, but cannot see a login box.  I haven't tried what is suggested by msdin (typing password blind).  But the following did work for me, from Earl C Ruby III:\n\nTo unlock a locked-up desktop:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Ctrl-Alt-F1 will give you a text-based terminal login.\n  \n*Log in with your user name and password.\n  \n*Type: “killall gnome-screensaver”\n  \n*Ctrl-Alt-F7 to get back to the (now unlocked) Gnome 3 desktop.\n  \n\n\nA: Try switching to another tty (Ctrl-Alt-F1), login, then at the prompt type:\ngnome-shell --display :0 --replace\n\nThen switch back to the GUI (Ctrl-Alt-F7). \nAlso, are you sure its actually frozen? I have a problem where the password dialog isn't visible after the screen locks. Its actually there though and if you blind type your password and hit enter the screen unlocks. You might want to try that first.\n\nA: I've had a similar problem.  I'm not sure if the only workaround I've found will work for you but it's worth a try.\nI switch over to tty1 (Ctrl+Alt+F1) and log in which hopefully you can do.  If you can't even switch then your problem is worse than mine!  But assuming you make it that far I've found that putting the computer to sleep and bringing it back up again at least makes the computer responsive again.  It's really not an ideal solution.  But to do this\ncd /etc/acpi\nsudo ./sleep.sh\n\nAfter that just hit the power button to bring it back up.  If you switch back to your graphical terminal (Ctrl+Alt+F7) things might be responsive again.\nNot ideal but it's better than a full restart especially if you had important stuff not yet saved.\nI haven't yet found what is causing this otherwise there could be hope for a better solution.  Somebody in the thread I linked to suggested that gnome-screen-saver is causing the problems but killing it after a freeze didn't fix anything and killing it at the start of a session didn't prevent a freeze for me.\n", "Q: Cannot enable Shell Extensions for custom themes I've followed the steps posted here with intentions of installing a custom theme downloaded from the previous site.  \nWhen I get to the step:\n\nYou’ll now need to log out and back in for the extension to be ‘picked\n  up’ by the system, then enable the extension from the ‘Shell\n  Extensions’ tab in the ‘Advanced Settings/GNOME Tweak Tool’ app.\n\nI open GNOME Tweak Tool and navigate to the Shell Extensions tab but get the following:\nWhat am I doing wrong?

In particular, it's likely that your boot disk has multiple partitions, at least one that's NTFS for Windows and one that's ext2/3/4 for Ubuntu. \nWhen you boot Ubuntu, you won't see see (mount) the NTFS partition without some explicit actions (if I remember correctly). If you boot Windows, you can't mount an ext2/3/4 partition. \nSo, are you sure that you're mounting the NTFS partition? Try mount and fdisk -l.\nOnce you know you're mounting the right partition, then you must mount it read/write (rw).\n\nA: You should NOT hybernate Windows when switching to Ubuntu, but shutdown it completely.\nIn fact, Windows 7 restores the previous version of the files you have modified on the NTFS partition from Ubuntu when turning it on after hybernation/sleeping.\n", "Q: Reading OSX disk from Ubuntu: Permission Denied I have an OSX and Ubuntu dual-boot system.

This file is accessible directly from inside SciTE via the menu Options -> Open User Options. I find that an easy way of doing this is to open both the global properties and the user properties side by side and copying from the global file the properties that I want to change for my user.\nThe advantages of using the user properties file are threefold:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you ever migrate your user to a different machine by simply copying /home/user your changes will be preserved (the new machine will most likely have a fresh install of SciTE with an unmodified global properties file).\n\n*Changes to the global properties file will affect all users on the system, not just your user.\n\n*Future updates to SciTE could potentially overwrite your changes to the global properties file.\n\n\nA: This works:\ncaret.line.back=#FFFFFF\ncaret.line.back.alpha=0\n\nin User Options File or else.\n", "Q: My laptop display is just a black screen the external display works fine but my main display is just black i know it works beacuse it works fine in windows but it wont work in linux D: my laptop is a acer-aspire 5734z ive tryed reinstalling ubuntu and it still dosent work. help???\n\nA: There's a kernel bug that affects Acer laptops. Basically, the backlight isn't being turned on. You can read the bug report here.\nThe bug hasn't been fixed, but there's a workaround:\nIn short, the answer that worked for me was two-fold: first, place the following in /etc/rc.local:\nsetpci -s 00:02.0 F4.B=0\n\nThat should make the backlight turn on. You can run the command from the command line to test it, but from the command line, be sure to put sudo in front.\nThen, if the backlight doesn't come on after the computer goes into power-saving mode, put the command into root's crontab. Run sudo crontab -eu root and insert the following line:\n*/1 * * * /usr/bin/setpci -s 00:02.0 F4.B=0\n\nThis will cause the backlight to turn on no more than one minute after the computer resumes.\n", "Q: Lost Evolution Inbox During 11.10 upgrade I just upgraded to 11.10 and lost my inbox messages in Evolution.

I now have active email for all folder subscriptions.  WEIRD STUFF!!!\n\nA: @sadmicrowave have you checked for a folder /home/[myuser]/.evolution/mail/local/inbox?\nMight be stored under that directory (if not erased) as that is where 11.04 stored some of my old mail files and always backed up those copies prior to upgrade for re-import post-upgrade (just as a precaution and regular step of safe-keeping). Have been utilising Thunderbird as of late though, too lazy to do otherwise (my honest reason).\nSo, after seeing the comment below, this appears to be an issue that is misinterpreted. The problem appears to be that mistakenly, have thought that your issue was one of an upgrade loss of your inbox, whereas the issue is that youa re actually still receiving email, however, the emails are not showing within your inbox in Evolution.\nIf this is correct so far, then perhaps the issue is within a setting in your Server Settings for the email account itself.

It seems that Ubuntu 11.10, specifically Network Manager, does not change at all the frequency of the wlan-signal.\nOk, if it does change somehow, then: Which factors does the Network Manager take into account? \nDoes it take into account the humidity of the air?\nA few years ago the radio towers were made a lot more efficient by taking into an account the humidity of the air. It would be trivial to have humidity control measurers in my laptop either internally or preferably as an external body. It would definitely improve my internet connection's strength, since by increasing the signal frequency in the high humidity -conditions the frequency would be increased to the level that is allowed by the regional laws.\nWhich files do control the frequency of the given emitters?\n\nA: I rather thought the frequency depended on the access point's channel. If we assume that is correct (it may well not be) to change dynamically, you would need to interface with your router and have it change things.\nThis would probably lose you your connection.\nI wouldn't bother, to be honest.

I am trying to set up the ability for multiple users to use the Trash on a NTFS drive.\nThe main solution proposed on the forums consists into enabling a single user to use the Trash. That is made by adding the option uid=1000,gid=1000 into /etc/fstab.  \nExample fstab entry:\nUUID=0A046CF41C7164C6 /media/Data ntfs defaults,uid=1000,gid=1000 0 0\nBut this only allows the original user, with id=1000, to use the Trash. The other users do not have access to it.\nA proposed solution for multiple users is to inherit properties from windows. I tried this but I could not make it work.\nBut I then notice that this may not have anything to do with the way the NTFS drive is mounted:\n\n\n*\n\n*Deleting from Nautilus displays the message \"Impossible to move the file to Trash\"\n\n*Deleting from Dolphin displays... nothing. And the file is moved to Trash.\n\n\nBut I do not wish to use Dolphin.\nSo here is my question:\nWould it be possible to stop messing around with fstab and just configure Nautilus correctly? Or does anybody have a simple/working solution to solve this problem?\nNote: I am running Ubuntu 11.10 on a 64bits system.\nThanks a lot for your help!\nedit: And I notice too that Thunar, XFCE File Manager, can also put files to trash without any trouble. So what's up with Nautilus?\n\nA: From what is see in NTFS-3G page, under the section \"Allowing Group/User\" dmask entry may be the key.\nFrom that page-\nYou can also tell /etc/fstab (the NTFS-3G driver) other options like those who are allowed to access (read) the partition. For example, for you to allow people in the users group to have access:\n/dev/<NTFS-part>  /mnt/windows  ntfs-3g   gid=users,umask=0022    0       0\n\nBy default, the ntfs-3g driver enable write support for root only. To enable user writing, use the dmask parameter to enable user writing:\n/dev/<NTFS-part>  /mnt/windows  ntfs-3g   gid=users,fmask=113,dmask=002    0       0\n\n", "Q: How Do I Use a Photos Directory as my Screensaver?

I need to set up one of the accounts in my Xubuntu 11.10 machine as essentially a kiosk. I have set up the desktop and assigned only certain icons to the panel, and now I just want to lock the panel so that it can't be changed. (It would be even better if the panel could easily be changed with sudo rights when I need to change it over time.)\nIn the past I accomplished the same thing in Ubuntu using Pessulus, but I read that Pessulus does not work in Ubuntu 11.10 so I switched to Xubuntu with upgrade last week because I read that XFCE supports a kiosk mode. I had to upgrade because as far as I can tell it was the only way to resolve an unrelated hardware problem that I was experiencing with the printer.\nI tried turning on Kiosk mode as described here. I created file /etc/xdg/xdg-xubuntu/xfce4/kiosk/kioskrc with the following contents:\n[xfce4-panel]\nCustomizePanel=root\n\nIt seems that now the account in question can right click on the panel, add a launcher and use it, but when the account logs out and back in the launcher is no longer there. If this is the desired behavior of XFCE's kiosk mode then it is not what I am looking for. I need to prevent this account from being able to modify the panel. I guess it is possible that I did something wrong in trying to set up kisok mode.\nWorst case I guess I could disable right clicking for the user, but that solution seems like it might lead to trouble when I realize that some program needs right click to function properly. I researched the preventing right click option, but the only solution that I found here seemed to be a system wide solution, and I really need for the other two accounts on this machine to have right click functionality.\nI am sure that I am not the only person who wants to do this. I can think of many use cases for locking down the panels in Xubuntu. I have spent quite a while searching for a solution, but have not yet found one. I have used Ubuntu for five years now, but it has always just worked for me so I don't have much experience editing configuration files. Can you point me to a guide for what I am trying to accomplish?\n\nA: This link is about locking the panels, maybe this is what you're looking for:\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/easylinuxtipsproject/xubuntu#TOC-Safeguard-the-panels-kiosk-mode-\n\nCopy the panel settings in your home folder, to a systemwide folder.\n  The settings file is called xfce4-panel.xml.\nCopy and paste the following magical incantation into the terminal:\nsudo cp -v ~/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/xfce4-panel.xml /etc/xdg/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/\n\nNow open the settings file with text editor Leafpad. With the\n  following command line:\ngksudo leafpad /etc/xdg/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/xfce4-panel.xml\n\nAlmost at the top of the text in that text file you see the line:\n<channel name=\"xfce4-panel\" version=\"1.0\">\n\nDele that line and replace it by this line:\n<channel name=\"xfce4-panel\" version=\"1.0\" locked=\"*\" unlocked=\"root\">\n\nSave the modified text file.\nReboot your computer.\nThe panels are now in kiosk mode and can't be deleted or modified.\n\n", "Q: Where did my display configuration go?

However, the SSH server on the Ubuntu machine will try to find the matching public SSH key in the home directory of the login user only, i.e. 'otheruser' in your case, and you apparently haven't supplied the public SSH key in question there as well.\nYou can make this work by appending the public SSH key(s) of user 'root' (usually contained in /root/.ssh/authorized_keys) to those of user 'otheruser' (usually contained in /home/otheruser/.ssh/authorized_keys), i.e. in your case you can likely just copy the former to the latter.\nPlease note that in case your SSH server configuration has been hardened already, there might be additional adjustments needed to enable SSH access for 'otheruser' in the first place (e.g. appending 'otheruser' the AllowUsers directive within /etc/ssh/sshd_config), however, this would be unusual for any default AWS Ubuntu instance.\n", "Q: Altec Lansing iML 237 not Working in 11.10 I have an Altec Lansing iML 237 external USB that was working in 11.04, but does not in 11.10.

I have this question, is posible to change the default location for hidden personal config folders from /home/user to another location? I mean the folders .cache ..compiz-1 etc.\nThanks for answering.\n\nA: No, unfortunately, it's not possible yet. There is something called the XDG Base Directory Specification which makes certain types of directories configurable, including where apps store their data, where their configs are, etc. It says that configuration files should be placed in a directory specified by the variable $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS, which is $HOME/.config by default, but many applications doesn't use that yet. This is very annoying for many reasons. When they do, then it will be possible by simple changing that variable to something else, like $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS=/somewhereelse/.config. For now, it is not possible for things like compiz, but it is possible for many other things. \n\nA: The short answer is no. There are lots of programs that use this area as a default for writing config files. I just checked on my system and I have folders like .adobe, .dropbox, .libreoffice and .shotwell. Not to mention a huge number of program configs in .config.\nBasically, even if you managed to change the defaults for one application, there are more that would still write there. There's no global default for user config location.\n\nA: Actually there is a command usermod(8) that can change your home directory.  This will move all of your files, not just the dot files you listed above\nNEWDIR=/new/home/dir\nUSER=yourusername\nsudo usermod --move-home --home $NEWDIR $USER\n\nTry \"man usermod\" for more information.\nIf you wanted to just move certain directories, you could create (and maintain) symbolic links, something like this bash snippet:\nNEWDIR=/new/home/dir\nDIRSTOMOVE=\".adobe .cache .compiz ...\"\nfor d in $DIRSTOMOVE; do\n    mv $HOME/$d $NEWDIR && ln -s $NEWDIR/$d $HOME\ndone\n\n", "Q: How can I add wine programs to the right click context menu?

To prevent link rot, here's the important information (with a few additions).\nsudo apt-get install trash-cli\n\nThis will install trash, empty-trash, list-trash and restore-trash commands, which you can use as-is or make rm an alias of trash (see below).\nThe semantic of the trash command is a bit different then the standard rm - it doesn't require -r flag in order to be able to delete directories. If this bothers you, webupd8.org proposes the following script, which you can put in your PATH and call it trash-rm:\n#!/bin/bash\n# command name: trash-rm\nshopt -s extglob\nrecursive=1\ndeclare -a cmd\n((i = 0))\nfor f in \"$@\"; do\n    case \"$f\" in\n\n        (-*([fiIv])r*([fiIv])|-*([fiIv])R*([fiIv]))\n            tmp=\"${f//[rR]/}\"\n            if [ -n \"$tmp\" ]; then\n                #echo \"\\$tmp == $tmp\"\n                cmd[$i]=\"$tmp\"\n                ((i++))\n            fi\n            recursive=0\n        ;;\n\n        (--recursive) recursive=0\n        ;;\n\n        (*)\n            if [ $recursive != 0   -a  -d \"$f\" ]; then\n                echo \"skipping directory: $f\"\n                continue\n            else\n                cmd[$i]=\"$f\"\n                ((i++))\n            fi\n        ;;\n\n    esac\ndone\ntrash \"${cmd[@]}\"\n\nIn Ubuntu 12.04 and later, the last command in the script should be trash-put \"${cmd[@]}\" instead of trash \"${cmd[@]}\" (as the command has changed from trash to trash-put).\nThen make the script executable:\nchmod +x trash-rm\n\nOnce you have it in some directory in your PATH, add an alias to your ~/.bashrc, which will make bash to invoke your script instead of the actual rm command:\nalias rm=\"trash-rm\"\n\nAs djeikyb correctly points out, the .bashrc alias trick would only work for the user whose .bashrc is modified, and only in bash terminal session. \nAnd that should be it.\n\nA: libtrash (package libtrash in Ubuntu) seems to do this, but I've never used it.\n", "Q: How do I get rid of my Ubuntu One account?

After installation ubuntu only use the AMD graphic card, how to install and use only the intel graphic card ? \n\nA: Disable the ATI card in the BIOS, reboot, and the Intel one should be in use. Intel GPUs are usually soldered to the motherboard, so that you can't easily install or uninstall them (anyway, your's is already there).\n\nA: *\n\n*you can't disable the Graphics card in the Bios. \n\n*the Intel HD3000 is integrated in the CPU. Lets see how you uninstall it ;)\n\n\nI read somewhere that you have to install the catalyst drivers and then switch the GPU to Intel.

If someone calls me there is absolutely no sound at all. No \"someone is calling me\" sound. If I call someone I do hear the sound of calling (The cool skype calling sound). I went to the sound configuration in Skype and the Make a test sound button did not \"MAKE\" a sound.\nAm using 2.2.0.35 from Software Center.\n\nA: Found the problem. I normally deactivate the Alert Sound in Ubuntu since I like it to be silent. The problem is that for the incoming sound to \"sound\" you need to have Alert Volume without mute, preferably maxed.\n\nAfter unchecking the mute option it started sounding again.\nSo basically go to the Sound Setting and change that. It worked in my case. The problem now is telling Ubuntu with another option to disable all the animal sounds it makes when opening, closing windows and and starting Ubuntu or shutting it down.\n", "Q: Help getting TED working and having it integrated with dash/menu I have installed latest JDK 1.7.0_u1 using the method provided at this page  WebUpd8 \nNow i need help to get Torrent Episode Download Running ..

No problems, right gateway.\n\n*At some point after this, probably a few weeks, for some reason I used a GUI thing to mess around with networking settings. At this point, I mistakenly changed my gateway settings to the wrong router.\n\n\nThis is where it got weird. Either the computer or the wrong router had some sort of partial routing table or something, causing the initial problem.\nThe key command which ultimately sorted this for me:\nroute -n\n\nWhen learning about ip tables and that sort of thing, I came across that command. I ran it and saw the gateway was the wrong router.

It might be worth searching the MD RAID mailing list to see how this has progressed.\nSpeaking from experience, I am not a big fan of using DM for managing RAID sets, the tools are kinda cumbersome and basic admin tasks are a burden; and so is recovering a failed RAID. If you want to take the plunge I strongly recommend you model the setup in a VM so you can become accustomed with the toolset's ins and outs.

Synchronized folders in Home directory reported: This folder is backed up and will be synchronized with the other computer. No other computer on the net. refers probably to the previous installation of U10.11. \nHow can I get my Home folders synchronized?\n\nA: First Ubuntu One will not sync your home folders. It only syncs ~/Ubuntu One by default and will (optionally) sync other folders under your home folder. If you synced various folders (not talking about deja dup) with Ubuntu One they will not automatically sync when you reinstall your OS. You will need to select them using the Ubuntu One Control Panal.\nIf you are referring to Deja Dup's backup of your files, that application puts them in a special folder in Ubuntu One which does not sync (and I do not recommend you do).

One of the monitors is a USB touchscreen from Mimo with a displaylink chip. I already got it working as main display just by reconfiguring xorg.conf. Even the touch interface works.\nBut for multiseats, it's not just enough to change xorg.conf, because additional login screens have to be started too.

The -sharevts switch was the key. It is not added by default by Lightdm. I looked at /var/log/lightdm/lightdm.log and added a custom xserver-command option and now it finally works!

After looking at the kernel console code though, it appears that it was written with the assumption that there is only one console.  It uses global variables to multiplex the virtual consoles onto a single display, and reads keyboard input from all attached keyboards.\nIt looks like the Linux console code will need significantly refactored to support multi seat.\n", "Q: Is it possible to install Ubuntu 10.04 on ext3 instead of ext4? Is it possible to install Ubuntu 10.04 on ext3 instead of ext4?\nThis is because I want to use my backup program \"Acronis\" to save an image of the whole  partition.\n\nA: Yes it is possible just change it because ext4 is the default \nI think all Acronis product work with the follow file system for example Acronis® True Image™ Home 2012 but Acronis® Disk Director® 11 Home doesn't support ext4.\nWhy use Acronis when there's Clonezilla or G4l? Has many more features and is open source\nIf you’re a Linux user, you’ve likely been asked at some point if you want Ext3, Ext4, XFS, ReiserFS, Btrfs, or one of many other filesystem acronyms. This choice confuses new and old users alike, and like all software, the options change as technology improves. Many people probably don’t care what filesystem they use as long as it’s stable and reasonably fast, but how do you know which one that is? This guide will attempt to cover the basic differences between the most common options, and provide the pros and cons of each choice.\nExt2\nExt2 is Linux’s “old standby” filesystem. It was the default for most of the major early Linux distributions. While it has been mostly supplanted by versions 3 and 4, ext2 is still popular on USB and other solid-state devices. This is because it does not have a journaling function, so it generally makes fewer reads and writes to the drive, effectively extending the life of the device.\nRecommended Use: USB/Solid State Drives, or any cause where you need high stability with minimal reads/writes.\nExt3\nThe most notable difference between ext2 and ext3 was the introduction of journaling. In short, journaling filesystems are meant to recover more gracefully in the event of a system crash. Whenever you find yourself in doubt about which filesystem to use for Linux, ext3 is nearly always a good bet. It’s extremely mature, extremely well supported, and contains all the features you’re likely to need for a desktop OS.\nRecommended Use: If you have no specific reason for another filesystem, ext3 is an excellent default.\nExt4\nThe most recent in the ext filesystem line, ext4 includes many major improvements over ext3 like larger filesystem support, faster checking, nanosecond timestamps, and verification of the journal through checksums. It’s backward and forward compatible with versions 2 and 3, so you can mount a ext2 or ext3 filesystem as ext4, and the other way around. You may however lose some of the benefits of the newer versions when mounting as the older. Many of the modern Linux distributions now offer ext4 during the install, and some are using it as the default.\nRecommended Use: Ext4 should be stable enough for desktop and server needs. If your distribution offers it as an install choice, it should be a good choice for nearly any usage needs.\nReiserFS (Reiser3)\nBefore ext3, ReiserFS was the only journaling filesystem for Linux. It’s also notable for allowing live resizing of the filesystem. In some cases where many small files are involved, Reiserfs can outperform ext3 by a considerable margin. Reiser3 has problems, however when it comes to handling things like multicore PCs, as the design only allows for some operations to run one at a time.\nRecommended Use: Interacting with small files on a single core system.\nReiser4\nReiser4 is intended to solve some of the problems with the Reiser3 implementation. Performance has improved, particularly with small files, and it includes support for plugins to handle things like compression and encryption. Reiser4 has a somewhat uncertain future. It has not yet been accepted into the main line Linux kernel, the lead designer is in prison, and the company developing it is not currently in business. Reiser4, if completed and fully polished, could be a fast and useful filesystem, but until it gains a foothold in the mainline kernel it may not be a good choice for long term use.\nRecommended Use: Filesystem testing and development\nXFS\nXFS is packed full of cool features like guaranteed rate I/O, online resizing, built-in quota enforcement, and it can theoretically support filesystems up to 8 exabytes in size. It’s been used on Linux since about 2001, and is available as an install option on many popular Linux distributions. With variable block sizes, you can tune your system like a sliding scale to tweak for space efficiency or read performance.\nRecommended Use: If you really like to tweak your system to meet your needs, XFS is a great way to go.\nBtrfs\nBtrfs  Some of the interesting features include transparent compression, snapshots, cloning, and in-place conversion (with rollback) from ext3 and 4. According to the lead developer, Btrfs aims to “let Linux scale for the storage that will be available.” Btrfs, once completed and matured, will likely be a strong contender in the Linux filesystem world on both desktops and servers.\n\nA: On this site https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LucidLynx/ReleaseNotes you can see that ext3 even may improve your system performance.

If you like it and it works then save any data you need from Meego  (passwords, docs music photos etc) on the pen drive in a new folder and then reboot it and select install and follow the prompts only remembering to select use entire drive or replace current Linux installation.\nThis will replace your Meego with Ubuntu. Then you can load all your data back on. When installed you may have to sort your settings for a while but I am sure it will work like clockwork.\nLet us know how you get on.

An 'R' equates to 4, an 'W' to 2 and e(X)ecute to 1. The standard permissions in a directory equate to 755, which evaluates to read, write, execute for the owner (4 + 2 + 1), read and execute for the group (4 + 1) and read and execute for other. There are other permissions that might be assigned such as the sticky bit etc, but I won't go into them. To set the permissions you could just use a chmod 755 * in the directory. If there are hidden files, those starting with a period, you could try chmod 755 .*\nAlan\n", "Q: How to make sure that gcc, binutils, make and the kernel source are installed?

I'm developing a web app that will be able to access user's file on Ubuntu One.\nSites like GitHub, Twitter, Facebook, when an app request access to the user profile usually open a popup asking if you want to give the app the access while in this page  about Ubuntu One API is written that I need to make a GET request with some parameters like email and password: so the user give the application not only the access but also the app can store user password which is not very secure... am I right or is there the possibility of a popup?\n\nA: That API is intended for creating desktop applications using the native widget set, rather than in-browser applications or integrating with a different site. For the latter you can do standard oauth; the user authorization url is https://one.ubuntu.com/oauth/authorize/ (you can add a description via the query), the request URL is .../request/, and access token is .../access/.\n\nA: Currently Ubuntu One does not provide a way for three legged OAuth to grant third party applications to gain access to it's APIs. Your question has inspired me to file a bug (really a wish list) since it seems we are so close.\nNote (and do not do this) that it is possible for your web site to collect the user's credentials to the SSO locally and then do some http requests to authenticate the user and handle the oauth dance.

I would like to start development for Ubuntu, how to get started?\n\nA: The best place to get started is the new Ubuntu Developer Portal: http://developer.ubuntu.com\nYou can use a variety of IDEs (some may even be familiar), such as CodeBlocks, Netbeans and Eclipse. It will all boil down to choice, if you ask me. Installing an IDE is pretty easy too: Just open the Software Center and search for the one you want or browse the development category.\nIf you already know how to code in the languages you mentioned, then the main difference you will find on Ubuntu will be in compilation. Even so, it's easy to adjust, especially when letting the IDE do most of the \"dirty work\" for you.\n\nA: Ubuntu does not have a special framework like Window's .NET or Win32 API. The somewhat special to Linux is the POSIX enviroment, this provides IPC, shared memory, threads and \nsuch. \nOr did you mean GUI? Gnome is written using GTK+ und KDE using Qt.

A few months back when I buggered up my netbook and then booted into it to get information from it using a live USB. (Thinking that was 10.10) \nWhen I was copy/pasting this to another USB at no time was I required to enter my user name or password to access this information. Why and how was that possible? Shouldn't that not be possible? This was information from the 'home' including documents, pictures, music, videos and some other locations.\nThis does not sound secure at all, is there any way that I can ensure this cannot happen again and that user name and password would be required to access information on my installed Ubuntu computer when booting on that computer from a live USB/CD/DVD?\n\nA: This is possible because your files are on the hard disk, so anyone with full control over whatever operating system is running on the computer has full control (including full access) to your files. This is the case when running Ubuntu or another OS from a live system (live CD/DVD or live USB), and this is also the case if someone were to take the hard drive out of your computer and put it in their computer.\nYou can get a reasonable degree of protection from this by encrypting your home folder, making sure to only store your files in your home folder (of course back them up somewhere else besides this computer, though...and make sure the backup is secure), and using a very strong password. The password is stored, encrypted, on the hard disk, so if it's weak, the encryption can be cracked pretty easily. See this comic for a relatively accessible explanation of some of the issues relevant to password choice.\nEncrypting your home folder is an option during installation, but you can also enable it on an already-installed system by following the instructions in this guide. It is recommended to encrypt your swap partition too, which that guide also explains.\nThe reason most users do not encrypt their home folders (besides not knowing that it is an option or not being extremely concerned about the privacy of their data) is that, often, the person trying to access your files without your password is you. This also complicates (but does not usually prevent) recovering data from the disk, even if it is mostly intact and you remember the password.\nIf you want to increase your protection, make sure the password you use for your Ubuntu system is not the same as or even similar to the password you use for anything else, such as any websites.\n\nA: \nNo user name/password required when exploring from live USB\nWhy and how was that possible? Shouldn't that not be possible?\n\nWell, you are using the OS (Ubuntu) from the live USB not OS from your installation\n\nThis does not sound secure at all, is there any way that I can ensure this cannot happen again and that user name and password would be required to access information on my installed Ubuntu computer when booting on that computer from a live USB\n\nYou could encrypt you data:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedFilesystems\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/System_Encryption_with_LUKS\n\nWhy Use Encryption?\n\nIn the simplest terms encryption is a method for establishing privacy.\n", "Q: How to share a folder with a host machine? Using VMWare, I am running Kubuntu as a Guest OS on top of a Windows OS.\nI have tried installing the VMWare tools but it fails to initialise the guest OS system daemon.

Any help on how to share my files between my windows host OS and Linux guest OS will be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Use samba in your guest OS and share them in your network, follow guides online to make it secure and if you just want to copy files from guest to host then make them read only.  That way it's only available when your guest vm is on and even then it's read-only.\nI have had no problems drag and dropping files between guest and host OS with Linux as a guest and Windows as host.  The only issue I have had is using a KDE linux distro as a host since they dont account for plasma and as such it never puts the file where I want it, but I figured out that the file gets transfered to a tmp folder and now I just have a link to that folder in my desktop widget.  I don't remember having that same issue with it as a guest on a windows host though.\nWhen files are dragged and dropped with a Kubuntu host/guest they go into a temp folder: /tmp/VMwareDnD/ so you could search there if they don't show up where you dragged them to.\n", "Q: How do I get my ATI 6670 graphics card to work?

I want to limit administrative tasks, so users cannot mess up the system. My idea was to install Ubuntu, set up automatic login, and hand it to the users without them knowing the password. However, I now need to disable automatic  login, and let the users lock their screen too, but if I give them the password for these task, they will also be able to manage the system.\nSo, is there any way to set different passwords for administrative tasks (updates, installations, sudo) and session tasks (login, lock screen, etc)?\n\nA: Only users that have an \"Administrator\" account can use sudo, other users can't.  By default only the first user (created during install) has \"Administrator\" rights.  You can also change the account type at any time using the configuration panel for user accounts (but of course only a user with an \"Administrator\" account can change it ;) ).\nTechnical implementation detail: Ubuntu uses membership of the usergroup admin to determine if a user has \"administrator rights\".\n\nA: Remove your users from the admin group. Give them their passwords. They will be able to login and lock their screens, but will not be able to modify the system through updates or installing system-wide programs.\nThe following shell excerpt removes the user djeikyb from the admin group.\nid shows information about a user.

Is there a way to find out if the .deb is the exact same one?\nOn rpm based systems I would do the following\nold-server$ rpm -qi foo\n\nnew-server$ rpm -qi -p foo-1.2.3.rpm\n\nand compare the size, build date, build host and if they match, then I know I have the exact rpm I need.\nIs there an equivalent way of doing this on dpkg based systems?\nI see that dpkg-query can return an MD5 of some data, but the manual page says it's related to dselect and I'm unable to get any data from it.\n\nA: You could do a dpkg -l <packagename> and see if the package is installed and what version it is. This may not work if you don't have some sort of guidelines for version numbers and such (eg. when making changes to the code and releasing/installing, you should bump the version number)\n\nA: I guess comparing the installed files on the system with the files inside the package should give you a good idea?  You can extract files from a *.deb with dpkg -x <deb-filename> <directory-to-extract-in> and you can list all files installed by an installed package with dpkg -L <package-name>.\nWhen you have this info, you should be able to compare filenames, file dates, checksums, or whatever you want...\n", "Q: How do I remove the application title from global application menu?

How can I configure vim to display hidden characters like tabs or spaces ONLY while those characters are typed? I do not want tabs and/or space replaced with special characters like \">\" or \"_\" when the file is written.\n\nA: More recent versions of vim can show spaces as well. (Confirmed on vim 7.4.1689).\n:set list\n:set listchars=tab:→\\ ,space:·,nbsp:␣,trail:•,eol:¶,precedes:«,extends:»\n\n\nA: In my case I had to fight nbsp,\n:set listchars=nbsp:☠,tab:▸␣\n:set list\n\nYou can also use ␣ instead of ☠\nHere is an example where the above vim config highlights the \"invisible weird\" spaces and additionally it highlights tabs (red color because I am using trailing-whitespace vim plugin) \n\n\nA: You can use the commands\n:set listchars=eol:$,tab:>-,trail:~,extends:>,precedes:<\n:set list\n\nto show all characters that aren't whitespace. So spaces are the only thing that doesn't show up.\nIf you absolutely need spaces to be marked as well, you'll need to try something less nice. Something like\n:%s/ /█/g\n\nWill replace all spaces with a block character. Then you'd need to undo it before writing. You could remap your write command do\ncmap :w :%s/█/ /g<CR>:w\n\nJust a suggestion. I haven't tried that though.\n\nA: In vim just type search pattern and then scan with n or N.

Then if there is a need, I would drag it to the secondary monitor. Is there a way to do it?\nI am using xfce and gnome, and I have 2 seperate X Sessions.\n\nA: With 2 separate X servers that is (until I am proven wrong) not possible. If you want to drag windows between screen you will have to use twin-view or you will need to choose the x-server where your application will open before you do so.\nThe reason for that would be that the application would need to un-glue itself from a display, and from it's own window manager, leaving being only peaces of its shatered shadow, then the recreate itself and the core of the application re-attached to the new window manager you want it to go to, then a new window would need to be created around the application using the new window manager... Its like, no, it will do that for you.\nThere is however an application that can sort of do that for you called xpra. What it does is not remove the application from the original x server an recreate it on the new one but it will make it so that the application running on the original X server is displayed on the other X server.

After waking up from sleep it takes normally 30 seconds to be reconnected to my WLAN. Using the command \nsudo iwlist scanning \nthe reconnection process starts immediately. I wrote a script\necho $Password | sudo -S $iwlist scanning \nand start it via a starter from the desktop, thus reducing the time to 15 sec.\nIs there a way to start the script automatically and preventing the terminal from popping up.\n\nA: First, have a look at how your computer suspends/resumes. According to that you might adapt your script and put it into /etc/pm/sleep.d. The script should look like\n#!/bin/sh\ncase \"${i}\" in\n  resume)\n  $DO_SOMETHING\n  ;;\nesac\n\nA second (and better) possibility is to modify /usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d. There are some scripts, important are 55NetworkManager and 60_wpa_supplicant. The numbers 55 and 60 are a kind of priority. The lower the number the earlier the suspend script is executed. At resume the scripts are run in reverse order.\nSo I would suggest copying the scripts from /usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d to /etc/pm/sleep.d/ and play around with the first number. Maybe there are some dependencies on your system. You will have to find out through some experimenting. \n", "Q: How to package an application that contains a binary that needs to be in $PATH? I am packaging an application that contains binaries that would normally go in /usr/bin and a shared library that would go in /usr/lib.\nHowever, the package guidelines for submitting applications to the software center suggest that binaries should go into /opt.\nWhat is the proper way of putting these files into /opt yet making sure they are in the $PATH?\n\nFor clarification, the page I'm referring to is here: http://developer.ubuntu.com/publish/my-apps-packages/ and it states:\n\n\"Be able to be installed into /opt/....\"\n\n\nA: Packages that are submitted for extras.ubuntu.com cannot install binaries that are intended to be accessible from the default $PATH - they are meant to be relatively lightweight GUI applications. This excludes installing Upstart services or other files into /etc.\nThe restrictions on files were made for security reasons when the ARB process was written up.\nFor applications such as these, you can still submit them to the Ubuntu archive (main, universe) & request a backport to the stable release.\n\nA: Background\nCould you give more information - \"the package guidelines suggest that binaries should go into /opt\" ?\nI think that the Debian and the Debian based don't use the /opt directory.

To find the partition you want to re-label, you first have to find the disk drive that contains it, using the drop-down menu in the upper right. It will show a device name like /dev/sdb and the drive's total size in parentheses. After selecting a drive, you will see a list of all partitions on that drive.\n\n*If the partition is mounted (has a key icon next to it), right-click on the partition and select Unmount.\n\n*With the key icon gone, right-click on the partition and select Label. If you can't select it, install the ntfsprogs package.\n\n*Enter the new partition name and press Ok.\n\n*The label change is now pending, but has not been completed. Press the Apply button near the top of the window. After confirming, it should say \"All operations successfully completed\". The drive now has a new label. \n\nA: If your disk uses NTFS then you can rename it with\nsudo ntfslabel /dev/sdc1 New_disk_name\n\n(Replace 'sdc1' with the folder your disk is using.)\n\nA: The \"Disk Utility\" tool that ships with most Ubuntu installations lets you change volume labels quite easily.\nAs with any disk operation, I would recommend performing a backup of the device first :-)\nThere is a duplicated question, see more here\n", "Q: Webex and its desktop share feature on 11.10? Any experiences with Webex and its desktop share feature on Ubuntu 11.10?\nOn Ubuntu 10.10 it works fine with Oracle/Sun Java and Sun Java Plugin. On 11.04, Webex does work, but not the desktop share part.\nCan anyone confirm its behavior on 11.10?\n\nA: webex says that Ubuntu 11 is not supported. So, you gonna experience many weird sad bugs... the most annoying one is the fact that after a while the sound stops for Ubunters 11. To get it back working again you've got to block/unblock the talker's microphone. \nWell i gave up after some talks with Webex support. sad sad sad...\n", "Q: How can I disable the sharing of one mouse between several X ServerLayouts? I run a two-seat setup of Ubuntu 11.10. It is achieved via two ServerLayout sections inside of xorg.conf. The movements of the mouse belonging to seat 1 should not be visible on seat 2, but they are. But no matter which xorg.conf configuration I tried (and I researched and experimented relentlessly for six hours now), I cannot prevent this.\nI placed my hopes into the \"void\" input driver. At various places in the internet it is suggested that /dev/input/mice should be disabled, and one specific mouse device node used instead. I did the following, but no success:\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n    Identifier \"dummy\"\n    Driver     \"void\"\n    Option     \"Device\" \"/dev/input/mice\"\n    Option     \"CorePointer\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n        Identifier  \"Mouse0\"\n        Driver      \"mouse\"\n        Option      \"Device\" \"/dev/input/mouse0\"\nEndSection\n\nEven if I add only InputDevice \"dummy\" into a ServerLayout section (instead of Mouse0), the mouse is still functional. I even added Option \"CorePointer\" to the dummy InputDevice, but still the mouse works.\nI've noticed a similar thing with the keyboard. If the driver \"kbd\" is used, the input seems to be shared across several X ServerLayouts. If I use \"evdev\" instead, it only is applied to the current ServerLayout.\nI also don't understand the concept of a \"CorePointer\" clearly. Is it a mouse pointer that is shared across all server instances?\nI feel I've exhausted all available forum threads and man pages on this.\n\nA: There were additional X configuration files in /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d which interfered with the configuration in xorg.conf. I removed these files and commented out the interfering parts. It now works.\n", "Q: Windows 7 can't be loaded after installing Ubuntu 11.10 I use a MacBook Pro 8,2.

Everyone's suggestion in response to this problem is to get the right legacy nVidia card.  Easier said than done.  I had a really hard time tracking down the right driver, since it seemed to have disappeared from repositories (at least Ubuntu's).  Here's what worked for me.  Depending on your nVidia card, you might need to download a different file, but they're all listed at http://www.nvidia.com/object/unix.html.  I needed the legacy 96xx driver for my GeForce 2 MX 400.  So, after weeks of trying to fix this, I just ran these commands and it finally worked!  The URL used in the wget command is just the URL of the file that the nVidia website wanted me to download.\nwget http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/96.43.23/NVIDIA-Linux-x86-96.43.23-pkg1.run\nsudo sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86-96.43.23-pkg1.run\nsudo reboot\n\n\nA: Run a terminal and enter cat /etc/X11/default-display-manager. Probably says lightdm if you recently uninstalled GDM. /etc/init/lightdm.conf doesn't accept lightdm as a setting - however, /usr/bin/lightdm or /usr/sbin/lightdm work. So open /etc/X11/default-display-manager in your favorite text editor and replace whatever is there with the following line:\n/usr/bin/lightdm\nor\n/usr/sbin/lightdm\nReboot and lightdm should start and bring you to the logon screen as usual.\n\nA: My solution was to run:\nrm /etc/systemd/system/default.target\nsystemctl set-default graphical.target\n\nThis will replace the default target file, which in my case must have prevented systemd from reaching the graphical target, with a symlink to the graphical target. After this, lightdm (and gdm when selected with dpkg-reconfigure) starts automatically.\n/etc/X11/default-display-manager was already set to the correct value so this appears to be a different root cause from OP's.\nMore information on systemd targets here.\n\nA: It happens for me when removing gnome apps including gdm,and moving to kde. \nI fixed it by running:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm\n\nand choosing kdm as default instead of lightdm\n\nA: In my case, I have to reinstall ubuntu-desktop to get it to work again.\nsudo apt install xorg\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\n\n\nA: If the system seems not to boot up, you can try switch tty with CTRL+FX Buttons, with X being a number from 1 to 7. Usually, the lightdm does not start completely, but systemd is able to start all services needed, as their own login manager. Changing tty will let you purge and reinstall the login manager packages and let your distribuition configure It to you automatically.  On Ubuntu after the tty change:\n\nsudo apt-get purge lightdm && sudo apt-get install lightdm\n\n", "Q: 403 Forbidden problem with Apache Strange, I have change folder users/groups to www-data (sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /datos/www) and also have changed permission to 755 (sudo chmod -R 755 /datos/www), but still getting 403 Forbidden problem with Apache.

Is there a version of MS-DOS that I can add to Ubuntu? I have old MS-DOS games.\n\nA: You can try either DOSBox or DOSEMU. Both are available from the repositories - use Ubuntu Software Center or synaptic (if installed) to get them. DOSBox is specifically intended to run games, but I've also used DOSEMU to run DOS games successfully. \n\nA: You can run FreeDOS, a free software implementation of DOS inside a virtual machine such as VirtualBox or KVM/QEMU.\n\nA: I would recommend taking a look at ScummVM if you have any point 'n' click adventure games.\nFrom the ScummVM site:\n\nScummVM supports many adventure games, including LucasArts SCUMM games\n  (such as Monkey Island 1-3, Day of the Tentacle, Sam & Max, ...), many\n  of Sierra's AGI and SCI games (such as King's Quest 1-6, Space Quest\n  1-5, ...), Discworld 1 and 2, Simon the Sorcerer 1 and 2, Beneath A\n  Steel Sky, Lure of the Temptress, Broken Sword 1 and 2, Flight of the\n  Amazon Queen, Gobliiins 1-3, The Legend of Kyrandia 1-3, many of\n  Humongous Entertainment's children's SCUMM games (including Freddi\n  Fish and Putt Putt games) and many more.\n\n\nA: emu2 is a simple text-mode DOS emulator that is lighter weight than DOSBox.\nI do not know what versions of DOS are supported, including if anything specific to MS-DOS is supported.\n\nA: I use VirtualBox to run old DOS apps.

I have a printer that is being used for two purposes: \n\n\n*\n\n*Printing of regular documents (Word, Internet pages, etc)\n\n*Direct printing from the command line (done by echo \"text\" > /dev/usb/lp0)\n\n\nThis all worked fine in a previous version of Ubuntu. However, recently we upgraded to 11.10 and encountered a problem. First of all, the printers are not added to /dev/usb anymore. So I can not echo to this path, and am unable to achieve printing from the command line. \nAfter some hassle, I was able to find a workaround. This workaround was editing /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-cup-usblp.conf. This file reads:\n# cups talks to the raw USB devices, so we need to blacklist usblp to avoid\n# grabbing them\nblacklist usblp\n\nAfter commenting this blacklisting, the device appears properly in /dev/usb, as lp0. I had a problem with the permissions of lp0, but this was solved by the answer from Luis Felipe Barrera Mora. \nHowever, I now have one major issue to resolve. After I commenting the blacklisting, the printer stopped working when printing from Word documents. This is logical, because I disable something that CUPS needs. So basically I now only have the option to either enable regular CUPS printing and no command line printing, or I have command line printing and no CUPS printing. \nUPDATE\nFor completeness: I in fact have two printers connected at the same time. One is used to print both using CUPS and the command line. The other one - an Epson receipt printer - is only used for command line printing. I've spent many days trying to get it running using CUPS but this was not possible. However, this means that the lpr command will not solve the problem, because I can not get this second printer to function under CUPS. I really need to be both able to access /etc/dev/lp0 (or a similar path) AND print using CUPS at the same time. \n\nA: I have the same problem, if you always add permissions to the file lp0, you must edit the printer rules:\n$ gksudo gedit /lib/udev/rules.d/70-printers.rules\n\nadd [, MODE=\"0666\"]\nThe file contains:\nACTION==\"add\", ... KERNELL=\"lp*\" ... , MODE=\"0666\"\n\n\nA: Why don't you use lpr to print form the command line? Like:\necho \"text\" > /tmp/someFileName\nlpr -P YourPrinter /tmp/someFileName\n\nIt's a workaround, but should be an easy way to do what you want without changing some permissions... \n\nA: Open a web browser to http://localhost:631/ to configure CUPS. You should be able to print from the command line via echo \"text\" | lpr. Use lpstat -t to see all of CUPS' status information, lpstat -d to see the system's default printing destination, man lpstat for more, man lpr for specifying which printer.\nAll printing should go via CUPS - it manages queues, printers, ... \n\nA: You could try adding it as a \"Raw\" printer in CUPS. I'm not sure if it works, but it's worth a try.\nYou'll have to re-blacklist usblp for this. Add the Epson to CUPS, select \"Generic\" as manufacturer and \"Raw Queue\" as device. Additionally you might have to use lpr -o raw filename to print something.\n\nA: I am facing something similar.  What I have opted to do is to ensure that the only the receipt printer is connecting over USB (the general purpose printer will connect over a network interface).  This allows me to remove the blacklisting, print directly to the device, and use CUPS for the network printer.\nThis isn't really optimal.  It would be really nice to be able to connect all devices through USB and then select which ones we didn't want usblp to grab.  However, in the mean time, this seems to be the best option.  It may not be what you want to hear, but it is the only way I have found out.\nNow for general readers the reason why receipt printers are not usually connected to through CUPS is that in retail environments is that here speed is of the essence, and concurrency not a factor.  You don't need printer management, queue management, and the like.  What you really need is that when it prints, it prints right away.  Not in a few seconds, but right away.  Every few seconds you can shave off the workflow is seconds that each person in line is not waiting.  Multiply by line length, and you see the problem.  Hence performance every step of the way is critically important and since you typically have one receipt printer, and it is usually printing only for the point of sale application, CUPS costs far more than it offers.\nThis is not to say there aren't environments where you'd set it up through CUPS.  Restaurants tend to have similar printers in their kitchens and the concurrency issues there are significant, so you'd use CUPS there.  However it is not always the best tool for the job and retail receipt printers do not follow the same assumptions that CUPS follows.\n", "Q: Monitor will not be detected, stuck at 640x480 \nPossible Duplicate:\nGetting screen resolution correct with nvidia drivers \n\nI'm completely new to Linux but know the basics of command entry.

on my new machine (with an ASUS M5A99X EVO motherboard and on-board gigabit ethernet), and I asked it to download updates while it installed. The install took forever, the longest part being the download of updates, which should have been my first clue. Post install, accessing the internet is sketchy at best, but mostly just broken. The adapter consistently fails to pull down down an ip address or the DNS addresses from my router. \nI should also note that I know this isn't a hardware problem, because I can boot into Windows 7 (dual boot), and the ethernet works just fine. Actually, blazing fast might be a better word.  But there are many things (primarily software development) that I need to do in Ubuntu instead of Windows. \nI feel that it is a driver issue, but I don't even know where to start, since I've always just relied on Ubuntu to install the correct driver automatically for me. Why would the driver be wrong, and what should I do about it? \n\nA: I googled the problem as Yongchao describe it and found these instructions.  However, the RTL8168B driver from Realtek is only for linux 2.6, and would require a patch for linux 3.0 (which ships with Oneiric).\nHowever, the same search pulled up this bug report, which suggested installing the following \"backport\" module to update the r8169 driver to work correctly.  My steps were as follows:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:leannogasawara/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-net-`uname -r`\n\nAnd then reboot.\nOnce the machine rebooted, the internet poured in like liquid gold.  Thanks to Yongchao Liu for pointing me in the right direction!\n\nA: if you search the internet a bit, there is a reason why this is failing. If you do \nlspci in the shell. you might see your network interface card is using 8168B. However, if you lsmod, you can see the system load the r8169 driver which is not the correct one.\nJust google how to change the r8169 driver back to r8168 and blacklist the r8169. I have the same issue before. But it can be solved.\n", "Q: What should my MAC address be? (now shows 00:00:00:00:00:00) I have three computers all wired into my router.  The box I'm posting this from is running Ubuntu 11.10, and another machine is running Xubuntu 11.10   Both connected automatically when the ethernet cable was plugged in.  However, my wife's computer, running Ubuntu 10.10, cannot connect to the eth0 connection.  I checked the connection's properties and the MAC address is all zeroes!  How do I determine what numbers to plug into the MAC Address field?\n\nA: Try this from a terminal:\nifconfig\n\nYour MAC address is the one after HWaddr.\nIf it is 00:00:00:00:00:00 I think something is wrong with either the hardware or the driver.\nIf you somehow erased your MAC-address from the network settings you can get it back by writing this in the terminal:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo lshw > lshw.txt\n\n*write password when prompted for it\nthis takes approximately 20 seconds.\n\n*gedit lshw.txt\nNow you are looking at a list of all your hardware. But we only want the networking specs. Do a search for \"network\". A couple of lines under that line, there should be a line like this: \nserial: 01:21:ee:de:01:11\n\nOnly your numbers will be different. This is the MAC-address. Copy that address, and paste it into the network settings. Then you should have restored your original MAC-address.\n\nA: First, open 'System settings'. Then select 'Network', and then you will be able to get it by copying what is after 'Hardware address'. Hope it helped you.\n\n", "Q: How do I set SQLite data browser as the default application for .sqlite3 files? When I try to open a .sqlite3 file, I get the following error:\nThere is no application installed for SQLite3 database files\n\nWhen trying to select a default application, the SQLite database browser is not listed, despite it being installed.\nAlso, because the .sqlite3 file does not have a default application, it does not show up in the File Browser within gedit, making things pretty confusing.\nHow do I set up the default application?\nI am running Ubuntu 11.10.\n\nA: As mention by Bruno Pereira in a comment on your question you need to create an application launcher for SQlite Database Browser.\nTo do this open a text editor such as Gedit and create a text document with the following contents:\n[Desktop Entry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nName=SQLite Database Browser\nComment=Create, Edit and Modify SQLite database files\nExec=sqlitebrowser %u\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nStartupNotify=true\nMimeType=text/plain;\nNoDisplay=true\n\nOnce you have done this name the file sqlitebrowser.desktop and save the file to ~/.local/share/applications\nOnce you have done this navigate to a .sqlite3 and right click on it, select Open with Other Application\n\nThen select Show other applications and scroll down to select SQlite database Browser from the list and it'll now be the default application to open .sqlite files.\n\nA: I just got this to work on 13.04 but I had to use NoDisplay=false. \n[Desktop Entry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nName=SQLite Database Browser\nComment=Create, Edit and Modify SQLite database files\nExec=sqlitebrowser %u\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nStartupNotify=true\nMimeType=text/plain;\nNoDisplay=false\n\nThis will add to \"right click > open with\" and \"properties > open with\"\n", "Q: What P.C setup is guaranteed to work with ubuntu? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhich computers are guaranteed to work? \n\nWould that be the most common branded p.c and if so what model\nI have a custom built P.C which has a 64 bit Gigabyte motherboard, and intel dualcore 2.5ghz processor and nvidia gforce 9400 card. So far I have managed to get 9.10 to install but have to use distro upgrade to get later versions. And 11.10 wont boot normally, I get a screen full stuff ending in checking battery state. The only way I can get that to work is to select previos versions then the first option in the grub. The main annoyance with 11.10 on my pc is startup manager cant be set, so it will always boot into error message as that is default.

They are locked, a lock icon appears on a corner and the original error message shows again.\nIs there a graphical/easy way to set file permissions back to normal?\nI've read about chmod fchmod and chown and I would like to avoid them if possible. If there's no choice, can any of you please give me a quick example on how to use it?\nThank you so much Ub. Community!\n\nA: To chmod on many files at a time just use the -R thingy to do it recursively(subfolders, files etc).\nSo if I am in folder /myfolder and I want to make all files/subfiles/folders/subfolders in there to belong to me and have all accesses I would do:\nchmod -R 770 *\nchown -R myname:myname *\n\nSo just replace myname with your name in Ubuntu. You don't need to change anything in the first one.\n\nA: Right-click on the file, select 'Properties' in the context menu, then chose the 'Permissions' tab. This allows you to set permissions within Nautilus.\nIf you run Nautilus as superuser (sudo nautilus) then you can also change owner of the file.\n\nA: No click and point method springs to mind. Here's the command line method (type these in to a terminal):\n# set up some variables: userid to hold the UID and group to hold the GID\nuserid=$(id -u)\ngroup=$(id -g)\nsudo chown ${userid}:${group} <file> ...\nchmod 600 <file> ...\n\nThis code first grabs your userid and group (see man id), then changes the file(s) ownership(s) to you (see man chown). This has to be done as root (see man sudo) because we don't know the current ownership. Then, when the files(s) belong to you, we change the permissions to Owner:read/write,Group:,Other:. If the  is a directory (folder) change the last line to\nchmod 700 <file> ...\n\n", "Q: Howto set up only BG color of window, not all child widgets I need change only background colour of window, and keep widgets in system colours.\nThe space between boxes should keep different colour\nhttp://ubuntuone.com/756mWfF2hTYwgiGCOccmEz\nSomething like this\nhttp://ubuntuone.com/3jCDQHtSt6KJfbYQ6YMH7F\nI don't know if clutter is here better way to make it look this way\n\nA: You have not specified the programming language, so I assume Python for simplicity reasons. \nIn gtk, most components can connect to an expose event which can then be used to draw manually into the widget (cairo is used for this, all those widgets have a cairo context attached to them)\nHere is a simple example of a window with a custom colored Vbox and two buttons, the space between the bottons (here set to 20 pixels) and the small border around the buttons shows the background color of the VBox.\nimport gtk\n\n\nclass MyColoredBox(gtk.VBox):\n    def __init__(self, homogeneous=False, spacing=0):\n        super(MyColoredBox, self).__init__(homogeneous, spacing)\n        self.connect(\"expose-event\", self.expose)\n\n    def expose(self, widget, event):\n        cr = widget.window.cairo_create()\n        cr.set_source_rgb(1.0, 1.0, 0.5)\n        cr.rectangle(event.area.x, event.area.y,\n                     event.area.width, event.area.height)\n        cr.fill()\n\n\nclass PyApp(gtk.Window):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(PyApp, self).__init__()\n        self.connect(\"destroy\", gtk.main_quit)\n        vbox = MyColoredBox(False, 20)\n        b1 = gtk.Button(\"Hello\")\n        b2 = gtk.Button(\"World\")\n        vbox.add(b1)\n        vbox.add(b2)\n        self.add(vbox)\n        self.show_all()\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    PyApp()\n    gtk.main()\n\nThe resulting programm looks something like this:\n\n", "Q: How do I fix a garbled screen on a Gateway LT3103u? I've been having garbled screen problems on a Gateway LT3103u on Ubuntu for a while. I just did a fresh install of Ubuntu 11.10 and continue to have issues. I installed xubuntu-desktop in case the issues had to do with the sophisticated GNOME graphics. The problem is less bad, but it's still there. After a few minutes of using XFCE, the screen gets garbled. I assume this has something to do with the graphics card, but I don't know how to go about troubleshooting something like this. Where should I start? \nUpdate: Here is the description of the VGA card from lspci -vvv:\n01:05.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc RS690M [Radeon X1200 Series] (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])\nSubsystem: Acer Incorporated [ALI] Device 028c\nControl: I/O+ Mem+ BusMaster+ SpecCycle- MemWINV- VGASnoop- ParErr- Stepping- SERR- FastB2B- DisINTx-\nStatus: Cap+ 66MHz- UDF- FastB2B- ParErr- DEVSEL=fast >TAbort- <TAbort- <MAbort- >SERR- <PERR- INTx-\nLatency: 64, Cache Line Size: 32 bytes\nInterrupt: pin A routed to IRQ 18\nRegion 0: Memory at d0000000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [size=256M]\nRegion 2: Memory at f0100000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=64K]\nRegion 4: I/O ports at 9000 [size=256]\nRegion 5: Memory at f0000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=1M]\nExpansion ROM at <unassigned> [disabled]\nCapabilities: [50] Power Management version 2\nFlags: PMEClk- DSI- D1+ D2+ AuxCurrent=0mA PME(D0-,D1-,D2-,D3hot-,D3cold-)\nStatus: D0 NoSoftRst- PME-Enable- DSel=0 DScale=0 PME-\nCapabilities: [80] MSI: Enable- Count=1/1 Maskable- 64bit+\nAddress: 0000000000000000  Data: 0000\nKernel driver in use: radeon\nKernel modules: radeon\n\nUpdate: Setting GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"nomodeset\" in /etc/default/grub seems to have fixed it in both Ubuntu and xubuntu-desktop. I will test it for a day or so to see if the problems recur and then post more detail with some links to an explanation.\n\nA: It turns out this post is the answer I was looking for. The trouble is something called kernel mode-setting (KMS), which according to the Ubuntu wiki\n\nshifts responsibility for selecting and setting up the graphics mode from X.org to the kernel. When X.org is started, it then detects and uses the mode without any further mode changes.\n\nHowever, Radeon graphics cards are unevenly supported by the kernel, and KMS is turned on automatically in newer versions of Ubuntu, despite it not working with older cards. This is probably the reason why upgrading Ubuntu caused these problems.\nTo remove KMS in GRUB 2, add nomodeset to GRUB_CMD_LINUX (GRUB_CMD_LINUX=\"nomodeset\") in /etc/default/grub and run sudo update-grub. Reboot.\n\nA: I know this question is over two years old, but using nomodeset was not a viable option for me as it made my machine extremely sluggish, not to mention the lower screen resolution.  Fortunately, a fix has finally been released in version 3.13-rc5 of the Ubuntu Kernel.  Here's what I did to upgrade my 12.04 LTS install (which was running 3.11):\nmkdir kernel-v3.13-rc8-trusty && cd kernel-v3.13-rc8-trusty/\nwget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.13-rc8-trusty/linux-headers-3.13.0-031300rc8-generic_3.13.0-031300rc8.201401120535_amd64.deb\nwget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.13-rc8-trusty/linux-headers-3.13.0-031300rc8_3.13.0-031300rc8.201401120535_all.deb\nwget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.13-rc8-trusty/linux-image-3.13.0-031300rc8-generic_3.13.0-031300rc8.201401120535_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb\nsudo reboot now\n\n(You can substitute \"v3.13-rc8-trusty\" with another version (all of which you can see here) if you wish, so long as it's post-3.13-rc5).\nI suspect that the same garbled-screen issue occurs on other netbooks with similar ATI graphics cards (rs690/x1200/x1250), and this approach should work for those cases as well.\n", "Q: Expo edges not working in Unity?

I have a similar issue on a Dell notebook and Jupiter is helping. The newer kernels (maybe not the newest but apparently those used in 11.10) have power usage regressions that cause low battery life and other issues with laptops. In my case, I had low battery usage and a lot of an activity. Jupiter seemed to help quite a bit:\nhttp://liliputing.com/2011/09/how-to-use-jupiter-with-ubuntu-11-10-to-control-netbook-power-features.html\nIn other words, the kernel issues may be causing higher CPU usage which is reflected by your fans having to be powered on or powered on at a higher speed to combat the issue.\nUpdate: I later took a vacuum and put it right up against my fan outlet.

Other than viewing the history, is there a way to filter my history?\nSay I want to search for a command that started with \"ssh\"?\n\nA: I found the following function somewhere on the Internet and have used it to great effect. Put this in your ~/.bashrc:\nhgrep () { \n    history | egrep --color=auto --recursive \"$@\" | egrep --color=auto --recursive -v \"hgrep $@\"\n}\n\nNow re-load your shell: exec bash. You now have a new command, which you can use like so:\nhgrep ssh\n\nIt will show you a list of matching commands from your history. To run a command, type ! followed by the command number. Here's an example:\n~:$ hgrep scp\n  207  tn scp foreign-teachers __HOST__:unity.log __HOST__:compiz.log .\n  421  tn scp scott-laptop __HOST__:Scott\\ Severance.asc .\n  422  tn scp scott-laptop __HOST__:'Scott\\ Severance.asc' .\n  468  tn scott-desktop scp -r Backgrounds/* __HOST__:Pictures/Backgrounds\n  469  tn scott-laptop scp -r Backgrounds/* __HOST__:Pictures/Backgrounds\n  470  scp -r Backgrounds/* 192.168.1.2:Pictures/Backgrounds\n~:$ !207\n\nI like this approach better than Ctrl+R because it allows much more flexible searches, and I can see multiple results at once.\n\nA: Put this in your ~/.bashrc : \n\nalias hgrep='history | grep --color=auto '\n\nexample:\n\nA: Press Ctrl+R and type ssh. Ctrl+R will start search from most recent command to old one (reverse-search). If you have more than one command which starts with ssh, Press Ctrl+R again and again until you find the match.\nOnce you've found the match you can press Enter to execute the command or left / right cursor to just select the text of the command.\nThere is no default reverse option for Ctrl+R to invert the direction of the search but here you will find some suggestions about it.\n\nA: Wanted to write this as a comment to @ssmy but couldn't get the formatting in the comment to cooperate.\nAfter searching through the history with history | grep ssh you can then execute the command you wish by typing its number prepended with an exclamation mark, e.g. !42.\nExample:\n\n$ history | grep ssh\n  5 ssh me@someserver.net\n 13 ssh me@someotherserver.net\n 42 ssh me@thisone.com\n$ !42\n\n\nA: History is good but limited - I prefer to set up my bash environment so that I log all of the commands I have ever run, in addition to the directory in which they were run in. Then I run a command to list all of the commands I have run in the current directory, which I can pipe to grep etc - it's called 'dish' see:\nhttps://github.com/wolfwoolford/dish\nIf you want to cut to the chase, just source this in your .bashrc (https://github.com/wolfwoolford/dish/blob/master/dishrc)\nThere's also a really useful command you get for free called 'dishg' - or dish global - which prints out every command ever run, regardless of directory. Obviously this one is only useful when used with grep and tail etc... \nI've been using it for years and it's literally the first thing I install whenever I setup a new box. It logs the commands you run into text files in a hidden directory (~/.dish) .. I've never had an issue with disk space...\n\nA: I like to grep my history instead of Ctrl+R backwards search. That's because you can only see one line with Ctrl+R. With grep you get more of an overall view of your last interaction with a command etc.\nI have the following in my .bashrc . It lets you search the command history by typing hiss KEYWORD . Call it what you like. I like to hiss^^ . Don't forget to reload your .bashrc file with source ~/.bashrc\nhiss () { history | grep \"$@\"; }\n\n\nA: I do a slight variation of the above, works well for me (if you're referring to your bash history\nIn my home folder I create a file named \n.inputrc\n\nInside goes this \n\"\\e[5~\": history-search-backward\n\"\\e[6~\": history-search-forward\n\nNote: the above doesn't seem to work anymore  in 14.04 so this does the same thing   - \n\"\\e[A\":history-search-backward\n\"\\e[B\":history-search-forward\n\nThen typing however much of a previous command I wish & using the page up/page dn buttons searchs the history, always starting with page up\n\nA: If you just want to search your history, you can just use history | grep ssh, substituting ssh for whatever you want to search.\n\nA: Here's another method using classic commands (more likely to work across distros). Command history is stored in the file .bash_history in your home directory, so you can do this:\ngrep \"ssh\" ~/.bash_history\n\nDon't forget the -i flag if you need case insensitive search.\n\nA: Pressing Ctrl+R will start \"reverse-i-search\" mode, typing \"ssh\" would search your history for commands which contain \"ssh\".\n\nA: If you use shell in Emacs (M-x shell) you can use M-r (it is equivalent to Ctrl+R in a terminal).\n", "Q: Grub windows 7 loop I installed Ubuntu 11.10.

2,005 B in 45s (44 B/s)\nReading package lists...\n\nIs there any way I can get rid of the translation stuff?  I'm tired of it resulting in tons of repository checks rather than it checking far fewer repositories (69 actual repos vs. 169 checks)\n\nA: To disable downloading translations, create a file named /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99translations & put the following in it:\nAcquire::Languages \"none\";\n\nYou may also need to remove existing translation files in /var/lib/apt/lists/\nFor more information see the man page to apt.conf (5).\n\nA: Enable pipelining to batch these requests, which is much faster:\nAcquire::http { Pipeline-Depth \"200\"; }\n\nBut in my experience it can result in broken downloads; http error codes seem to cascade or something. It should be safe enough if you are talking to apt-cacher-ng (either mirror mode or proxy mode). Otherwise, be prepared to disable it if your mirror breaks.\nI would advise against setting languages to none, because it breaks apt-cache search (none means none, when useful searches would need descriptions in at least one language). The locale-based default includes unnecessary regional variants, but something like this:\nAcquire::Languages { \"fr\"; \"en\"; };\n\nis reasonable.\n\nA: I didn't want to download German APT translation files. So, as a comprise I have set explicitly in a new /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99translations file with order first English then None translations:\nAcquire::Languages { \"en\"; \"none\"; };\n\nI have removed all existing German translation files via rm -v /var/lib/apt/lists/*i18n_Translation-de*.\nBefore:\nroot# apt-config dump | grep Languages\nAcquire::Languages \"\";\nAcquire::Languages:: \"de_DE\";\nAcquire::Languages:: \"de\";\nAcquire::Languages:: \"en\";\nAcquire::Languages:: \"none\";\n\nAfter:\nroot# apt-config dump | grep Languages\nAcquire::Languages \"\";\nAcquire::Languages:: \"en\";\nAcquire::Languages:: \"none\";\n\nIf there are multiple users with different $LANGUAGE settings the recommended setting should be (here: with order 1. environment 2. English 3. None):\nAcquire::Languages { \"environment\"; \"en\"; \"none\"; };\n\nAFAICS this is the default setting (see above output of \"Before:\" section).\n[1] http://users.ox.ac.uk/~bioc1289/post/2013/01/right-way-to-not-download-apt-translation.html\n\nA: Just for the record (since some will trip on this ..) the 99Translations file above will cause apt to barf - remove the \"Packages: *\" line - just the one line is enough:\nAcquire::Languages \"none\";\n\nAlso, apt will still retrieve the files for your locale/language.\n\nA: Found this as I was searching for a solution too. Was a fresh install of Debian testing. The following command (as suggested above) fixed it:\nsudo rm -r /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n\n\nA: Go to Language Support then click Install / Remove Languages... then uncheck the languages that you don't want.\nIf you removed all languages, it will default to generic English. Note that en-US packages are considered a separate language, so you have to uncheck English to uninstall its packages.\n", "Q: uninstall .deb installed through software center Downloaded a .deb file for a game (voxatron) and installed it through the software center. Searching the 'installed' section of the software center for 'voxatron' or 'vox' produces nothing. The software center history is also devoid of any reference to voxatron. \nIs there a way to un-install .deb packages downloaded outside of the software center but installed through the software center?\n\nA: Since Voxatron isn't one of the applications that was hand-picked to be displayed in the Ubuntu Software Center, it is classified as a \"technical item\" and will be hidden by default.\nTry searching for it again, then click \"Show technical items\" in the lower-left corner:\n\nEven a mainstream web browser can suffer from this opt-out system of classification if it isn't part of Ubuntu's official repositories.\n\nA: you can type in the terminal\nsudo apt-get remove voxatron\n", "Q: Cannot play Blocks That Matter indie bundle game I have installed latest JDK 1.7.0_u1 using the method provided at this page WebUpd8.\nI have also extracted the deb setup I got and edited the control file so as not to install java6.\nI'm getting the following error when i run using:\njava -jar /opt/BlocksThatMatter/BTM.jar\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no lwjgl in java.library.path\n        at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary(ClassLoader.java:1860)\n        at java.lang.Runtime.loadLibrary0(Runtime.java:845)\n        at java.lang.System.loadLibrary(System.java:1084)\n        at org.lwjgl.Sys$1.run(Sys.java:73)\n        at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method)\n        at org.lwjgl.Sys.doLoadLibrary(Sys.java:66)\n        at org.lwjgl.Sys.loadLibrary(Sys.java:82)\n        at org.lwjgl.Sys.<clinit>(Sys.java:99)\n        at org.lwjgl.util.Timer.<clinit>(Timer.java:50)\n        at Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Game.<init>(Game.java:19)\n        at org.flixel.FlxFactory.<init>(FlxFactory.java:74)\n        at SSS.BTM.Main.BlocksThatMatter.main(BlocksThatMatter.java:13)\n\n\nA: We are working on this.\nFor now, what you can try is:\n\n\n*\n\n*open terminal\n\n*move to the game folder: \ncd /opt/BlocksThatMatter/\n\n\n*\n\n*allow executable rights on the BTM executable:\n\n\nchmod +x BTM\n(may requires admin rights: sudi chmod +x BTM)\n\n\n*\n\n*add update your path:\n\n\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\"/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0_01/jre/lib/amd64\"\n(this may vary depending: your processor architecture ; if you are using the OpenJDK, or the Oracle non-free ; the place where you installed your java machine)\nFor example, it can also be export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\"/opt/java/jre/lib/amd64\"\n\n\n*\n\n*then try ti run the game with\n\n\n./BTM\nHope this temporary workaround helps.\n\nA: I've installed that game and it runs with openjdk-6 (6b23~pre10-0ubuntu5) supplied in Ubuntu 11.10 32-bit (also on 11.04). There is no need to install Oracle Java if you only want to run this game. I didn't need to make BTM executable (installed blocks-matter_1.0.0.6_all.deb) it just run when started from the shortcut.\n", "Q: Is there any PPA that follow the latest Intel Opensource Driver For Ubuntu 10.04?

Apple says you can share a DVD drive over the network, but their \"magical\" approach only works with Windows and other Macs.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT1777?viewlocale=en_US\nCan I get Remote Disc to work with my Ubuntu laptop or get this functionality with another method?\nI don't mind setting up a network share somehow (NFS or similar) but it has got to be easy to turn on and off, with some script I'd imagine. I use my laptop in public spaces very often and I don't want others picking up my open DVD drive while I use public wifi.\nOn the Mac side, I'd want the DVD to show up in Finder. I don't mind running a script here either to mount/unmount the drive.\nUltimately, the solution has to be frictionless. It should work in any LAN environment. You can assume DHCP is on and the IP addresses for both computers will change once in a while. I also alternate between wifi and wired depending on where my laptop happens to be in the house.\nYour thoughts are appreciated!\n\nA: You could use sshfs to mount the directory on your Mac.\nOn the Ubuntu-Host you need to have the openssh-server installed:\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\nOn the Mac, install Fuse for OS X and MacFusion. Be sure to install the MacFUSE compatibility layer. MacFusion includes sshfs. The sshfs binary can be added to the PATH using a symlink:\nsudo ln -s /Applications/Macfusion.app/Contents/PlugIns/sshfs.mfplugin/Contents/MacOS/sshfs /usr/local/bin/sshfs\n\nNow, that you have openssh-server on your ubuntu host and MacFusion on the Mac, you can do the following (replace /media/mountdir by the actual mount location of the cd drive on the host) on the Mac:\nmkdir /media/cdromdrive\nsshfs Benutzername@ubuntuhost:/media/mountdir /media/cdromdrive\n\nafter that you should be able to access the contents on the cd from the directory (mount point) /media/cdromdrive\n\nA: Hi I found a nice article using afp here. It works great. I can read content of dvd in Ubuntu from my mac. \nThe only problem is I don't know how to open it on remote disc in the finder.\n", "Q: In the rhythmbox why are the music preferred format settings for Ogg Vorbis disabled? In the Rhythmbox Preferences, In the Music tab, under Library Structure, there is a Preferred Format setting.  In previous versions of Ubuntu, you could edit the default profiles in the Preferred Format setting.  In 11.10, this option is disabled.  Why?  Here is a page the highlights what you used to be able to do.\n\nA: Well it looks like rhythmbox hasn't adjusted,(been maintained),  to be able to edit the formats as it is now done.\nAdditionally RB can not encode to flac nor is it very good at retrieving cd info, all in all pretty much worthless for audio cd ripping atm\nBanshee is your better choice in terms of provided player/ripper, though I'd look at other choices such as abcde or rubyripper\n(adjustments done thru banshee can be seen in gconf-editor > apps/banshee-1/audio_profiles/cd-importing/\nEdit; - \nI thought that maybe the previous place local gstreamer pipelines were stored wasn't being used, turns out they can be, just not by rhythmbox. \ngconf/system/gstreamer/0.10/audio/profiles/\nInstalled sound-juicer to check, it can edit & uses those pipelines. Rhythmbox does not so the issue is rhythmbox's\nPossibly if RB is made the new default in 12.04 maybe some of these accumulated bugs will be fixed\n", "Q: How to setup a Hp Laserjet 4100n Printer?

At least you may need to copy the old .bashrc.\nTry the following:\ncp /home/old/.bashrc /home/new/.bashrc\n\nBetter would be to copy even more configuration files to the new home directory.\nBackground information: bashrc sets up the PATH environment variable, which points to the directories with executables (e.g. cat, ls) - without this file bash, the PATH variable is not set up correctly and bash does not know where to find cat and ls and others, which results in this issue.\nYou can check the path variable by doing:\necho $PATH\n\nthis should output sth like this:\n/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\n\n", "Q: Ext4 volume as File on NTFS volume I was running out of space on my ext3 root volume , so I created a Ext4 Volume as a file and saved it on a NTFS partition. Then made this ext4 vol as a permanent mount. \nPurpose was to have all the linux file permissions but NTFS doesn't allow this. \nIs it the right approach ? \nI see a lot of IO happens on the NTFS partition when i access the mounted (ext4) vol, Is it ok ? \n\nA: On my opinion this is the wrong approach, your Kernel needs to run two file system drivers (ext4 and ntfs3g) to store and read data and write access with ntfs3g is still somewhat not trusted. I used NTFS on my Ubuntu machine for a long time now and already once had issues with data loss, so please use this with much care for sensible data. Also access to this partition should be somewhat slow.\nThe \"correct\" way is to shrink the size of the NTFS-partition and create a real ext4-partition in the generated free space.\n", "Q: Is there a utility to transpose a .csv file? I have some csv files with too many columns for LibreOffice Calc to open, but only a few rows. If I can transpose the csv file, it should be ok as Calc can deal with very many more rows than columns.\n\nA: A simple python program would do the job (and since this is not really tested: backup you csv file in advance!):\nimport csv\nimport sys\ninfile = sys.argv[1]\noutfile = sys.argv[2]\n\nwith open(infile) as f:\n    reader = csv.reader(f)\n    cols = []\n    for row in reader:\n        cols.append(row)\n\nwith open(outfile, 'wb') as f:\n    writer = csv.writer(f)\n    for i in range(len(max(cols, key=len))):\n        writer.writerow([(c[i] if i<len(c) else '') for c in cols])\n\nYou can save this into a file \"my_csv_transposer.py\" and call it from the commandline like this: \npython my_csv_transposer.py <theinfilename> <theoutfilename>\n\n\nA: You can use this script from the shell like this:\n$ ./transpose_csv < theinfilename > theoutfilename\n\nAnd here is the script:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport sys, csv, itertools\nrows = itertools.izip(*csv.reader(sys.stdin, delimiter=','))\nsys.stdout.writelines(','.join(row) + '\\n' for row in rows)\n\n\nA: For reference's sake, here is the same incantation in Ruby:\nrequire 'CSV'\n\nrows = CSV.new($stdin).read\nputs rows.transpose.map { |x| x.join ',' }\n\n", "Q: How to install 32 Bit Wine on 64 Bit Ubuntu? Currently I'm running Ubuntu 11.10 64 Bit on my laptop and I want to install some Windows programs with Wine (Dreamweaver CS5/Starcraft II etc) but these programs require the 32Bit version of Wine to work even being in a 64Bit environment... I'm a Fedora user most of the time and in that distro installing 32Bit versions of apps inside of a 64Bit system is never a problem, but didn't find a way to do that on Ubuntu.\n\nA: The best ways to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*(Permanently) Edit /etc/environment:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo nano /etc/environment\n\n*Add the following line:\nWINEARCH=win32\nNote: by the above solution, wine & wibom use always the 32 bit\nversion of wine.\n\n*(Temporary) Open a terminal(Ctrl-Alt-t) and type:\n\n\n*\n\n*`env WINEARCH=win32 wine  or \n\n*`env WINEARCH=win32 winecfg for 1st .wine 32 bit bottle \n\n\n\nA: Things have changed a few times since my original answer. 64bit prefixes versions of Wine are pretty capable these days. I haven't had a pure 32bit version in at least a few years.\nYour \"Wine prefix\" (traditionally at ~/.wine/, but settable via env WINEPREFIX) controls how things will be run for the lifetime of that prefix. If you set up a 32bit prefix, everything will run in 32bit mode in that prefix. Conversely, if you don't do anything and run anything special, you'll create a Wine64 environment.\nIf you're starting a new prefix (ie on a new install of Ubuntu), you'll need to do a few special things:\n# Move the old prefix (if one exists)\n# You could rm -rf it if you don't want it.\nmv ~/.wine/ ~/oldwine/\n\n# Create prefix with right arch, per\n# http://wiki.winehq.org/FAQ#32_bit_wineprefix\nWINEARCH=win32 winecfg\n\nAnd that's it. Unless you're specifying another prefix that doesn't exist yet, you shouldn't need to set WINEARCH again.\nThe revision history to this answer holds additional information that I don't think is relevant in 2018. This is mostly point and shoot these days.\n\nA: Step 1: Install wine 1.4.  This version of wine supports win32 and win64.\nStep 2: Open a terminal.\nStep 3: export WINEPREFIX=prefix32\nStep 4: export WINEARCH=win32\nStep 5: winecfg\nStep 6: Enjoy, the new prefix is set for 32-bit execution.\nThis is the proper way to do this.  Installing cross-arch packages is a dirty fix that's likely to cause you trouble.\n\nA: On Ubuntu Oneiric, the 32-bit binaries and libraries of Wine are installed by default. No special action is necessary other than installing wine.\nConfirmed with:\n$ file `which wine`\n/usr/bin/wine: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.15, stripped\n\n\nA: . Was having the same problem. I just upgraded to Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit and was trying to get Office 2007 to work. It won't run in a 64-bit wine configuration. After a lot of searching, this is what I came across:\n\n\n*\n\n*The folder in which all your wine software are installed is known as your WINEPREFIX. By default this folder resides in your home (~) directory by the name '.wine'. There can be more than one WINEPREFIX.\n\n*There also exists an environment variable known as WINEARCH which represents the mode of your current wine settings, i.e. 64-bit or 32-bit.\n\n*THIS IS IMPORTANT. At the time of the creation of a WINEPREFIX the value of WINEARCH decides the mode in which wine will function when running applications from that WINEPREFIX.\n\n\nBy default the WINEARCH variable is set to the value 'win64' (stands for 64-bit) on a 64-bit Ubuntu installation therefore the automatically created WINEPREFIX has a 64-bit operation mode. In order to change this mode we need to 1) delete the current WINEPREFIX. 2) set WINEARCH to 'win32' 3)Create a new WINEPREFIX. The Steps:\nNOTE: These steps are to be done after installing wine. You can easily do that using the Ubuntu Software Center. search for Wine 1.6 and click install.\n  1) Open up the terminal by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T. And type the following commands:\n   cd ~\n   rm -rf .wine\n   rm -f .config/menus/applications-merged/wine*\n   rm -rf .local/share/applications/wine\n   rm -f .local/share/desktop-directories/wine*\n   rm -f .local/share/icons/????_*.xpm \n\n   2) Now to set your enviroment variable and also to create your new 32-bit WINEPREFIX go ahead and type:\n   WINEARCH=win32 WINEPREFIX=~/.wine winecfg\n\nThat's about it I guess! This worked for me! now all you need to do is to install your 32-bit applications. \n", "Q: Wifi for Centrino Wireless-N 1000 Intel Corporation (HP Pavilion dm4 - 2070us) is not working I have a HP Pavilion dm4-2070us which has an Intel Corporation Centrino Wireless-N 1000 adapter. \nThe problem is that my computer doesn't show the wireless networks after I upgraded my system to Ubuntu 11.10.

Somehow everything pointed to the fact that my wireless device is switched off and it can be switched on from Windows only. However, I don't have windows partition and it has just Ubuntu 11.10 so I don't see any point in switching the device on in Windows.\n\nA: After trying out different distributions and struggling with my wireless card I finally stumbled upon a link that gives a work around to the problem. Apparently the new kernel fails to detect the Centrino 1000 N wireless card in some laptops(hp dm4) while there are other laptops on which it works completely fine like Lenovo Y560P.\nThe following link gives the solution!! Even though I am not sure whether this work around will have any greater impacts later or not, but for now its working fine. \nhttp://community.linuxmint.com/tutorial/view/608\n\"To (temporarily) get the wireless working on newer kernels:\nsudo mv /lib/firmware/iwlwifi-1000-5.ucode /lib/firmware/iwlwifi-1000-5.ucode.backup\nsudo modprobe -r iwlagn\nsudo modprobe iwlagn\n\nThis should make the wireless use the old 1000-3.ucode which works at the moment.\"\n\nA: None of the solutions above worked for me I had to pass the mod option below\n/etc/modprobe.d/iwl.conf \noptions iwlwifi bt_coex_active=0 \n\nI picked this up from intel forum that I can't find the link to right now.\n\nA: I tried:\necho 'options iwlagn 11n_disable=1' | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/iwlagn.conf >/dev/null\n\nand it's working.\n\nA: Well the better solution is to have either the firmware fixed or more likely the driver fixed to work correctly with the version 5 of the firmware.\nSeems this has been reported \"upstream\" in intels bug tracker.\nBut so far there is no better solution than to replace the version 5 firmware with older version 3.\nI'm going to monitor the bug in the tracker and update my answer here once they do come up with  a better solution.\nUPDATE:\nTurns out I was mistaken - using the older version 3 of the microcode (ucode) firmware does NOT solve the issue for me. What I've confirmed does work in my case at least is using the version 5 ucode (as shipped in 12.04) but re-loading the driver with \"N\" disabled:\nsudo modprobe -r iwlwifi\nsudo modprobe iwlwifi 11n_disable=1\n\nas per an answer in this forum thread.\n\nA: I also had issues with this and tried many of the suggestions that were here and scattered about the internet with no success. \nI found the command inxi -N very helpful in determining exactly what wireless card I was using.\nUltimately the fix was to copy drivers downloaded from Intel website http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/iwlwifi to /lib/firmware upon rebooting wireless worked flawlessly.\n", "Q: Why won't my computer hibernate and shut down properly?

Switch your \"s to ' and it should be fine.\n\nA: @Beginners, might want to ask the purpose of attempting to edit the /etc/shadow by hand in this manner, in other words, what is the desired outcome that you wish to achieve? \nAs for understanding the whole history of the errors you are receiving, depending on your knowledge and understanding of C, there is a wealth of informative documentation at the source archive. If you search specifically for the errors you are receiving, you will find them, and see that they relate to errors you are seeing:\nstatic char *\nhist_error(s, start, current, errtype)\n      char *s;\n      int start, current, errtype;\n{\n   char *temp;\n   const char *emsg;\n   int ll, elen;\n\n  ll = current - start;\n\n  switch (errtype)\n{\ncase EVENT_NOT_FOUND:\n  emsg = \"event not found\";\n  elen = 15;\n  break;\ncase BAD_WORD_SPEC:\n  emsg = \"bad word specifier\";\n  elen = 18;\n  break;\ncase SUBST_FAILED:\n  emsg = \"substitution failed\";\n  elen = 19;\n  break;\ncase BAD_MODIFIER:\n  emsg = \"unrecognized history modifier\";\n  elen = 29;\n  break;\ncase NO_PREV_SUBST:\n  emsg = \"no previous substitution\";\n  elen = 24;\n  break;\ndefault:\n  emsg = \"unknown expansion error\";\n  elen = 23;\n  break;\n}\n\nThere may be an easier way to achieve the ends you desire, which is why I ask what that may be. If the ends are known, then the path is likely much traveled by many before, and an answer easier to deliver to assist you. ;)\nAlso, in reviewing the command, did not notice usage of the sudo convention, which would be necessary to complete any administrative function successfully. Remember that certain functions will not work without the correct privileges consumed at the time of execution.\nHTH. Have a nice day. :)\n\nA: History expansion only affects interactive shells when history expansion is enabled (which it is by default). You can disable history expansion by running set +H. I never use history expansion myself, so I put set +H in ~/.bashrc.\nAs for editing /etc/shadow manually, I'd advice against it. If you want to add users from the commandline, use adduser or newusers.\nman 8 adduser\nman 8 newusers\n\n", "Q: Create shortcut from command How can I achieve the following:\ntype vdm in the terminal \nand that will be replaced by wine Program Files/The VDM++ Toolbox Lite v8.3.1/bin\nI also wanted vdm to work in any folder I am whatsoever.\n\nA: The quickest way is via an alias. They look as simple as this:\nalias vdm='wine \"C:\\Program Files\\The VDM++ Toolbox Lite v8.3.1\\bin\"'\n\nAfter you plumb that in, you can run vdm (as long as it's from a bash shell) and your Wine command will run. You may need to play around with the syntax of the Wine statement a little.\nFor that to persist, you'll need to save it to one of your bash configurqation files. My original post suggested just adding that line to ~/.bashrc but as root54 points out, you should probably use ~/.bash_aliases if you're on a relatively new install. If it doesn't exist, don't worry, just create a new file and stick that line in.\nAfter you make changes to either of those files, you need to run  source . to reload bash's config.\n\nAlternatively you can create a bash function, again in ~/.bashrc:\nfunction vdm {\n    wine \"C:\\Program Files\\The VDM++ Toolbox Lite v8.3.1\\bin\"\n}\n\nAgain, after putting this in, you'll want to run source .\n\nAnd finally, if you need something more meaty (you don't for this simple command) you can write a full script and stick it in ~/bin.\nmkdir -p ~/bin\ntouch ~/bin/vdm\nchmod +x ~/bin/vdm\nnano vdm\n\nAnd copy in something like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nwine \"C:\\Program Files\\The VDM++ Toolbox Lite v8.3.1\\bin\"\n\nThe advantage of bin scripts over anything else is they're slightly more portable. You don't have to hack apart or replace your .bashrc if you want to take them to another computer. But they're a bit more fuss to create.\n\nA: Create a text file ~/.bash_aliases and put\nalias vdm='wine \"Program Files/The VDM++ Toolbox Lite v8.3.1/bin\"'\n\nin it. You'll need to restart your shell for it to take effect.\nThe .bash_aliases file is safer and easier to edit than editing the .bashrc file directly. It's automatically loaded by .bashrc on 11.04 and later.\nSee also How to create a permanent \"alias\"?\n\nA: In your terminal type alias vdm='wine Program Files/The VDM++ Toolbox Lite v8.3.1/bin\nIf you reboot, though, it will most likely be unset, so you will have to put the line inside the ~/.bashrc file.\nso gedit ~/.bashrc and at the bottom, paste the alias-line in the file.\n", "Q: How to make script support file:/// notation? When I copy any file and paste it in console or text editos it is passed as\n\nfile:///home/user/path/file\n\nwhen I pass it to script it is not found\nWhat is the easiest way to convert that to normal linux path or somehow make script support it?\nfor example\n\ncat file:///home/user/path/file\n\nsays \n\nNo such file or directory\n\n\nA: I don't know of any commands that convert between file urls and file paths, but you can convert with python, or any other language with bindings to gio. E.g.:\n$ python -c 'import gio,sys; print(gio.File(sys.argv[1]).get_path())' file:///home/user/path/file%20with%20spaces\n/home/user/path/file with spaces\n\n\nA: You can also use urlencode (sudo apt-get gridsite-clients):\n$ echo \"$(urlencode -d \"file:///folder/with%20spaces\")\"\nfile:///folder/with spaces\n$ echo \"$(urlencode -d \"file:///folder/with%20spaces\"|cut -c 8-)\"\n/folder/with spaces\n\nIf you don't need hexadecimal support, you can just use cut -c 8-. Alternatively, you could use urlencode with any other method of removing the file:// (sed, brace expansion, etc.)\n\nA: To remove the file:// prefix from the URL, you can use sed:\necho \"file:///home/user/path/file\" | sed \"s/^file:\\/\\///g\"\n\nWhat the above does:\n\n\n*\n\n*Displays the URL to the standard output (so it can be modified with sed)\n\n*Replaces all occurrences of file:// in any line that begins with file:// with nothing. This effectively removes file:// from the URL leaving only /home/user/path/file\nTo use this from a script you can try the following:\ncat $(echo \"file:///home/user/path/file\" | sed \"s/^file:\\/\\///g\")\n\nNow the error message is:\ncat: /home/user/path/file: No such file or directory\n\n(Please note that it refers to the correct filename instead of the URL.)\nIt would be much cleaner to store the converted filename in a shell variable and use it afterwards.\nMYFILE=$(echo \"file:///home/user/path/file\" | sed \"s/^file:\\/\\///g\")\ncat $MYFILE\n\n\nA: I believe you can do this is bash itself. Try the following\necho \"file:///home/user/path/file\" | cut -d'/' -f3-\n/home/user/path/file\n\nIt will delimit till file:// and the rest will be echoed on the terminal.\n\nA: You  can use this, assuming file_path contains the path:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfile_path='file:///home/me/Desktop/path test'\n\nfile_path=\"${file_path#file://}\"\n\necho \"${file_path}\"\n\nwhich prints /home/me/Desktop/path test. This allows it to work with or without file://, using only Bash string manipulation.\n\nYou can add this to a function (in .bashrc) for ease of use:\nFunction:\nnorm_path() {\n    echo \"${@#file://}\"\n}\n\nUsage:\ncat \"$(norm_path file:///home/user/path/file)\"\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu,Ubuntu (no effects),Gnome,Gnome Classic These are the various options of ubuntu that I am asked to chose from.How do these differ?\n\nA: *\n\n*Ubuntu uses Unity with Compiz.\n\n*Ubuntu (no effects) uses Unity 2D with Metacity.\n\n*Gnome is, I think, Gnome Shell with Mutter as the compositor.\n\n*Gnome Classic is the similar to the old Classic traditional Ubuntu desktop, using panels. It's not the same because it had to be rebuilt using GTK3 widgets.\nThe \"no effects\" and \"Gnome Classic\" variants are the ones you'll want on desktops with little or no graphical acceleration. Compiz and Mutter both require a certain amount of hardware heft to run.\n", "Q: How do I manually install GRUB? I was installing Ubuntu 11.10 and the bootloader install failed. I tried installing it again but it didn't work so I want to know how to install grub manually.\nThanks.\n\nA: I think this technique will not work.

I'm planning on buying a Dell XPS 15z laptop. I was wondering what is the status for running 11.10 on it? Are there any known issues that might be difficult to solve (specifically regarding installation)?\nI've read of difficulties with wireless connectivity, touchpad and nVidia but all the posts seem to be quite old and possibly not currently relevant.\n\nA: As to my experience (received the pc two days ago, struggled, won).\nInformations here are nearly correct\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport/Machines/Laptops/Dell/XPS/15z\nI have to add\n\n\n*\n\n*It boots to direct installing from USB flawless, just remember to hit any button when you get the purple screen with human = keyboard and set the acpi=off.

Forget multi touch by now.\n\n*I prefer Bumbleebee on Ironhide. Install it through ppa address you can find in the GitHub. My process was:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add bumblebee ppa\n\n*install nvida-current from restricted drivers\n\n*install bumblebee (remember to \"sudo usermod -a -G bumblebee YOURUSERNAME\" as said by the bumblebee readme)\n\n*install mesa-utils\n\n*reboot\n\n*try intel card with terminal command \"glxspheres\"\n\n*try nvidia card with terminal command \"optirun glxspheres\"\n\n\nI'm still figuring out how to let nvidia-settings know I have nvidia-current drivers, because it doesn't detect them.\n\n*Wireless issues depend on Power Save Polling, you may find a solution on the wiki page above.\n\nA: Bought it at late August 2012, I wish I had research more before I bought it.\nLaptop looks nice. That's all I can say so far.\nXPS 15z doesn't have page up/down key, it you read some paper or documents a lot, it will be a nightmare to you.\nIf you use it to play game, it heat up quickly if you play display intensive game.\nI had numerous shutdown while playing game and turn the laptop to it's right. So far tech support had replaced the mother board and fan, problem still persist.\nin one word, stay away from it if it's not too late.\n\nA: I just recently purchased a XPS 15z and so far I'm fairly satisfied.\nThe nvidia optimus problem wasn't too hard to get around, if you search around you can find ironhide or The Bumblebee Project which solve most of the issues (but don't support swapping between the cards).\nThe trackpad was easy to get working again, just I haven't been able to find any way to get the multi-touch functionality working.\nProbably the worst problem I've noticed is the wireless problems.  First of all, the bluetooth and wireless are hard to separate on this laptop.  If you disable the bluetooth, the wireless doesn't work.  Also on my school wifi I have a sketchy connection at best.  Been trying to find a way around it but still haven't completely solved it.  The network sometimes takes a while too connect, sometimes won't connect, and frequently drops connection.  \nBut this seems to be a router dependent problem due to the fact that at my apartment the wireless works perfectly.  So the odds are you'll be unsatisfied with the wireless till a fix for this problem is found.\nOther than the wireless, I've been completely happy with this laptop!\n\nA: I got some new issues when updating to 12.04, see\nDell xps 15z fan issue in ubuntu 12.04\nOtherwise, works like a charm. I really recommend using the SSD option, \nit is incredibly quick.\n\nA: I've had mine for awhile, and it worked great, then started having \"cursor jumping issues.\"  Have complete care service on it, so technicians have come out, and it has been repaired now 5-6 times.  Hard drive replaced, mother board replaced, monitor replaced, keyboard, touchpad, etc.  Some pieces twice.  In home repair and to the Dell Depot twice.  Will try to boot and hard drive will not be found.  Last \"repair\" was supposed to fix it, or I wanted a new laptop.  Our other Dell laptops are not having these issues, but this XPS one is a real lemon.  It came back in January after it's 5th or 6th repair (I've lost count), and it worked fine for 2-3 weeks, but now the cursor is jumping again.  Dell says it isn't aware of a problem.  Simply google \"Dell XPS cursor jumping\"  or \"Quickset XPS issues\" and see what you find. You will see that earlier years, people are trying to see if it is their hands touching the key pad (lazy wrist has been blamed) but as you look at reviews later (2011, 2012) you will see references to the Quickset issue.  One Dell rep told me that it was a compatability issue with the Quickset driver and the backlit keyboard.  The guy I spoke with today wanted to know \"who at Dell told me that.\"  Unbelievable.  Also, when they take over the lap top remotely, they cannot reproduce it, yet when I type an answer in their chat window, it happens.  I filmed it and offered to send them the video...they said that wouldn't be necessary.  They know there is an issue.

I figured I'd upgrade to 11.10 and the problem would get fixed but no.\nWhenever I click on a Windows network domain using Nautilus, the following message pops up.:\n\nUnable to mount location - Failed to retrieve share list from server\n\nWhere do I start troubleshooting this problem?  I am getting desperate now :(\nI tried\nsudo mount -t cifs //SomeMachine/SomeShare some_directory\n\nand I get\nmount error(115): Operation now in progress\n\nStrangely enough, I got a popup stating:\nCould not display network:/// Error: Dbus error org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.NoReply: Did not receive a reply ...\n\n\nA: The problem (at least in Ubuntu 18.04 where I tried it) is that the following command:\nsudo ufw allow Samba\n\nwill only add rules for Samba acting as a server.  It will not add any rules for Samba acting as a client.  But when you try to mount a remote share, that's what you are doing: in this scenario your machine is a client, and the remote machine is a server. \nAlso, the \"no reply\" error is a hint that some firewall is messing things up.  Machines do generally respond to requests.  They may respond with an error, in which case you have other problems, but if they don't respond at all, then their packets are usually being eaten up by a firewall.\nThe rules that allow Samba to act as a server are not sufficient to also allow Samba to act as a client, because the remote machines respond from their own port 137, but the local port on which these responses arrive is not 137, it is some random port.\nTo solve this problem, execute the following command:\nsudo ufw allow in proto udp from any port 137,138 to any\n\nThis will allow UDP packets to arrive into any local port as long as they are originating from port 137 or 138 of the remote computer. The port 138 is probably not necessary, as I have only seen packets arriving from 137, but you never know.\nThis is probably insecure, because the originating port can be spoofed, but let's not be paranoid.\nThis fixed it for me.\n\nA: It's possible this is a general error connecting to the system:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-895820-start-0.html\nIn the above thread case, there was a mismatch between name and IP address, and nmblookup helped determine the problem.

Save and exit.\nSample ip and name:  \n192.168.120.65    blablaPcName\n\nThats all.\n\nA: I've had very good results in mixed network environments (Windows/Ubuntu) with this method:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Alt+F2 and type: gksu gedit /etc/nsswitch.conf\n\n*Look for this line:\nhosts:  files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns mdns4\n\n\n*Add wins so it looks like this:\nhosts:  files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] wins dns mdns4\n\n\n*Install the \"winbind\" package: sudo apt-get install winbind\n(Or via Software Center or Synaptic.)\n\n*Reboot or restart your network.\n\nA: Try logging into a Windows box from Ubuntu using Files. Go to \"Other Locations\" and \"Connect to Serer\" down the bottom. Use smb://username@serveraddress. This worked for me.\n\nA: When accessing a windows server on Ubuntu 20.04 with samba version 4.11.6, I solved the issue by adding to /etc/samba/smb.conf the lines below.\n#### Networking ####\nclient min protocol = NT1\nserver min protocol = NT1\nname resolve order = bcast host lmhosts wins\n\n\nA: My problem was due to /etc/samba/smb.conf. Searched for WORKGROUP and deleted the line after it which mentioned a localhost name. Make sure the WORKGROUP is the same for both config files on each machine. An all round way is to sudo apt-get purge samba (and/or remove ?) and then sudo apt-get install samba. This is how I solve the problem the first time round, after upgrading from 16.10 to 17.04 on one of my machines (16.10 was buggy for me). I have two machines now: 16.04 and 17.04.\n\nA: I had this problem and solved it by installing the package gvfs-bin. Except for gvfs-bin, most of the gvfs packages were already installed: gvfs, -common, -libs, -daemons, and -backends.\n\nA: I had the same problem in Ubuntu 18.04 and this solution worked for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit /etc/samba/smb.conf and add the line client max protocol = NT1 after the workgroup = WORKGROUP entry.\n\n*Restart the samba service by running sudo service smbd restart.\n\n\nA: I had this issue recently when connecting from Ubuntu 20.04 to a Synology NAS.\nThe issue seemed to be caused by the software only providing SMB2 and SMB3 versions of the protocol.\nWhen I set the share to support SMB1 (so version 1 to 3 supported) it worked.\nIn general the issue might be caused by the Samba settings that configure the protocol version and settings and the ones on the server side, so make sure they match.\n\nA: You may need to install samba:\nsudo apt install samba\n\n\nA: I could only see my samba server by ip address.  \nSwitching bcast to 1st in 'name resolve order = bcast lmhosts hosts wins'. And restarting samba. Btw this 1 line restarts samba.   \nsudo service samba restart\n\nThat didn't work either.  \nI went to look in /etc/samba/lmhosts to check it & no file! So I made lmhosts. \n$ sudo nano /etc/samba/lmhosts   \n10.0.2.2   server_name \n\nI still couldn't search the server name. \nThen I thought wait, the computer name & samba name are different. So I edited hosts & hostname, changing them to the samba server's name. Careful hostname only has one word in it. The computer name no # comments. \n/etc/hosts    \n/etc/hostname    \n$ sudo reboot \n\nNow it just works. I can just click network in nautilus or caja and the server just pops up! On all clients, all are linux or android. Even on an old debian squeeze machine.\n", "Q: Compiz disables 3rd Monitor I have a try monitor setup with using the proprietary ATI drivers:\n\nThis works pretty well with metacity, with the exception of some maximize strangeness. On monitors 3 and 2 it works as expected. However, if maximize a window while it is with monitor 1 it maximizes on monitor 3. So I figured I would try Compiz.\nWhen I start compiz with compiz --replace monitor 1 (forgive the backward numbering) goes black. The monitor does not lose power. I can still see the cursor if I move my mouse over to it, however compiz will not let me drag any windows to monitor 1. \nI tried to set my outputs in ComizConfig Settings Manager but it doesn't seem to make a difference:\n\n\nA: If you have Detect Outputs checked, that overrides the manual outputs in the window below.

It should list under Peripheral Devices (left side). Click on it. \nOn right side click unmount volume and then Format Volume (not Format Drive). If only format drive appears and Format Volume does not appear read till last. \nA window pops up. In type select FAT, give a name and then hit format. It asks for confirmation, press format. \nAfter formatting press Mount Volume again. \nGo to home using the File Explorer (gui, nautilus, home button), or select the drive using unity lauch bar. See if you can create new file or directory. Right click on a blank area inside file explorer (file manager) inside your drive and select properties. \nIf Filesystem type: says msdos. It is perfect (FAT32), it should work on windows or linux (unless you are trying to copy a file larger than 4G). 4G being limit for FAT. In Disk Utility if you don't see Partition Type: w9 FAT32 and options like Unmount Voulme or if not mounted Mount Volume, Format volume, Check Filesystem, Edit Partition, Delete Partition read on. These options should be shown in lower half below Volumes(thick black above your driver partition gui). \nIf you only see buttons above Volumes like Format, Safe Removal and Benchmark you have only Formatted the Drive but not created a Volume. You have to create a filesystem in a drive before you can use it. \nThese all steps seems lame, but if you have missed anything, it might help, if not your USB stick is damaged, get a new one.\nWarning: Don't just vaguely format drives under Local Storage (you might have no os to boot into). \n\nA: @neildeadman - when you format the USB stick in Ubuntu as a device, let's presume you are doing this through a single tool like perhaps gparted for ease of discussion's sake. One the device has been formatted, how do you remove the device from the system prior to readying it for use within a Windows 7 system?\nIf you simply unplug the device, it may appear as RAW, because it has not been properly unmounted from the Ubuntu system. Would suggest unmounting the USB stick from Ubuntu prior to attempting to unplug, then remove from the Ubuntu system and then plug into the Windows 7 system and determine if the formatting remains. \nThe act of not unmounting the USB stick could be the potential cause for your error.\nHTH. Have a nice day. :)\n\nA: when you format the usb stick, change the file format to FAT or FAT32\nWhen formating make sure that the \"take the ownership of file system\" is selected\n", "Q: Unable to format miniSD card I have a 2GB mini-SD card that I am trying to format.

Modern releases such as 14.04 LTS and newer do not have PySDM package.\nI was having a hard time solving the problem and this solution worked for me.\nPySDM is a Storage Device Manager that allows full customization of hard disk mountpoints without manually access to fstab.\nIt also allows the creation of udev rules for dynamic configuration of storage devices \n\n\n*\n\n*install physical storage device manager: sudo apt-get install pysdm\n\n*open storage device manger: sudo pysdm\n\n*choose your required drives\n\n*press assist\n\n*uncheck open as read only\n\n*check owner user of file system and write your username: remon\n\n*press ok\n\n*press apply\n\n*umount Drive\n\n*mount it\n\n\nNote:\nif you can't change files to binary executable, go to special files and check permit execution of files as binaries, and go to step 7.\n\nA: By default, I think it mounts it as the logged in desktop user.  You will want to mount instead through the \"mount\" command or in he fstab:\nAt command line:\nsudo mkdir /mnt/sdd1\n\nEdit /etc/fstab and add to the end:\n/dev/sdd1 /mnt/sdd1 fuseblk defaults,umask=022 0 0\n\nThen at the command line (to process the /etc/fstab file again):\nmount -a\n\nThere are a lot of ways to do this, more intelligent ways, etc, but the long story is that you can't get the behavior you want with chmod (especially if the filesystem is a FAT filesystem that has no native concept of permissions).\nIf you are interested the mount man page gives a lot of information on the subject.\n\nA: If your external drive is portable HDD or flash drive then it is good option to edit fstab. Because it is permanent and your drive will not connect always. If you want to mount your drive with write permission then unmount your drive first (right click on drive and unmount) or:\numount '/media/Expansion Drive'\n\nNow mount with write permission:\nmount -o rw /dev/sdXY /media/External_drive\n\nYou must create the directory first:\nsudo mkdir -p /media/External_drive\n\nHope this will help.\n\nA: After I purchased a new computer, I needed to get my thumb drives working on it.\nHere's the procedure:\n\n*\n\n*Open \"Disk Utility\", and look for your device, and click on it.  This will let you be sure you know the correct filesystem type and device name for it.  In my case, it was 'ext4' and '/dev/sdb1' respectively.  Next: Decide what you want to call your thumb drive.  I called mine 'USB16-C', but you choose your own name. Before closing Disk Utility, click unmount. And USER should be your login name.\nThen run steps 2 to 4 in a terminal window.\n\n\n*sudo mkdir -p /media/USB16-C\n\n\n*sudo mount -t ext4 -o rw /dev/sdb1 /media/USB16-C\n\n\n*sudo chown -R USER:USER /media/USB16-C\nNow my thumb drive is accessible, and it automatically connects when I reboot too.\n\nA: @VinayKrPrajapat Your solution worked but it should be specified that you should select the specific drive path not all at once as that may effect your boot up. \nExample:\ncd /mnt/sdc \nsudo chmod -R a+rx *\nJust selecting /media or /mnt would effect all drives including the boot disk which could cause problems. \n\nA: Simplest one is here you only need to go to the media folder and change permissions. Follow below to commands.\ncd /media/ \nsudo chmod -R a+rX *\n\nAnd it's done.\n", "Q: How do I force a resolution of 1024x768? back in ubuntu 9, maximum resolution supported was 960x600, by editing xorg.conf i was able to get 1024x768 resolution. i recently installed ubuntu 11.10.. now again maximum resolution i can get in display panel is 960x600 .. i tried editing xorg but there was no xorg and when i tried to create one access was denied.\nI'm new to linux commands so, step by step help will be appreciated.\nI added /etc/X11/xorg.conf containing:\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier    \"Configured Video Device\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier    \"Configured Monitor\"\n    HorizSync       30.0-62.0\n    VertRefresh     50.0-70.0\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier    \"Default Screen\"\n    Monitor        \"Configured Monitor\"\n    Device        \"Configured Video Device\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    SubSection \"Display\"\n        Depth    24\n        Modes     \"1024x768\" \"800x600\"\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection \n\n\nA: *\n\n*Enter the command below in your terminal:\ngksu gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\n\n*Copy and paste the following options into that file: \nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier    \"Configured Video Device\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier    \"Configured Monitor\"\n    HorizSync       30.0-62.0\n    VertRefresh     50.0-70.0\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier    \"Default Screen\"\n    Monitor        \"Configured Monitor\"\n    Device        \"Configured Video Device\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    SubSection \"Display\"\n        Depth    24\n        Modes     \"1024x768\" \"800x600\"\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection \n\n\n*Save your edits, and restart (log out and back in or reboot).\nEnjoy.\n\nA: Here is my solution using xrandr to force a resoultion of 1280x1024 at 75hz...

I log back in an want to restore the same info window I get when I originally ran minecraft &. How would I restore this?\n\nA: You can use screen or tmux to do this.  screen is used more and installed by default, so if you are new to this it's probably best to start with that.  Also recommended when you use screen is Byobu (screencast video here), which is a wrapper around screen that makes it easier to use and adds lots of useful extensions to screen (and in the future it will also support tmux).\n\nA: You can use byobu. It can be installed easily by with\n\nsudo apt-get install byobu\n\nand can be started with \n\nbyobu\n\nYou can set an option through the menus that it will be automatically started when you ssh into the server. \nbyobu is a front-end that uses screen. It allows the convenient usage of multiple terminal windows through one ssh connection.\n\nA: Look into GNU Screen.  It allows long-running programs to execute, and you can \"detach\" and \"reattach\" to these sessions at will.\nSearch the software centre for \"screen\".  The package name is screen.\nTo detach, just close the ssh session with the red X, (don't exit).  Or type ctrl-a d.\nTo reattach, do\nscreen -r <screen-id>\n\nWhere  can be obtained from\nscreen -list\n\n\nA: If the server's interface is console-only, you can use GNU screen to get the persistence you want.  If it's graphical, use VNC or nx for persistence.\nOr if you don't care about reattaching the process later on, the nohup (\"no hangup\") command will run a process that ignores the terminate signal triggered when the ssh session ends.\n", "Q: How do you get gnome-shell to show the full name? I've been using gnome-shell and I really like it.

For an example of what I mean:\n\nI have two icons for Battle for Wesnoth in the Games filter.  Both of them apparently have names too long to display entirely and end in \"...\".  Is there a way to either tell gnome-shell to display the names or to have them appear as a tooltip or something?\n\nA: I played around with the gnome-shell.css (/usr/share/themes/[your-current-theme]), after I copied that folder to /home/user/.themes. In the gnome-shell.css is a section called Apps where you can change the grid size of the grid on which the icons are aligned - if you make that bigger (change contact grid entry accordingly) you will see more. \nI also tried to find how the pop-ups, like on the overview sidebar, work - however I could not find that.

I've just recently download the whole collection of open source fonts hosted by Google, and was wondering if installing them on my computer would cause performance issues.\nThe aforementioned computer has a processor clocked at 2.3 GHz and 1.8 GB's of RAM.\nIf you've had experience with large collections of fonts on Ubuntu, please let me know how your computer preformed in the answers below.\n\nA: The fonts themselves won't slow down anything but use up some space.\nHowever like WarriorIng64 pointed out some applications, particularly the ones that let you choose fonts are likely to perform a font scan on startup which might slow them down.\n\nA: I think it should not cause serious performance issues for \"normal\" use, but as already pointed out some graphics programs need to scan the fonts at startup (because they need more info from the fonts than the fontconfig database provides) and those will start significantly slower, of course.  Also, when fontconfig updates its database (e.g. when you add additional fonts), that might be slower too.\nAnd finding a particular font in the list of available fonts might become a human performance issue...  ;)\nSo it's probably best to use a font management tool like font-manager or fontmatrix, so that you can enable/disable individual fonts or groups of fonts.\nBTW, you can count the number of currently installed fonts using the following command:\n$ fc-list | wc -l\n2083\n\n(Those 2000+ fonts aren't an issue on my system...)\n", "Q: Missing title bars of every window Recently I did re-install empathy, and installed Pidgin.

More recent Ubuntus will probably remove useful software with the apt remove command, so be sure to check what is being removed and if needed \"cherrypick\" packages in synaptic or similar.\n\nA: A easier way to remove Samba that is simpler and cleaner. \nsudo apt-get autoremove samba samba-common\nThis step uses the autoremove to remove the package.\nsudo apt-get purge samba samba-common\nThis step cleans any configuration file you may have\n\nA: These solutions all relay on the system booting. But what do you do if your system is not booting because of samba? \nIf you are stuck in recovery mode, IE the rescue disk. apt-get does not always work, in fact it will get you a seg fault in a recovery shell, atleast on Ubuntu from what I've seen. To get around that, you can use dpkg --purge --force-all samba and also for common and winbind if the system still wont boot. \nRemember if you are in the recorvery mode shell, do not use sudo, because that will cause a seg fault. Just use the commands as you would if you were in as root.\nBut I have had Samba cause a system to stop booting, and this is how I was able to rip samba out, and then do a clean install after I got the system booting all the way up again. Once it's booted all the way up, go through and do the sudo apt-get remove --purge samba samba-common command to make sure everything has been removed. Unfortunately, you may also have to manually delete some items, because dpkg does not always delete startup scripts and other items the binary creates. This is what I've had to do, to thoroughly remove samba, when I couldn't get the system to boot.  \nI hope this helps someone who was stuck in the same situation as me. \n\nA: I recently installed Ubuntu 17.04 under VirtualBox on a Windows 7 host and I needed to access files on the host. I'm fairly new to Linux so I thought I needed samba to access those shares.  As mentioned above by dpb, I was having client problems.  It turned out all I really needed to do was remove samba.  Having Ubuntu 17.04 meant I had to re-install cifs-utils, not smbclient in order to get client functionality back:\nsudo apt-get install cifs-utils\n\nAfter reboot, all my Windows network shares were accessible and client issues resolved.\n", "Q: How can I get permanent 5.1 sound? I have a Lenovo Ideapad y510 with 5.1 sound and worked perfectly on Windows.\nI read a guide to get 5.1 sound on Ubuntu which proposes to do the following.\nEdit /etc/pulse/daemon.conf and change the default-sample-channels from 2 to 6.\nThen edit /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base and add the line\noptions snd-hda-intel model=3stack-6ch-dig\n\nand restart the system.\nAfter the first reboot the sound works perfectly, but when I power off or restart the machine the sound does not work.\nHow can I make those changes permanent?\n\nA: Try setting the sound profile the normal way first. Click the little speaker icon at the top right of the desktop and choose 'Sound Settings...'. Click the Hardware tab in the window that comes up, and click on your audio device to configure. Then click on 'Profile:' and choose the profile you want, 5.1 in your case. You may have more than one 5.1 option, depending on your setup and motherboard outputs. Test that it works and then restart. The settings you changed should stick.\n\nA: I was too having trouble using 5.1 channels; this youtube video solved it for me:\n How to setup ubuntu to use all surround sound speakers ...\n", "Q: Where are the network manager configuration files?

Basically, can be stored in two places.  On my oneiric box, I see most everything under /etc/NetworkManager.\n", "Q: Problem installing Java I have not used the Ubuntu software center or the apt-get for java installation.

I see that the jre1.6_0 is installed in the Downloads directory itself. Now I am stuck. Where should the jre folder typically be? usr/bin is it??

To install (and since you seem to be handy with the terminal):\nsudo apt-get install dbf2mysql\n\nthis is the manpage.\n\nA: There is a dbf2mysql tool in the Ubuntu software repositories.  I never used it, but from the description it seems to do what you want?\n\nA: An important thing to note is that, as stated in the man page:\n\nmysql2dbf can't write MEMO files at this time.\n\nThe other day, I converted one file using dbf2mysql and thought my problems with this were over. Unfortunately, I then spent the next 6 hours trying to resolve the issue of one of my largest files failing to be written into MySQL.\nThere were no errors thrown at all, it simply wouldn't write. I went through a plethora of steps, including changing the buffer size, etc... to no avail, before realising that it was a MEMO file.\nI'm new to all of this, so in order to help other newbies out I'll let you in on the secret. The only way to know that you are dealing with a MEMO file, as produced by Visual FoxPro (as far as I know, anyway) is that it has 3 companion files ending with .cdx (which they all have), .dbt, and .fpt. \n\n\n*\n\n*.dbf = The database file you are trying to convert, of course.\n\n*.cdx = A type of compound index file.\n\n*.dbt = Contains the MEMO text itself, but could not be opened with a text editor.\n\n*.fpt = Contains the MEMO header record.\n\n\nI was fortunate enough to have one with only 2 of the 3 companion files, .fpt and .cdx... which DID convert. So, through the process of elimination, it is the .fpt file, or MEMO header record, which is the offending file. Simply moving that file out of the directory doesn't work, unfortunately. \nI'm sure there is a way around it, unfortunately I don't know which yet. However, when (and I do mean 'when') I resolve this, I'll post it here.\n", "Q: Empathy unable to automatically connect at startup I have a problem with Empathy being unable to automatically connect at startup.

Workrave package had removed from Oneiric, and setting for blocking screen removed from Gnome 3 (it was in keyboard settings in Gnome 2). Is there any alternative to control working time on computer in Ubuntu 11.10?\n\nA: I think Workrave wasn't really removed from Oneiric, but rather waiting on a fix so that it would actually work.  I saw that today it got uploaded into the Oneiric Backports.  \nMake sure you have the backports repository enabled in your software sources, and also make sure that the package list is up-to-date, then you should be able to install/update it again.  (I don't know about integration into gnome 3 though.)\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I enable the \"backports\" repository?\n\nA: Yes, there are rsibreak and xwrits.

I had this problem when I was using wubi, and I thought a full install would fix it but most of the time when I boot up ubuntu, after about 15 seconds on the desktop, it freezes, neither the mouse does not move  nor clicking does not work, key combinations don't work. I am a relative n00b to linux but is there any way to fix this?\n\nA: Try this: connect the Internet with wired cable first, then start your computer. If every thing is good, then the most probably problem is the Ethernet card and the wireless card share the same ID. If this is the case, you simply make PCI Lan disabled in BIOS. \n\nA: It sounds like you might be experiencing a bug where Acer Aspire One's tend to freeze while trying to connect to a wireless network. A simple way to test it out (and to fix it if this is the problem) is to set \"Network Boot\" as the top priority in your BIOS's boot order. You can do this by pressing F2 to enter your BIOS settings. Navigate to the \"Boot\" setting and move \"Network Boot\" to a higher position than your hard drive (Preferably the top).\nIf the freezing still happens, you can undo this by moving network boot back to a lower priority. \nSource: http://bernaerts.dyndns.org/linux/202-ubuntu-acer-ao722\n\nA: \nI was able to trace a similar problem to the rtkit-daemon, or perhaps\none of the processes that use it (the last entry in the syslog\nalways had rtkit in it).\nAfter reading the man page for the rtkit-daemon, I tried adding\nthe line \nRLIMIT_RTTIME=1\n\nto the file\n/usr/share/dbus_1/system_services/org.freedesktop.Realtime\n\nWorked, to my great surprise. The 1 above was just an arbitrary guess.\n", "Q: Which is the right location i.e. partition to install ubuntu 11.10 using wubi? As the wubi installer gives you all options for all partitions on Hard Disk which is the right and good option to select? On C: where windows 7 installed or another D: ?\n\nA: It doesn't make a difference. Wubi uses a virtual disk and that can be stored on any partition. If you have more space on one partition, then it might be more convenient to use. But there is no requirement or difference between one or the other. Note that the max space you can use for Wubi is 30GB.\nAdditional info:\nThis may not apply to you,  if all your partitions are NTFS, but the 11.10 Wubi doesn't support a standalone installation (using just wubi.exe) on a FAT32 partition at the moment (see this bug).  If you have a FAT32 partition then you should either install using a downloaded Desktop CD ISO or use your NTFS partition as there is a size limit of 4GB on FAT32 file systems.\n", "Q: Converting .mov to file compatible with my Sony PlayStation 3 without losing quality I read the latest post on Canonical Design on a film titled \"Press Pause Play\" here:\nhttp://design.canonical.com/2011/11/when-humans-make-stuff-we-tend-to-make-interesting-things/\nI have been on the official website and downloaded the 1080p version of the film, the only available format to download is .MOV which is not compatible to play on the PlayStation 3.\nHow would I convert the file to something playable on the PlayStation without losing the 1080p HD video quality?\n\nA: You will lose quality (unavoidable, any time you transcode you lose quality), although it might not be noticeable. You can use a program such as handbrake (downloadable from their PPA, see http://handbrake.fr/downloads.php )\nIt no longer has a preset for PS3, but a quick search found these instructions.\nAdding PS3 template to handbrake (from Ubuntu Forums)\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the template and rename it to PS3.plist\n\n*Open Handbrake, go to bottom left corner, click on 'Options' then 'Import' and choose PS3.plist\n\n\nTranscode the video\n\n\n*\n\n*Load the source video into Handbrake\n\n*Select the PS3 template from the right pane\n\n*Click transcode and wait for the process to finish\n\n", "Q: How can I swap CAPSLOCK for BACKSPACE? I want to swap Capslock with Backspace and came only so far as to mix them both together. By that I mean: hitting Capslock does work like the Backspace key, but also activates Caps (including the LED).\nWhen I was using Gnome, the Keyboard Settings would let me easily do the switch. In XFCE these options are missing, so I tried via .Xmodmap and xkeycaps. Xkeycaps even lets me export the stuff to .Xmodmap, but somehow it does not work. I'm missing something here!\nCurrent .Xmodmap (commented out because it gives errors \"bad keysym in remove modifier list 'Caps_Lock', no corresponding keycodes\", this was mostly described in forums)\nkeycode  66 = BackSpace\n! remove Lock    = Caps_Lock\nremove Mod5    = Mode_switch Mode_switch\n\nReferencing xmodmap to load in .profile etc did not work either.\nI could live with installing the Gnome-Keyboard Settings tool on my xfce system, if nothing else helps - which package is it?\nEDIT:\nsetxkbmap -option caps:backspace works, BUT: key does not repeat on holding down UNLESS i use xmodmap -e \"clear Lock\" as well. Not quite elegant, but apparently working.\n\nA: To close this one, I'll add my current fix. Maybe someone can use it too. Put this in a script, autostart it with DE:\nsetxkbmap -option caps:backspace\nsetxkbmap -option shift:both_capslock\nxmodmap -e \"clear Lock\"\n\n\nA: You can actually make some changes to your keys exchange. Click on power icon, on the extreme top right hand corner of your screen. Select 'System Settings' and double-click on 'Keyboard Layout'. Locate 'Option' at the popup box and click on it. Look for 'CAPS Lock Key Behavior' and click on the arrow before that option, from the drop-down menu select 'Make Caps lock additional Backspace'. I hope that answers your question. Thank you.  \n\nA: When I swap keys in .xmodmap I always give two commands like this:\nkeycode key1 = function key2\nkeycode key2 = function key1\n", "Q: I can't see or use common UI elements I'm using Ubuntu 11.10 for a few days on my laptop and today Unity hang up.

Using the NVidia graphics (I installed the driver nvidia-current), I can hook up two external monitors (two external monitors is not possible using Intel graphics).\nHere's the issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*I sometimes use the laptop on battery. When on battery, I would like to use Intel graphics, since it uses less power.\n\n*When starting the computer on battery, I enter BIOS setup to disable NVidia and enable Intel graphics.\n\n*When I tried this I got a blank screen after the NVidia driver loaded.\n\n*My question: How do I set up the OS so it uses the correct drivers in this case?\n\n*It doesn't have to be automatic, I would be perfectly happy to make a manual selection at some point during the boot process.\n\n\nA: You will have to black list the Nvidia driver from the kernel modules. \nTo be sure that the Nvidia driver is causing your problems you should check your syslog right when your pc hangs. Or if you can get to a terminal run the command modprobe -l nvidia to see if the driver is loaded.\nTo blacklist the driver add the line blacklist nvidia to the end of your /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf file.\n\nA: Blacklisting certain modules can be done using the boot option modprobe.blacklist. Instructions on creating a boot entry for that can be found in a similar question, Choose at GRUB menu whether NVidia driver should be used\n", "Q: How to auto mount disk drives in gnome-shell? I have 1 usb disk and 1 esata disk plugged in my pc.\nWhen I log in gnome-shell the usb one is mounted automatically.\nIs there any way to mount the esata disk too, without modifying fstab?\n\nA: No.  The system assumes that sata disks are internal, and therefore, does not auto mount them if they don't have an fstab entry.  Is there a reason you don't want to add an fstab entry?\n\nA: A better and easier way to do that in Gnome3.4 (with Gnome-Shell) is using the GNOME Disk Utility. \nI had to go for that because Ubuntu did not like de AriOS package (warning said it's bad software) and the pySDM is not that clear about the partitions. I always get confused trying to remember wich one is /sda1 or /sda3 or what so ever. It should show the labels!\nThe Gnome Disk Utility is really great. You can find it at Activities > Aplications > System Tools > Disks (sorry, not sure 'cos I'm using the brazilian-portuguese translation).\nTks!\nFor my brazilian fellows now:\nA melhor opção é usar o aplicativo Discos do Gnome (gnome-shell). Vá em Atividades > Aplicativos > Ferramentas de Sistema > Discos. Clique na partição e no ícone de configurações abaixo dela. Lá, desative a montagem automática e escolha a opção LABEL no último menu, pois essa opção monta a partição com o nome (label) que você deu para ela no Windows.\n\nA: There is a system service (man udisks(7)) that handle a mounting jobs in cooperation with udev. You can write udev rule to mark your esata disk as external and partitions on disk as automountable. Something like that:\nKERNEL==\"sd[b-z]\", SUBSYSTEM==\"block\", SUBSYSTEMS!=\"usb\", ENV{UDISKS_SYSTEM_INTERNAL}=\"0\"\nKERNEL==\"sd[b-z][1-9]\", SUBSYSTEM==\"block\", SUBSYSTEMS!=\"usb\", ENV{UDISKS_AUTOMOUNT_HINT}=\"always\"\n\nTo play around with this, try udisks console tool with --mount, --unmount, & --monitor options.\nIt works for me on Ubuntu 12.04.1 GNOME3 Fallback session\n", "Q: How do I configure a TiVo remote? I would like to use my TiVo remote instead of the streamzap one. Has anyone setup a Tivo remote with Mythbuntu and if so would you share your configurations (lircd.conf/lircrc) and experiences?\n\nA: Ended up using irrecord to get this working. in case anyone else needs the same, here is how I did it:\n\n*\n\n*Kill mythfrontend and mtd as both had grabbed the lirc device\n\n\n*su - root\n\n\n*irrecord --device=/dev/lirc0 Tivo (this may be different depending on your IR devices)\n\n\n*Follow learning directions. Basically, it has you press all the buttons for a second to determine the signal length, then it has you teach the remote buttons. It asks you to name the buttons and press the button on the remote.\n\n\n*When done, you are left with a lirc config file named Tivo. Copy this to the lirc remotes directory just to keep things in the same place.\nmkdir /usr/share/lirc/remotes/tivo && cp Tivo /usr/share/lirc/remote/tivo/\n\n\n*You could do this by editing the lircd.conf but I used the Mythbuntu Control Center to do it. Launch Control Center and goto the IR section. Select \"Custom\" from the dropdown menu and click on the Configuration and select remotes/tivo/Tivo. I tried to use Generate dynamic Button mappings but that didnt work for me so you can leave that unchecked and do it manually.\n\n\n*Click Apply and let it write the changes.\n\n\n*Edit the ~/.lirc/mythtv file to put your mappings in. Basically I used one that I had already had buttons mapped for a Streamzap remote. All i had to do was replace the remote name eachtime it after the \"begin\" line for the button. Since I named my remote config in step 3, \"Tivo\" I just did a global search and replace with vi. This is case sensitive and wont work if you dont have it correct. If in question look at the name in the file you generated in the irrecord step. For each button/function i looked at what I named the buttons in the Tivo config file...for example instead of \"Menu\" for the Menu button on the remote to send the \"M\" character, I changed it to \"Tivo\" for the Tivo button on the remote. When pressed it now sends the \"M\" signal and brings up the menu. Once again this is case sensitive so just refer to you Tivo remote config you made.\nI am still adding new buttons and trying to figure out if can fake macros with it...like bringing up the program guide with one button. Also need to do my mplayer lirc as well. So far it works solid. I have attached my config files but I recommend going the irrecord route as there a lot of different Tivo remotes..and you remote sends different signals based on what position the 1/2 switch is in. Also this should work for any remote...not just Tivo\n", "Q: How to keep a bright screen with battery power? \nPossible Duplicate:\nAlways be 100% bright when I'm using battery \n\nIt would seem that one would go to the power settings, and adjust the amount of time before the screen becomes dim, but unlike the nice images displayed in Always be 100% bright when I'm using battery, my power settings have no options for the length of time until the screen dims.\nHere's what my power settings look like:\n\nHow can I prevent the 10-seconding dimming screen, when on battery power?\n\nA: Go to Screen in options in System Settings and remove the tick mark in Dim Display\n\n", "Q: Best versions of ubuntu for thinkpad T21 Anybody have any experiences about installing Ubuntu onto a Thinkpad T21?

I closed the netbook and when I opened it again, a couple of hours later, I could not move the pointer with the touchpad.\nI can not get the pointer to move. I cleaned the touchpad surface well, just in case. Everything else is working fine. All the software updates are up-to-date. I have rebooted several times with no solution. I have attached an USB mouse and the pointer works well. What can I do to troubleshoot the problem? \nI have gone to the System Settings, touchpad section, and there is not much that I can do there.

Thank you for reading this note.\n\nA: My daughter complained that the touchpad had stopped working on her Acer Aspire One Happy2 that runs Ubuntu 11.10. It turned out she had accidentally pressed Fn + F7 which disables the touchpad rather than Fn + F8 to mute.\nPressing Fn + F7 brought it back to life.\n\nA: It's a problem with IRQ handling between mouse and touchpad. So, run these two commands to restart the driver:\nsudo rmmod psmouse\nsudo modprobe psmouse\n\nThis will make touchpad to work again.\n\nA: This is a way to create a file that fixed my Aspire One, so I'm sharing it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Terminal \n\n*cd /etc/modprobe.d/\n\n*gksudo gedit options.conf\n\n*In the text editor, type: options psmouse proto=imps\n\n*Save the file and close it. \n\n*sudo modprobe -r psmouse\n\n*sudo modprobe psmouse\n\nA: It's possible that you used a function key on the keyboard to disable the touchpad.\n\nA: There is actual a bug in Ubuntu 11.10\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/oneiric/+source/xserver-xorg-input-synaptics/+bug/868400\n", "Q: Remove terminal first message I have just installed Ubuntu 11.10 and I am getting this message:\nTo run a command as administrator (user \"root\"), use \"sudo <command>\".\nSee \"man sudo_root\" for details.\n\nevery time I run a terminal window.

I have generated an RSA public / private key pair using ssh-keygen. However, I am prompted to enter the password to unlock it the first time it is used each session. How can I automatically have it unlocked after login?\nEven better: since this is running on an Ubuntu server, it would be great if it was never locked at all - that way the automated daemons that need it would not require manual intervention to use it.\n\nA: For reusage of encrypted key use ssh-agent. It prints some output containing environment variables that you have to export. Then add keys with ssh-add.\nYou have to unlock your key only once until ssh-agent is running.\n\nA: I may be mistaken here, but it sounds like what you're trying to do is to not need to unlock your key every time it is used?\nIf that's the case, it seems like the easiest solution would be to just not create a passphrase while creating the key.  i.e. run \nssh-keygen\n\nand when it asks for a passphrase, just press enter twice. I apologize if this is too simplistic, but it's what I've always done when creating keys so I don't need to unlock them.

Have a nice day. :)\n\nA: Hey go for following link\nhttp://www.sysprobs.com/install-virtualbox-guest-additions-on-ubuntu-11-10-2d-and-3d-unity-issues\nhope this helps\nNaveen Arora\n", "Q: Suspend when critically low power 11.10 Is there a way to suspend when Ubuntu is at critically low power. The only option in Ubuntu 11.10 power setting is to shutdown or hibernate. I run my battery all the way down till it suspends then i plug it in. It gets annoying when my computer hibernates at critically low power.\nThanks in advance for the help\n\nA: Not sure why power settings only offers hibernate or shutdown.\nYou can change the option to suspend using dconf-editor:\nBrowse to org->gnome->settings-daemon->plugins->power, and change the value of critical-battery-action to \"suspend\".   \n\nA: Just a hunch, but I believe that at critically low power, the system doesn't have enough power to even sustain suspend mode - yes, the suspend mode, though is low on power consumption, draws power to keep data on the RAM. So, even if the system suspends, it will immediately power off. This is probably why jpd's solution didn't work.\nWhy I believe so? I've noticed that after the system powers off due to critically low power it is impossible (at least on my laptop) to turn it on without plugging it in. So critically low power must mean 'cannot carry on' and not 'just 5 minutes left' or something like that.\nI think what you want is for the system to suspend when about 10 minutes of battery is left. I don't know how to attack that problem, but I believe Unity notifies you about this. In my case this notification is sufficient.\n\nA: On my machine the current state of the battery can be read-off from /proc/acpi/battery/BAT1/state\nSample content of this file:\npresent:                 yes\ncapacity state:          ok\ncharging state:          charging\npresent rate:            749 mA\nremaining capacity:      530 mAh\npresent voltage:         11200 mV\n\nYou can locate the appropriate file on your machine and use this to suspend when battery is in critically low power. The following python script will do it for you:\n#!/usr/bin/python\nimport os\nimport time\n\nbattery_state_file = \"/proc/acpi/battery/BAT1/state\"\ncritically_low_power = 500\nsuspend_command = \"sudo pm-suspend\"\n\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep(1)\n    f = open(battery_state_file)\n    content = f.read().split('\\n')\n    f.close()\n    if content[2].split()[2] == \"discharging\":\n        if int(content[4].split()[2]) < 500:\n            os.system(suspend_command)\n\nSave this to a file (say) suspendscript, make it executable, add suspendscript & to .xsessionrc in your home folder, logout and log back in.\nYou have to set battery_state_file and critically_low_power appropriately. If remaining capacity drops below 'critically_low_power' mAh, the system will suspend. Optional: You can, if you want, use \"present rate\" and \"remaining capacity\" to find \"expected time left\" (= \"remaining cap.\"/\"present rate\" hours) and suspend if time left drops below a certain threshold.\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*This code will have to be modified if the content of the statefile is not in the same format as the sample content given above.\n\n*sudo pm-suspend requires the sudoer to give his password. You have to make pm-suspend sudoable without password. See how: How do I run specific sudo commands without a password? .\nAlternatively, you can change suspend_command to simply pm-suspend and add sudo suspendscript & to .xsessionrc and make suspendscript sudoable without password.\n\n*If you use this script, you have to set 'critically low power action' to 'do nothing' in gnome-power-manager settings.\n\n\nA: See my comment on Touchpad stopped working on an Acer AspireOne D255E - I think your problem is with the pm-utils package, too.\n", "Q: VGA not detected after upgrading Ubuntu my desktop PC using ati radeon hd 4350, when i installed ubuntu 11.04 and running application for checking and install  propertary VGA driver (jockey-gtk) then my 11.04 screen resolution, activating desktop effect compiz,etc  works well.\nbut the problems comes after i upgraded ubuntu from 11.04 to 11.10 , i can't login to my account but works by using guest account. and my 11.10 not detecting  ati radeon hd 4350 although i reinstall then reactivated the propertary driver.\nThanks for any suggestion and help.\n\nA: AMD Catalyst 11.10 is out by now.

Should I use btrfs (with discard, compress=lzo and space_cache options) or Ext4 (with discard option) for the SSD for my Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric) amd64 desktop root partition of my office machine?  \n/home will be an HDD so fs reliability affects OS not my data.\n\nA: For those stumbling on this question in 2016... Use ext4.  I tried btrfs and the difference is substantial.  Over a 10-day period write IOs to ext4 amounted to 17,800 sectors.  Btrfs?  490,400 sectors.  Same SSD, identical filesystem, different partitions.  Basically, same workload.\nBoth ext4 and btrfs go \"quiet\" when there is zero write activity on the drive.  That's good.\nExt4 will write the modified data, plus some overhead.  Overhead relates to the data written.  A 4K write (1 block) pushes about 50-80 blocks of overhead at the next commit. (The ext4 Journal is fully enabled)\nModify a single 4K block on btrfs and you'll push between 4000-5000 blocks of overhead at the next commit.  Default commit is 30 seconds, I believe.  I used 120.\nNow, it depends on how you use the SSD. As root, there is typically a fairly constant, low level, stream of writes going on. Log files, ntp drift files, man db rebuilds, opensm topology updates, etc, etc.  Each event will hammer a btrfs drive with another 4000-5000 writes.\nThe 10 day numbers above are for my \"write limited\" SSD.  The bulk of those 17,800 sectors were the result of a smallish system update.  One the btrfs copy did not suffer.  My writers are, exactly, ntp drift, opensm topology, and man db updates (nightly). Nothing else hits that disk, except actively initiated things like system upgrades, vim /etc/whatever, etc.\nOn whole SSDs will suffer a lot of writes, really.  I just can't see the point in wasting them just 'cuz the news media is chasing bunnies and rainbows. If you want to pay this price for COW, go for it.  For \"performance\", not so much.  It's an SSD and you could probably put the worst \"file system\" known to man on it, and still get some level of performance - just by brute force.  Ext4 is, by far, not the worst file system known to man.  \nNo monthly fs check.  Try the script below.  It's a 100% hack, won't work for md mountpoints,\n#! /bin/bash\ndev=`cat /proc/mounts | grep \" $1 \" | awk '{print $1}'`\nx=`basename $dev`\nvmnam=`lsblk $dev -o MOUNTPOINT,PKNAME | grep \"$1\" | awk '{print $2}'`\nvmx=`vmstat -d | grep $vmnam | awk '{print $8}'`\nlbax=`smartctl -a $dev | grep LBA | awk '{print $10}'`\ntmpnam=`mktemp XXX`\necho \"Tracking device: $dev, mounted on $1 (vmstat on $vmnam)\"\ntim=`date +%s`\ntimx=`date +%s`\nwhile true\ndo\n    vm=`vmstat -d | grep \"$vmnam\" | awk '{print $8}'`\n    lba=`smartctl -a $dev | grep LBA | awk '{print $10}'`\n    if [ \"$vm\" != \"$vmx\" ]\n    then\n        tim=`date +%s`\n        dif=`dc <<< \"$vm $vmx - p\"`\n        lbad=`dc <<< \"$lba $lbax - p\"`\n        timd=`dc <<< \"$tim $timx - p\"`\n        echo `date` \" (sec=$timd) writes=$vm (dif=$dif) (lba=$lbad)\"\n        vmx=\"$vm\"\n        lbax=\"$lba\"\n        timx=\"$tim\"\n        find \"$1\" -mount -newer \"$tmpnam\" -print | grep -v \"/tmp\"\n        touch \"$tmpnam\" \n    fi\n    sleep 1 \ndone\n\nIt will tell you how many blocks were written, according to the drive itself, and exactly which files were updated. Needs root privs.  See for yourself.  I run SSD on root filesystem, and call the script stat.sh.  So... sudo ./stat.sh /\n\nA: The last time I tested it, and I haven't heard differently yet anywhere, ext4 eats solid-state media. (thumbdrives, solid-state drives, etc.)  I don't recommend using it on such a device.  Use ext3 instead.  For most cases on SSD you won't be able to tell the difference anyway.\nBTRFS is not yet quite stable.  However, it is stable enough for non-critical applications.  It is what I use for making bootable flash drives.  If you use compress=zlib and ssd as your mount options the compression will make up for the lower write speeds of most solid-state media and the ssd changes the allocation algorithm to one that performs significantly better on such devices and will make up for any poor wear-levelling by the hardware.  The one performance area that's still an issue is that sync calls are slow.  This is not a problem for general use, but dpkg calls sync after every operation, so installing and updating software can be slow.  BTRFS also offers snapshotting and other advanced features that are quite useful under certain circumstances.   \nIf you decide to go with BTRFS, be sure to use a distro using kernel 3.2.0-2 or later.  3.1.x is workable if necessary.  For older kernels you'll need to compile the latest BTRFS modules yourself.  The in-built ones are almost stable, but the error-correction doesn't work in the older versions, which can leave you up a creek if something goes wrong.  The latest versions have fsck that can actually repair the most common faults.\nOne final caveat, I have heard reports that swapfiles on a BTRFS filesystem will corrupt it.  This issue may well have been fixed, but be sure to check carefully before implementing one.\nIf you need any help getting a BTRFS setup configured the way you want, let me know.  I've done a couple of crazy ones that work rather nicely for specific things.\n\nA: I would not use ext4 on a solid state drive based on anecdotal evidence and my own experience that suggests ext4 can greatly diminish the lifetime of a SSD due to the number of reads and writes associated with the file system.  One article I recently read suggested that unoptimized (accounting for page size, etc.) ext4 on an SSD can cut the disk life in half.  After a week of trouble shooting, I've come to the conclusion that my own SSDs have only lasted eight months due to this issue.  If you use an SSD, do lots of reading on how to optimize the file system based on things like flash page size which may be different than the typical cylinder size the file system is set up for.\n\nA: According to the tests by phoronix it always depends on many factors. In one case Btrfs will be doing much better than EXT4 when reading large files on an SSD. Similarly while considering Disk transaction performance, Ext4 can perform better than the later.\nYou can have a look through these tests here, here and here (WARNING: Lengthy articles).\nBut summing altogether, Btrfs right now does not have a quantitative performance advantage over the EXT4 file-system, Even when using in the SSD mode.\nSo you can choose over Ext4 for now.\n", "Q: What version of Qt is supposed to be in 11.10? I recently installed Ubuntu 11.10. In distrowatch the version of Qt is 4.7.4. In installation is 4.7.4 too. But I think it's not the real Qt 4.7.4! Because there is no Persian translation in /usr/share/qt4/translation. In archlinux everything is ok but in Ubuntu Qt looks to be 4.7.3 :-/ \n\nA: No, it's not incorrect. It is in fact 4:4.7.4-0ubuntu8. The source package is qt4-x11 and the corresponding Launchpad page lists the version number.\nWhat you are missing is the translation file for a specific language. The language files are from the libqtcore4 package. Just to make sure Ubuntu did not drop a language by mistake, we can try looking at the Debian version of this package. For comparison:\n\n\n*\n\n*The list of files in the Debian libqtcore4 package. (18 files)\n\n*The list of files in the Ubuntu libqtcore4 package. (19 files)\n\n\nAdditionally the source code contains a translations directory, where the language files are located. There is an interesting statement in the README file:\n\nThe French, German, and Simplified Chinese translation files are\n  supported by Qt. All other translations are contributed by third\n  parties. These are provided without guarantees and may disappear from\n  future Qt releases.\n\nIf any translation files are missing from package, they might not be officially supported.\n(I've checked the Arch Linux version of the package. There are indeed  more translation files: 30. Scroll down to the bottom of the page. My bet is to „borrow” the ones you need.)\n", "Q: Can I change the vertical scaling independent from the horizontal scaling when using my Bamboo stylus in Relative mode? Can I change the vertical scaling independent from the horizontal scaling when using my stylus in Relative mode?\nI use a Wacom Bamboo Pen & Touch, with the stylus in Relative mode (instead of the default Absolute). I use two monitors side-by-side, giving me a screen area of 3840x1080 pixels (3.5 aspect ratio). The tablet is 14720x9200 \"units\" (1.6 aspect ratio).\nIf I move my stylus 1 cm in the horizontal direction it will move much further on the screen than if I move it in the vertical direction (3.5/1.6 = 2.18 times further). How can I change this?\nI have tried changing two settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Area, as suggested in a related answer, but this seems to affect only the active area of the physical tablet\n\n*Coordinate Transformation Matrix, but this seems to only have an effect in Absolute mode.\n\n\nA: After sending a message to the wacom developers mailing list:\n\nThe two settings used above can not resolve the issue. It is a\nbug in X server/XInput.\nThe problem lies in the difference between x, y scales. We used to\nunify the scale in wacom_drv.so when mapping and screen information\nwere considered inside the driver (in linuxwacom package). The\nevidence of this work is still in the comments of xf86-input-wacom.\nRefer to line 611 of wcmCommon.c[*]. However, the actual scale match\ncan not be fully implemented inside the driver any more since the new\nfactorX/Y does not have screen info.\nScreen information and relative mode acceleration are pushed out into\nX server. Mapping and scale unification should be processed by in X\nserver/Xinput too.\nSo, by design, the scale is unified so users can draw circles in\nrelative mode, without changing settings. - Ping Cheng (Full Email)\n\nAnd then from Peter:\n\nyeah, that's a bug in the server, this should be exposed by the ptraccel\ncode but it isn't yet. I've never found the time to properly investigate\nwhere it's going wrong, but you can even see this behaviour when you add a\nmonitor - suddenly the acceleration factor goes up by a fair bit.\nAs Ping said, this cannot be fixed in the driver, we need the server to\nhandle this correctly. - Peter Hutterer (Full Email)\n\nIn conclusion, I think the best action is to report the bug and champion a developer to sort through the code to get a fix in place.\n", "Q: One of my user accounts logs in without desktop environment When I log in to my main user account on Ubuntu 11.10 ,the desktop environment (unity bar, clock, volume control, etc.) is not there.

Meaning that the amd64 versions will probably work for this script, but dpkg can't see that.\nI'm afraid, your best way around this is probably to edit that .deb, and remove the problematic dependencies. Somebody wrote a script to help with that.\n", "Q: How do you build older gcc versions? Errors about crti.o not being found How can I build an older gcc (specifically, 4.5.2) on Ubuntu 11.10 and avoid errors about \"/usr/bin/ld: cannot find crti.o: No such file or directory\"?\nI've done a bit of digging and found several similar items, but none that actually resolve my issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've verified all my packages (libc6-dev and the like) are re-installed per this question\n\n*I've verified crti.o exists in /usr/lib32 and /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu, and that my ld.so.conf is configured to look in those directories\n\n*I've verified that prepending my make invocation with LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu works, but would like to avoid this (it becomes a diverging point in makefiles)\n\n*I've tried various things with --with-build-sysroot, but with no success (read: maybe I just don't know the right flag to set)\n\n*When running with strace (as per this answer), I can see the bare reference to crti.o:\n13240 open(\"crti.o\", O_RDONLY)          = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)\nThanks!\n\nA: I had the same problem. Making symbolic links from /usr/libs/crt?.o  to /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/crt?.o solved the problem for me.\n\nA: I solved this problem with a couple of workarounds that might be useful for you.\nFirst, build GCC with LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu, so that the build bootstrap process knows where to find the crt?.o start files.\nThen, instead of making crt?.o symlinks in /usr/lib where they affect your whole system, you can symlink those three files into the ${prefix}/lib/gcc/... directory corresponding to the ${prefix}/bin directory that the gcc executable is installed in.  That's actually almost at the top of its search path for the start files, so it will find them -- but they don't affect anything else.\nIn my case, the specific directory to put them in was lib/gcc/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/4.3.2/; you can find the right one because it already has other files like crtbegin.o in it.\n\nA: Even very new versions of GCC fail with that message. It's because the new Debian/Ubuntu releases (will) support multiarch (i.e. installing binaries for multiple machines in one file-system), so the libraries have been moved away from the standard places.\nThere are GCC patches to fix it here (not yet approved final versions, but correct for Ubuntu), and they probably apply to older GCC without much effort, maybe. I think you need to configure GCC with --enable-multiarch, or something.\nIn the meantime, creating soft links is a good fixup:\ncd /usr/lib\nln -s x86_64-linux-gnu/crt*.o .\n\n(the folder name will be different on 32-bit installations).\nHope that helps.\n\nA: I built GCC 4.1.2 on Ubuntu precise x86_64. As you did, I took a look at the strace of last command \"xgcc\" looking for 32bit c runtime, grep-ped /32/ as follows.\nC runtime in mine is in /usr/lib32 which is provided by libc6-dev-i386 package.\nfgrep /32/ strace-output.txt | grep /usr/lib | head -1\naccess(\"/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/4.1.2/32/crti.o\", R_OK) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)\n\nSo, I created the crt?.o symlinks in the directory xgcc looked for.\nsudo mkdir -p /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/4.1.2/32\ncd /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/4.1.2/32\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib32/crt1.o \nsudo ln -s /usr/lib32/crtn.o \nsudo ln -s /usr/lib32/crti.o \n\nI successfully built GCC 4.1.2 with it.\n", "Q: One of my user accounts logs in without system sounds One of my user accounts logs in without system sounds in Ubuntu 11.10.\nAll other sounds works well, I can listen music, see movies, etc without a problem.\nSystem sounds like errors, login, shut down, etc don't play.\nThanks for any help.\n\nA: Enable system sounds in System -> Preferences -> Sound. Maybe the output volume for system sound is set to zero or a low level.\nThen check, whether there is a \"startup application\" called \"GNOME Login sound\" and that it is enabled. If it does not exist, create a new one with the following command:\n/usr/bin/canberra-gtk-play --id=\"desktop-login\" --description=\"GNOME Login\"\n\n\nA: Thanks for the help Michael. Your solution didn't solved the problem but gave me some ideas to search in another direction. The command in terminal gave me some errors and after a couple hours of searching here's the solution taked from another place:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal then type dconf-editor\n\n*Navigate to org.gnome.desktop.sound in dconf-editor. The value for the key named \"theme-name\" should be \"ubuntu\" and not \"freedesktop\"\nThat error happens when the default sound settings its changed in Sound Preferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*When changing alert sound to \"Default,\" the value of \"theme-name\" in dconf should revert to \"ubuntu\", not \"freedesktop\".\n\n*When choosing an alert sound other than \"Default\", users will not reasonably expect that many of their other system sounds will disappear. Only the alert sound itself should change.\nSolution taken from other site by the member Jay S\n", "Q: How can I resize and shrink a BTRFS partition? I have my /home on a BTRFS partition and I need to shrink it.\nUnfortunately, Gparted does not have the resize option for this FS.\nCan I resize it in any other way without losing my data?\n\nA: According to this page in the btrfs wiki:\n\nTo shrink the filesystem by 4 GiB: btrfs filesystem resize -4g /mnt or btrfsctl -r -4g /mnt Set the FS size . To set the filesystem to a specific size, omit the leading + or - from the size.\n\nThe btrfs and btrfsctl commands in Ubuntu is provided by the package called btrfs-utils, which you can install in the Software Center. You run these commands in the Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T). Replace 4g by however much you really want to shrink the partition, and /mnt by the mount point of the partition. For example, to shrink a btrfs partition mounted at /media/Alpha by 500 MiB, you  would run:\nbtrfs filesystem resize -500m /media/Alpha\nOr:\nbtrfsctl -r -500m /media/Alpha\nAssuming the guidelines for resizing btrfs filesystems are the same as for other filesystems, you should avoid resizing a partition that is on the same physical disk as the running system. So, if necessary, boot from a live system to resize a partition on the drive that has your installed Ubuntu system. (This applies to resizing done in GParted, too.)\nIf some utilities or applications don't see the results of the resizing operation when it is performed, rebooting is a good idea.\nSee the btrfs and btrfsctl manual pages for more details about the use of these commands. And hopefully the btrfs wiki will be back up soon.\nI am not personally very familiar with btrfs filesystems, but it seems strange to me that these resize commands take the mount point of the filesystem rather than the device name.  If anyone can explain that, please comment or feel free to edit this answer to improve it.\n\nA: According to the GParted features page, btrfs shrink is supported.  If the option isn't available, installing the btrfs-tools package may fix it.  If that doesn't work, it could be because Ubuntu includes an older version of GParted, in which case you could use the GParted Live CD:\nhttp://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php\n(which is also how Ubuntu recommends using it anyway)\n\nA: Use this command to install btrfs support in GParted:\nsudo apt install btrfs-progs\n\nAfter that you can easily shrink and resize your partition in GParted. This way you can do all the work in GUI. No command line needed\n", "Q: Ubuntu DVR - what are the options? According to my research, the best solution to use ubuntu server as a DVR system would be ZoneMinder. is there any alternatives to zoneminder out there?\nI'm not really happy it only has a web interface to control/view my cameras.

Am I missing something in its configuration?\nAnd the thing I really disappointed, I cant find a way to control my PTZ camera with it.\nwhat do manufacturers sell along with their standalone linux powered dvr systems?\n\nA: As you mentioned the best solution is Zoneminder.\nIf you are using the 11.10 version of Ubuntu the 1.24.4 version of Zoneminder is there. along with the mythzoneminder to give a friendlier way to watch the videos.\nFor specific stuff about zoneminder and how it handles the devices I suggest:\nSupport Page - http://www.zoneminder.com/support\nForum - http://www.zoneminder.com/forums/\n", "Q: Why are the MythVideo settings blank in the frontend in MythTV 0.22 and later? In the MythTV 0.22 frontend, why are the default settings blank? Why are these not populated to the correct content directory?\n\nA: MythTV 0.22 introduces Storage Groups for MythVideo. These are setup by default for you in mythtv-setup, and will conflict with the local frontend settings if the paths are the same. Local MythVideo settings will not use the MythTV protocol to transfer videos between your frontends. See MythVideo - Local Video Storage\n", "Q: Why can't I play ISO's in MythTV 0.22? When trying to play any video in MythVideo that is an ISO, it fails to play. Playing other types of videos is fine. \n\nA: Storage Groups are a streaming method of transmitting material to a frontend, meaning they don't provide block-level access to the file in question. An ISO is a disk image, and libdvdnav/libdvdcss, the libraries used to view DVDs/DVD images, requires block-level access. See MythVideo - Disadvantages\nThis is resolved in MythTV 0.24 and later\n", "Q: How to make the GNOME Music Player Client (GMPC) my prefered ubuntu music player application?

Its a music player daemon. You have to choose a folder to add songs to its library. \nYou cannot use mpd to play a single file. If you want to play a file, first you have to add it to the library and then update the database & then add that file to the current playlist.\ngmpc is just a GUI client to control that daemon.\nSo, its mpd thats doing the work, NOT gmpc.\n", "Q: Why doesn't (Xine, VLC, etc) work on MythTV 0.22 and later?

I've just used recently Debian and I'm using Windows 7, and one thing that really gets on my nerves is the alt-tab feature: to access the second program it's easy: alt-tab switches instantaneously from the current window to the next one. But if I want to access quickly to the third program I have to wait something like 1/2 second, and that's really annoying, because as a developper, I'm always switching between my shell, Firefox, and the third one, Firebug Window.\nIs there something I could do to make alt-switching fast when accessing other windows than the next? I don't know, maybe remove an effect (I'm currently with the option \"visual effects : normal\").\n\nA: It sounds like you might be waiting for the application switcher to appear on screen before pressing Tab again.

Despite the fact there is more than enough room on my screen, Firefox page-right-click menu usually appears pretty small and offers vertical scrolling to view all the items inside it.

I have one idea:\nCan I put a minimum delay on click events in X/XInput/whatever-mice-use?\nIf I could put a 50ms barrier in there, I'm certain it wouldn't affect me but it would nuke the bug.\nObviously if you're familiar with how to fix the bug outright, I also want to hear from you!\n\nA: Turns out this problem was caused by a hardware fault in both mice. I fixed it by opening up my mouse and hosing down both the wheel and all the button swictes with compressed contact cleaner.\nUnfortunately this dissolved the grease on the mousewheel rigging so I had to apply fresh silicone grease to these parts.\nAll in all, an £8 spend to bring a £100 mouse back to life seems like a fair deal.

But this option doesn't show up. I'm not an expert at using the advanced installing mode, but this could be the key to get this done.\nSo, my question is: How can I install Ubuntu alongside Lubuntu, without changing the Lubuntu setup?\n\nA: There is a dual-boot guide on the Ubuntu Documentation pages.

We're looking at deploying 12.04 across the entire enterprise (several hundred desktops).  We've selected KDE as the default desktop for all users for the current distribution but we have a policy where people can run Unity or Gnome3 if they want to.\nWhat is the best deployment approach?  Is it installing kubuntu and then installing the appropriate gnome packages.  If so, then which gnome packages?\nOr is it installing ubuntu and then getting KDE recognized in /usr/share/gnome-session/sessions?  If so, which packages to install?\n\nA: If you install Kubuntu across all computers (which I would suggest since it seems like you have decided that KDE will be the default desktop environment), users who want to run Unity or Gnome Shell can run either of the following commands:\nFor Unity:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nFor Gnome Shell (commonly referred to as Gnome3):\nsudo apt-get install gnome-shell\n\nOr Gnome Fallback (similar to classic Gnome)\nsudo apt-get install gnome-fallback\n\nAlternatively either package can be searched for and installed from Ubuntu-Software-Center.\nUsers will then be able to choose their desired desktop session when they log in. (this will be automatically set up, and should be fairly obvious, I just forget how KDE's login screen shows it, so I won't say exactly).\n\nA: Well I had installed ubuntu then installed all the desktop environments like Gnome-Shell, Xfce and KDE and everything works fine. But still there is lot of fine tuning which I had to do with each Desktop Environment installed especially with KDE since gnome applications look awkward in the first instance while using them in KDE.

The easiest solution is to first uninstall the new driver you have installed and then reinstall one from a ppa or the ubuntu repos. \nTo Uninstall (might not be necessary, but less chance of mistakes)\nI can't quite remember which method I used because this was a few months ago, and I break my system a lot. \nIf you still have the .run file from NVIDIA's website you should be able to run the command:\n/path/to/nvidia-XXXX.run --uninstall\n\nObviously replacing the \"/path/to\" path with the file system path. If you don't know how to enter that, just open a terminal and drag and drop the nvidia-XXXX.run file into the terminal and type --uninstall after it.\nAlternatively (I'm not sure if this actually uninstalls the nvidia driver, but this is what I did I think, so I maybe I didn't even uninstall the old driver before updating :P)\nsudo apt-get remove nvidia-current\n\nTo re-install the standard driver\nEasy, just a couple commands.\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nand then you can restart.

So, I went to connection manager/etho config/IPV6 an set it up to IGNORE. Restart my laptop and problem solved.\n", "Q: Nvidia GTS450, turn on nvidia drivers = blank screen after boot I know this is possibly a duplicate of Blank screen after installing nvidia restricted driver. But now 11.10 has been released.  Is this issue near to being resolved?\nI've even uninstalled the nouveau drivers and have installed the unified drivers from nvidia, I get the same.  Upon reboot the system boots up, I see the root prompt flash up and then it tries to load up unity but then the screen goes blank and the monitor turns off.\nNow on the 7th installation of 11.10 and this time I think I will leave as is.  As a side issue, XFCE has a 3d drivers option which works for me, as I was just running 11.04 today.  Why this option is unavailable for Ubuntu, I am unsure...\nAny help appreciated!  Thanks\n\nA: There are still nVidia issues/problems.  I can only speak from experience that I've had trying to install 11.10 with a EVGA GeForce nVidia graphics card.\nDid you make sure to pull the driver from the repository?\nDid you try to blacklist the other drivers?\nAlso, I found this to be a helpful thread.\nNVIDIA drivers not working after upgrade. Why can I only see terminal?\n\nA: Actually, I found in the monitor section that my monitors where set to mirror.  I changed that and now they are both working out of the box.  So really I have no need for the nvidia drivers as this is really just a development box.\n", "Q: Enable [command] key to register as something other than [ctrl] under VMWare Fusion? I'm running 10.04LTS inside VMWare Fusion on a Mac.\nThe Command key (aka Windows on many keyboards) is almost always behaving as if it was Ctrl, even though I done anything explicit to request that behavior.\nIn fact, in System>Preferences>Keyboard>Layouts>Options>Alt/Win key behavior, 'default' is chosen (rather than the 'Control is mapped to Win keys' option). However, choosing other options there do not seem to change the handling of Command, at least not as tested in the System>Preference>Keyboard Shortcuts app. (No matter what I've tried, Command-X is always detected as Ctrl-X in that app.)\nI've tried:\n\n*\n\n*various options under System>Preferences>Keyboard>Layouts>Options>Alt/Win key behavior\n\n*toggling the VMWare Fusion > Preferences > KKeyboard & Mouse > Key Mappings setup which claims to map 'Command' to 'Windows', and restarting the VM in each position\n\n*the xmodmap lines suggested at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MappingWindowsKey\nAnd yet, it's clear that all Ubuntu apps aren't merging Ctrl and Command, because in 'Terminal', Shift-Ctrl-C will Copy, but Shift-Command-C will not.\nIf the Command/Windows key was recognized as anything else ('Super', 'Meta', 'Hyper'? I don't care as long as it's not 'Control'), then I could achieve my real goal (which happens to be enabling CMD-based cut/copy/paste in PyCharm, while leaving Ctrl-X/etc available for emacs-like bindings). I think any solution which manages to make Command-X appear as something other than Ctrl-X in Preferences>Keyboard Shortcuts will probably do the trick.\n\nA: Translating the Cmd key to Ctrl within the VM is a VMware Fusion feature. I believe it can be disabled from either the VMware Fusion global preferences or the individual VM settings.\n", "Q: Why when I retrieve the list of partitions it only gives me one result? When I type\nsudo fdisk -l\nit just gives me 1 partition (I have 2 partitions for Ubuntu and Windows 7).\nSee the full result:\nDisk /dev/sda: 320.1 GB, 320071851520 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 38913 cylinders, total 625140335 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x2b15104e\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *        2048   625137663   312567808    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n\nI think this is the Windows 7 partition.\nNote: I installed Ubuntu using the Wubi installer for Windows.\n\nA: As explained in this answer to another (unfortunately, closed) question, the key fact you mention here is that you used Wubi to install Ubuntu. Thus, Ubuntu is installed like an additional Windows program within your Windows partition, specifically in C:\\ubuntu (see this guide from the Ubuntu Wiki for more information). No separate partition was created for Ubuntu at setup.\n", "Q: How to stop \"aptd\" from maxing out my CPU? After running the \"top\" command in the terminal, I see \"aptd\" running which causes the cpu to run at 100%. If I'm updating the system, or installing a software, I see it. I only recently noticed it. Is there anyway to stop it or tell me what is its function?\n\nA: aptd is the service that installs software for Ubuntu Software Center and Update Manager.  It runs as a separate, background process so that the installer can have root privileges while the GUI runs under your own user ID.\nYou should not stop aptd while software is installing: killing it will interrupt the installation, and possibly break the package system.\nIf you are not installing software and still see aptd using CPU time, then it's likely that you have the system set to automatically check for updates; those automatic update checks also use aptd.\n\nA: In addition to the above information, if you notice that it is running for a long time - say an hour or more, it may be necessary to kill it.  I ran into that when the Synaptic Package Manager appeared to be not responding for an extended period of time.  After force closing it from the GUI, I found a couple instances of aptd and several other related processes running, and eventually I had to kill them.\nIn my case, I found that it was necessary to run the following commands to recover:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh -a\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu onto another drive while running Ubuntu Is there a way to install ubuntu onto a separate drive while running ubuntu? I know I can do it with via CD or USB but I don't have those at my disposal right now.\n\nA: Sure, but AFAIK, there is not fancy wizard.  You need to build the partitions and filesystems yourself manually, then you run debootstrap, to do the base install.  Add the required kernel packages, and a few other non-base packages, then manually adjust your boot loader configuration.\nThere are many guides out there that cover the specific details, this procedure is commonly used for building virtual machines, livecds, chroot environments, and so on.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.google.com/search?q=debootstrap+howto\n\n*https://www.google.com/search?q=debootstrap+howto+ubuntu\n", "Q: Keyboard resetting on log in I recently switched to the Colemak layout after a fresh install of 11.10.

If not you can find a more detailed description of how to install a theme in 11.10 here.\n\nA: there is only a temporary fix right now to make it work, since it is a bug!\nfirst of all you need to create a hidden folder called .themes within your root folder.\nsudo su          (type in your pwd)\nmkdir ~/.themes  (creates the \"hidden\" .themes folder in your root directory)\nnow install the shell extension for gnome-tweak-tool:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/gnome3\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gnome-shell-extensions-user-theme\n\ninstall dconfEditor with ubuntu software center and put your theme folder of choice on your desktop, then copy it into the .themes folder like so:\nsudo cp -r /home/username/Desktop/themeFolder ~/.themes\n\nopen up dconfEditor and browser through the tabs as followed:\n\norg > gnome > shell > extensions > user-theme\n  now type in your exact theme-name of the folder you copied into the .themes and into the values field of the right window.\n\nafter that is done you can open gnome-tweak-tool to chose your theme from the \"> theme > shell theme\" tab.\nit is some work of course but it works for now.\nyou always can deactivate the extension of course from gnome-tweak-tool > shell extensions.\n", "Q: Tools to diagnose Ubuntu problems Over time a user will have several problems with Ubuntu as any other OS in the world. What tools and terminal commands exist in Ubuntu to help diagnose how the problem occurred and help solve it if it can be done.\nProblems like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Freezes after X time or when using Y app\n\n*Ubuntu rebooted/hibernated/suspended all by itself\n\n*Ubuntu not showing video or video has problems\n\n*Ubuntu not making any sound or sound has problems\n\n*Ubuntu not reading X drive (Pen drive, Internal Drive, External Drive...)\n\n*Ubuntu slow\n\n*Ubuntu not working with X hardware when connected\n\n*Ubuntu network problem\n\n\nNormally there is a couple of GUI tools or Terminal commands that Ubuntu experts typically mention first to use to do a first diagnosis of this. What GUI tools (in case the problem is not related to video or limits the user from using the GUI) and Terminal commands (In case GUI is not working) can a user use to diagnose and help himself to how to find/fix the problem.\n\nA: In the terminal exist a number of tools to do a preliminary diagnosis:\nBefore mentioning some of the tools remember that adding --help to any of the commands will normally throw you some help for the command. For example dmesg --help. Why do I mention this, because most of the time this will give you very good information about how to use the command, make it more verbose or simple or how to output some info. The --help parameter is one of 3 that can show you information about a command. The other 2 are info and man. For example man dmesg or info dmesg. This 2 show more info about a command. In the order of --help showing you less help and man showing you the most.\nThe following list is a small list of commands I use to check problems:\ndmesg - Shows Boot Up Message and other Kernel related messages like device connections (When you plug in a new device eg: external hard drives, webcams, bluetooth devices...). Type dmesg in console and it will show you how the system booted up. If you have hard drive problems or any other booting problem they might show here.\nlshw - It shows you the Hardware List for all devices connected and in the PC.\nlsusb - It shows you all USB devices connected.\nlscpu - Shows you basic CPU information.\nlspci - Shows you all PCI devices (Video Card, Sound Card, Capture Card...)\nlsb_release -a - Shows you the Ubuntu Version, Codename, Release..\nlspcmcia - Shows you all pcmcia devices connected to the PC.\nlshal - Shows you all devices registered with HAL. If the device uses HAL it will appear.\nlsmod - Shows you all modules loaded with the kernel\nmodprobe - Adds or Removes modules to and from the kernel.\nlsblk - Shows you all block devices. In normal language it means it shows you a nice little list of how you partitioned you hard drives, size of each partition, where it is mounted, etc...\nfsck - Used to fix several filesystem errors. DO NOT USE IT ON A MOUNTED PARTITION!. This is similar to chkdsk on Windows but with steroids.\nX(Capital letter X) - The X system. If you have xorg.conf problems you can do X --configure to create a new xorg.conf and X -config XORGFILE to test a xorg.conf (XORGFILE is the path and name of the xorg.conf file). X also does many MANY things.\nxrandr - To change, check and do custom changes to the resolution.\ndmidecode - Shows memory specific information. Needs sudo to run.\nadd-apt-repository / apt-add-repository - Used to add PPAs. For example add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa. saves from having to add it manually and then add the key for it.\napt-get - Default installer for packages in Ubuntu. Example: apt-get install wine1.3\naptitude - Excellent installer for packages in Ubuntu. Example: aptitude install wine1.3. Includes search options, cleaning and other in one single command. This are also included in the apt packages but divided in several commands.\nalsamixer - Sound mixer in console. This solves some sound problems related to microphone not working, sound not very loud...\ndpkg - Official package manager for debian based packages.\ndf - shows free space and used space for each partition/mounted device.\nglxinfo - Used to show OpenGL information about the video card. Needs to install the mesa-util package to use it.\nglxheads - Used to show basic OpenGL video card information. Video card name, OpenGL version and Vendor.\nhdparm - Used to check and perform several actions/tests/checks in regard to hard drives.\nnetstat - Shows you network connections, routing...\nnano / pico - My best friend. Edit files in the terminal. I know..I know. vi or vim. But it has a very weird learning curve and I want something \"user friendly\" and not \"hacker angry\". It is true there are many things you can do with vi but it is easier to learn nano or pico than to learn vi. I will actually learn vi before the end of the year.. it is on my wish/work list.\nntfsfix - Fixes some ntfs partition problems.\nwineserver - Manages wine apps. If you add the parameter -k like so wineserver -k it will close/kill any wine app opened. This will solve wine app problems that stay opened without closing or having some hanging problems.\ntestdisk - Recovers deleted partitions.\nphotorec - Recovers multiple files deleted overtime. Has a very good recovery percent.\nforemost - Recovers multiple file deleted overtime. Has a better recovery than photorec in several formats but since it has not been updated since 2007 photorec with the work done in it has much of it surpassed it. Version 6.13 Beta is many times better. Although I still use both just in case.\nparted - Partition manipulation software. Nice one.\nfdisk - Similar to parted. Very good also.\nssh - Remote control protocol. Without this about 90% of all remote assistance for me would be gone.\nkill - Kills a specific process using its ID. Add the parameter -9 to it to kill it with a machine gun filled with velociraptors holding scissors with bullets. Example: kill -9 12345\nkillall - Similar to kill but using the process name. Example: killall lightdm. You can also use the -9 parameter but using it with the ID as in the kill command.\ntop - Shows you all process active, zombies and whatnot. Real time check.\nps - Shows to a list of runnin process. Not in real time as in top. Add the paramater -ex to it to see a better list of the process with name, locations, parent ID... . Example: ps -ex\n\nA: Since error logs are one of the most common tools to diagnose issues, tail -f logfile can be a very helpful command - if the behavior can be repeated. Many errors are logged to /var/log/Xorg.0.log and ~/.xsession-errors while running X; errors in X itself to the first, and errors in programs running inside of X to the second. While opening the log file in a text editor may be possible, watching the log file in an open terminal with this command allows the user to see the last ten lines logged, followed by any errors as they are added to the log in realtime, allowing a user to more easily associate error messages with the issue needing troubleshooting. A user can simply 'tail' a log file, and then try to reproduce the error, watching for new lines to appear. Since this command will run forever, Ctrl-C can be used to return to a prompt.\nOther logs can be helpful to watch, such as /var/log/dmesg for messages from the kernel, for example, relating to USB devices as they are plugged in, hard disk failures, and other hardware issues. Many times just searching the internet for a particular logged error can point a user to others who have documented the same issue, or help provide specifics to those trying to help.\n\nA: There is a HW Probe Tool that collects outputs of popular Linux diagnostics tools (like smartctl, memtester, etc.), hardware \"listers\" (hwinfo, inxi, dmidecode, biosdecode, etc.), and system logs (Xorg.log, dmesg, etc.).\nThis Docker image can be used to probe hardware on Ubuntu without the need to install anything on your host except Docker.\nProbe example: https://linux-hardware.org/?probe=0b29192f95\n", "Q: Redirection Doesn't Work I want to put my program's output into a file.

Using Ubuntu 11.10 and Vmware Player 4.0.\nEvery time when I open the vmware player, the last library was not there (it was just blank). I can manually add it and it is working then.\nAnyone experienced this?\n\nA: The real source of the problem: VMware Player stores its Library of the used machines in ~/.recently-used.xbel. But GTK3 changed the location of this file to ~/.local/share/. And ~/.recently-used.xbel is cleared on the regular basis, so the list of machines becomes empty. (Some insight can be found here: http://communities.vmware.com/message/1714765 and here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gtk+3.0/+bug/1007336).\nAs we cannot change the behavior of VMware, we can use the workaround. Use the wrapper script to run VMware Player:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncp ~/.vmware/.recently-used.xbel ~\n/usr/bin/vmplayer\nsleep 5\nmv ~/.recently-used.xbel ~/.vmware/\n\nSave it somewhere in your home folder, make it executable and change the launcher which starts your VMware Player to run this script instead. It will store the list of your machines till the next launch of VMware. It was tested with Ubuntu 12.04.1 and VMware Player 5.0.0.\nBTW: The answer which got the bounty is wrong. Running VMware Player with superuser privilege won't help you to save the Library. Moreover, it's definitely bad advice to use sudo in this case.\n\nA: It looks like vmware player has no permissions to write to the file (or directory) where it tries to save the library.\nThis can happen if, e.g. you use sudo to run it once -- it'll then create files as root inside your home directory.\nThe fix would be to find all the files that belong to root in your home -- in a terminal do\nsudo find $HOME -uid 0 -exec chown $USER:$USER {} +\n\nIn the future never use sudo with graphical application to prevent this kind of issue -- use gksudo instead.\n\nA: I have encountered the same problem on ubuntu 11.10. Try to run the vmplayer with root privilege, typing sudo vmplayer in the terminal. And the virtual machine you have run won't be missing. \nHowever, I have no idea about how to solve this problem with the normal user's privilege. \n\nA: In order to save your vmplayer library across reboots, do following:\n\n\n*\n\n*download .bundle executable from vmware website\n\n*sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-'uname -r'\n\n*navigate to directory containing downloaded .bundle\n\n*gksudo bash ./VMware-Player-*.bundle\n\nA: Run these commands:\nrm ~/.recently-used.xbel\nln ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel ~/.recently-used.xbel\n\nThis will fix the problem. The reason as to why this is required can be found in whtyger's answer.\nThe fix will not persist over reboots, so you'll need to have this script automatically run each time your computer starts.\n\nA: Another option is that your preferences file in $HOME/.vmware is corrupted or can't be read from the current vmplayer installation. Delete it and run vmplayer again so it can create it again. Add you VMs into the library and check again.\n", "Q: Why doesn't 'w' or 'who' command show all logged in users?

Since HDF5 is currently not on the merge list, that might be a good way to go.\nSecond one - if you want to tackle the merge (there are updates to the package in Ubuntu, btw) is the merge process page.\nBoth of these pages will help with requesting the sync of an updated package and the process for performing the merge since there are changes to the package in Ubuntu that might be relevant to Precise.\n\nA: The Ubuntu wiki has (Requesting a new package for Ubuntu): https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment/NewPackages\nMore links\nFAQ: Requesting new packages / new versions / new features \n( http://www.kubuntuforums.net/showthread.php?54134-FAQ-Requesting-new-packages-new-versions-new-features )\n\nA: File a bug report on Launchpad and tag it with the upgrade-software-version tag.\nFor other tags see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bugs/Tags\n", "Q: Icon Theme doesn't change in e17 I just installed Enlightment (e17) and trying to change the icon theme doesn't seem to do anything, i also have LXDE installed and i'm trying to change the icons from the LXAppeareance application but it doesn't do anything.\nHow can i make e17 use the icons i want?, it keeps using the GNOME defualt icons.\n\nA: From Main Menu > Settings > Settings Panel > Look > Icon Theme.

I am using Ubuntu 11.10, and whenever I enter the recovery menu, my keyboard freezes and I can't make any selections. I have tried using GRUB_PRELOAD_MODULES=\"usb usb_keyboard\" but this doesn't help at all.\nThe keyboard works in the BIOS screen and in Grub (i can select an OS, write to the command line, etc.) but as soon as i get to the recovery menu it stops working. If i had the numlock on it will stay lit and i cannot turn it off, if that helps\n\nA: I had the same issue and finally got it resolved. \nI had to unplug all my usb devices besides the keyboard (maybe there was just one that caused the issue, but I didn't want to try all possibilities). I also had to add 'acpi=off nohz=off' to my boot line in grub (hit 'e' in grub while the recovery mode is selected to change the boot line).\n\nA: I had the same issue today, and with Johannes' answer was able to solve it - unplugging all USB devices except the keyboard worked.\nNote though - when I first tried adding the suggested 'acpi=off nohz=off' to the boot line in grub, the keyboard was still non-responsive in recovery mode.\nTrying again but NOT adding 'acpi=off nohz=off' did work.  \nAlso, tried various combinations of USB devices (mouse, keyboard, external USB HD, ext USB hub on monitor), and the only combination that worked was \"keyboard only\".   \nAlso tried adding/removing devices when the Recovery Menu was 'frozen' and it displayed alerts that devices were added or removed (always device 2 though).\n", "Q: How to get two-finger scolling to work?

I installed Ubuntu 11.10 on a brand new Lenovo Thinkpad W520, but no matter what I tried to do to enable wobbly windows, the setting wouldn't take effect.\n\nA: I finally discovered (after running lspci | grep VGA) that I had two graphics adapters enabled.\nThe issue was that this model of ThinkPad has a BIOS setting called \"Optimus\" that will switch between the integrated graphics adapter and the nVIDIA graphics adapter, upon request of the operating system. However, as is noted in the BIOS setting screen, this feature must be supported by the operating system and is not recommended unless running Windows 7.\nSwitching the display BIOS setting to \"Discrete\" forces the laptop to always use the nVIDIA graphics adapter, and after saving this setting wobbly windows and other compiz effects became enabled.\n\nA: Intall compiz config manager and you will have options to tweak your unity interface.

Say one wishes to have a list of blocked IP addresses.\nI have seen the following example script:\nBLOCKDB=\"/path/to/ip.blocked.file\"\n# omit comments lines\nIPS=$(grep -Ev \"^#\" $BLOCKDB)\nfor i in $IPS\ndo\n    iptables -A INPUT -s $i -j DROP\n    iptables -A OUTPUT -d $i -j DROP\ndone\n\nIs several thousand lines, which transform into several thousand iptables entries, sane?\nWhat is the top limit, beyond which, system efficiency will gets significantly affected?\n\nA: I think I have found a solution via this article and IPSet seems to be the answer\nIn sum:\nIf set of IP addresses contain thousands of items iptables performance decreases (actually, performance of netfilter, as soon as iptables is just a tool for managing firewall). Your CPU load can increase too. Fortunately there is a perfect solution – ipsets\nIPSet is the perfect tool if you want to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Store multiple IP addresses or port numbers and match against the\ncollection by iptables at one swoop; \n\n*Dynamically update iptables\nrules against IP addresses or ports without performance penalty;\n\n*Express complex IP address and ports based rulesets with one single\niptables rule and benefit from the speed of IP sets \n\n\nInstalling ipset is straight forward sudo apt-get install ipset\nThen run the following\nipset -N autoban iphash ––hashsize 4096 ––probes 2 ––resize 50\n\nAdd it to your iptables chain. It can differ depending on your firewall settings. Here we use ethin chain.\niptables -I ethin 2 -p tcp -m multiport ––dport 80,443 -m set ––match-set autoban src -j DROP\n\nNow you can add all bad IP to your ipset. For instance, you have text file called bots.txt with one IP per line. So you can add them to ipset using simple bash script:\nfor i in $( cat /tmp/bots.txt ) ; do ipset -A autoban $i ; done\n\nTo check run:\nipset -L autoban\n\n", "Q: Unable to use or install the wacom bamboo tablet i am trying to install wacom driver in ubuntu 11.10.

You do not have right to read the file.\nLet me quote (source):\n\n\"Execute\" means that this file can be executed as a program. So if\n  the file were a shell script or valid compiled executable (ELF format,\n  etc) named program_name, you could run ./program_name or, if this\n  directory were in your path, just program_name.

I'd love to use Ubuntu One or Dropbox features, like file storage and so on, but I don't want anyone else to access my data, USA Patriot act etc.. I want things to be encrypted so that the only place where info is decrypted is only my devices. Is that possible with Ubuntu One or Dropbox?\n\nA: The only good way to do this is to first encrypt the files locally, then move them to the Ubuntu One folder. If you make an encrypted partition or container and then choose to sync that with Ubuntu One, you risk syncing the unencrypted data. See here for one approach using encFS. It has it's limitations though.\nAn alternative is SpiderOak, which works like Ubuntu One but encrypts everything before it leaves your machine. They claim they have no way to recover your data if you forget your password, and it even has two-factor authentication. Last I tried it, it would slow down my machine for several minutes after booting while it scanned my drive, but this may have been fixed by now. Also, it's 2GB free vs Ubuntu One's free 5GB.\nHere is another Ask Ubuntu post detailing some of the issues you raise.\n\nA: I can propose you the Wuala service here: http://www.wuala.com/en as an alternative to Spideroak. Almost same functionalities.\nBut, if you really want to control the encryption yourself, I can propose you to use Ubuntu One and Déjà-Dup (backup tool) together. You use the server space of Ubuntu One for your data, but you upload the data through Déjà-Dup using a password. Déjà-Dup will encrypt the data with your password. I think this is the best solution: simple and secure.\n\nA: You could possibly make use of EncFS (http://www.arg0.net/encfs). Use the Ubuntu One directory to store the encrypted file system, while mounting it somewhere else. For example, using the following setup.\n\n\n*\n\n*~/Ubuntu One/.encrypted - the hidden encrypted files\n\n*~/Ubuntu One (encrypted)/ - the visible decrypted files\n\n\nThis however will make the number of files, directory and file structure, and their sizes visible, so it's not an ultimate solution.\nRead here for more details of how to set it up, and here for some basic information about advantages and disadvantages.\n\nA: Yes it is possible. The best way to archive this with a per file encryption is with encfs:\nThe general principle is that you have a (optionally hidden) encrypted folder inside UbuntuOne/Dropbox where your files are stored, but you access them though another folder, where the decrypted files are shown. Any File you add to the decrypted folder will be encrypted and put into the encrypted folder:\nDecrypted folder ←encfs→ Encrypted Folder (inside UbuntuOne/Dropbox)\nOn another computer the encrypted folder is synced by UbuntuOne/Dropbox and can also be decrypted on the fly. \nInstallation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install encfs version 1.7 or greater\nsudo apt-get install encfs\n\n\n*install gnome-encfs-manager:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gencfsm/ppa\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gnome-encfs-manager\n\nSetting up the Drive on the first computer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a (hidden) directory inside Dropbox/Ubuntu One to use as for the encrypted files\n\n*Start gnome-encfs-manager and set up a new stash (click on the plus sign)\n\n*Set the directory to encrypt to a (hidden) folder inside your Dropbox/Ubuntu one folder\n\n*Set the mount directory wherever you want (default is fine)\n\n*enter a good password (30 random chars...) and click \"Create\"\n\n*edit the new stash so it is mounted on startup and the password is saved in the gnome keyring\n\n\nYou should now have your encrypted drive mounted (it will be displayed like a mounted usb-drive)\nImporting the drive on other computers:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wait for all files to sync\n\n*Start gnome-encfs-manager and set up a new stash\n\n*Set the directory to the previously created folder inside your Dropbox/Ubuntu \n\n*encfs-manager will detect the drive and import it\n\n*Set the mount directory wherever you want (default is fine) and click \"Import\"\n\n*edit the new stash as desdribed above\n\n*you will be asked for your password on first mount\n\n\nCross Platform compatibility:\n\n\n*\n\n*This is cross compatible with Android when using Encdroid (open source, recommended) or Cryptonite (open source). Both Android Apps support Dropbox and should also work with UbuntuOne using local folder decryption (in combination with an UbuntuOne client which syncs your files onto the SD Card)\n\n*This is probably also compatible with windows using encfs4win or other software.\n\n\nA: I tried SpiderOak\nPros:\n    \"Zero knowledge\" concept built in from the ground, exactly what I was looking for.\nSuper easy setup on Ubuntu and Android phone.\n\nConcurrent file access AND encryption is there by design. \n\nCons:\n    Closed source client. I trust open source more, when it comes to security.\nCannot synchronize mobile phone directories to the cloud. Con only read\nwhat is stored, by downloading every file on demand.\n\nI chose to go with UbuntuOne + EncFs, since encryption layer is open source.\nStill, would very appreciate if UbuntuOne would implement \"Zero Knowledge\"\nconcept out of the box.\n\nNow I'm using SSHFS against own server to access large files like\nphoto / video collection.\npros:\n    No need to duplicate every file on every computer.\nNo monthly fees for keeping terabytes of data on the network.\n(because it's all on my once bought hardware)\n\ncons:\n    Useless on slow network connections or when offline.\nAnd I use GIT + GITCOLA for document registry.\npros:\n    Can work offline.\nHave history on previous directory/files states.\n\ncons:\n    Doesn't work well on binary files above 1 GB.\nSpace is consumed by local git repository AND checked out copy of files,\nso not good for huge video / photo collections.\n\nAnd I use UbuntuOne + EncFS for a few gigabytes of fast changing and temporary files, like Desktop directory. This way I can conveniently switch computers and continue working on the same in-progress files, even sometimes offline and without quickly growing GIT repository.\n\nA: CryFS\nDISCLAIMER: I'm one of the developers of the below project.\n\nThere is a relatively new open source project called Cryfs which was designed for encrypting your Dropbox (or other cloud storage).\nIt was built mainly because all existing encrypted file systems have their disadvantages when used with cloud storage.\n\n\n*\n\n*Encfs is not secure\n\n*Truecrypt/Veracrypt causes high network load and synchronization conflicts\n\n*eCryptfs isn't designed for cloud storage either\nFurthermore, CryFS not only encrypts your file contents, but also file sizes, metadata and directory structure, which is not true for the other tools except VeraCrypt.\nNot encrypting your file sizes and directory structure can give an attacker more information than you'd like to give them. A standard example is a file system with a lot of folders, ~20 files each and each file ~3MB, which is easily recognized to be a music CD collection, even if encrypted. Another example is storing a certain set of known files (say a Windows DVD). By looking at the directory structure and file sizes, someone having access to the encrypted files can easily figure out whether your file system contains it or not.\n\nA: You might want to take a look at the Gnome Encfs Manager project.\nIt implements an easy GUI way to organize one or multiple EncFS volumes (which you then can sync via Ubuntu One, Dropbox and similar services; maybe WebDAV also works).\nLook at Uli's answer for the details:\n\nYes it is possible. The best way to archieve this with a per file encryption is way is with encfs:\nThe general principle is that you have a (hidden) encrypted folder inside UbuntuOne/Dropbox where your files are stored, but you access them though another folder, where the decrypted files are shown. Any File you add to the decrypted folder will be encrypted and put into the encrypted folder:\nDecrypted folder ←encfs→ Encrypted Folder (inside UbuntuOne/Dropbox)\nOn another computer the encrypted folder is synced by UbuntuOne/Dropbox and can also be decrypted on the fly.\n\nI think, it's the way you have to think the least. Plus, it is open source.\n\nA: From TrueCrupt home page: WARNING: Using TrueCrypt is not secure as it may contain unfixed security issues.\n\nYou can also use truecrypt.\nBelow is a short summary of how can you use truecrypt (sources for detailed instructions are provided below):\n\n\n*\n\n*Download truecrypt from http://www.truecrypt.org/downloads and install it.\n\n*Open truecrypt and go to Volumes > Create New Volume.\n\n*Choose Create an encrypted file container.\n\n*Configure the container: place to store the file container, hashing and encryption algorithm, size of the container, passwords/keyfiles etc, and format the container.\n\n*From the main truecrypt window, select File button to locate the file you've created and press Mount.\n\n*Provide your password/keyfiles.\n\n*Now you can see file mounted in nautilus or any other file explorer.\n\n*After you're done dismount the volume.\n\n\nNow, you can upload this volume container to your Ubuntu One account.\nSources and further information:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Wiki - TrueCrypt\n\n*Official TrueCrypt Tutorial\n\n*Google Groups - encfs vs TrueCrypt\n\n*linux.livejournal.com - encfs vs TrueCrypt\n\nThis answer was not intended to be a comparison but below I'm mentioning advantages/disadvantages of using truecrypt for reference.\nThe advantages of using truecrypt (over encfs) are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*truecrypt is cross-platform. It is available for Windows, Linux, and Mac.\n\n*encfs uses FUSE to mount an encrypted directory onto another directory and thus file transfer is relatively slow.\n\n*encfs is file based. This means that everyone can actually see the number of files, permissions, approximate size, and the last time they were accessed or modified.\nThe disadvantages are:\n\n\n*\n\n*The encrypted volume is a fixed size volume, so the file would always occupy the maximum space. Whereas encfs uses space when you copy files.\n\n*ONE BIG DISADVANTAGE: Whenever you modify the encrypted volume, you'd have to download/upload the complete file to sync your Ubuntu One account.\n\nA: Ubuntu File storage is now dead. \nI use https://syncthing.net/ now.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open source.\n\n*Free and unlimited data storage.\n\n*Data is stored only on your devices.\n\n", "Q: How to install LLVMpipe?

It does not on Windows even at maximum volume.\nSome extra info about my setup\nThe computer is a Dell Inspiron 6000, with \"SigmaTel C Major Audio\" sound.  On Windows I'm using the default drivers from Dell, I didn't modify any settings, and I checked that no extra sound processing is enabled (e.g. 3D or bass boost or whatever that's available on some computers).   On Ubuntu 11.10 I'm also using the defaults.  There's no noticeable difference in the sound volume of Ubuntu and WinXP.\nQuestions\n\n*\n\n*Why is there a difference in sound quality?\nDoesn't the audio data that is sent by programs get \"rendered\" to speakers as-is?  Is there some extra processing, perhaps to compensate for the characteristics of the speakers or laptop case, akin to colour-management?\n\n\n*What can I do to fix this, and make Ubuntu sound as natural as Windows XP on my laptop?\n\nA: The same thing happened to me when I was using Ubuntu for the first time. The reason for me was that Ubuntu had the volume of speakers set to a too high value. Solving this problem is very easy:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using the sound indicator, open Sound Settings and set the sound volume slider at \"unamplified\", as shown in the image:\n\n\n\nI hope this solves the problem.\n\nA: I have noticed the same audio discrepancy that you have.\nI can't remember the name of it at the moment (haven't used Windows in a long time) but I do think there is an audio processor that enhances the audio on Windows.  I remember seeing something in the control panel about it.  Then again, maybe I'm crazy. :-P\nIf you don't see anything that stands out in the control panel, run alsamixer on Ubuntu, and check your levels that way.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Please check your mixer settings, I have a totally different experience, in Windows 7, my netbook sounds muted whereas in Ubuntu, it comes alive with more imaging.\n\nA: Have you tried installing alsa-hda-dkms from the ppa:ubuntu-audio-dev/alsa-daily repository?\nWorked for me when my laptop would start distorting like a tin-can.\n\nA: I have Ubuntu 14.04 on Macbook Pro 9,1.\nI solved the issue by going to 'System Settings'--> 'Sound'\nAnd selecting \"Speakers: Built-in Audio\" in 'Play sound through' option  . Originally 'Analog output' had been selected. That instantly fixed my sound problems and gave a crisper sound.\n\nA: I had a similar problem with Ubuntu 14.04 and my headphones. Installing equalizers did not help. There simply was no bass! In my case the solution was simple:\nThere was a huge difference between the front and the rear audio jack of my PC!\nThe front jack (for headphones) was much better. \nSo simply try to use the other jack?\n\nA: In Ubuntu, have you tried switching the '3D' acceleration setting of the sound card?  It might have defaulted to the 3D setting which may have boosted certain frequencies to add a to the stereo imaging of the laptop speakers.  How does it sound with headphones when you compare it in Windows?\n\nA: You could try Open Sound System (OSSv4) with production quality enabled in the ossxmix. Unfortunately this requiers building it from source and also removing ALSA, PulseAudio from your Ubuntu and setting applications backends to OSSv4.\nYou should post the output of lspci -v command (run it in terminal) for audio device section. When you will know what's your soundcard then you can check if it is supported by Open Sound System.\nUbuntu community documentation regarding OpenSound has commands for removing ALSA (reboot requiered) and of course installation of OSSv4 (including compiling from source). There is also the official guide regarding that process. Before you start the compilation open up software-properties-gtk application as root and check the source code on the first tab. Then update your software sources and run this command: \nsudo apt-get build-dep oss4-base\n\nYou should change configure script GRC_MAX_QUALITY=3 to GRC_MAX_QUALITY=6 that's for production quality resampler. Know you can build the .deb package.\nWhen all that is done than it's time for configuring applications. You can also emulate ALSA for applications that doesn't support OSSv4 edit /etc/asound.conf or .asoundrc as per instructions on Arch Linux OSSv4 Wiki.\n\nA: I've also had this problem. Finally found a solution, it really makes the sound much better.\nThe problem is with default Linux config.\nAdd the following lines to /etc/asound.conf (create the file if necessary)\npcm.!default {\ntype plug\nslave.pcm hw\n}\n\nThen copy-paste these lines to ~/.asoundrc (create the file if necessary)\ndefault-sample-format = float32ne\ndefault-sample-rate = 48000\nalternate-sample-rate = 44100\ndefault-sample-channels = 2\ndefault-fragments = 2\ndefault-fragment-size-msec = 125\nresample-method = soxr-vhq\nenable-lfe-remixing = no\nhigh-priority = yes\nnice-level = -11\nrealtime-scheduling = yes\nrealtime-priority = 9\nrlimit-rtprio = 9\nrlimit-rttime = -1\ndaemonize = no\n\nAfter that you should reload your music app for changes to take effect.\nSource: https://forum.manjaro.org/t/solved-terrible-sound-in-linux-much-better-in-windows/8203/6\nI removed one line from there because it caused an error for me.\nHope it helps!\n\nA: I also had the same problem on the sound quality even on the headset. I realised it was due to default sound profile set to HSP/HFP for my headset.\nI had to change it to High Fidelity Playback(A2DP Sink) which drastically changed the sound quality.\nUbuntu Sound Settings\n\nA: [I'm also facing the external speaker sound quality problem. To solve this problem follow simple steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*connect your wireless speaker .\n\n*go sound setting and select your wireless speaker.\n\n*and also important select MODE option show in the image.\n\n*and select Hight Fidelity Playback(A2DP Sink)\n\n\nand enjoy good quality sound ..\nthanks...]\n\n", "Q: Dell Vostro 3300 Wi-Fi LED not working I have a Dell Vostro 3300 which I use as a dual-boot.\nAll the LEDs work perfectly fine on Windows 7 but the Wi-Fi LED does not work on Ubuntu 11.10.

If you want to light-up the Led you need to blacklist brcmsmac and in some cases bcma as well and use proprietary driver. So what you may need is:\nTemporarily \nsudo rmmod brcmsmac\nsudo rmmod bcma\nsudo modprobe wl\n\nPermanently\nIn /etc/modprobe/blacklist-b43.conf add blacklist brcmsmac blacklist brcmfmac blacklist bcma\nI had to remove bcma module as well but it may not be the case with every card.

Nautilus has a specific function, which name I don't know, but the behavior is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Typing a symbol from the keyboard opens a small box on the lower right part of the window and selects the first relevant file or folder in the current folder in the window\n\n*typing more symbols selects the relevant file or folder  or no selection if the searched string doesn't exist in the current folder.\n\n*The backspace key deletes the last symbol used and again selects the appropriate file or folder.\nNow this was in Ubuntu natty 11.04, in Oneiric 11.10 the behavior is like in the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Typing a symbol selects relevant file/folder, i.e. same as in natty.\n\n*typing more symbols... - the same as in natty\n\n*Backspace opens the upper directory in the tree and the small search box in lower right corner stays with the last searched string. \n\n*Typing anything from the keyboard adds more to that string even in the new folder and the only way to search from the beginning is to select the string /with the mouse/ and delete it with del button /backspace returns in upper folder in the tree/ and type again to search. \nNot very user friendly and very annoying :-) \nNow, what should I do?

I have a monitor with a default resolution of 1920x1080 and have it set up with a second monitor with a default res of 1280x1024. However, my graphics card (ATI 2900Pro) states its max res to be  2560x1600, and ubuntu will not allow both displays combined to exceed this resolution. Is this likely to be hardware limited? Or can this maximum resolution be overridden in Ubuntu somewhere?\n*Edit - Further info requested.\nI have the proprietary ATI CCC (and drivers) installed, but this does not allow me to configure the resolution. \nI am configuring the resolution using the Displays control panel in Ubuntu. \nI have also tried manually editing the xorg.conf. However, whatever I do the system seems to realise that my card only supports the lower resolution and it ends up overlapping the two displays till they meet that resolution.\n\nA: You need to state:\n\n\n*\n\n*which driver you are using (Open source or Proprietary)\n\n*which tool(s) you are using to configure your driver\n\n\nBut, as a general guide,\nif your graphics card says that it will support  2560x1600 and yet the total \"displayable\" resolution that you want to display exceeds that then there is probably not much hope.\nYou may have some mileage experimenting with your /etc/X11/xorg.conf, specifying a suitable virtual area to match the desired total resolution, but I would expect this particular approach to work best with a dual display featuring consistent resolutions across both monitors.\nNote that if using the proprietary driver, you can generate a suitable Xorg.conf on the commandline using the \"aticonfig\" command.\nI found this to be more reliable than using the gui tool which crashed out all of the time.\nRunning the aticonfig command generated the following Xorg.conf for one of my machines running oneric ocelot:\n(Hint 1: please make sure the driver you state in Xorg.conf is installed before writing it into Xorg.conf, else your X-Server most likely won't start.)\n(Hint 2: Xorg.conf might not exist on your system.

Log out and log back in.\n\nA: I figured out & solved the problem:\nBecause of a LightDM bug, I was always logged into Unity. Then, on a terminal I would do:\ngnome-shell --replace &\nIf you do that, GNOME Shell does indeed start, but the programs' menubars are not visible. If I however circumvent the the LightDM bug and make sure I get logged into GNOME Shell right away, the menubars appear as expected. so this seems to be some kind of weird LightDM / Unity / GNOME Shell interaction bug. \n", "Q: How to make tail -f show time when line was appended?

I can only remove and add app icons to bar, but they always added at end, just before workspaces icon.\nIs there any nice way to reorganize icons except wiping all icons from unity bar and re-adding them in desired order?\n\nA: You need to click on the icon and keep the left mouse button down. After a few miliseconds, the two side arrows will disappear, then you can move the icon up/down.\n\nA: Just to add - \nIn unity-2d you can move icons up or down directly in the launcher - just l.click on & hold the click for about a sec. The icon will move slightly & then can be re-positioned\nIn unity-2d you can only move up or down inside the launcher unlike unity-3d where you can pull the icon out of the launcher\n\nA: A possible solution would be to use the dconf-editor. First install dconf-tools , then navigate to desktop>unity>launcher, and edit the list of favourites so that it is arranged as you like.\n\n\nA: If you click the icon, drag it outside the bar (to the right) and then place it where you would like it will work.

Just be careful that in the end you're using >> to append the old user accounts on to the new server's files and not > which would replace them.\n\nA: Depends on how users authenticated. It could be against /etc/passwd, external database, internal database or even LDAP.\nIf it's /etc/passwd — then you need just to recreate users and copy hashes from /etc/shadow on server A to server B.\nExternal/internal DB — just move data.\nLDAP — I don't really think that you are using this one ;)\n", "Q: Nautilus freezes if mounted SSHFS-Device is unreachable Using SSHFS to mount remote file systems in the user space, I have the problem that all instances of Nautilus use to freeze, if one of the mounted hosts is unreachable.

You can also choose to display results for All versions as opposed to just the Current version you are running (attempting to install extensions not compatible with your version of GNOME will result in a silent failure - the operation will not be successful but you will not be notified of this in any way - though extensions which are not compatible will be slightly greyed out in the results list so you will still be able to tell even with the All versions filter selected).\nThe different filters I mentioned above are accessibly through the relevant pull-down menus (I have put a red box around the settings in question):\n\nYou can also use the search box to find extensions, once you have found an extension you wish to install (if you are concerned about the safety of the extensions then you should read this information on the review process - go to the Are GNOME Shell extensions safe? section - extensions have to go through before they are accepted onto the website), click on its name in the search results, then once you are on its page click the ON/OFF slider next to its name (as done above in the gnome-tweak-tool), you will get a dialog prompting you if you wish to install the said extension, if you do, press Install, if you have changed your mind, press Cancel.\nIf you do not get such a dialog, you have just stumbled across one of your pre-installed extensions and activated it!\nOnce making changes to your installed/activated extensions from the website you will need to restart the gnome-tweak-tool in order for it to register the changes.\nManaging extensions\nIn order to activate an extension click on the ON/OFF slider next to its name and description so that its status changes from OFF to ON, (and visa-versa to deactivate it).\nYou will see that the pre-installed extensions have a greyed out Remove button next to each of them, this is greyed out because they are pre-installed, if you install a new one however you will be able to use this button to permanently remove it.\nYou will also see that some of the extensions have a button next to their Remove button that looks like this:\n\nClicking this button will enable you to alter the configuration for the extension in question (it should launch a settings window).\nThe online view enables you to also do similar (though it also allows you to remove/uninstall pre-installed extensions, so tread carefully - though of course you will be able to re-install them again).\nUpdating extensions\nThe gnome-tweak-tool does not support the upgrading of extensions through its interface (though in future it is planned for the whole web interface to be scrapped and for it all to be done through gnome-software), if a new version of an extension comes out and you wish to upgrade to it you may do so by going here and clicking upgrade button next to the ON/OFF slider (if there is no upgrade button then the extension is already up-to-date):\n\nYou will then be prompted if you would like to Upgrade the said extension, pressing Upgrade will upgrade it, however pressing the Cancel button will disable or possibly even uninstall it so that you will need to reinstall or reactivate it again.\nTips and Tricks:\nRight-clicking on the Activities Overview button (or Activities as it is normally called on the button) will bring up a window specifically dedicated to your GNOME Shell extensions:\n\n\nThis process should work for all those using GNOME 3.4+.\n\nA: \n(This answer was originally posted to a question titled Unable to install GNOME shell extensions using GNOME Tweaks in Ubuntu 18.04)\n\n\nThe extension installation feature is removed from GNOME Tweaks (since v3.26, the one in Ubuntu 17.10 if I remember correctly).\nTo manually install extensions, simply extract the archive you got from the official site and copy/move the extension folder (usually of the form extension-name@developer-info) to your ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/ directory.

Just click on the small wrench icon. A settings windows should appear as shown in the following screenshot.\n\nDeleting an extension\nYou can also delete an extension from the site provided that it didn't come with gnome-shell by default (which makes them installed into the system area).\nClicking the red cross mark should uninstall the extension. \n\n\nA: Ubuntu 20.04 and later\nIn Ubuntu 20.04 and later several popular GNOME Shell extensions are installed by default.

Given the following requirements and constraints:\n\n\n*\n\n*Purpose: light-weight VM host for local Windows (desktop and server) and Linux guests.\n\n*Host OS needs to be hardware compatible with Dell Inspiron 17R - N7110\n\n*\n\n*Intel Core i3-2310M (2.10 GHz)\n\n*640 GB SATA II HDD\n\n*6 GB DDR3 SDRAM\n\n*Intel Centrino Wireless-N 1030\n\n*Integrated Intel HD Graphics 3000 (up to 1.6 GB Dynamic Video Memory)\n\n\n*Need to be able to run 2 or 3 VM Guests at a time (3 would be rare and can live without, if not possible.)\n\n*Need to have network access from guests through the wireless card in the laptop (i.e., I should not have to depend on the wired LAN card.)\n\n*Guests need to be able to access USB storage connected to host (either directly or as a remote \"share\".)\n\n*Sound support for guests would be nice, but not critical.\n\n*Auto-starting a preferred VM at host start up would be nice (again, not critical.)\n\n\nWhich is my best option?\n\n\n*\n\n*I assume I need 64-bit host OS to access all the RAM.\n\n*Server or Desktop?\n\n*GUI or not (I assume so, even though it makes the host \"heavier\")?\n\n*KVM, VMware, or VirtualBox?\n\n\nCan some one help me weigh pros and cons (or point me to relevant online resources?)\nThank you very kindly,\nGrant Lindsay\n\nA: First of all, using Virtualbox or Vmware depends on your needs. You can check out those:\nhttps://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/VBox_vs_Others\nhttp://www.zdnet.com/blog/perlow/virtualization-smackdown-2-oracle-vm-virtualbox-32-vs-vmware-workstation-71/13020?pg=3&tag=content;siu-container\nAlso, you can find tons of comparison links between virtualization applications via Google. \nFor those you listed, either Virtualbox or Vmware can do any of it easily.\nIf you prefer 64bit OS, that would be nice. Using multiple guest VMs will surely eat your RAMs, also consider reserving a good Swap part. \nNetwork access via host machine is not a problem, you can easily do that. \nEach application has USB and sound support.\nYou can autostart any VM via some scripts or just commands.\nI recommend using server with a lightweight desktop, maybe Flubox. \nChoosing Virtualbox or Vmware is up to you. You can use Vmware server for free, Virtualbox is totally free as you can see. \n", "Q: How do I get my Kodak printer to work? I have a Kodak ESP C310 printer that I tried installing on my computer (Ubuntu 10.04), but it wouldn't even recognize the device.  So, I went on the Kodak site and talked to a representative online (after Googling and not finding anything helpful), and all they told me was that Kodak drivers do not support Linux or any form of Linux, like Ubuntu.  I asked them if they ever would, and the person told me they were working on it.  Well, that doesn't help me at all.  Has anyone been able to work around this problem of Kodak not supporting Linux?  I don't want my printer to go waste, I need it.\nThanks!\n\nA: As you've said, Kodak don't currently distribute Linux drivers for their machines, but the internet is a vast place, and, thanks to the amount of more advanced users using Ubuntu, their are some available.\nThey are not official, nor are they overly tested, but they do sometimes work.\nUnfortunately, there are known bugs with the C Series printers. Fortunately, you can download and install for free, here.\nThe project is called c2esp, for future reference.\n\nA: I have that model printer.  I use google cloud printing.

I knew something was wrong in the VMware core as VMware Player 4.0 and VMware Workstation 8.0 share it, but I wasn't sure what was wrong.\nBut I found the culprit.\nIt's the Routing and Remote Access service. I had it activated as I configured my Win7 box to accept incoming PPTP connections. Stopping it the problem goes away.\nAlso, there are other quirks associated with that. Besides the Ubuntu guest, I had a Win XP guest which could not make outbound PPTP connections when bridged. This was also fixed when disabling the RRAS service.\nGoogling this problem I found other reports about RRAS being the problem, e.g. http://www.codeblog.co.uk/2009/06/22/fixes-and-tweaks/vmware-duplicate-ping-responses/\n\nA: Additional information:\n\n\n*\n\n*the number of DUPS per ping increases if you re-install VMWARE Player\n\n*there are no DUPS if you run the same (identical) machine (vmdk disk) using Virtual Box\n\n\nConclusion: the problem is not in the network, nor in the Linux OS but somewhere in the VMWare configuration.

I am a Ubuntu fan from a long time (since 7.04), and recently I bought and Asus 1215N with Nvidia Optimus ION (... no comments here ....) with an Atom processor Dual Core to replace my Msi Wind U100 that became old.\nBut, with the use, I've noticed that Ubuntu, 10.10, 11.04 and even 11.10, is slower on my Asus 1215N that on my Msi Wind U100..\nI use Ubuntu like a charm on my Msi Wind U100, I can multitask, an using an operating system like Ubuntu is a very pleasent task, because Windows is extremly slow on this computer.

(Unity-2D works at the same speed or worse).\n\nA: what I can say is that is not the CPU's fault, the system slowdown is because of the HDD that the Netbook came with which is 5200 rpm, I suggest getting an 7200 or above if you want your system to fly as it should. me personally i got a SSD... hope it helps...\n\nA: the real problem is the fact that these kind of machines have a more complicated architecture that have to face a really important aspect in the software, in particular the kernel is affected if there are poor optimized driver or in the worst case there aren't driver at all.\nA project that can gain your attention is Bumblebee\nhttp://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/05/bumbleebee-brings-nvidia-optimus-gpu-switching-to-linux-users/\nhttps://github.com/MrMEEE/bumblebee\nthat basically add some funcionality to your system ( try to use ION as your only one video card ) but usually this kind of machine works better in a closed and proprietary environment like Windows without a doubt; the problem is always the same: the brands does not love to share usefull specs and really good driver.\n", "Q: I want to sync my music folder, Ubuntu One says it will sync once I subscribe.

So, it seems with 12.04, they're switching back to Rhythmbox, after switching from Rhythmbox a year ago. I don't get why.\nThey say that it's because of a blocking bug in GTK3# (if I understand that correctly), but that's just one bug, and in the same breath they say RB is not well maintained.\nIt seems Ubuntu guys were dissatisfied with Banshee in some way, but apparently the Banshee guys were never notified of any problems.\nAlso, it can't be to save disc space by dropping mono, because at the same day it was announced that the install disc will be enlarged by 50MB.\nAlso, isn't it a bit shortsighted to push Banshee for default inclusion, and then drop it again a year later? How is that a sustainable use of dev resources, or consistent? Apparently there was quite some heavy effort by banshee devs - David Nielsen used the term \"bending over backwards for Ubuntu\" iirc.\nIn summary: Can anyone shed more light on this?\nRelated question: Why was Banshee chosen to be the default for 11.04?\nSources: \nhttp://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/11/banshee-tomboy-and-mono-dropped-from-ubuntu-12-04-cd/\nhttp://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/11/rhythmbox-to-return-as-ubuntu-12-04-default-music-app/\nhttp://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/11/ubuntu-12-04-disc-size-to-be-750mb/\nhttp://summit.ubuntu.com/uds-p/meeting/19442/desktop-p-default-apps/\nhttp://banshee-media-player.2283330.n4.nabble.com/banshee-being-dropped-from-ubuntu-because-of-GTK3-support-td3985298.html\n\nA: GTK3 support. \"The main reason for this is that Banshee still uses GTK2 and the GTK3 branch is currently blocked by some missing GTK# 3 features. And this blocks porting the Ubuntu One Music Store plugin to GTK 3 and it prevents it from working properly on ARM.\"\nSource: WebUpd8\nAnd you'll probably have better luck on looking for different players on Ubuntu Forums, but since I'm answering anyways, I like Clementine a lot.\n\nA: Answer about why Rhythmbox was chosen from the Ubuntu Desktop Mailing list\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Based upon broader community feedback, it seems the preference is RB.\n  Now, we have to be careful with that, obviously, but we simply use that as\n  a data point.\n  \n*Size of both projects on CD. Alone, not a deciding point, but another\n  data point.\n  \n*Stability in core function. Banshee has many features, though the\n  general impression is that it has stability issues with frequent crashes\n  and hangs needing force quits. RB is known to be quite stable.\n  \n*User Experience (including usability, overall feel, responsiveness).\n  Banshee has the edge here, though can be less responsive (UI hangs). RB has\n  some UI challenges that were detailed in Charline's usability report.\n  \n*Speed in start up and operation. This seems mostly a draw. Tweaks can be\n  made to Banshee to improve cold startup time, though it does have moments\n  were it hangs mid operation, but they seem more related to overall\n  stability.\n  \n*ARM - Big unknown for Banshee.\n  \n*GTK3 - RB is already GTK3. Banshee is almost there, but carries more\n  risk as it would be new binding stack\n  \n\n\nA: I think it is important to stress the usability problems that plague Banshee. This is IMHO the main reason behind the community preference for RB. This thread at the Ubuntu Fora details several of the issues users were confronted with after the inclusion of Banshee in release 11.04:\n\n\n*\n\n*High memory usage\n\n*Doesn't play ogg files properly\n\n*Randomly skips first 5 seconds of tracks\n\n*Randomly stops playing without issuing error messages\n\n*Lists audio files in disconnected drives\n\n*Lists audio files in duplicate, triplicate, ...\n\n\nThis return to RB is a coming back to senses, IMHO.\n\nA: It seems that you also answered the question, at least from the ubuntu developers point of view. That gtk3# bug is enough to make the developers unable to port banshee to gtk3 so it seems it is not that small. I think removing mono from the installation CD is an extra and i'm not very sure about it. Before banshee was included mono was already shipped to include tomboy and gbrainy and i'm not very sure tnat the ubuntu team is thinking of removing them from the CD\nSummarizing, i think the biggest issue is the lack of support of gtk3 in banshee, but there's still time to solve that problem\n", "Q: Rhythmbox crashes during startup I enabled Replay Gain in Rhythmbox and the program closed and now I cannot open the program at all.

In my case it's root, so all I have to do:\necho \"Xcursor.size: 24\" >> /root/.Xdefaults\n\nHopefully it helps.\n\nA: i had the same issue after changing from gdm to lightdm. my solution was to revert back to gdm and now my cursors are fine. to do this run \nsudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm\n\nand choose gdm as default.\n", "Q: How do I scan for Wireless Access Points?

More specifically, when the line number (NR) is even, i.e., we are on a line showing an access point, the output record separator (ORS) should be a line break. Otherwise, we are on the line containing signal strength, so we join the line by making ORS a simple space.\nsort -gr\nIf we sort this output by numerical value (-g) and reverse it (-r), we end up with a list of signal strengths and access points, showing the access point with the strongest signal on top:\n-71.00 dBm nameOfAccessPoint2\n-77.00 dBm nameOfAccessPoint1\n\n\nBeware: Some access points can have an extended capability:\n    Extended capabilities:\n             * SSID List\n\nThis means grepping \"SSID:\" instead of \"SSID\" helps avoiding this extra output which would make the command fail otherwise.\n\nA: With wpa_cli\nUsing wpa_cli , which is part of wpa_supplicant, you can get information about local Wi-Fi networks:\nsudo wpa_cli scan && sudo wpa_cli scan_results\n\nExample output:\nSelected interface 'wlp3s0'\nbssid / frequency / signal level / flags / ssid\n23:99:21:91:89:34   2462    -50 [WPA2-PSK-CCMP][WPS][ESS]   SSID_8\n42:5d:25:a2:f5:7a   2462    -59 [WPA2-PSK-CCMP][WPS][ESS]   SSID_7\n21:99:94:b1:89:3b   5180    -54 [WPA2-PSK-CCMP][WPS][ESS]   SSID_6\n52:7d:2d:96:f4:d9   5500    -67 [WPA2-PSK-CCMP][WPS][ESS]   SSID_5\n54:7d:3d:a6:f4:c0   2412    -52 [WPA2-PSK-CCMP][WPS][ESS]   SSID_4\n9d:34:16:a0:04:81   2437    -53 [WPA2-PSK-CCMP][WPS][ESS]   SSID_3\ne9:40:e2:b3:58:dd   2412    -64 [WPA-PSK-CCMP+TKIP][WPA2-PSK-CCMP+TKIP][ESS]    SSID_2\n4a:5d:25:72:f5:79   5580    -72 [WPA2-PSK-CCMP][WPS][ESS]   SSID_1\n\n\nA: iwinfo wlan0 scan\n\nwlan0 is you wireless interface\nthe result like below list\n...\nCell 06 - Address: F0:B4:29:50:76:0C\n          ESSID: \"Xiaomi_760B\"\n          Mode: Master  Channel: 1\n          Signal: -38 dBm  Quality: 70/70\n          Encryption: mixed WPA/WPA2 PSK (TKIP, CCMP) \n....\n\nthe command will return encryption info\nsystem : openwrt 15.05\n", "Q: I completely destroyed Unity!

The Gedit window was opening such that it looked like it was maximized but it wasn't. I pressed the maximize button on the window and this fixed the issue! Note that the window did not change size, only the corners went from round to square. It seems like this must be a bug in the algorithm @fossfreedom described above.\nNote: When you close the window, the maximize/minimize state must be stored in some user config somewhere.

I am running 16 debug processes simultaneously with our adapted gdb (called e-gdb).

Alternatively, I can use the --tab option to have them all in one terminal.\nWhen the sessions end I close the terminal(s) with a click (I don't want it to auto-close).\nSo, with multiple terms I need to click 16 times while with tabs I click once, but I have to switch between tabs to see the session results.

Simply closing Nautilus and restarting it should fix all the issues. If it doesn't, then you can press alt+f2 and run killall nautilus which will restart Nautilus completely.

If they're all on the same hard drive and all use ext4 then you are only placing restrictions on yourself with no benefit (except perhaps home folder in the backup/update case talked about above, but even this is not really necessary). \nYou are right to choose NTFS for your shared partition, it is the Windows default file system and is the best you will be able to use until Windows gets ext4 support (not likely!).\nOne warning though, which comes back to you partitioning away your file system. Some programs do not install themselves to /usr. Some install to the home folders and (in the case of some games) the /opt folder. This is why you should be careful with separating your system folders because you never know when something might want to go into a folder you wouldn't expect, and if you're only assigning 5GB to /opt and the others, you could run into trouble.\n\nA: '/' should be 6GB since it contains 'etc', 'var', 'tmp', etc.\nSwap space should be the same size or x2 the memory you have.\n'/home' should be the rest of free space.\n\nA: The swap partition should be at least the size of your RAM.\nNormally I set it 2x of my RAM size.\n", "Q: How to force apt to download a specific version of a package from PPA?

(other than copying and pasting the ids for all the 50 systems to 'authorized keys') if so, how?\nps: i don't have the sudo permissions.\n\nA: If your 50 systems are sharing the home directory, then you are using one and the same SSH keypair on all of them. Hence, there's only one public key to add to the lab computer's authorized_keys.\nFor more information on SSH keys and how to set them up, see: http://pkeck.myweb.uga.edu/ssh/\n", "Q: How do I alias `as` to `askubuntu.com` in Chromium?

Add a new search engine, with details as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Name: AskUbuntu (this doesn't really matter)\n\n*Keyword: as\n\n*URL: http://www.askubuntu.com\n\nA: Alternatively there is a Bookmark Keyword extension, that provides a similar functionality.\nAfter installing, add a bookmark to http://askubuntu.com with the title [as] Ask Ubuntu.\nNow it is possible to use the keyword between the square brackets to invoke the bookmark in the address bar. The detailed process is documented on the extension's web page.\nAs an example, to invoke askubuntu.com you have to type:\nkwTABasEnter\n(It requires 2 extra key presses, but I think it is a good tradeoff between maintenance and usability. And for an added bonus there are commands that can be appended to keywords to modify the opening process. Eg.: as:t will open the page on a new tab.)\n\nA: If you want this to take effect to the whole of your computer, you need to edit the /etc/hosts file alias for that:\n64.34.119.12    as        # askubuntu.com\nTo edit the file, type in gksu gedit /etc/hosts in the terminal\n", "Q: No write access to SMB share of windows drive after upgrade to 11.10 I used to create a share to my windows directory with a script.

In Linux unused memory = bad memory, so Linux tries to use every available memory if possible. An example is caching. This memory can be freed up anytime as soon as an application needs it.\nYou can flush these cached contents manually:\n# free\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:       1022560     470596     551964          0      27872     189784\n-/+ buffers/cache:     252940     769620\nSwap:      6587388          0    6587388\n\n# sync\n# echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\n# free\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:       1022560     300952     721608          0        972      53216\n-/+ buffers/cache:     246764     775796\nSwap:      6587388          0    6587388\n\n\nA: This might happen if you add many (hundreds of thousands) of files to be synced at once.

I found that the python script decorator.py had to execute twice to have the effect applied.  Rather than tapping out ./decorator.py twice every time I started a new terminal, I created maximize to execute the script twice.  This script is hotkeyed to Ctrl-Alt-Y.\nCurrently I've used\ngnome-terminal --maximize -e /home/jason/maximize\ngnome-terminal --maximize -x /home/jason/maximize\nas arguments for Ctrl-Alt-T.\nThe issue is I can see the outline of a new terminal flash on screen, but it doesn't exist for more than a fraction of a second.  How can I make the new window more persistent?\n\nA: The -x option to\ngnome-terminal or,\nsimilarly, the -e option to other xterm-compatible terminal\napplications, tell the terminal emulator to start the command\nfollowing the -x/-e option and then exit.  This is the reason why\nyou're seeing the terminal outline flash and disappear: the terminal\nstarts, maximizes, then exits.\nYou could instead include the maximize command into your .bashrc\nor .profile, so that it is executed every time a shell is started.\nHowever, since it executed each time a shell is started, you need to\nfind a way to execute it only when the shell is started from the\nterminal application.  On my Ubuntu 11.04 system the following does\nthe trick:\nif [ -n \"$DISPLAY\" ] && [ \"$SHLVL\" = 1 ]; then\n  # the following commands are only executed when\n  # the shell runs inside a terminal\n  maximize\nfi\n\nThe -n \"$DISPLAY\" part tests if there is a graphical X11 display\nactive, and the $SHLVL part checks if this shell is 1st level shell,\ni.e., a direct child of the terminal application (a shell may start\nanother shell for running commands or script, but in this case the\n$SHLVL value will be larger than 1).\n", "Q: How do I permanently disable extensions in GNOME Shell?

My laptop's touchpad (a Synaptics touchpad I believe, laptop is an Asus G53SW) had been acting strangely from the beginning. After receiving an answer to this question, I decided to look for other multi-touch gestures, and came across this page in the Ubuntu Wiki. It turns out all of the weird behavior I had observed (windows getting moved, maximized/restored, or grab handles appearing) corresponds to 3-finger gestures. Whenever any of these behaviors occur, my touchpad will generally stop responding to 1-finger movements (tapping for clicks or dragging to move the cursor) until I click one of the two mouse buttons below the pad, which further reinforces my suspicion that the touchpad is somehow sending out 3-finger gestures at random when I use it.\nI decided to try all the gestures out myself to see how the touchpad responds. The only gestures I can get to work consistently are: two-finger drag (scrolling) and three-finger tap (grab handles). Three-finger dragging (move window) works fine half the time, the other half the window jumps around a LOT as I drag it. I also ran into this question while researching the subject. I decided to run geistest to see if my touchpad supported 4 finger gestures in the first place. These were the results: http://pastebin.com/znnnXsA9\nSo it's clear my touchpad isn't working perfectly. So here's the pertinent questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there any way to fix this erratic behavior? I'm guessing no, so...\n\n*Is there any way to disable the 3-finger gestures specifically? According to this question, probably not, so...\n\n*How can I disable multi-touch altogether? How would I re-enable it if I change my mind?\n\n\nEDIT: Installed Gnome Shell, having no problems with the touchpad. At this point I'm dead sure the problem is with Unity's 3-finger gestures. I'd still like a solution to the issue, as I'm quite partial to Unity.\n\nA: I'm not able to answer all of your questions, but I can answer #3. If you're using a touchpad on your laptop, you can click on the Power button (upper right-hand corner), and choose \"System Settings\". Then, click on the Mouse and Touchpad option. In there, click the tab for touchpad, and uncheck the \"Enable mouse clicks\" option. You can also set the scrolling to Disabled, or Edge Scrolling.\nAs for the other two questions, you can always try updating to see if that fixes the issues. If you open Software Center, you can search for Synaptiks touchpad management, or touchpad. Install the appropriate application (synaptiks is for KDE, but it should work in Unity as well), and configure the touchpad.\nHope this helps you, and have a great weekend:)\nPatrick.\n", "Q: Using an external monitor on an LG R590 laptop I just installed Ubuntu 10.04 on my LG R590 laptop, and when I boot it, I can't get my external monitor to work. System->Preferences->Monitors won't recognize it (even when I click Detect monitors), and when I press Fn+F7 - which is my laptop's function key for switching between built-in/external displays - it does nothing.\nI found in the internet this article, which says I need to edit my xorg.conf file for this to work, and says that file should be created automatically when I install Ubuntu. However, I can't find it in my /etc/X11/, and this answer says that Ubuntu doesn't need that file anymore so it doesn't create it - though it still uses it if it finds one. It also says that if I have an NVidia card (which I have) I can force Ubuntu to create it by using sudo nvidia-xconfig, but I get a command not found when I try it.\nSo, is there any other way to make Ubuntu recognize my external screen? Or any way to force Ubuntu to create a xorg.conf file so I can edit it according to that tutorial?\nBTW, I don't know if it matters, but I connect my external monitor via HDMI-DVI cable(HDMI side goes in my laptop, DVI side goes the monitor)\n\nA: OK, I managed to solve this all by myself(with some help from the Internet... and a friend who knows some Linux...)\nI just had to download and install the NVidia driver, reboot, and than System->Preferences->Monitors will open the NVidia's control panel instead of the default Ubuntu one, and allow me to set everything I need plus it made me an xorg.conf file.\nNow the only problem left is how to make it work in terminal mode...\n", "Q: Alt-Tab Behaviour, Windows from I am wondering about the behaviour of the Alt-Tab :\nAll windows are shown, whereas before (sure on 10.10, can't remember on 11.04) we could just see the windows of the current workspace.\nTherefore the number of windows displayed is much more important !\nCould you please help me ?\n\nA: As far as I know this is not configurable for the new window switcher which is part of Unity in 11.10.\nPersonally I fix this by disabling the shortcuts for the new integrated switcher and using a different window switcher.  There are at least 4 other window/application switcher plugins in Compiz and most (or all?) of the other switchers can be configured to either show all windows or only those on the current workspace.\nYou can edit the Compiz configuration when you install compizconfig-settings-manager & run \"CompizConfig Settings Manager\".\nAn additional advantage is that these alternative switchers actually work and show all application windows (including those of Java apps and some legacy apps, which for some reason aren't shown by the Unity switcher).\n", "Q: after suspend-resume, dmesg printk times look as if suspend happened exactly before resume?!

The reason for the 4 seconds is the time for suspending after the first message poped out and for waking, before the second message is printed.

Is there a way to clear the pop up notifications I get from changing the volume, brightness, dropbox updates, etc...?\nSometimes I have to sit and wait for them to go away so that I can continue to work, as they are blocking something I want to click or look at. \nI know this question might seem a little naggy but it does indeed lower my productivity sometimes. I don't mind getting the notifications, but I do mind not having a option to clear them.\nAny idea how I can do that?\nI am using Ubuntu 11.10 (Gnome)\n\nA: In Ubuntu 12.04, you can use NotifyOSDconfig as explained here:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:leolik/leolik\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:amandeepgrewal/notifyosdconfig\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install notifyosdconfig\n\nThen you can run the program \"NotifyOSD Configuration\" from Dash Home. Select the option \"Close Bubble on Click\" and you are done :)\n\nA: First of all, the notifications are click-through, and should fade when you mouse over them, so they should not make you wait for clicking/seeing something below.\nThere is also the possibility to temporarily get no notifications except some specific ones like changing the audio volume.  Applications like Totem use this while you are viewing a movie full-screen, for example.\nBut there is no way to \"dismiss\" them AFAIK.\n(This all asumes you are using GNOME with Unity.)\n\nA: Kill the notify-osd program. That'll stop it from notifying until you reboot.\n\nA: The package responsible for displaying the notifications is notify-osd . You can remove it by opening up a terminal and running the following command:\nsudo apt-get remove notify-osd\n\nFair warning: this will permanently disable all notifications.\n\nIf you later decide you want the notifications back, you can run the following command:\nsudo apt-get install notify-osd\n\n", "Q: Keyboard backlight sensor doesn't work on a Sony Vaio VPCS116FG I have a VAIO laptop (VPCS116FG, S series).

To get them all, either use his solution: \nfind . -type d -print0 | xargs -0 chmod o=rx \nfind . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 chmod o=\n\nor find's builtin -exec:\nfind . -type d -exec chmod o=rx '{}' ';'\nfind . -type f -exec chmod o= \\{\\} \\;\n\nNote that you can either quote the braces and semicolon like the first line, or escape them like the second, they just have to be there in separate arguments.  Also, -exec will execute chmod once for each file, while xargs will do it in as few commands as possible (based on the max command line length).

I've spent a few hours this morning trying to setup Rails on a fresh instance of Ubuntu and I noticed that the process is incredibly more convoluted than on Windows. On Windows I go to rubyinstaller.org, run the executable (I was specifically interested in 1.9.2-p180) and then adjust the system path accordingly. Rails also requires no additional steps, I can clone a git repository and start cranking away.\nOn Ubuntu I had to install the RVM (which I could have done for Windows as well), install the prereqs that is listed, have the apt-get fail because a bunch of those packages were no longer available. I then finally ran rvm install only to find out that make wasn't going to work, so I had to manually comment out a bunch of dependencies on openssl from one of the .c files and rebuild it, then it finally installed. Rails was still far from done though, so I had to install another bunch of prerequisites, edit some extra file in the ruby source and execute it, and then I could finally get rails console to even start.\nIs this pretty normal? Should I pretty much expect everything to take a couple of extra hours on ubuntu if I'm going to be developing Rails applications? I had to consult at least 3-4 guides for 11.04 and at least 5 different stack overflow posts to get the thing running, it seems like a very traumatic user experience to me.\n\nA: Regarding why your experience was difficult I'm not sure that can be answered without more knowledge of what exactly you did. Regarding your question of \"is this pretty normal?\" I'm not sure it can be answered definitively but I can relay my experience in hope that it's helpful!\nI've been developing on Rails with Ubuntu for over two years and can say that I never had to deal with broken packages or touch/rebuild code in any of the required packages. I completely reinstall with every release and my experience has been that it's easier to setup my Rails environment with each release (likely due to growing experience). In general, after a clean install of Ubuntu, I would say that it takes me under an hour (at times much less) to get my environment to the stage where it was before the clean install.\nA couple days ago I followed the linked tutorial to completely re-setup my Rails development environment on 11.10. I previously was using package manager Ruby packages, which worked fine until I needed to run multiple versions of Ruby. Note that relying on the package manager packages for Ruby development is generally considered not the best way to develop Ruby on Ubuntu (see the linked article for details) but it has always worked fine for me in the past (when you only need one version of Ruby, Rails and Gems).\nI think one thing that differentiates Linux from some other OS's is the ability to go about doing something in many different ways, while in some other OS's it may only be possible in one particular way. This is true of setting up your development environment (there are multiple ways to do it) and it's easy to see this leading to confusion and the need to consult different guides. From my limited experience, using the RVM bash install script in the linked article has been the easiest (that is, considering the major benefits of RVM, if RVM is of no benefit to you then there may be easier ways such as the package manager).\nIf you are more familiar with developing in Windows and are setting up Ubuntu for development for the first time I think it's reasonable to expect it to take longer simply because many things take longer the first time we learn to do them. If it ends up being \"traumatic\" then I just hope you can find the experience and knowledge that you gained valuable :)\nhttp://ryanbigg.com/2010/12/ubuntu-ruby-rvm-rails-and-you/\n\nA: Just FYI: I just finished a complete RoR setup on Ubuntu 12.04 in five minutes.\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install git git-svn postgresql-9.1 libpq-dev ruby1.9.1 thin\n\n*sudo apt-get install libxm2-dev libxslt-dev\n\n*sudo gem install rails pg\nlibxm2-dev and libxslt-dev are only for Nokogiri (if you need it) and postgresql-9.1, libpq-dev and pg are only for PostgresSQL database (if you need it).\nAfter that I was able to run bundle install in my Rails project directories to get all required Gems up and running and everything worked. No need for rvm and I never encountered broken packages. OK, so I wasn't interested in one specific build of Ruby, but then why were you?\nMaybe you encountered one of the (unfortunately many) \"Ruby-manual-hack-installation-du-jour\" websites which tell you to scrap all package management systems and compile everything by yourself.\nIn contrast to the previous poster I think that one difference between Windows and Linux regarding Ruby is that in Windows there is no \"official\" way of installing software (but many unofficial ways, installers, websites etc.), but in Linux there is an \"official\" way (the distributor's package) and that usually works best but limits your choices somewhat. \nAnd since Linux software tends to share much more (code, functionality, etc) as Windows software, and the distinction between the \"OS\" and the \"applications\" is much more blurry than in Windows, if you begin manually compiling and installing software in Linux expect to have to care much more about dependancies, libraries and so on than in Windows.\nThe best way is always to get the distributors packages (my experience).\n", "Q: No dual screens on an Asus m4A89 GTD Pro I'm having an issue getting dual monitors working for Kubuntu 11.10.  I have Asus m4A89 GTD pro/USB3 mother board with integrated Ati HD4290 graphics chip. When I try to enable multiple monitors through the system settings, it says \"This module is only for configuring systems with a single desktop spread across multiple monitors.  You do not appear to have this configuration.\"\nI had previously attempted to fix this problem with another installation of Ubuntu 11.10, but ended up having to reinstall ubuntu because i messed up the software center dependencies.  After I installed Ubuntu the first time, a notification showed up asking me to install an Ati graphics driver.  I installed this driver, then restarted, and dual monitors did not work.  That was when I went to the ATI site and attempted to install the fglrx driver.  When I tried to run the shell script for the fglrx driver, it said i had a previous version of an fglrx driver installed, and needed to remove it in order to install the new one.  So I looked up some tutorial on how to remove it and found some apt-get remove command, which i ran.  Then I was able to install the new driver.

So i just reinstalled ubuntu, and now i'm trying to go about this the correct way.\nDoes anyone have this same configuration and which driver works for you?\n\nA: Download the lastes ATI drivers from \"Restricted Drivers\".\nExecute the following command to \"force the dectection\" of your dual screen:\n sudo aticonfig --initial=dual-head\n\nIt's also good idea to remove .config/monitors.xml in order to avoid conflicts, so execute the following commande:\nrm ~/.config/monitors.xml \n\nIf all went ok you should see an output as in Dai's thread when executing the command (without the Xinerama configuration in my case):\nmore /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\nOpen \"AMD Catalyst Control Center Admin\" go to \"Display Manager\" (mine is in French so am just guessing the English names).

And general SSD optimization I've got two drives in my laptop, a 120GB SSD and a 320GB hard drive. Ubuntu (11.04 amd64) is on the hard drive, set up using LVM. Now, I got this SSD recently, and I want to put Ubuntu on it for faster boot times and such. What exactly happens if, say, I create a new physical volume on the SSD, and add new physical extents to my existing logical volumes (say, / and /home)? Will files be moved over to the SSD at all? Is there striping that goes on? The goal is for my sytem to be faster, so I want to make sure that important files are on the SSD but it would be nice if I could avoid reinstalling completely. I'm still not that comfortable with LVM. I actually tried doing a fresh install to my SSD but for some reason it failed in the middle of installing software packages (after I set up the new physical volume and stuff for the SSD).\nIn general, how do people run Ubuntu on systems with a hard drive and an SSD, for best preformance? Thanks!\nEdit: I should mention that 80GB of the SSD is allocated to Windows (for games) so Ubuntu only has about 35GB (random system reserved things and mistruths in advertising make up the last bit).\n\nA: \nWhat exactly happens if, say, I create a new physical volume on the SSD, and add new physical extents to my existing logical volumes (say, / and /home)? Will files be moved over to the SSD at all?\n\nNo\n\nIs there striping that goes on?\n\nNo. Unless you create a new 'stripped' LV. see here\n\nIn general, how do people run Ubuntu on systems with a hard drive and an SSD, for best preformance? Thanks!\n\nI don't know, but since you have a large SSD, I guess you have three options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Put most everything on the SSD. Use HDD for backups, data not used very frequently and swap space maybe. (This could bring significant speed and battery saving because the HDD will hardly be used.)\n\n*Create a 120GB Mirroring RAID from SSD and HDD to use with LVM for most everything. Remaining space on HDD for extra data. (Speeds up reading, not writing.)\n\n*Create a 120GB Stripping RAID from SSD and HDD to use with LVM for most everything or used a sripped LV. (Should speed up reading and writing significantly, but actual performance is hard to predict due to the different characteristics of HDD and SSD perfomance.)\n\n", "Q: How can I stop GNOME 3 from asking my wireless password multiple times? When I login to my account the system ask me for my wifi password in a prompt that looks like the main ubuntu screen and later again with the gnome 3 look and maybe 2 or 3 more times, sometimes the third time it connects and some it dont. I'm lost.\n\nA: I will assume you're running Network Manager. Right Click on the Network Manager symbol (in the top row on your screen. On my system, it is just Left of my speaker symbol), scroll down to \"Edit Connections\". A popup will open. Click on the  \"Wireless tab\". \"Add\" or \"Edit\" a connection, and fill in your information in all of the tabs. \nTo find out what's happening, here's what I would do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do nothing, until the password prompt pops up again.\n\n*Deal with the password prompt.\n\n*Do ls -lrt /var/log to get a list of recently modified log files.\n\n*Look at the last several lines of each recently modified log file.

I want to know how to access the one with the content so I can add music to the player. Can anyone help me with this? Thanks in advance.\n\n\nA: Before trying anything too complicated, have you opened Disk Utility and looked to see if the other partitions are listed and just not mounted?\nWe've seen an increase recently in \"flip flop\" USB hardware. This hardware (typically things like USB 3G modems or printers) originally registers itself to the host computer as a USB mass storage device (flash drive) containing the driver, and then the driver is able to change the mode of the hardware to access its real functions. I suspect that this may be what is happening with the Leapfrog Crammer.\nThe piece of software responsible for automatically changing the mode of this hardware in Ubuntu is called usb_modeswitch. In all likelihood, usb_modeswitch doesn't yet know that it needs to change the mode of the Leapfrog Crammer, and may not know how. The usb_modeswitch homepage has documentation on how to modify the configuration to handle new devices\n", "Q: How to tell if Ubuntu is installed inside or alongside Windows?

Now I've created two new users, but when I try to putty into the instance using their usernames I get \"Server refused our key\". \nWhat's going on? Is the keypair tied to the ubuntu user? Also, do we have to create a keypair for these users, or can they log in using a password? Or do we need to always putty in as \"ubuntu\" and then \"su - myusername\"? Or am I just missing something simple?\n\nA: Yes the keypair is tied to the ubuntu user. After you create the new users, you'll need to put the key you want to use in $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys .. Its a little complicated, as you also need to make sure the $HOME/.ssh has secure permissions\nchmod 0700 $HOME/.ssh\n\nand that the authorized_keys file also has secure permissions\nchmod 0600 $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys\n\nOne trick is to just copy the ubuntu user's key file to the new users if you just want to use the same key.\nsudo cp -arf /home/ubuntu/.ssh /home/myuser/.ssh\nchown -R myuser.myuser /home/myuser/.ssh\n\nIf you setup a password for those new users (not recommended actually.. password brute force attacks of SSH servers are rampant on the internet) you can also do this from your client machine:\nssh-copy-id user@host\n\nWhich will handle all of the permissions for you. Also if you store your key in your Launchpad.net account, you can do\nssh-import-id your-launchpad-user\n\nAnd it will pull your key from launchpad (this command was renamed to ssh-import-id in 11.04 and later).\n", "Q: can ping, but not SSH So I have NetworkManager, connected to an AP on wlan1.

Something like a customized preferences settings for system wide so that everybody posses those settings and below will explain in clear what I actually ment.\nOn every machine I will install the following:\nEclipse\nMysql Query Browser and Admin\nMysql Workbench\nOracle VirtualBox\nThunderbird\n-----------\n-----------\n-----------\n\nIf I install them by apt, this will automatically create shortcuts in Applications but when I build them from source or extract the tar ball, I will have to add New Item at it's relevant place going to System-->Preferences-->Main Menu to make them available as a shortcuts and this settings are applied only for the account I login and perform them. How could I make this preferences settings for complete system wide which applies for all users? or if there is a way to apply a customized user settings to other users will also be ok. Any hint please?\nThank you!\n\nA: There are many different kinds of system preferences that are stored in different ways. So answering your broad question is difficult, but here's the answer to the specific question:\nWhen you use the menu editor to create new shortcuts, it works by creating desktop files which get placed in the user's/home/$USER/.local/share/applications/ directory. This will only add it to the menu of the user used to create the menu item. For the menu item to be accesable system-wide, you can put the desktop file in /usr/local/share/applications/\nYou could find the desktop file created by the menu editor and move it, or you could just create a file under /usr/local/share/applications/ manually. Here's a sample file, terminator.desktop:\n[Desktop Entry]\nCategories=GNOME;GTK;Utility;\nComment=Multiple terminals in one window\nExec=terminator\nIcon=terminator\nName=Terminator\nType=Application\n\nReplace the values with those appropriate for your application.\n", "Q: The selected configuration for displays could not be applied Just installed 11.10 64bit and followed this guide to install the latest drivers for my Radeon HD 4870.\nI have a 24\" and a 17\" side by side.

It is hard-coded in GTK and determined by a \"smart\" algorithm which dynamically depends on the window size.\nSo I downloaded the source and found the function that returns the step value. I changed it to return a very small number first, and then 0 (to see if it has any affect at all).\nI did\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nas instructed by GTK website.\nIt compiles with no problems (I have the libraries)\nBu then, I restart and it has absolutely no affect. My guess is Ubuntu is still using the original GTK it shipped with. What do you think is wrong here?\n\nA: You should consider using the debian/ubuntu way of building from source as this ensures that all files goes to the intended directories. Running './configure' without any options usually sets PREFIX to '/usr/local'. Thus all the previous gtk files are still in place as they most likely reside in '/usr' and therefor gets loaded instead of the new ones you have compiled.\nTry apt-get source <package> then modify the source to your liking.\nThen to build the package do dpkg-build -rfakeroot -uc -b to build a .deb.\nThen install the .deb with dpkg -i .\nThis will replace the current install of the package rebuilt.\nHowever the apt tools will try to replace this package at every system update. But it's a good way to try out changes.\n", "Q: Is there a Google+ notificator available as indicator in Unity? I think it would be beautiful to have an indicator in Unity tray, counting Google+ notifications (orange on black, like in Google bar). Where can I find it? \n\nA: As already mentioned in a comment: \nCurrently the google+ API seems not to allow access to the notifications. There is a feature request here which asks for exactly this API enhancement. So it is unlikely that a desktop application will provide this, as long as the API is missing. \nThe exceptions to this seem to maintain a hidden webkit window, which is first used to login the user and later does ajax calls to the google+ website plus probably some screen scraping of the result. This is not a straight forward way of handling something that would only require a simple API call in case it was enabled. So most developers will probably wait until the API is updated. \n", "Q: Trouble with Plymouth and Suspend/Hibernate on a Dell Optiplex GX520 There are two symptoms apparently related to an ACPI issue on my computer, as none of these problems happen if I boot with ACPI=OFF (except then the system cannot shut itself off or, in the case of suspend, recovers immediately).\nPC is Dell Optiplex GX520 SFF and has an unused onboard dual-monitor integrated video and also an add-in PCI video card (Nvidia Quadro NVS 50 PCI).  The monitor is a Hanns-G 1440x900 widescreen LCD connected to the add-in PCI card.  I need to run the machine this way because PC has no PCI-Express slot and something is very wrong with the onboard video (cooling related), and the entire computer hangs on GPU faults if set to 1440x900 and a Windowing graphics application (like X windows) uses the onboard video for very long.\nIf I boot Ubuntu WITHOUT the acpi=off boot option, Plymouth (the Ubuntu boot progress meter splash screen) never shows up.  Also, if I try to suspend the PC after logging in, it will turn off but hang when I go to wake it up.  Also, the system will just hang if I try to hibernate it, and afterwards will not recover the session if I manually power it down and then back up.  This happens even with acpi=ht BTW.  Happens regardless of whether I am using the 2D or 3D Unity shell.  Only if I use acpi=off however, do I ever see graphical Plymouth (hooray!) and hibernate works except I have to manually power down the system once the System Halted message appears but it actually even recovers when I turn it back on (Suspend also works, although the machine never actually sleeps and immediately recovers to the locked session screen, all due to the consequences of disabling ACPI).\nFinding out that ACPI is involved was a breakthrough.  This problem happens when running with the Nvidia proprietary driver, with the Nouveau driver, and with the X.Org NV driver under 11.10 Oneiric (didn't happen in 10.10 Maverick, however).  Prior to my upgrade from 10.10 (Maverick) to 11.04,11.10 (Oneiric), the X.Org NV driver actually did suspend/recover the system just great, though for that alternate driver to run, I needed to remove the nouveau.modest=0 (causing a non-graphical Plymouth to display).  In 11.10, the NV video driver (xserver-xorg-video-nv package) has been removed from the distro by Debian for lack of support from its authors, though it still can be manually installed with dpkg/aptitude and does actually still work otherwise just about fine.  I'm so upset it doesn't help anymore!\nThe fact that a simple app. like Plymouth is affected, which runs very early in the boot process, is encouraging.  What other clues, advice, or other system information do you think might help crack this case?\n\nA: The best idea would be to upgrade to a later model, e.g. an Optiplex 745 (Core 2 Duo instead of Pentium IV) just works flawlessly with 11.10, because broken ACPI tables were the norm when the transition from APM to ACPI was taking place. You could have a look at the dell web page if they have a firmware update, YMMV. There are also some dell packages in the repository for firmware updates.\nSuspend and hibernate require working ACPI since the modern linux kernel has dumped APM for good.\nPlymouth works only if the hardware supports kernel mode switching. yourdriver.modeset=0 turns it off but you should demand it from your system. \nOther ideas would be to open the case and clean the intel gma chip, try a 19\" 1280x1024 monitor or a dual monitor setup with a passively cooled PCI Matrox card (e.g. a g450).\n\nA: I managed to solve a host of ACPI problems (on very different hardware from yours) with a BIOS update.\nDell's BIOS is pretty straightforward to update with FreeDOS.\n", "Q: How to get server MOTD on non-server install Is there a way to get the fancy MOTD that shows up on an Ubuntu Server install on my Ubuntu Alternate install?

However, the ubuntu installer (from usb) doesn't recognise windows 8 - it says:\n\nThis computer currently has no detected operating systems. What would you like to do?\n\nWith the option to either erase the disk, or do \"Something else\". If I choose the second option and select the \"free space\" area and \"Install Now\" I get:\n\nNo root file system is defined.\nPlease correct this from the partitioning menu.\n\nSo: is there anything good I can do here to run on-the-metal side-by-side? The alternative is dropping one (probably Ubuntu, since windows 8 is already there) into a VM.\n\nA: I am triple booting Windows7, Windows 8 developer preview and Ubuntu 11.10 64-bit. If Win8 is so important to you, I should tell you that there's no way of adding a boot entry of Ubuntu in Windows8 boot menu and ubuntu wont recognise windows 8 (I have run down sudo update-grub and it didnt recognize win8).\nSo install windows7 in as small partition as possible. Use easeus partition manager or gparted live cd or any Ubuntu live cd (select Try Ubuntu and use gparted).\nYou can download gparted live here. There are also instructions to make a live cd/usb over there.\nResize your win8 partition and make a partition for win7 and some free space for Ubuntu,and install win7 in the partition. It is good to have a patition for data (so that it can be accessed in all 3 OS es, and it would be convenient if Ubuntu, Win7 and data are all in extended partition). This is how my partition table looks\n\nWindows 8 recognizes Win 7 and a menu entry of win7 will be present in win8 boot menu. Now boot into Ubuntu live cd installer and use advanced option and select free space and select add option and make a partition for /, /home, and swap and install the bootloader in the respective / partition and remember the partition (like sda7). Once installed, do not restart, just close the window and open a terminal and run the following command\nsudo dd if=/dev/sda7 of=/media/SHARE/ubuntu.bin bs=512 count=1\n\nif is input file path and of is the output file path.

Now boot into win7 and follow this article.\nAfter this just select the boot options of win8 and make win7 as default OS to boot, which will give you win7 boot menu with win8 and Ubuntu\n\nA: I think I know what your problem is here. I'm sure you've received all of the warnings about partitioning and why you should back up your data but it sounds like there is nothing important on your hard drive considering it's just holding the Windows 8 dev preview.

So I'm a recent Ubuntu convert and love it, but theres one thing I need help with: organising my music library.\nPreviously on Windows I used foobar2000, and had one playlist called \"Incoming\" where I put all of my new music that hadn't quite made it into my library, and when I decided it was good enough to make it into the collection I could select all the files, right click, \"Move files...\", and then foobar could move or copy all the files, and accompanying album art into the library folder on my hard drive, into the relevant subfolder for album and artist, and re-name the files nicely.\nI realise I could probably duplicate this functionality by writing a shell script but I was wondering what other people do with regards to new music, and organising it? I'd be open to new ways of dealing with new music, perhaps some kind of auto playlist of recently added music, or automatic pruning of new music that I haven't listened to. I'm currently using Banshee to play my music but I'm willing to change if needs be.\nThanks!\n\nA: I had same problem as you - match foobar2000 possibilities with something from Linux world.  \nI tried all I could to no solution. Currently I'm using MPD with Sonata, and new files get to MPD database after I process, tag, move with foobar2000 under Wine.  \nThere is no similar package in Linux. Deadbeef has perhaps 10% of foobar2000 functionality (nice converter included)\nFor your particular problem (move...), and perhaps something more try Ex Falso. It has option to rename files (move) based on tags\n\nA: The problem is that in some respects Foobar in Wine is the only solution. \nI find it best at converting too, as in many other types of music-file manipulation. For current use: Deadbeef, of course.\n", "Q: Problems installing from CD after computer went to sleep while downloading I downloaded the ISO image for Ubuntu 11.10 and when I tried installing it did not work.

That was by removing indicator-appmenu\nAnyway, so now everything is fine except one thing: If I have a window that is full screen, the minimize/maximize/close buttons are still grabbed by the bar on the top. Usually this doesn't cause a problem because the upper-left corner of the full screen window and the whole screen are not too far apart.\nHowever, one thing happens to me a lot, and that is I am working on something (programming), then I need to check some things from other places so I open some windows, see what I want and switch back to my work.

As separate /home partition helps in easy reinstallation/upgrade. Does having /boot help while dualbooting with windows? I mean is it useful for normal desktop/notebook users or it is advanced technique that need to be deployed in servers?\n\nA: /boot exists for technical and historic reasons.\nThe boot loader (grub or lilo) must be able to access its own files, the Linux kernel and the initial ramdisk. Those files are placed in /boot.\nEarly version of lilo could only access some subset of the HDD, would only understand a limited number of filesystems (practically only ext2), and required the filesystem to reside on a primary or logical partition (i.e. no md RAID or LVM). Therefore, it became common practice to have a small /boot partition.\nModern versions of grub are much more flexible, and, therefore, in many cases a separate partition for /boot is no longer required.\nFor dual booting Linux and Windows, /boot is irrelevant (although I like to use the boot partition's boot sector for the boat loader.) However, when dual booting different Linux installation, it's common to share /boot.\n\nA: [The information in this answer about GRUB2 and LVM is largely due to Jan's efforts; originally this answer was severely in error, and Jan deserves credit for the improvements I have made. -Eliah]\nWhen not using LVM, a separate /boot partition is primarily useful for ensuring that the files necessary for booting are close enough to the beginning of the drive, when the / partition is itself not at the beginning of the drive. For example, you might want to put your linux-swap partition very near the beginning of the drive, since on some drives data near the beginning of the drive is potentially accessed more quickly. Then you could have a small /boot partition, followed by your linux-swap partition, followed by the / partition (then followed by other separate partitions if you have them, such as /home).\nFor quite some time, this has been largely unnecessary, because with newer BIOSes, you can usually boot a system whose boot files are in a partition far from the beginning of the disk. Still, there is very little disadvantage to doing so (unless you make /boot so small that it fills up--it should probably be about 250 MiB), so many people who partition manually still do this.\nOlder boot loaders like LILO themselves had limitations that made separate /boot partitions helpful, as Jan points out.\nWhen using LVM, if your / partition is on the LVM, it used to be necessary to have a separate /boot partition. In such a configuration, the /boot partition is not be a partition of the LVM, but rather a partition on the disk before the LVM starts. This is because boot loaders could not read files from an LVM. So you could never boot into your system on the LVM if it didn't have a separate /boot partition (see this and this for details).\nThe ability to read files from an LVM was added with GRUB2, which means that all recent versions of Ubuntu (Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic Koala and later) have it. So with proper configuration you can have your entire Ubuntu system in an LVM without a separate /boot partition. See this page for details about how to configure this. (In fact, the only currently supported Ubuntu release that uses the original GRUB instead of GRUB2 is Ubuntu 8.04 LTS Server; every other non-EoL release--10.04 LTS, 10.10, 11.04, and 11.10--uses GRUB2.)\nIf you're using LVM but not for your Ubuntu system drive, just for a storage drive, or for some part of your system (perhaps for /home) but not /, then a separate /boot partition is not necessary, even if you are using an old (pre-GRUB2) system.\nIn summary, a separate /boot partition is largely a matter of personal preference for systems that do not use LVM, whereas an older system installed on an LVM might need one.\n\nA: You can a should also use a single /boot partition when installing multiple distributions ( as well as a single swap partition ).\nNone of those distributions own 100% of the /boot info so /boot should not be in any partition of a single distribution.\n", "Q: Don't have sound anymore after upgrade I just upgraded my ubuntu 11.04 to 11.10 and now I don't have sound anymore.\nAlso I tried this but unfortunately was unsuccessful . \nAny idea ?\nI have a \" VIA \"sound card , P7H55 Main board , intel 870 (Core i7 ) processor .\nhere is my lspci -nn | grep Audio output :\n00:1b.0 Audio device [0403]: Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset High Definition Audio [8086:3b56] (rev 06)\n\n01:00.1 Audio device [0403]: nVidia Corporation High Definition Audio Controller [10de:0be4] (rev a1)\n\n\nA: ok I found my question answer . \nhere is a link you can see if you have same one.\n\nA: I am not very sure whether it will help you or not...but I tried this solution after installing Ubuntu 11.04...and it worked for me...give it a try...\nhttp://www.computerandyou.net/2011/06/how-to-solve-no-sound-through-laptop-integrated-speakers-in-ubuntu-11-04/\n", "Q: An application that resembles Lion's save windows when logging out I have installed Ubuntu 12.04 in a virtual box, and I'm wondering if there is an application (or package) that resembles Lion's automatically-open-everything-up-when-you-logged-out\n\nA: This is not exactly what you're asking for, but since it's a virtual machine, you could save the state of the machine instead of shutting down so that it will be in exactly the same state when you start it next.\n", "Q: Thinkpad T520 slow WiFi Lately my Ubuntu WiFi is really slow.

When I upgraded to 11.04 I had a problem which was resolved by editing NetworkManager.conf to add \n[ifupdown]\nmanaged=true\n\nNow when I start my machine it takes forever to boot up, as it waits for network configuration, and then says it will wait for another 60 seconds. Finally, it gives up and boots without network connection. But once I login the network connection comes up fine. How can I make it do whatever it does after login during the boot sequence instead?\n\nA: Have now fixed the problem: changed the wireless setting to allow all users to access it.\n", "Q: Problems with installation on Xubuntu 11.10 LibreOffice Good afternoon, I have a problem when installing Xubuntu LibreOffice in 11.10.\nI open the console and add the PPA and all goes well, the problem arises when I give the order to installation.\nsan-san @ Lenovo: ~ $ sudo apt-get install LibreOffice\nReading package lists ... done\nBuilding dependency tree\nReading state information ... done\nFailed to install some packages.

I ran out of space in my linux partition, so I hopped over to the windows partition after unsuccessfully resizing the linux partition with gparted. I was using Easeus partition manager, and I resized the windows 7 partition. I selected the reboot after changes done option. Instead of seeing the regular purple grub menu, I get the grub rescue screen. I'd much appreciate it if someone could help me.\n\nA: As posted elsewhere, reinstalling GRUB2 to the Master Boot Record tends to solve this sort of problem. You can do that using any of these methods. However, you said that you unsuccessfully attempted to resize your Ubuntu system's partition. So before you write to the disk in any way, you might want to verify that this operation did not cause data loss. You can do this by booting from an Ubuntu live CD/DVD or USB flash drive and verifying that you can access your files. If you cannot find your Ubuntu partition anymore, and you had important documents in your Ubuntu system whose backups were not current, then you can follow the suggestions in this guide to attempt to recover your data. (Generally, when dynamically resizing partitions, especially with third-party tools, it is advisable to ensure that all backups of documents and other important files are current.)\n", "Q: Xscreensaver daemon not set to zero my problem is that everytime i start ubuntu the monitor goes into stand by.

You can install it by typing:\nsudo apt-get install ffmpeg\n\nWhen you installed it, check if it's included in the format list in blender:\n\nIf not, you need to download and reinstall blender. For some reason you have a version that was compiled without ffmpeg support. You could try one of the new 2.49 RC builds.\n\nA: I had the same problem and the reason was that the audio codec was not enabled.\nIn the Render tab, choose the MPEG format and you will see a section called Encoding. There you can choose the video codec and the audio codec. For instance, try MPEG-4 and MP3 and you will hopefully get the audio in the output file.\n", "Q: How to enable nautilus advanced permissions in configuration editor?

We use wine to install Windows programs and then when we run that Windows program wine will load it and be the means of communication between the Windows program and the Linux operating system.\nLook for a program called Uninstall Wine Software. Run that and click the Install button and then browse to the setup.exe file of the Windows program or whatever exe file is used to install the Windows program.\nWine will then install the program on the hard disk in .wine folder Look for a program files folder in the drive_c folder. That is where wine will put the program files.\nThe installation of the Windows program should put an icon for that program on the desktop.

For my job I require the use of the spreedX client which allows me to share my desktop when using the Spreed web conferencing environment (www.spreed.com). In pre-Unity Ubuntu versions, this application's indicator worked perfectly. However, it doesn't play nice with Unity (it doesn't show), not even when adding the magic \ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist \"['all']\".\nSo I'm not entirely sure where to go from here, but I did find the (presumable) source of the client: https://github.com/andreashe/mygitsite/tree/master/spreedX.\nI'm assuming that for an (experienced?) Python developer, it shouldn't be hard to fix the app by using the guidelines which I found here. Unfortunately, I'm no Python developer, let alone an experienced one :-(\nBut perhaps there are other solutions which I did not think about? Of course, I will contact Spreed and ask them to fix this, but if they won't (or it takes them forever) I would love to have some more options...\n\nA: Thanks to Jorge and the fact that I needed to reboot my machine for some other reason, I noticed that just running \ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist \"['JavaEmbeddedFrame', 'spreedX', 'scp-dbus-service', 'Wine', 'Update-notifier']\"\n\nisn't enough to make it work. You also have to log out and back in again. Stupid beginner mistake - I know, but one easily made.\nIt would be 'nice' if gsettings would prompt the user with something like \"You need to log off and back in again in order to take these changes into effect.\" when setting stuff like this.

First puts file system\n  (most commonly FAT32) directly on the device without any partitions,\n  effectively making it start from sector 0, without any additional boot\n  sectors, headers or partitions. Second one, uses DOS partition table\n  (and MBR code), with single (first) partition spanning entire device.\n  This partition is often aligned to some high power of 2 of sectors\n  (like 1 or 2MB), which is also common and important in solid state\n  drives for best performance and durability. Some devices with embedded\n  storage, acting like USB mass storage device (like MP3 players with\n  USB port), will report that file system is damaged or missing, if\n  formated using different file system than FAT32 (or any other\n  originally used there). However most devices which use partition (table) by\n  default can be repartitioned (by shrinking size of first partition and\n  file system) to have more partitions. Such devices, will use first\n  partition for its own operations, however after plugging into host\n  system all partitions will be available.\n\nSo it seems to me your mp3-player uses the schema where a single FAT32 partition is created on the disk without a partition table - which, actually, is exactly what fdisk is telling you. There's no partition table. Everything is OK.\n", "Q: How to burn subtitle to avi? I have tried several suggested methods and commands, mostly using mencoder with commands like this:\nsudo mencoder movie.avi \\\n-ovc lavc -oac mp3lame \\\n-sub movie.srt \\\n-font \"/usr/share/fonts/truetype/msttcorefonts/tahoma.ttf\" -subfont-autoscale 2 \\\n-o movieplussub.avi\n\nThe problem is that the subtitle is in non-Latin fonts (but still utf8) however they end up being displayed on the avi as '???????' . \n\nA: Ok, I could figured out how to (kind of) do so using this mencoder command\nmencoder input-video.avi -sub mysub.srt -subcp utf8 -subfont-text-scale 3 -subfont-outline 1 -ovc xvid -oac mp3lame -xvidencopts pass=1 -o output-video.avi\n\nNote: You need to either import a proper ttf file to your ~/.mplayer OR symlink the folder to a ttf file in /usr/share/fonts. (Doc)\nThe command can burn the Arabic utf8 fonts into AVI video, However, the only annoying thing that I see is that when a line in the .srt is long, the second line goes above the first one. \n", "Q: Ubuntu 11.10 is slow It's much slower than 11.04.

I have a dream... And in that dream I am running full HD videos in XBMC on my Sapphire EDGE HD2 media PC. It is based on the ION 2 chip. I installed Ubuntu on it and in Ubuntu I installed XBMC. I chose the “recomended” driver in the additional drivers window of Ubuntu. \nAfter this I played around with XBMC testing it out. Immediately I found the performance unsatisfactory. Playing 720p and 1080p video files caused horizontal lagging stripes, for lack of a better word, in the picture.\nNow I started reading up on installing the newest drivers form Nvidia.\nI found this explanation: http://www.ubuntugeek.com\nSubstituting gdm with lightdm it worked like a charm. After activating the new drivers I found a pleasing performance boost to the video rendering. Gone were all the horizontal lagging stripes and the first few films I saw was very pretty.\nHowever, a few of the highest resolution films still seemed to be problematic. In scenes of the movies where most of the image consisted of moving objects there where serious issues. Its not stripes or lag but simply a drop in frame-rate. (Just like playing a game with too low FPS)\nSo, I started reading more on Nvidia drivers for Linux and found some mention that the above method of installing the Nvidia drivers was not \"recomended\". So I purged and removed all things Nvidia from my system and ran this:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current \n\nI belive I also tried some other repositories as well. I even did a clean install of ubuntu trying each method with a \"fresh\" start. Still the same FPS problem.\nNow, at this point I am thinking it is a hardware issue. Maybe the hardware in this little device just cant handle the films with the best quality.\nBut here is the kicker: I installed Windows 7 and loaded it up just to see what happened. Using the exact same video file in Windows on Windows Mediaplayer it runs super smooth, no problem at all. So, obviously it is not a hardware performance issue.\nI'd hate to have to use Windows instead of Ubuntu to run on my media-PC.

(Specs)\n\nA: It looks like your XMBC isn't using VDPAU.\nYour CPU is too slow to decode HD videos, it needs special-purpose hardware from your GPU (NVidia ION 2) in order to play HD videos. VDPAU is the software component that manages this for Linux with NVidia hardware.\nIn your XBMC, in Settings -> Videos -> Player make sure VDPAU is selected as the Render method.\n\nA: Also, adding this to your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file might help:\nSection \"Extensions\"\n  Option \"Composite\" \"Disable\"\nEndSection\n\nIf you don't have a xorg.conf, run this to create it for you:\nsudo nvidia-xconfig\n\nThis method completely solved my problems with the horizontal lag in xbmc!\n", "Q: Can I remove the brightness tooltip? I don't need the tooltip because changing the brightness gives you visual feedback on its own.

(note: there is no ftp setup on the server, is it possible to do this w/o having to install anything on the server?)\n\nA: The scp answer is a good one and should work just fine if it is a small amount of files that you need transfered but if it fails or you have to stop the transfer you can use rsync.  The command would look like this rsync -rP -e ssh username@serveraddress:\"directory/file\" /destinationfolder/ the r is for recursive downloads if you need a folder, the capital P is so that you can resume what had failed or been stopped prematirely and the e ssh tells rsync to comunicate over ssh.  Hope that this helps.\n\nA: If the server is running SSH, you can use scp.\nAs scp user@host:directory/SourceFile TargetFile\nIf the server is not running SSH, you can install a web server or a FTP server on the server. Examples of web servers are Apache and Lighttpd. Example sudo apt-get lighttpd then place the files in /var/www/ and get them with wget http://example.com/file.txt\n\nA: Something you need on the other server. Normally a ssh-server should be available.

It seems to be essentially useless as the only information I get from it is whether the power cable is plugged in or not because even while discharging the battery monitor always stays stuck at 100%.  I've tried resetting the panel which doesn't fix the problem.  acpi gives the correct battery information.  Is there an alternate battery monitor or a work around for this?\nMy preference is to have something that works and displays the battery information on the panel.  I can check my battery status on the command line but that doesn't help if I just want a fast easy check.\nI've tried conky but I can't get the ${battery} command or anything related to that to display the information even though calling acpi from the command line gives the correct battery status.  I could probably write something for conky to just parse and display the output of a call to acpi but I would much rather have a fix or alternative to the battery monitor in the panel.\n\nA: There is a lightweight battery monitor called batti that may work for you.\nDownload the compressed tar file.\nUncompress it: tar -zxvf batti-0.3.8.tar.gz\nTest run the application:\ncd batti-0.3.8\n./batti\n\n\nA: I have lubuntu and upgraded to 11.10 as well and my battery icon was having the exact same problem and I tried some solution programs (batti, vubat, etc) and wasn't satisfied, so I kept on looking and discovered Xfce Power Manager. I'm not sure how 'lightweight' it is or whether it was already supposed to be installed, but it appears to be very similar, if not the same, as the original gui I'd become used to. Try it.

I've moved from Windows to Ubuntu and I have problems converting my new books (in mp3) to m4b. There are a lot of Windows applications which could do that, but what about Ubuntu?\n\nA: While there is many Windows based programs that can perform this via a GUI from what I can find on Linux or Ubuntu you will have to revert to a command line to achieve it.\nYou can try the method detailed by aking1012 but as he states I also doubt it will work on ubuntu - but you could try.\nI found a step by step guide that details coverting the mp3 to m4b by first converting to a .pcm file then converting it to m4b but this seems a long way to go and requires a lot of disk space.\nAn easier guide is on Ubuntu Forums which requires ffmpeg, imagemagick and mp3wrap and a script that is downloadable from the link to run.\n\nmp4tags etc: wget\n  http://mp4v2.googlecode.com/files/mp4v2-1.9.1.tar.bz2 \ntar -xf mp4v2-1.9.1.tar.bz2 \ncd mp4v2-1.9.1 \n./configure \nmake sudo \ncheckinstall\ncd\n\n\nRemember to do the following with the script chmod +x\n    hjb_book_creation_script.sh and run as ./hjb_book_creation_script.sh\n\n\nI'm not certain how well it works but may be worth giving it a go.\n\nA: On the linux side this is supported by some versions of libfaac or the faac binary.

I'm certain this is controlled by settings in the theme's gtk-3.0 folder, if that helps.  only 2 themes I've found change that. Adwaita is built in theme, for me it makes the selected column background all white. However, there is a nicer result if you change the theme to Zukitwo.  http://lassekongo83.deviantart.com/art/Zukitwo-203936861.  In order to run that, you have to install the murrine theme engine (I think for the gtk-2.0 apps like firefox) and then also the unico engine for the gtk-3.0 apps, like nautilus.\nAfter you do that, the nautilus selected column will be lighter.

My SiS video card uses framebuffer to display 1280x800 maximum resolution. In previous versions I had used Cheese without problems.\nSomeone can give me more light about this issue?\n\nA: Cheese in Ubuntu 11.10 started using the Clutter GUI toolkit, which requires working hardware OpenGL support.  Unfortunately, your SiS card doesn't support enough OpenGL to allow Cheese to work.  More GNOME apps plan to transition to Clutter over time (we shipped an older version of Totem in 11.10 because the newer version uses Clutter), so this problem is likely to get worse for you over time.\nThis may get resolved in 12.04 due to some of the work being done upstream on the software OpenGL renderer.\n", "Q: Will adding more RAM increase my computer's performance? I am looking to increase my computer's performance. Will upgrading my RAM by 12GB or upgrading to a 7,200 RPM Hard Drive increase my computer's performance more? I can only do one, which one will make my computer run faster? Please cite something in your answer for my own confidence. Thanks!\n\nA: Open a terminal window and run the command\nfree\n\nIt will show you if your hard disk is used for memory caching (which is slow, and should be minimised). The value you should read is Swap x used. Normally, if you have over 3GB, the Swap that is used should be 0, that is, not used at all. So, with 6GB or more RAM, you definitely do not use the disk for swapping.\nThe other thing is the hard disk, which are slow compared to an SSD disk. If you want to invest on a faster computer, then you can get an SSD disk, and install Ubuntu on this fast disk. You can still use your existing hard disk for storage of files. The SSD will be blazing fast and Ubuntu will boot + run very fast. It makes a big difference.\nUPDATE\nYou can replace your existing laptop hard disk with a 2.5\" SSD disk. These SSD disks are more expensive than traditional hard disks, but they are blazingly fast. You can convert your old laptop hard disk into an external hard disk by buying a 2.5\" external USB disk case.\n\nA: It really depends on how your system is using memory now. Examine the output of vmstat to become more informed of why data is hitting the disks. Much I/O in Linux is initiated indirectly, from flushing caches or dirty pages. These things can also be tuned.

The only times I have cause for complaint is when I'm compiling multiple packages.\n\nA: Well 8GB RAM is fairly cheap now. I bought 4GB a wile ago for about 60-70£ and now 8GB is 30-40£ so its very worthwhile. 12GB RAM will basically set you good to run a lot of applications at the same time as I do.

I've been using ndiswrapper on my old wireless card without any problem, until I upgraded to Ubuntu 11.10. ndiswrapper is not included by default anymore so I installed it from the Software Center, then I installed the driver using the .inf driver file. The wifi started to work just fine in all the system user accounts (logging in & out was OK) but after reboot, the wireless card just doesn't work (it doesn't list any wireless connection) and I have to open ndiswrapper (GUI) and reinstall the .inf driver to make it work again.\nAny ideas on how to solve this? Is it a \"daemon\" process or something that needs to be started after reboot that maybe is not being installed/configured by software center?\n\nA: As heartsmagic says, the solution was to add ndiswrapper in a new line of the file /etc/module:\ngksu gedit /etc/modules\n\nSave, close the file and reboot.\nAfter reboot, check that the module was loaded with:\nlsmod | grep ndiswrapper\n\n(this was my own question but I lost that unregistered account).\n\nA: The open source driver for my Atheros AR5005G (ath5k module) doesn't work for me.

Is it safe to run Windows and Ubuntu together on one PC? \nWill it \"mess with\" my computer? I'm using Windows 7. Thanks!\n\nA: Regardless of whether you use Wubi or set up a separate partition, your Windows install should remain safe. As with any major system change though, you may want to backup any data from Windows you consider important before proceeding, and ensure you fully understand what you are doing at every step of the install process.\nIf you have any further questions once you begin, please don't hesitate to search this site or the Ubuntu Forums for additional help. If you can't find a similar issue someone else had, then go ahead and post a new question. We're here to help!\n\nA: Wubi is safe - I haven't seen a single case where installing with Wubi has destroyed windows. Back when 10.04 was released there were some accidental bootsector issues due to grub updates but those have been long fixed now. Wubi is much safer than installing as a dual boot as Wubi does not modify any partitions. That said, partitioning is pretty safe too, but there is a small room for user error when installing a normal dual boot - and letting Ubuntu split the partition of a Win7 or Vista install is known to cause boot issues - have a Windows repair CD handy just in case.\nYou should have a backup regardless of which OS you are running. That includes the ability to restore the OS, as well as safeguard your data. If you don't have the ability to do a full restore you're asking for trouble as hard disks can fail.\nSummary - Wubi is a safe and convenient way to try out Ubuntu. Especially if you later decide you want to remove Ubuntu: it's as simple as going to Control Panel, Add/Remove and double-clicking \"Ubuntu\".\nIf you want a long term, permanent Ubuntu install it's better to partition.\n\nA: No, you should be just fine. I run wubi without problems along with Windows 7.\n", "Q: Where is the SSH Server Fingerprint generated/stored? I installed openssh-server and created a key with ssh-keygen. I then attempted to test it using local port forwarding by doing ssh -L 8080:www.nytimes.com:80 127.0.0.1. However, the key fingerprint that this command provides is not the key fingerprint I get when I do ssh-keygen -l. Even if I delete my .ssh directory, I still get the same fingerprint, which is not the one I created with ssh-keygen. Is there another key on my system? Where is this key? How can I select this key for use by openssh-server?\n\nA: When you make a SSH session, two different key pairs (with a fingerprint for each pair) are involved. One is the user's key which is stored in ~/.ssh. The user's SSH key identity is sometimes used as credentials to login to another computer (if you have set up key based login).\nThe other is the SSH server's key. This is the key you see the fingerprint for when you connect to a different server for the first time. This key's identity is used to make sure you are logging in to the SSH server you intend to. This is important if you are using passwords because you wouldn't want to accidentally try to login to an attackers machine: the attacker would get your password when you typed it in. Then the attacker could login to the machine you thought you were logging in to! (this is known as a \"man in the middle attack\") The keys a SSH server uses to identify itself when you login to it are located in /etc/ssh/ and usually named something like ssh_host_rsa_key.\nYou can actually change where the SSH server looks for the key in the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file with the HostKey /path/to/host/key setting.\nBy default, ssh-keygen will create a key for the current user, which, by default, will be stored in ~/.ssh. The format of a user key and a server key is the same; the difference is where they are placed and whether /etc/ssh/sshd_config has a HostKey directive pointing to them. When you install the openssh-server package, it automatically generates keys for the server to use. That is where the keys with the unknown fingerprint came from. If you want to see the fingerprint of the SSH server's (RSA*) key, you could run ssh-keygen -lf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub.  \n*There are different encryption algorithms. Each one uses a different key. Common ones are DSA (weak), RSA (old default), and ECDSA (new default).\n\nA: ssh-keygen does not generate the SSH fingerprint at your server.  That is generated by the SSH server. ssh-keygen creates a public/private key pair for your system that you can later use to access your SSH server without having to transmit a plain-text passcode to the server.\nThe fingerprint of your server will obviously not display as the fingerprint of the public/private key pair you generated, as they are separate from each other. \n\nA: SSH host keys are stored in /etc/ssh/, which you generally do not need to choose. These keys were generated when the openssh-server package was installed.\nYou can list the fingerprint of the keys by ssh-keygen -l -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key.pub though you will need to repeat this for each public key.\n \n", "Q: How can I add a bash script to the Unity launcher? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I create launchers on my desktop?\nHow to add a shell script to launcher as shortcut \n\nI open my favourite IDE (PhpStorm) using a custom bash script. I would like to add the script to the Unity launcher.\nI thought I could add it by clicking the \"keep in launcher\" option, and sure enough, the icon stays on the launcher after I close the app. But clicking the icon doesn't reopen the IDE - the launcher just sits there, flashing.

I've tried it in Ubuntu 12.04 and it works.\nActually, it works only if you have gnome-shell installed. But I have tried and found that even if only gnome-desktop-item-edit is present, it can still work.\n\nA: Launchers are *.desktop files, and making them is fairly easy. I do agree with you in that Unity should create a working launcher automatically, but in this case it looks like you will have to create the launcher yourself.\nTo create a launcher, just follow these steps:\"\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click on your desktop, and select Create Launcher\n\n*Name it as you like, and select for it the icon of your preference\n\n*In the Location entry, enter the location to your *.sh script - remember that it must be executable or else the launcher will not be able to open your application\n\n*The comment, needless to say, is optional to enter\n\n\nCheck out this guide on creating launchers for more information.\nOnce that you have your launcher working, move it to ~/.local/share/applications/ (where you will find other launchers perhaps), launch the application and pin it to Unity. I think it will work afterwards, if not let me know.\n\nA: I created one for Gnome Screensaver, and saved it to: ~/.local/share/applications/ \nyou may need to create this directory:\nmkdir ~/.local/share/applications   (if required)\n\nscreensaver.desktop\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Activate Screensaver\nComment=\nExec=gnome-screensaver-command -a\nIcon=screensaver\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nStartupNotify=true\n\nThen simply search in Dash for the 'Name', and move icon to launcher.\n\nA: Not refuting the previous answers in any way, but there are a couple of other options you may or may not which to consider:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have too many icons in your launcher and you don't like the accordian effect, you can add multiple executables accessible through \"right clicking\" one icon. Search \"unity shortcut group\" or \"unity quicklist\" for lots of examples.  \n\n*You can access scripts directly from your desktop via \"right click\" context menu. Search \"Nautilus Scripts\" for howtos and examples. These can be especially useful for context specific actions on objects you see/select in the nautilus filesystem browser (for example, I use scripts to \"open a terminal here\" and \"Edit with VIM\" a lot).  \nOne solution is no better than the other ... just a few more options to consider depending on the specifics of what you want.\n", "Q: Apps capable of mounting/unmounting CD/DVD Images with multi-sector or protected format What apps for Ubuntu exist that can mount/unmount CD/DVD images.

I am using ubuntu 11.10, with gnome3.\nI installed gnome-tweak-tool, in the windows menu, I selected windowos focus mode: Sloppy.\nI had never heard of it before but according to wikipedia sloppy focus means:\n\nThe sloppyfocus model is a variant of the followfocus model. It allows input to continue to be collected by the last focused window when the mouse pointer is moved away from any window, such as over a menubar or desktop area.\n\nI activated it, and I can't see no clear difference with the mouse focus mode, even when I'm typing on a text-box, it seems to completly grab focus of the other window?\nMy questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Did I understand what the sloppy mode should do?

It is like Mouse mode (Focus Follows Mouse cursor) so you do not require mouse-clicks to change the active window.\nIf you want your current window to retain input focus even if you move the mouse cursor ANYWHERE else including over top other windows, then you want to set it to \"Click\" Windows focus mode.

I have a machine that seems to have some issues, and I would like to install directly from the iso image already on the HDD. I cannot for some reason boot from a LiveCD nor from a USB stick. I attached the HDD to another machine and dumped the iso to the desktop and reinstalled to the machine with issues.\n\nA: As no one else has answered you, I will say in my ignorance that it will not be possible but I think that you can come at it from another direction. Imagine an empty but formatted hard disk as another kind of removable media. How would you use such a hard disk to install Ubuntu. Let us examine the ways we install Ubuntu.\n1) From a Live CD. We take a blank CD disk and burn the iso image to the CD. This unpacks the iso image and we then boot from the CD and we get working Linux that lets us install Ubuntu.\n2) USB stick. We take an empty but formatted USB memory stick and we use Startup Disk Creator to unpack the iso image to give us the same kind of working Linux that we get on a Live CD.\nYou cannot use either of those methods. So, perhaps you can try this. It may work. It may not.\na) Hard disk. Take an empty but formatted hard disk and connect it to a machine that has a working operating system preferably Ubuntu.\nb) Use Archive Manager to uncompress the iso image on to the empty hard disk. The iso image would be on the working machine not the problem machine. Startup Disk Creator may also do the job but as I have only ever used Startup Disk Creator once and that was with a USB stick I cannot say for sure.\nc) Connect the hard disk with the uncompressed/unpacked Ubuntu iso image on it to the problem machine and boot the machine from this hard disk.\nWith a bit of luck you might get a working Linux of the type that runs from CD and USB stick which you can use to install Ubuntu onto the hard disk that will be the main drive of the problem computer. And as it is connected to the machine it is going work in Ubuntu will be set up for that machine.\nGood luck. This may be a first. \nIf you cannot do because you do not have a spare hard disk, try attaching the disk from the problem machine to the working machine and using a Live CD or USB stick to install Ubuntu on to the second hard disk. Then put this disk back into the problem machine and hope you get a working Linux from which you can update more appropriate drivers.\n", "Q: How to edit autostart applications?

There are Ubuntu (installed by default) and Windows clients available, so you can sync files between them easily with an Internet connection.\nI use this to keep both my Windows 7 and Ubuntu 11.10 partitions on my laptop in sync with each other and my 11.10 desktop.\n\nA: Do this thing\n1.After installing the virtual box you can setup the shared folder which will be available for your windows 7 host as a normal folder but for ubuntu11.10 it will be mounted at /media/sf_name_of_your_shared_folder.\n2.This folder will be accessible only through the root account(to open it type sudo nautilus /media/ and then open it from ubuntu.\n", "Q: How do I delete a folder generated by Foremost?

I partitioned my 320gb HD into a 15 gig NTFS, 15 gig EXT4, 4 gig swap, and the rest as a NTFS storage partition.  I installed ubuntu 11.10 from a disc and followed all the steps in the guide including configuring my subfolders.  I then went straight to installing windows 7, but my install disc was pre release and would not accept my product key.  When i tried to restart and go into linux, the computer didn't even recognize the ext4 file system and went straight to the faulty windows system, I messed around with the root terminal and I think it had issues mounting the filesystem.  I had to use a bootable partition tool to wipe the hard drive again and start over. I just finished doing a fresh install of linux, currently ubuntu 11.10 is all i have on my computer. I think these instructions might be outdated, but i'm not as computer literate as i want to be and can't seem to figure out how to make it work\nI did a search, and there were plenty of topics on dual booting but I couldn't find anything exactly tailored to this. Hope it isn't a repost\n\nA: I would suggest you to install Windows first, and then install Ubuntu. \nWindows has never been particularly cooperative in terms of sharing a computer with other operating systems - its install procedure simply wipes whatever boot loader is currently installed and installs its own. Did you really expect Windows to add Ubuntu to its boot menu? :)\nUbuntu, on the other hand, will automatically recognize and add a Windows partition to GRUB menu.\nAfter you have the two OSes dual-booting, you can proceed to setting up the shared folders etc. as per the tutorial you've linked to.\n", "Q: Black area with stroked circle on the screen Ubuntu 11.10 just installed from scratch + few applications from Ubuntu Software center installed, log of installations.\nBlack area with stroked circle is appear and block UI.

In other words, users will have to be aware of this and bump the version number (correctly) each time it changes? Is that the only reason the profile isn't enforced by default?\nOr is there something else I need to do before enforcing the default Firefox profile? Will just editing /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.firefox with each change in version number be sufficient?\n\nA: In theory you don't have to do anything when the firefox version changes as the AA profile is updated too.\n\"Activating\" the FF AppArmor profile via sudo aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.firefox will enforce the policies right away, no need to reboot.\n\nA: Because it's optional and not on by default as it may be too restrictive for the average user.

Now I am wondering if one can increase their size, or if it is possible to just set the screen resoluton to 720p but (how?) view full hd movies in 1080p switching to 1080p in a easy way?\nAny ideas?\n\nA: I suspect it may be tricky due to Unity not having too many customization options at the moment. \nAlso, I would suggest you to have a look at MythTV/Mythbuntu, XBMC or some other media-center software - they may be much better suited for what you're trying to do, including UI built for 10-foot user experience, ability to control them with a remote etc.\n\nA: You can give Ubuntu Tweak a try. I used it to decrease the icon size, but you can do the opposite as well.\nYou can install it through adding the PPA to your system (sudo apt-add-repository ppa:tualatrix/ppa) and installing it via sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak.\n\nA: You can increase the size of the icons by opening Compiz Config Settings Manager, selecting Ubuntu Unity Plugin, going to the 'Experimental' tab then changing the 'Launcher icon size' slider\n", "Q: How do I recover my desktop settings after accidentally changing my home directory?

Parted told me when i used the resize command that:\n\"WARNING: you are attempting to use parted to operate on (resize) a file system.\nparted's file system manipulation code is not as robust as what you'll find in\ndedicated, file-system-specific packages like e2fsprogs.  We recommend\nyou use parted only to manipulate partition tables, whenever possible.\nSupport for performing most operations on most types of file systems\nwill be removed in an upcoming release.\"\n\nand looking up e2fsprogs tells me they are ext2 tools, which scares the hell out of me considering the disks are EXT4. \nIs there a safe way to resize the partitions?  I'm working on this 600miles away from the server by SSH with no direct access.\nThanks in Advance\n\nA: Ext2, ext3 and ext4 are evolutions of the same filesystem; in fact an ext4 filesystem with none of the newer features activated is an ext3 filesystem, and an ext3 filesystem with none of the newer features activated is an ext2 filesystem. That's why there's no separate set of programs for ext3 and ext4: it's the same set of tools, e2fsprogs, that's been gradually enhanced to cope with ext3 and ext4.\nA limitation of resize2fs (“ext2/ext3/ext4 file system resizer”) is that it can shrink a filesystem only while it's unmounted. So if you want to shrink /home, you'll need to unmount it first. You can enlarge a mounted filesystem, that won't be a problem for /.\nYour bigger problem will be resizing the RAID-0 array. The one tool to manage RAID arrays is mdadm. As far as I know, it's not possible to resize a RAID-0 array.\nAs far as I can see, you're stuck with this configuration unless you're willing to copy all the data off /home and / for the duration of the maintenance. (You could get away with copying only the data off /home and creating a larger root partition encroaching on its space.) You could use that unpartitioned space at the beginning of the disk to store the current contents of /home. This is not very difficult, but it is error-prone. That's not something I'd attempt without physical access (it's especially easy to screw up the bootloader when you're shuffling the root partition around). Your lack of familiarity with the tools makes it all the more likely that you'll make a tiny mistake that's easily fixed but only by inserting a boot CD.\nMy recommendation would be to move a large chunk of / to /home and create a symbolic link, until such time as someone can attend that server physically.\nFor the future, I recommend not using md-RAID's RAID-0 and using LVM stripping instead. LVM volumes can be resized, even stripped volumes. LVM is slightly slower here, but easier to manage (as the issue you're having now illustrates). Use RAID for mirroring (RAID-1) and for other RAID modes.\nAlso, should you decide to stick to RAID-0 for that 5% performance boost, it would have been easier if you'd had a single RAID-0 array.\n", "Q: How can I configure Gnome Shell Notification settings?

The new Ubuntu features a completely unkillable GDM. Is there a way to disable it?\nIt is not enabled in services , the GDM startup script is deleted, it is removed from update.rc but it still starts up. \nHow do I disable GDM and Graphical User Selection?\n\nA: Follow the directions of @freedev on Server Fault:\n$ sudo nano /etc/init/gdm.conf\n\nAnd change to:\nstop on runlevel [0126]\n\nAlso \n$ sudo nano /etc/init/tty1.conf\n\nAnd change to:\nstop on runlevel [!345]\n\nNote the missing 2 in the tty1.conf. This is so that you get tty1 up and running and can log on into the first console. No need to mess with GRUB. \n\nA: The prior answers (as of 20160611) discussing runlevels are only relevant for Ubuntu versions using Upstart. Ubuntu 16.04 switched from upstart to systemd. To boot to console, rather than X, you need to change the default target to boot into from graphical to multi-user:\nsudo systemctl enable multi-user.target --force\nsudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target\n\nThen reboot. To undo this:\nsudo systemctl set-default graphical.target\n\nAnd then reboot.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 10.04 you should refer to documentation for Upstart which handles starting of tasks and services during boot, stopping them during shutdown and supervising them while the system is running. \nUpstart handle start of gdm, so you should edit /etc/init/gdm.conf\nsudo vi /etc/init/gdm.conf    # or use nano if vi is unfamiliar\n\nDefault runlevel in ubuntu 10.04 is 2 so you must change this line\nstop on runlevel [016]\n\nadding \"2\" in the runlevel list\n\nstop on runlevel [0126]\n\nNow you can reboot the system.\n\nA: You can switch to some other display manager (kdm or xdm being two most widespread alternatives, but there are many more, see Wikipedia). Just aptitude install the one you want to use, run dpkg-reconfigure gdm and select it from the list.\n\nA: Why not just remove it?\napt-get remove gdm\n\n\nA: Do:\nsudo dpkg-divert  --rename --add /etc/init/gdm.conf\n\nWhich prints:\nAdding `local diversion of /etc/init/gdm.conf to /etc/init/gdm.conf.distrib'\n\nThis will allow you to disable GDM while preventing package upgrades from putting the file back in place and allowing the GDM package to upgrade the configuration file.\nIn the case of 11.x and above lightdm is used instead of GDM.  I instead used the command:\nsudo dpkg-divert --rename --add /etc/init/lightdm.conf\n\nTo undo it replace the rename and add with a remove.\n\nA: Recent versions of Ubuntu are using upstart instead of SysV init.\nRename /etc/init/gdm.conf to /etc/init/gdm.disabled.\nFor Kubuntu, rename /etc/init/kdm.conf to /etc/init/kdm.disabled.\n\nA: I found this forum thread to be very helpful:\nThe solution that I found that worked consistently was post 30 by iscatel:\n\nwell, this disables sound, as a previous post pointed out, but here goes:\nin /etc/default/grub, comment out (by placing # at the start of the line)\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nand add \nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"text\"\n\nthen\nsudo update-grub2\n\nthis will pass \"text\" to the kernel at boot time\n  line, disabling gdm.\n\nif it still does not work, you can \necho \"manual\" > /etc/init/gdm.override\n\nand try it again. I used Ubuntu 12.04 32-bit server with GNOME core and it worked for me. \n\nA: For those who arrive on this topic, follow the instructions of freedev, but instead of stop gdm on run level 2, you should prevent it from starting on runlevel 2 :\nEdit /etc/init/gdm.conf\n$ sudo vi /etc/init/gdm.conf\n\nChange this line\nand runlevel [!06]\n\nBy this line\nand runlevel [!026]\n\nYou can also exclude others run level (3, 4 and 5) \n", "Q: Remapping Alt + F2 in Unity I disabled the Alt + F2 default shortcut in unity (ubuntu 11.10) using ccsm and I set a new shortcut using the default system shortcut manager (system settings > keyboard).

According to the messages there the only thing that might possibly help, is to use the upstream kernel 3.1. Unless you know how to compile a kernel, I suggest to wait until there is a better solution.\n\nA: Have you tried to install a newer kernel ? \nThere is no need to compile a new kernel, just follow these simple steps :\nInstalling a newer kernel is easy and even if it doesn't work, you can choose your old kernel in the grub menu when booting.\nI'd recommend 3.1.2 from here because it's the latest stable version.\nYou need to download 3 files, the linux-headers-generic, linux-headers-all and linux-image file.\nInstall the 3 files with\nsudo dpkg -i linux-*.deb\n\nIf your computer complains about a missing module-init-tools package, you can download that here.\nInstall it with sudo dpkg -i module-init-tools*.de and repeat the install of the 3 kernel files.\nAfter the installation is complete, simply reboot and you will boot with your new kernel. To make sure you are running your new kernel, open a terminal and type\nuname -r\n\nthe output should be your new kernel.\n\nA: Yes - a more recent kernel seems to fix that problem!\nLook at the launchpad bug #869502 (especially at comment #150) that is related to the reported problems here.\nToday I activated the proposed archive for Ubuntu 11.10 that installed kernel 3.0.0-15 at my ASUS Eee PC (1000) and fixed my freezes. :)\n", "Q: Why does Transmission BitTorrent client say \"could not connect to tracker\"?

But you can try to let it through the firewall manually.\nIn summary, you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to your router's setup page and set up manual port forwarding for bittorrent on your machine.\n\n*If that doesn't work, try using some bittorrent application other than Transmission, such as qBittorrent.\n\n", "Q: Rename USB stick appends nA to name I try to rename a usb stick (i.e. give it a new label). Both using gparted and mlabel I get following behaviour: The rename works, but the string \"nA\" is appended to the name (it is less than 11 characters). This is very annoying, because the appended string is right-justified, and spaces are inserted in the middle between my name and the \"nA\", resulting in a new label like \"new-name nA\".\nAnyone have an idea how to get rid of the \"nA\"?\nUpdate: This behaviour only takes place with new names that are at least 8 characters long.\n\nA: It's a bug in mtools and a patch was offered earlier this month.\nThe bug entry mentions a partial workaround (pad it out with underscores until you hit the label length limit and the nA is pushed off the end).\nAnother I have is to add a space to the end of your desired label (eg. \"DOCUMENTS \").

I don't know the correct value, or the consequence of changing it.\n\nA: As answered by Derek and edited by Peachy in another answer here, and also discovered by me at the launchpad-users team mailing list archive, the problem is referrer headers (or lack thereof).  Ubuntu One Single SignOn service uses referrer headers to protect against Cross Site Request Forgery and therefore this feature must be enabled in your browser in order to log in using their service.\nTo enable this feature, you must type about:config in your Firefox or Iceweasel browser URL bar and then after agreeing to the scary warning page, enter into the search box the following key:\nnetwork.http.sendRefererHeader\nOnce this value is located, you can right click on it and select Reset from the menu that pops up in order to restore it to the Mozilla default of 2, or you can double click on it and change the value from 0 to 1 or 2.  This enables the sending of referrer headers.\nIf you wish to still have control over this feature for privacy purposes, then you can use an addon such as Referrer Control to allow you to create custom rules for individual sites and/or set a default referrer policy for all sites.  Documentation for that addon is available at:\nhttps://github.com/muzuiget/referrer_control/wiki\n(Sorry if you have to copy and paste the preceding link but I have not enough \"reputation\" to post more than two links.

The reason for this is that those keybindings are special to the terminal by default, so the terminal will catch them before they reach whatever program you're running inside the terminal. \nWhen the terminal recieves CtrlC, it sends the INTERRUPT signal to the program running inside the terminal. Most programs will abort when they recieve this signal.\nWhen the terminal recieves CtrlS, it stops scrolling output. This is useful if you're running something that is outputting a ton of data to the terminal. Hitting CtrlS, you can pause the output to look more closely at that particular part. CtrlQ resumes.\nWith the stty command, you can change these keybindings.\n\nA: Gedit is surely a good choice but it's not command line based.If you really need notepad's functionality then you may use it with wine.

In Ubuntu I use SSH to log in to my webserver.  The IPv4 side of things is configured and already works, I can log in from other machines.\nBut I'd like to configure the IPv6 side of things while I'm logged in using IPv4 (if that's possible with a single NIC).\nIs it possible to specify that you only want to restart the IPv6 stack / interface and not the IPv4 one?\n\nA: You can issue the commands to manually configure the IPv6 stack manually.  ip -6 is your friend here, both for setting things up and checking things out.  \nThe same config scripts that configure IPv4 configure IPv6.  They will configure whatever is set, so you can't use them to configure IPv6 without restarting IPv4.  Depending on what is configured you will start with any combination of IPv4 and IPv6.  \nYou will likely find that IPv6 is already configured in link local mode.  The following is an example /etc/network/interfaces stanza.  This is for a host getting the gateway from a radv notification.  The MTU is to handle a 4to6 or 4in6 tunnel to the Internet.  However, if you are using a radvd daemon most of your servers should configure themselves.  You only need the stanza if you want to add the hosts to DNS.  Your radvd will need one or two stanzas to setup it's interfaces.\niface eth0 inet6 static\n    address 2001:DB8:1234:16::10\n    netmask 64\n    mtu 1480\n\nI documented my IPv6 setup for OpenWRT, and the radvd setup works for Ubuntu.

In my reading, I've found that there were some changes to multi-arch packages.\nDoes anyone know how I can repair my system to get around this problem?\n\nA: Try sudo apt-get install -f. It will probably give some suggestions about removing and installing packages, do what seems reasonable. If that doesn't help, try booting into recovery mode and choosing the \"fix broken packages\". If that doesn't work... I don't know, I'd reinstall Ubuntu if I were you. (This is a good reason to always have /home on a separate partition!)\n\nA: The latest release added multiple architecture support.  32 bit libraries are added as 32 bit libraries.  I suspect you need to install the ia32-libs-multiarch.  Try these commands:\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs-multiarch:i386\nsudo apt-get check\n\nCaught me by surprize.  Also I found aptitude hasn't been updated to support the change. \n\nA: You need to enable multiarch before attempting to install 32 bit libs:\n echo foreign-architecture i386 | sudo tee /etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg.d/multiarch\n\nAfter doing so, you should then be able to install whatever 32 bit libs you need.\n\nA: Digging this up since I found this topic while looking for the same answer. The following fixed it for me, and seemed to be the result of manually installing a newer version of CUPS (trying to get airprint to work -- no luck there either -- which removed acroread) :\n\n\n*\n\n*if you have not already done it, install Synaptic from the Software Center\n\n*Next search for libcups2\n\n*Package -> 'force version' to the correct one (in my case 1.5.3-0ubuntu8 from precise-updates)\n\n*Finally, install acroread and rejoice.\n\n\nA: Just simply replace the \"apt-get\" part of your command with \"aptitude\" and follow the instructions and then you will must probably be okay.\n", "Q: How to escape file path in SED? I would like to replace $fileWithPath in $file, however this doesn't work because (I think) path is not escaped. How to escape it?\nsed -i 's/${fileWithPath}/HAHA/g' $file\n\n\nA: sed -i 's|'$fileWithPath'|HAHA|g' file\n\nSingle quotes define a string literal. Putting the variable outside the literal allows the shell to expand that part.\nAlso: if you are going to parse paths, use a delimiter in the sed command that doesn't confuse with the directory delimiter \"/\".\n\nA: A better way for literal strings with forward slashes: \nsed -i \"s|my/path|my/other/path|g\" myFileOfPaths.txt\n\n\nA: In circumstances where the replacement string or pattern string contain slashes, you can make use of the fact that GNU sed allows an alternative delimiter for the substitute command. Common choices for the delimiter are the pipe character | or the hash # - the best choice of delimiting character will often depend on the type of file being processed. In your case you can try\nsed -i 's#'$fileWithPath'#HAHA#g' $file\n\nThe character 'g' after last # is used to change all occurrences in file if you need to change only first occurrence then remove the 'g'. \n", "Q: Delay in sending mail postfix queue I have a mail server that periodically connects to the Internet via modem dialup and before was able to send emails with attachments of 300kb and 500kb in just only 1 or 2 minutes, I have not made ​​any change in postifx and now I take longer than normal to out postifix queue, sometimes it took more than 10 min to deliver an email of just 300kb, if this is in queue with others mails containing only text accompanying the rest out normally while the of 300kb containing an attachment is delayed more than usual. previously this was not happening and all the emails was sending very quickly.\nany suggestion of what is going on here? this can be caused by a very long postfix maillog file that needs to be rotated, or reconfig the mastercf?\n\nA: It might be the new spam controls in place around the Internet.\nYou probably should configure Postfix to send the emails directly to your ISPs mailserver for processing it.\n", "Q: How do I modify the message notifier widget in the Unity global menu?

I tried the following code to replace QQ with ZZ, but it doesn't do what I want:\nvar1=QQ\nsed -i 's/$var1/ZZ/g' $file\n\nHowever, this code does what I want:\nsed -i 's/QQ/ZZ/g' $file\n\nHow do I use variables in sed?\n\nA: The shell is responsible for expanding variables. When you use single quotes for strings, its contents will be treated literally, so sed now tries to replace every occurrence of the literal $var1 by ZZ.\nUsing double quotes\nUse double quotes to make the shell expand variables while preserving whitespace:\nsed -i \"s/$var1/ZZ/g\" \"$file\"\n\nWhen you require the quote character in the replacement string, you have to precede it with a backslash which will be interpreted by the shell. In the following example, the string quote me will be replaced by \"quote me\" (the character & is interpreted by sed):\nsed -i \"s/quote me/\\\"&\\\"/\" \"$file\"\n\nUsing single quotes\nIf you've a lot shell meta-characters, consider using single quotes for the pattern, and double quotes for the variable:\nsed -i 's,'\"$pattern\"',Say hurrah to &: \\0/,' \"$file\"\n\nNotice how I use s,pattern,replacement, instead of s/pattern/replacement/, I did it to avoid interference with the / in \\0/.\nExample\nThe shell then runs the above command sed with the next arguments (assuming pattern=bert and file=text.txt):\n-i\ns,bert,Say hurrah to &: \\0/,\ntext.txt\n\nIf file.txt contains bert, the output will be:\nSay hurrah to bert: \\0/\n\n\nA: We can use variables in sed using double quotes:\nsed -i \"s/$var/r_str/g\" file_name\n\nIf you have a slash / in the variable then use different separator, like below:\nsed -i \"s|$var|r_str|g\" file_name\n\n\nA: To expand (pun intended) on @mani's answer,\n\n*\n\n*this solution will work for regular expressions fed to other commands, such as perl\n\n*use double quotes around the regex (yes, even under Unixy systems) in\norder to expand the variable as expected\n\n*| may appear in your variable's value as well, so don't be scared to try other delimiters\n\n", "Q: How to turn off airplane mode?

Usually we direct people to use one of these methods, which involve having a usable live CD of Ubuntu or a similar GNU/Linux distribution.\nThat's what you'll have to do if none of your installed operating systems are bootable (though you can probably use your openSUSE CD/DVD or bootable USB flash drive for this, if you have one). However, if you are able to boot into openSUSE, then you should be able to reinstall GRUB2 to the Master Boot Record in openSUSE. To do that, I recommend using the chroot method to chroot from your openSUSE system into your Ubuntu system and reinstall its GRUB2.\n", "Q: How do I convert any ubuntu istallation to a command-line system?

Almost every desktop environment that has reached an acceptable amount of quality has structures to appear good for most private users. The user's home directory has sub-directories like \"my music\", \"my movies\", \"my photos\" - but why is there no desktop environment (in best case very lightweight and effects-free) that comes with a structure like \"my projects\", \"my drafts\", \"my image resources\", \"my laboratory/unit tests\"?\nI use Linux as a webserver for running rails-apps and as a development machine for rails, c# mono, somewhat ASP mono and of course for browsing the web.\nWhere is the desktop environment for people like me? Or better said, for every person that is developing applications in a GUI-based IDE.\nHave all the hackers and free contributors forgot to unify their requirements for work in a desktop environment of their kind?\nImagine a desktop environment, serving all your requirements - and demands on getting it lightweight, installed with all dependencies by hitting apt-get install developers-desktop.\nOr does it already exist and I just have not found it?\n\nA: The XDG specifications that define Documents, Pictures, etc. do not have such locations defined. I suppose you could attempt to convince FreeDesktop.org to add developer-specific environment variables.\n\nA: I think Ubuntu is designed for most common users--much more than developers. But still you can create your own environment for your work as Ubuntu is Linux--which is totally free to use and free to change. I have used Arch Linux and I installed XFCE as desktop environment, it only had a Desktop folder. You can also create your own folders. I think it may not cost you too much time to set up your familiar work environment. \n\nA: Having pre-defined folders isn't necessarily desirable. I've maintained my basic folder structure across operating systems for more than ten years. In that time, the way the system wants you to structure your files has changed. However, I see no reason to change a system that works for me.\nIn my opinion, the desktop environments are at fault for creating default folders and not providing an easy way to change them to any arbitrary location. It seems awfully arrogant for them to assume that it's possible to set up a default layout that works for everyone.\nThus, adding more default directories would be a step in the wrong direction. Furthermore, as already noted, it'd be nearly impossible to get everyone to agree about what the defaults should be. You suggested \"Image Resources\" and \"Laboratory/unit-tests.\" Both of those would be useless to me, because I keep all such data in a subdirectory of the relevant project. Having such high-level directories, while certainly UNIX-y, seems crazy to me. But, other people might think that my system is crazy. So why not just create your own directories as you want them. It's incredibly simple:\nmkdir -p \"my projects\" \"my drafts\" \"my image resources\" \"my laboratory/unit tests\"\n\n\nA: The answer to why there is no such desktop is very simple: \n\n\n*\n\n*Developers can do stuff like this (creating directories) extremely fast, probably faster than doing sudo apt-get install developer-desktop\n\n*Very few developers want all their project files in the same folder, but prever a per-project structure, based on the kind of project they are working on\n\n*Most developement tools create those structures for you in a per-project way: quickly create ubuntu-application helloworld, django-admin create-project helloworld, ...\n\n*The number of developers is much smaller than the number of users for nearly all public projects. And even this small number is highly opinionated about what tools they want to use: try asking on stackoverflow if emacs, vi, eclipse or mono.develop is the best IDE and you will see what I mean... also note that those questions are off-topic now, so don't try it.\nSo, even this small number of developers will probably not want to use that developer-desktop\n\nA: I think you should try awesome window manager. It is free and very lightweight. To install on ubuntu do sudo apt-get install awesome. It is very customizable and remember editors like vi. It takes time to learn and adapt, but I think it is the desktop environment that best fits as a developing environment.\n", "Q: How do I run keepass2?

All these alternatives use the debian installer with a text mode menu, a TUI (text user interface). It may look old-fashioned, but it works well.\nSo Lubuntu can be installed directly via its alternate iso file and CD. Standard Ubuntu and the other Ubuntu family flavours (Kubuntu ... Xubuntu) can be installed via the mini.iso or the Ubuntu Server iso files and CD.\nPlease notice that 12.04 LTS has passed end of life. Select a current version.

Select only the packages, that you really want. It is possible to install packages afterwards, but may be difficult to remove some of the packages completely afterwards (for example the desktop environments).\n\n\nText user interface of the 12.04 mini.iso\nThe current versions of the mini.iso provide similar text user interfaces\n\n", "Q: How add panel 3d unity in gnome shell (not panel 2d unity) How to add panel 3d unity in gnome shell, not panel 2d unity.\n\nA: I guess this is not possible because unity-3d needs compiz and gnome-shell needs mutter (another window manager) and you can't run compiz and mutter at the same time.\n\nA: it is not possible.\nunity is strongly depended on compiz and compiz is not possible in gnome-shell.\nyou can use just unity 2d pannel or launcher in gnome shell.\nif you use unity 2d panel, you must activate appropriate extension for gnome-shell to put shell panel on bottom and put unity 2d panel on top. but am can't figureout why you want this?\nam understand if you want  unity launcher with dash funcion. if you want that find \"main meny\" app in meny and find unity 2d launcher and check it to be visible in meny. \nthen, activate gnome-shell extension \"light overview\" and you have in activities just window-s preview and workspace swicher. \nor use unity 2d panel, cairo-dock , compiz and openbox/gnome if you dont like unity launcher\n", "Q: Where can I find a g++ 4.7 package? Some time ago, I managed to find PPA featuring g++-4.7 build. However, I had to reinstall everything on my machine and I lost name of that PPA. Could anyone point me to it? I tried to find it again, but without any luck. I'm on Ubuntu 11.10 installation.\n\nA: The Toolchain test builds PPA contains many packages including gcc-4.7.\nYou can add the repository using \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test\n\nThen, to install it use\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install g++-4.7\n\nTo change the default compiler use update-alternatives\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.6 60 --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.6\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.7 40 --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.7\nsudo update-alternatives --config gcc\n\n\nA: I haven't found a PPA for g++-4.7 but there is a gcc-snapshot package.\nI guess you have to compile it yourself:\nhttp://www.lukaszbyczynski.com/archives/208\n\nA: See http://ask.debian.net/questions/backporting-more-recent-versions-of-the-gcc-toolchain-to-debian-stable\nfor my description of backporting gcc 4.7 to Debian stable.\n", "Q: Unable to upload directly from network drive to picasaweb My network drive is bookmarked and clearly visible in nautilus. \nOne little thing that I do not like in ubuntu is that network drives are not always available from applications. Last time I have noticed this was when I was trying to upload pictures to picasaweb from my home server. When picasaweb opens up nautilus the network drives are not visible anymore.\nTyping in the link to the drive in the location field does not work either. \nI think the same problem is valid for the photobook program from pixum.\n\nA: You can work around this limitation by connecting to the network share by mounting it on your system, rather than connecting to it in Nautilus. (It will then still be accessible in Nautilus, as a drive, and it will appear as a drive in other applications too, including other applications that don't display Nautilus's gvfs mounts.)\nOne way to do this, assuming these are Samba (SMB/CIFS) shares (i.e., Windows or Windows-style shares, including the default way to share folders on an Ubuntu system over a network), is to use smbmount. For example, to mount a network share called foo on a computer called 192.168.1.100, logging in to that machine as the user ek, you can first create a mount point for it by opening a Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T):\nsudo mkdir /media/foo\nAnd then, when you want to connect t it, mount the share:\nsudo smbmount //192.168.1.100/foo /media/foo -o user=ek\nWhen you run commands with sudo and you see [sudo] password for user32762: (assuming user32762 is your username on the Ubuntu machine from which you are connecting), you should put in user32762's password for the local machine (i.e., the machine you're connecting from). But after running sudo smbmount ..., you'll also (or perhaps only) be asked for a password, and that's ek's password on the remote machine (i.e., the machine you're connecting to).\nWith the share mounted in this way, you can access its contents from any application (just browse to /media/foo).\nWhen you're done using the share, you should unmount it:\nsudo umount /media/foo\n\nA: Also, note that if you've accessed a network share already, and it's showing up in your normal nautilus sidebar with a little 'eject' sign next to it, then it will be mounted inside the hidden .gvfs directory in your home folder\n    /home/user/.gvfs/name_of_mounted_share/\n\nYou can toggle the show hidden by\n    ctrl-h\n\nIn nautilus, or I think the upload window too.\n", "Q: How to make unity hide applications from the launcher if they're running on other desktops/workspaces? I would like to be able to hide applications running in other workspaces, under Unity.\nFor example, chrome is open in workspace 1, and when I go to another workspace, it should be hidden from the launcher.  Is this possible?\n\nA: No, that's not possible. The launcher shows all running apps and doesn't provide a way to hide some.\n", "Q: NFS Mount fails on startup I have multiple Ubuntu servers, recently I've installed a few 11.04 servers (and 1 desktop) and I've just found that upon rebooting the nfs mounts will not mount.\nI've tried upgrading nfs-common to the latest version (I'm only one small revision behind) but that just slightly changes my errors.  All of these servers having the issues are clones (vmWare) from a server template I made awhile back, so I thought maybe it was an issue with the template and therefore all of its clones.  I then tried the same mount on the Desktop 11.04 but I had the same issues.  About half the time I will be able to press \"S\" to skip but the other half of the time the server freezes (and I restore from a recent snapshot). Also whats odd is that if I am able to get into the system then I can do a \"mount -a\" just fine and it will mount everything. This makes me think the issue is that nfs isn't waiting for a network to be present in order to try mounting.  Something else that makes me think this is that I get a \"unable to resolve host\" (to an NFS point) error, even though that host is in /etc/hosts.\nHere is my /var/log/boot.log\nfsck from util-linux-ng 2.17.2\nfsck from util-linux-ng 2.17.2\n/dev/sda1 was not cleanly unmounted, check forced.\n/dev/mapper/php53x-root: clean, 75641/1032192 files, 492673/4126720 blocks (check in 5 mounts)\ninit: portmap-wait (statd) main process (373) killed by TERM signal\ninit: statd main process (402) terminated with status 1\ninit: statd main process ended, respawning\ninit: statd-mounting main process (355) killed by TERM signal\nmount.nfs: Failed to resolve server NFSSERVER-priv: Name or service not known\ninit: statd-mounting main process (416) killed by TERM signal\nmount.nfs: Failed to resolve server NFSSERVER-priv: Name or service not known\ninit: statd main process (435) terminated with status 1\ninit: statd main process ended, respawning\ninit: statd main process (459) terminated with status 1\ninit: statd main process ended, respawning\nmountall: mount /var/www [410] terminated with status 32\nmountall: mount /var/users [436] terminated with status 32\ninit: statd-mounting main process (448) killed by TERM signal\ninit: statd main process (468) terminated with status 1\ninit: statd main process ended, respawning\ninit: statd main process (498) terminated with status 1\ninit: statd main process ended, respawning\n/dev/sda1: 226/124496 files (1.3% non-contiguous), 39133/248832 blocks\nmountall: fsck /boot [268] terminated with status 1\nmount.nfs: rpc.statd is not running but is required for remote locking.\nmount.nfs: Either use '-o nolock' to keep locks local, or start statd.\nmount.nfs: an incorrect mount option was specified\nmountall: mount /var/users [583] terminated with status 32\nmount.nfs: rpc.statd is not running but is required for remote locking.\nmount.nfs: Either use '-o nolock' to keep locks local, or start statd.\nmount.nfs: an incorrect mount option was specified\nmountall: mount /var/www [575] terminated with status 32\nmount.nfs: rpc.statd is not running but is required for remote locking.\nmount.nfs: Either use '-o nolock' to keep locks local, or start statd.\nmount.nfs: an incorrect mount option was specified\nmountall: mount /var/www [638] terminated with status 32\nmount.nfs: rpc.statd is not running but is required for remote locking.\nmount.nfs: Either use '-o nolock' to keep locks local, or start statd.\nmount.nfs: an incorrect mount option was specified\nmountall: mount /var/users [645] terminated with status 32\nmount.nfs: rpc.statd is not running but is required for remote locking.\nmount.nfs: Either use '-o nolock' to keep locks local, or start statd.\nmount.nfs: an incorrect mount option was specified\nmountall: mount /var/www [724] terminated with status 32\nmount.nfs: rpc.statd is not running but is required for remote locking.\nmount.nfs: Either use '-o nolock' to keep locks local, or start statd.\nmount.nfs: an incorrect mount option was specified\nmountall: mount /var/users [729] terminated with status 32 Skipping /var/www at user request\n * Starting AppArmor profiles        [80G  [74G[ OK ]\n * Starting Name Service Cache Daemon nscd        [80G  [74G[ OK ]\nFATAL: Module vmhgfs not found.\nFATAL: Module vmsync not found.\nFATAL: Module vmblock not found.\n * Loading open-vm-tools modules        [80G  [74G[ OK ]\n * Starting open-vm daemon vmtoolsd        [80G  [74G[ OK ]\n\nSorry for the long post, just wanted to convey as much information as possible.

Also a good idea to make a \"comment\" in your fstab so people know where everything is actually being mounted from as that will be the first place they'll look.\n\nA: Not sure if this is applicable to you, but the problem I was having was that the directory I was trying to mount at was not available at boot. I instead tried mounting to /mnt and it worked.\n\nA: I was having the same issue after upgrading ubuntu 14.04 to 14.10. Here is what solved the problem for me:\nEdit /etc/default/nfs-common and make sure it says:\nNEED_STATD=yes\n\nAfter restarting, my NFS mounts worked.\n\nA: If you are used window 8 then surely nfs formatted disks will not mount and the answer for this problem is\"just again install Windows 8 and disable hibernate option in settings\"then only you will able to mount nfs formatted disks.\n", "Q: How to uninstall NetBeans?

If not, press Ctrl-Alt-F1 (Ctrl-Alt-Fn-F1 if you have media keys), and login to the text prompt.\nResolving package inconsistencies, if any\nNow. First, finish any incomplete updates that may have been interrupted.\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\nIf this repairs anything, it's possible no further repairs will be necessary; simply skip to the Finishing up step below. If nothing is repaired, the package integrity of your system is good, and PPAs may indeed be resposible.\nInstalling a PPA removal tool\nFirst install ppa-purge...\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\n\nIf you're using Ubuntu 10.04, you need to add lucid-backports to your software sources.\nRemoving potentially damaging PPAs\nAnd then uninstall PPAs from your system like so, replacing ricotz/testing with the PPA you want to remove:\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:ricotz/testing\n\n(If you do not know what PPAs you have installed, you can check with cat /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*.list | grep ppa. The PPA names correspond the unique portion of the URLs, such as ricotz/testing for ppa.launchpad.net/ricotz/testing/ubuntu/)\nFinishing up\nFinally, update your system and restart.\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo shutdown -r now\n\nHopefully you will reboot into a fixed Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Problems Connecting MSN with empathy I don't know if I am the only one with this bug, but I can't use my MSN account with a freshly installed Ubuntu 11.10 with Empathy.

Severely beat anyone who gets close.\nOr lock it up.\nIf your computer is physically accessible, it is unsafe.\n\nA: A quick and easy way to do this is to disable booting from CDs and USB sticks in your BIOS and set a BIOS password. \nAccording to this wiki page:\n\nPlacing passwords or locking menu items (in the Grub configuration files) does not prevent a user from booting manually using commands entered at the grub command-line. \n\nHowever there's nothing stopping someone from just stealing your hard drive and mounting it on another machine, or resetting your BIOS by removing the battery, or one of the other methods that an attacker can use when they have physical access to your machine.\nA better way would be to encrypt your drive, you can either do this by encrypting your home directory, or encrypting the entire disk:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I encrypt my home partition?\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FullDiskEncryptionHowto\n\nA: First the warning...\nThe grub2 password protection procedure can be quite tricky and if you get it wrong there is a possibility of leaving yourself with a non-bootable system.

This is a confirmed bug in 11.10. A poor answer, but for now I suggest subscribing to the bug:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gtkpod/+bug/883962\nIt appears to be the result of missing libmp4v2, which was dropped from 11.10.

This is a very old one, so I wonder how did you manage to get this infection or if this is a new variant.\nSee the Symantec page on this worm for more information.\nUnfortunately it seems that all (document, media, archive) files are replaced by executable virus files, thus the original data is lost. (Do you really have these hidden doc files in the same directory?). To be more precise, the virus description says:\n\nWhen a file with any of these extensions is launched, the worm will\n  move the file into C:\\Recycled under a random file name and replace\n  the original file with itself, adding .exe to the suffix. For example,\n  song.mp3 will become song.mp3.exe, and this file will be the worm. The\n  original file is not executed.\n\nI think at least one of your windows clients have been infected by the worm, so on this machine there might be some remnants of data in the Recycled folder.\nYou should remove all parts of the virus first on all the windows clients, then try to recover the data if possible. Although it would be wise to create a full backup of the offline system to minimise data loss if something goes wrong.\nFinally make sure to remove the infected files from any network shares that were accessible by the windows clients.\n", "Q: How to run MU ONLINE? hi i am new in ubuntu still. i want to run mu online it is just 1 game with i play, but still can not run it. i downloaded wine program, but it looks that i need to download more or to do something. when i go to webzen page and click start game they offer me download webzen game starter. i downloaded it and instaled, but whne i press again start game it sed that i must download webzen game starter again. =( can somene help me?\n\nA: According to the Wine AppDB, Mu Online does not work with Wine, and thus cannot be run in Ubuntu.

KVM / XEN / QEMU? Okay, The main purpose is to learn about virtualization and play around with it. However, I have a problem of determining which is best for a headless server. I want to run several Linux distributions as well as Windows guests.\nOn a Side Note: This is not the first time I am going to use virtualization. For more than 3 years I have been using VMWare Workstation and VirtualBox to run guest VMs\nHowever, now I want to run VMs/VEs in a headless server as they do in industry. I know, in industry there are lot of advanced technologies are being used but, still I want to try them in SMALL-SCALE. As I mentioned before, this is purely for educational purposes.\nIf you're wondering what kind of system that I am going to use as my host, here are some details:\n\n*\n\n*Intel processor that supports hardware virtualization (Intel-VT)\n\n*8GB RAM\n\n*More than enough Hard disk space (~1TB)\n\nCan you give me some suggestions, directions and links for tutorials and guides?\nP.S. I installed VMWare vSphere Hypervisor on my \"host\" and later noticed that it uses just over 1GB of RAM just to run the hypervisor. It is not an efficient solution for me because I have only 8GB RAM in my machine. Typical Linux Headless server only uses ~300MB RAM just to run. So, I prefer Linux Server. In fact I love FOSS :) :)\n\nA: You mention \"in industry\" a couple of times. Fact is these different virtualisation technologies, along with others like OpenVZ, all get used in industry. Most of them have certain merits like:\n\n*\n\n*being able to maximise density through burstable RAM (for cheap OpenVZ VPS hosting)\n\n*offering fair shares of the hardware (for more expensive, lower density Xen VPS hosting)\n\n*ramming a server full of applications with the least overhead (eg LXC, OpenVZ)\n\nYou can get a fairly raw comparison of features on the Kernel Newbies' Virtualisation site but they don't really delve into industry application.\nSo what should you use?\nWell... I think if you're doing this for educational purposes you should probably try at least two to compare their features, performance and how easy they are to set up and maintain for yourself.\nI would personally suggest Xen. I use it as a customer (I have no set up of it) but I can speak for its guest performance and I know it can host Windows machines too (as long as your CPU supports vmx and the copy of Windows you're planning on installing is that for HyperVisor).\nXen should also have dom0 in the default Ubuntu kernel (that needs checking). This essentially means any install of Ubuntu can be a Xen host without having to fanny around with patching the Kernel.\nBut Xen reserves RAM for a machine indefinitely. If you're planning on something a whole lot more burstable (where VMs get the guts they need, when they need them) perhaps you want to look at a looser container like OpenVZ. The only problem with these is you'll need another solution for Windows.\nKVM is very popular in the developer world. Simple to get going. Similar performance to Xen but I just have no experience with it but plenty of developers do (I follow several FOSS blog \"planets\" and there's usually at least one mention about KVM per week).\nAlso, you can run VirtualBox in headless mode if you're looking for something more familiar.\n", "Q: My mouse pointer disappears on \"system surfaces\" , like background picture, menus, background for all kind of system menus I have an annoying problem with Ubuntu 11.10, my mouse pointer disappears on the Ubuntu surface ( not in programs like firefox, libre office ..) \nThe mouse pointer is there, but its size is only one pixel and in the white background of e.g. \"system\" it is not seen at all, although with \"ctrl\" I can see where it should be.\nI have not found any place where I can change the size or colors of the mouse pointer.\nCan anybody help me?\n\nA: Found this answer and it worked for me. \n\n\n*\n\n*Mouse cursor won't appear on boot \n\nI had this problem on a Dell Optiplex 955.

The cursor theme settings are on Theme page -> Cursor theme.\nAlternatively Dconf Editor can change the size of the mouse cursor:\nInstall dconf-tools with Software Center or sudo apt-get install dconf-tools. \nThe cursor size can be changed on: org -> gnome -> interface -> cursor-size.\n", "Q: USB 2.0 and NIC not recognized on a ASUS M5A97 Pro I have much trouble with Ubuntu 11.10.

Then if it does exist I want to remove the whole line (then by appending && echo \"vm.swappiness=1\" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf to that command, it would also subsequently add the new configuration line that I want to the end.\nBut again since there could be a lot of different parameters in one line, it wouldn't be good to delete it all, but would be better to change only the number (to the immediate right of vm.swappiness=).\nWhat you think? Would it be better to search for vm.swappiness=x(x(x)) with 1 to 3 numbers (of course, 100 also exists...), replace if it's there (by putting it into a variable and using a command like `sudo sed -i 's/$oldline/$newline/g'), and if not then just append vm.swappiness=10?\n\nA: You can do such replacements with awk.\nawk '/^vm.swappiness/ {print \"replacement\"; found=1} !/^vm.swappiness/ {print $0} END {if (!found) {print \"appended\" }}' filename\n\nThe filename parameter at the end is the name of the text file that contains the lines.\nThe above command replaces any line that begins with wm.swappiness with replacement (modify to your need).

Thus if no replacement was made, the END block appends one line with the appended string (this should also be modified).\n(Please note that I am not taking into account the permissions, this is solving only the replacement or append problem).\n\nA: You can use\nsed 's/vm.swappiness=[0-9]*/vm.swappiness=1/g' /etc/sysctl.conf\n\nIf you don't mind how many digits your number has.\nIf you want a maximum of 3 digits, you need extended (modern) regular expressions rather than basic regular expressions (BRE's).

If I unterstand it correctly, LightDM has replaced GDM per default. I wonder if it's possible to make it run the things I put in my .xinitrc file ... what I need is an option below \"Unity\" and \"Unity 2D\" which says \"Run a user-defined session\".\nIs that possible? Should be the easiest thing, but I did not get a clue so far. I export and define and run a lot of things in this file, so it's pretty important for me to have control over that.\nWhat I do NOT want is a custom session in /usr/some/where, I only want it to run the stuff from each user's xinitrc (or similar).\n\nA: Create a new file /usr/share/xsessions/default.desktop (The name is up to you, but it has to have .desktop suffix):\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Default\nComment=This runs user session and logs you into Ubuntu\nExec=default\nIcon=\n\nNow when you select this session in lightdm and log in, your ~/.xsession file, if exists, will be executed.\nNote that the user's file that is executed is ~/.xsession, and not ~/.xinitrc, which was mentioned in the question. (~/.xinitrc is used when the X session is started using the startx script from a command line.)\nSome explanations:\nThe Name entry is what lightdm would display for this session. The Exec entry is the important thing, and it should be the name of the program that starts the actual session. When you log in, lightdm calls the /etc/X11/Xsession script, passing it the value of Exec as an argument, and Xsession will, eventually, execute this program (for example, it could be startxfce4 for starting a xfce4 session).\nIf the Exec entry is the special string default, then Xsession will execute the user's ~/.xsession file. (Xsession would also execute ~/.xsession if it's called without aruments.)\nSorry, I'm new here and hence cannot comment on other people's answers, but I'd like to comment on the accepted answer, to make things clearer. As per my explanation above, what will happen with that answer's method is that Xsession would be called by lightdm with an argument which is (the full path of) Xsession. So Xession will run and then call itself, this time with no arguments. The second Xsession, being called with no arguments, will execute the user's ~/.xsession. So the desired action will, eventually, be taken, but in a bit awkward way.\n\nA: Create a new file /usr/share/xsessions/custom.desktop with:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Xsession\nExec=/etc/X11/Xsession\n\nYou should now have a new session option during login, Xsession will load the user's ~/.xinitrc.\n\nA: To use olvwm:\n1) Type sudo apt-get install olvwm in a console\n2) Create this session : \n/usr/share/xsessions/olvwm.desktop\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Open Look\nExec=olvwm\nType=Application\n\n", "Q: Why does the installer view my partitioned hard drive as one non-partitioned disk?

So instead of simply pushing \"back\" button I have to deal with a launcher.\nI think this is unity's launcher design problem. Should I file a bug or what? \n\nA: I had the same \"problem\" which I fixed by installing CCSM (CompizConfig Settings Manager) and setting in the Ubuntu Unity Plugin the option Hide Launcher to NEVER. This way when the browser opens the left side of it will be right next to the launcher and not on top or below of it so you can see both, the launcher buttons and the browser buttons.\nThere is no need to approach the edge slowly, not have the buttons in their typical place or not have it maximize since this are not solutions to the confusion between both elements.\nAfter changing the option in the Unity Plugin, at least in my case I had to reboot to take effect. Just in case it happens to you. You safe with this some valuable seconds when browsing and want to check something quickly.\nAt the end it should look like this:\n\nSee how the browser's left limit is the actual launcher and not the resolution border.\n\nA: I doubt this is a bug. To me, it sounds like you have your browser set up such that the Back button is positioned on the far left side of the window, which is maximized. To make the launcher appear, you'd have to be moving the mouse against the side of the screen with a certain amount of speed to it.\nMy suggestions in this case are to either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the position of the Back button on your browser, if it lets you do this\n\n*Unmaximize your browser and move it away from the screen edge\n\n*Approach the edge more slowly when using the Back button\n\n*Tweak some settings governing the launcher's behavior in ccsm (in particular, try increasing the \"Edge Reveal Timeout\" setting, if you're running 11.10)\n\n*How do I stop that launcher from popping up when mouse goes to the left edge?\n\nA: Unity side bar is hidden by default in Ubuntu (all versions since 11.04). This is a feature not a bug. \nThe Compiz solution is just a changed setting and not a work around. Your cursor held to the very left, needs to be ever so slightly increased so that bumping it to the edge doesn't reveal it. \nAuto hiding is not a bug, but a feature that can easily be adjusted to whatever your preference may be; auto-hide or always present.\n", "Q: Graphics card problem I'm having a ATI Radeon HD 4550 graphics card.\nThe performance of my desktop is faster and smoother without install the driver for it.\nAfter installing the driver, the performance of my desktop is slower and less smooth.\nWhat should I do? Install the driver or not?\n\nA: My recommendation with some AMD/ATI radeon graphic cards on Ubuntu 11.04 and above is that you NOT install the proprietary drivers from AMD. I've made the experience that flash games and movies are slower with the proprietary driver and that you can have problems with supend/hypernation.\nWith Ubuntu 10.10 and lower, it's better to install the proprietary driver, there are no performance issues and so on.\n\nA: You can try this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install package compizconfig-settings-manager.\n\n*Run it.\n\n*Click the General - OpenGL icon.\n\n*Uncheck the \"Sync to VBlank\" option.\n\n\nIf this does not help, you can just set it back the way it was, but it helped my system a lot.\n", "Q: Why is Ubuntu default to allow everyone access to other users folders, Admin or Standard? Why can other users see all my files by default, admin or standard users?  Surely only the Public folder should have a default share, with the option to share other folders with users and groups as the owner pleases?\n\nA: According to the security team policy:\n\nBy default, Ubuntu is designed to allow users to easily share files and help each other (see bug 48734). To support this, each user's default home directory is readable by all other users. Private files could be kept in the \"Private\" sub-directory, where access permissions can be set to limit access by other users (mode 0700). If restrictive home directory permissions are a priority for your system, please investigate the /etc/adduser.conf file for adjusting various settings when creating new users, including the default permission mask for newly created home directories. \n\n\nA: While it would be nice to have most of your files invisible, it would be impractical for situations where you need read access to to the files (for example in recovering files, or in copying the files to another system) but do not have access to the account (lost password, unable to login because of bad settings, etc).\nRemember, no one can write to your folders by default unless they are logged in as root, logged in as you, a member of your group, or running a live CD.\n", "Q: Is Ubuntu visible on a Windows network? In windows 7, after configuring the network as \"home network\", there is the option to create a 'home group' where all the computers on that network are visible.

Let your Ubuntu system install the required components and logout and login again. Now you can share files and folders with a windows system with your username and password you have set in Ubuntu.\n\nA: Yes it can. I've tested this many times and it works just fine.

Note: if you want to disable all audio in wine, use winetricks sound=disabled.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open a terminal and run regedit.\n\n*Go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Wine\\Drivers\n\n*Set Audio to alsa\n\n\nTo restore Ubuntu's default value, repeat the first 2 steps and then set Audio to pulse.\n\nA: that can be done via winetricks also:\nwinetricks settings sound=alsa\n\nto see all available options:\nwinetricks settings list | grep sound\n\n\nA: I am aware that wine has just undergone a complete rewrite of the audio system and maybe winetricks could still help with your question...\nIn a terminal run\nwinetricks\n\n\n\n\n\nA: Another way is running gstreamer-properties and selecting ALSA, OSS or PulseAudio in the Default Output and Default Input options. Whichever option the user prefers. Works like the winetricks mentioned by fossfreedom but this is only for sound in general. In his case you can do a lot more.\n\nA: All you need to do is enable Alsa and disable all others in winecfg. You can also try padsp wine insert-application-name-here, this will redirect it to OSS, but fixes many problems with sound.\nIf you do not see the option there, you may be able to add it to your .reg file (You may need to look at the WINE Wiki to find out how to do this).\n\nA: I agree with FossFreedom, however I would add that you may also need to un-install Wine and delete the .wine folder, and then re-install a fresh copy of Wine, should your Windows application are not working properly. \nThis time configuring Winetricks as described BEFORE installing any Windows application. \nWorked for me.\n", "Q: No color in xubuntu wallpaper For some reason, my ubuntu wallpaper suddenly turned black and white.

For example, I didn't setup partitions for /, /home, etc. Setup completed the installation without notifying me anything.\n\nA: I suggest you start a new thread for each of your questions.\nLet me give you a basic understanding of partitions in Ubuntu or generally every other Linux distro.\nIn a Linux system everything is file including all your hard drive partitions, your optical drives and every other I/O device. All those files are located inside a space called \"root\".\nBasically if you see it from a \"Windows Viewpoint\", that root partition is where your Ubuntu is installed.

The laptop screen will not display.  \nRunning xrandr gives the following (when both externals are hooked up):\n\nScreen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 3600 x 1080, maximum 8192 x 8192\nLVDS1 connected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\n    1600x900       60.0 +   50.0\n    1440x900       59.9\n    1360x768       59.8     60.0\n    1152x864       60.0\n    1024x768       60.0\n    800x600        60.3     56.2\n    640x480        59.9  \nVGA1 connected 1680x1050+1920+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 473mm x 296mm\n    1680x1050      60.0*+\n    1600x1200      60.0\n    1280x1024      75.0     60.0\n    1440x900       75.0     59.9\n    1280x960       60.0\n    1152x864       75.0\n    1280x720       60.0\n    1024x768       75.1     70.1     60.0\n    832x624        74.6\n    800x600        72.2     75.0     60.3     56.2\n    640x480        72.8     75.0     66.7     60.0\n    720x400        70.1  \nHDMI1 connected 1920x1080+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 531mm x 298mm\n    1920x1080      60.0*+\n    1600x1200      60.0\n    1680x1050      60.0\n    1280x1024      75.0     60.0\n    1440x900       75.0     59.9\n    1152x864       75.0\n    1280x720       60.0\n    1024x768       75.1     70.1     60.0\n    800x600        72.2     75.0     60.3     56.2\n    720x480        59.9\n    640x480        72.8     75.0     60.0\n    720x400        70.1  \nDP1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nHDMI2 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nHDMI3 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDP2 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDP3 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\n\nAs you can see, the LVDS1 display is \"connected\" but no resolution is selected, even though a resolution is selected under the \"Monitors\" window.  Am I doing something wrong?  Or is this even possible?  Sorry if this is a stupid question.\n\nA: I have tried same thing with my HP dv9087ea but can not get all three monitors run in same time. I think laptops can not do that.\n\nA: From the information you posted, you only have Intel Integrated Graphics: You can totally ignore people saying anything about NVidia.  While not 100% accurate, 2nd generation means Sandy Bridge.  That generation of CPUs only supported 2 monitors.  You can verify that, but for that it would be useful to have the exact model of your CPU.\nHowever, I know my i7-2630QM is a Sandy Bridge CPU ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Bridge ).  If you look it up at ark.intel.com, you get this.  Under the section \"Graphics Specifications\", you'll find \"# of Displays Supported ‡\", which says 2.  I'd suggest you try the same for your CPU.\nYou have to go over the CPU information.  The reason for this is that Intels descriptions of integrated graphics are always very vague.  Some CPUs might have features in their GPU that others don't (eg Celeron vs i7).  The only way is to look up on Intels website.\n\nA: I have a very similar xrandr listing on my Latitude e3660, and tried much the same thing using the 12.04 normal display configuration thingy - no dice.\nActivating the laptop screen LVDS1 and committing just gave me a weird dialogue box that repeatedly tried to draw itself while it gradually drifted down the screen, and never filled in the body of the window - just showed the background through. It stayed around after I cancelled the display configuration thingy (without saving the change) until it escaped off the bottom of the screen and I restarted my login session to make sure it didn't get anywhere interesting - should probably report it as a bug.\nWith a feeling it was a limitation of available video memory and/or trying to have a display that's too wide for the chipset, I tried stacking the screens on top of each other, reducing their resolution to fit into the original two large screen footprint, but... nope.\n\nA: I just stumbled over this while googling something. It is possible to run it with three monitors, but without any 3d acceleration, because nvidia and intel use differen glx versions, which both install in the same place.

It will grey out the ENABLE WIRELESs on the network manager if pressed, and will ungrey it when pressed again. So it seems to have no effect on the actual hardware.

\nBus 002 Device 012: ID 12d1:1465 Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.\n\nUbuntu 10.04\n\nA: I believe the problem you're having is because the Huawei K3765 uses USB \"mode-switching\" to tell the dongle to stop being a CD drive (where the windows drivers are) and to just be a 3G modem.\nIf I'm right, just install the usb modeswitching program and it should work automatically:\nsudo apt-get install usb-modeswitch\n\nNow unplug the modem and plug it back in.\nIf that works, the linux kernel has the basics to work with your modem.\nFollow the steps in How do I connect to the internet with a \"Huwaei Ec1260\" modem? to get things set up.\nFor more info on USB mode-switching and why it's needed, take a look at     http://www.draisberghof.de/usb_modeswitch/\nEnjoy\n", "Q: Use Totem's decoder to re-encode video? I recorded an OGV screencast in GTK-RecordMyDesktop that seems to play back differently in different players (and YouTube doesn't seem to understand the video stream at all -- it just displays  a green blob). When I try to use ffmpeg to transcode the OGV to OGV the video races to the last frame in the first few milliseconds. However, Totem plays the video back fine.\nSo, my question is: is there a way to use the Totem decoder (which I know understands the OGV file properly) to transcode the video through ffmpeg? That would presumably repair it. Thanks!\n\nA: I installed Transmageddon and it was able to transcode to a WebM video that I could upload through YouTube. I guess Transmageddon uses the same codec set that Totem does. (GStreamer?)\n", "Q: Is there a desktop application for launchpad.net? I was looking at the Launchpad.net and came to this page (see the screenshot below). I started wondering if there are any desktop applications for using Launchpad.net without the necessity of a web browser.\n\nAre there any?\n\nA: This is commonly used for a number of command-line tools, such as those in the ubuntu-dev-tools package,\nThere is also a desktop client called Ground Control . which mostly focuses on bugs & branches.\nAlso under development is a Unity Lens which currently can search people, packages & bugs by number. This doesn't use the Launchpad credentials in the screenshot, but the anonymous access.\n\nA: There is a list of programs that use the Launchpad API.\nIt contains desktop applications (eg. Bughugger), but I could not find a mention for a full-blown desktop client.\n\nA: Yes. It's called Ground Control .\n", "Q: Install Intel HD graphics I have just installed ubuntu 11.10 on my PB EasyNote TK i3.

I'm new to Ubuntu and know installing programs only from window. It is very easy there: Just double-click the setup.exe and the things start. \nBut how do I install a program on Ubuntu? \nI want to install something which I couldn't find in the Ubuntu Software Center. I downloaded a .sh file and now I don't know what to do with it.\n\nA: First you might need to give the .sh file permission to execute.\nchmod +x file.sh, then you can execute it with ./file.sh.\nYou can also right-click on the file, select Properties, then select Permissions and then select 'Allow executing file as program'. Then you double-click the file and select 'Run in Terminal' or 'Run'.\n\nA: You can the file permission via the command line console in your Ubuntu.\nOpen a Terminal Window and type:\nchmod 777 downloaded_file.sh\n\nAfter you changed the file attribute, you can execute those file directly via terminal window or click it when you use file manager. Your installation file should be working now.\n\nA: It is a shell script file, so you don't necessarily need execute permissions on it. You may run it in gnome-terminal using sh downloaded_file.sh. It works because it is just a text file, and sh interprets it line by line.\n\nA: An .sh file in Ubuntu is pretty much the same as a .bat or .wsh file is in Windows. What the program does, or how it works, is completely up to the developer. It is not possible to answer \"how to install an .sh-file\", except to say \"read the README\".\nIt's poor practice to provide such programs. You should always look for .deb files, which is roughly comparable to .msi files in Windows, I believe. That is, you'll double click it, and it'll get installed. \n", "Q: I want to install libssl.0.9.8 I'm trying to install utorrent program, and when I execute the program I get \n./utserver: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.0.9.8: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nI'm navigating the different forums since yesterday and I didn't find anything helpful till now, so please tell me what's the problem ??\n\nA: On Ubuntu 12.04 64bit version, it worked to install the 32 bit version:\nsudo apt-get install libssl0.9.8:i386\n\nBut, of course, when you're on 32 bit Ubuntu, this should just work (without the :i386):\nsudo apt-get install libssl0.9.8\n\n\nA: If you are using 11.10 (since you did not mention it) you then have libssl1.0.0 which is higher than 0.9.8. Any program that needs 0.9.8 will also be able to handle versions above that one.\nIf you do NOT have 11.10 then you have several ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the OpenSSL site: http://www.openssl.org/ and follow installations there.\n\n*Go to Ubuntu Packages and download the .DEB from there: http://packages.ubuntu.com/\n\n\n*\n\n*LibSSL 0.9.8 - http://packages.ubuntu.com/natty/libssl0.9.8\n\n*LibSSL 0.9.8 - http://packages.ubuntu.com/oneiric/libssl0.9.8\n\n*LibSSL 1.0.0 - http://packages.ubuntu.com/oneiric/libssl1.0.0\n\n\n*Go to Debian Packages and dowload the .DEB from there: http://www.debian.org/distrib/packages\n\n\n*\n\n*LibSSL 0.9.8 - http://packages.debian.org/squeeze/libssl0.9.8\n\n\n*Install it via apt-get or aptitude:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install libssl0.9.8 - For 0.9.8 Version\n\n*sudo aptitude install libssl0.9.8 - For 0.9.8 Version\n\n*sudo apt-get install libssl1.0.0 - For 1.0.0 Version\n\n*sudo aptitude install libssl1.0.0 - For 1.0.0 Version\n\n\n\nA: In general you should search for software through the software center or if you like the command line, you can use apt-cache search. \nIn this case, the following package showed up (on 11.10): libssl0.9.8\nYou could try to install it (sudo apt-get install libssl0.9.8).

Right-click on the launcher then select 'Remove from Panel'.\n\nA: The latest version of Gnome Classic (Apr 2012, at least for me) requires:  Alt + Super (Windows) and right-click.\n", "Q: How to ignore Ctrl-A when a different escape sequence is already chosen With release 11.10, an old byobu setting I had from screen no longer works. I used to just add\nesacpe ``\n\nat the end of ~/.byobu/keybindings to make the tickmark by escape for byobu key sequences.  That allowed me to free Ctrl-a to get the standard Readline / Bash / Emacs / ... emacs behaviour of jumping to the beginning of the line.\nNo more.  Now byobu-ctrl-a interjects, and I have not been able to figure out to the old behaviour (in essence: all defaults, but ` as escape sequence) back.\nHints, or better still, solutions, would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: You can set this up using byobu-config. Just type that in the command line and select \"Change escape sequence\" and off you go. Admittedly it only allows you to set a Ctrl- sequence.\nThis does appear to edit ~/.byobu/keybindings for you. I tried editing it by hand and it worked for me. The contents of mine with backtick working is:\nsource /usr/share/byobu/keybindings/screen-escape-keys\nescape ``\nregister x \"`\"      #     | Goes with the F12 definition\nregister x \"^A\"\n\n", "Q: How do I mount the documents folder on a different partition? I'm new to unity and trying to harmonize my dual boot between windows and ubuntu by setting the documents, pictures, videos, etc folders onto a storage partition, instead of in the home folder. I added this line to my fstab\n# storage mount\nUUID=66E53AEC54455DB2 /media/storage/    ntfs-3g        auto,user,rw 0 0\n\nRebooted, then went to configure my subfolders like this:\n# This file is written by xdg-user-dirs-update\n# If you want to change or add directories, just edit the line you're\n# interested in. All local changes will be retained on the next run\n# Format is XDG_xxx_DIR=\"$HOME/yyy\", where yyy is a shell-escaped\n# homedir-relative path, or XDG_xxx_DIR=\"/yyy\", where /yyy is an\n# absolute path.

I can get to media/storage/Documents from the filesystem, but when I go to documents under places, it's still located on the wrong dirve.  nothing I save appears on the storage partitition unless i directly put it there, and nothing i put in the storage partition appears in the documents folder under places. \n\nA: During Ubuntu setup you can change the mount longs of folders. Backup all information on your Ubuntu partition, and boot to the install disc. When prompted for where to put Ubuntu, choose \"Something Else\" to bring up the advanced partition editor. Set the mount point for / where your current ubuntu install is. Then select the storage drive and set the mount point to /home/username/Documents, /home/username/Pictures, etc, replacing username with your username.\n\nA: I followed the steps below to install /home in another NTFS partition and it has been working well for a month.\nI have an NTFS partition for Windows Data (/sda6 in my case, but you must use your own partition's name). Note that this partition must not contain the Windows OS, and you must have ntfs-3g installed.\nI mounted this partition in /media (but you can use /mnt if you prefer): \nsudo mkdir /media/whome sudo mount /dev/sda6 /media/whome\n\nNext, I copied the directory /home to the directory /media/whome (using cpio instead of cp):\ncd /home/ sudo find . -depth -print0 | cpio --null --sparse -pvd /media/whome/\n\nNext, I unmounted the partition: \nsudo umount /media/whome\n\nNow, to avoid keeping the old home in backup folder: \nsudo mv /home /respaldo\n\nNow, mount the new /home partition: \nsudo mkdir /home sudo mount /dev/sda6 /home\n\nNow the most important step, to mount this partition every time the system boots: \nsudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bk ##(security backup) \nsudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\nand add this line at the end: \n/dev/sda6 /home ntfs nodev,nosuid 0 2\n\n\nA: Check permissions on folder /media/storage/Documents. Your user should be set as the proprietary for the folder.\nI'm not sure if this type of permissions can be set for NTFS partitions contents. If not, try using ext2 filesystem for the storage partitions, which is now supported by Win7.\n", "Q: Dash not searching files Unity's Dash is not searching files that I have opened before, only Applications. Neither Global nor Files lenses are showing any results.\nIn then Files lens, I can view most recent documents, but that's it.\nI suspect it is caused by my home folder's encryption, due to errors displayed in /var/log/syslog:\n\n[ 1868.382095] ecryptfs_encrypt_page: Error attempting to write lower page; rc = [-5]\n  [ 1868.382099] ecryptfs_writepage: Error encrypting page (upper index [0x000000000000000f])\n\n\nA: The error messages you're seeing here are related to ecryptfs obviously, but they're actually a red herring.  That is, they should not actually be causing Unity's Dash to not search your files.\nI thought, perhaps, Unity blacklisted encrypted files in the way that updatedb and locate do, but that does not appear to be the case.  I can confirm that I have an encrypted directory with file names, and Unity's dash is able to search my files okay.\nFull disclosure: I am the author of Ubuntu's Encrypted Home Directory feature and the current maintainer of eCryptfs.\n", "Q: Export Display - Can't open display I'm running xubuntu 11.10.

I recently bought a Nvidia GeForceGT 430. When I boot into Ubuntu, it looks low quality. I think its because I don't have the device drivers. Does anyone know how to download the drivers?\n\nA: Type in \"drivers\" from the unity launcher. Open \"Install Additional Drivers\" from the menu. You should see two options to install latest drivers created by NVidia and tested by the Ubuntu team. This should work, but note that since it is a proprietary driver, you may have some issues.\nI would recommend launching nvidia-settings from the terminal and seeing if there are any obvious settings that you can tweak to get some better performance.\nIf you are still having trouble, you could download the drivers straight from the NVidia site:\nx86 - http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux-display-ia32-285.05.09-driver.html \nx64 - http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux-display-amd64-285.05.09-driver.html\nI would use installing from NVidia as a last step if you simple cannot get anything else working. \nBest of luck!\n", "Q: How to force a proprietary driver to load on startup? I've been having some problems with the driver for a wireless NIC supplied with the 3.0.0 kernel. I've compiled and installed the proprietary driver for it, so that I can switch it once the system has booted with: \n# Remove the driver included with the kernel\nsudo modprobe -r rtl8192cu\n# Use the proprietary driver\nsudo modprobe 8192cu\n\nThe module locations are\n\n\n*\n\n*rtl8192cu : /lib/modules/3.0.0-12-generic/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/rtlwifi/rtl8192cu/rtl8192cu.ko\n\n*8192cu (proprietary driver): /lib/modules/3.0.0-12-generic/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/8192cu.ko\n\n\nI know these are probably very basic questions, but I'd like to know about the following: \n\n\n*\n\n*Why is the system using the driver included with the kernel ? Is it because its path has some kind of priority? Or because it is included by default with the kernel?\n\n*Is blacklisting the rtl8192cu module the right way to make the propietary 8192cu module load at startup?\n\n*Is there any other way to make the system automatically load the proprietary driver by default?\n\n\nA: Since it is included with the kernel as a module, unless you blacklist the old module, it is loaded at the boot time because of having a device using that module. After installing an other driver, you need to blacklist the old one. \nBlacklisting is the right way. But you should add the new module to /etc/modules file.\n", "Q: Upgrading Graphics Chip on Notebook I know this isn't exactly a Ubuntu question but in my experience the Ubuntu community has been the best and most helpful for anything vaguely computer related. I am running a dual-boot 64-bit Windows 7 Pro (I suck at using wine and my windows partition is used only for games) and Ubuntu 64-bit 11.04 (haven't upgraded to O.O. Yet) on an HP ProBook 4520s using an ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5470 graphics card, and was wondering if it is possible to upgrade this card, and if so what the best card to upgrade too would be?\n\nA: The few models I know, where you can actually upgrade the video cards are usually really high-end. I have tried to find details on your machine, but have not found anything indicating yours can. I have only read that in some efforts to save money, some OEM's shipped your HD 5470 with DDR3 instead of DDR5 memory which could lead to poorer performance. It supports GDDR5, but due to cost savings, the card may often be outfitted with slower DDR3 memory.\n", "Q: How to make sure my system has Nvidia Optimus?

I called back Dell Support in France and once again they told me all XPS 15 with i7 have Nvidia Optimus disabled in them even though the systems have two graphics chipsets (Intel and Nvidia).\nI installed Ubuntu 11.10 but before installing Bumblebee or Ironhire I want to make sure my system has no Optimus.\nThe command     ~$ lspci -vnnn | grep VGA\ngives the following:\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Intel Corporation 2nd Generation Core Processor Family Integrated Graphics Controller [8086:0116] (rev 09) (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: nVidia Corporation Device [10de:0df5] (rev a1) (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])\n\nHow can I make sure of this.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: I dont understand what the  Dell Support in France told all XPS 15 with i7 have Nvidia Optimus disabled in them. All XPS ships with nvidia Optimus enabled in it. And there is no straight forward method for Switching it Off/On even in the BIOS. \nBut the fact is that, while using Ubuntu, only the Intel Graphics will be used and not the nvidia card. \n\nSumming it up, Your system currently doesnt run Optimus (In Ubuntu). It only uses\n  your Intel graphics. And if you want to use nvidia Graphics (Which you\n  payed, but never used) install bumblebee.\n\nThere is some interesting discussion regarding Optimus in XPS. Find it here and here\n", "Q: Why doesn't GNOME Shell run smoothly on my hardware? I'm having problems running GNOME Shell with my NVIDIA 7025/nforce 630a (on-board). The animations don't run smoothly when I configure my BIOS to give 512MB to the chipset. The only solution I've found is to change the shared RAM to 128MB. After this, the animations run well but I can only use 128MB for some applications.\n\n\n*\n\n*AMD Athlon 240x2 2.7GHz\n\n*2GB of ram\n\n\nA: You have a combination of things that can be improved. NVIDIA 7025/nforce 630a on-board video controller is \"at best\" a minimal performer. Recommend upgrading if at all possible.\nAMD processor is a 2MB/AM3 which is not bad but if the board is a AM3 then there are other pieces that are faster than a AMD Athlon 240x2.\nMostly the GPU suffers from the nforce 630's performance. This is probably where your issues stem from. read specs here \nNow all that being said. I would recommend Lubuntu as the system of choice.\n", "Q: What is the best way to secure my EC2 server in regards to the SSH? I have a Amazon ec2 instance, and was curious on if I should change the username (the default is ubuntu) or not?\nSince you need a public SSH key in order to access the server, I don't think you do, but the fact remains - should I change the username for that server?\n\nA: Unless you have disabled user/password authentication on your server I would suggest changing it. From a security standpoint having one component of the authentication will make it easier. \nSetting up SSH key authentication\nUser@Host:~$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096\n\nafter generating your key you would do the following:\nUser@Host:~$ ssh-copy-id <username>@<host>\n\nYou will then want to verify that the key is working before disabling password authentication.\nUser@Host:~$ ssh <username>@<host>\n\nYou should be prompted for the passphrase you established when you created the key. If you are and you connect to the server you can now disable password authentication.\nmodify your /etc/ssh/sshd_config by changing the following line:\nChallengeResponseAuthentication no\nPasswordAuthentication no\nUsePAM no\n\nAfter this you want to reload the SSH server\nUser@Host:~$ /etc/init.d/ssh reload\n\n\nA: As previously mentioned, moving from 'default' is almost always a good idea, security-wise.  Changing your username from ubuntu to something else may prevent unauthorized access.  However, every system has a 'root' account, and with it as an example, you can provide other measures of security for your machine/users.\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure that root login is disabled.\n\n*Prevent password login for users on your machine. (This is especially important in the case where your target username is known)\n\n*Install a means of banning brute-force login attempts (fail2ban is a good option)\n\n*Change your server port number.\n\n*Whitelists are better than Blacklists.  If you can tell your SSH server which IP's are allowed to connect, you can dramatically decrease attacks. (This can be complicated and cause problems in the future, so read and be prepared if you take it this far)\n\n", "Q: LightDM will not start after stopping it [UPDATE: I appreciate the suggestions you posted, but since I couldn't make anything work in the end, I ended up re-installing Ubuntu a little while ago.]\nI am running Ubuntu 11.10 \"Oneiric Ocelot\", and in trying to install the nvidia CUDA developer drivers I switched to a virtual terminal (Ctrl-Alt-F5) and stopped lightdm (installation required that no X server instance be running) through sudo service lightdm stop. \nRe-starting lightdm with sudo service lightdm start did not work: A couple of * Starting [...] lines where displayed, but the process hanged. (I do not remember at which point, but I think it was * Starting System V runlevel compatibility.\nI manually rebooted my laptop, and ever since booting seems to hang, usually around the * Starting anac(h)ronistic cron [OK] log line (not consistently at that point, though).\nFrom that point on, I seem to be able to interact with my system only through a tty session (Ctrl-Alt-F1).\nI've tried purging and reinstalling both lightdm and gdm, as well as selecting both as the default display managers (through sudo dpkg-reconfigure [lightdm / gdm] or by manually editing /etc/X11/default-display-manager) through both apt-get and aptitude (that shouldn't make a difference anyway) after updating the packages, but the problem persists. \nSome of the responses I'm getting are the following:\nAfter running sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm (but not ... gdm) I get the following message:\ndpkg-maintscript-helper:warning: environment variable DPKG_MATINSCRIPT_NAME missing\ndpkg-maintscript-helper:warning: environment variable DPKG_MATINSCRIPT_PACKAGE missing\n\nAfter trying sudo service lightdm start or sudo start lightdm I get to see the boot loading screen again but nothing changes. If I go back to the tty shell I see lightdm start/running, process <num> but ps -e | grep lightdm gives no output.\nAfter trying sudo service gdm start or sudo starg gdm I get the gdm start/running, process <num> message, and gdm-binary is supposedly an active process, but all that happens is that the screen blinks a couple of times and nothing else.\nOther candidate solutions that I'd found on the web included running startx but when I try that I get an error output [...] Fatal server error: no screens found [...]. Moreover, I made sure that lightdm-gtk-greeter is installed but that did not help either.\nPlease excuse my not including complete outputs/logs; I am writing this post from another computer and it's hard to manually copy the complete logs. Also, I've seen several posts that had to do with similar problems, but either there was no fix, or the one suggested did not work for me.\nIn closing: Please help! I very much hope to avoid re-installing Ubuntu from scratch! :)\nAlex\n\n@mosi\nI did not manage to fix the NVIDIA kernel driver as per your instructions.

Any clues?\n\nA: Sounds like you're running Gnome Panel 3. You can edit your panel just like before, but you need to hold Alt and right click instead of just right clicking directly. Unfortunately, Ubuntu's indicator applet hasn't been ported to the new gnome-panel yet, so you will need to get creative for some of the missing elements.\nIf you're interested, you can take a look at a blog post by one of gnome-panel's developers that explains the changes: gnome-panel is dead,long live gnome-panel!\n\nA: Did you upgrade to Ubuntu 11.10 from 10.04 or previous? \nCorrect me if I'm wrong but it sounds like you were using GNOME 2 before Unity (11.10 new desktop environment).\n\nA: The panel in 11.10 is a completely different panel from the one used in 10.10. Though they look similar, they are completely different programs and the new one doesn't support moving stuff around, like the old Gnome Panel did. There are good reasons for this, of course, but that discussion is beyond the scope of this answer. The old desktop panels are still available, though. If you want it, you can get it by installing the gnome-session-fallback package. You will then be able to choose Gnome Fallback before you log in by clicking on the button next to the password field. There are a couple of changes in Gnome Panel 3; \n\n\n*\n\n*To edit the panels, you press the alt-key and right-click the panel. \n\n*The system menu has been replaced with a gnome-control-center, which is available from the user menu on the right. \n\n*You no longer have to lock and unlock applets, but you do need to press alt+middleclick to move it (or alt+super+middleclick). \n\n\nI would recommend that you familiarize yourself with Unity, keeping in mind that it is a different desktop. It's a different workflow, so things will be a little different. It is highly effective to work with, but coming from Gnome Panel, it might require a little getting used to.

Not only it is an inappropriate answer to the question but also in my humble opinion it is against the spirit of the Ubuntu community to use and promote proprietary Windows software.\nBut back to your question, Proteus has two famous products Proteus PCB which is an EDA suite (electronic design automation) and Proteus VSM for analog circuits and microcontroller (MCU) simulation. You did not mention which one are you referring to but people are usually looking for the VSM alternatives as it is a great software for simulating MCUs as well as AVR development board Arduino. Unfortunately, there are not many cross-platform Free, Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) as powerful and feature-rich as Proteus VSM but there are some attempts.

How do you find all packages that were manually installed which are not a dependency of any other installed packages?\n\nA: The short answer is: use aptitude like in the following:\naptitude -F%p search '?installed?not(?automatic)\n\nBut unfortunately this command returns many packages that match the query but are not what you expect, for two reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*there are packages installed during initial installation of the system that result as non automatically installed\n\n*packages installed as dependencies of a metapackage also can result as non automatically installed\nThe solution I came to some time ago is a match between the preceding command and the dpkg logs, that at least try to remove the influence of the point 1. in the preceding problems' list:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nexport LC_COLLATE=C\n\neval $(lesspipe)\n\nvars=($(less $(ls -rt /var/log/dpkg.log*) | grep 'status installed grub-pc' | head -1))\ndate=\"${vars[0]}\"\ntime=\"${vars[1]}\"\n\njoin \\\n  <(aptitude -F%p search '?installed?not(?automatic)' |\n    sort) \\\n  <(less $(ls -rt /var/log/dpkg.log*) |\n    awk -v date=$date -v time=$time '(($1 == date && $2 > time) || $1 > date) && $3 == \"install\" { print $4, $1, $2 }' |\n    sort -u) |\n  awk '{ print $2, $3, $1 }' |\n  sort\n\nThis assume that grub-pc is the last package installed during initial installation, and is in no way perfect, but can give you a rough information to start from.\n", "Q: How to move my Home-Directory?

And how do I mount this partition permanently as my home-directory?\nMany thanks for an helpful answer.\n\nA: As per my point of view \nplease understand the merit and demerit of moving home folder to other file system\n\nNTFS is not suitable for an home partition, there are certain type of file system objects (character devices, named pipes, etc) which are required for certain services but are not supported on NTFS. source\n\nIt's not a good idea to have the whole of /home in a fat32 or NTFS partition because those two Windows filesystems don't support Linux permissions. Also, the /home folder has many hidden files and folders (these have a leading . i.e for hidden files) for configuration and I don't know what effect this would have in Vista, or whether Vista would interfere with these..\nBut what I do is to have a separate NTFS partition for data and set up symlinks from my /home in Linux and whatever the equivalent is in Windows (links? shortcuts?  ). So - say I have a 'Music' folder in my NTFS data partition, then I create a symlink called 'Music' in my Linux home and a link called - yes, you've guessed it - 'Music' in Windows My Documents. (I'm using XP.) In fact I also multiboot several Linux distros, so I do the same in each. Whichever distro/OS I'm in I can access the same files from my home folder by double-clicking on the symlinks (which look like folders with bendy arrows in Linux)\nIf I am wrong correct me \n\nA: Follow these commands\nusermod -d /home/your_home_directory USERNAME\nchown -R USERNAME /new_location/your_home_directory\n", "Q: Disabling touchpad I have a dell inspiron computer.

I am trying to create an 11.10 VirtualBox client using the same DVD I used to upgrade my host system. (It happens to be the alternate DVD ISO.)\nHowever, it keeps hanging when the progress bar reaches about 70%. The last command above the progress bar is log-output -t ubiquity laptop-detect but this appeared much earlier in the process (the progress bar keeps going and only hangs later).\nBy searching for symptoms I eventually found out what my specific problem was (see below), but I still don't know how to find an error message while I'm busy installing on a fresh VirtualBox.\nAre there logs I can access, a command-line mode I can switch to, or some other means of finding a report of what is going wrong, assuming there is one?\n(If it is not possible to do so, please provide some kind of authoritative reference confirming this.)\n\nA: I tried the following without resolving the problem, but they may be useful to know:\n\n\n*\n\n*increasing client HDD space to 9GB (it actually won't install without this)\n\n*increasing client memory to 1GB (apparently there may be problems with only 512MB)\n\n*disabling client network adapter to stop the installer trying to make network connections\n\n\nIn my case, I needed to change my client storage options, which solved the problem with hanging:\nOption 1: ext3\nUbuntu 11.10 creates an ext4 partition by default. This debian-installer bug gave me a hint to try an ext3 partition instead. When I did this, the installation completed successfully.\nOption 2 (preferred): Enable host I/O cache\nHowever, I think a better solution is to create a new client machine and then tick \"Enable host I/O cache\" on the SATA controller of the client machine (find it under Storage on the client machine settings). [1] [2] When I did this, I could successfully install Ubuntu using the default (ext4) partition options, which I prefer for no other reason than that it is the default.\nOther candidates\nIf this didn't help you try:\n\n\n*\n\n*checking if you need to install third-party software (thanks John)\n\n*running the memory test on both your host and client machines (you'll find the memory test as one of the options in the first menu of the installation CD/DVD) (thanks Barafu)\n\n\nHow to debug? I don't know.\nI posted here on AU, the VirtualBox forums, and solved it by searching for my specific symptoms. I still don't know how to retrieve error messages from the installer itself.\n\nA: In my case it was a trouble with physical memory of host machine. I've run memtest on host machine and it passed OK. Then I have run it in VirtualBox and it ended in errors after an hour. Having replaced the suspicious memory bank, I repeated the test overnight to see no problems. \nBefore replacement, I could not install Mint. \n\nA: My installation required the selection of the third party software to enable the wireless adaptor.

It seems in practice it's actually referred to as the 'mouse button modifier'. \nInstall the 'Configuration Editor' (gconf-editor) from the Ubuntu Software Center. You can use it to change the key.. or manually do it from the terminal with:\ngconftool --set --type string /apps/metacity/general/mouse_button_modifier \"<Super>\"\n\nThe default value is <Alt>. I've changed it above to be the super (Windows) key.

The correct path is /etc/apt/apt.conf\n\nA: Go to /etc/apt. Create the file apt.conf if you don't have it there. Write the following lines there.\nAcquire::http::proxy \"http://username:password@proxyserver:port/\";\nAcquire::https::proxy \"https://username:password@proxyserver:port/\";\nAcquire::socks::proxy \"socks://username:password@proxyserver:port/\";\n\nSave it. You are done.\n\nA: In the dash button, select the \"Network\" option. In the network configuration screen you should select \"network proxy\" > \"manual\", type your proxy data and finally \"Apply to all system\". If authentication is required, the login screen will appear.\nAnother option is to configure directly using the gconftool:\ngconftool-2 -t string -s /system/http_proxy/host \"YOUR_PROXY_ADDRESS\"\ngconftool-2 -t int -s /system/http_proxy/port PROXY_PORT\ngconftool-2 -t bool -s /system/http_proxy/use_http_proxy true\n\nI hope this help.\n\nA: Well this worked - however it didn't work to just use Acquire::http::proxy \"http://host:port/\" - I had to use Acquire::http::proxy \"http://user:pass@host:port/\" even though I haven't a password on the proxy (I just did use \"user and pass\" to keep the syntax).\n\nA: I had set proxy details in System → Network and applied system wide but was unable to use the Software Center (Firefox was fine). \nI do need to enter a username and password but my actual username and password entered in that string wouldn't work, but when I just put in the actual words \"user:pass\" the Software Center started working!\n\nA: You need to confirm that your username or password must not contain : or @ in it.\nI had a similar problem and it was solved when I changed my password.\n\nA: I've applied all of the above and none of it works for me AT FIRST, even though wget, apt-get, curl, web browsing, thunderbird and suchlike have all worked perfectly for years. Only software centre didn't work. \nHowever, I left it with a grey screen for 2-4 minutes after applying the fix to /etc/apt/apt.conf:\n      Acquire::http::proxy \"http://user:pass@host:port/\"\n\nand then magically it began to work.\n\nA: I have made a python script to set the proxy settings in Ubuntu\nAssume the following setting, you need to replace at relevant places\n\n\n*\n\n*proxy_address 172.16.26.214\n\n*proxy_port 3128\n\n*proxy_username king\n\n*proxy_password queen\n\n\nI have made a video which takes you through all the steps:\nYoutube - Setting Simple and Authenticated Proxy Settings in Ubuntu 12 13 14 and above 100% Working. \nSteps are Detailed here:\n\n\n*\n\n*First click on Dash\n\n*In Search Box Enter \"Proxy\" (Without Quotes)\n\n*Click on \"Network\" under Applications\n\n*Select \"Network Proxy\"\n\n*Select Manual\n\n*Enter the proxy address and proxy port\n\n*Apply.

It can generate a list of files or directorise in or below a specified directory, and it can also execute a command on each item in that list of results. (Note: if you're using a multi-user system, make sure to read the security considerations section of the Findutils documentation for the find command.)\nThe options to the find command that we need are -type d which tells find to return the names of every directory within the specified path, and -exec command '{}' \\; which tells find to run command on the results. For example:\nfind /media/music/flac -type d -exec ~/tag-flac-with-rg.sh '{}' \\;\n\nThis tells find to return every directory in or below the path /media/music/flac and then run the tag-flac-with-rg.sh script on each directory found. The '{}' is replaced by each directory name found, and gets passed as an argument to the tag-flac-with-rg.sh script. The \\; marks the end of the arguments list to the tag-flac-with-rg.sh script.\nmay be this will help u\n\nA: Just for curiosity I tried to take your example and make it work. There is no reason to use this technique instead of the find command.\n\nNote: Thanks to enzotib for pointing it out, this does not work for directory names containing spaces or any other characters that\n  make awk think the name consists of several fields.\n\nTo make your example work a few tweaks should be made. But at first see the code:\nls -l | grep ^d | awk '{print $NF}' | xargs -n 1 bash -c 'cd $0; ls'\n\nThe first two commands make sure that only directories are listed. Since ls long listing contains a d as the first character for directories, the grep command selects only these lines.\nWith awk only the last column is displayed in every line. NF is a built-in variable in awk holding the maximum number of fields. Thus printing $NF displays the last field.\nFinally xargs needed to be tamed to run the specified script with only one parameters at a time. (I know this kind-of defeats its purpose.) Otherwise the script could not be run for every directory without a for loop.\nAnd to work around the built-in cd barrier, we call bash with -c.

I have a US-Style laptop, which is fine, but I also have a UK-style Ergonomic USB keyboard. \nAs such I usually have the US key layout set, but when I settle in at my desk and use the UK USB keyboard I find myself making stupid mistakes on symbols (normally a pretty good touch typist on either ergo or standard kbd).\nCan anyone think of a clean way of setting the keyboard layout based on the inferred layout/USBID of any plugged in Keyboard?\nEven having a custom setting such as adding a specific USB ID to a runtime script that checks if its plugged in or not. Can this be done without the user having to logout/in? I remember doing something similar with xorg.conf, but that required logout.\n\nA: You could try writing a udev rule. Plug in your keyboard and type lsusb and write down your keyboard ID, it should look something like \nBus 001 Device 001: ID 13ab:001a name-of-the-keyboard\n\nIn this case the 13ab is the vendor ID, and the 001a is the product ID. You can disconnect your keyboard now.\nGo to /etc/udev/rules.d/ and create a new file, for example 80-keyboard.rules and write  in (replace the idVendor and idProduct in this example with the id of your keyboard):\nSUBSYSTEM==\"input\", ACTION==\"add\", SUBSYSTEMS==\"usb\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"13ab\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"001a\", RUN+=\"/path/to/connect/script\"\nSUBSYSTEM==\"input\", ACTION==\"remove\", SUBSYSTEMS==\"usb\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"13ab\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"001a\", RUN+=\"/path/to/disconnect/script\"\n\nYou can't just use the setxkbmap from udev because it does not have the neccessary enviroment variables set. This part is borrowed from this aswer.\nConnect script:\n#!/bin/sh\n/path/to/set-keyboard-layout.sh uk\n\nDisconnect script:\n#!/bin/sh\n/path/to/set-keyboard-layout.sh us\n\nset-keyboard-layout.sh\n#!/bin/sh\nsleep 1\nDISPLAY=\":0.0\"\nHOME=/home/your-username\nXAUTHORITY=$HOME/.Xauthority\nexport DISPLAY XAUTHORITY HOME\nsetxkbmap -layout $1\n\nDon't forget to do chmod +x on all three scripts and change the /home/your-username to your home folder path.\nNow run sudo service udev restart and plug in your keyboard and see if the layout changes  on connect/disconnect.\nI've tested this with my usb hdd and it works (except I had block instead of input for subsystem).\n\nA: To supplement the excellent answer of jeremija, if you have multiple layouts set up (e.g. using the KDE configuration) and want to retain the ability to switch manually, use xkblayout-state in conjunction with this script:\n#!/bin/sh\ncase $ACTION in\n        add) id=1;;\n        remove) id=0;;\nesac\nXAUTHORITY=\"/home/<username>/.Xauthority\" DISPLAY=:0 xkblayout-state set $id\n\nThen you also only need one udev rule, which captures all actions:\nSUBSYSTEM==\"input\", SUBSYSTEMS==\"usb\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"<idVendor>\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"<idProduct>\", RUN+=\"</path/to/script>\"\n\nNote that xkblayout-state needs to be in the root-PATH, e.g. /usr/local/bin, since udev rules are run as root. Alternatively you can also specify the full path to its location.\n", "Q: Command  to unmute and maximize volume?

Brings up Package Installer, which ultimately fails trying to get the first file (probably same underlying error?).\nSOLVED: Based on this bug report: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apt/+bug/602945 I added a symbolic link from /media/apt/pool -> /cdrom/pool and now the apt-get install works.\n\nA: I think you should try with newer version of (K)ubuntu, because there is very high chance, that your NIC's driver included in kernel. In fact driver — just kernel module.\nBy the way, you should verify, that you installed 10.04.3 (not just 10.04), because it includes many updates, including new kernel modules.\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu in Android Tablet? Can I remove the Android OS from the EEE Pad transformer? I bought Android Asus EEE Pad Transformer and I don't like this OS. It's all hidden how Linux should be.\nHow do you remove the existing OS, there is no jack such as USB nor it has any boot menu nor it has BIOS it just after power on. It shows Android.\nAny idea how to install in this now? (e.g: how to root your Asus EEE pad transformer)\n\nA: Please look at How to install Ubuntu on an Asus EEEPad Transformer.\nHowever, this is not really a question for Ask Ubuntu. The method of doing this is experimental, fast changing and is not suitable for Ask Ubuntu. The wiki article was only created this month.\nAlso see Ubuntu on the Transformer (eMMC install) and Ubuntu on the transformer.\n", "Q: Movie from tiff pictures How can I create a movie from multiple tiff files in ubuntu?\nI have multiple tiff picture files and I want to merge them into a movie. Each picture should show for about 0.1s. The final movie format is not relevant and no fancy transitions are reauired.\n\nA: You should be able to accomplish this with ffmpeg from the CLI. There is some information on this page which I have pasted in below \nFirst, rename your pictures to follow a numerical sequence. For example, img1.jpg, img2.jpg, img3.jpg,... Then you may run:\nffmpeg -f image2 -i img%d.jpg /tmp/a.mpg\n\nNotice that ‘%d’ is replaced by the image number.\n‘img%03d.jpg’ means the sequence ‘img001.jpg’, ‘img002.jpg’, etc...\n\nIf you have large number of pictures to rename, you can use the following command to ease the burden. The command, using the bourne shell syntax, symbolically links all files in the current directory that match *jpg to the ‘/tmp’ directory in the sequence of ‘img001.jpg’, ‘img002.jpg’ and so on.\nx=1; for i in *jpg; do counter=$(printf %03d $x); ln -s \"$i\" /tmp/img\"$counter\".jpg; x=$(($x+1)); done\n\nIf you want to sequence them by oldest modified first, substitute $(ls -r -t *jpg) in place of *jpg.\nThen run:\nffmpeg -f image2 -i /tmp/img%03d.jpg /tmp/a.mpg\n\nThe same logic is used for any image format that ffmpeg reads.\n", "Q: Is there any way to stream ubuntu one cloud music to xbox 360? I want to listen to the music I uploaded to my ubuntu one music account on my xbox 360. The windows streaming is ok, but it doesn't always work. \n\nA: At this time, there is no native support for streaming. You may be able to find some sort of homebrew app or API that can help you stream. A temporary solution may be to just burn the music to a CD-R and put it in you Xbox. This will launch a process that allows you to save the music onto the HDD. The benefit to this is the ability to listen to music whilst playing a game, which is currently impossible to do with streaming alone (on the Xbox, anyway).\n", "Q: System resets when selecting \"Install alongside Windows Vista\" I have a pretty weird problem with Ubuntu 11.10. I am using a Live CD of it to install it alongside Vista, but when I click on \"Install alongside Windows Vista\", it just resets. I've tried installing Ubuntu 11.10 before, but it gave me a black screen after booting my laptop up and choosing Ubuntu from the GRUB menu, so I deleted it's partition and now I'm trying to install it again. What should I do?\n\nA: I would try burning the Live CD again.

If you're in a different directory, say ~ where the class file is located at ~/bar/Foo.class, you need to set the classpath before running java:\nCLASSPATH=~/bar java Foo\n\nIf you're using packages, e.g.:\npackage bar;\nclass Foo {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(\"Hello world\");\n    }\n}\n\nthen you need to save it to path/bar/Foo.java and compile path/bar/Foo.class with javac path/bar/Foo.java and run from path/:\njava bar.Foo\n\n", "Q: How do I convert wma files to ogg? I have installed \"Sound Converter\" but I keep getting an error when I try to use it.  It first tells me that I need a plugin that is not installed (so I have it search) then it reports \"Failed to download repository information\".  I am able to install other software in the software center so what is wrong?\n\nA: Converting WMA to OGG in VLC\n\n\n*\n\n*Open VLC Media Player; if you do not have VLC on your computer already, you can install it by opening a terminal window and typing \"sudo apt-get install vlc.\"\n\n*Go to \"Media\" and \"Convert/Save.\" You can also access the window by pressing \"Ctrl\" and \"R\" on your computer.\n\n*Click \"Add\" from under \"File Selection\" and select the WMA file that you want to convert.\n\n*Click the \"Convert/Save\" button.\n\n*Type the file name for the new OGG file in the \"Destination File:\" box, including the extension; for instance, \"my_wma_filename.ogg.\"\n\n*Select the profile \"Audio - Vorbis (OGG)\" from under Settings.\n\n*Click \"Start.\" Do not close VLC until the conversion is complete. It should be saved in your /home/username directory.\n\n\nConverting WMA to OGG Using Dir2OGG\n\n\n*\n\n*Install dir2ogg by typing \"sudo apt-get install dir2ogg\" in a new terminal window.\n\n*Type \"dir2ogg my_wma_filename.wma\" in the terminal window once installation is completed. Make sure that your WMA file is in the /home/username directory, and remove any spaces from the file name.\n\n*If converting a directory, use dir2ogg -a /path/to/dir\n\n*Close the terminal window once the conversion is complete. The display will read \"Done encoding file \"/home/username/my_wma_filename.ogg\" along with the file length, elapsed time, rate and average bit rate.

Do I need a specific card or will any graphics card have onboard support?\n\nA: yes you can do this with ubuntu but is best to check hardware compatibility\n\nA: Running here with a new nvidia gtx550. I had an old monitor laying around and tried to plug it... didn't even knew about dual monitors. And now works like a charm. Dual monitor with compiz. This is my setup in the first cube side:\n\nMy old ati radeon had two outputs too, but I was never able to make the two monitors work with extended desktop. The only think that worked was clonning the screen 1 in screen 2. It's also true than the ati was old and the nvidia is new, so might be that. Just check diferent models before you buy anything, there's plenty of results if you put \"dual monitor ubuntu whatever_model_gpu\" in google.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Archive Mounter With Natilus I have one problem.

It's like when gnome-settings-daemon is not running if you know what I mean (yes I checked it was running). The picture posted in the question before mentioned (although showing a different problem) explains it all. \nAny possible fix?\n\nA: I haven't used Nomachine NX in quite a few years, but I can confirm that X2go works, if you're willing to give another NX-solution a try. X2go is quite nice, with PulseAudio support and everything. \nI do remember a similar issue a few years ago with FreeNX. Back then, if I remember correctly, it had something to do with libxklavier, if you want a starting point. \n", "Q: getting compiz to work with Ubuntu 11.10 and fglrx I am trying to get Compiz to work in Ubuntu 11.10. I have FGLRX installed and the \"Additional Drivers\" screen seems to report that FGLRX is active and currently in use. I have tried using CCSM to enable the desktop cube. It seems to be enabled, yet I cannot get the affect, or any of the other compiz affects (e.g. wobbly windows) to actually happen.

All is working now.\n\nA: ccsm doesn't enables compiz, it just configures it. So you have the cube set in compiz but your desktop is running metacity.\nTry to run in a terminal (maybe you'll need to unstall mesa-utils to run this):\nglxinfo | grep direct\n\nThe output should tell you \"direct rendering: Yes (if the drivers are properly installed) Then try:\ncompiz --replace\n\nThat should activate compiz. If not, it's a drivers problem.\nIf it works, maybe you have to do it every time you log in. To make it easier you can install fusion-icon:\nsudo apt-get install fusion-icon\n\nIt allows you to switch between compiz and metacity with a click. Later if you want to run compiz automatically on login (if you don't find any problem) you can add the compiz --replace command to the startup applications.\nWhish it helps.\n\nA: I fixed this by reinstalling the open source ati driver and completely purging fglrx.\n\nA: Check this link Ubuntu Oneiric Installation Guide ATI drivers work for me, unfortunately the official ATI drivers not work with the gnome-shell :( but work fine in Unity and classic\n\nA: This has solution:\nPress CTRL+ALT+F1 and enter in the terminal:\nsudo apt-get remove - purge fglrx*\nsudo amd-driver-installer-catalyst-13.1-linux-x86.x86_64.run\n\nThis last line in my case, generates the package and then install the driver.\n", "Q: Is there a way to enable the keyboard numblock?

With a gnome panel I used to be able to right click and get the options right there. In Unity I can't see a way to access any options. Where are they?\nI've looked at What Application Indicators are available? and How to hide items in Unity's top panel? -- is there really no centralized management for this menu?\n\nA: No. There are no central options for the panel. You can often install and uninstall indicators through the software center, although some of them I think need to be changed through the command line.\nBut in general, there are very few options for the panel. There's no default way to rearrange the indicators, provide auto-hiding, easily hide or show indicators, hide or show the global menu, change the location or size of the panel, change it's color, etc. These sorts of options have all been removed in Unity.\nThere's one or two settings you can change in CCSM. Changing the transparency comes to mind.

I would like list view and hidden files.\n\nIf you just need to get to the settings for Nautilus, just go to Edit->Preferences. There you can select to show list view and hidden files.\n\nA: Perhaps the OP was unaware of the new detached menu bar in Unity. Threw me for a loop at first. If so, be aware that it is at the top of the screen, regardless of the size or placement of your file browser window, and that by default it auto-hides. Move your mouse to the top of the screen and it should appear.\n\nA: The lenses are not supposed to be a replacement for Nautilus. You use it to quickly find files you've used in the past. There's been discussion about making it search all files, but I don't think any decisions have been made about that. I personally feel that only files you've used should be displayed, since the only way the system can understand your interests, is by analyzing your actions. \n\nA: Or, You can easily use the \"List View\" in Unity by pressing CTRL + 2.\n", "Q: How do I enable NTFS write support?

That said, ntfs-config is only needed to configure ntfs in fstab wich I had problems with in the last upgrade. So install the first one and edit the fstab manually. A normal line to mount a ntfs disk in the boot will look like this in /etc/fstab:\n/dev/sda4 /media/windows ntfs-3g defaults,locale=ca_ES.UTF-8 0 0\n\nWhere \n\n\n*\n\n*sda4 is the ntfs partition (the number might change in your case), \n\n*/media/windows is the directory where you want it mounted (must be created manually) and \n\n*locale  must be your language (mine is catalan) because the system uses for reading the names of files and folders. \n\n\nIn your case i asume must be en_GB or en_US if you're english.\nIf you skip the fstab edit you can still  use the ntfs partition as a user, just mount it by clicking in nautilus. But it will be mounted as user. With the fstab it's mounted by the system itself (with read/write to all so you can store your data, of course).\nWish it helps, good luck!\n\nA: There is simple way to enable NTFS-write by default:\n- first install the ntfs configs using terminal command:\nsudo apt-get install ntfs-config\n\nif apt not work try using aptitude\n\n\n*\n\n*then you just do this command to enable ntfs-config by default\nsudo mkdir -p /etc/hal/fdi/policy\n\nand last, try to mount the ntfs drive and paste some file to it from the ubuntu and the write function is usable now.\n\nA: It is easier just to install ntfs-3g (it will remove ntfs-progs) and you will r/w support for ntfs drives. I had the same issue and it worked for me.\n", "Q: How to enable Arabic support in GNOME terminal? I'm trying to write Arabic in the terminal app but it does not recognize right-to-left text and does not bind the Arabic letters together as it should.\nI tried this solution https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/vte/+bug/263822 but it did not work.\nAre there any plans to implement Arabic support in the gnome terminal? KDE Konsole terminal works without any problems.\nThis is what is needed in a terminal to support Arabic:\n\n*\n\n*Arabic letters need to be displayed correctly with a font that supports Arabic, from right to left, with the letters taking the correct forms (letters in the same word are joined together, usually, we want to see على not ع ل ى)\n\n*It needs to support diacritic marks (known as shakl شَكْل in Arabic)\n\n*There needs to be a way to enable right-to-left mode for the entire line. For example, the word على followed by a . should be displayed with the dot on the left, not the right.\n\n*There needs to be a way to align the text of the line to the right, not to the left.\n\nHere is an example of four properties being met in Gedit:\n\nHowever, GNOME Terminal in Ubuntu 21.10 only supports properties 1 and 2 of the previous list of requirements:\n\n(The letters are displayed correctly right to left, however, the dot is on right when it should be on the left, and the text is left-aligned rather than right-aligned.)\n\nA: try this: sudo apt-get install libfribidi0 libfribidi-dev, install THIS package, then vim /usr/share/applications/gnome-terminal.desktop and add this code to the document: \nTerminal=true\nExec=/usr/bin/bicon.bin\n\n\nA: GNOME Terminal 3.34 supports right to left scripts such as Arabic.\nThe work actually went into VTE version 0.58, so any other terminal emulator using VTE (e.g. Tilix, Terminator, Xfce Terminal, Guake...) will automatically receive it.\nIt's going to debut in Ubuntu 19.10 Eoan Ermine.\n\n\nA: Update\nAs egmont mentioned in his comment below, a BiDi implementation is coming to vte terminal emulator. Check his answer which is the last updated concerning this topic.\nHere is a reference if looking for details: https://terminal-wg.pages.freedesktop.org/bidi/\n\nOriginal answer\nNo, there is no plans to implement RTL support in gnome-terminal or any terminal depends on vte as the case of synaptic installation terminal.\n\n\n*\n\n*You may proxy your command through fribidi command to make bidi & basic shaping of Arabic.\n\n*You may also use konsole (KDE) or mlterm that had implemented a partial support for Unicode bidi and shaping.\n\n\nCurrently, there is no correct way to implement those Unicode algorithms for the consoles. (Those implementions in konsole & mlterm are kind of workaround)\nHere is a portion from a Behdad Esfahbod's post, he is the main developer of  HarfBuzz (hb for short, an OpenType text shaping engine)\n\nTerminal emulators with support for complex text are very weird\n  hybrids. On the one hand terminal emulators have to lay text out in a\n  predefined grid in a predefined way, which is in conflict with many\n  aspects and requirements of complex text, on the other hand users\n  demand support for complex text in their terminals. It gets uglier\n  when you think about bidirectional text, say, inside a console text\n  editor. Nonetheless, it is fair to say that such hybrids do not put\n  any new demands on the shaping engine. gnome-terminal currently has no\n  support for complex text other than combining marks. Konsole has\n  bidirectional text support. Apple's Terminal App has at least bidi\n  support as well as Arabic shaping support, not sure about other\n  complex text. Update (Jan 18, 2010): The terminal mode (term and\n  ansi-term) in recent versions of Emacs can render complex text,\n  including Indic.\n\nSource: State of Text Rendering\nHere is the corresponding bug report in Launchpad bug #263822: RTL (right to left) support in terminal (BiDi).\n\nA: There are three more solutions:\n\n*\n\n*use tabby (an electron app - web based):\n\n\n\n\n*use Konsole (the default emulator for KDE distros):\nsudo apt install konsole\n\n\n\n*use butterfly (a pure web based terminal):\n\n\nthank you @singrium\n\nA: For Ubuntu 64 bit, you would need to download BiCon, the Bidirectional Console. To add the PPA and install:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:behnam/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install bicon\n\nI guess you were having a dependency problem.\nYou would need also to install the apps stated above with this command:\nsudo apt-get install libfribidi0 libfribidi-dev\n\nHope that this could help\n\nA: Use Mlterm, It's has great support for Arabic and other non-latin characters. You can download it from Ubuntu repositories:\nsudo apt install mlterm\n\n\n", "Q: Can you back up and restore your Ubuntu machine with Ubuntu for Windows? I found this on an old posting from 2006 about how to back up and restore your Ubuntu machine.\nhttp://www.arsgeek.com/2006/10/18/how-to-back-up-and-restore-your-ubuntu-machine/\nFirst they suggest changing to your external hard drive with:\ncd/media/Free* (Freeagent is my external hard drive.)\nThen mkdir ubuntu_backup or some such name.\nChange to that directory and then:\nsudo tar cvpzf ubuntusettings.backup.tgz2 --exclude=\"/tmp/\" / (The ubuntusettings is my backup's name.)\nThe switches are:\n\n\n*\n\n*c = create\n\n*v = verbose\n\n*p = preserve permission\n\n*z = bzip2\n\n*f = file\n\n*--exclude is just the folders you want to exclude.\n\n\nI tried it out, and it does begin to back-up; but what I noticed is that it was backing up my entire laptop...that includes Windows. I did not want that but rather I am wondering if anyone knows how to modify this so that it only backs up the Ubuntu section of my laptop? I have Ubuntu for Windows installed on a Vista machine.\n\nA: Do you mean you have a wubi install? If so,  add exclude=\"/host\".\n\nA: To preform a complete wubi system backup copy your root.disk file from your ubuntu folder within windows to another location, if something bad happens you just need to replace the current file with the one you backed up and your system will be back to what it was at the time of the backup.\nYou can even mount the root.disk file within Ubuntu if you want to partially restore some files only:\nsudo mkdir /mnt/rootdisk\nsudo mount -o loop <path to share in windows>/root.disk /mnt/rootdisk\n\nWill mount your root.disk to a the path /mnt/rootdisk.\n", "Q: Why doesn't Ubuntu One Music app (Android) recognise mp3 files uploaded via the U1 REST API? I've uploaded a few music files (.mp3 and .ogg, no DRM) via the Ubuntu One REST API. (I'm writing a python library that uses it.) The Ubuntu One Music app on my Android phone doesn't pick up on these files. (They do not appear in the library after requesting a Refresh, not even under \"Unknown artist\".) Similar files uploaded via the official client, on the other hand, get picked up immediately.\nIs this somehow expected behaviour, and I'm just missing the explanation? And how can I work around it?\n\nA: It is most certainly not expected behaviour. We're looking in to why it might happen. Can you confirm a few things for me?\n\n\n*\n\n*the files, when uploaded from the REST API and then downloaded from the website, have not been corrupted or altered?\n\n*the filesizes of the REST-API-uploaded files are as you'd expect on the website?\n\n*is the mimetype of the REST-API-uploaded MP3s audio/mpeg ?\n\n\nThat last one is the important one. Use \"More\" to show details of a file on the website to see its mimetype. Uploads through Ubuntu One guess the mimetype for you if you don't specify it. The REST API trusts you more and uses what you specify (and chooses a neutral type if you do not; specifically, it won't guess audio/mpeg for mp3s).\n\n", "Q: How do I install ATI Radeon HD 3650 driver on my pc?

In most cases this means the resolution is too high, though in some cases it's the refresh rate.  You should use the shell (Press CTRL+ALT+F1 to get there) to reset the resolution to 1024x768 60Hz.  From there you can try increasing your resolution again until it stops working and then go back one. If 1024x768 still doesn't do it, you can try 800x600 60hz, but that's unlikely to be necessary.\nUnfortunately I can't give ubuntu related details, but I found a page which should help you.

I have just purchased a Acer 3830TG, the timeline X series.\nTo my surprise I found out that there is no first-party support for nvidia optimus for linux. Bumblebee works great, but the battery life from the graphics card always running is not so great. \nI don't use linux for games so i don't really need the graphics card on, I have Windows for that.\nIn my bios, I have the ability to change my graphics mode from switchable to integrated. \nIf I do this, reinstall ubuntu, what will happen? Will my nvidia card just turn off? Will everything work properly, as if i'm not running an optimus laptop? Is this recommended as opposed to dealing with bumblebee?\nWhat is the best thing I could do?\n\nA: If you're looking for saving power, that's the recommended method: changing the BIOS setting to Integrated. It'll indeed turn the nVidia card off and rely on the Intel iGPU only. There is no need for reinstalling everything.\nIt'll also mean that you'll have to turn it on each time you want into Windows to play games. Not ideal.\nBumblebee supports power management scripts (although the use of it is considered experimental!). Do not use it unless you know what you're doing. https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/Bumblebee/wiki/ACPI-Removed In the future (1-3 months?), the Bumblebee team has probably a stable kernel module which should allow to toggle the nVidia card.\n\nA: You are a lucky one, not all users have the luxury of being able to switch their cards on the BIOS.\nIf you dont play games use the integrated Intel card, I believe nothing wrong will happen and you will be able to boot in to Ubuntu without problems, if something wrong happens just revert the setting back and nothing will be lost.\nThe most logical reason for that is battery ofc, disabling the nVidia card will save you around 15W power increasing the amount of time you need between charging your laptop. Also reduces significantly the amount of heat your laptop generates, that is a big plus in my opinion.\nIf after disabling the nVidia you cant boot in to Ubuntu drop a comment or ask a new question asking how to remove Bumblebee and the nVidia drivers from your system.\n", "Q: Wireless not working on Lenovo B-575 Help, because without internet, Ubuntu is useless.

For those who are still using blender on Ubuntu 11.04, the version in the Software Center is out of date (2.49). Yes, it does make a difference, there was a major user interface change with the release of Blender 2.5. For those using Blender in Ubuntu 11.10, the version in the Software Center is also out of date(2.57). The current release of Blender is 2.60. Who can I contact go get the versions in the two Software Centers updated? Any help is much appreciated.\n\nA: Normally Ubuntu releases the packages with a distro release and the only updates for them are bugs or security updates, if you want to use later versions of the software you probably need to add a PPA to your list.\nThis PPA supplies the latest 2.60 version for 11.10, to add it to your system use these commands\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:user/irie-blender\n\nAfter that use these commands to update your package list and possible packages\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nPackage blender will install 2.60 in Ubuntu 11.04, 2.49.2 in Ubuntu 11.04. For 2.50 in 11.04 install package blender2.5.\n\nA: Probably not the answer you were hoping for, but I've started handling this manually myself.\nI've started downloading the Linux tar.gz files from the Blender website and extracting them to /opt, and updating a symbolic link to the latest folder.\nThis way, all I have to do is point a launcher to /opt/blender/blender to launch the latest version.\n", "Q: How to share same Thunderbird profile between two users? I have been using Thunderbird e-mail client with my default account in my desktop Ubuntu (Lucid Lynx).\nNow, I have created another user. When I start Thunderbird when logged in this new account, I would like it to use exactly the same profile than the default user.\nLet's suppose the user/group names are default and newbie (/home/default and /home/newbie being their home folders).\nHow can I do this?\nThanks!\n\nA: You might consider simply running Thunderbird as the same user, regardless of which of the two users is the one who is logged in. This would be suitable if the two users have absolute trust for each other (or, more narrowly, if the user whose Thunderbird profile it is has absolute trust for the other user, since it's the user whose Thunderbird profile it is who would have to give the other user his or her password).\nIf you want to do it that way, then one user can run Thunderbird as the other user with the command:\ngksu -u other-username thunderbird\nWhere other-username is replaced by the other user's username.\nThis command can be run in the Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T), or from the Run Application menu (Alt+F2), or a launcher icon or menu item can be created to run this command.\nSo default could run Thunderbird as newbie with:\ngksu -u newbie thunderbird\nAnd newbie could run Thunderbird as default with:\ngksu -u default thunderbird\nThe password for the user whose username is other-username is required, to run Thunderbird like that.\nAlternatively, if you want to actually set things up so that both users are using the same Thunderbird profile, then you can make one user's ~/.mozilla/thunderbird folder (where ~ represents the user's home directory) a symbolic link to the other user's corresponding folder. In order for this to work, that profile must be accessible by both users, so a group should be created for this, both users added to the group, and full read and write permissions given to the folder for all users in the group.\n\nFor example, if the user newbie wants to make make his Thunderbird profile the same as the user default's profile, and default is an administrator, and default is OK with this, then with Thunderbird not running, default could run:\nsudo addgroup default-thunderbird\nsudo usermod -a -G default-thunderbird default\nsudo usermod -a -G default-thunderbird newbie\ncp -R ~/.mozilla/thunderbird ~/.mozilla/thunderbird.backup\nchgrp -R default-thunderbird ~/.mozilla/thunderbird\nchmod g+rw ~/.mozilla/thunderbird\nfind ~/.mozilla/thunderbird -type d -exec chmod g+x \\{\\} \\;\nAnd then, with Thunderbird not running, newbie could run:\nmv ~/.mozilla/thunderbird ~/.mozilla/thunderbird.old\nln -s ~default/.mozilla/thunderbird ~/.mozilla/thunderbird\nPlease make sure to back up any important Thunderbird data before doing this, and be very careful, because:\n(1) I have not tested this to see if it works, or how well!\n(2) This is quite a bizarre way to set things up, which the Thunderbird developers probably did not have in mind. Thus, this might trigger bugs and/or strange Thunderbird behavior.\nFinally, have you considered, instead of any of the complex solutions detailed above, simply having both users be separately set up to use the same (or some of the same) email accounts in their respective separate Thunderbird configurations?\n\nIf these are IMAP accounts (rather than POP), then emails are stored on the server all the time anyway, and then there is really no reason to try to have two user accounts using Thunderbird with the same profile.\n", "Q: Play songs in the file system queue only once? In the \"file system queue\", once all the songs are done, playback returns to the \"play queue\", that is exactly what I want. The problem is, when I add a new song to the \"file system queue\", once that song is finished, it proceeds to play another song from the \"file system queue\" and then proceed to the \"play queue\". So far, the only pattern I've found is that the next song played song is always the next one alphabetically.\nIs there anyway to automatically remove songs from the \"file system queue\" once they are done playing, or for each queued song to play only once? \nEdit: The pattern doesn't some to be alphabetically, but rather random.\n\nA: Unfortunately, there is no way to do this (currently). Your best bet is to report a bug on Banshee's bug tracker, requesting that the behavior be changed.\nThe only other option is to select \"Stop when finished\" from the Playback menu and then manually chose another track after the song finishes.\n", "Q: Nautilus does not connect via FTP after upgrade to 11.10 Since I have upgraded to Oneiric, Nautilus is not able anymore to connect to FTP servers.

I could fix this issue by reinstalling the gvfs-backends package. I had some serious problems doing so, because apt-get was telling me, that my gvfs packages are broken not let me reinstall it (see here: How to fix broken GVFS package?). So I purged it:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge gvfs-backends\n\nDownloaded the package here http://packages.ubuntu.com/de/oneiric/amd64/gvfs-backends/download and installed it performing following command:\nsudo dpkg -i gvfs-backends_1.10.0-0ubuntu1_amd64.deb\n\nAfter rebooting my machine I got it working again in spite of the fact that package manager is still telling me, that the package is broken.\n", "Q: Force wget to use actual filename When using wget in a script to download some files from Google Docs, the name of the file is not preserved.

The file, to the best of my knowledge, does not exist ever on the server in the els form, but is generated at runtime when you ask for it. Thus, there isn't anything for wget to get.\nIn order to download the file, you would need to use the google API http://code.google.com/apis/documents/docs/3.0/developers_guide_protocol.html#DownloadingDocs/.\n", "Q: How can I save settings on a Live USB? So I have an Ubuntu 11.10 Live USB disk. I've noticed that my settings never get saved. Every time I reboot while in my Live USB and then boot back into it, all my settings and [un]installed programs revert back to default after the reboot. How can I set some sort of persistence on settings on a Live USB?\n\nA: I actually just now helped one friend over skype to do that with Lubuntu and ive put for him 2y ago one persistant xUbuntu Live USB.\nU can make it to be as Live so u can still use it as installation but with persistance witch means it saves files to persistance file witch cant be seenable from windows. Also Live means it will not change thouse 700mb of usb stick even after updates to remain original and updates will be using persitance file part.\nOR u can install ubuntu on USB but then in partitioning step use manual and use all usb as system / partition and dont put swap couse swap will be automatically put in automatic installation but u dont need usb to be all the time using swap and u dont need hibernation on usb right?\nSo 1st step\nFrom computer .. from what else.. go to http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/download and download an actual Ubuntu image and i recommend better using 10.04 LTS couse thats lighter and faster and more understandable or even better i recommend 10.04.03 netbook remix couse thats even more faster.\n==PRepearing Live USB with installation possibility and persistance file==\nIf ull use Ubuntu to make USB then System > Administration > Startup Disk Creator\nBrowse to desired downloaded Ubuntu file and if want u can erase USB from Startup Disk Creator and choose Persitance option and slide to use as much as want.\nPress make and in process enter 3 times password.\n==Installing on USB==\nIf u dont need option to be able to later infect some other computers with ubuntu then u can dont need live usb but u can just install Ubuntu on usb. To do that u can use LiveCD/USB and install on USB and dont put swap partition on it. Since choosing automatically to install Ubuntu on chosen partition will make swap file u need to choose Manual installation and format whole USB to be just partition / and done. It will warn that u didnt put swap but since its waste of space and might not anyways be able to work as much as fast possible if swap is beeing used and that means written to USB swap partition as virtual memory witch slows work more then we dont need it.\ntheres also methods in https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent\n\nA: Try installing ubuntu with unetbootin, which allows you to set aside space on your usb drive for persistance.\n \nJust make sure to enter a value into the \"Space used to preserve files across reboots\" field.  \nFurther instructions can be found here, but I doubt you will need them.\n", "Q: Wireless doesn't work on a  Lenovo V570 I've had Ubuntu installed on my HD for about 3 months but ever since I ran into this wireless issue I kinda lost my lust of Ubuntu.

When I lock the screen, Gmail chat appears at the bottom of the screen just like when it's unlocked. Is it a bug?\n\nA: Definitely sounds like a bug.\nI would suggest using Empathy for chatting instead of the web interface, because I have no experienced this problem with Empathy (or with the web interface for that matter). You can report the bug against the gnome-screensaver package.\nYou can also mark it as affecting chromium-browser (optionally), because imo Chromium should not display anything when the screensaver or screenlock is active.\n\nA: Yes. When the screen is locked, users will reasonably assume that potentially private information that might be displayed on the screen will not be displayed until and unless the screen is unlocked. Assuming that this is from the Gmail web-based interface, this is a bug in your web browser (which interprets the Javascript in the Gmail and creates the chat \"windowlets\" as interface elements). On the other hand, if you are seeing chat windows or tabs from a standalone instant messaging applications like Empathy or Pidgin, then it is a bug in that application.\nI recommend reporting this bug.\n", "Q: Accidentally created a file called \"--help\".

Both systems were disconnected from the Ubuntu One service for some days and changes were made to the same file on both systems. On one system the changes were insignificant, something like the file being touched or something similar. On the other system there were significant changes. Both of the systems reconnected to the file synchronization service at about the same time and Ubuntu One overwrote the file with all of the changes. There were no conflict files in this case. I would have hoped for and expected a conflict. \nIt seems like there should be something I can do about this, that the service wouldn't just overwrite files without some way of restoring old versions. Revision history is supposed to be a strength of couchdb. Can I use this strength to restore my files?\n\nA: Versioning is a strength of CouchDB, but CouchDB is not used by file synchronization. \nHowever, conflicts are handled gracefully, albeit not entirely user friendly yet. In the same directory as your original file, you will find files called filename.u1conflict*, like mydocument.odf.u1conflict and mydocument.odf.u1conflict2, etc. Those are the original conflict files, so you can just rename and use them as before. \n", "Q: Trouble installing Rabbit VCS for nautilus I am using Ubuntu 11.10 and following instructions mentioned here to install Rabbit VCS.\nI added the PPA properly, did a sudo apt-get update and ran \nsudo apt-get install rabbitvcs-core rabbitvcs-nautilus rabbitvcs-thunar rabbitvcs-gedit rabbitvcs-cli\nThere were dependency issues and I googled a bit and found out that I need to install RabbitVCS only for nautilus as that is the default file manager for Ubuntu. \nSo I ran the install commands separately for rabbitvcs-core, rabbitvcs-gedit and rabbitvcs-cli. \nNow my understanding is that those are installed properly.\nHowever when I run the install command for rabbitvcs-nautilus, I still get a dependency issue.\nranhiru@ranhiru-HP-HDX16-NoteBook-PC:~$ sudo apt-get install rabbitvcs-nautilus\nReading package lists...

Whenever Thunderbird downloads a mail (which hasn't been downloaded by Outlook), Outlook won't download that mail. The mail hasn't been deleted from the server, because I can still see it using the GMail browser app, but it seems like it's marked as \"downloaded\" and therefore Outlook doesn't want to grab it. Is there a setting to disable this functionality in Thunderbird, or is this something I need to enable in Outlook?\n\nA: You need to use IMAP to avoid this problem, because with POP3, it marks the message as \"read\" and essentially will not pass it on to other clients.\n", "Q: How can I get window thumbnails when hovering over unity bar application icons? I am pretty sure that after installing 11.10 when an application had two or more windows open and I hovered over a unity bar icon with little white arrows (one for each window), I was getting a window thumbnail for each window of that application.\nBut I don't see that any more.\nDoes anyone know how to restore that?\n\nA: *\n\n*Be sure to install both compizconfig-settings-manager (CompizConfig\nSettings Manager or CCSM) and compiz-plugins-extra. You can do this\nfrom Ubuntu Software Centre.\n\n*Open CCSM > Extras > Enable Window Previews (turn this on) > Taskbar\nShows Only Windows Of Current Viewport (uncheck).\n\n\n\nThis will do as you wish.\n\nA: You probably activated scale mode for the open windows by clicking the icon (with multiple windows open), since the window previews are disabled by default (due to a not-so-hot implementation of the feature).\nIn fact, that plugin does not work so well with Unity, so you would be better off using a dock.\nFrom your comments, it seems like you did something to mess with the settings that has disabled the scale mode. If you don't mind having to add your favourites to the launcher again, you can run:\nunity --reset\nAlso, by the way, installing a dock is simple. Open the Software Center and search for \"dock\", and then choose one you like. The are some good ones such as Avant Window Navigator, Cairo Dock, and Docky. All three support showing the window previews, but not for multiple windows.\nFor that, you would need to install DockBarX, and use it in a standalone way.\n sudo add-apt-repository ppa:dockbar-main/ppa\n sudo apt-get update\n sudo apt-get install dockbarx\n sudo apt-get install dockbarx-themes-extra\n\nThen run dockbarx. You can modify the options show that it activates scale mode when there are multiple windows open and you click on it.\n\nA: If you have an app with more than one open window, there are a few ways to display previews. If you have one of that apps windows focused, then you can click the launcher entry once to get a big overview with previews. To switch between windows of a single app, with previews, you can press Alt+BAT (Button Above Tab). \nThere is no preview on hover by default.\n", "Q: Using Ubuntu One cloud services on a Nokia E7 is there a http:\\ address for mapping Ubuntu One cloud services on my Nokia E7 by using remote drives, I have done so for mapping 4Shared, and Dropbox can be done via a WebDav application, is there anyway of doing it for free like 4Shared instead of paying a premium for a webdav subscription?\nThankYou\n\nA: Currently there is no API like this for Ubuntu One. There is a REST API, but no WebDav.\nIt has already been requested in a feature request, but currently it isn't in the to-do list. Sorry.\n", "Q: Help, my NVIDIA drivers are completely broken I'm on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and everything was fine up till about two hours ago, since when I've spent all my time trying to make things work again.  I was trying to install the latest drivers from the NVIDIA website, v285.05.09 (since I'm currently using the latest drivers available in Ubuntu, nvidia-current v195.36.24, yet WebGL doesn't work in either Chrome or Firefox, and they always suggest that I try the latest driver versions).\nBut after installing this and rebooting, X starts with an error, prompting me to run in reduced graphics mode and/or restore my graphics settings.

If you're developing an application (as mentioning Visual Studio would imply), you need some library for your language of choice which would allow you to connect to the server. \nWhat is the language you're using?\nFor example, for Python there's pymssql\nThere's also FreeTDS, which, as I understand, is a set of command-line tools and libraries to connect to MSSQL and Sybase servers.\nAt any rate, I think it would be very difficult to install Visual Studio in Ubuntu (well, apart from installing it inside a VirtualBox instance running Windows).\n", "Q: How can I access network from terminal?

Unfortunately this process is not easily reversible and these partitions are not visible to linux as they're not in the MBR partition table.\nIn fact that error is not Wubi, it's Windows preventing you from booting directly from the dynamic partition. It would work if you picked C: but don't do this - running linux on a disk with dynamic partitions can lead to data loss (since they're not visible to Ubuntu).\nHere's a thread where the poster converted from dynamic back to simple: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1868679\n", "Q: headphones and speakers, both working \nPossible Duplicate:\nSound comes out of my speakers even when headphones are plugged in \n\nas I am listening the song from my laptop, installed ubuntu 10.04 recently, and when I plugged in the headphones, the sound is still coming from the laptop speakers, creating noise. Please help me that how can I fix it?? there is no hardware problem coz when I was using windows, my headfones and laptop speakers were working perfectly well, separate from each other.\n\nA: When you say working perfectly, I don't quite understand. Having the audio working from both sounds like it is working perfectly. You can control the volume of either the headphones or speakers separately from the volume control panel.\n\nA: Are your headphones plugged into the right plug? Or are they damaged in any way (plug might be bent, a wire might be loose at the plug, etc). Also, what headphones and sound card do you have?\n", "Q: How to report apt repository working bad?

There is an example about that:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/update-manager/+bug/849814\n", "Q: My terminal prompt PS1 mixed up By the way I'm on a Mac OS X but I'm connected to an Ubuntu Server.\nYesterday I installed a module for node.js(after a hour I deleted it) which asked me to add something to the .bashrc file and now when I log in with my mac terminal over SSH I see this as my connected name:\n[e]0;u@h: wa][033[01;32m]u@h[033[00m]:[033[01;34m]w[033[00m]$\n\nAs I know .bashrc is a file which runs commands when I login, so I thought that this is the problem, so I read a little on the web and some guys recommended to get the original file from:\n/etc/skel/.bashrc\n\nso I copied this file over the running one:\ncp /etc/skel/.bashrc /etc/bash.bashrc\n\nThen I rebooted, and nothing happened. Everything works but my screen name is extremely ugly and I need to use the terminal a lot.\nSo what should I do?\n\nA: The first file you should check is ~/.bashrc. \"~\" means your home directory. So you need to edit your own .bashrc file firstly, not system wide one. If you want to check the system wide one try /etc/bashrc.\nIn this file you will see a PS1 section. This is what manages the prompt view. \nAfter editing PS1 line for your needs just run this command:\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\nYou don't need to reboot the system.\n", "Q: ATI proprietary driver (post release) install fails.

And I don't mean compiling and installing myself the ATI driver from command line, but to make the \"Additional drivers\" application work correctly.\nIs there a bug for this in launchpad?\n\nA: Package with driver version of 11.9 fglrx has been merged or dropped I believe, there is no more the post release package listed for 11.10.

Multitouch doesn't seem to work yet. Suspend works if you follow the SUSPEND_MODULES hacks on the later pages.\n\nThe MacBook Air 4,2 has a wiki page detailing the current status of the hardware. When using the Wiki to determine hardware compatibility you should look to see what version of Ubuntu it's using. In this case, it's fairly up to date, using Oneiric.\nThere are a few worrying issues including the screen but the community support is there. There is a script you run and shazaam, most of everything seems to work.\n\nIn my opinion: there is probably a laptop out there that works better than both of these but given the choice, the MacBook is probably going to involve the fewest major issues after the first week (of you fixing things). If you need USB3 however (and you might want it in the future) that might rule it out.\nThey're both premium hardware with extremely premium price tags so choose wisely.\n\nA: I have used the UX31 for about one month now. With some tinkering (mainly using patched kernels) everything now works very well. The good news is that many (all?) the patches are on their way into the Ubuntu kernel for 12.04.\n\n\n*\n\n*I get between 5 and 7 hours of use from on charge\n\n*The laptop is very quiet and cool. I have hardly heard the fan (even when transcoding video)\n\n*While the viewing angle is limited the 1600x900 screen is stunning.\n\n*The boot time is about 5 sec and resume from stand-by 1-2\n\n*My only gripe - if I have to have one - is the keyboard. It often require a harder touch than I am used to.\n\n\nThere is a very nice wiki for the UX31 here.\n\nA: Here is a good place to look:\n\nhttp://friendly.ubuntu.com/\n\n\nA: I would definitely say MacBook air, not just because I'm an apple hardware fan, but because there is more documentation on it; however, I would consider waiting until the new airs come out in early summer. There is also word that the new macbook pros will have the same case as the airs. \n", "Q: An easy way to add applications to autostart in Unity First I want to tell that I've read this answer. Main menu has gone now... Well perfect would be to have a list of all applications and select among them.\n\nA: I think the idea is that new apps should ask to be added to the list of startup applications if that is deemed useful. Evolution alarm notification, for instance, seems to do that. Alacarte is a desktop-file manager. It isn't really related to the menus at all. If you add an entry to it, it'll appear in Unity dash as well. Anyway, adding startup applications is easier than it was in the old days: \n\n\n\nA: Main Menu is actually not directly related here, but you can still install it via:\nsudo apt-get install alacarte\n\nFor adding applications to autostart you can use Startup Applications. Of course there is not a ready list for that, you should know the name of the application, more accurate \"the starting command\" of the application. \nIf you don't want to use Main Menu try TAB on command line. \na_few_letter_of_name_of_application TAB TAB\n\nYou can learn the command like that. \nAnother way learning the command is this one:\ndpkg -L package_file_name\n\nand look for the /usr/bin entry.\npackage_file_name is the name from package_file_name.deb\n", "Q: Does a text to class diagram generator exist? I would like to generate a class diagram as an image. This package should read an input text file and generate the output. I don't want to draw it (so Dia is not the solution for my problem). I am searching for an equivalent for class diagrams simmilar to Graphviz with graphs.\n\nA: The closest thing I've run across so far is yuml.\nIt's got it's own particular syntax (and I've hit a few random snags every so often), but overall, it does a pretty good job, and it even provides a couple different styles and formats for output.\nIf items in your diagrams grow too large vertically, try forcing the diagram to a horizontal (dir:lr) direction.\nJust be sure to save your original text, in case you lose the link(s) to your diagram(s).\n", "Q: Using A4Tech camera with Skype I have a A4Tech Pk-635 web cam, and I can view output from web cam in Cheese.\nSkype is detecting webcam as dev/Video0, but Skype is not generating any output... any ideas?\nnote:\nIn case any one else also face this, here is a solution to fix this problem and also update skyp launcher, so that you can launch skype as usual.\n\nA: Change the skype launcher from skype to bash -c 'LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libv4l/v4l1compat.so skype'.\n\nA: if you have Skype 4.2 installed (on Ubuntu 12.04 or latest, provided you've installed ia32-libs from Synaptic) don't open Skype from the launcher, just  open your terminal and paste: LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libv4l/v4l1compat.so /usr/bin/skype  and see how your camera will work just fine on Skype.\n", "Q: Unity-2D is slow on my computer I have an old computer which works nicely with Gnome-2 (10.04 LTS).  I swapped out the hard drive and installed 11.10 for testing purposes getting ready for 12.04 LTS but Unity-2D is painfully slow, as is Gnome-fallback.  I can't even run Gnome-3-shell or Unity-full.  I understand that Gnome-2 has depreciated or is about to depreciate.  So my question is, does this mean I only have 2 choices?  Either buy a new computer which is fast enough to run Gnome-3 in a responsive manner, or switch to a lighter desktop environment, something like XFCE as Gnome-2 will no longer be an option?\nI'm wondering if someone will take on the responsibility of maintaining Gnome-2 in a separate branch after depreciation...\nI have a Dell GX270, which has:\nGraphics: Integrated Intel Extreme® Graphics 2\nRAM: 1Gb\n\n\nA: For very old hardware that is the only option, there are a few tricks that you can do to speed things up but if even Unity2D is slow on your pc then another desktop environment is the only thing that can be recommended.\nYou have said anything about your computer specs, maybe a upgrade on ram / cpu can be possible but to tell the truth that wont do miracles if the ram is already above 1gb and you have a decent cpu for your motherboard. If your motherboard can support upgrades other then what you already have then you can think about it, else you need to use a lighter desktop environment. \n\nA: I'm using old hardware with Nvidia-173 drivers and I don't like the fact \"composite\" is mandatory to use Unity correctly (very laggy).\nI had to force composite to \"off\" to avoid laggy windows by modifying /etc/X11/xorg.conf:\n\nSection \"Extensions\"\n  Option             \"Composite\" \"Disable\"\n  EndSection\n\nWith this extension disabled, Unity-2D is a lot faster but without any special effects.\n\nA: In 12.04 and 12.10, if you install the Gnome package (I think it may have also been called gnome-fallback) you will get an option called Gnome Classic (no effects). This is Gnome Panel, essentially, but upgraded to Gnome 3. No Compiz, no 3D, it's a nice, slick desktop that resembles Gnome 2 and doesn't have the downsides that the 3D accelerated Gnome 3 desktops have.\n", "Q: What is the significance of the group created along side a user? As I was reading answers to this question asking how to change usernames, a suggestion to change of the name of the group was also made in this answer. What is the significance of the groups whose only member is the user with the same name?\n\nA: This is a \"user private group scheme\" issue.\n\nIn order to allow more flexibility, most Linux systems follow the\n  so-called user private group scheme, that assigns each user primarily\n  to his or her own group. This group is a group that only contains this\n  particular user, hence the name \"private group\". Usually this group\n  has the same name as the user login name, which can be a bit\n  confusing.\n\nhttp://tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/html/sect_03_04.html\n\nWhat does this have to do with UPG?\nUPG sets the default umask to 0002 so that group users can write to\n  files. This would be undesirable and dangerous if everyone belonged to\n  one group (like the “users” group in SUSE) — but when each user is in\n  their own group, the additional group permission is moot until you\n  write into an SGID directory.\n\nhttp://www.oreillynet.com/onlamp/blog/2006/09/using_user_private_groups.html\nMore: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_permissions#User_private_group\n\nA: Well, you could have services perform actions on your behalf, for instance. The service would have its own user account, and you would add that user to your primary group. You then give your primary group a certain set of permissions, which would then automatically be given to those services. \n", "Q: How to fix Empathy startup bug and sudden crash?

I had downloaded the files for that patch there was files for each OS; Windows, solaries, OSX, Ubuntu 32 and 64 bit\nthe problem is in installing that patch in windows you need just to run the .bat file and everything works grate but i don't know how to run it for Ubuntu 32 bit ?\nthe files for that patch can be found on this link\npatch files\nand here a link to download them directly\"includes additionl files\"\nDirect Link\nso again all what i want to know is how to install the patch on Ubuntu\nRegards\n\nA: I downloaded the file (macosx_guest_vmware_7.tar.gz) just to see what it contains (in order to help you :-) ). Did you read the README file? Because, it has very clearly given instructions that you need to do in order to this patch to work.\nAnyway, as it (README) says, you have to execute the file called \"linux\" as a super-user. You can become root by typing sudo -i in your terminal emulator (i.e. gnome-terminal etc.) OR else you can temporally take super-user privileges by typing sudo in terminal emulator.\nFor an example type sudo ./linux (I assume your current directory contains these files. If not change directories accordingly)\nThat script will determine your kernel version and automatically execute relevant file. That is, since you have 32bit Linux kernel, the script \"linux\" will automatically called the \"linux_32\" script.\nAfter that you are done :-) Hope these instructions will help you... ^_^\nP.S.: Make sure no VMs or VMWare Workstation is running while you apply this patch.\n\nA: While this isn't exactly the answer you're looking for. Is there any reason to use VMware at all? In the past I used VMware, but later moved to VirtualBox and haven't missed any feature yet, so maybe you could try some other virtualization solution as a workaround to your problem.\n\nA: I am running vmware workstation 12 pro .

While I'm making call through Gmail or Skype my voice is audible to others while I'm on Windows 7, but while I'm on Ubuntu 11.10 it's not audible to others, but I am able to hear their voice. But while I'm playing music on Ubuntu along with a call, the others are able to hear the music, but my voice is not audible for them.\nPlease give me a solution for this and tell me where I can change the microphone settings on Ubuntu 11.10.\n\nA: The settings for the microphone can be accessed by clicking on the sound icon at the top right bar, which looks like a speaker with the sound waves coming out of it.\nIf you click on that then you can see the option to open your sound settings.  Do this and go to input, which is microphone.  You might have a couple options like front mic or rear mic, and you might need to try out those options.\nA lot of this has to do with your sound card which is usually on board your motherboard.  Can you tell me what kind of motherboard you have?\nOh, and sometimes the problem lies within Skype, try to open the options in skype and see whether you have options for your mic.  \n\nA: In terminal write alsamixer and you will get a sound manager. Once in, press F4 to access capture settings. If any of the \"Capture\"-modules have a couple of lines underneath -------- , try marking the module with the arrow keys, and pressing Spacebar .\nYou will see some red text, which indicates, that the module is recording. \nMaybe this will work.\n\nA: Try reducing the Mic Boost on alsamixer to 0, doing so lowered the background noise so my voice was audible. It's not perfect but it seem usable on GoogleTalk/Skype, I tested it on the sound recorder.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: The only solution to make microphone work is to install linux-backports-modules-alsa-generic...\nJust go to:\nMenu / System / Administration / Synaptic Package Manager\nAnd search and mark for installation:\nlinux-backports-modules-alsa-generic\n\ntip: if you have multiple versions click on the first and read the description which should inform what name to install...\nIf after the reboot and mic mute is off, still does not work, just go to terminal and type:\nsudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf\n\nand add or change the following:\noptions snd-hda-intel model=auto enable=yes\n\nThen Ctrl+X, type Y to write and exit, reboot and mic will work.\nBye and have lots of fun with Ubuntu (the best).\n\nA: Try changing the frequency of yourmic.

But as the conversation goes on, it appears they use plethora of apps from other desktop. Which means they have to install and run related librairies.\nSo is it interesting to install a « light » desktop manager if you use apps from different desktop ?\n\nA: If you only \"sometimes\" use an application, which uses GTK or QT libraries, but usually don't use them, then it is worth it as the libraries are only loaded if one application uses it. Furthermore, most applications only use \"some\" of the libraries, not as many as the window manager itself might require to be loaded. And in addition to the libraries there are more things which a window manager loads, which are not loaded when using another window manager even with the libraries of this manager.\nFinally you will for sure notice a faster bootup of your system when using a lightweight window manager.\n\nA: You should try to avoid using, for example, KDE apps loading kde-modules (try, i mean; there's nothing wrong with them but the point of keeping the system light) There's nothing wrong with using Qt apps; for example, comparing Amarok and Clementine, they are similar apps but Amarok is based around KDE while Clementine is just plain Qt; and so on with Gnome apps, although as they are Gtk apps usually you will have less dependencies and libraies to load if you are in Xfce or Lxde.\n", "Q: Where to find up-to-date redis package for 10.04? This is a strange thing. Ubuntu is so widely used, but it is hard to find packages for popular software.\nFor example, when you search http://software.opensuse.org you can find a package for redis:\nhttp://download.opensuse.org/repositories/server:/database/openSUSE_11.4/src/\nThis is a good expirience.\nWhere to find the latest version of the redis package for Ubuntu?\n\nA: One way to find out if a ppa exists is performing a search on launchpad:\nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas?\n\nThis will show you quite a lot of sources from where you may be able to install the version you need. Simply choose an archive you trust (e.g ppa:rwky/redis).\n\nA: It's actually very easy to recompile a DEB package.

You need to download it manually.\nAnd also I had it installed before I reformated the computer.\nAnybody has a solution to this issue?\n\nA: I'd suggest making sure you're using the version in the Ubuntu archive instead of the version from addons.mozilla.org.  The package is called xul-ext-lightning (Click to install). We keep lightning updated with Thunderbird.  \nThere will be an upgrade to 8 early next week that should come with a new compatible lightning as well.  Also, the version in the Ubuntu archive is architecture specific as opposed to addons.mozilla.org which is i386 (32 bit) only.\n\nA: I also had this problems short after a new Thunderbird version came out. The solution is, to wait with installing the newest version of thunderbird only, when all the extensions are also available in a compatible version.\n\nA: The latest Lightning 1.0 only works with Thunderbird 8.0. For Thunderbird 7, download Lightning 1.0b7 from here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/lightning/versions/\nThat is the only version that works with Thunderbird 7 so make sure you don't download some other version. Once downloaded, in Thunderbird open \"Addons\", click the icon on the left of \"Search all add-ons\" and select \"Install Add-on from file\", browse for the downloaded Lightning 1.0b7 .xpi and you're done.\n\nA: Looks like the package as of today has no \"-extension\" in its name.

I installed Ubuntu 11.10, and downloaded the nVidia GEForce 8400 GS Graphics card driver from the official site. It was a .run file, and then I entered the TTY3 interface (Alt+Ctrl+F3) and installed the graphics card as a superuser. After that, the normal GUI of Ubuntu is not coming. I did few restarts, but some lines which says \"Starting Bluetooth [OK] and Checking Battery status... [OK]\" something like that are displayed, then nothing happens. Please tell me what to do. Thanks\n\nA: Your driver is conflicting with things and stopping you from being able to boot up. What you probably want to do is boot up with the nomodeset option so that you only use the most basic programs, install the normal proprietary driver as recommended by the system if you can boot, and then you will be good to go.

Changing them appears to be possible by following the instructions here:\nhttp://www.linuxjournal.com/article/187 \nThe basics are that you need to create your own custom keymap file, then set up a custom upstart job to load that at boot time.  Note that you can make your keyboard completely unusable by doing this, so test it out before setting up the upstart job.\n\nA: Oneiric provides a utility for this.  Forgive the cattiness of this post; I can't for the life of me figure out why Ubuntu continues to ship with these keyboard shortcuts enabled in the first place.\nClick on the \"Dash Home\" icon in the top/left end of your toolbar, and search for \"keyboard\".

And I did not lose any data or settings.\nWhen the partition manager opens, you select each partition in turn and click Change and then mark those same partitions with the same mount points as they have now but you do not, I repeat do not, mark the /home partition to be formatted. You can mark / and /boot ( if you have one ) to be formatted. This will clear out completely any old files that may conflict with the new install.\nIn this way the relevant parts of Ubuntu will be installed into / and /boot but the /home partition will not be touched.\nYou will need to re-install any programs that you installed since 10.10 was installed but they will detect their configuration files in /home as will the default programs for the install.\nMay I give you some advice?

A quick test (how I finally found it): Force NetworkManager to update (via \"auto\", if your network is DHCP, for example) and Software Center will immediately restore the buttons, or if you have set up your network outside of NetworkManager (so it's safe to turn it off), disable it completely.

I have spent considerable time getting to this point in the setup that I decided that it was probably a good bet to back it all up to my external hard-drive.\nSo from various sources I gathered this:\nFirst I navigated to my external hard-drive then I created a backup folder on this drive and then I entered the following from the terminal:\nsudo tar cvpzf mybackup.tgz2 --exclude=\"/host/*\"  --exclude=\"/media/*\" --exclude=\"/mnt/*\" --exclude=\"/proc/*\" --exclude=\"/tmp/*\" /\n\nAnd the process ran for about 20 minutes when it finally kicked out with the exiting message.

Thanks for any help or suggestions.\n\nA: What the messages mean\nFirst, let's look at the messages individually:\n\ntar: removing '/' from front of names\n\nYou told tar to archive absolute paths. By default (unless you pass the -P option), tar stores relative paths, e.g. it stores etc/fstab when you tell it to store /etc/fstab. This helps if you want to untar your backup in some subdirectory (the tar program on Ubuntu does this when you extract as well, so storing the absolute path only makes a difference if you extract the archive on a non-Linux system). You can ignore that message.\n\ntar: /sys/module/bnep/sections/__mount_loc: file sharnk by 4085 bytes; padding with zeroes\n\nThis error is within /sys. Like /proc, the files under /sys are not stored on your disk, they are generated on the fly by the kernel and it doesn't make sense to back them up.\n\ntar: /home/tom/.gvfs: cannot stat: permission denied\n\n~/.gvfs is a mount point used by GVFS, the component of the Gnome desktop environment that allows access to network filesystems, archives and more. There is nothing to back up here.\n\ntar: /run/synaptic.socket: socket ignored\n\nA socket is a “meeting place” between clients and a server. There is no data stored there, and the server will create the socket when it starts. Backing up sockets is not necessary, so this message is harmless.\n\ntar: /var/lib/citadel/data file changes as we read it\n\nThat message is what it says on the tin. If a file changes while you're making the backup, you can't necessarily expect to have the latest version of the file.\nThe state of your backup\nMost of these warnings are harmless; you can selectively turn them off.\nRather than exclude the directories you know about, exclude all mount points, so that you'll end up backing up only what's on your disk. If you have several partitions (e.g. if you have a separate /home), make sure to list them all.\ntar -czf mybackup.tgz --one-file-system /\n\nI would say that you have a complete backup at this point. Of course, you should test it before you erase your data.\nFurther advice\nUnless you're short on disk space, I recommend cloning your installation so that you can run it directly off the USB disk. (See Moving linux install to a new computer; also How to migrate user settings and data to new machine?)\nUnrelated note: there are several typos in your post — “file sharnk” (the actual message is “file shrank”), “file changes as we read it” (the actual message is “file changed as we read it”). You should be copy-pasting those! Not doing copy-paste tremendously reduces the confidence we can have that the situation is as you describe.

I was wondering if I had to worry much about them with Ubuntu.\n\nA: You shouldn't worry much about viruses in Linux. However, you should still be careful at scam websites that steal info and such. \nIf you really need want to be extra safe just install an antivirus software. \nClam AV Virus Scaner is found in Ubuntu Software Center. \nFor more lecture: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_malware\nViruses are also kept off because of Ubuntu using a central software repository, so that software is checked for being virus-free. This is a good safety feature unless you use software repositories by other people. You should always check if they are trustworthy.\nSecurity bugs also get fixed very fast, because of a lot of people able to fix and actually fixing these, due to Open Source Software.\n\nA: If you are worry about Microsoft Based Systems Viruses, you can feel tranquil.

I installed Ubuntu 11.10 and it seems to be using Nvidia but not the integrated GPU. Although Nvidia seems to be working (I am using the latest Nvidia drivers from their website) I would still prefer to revert to Intel GPU due to lower power consumption. Could someone advise me the best way to do so? I am not an experienced Linux user and would appreciate if one could give me detailed instructions.\nThank you in advance, guys!\n\nA: I don't see anything that says that laptop comes with both. It likely comes with either Intel graphics or NVidia graphics. (there are a few laptops that come with both). What the page you are referencing is probably saying is that it is certified on the versions of laptops that come with Intel graphics, but not the ones with NVidia graphics.\nFor that reason, you won't be able to switch to Intel Graphics because it doesn't come with both.\n", "Q: Ruined music collection with Banshee You know the option in Banshee to change the whole folder structure of your music collection according to the meta date? I enabled that. Problem was that it only seemed to change it from the moment you opened the \"Change track info\" dialog and hit the save button. I wasn't planning to do that for my whole collection, so I looked for an easier solution. I selected the whole collection (CTRL+A), and went to \"Change track info\". There my eyes fell on a button labeled something like \"Synchronize all\" (I guess the translation was just unclear), and it seemed to me that that would do what I was searching for... It didn't. In stead, it applied the same artist ID3 tag to my whole music collection, and because of the option for changing the folder structure enabled, it changed the filename for all of those songs too. So I've got a bit of a problem here...\nThe only things still intact is the title and album of the song (title's also in the filename itself). But the artist has been set to the same for every song.\nSo, my question: Is there a way to rollback the changes? Or is my music collection permanently ruined? I haven't got my hopes up very high, but I figured it's better to ask than to just deleting everything.\n\nA: The answer to this was provided in the comments. \nProbably the best approach is :\n1) File a bug report.\n2) Restore what you can using \"MusicBrainz Picard\"\n3) Manually restore with last.fm\n\nIf you have a Last.fm account (and a little bit of free time), you may be able to use the Last.fm Fingerprint extension for Banshee to clean up the songs that Picard didn't fix.\n\n", "Q: How do I make Fn+f2/f3 change the brightness on my HP dv7-6135dx?

I'm new to Ubuntu server, which I have install (10.04). My server is connected to my Belkin router, which in turn is connected to my CISCO Linksys SPA2102 VOIP phone adapter/router. I can asscess my webpages on my server (Apache2 installed) thru my home network. But, I can not access the webpages from the internet outside of my home. I need simple step by step instructions to help me. I have install most required software (openSSH, php5, MySql, and WinSCP).\n\nA: This is a basic suggestion but you need to forward 80th port to your server:\nhttp://portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/Linksys/SPA-2102/Cisco_WVC210.htm\n\nA: This is not really related to Ubuntu, but to your network. You may have heard that the internet is running out of IP-addresses. This is true for IPv4, which almost all internet service providers use. In order to pretend that there is no problem, they've come up with a technique called Network Address Translation, or NAT for short. What this does, is that it presents you with one public IP-address and then gives you a set of private IP-addresses in your network.\nAn IP address has a set of ports that are used for services. For instance, web servers use port 80 by default. Since that port belongs to the IP, and the IP belongs to your router, you'll have to configure the router to forward all incoming connections on that port to another IP in your network. This also means that you can't have two web servers using the default port in your network. \nI don't know any specifics about those routers of yours, but it is likely that both of them use NAT. In that case, you'll have to forward ports in the first router to the second router, and from the second router to the IP of the computer you wish to use as a server. \nThis is far beyond the scope of this site. If you can connect and use the services from within your network, then your Ubuntu is fine. \n", "Q: Problem with gadmin-rsync and cron(d) I'm trying to get the Schedule for GADMIN-RSYNC working on Ubuntu 11.10.\nWhen I try to save Schedule options, I get an information window which states:\n\nError: The time schedule server \"cron(d)\" does not seem to be runing.\n\nWhen I do a ps aux | grep cron, I get this:\nroot       876  0.0  0.1  18976   944 ?

You can still manually setup the cron for your specific backup (using crontab -e) and making it run one of your backup scripts located in /etc/gadmin-rsync/scripts/ (which gadmin-rsync would likely have created). \nHope it helps!\n(note:  I would have liked to directly fix the problem in the application itself but the source code from the gadmin web site is not available atm)\n\nA: I ran across this thread trying to figure out how a particular folder kept appearing on my NAS. A few years back when I had originally setup my tower with Ubuntu and Plex Media Server. I had setup gadmin-rsync to back up some TV show folders, and never put it to use after having this same issue (the message about cron(d) not running).\nI wound up setting up a cron job manually (crontab -e). Recently, I began backing up one of the folders to another drive, rather than the NAS, and removed the folder from the NAS, as the NAS was filling up. But this folder kept reappearing every few days. A few minutes ago I found that gadmin-rsync has been backing it up twice a week, all along.\nWhen I removed a folder from my backup list (using crontab -e), this folder kept reappearing, so I removed all the cron jobs in an attempt to find out how this folder was being backed up. Low and behold it appeared on the NAS again. I wound up opening gadmin-rsync, and its log file shows that it has been backing up the original list all along at the times I had scheduled it years ago.\nSo, to anyone having this error message who would rather use a GUI rsync solution, I recommend you set the backup time to a few minutes out and try saving the backup again to see if it's actually working first, even if you are getting this error message.\n", "Q: Cannot install Ubuntu 11.04 or 11.10 on Acer Aspire M3970 I cannot install Ubuntu 11.04 or 11.10 on my new machine, not in 32-bit or 64-bit, and not from CD or USB drive.\nI tried to unplug all devices connected to USB, but nothing changes.\n[ 15.383691] sd 7:0:0:3: [sdg] Attached SCSI removeable disk.\n\nThen the installation or Live image booting does nothing more.

I'd like to buy a new 1TB disk to replace my old 150GB disk.\nIs there an easy way to copy my Ubuntu installation with\n\n\n*\n\n*my home folder content, \n\n*system settings, \n\n*applications, \n\n*and so on...\n\n\nso at the end I can just unplug my old disk and plug the new one without having to re-install everything?\n\nA: sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb will create an exact replica of sda to sdb as long as sdb is at least as big as sda.\nPlugin your hard disk to your system, make sure the BIOS is recognizing it correctly and boot normally to your system.\nCheck your hard disks with Disk Utility(To launch Disk Utility, you  can  use the dash),\nmake sure that your old hard disk is sda and your new hard disk is sdb (change the devices on the example command to reflect your hardware configuration), no need to mount the new disk (it should be empty anyways so there is nothing to mount).\nRun the command with the right devices in a terminal wait until its finished and that's it.\nPS: triple check the command and make sure that your old hard disk is in the if part and that your new disk is in the of part of the command.\nYour partitions will be copied from your old disk to the new one byte by byte so no need to worry about reconfiguring / installing MBR and bootloader. The only thing you need to do after the disk is copied is to remove the old disk from the system or set the new disk as boot device in your BIOS. \nLater on when you tested that all is ok you can resize your partitions on the new disk with gparted, boot from a LiveCD, install gparted and resize the partitions of your new disk to fit your needs.\nThis solution requires no installation of extra tools except for the installation of gparted later on for resizing the partitions.\n\nA: If you are looking for an application which has a GUI, check Clonezilla:\nhttp://clonezilla.org/\nhttp://www.howtoforge.com/back-up-restore-hard-drives-and-partitions-with-clonezilla-live\nhttp://www.backuphowto.info/how-to-backup-your-data-in-linux-using-clonezilla\nWithout a GUI:\nhttp://www.backuphowto.info/linux-backup-hard-disk-clone-dd\nhttp://mark.koli.ch/2009/05/howto-whole-disk-backups-with-dd-gzip-and-p7zip.html\n\nA: I would recommend partimage.\nYou can live-boot, install partimage and copy your partitions over.\nWhat I really like about this software is that it is quite easy to handle (it's semi-graphical :-) ) and it's fast because it only copies the non-empty blocks. In other words you can copy a 10Gb partition to a bigger (on your new drive) one without much hassle.\nInstall it with apt-get.\nmore here: http://www.partimage.org/\n\nA: May I suggest that you consider the 150GB drive to already be a backup of your home folder?\nI would replace the 150GB drive with the 1TB drive and install Ubuntu with the same version that is on the 150GB drive. I would create a separate /home partition.\nNext I would shut down and connect the 150GB drive to the machine and boot.\nAfter that, I would mount the 150GB drive and copy the contents of the 150GB drive's home folder into the home folder of the /home partition of the 1TB drive. I would include all of the hidden files that begin with a dot (.) that you see when you select View>Show Hidden files in the File Manager menu.\nI would then re-boot with the hope that the installed programs and utilities would pick up the configuration files in their respective dot (.) folders. Certainly the data in the Documents and Music folders (and other such folders) would be there.\nI had to do something similar a few years ago when I created a separate /home partition without knowing that the OS would break because it could not find its /home folder. I did not have backup of my data. I solved my problem by installing Ubuntu into another partition. I copied my data into it. I then re-installed Ubuntu in my working / partition and  set the mount point for my new /home partition and then copied my data back from the specially installed Ubuntu partition.\nIt is not the clever or beautiful solution but it works. I can say that from experience.\nRegards.\n", "Q: Can I apply a different GTK3 theme from the main one to an individual application? For example, can I keep Ambiance as main theme but assign elementary theme to elementary's app?\n\nA: Yes, the simple way is to point the application at the required path where your rc file lives, in the command that runs your application:\nGTK2_RC_FILES=/usr/share/themes/Redmond/gtk-2.0/gtkrc inkscape\n\nThis on 12.04 for inkscape (which is still Gnome2 btw) produces this:\n\nSee more information about Gtk2 theme running here.\n\nA: Its certainly possible, I don't have much of themeing experience, but when you navigate to /usr/share/themes/*Theme Name*/gtk-3.0/apps/ directory, you'll find .css files, named with apps they target to theme, so yes you can create app-specific Themes.\nNote that the way you mentioned to theme your apps may require some work to be done (like having both Ambiance and Elementary work simultaneously, since every theme has a base file on top of which app specific styling is done, (a file gtkrc in Gtk 2.0 while, a file gtk.css in case of Gtk3.0).\nAnd this base theme file contains styling rules that specifically target the given theme, hence you cannot create Elementary like look and feel from Ambiance's base theme file without making some heavy changes, and even if you do, you'll loose Ambiance look itself.\nAlso, in GNOME, it is possible to have only single theme applied at a time,  For Example, if you have used Appearance window in Ubuntu 12.04, you know can can select any single theme from the dropdown, in case you have used gnome-tweak-tool, than you can set different themes, for Gtk, Window frames, and icons, but still, it doesn't allow to target specific applications to theme, so as I said earlier, you can set totally different themes for different applications if you cleverly work with base theme file, as of now, no third party applications can do it by itself.\nOne way you can do it by yourself is that, let the base theme file (gtk.css) have only essential rules which are neutral to any theme, being dark or light. And have the actual theme design written in app-specific files that reside in above mentioned directory, i.e. for styling Nautilus, you can write all required properties in nautilus.css file. Same with every app you wish to target. Obviously, doing such requires some decent Gtk themeing experience.\nYou may refer this for creating your own theme using template, Also there's a decent documentation on Gtk+ themeing.\n\nA: You can use the GTK environment variable GTK_THEME=elementary to launch an app with the elementary theme. For example, running GTK_THEME=elementary pantheon-files will launch the elementary Files app using the elementary GTK theme.\nTo get this to apply every time you launch a specific app, your best option is likely to create a custom .desktop file (launcher).\nCreate a custom .desktop file\n\n*\n\n*Open your file browser\n\n*Navigate to /usr/share/applications/\n\n*Copy the launcher (highlight and Ctrl+C) for the app you want to launch with the elementary theme\n\n*Navigate to ~/.local/share/applications/ and paste the launcher (Ctrl+V)\n\n*Right-click and open the launcher with a text editor\n\n*Modify the line starting with Exec= to include Exec=env GTK_THEME=elementary and then the previous existing contents of the line. (So Exec=pantheon-files would become Exec=env GTK_THEME=elementary pantheon-files)\n\n*Save and close the file\n\nThe next time you launch the app from Unity (or your app launcher of choice) it will use the elementary theme.\nBonus: make it work when using command line\nYou may also want the app to launch with the elementary theme when launching it from the command line. To do so:\n\n*\n\n*Open your Terminal app\n\n*Type alias pantheon-files=\"GTK_THEME=elementary pantheon-files\" (replacing pantheon-files with the desired app)\n\n*Press Enter\n\n\nCaveats:\n\n*\n\n*This will not change your window manager's theme to the elementary theme.\n\n*This (by design) will only apply to your account, not root or anyone else on the machine.\n\n*The theme names are cAsE-sEnsItiVe and should be matched with the theme folder name.\n\n\nSources:\n\n*\n\n*I'm an elementary contributor ;)\n\n*GTK+ 3 Reference Manual: Running GTK+ Applications\n\n*Set variable in .desktop file\n\nA: Yes you can, actually I googled and got some answers:\n\n\n*\n\n*Look for the exact executable for the program you want to change the theme. For example, if you want it for ooffice then type which ooffice in the terminal.\n\n*Look for the bin folder where all applications put their binary executables. Type echo $PATH in the terminal and you will ge the path. I recommend you to create a bin folder in your home directory by typing mkdir ~/bin\n\n*Type gedit ~/.bashrc to open your bash rc file.\n\n*Go to the bottom of this file and add this line export PATH=~/bin:${PATH}\nNow we will create a script which will execute your program with custom theme:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create application's script file by typing: gedit ~/bin/ooffice\n\n*Type these lines in the opened file: \n#!/bin/bash\nenv GTK2_RC_FILES=/usr/share/themes/SlicknessX/gtk-2.0/gtkrc /usr/bin/ooffice \"$@\"\n\n\n*Change the mode of the file to executable by typing: chmod +x ~/bin/ooffice.\nHope this helps, you have to remember only one thing, the format of the script as shown below:\n#!/bin/bash\nenv GTK2_RC_FILES=PATH_TO_GTKRC PATH_TO_EXECUTABLE \"$@\"\n\n\nA: The question is still valid and I found a way:\n\n*\n\n*create any folder path/to/MY_FOLDER\n\n\n*create a /share/themes/ folder inside it (that is path/to/MY_FOLDER/share/themes).\n\n\n*put any GTK3 theme inside the latter\n\n\n*rename the theme to the name of the CURRENTLY ACTIVE THEME.\nAt last, this command will make an app use the renamed theme instead of the currently active one:\nGTK_DATA_PREFIX=path/to/MY_FOLDER YOUR_APPLICATON\n(The path after GTK_DATA_PREFIX= has to be that (and only that) to the folder that contains /share/themes/RENAMED_THEME. That's why it's NOT path/to/MY_FOLDER/share/themes/RENAMED_THEME, but just path/to/MY_FOLDER.)\nTo have that inside a launcher, replace accordingly:\nExec=sh -c 'GTK_DATA_PREFIX=path/to/MY_FOLDER YOUR_APPLICATION'\n\n", "Q: How do I Replace Mythbuntu with 11.04 w/o Trashing SW Raid I have a MythUbuntu server with a 14tb SW raid setup. I am finding Myth too finicky and would like to go to a vanilla Ubuntu install. Can someone direct me on the best way to approach this without trashing my Raid setup. I have a separate boot drive but am hesitant to proceed due to my newbie status and lack of experience with the raid aspects of the server.\nOther than the fact I don't use any of the Myth features, the biggest problem I am having with the Myth setup is the one thing I do use and need - a Samba Share- will intermittently \"disappear\" from my network even though I have full network connectivity. It will mysteriously drop from the network and just as mysteriously show up anywhere from 10 minutes to 3 days later. This server has been operating for almost 2 years and just recently started acting screwy. No interaction, including rebooting, uninstalling/reinstalling Samba, recreating a new/replacement share, etc., seems to make any difference with these mystery actions. I have replaced the network card, ensured all updates are installed, and no one is interacting with the server when it disappears/reappears. I have 4 other Ubuntu servers and this is the only one having problems. \n\nA: You can install the standard Ubuntu desktop right into your Mythbuntu setup by doing\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nThen you may even choose to uninstall mythbuntu-related packages if you don't need them.\nHowever, I don't think it'll solve your problems with Samba. For that, checking samba logs may give you some insights.\n", "Q: Why do bad requests take so long? I noticed this is other OSes as well, but most visibly in Ubuntu Linux. Whenever a good request is made, it is computed practically instantly. However, whenever a bad request is made (a bad password, a non-existent command, etc) it takes a few seconds before it lets me try to give input again. Is this some kind of security measure?\n\nA: Generic answer to generic question: a 'bad request' is determined to be 'not found' only after searching all possibilities for a match and finding none. However, when something is 'found', it is usually specific enough to be found very quickly, and not all possibilities need to be checked before determining it is 'found'.\n\nA: The delay after entering a wrong password is done deliberately for security reasons.\nThe delay when entering a wrong command line into the terminal is a side-effect caused by Ubuntu having some extra mechanics that trigger when a command isn't found. Instead of just printing \"command not found\", Ubuntu searches it's repository to see if the command you typed is provided by a program you don't have currently installed and then gives instructions on how to install it. That search can take a second or two.\n\nA: I agree with kyleN's answer regarding why typing a wrong command in terminal takes longer then starting an existing program.\nA pause after entering a wrong password, however, is a completely different matter - this delay is introduced intentionally to prevent brute-force password attacks (i.e. trying thousands of passwords a second until one matches).

Your PHP.INI doesn't have the mysql\n  line uncommented, so it's not loading the mysql module (or the module\n  is simply missing entirely).\nRestart your webserver after you fix the PHP.INI file.\n\nThere are lots of forums and official support threads that refers to that last one as a final solution. But I also suggest you to install a MySQL Administration tool (or workbench, whatever you prefer) in order to make sure your MySQL installation is properly working. Some suggestions can be found in the answers provided right here: Are there any GUIs for Mysql?

The company I work for is going to buy me a new laptop before the end of the year. Right now I use Ubuntu 11.04 on a ~3.5 year old Dell Vostro 1700. It's a dual boot install and it runs good enough, but it's not perfect. I attribute most problems I experience to the age/wear of the laptop, not Ubuntu.\nI'm going to do a full install on whatever laptop I buy next, so no Windows or OS X at all, only Ubuntu.\nI'm looking at a Dell Precision M6600 and also at a MacBook Pro 17-inch. Work is paying for the machine, so thankfully price is not a concern. I just want Ubuntu to run flawlessly. I use Ubuntu because it makes me so much more efficient at my job (web development, etc.). I don't customize the OS much and I'm not messing around too much behind the scenes. I just want Ubuntu to run as smoothly and reliably as possible.\nIs one of these two machines - Dell M6600 or MacBook Pro 17\" - better suited for Ubuntu than the other? If I'm not using Windows or OS X that comes w/ the machine am I losing a lot of the performance gains from the hardware, or can Ubuntu take full advantage of all the specs?\nNote: I have only been using Linux regularly for under a year. My knowledge of video cards, chips and other hardware and specs (and how they relate to Ubuntu) is somewhat limited.\n\nA: Both laptops ships with high end specs. The Dell M6600 is an Ubuntu certified laptop, So chances of glitches are very low while running Ubuntu. \nMacbook Pro \n\n\n*\n\n*Things like special function keys won't work out-of-the-box.\n\n*Battery life will be significantly lower [citation needed].\n\n*A generally less integrated experience (Thunderbolt and WLAN aren't working yet with Natty or later and the\nlatest offering of MacBook Pros). Hibernate and suspend tend to be a\nbit iffy.\n\n*The clickpad is atrocious under ubuntu. It's completely impossible to do things like right-click-drag, and there's no middle click at all like there is with the dell.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nInstalling and working of ubuntu in Macbook will require little bit more effort than installing it in a Dell machine (Check this).  The Dell runs ubuntu 11.10 very well.\n\nA: I've run both the 17\" 5,2 Macbook Pro and now the M4600 Dell.  I also had the 1,2 17\" MBP (read really early edition) and a couple of powerbooks before.  Apple always has great screen resolutions but their hardware ALWAYS seems to have some horrible flaw.  On the powerbooks there was a softpoint near the power coupling.  The Macbook corrected this but the CD would eventually jam (because you can't help but putting weight on it since it is under the wrist).  The later unibody fixed that by moving the CDRom to the side but there is a stupid softpoint where the battery indicator light is on the front-left side.  \nYou'll be able to get a higher performance spec Dell that will run wonderfully with 11.10.  The MBP will also work but you may have to wait a release or two for drivers (sound, etc).  The performance of the M4600 is excellent.  I don't really use Windows so I can't compare it.  The one place Linux always suffers is power management.  If you have the new ones with a built in Intel video that supplements say the NVidia or AMD, you will not be able to switch dynamically and will need to disable the onboard video.  There is some attempt by a project to support it, but it isn't stable yet.  \nEverything else will work great.  I got 16gb, a solid state mini and additional 7200 drive.  \n\nA: *\n\n*If you want any of the fancy weird features that come with the Dell like the touch screen or number pad... You're not going to get those on a Macbook.  Plus, the fancy weird features of the macbook don't work under ubuntu anyway.\n\n*The non-OSX drivers for Macbooks are underwhelming, from what I've heard -- edited by someone who's tried running ubuntu on a Macbook.. it's a painful experience.  Many 'need to have' features simply don't work - with no viable workarounds.\n\n\nA: Interesting question - I just had the same conundrum myself and was originally looking at 15 inch laptops.. but then I found out about the m6600 and found a great deal on one on ebay.  You dell haters obviously haven't tried this machine yourselves.. it's amazing.  Warning though - it's huge.  Quite a bit bigger than the macbook pro 17 inch.. in all three dimensions.  HOWEVER.. it has an amazing cooling system and a great keyboard.  See here for a great explanation of how awesome this machine is:  http://forum.notebookreview.com/dell-latitude-vostro-precision/597919-m6600-owners-review-warning-large-pics-personal-opinions.html\nI'm running ubuntu 11.10 on it at the moment and it's working great so far. I'm just trying to figure out whether I want the AMD drivers for the firepro graphics card.. so far the open source ones are working fine with both unity and gnome shell though, so this isn't really a problem as much as it's a choice.  I'd totally recommend the m6600 if 'extreme portability' isn't one of your main concerns.\nMonster edit:\nLet me qualify this post a bit - Starting in 2006 I used a 15\" HP nc8430 with ubuntu/windows dual boot, for 4 years solid with a few niggling complaints here and there (mostly software related).  Overall it was a fantastic machine.  I even recently upgraded to ubuntu 11.10 on it, in fact and it's still working great.  At work, I used ubuntu, but while on the go and while at home I used windows, mainly for the better battery life and ability to play some games.\nThen I switched jobs in mid 2010 and had the choice of a thinkpad or a macbook pro 15\".  I tried the thinkpad at first, but it had a horrible screen (way too dim) and terrible battery life (It might've been a dud).  I decided to try the macbook since I knew it was more expensive than I'd ever purchase on my own, but regardless of everything I tried, I couldn't stand OSX.  In the end, I decided that my beef with it was the lack of customization abilities.. if you don't want to work on things 'the apple way', you're totally out of luck.  So, I tried putting ubuntu 11.04 on it.  Wow.. what a mistake.  There is nothing more frustrating than trying to run ubuntu on a macbook.  No right-click-drag at all, and right click on its own is difficult.  No middle click.  Spotty wireless.  Horrendous battery life (would get 8 hours in OSX, barely over 1 hour in ubuntu).  After a few days of looking for solutions and finding nothing but other complaints online, I installed windows 7 on it.  Turns out the macbook pros are some of the best windows laptops you can buy.  Battery life was excellent (on par with OSX), the clickpad is great, (except you still can't really right-click-drag easily), and all hardware works fine given the bootcamp driver package.  Overall, this was a great solution for me as it allowed me to game some while on the train and get work done in an office environment that used outlook and MS Office heavily.\nAfter a little more than a year with the macbook pro, I'm at yet another job now.. and there were no 'company laptops' I had to choose from this time, so I was able to pick anything I wanted.  I shopped around for a VERY long time, and had a budget of around $1,500.  My main shopping points were power, great screen with as high of a resolution as possible, good ubuntu compatibility and decent battery life.  Naturally portability was a deciding factor, but I was willing to give it up for the right combinations of features and price.  I chose the Dell M6600 (very surprised to choose a dell, as I had the previous negative perceptions of them that many people do), mainly because of the convincing personal reviews of the machine and the fact that the specific deal I found on one offered far more computing power and expandability options than anything else in its price range.\nI put two SSDs in it, one mSATA 128gb and one 2.5\" 40GB, and it holds both of these along with the original 750GB 7,200 drive and the slot-loading dvd burner.  Ubuntu is on the 40gb SSD, windows 7 is on the mSATA SSD, and the 750gb drive holds my media.  Ubuntu is faster than a bat out of hell (boots in about 10 seconds, applications load instantaneously) and the open source drivers work great with the firepro m8900.  Battery life could be better under ubuntu, (I can get about 1:20) but I'm confident this will be improve over time.  In windows battery life is a bit better, offering up to 3 hours with light usage or a little over 1 hour while gaming.\nThe main things I'm really liking about this laptop after a few weeks of heavy use are:\n\n\n*\n\n*The screen - matte finish, 17\" of 1080p goodness, led-backlit, very bright if you want it to be, excellent colors\n\n*Keyboard - great feel and action.. good layout, dedicated pgup,pgdn keys next to arrows.\n\n*Cooling system - even while gaming the fans do a good job of keeping the system cool.. without getting noisy.  In fact, the macbook pro 15\" got louder and hotter under the heavy load of gaming.\n\n*Build quality and looks - total 'sleeper' machine.  It couldn't look more utilitarian, but everything is clean, polished, and put together very well.  Working inside the machine is a joy, and  if you like the 'form follows function' look of thinkpads but can't stand the 80's color scheme, this might be the line of laptops for you.\n\n\nA: I know that I will most definitely  be slammed for this, but truthfully, for web development go with the MacBook Pro and run OS X. It's based on FreeBSD, has a wonderful UI, has some great package managers, wonderful text editors, and all kinds of other great stuff. Another thing is the stability of it, for me, my OS X machines has made me much more productive so far because of the fact I don't constantly need to be tweaking everything and fixing things. (I also use Ubuntu and Windows on a daily basis...so I'm impartial.)\n", "Q: Transparent see-through terminal and windows key I just upgraded to Ubuntu 11.10 and I'm having a couple of issues that I didn't have with #10.  First of all, when the terminal is transparent, it shows the desktop rather than the window behind it.  Being able to read the window behind the terminal at the same time was a really useful feature of the transparency, but now it's just showing the desktop instead.\nSecond of all, the Windows key seems to be ignored.  I mostly use it for \"Windows-D,\" which shows the desktop.  Is there another such shortcut or a way to disable the windows key?\nI also switched back to the Gnome Classic view.  I like it a lot better than the new view, but the new view had a way to quickly search files and applications based on the name.  Where is this in Gnome Classic?\n\nA: There are three questions here, it helps if you separate these into three different questions.\nFor your transparency issues, please see this question.\nI'm not sure if the Super key is being ignored, or if that keyboard shortcut just isn't working. In the latest version of Ubuntu it was changed from Super+D to Ctrl + Alt + D. You can change it back in the keyboard preferences.\nThirdly, what you're talking about, I think, is the Dash. This is specific to Unity, which is not part of Gnome Classic. If you want to use the dash, you'll need to use the regular window manager.\nThere are other applications that do similar things though. Try Gnome-Do, for example.\n\nA: As for the Terminal transparent thing you can set it to your preference by click on 'Edit' at your Terminal, select 'Background' and checked 'Transparent background' and adjust its effect with the slide to your taste. I don't quite understand the two remaining questions. It would be nice to explain them in details. Thank you. \n", "Q: How to comply with this guideline for submitting an application to the Software Center? I was reading through the Ubuntu Developer Programme Agreement for submitting applications to the Software Center and stubled across the following clause:\n\n3.1 You must first test Apps you submit to confirm they are compatible with all currently supported versions of Ubuntu (as listed on Canonical's website at the date of submission by you) and your Apps must comply with the Publishing Policy.\n\nDoes this mean I must install both the 32 and 64 bit versions of Ubuntu 8.04, 10.04, 10.10, 11.04, and 11.10? If so, that's 10 installations of Ubuntu - is that really feasible (even with virtual machines)?\nAlternatively, does anyone have suggestions for testing the application without actually installing each version? Some sort of chroot tool, perhaps?\n\nEdit: I have begun setting up chroot environments for compiling and testing the applications. Is this considered testing and therefore satisfies the requirements of the license agreement?\n\nA: To answer your first question, it is feasible, if time consuming. As you probably already read:\n\nNormal Ubuntu releases are supported for 18 months. Previous Ubuntu LTS (Long Term Support) releases are supported for 3 years on the desktop and 5 years on the server. Starting with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, LTS releases will be supported for 5 years on both the desktop and the server. - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases\n\nSo, yes, as of November 2011, you must test with\n\n\n*\n\n*8.04 (server edition)\n\n*10.04\n\n*10.10\n\n*11.04\n\n*11.11\n\n\nUsing a virtual machine would be one way. Another way would be to download the .iso files for each release's LiveCD, then use your bootloader to create an entry for each .iso. You can find instructions here to add entires to /etc/grub.d/40_custom which will survive kernel upgrades.\nNote that 'versions' does not mean architectures. You do not need to test on both 32- and 64-bit architectures, so there are only five tests you need to run, not 10 :)\n\nA: The clause is meant to inform you, the developer, that it is your responsibility (obligation to use that terminology) to ensure your application runs on the supported versions of Ubuntu, not Canonical's. You are not forced to test on all versions, but it is in your best interest to ensure it runs on the latest Ubuntu release and prior versions. \nFor the purposes of the software center and paid applications, you should test 11.10, 11.04 and 10.10. You always have the option of only supporting the latest version if you wish and just need to inform the reviewer of that requirement when submitting your application.\nIn the case of ARB apps (FLOSS apps) you will want to ensure compatibility with all supported releases.\nI hope that helps clarify the terms a bit better.\n", "Q: Gnome Shell - Battery only charges to about 90-91% In Gnome Shell, I am charging my battery but it won't go past 91% at the most.

When sending mail, Postfix inserts the authenticated user’s IP and username into the Received header on the email. While this is useful for tracking down who sent a particular email that was sent from your mail server, it also has privacy implications. In a small-scale situation where I can trust all the users not to get their accounts compromised and turned into spam zombies, I’d rather not broadcast IP addresses and account names for all to read. In short, how do I set up Postfix to not send this:\n\nReceived: from [x.x.x.x] (pc1.example.com  [x.x.x.x]) (using TLSv1\n  with cipher DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA (256/256 bits))    (No client certificate\n  requested)    (Authenticated sender: user)    by  mail.example.com\n  (Postfix) with ESMTPSA id CC77010C148 for  ; Fri, 11\n  Nov 2011 04:55:18 +0000 (UTC)\n\n\nA: The standard solution is to use the header_checks option. This will work, however, if we filter received lines on all mail both incoming and outgoing (as this will do), we could potentially lose Received headers on mail sent to us, which can be important for troubleshooting. To get around this problem, we will apply the header_checks only to the mail that could not possibly have been sent to us—mail that was sent to the submission port (you are using the submission port, aren’t you?).\nThis post explains how to apply header_checks exclusively to the submission port. What we need to do is pass the cleanup_service_name option to the submission service so that we can set up a new cleanup service, “subcleanup.” The relevant section of /etc/postfix/master.cf might look like this:\nsubmission inet n       -       -       -       -       smtpd\n  -o smtpd_tls_security_level=encrypt\n  -o smtpd_sasl_auth_enable=yes\n  -o smtpd_client_restrictions=permit_sasl_authenticated,reject\n  -o milter_macro_daemon_name=ORIGINATING\n  -o cleanup_service_name=subcleanup\n\nNow we can pass the header_checks option to the new cleanup service. That part of /etc/postfix/master.cf might look like this:\ncleanup   unix  n       -       -       -       0       cleanup\nsubcleanup unix n       -       -       -       0       cleanup\n  -o header_checks=regexp:/etc/postfix/submission_header_checks\n\nFinally, we need to create the file /etc/postfix/submission_header_checks, which will contain the regex that filters offending Received header lines.  Which regex you put in the file depends on whether you have smtpd_sasl_authenticated_header set.\nIf smtpd_sasl_authenticated_header is yes, then use:\n/^Received:.*\\(Authenticated sender:/ IGNORE\n\nOtherwise, use:\n/^Received:.*\\(Postfix/ IGNORE\n\n(Thanks to Dominic P and Bryan Drewery for showing how to handle the second case.)\n\nA: Solving the problem of two \"Received\" headers from PHPLIST.\nWe open /etc/postfix/main.cf  Adding at the end:\nheader_checks = regexp:/etc/postfix/header_checks\n\nСreate the file /etc/postfix/header_checks  We write in it:\n/^Received:/ IGNORE\n\npostfix reload z\n\nA: You can use \nsmtpd_sasl_authenticated_header = no\n\nin postfix/main.cf to eliminate the header information in your outgoing mails. \n", "Q: Play sound through two or more outputs/devices I have one sound card and one pair of Bluetooth headphones. I want to play my audio through both my sound card and my Bluetooth headphones.\nI believe Windows has checkboxes that allow you to \"check\" outputs to enable/disable them, but Ubuntu seemingly has the equivalent of radio selectors (you can only select one at a time).\nBonus question:\nOn a similar note, I have 5 analog output channels on my sound card (in addition to my digital & HDMI audio) -- I would like to be able to determine what comes out of each of those ports (e.g. \"front speakers\" on all 5 or \"front\", \"center\", \"back\", etc).\n\nA: Because LeonidMew was asking about 18.04 (I'm using 18.04.2), here's my version.\nThe GUI paprefs tried to combine one HDMI with one analog output, instead of both hdmi.

I prefear to not break anything if possible, so thats why I am asking.\nThanks in advance!\nRoberto\n\nA: An em is the width of the character M. Well, that's the etymological reason, anyway. It is a measurement of size in relation to your font size. Gnome Shell uses CSS, which is the same language that most all webpages use. This means there are buckets of places to find information about how it's used.

The API reference documentation doesn't mention any attribute of the project or distribution entry relating to the actual bugs (just the bug supervisor), nor does the bug entry make it clear what project it affects. Given the way the functions above work, I would have expected\nubuntu_bugs = launchpad.distributions['ubuntu'].bugs[<bug number>]\n\nto return a certain bug affecting Ubuntu, but it doesn't and there's no obvious way to do it.\n\nA: In launchpad there are two different entities:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bugs: General information related to a problem\n\n*Bug task: Project/Distro specific information: status, importance, assigned to, etc.\n\n\nNote that a bug is a general concept that might contain multiple tasks that are targeted against milestones for projects and distros. Hence, what you can search for a given project are the bug tasks that have been targeted for that project, not the bugs themselves (you can get the bug for each bug task though).\nHence, the way to look for the bug information would be as follows:\nubuntu = launchpad.distributions['ubuntu']\ntasks = ubuntu.searchTasks()\ntask = tasks[0]    # Get one task as an example\ntask.bug           # Display bug for the given task\n\nFor more information, please have a look at the API documentation for the searchTasks method (in particular, the status parameter is quite useful).\n", "Q: Why does play/pause shortcut not work? When I would like to pause/play my radiotray application used the required shortcut the next window can been seen:\n\nHow can I solve this problem? Sometimes the shortcut works, but I do not know why.\n\nA: Your media keys are likely working fine. However, they control your default music player which—judging by the overlay—isn't launched, or has nothing in the playlist.\n\nRadioTray can't be added as the default music player, unfortunately, because it doesn't support the MPRIS API Ubuntu uses for extra-application media controls. The status of that issue can be tracked here, it seems.\n\nA: @Regisz: Same here, I have Audacious as my default media player, but it doesn't work with multimedia buttons on my wireless keyboard or any keys on my headset. As soon as I start Rhytmbox while having Audacious still running, I can \"control\" both media players with a single Play/Pause button somehow. \nAnyway, this question could be a duplicate of:\nCan I map the media player function keys to a media player other than Totem?\nBTW, I've just found out that the new version of Audacious has own plugin for multimedia keys, so my similar issue has been resolved with it.

Is it possible? \nMy system uses the ext3 file system.\nThanks a lot!\n\nA: Most Unix-like operating systems don't store the creation time of file or directories. You can get their modification time, last access time, and inode change time via the ls and stat commands.\nBut, there are some third party tools as we can see in other answers. \nAnd, FreeBSD seems to have that capability. See @Graham Perrin's comment here which goes to that answer.\n\nA: Assuming that you are using ext4, you can see when a file was created. The ext4 file system stores this as crtime. \nYou can get this information with the debugfs command. \nHere is a script that you can run with superuser privileges to print the crtime of a file. (Note that it requires ruby and has a bug in the first line: #!/usr/bin/env ruby)\n\nA: The brute force 'old school' way for ext3 is the \"Tripwire\" method (I named it from the insidious Tripwire product): build a list of files, then do it again, run diff.  The more often you build your list and diff it, more close in time you will know when directories were both created AND deleted.\nThe two ways to build such a list is use: ls or to use lsof.  You only need to save the diffs.  If you know the user or the specific parent directory is not too large, then you can run it every second or more often (since sleep takes decimals) in a loop.\n\nA: You can use a third party tool to do the job :\n I think of OSSEC, which is able to monitor directory content and file modification.\n", "Q: Nautilus-compatible file \"commander\" for power users I was spoilt by Konqueror in KDE 3.5.x which used to:\n\n\n*\n\n*integrated browsing of FTP,DAV,SSH,SAMBA resources\n\n*integrated terminals\n\n*powerful multi-pane and tabs support (it used to open web pages and other files)\n\n\n\nI want to manage 4-8 directories at once, with the occasional SSH or Samba directory. \nThere are a lot of power-user file browsers, but I want something that plays nice with the existing Nautilus - with previews, bookmarks, context actions etc.\n\nA: *\n\n*To browse the Network just open and mount a network location by Bowse Network or choose Go -> Network.\n\n*To have an integrated terminal see Nautilus-Terminal, also available from this ppa: ppa:flozz/flozz\n\n*Nautilus 3 is able to open directories in a new tab by default (right-click context menu Open in New Tab)\n\n*For custom menus see Nautilus Actions\n", "Q: How to reset the language of the package descriptions I have had German as my main language about a year ago. Later I changed it to English. \nMost parts of the system accepted the change. \nThe notable exceptions are the package descriptions, which remain in German for some packages.  \nYou can see in the image (apt-cache and software-center), that while some descriptions are in English, some have remained in  German. So the question is: how do I reset this? I guess that there is somewhere a description cache that needs to be told that it should update all descriptions?\n\nEDIT: As asked: the output of some language related commands:\n$ cat /etc/default/locale\nLANG=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\n\n$ apt-config dump | grep Lang\nAcquire::Languages \"\";\nAcquire::Languages:: \"de_DE\";\nAcquire::Languages:: \"de\";\nAcquire::Languages:: \"en\";\nAcquire::Languages:: \"none\";\n\n$ locale\nLANG=de_DE.UTF-8\nLANGUAGE=en\nLC_CTYPE=\"de_DE.UTF-8\"\nLC_NUMERIC=\"de_DE.UTF-8\"\nLC_TIME=\"de_DE.UTF-8\"\nLC_COLLATE=\"de_DE.UTF-8\"\nLC_MONETARY=\"de_DE.UTF-8\"\nLC_MESSAGES=\"de_DE.UTF-8\"\nLC_PAPER=\"de_DE.UTF-8\"\nLC_NAME=\"de_DE.UTF-8\"\nLC_ADDRESS=\"de_DE.UTF-8\"\nLC_TELEPHONE=\"de_DE.UTF-8\"\nLC_MEASUREMENT=\"de_DE.UTF-8\"\nLC_IDENTIFICATION=\"de_DE.UTF-8\"\nLC_ALL=\n\nAs a note: I'm not sure what each entry means, but some of the de_DE.UTF-8 are probably ok, since I do want paper-sizes, monetary, time, etc. in standard German formats. \n\nA: I have done some tests, and I can say that the locale variable that determine the APT behavior about translations to download is LC_MESSAGES, as expected.\nIn fact, if you do the following commands:\nexport LC_MESSAGES=en_US.UTF-8\nsudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\nsudo apt-get update\n\nyou should come up to english translations only.\nTo permanently have that variable set to english, you should put the lines\nexport LC_MESSAGES=en_US.UTF-8\n\nin your ~/.profile.\nTake also into account that modifying that variable could influence the behavior of other applications too, because they use that setting to decide with which language to talk to the user. If you want to have package description in english without modifying the LC_MESSAGES variable, you can create a file in the /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/ directory, say you name it 20language, and put the following content in it\nAcquire::Languages \"en\";\n\nafter done that, and before updating the repository cache, remove the old cache with\nsudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n\n\nA: The first 3 lines of code in enzotib's answer did not solve the problem.

It's more or less desktop-agnostic and in theory should also support Unity. From the original blog post by Arnon Weinberg:\n\nGNOME session save and restore\nThis script is used to save and restore a desktop session.\nWhy this script?\nSome desktop managers do offer some session management features.\n  Under GNOME it may be possible to run gnome-session-properties manually and turn on “Automatically remember running applications when logging out”.\n  However, some GNOME implementations (notably Ubuntu’s) appear to be deemphasizing or deprecating this feature in favour of the Suspend or Hibernate feature.\nBoth the automated session save and suspend feature however are limited to saving/restoring sessions only on clean logout/login.\nI use this script because sometimes I just need to reboot, and sometimes I like to restore my session to a previous state.\nHow to use:\nDownload the script, place it on your PATH, and be sure to give it executable permissions.\nTo save the current session:\nsession save\n\nTo restore the saved session:\nsession restore\n\n\nInstallation on Ubuntu\nThe installation instructions provided in the blog post are valid for Fedora.

Now it seems to Nautilus copies files in some random order, so when listening to an audio book or something I get all the chapters in random order, wich isn't so great when your on a bicycle so you can't take your MP3 player out of your pocket to find the right one. When using mc (Midnight Commander) most files are copies in alphabetical order, and that's the way I want it to happen.\nSo is there...\n\n\n*\n\n*any way to tell Nautilus to copy files and folders in alphabetical order?\n\n*a program wich can sort the files and folders in alphabetical order directly on the filesystem?\n\n\n\nAdditional information:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Elementary OS 0.1 Jupiter (based on Ubuntu 10.10)\n  \n*64-bits\n  \n*Copying music over from an NTFS filesystem to a strangely formed FAT32 filesystem on the MP3 player.\n  \n\n\nA: To embellish the answer by enzotib ; these players play files in the order they find them in the File Allocation Table (the FAT, in FAT).\nFATSort is therefore one potential solution to the problem. The noted warning is for 2 reasons ;\n\n\n*\n\n*The tool edits the file allocation table right at the bare metal level\n\n*\n\n*It moves the file entries around within the confines of the directory table, so a corrupt filesystem will be more broken than it was before\n\n*As long as the filesystem passes a fsck.vfat check, you should be fine.\n\n\n*The author appears to feel that he hasn't devoted enough time to making his code secure\n\n*\n\n*Potentially, you could create a (broken) file allocation table that caused a buffer overrun or similar problem in the FATSort application\n\n*In reality, this is unlikely - it's something of a niche application, the opportunities for an attacker to place a specially crafted file system on your MP3 player are limited, and if he had such an opportunity, there are much softer targets he'd go after first\n\n*Again, if your filesystem passes fsck.vfat (or a disk check in Windows), you should be fine - this is a belt-and-braces disclaimer by the author\n\n\n\npalimpsest / Disk Utility has options to do a disk check from the GUI.\nOther programs that sort the FAT can be seen here : http://www.murraymoffatt.com/software-problem-0010.html\nAlternate solutions ;\nCopy files in the play order\nThe simplest and most obvious is to copy the files to the player in the order which you wish them to play. Nautilus copies files in an apparently indeterminate order to the player file system for much the same reason - it tends to operate on files in the order the iNodes are arranged on disk.\nIf your track file names have the track number at the beginning, this is ideal. Most of the command line tools will sort things in lexicographic order. As you note, tools like Midnight Commander will also do this.\n# Find the files in the source     | copy them to the target folder\n# Note we use the          -print0 |       -0   args because media file names\n# commonly contain spaces\n\nfind /path/to/music/folder -print0 | xargs -0 cp -t /path/to/target/folder\n\nCreate a playlist\nSome players support playlist files. I keep scripts in my MP3 player filesystem to support generating these playlists. My player is an iRiver device, which has a specific binary playlist format. If your player supports .m3u playlists, the format is extremely simple, and just consists of commented metadata and paths in a text file. I used to make playlists in Rhythmbox and transform them to the iRiver format ; I've not had occasion to make one using Banshee yet (I only make them for workout purposes and my workouts are very predictable...)\n\nA: The utility you look for exists, and is FATSort.\nIt is available in Ubuntu Repositories in the fatsort package.\n\nA: It could be that the player uses the modification time of the file. You could use a python script like the following to get all files in a folder, and touch them to change the last access time. Without the player, I can't test the result of cause.\nimport os\nimport sys\npath = sys.argv[1]\nthefiles = os.listdir(path)\nthefiles.sort()\nfor fname in thefiles:\n    os.utime(os.path.join(path, fname), None)\n\nThis script should be run on the player folder (replace \"path_to_the_player_folder\" with the actual path) like this (if you saved it as touch_all.py): python touch_all.py \"path_to_the_player_folder\"\nI have no idea on how to tell nautilus how to copy files. Others might answer that part of the question, though.\n\nA: Regarding fatsort, use it like this :\nsudo umount /dev/sdxxxx\nfatsort /dev/sdxxx\nYou need to figure out what dev it actually is - could be sda, sdb, etc.\nsudo fdisk -l \n\nshould show you the mounted systems.\n\nA: Find out which device name the MP3-Player has:\nlsblk\n(In my case it was /dev/sdb1)\nShow the current order of all files (without doing any changes):\nsudo fatsort -l /dev/sdb1\nSort all files on the MP3-Player in alphabetical order:\numount /dev/sdb1\nsudo fatsort -a /dev/sdb1\nIf fatsort complains about a defective file system => repair it:\nsudo dosfsck -r -l -v /dev/sdb1\nAny questions about command line parameters:\nman fatsort\nman dosfsck\n", "Q: Compare installed deb package with deb file I have some problems with one deb package installed on my ubuntu server.

What file does Gnome3 (without Unity) store the top/bottom panel \"orientation\" settings in? This sort of thing used to be available in the gconf-editor under apps/panel, but there doesn't seem to be anything about panel orientation there anymore. Where can I find it?\nI don't even have a ~/.gconf/apps/panel directory, so I can't reset as described in this other question (probably Gnome2 info). I have ~/.gconf/apps/panel3-applets and ~/.gconf/apps/gnome-settings/gnome-panel, but neither of them has anything about panel orientation (the former just has applet config, as you'd expect; the latter just has a %gconf.xml containing only run history). I even removed my ~/.gconf directory entirely (well, okay, I renamed it) and rebooted, no change. Clearly not stored in there. Nor in ~/.gconfd.\nBackground: I moved everything to one panel (prefer not having top and bottom), then thought I'd try docking it to the left to see what that was like. What it's like is: Non-functional. When I first log in it shows, but trying to do anything with it makes it disappear. Unfortunately, one of the things that makes it disappear is trying to access the Properties dialog to dock it somewhere else...\n\nUpdate: Okay, this is just weird. First I looked at all files changed under my home directory at about the time I made the change. No luck. So allowing for some poor programming, I've now looked at the name of every file found by the following command issued from the root of my file system:\nfind . -mmin -450 -mmin +240 -type f -not \\( -wholename \"*/home/tjc/.cache*\" -o -wholename \"*/home/tjc/.thumbnails*\" -o -wholename \"*/var/lib/dpkg/info*\" \\) -printf \"%TY-%Tm-%Td %TH:%TM:%TS %p \\n\" | sort > ~/changed\n...which did (when I ran it) encompass the relevant timeframe (and quite a bit on either side), and for any file that looked like it could possibly contain this setting, I've opened that file and looked at it. Not a thing.\nThat leaves us with the absense of a setting defaulting to \"dock left,\" which makes no sense at all.\nI took a backup earlier (because I was going to be doing a lot of things to my system, mostly because I've given up on Unity, which is a great idea and may well get there in the end, but is just way too buggy / feature poor for prime time use yet). If I'd realized it was going to be this hard to undo this stoopid little docking setting, I'd've restored that backup 90 minutes ago. Crazy.\n\nA: Settings for GNOME Panel are stored in dconf, now, and you can access them using dconf-editor under: /org/gnome/gnome-panel.\nStuff in dconf is stored in a binary format, which is why those options didn't show up in a search.\nTo run dconf-editor:\n\n\n*\n\n*First install dconf-tools:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install dconf-tools or click here (apt://dconf-tools).\n\n\n*Then run dconf-editor.\n\n\nScreenshot:\n\n", "Q: No partitions after grub recovery I stupidly inserted the Windows CD into my dual boot Ubuntu 11.10 / Windows XP system.

It had a previous version of Ubuntu on it, but nobody had any passwords for it so I wiped the drive and did a fresh install of 11.10 from scratch. I didn't do any updates during installation, preferring to do them after boot. Updates ran fine and the system works... except Unity is in 2D mode.\nSystem Settings -> Additional Drivers shows that Nvidia-Current is active but not in use.\nSystem Settings -> System Info shows Graphics Driver Unknown, Experience Standard\nNvidia X Server Settings is installed and working, re-writing the xorg.conf did nothing.\n/usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p\n\nOpenGL vendor string:   NVIDIA Corporation\n\nOpenGL renderer string: Quadro FX 2700M/PCI/SSE2\n\nOpenGL version string:  3.3.0 NVIDIA 285.05.09\n\nNot software rendered:    yes\n\nNot blacklisted:          yes\n\nGLX fbconfig:             yes\n\nGLX texture from pixmap:  yes\n\nGL npot or rect textures: yes\n\nGL vertex program:        yes\n\nGL fragment program:      yes\n\nGL vertex buffer object:  yes\n\nGL framebuffer object:    yes\n\nGL version is 1.4+:       yes\n\nUnity 3D supported:       yes\n\nOne suggestion was to do a sudo apt-get --purge remove nvidia* and that resulted in a scrambled screen on boot and a non-bootable installation. Pressing the Delete key on boot allowed me to access the recovery console and do a sudo apt-get install nvidia-current, which brought me back to a working, bootable system.\nAnother suggestion was to edit /etc/default/grub and change the line reading GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\" to read GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash vmalloc=192MB\" thus allocating more video RAM.\nI did that, followed by a sudo update-grub and a re-boot. No change. \nCreated a brand new standard user and logged on with that account, no change.\n\nA: The two things that led me to think I was running 2D instead of 3D were the graphics unknown and the nvidia-current active but not being used.\nHowever now that I see this thread comparing the alt-tab switcher in both systems it seems it actually IS running in 3D mode even though everything is saying it's off.\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=11442860\nWeird.\n", "Q: Is there a command that frees up RAM? I was wondering if there is a command that frees up cached RAM \nI often have 1GB cached RAM when I only have 1.7GB of RAM, and when I start an application like Minecraft (uses a lot of RAM) and the computer starts using 500MB of swap instead and becomes very very slow. \nThat's why I want to free up RAM before I start any games/apps. \n\nA: To free pagecache:\necho 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\n\nTo free dentries and inodes:\necho 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\n\nTo free pagecache, dentries and inodes:\necho 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\n\nuse with root permissions\n\nA: Cached RAM?  Not really, but that's RAM managed by the kernel to cache disk reads, so it shouldn't impact your system's performance, in fact it should help it.  You can change the way the kernel caches things, but I don't think you can explicitly free RAM that's currently used as a page cache.  Generally newer kernels try to use as much free RAM as possible as a cache and free and re-allocate it as you start new processes, so you're generally going to see quite a lot cached.  Why do you want to free it?\n\nA: I have had issues with say my laptop with slowdowns and swap memory being used up at a high percentage, now there is a way to do so in the terminal, and even as a cron-job, i have done the latter for every 15 mins, and it does help, with still an occasional slow down depending on usage of my laptop.

In turn this will eventually call /etc/init.d/sendsigs. So if you start on starting rc then your task will be executed before rc (and the sigterms that would normally have the process shut down).\nfile: /etc/init/test.conf\ndescription \"test script to run at shutdown\"\n\nstart on starting rc\ntask\nexec /etc/init/test.sh\n\nfile: /etc/init/test.sh\ntouch /media/sf_LinuxEducation/start\nsleep 15\ntouch /media/sf_LinuxEducation/start-long\n\n\nA: I think this cannot be done via upstart, as the /etc/init.d/sendsigs script, which is invoked by upstart when halting/restarting, kills all processes (killall5 -9) within 10 seconds, and even if that does not succeed, it goes for unmounting everything and shutdown.\nThe best way would be to use the rusty /etc/init.d style scripts.\nExample: /etc/init.d/shutdown_job\n#! /bin/sh\n### BEGIN INIT INFO\n# Provides:          shutdown_job\n# Required-Start:    \n# Required-Stop:     sendsigs\n# Default-Start:\n# Default-Stop:      0 6\n# Short-Description: bla\n# Description: \n### END INIT INFO\n\nPATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin\n\n. /lib/lsb/init-functions\n\ndo_stop () {\n    date > /root/s.log\n    sleep 20\n    date >> /root/s.log\n}\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n  start)\n    # No-op\n    ;;\n  restart|reload|force-reload)\n    echo \"Error: argument '$1' not supported\" >&2\n    exit 3\n    ;;\n  stop)\n    do_stop\n    ;;\n  *)\n    echo \"Usage: $0 start|stop\" >&2\n    exit 3\n    ;;\nesac\n\n:\n\nThen activate the script\nsudo update-rc.d shutdown_job start 19 0 6 .\n\nThis will put the script before the sendsigs script on runlevels 0 a 6 (shutdown, reboot). This sample script will record the date, then sleep for 20 secs, then record the date again to /root/s.log.)\nMore info:\n\n\n*\n\n*man update-rc.d\n\n*http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-opersys.html#s-sysvinit\n", "Q: connect desktop to laptop using modem ubuntu i have a modem which has lan cable connected to my desktop for internet\nand wifi connection  which i connect to laptop for internet usage\nso now i can i connect laptop and desktop to each other so i can transfer files between them\ni have this modem\nmy modem\nboth desktop and laptop os are ubuntu\n\nA: *\n  \n*Ensure both your desktop and the laptop are on the same subnet.\n  \n*Right-click on a folder and add sharing option.

Is something like this possible in GEdit, since things are starting to get crowded and it would be extremely helpful if that was possible. \nIf not, can someone direct me to a text editor that does have it (i.e. an alternative to Notepad++ which has about the same features) and works in Ubuntu?\n\nA: Try Geany.\nsudo apt-get install geany \n\n\n\nA: In Gedit, no. Gedit uses a different text control which does not support that feature (small as it may be) so you will need to find another editor if you want code folding.\nTry Bluefish, Monodevelop (yes, it uses Mono and I like it!), or Geany.

It looks like we've acquired quite a few new options in desktop files lately. Some of these are explained in very narrow posts, such as how to add a static quicklist to a Unity LauncherEntry.

We seem to have non-standard items in some Gnome applications, for instance, beginning with X-GNOME-\nSo the question is: where can I find information about all of these, including these extensions?

This folder stores information about currently mounted userspace filesystems. If you restore a user's home directory without the .gvfs folder, it will be re-created and repopulated as needed. In fact, the proposed solution in bug 225361 was to put users' .gvfs folders somewhere besides in their home directories (like in /tmp), so they would automatically be skipped over by any operation targeting just the contents of users' home directories.\nYou said that you tried to exclude /home/*/gvfs/* and /home/.../.gvfs. The former would exclude folders called gvfs (instead of .gvfs) in users' home directories. And the latter, assuming you mean it literally, would exclude folders called .gvfs in the directory called ... in /home (which almost certainly doesn't exist since there cannot be a user with username ..., but even if it did, wouldn't solve the problem).\nWhat you want to do is to exclude .gvfs (with the leading .) in each user's home directory. That is represented by: /home/*/.gvfs\n\nA: To preform a complete wubi system backup copy your root.disk file from your ubuntu folder within windows to another location, if something bad happens you just need to replace the current file with the one you backed up and your system will be back to what it was at the time of the backup.\nYou can even mount the root.disk file within Ubuntu if you want to partially restore some files only:\nsudo mkdir /mnt/rootdisk\nsudo mount -o loop <path to share in windows>/root.disk /mnt/rootdisk\n\nWill mount your root.disk to a the path /mnt/rootdisk.\n", "Q: Is there a DocBook reader for following in-progress documents?

Is there an easy way to move a windows from the left to the right monitor. I know I can move applications from one workspace to another using Shift+Alt+Ctrl and Cursor-keys. \nIt would be handy to quickly (using hot-keys?) move especially the maximized windows around without using the mouse since they appear to stick rather strongly to their original monitor and ripping them off with a mouse sometimes requires a few attempts.\n\nA: CCSM answer for 11.04\nOn Ubuntu 11.04, the compizconfig-settings-manager (CCSM) \"Put\" plugin can be used to set a shortcut for moving the active window to the next output or monitor in a multiple monitor system.  In the Bindings tab of the Put module under Window Management, set Ctrl+Alt+z (or other if this does not work) as the shortcut for \"Put to Next Output\"\nIf Compiz sees your setup as a single monitor, use \"Put Within Viewport\" Left/Right instead (forum thread 1588821)\nWarning about CCSM on 11.10\nCCSM is broken on Ubuntu 11.10, in part because it uses gconf2 backend, in part because it disables Unity plugin due to keybinding conflicts with its own plugins.  As a result, the unity launcher disappears. \nTo get the launcher back, remove the ~/.config/compiz-1 directory.   You can obtain a terminal with Ctrl+Alt+F2, or a Nautilus window with Ctrl+N from the desktop (from where you can run /usr/bin/xterm), or Ctrl+Alt+T to launch Terminal.  For ccsm config purge, remove .gconf/apps/compiz-1/ and .gconf/apps/compizconfig-1/ and ~/.compiz-1, and then run unity --reset for unity defaults.\nWay forward: Using dconf and dconf-tools it may be possible to configure a shortcut by directly modifying the config tree.\n\nPostscript by @DrSAR: The CCSM steps did not work for the OP (even though others have benefited from it). This might be related to the problem of compiz seeing only one monitor. \nPS: Use at your own risk since somehow installing and using compizconfig-settings-manager eventually disabled unity for the OP to the point of a seemingly irretrievable launcher and panel.\n\nA: Some days ago the best solution was Extra WM Actions Compiz plugin with its Move window to next output. It worked exceptionally well, much better than Put plugin, which often is unusable (btw. for window alignment one can find useful a Grid plugin).\nHowever the option disappeared some time ago. I'm still on 10.04 LTS at my laptop mostly because of this feature lack under 11.10 and its couple predecessors.\nI know this is a poor answer, but maybe there is a chance to bring back this feature as it had existed before?\n", "Q: How to completely reset/erase the keyring?

The main reason I switched to Ubuntu is because I wanted to use Compiz.\nThe first thing I did was to go to Additional Drivers and install ATI/AMD Proprietary FGRLX Graphics Driver. There was also another one available, ATI/AMD Proprietary FGRLX Graphics Driver (post-release updates), but I didn't install that one, because it basically meant the same thing to me as the one I already installed.\nNext, I went to the ubuntuguide.org Oneiric Wiki \nhttp://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Oneiric#Compiz_Fusion\nSo I followed the instructions there and ran this command in terminal:\nsudo apt-get install compiz compizconfig-settings-manager compiz-fusion-plugins-main compiz-fusion-plugins-extra emerald librsvg2-common\n\nBut then, the terminal window said that the package \"emerald\" could not be found. So, I ran this command instead:\nsudo apt-get install compiz compizconfig-settings-manager compiz-fusion-plugins-main compiz-fusion-plugins-extra \n\nAfter that, I installed Fusion Icon by running this command:\nsudo apt-get install fusion-icon\n\nI restarted my computer, searched for Compiz Config Settings Manager, and clicked on it. Then, I activated Wobbly Windows. I logged off and logged back on again, but there was no wobbly windows effect.\nSo I tried clicking on Fusion Icon, but it never started. Can someone please tell me what I did wrong here? Because I see everyone seems to be able to run Compiz except me. I really need to start Compiz, or else I think I'm going to uninstall Ubuntu.\n\nA: Looks to me like you installed some incorrect packages thanks to a bad guide (it's obviously outdated or poorly done).\nI'll try my best to walk you through how to fix it.\nFusion Icon:\nFirstly, the fusion icon does not work anymore. It is no longer supported in Ubuntu because it does not use an indicator. There is an alternative (Displex) which you can install.\nHowever, this is a third part tool, and if you are using the Unity (3D) Desktop I would not necessarily suggest you use it unless you know what you are doing (you can end up losing your entire Desktop session. Furthermore, the options Displex provides are not that useful in Unity 3D (for the most part).\nThis is not to say that Displex is not useful (it is actually), but in your case I would avoid it (therefore I have not provided a link).\nPackage Names:\nSecondly, the packages you tried to install have been renamed (because Compiz-fusion literally fused back into Compiz). The packages you pulled in are \"dummy-packages\"\nI have listed the plugins you can install (for a stable config) here:\ncompiz-plugins-extra - Collection of extra plugins from OpenCompositing for Compiz\ncompiz-plugins - OpenGL window and compositing manager - plugins\ncompiz-plugins-default - OpenGL window and compositing manager - default plugins\ncompiz-plugins-main - Compiz plugins - main collection\n\nEmerald:\nFinally, Emerald is no longer maintained (really) and it is not recommended on a modern desktop. If you try to run it within Unity it will probably not work.\nTo get a good config going again:\nI would suggest you reset your Compiz configuration to the defaults. To do this, run:\nunity --reset\nin a terminal. This will reset Unity (including any shortcuts you have added to the launcher) as well as Compiz, and should give you a clean slate to work from, without affecting any files, start up programs, etc.\nFrom there, you should be able to customize your Compiz setup with Compiz Config Settings Manager as you like.\nTo start Compiz after this:\nFirst restart your system (if you have not already done so) to ensure that the fglrx driver is loaded (before you attempt to run Compiz). When you log in, You should see something similar to this:\n\nUnity Desktop. Ignore the customization, and the album cover artwork on my Desktop :)\nIf you do not see this, then it means than Compiz is likely crashing. If you get a message saying that you cannot run Unity, then you have an issue with your drivers.\nIf all goes well, open the Dash (using the top-most icon in the launcher) and type \"ccsm\" to get CompizConfig-Settings-Manager, and then click on it's icon. From there customizing Compiz should be a breeze.\nBy the way, please note that you cannot enable the Desktop Cube by default (because of an incompatibility between Unity and the Desktop Cube).

Once the installation is finished, when I reboot, there is ABSOLUTELY nothing on screen, but Ubuntu boot correctly anyway : I choosed auto-login mode and I can hear the login sound. Even if I Ctrl+Alt+F1 or F2... there is nothing. But the livecd works fine (even touch screen even if without multi touch). I tried to install 10.10 it works, but as soon as I upgrade the same problem occure. i installed Fedora 15 and then Fedora 16 (because of other problems) and no problems with them.\nI would like to report this bug on launchpad but I don't know how to do to give devs logs files and other useful files which could help debug.\nThanks a lot for your answer, I would really prefer using my tablet with Ubuntu (I miss U1, USC, Unity)\n\nBug reported here : https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-friendly/+bug/889459 Do you know if this is the good place, and what is needed more ?\n\nA: Looks like Ubuntu 11.04 and 11.10 have problems with your display.  Now that you can boot with live CD, I suggest that once your tablet is up with the live CD, you mount your system and chroot into it:\n$ umount /dev/sda1 # suppose it's your hard disk with Ubuntu on it, \n                   # and the mount point is / (root)\n$ mkdir /mnt/system\n$ mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/system  # if you have other mount points such as /usr, /bin\n                               # you have to mount them under /mnt/system/usr, etc\n$ chroot /mnt/system\n\nFrom here on, it's like you are on the shell of your tablet itself, instead of on the live CD.  You can install openssh on your tablet then:\n$ apt-get install ssh\n\nand find out the IP address of your tablet:\n$ /sbin/ip -f inet addr\n\nthen, reboot the tablet from its own hard disk, from another computer in the same network, you can use ssh to log into your tablet once it is up, and check the error logs and dmesg, etc., as the IP address should be the same.\nHowever, if the IP address do change between you shutting down your tablet and restarting it, you need to set a static IP address to your tablet.  Please see this page on how to do it, and make sure you do it after you chroot into your tablet.\n\nA: I have the same tablet. Here's what I've done:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you dont have grub press SHIFT or ESC at booting. \n\n*Change the grub seetings to always show and to 640x480. \n\n*Then dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg-video-intel in ubuntu recovery root console\n\n*I can't get the keyboard to work, and that would be the last thing (it's a bluetooth keyboard)\nI'm using Edubuntu 12.10\n", "Q: Problem with all fn Keys for Thinkpad W520 I have a problem with the fn.

Somewhere along the upgrade path, Unity has developed some strange logic behind window layering.  First, before Oneiric, there was a way to see all the windows of an application - I think it was when you click on the icon in the launcher.  Now, clicking on the icon often does nothing.  Suppose I have two terminals open, one behind this Firefox window, and one in front of it.  Clicking on the launcher does nothing - the only way to find the second terminal, afaics, is to move the Firefox window or use the task switcher.\nSecondly, once I have both terminals on top, then I decide to close one of them, suddenly they both disappear (the second one, for some reason, has gone into hiding behind the Firefox window).\nThird (though I can't pin it down now), sometimes when a window is on top, focus is still on a window in back; I click on the top x to close the window in front, only to find I've closed an important window in the back. (Update: this question details the problem)\nI can't really believe these are bugs, since they seem too obvious to not have been fixed by now.  My question is, am I missing something?  Some compiz option I can set to make it act like it used to?  Or is this really how Unity is supposed to act?\n\nA: Application in the front does not have the focus: \nyou might want to look into these questions and bug reports: \n\n\n*\n\n*Window focus confusion in unity\n\n*How do I set focus follows mouse?\n\n*Switching to application with multiple windows alternates the target windows\nSee all the windows of one application:\nI'm not sure what exactly you want. To see all windows of e.g. the terminal, I can click on the launcher icon twice. This results in this image:\n\nThere is also the application switcher (Alt+TAB) where you can use the arrow keys to show all the windows of one application:\n\nAll windows of one application disappear when one of them is closed\nThis seems to be the default behaviour when you first have the focus on application A, then click in the launcher on application B with windows B1, and B2. Then both B1 and B2 come to the front, but only one of them gets the focus. If this window is closed, the focus goes to the application which had the last focus, in this case A, which then comes to the front.\nI do not know how this could be changed.\n", "Q: Format option not available in 11.10 as in 10.10?

I have an acer aspire 5552 laptop, AMD x3 processor with ATI 4250 graphics.\nI just want a stable computer!\nI use ubuntu to watch movies, encode films, listen to music.\nHope you can advise me!\nKind regards\n\nA: Unfortunately, I have just recently realised after some testing, that if you have an ATI card, you will either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the open source drivers and have almost everything work great (HD movies, Gnome Shell work like a charm on my HD6890) except gaming (most games I tried never started at all including Trine, Savage 2, Regnum Online)\n\n*Use the proprietary drivers (they're up to ver. 11.11 now) and get all games working great but lose overall smoothness and enjoy choppy HD video playback.\n\n\nI chose in the end not to game, and hope that AMD gets their act together or I'm selling my card and getting an Nvidia one.\n\nA: I own a laptop with similar hardware (Mobility Radeon HD 4250 IGP), and I strongly recommend using the open source drivers.  They provide 2d and 3d acceleration, they support live configuration for external monitors (important if you use your laptop for presentations), and in my experience they are far, far more stable than the fglrx drivers.\nFglrx is really only useful these days if you have bleeding-edge hardware, or you are doing 3D gaming.  With a 4250 I suspect neither of those applies to you.\n\nA: The HD4250 should have good 2d and 3d acceleration using the open source drivers.\nTake a look here Radeon HD drivers on Ubuntu\nThere are some interesting articles on the subject on the Phoronics website. \n\nA: I have an HP DV7 Notebook with HP w2207 external monitor hooked up via standard video (DB9?) connector.  I couldn't get the notebook screen and monitor to work independently (non mirrored) with the w2207 in higher resolution until I installed the following driver, and even then had to keep changing the settings, in the Catalyst Control Center (administrative), and rebooting... many attempts before the changes stuck and everything worked.\nDownload page: ATI Catalyst™ Proprietary Display Driver - Linux x86 & Linux x86_64\nDownloaded file: AMD Catalyst™ 11.11 Proprietary Linux x86 Display Driver\n", "Q: How to change sound driver? (pulse -> oss) I think Ubuntu is set by default to use pulse audio driver. How do I change to OSS? Some softwares that I am using only allow this type of sound driver to use corectly the sound system. Thank you for any advice.\n\nA: Ubuntu has deprecated OSS support - the kernel no longer supports OSS devices.\n\nIf you're considering using OSS4, you should probably use another\n  Linux distro like Arch Linux\n\nFor legacy apps that insist on using a OSS device, you should look at using padsp which is the pulseaudio wrapper for OSS: \nIf application foo needs to use OSS devices, simply run: padsp foo. \nIt will emulate /dev/dsp and related devices, and redirect data between foo and these devices to PulseAudio.\n", "Q: Does installing multiple desktop environments affect performance? I love having multiple DEs on my linux laptop... I currently have Unity, Gnome3, gnome classic and Openbox. Would this mean slower performances?\nThanks a bunch!\nAlex\n\nA: No, installing and keeping different DE's does not mean slower performance. But when you are on a DE, you can try to avoid using an application which loads the other DE's modules, libraries etc.\n\nA: Using multiple DE might affect the stability of the OS because some of the DE come with its own dependencies. I use unity, Gnome, gnome classic, gnome metacity, gnome compiz and cairo dock but on start up i choose a specific environment i want to use and use it rather than mixing them up.  \n", "Q: How to make terminal transparent while still having its own background image? Is there a way to give terminal specific background image and make it 50% transparent at the same time?\n\nA: Assuming you are asking about Gnome Terminal, select your background image and adjust below transparency slider - it's in same tab in same preferences dialog\n\n\nA: The options for gnome terminal do not allow you to set a transparency mask for a background image.\nYou can either choose from a solid color background, a background image where you can set the opacity shade of that image or transparent background where you can set the level of transparency for the terminal's selected background color.\nIf you select a image as a background you wont be able to see tru that image.\nWhat you can do is create an image in a format that allows transparency (ie png) and set that image as your background for the terminal.\n\nStep by step\nI have started with this image called ubuntu-backgrounds7.jpg\n\nI have open it with Gimp and set the transparency of it to 75% and saved it as ubuntu-backgrounds7.png in a folder inside my home.\nI then go to Edit > Profile Preferences > Background and set the image I have just created as the selected background for my terminal.\n\nYou can then adjust the opacity for the background with the slider to get the desired shade on your background.\n\n", "Q: I reformatted my computer to a new OS - need to restore files and folders I did see on another question that files and folder will automatically start synching.

Then create a root \"/\" partition, this should be around 20Gb, set a swap partition the rule of thumb here is 2x memory size, though you can make it bigger if you want.\nThen create a new partition from the rest of the space and assign it to \"/home\" If this is the first install then you will need to format this.\nWhen you reinstall then go through the same procedure, but this time the partitions will already exist, so you only need to set the partition root, \"/\" swap, and \"/home\" set the format partition option on the \"/\" but NOT on the \"/home\" partition.\nThis will then wipe the \"/\" directory but not the \"/home\". After the install program you will have all the system files in \"/\". Files in \"/home\" will still be there but the installer may have changed some \".\" files in here because of changes settings etc. \nIt can be useful to delete some or all of the \".\" files before doing this if you want the appearance to be at the default after the install. \n", "Q: Gnome-Shell panel disappeared - How to get it back?

So out.tar.bz2 gets rewritten at every pass.\nIt may not be noticed with a few dozen test files, but a few hundred will trigger the bug for sure. So the command needs to be rewritten as follows:\n$ find . \\( -name \"*.jpg\" -o -name \"*.bmp\" \\) -and \\( -size +6k -and -size -46k \\) -and \\( \\( -newermt \"2011-06-11\" -and ! -newermt \"2011-06-20\" \\) -or \\( -newermt \"2011-07-24\" -and ! -newermt \"2011-08-03\" \\) \\) -print0 | tar cjf out.tar.bz2 --null --files-from=-\nThe main difference is the absence of xargs and using the --null option for tar. This option will tell tar to read null terminated filenames (as produced by the find commands -print0 option). The whole reason behind these null terminated filenames are to avoid filenames containing special characters (eg. whitespace), that would otherwise break the tar command.\nAnother possible bug to point out is the date range specification. The upper end of date range should be increased by 1 day (otherwise files modified on that day will be omitted).\n", "Q: What is UEFI and Secure Boot? How do they affect Ubuntu? Discussions and reports about UEFI and Secure Boot has cropped up in many Linux circles, but can anyone summarize it's impacts on Ubuntu and how it affects the general users?\nI know that UEFI and Secure Boot are separate (not interchangeable), with Secure Boot being a part of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface BIOS specification.\nPS I do know how it affects Ubuntu, this question is for the benefit of public knowledge.\n\nA: There was a plenary talk about that during UDS by Jeremy Kerr. The presentation was based on a document that he has been co-authored with Matthew Garrett and James Bottomley. You can find that document here.\nMy two cents are that it's a system to verify that the software you're using to boot your machine has been signed by using an authorized signature available in an internal database. This isn't dangerous as long as there is a way for you to edit the database of valid signatures. However, a big industry player seems to want OEMs to include only one  signature in the database and no way to update it and that's the big problem since no other OS would be able to boot in a hardware in which those restrictions have been applied.\n\nA: To really understand how it affects users and Ubuntu, I think it's helpful to understand what UEFI is and what it changes.  Then discuss the features of secure boot, and how it may affect installs:\nUEFI is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and firmware\nIt is designed to replace the BIOS.  The BIOS is old, and it was designed for older hardware.  It can only support a 16 bit processor mode, only 1MB Addressable space, only boot maximum of 2TiB drive, 4 Partitions, etc.  DOS and older OS's used to rely on the BIOS for basic I/O... but the boot loaders importance once an OS is running is greatly reduced today.  Realize many people will still refer to UEFI as the BIOS.\nSome major changes with UEFI are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Processor independent architecture and drivers\n\n*Network capability before the OS loads.\n\n*Since UEFI can be 64 bit it allows it to read all memory which can be\naddressed by a 64 bit computer\n\n*a GUID Partition Table instead of a MBR which allows more than 4\npartitions and over 2TiB from a boot drive (8ZiB)\n\n*provides runtime options for the OS such as getting date/time/NVRAM\naccess\nUEFI allows for SECUREBOOT:\nSecure Boot stops drivers and OS loaders from being loaded by the firmware unless they are signed with a digital signature written to the firmware.  This can be very useful for stopping rootkits.  You can add more keys to allow other software to run in \"Custom\" mode.  \nThat being said, you can read lots of limitations about Secure Boot, how it can be used to allow one OS to dominate a system, etc. Because of this Windows 8 required SecureBoot to be able to enter custom mode or be disabled to be Windows 8 certified.  With it disabled, you lose all the benefits of secure-boot but you can still use UEFI.  With it in Custom Mode you can add public keys which do not match the private key in the system so that other software can run besides just those with the private key\nFor Ubuntu\nWhen you install Ubuntu, if your system is set to boot in UEFI, it will install as an EFI.  \nAs of Ubuntu 12.10 it has supported Secure Boot\nIf you are adding Ubuntu as a 2nd OS it's important to have the same type of OS as your boot loader (ie. 64 bit or 32 bit). So if you have a 64 bit Windows and you boot UEFI you should choose 64 bit Ubuntu.  If you do not, it will not load.  I tried to boot UEFI with a 32 bit Ubuntu (13.10) and couldn't even get it to read the USB until I disabled UEFI.  I installed the 32 bit version with it disabled.  When I realized my mistake, I reloaded the 64 bit Ubuntu to the key, enabled UEFI and it detected it great.  I then reinstalled.\nUsing UEFI allows you to have lots of primary partitions when you install, so don't worry about guides that make you start using logical after you have 4 partitions.\nEverything isn't perfect yet.  For example, GRUB has an issue booting Windows 8 with secure boot.  I can choose to boot from the Windows drive first, it works fine.  I can load GRUB first and boot Ubuntu under secure boot just fine.  But when GRUB loads, it will not load Windows 8 with secure boot.  Here is a good site about this issue, and at the bottom is the bug report which is confirmed: http://falstaff.agner.ch/2012/12/18/ubuntu-12-10-and-windows-8-with-secure-boot-mode/\n", "Q: Unable to update packages?

I am not sure this is a real question or a bug I should report Ubuntu.\nUsing: Ubuntu 11.10, on a Intel Q6600, Samsung Spinpoint F4 2TB.\nI have set my PC on Suspend and after I came back, pressed Enter and after logging in everything was back to normal. However, I had a message from Disk Utility that one disk reports errors. I entered Disk Utility, and my Samsung 2TB disk, the one on which my Ubuntu is installed, had the SMART Status turned red, with error message on it. The error was:\nSpinup time failed Value 21, Threshold value was 25 (so the error was reported because 21 < 25)\nI restarted and booted up in Windows to see what HD Tune is reporting. Unfortunately it was exactly the same 21/25. \nAfter reading up on Wiki about SMART and the errors, I discovered that Spinup time is the time required for the disk to reach full spinning speed in milliseconds. \nThen it hit me that, in Ubuntu I had Suspended the system, making essentially all my hardware stop. And when I rebooted to Windows, the hardware doesn't really stop, so SMART's reading of the Spinup time was still from Ubuntu's suspension. So I did a full PC stop and then booted up again, both in Ubuntu and Windows to see if there are different readings. Both reported successful Spinup time, 68 (a little better then 21 :) ), although in Disk Utility I have a nice message: Failed in the Past\nSo now I am pretty sure that Ubuntu didn't handle the Suspend correctly, but then again should I worry about Imminent hardware failure ? Am I missing some drivers? Should I report this as a bug to Ubuntu?\nSorry if this was a bad place to ask this question.\n\nA: These gui tools are neat and all but the only thing that really\nmatters is what the output of the short/extended run tests from the smart tests\nsay. To put it into perspective, a SATA disk from cold plug takes about\n14-20 secs to become available, including spinup. I bet that parameter\nmeasures the time it takes for the platter to reach a minimum speed so\nspinup can start. Like you said, an additional 4ms slow down was detected,\nthat's not earth shattering.\nRun the self-tests and see what they say.\nsudo -s\napt-get install libatasmart-bin\nsktest /dev/sdX short\nwatch -d 'skdump /dev/sdX | head -n 20'\n\nWhen it's 100% just run skdump again without the stdout throttling.\nThen do the same thing with the extended test when the short one finishes,\nthat one takes a while.\nI'm not a huge fan of these gui tools, they don't have any heuristics\nso all the user sees is \"failure\" with no context of severity.\nFor reference: Wikipedia S.M.A.R.T. entry\n03      0x03    Spin-Up Time    \nAverage time of spindle spin up (from zero RPM to fully operational [millisecs]).\n\n\nA: 2018 here and I'm still rocking a bunch of these Korean-made Samsung HD204UI 2TB drives, one of the finest drives ever made IMHO.

How do you use terminal to enable Universe source?\nOr any those 4 from Software Sources: Main, Universe, Restricted, Multiverse\nMain is on by default and Restricted is on if durring Ubuntu installation i tick Enable Restricted Formats.\nAnswer with line where version checked so it auto detects it.\nLike command I know for partner but that goes to Other Software tab sudo add-apt-repository \"deb http://archive.canonical.com/ $(lsb_release -sc) partner\"\n\nA: Universe is enabled by default so you usually don't need to do this. You could edit the sources file from the terminal:\nsudoedit /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nAnd then uncomment the universe sections of the following lines: \n#deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise universe\n#deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-updates universe\n\nThe Ubuntu help page may be of use. And if you want to enable it via the GUI:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I enable the \"Universe\" repository?\n\nA: I finally found answer myself.\nTo put all ubuntu sources to work without clicking them just enter in terminal\nsudo add-apt-repository \"deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main universe restricted multiverse\"\n\nSo for just \"Universe\" would be\nsudo add-apt-repository \"deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) universe\"\n\nYou can then check in Software sources it will show it works now.\nYou can delete manually from sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list line http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu lucid main universe restricted multiverse and save and see in Software sources nothing is ticked. Then do\n sudo add-apt-repository \"deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) universe\"\n\n& that makes Just universe ticked.\nFor all enabled do \nsudo add-apt-repository \"deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main universe restricted multiverse\"\n\nyou can add also partner repository with different link (see difference is ubuntu to canonical)\nsudo add-apt-repository \"deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) partner\"\n\n$(lsb_release -sc) makes checking your Ubuntu version and putting its name in link. Since 10.04 is called lucid then you can test in terminal lsb_release -sc gives word lucid Thats makes added repository link precise name of your ubuntu Release in Software sources. Wrong word and noting will work.\nfor all differences in repositories read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu\n\nA: As of Ubuntu 12.10, you can run:\nsudo add-apt-repository universe\n\nWhich is easier than running sed over sources.list files, and will take into account which of -updates/-proposed/-backports is enabled.\nYou can go back with the --remove flag, but you'll still have to remove the packages:\nsudo aptitude purge '~i ~s universe/'\n\n", "Q: Disable auto-open for a specific device Whenever I insert a flash drive, a new Nautilus window opens showing its contents.

Then select Edit Mount Options... and set there whatever you want. I suppose you are looking for disabling the Mount at startup option (which is a default on Ubuntu 16.04, but still e.g. not on CentOS 7).\nAfter clicking OK you'll be prompted for sudo password and the results will get written into /etc/fstab where you can see what actually happened.\n", "Q: How to add text and blank line at the beginning of every file in a given directory? How do I add a new line at the beginning of every file in /home/johnny containing the text \"Hello\", followed by a blank line? Also, I have to delete every useless space or tab at the ending of every line(if a line contains only spaces or tabs, they will be deleted, but the line must be kept).\n\nA: Try the following (started in /home/johnny/):\nfor f in * ; do  awk 'BEGIN {print \"Hello\\n\";} {gsub(\"([ \\t]+)$\", \"\"); print $0; }' \"$f\" >\"$f.2\"; done\nIt creates .2 files in the same directory. These files contain the modifications.\nThe for statement lists all files in the directory. If you'd like to process only text files, you could use *.txt instead of *.\nThe awk performs 2 tasks:\n\n\n*\n\n*Prepends each file with \"Hello\" and the blank line.\n\n*Removes spaces and tab characters from the end of each line.\n\n\nThe results are displayed on the standard output.\nFinally a simple redirection creates the .2 files from the processed standard output.\nIt works on files with spaces in their names, because $f is quoted.\nIf you do not want to keep the original files, modify the command as follows:\nfor f in * ; do  awk 'BEGIN {print \"Hello\\n\";} {gsub(\"([ \\t]+)$\", \"\"); print $0; }' \"$f\" >\"$f.2\"; mv \"$f.2\" \"$f\"; done\nThe main addition is a move command that replaces the original files with the modified version.\n", "Q: Installation doesn't detect existing partitions I am trying to install Ubuntu 11.10 in a dual boot with my existing Windows 7 but the installer does not detect any existing partitions.\nI have tried resetting my BCD using EasyBCD and doing fixmbr from the Windows startup disc.

Before that update, I install Ubuntu 11.04 Natty Narwhal and flickering and tearing occurs everywhere. So I reinstalled Windows and flashed the BIOS and installed Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot. The flickering was gone for some weird reason... Before that, I upgraded from an Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick Meerkat to Ubuntu 11.04 Natty Narwhal and the flickering was also gone.

Just out of curiosity.\n\nA: Probably not, looks more like an Intel drivers thing. 11.04 needed a PPA to have good drivers working, 11.10 already has those drivers without need to get them from a PPA. Probably that PPA was used when you upgraded from 10.10 to 11.04 before and the packages were updated.\nIt was very likely a driver thing and not the BIOS update.\n", "Q: Problem connecting to Webmin I have installed Webmin with the view to try an understand what is all running.\nYesterday I had it setup with login and password, but today when I try to get access to the server with:\nhttps://ubuntu:10000/ in order to login, I get unable to connect, the page does not load.

After this webmin will start with your computer.\nTo avoid all these small things you can also download webmin as a debian package that you can install in your system.\nFist you need to remove the current webmin tar install\n/etc/webmin/uninstall.sh\n\nThen install all webmin dependencies\nsudo apt-get install perl libnet-ssleay-perl openssl libauthen-pam-perl libpam-runtime libio-pty-perl apt-show-versions python\n\nDownload the latest deb file from here or use this command to download the current latest version (up to this date)\nwget http://dfn.dl.sourceforge.net/project/webadmin/webmin/1.570/webmin_1.570_all.deb\n\nAfter downloading the file you can install it with\nsudo dpkg -i webmin_1.570_all.deb\n\nwebmin will install, configure all necessary scripts and be ready for you in https://localhost:10000 all the time so you can login with your username / password.\n\nA: I know this is an old thread, but nonetheless I had a similar problem and my solution was to ensure port 10000 was accepting connection. So if you are having a similar problem, you may want to try this. Connect to your server through SSH and execute the following command:\nsudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -d 0/0 -s 0/0 --dport 10000 -j ACCEPT\n\nFor me it worked instantly. Good luck.\nEdit:\nForgot to mention, you should save your iptables after adding your new rule, this can be done by running sudo service iptables save on your command line. Otherwise on server reboot, any changes done in your iptables will be lost. If that doesn't work, you can try sudo /sbin/service iptables save.\n\nA: Try changing the port and listen in \\etc\\webmin\\miniserv.conf\nexample:\nport=1000\nlisten=1000\n\nThen restart webmin:\n/etc/init.d/webmin restart\n\nNow use:\nhttps://iporhost:1000/\n\n\nA: mine did this same exact thing after a reboot and i was able to access it by using the domain name of my modem/router  (ex. https://myservername.routername.com:10000)\n", "Q: Can I set different backgrounds for different workspaces (tags) in Awesome WM? I'd love to be able to set different backgrounds for different tabs in Awesome WM. Is there a way to do this? \n\nA: You can add some code in your ~/.config/awesome/rc.lua file that will change the desktop wallpaper whenever you change tags.  Technically, it will set the wallpaper to the tag you most recently selected (in awesome, you can have multiple tags selected at the same time).\nIf you don't have that file already, then copy the system-wide awesome config file into that location:\n$ mkdir -p ~/.config/awesome\n$ cp /etc/xdg/awesome/rc.lua ~/.config/awesome\n\nIn my rc.lua in Ubuntu 11.10, there is a section where the tags get created that is labeled like this:\n-- {{{ Tags\n-- {{{ Define a tag table which hold all screen tags.\n[... code that creates default tags ...]\n-- }}}\n\nAfter that section, I added the following code:\n-- {{{ Tag Wallpapers\nfor s = 1, screen.count() do\n    for t = 1, 9 do\n        tags[s][t]:add_signal(\"property::selected\", function (tag)\n            if not tag.selected then return end\n            wallpaper_cmd = \"awsetbg /home/user/Pictures/wallpaper\" .. t .. \".png\"\n            awful.util.spawn(wallpaper_cmd)\n        end)\n    end\nend\n-- }}}\n\nReplace \"/home/user/Pictures\" with the location you want to store your wallpapers.  It will use the file \"wallpaper1.png\" for the 1st tag, \"wallpaper2.png\" for the 2nd, etc.  Note that this assumes that you have 9 tags.  If you have a different number, adjust the inner for loop.\n\nawsetbg requires that you have some program installed capable of changing the wallpaper.  For example, the 'feh' or 'imagemagick' packages.  You can find a list of the supported programs in the awsetbg script (/usr/bin/awsetbg):\nwpsetters=\"${wpsetters:=Esetroot habak feh hsetroot chbg fvwm-root imlibsetroot display qiv xv xsri xli xsetbg wmsetbg xsetroot}\"\n\nThe only one my Ubuntu had installed by default was xsetroot, but I believe that program only supports bitmap images.  I have imagemagick installed (provides the 'display' command), so that can handle most any format you can imagine.  ;)\n\nIf you are using a gnome/awesome hybrid desktop (using gnome with awesome as the window manager) and haven't disabled nautilus's desktop management, you may have to use the gnome method of setting the wallpaper instead of awsetbg.  This is because nautilus manages the desktop and may override your settings.  For 11.10, you would change the awsetbg command to:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri file:///home/user/Pictures/wallpaper1.png\n\ngsettings is the new way, for older Ubuntu versions (not sure exactly how long ago it changed), you should use gconftool-2:\ngconftool-2 --set /desktop/gnome/background/picture_filename --type string file:///home/user/Pictures/wallpaper1.png\n\n", "Q: Recover data from partition overwritten by swap partition I've just reinstalled Ubuntu, and I chose a partition full of data as a swap area. I didn't realize that the swap area would overwrite my files.\nCan I recover my partition or my data now?\n\nA: What you could do, is take a dd image of your swap, bit by bit:\ndd if=/your/swap of=/path/to/file.dd\n\n\"Your swap\" is usually a separate partition. To find out which one do:\nfdisk -l\n\nonce you obtain the .dd file, install autopsy:\n apt-get install autopsy\n\nrun it as root in your terminal, and open a browser as instructed.\nCreate a case in autopsy, and try recovering data in this way.\nIt may be complicated, but first secure the .dd file, then try forensic techniques recovering files. You may want to read up on autopsy as a forensic tool for data recovery.\n", "Q: How to set CLI flags for Google Chrome? Where can I set CLI flags for Google Chrome on Unity?\n\nA: Look in /opt/google/chrome/google-chrome.desktop or /usr/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop for the following line:\nExec=/opt/google/chrome/google-chrome %U\n\nAdd the flag you need in there, save it, then run Chrome again and pin it to your launcher, that should do the trick.\n\nA: A way is to set flags in the environment variable CHROMIUM_USER_FLAGS:\nexport CHROMIUM_USER_FLAGS=\"insert_content_here\"\n\n\nA: For xubuntu/xfce4, though it might work similarly elsewhere:\ncp /usr/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop\n\nand modify the three Exec= lines in ~/.local/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop to include the arguments you want.  Because it has the same filename, xfce4-whiskermenu will pick up only your modified google-chrome.desktop.\nIf Chrome is your default browser, another application opening a URL will still cause Chrome to launch without your arguments.  To fix this, create a new file ~/bin/google-chrome with these contents:\n/usr/bin/google-chrome YOUR_EXTRA_ARGS \"$@\"\n\nand chmod +x ~/bin/google-chrome.  Then, in Preferred Applications, set your Web Browser to Other... and enter:\n/home/YOUR_USERNAME/bin/google-chrome \"%s\"\n\nAlso, to avoid having to change the arguments in four places in the future, you can point the Exec= lines in google-chrome.desktop to your /home/YOUR_USERNAME/bin/google-chrome.\n\nA: I'm running Xubuntu and I was trying to figure this one out as well. I tried the solution to edit the .desktop file. I haven't updated, but I have the same concern as you (will it get overwritten). I tried a different option where I added an alias to my .bashrc file.\nalias chromium-browser=\"/usr/bin/chromium-browser [FLAGS]\"\n\n\nA: For chromium, you can create a script in /etc/chromium-browser/customizations\nFor instance i have a script with one line\nCHROMIUM_FLAGS=\"${CHROMIUM_FLAGS} --enable_hidpi=1 --process-per-site\"\n\nI imagine chrome has something similar.\n\nA: For Chromium, the method suggested by @errr is correct, however, it is deprecated as of Chromium 52 (or earlier):\n┌ alex [~]\n└──> export CHROMIUM_USER_FLAGS=\"--version\"\n┌ alex [~]\n└──> chromium-browser\nUsing PPAPI flash.\nWARNING: $CHROMIUM_USER_FLAGS is deprecated.

What an embarrassment!\n", "Q: How can I make SWF files be opened with the standalone player? I have installed the standalone Flash debug player to /usr/lib/flashplayerdebugger and I can now use it to test within Flash Builder (Eclipse), but I can't make an SWF open with it from Nautilus.  If I right click and select Open With Other Application it is not in the list of programs, and I can't see how to add it.  How can I make it the default application for SWF files opened in Nautilus?\nUpdate - *.desktop file\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Flash Player Debuger\nType=Application\nExec=/usr/lib/flashplayerdebugger\nCategories=GNOME;Player;AudioVideo;\nMimeType=application/x-shockwave-flash;\n\n\nA: Well, I hadn't noticed this myself. In the previous Ubuntu version, you were able to specify as a command an application you wanted to open a specific file-type  with in the Properties > Open With window, but now that doesn't seem possible. You might as well file a bug report for this - it is a very important function that got lost.\nI can think of a couple of workarounds though.\n1. Desktop file approach\nThis is one \"hacker\" way of doing it. In order to start, you must first find out the mimetype name of the SWF file:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Right-click the file and open Properties and stay in the Basic tab. Look for the line that says Type and write down somewhere the last part of that line that is between parenthesis. It should be named something like application/swf-flash or something in that fashion.\n\n*Now you must create (unless it already exists, in which case you would edit) a *.desktop file in one of the working applications directories mentioned below:\n\n\n*\n\n*/usr/share/applications/\n\n*/usr/local/share/applications\n\n*~/.local/share/applications [recommended] \n\n\nand in the MimeType field include the mimetype you found in the previous step. To do this, simply create new line and write the following:\nMimeType=application/swf-flash;\n\nif you are editing an existing desktop file, append the mimetype you found and a semicolon to the line:\nMimeType=mimetype1;mimetype2;application/swf-flash;\n\nThis is a working desktop file that I have come up with while you read:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Flash Player Debuger\nType=Application\nExec=/usr/lib/flashplayerdebugger\nCategories=GNOME;Player;AudioVideo;\nMimeType=application/swf-flash;\n\nRemember to change application/swf-flash for the working mimetype!\nOnce completed this step, the application you created a *.desktop file for should appear in within the other applications in the Open With tab in the Properties window of any SWF file.\n2. Assogiate application\nI don't know if this method still works, but I remember an application called assogiate which would let you change all the file associations made by the system among other things. You might want to install this, its in the Software Center.\n\nA: I looked at the gnash swf players .desktop file, it has a %U at the end of the exec line, added that and it is now visable as a default application.\n", "Q: Upgrading Libreoffice 3.4.3 to 3.4.4 I have LibreOffice 3.4.3 (Build:302) installed on my Ubuntu 11.04 machine as shown below.

Maybe something (TrueCrypt?) where I enter the password before the system boots so that it decrypts the whole hdd? Or maybe individual encryption using Windows-only encryption (for Windows partitions) and Ubuntu home encryption (well, for Ubuntu home partition)?\nBy the way, I almost always use Ubuntu, so it would be nice if I could continue to boot Ubuntu by default but have an option to boot Windows too (like in grub).\nEDIT: I was thinking of doing this: encrypting ubuntu home with eCryptfs (I think this is used to encrypt home when selected during installation). Encrypting Windows partitions with TrueCrypt. Still having Grub as a bootloader, when I choose ubuntu everything goes as normal (home is decrypted when login in). When I choose windows the TrueCrypt password prompt shows and windows boots.\n\nA: If you're looking for cross-compatibility between both encrypted systems, I'd recommend using TrueCrypt.\nSince you have a /home partition already, things get a little difficult.\nNOTE: MAKE BACKUPS of all files you modify in case this doesn't go totally as planned.\nRecommended Backups:\ndd if=/dev/sda of=/some/path/mbr.bin bs=512 count=1 #Backs up your Master Boot Record (GRUB2). You should also do this again if you create another partition (once you know it worked correctly).\n#You should back up this file in a place that can be accessible both from Windows and Linux. Ideally a flash-drive or external drive.\n#Your home folder will be safe until the end when you can delete it. After knowing everything works (you make a backup in the process of this guide)\n\nSo, you have Windows and Linux already installed, the first thing you should do it attempt to encrypt your /home partition.\nLinux\nFirstly download and install the appropriate architecture's .deb file from TrueCrypt.org\nNext, you have two choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move all folders from /home back to the root filesystem. It's probably best to move them to /home2 for now.\n\n*Make a partition to house your new, encrypted Linux home folder\n\n\n\nChoice 1:\nFirst, log out and Ctrl+Alt+F1 and login.\ncd /\nsudo umount /home\nrmdir /home\nsudo mv /home2 /home\nexit\n\nCtrl-Alt-F7 to get back to the login screen and log in as usual\nNow assuming all went well, remove /home's line in /etc/fstab and format the partition that used to house your /home folder as a TrueCrypt container:\nhomepartuuid=$(cat /etc/fstab | grep -E \"[^#][ \\t]/home\" | awk '{print $1}' | sed 's/UUID=//')\nhomepart=\"/dev/$(basename $(readlink /dev/disk/by-uuid/$homepartuuid))\"\necho $homepart #just to make sure we got it, if not set it manually\nsudo sed -ri \"s/^(UUID=$homepartuuid)/#\\1/\" /etc/fstab #Comment out /home entry... useful if you screw up and after you re-make the partition.\nsudo truecrypt -c $homepart #If you installed the GUI, you have to use that for the process of creating the encrypted partition\n\nSet options as desired. If you installed the GUI version, the goal is to prompt for a mount password before showing the login screen. I'm not sure how the command-line version will react to this. I would recommend using the keyfiles for the command-line version. Make sure you make it an ext2 paritition and not ext3/ext4, if you want it to be readable by Windows with the ext2fs driver for Windows)\n\nChoice 2:\nIf you've got the extra space, you can take the easy way out and make a new partition to house your encrypted home folder.\n\nUse gparted or a similar tool to make your new partition (from a LiveCD if you have to resize /home or /)\nReboot.\nNow, if you have to use gparted again to find your new partition's device (/dev/sda6, for example). Format the new partition using TrueCrypt. As stated above, I recommend using keyfiles for the command-line version as I don't know if it can prompt for a password. And again, make it ext2 if you want to be able to use it in Windows.\n\nNow, mount the new TrueCrypt partition using the GUI or the command line. There are so many options here I'm going to leave it to you to read the TrueCrypt help.\n\nCopy home files to encrypted volume\ncp -ar /home/[myusername]/* /media/truecrypt1 #Default truecrypt mount point\ncp -ar /home/[myusername]/.??* /media/truecrypt1\n#The only thing potentially missing after this are very rare files that are named .?, where '?' can be any character.\n\nDo not delete the files in /home/[myusername] yet!\nNow, cp /media/truecrypt1/.profile /home/[myusername]. Also, move your keyfile if you used one to here (insecure!) or know where it can be referenced (as long as it's not inside the TrueCrypt partition.\nAdd the following line to the end of /home/[myusername]/.profile:\nsudo truecrypt /dev/sda6 -k /path/to/key/file /home #Where /dev/sda6 is the TrueCrypt partition. Omit the -k option if you didn't specify a keyfile.\n\nAdd this line in /etc/sudoers using visudo:\n[myusername]    ALL    =    (root) NOPASSWD  :  /usr/bin/truecrypt\nNow, log out and log back in.\nJust because you've made it this far doesn't mean anything.\nCheck the output of mount. If there's an entry that says /home/[myusername], then you're all set! Alternatively, you can check the contents of .profile. If the line we added isn't there, then you were successful! \nBut! Just to be absolutely sure, reboot and do it from a fresh boot.\nIf you've made it this far successfully, logout. Ctrl-Alt-F1\ncd /\npulseaudio -k #I had to do this in my test install. Found it via: lsof /home\nsudo umount /home/[myusername]\n\nand delete everything in /home/[myusername] EXCEPT the .profile file. (You might be wondering what's going on right now. If you weren't paying attention, I overlapped the existing /home with a mount, which hides all files that already existed in /home until you unmount the overlaying filesystem. This is why we can check the .profile file to see if we were successful.)\nFinally! Back up your MBR with dd if=/dev/sda of=/path/to/backup/mbr.bin bs=512 count=1. Remember, it must be accessible from both Window and Linux. Run grub-install --force /dev/sda3, where /dev/sda3 is your root filesystem partition.\nIf something's not working correctly, go through the tutorial again and make sure you did every step. If you're having trouble here, you should probably undo everything.\nUndoing choice 1:\n - Re-format the TrueCrypt partition back to what it was (probably ext4)\n - Delete the line from /home/[myusername]/.profile.\n - sudo mkdir /home2;sudo mount /dev/sdaX home2 Where /dev/sdaX is the re-made /home partition\n - sudo cp -aR /home/* /home2\n - Verify your files (especially dot files)\n - sudo umount /home2;sudo rmdir /home2\n - sudo rm -R /home/*\n - Then, uncomment the line in /etc/fstab that starts with\n   #/dev/sdaX.../home\n - sudo mount -a\n - Log out and back in\nUndoing choice 2:\n - Open Gparted and put your partition back the way they were (probably a delete and expand operation.

I am a newcomer to linux and have had lots of problems in installing java on my newly installed Ubuntu 11.10. I use a statistical programming environment called R and many of the packages there require java (the sun variety, I am told). \nI tried the following :\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ferramroberto/java\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre sun-java6-plugin sun-java6-fonts\n\n(after this, I wanted to continue with (but never got that far) :\nsudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk\n\nAfter this, a window appeared with the heading, \"Configuring jre\", or something like that. Below was a long list of legal text about accepting Sun's terms. I did not know how to close this window (no obvious option like pressing return worked). After a long time, when nothing seemed to happen, I finally closed the window. After that, I could not open synaptic. \nI got the error message :\n\ndpkg was interrupted. You must manually run 'sudo dpkg --configure -a'\n\nI did this. But it does not help. I have java as a \"broken\" program.

Actually, I did not do much myself. I just ran the update manager and this solved the problem of the broken installation. New programs were loaded. Halfway through this update, the window with the legal term screen appeared again. This time, I could tick in one of the boxes stating that I accept the terms (there was no such box previously, or at least, I did not locate it). After that, I went back to synaptic, chose the remaining items from the PPA associated with sun jdk6 and installed them. \nThe only remaining steps were to remove the open jdk (from the ubuntu software centre) and then to configure Java as required by R (the statistical programming environment for which I required Java). I did this by running the command : R CMD javareconf. This set up the java configuration in /etc/R.\n\nA: First of all, you should be aware that the ferramroberto/java PPA no longer contains the latest versions of Oracle Java 6 (and probably never will, because Oracle changed the license terms so newer versions may not be distributed that way). Also, Oracle Java 7 is out. So if you want to use the proprietary version of Java (even though OpenJDK is free open source software, works just as well most of the time, and is available through official, automatically-enabled Ubuntu software sources), you're best advised to obtain it from the Oracle website. (See post #13 in this question, and the links therein, for details.)\nWith that said, the problem with bioShark's answer was that apt-get purge only purges files from packages that are being removed, and the commands given did not actually tell the package manager to remove any packages. This command should be sufficient (and you don't need to do apt-get clean, which removes cached .deb packages, not configuration files):\nsudo apt-get purge sun-java6-jre sun-java6-plugin sun-java6-fonts\nThen you should be able to reinstall Java, and you should be prompted to read and sign a license agreement when doing so.\n\nA: Try this:\nsudo apt-get clean && sudo apt-get purge\n\nThis should work if your packages are broken. After that reinstall.\n", "Q: Screen tearing oddity when one window is on top of another with Radeon I have a mobility radeon 5850 running 11.04 and am running catalyst 11.10 drivers.

I installed ati-driver-installer-11-9-x86.x86_64.run downloaded from the ATI Website.\nHowever I installed the generic version instead of building a distribution specific installer.\nNow I have the gnome-shell graphic glitches that are associated with having the old Fglrx drivers installed.\nHow can I remove these drivers?\nThey do not show up in the additional drivers dialog, and I cannot install any other drivers till these are removed.\n\nA: Run both this commands:\nsudo sh /usr/share/ati/fglrx-uninstall.sh \nsudo apt-get remove --purge fglrx fglrx_* fglrx-amdcccle* fglrx-dev*\n\nPlus refer to this site: \n ATI - Ubuntu Oneiric Installation Guide\n\nA: The most thorough removal attempt involves running two commands. However, there are several possible variants of the first command. In general, the two commands look like this (in pseudo code):\nsudo sh /path/to/amd_proprietary_uninstall.sh\nsudo apt-get remove --purge fglrx and related packages\n\nNow let me give the specific actual commands.\nFirst Command:\nHere are all the variants of the first command. Try them in order. When you get one that works, you are done and you can move on to the second command:\nsudo sh /usr/share/ati/ati-uninstall.sh\nsudo sh /usr/share/ati/amd-uninstall.sh\nsudo sh /usr/share/ati/fglrx-uninstall.sh \nsudo aticonfig --uninstall (NOTE: assumes the executable is in the path)\nsudo sh ati-driver-installer-x86.x86_64.run --uninstall \n\nAs you probably see, the first 3 variants just involve changes to the script name that happened over time. You could simply do a listing of /usr/share/ati/ and look for the correct file name rather than trying all 3 of those command variants.\nThe last two variants come from the official Catalyst Linux doc. These involve passing the --uninstall parameter to another script. However, you still need to find the correct name of that script. There could be more variants than shown above, although these are the only two listed in the official Catalyst Linux doc.\nIf you get a response to any of the first command variants above like this:\nfailed: No such file or directory\n\nthen try the next variants. If you exhaust all the variants of the first command without anything executing, consider the job done.\nSecond Command:\nNow, execute the second command. This form should cover all cases (thanks to the use of wildcards):\nsudo apt-get remove --purge fglrx fglrx_* fglrx-amdcccle* fglrx-dev*  \n\nRestore original config\nThe original Xorg configuration file was automatically restored for me by the above steps. However, the official Catalyst Linux doc gives the following manual steps:\n\n*\n\n*Locate backup configuration files: ls /etc/X11/xorg.conf.original-*\n\n*Take the latest version with the highest number and copy it over the existing\nxorg.conf file: cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf.original- /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\nFurthermore, I think it is important to read this link:\nX/Troubleshooting/VideoDriverDetection - Ubuntu Wiki\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Troubleshooting/VideoDriverDetection#Problem:_Need_to_purge_-fglrx\nThis question is about removing fglrx, but you also want to be able to reboot your computer into a working configuration after removing fglrx. The link above gives several steps. I think they are probably too long to paste here since it is not directly related to the question. But I mention it because it is important to reinstall the original drivers. In short, the command will be similar to:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall libgl1-mesa-glx libgl1-mesa-dri xserver-xorg-core\n\nlts hardware enablement stack\nImportant: if you are running the lts hardware enablement stack, things may be a bit more difficult. I found a solution here:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/344625/36661\nIt is in response to this question:\n12.04 - Experiencing major issues on graphic displays - Ask Ubuntu\nExperiencing major issues on graphic displays\nSee the link for full details.\nHere are some related links:\nMicrosoft Word - Catalyst_Linux_Installer.doc - catalyst_linux_installer.pdf\nhttp://www2.ati.com/relnotes/catalyst_linux_installer.pdf\nBinaryDriverHowto/ATI - Community Ubuntu Documentation\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI\n\nA: Removing Catalyst/fglrx\nThe uninstall script in the first command will only exist if you downloaded the drivers and installed them directly (rather than building packages as this guide does). Skip the first command if it does not exist.\nsudo sh /usr/share/ati/fglrx-uninstall.sh\nsudo apt-get remove --purge fglrx fglrx_* fglrx-amdcccle* fglrx-dev*\n\nIf you plan on using open-source drivers, you will need to reinstall some packages because Catalyst overwrites or diverts some key 3D libraries with proprietary versions.

But this happens every time I enter a command that doesn't do anything. \nartur@SERVER:~$ dslkfjdsklfdshjk\n-bash: /usr/bin/python: is a directory\n\nI remember messing with the update-alternatives to point at python at some point, perhaps that could be it?

I've read that could fix the second problem but it hasn't.\n\nA: When you run a command foo (where foo is replaced by whatever command you're running), the shell searches all the directories in the PATH environment variable for a file called foo with execute permissions.\nIf it doesn't find it, then in an Ubuntu system with the default configuration, it runs the command /usr/lib/command-not-found foo. This is done at the /etc/bash.bashrc file.\nThat's what produces output like:\n$ foo\nNo command 'foo' found, did you mean:\n Command 'fio' from package 'fio' (universe)\n Command 'goo' from package 'goo' (universe)\n Command 'fop' from package 'fop' (main)\n Command 'fox' from package 'objcryst-fox' (universe)\n Command 'xoo' from package 'xoo' (universe)\n Command 'zoo' from package 'zoo' (universe)\nfoo: command not found\n\nAnd:\n$ gnuchess\nThe program 'gnuchess' is currently not installed.  You can install it by typing:\nsudo apt-get install gnuchess\n\nThe command-not-found program itself (i.e., /usr/lib/command-not-found) is a Python script:\n$ file /usr/lib/command-not-found\n/usr/lib/command-not-found: a /usr/bin/python script text executable\n\nSo if your Python installation is broken, it is expected that command-not-found will always fail and give an error about Python. You can fix the problem by fixing your Python installation.\nUbuntu comes with Python installed, and requires Python for numerous programs (like the Update Manager and the Software Center, for example). Various different versions of Python are simultaneously available through the official software sources and different versions can be installed simultaneously without conflict. However, it is also possible to install Python manually by building it from source. If you do that, it's up to you to make sure that your manually compiled and installed Python does not conflict with any other installed Python implementations.\nSo the first thing you should do is to uninstall any manually installed Python. When installing it, there is a directory in which you would have run the command sudo make install. You need to go to that directory and run sudo make uninstall.\nAfter you've removed all manual Python installations (if any), then completely reinstall Python:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get --purge --reinstall install python\n\nThat will probably work.

All the credits goes to him.\nI had the same problem. Worked great for me.\n\nA: You can comment out the line for /dev/sdb1 /media/WD in /etc/fstab, and let the drive use dynamic mounting. (That is, edit the file and put a # character at the beginning of the line. Then reboot.) For a drive that is being detached and reattached, that is preferable. Alternatively, you could manually unmount the drive before removing it with umount (as \"Safely Remove...\" is apparently not sufficient).\nWhen using dynamic mounting, you can easily unmount the drive just by clicking the eject icon next to its name in the left pane of any Nautilus (i.e., file browser) window.\nIf you want to stick with static mounting, then remember to unmount the drive before removing it (sudo umount /media/WD).\nIf you need a fix right now without rebooting, try: sudo umount /media/WD, then run sudo fdisk -l or sudo parted -l to find out the current device name of the drive, and assuming it's /dev/sdb1, run sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/WD ...or, run sudo rmdir /media/WD followed (without sudo) by udisks --mount /dev/sdb1.\n\nA: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MountingWindowsPartitions\n", "Q: Need help with exploring a USB drive \nPossible Duplicate:\nVLC is set to open the folders (Home, desktop, documents etc) in the Places menu. How to reset this? \n\nWhen I plug in a USB drive, I see it on the left hand edge of the Unity desktop (11.10, 64 bit) but when I try to explore it, VLC starts and tries to play whatever it can find in the USB drive.  This behavior began when I updated from 11.04 to 11.10.  I literally cannot look into the contents of any of the USB drives I have, because I cannot stop VLC, nor can I do anything when I click Open other than watch VLC start up.  This is very frustrating because it makes my USB sticks essentially useless.\nHELP!\nI'm sure that there is something a wizard could do about this, but I am not a wizard, and I am at my wits ends.  Trying to get to the System Settings menu works, and I can see the setup for \"Removable\" devices, and they are all set to \"Ask\" but that is clearly not what is happening.  So it looks like I must reach for the command line, but where do I go to find the settings for what the desktop does when I plug in a USB drive and wish to explore the file structure in it and possible copy a file into the USB or from the USB drive.  Right now, VLC media player is always getting in my way.  :-(\n\nA: This may sound dumb but have you tried right-clicking on the icon? Otherwise try open homefolder and click on the mounted icon to the left.\n\nHope it helps!\n", "Q: Recovering user files with a Live CD For some reason I can't boot my system. I get an error akin to Operating System Not Found. \nI tried bootrepair, and that didn't work. So then I decided I would just save my personal files, wipe everything, and reinstall. \nBut in the live session, when I go to the /home directory, my username folder isn't there, instead it goes to the Live CD's desktop and other directories. Is there some other error occurring? Is there a way to recover the files?\n\nA: Do you have an encrypted home directory? You'll find a bunch of encrypted files in /home/.ecryptfs/<username>/.Private. See http://www.ubuntugeek.com/recover-your-encrypted-private-directory-using-ecryptfs-recover-private.html \nHow do you \"go to the /home directory?\" With a \"cd\" shell command, by clicking on an icon in Nautilus, or what? \n\nA: Finding the Installed System's Partition(s)\nWhen you're running from the live CD/DVD/USB, /home is the parent of home directories on the live CD system (nothing much interesting there), not the parent of home directories on the installed system.\nYou have to find your hard disk, which is listed on the left side of any file browser window, near the top. Mount that (or if there's more than one volume listed, mount the one for your Ubuntu system, or if you're not sure, mount them all and go through them to see). As Mark Rooney commented, you can just click on it to mount it. Then find the home folder in there.\nThat will probably be sufficient to enable you to copy your files out. Remember that copying them, say, to the desktop of the live CD system would be useless, as they would go away when you reboot. Instead you must:\n\n*\n\n*copy them to an external drive or USB flash drive (but if you're booted from a USB flash drive, not that one, unless it has a persistent area and you really know what you're doing), or\n\n*put them on another machine on the network, or email them to yourself, or otherwise store them on an Internet server (for example, with a service like Ubuntu One), or\n\n*burn them to a CD/DVD.\n\nOvercoming Errors About Insufficient Permissions\nIf you are told that you lack permissions to access any of the files, then you can get around this by using a Nautilus (i.e., file browser) window running as root. To do that, press Alt+F2, type in gksu nautilus (or gksudo nautilus), and press Enter.\nA file browser window run this way pretty much has the power to perform any action, and programs launched from it--for example, by right-clicking on a document in it and clicking to open it--will run as root as well. So you should be careful. And close the root Nautilus window when you're done with it so you don't accidentally use it to break something.\nSome Ubuntu live ISOs don't have the gksu package, which provides the gksu and gksudo commands, installed by default.\n\n*\n\n*You can install it (live environments support nonpersistent software installation).\n\n*But it would probably be easier to use sudo -H nautilus or sudo -i nautilus, which are okay too.\n\nIf Your File Browser Isn't nautilus\nNautilus is called Files (or GNOME Files) in newer versions, but the command to run it is still nautilus. However, if your live CD/DVD/USB system for an Ubuntu flavor that's not GNOME (or Unity) based, the default file browser will be different and will require a different command to run as root.\n\n*\n\n*\"Vanilla\" Ubuntu, Ubuntu Kylin, Edubuntu, and Ubuntu GNOME are all GNOME-based (either GNOME/Unity or GNOME with the GNOME Shell). So they all have Nautilus/Files, and you can go ahead and use gksu nautilus, gksudo nautilus, sudo -H nautilus, or sudo -i nautilus, just as described above.\n\n*Kubuntu is KDE 4 – based. Dolphin is file browser. Unlike the other desktop environments, KDE provides its own way to run graphical programs as root: kdesudo. So use kdesudo dolphin. (sudo -H dolphin or sudo -i dolphin would also work.)\n\n*Xubuntu, Ubuntu Studio, and Mythbuntu are Xfce-based. Thunar is the file browser. You can use gksu thunar, gksudo thunar, sudo -H thunar, or sudo -i thunar.\n\n*Lubuntu is LXDE-based. PCManFM is the file browser. You can use gksu pcmanfm, gksudo pcmanfm, sudo -H pcmanfm, or sudo -i pcmanfm.\n\n*Ubuntu MATE will be MATE-based. Caja is the file browser. You can use gksu caja, gksudo caja, sudo -H caja, or sudo -i caja.\n\n", "Q: How to monitor my wireless network? Does anyone know how to find out who using my network other than me in ubuntu? Because I just want to make my wireless network being use only for the people I approve it? \n\nA: Without knowing anything about your hardware or Ubuntu installation you really do not need any special software to find this out, you should be able to log in to the wireless router using any web browser and see a list of the attached devices.\nThis Lifehacker article has it pretty much covered.\nYou can restrict access to any router by MAC address filtering though a better method is to use a strong password and WPA encryption.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: How to set up an inter-OS partition? I need a working partition configuration for use and accessibility on both Ubuntu and Windows. I have an 8GB USB flash drive onto which I am installing Ubuntu 11.10 so that I can have a personal bootable OS wherever I go. I've installed Ubuntu several times, but I just can't seem to get this one partition right.\nThis is my own configuration:\n\n\n*\n\n*Partition 1: Primary - 200MB  - Beginning - Ext4 - /boot\n\n*Partition 2: Primary - 1300MB - End       - swap area\n\n*Partition 3: Logical - 5200MB - Beginning - Ext4 - /\n\n*Partition 4: Logical - 1258MB - Beginning - Ext4 - /home\n\n*Partition 5: Logical - 42MB   - End       - FAT32? - /windows?\n\n\nWhat I want to do is to get partition 5 configured so I can access it on both the installed Ubuntu system and a Windows system (when the USB drive is connected while Windows is booted).\nBasically, what I want is Ubuntu installed on the USB drive along with a partition that I can access with other operating systems.\nI'm thinking I just need the technical configuration of \"Use as:\" and \"Mount point:\" for my final partition. But I don't know. Any help with this is appreciated. And any other tips are appreciated as well.\n\nA: You might not want to bother creating a separate partition for both Ubuntu and Windows to access, since Ubuntu can (and for years has been able to) safely and effectively read and write NTFS partitions. You could just store shared files in the Windows system.\nHowever, if you want to create a shared partition, then NTFS is a reasonable choice for filesystem type. You could use FAT32, but then you wouldn't be able to store files larger than 4 GiB in size, as well as suffering from numerous other limitations compared to a more modern filesystem.\nYou don't need to specify the partition when you're installing Ubuntu--you can just mount it dynamically when you need it, by clicking on its volume name in the list of mountable volumes in the left pane of any Nautilus (i.e., file browser) window. However, if you want it to be mounted statically, choose whatever mount point you like. Even though /media was originally for removable media, \"new tradition\" has given it the expanded meaning of being the place where any volume that doesn't provide an important system directory (like /boot or /home) gets mounted. So if you wanted you could mount it at /media/windows or /media/name where name is replaced by the actual volume name of the volume in Windows.\n\nA: The 'Use as...' configuration is only relevant for Ubuntu, and is completely irrelevant for Windows. As long as the file system is supported (FAT32, NTFS), Windows shouldn't have any problems accessing it. As for the mount point, /windows in your example above, either leave it blank, or move it into /media, (/media/windows). That's also only relevant for Ubuntu.\nI'd also advise skipping the separate boot and home.\n\nA: Format partition 5 as NFTS (The filesystem Windows uses). I recommend you name it /storage to avoid confusion, but this is not necessary. Once you boot your computer, both Windows and Ubuntu will recognize the partition and you will be able to mount it.\n", "Q: Problem installing 10.04 on Dell e6410 I get a blank screen screen on installation of ubuntu 10.04 on my dell latitude e6410.\nIt has the Nvidia graphics card.

Keep your passwords in a safe place.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Don't think the name of root can be changed.\n\n*In /etc/default/grub, uncomment (remove the '#' symbol) the following line:\n#GRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_RECOVERY=\"true\"\n\n...then run sudo update-grub.\n\nA: Renaming the root account\nNOT RECOMMENDED But if you really want to, use sudo vipw and sudo vipw -s to rename “root” in the /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files respectively. That’s all there is to it; to the kernel, root is any user with UID 0 (at least that’s my novice understanding). Notice that if you do this, sudo -i no longer works, but sudo -u xyz -i does, and still drops you into a root prompt.\nSecuring console access\n\n\n*\n\n*Physically lock the PC case so it can’t be opened.\n\n*Prevent the computer from booting other devices.\nIn the BIOS, edit the boot sequence so that it will only boot the hard drive (and not from CD, USB device, etc.). Then set a BIOS password to prevent someone from editing the boot sequence.\n\n*Disable the recovery mode option in Grub.\nEdit the file /etc/default/grub. Uncomment the line:\n#GRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_RECOVERY=\"true\"\n\n\n*Add a Grub superuser. This has the side-effect of preventing unauthenticated Grub users from editing boot lines (like adding the single parameter to boot into single-user mode and get root).\nFirst, hash the password you want to use for the Grub superuser account:\ngrub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2\n\nThen add the superuser to the Grub config by appending the following lines to /etc/grub.d/00_header (yes, include the cat and EOF lines):\ncat << EOF\nset superusers=[YOUR USERNAME]\npassword_pbkdf2 [YOUR USERNAME] [YOUR grub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.... PASSWORD STRING]\nEOF\n\n(Example taken from http://www.g0hl1n.net/node/16.)\nFinally, run the following to have the Grub configuration changes take effect:\nsudo update-grub2\n\nWhat this does (assuming we have truly secured the BIOS and Grub) is reduce the attack surface to the physical security of the PC (i.e. break the case lock) and the security of Ubuntu when it’s online. The goal is to make it so someone can’t walk up to the PC, reboot it, go into single-user mode, give themselves root access, and then walk away — all in under a minute. Even if you are running full-disk encryption (yet still booting the kernel + initrd off of the PC hard drive), all these steps can still be a good idea, since it is trivial to perform the same attack in order to add a keylogger to the initrd that will sniff the encryption passphrase.\n\nA: Changing the root username is NOT recommended - you are likely to break your install messing around as root.\nFor a definition of root and it's privileges see this article - and the reasons for not changing it are on this Ubuntu Forums Thread.\n", "Q: Degrading administrative privilege to standard with single admin user account I recently met with a severe issue with user accounts. On my system, there is only one administrator user, named vivek. I added another user with name vivi and changed its privilege to administrator. Afterwards, I changed the privilege for the vivek account to standard user. \nSince vivek is being the current user, I dropped with all administrator privileges. No password was set for the new administrator user vivi and hence it was disabled by default. I no longer access to any administrative activities. Later I corrected this by editing etc/group file. \nIsn't this a severe bug? Being the current administrator user, how could I degrade myself to a standard user and got out from administrator's seat? I did not get any warning messages indicating no other administrators exists to manage my system. I suggest this warning should be included there in user accounts when an administrator user changes his privilege without any enabled administrators. Your thoughts?\n\nA: Assuming that the utility you were using prevents you from taking away your administrative privileges (i.e., remove yourself from the admin group) when there are no other administrative users, arguably if it permits you to take away your administrative privileges when all other administrative users' accounts are disabled, that is a bug.\nIf you consider this a bug, I recommend that you report it as one. Please make sure to read the documentation on bug reporting carefully first, and also to search to see if someone else has already reported a similar bug. This would be a bug in the utility you are using to modify user accounts, and what utility that is depends on what version of Ubuntu you are using as well as what desktop environment you are using (for example, Users and Groups (users-admin, which is part of the gnome-system-tools package) stopped being the default utility for this in Ubuntu 11.04, being superseded by the User Accounts control panel in System Settings (a.k.a. GNOME Control Center; gnome-control-center, provided by the package of the same name). But in Ubuntu 11.04 and Ubuntu 11.10, users-admin is still the default utility for this in Lubuntu.\nWhen you report this bug, you should start the report by running ubuntu-bug with the package name for the utility that allows this arguably undesirable behavior (for example, ubuntu-bug gnome-control-center or ubuntu-bug gnome-system-tools). You'll have a better handle on how to use the ubuntu-bug utility once you've read the bug-reporting documentation. You should make sure your bug report is complete and self-contained, so that it is not necessary for Ubuntu developers to refer to this question in order to fully understand and appreciate the problem you're describing. It would also be helpful for you to post a comment here with a link to the bug, once you've reported it.\n\nA: Thanks to Vivek & Eliah for the answers. I don't have any Ubuntu live CD.But I followed the procedure mentioned in this link and it worked, restored my admin privilege.\nhttp://www.debuntu.org/recover-root-password-single-user-mode-and-grub\n", "Q: How to create an Ask Ubuntu search button in gnome-shell? On the overview in gnome-shell, there are two search buttons for Google and Wikipedia.

Is it best to get 2 graphics card with 2 dvi ports each?\n\nA: \nPrior to mainstream adoption of the PCIe bus, configurations of more\n  than two monitors were either achieved with an AGP card with dual\n  video outputs or by using an AGP graphics adapter as the primary\n  device and a conventional PCI graphics adapter as a secondary device.\n  However, given the bandwidth limitations of the older PCI bus[citation\n  needed], such setups were not common, and maximum overall graphics\n  performance could be obtained only by using specialty solutions such\n  as the Matrox G450, which features four outputs from one graphics\n  adapter. Now that computers with two or more PCIe interfaces are\n  popular, middle- and high-end computers are no longer limited to two\n  monitors driven by a single main graphics adapter. If a dual PCIe\n  interface is not available or is otherwise occupied, a standard PCI\n  graphics card can still be used to provide additional video outputs,\n  albeit with performance trade-offs. Specialized\n  application environments such as CAD, day trading of corporate stocks,\n  and software development are increasingly using six or more monitors\n  on one production system.\nA quad-monitor Digital Audio Workstation Additional monitors can also\n  be connected to PCs via a USB connection such as DisplayLink.\n\nSeems that it doesn't matter much if it's connected to a PCI Express slot. If it's just a normal PCI (or maybe an AGP) it's recommended to use 2 seperate graphic cards.\n\nSource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-monitor#More_than_two_monitors\n\nAlso, here's a PCI Express graphic card that support 4 monitors. Don't know how Ubuntu compatibility is though.\nhttp://www.nextag.com/VisionTek-Radeon-HD5570-PCIe-827596030/prices-html\n\nA: 2x cards with dual DVI outputs will only depend on what kind of monitors you will be getting, keep in mind that you choose a card with a supported chipset by the drivers.\n\nFor information on the support for ATI chipsets use this link.\n\nFor information on the support for NVidia chipsets use this link and click on the Supported Products link.\n", "Q: Unable to boot: Missing Operating system I had installed Ubuntu 11.10 along with the another Ubuntu 11.10 which already installed on my netbook.
