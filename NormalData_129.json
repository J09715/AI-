["Q: Clean install with home folder and multiple users I had reformatted my system (unfortunately an update failed) and had my home folder on a separate partition. Thankfully I still have all of my users files (in their respective folders), but there was no option to use this on install (since my update had failed...).\nHow can I recreate the old users with their previous home directories?\n(Are there problems with user permissions with just dragging and dropping the entire contents of folders?)\n\nA: You have to setup the partitions to have home set to /dev/sdb1 (for example) during setup. There is an option for \"Something else\" during install at the hard drive section. As long as you create the users in the same order, it should do permissions correctly (no promises, of course).\nI am not 100% on just copy and pasting the files and permissions in say nautilus, but you can always run sudo chown <user>:<user> -R /home/<user> after you copy it to set the folder to the correct owner. That should set everything correctly.\n", "Q: Samba share external USB device I managed to share stuff from my Ubuntu 12.04 to my private network, and the data is visible from a Windows machine. I even shared a hdd that has windows on it. So everything seems to work fine.\nWhen I want to share a mounted device (USB pen drive, USB HDD... etc) however, I get from the Windows machine: Access denied on file \\...\nI realize that this is due to the missing rights on the mounted folder. By default a mounted folder gets the equivalent of 700 : drwx------, and the owner myself. But, I can't seem to change the rights on the external device... they remain 700.\nIs there a special trick I need  to do in order to share NTFS mounted usb devices?\nThanks\nP.S. from this Question I see that NTFS devices can not be shared....is this true? It's a bit strange, because I have in my PC 2 HDD's with 3 NTFS partitions, and I can share them without a problem.\n\nA: I found the solution, if anybody cares:\nThe external NTFS drive mounts with me as owner and with 700 permissions, meaning that only I can access it. I found a tip on the ubuntu forums from Morbius1 that I can force the incoming connection to look like me by adding the following line in /etc/samba/smb.conf, in the shared section:\nforce user = your-user-name\n\nIt works great.\n", "Q: Is there a manufacturer unique identifier on a hard drive and how do I read that identifier?

I know a little about users and groups; in the past I might have had a group like 'DBAS' or 'ADMINS' and I'd add individual users to each group...\nBut I was surprised to learn I could add users to other users - as if they were groups.\nFor example if my /etc/group contained the following:\nuser1:x:12501:\nuser2:x:12502:user1\nadmin:x:123:user2,jim,bob\n\nSince user2 is a member of the admin group, and user1 is a member of user2 - is user1 effectively an admin?  If the admin group is in the sudoers file, can user1 use it as well?\nI've tried to simulate this and I haven't been able to do so as user1...but I'm not sure it's impossible.\nEDIT:  SORRY - updated error in question.\n\nA: In your example you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have  the user user1 as a part of the group user2.\n\n*Have  the user user2 as a part of the group admin.\n\n\nThe user user1 is distinct from the group user1. \nSince (the user) user2 is a member of the admin group, and (the user) user1 is a member of (the group) user2 - is user1 effectively an admin? \n\n\n*\n\n*No, the user user2 is a member of the admin group. Not the group user1.\n\n\nIf the admin group is in the sudoers file, can (the user) user2 use it as well?\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes, just as the other users which are members of the group, jim and bob.\n\n\nIf the admin group is in the sudoers file, can user1 use it as well?\n\n\n*\n\n*No, since the admin group only consists of users. It has the user user2 in it. Even though the user user1 is part of the group user2. They are different things, but share the same name in this and many distros setup. Groups on one side, users on the other. If the names match, they are still entierly different things.\n\n\nTo sum it up: Separate the user from the group. The names may be the same, but they refer to different entities. In GNU/Linux you do not have groups inside groups, a group can only contain users (which is different from say Windows).\n\nA: A bit of background: in Linux, a user is always a member of a primary group and also can be a member of zero or more of secondary groups. \nWhen a user creates a file, the file's user ID and group ID are set to the ID of the user and her primary group respectively, so the file becomes \"owned\" by that user and group. Also, permissions on the file are set automatically using the current umask setting, which includes permissions for \"user\", \"group\" and \"others\". So, more or less, all users in the same group as user's primary group are getting at least some permissions on the files the user creates. \nSecondary groups, on the other hand, do not affect ownership of the files user creates, you can think of them as a way to allow access to files created by others.\nAs you can see, the \"automatic\" behavior of the primary group makes it a bit prone to allowing access unintentionally. For this reason, Ubuntu along with many other Linux distributions uses User Private Group scheme - when a user is created, a group with the same name is created and is set as the primary group of that user. So the user's primary group is always a group with exactly one member.\nFrom CentOS documentation:\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux uses a user private group (UPG) scheme, which\n  makes UNIX groups easier to manage. \nA UPG is created whenever a new user is added to the system. A UPG\n  has the same name as the user for which it was created and that user\n  is the only member of the UPG. \nUPGs make it safe to set default permissions for a newly created file\n  or directory, allowing both the user and the group of that user to\n  make modifications to the file or directory. \nThe setting which determines what permissions are applied to a newly\n  created file or directory is called a umask and is configured in the\n  /etc/bashrc file. Traditionally on UNIX systems, the umask is set to\n  022, which allows only the user who created the file or directory to\n  make modifications. Under this scheme, all other users, including\n  members of the creator's group, are not allowed to make any\n  modifications. However, under the UPG scheme, this \"group protection\"\n  is not necessary since every user has their own private group.\n\nSo, as you can see, there's no \"user is a member of another user\" thing  - as @Kent mentions, in Linux users cannot \"contain\" other users and also groups can not be nested and can only contain users, not other groups. The source of your confusion is that within User Private Group scheme user's primary group is a \"private\" group with the same name as the user.\n", "Q: resizing partitions I have the following configuration:\n\n\n*\n\n*sda1 1 GB maybe fat32 (windows recovery partition)\n\n*sda2 40 GB ntfs(windows drive c) with boot flag\n\n*sda3 around 100GB ntfs(storage partition)\n\n*sda4 extended partition:\n\n*\n\n*sda5 10 GB ext4 partition\n\n*sda6 1 GB linux swap\n\n\n\nI want to make this changes:\n\n\n*\n\n*sda2 30 GB resize(decrease size with 10 GB)\n\n*sda3 around 100GB(move and maybe decrease size with 4-5 GB)\n\n*sda4 around 20-22 GB (move and increase size with 10-15GB)\n\n*sda5 around 20 GB (move and increase size with 10-12 GB)\n\n*sda6 2 GB (move and increase size with 1 GB)\n\n\nIs it safe to do this operations? \nWill i lose grub?\nI will do the changes with gparted on puppy linux live usb.\n\nA: Is it safe to do this operations? - no, it is NOT safe, just as any operation with partitions.

Can I use NTP service through proxy? how to do it?\nI want NTP auto sync my clock through proxy.\n\nA: NTP uses UDP packets with port number 123. So if you are behind aproxy or firewall, and the proxy or firewall blocks the UDP port 123, the public NTP servers you specify in /etc/ntp.conf won't be reachable to your host. If you can't reach them then you need to use internal ntp servers if they are available on your network.\n\nA: If internal NTP servers (with their own clock source; e.g. GPS) and dual-homed NTP servers are not an option, then a lower accuracy option is htpdate (Note: not ntpdate). This pulls time from the timestamp inside a HTTP header - so it is not the most accurate.\nNote: this system presumes that the web servers used as a time source have accurate time\nSee https://www.vervest.org/htp/ or https://github.com/twekkel/htpdate\n\nA: You can use NTP servers setup in your network DMZ or setup to also have direct access to the Internet.

Why?\n\n\nA: Parted is just being overly conservative. The usual practice these days is to align partitions on 1MiB (2048-sector) boundaries because this works on Advanced Format disks, on certain type of RAID setups that require alignment, and on most SSDs. For an Advanced Format disk, so long as the alignment is on a multiple of 8, you're fine, and 2048 is a multiple of 8. The lost disk space is puny -- 0.0000336% of your total disk space, if I did the math right and didn't mistype anything. So don't worry about it; just use the 1MiB alignment.\n\nA: I shall probably add that on Linux one can come in a situation where parted may never pass an optimal and a minimal alignment check at the same time.\nThe reason for this is that parted ( at least as of version 3.2 ) relies on libblkid, which in turn reports values from /sys/block/<disk>/queue/minimum_io_size and /sys/block/<disk>/queue/optimal_io_size ( see io-limits.txt ). \nSo while for an Advanced Format disk the former is likely to be something like 4k, the latter can have some mad value -- e.g. 65535 * 512 == 33553920.\nNow if we look at the source code -- \"proper\", or \"best performance\" alignment is defined by the formula in parted.c::partition_align_check(): \npart->geom.start % pa->grain_size == pa->offset, \n\nwhere grain_size comes from I/O block size above, geom.start is our partition offset, and alignment offset pa->offset is quite frequently zero. \nBy default, parted would assume 1 MiB to be an optimal, and ~4k to be the minimal ( not quite so, it is a bit of a simplification ) block size, so these values would correlate ; however, if libblkid decides otherwise, parted tends to trust it, and replace that default value of 1 MiB with the value found in /sys/block/<disk>/queue/optimal_io_size. ( At the same time, /sys/block/<disk>/queue/minimum_io_size will quite likely give you the same 4096 B. )\nIn that case, parted optimal check will never pass simultaneously with the minimal check, what could possibly be a little confusing.\nWith that in mind -- if in doubt, have a look at queue/optimal_io_size and queue/minimum_io_size, and if the former is not divisible by the latter, just ignore parted' warning, and decide for yourself whether do you want to go with an optimal or a minimal check.\n", "Q: Ethernet Connection Doesn't work Not sure what happened over the weekend (possibly the last sudo apt-get upgrade I ran this morning?), but I noticed that my computer's using my phone's internet connection (connected via USB and listed as \"Wired Connection 2\") instead of my ethernet connection (\"Wired Connection 1\").  \nI've tried restarting NetworkManager with sudo service network-manager start and stop, but that doesn't appear to fix anything.

It's pretty easy to find a program in Linux regardless of desktop as most have a search function built into the applications menu. Here's the one in Matte, called \"Startup Applications\":\n\nTo add the startup command just select the plus and enter the info as follows. The other two fields don't really matter, but enter the command in the command box. You can enter it without the sudo as below:\nsynclient TouchPadOff=0\n\nReboot and it should work great. Unfortunately you may have to do this in every desktop environment you install. KDE might work without this added command.

However the only 1 remaining problem is that each time I tried to print it will only print the file on the top half of the page only: meaning that for some reason, the printer \"squeezes\" the whole content of each page in the file to fit into the top half of the page only (so the proportion in the print-out is not correct vertically).\nThis happens with every type of file I tried to print (Documents, Images, Web pages). I checked the Printing's setting & properties and couldn't find anything related to this issue yet and I've already made sure to set all the information correct (paper size, source etc.). \nThe Print Preview always display correctly on the screen, but it's only the actual print-out that shows this problem. I also tried with several different types of papers (A4, photos etc.) but the result is always the same: the printer keeps putting the content in the top half of the paper only.\n\nA: Thanks very much for your tips! I finally realized too that I indeed had an incorrect driver installed.\nMy printer is Canon MX328 and when \"Printing\" tried to install the driver for me it could only find drivers for MX300 and MX330 series, so it \"recommended\" me to use the MX300 one, which apparently turns out to be the cause of the incorrect print-out.\nI finally found the MX320's Linux driver from Canon web site but in DEB format, while Ubuntu's Printing requires only PPD format when installing driver manually. Double-clicking the DEB file does not automatically install the file (it only opens in text editor) so I had to work still more around it to open it in Software Center in order to successfully install the driver and get the correct print-out. Not sure why Ubuntu did not make this more convenient for user, but finally for me the problem's solved now. \n\nA: I experienced a very similar problem (the printable area was \"squeezed\" to the left-hand side of the page only).  My printer is an HP Officejet Pro 8500.  When installing the printer (within Ubuntu 12.04), I used the driver recommended by Ubuntu through the printing utility.  Even though the driver seemed outdated (model 1175 instead of my model, which was an 8500), it was the most-recent driver.\nTo resolve the issue, I changed the driver.  I used a driver that was a generation or two older (selected through the print utility tool).  Although printing speed seemed to decrease, my printable area was once again normal.  HP needs to update the Ubuntu drivers, which probably is not high on their priority list.\n", "Q: Ubuntu cannot boot \nPossible Duplicate:\nMy computer boots to a black screen, what options do I have to fix it? \n\nI've Ubuntu 12.04 installed along with windows 7.

I often use the following construct for building and installing a tarball:\nsudo -v && make && sudo make install\n\nwhich will allow me to enter my password immediately and have everything done unattended. This works well except in the rare case that building takes longer than the sudo timeout, which may happen on my rather slow machine with large projects (even when using make -j4).\nBut when the build takes a long time, that's exactly when doing things unattended has a great advantage. Can anyone think of a shell construct that allows me to input my password immediately, and which has make executing under normal permissions and make install under elevated permissions?\nFor security reasons, I don't want to configure my user to use sudo without password.\nA viable option is to set the timeout to very long, but I'm hoping for something more elegant.\n\nA: Once you're gained root privileges, you can use sudo again to execute a command as the non-root user:\nsudo bash -c \"sudo -u $USER non-root-user-command ; root-command\"\n\nNote that you need to use double quotes, not single quotes. If you use single quotes, $USER will be replaced with root, which won't achieve the desired outcome. Hopefully, these commands will illustrate my point:\n$ sudo bash -c \"echo $USER\"\ndavid\n$ sudo bash -c 'echo $USER'\nroot\n\n\nSo, let's take the example mentioned in the question:\n make && sudo make install\n\nThat would become:\n sudo bash -c \"sudo -u $USER make && make install\"\n\n\nA: I think this is the best way to do it:\nmake | sudo bash -c 'cat - && make install'\n\nThis will start both make and sudo simultaneously, with sudo prompting for your password. In the mean time, make sends all its output to the pipe, which is read by the cat command. After this is done, make install is run. It is invoked from the bash process, which still has elevated permissions, so there's no timeout issue.\n\nA: The simplest method that does not require you to alter your system files:\necho {password} | sudo -S -v && make && echo {password} | sudo -S make install\n\nThis will allow the script to run without prompting for a password. \nHowever, this method poses a security risk since you're storing your password in plain text. \n\nSome other methods can be found here but most are about editing system files.\n\nedit:\nIf you add a space in front of the first echo the command will not be shown in the bash history.\n", "Q: Having both gnome and kde without the need to switch between them Is it possible to install and run both gnome and kde on Ubuntu and enjoy the best of both worlds without having to switch between them?\n\nA: That depends what specifically you mean.\nOf course, you can install both environments, the packages themselves are not mutually exclusive.

Answers to this problem were: go to the sounds settings. This doesn't work when sounds controls aren't willing to open. (would like a sollution for this)\nI uninstalled PulseAudio and rebooted.

Alsa mixer is showing an USB device and output is set to max but still no sound. Pulse did recognise it was a logitech but I had no sound there as well (se first problem).\nI'm a novice user.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: I have had the experience that the existing sound settings of Ubuntu (the ones that appear if you click on the sound icon next to the time) are too simplified and do not control all the options of my sound card. \nFor that reason, I got the suggestion to use a more advanced controller, which works with pulse. It is called PulseAudio Volume Control (or pavucontrol) and you can install it from the Software Center. You most probably have to re-install Pulse, it's the best way to get along with sound if you have latest Ubuntus.\nYou could also try other ubuntu packages for this purpose, such as Default Sound Card asoundconf or PulseAudio Manager paman.

I want to give some life to my old laptop, and recalibrate the battery (old now).\nWhen reading around on forums, the common info is to turn on the PC, drain the batt, even from Bios, and then recharge batt without having the PC on, and repeat cycle until satisfied.\nI hope there is a way to soft up this via ACPI without the need to actually let the PC die out of misery.\nI was hoping for a program that when running, shall unlink the actual AC power source from the Battery charging mechanism.\nSo when program is running, even if the laptop is plugged, it shall use the power from Battery until fully drained, then, once drained, it starts recharging.

It is working, as I can see that the meter responds to noise, but it's just too low.\nalsamixer's control is the same, so that doesn't help. I tried messing around in pulseaudio too, but to no avail.\nIn lsusb it's Bus 002 Device 004: ID 0556:0001 Asahi Kasei Microsystems Co., Ltd AK5370 I/F A/D Converter.\n\nA: Here is the top rated 1 star review for your microphone.\n\nMe and my friend both ordered the same mic from Amazon on the same day. They arrived soon after. But the one I received was a faulty one and the microphone's gain is extremely low.\nMy friend's mic seemed to operate fine. So we swapped the units and checked that it wasn't something to do with our computers. And that mic was still faulty. So I returned mine and got a replacement unit.\n  But unfortunately the replacement unit I received was also faulty!\nIf you Google \"Logitech mic gain too low\", you can find a whole forum on Logitech's website where people have the issue and let me tell you, it's nothing to do with the OS as people might tell you.\n  We have tried 2 faulty units on OS X 10.8, OS X 10.7, Win 7, Win 8 and it looks like a design issue in certain batches at least.\n\nIt looks like you got one of the faulty microphones.\n\nA: I have the same microphone and it's (now) working fine. On reading your post I found mine had stopped working (weird analogue noise but no signal) since upgrading to 12.04, but a restart and leaving it plugged in for boot fixed this.\nMake sure you install pavucontrol if you haven't got it (I think they stopped shipping it by default a while back, but maybe this has changed). It's still the most effective way of \"debugging\" any Pulse-but-not-ALSA recording problems. It also allows you to turn the gain up  past 100%, which is what you might need here. \nHope that helps. It's a great mic too for the price :)\n\nA: I'm posting this in hopes that someone else realizes what I didn't:\nThis microphone has a green button on it. You need to press it to turn it on.\nI spent probably 30 minutes debugging the same issue in this question; I could see only a very small gain on the mic. Then I looked down, pressed the button, and smashed my head into my desk.\n\nA: So your microphone doesn't work?\nLet's go through the troubleshooting steps to diagnose the problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*Test the microphone in another Environment.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have a dual boot setup, test the mic in the other OS that is installed.\n\n\n*Try a live disc from a different distribution.\n\n-- If neither of these tests result in a functional microphone it is possible that either the mic is malfunctioning, or the physical port on your machine is faulty.\n\n\n*Test on another physical machine\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If the mic is not functional on a different machine it is likely that the microphone is faulty.\n\n\n*Test other microphones in your machine.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If a known-to-be-working microphone doesn't work, chances are that either the physical port on your machine is faulty, or there is a problem with PulseAudio / ALSA.\n\n\n\nIf after testing the physical hardware you determine that all works as expected, but you still don't have a functional microphone it might be possible that either PulseAudio or ALSA need additional configuration.\nPulseAudio\n\nMake sure the input device you want to use is properly selected in pavucontrol. The Recording tab will show the active input device. The Input tab will allow you to select which input Port to use and to adjust the gain. Values over 100% are permitted. Additional configuration is available with the pacmd tool. \nALSA\n\nAdjustments to devices can be made with amixer from the terminal. Ensure that devices are not muted. You are able to set device volumes there as well.\n", "Q: will squid-deb-proxy be used for release upgrades?

One example is here.\nThere also other logs from boot chart but I don't understand them.\nRegards and thank you for help\n\nA: I really have to say that it's very likely that your filesystem has been damaged or the upgrade really hosed key system files. I would highly recommend backing up your files and reinstalling as when a system is in such a state it's usually too much hassle to pinpoint the problem. \nTo back up your files, you can download Ubuntu and use a LiveCD to mount your Ubuntu partition in the file manager. Navigate to /home// and your files will be there for the taking. Back them up to a thumb drive, wipe the computer and reinstall, then move the files back.\nAnother task that might be beneficial is to make sure that your hard drive is not failing. You can use Ubuntu's Disk Utility: Select your hard drive, then select \"SMART data\". Perform a short test and see if it tells you that the drive is about to fail (if it has a few bad sectors it's not worth fretting about as it's not uncommon).\n", "Q: is x86_64 a x86 or x64? my ubuntu version is  12.04, and when cat /proc/version, it shows\nLinux version 3.2.0-23-generic (buildd@crested) (gcc version 4.6.3 (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.6.3-1ubuntu4) ) #36-Ubuntu SMP Tue Apr 10 20:39:51 UTC 2012\nLinux yuzhe-HP 3.2.0-23-generic #36-Ubuntu SMP Tue Apr 10 20:39:51 UTC 2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nHere it shows the os is x86_64.

What's on the 192.168.122.0/24 CIDR? Is there an interface listening on one of the IPs from within that range? I'd probably try to look at the output of:\ngrep -R 192.168.122 /etc\n\nto find out if there's any configuration related to it and also check cron entries in /etc/cron*\n\nA: The address space 192.168.122 is commonly used by kvm. You can see more about this in libvirt site.\nlibvirt\nThere has all the info.\n\nA: May be ufw is enabled at boot, sets the rules and then gets inactive.

How should I use no machine in windows to remotely connect to ubuntu12.04? I got this: \n\nAuthentication failed.\n\nDo I need to configure something in Ubuntu machine? \nIn Ubuntu machine, I chose 'sharing' in Remote Desktop Preferences.\nThank you in advance! \n\nA: Ubuntu's Desktop Sharing is just the VNC protocol under the hood, whereas Windows uses RDP.  So you're either going to have to get Ubuntu running RDP.  As @laurent mentioned, there's xrdp, but I haven't used it personally.  The easier method is to use a VNC client on Windows, and there are a tonne of those that should all work, including:\n\n\n*\n\n*TightVNC\n\n*UltraVNC\nThere's also the NoMachine/NX stuff, but it's moderately complicated to get set up compared to VNC-based stuff.\n\nA: In Ubuntu you need to install and configure at least nx server and nx node. Not sure if you need to install nx client too. You can download them from no machine website.\nAnother option is to install xrdppackage in ubuntu and to connect using the normal RDP connection software in Windows.\nThe sharing desktop option is to share to another Ubuntu desktop using the Ubuntu's Sharing Desktop Application.\n", "Q: How do I use the Mythbuntu repository on a headless server?

That says the directory you are in (it should be /home/name_of_user/Downloads)\nif you are at the right place, try your tar command.\nAfterward, to see all that is there, type ls (for list)\nIt'll give you a list of files in your directory.\nNow,the file is extracted, and you should be able to install it per NikTh's link\nA starters guide to the command line can be found http://linuxcommand.org/learning_the_shell.php\n\nA: Assuming you have downloaded the .tar.gz file using Firefox, it is in your download directory. The download directory is ~/Downloads.\nOpen a terminal with Ctrl-Alt-T keyboard shortcut and copy and paste these line in the terminal. Press Enter after each line\ncd ~/Downloads\n\ntar -zxvf filename.tar.gz\n\nDon't forget to change the filename portion with the actual name of the file. The extracted files will be also in the Downloads directory.\nThe directory of the download is /home/your-login-name/Downloads folder. not in /home/Downloads folder. your-login-name is the name you use for Login. \nIf you are interested in installing something from a .tar.gz file: See this question -> How do I install a .tar.gz (or .tar.bz2) file?\n", "Q: How do I download/buy music? I have used Limewire in the past with Windows, now I use Ubuntu and im not sure what to use. I dont know how to look for the music I want and be able to keep it in my music.\nI don't know about copyright infringement, but no that's not what I want to do. I'm wanting to buy music not steal it. \n\nA: You can purchase music from the Ubuntu One Music Store. It has built in cloud sync and online streaming, so you can take your music on the go. \n\nA: You might want to try http://www.frostwire.com/\nIn there, you will find frostwire (a program somewhat similar to limewire) in a .deb format\nTo install this .deb file, just double-click it. Ubuntu-software-center should appear. Wait for a bit, and you will be given the option to install\n\nA: There are a number of easy ways to get music. This is the official Ubuntu documentation, but it's a bit out of date. Everything there still works, but you have even more options now.  \nYou can download music using your music player, your web browser, or file sharing software. Some of it is free, some costs money. Not all those options are legal everywhere. If you aren't sure you need to ask a lawyer, and not rely on opinions posted here.  \nThe two most popular music players, Rhythmbox and Banshee, have several options built-in. Rhythmbox, the default audio player, has the Ubuntu One Music store, as well as Magnatune and Jamendo stores. Banshee also has the Magnatune and Jamendo stores, as well as plugins to download music from Amazon, eMusic, and Internet Archive. Ubuntu 12.10 is due to be released very soon and will probably have a new way to download music from Amazon. Not all these options will work in every country. You'll just have to try some and read the terms and conditions for each to learn more.  \nUsing your web browser, you can download audio files just like any other file. Then add them to your music player if you want to keep them. Many bands release free sample tracks on their own sites, as well as music blogs. Try simple Google searches for types of music you like to see what's out there. This Ubuntu forums thread is a good starting point.  \nDepending on what country you are in, you can also just use a torrent tracker and/or Transmission (installed by default) to download music. Usenet is another popular option, which requires special software. These are the methods that are most likely to result in legal issues, so pay special attention to the laws of your nation if you try these. Another consideration is that these are unregulated and more likely to contain low-quality files and malware.  \nWhatever method you go with, just be sure to avoid files with Digital Restrictions Management. These are defective and frequently give users problems. \n", "Q: Why Does Ejabberd Start Fail? I am trying to install ejabberd 2.1.10-2 on my Ubuntu 12.04.1 server.

I failed to inter Ubuntu with this error \nGNU GRUB VERSION 1.99-21........etc\n\nI spoke with technical support at www.ubuntu.com he was really nice and he served me will I thank him very much.... but I didn't like his last solution\n\nFrom the helpfulpost of Boot-info I can see that the partition where\n      you installed Ubuntu (wubi /dev/sda1) is corrupted.\n      The boot-repair tool attempted to repair thatwith the fsck command but\n      it wasn't possible. (failed).\n      I have not further suggestion but to remove Ubuntu installation from\n      within windows (Control Panel > Programs > Programs and Feautures >\n      Uninstall) and then install it again.\n      Of course you will lose your datafrom Ubuntu.\n      Thanks\n\ncan you give me other solution or tool so I can save my personal files !!!!!\nthis is my \"boot repair\" report\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/1281522/\n\nA: When you try to boot a Wubi install and you end up at a grub> prompt, then most likely it's the result of corruption. Wubi installs Ubuntu on a large virtual partition that is a single file called the root.disk (if you install on a FAT32 partition, other .disk files are created as well).\nTo confirm it you can run the bootinfoscript and you'll see something like:\nsda1: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       ntfs\n    Boot sector type:  Windows Vista/7: NTFS\n    Boot sector info:  No errors found in the Boot Parameter Block.\n    Operating System:  Windows 7\n    Boot files:        /bootmgr /Boot/BCD /Windows/System32/winload.exe \n                       /ntldr /NTDETECT.COM /wubildr /ubuntu/winboot/wubildr \n                       /wubildr.mbr /ubuntu/winboot/wubildr.mbr \n                       /ubuntu/disks/swap.disk\n\nYou can see it lists /ubuntu/disks/swap.disk, but it's also supposed to show /ubuntu/disks/root.disk. \nIf this happens, the first thing to do is to boot Windows and run chkdsk /f or chkdsk /r (the latter also looks for damaged disk sectors). This will repair any NTFS file system corruption and sometimes fix the damaged root.disk file (but not always).\nHere's how to do it from Windows 7. Go to Computer, right click on the \"drive\" you selected when you installed Wubi e.g. C:\\, and select Properties, Tools, Error-checking Check now, and then Start:\n\nIf you installed Ubuntu on the C:\\ \"drive\", then you have to reboot Windows to let chkdsk complete. Make sure you don't hit any key at bootup or it will cancel the scan.\nNow comes the tricky part. Sometimes Windows will remove the repaired file to a hidden folder called \\found.000 or \\found.001 (it increments). And in most cases the file name will be lost, so you'll see a file called file0000.chk inside there. In this case you want to look for a file that's about the size of the root.disk (at least 5GB and up to 30GB). You can move that back to \\ubuntu\\disks\\root.disk and you should be good to go. If the entire \\ubuntu\\disks directory is repaired, then instead you might see a directory \\found.000\\dir0000.chk and inside that you may find root.disk and swap.disk. In this case, move the directory back, renaming it to disks.\nHere is how to do it... hit the Windows key + R, type cmd, look above and right-click on CMD.EXE, and select Run as administrator. Then from the command like:\nC:\\>cd \\found.000\nC:\\found.000>dir\n Volume in drive C is OS\n Volume Serial Number is B4B7-99A8\n\n Directory of C:\\found.000\n\n19/07/2011  02:02 PM    15,000,000,000 file0000.chk\n               1 File(s)              8 bytes\n               0 Dir(s)  222,258,069,504 bytes free\n\nC:\\found.000>move file0000.chk \\ubuntu\\disks\\root.disk\n        1 file(s) moved.\n\nor if the whole disks folder is recovered\nC:\\found.000>move dir0000.chk \\ubuntu\\disks\n        1 dir(s) moved.\n\n", "Q: Win32.Malware.Heur_Generic.A.(kcloud) I recently started using ubuntu as my main OS, but I am sort of addicted to ms office so I installed PlayOnLinux to be able to use it.

That's good advice, I took it and left Windows for Ubuntu and I don't worry about what Microsoft is doing.  \n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu to other hard disk from a running system I'd like to install Ubuntu on a disk which is connected (but not mounted), without booting from a DVD or USB.\nThe goal is to have Ubuntu installed on an external disk, unplug it, plug it to other computer and run.\nI know it takes 20 minutes etc etc. I simply want to do it from a running system, without need to reboot that.\nWhat are my options?\nEdit: To make it clearer, I have this scenario:\n\n\n*\n\n*my friend comes with an empty disk\n\n*I install the system on that disk from my running system (Ubuntu)\n\n*friend puts the disk back to his machine and boots this installed system.\n\n\nSo solutions with USB key or copying my own system are not what I need.\n\nA: If you are in an Ubuntu machine, then you can just copy the running system in the external hard drive.\nLet us assume you already partitioned the external hard drive.  For this example I am going to use 2 partitions: / and /home.\n$ sudo mkdir -p /target\n$ sudo mount /media/external-hdd/main /target\n$ sudo sync\n$ sudo cp -ax / /target\n$ sudo mount /media/external-hdd/home /target/home\n$ sudo cp -ax /home /target/home\n\ncp -ax does not cross different file system and it is archived (preserve permissions, does not follow symlinks, etc.)\nThen, you have to update the grub settings and the fstab in the target disk.  You can use chroot, but before, you will need:\n$ sudo mount -o bind /sys /target/sys\n$ sudo mount -o bind /proc /target/proc\n$ sudo mount -o bind /dev /target/dev\n\nNow you are ready to chroot:\n$ sudo chroot /target\n# (now you are in the external HD as root)\n\nNow, you have to update the UUIDs in your fstab and grub.  In order to get the UUID, you can run:\n# blkid\n\nThen, replace in /etc/fstab the UUID with the appropriate id gotten with blkid.\nThe last step is to update the configuration for booting and install the bootloader in the external hard drive.  In my case I use grub, so, I have edit /boot/grub/menu.lst.\nThere you have to replace the line that starts with # kopt=root=UUID=... ro and replace the content of UUID to the partition that has root file system.\n# grub-install /device/name\n# update-grub\n\nWhere /device/name is the external hdd.\nThen, you can exit of chroot and unmount the devices.\n# ^D\n$ sudo umount /target/sys\n$ sudo umount /target/proc\n$ sudo umount /target/dev\n$ sudo umount /target/home\n$ sudo umount /target/\n\nAnd the disk should be ready to be used.  Once you boot it, it might ran fsck, because it was not unmount properly (you copied the content live).\n\nA: You can use debootstrap for that, that should be exactly what you need. Take a look at this link.\n\nA: If you have the ISO image you can create a bootable USB with a live system with either of those 2 tools mentioned in this article:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent\nJust type in USB in the unity and a program to create such a disk will appear.\n", "Q: How to copy all .sol files in a system to a specific folder I want to copy all the files that I have in the system with extension sol to the specific folder\ncan you please help me.\nI tried sudo cp / *.sol ~/SOL/\nbut it doesn't work\nUPDATED:\nI tried to follow the first answer, and that's what I got:\nroot@johntheripper-PORTEGE-Z835:~# find / -name *.sol | wc -l\n61\nroot@johntheripper-PORTEGE-Z835:~# find / -type f -name '*.sol' -exec cp {} ~/SOL \\;\n...\n...\n...\nroot@johntheripper-PORTEGE-Z835:~# find ~/SOL -name *.sol | wc -l\n26\n\nAs you can see 26 out of 61 file was copied, please help me to copy the rest.\n\nA: There's a bash script to copy files with specific extension in this link.\nThere's also an answer on StackOverflow, I haven't tested it yet, but here it is:\nfind / -type f -name '*.sol' -exec cp '{}' ~/SOL \\;\n\nEDIT: As phoibos suggested, I changed the answer adding '' in the code.\n\nA: I usually use Midnight Commander for this. You can install it using\nsudo apt-get install mc\n\n\nTo find all files with a particular extension, choose Command -> Find File (Esc-?), enter your search criteria, when the search finishes click [Panelize]. All files found will be displayed in a panel from where you can review and copy them.\nThe explanation is a bit long but believe me it's easier than remembering the syntax of the find command :)\n\nA: First change to root\nsudo -s\n\nchange directory to / \ncd /\n\nNow enjoy\ncp $(locate *.sol) /path-to-directory\n\nPS: IF the count is less it may be due to duplicate files,You can check the output\n", "Q: How do I make a compiz sphere look like a planet? I have read topics of people that what to style their compiz sphere like a planet and set a background image like space.\nIt definitely very good idea, but I have not been able to find a tutorial of how this is done (only some clips in youtube of people who have done this and a plugin, but it is not known to work work 12.04 version of Ubuntu).\nI have set my settings of compiz manager, so I have a sphere now, but I need some help with the images that I need to set. Has anyone idea how these pictures should be created and who the compiz will concatenate them?\nEDIT:\nOne of the answers here is showing how to set different images on each work space on Ubuntu 12.04 - Is it possible to have a different background for each workspace?\nWhat is left are the images - maybe someone will offer a way how to generate them?\n\nA: This is possible.\nI used to use it on a 10.10 install.\nI found the images you need hosted here: http://www.humus.name/index.php?page=Textures&ID=19\nMake sure you grab the zip on the right hand side.\nThe only issue you'll come up against is you will need the compiz 'wallpaper' plugin which lets you set different papers for each workspace. The best you will manage on 12.04+ (so far anyway) is to set the cube caps and have a repeating wallpaper (pretty naff)\nHope you manage to get this set up, looks pretty cool with a stary skydome.

Now I just need regular user access to it, using sudo. How do I do this?\nThe command sudo echo disk > /sys/power/state simply returns bash: /sys/power/state: Permission denied.\nAlso, I need this in a regularly used script, how can I make it so that I don't have to type in my password for it to work???\n\nA: Note that the redirection characters \"separate\" execution and privileges. On this command:\nsudo echo disk > /sys/power/state\n\nWhat you're doing is running echo disk as root (pointless) and then piping that, as your normal user, into a file that's owned by root, that's why you get permission denied.\nThis is a very common use case, what you need to do is sudo the part that actually writes to the file instead, something like this works:\necho disk | sudo tee /sys/power/state\n\nYou can also create a shell script (a file) with:\n  echo disk > /sys/power/state\n\nName it, for instance, script.sh, then run chmod 755 script.sh and run that with sudo:\nsudo /wherever/you/put/this/script.sh\n\nAs for running a command without needing a password, that's been discussed before: How do I sudo without having to enter my password?. It can be somewhat insecure; you can control which user gets to execute which command as root without password, but in this case you'd need to allow execution of the tee command which could allow malicious users to overwrite any file as root. So use with caution and please read all the documentation and understand the security implications of doing this.\n", "Q: pgadmin III doesn't work due to \"The server lacks instrumentation functions.\" When pgAdmin III is used to open a PostgreSQL database the following message appears.\nThere does not seem to be any obvious package listed in the Ubuntu Software Center for this.\n\nThe server lacks instrumentation functions.\npgadmin III uses some support functions that are not available by default in all PostgreSQL versions.  These enable some tasks that make life easier when dealing with log files and configuration files.\nThe adminpack is installed and activated by default if you are running the one-click installer of PostgreSQL.

How can I add make sudo let me run this one file without having to enter my password every time I run it? \nI know that there are questions regarding running commands without a password, but I wasn't able to find one on running a file without a password.\nI am aware of the security risks, but I'm at home on a computer that I trust.\nI added john ALL = NOPASSWD: /home/john/.script/hibernate.sh to my /etc/sudoers but when running the command sudo sh /home/john/.script/hibernate.sh it still prompts me for my password...\n\nA: Use visudo for a safe editing environment to edit the sudoers file. This script is a wrapper around vi that also does syntax checking when you save the file and won't let you overwrite a valid sudoers file with an invalid one.\nAdd a line like this:\nusername ALL= NOPASSWD: /path/to/your/script\n\nThe \"ALL=\" bears some elaboration, it specifies that the permission is granted when the user in question is logged in from any location, locally (console or terminal) or remotely (ssh, etc).\n\nA: For completeness sake, you can achieve a similar effect by setting setuid bit in the file's permissions. \nA slightly tricky part is that for security reasons setuid bit on scripts is ignored by the kernel, so you'll need to compile a small wrapper program in C and use it to invoke your script. Save this as runscript.c:\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <sys/types.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n\nint main()\n{\n   setuid( 0 );\n   system( \"/path/to/script.sh\" );\n\n   return 0;\n}\n\nthen compile it with\ngcc runscript.c -o runscript\n\nand set setuid bit on the executable:\nsudo chown root:root runscript\nsudo chmod 4755 runscript\n\nIt is also important to make sure your script is only writable by root, since everyone who can modify the script will be able to execute arbitrary programs:\nsudo chown root:root /path/to/script.sh\nsudo chmod 0711 /path/to/script.sh\n\nHere's an article I've got the wrapper program code from: setuid on shell scripts.\nSecurity-wise, both approaches - the one with sudo and the one with setuid - are pretty bad, but probably will be ok on a home machine. The difference is that every user in the system will be able to run a setuid command, even without being in the sudoers file. Also, obviously, you won't need to prefix the command with sudo.\n\nA: You need the \"NOPASSWD\" tag.\nUse visudo and set something like this at the end of the file:\nusername ALL=NOPASSWD: /bin/echo\nReplace username with your username, and /bin/echo with the command you want to run.\n\nA: You will need to add the full path to the program you're running to the sudoers file, not the script. I'm assuming it's pm-hibernate, so: \njohn ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/pm-hibernate\n\n", "Q: Can I update Ubuntu from a point release CD? I have Ubuntu 12.04 installed and I am using a mobile broadband connection, so bandwidth is precious. What I would like to do is to enable only security updates. \nThen when version 12.04.1 is released (which it already is), download it over a different connection (probably not on an Ubuntu machine) and burn it to disk, and then use it to update the system.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: The alternate CD is actually a mini-apt repository. You can download the point release alternate CD and then insert it into the machine while it is booted up, after burning it. \nThen go to Software Center-> Software Sources and use the Add Volume button to add the CD. \n\nImage credit Jorge Castro\nThis will work, but the CD does not contain every package which might be installed on your system, as it only contains what is needed to get a working system(except for some drivers). You still need to update any other packages you want to update using your internet connection(s). \nThe default packages (and a few more) will be updated to the point release version. These non-default packages were on the CD as they are commonly installed, but not installed by default. These may include common drivers.\nFor Quantal and later:\nQuantal no longer has an alternate CD. You can, however, use AptOnCD as follows:\nDownload aptoncd on a Ubuntu machine (of the same version and architecture(32/64-bit)) with a fast internet connection and install it:\nsudo apt-get install aptoncd\n\nAnd use the update manager to update packages. You can also select packages with:\nsudo apt-get install --download-only [packages]\n\nwhich should get packages and dependencies into the apt cache. You can then create an aptoncd CD and burn it with the packages it gives you from the selection. You can select any package that has been downloaded since the last sudo apt-get autoclean operation.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Won't Install On Custom Build Just built my first computer, trying to install Ubuntu, when I tell my BIOS to startup from disk drive it says :\n\n\"Please insert boot media into boot device\" \n\nSo I insert my burned disc and my computer thinks for a few seconds and then prompts me again.

I followed the instructions there, but they didn't really help: when I restarted the computer, it went straight to Windows without grub intervening at all (so it boots successfully, just not to the OS I want). This is the log from boot-repair. My Ubuntu partition is sda6.\nNaturally, I'm a  little worried, since the log says \"unknown filesystem type ''\", which to me looks like the partition might be corrupt somehow. From the Ubuntu Live CD, I started gparted and looked at my partitions, and it also told me that my sda6 is an unknown filesystem.\nSo my questions are basically:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I restore Ubuntu to the way it was?\n\n*If not, can I at least rescue the data I had on the partition somehow?\n\n*Again, if I can't restore Ubuntu, how do I clean everything up so that I can reinstall  it without too many complications?\nAnother thing I should mention is that yesterday I had a similar problem where the computer told me there was a problem with the hard drive when it was starting, but it fixed itself by running fsck (that time it got past grub, and managed to start Ubuntu). Between that occasion and me having trouble booting the computer today, I have booted it successfully at least twice.\nThanks for any help!\nEDIT: Since I got the popular question badge for this, I might as well add for anyone looking that the computer's hard drive was just broken and I had to replace it. I guess it was unsalvageable.\n\nA: I saw the boot-info you provided. \nThis is an attempt to fix the corrupted filesystem\nPossible data loss!!\nYou can apply this Only when you haven't any other options to rescue your data or to fix the problem\nBoot from a LiveCD/Usb of Ubuntu. Open a terminal and do\nsudo mke2fs -n /dev/sda6 \n\nThe /dev/sda6 partition is the partition where Ubuntu was installed and now is corrupted.\nAbove command will provide you with a list of Superblock backups stored on blocks \nTake one number from there (usually the first one) and then apply bellow command\nsudo e2fsck -y -b block_location /dev/sda6\n\nWhere block_location replace it with the (first) number from the results of Superblock backups stored on blocks\nWhen this finish , run the boot-repair program and select the [Recommended Repair] option.\nIf everything else fails\nAs a last resort you can re-install Ubuntu without format the partition. After all is about what ? 10-15 minutes.\nBoot from LiveCD-Usb and select install. Then at the installer window click on \"something else\" and then take a look at these two pictures and you will figure out what you must do.\n\n\n", "Q: TuxOnIce won't resume I'm trying to setup hibernate on my new rig, and I've gotten tuxonice working a few times, but then I had a failed hibernate, and sense then, I can't resume from a hibernate. TuxOnIce has the loading bar, and the text interface, and successfully brings the computer into hibernate. However when resuming from hibernate, the screen stays black, then displays random pixels everywhere, and hangs. I'm running it from command line with sudo pm-hibernate. I've tried setting resume=/dev/sda3 in /etc/default/grub followed by sudo update-grub, but it didn't make a difference.\nWhat am I doing wrong, or how can I successfully hibernate with a near 100% success rate?\nUPDATE 1\nI just looked at /etc/log/pm-suspend.log and here are the last two lines of the log file:\n/usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d/95hdparm-apm thaw hibernate: success.\nRunning hook /usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d/9\nFrom my limited knowledge, it looks to me like some sort of hand error in sleep.d. Is this the cause, and if so, what can I do to fix it?\n\nA: Could be an issue with your graphics driver. Is the regular hibernate working for you? What card and driver are you using? If you use proprietary drivers, try the open source ones. I had those glitches with Nvidia on my old laptop, but it properly resumed with the standard kernel. I have been successfully using TuxOnIce a few years ago, but wouldn't want to install a separate kernel image any longer.\nBy the way, you should specify resume via UUID in /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume and call update-initramfs -u and update-grub afterwards.\n", "Q: Slow Performance after fixing Geforce driver problem I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on Asus K43; Memory 5.8 G.B.; Processor Intel core i7 CPU@2.00 GHZx8; Graphics: GeForce GT 540m/pcie/ssf2; OS type: 64 bit and Disk 26.4 G.B.

I am sure the answers are out there, but alas there are too many answers (here and elsewhere) to other questions stopping me from finding them.  I just encountered something substantially similar to what is described at the closed SO question, sudo : “segmentation fault” Ubuntu maverick [closed].\nMy team is using Ubuntu 11.04 on VMWare Workstation 8.0.4.  We are doing development using c++, Xenomai, Qt, and Qt Creator.  When we simulate our application on the virtual machine, we currently need to launch Qt Creator with sudo.  My colleague mentioned today that he has been having issues where his workstation locks up and he needs to restart and that occasionally he has the issue that all sudo bash commands return \"segmentation fault\".\nI just ran our application in simulation mode.  I was running Qt Creator under sudo and Qt Creator received the signal abort (if I recall).  Afterward, every command executed with sudo from sudo qtcreator to sudo ls resulted in the message Segmentation fault.  I clicked on the power widget to see if I could log out, but the system shut down straightaway without prompting.\nMy understanding is that we run sudo because of a permissions issue with Xenomai and the VM as currently configured, but my colleague has a workaround for this.  I expect that not running Qt Creator under sudo -- something that has always made me nervous -- will help contain this issue, but I find it troubling that this could happen and manifest as it does.\nDoes anyone know what is happening?  Any recommendations on how to work around this issue?\nThis is happening often to I am trying tolobby for VM changes to be able to run the process without sudo.\n\nA: There is not a single answer to this problem other than it has probably to do with lack of memory. Try to see what free -m outputs and go from there. Adding swap space might solve the problem if you don't have enough.\n\nA: Check for oom's in dmesg, the VM might have run out of memory. \nAlmost all the time problems with such symptoms are somehow related to memory problems\n", "Q: Should I edit my resolv.conf file to fix wrong DNS problem? I have the problem that my Ubuntu machine uses the wrong DNS server. For some reason the machine queries localhost for DNS information.\nI have added the DNS server in the network settings GUI, but /etc/resolv.conf still contains 127.0.0.1 as the DNS server address. Now, I thought I could just edit the file by myself, but it explicitly says I should not edit the file by hand.\nNow, since the network settings GUI didn't generate the file with the right settings, how do I generate a new resolv.conf file by myself?\n\nA: What none of the answers posted so far addresses is the appearance that the questioner fails to understand that having nameserver 127.0.0.1 in /etc/resolv.conf is correct, assuming that a local nameserver is running. And in Ubuntu 12.04 Desktop there is, by default, a local nameserver running, namely, a dnsmasq process controlled by NetworkManager which listens on 127.0.0.1. In Ubuntu 12.10 the listen address has been changed to 127.0.1.1.\nSo the solution is not to make any changes to resolv.conf. It is correct, assuming that the questioner wants to use the local nameserver.\nIf name service is not working then the local nameserver is not being given correct forwarding addresses, or there is some other networking problem.\nThe questioner tried using the \"network settings GUI\" to \"generate the file with the right settings\" and this failed to work. I don't know exactly what this means, but here is the right way to enter nameserver addresses so that they end up in resolv.conf at the right time. I assume that the questioner is using NetworkManager and not ifup to configure interfaces. \nMost often interfaces are configured using the DHCP protocol. In that case nothing needs to be configured on the local system. The DHCP server knows what nameserver address its clients should use and sends this information to the DHCP client, which sends it to NetworkManager, which sends it to resolvconf, which puts the information into resolv.conf. So in this case it is the DHCP server that may need to be configured.\nIf the network interface on the local machine is statically configured then the correct nameserver addresses have to be entered into NetworkManager at, for example, network indicator | Edit Connections... | Wireless | myconnection | Edit... | IPv4 Settings | Additional DNS servers.\nIt is possible that the local nameserver is not working properly. In that case the questioner should edit /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf\nsudo gedit /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf\n\nand comment out the line\ndns=dnsmasq\n\nin the \"[main]\" section. To comment out the line, put a # at the beginning of the line, then save the file. Then restart network-manager.\nsudo restart network-manager\n\nAfter this, non-local nameserver addresses will be entered into resolv.conf instead of the 127.* address.\nIf the questioner is using ifup rather than NetworkManager to configure network interfaces then jmartin2279's answer is correct: you have to add the nameserver addresses to /etc/network/interfaces in the way jmartin2279 described.\nContrary to what some other answers advise, in general you should not add nameserver, domain or search options to files in /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/. See my comments on those answers.\n\nA: If you are using ifup to configure the interface statically then you can add it to the /etc/network/interfaces file.\nOpen a terminal and type:\nsudo gedit /etc/network/interface*\n\nYou should see something like:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nEdit to:\nauto eth0\niface eth1 inet static\naddress 192.168.1.10 \nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 192.168.1.1\ndns-nameservers 8.8.8.8\n\nusing your own network information. this will allow you to set the dns. you can use multiple dns servers here:\ndns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4\n\nAfter doing this, run\nifdown eth0\nifup eth0\n\n\nA: In Ubuntu 12.04 the handling of resolv.conf changed.\nIf you want to add your own nameserver address(es) then edit the file /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head\nsudo nano /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head\n\nand add your nameserver there (eg: Google open dns)\nnameserver 8.8.8.8\nsave the file and then run \nsudo resolvconf -u\n\nNo reboot or anything else. Maybe you will need to restart network-manager\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\nDone. \nYou can test it with the command \nnslookup www.google.com\nThe result must be similar to \nServer: 8.8.8.8\nAddress: 8.8.8.8#53\n\n\nA: To add more entries to /etc/resolv.conf, create a /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/tail file and add them there. \nBut if /etc/resolv.conf contains 127.0.0.1, then adding entries to /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/tail will not change anything. You have to set your DNS server addresses statically in NetworkManager which will send them to dnsmasq which listens on 127.0.0.1.\nThe DNS configuration for a static interface should go as “dns-nameservers”, “dns-search” and “dns-domain” entries added to the appropriate iface stanza in /etc/network/interfaces\nRead this for more information.\n`Moreover:\nYou can install a gui tool named gnome-network-admin that will set your DNS. Try it :\nsudo apt-get install gnome-network-admin\n\n", "Q: How to create rings when installing swift on ubuntu 12.04?

I am using Ubuntu 12.10 with 4G RAM. I have changed SWAP to 10 and installed Preload. However, My system only use less than 1G RAM to cache and It remains more than 2G RAM standby. \nHow can I use up all RAM by cache? By this, I want to speed up open and run applications.\nThank you.\n\nA: Don't worry about that. The cache optimizations run in the Linux kernel and trust me, when it becomes necessary to cache the data, it will be cached. Run the system for a few days and see what then happens.\nAlso note that the system has not precognitive powers and it can hardly cache your whole hard disk, so when you run a program for the first time, it will not be cached.\nIf you find yourself with too much free RAM on your hands and a specific application that relies on ultra low access and read times, you can always construct a RAM-disk. Normally, it is hardly worth an effort.\n\nA: One good use for your extra ram is to add the following line to /etc/fstab:\ntmpfs                       /tmp                    tmpfs mode=0777 0 0\n\nThis gives you storage for temporary files in RAM. Take care to have enough swap space (2x Ram) so that the /tmp file system can grow. \nNote: Files in /tmp are not expected to be preserved over reboot. So it's safe to do this. On the other hand, the directory /var/tmp MUST be preserved over reboots, so don't apply tmpfs to /var/tmp!!!\n\nA: In my opinion,your computer dont use your whole ram because it doesn't need whole of your ram.Or your cpu is not powerful to use your whole ram\n", "Q: How do I install Nautilus 3.6 in 12.10?

I initially installed Ubuntu Server on the USB drive as  a test but it has grown into a fully configured server.\nThe catch is that the server has no keyboard, monitor or dvd drive and is only accessible via ssh - so I think that makes something like Clonezilla unusable?\nApart from the USB drive there is also an internal HDD that contains a ZFS pool with a few bits on it and 2 more larger HDD on the way. I would like to move the USB drive setup to the current internal HDD and make it bootable, all using SSH.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: *\n\n*With the USB drive plugged in you can copy all of the files on the drive to, say, \\root\\, and be almost all set. You may be able to chroot into /root and check things out.\n\n*But now the tricky part, you need to rename /root to / and reboot simultaneously. You can't do the rename before the reboot because at that point your target system will no longer be intact--its file system won't match its kernel and environment and you can't do anything after the reboot is issued.\n\n*Further, it would be almost crazy to rename and reboot simultaneously as the system is unusable if the new software won't run that particular hardware--you will be dead in the water.\nThis is why serial consoles are used. I suggest that you spend a few bucks for a serial card and add it to the server. That way you can do the final work from there and back things out if you try things that don't work.\n\nAnother idea is to run your new system as a virtual machine on the old one.\n", "Q: Postgresql fails to start on Ubuntu 10.04.4 LTS I installed postgresql 9.2 from add-apt-repository ppa:pitti/postgresql using apt-get install postgresql-9.2\nAt the end of the install and every time I try to launch postgresql by using the following command\n/etc/init.d/postgresql start\n\nor\nservice postgresql start\n\nI get this error:\nError: could not exec /usr/lib/postgresql/9.2/bin/pg_ctl    \n/usr/lib/postgresql/9.2/bin/pg_ctl start -D /var/lib/postgresql/9.2/main -l \n/var/log/postgresql/postgresql-9.2-main.log -s -o  -c \nconfig_file=\"/etc/postgresql/9.2/main/postgresql.conf\" :\n                                                                    [fail]\ninvoke-rc.d: initscript postgresql, action \"start\" failed.\ndpkg: error processing postgresql-9.2 (--configure):\nsubprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1\nErrors were encountered while processing:\npostgresql-9.2\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\nI have tried everything found here: How to thoroughly purge and reinstall postgresql on ubuntu and here: Eliminating non working postgresql installations on ubuntu 10-04 and starting af.\nI have also done\ndpkg -P --force-remove-reinstreq postgresql-client-9.2\n\nin my attempt to remove everything postgres related from my server.\nAfter removing postgresql I have used  \ndpkg --get-selections | grep postg\n\nTo be sure there is nothing left and I can do a clean install.\nI have also made sure that the files and folders mentioned in the error message have the right permissions.

Is there an https download available of ubuntu ISOs?\n\nA: There is currently no official HTTPS mirror, which can be quickly determined by reviewing the HTML source code of https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+cdmirrors. The only HTTPS links are to other Launchpad sites, and any relative links obviously can't link to one of the mirrors.\nHowever, you can download by torrent, which is actually relatively secure. Torrents include hashes for chunks, and through use in various P2P uses, have been strengthened from bad data injection and detection attacks, and so are quite safe. \nWhile there may be unofficial HTTPS mirrors, they have the insecurity of being unofficial unless you get MD5 checksums from the official site and check these hashes with md5sum downloaded_file.iso on a machine which has the md5sum executable(any Ubuntu and most Linux, also Mac IIRC). You can also use a GUI hasher like md5summer for Windows, which is open-source.\n\nA: https://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu-releases\nTechnically the official mirrors page only lists mirrors.us.kernel.org and its brethren, but they return an SSL certificate for mirrors.kernel.org which your browser may not like.  \nOf course, regardless of where you download from, it's always a good practice to check hashes as in hexafraction's answer.\n", "Q: hp pavilion dm4-1160us black screen while booting \nPossible Duplicate:\nMy computer boots to a black screen, what options do I have to fix it? \n\nAfter installing Ubuntu 12.04 on hp pavilion dm4-1160US, it first boots by showing a purple screen and goes into a black screen.\nWhat could be happening please?\n\nA: when the purple screen showing press enter and its setup 9.10.Before installition start press F6 and there is a new menu.In the menu select \"nomodeset\" and setup ubuntu normally.\n", "Q: No Read/Write Permission as User on a Secondary Drive I have a 2nd hard drive that is used for data only, it has been formatted both in NTFS and FAT32, the system is dual booted with Windows so the Data drive is used to share data between Win and Ubuntu.\nHowever in Ubuntu with the user account set as limited user, I cannot do anything with the files, namely create files, edit names, move them, modify etc. But I can do all that fine with the Admin account.\nI've tried changing permissions, ownership, installing ntfs plugins etc. Nothing seems to work.

So it's better to use the first line of the file :\n#!/path/to/shell\n\nSo every time you execute your file it will be with the same shell.\nAnd for your second question, no, you need to make a script executable to run it : \nchmod +x file.sh\n\n", "Q: Messaging Menu missing after upgrade to 12.10 Upgraded from 12.04 to 12.10 today, and the messaging menu is missing. Might be because the only application that I use with the messaging menu is Pidgin. Is this an issue where pidgin has not been integrated with 12.10 ? \nI am assuming here that the messaging menu is hidden when no application is using it.\nWhat can I do to integrate pidgin with the messaging menu and get it back ?\n\nA: The way applications interact with the messaging menu was changed in 12.10, and not all applications have been updated. Pidgin (as of 20th Oct 2012) has not been updated. There is a ticket tracking what applications have been migrated. Until then Empathy could be used as an replacement.\n\nA: The messaging menu (normally in the top right) is turned off by default in 12.10. Simply open the \"Broadcast preferences\" application and check \"Start service at login\" to get it back.\nin 12.10 Pidgin has been replaced with Empathy, so you may have to set it up.\n\nA: There's a patch available for pidgin-libnotify on a ppa here.\nTo add it, open a terminal and enter the following:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:jconti/gnome3\n\nAfter you've entered your password, press enter and observe that the signing key matches 6E3AB2D3.

However you cannot use the keyboard shortcuts you have listed. I do not know the way to do that.\nIf you open the system settings menu navigate to keyboard layout. Once open you will see your current keyboard layouts. If you click options and select \"Key(s) to change layout, you can select which combo to change the layout. Some of the combos are\nAlt+Caps Lock\nAlt+Ctrl\nAlt+Shift\nBoth Alt keys together, etc.\nHowever thers is no way to set your own custom shortcuts. I attempted to see if there was possible a terminal code but there is no manual entry for Keyboard Layout settings, such as there is for other programs like Firefox: man firefoxIf there were you could easy create a custom key combo to run the command depending on which layout you want.\nAdditionally there is no indicator of which layout you've switched too and the only way to check is to type something. But it does seem to go in order of the way the layouts are listed. \n\nI hope that helps you.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open \"System Settings\" > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\"\n\n*Press \"+\" to create a new one\n\n*Add any name you like and the following command for the first layout:\n\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.input-sources current 0\n\n\n*Press \"Apply\"\n\n*Press on \"Disabled\" in right column for your key mapping\n\n*Assign your hot key\n\n\nScreenshot for step 3:\n\nScreenshot for step 5:\n\n\nA: The following solution works for Ubuntu 19.10.\ngdbus call --session --dest org.gnome.Shell --object-path /org/gnome/Shell --method org.gnome.Shell.Eval  \"imports.ui.status.keyboard.getInputSourceManager().inputSources[0].activate()\"\n\nTaken from here.\nSo just add key bindings you like with the index in the above command modified as desired (0 - your first layout, 1 - your second layout, and so on).\n", "Q: 'Failed to apply network settings When I restart my computer I found a strange error related to blue-tooth.

The file mp3/1-1 Song 1.mp3 begins mp3/, does not start with a numeric so it's not renamed.\nIs there a way I can read the directory and file values into separate variables or is there a better way of doing this?\nThanks\n\nA: find & sed:\n  I would ask you to first remove the pipe and sh at the end, and see whether the mv command is getting generated properly, and then you can run the command as such:\nfind $dir -type f | sed 's|\\(.*/\\)[^A-Z]*\\([A-Z].*\\)|mv \\\"&\\\" \\\"\\1\\2\\\"|' | sh\n\n\nA: Theres no need for a script, there's a one liner for that.\nTry this to see what it does (don't worry, this doesn't rename your files yet, see below):\nfind root_audio_path -type f -iname '*mp3' -execdir rename --no-act 's/^\\.\\/[\\d\\s\\-]+/\\.\\//' '{}' ';'\n\nRemove --no-act if it seems to work. This actually renames the files.\nThe -execdir option of find makes sure that rename is executed in the files directory, so the files paths always start  with ./ - for which we look for in rename.\nrename in Ubuntu actually perls rename, so you can use regular expressions there.\n\nA: The following will get you the path\necho \"wwww/www/mp3/1-1 Song 1.mp3\" | sed 's#\\(.*/\\)\\(.*\\)#\\1#g'\n/wwww/www/mp3/\n\nThe following will get you the file without the path:\necho \"wwww/www/mp3/1-1 Song 1.mp3\" | sed 's#\\(.*/\\)##g'\n1-1 Song 1.mp3\n\nYou will need a variable for the path, old and new filenames.

This would enable the integration without even installing a package and eases maintenance as well as making it easier for users to just use the integration without having to install anything.\n\nA: Once you have built in the support for Ubuntu webapps with site JavaScript, and a user launches your site, Ubuntu will offer to install the site as a webapp. If that is chosen, an icon for the site will appear in the launcher, which can be locked in the launcher if desired (as for all other applications).\nFor example I launched timer-tab.com with Firefox (for some reason it didn't work right away with the Chrome browser when that was my default browser), I was offered a choice to install the timer-tab webapp. I said yes and locked it to my launcher.

Before I had this encrypted setup, I used to have my hibernation enabled. I found this documentation on how to enable hibernation with an encrypted swap. \nNow the thing that bothers me by using the solution as given in the documentation, is that apart from having to type my password to login to my user account, I have to type separately a password to mount my swap partition. \nA possible solution to this is (is it?) to enable my user account to automatically login (so as to skip the login screen) and view the mounting of the swap partition as an alternative login screen. Note that I am the only user of my laptop. \nThe only drawback to this method is that after 3 password attempts the system anyway continues booting, though without mounting the swap partition. Leaving my desktop freely available to anybody. \nAs I would like to use hibernation while having only to type my password once at startup, my question thus is whether it be possible to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Or make the password-attempt count infinite\n\n*or alternatively let the system reboot itself after three attempts (starting the cycle over again)\n\n\nand if this is possible \n\n\n*\n\n*whether it would pose a security breach not thought of by me\n\n\nand if not possible: Whether there would be another creative alternative allowing me and other users to use hibernate in combination with encryption without having to type two pass phrases at boot. \nThank you very much for any help!\n\nA: The suggestion:\nYou could just create 2 partitions on your disk.\n\n\n*\n\n*a small partition to hold /boot (unencrypted)\n\n*the rest of the disk, to be used as a physical volume for encryption.\n\n\nI'd then configure encryption on the second partition and use LVM to created 2 volumes:\n/dev/vg0/root and\n/dev/vg0/swap\nAdvantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*You don't have to worry about encrypting individual partitions.\n\n*Apart from /boot which holds your kernel, everything else is encrypted. Which protects you from someone rebooting your machine, entering a single user mode and modifying your OS to allow them to easily get your data from your encrypted home anyway.\n\n*You only enter the encryption key once per boot.\n\n*I know you said you're the only user but you could add separate passphrases (key slots) for other users if you had to.\n\n\nAs to the other part of your question: I don't remember if this method asks repeatedly for the password and I don't think this by itself would be a security risk, as long as there's a delay after an incorrect password is given (to thwart brute-force attacks).\nHow it's done:\nI never use the GUI for installation and apparently you cannot use it to create an LVM on top of LUKS-encrypted block device.\nThe workaround I've tested:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the netboot ISO image for amd64 or i386 and burn it onto a CD.\n\n*When you boot from it, choose 'Install' from the menu\n\n*Answer a few basic questions, create a non-root user, and choose NOT to encrypt the home directory. This isn't what we want here.\n\n*When you get to the 'Partition disks' dialog, choose 'Manual'.\n\n*Create an empty partition table on the disk if you need to and then 2 primary partitions.\n*\n*first primary partition for /boot and make it 512MB. This is where\nyour kernel and initrd images will reside and will remain\nunencrypted.\n*second primary partition to cover the remaining\nspace and choose its type as 'physical volume for encryption'.\n\n\n*Proceed to Configure encrypted volumes, save the changes and encrypt /dev/sda2, choose a password and finish. At this point you'll have an encrypted volume sda2_crypt\n\n*Choose to use it as a physical volume for LVM\n\n\n*Proceed to configure the Logical Volume Manager. Create a volume group vg0 on /dev/mapper/sda2_crypt\n\n*Create 2 logical volumes within that group. \n*\n*swap - however large you need it to be (I chose 1GB)\n*root - use the remaining space\n\n*At this stage, you should see the following configuration:\n\n\n*Choose an FS for your root logical volume and configure it to be mounted as / and  the swap LV to be used as swap space:\n\n\n*Write changes to disk and proceed with the installation.\n\n*Later on you'll be asked which packages to install (tasksel) and you can safely go with ubuntu-desktop\n\n*When asked where to install Grub to, I chose MBR since I don't have any other OSes on my machine.\n\n\nAnd that's really one of the few reasons I always choose the netboot images.

(I think so because I got an IP for eth0, and I can ping other stuff on the local network, but I cannot get access to the internet).\nMy eth0-specific info in /etc/network/interfaces: \nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet static\n  address 10.0.1.1\n  netmask 255.255.255.0\n  network 10.0.1.0\n  broadcast 10.0.1.255\n  gateway 10.0.1.1\n  mtu 8192\n\n\nauto eth2\niface eth2 inet static\n  address 10.0.2.1\n  netmask 255.255.255.0\n  network 10.0.2.0\n  broadcast 10.0.2.255\n  gateway 10.0.2.1\n  mtu 8192\n\nMy /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server: \nINTERFACES=\"eth1 eth2 eth3 eth4\"\n\nSo why does my local DHCP-server mess up the gateway for eth0, when I tell it not to listen to eth0? Anyone see the problem or what I can do to fix it?\nThe problem seems indeed to be the gateways. netstat -nr gives: \n0.0.0.0 --- 10.X.X.X ---- 0.0.0.0 --- UG 0 0 0 eth3\n\nIt should have been \n0.0.0.0 129.2XX.X.X 0.0.0.0 UG 0 0 0 eth0\n\nSo for some reason, my local DHCP-server overrides the gateway I get from the network DHCP.\nEdit: dhcp.conf looks like this(I included info only for eth1 subnet): \nddns-update-style none;\n\nnot authoritative;\n\nsubnet 10.0.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 { interface eth1; \noption domain-name \"example.org\"; \noption domain-name-servers ns1.example.org, \nns2.example.org; \ndefault-lease-time 600; \nmax-lease-time 7200;\nrange 10.0.1.10 10.0.1.100;\nhost camera1_1 { hardware ethernet 00:30:53:11:24:6E; fixed-address 10.0.1.10; }\nhost camera2_1 { hardware ethernet 00:30:53:10:16:70; fixed-address 10.0.1.11; } \n}\n\nAlso, it seems that the gateway is correctly set if I run /etc/init.d/networking restart in a terminal, but that's not helpful for me, I need the correct gateway to be set during startup, and I'd rather find the source of the problem\n\nA: I'm hardly any kind of expert on this subject, but I suspect that because of the broadcast nature of DHCP packets, your local DHCP server is always going to answer locally originating requests regardless of the listening interfaces that you configured.\nSo I would suggest you try simply setting \"reject\" statements in your dhclient.conf to reject offers from the local server:\nreject 10.0.1.1;\nreject 10.0.2.1;\n\n(I'm only guessing that you can use multiple reject statements, man page is unclear.)\nI can think of some other things to try also, but I might be wrong in my initial assumption anyway. I always find this a useful tool to diagnose what is happening:\napt-get install dhcpdump\ndhcpdump -i eth1\n\nPS: If you want to keep eth0, eth1, eth2 etc. properly separated, consider using VLANs to isolate traffic at layer 2.\n\nA: You should only have one default gateway on your computer.  And it should go to a router that going toward the border or out of your network.  You could always use ip route list to see which routers you have.\nSo there are actually two errors in each of your eth1 and eht2 stanza in /e/n/interfaces.\n\n\n*\n\n*You should not have a gateway directive pointing at itself. If your machine doesn't know where to send a packet with an unknown IP-address, why should you tell it to forward that packet to itself?  So you should never point a gateway to itself.\n\n*You should only have one (or none) default gateway in your machine. And that should point outside.  The interface to the outside is on eth0, and that is getting the gatway from dhcp. So no need to set gateway here.\n\n\nSo, remove all gateway dirctives from /e/n/interfaces and it will work (better).\nAnd by the way, both network and broadcast are calculated from address and netmask, so you don't need to specify them. It actually can create some strange errors if you get them wrong, so you are better of not specify them.

I am wondering if I am going to do any harm to my virtual system if I save it's state and close the VM while it is in the middle of a dist-upgrade?\nAfaik saving the state allows you to resume it with the system being unaware that anything has even happened, so am I safe to Save state and close?\n\nA: EDIT: Sorry, I misunderstood the question and thought you were going to upgrade the host \nsystem.\nIf the update is interrupted in your VM, and it isn't able to resume, you might have to do a\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nto resolve some dependency issues before continuing with\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nIf the dist-upgrade is still in the stage of downloading the new packages, I would simply stop it by issuing CTRL C. The already downloaded packages stay in apts cache and there won't be any unresolved conflicts.\nOld answer (thought OP is upgrading the host system):\nThat won't be a problem - the virtual system is isolated from the host system and has no clue if there was an upgrade.\nHowever, you might have to update the guest additions in your virtual system to ensure nice integration with the host.\n\nA: The only problem you might encounter is if the virtual networking times out when offline due to the save/restore.\nFor example, if the save state occurs when a file is partially downloaded, the remote site will probably reset the connection and hence the download may fail. If this occurs, then the dist-upgrade will fail after the download stage, but can simply be restarted and it will just download anything it failed to get the first time before actually starting the upgrade.\nIf all downloads are complete and the system is simply installing/updating files, then there shouldn't be a problem.\n", "Q: No results in Music lens!

Safer would be to create a systemwide alias. Open terminal: Ctrl+Alt+T, then type:\nalias rm='rm -i'\n\nSo you get prompted before wiping out all your vacation photo's by accident.  The second recommendation I would like to add is to use rmdir , it will complain about non-empty directories and that is exactly what you want as a newbee.\nBut in the sense of the question, the answer is as given here already, use -f to erase a folder.\n\nA: Be sure the folder is really empty (hidden files/folders might be in there). Look at the file contents again with\nsudo ls -lha /path/\n\nIf you're absolutely certain that it doesn't contain anything you want to have (including subdirectories), delete it with\nsudo rm -r -f /path/\n\n\n\n*\n\n*-r is for recursive, so it will delete the folder and subfolders, even if it is non-empty\n\n*-f is for force (this might be unnecessary).\n\n\nA: If you would like to delete the contents and overwite the data on your drive try using shread.

I have installed Ubuntu 11.10 in my machine. I have logged in as USER_A.

I followed the steps explained in http://www.ghacks.net/2010/04/21/join-a-ubuntu-machine-to-a-windows-domain/ and was successful in joining my ubuntu machine to the windows domain. \nsudo apt-get install likewise-open5\nsudo domainjoin-cli join DOMAIN USER_B\n\nNow when I logged in as USER_B, there is no audio for this user in the same machine.\nI crossed check with my User_A account. There is no issues with the sound for User_A. Only for User_B, there is no audio.\nWhen I checked the sound settings of User_B, there is no device listed in Hardware, Input and Output. Whereas for User A, my Headset is listed in Input and Output.\nCan anyone please help me on this. Why there is no sound for User_B?\nCan you please brief me a little more on how to 'Check whether users are added or not in the audio group'.\nAnd also when I tried to execute pulseaudio -k in a terminal (from User_B)\nE: [pulseaudio] main.c: Failed to kill daemon: No such process\n\nAnd also I have found this on pulse audio log.

It may need be extended later.\n\nIn case we have sound for one user only we may have some bad configuration in this one user account's setting. We need to take the following steps from the affected user account to get further insights into the problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is pulseaudio running at all?\nUsually you will see that from having access to the sound menu in the top bar. Alternatively we can issue the following command in a terminal:\npulseaudio -k\n\nThere will be an error in case pulseaudio does not run. In addition this command takes care of stopping and respawning pulseaudio in case it hangs.\n\n*Are there wrong user settings for the pulseaudio daemon?\nTo test this we have to rename the settings directory in the affected user's HOME followed by a restart of pulseaudio (see 1.):  \nmv ~/.pulse ~/.pulse.bad\n\nor\nmv ~/.config/pulse ~/.config/pulse.bad  ## for newer releases\n\n\n*Are channels muted from ALSA?\nWe may open the alsamixer in a terminal to adjust channel volumes, and to unmute a channel in case it was accidentally muted:\nalsamixer\n\n\n*Make sure users are not in the 'audio' group\nA user in the audio group has exclusive access to the pulseaudio server. Other users can not access it while this user uses it. Therefore user should not be in the audio group.\n\n*Start Pulseaudio manually\nIn case pulseaudio was not running we can also start the daemon from command line with\npulseaudio -D\n\nPulseaudio then uses default settings and starts it's daemon. We can also put this command to our Autostart Applications to overcome the case when pulseaudio fails to run before the desktop was loaded.\n\n*Browse log files\nPulseaudio will be loaded on system start up, and on user login. Therefore errors can only be read from a log generating on starting pulseaudio. See this guide on how to generate a pulsaudio log script. In short, we have to take care pulseaudio does not  respawn we may run it in verbose mode:\npulseaudio -vvvv <options>\n\nto be completed\n\nIn the case given in the question we could see that pulseaudio fails to run because it was unable to start the D-Bus service. This may likely be caused by a broken or overlong path to the user's HOME (see bug #872992). As a workaround we may issue pulseaudio without D-Bus control by commenting out the following line in /etc/pulse/default.pa like this:\n# load-module module-dbus-protocol\n\nHowever then we (and our applications) will not be able to control pulseaudio using D-Bus.\n", "Q: Can I turn off the message at the bottom from mails generated by Ubuntu One-Thunderbird integration?

It looks like there are several symbols used for some commands and that is throwing me for a loop.\n\nA: So there's two forms of notification, one for Byobu's screen backend, and the other for Byobu's tmux backend.\nThe screen backend uses GNU Screen's syntax, as described in its manpage, while the tmux backend uses Tmux's syntax, as described in its manpage.\nFor screen, when I want to create a new keybinding, I usually open up a new terminal window outside of Byobu, and type:\n$ cat >/dev/null\n\nAnd then type some key combination, for instance Ctrl-Shift-F7, and you should see on the screen:\n^[[18;6~\n\nThat's the key code that you would need to put into your ~/.byobu/keybindings.screen.\nYou'll use the bindkey command, and you'll want to bind that to one or more commands, as described in the screen manpage.\nFor tmux, the syntax is way easier!

How do I do that?\n\nA: This is a \"problem\" with the new Windows 8 feature \"Hybrid boot\" or \"fast startup\". \nDue to make Windows startup very fast Microsoft integrated this feature to Windows 8 and by default Windows are not shutdown (as always) but hibernate. \nThis is not Ubuntu's problem. I mean if the system (with Windows) is hibernated of course cannot mount it , so you cannot have any access. \nLook here on how To Turn \"Fast Startup\" On or Off in System Settings in Windows 8.\nProbably this will solve your problem.\n\nA: You're running Ubuntu and try to access the hard drive which contains the Windows 8 installation, correct?\nIf so, the problem lies with Windows 8's policy of not shutting down properly. I believe there are options to make it actually shut down instead of hibernating (as the error tells you). I'd consult the Windows help on that, though.\nUbuntu is trying to avoid changing data on the secondary drive while Windows is still running, as it might corrupt the Windows installation. You're prompted to open it via read-only access:\nmount -r /dev/sda1\n\nIn which case you won't have writing access, however, obviously.\n\nA: And after you do disable the fast startup and boot into Linux again, you might find that you cannot manually mount it.

I have windows on one, and wish to install Ubuntu on the other through Wubi. Also, I have 16 GB RAM.\nWhen I installed Ubuntu, the acutal space in the home directory was very low. How do I partition, in order to utilize all the 465 GB of my hard drive? \nAlso, can I utilize all 16 GB for either Windows or Ubuntu (coz I never run both simultaneouly)\nAppreciate your help!\n\nA: To fully utilize your second hard drive for Ubuntu you should use a full install from a live CD/USB rather than a WUBI install. WUBI will put Ubuntu in a virtual partition in a big file inside Windows partition. Even though WUBI is easier as you don't have to partition your hard drive, it has some disadvantages. For example, if the Windows partition gets corrupted, Ubuntu won't boot. \nAs with full install and WUBI install, you can only use either Ubuntu or Windows at any time. You will be able to choose between Ubuntu and Windows every time you boot the computer. To switch between the two you have to reboot the computer and choose the other OS. \nInstallation\n\n\n*\n\n*First download the ISO file then burn it to a CD/DVD or use Unetbootin to get a bootable USB, select the Installation media to boot first from your BIOS.\n\n*Once you're in the Live Session, choose Install Ubuntu.\n\n*When you get to the Choose an Option screen, select Do Something Else.\n\n*Locate the Second drive and choose to Install the System on the second drive.\n\n*Choose to also install the bootloader on the 2nd drive, make sure it's the drive and not a partition (i.e. /dev/sdb and not /dev/sdb1). I am assuming sdb is your second hard drive. It may not be, check to be sure.\n\n*Set the BIOS to boot from the UBUNTU hard drive first, and Windows\nsecond.\n\n*Boot Ubuntu and open a terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T and type sudo update-grub\nThe last step should find the Windows in the first drive and update Grub accordingly and from next boot,you should be able to choose between Ubuntu and Windows.\nSee How to install ubuntu on a second hard drive with windows being on the first?\n/Home\nI recommend you make\n\n\n*\n\n*One 30GB / partition format ext4\n\n*One 4GB Swap partition format Linux/Swap\n\n*Rest of the drive as /home partition format ext4\n\n\n16GB RAM\nUbuntu should be able to use all the RAM irrespective of your choice of 32bit (PAE) or 64bit version.

Leave all settings default. Then, go to the Filezilla administration interface:\n\nand enter the Users dialog. Add a user, remembering the username and password, and give it a directory on the Shared Folders tab.

I will quote the initial setup portion.\nPartial Quote\nConfiguration\nTo enable support for dynamic SolrCore administration, place a file named solr.xml in the solr.home directory. Here is an example solr.xml file:\n<solr persistent=\"true\" sharedLib=\"lib\">\n <cores adminPath=\"/admin/cores\">\n  <core name=\"core0\" instanceDir=\"core0\" />\n  <core name=\"core1\" instanceDir=\"core1\" />\n </cores>\n</solr>\n\nYou can also specify properties in solr.xml which can be used in the solrconfig.xml and schema.xml files.\n<solr persistent=\"true\" sharedLib=\"lib\">\n <property name=\"snapshooter\" value=\"/home/solr-user/solr/bin/snapshooter.sh\" />\n <cores adminPath=\"/admin/cores\">\n  <core name=\"core0\" instanceDir=\"core0\">\n    <property name=\"dataDir\" value=\"/data/core0\" />\n  </core>\n  <core name=\"core1\" instanceDir=\"core1\" />\n </cores>\n</solr>\n\nThe properties can be container scope (i.e. specified after < solr > but outside of a < core > element) in which case it is automatically inherited by each core. Therefore, they can be used in any of the cores' configuration files.\nThe properties can also be defined in a core's scope (inside the < core > element) in which case they can be used only in that core's scope. If a property by that name already exists in the container scope then it will be overridden.\nBesides them, a few properties are automatically added in the core scope. They are:\nsolr.core.name -- The core's name as defined in solr.xml\n\nsolr.core.instanceDir -- The core's instance directory (i.e. the directory under which that core's conf/ and data/ directory are located)\n\nsolr.core.dataDir -- The core's data directory (i.e. the directory under which that core's index directory are located)\n\nsolr.core.configName -- The name of the core's config file (solrconfig.xml by default)\n\nsolr.core.schemaName -- The name of the core's schema file (schema.xml by default) \n\nSuch properties can be used inside solrconfig.xml and schema.xml files by specifying an expression with optionally, a default value.\n// Without a default value\n${snapshooter}\n// With a default value\n${snapshooter:./solr/bin/snapshooter.sh}\n\nThe above expression will evaluate to the value specified in solr.xml for the property name \"solr.snapshooter\". If no value is defined in solr.xml, it will check if a system property by that name exists otherwise it will use the specified default value. If no default value is specified, a runtime exception will be thrown and the core may fail to startup. \n", "Q: Do dconf use EXI binary XML? A question came to my mind reading an answer to the question What are the differences between gconf and dconf?.\nIn an reply to the above question, Oli said:\n\nBinary read access is far faster than parsing XML.\n\nHowever, there exist a W3C recommendation for binary XML, since 2010: Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) Format 1.0. Is this what dconf uses? If Yes, where is it confirmed? If No, was there some investigations toward it at some time, and what was the conclusions?\nThanks for any tracks, I'm curious to know.\n\nA: The dconf database is a binary stored in /home/user/.config/dconf/user and, at least on my system is only 16kb in size. Management of the database and custom locations are discussed at the  gnome site, although the discussion is mainly useful as background information as normally it is not necessary to modify any of the dconf options or database location.\nHowever, in the discussion it mentions the \n\nbinary dconf (GVDB) database format\n\nand again on the gnome site  the database is described as being a single compact binary format, and so it doesn't appear to have anything to do with EXI XML binaries. \nIt is possible to substantiate this point by searching through the Gnome mailing lists.

With idle use like internet browsing, the cpu fan speeds up a lot and i can feel very hot air coming from the vent (comparable to playing serious 3d game in windows). But it will not go to a point of freeze and shutdown. But as long as im using it, with no intensive tasks at all, the laptop stays too hot. This wasn't the case with windows7. In windows 7 the fan will not rotate at all with normal use.\nI heard there was manufacturing defect with some acer laptops, but i think it wasn't the case with my laptop since windows7 runs perfectly.\nI updated the bios to latest version. I cleaned dust in the vents. I tried kubuntu 12.04 up-to-date. Nothing solved the issue. \n\n\n*\n\n*My laptop specs are:\n\n*CPU : AMD turion2 x2 M500 @ 2.2GHz\n\n*GPU : AMD Mobility Radeon HD4570 \n\n*3GB RAM and 320GB hard disk.     *EDIT : * If it helps, my laptop was shipped with LINPUS LINUX.\n\n\nA: I guess i found something. It overheats when using the open source radeon driver. After installing fglrx and setting the power save option in catalyst control center there seems to be major difference. \n\nA: The overheating I don't think is 100% due to driver/OS support. Ours was overheating and freezing in Windows 7 a while back. We ended up replacing the laptop anyways since my wife was using it a lot more than we anticipated so we wanted something a little more robust. Recently I took the 5542G out to see if I could get it up and running with Windows 8 and also to see if would work well enough for our 4 year old daughter. Needless to say, it was still overheating in W8. \nAfter a bit of research, it looks like the main culprit was the heatsink was lifting off of the CPU/GPU due to bad thermal compound. I found a service manual online (don't have the link handy unfortunately), took the laptop apart, cleaned the old paste off and replaced it with some Arctic Silver. Reseated the heatsink, put it all together, and it seemed to do the trick. Before doing all that, I was hitting temps over 90C while idle. Now, I'm getting closer to 40C and not much higher under load. \n\nA: Certa vez li em um forum que este problema ocorre com o desenvolvimento da gestão de energia do Ubuntu.\nTenho o mesmo notebook e o mesmo problema.\nVamos aguardar para ver se um dia alguem resolve.\n", "Q: Ubuntu detect 4 CPUs and i have only 2 CPU's? I have an Acer Aspire One D270 Netbook with \n\n\n*\n\n*2GB RAM \n\n*320GB HDD \n\n*Intel Atom N2600 1.6 Ghz (2 cores)\n\n\nand I have a problem of overheating because Ubuntu 12.04 detects 4 CPUs.\nDo you know how to fix that?\n\nA: Ubuntu is just detecting the two logical cores per physical one the atom chip exposes because of Intel's hyper-threading technology. \nThe best way to disable this is through the BIOS settings, by pressingF1/F2/F10 (or the specific key for your machine should it differ) when your computer manufacturer's logo shows at boot and disabling it from there. On my netbook hyper-threading is on the 'Advanced' page of the BIOS setup. Now only two cores will be available to the OS.\nIf you cannot disable HT from the BIOS settings you can do so from within the OS by creating a script and having it run when the computer starts.\n1. Create the script:\nI got the script we'll be using here. I will add it below as well so you don't need to move between two browser tabs.\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Be careful to not skip the space at the beginning nor the end\nCPUS_TO_SKIP=\" $(cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/topology/thread_siblings_list | cut -d '-' -f 1 | sort | uniq | tr \"\\r\\n\" \"  \") \"\n\n\nfor CPU_PATH in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu[0-9]*; do\n    CPU=\"$(echo $CPU_PATH | tr -cd \"0-9\")\"\n    echo \"$CPUS_TO_SKIP\" | grep \" $CPU \" > /dev/null\n    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then\n        echo 0 > $CPU_PATH/online\n    fi\ndone\n\nCopy this into gedit and save it somewhere as disable_ht.sh.\n2. Install the script:\nOpen a terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T and navigate to where you saved the script from earlier using cd $location. Now run the following on the file you saved:\nsudo cp disable_ht.sh /usr/local/bin\nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/disable_ht.sh\n\n3. Set the script to run at boot:\nHit Alt+F2 and type gksudo gedit /etc/rc.local\nMake this file look like this one:\n#!/bin/sh -e\n#\n# rc.local\n#\n# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.\n# Make sure that the script will \"exit 0\" on success or any other\n# value on error.\n#\n# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution\n# bits.\n#\n# By default this script does nothing.\n#\n# Add this line right above the 'exit':\n/usr/local/bin/disable_ht.sh\nexit 0\n\nClick Save and exit, and now when you boot your computer into ubuntu hyper-threading will be disabled.\n\nA: The laptop is not overheating because you computer detects 4 cpu. It's normal that it detects 4 cpu, your dual-core cpu has hyperthreading meaning that on CPU can process instructions on 2 parallel threads, thus each core acts like two (although the real speed gain is not double)..\nThe laptop is overheating because some component is being heavily used (Video card, CPU), and this is probably because you have stock drivers and one of them is not the ideal one.\nI had similar issue on my desktop, my video card was being throttled to the maximum in Ubuntu 16.04, until I replaced the stock driver and installed the proper nVidia drivers.\nIn Windows 7 you don't have this issue as it has/had the proper drivers.\n", "Q: Can't find 2nd hard drive in ubuntu My computer has 2 drives, an 30 GB SSD with Ubuntu 12.04 installed on it, and a second 500 GB HDD for storage. I've checked all my BIOS settings, and searched through Ubuntu, and I can't figure out how to access my HDD on Ubuntu.\n\nA: I assume that you cannot access the secondary, 500GB drive.\nOpen a terminal emulator and verify that the disk is recognized by the kernel:\negrep 'sd[a-z]' /proc/partitions\n\nYou'll probably see sda[0-9] and the second disk should usually be detected as sdb, but that depends on what other usb-storage devices are connected.\nIf the above command shows anything other that sda[0-9], try this\nblkid | egrep 'sd[a-z]'\n\nThis will print a list of disks and/or partitions (depending on how your disks are configured) their UUIDs, file system types and labels (if applicable).\nIf you need more help, please paste output from those commands.\n", "Q: How can I automate ddrescue from a failing usb hard drive? I've got an interesting problem... \nA friend asked me to recover data from a failing external (usb) hard drive, which i've been doing using the ddrescue utility. However, every few hours the drive stops responding (this is why I'm recovering the data) and read speed drops to 0. At this point if i unplug it for 5 mins and plug it back in I can rerun the ddrescue and continue recovering. Im wondering if there is some way to automate this as the read speed is quite slow and there is a lot of data to recover.\nI can power down the drive using:\nudisks --unmount /dev/sdd1\nudisks --detach /dev/sdd\n\nBut I have not found a way to spin up the drive again after its been \"detached\"\nThe other problem I havent figured out yet is some way to figure out when the read speed has dropped to 0 and its time to do this powercycle.\nAnyone have any ideas? \n\nA: You could try usbctl or uhubctl.\nBoth tools are able to switch off/on usb ports if your usb chipset supports that.\nAfter you switch off and on the port with the external disk, it should be recognized again.\nTo automate this, one could either monitor process activity with lsof or similar or just simple watch the growing size of the output image file and if size does not change after some time, pkill ddrescue once, wait until it terminated itself, then power off/on the disk and restart the ddrescue process.\n", "Q: Can't install Catalyst 12.8 \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat is the correct way to install ATI Catalyst Video Drivers? \n\nI can not install fglrx ATI drivers/Catalyst 12.8.

However now I no longer have the ability to access the BIOS. I tried the usual FN+F2, F2,F1,Del,Tab,F12,F11; all to no avail. I was wondering is there something different to be done running Ubuntu? I know that the BIOS would generally not be affected by the OS.\nDoes anyone have any suggestions?\n\nA: The default option for the U410 to enter the BIOS is Fn+F2 if it is in hotkey mode. \nIf it is in legacy mode you need to use F2.   Ubuntu should not change this at all.  Have you tried doing a cold boot and hitting Fn+F2 or F2?\nNote: You need to do this very early. If you see the Lenovo text logo, it's probably too late. Your best bet is to probably force restart (with OS) and, holding down Fn, keep tapping the F2 key.\n", "Q: Windows7 Gone after Ubuntu dual boot install I had a very hard time to dual boot install Ubuntu 12.04\nApparently, Ubuntu has restriction of 4 partitions and I already had 4, so it just couldn't recognise my partitions.

However, I was getting the \"Windows has recovered from an unexpected shutdown. . .\" \nI was given the option to either start in safe mode or start windows normally. Safe mode didn't work. I played the game a bit. I kept selecting windows on the boot screen and telling it to start windows normally. It took 10-11 tries (I was kinda stubborn.) But one of the times windows actually loaded. Once I got windows to load successfully once, I haven't had too much trouble with this again. I have been running both windows and Ubuntu successfully for about two weeks. \nI would recommend being vigilant and just continuing to try to load windows repeatedly. If you can get it to load successfully once, then you shouldn't have too much trouble after that. \nI hope this helps. \n\nA: Ubuntu doesn't have restriction of 4 partition. It is the dos partition table who poses this restriction. \nMax 4 primary partition can be in a system. If you make one of them as extended partition, you can create many logical partition inside that and ubuntu can be installed in logical partition. Read more here\n\n\n*\n\n*I recommend you to get a back up of all files. \n\n*Use a bootable partition manager tool like EASEUS partition manager. \n\n*Create a new layout like this partition table\n\n*If you have  your data in one of those partition, you can easily convert it to extended without any data loss. \n\n\nPost a screenshot of your current partition table for more help.\n", "Q: How do you write a macro for a special character in LibreOffice?

If you look in windows, you will find that the nvidia card is not the primary card that actually connects to the LCD.  In windows, programs that are made to use graphics acceleration will use the nvidia GPU and memory if configured correctly.  This method of working is a hybrid situation (see http://www.nvidia.com/object/optimus_technology.html ) I think the idea is to save power on the laptop by only using the GPU when necessary. \nI've found this project which aims to provide the ability to use 3D acceleration in linux: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee It has all the instructions on there to set it up in Ubuntu. \nHopefully that will solve your problem.\n\nA: Have a look here:\nAfter nvidia driver update screen is 640x480.

The Intel card can handle normal use of the computer.\nRead more about Bumblebee and how to install it here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee\nAfter install you need to run\noptirun program to use your Nvidia card, everything else use the Intel card.\nYou must remove the installed Nvidia drivers before installing Bumblebee because Bumblebee install whats needed.\nIt works great for me, hopes it do it for you too.\n", "Q: Which Java version should I target for 12.04 installations? I am considering developing a Java application for Ubuntu. The page https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java doesn't say which (if any) comes by default.\nAlso, I know many people change their Java version to run applications like Minecraft.\nWhat version are people running - or is Java just a poor choice?\n\nA: The default version in 12.04 is OpenJDK 6 (openjdk-6-jre, aka default-jre) (although OpenJDK 7 is installable). The default in 12.10 is OpenJDK 7.\nOpenJDK is an open-source implementation of the Java specification. It is generally fully compatible with the \"official\" Oracle/Sun Java implementation (but there are a few edge cases where parts of the original JDK were licence encumbered, eg with fonts where the implementations can slightly differ). This question discusses the issue a bit.\nUnless there are features in Java 7 you really want to use, I would recommend targeting OpenJDK 6, which should work with the vast majority of Java installations, both on Ubuntu and other platforms.\n", "Q: VIM does not detect syntax of .ssh/config On a plain Ubuntu installation (12.04 in my case) when I have no ~/.vimrc VIM does not detect syntax of .ssh/config.\nSyntax highlighting works, but it does not set the correct filetype.\nvi ~/.ssh/config\n  :set syn?\n  >syntax=conf\n\nWhen I do:\nset syn=sshconfig\n\nThen the syntax highlighting is as it should be.\nWhy isn't the filetype automatically identified?

Now in October 2017 Ogg Opus files have become much more mainstream and there are several good choices under Ubuntu to allow tagging of your Ogg Opus files.\nI detail 3 methods below that I would personally recommend:\n1. EasyTag\nA modern version of EasyTag can tag Ogg Opus files.\nEdit: As has been pointed out this is less of a good idea as there is an unresolved issue with broken tagging of Ogg Vorbis files. In my experience the safe version of EasyTag for Ogg Vorbis is 2.4.2 and this version has given me personally no issues.\nFirst install EasyTag:\nsudo apt-get install easytag\n\nThen open your Ogg Opus file with EasyTag for tag editing! A screenshot from my own system seen below:\n\nOther good choices could be PuddleTag or Kid3...\n2. Creating tags as you encode with Opusenc:\nIf you prefer the command line you can create your tags as you encode your files using opusenc. Install this utility by running the following:\nsudo apt-get install opus-tools\n\nThe command line that I used to create my test file is as follows:\nopusenc --bitrate 128 \\\n        --artist \"Jody Marie Gnant\" \\\n        --title \"Lucky Night\" \\\n        --date \"1995\" \\\n        --album \"Treasure Quest Soundtrack\" \\\n        --genre \"Soundtrack\" \\\n        luckynight.wav luckynight.opus\n\nMore tags are available to add to the syntax above and all can be seen by running opusenc -h from the command line.\n3. Ripping audio CDs to Ogg Opus + tagging\nAgain if you are keen on the command line and you are creating your Ogg Opus audio files from audio CDs under newer versions of Ubuntu you can use abcde to rip, convert as well as tag with a single command. Install abcde as follows:\nsudo apt-get install abcde opus-tools\n\nThen place the following configuration file in ~/.abcde.conf:\n# -----------------$HOME/.abcde.conf----------------- #\n# \n# A sample configuration file to convert music cds to \n#       Opus using abcde version 2.7.2\n# \n# http://andrews-corner.org/linux/abcde/index.html\n# -------------------------------------------------- #\n\n# Encode tracks immediately after reading.

The opus stream is usually wrapped in ogg containers; when a program which us unaware of opus looks at the containers stream, it looks for the stream codecs it knows (usually vorbis or speex for audio).\nThe current state of support is stated on opus' Wikipedia page:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opus_(audio_format)#Support_in_software\nVLC version 2.04 is expected to get opus support, but it's not out yet.\nI use wine with foobar2000 to tag opus files under linux, and it works well.\n\nA: I prefer to use “Ex Falso”. It has “Tags from path”, “Rename files”, “Track Numbers” features:\nhttps://quodlibet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/screenshots.html\nBefore I used it for mp3 files. But now I used it for opus file and it works great. My Current Ex Falso version is 4.2.1 (Operating system is Ubuntu 20.04). It can be installed from the “Ubuntu Software” center.\n\nA: users who prefer the command line have multiple options, one is tracktag from the python-audiotools package to write a Vorbis Comment to an Opus file. opusenc takes the metadata only while transcoding. For Debian/Ubuntu its a quick\napt install audiotools\n\nUsage:\ntracktag --name \"title\" --artist \"interpret\" file.opus\n\nanother option to edit any music file is music-tag.\npip3 install --user music_tag\nalias musictag='python3 -m music_tag'\n\nUsage:\nmusictag --set \"title:Title\" --set \"artist:Artist\" --set \"album:Album\" file.opus\n\nIt is depending on mutagen to do this and thus has wide file support.\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu support ATI Dual Graphics? I currently own the AMD A8-3850 APU (GPU+CPU), and I'm wondering if Ubuntu supports AMD's dual graphics, or if I should focus on buying a more powerful card that isn't compatible.\n\nA: I have the A6-3400m APU (integrated 6520G, discrete 6470M) and my experience until now is:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Ubuntu built-in \"radeon\" driver does NOT support \"dual graphics\". To get the radeon driver without dual graphics work properly, the discrete graphics card should be switched off in the BIOS (less power consumption, ...)\n\n*AMD provides a proprietary driver called \"fglrx\". This driver can be installed via the system settings \"additional drivers\" or the latest version directly downloaded from AMD. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI My experience: The Ubuntu fglrx version is much toooo old: I had a lot of problems with wine and the activated discrete graphics card because that driver recognised a wrong graphics card (7400m series instead of 64oom series). With the latest AMD driver (Catalyst 12.10): working.\n\n*The fglrx drivers for Linux/Ubuntu are provided with a graphical configuration application called Catalyst Control Center and can also be configured via command line via amdconfig. With both configuration tools it is possible to switch between the discrete und the integrated graphics engine. This is called PowerXpress. With Windows this switch can be done without reboot but X needs a restart. Therefore the powersaving feature called PowerPlay does not use PowerXpress under Linux but just other features like dynamic clock rate change, .... BUT: PowerXpress is NOT \"dual graphics\".\n\n*\"dual graphics\" means: Both graphics engine act like a single one using the CrossFireX-Technology. This is provided for Windows 7 DirectX 10+ but NOT for Windows XP or Linux! For more information compare the AMD dual graphics FAQ: http://www.amd.com/us/products/technologies/dual-graphics/pages/dual-graphics.aspx#4\nIf there is any newer information about dual graphics and Linux: Please let me know!\n\nA: Yes and use the latest Ubuntu 12.10 and you get latest AMD driver, enable them via hardware driver, select the updates option rather than regular driver.\n", "Q: How do I Get WiFi working on my Dell Inspiron 1501 with BCM4311 [14e4:4311]? My wireless doesn't work with Ubuntu 12.04.(it worked with 10.04 LTS) I have a Dell Inspiron 1501. I followed the steps posted below:\nRun these:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall bcmwl-kernel-source broadcom-sta-common broadcom-sta-source\necho \"blacklist brcmsmac\" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\necho \"blacklist bcma\" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\nThe first makes sure that the sta driver is in place, the second and third blacklists the two drivers brcmsmac and bcma which clash with the correct sta driver. Copy/paste or make sure your typing is correct!\nThe last step is to go to 'Additional drivers' and enable the driver.**\n....and now i have no Network device on my PC(wired or wireless)\n\nA: You can remove the alterations from the last 2 commands with vi.\nsudo vi /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nAnd remove the lines that says \nblacklist brcmsmac\nblacklist bcma\n\n\nNavigate with the arrow keys to those lines.\ndd to remove a line.\n{escape}:wq to save the alterations. \n\nA: I think you are supposed to also run:\nsudo modprobe wl\n\nand\necho \"wl\" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules\n\nYou see, the point is to black list bcma and brcmsmac and to use wl only instead.\n\nHowever, for 4311 I believe you are supposed to do this instead:\nsudo apt-get purge bcmwl-kernel-source broadcom-sta-common broadcom-sta-source\nsudo apt-get install b43-fwcutter firmware-b43-installer\nsudo modprobe b43\necho \"b43\" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules\n\nsource: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BroadcomSTA%28Wireless%29\n\nA: You do not need to blacklist anything when you install bcmwl-kernel-source.\nThis package does it itself. And these blacklists are removed, when the package is removed.\nYou can also remove these lines by\n sudo sed -i '/blacklist brcmsmac/d' /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n sudo sed -i '/blacklist bcma/d' /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf    \n\n\nA: OK, you should change the title of the question since you really want to get wireless working on your Dell Inspiron 1501 with BCM4311 802.11b/g WLAN [14e4:4311]. \n\n\n*\n\n*You will need to undo your blacklisting and my preferred way would be to use the terminal text editor nano so sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf and delete the lines you added. \n\n*According to the linuxwireless.org b43 page, you should be able to use the b43 driver and this is what I have had the most success with. So remove the packages you installed by running sudo apt-get purge bcmwl-kernel-source broadcom-sta-common broadcom-sta-source\n\n*Now you should be ready to install b43, so run sudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer\n\n*Now simply reboot with your fingers crossed!\n\n", "Q: How to switch between windows I'm looking to quickly switch between to windows of an application in Unity. I looked at Unable to switch between different windows of the same application but I didn't get any answer.\nThe only option I've got is to long-click on the icon on the dash and click on the window when they're all shown. That's definitely too long ! I'm sure there is a shortcut, like an Alt+Tab but I don't find it.\nSo, how can I quickly switch between windows of an application ?\n\nA: I discovered two ways of doing so.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use alt+tab until the desired app gets marked. Then wait a little while until the seperate windows of the application show up.\n\n*When you have one window of the application active, click on the applications icon on the quick launch bar. You should now see all of the applications windows.\n\n*To switch to the previously selected application hold alt und press shift+tab\nAnother suggestion is switching between workspaces.\nJust put a window of your application on several workspaces. You can switch between these workspaces really fast using alt+ctrl+arrow-key(up, down, left, right).\n\nA: Expanding on what @CedricReichenbach posted, alt ~ works excellently for me on an English keyboard. \n\nA: In \"System Settings..\" --> \"Keyboard\" go to 'Shortcuts' tab. At the left choose \"Navigation\". Scroll down to \"Switch windows of an app directly\", and assign the keyboard shortcut you'd like (I'm using Alt+').\nHope that works for you.\n\nA: Late answer for those who still find this search result:\nAlt+Tab is default for switch between apps ignoring windows. You can wait a bit and thumbnails of actual windows will come up, nice for completely new users but not very useful as speed is the whole point of keyboard shortcuts.\nBut actually a quick Alt+Tab and release will always switch between the top-most 2 previous selected windows, even if they are of the same app. This is a more or less insane behaviour when you spell it out like this, but in practice it is nice for old habits.\nAlt+~(above Tab) is default for switch between windows of same app only. A little awkward unless you are a Mac power user or something. But what is very nice about this is that you can hold Alt and use Tab or key above at will. Which is to say you can Tab to drill down to the app you know you want and then key above to the specific window without ever releasing Alt until you are done.\nMore good options have come on board over time (both in 13.04 I think). They are not keyboard shortcuts but are really good for exploring everything that is open if you have gotten very busy or cluttered:\n\n\n*\n\n*you can right-click any launcher tile and see windows only of that app are in that list.\n\n*you can scroll the mouse wheel over any launcher tile to immediately switch between windows only of that app.\n\n\nKeyboard shortcuts are not really ideal for this because they are instead for when you know exactly what you want to switch to.\nSee: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/02/new-window-switching-method-added-to-unity\n\nA: At least in 13.04, you should be able to do this with alt+§ (the key above tab, at least on Swiss keyboards).\n\nA: Following @CedricReichenbach notice, it is already possible on french keyboard with alt+² (which is indeed the key above tab).\n\nA: You can use super+w to show all active windows, and then use tab to switch between them.\nsee this: \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/shell-windows-switching.html\n", "Q: How to save terminal configurations?

Is there one?\n\nA: You can find alternate DVD at  Here\nGO to section \n\nDVD images with complete language packs\n\n\nA: There is no alternate DVD.\nThe intended usage for the DVD is to install extra languages for the desktop and as an extra benefit some more desktop software (like inkscape, GIMP, Pitivi and a more complete LibreOffice). The focus of the DVD is therefor the desktop.\nThe method to use is to use the alternate CD and afterwards install the extra languages (should be possible to do with apt-get).

Is there a way to detect an audio hardware damage.

Ubuntu can give you some indications of whether the drivers and devices are working properly or not, but it can't really differentiate between a driver problem and a \"damaged hardware problem\".\nTake a look at this thread.

Ubuntu is not allowing me to get into admin rights.\nCan you please help us.\n\nA: Ubuntu will work fine in a virtual machine. The host OS is irrelevant.\nIf by 'admin rights' you mean using the root user, that's a separate issue. Ubuntu installs with the root user not being someone you can log in as directly.

I'm quite new to the whole Linux world, and I'm trying to migrate the whole of my pc to Linux and show that it can keep up with all of my company requirements (we are specialized on CISCO Networking, Voip and Datacenter solutions).\nUnfortunately I seem to have reached a dead-end.\nAside from an actual bug on Evolution Mail in the signature bit - adding an image to sig is fine, hyperlinking over it CRASHES THE CLIENT (!)...\nThis could be ok if it wasn't for the fact that also opening shared exchange calendars seems to be impossible. I tried several links on google, I already managed to connect correctly to Exchange 2010, but there is no shared calendars option that I can see. I tried opening a calendar in my work mail, but it seems the only option you can get is to open your personal one.\nOne more thing which is really bugging me, changing the View to a personalized one (By Date-Descending) isn't retained on Evolution Mail restart (every folder will get back to the original setting, which is incomprehensible to me).\nDo you guys have any amazing terminal commands that I could run to fix these issues? Up until now any even small thing I wanted to tweak already had an answer somewhere, still this seems to be absolutely impossible to resolve.\nI am running on Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS with kernel 3.2.0-32-generic-pae on a Acer Travelmate 8372 (I know, poor machine, but what can I do...).\n\nA: To expand upon Ubuntuser's comment that helped me along the path:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set up evolution-ews and get your inbox functional.

I would like to install a persistent Ubuntu 11.04 to my USB stick, and it should be able to work as a guest OS running on Windows so that I can boot it on other computers other than the one which I used for the installation. I have used several creators such as unetbootin, however from my understanding it can only create Live Linux which I am unable to save my configurations and files. If it's possible I would like to bypass the BIOS, that is to say that I can just load from the virtual machine without having to restart the computer. Thanks in advance!\n\nThanks for all the replies! Hi Mike, I am able to create a virtual machine and run it from my USB drive using a portable virtualbox. How do I go about from there, do I have to proceed with the installation? Could you elaborate more on the steps for the installation? Thanks again!\n\nA: What you want to accomlish is called virtualization, and has nothing to do with persistent USB installs. You'll have to install Ubuntu in a virtual machine using Virtual Box, and keep the disk image file, .dvi, on the USB stick. To use that file, simply select it when creating a new virtual machine on a new computer.\n\nA: This tool will let you enable \"Persistent\" files which store all your data in the live session.\nhttp://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/\nIf you want Full Ubuntu on the USB drive, which is like a live session in that it runs off of a USB Drive, but it has Full Ubuntu on it, you need 2 flash drives, one 16GB or higher, and another of any size. Format the smaller one with Live Ubuntu, take out the hard drive and boot from the USB, and install Ubuntu n the larger pen drive. You are now able to use it as a full Linux hard drive, just from a USB. This will save your files and programs.\n\nA: I have done a full installation to USB simply using the standard installer.\nHere's my \"low-tech\" version. \n\n\n*\n\n*Remove or Disconnect the Hard drive in the PC you will use for installation. (This prevents accidental damage/ overwriting GRUB.)\n\n*Boot to Live CD.\n\n*Plug in intended USB.  !!! Be sure you don't have any data you don't want overwritten still on this drive !!! It will be lost!\n\n*Run the Installer, and install to the USB just as you would to a standard Hard drive\n\n*Reboot the PC, and select \"Boot from USB\". (The method you use to access the boot menu varies depending on your PC manufacturer.)\n\n*After verifying the install was successful, don't forget to re-install/re-attach the Hard drive.Caveats: You will want to use a larger USB 16+ GB. You should also consider USB 3.0 since 2.0 will perform slowly.\nAs for not having to leave Windows you may want to  look into VMware and/or Virtual Box This would require you to run a VM Player on any Machine you intend to use it on.

According to this post menu shutdown asks each application to save their work prior to shutting down.

Of course those are primarily concerns for a server. If the system is used by you alone, then no worries.\n\nA: None that I am aware of. That is how I shut down all of my servers.

I don't use the launcher panel - I hide it in workspace 9 - but I do use the top panel.  I believe that you can use the launcher if you want to though.\nBe aware that Xmonad does not support 3D rendering - so you will have to use the 2D version of Unity in Ubuntu 12.04, which is differs from the 3D version in some ways.\nFollow the instructions here: \nhttp://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Xmonad/Using_xmonad_in_Unity_2D\nI recommend configuring Nautilus to disable desktop icons.

It turns out that Unity 2D was designed differently in that it implemented the panel as a separate component that could be used with any window manager.  Although the new version of Unity does have a fallback mode for machines that do not support graphics acceleration, it does not have the same modular design.\nI have switched to running Xmonad with Gnome Classic.

Is there a way to get both GPUs onto a single X screen?\n\nA: Your post is a bit old, but the answer might be useful to others. Since your post, there are even newer NVidia drivers which /kind of/ work for me. Xinerama works, but it's still buggy and I occasionally need to restart X (\"service lightdm restart\", or \"service gdm restart\" - depends on distro).\nWith Xinerama off, you have separate X screens. The mouse can move between them, but that's all. This is normal, and I can't tolerate it myself. \nTo start an application on the second screen (first screen is \":0.0\", second screen is \":0.1\"):\n$ export DISPLAY=:0.1\n$ xterm # or your application.\n\n", "Q: How can a script detect a user's idle time? I want to check, inside a bash script, how long the user of a X session has been idle.\nThe user himself does not have to be using bash, but just X. If the user just moved the mouse, for example, a good answer would be \"idle for 0 seconds\". If he has not touched the computer in 5 minutes, a good answer would be \"idle for 300 seconds\"\nThe reason to not use xautolock straight away is to be able to implement some complex behavior. For example, if the user is idle for 10 minutes, try to suspend, if he is idle for more 5 minutes, shutoff (I know it sounds odd, but suspend does not always work here ...)\n\nA: Using the answer by josinalvo might work for some, but it didn't quite work so well for me as some programs seem to be regularly resetting the timer, on which xprintidle relies, unexpectedly. In addition, I also would not want a fullscreen application to reset the idle timer, at least not in my use case.\nSo I've strung together my own solution in a shell script which doesn't rely on the X11 Screen Saver extension. Instead it dumps all user input like mouse movement and key presses using xinput test-xi2 --root for one second and then compares it with a dump from the last second. If they are the same, the variable $t gets increased by 1 and gets reset in the other case. This is looped and when variable $t gets over the treshold in $idletime, it is printed that the user is idle.\nidleloop() {\n    touch /tmp/.{,last_}input\n    cmd='stat --printf=\"%s\"'\n    idletime=120\n    a=2\n    t=0\n    while true\n    do\n        timeout 1 xinput test-xi2 --root > /tmp/.input\n        \n        if [[ `eval $cmd /tmp/.input` == `eval $cmd /tmp/.last_input` ]]\n        then\n            let t++ # increases $t by 1\n        else\n            t=0     # resets $t\n        fi\n\n        mv /tmp/.{,last_}input -f\n\n        if [ $t -ge $idletime ] && [[ $a == \"2\" ]]\n        then\n            echo \"user has gone idle\"\n            a=1\n        fi\n        if [ $t -lt $idletime ] && [[ $a == \"1\" ]]\n        then\n            echo \"user has come back from idle\"\n            a=2\n        fi\n    done\n}\n\nidleloop\n\nFeel free to leave any suggestions.\n\nA: Just found a simple way to do it.\nThere is a program called xprintidle that does the trick\ngetting the idle time (in milliseconds) is as simple as\nxprintidle\n\nand to install\napt-get install xprintidle\n\n\nFor sysadmins, it also works remotely\nFrom an ssh session:\nexport DISPLAY=:0 && sudo -u john xprintidle\n\nwhere john is the user logged into the X session on the remote machine.\n\nNote that some programs such as MPlayer seem to reset the counter.\nThat might be desirable or not depending on your application.

It is has apache/mysql/php all installed ready to go. the folder structure is like this:\n/var/www -- this isnt the root\n-/libs\n-/logs\n-/public - this is the root\n-/vhosts - all subdomains go here\n\nI have a folder in vhosts named mysite. I went into /etc/apache2/sites-available and created a file and here are the contents -> (vhost file). and I also added an entry in /etc/hosts file containing: 127.0.1.1 mysite.dev and I also did \nsudo a2ensite mysite\n\ni tried accessing the site from a computer via mysite.dev and our public ip into the server but i was not able to view it. the public directory in the structure above does display on all computers when i try our public ip. but for anything added in vhosts the site wont show. there is no domain attached its just our ip. I tried changing the port from 80 to say 9999 in the mysite file in sites-available and tried myip:9999 but that didnt work either. what am I doing wrong?\nedit: i forgot to mention that the server is dmzed on the router.\n\nA: Reachable on a few local machines\nIf you want mysite.dev to work on just a couple of local machines, you can always edit their /etc/hosts files. Windows also have hosts files that you can edit, which are located in C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts.\nIn the hosts file on the computer you want to set up being able to reach mysite.dev, just add this to the bottom of it (both Windows and Linux):\nSERVERIP mysite.dev www.mysite.dev\n\nWhere you replace SERVERIP with the local IP address of your server running Apache.\nReachable on the entire local network\nIf you want it to work on your local network, you'll ned a DNS server and configure the networks DHCP server so your local machines do all their DNS queries through your server.\nFirst, let's install bind.\nsudo apt-get install bind9\n\nThen we'll ned to start configuring bind and adding a DNS zone, in this case the mysite.dev. Start by editing your /etc/bind/named.conf.local file and add the following block to it:\nzone \"mysite.dev\" {\n    type master;\n    file \"/etc/bind/zones/mysite.dev;\n}\n\nThen, create the direcotyr /etc/bind/zones.\nsudo mkdir /etc/bind/zones\n\nNow, let's add the zone file for the mysite.dev domain. Create and edit the file /etc/bind/zones/mysite.dev and add the following to it:\n$ORIGIN . ; -*- zone -*-\n$TTL 600    ; 10 minutes\nmysite.dev          IN SOA  YOURSERVERNAME. hostmaster.mysite.dev. (\n                    2012102300 ; serial\n                    6H         ; refresh\n                    30M        ; retry\n                    4W         ; expire\n                    10M        ; minimum (10 minutes)\n                )\n                NS  YOURSERVERNAME.\n                A   YOURSERVERIP\n\n$ORIGIN mysite.dev.\nwww         A   YOURSERVERIP\n\nNow take a closer look here. You need to change the two occurances of YOURSERVERNAME and the two occurances of YOURSERVERIP references to the ones that matches your server. For example server01.local and 10.0.0.2. To find out your server name, type hostname -f in a terminal window on your server.\nIf you're gonna change anything in this zone file (like adding subdomains later or something), you must remember to update the serial number. In this case it's 2012102300. The value must be set to a higher value, e.g. 2012102301.\nRestart the bind service with sudo service bind9 restart and the DNS server should be up and running for your domain. You should probably test this by running dig @localhost mysite.dev from the server itself before you jump on to the next step. You can also test it from a client computer on the network with dig @YOURSERVERIP mysite.dev, where YOURSERVERIP is the IP address for your server.\nNow, the last thing you need to do, is update your DHCP servers configuration and set your local server as the (secondary, if possible) DNS server. This, unfortunatley, I can't help you with that easily.\nReachable on the internet\nSince there is no top level domain name called .dev, it is necessary for ICANN to create this. At this point their gTLD application system is closed, but maybe it will be possible to apply for the .dev TLD some time in the future. Note that they probably want a bunch load of money for it.\n", "Q: Differences in compiling between gcc 4.4 and gcc 4.6? I just moved from RH (CentOS 6) with gcc 4.4.6 to Ubuntu 12 with gcc 4.6.3.  I have a program that references a third party library.  I have successfully build and installed the library on the Ubuntu machine.  When I run updatedb and locate libXXX.so I get the same exact results.  I look for the header file the same way and also get the same exact results.  \nI have a small test program that came from the CentOS box.  It consists of one *.c file and a bash script to build and run it.  It's all very simple.  The script looks like this:  \n#!/bin/bash\n\nrm -f a.out\ngcc -W -lpowerdna *.c\n\nexit 0\n\nI have LD_LIBRARY_PATH set (on both the CentOS and Ubuntu boxes) to the directory where the header file and *.so reside.  I have double, triple, and quadruple checked that the spelling and the capitalization are correct.\nAnd yet when I compile on the Ubuntu machine, I get the undefined reference to '<function name>' error for every function call in the test program.  To add to the general oddness, their defined types are not generating errors.  When I comment out the #include in my test file, the compiler generates errors for the types.\nThis is a very simple setup, with very few points of possible failure.

LightDM or GDM? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat’s the difference between GDM and LightDM? \n\nI'm a somewhat experienced noob on this Linux-thing. I'm growing quite familiar with Ubuntu and I just love Gnome(3+).\nJust by accident I was presented with a choice the other day. I was upgrading from an old Ubuntu version and then I had to choose which display manager I wanted to use with the new version. Throwing the dice (even numbers = LightDM, odd numbers = GDM) I got a five, hence, I choose GDM.\nI have a rather decent machine (AMD Phenom II hexa-core processor @3.2GHz, 16GB RAM, too much disc space, generic on-board graphics card). I'm currently running Ubuntu 12.10 with Gnome4 (yes, I know, I'm brave/stupid, considering the fact that both are still in beta stage). The machine has a quite central role in my network, but is almost exclusively connected to from other Linux devices (considering Android as Linux).\nBasically, I just want to know which manager is the most optimal for my above mentioned system (if there is a difference at all, but there is a reason someone wrote LightDM, right?).\nAre there any performance benefits or compatibility issues to consider?\nWill I notice a difference using one over the other ?\nRemember I'm a noob, I barely know what a display manager is or does.\nCheers, dbm\nP.S: I don't want to start a GDM vs. LightDM war here (I will delete the question at the first trolling attempt).\n\nA: The default in Ubuntu is LightDM, but if it works I see no reason to lose sleep over it.\nI am not aware of any difference between the two from a hardware performance aspect.\n", "Q: alert when running applications from root When I want to launch some applications from root user it alerts me that it may not be run as root and i need to log in as normal user. For example for Google Chrome or Glob database visualization. Why it says so and how can I enable it?\n\nA: This is mainly for security reasons. Software with root access can do anything on your system if an attacker manages to get it to execute arbitrary code, which is a common attack. A malicious user can run apt-get, change your passwords file keeping you from logging in, or worse, wipe your hard disk and destroy all traces of your data, possibly beyond the help of ext4undelete or Photorec. As a limited user, any malicious code will only be able to do what that user can do. Since sudo requires a password at runtime, the malicious script cannot get it.\nAlso, if you run a program as a normal user with username username, then any data con configuration is stored in a subdirectory of /home/username. When you try to run it as root, it looks for and places config files in /root, where they won't be seen when you run the program as a normal user. This can cause user frustration if a user unwittingly does this.\nIn order to enable this on a program that does not allow this, you have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find a command-line switch or configuration file that allows you to do this. This may not work on some programs, and is different for every one.\n\n*Recompile the program after editing the source. You must remove the check for the user. This is very difficult and cumbersome.\nAs stated, there is not much you can do if the program does not have an option for this. \n", "Q: Best practices for using 'sudo su' \n\nI have been using the terminal for a while now and sometimes (actually, a lot of times) I use a command, like:\ncp /etc/test ~/testFolder/\n\nand I get this error:\ncp: cannot open `/etc/test` for reading: Permission denied\n\nThat's the moment I remember that I forgot the sudo command before it, so I press Up arrow and then CTRL+A to go to the beggining of the line and insert a sudo there:\nsudo cp /etc/test ~/testFolder/\n\nThere are even worse scenarios where you use vim to edit a file, you forget sudo command and don't see the warning when the program starts, you edit the entire file and in the end, you can't save it!\nWhen you realize you're doing it so many times, it becomes annoying, specially if you're like me and used to type commands without the sudo.\nThere is a way to solve this problem, when you start the terminal, just type sudo su to use commands as root user, but some say it's more likely to make mistakes that you'll regret forever.\nMy question is, what's the best practice for executing commands as root? Using sudo and missing it everytime or automatically use sudo bash and having the risk of destroying the entire system?\n\nA: Best practice is to only use root when you need it. By using sudo su, you are indeed giving the devil access to the kingdom. It was annoying to me at first, but remembering to use sudo in front of a command has saved me from making massive mistakes. I have had an experience where using sudo su has ruined everything, in a work environment.\nStory time\nWe were using a CentOS server to run an application. The server was old, and had been turned into a VM, because its hardware was dead/dying. We had a raid corruption occur and the VM was damaged. Our backups were damaged too, so the only hope to recover data was mount VM and try to pull it all. I used sudo su and got to work. I recovered about 10% when I accidentally ran the wrong command, it wiped the database and we lost the application and all data. I have never run sudo su again, and I won't. Lesson learned the hard way.\n\nA: Relax. Firstly, rm -rf * or anything such like run as a regular user in your home directory is equally catastrophic. System can easily be restored, but it's your data that matters. In the fifteen years or so that I use Linux I had no major disaster that could have been avoided by not using root. \n(Well, if you are a sysadmin, especially on a production server, then it is another matter. Just clench your teeth and do it properly; see the horror story of @jmartin2279 in another answer to this question).\nSecondly, if you have a different prompt (by default root prompt ends with a hash, #, but you can make it colorful), it will remind you that you are not running as a regular user.\nThirdly, you are an intelligent human being, so you do regular backups. You do, don't you? You know what they say: there are two types of people, those who do backups and those who will.\nFinally, get off my lawn, in the olde days we had no stinking su or sudo, we were memorizing passwords of twenty random characters every month and we LIKED IT! (and sometimes, we had half an hour chat over a single command line before pressing \"enter\")\nHowever, vim always warns you that you are editing a read only file (\"/etc/passwd\" [readonly] in the status line). Also, if you cannot write to a file, you can always :w /tmp/whatever.\n\nA: Back in the days before I used a sudo system (read: ancient Red Hat), I used several techniques to remind me when I was running as root: a red prompt, \"root\" in the title bar, etc. These days I run sudo and have no prompt change. I've never ever had a problem from operating as root that would have been solved by having to prepend sudo to a command.\nI've got a shortcut for editing files. I've got a bash script similar to the following in ~/bin/vi (and ~/bin is the first entry in my $PATH):\n#!/bin/bash\nif [[ ! -w \"$1\" ]]; then\n  exec sudo vim \"$@\"\nelse\n  exec vim \"$@\"\nfi\n\nI'm typing this from memory, so beware of bugs. The idea is that if the first file named I'd un-writeable then it automatically uses sudo. Obviously this approach isn't perfect, but it's been good enough for a number of years.\n", "Q: Can't Set Environment Variables in ~/.profile All, I need to set environment variables in my ~/.profile since I am running a program (QtCreator) that doesn't start a bash shell.\nI cannot for the life of me get it to work though.  QtCreator will not show any of the environment variables I defined under \"System Environment.\"\nHow can I do this?\n\nEdit: Okay, actually it turns out my question is why can't I source my_environment where \nmy_environment:\n export SOME_PATH=blalalal\n\nIf I add export SOME_PATH=blalalal to my ~/.profile it works.  But I can't use source ~/.profile\n\nA: Here is the story:\n\n~/.profile - In this file you can also place environment variable assignments, since it gets executed automatically by the DisplayManager during the start-up process desktop session as well as by the login shell when one logs-in from the textual console.\n\n(source)\n\n\n*\n\n*solution: export the variables defined in .profile. \n        export VAR1=foo\n\n*solution: put the variables in .bashrc, open a terminal and start QtCreator from command line. It should have the variables. Don't forget to export them:\nexport VAR1=foo\n\n\n*solution: create a wrapper for starting your program, a small script that you run instead of running the program directly:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nexport VAR1=foo\nprogram\n\nor\n #!/bin/bash\n\n VAR1=foo program\n\n\n*solution: edit the .desktop file used to launch the application by modifying the execute line to\n VAR1=foo program\n\ninstead of\n program\n\n(haven't tested that, but it should work)\n\n*solution: change the environment. You are right in your comment that programs do get an environment, even if they do not read it from the .profile. The system-wide environment is in /etc/environment, but you can also set it per session, in a file in your home directory called .pam_environment. See here for more information. By the way, this page neatly explains what all the different files do and when to use which.\nHowever, I prefer solutions 1-3, because they change the environment of the program only, and not of the whole session.\n\nA: Just logout and login back into the system that the .pam-environment file is read and the environment variable is recognized.\n", "Q: How do I change to ksh?

But the device can't be removed safely by using the option \" safely remove device\". How can it solve?\n\nA: \"Safely remove device\" is for storage. You do not need to safely remove a WiFi dongle. The purpose of \"safely remove device\" is to make sure that all the pending write operations are executed -- that data to be written to the device is, actually, written before removing the device. The writing could have been cached and put off for later if the system had better things to do.\nYou don't need to do that with your WiFi.\n", "Q: Backup torrents for clean install Tomorrow I'm going to do a clean install of Ubuntu 12.10, since I've been playing with some internals and now my system is quite messy. Everything is prepared, my files backed up and I've already made a list with the programs I'm going to need, etc. But there's still one thing missing: my torrents.\nI use Transmission and, like everyone should, I like to keep my seeding my files after download. I've set Transmission to delete the .torrent files after I start to download. I actually don't know if the torrents' data is stored at the home directory or not. \n1) Is it stored on the home folder? (If it is, it's not going to be a problem since I use a separate partition for the home folder)\n2) If it's not, is there a way to backup the torrents' info, so I can continue seeding after my clean install?\n\nA: Active torrents should be in .config/transmission/torrents inside your home folder.

I made a persistent Live USB with the usb-creator, and I was wondering if I can just update as one normally would, or if there are special procedures I need to take.\n\nA: If your live usb was created with persistence then it can be updated. However, to fit an entire Linux distribution into a small space it has been compressed & made read only via the squashfs method. So when it updates it recreates the updated parts of the file system outside of the squashfs, taking up a much larger space. \nMy live Kubuntu 16.04 had 500 MB of updates which finished using 4 GB of space - which fills up a normal casper-rw file. I had made a 8 GB casper-rw partition, hence I still had space. \nI suggest you stick to security updates only. \nWhen I made my usb I created 4 partitions: for the main file system, casper-rw for persistence, home-rw for my stuff, and a ntfs partion for sharing files. If the live iso images are updated, then the usb can be updated by copying the new iso files into the old usb. I'm also thinking about unsqashing the file system, updating it in virtualbox and resquashing it. \n\nA: Startup Disk Creator now produces an ISO9660 partition that is read only.\nThere is no \"persistence\" option.\nSince there is no casper-rw persistence file, there is no place for updates to be stored.\nIf you want an updateable/upgradeable Bootable USB, do a Full install as you would to internal drive. (Best to unplug internal drives first).\n\nA: There are no special procedures. But your setting would not be saved if you have not made a persistent Live USB. You can read more about it on Ubuntu Wiki.\n\nA: None of the existing ISO9660-based live operating systems provide a kernel update feature: the kernel and the initrd are the only components that a live operating system cannot update, because they lay outside of the data persistence partition (if any) and the system partition is, as said, ISO9660-formatted.\nAfter some years of asking me why, I found the liveng whitepaper on Read the Docs.\n\nThe full aim of the liveng project is to give the Community a set of\n  best practices in order to turn a common Debian Linux live into a\n  live(ng) operating system which features:\nnative encrypted persistence;\nkernel update (on a live ISO 9660 filesystem!);\nUEFI, with UEFI Secure Boot compatibility, with a real efi partition.\n\n\n\nA: yes of course . if live image on a usb ( there is space ) you can update as a ubuntu on hdd.\n\nA: I've been able to update many things, but updates affecting the Linux kernel and its modules don't seem to happen correctly on those sticks I've created this way. \nIf I'm not mistaken, the reason is that the kernel being booted isn't with the rest of the root partition, but stored separately on the stick.\n", "Q: Fast way to burn DVD-R (UDF)? We could create ISO-9660 DVDs by piping mkisofs into cdrecord.\nFor UDF, the procedure seems to be convoluted and slow. It creates a temporary blank 4GB file, then writes data into it, and only then burns it.\nIs there a fast way to burn data DVD-Rs in the UDF format?\n\nA: Yes, there is a faster way to write in UDF filesystem in CD/DVD. It called packet writing, introduced with UDF version 1.50. \nIn short, packet writing it is a way to write to CD/DVD or other media in a manner similar to reading, writing, deleting from a normal folder. This method supports both CD/DVD write-once media as well as Rewritable media. Obviously, you won't get back the free space if you delete something from write-once media like CD-R, DVD+R, DVD-R etc.\nThe packet writing with UDF filesystem should be supported in kernel level and the support is default since kernel 2.6.10. For more information about kernel support in debian systems, look at this page.\nThe detailed procedure was described in this page under the section Formatting and using a UDF DVD-RW or CD-RW for packet writing. Don't be confused with the step 3 (which creates an empty session) with the creation of a large file with UDF filesystem. That process was listed just after this one, which is not packet writing. \nUpdate: For convenience of the viewer, I'm quoting the procedure section here. \nFormatting and using a UDF DVD-RW or CD-RW for packet writing\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe commands differ depending on whether you are using DVD or CD\nmedia.\n\n1) Edit /etc/default/udftools and add your drive for packet writing.\nFor example, if your CD/DVD writer is /dev/hdc and you want it\navailable as the default /dev/pktcdvd/0, then use the setting\n\"DEVICES=/dev/hdc\". Execute \"/etc/init.d/udftools start\" afterwards to\nregister the device.\n\nIf the device name /dev/hdc differs on your system, adjust the\nfollowing commands as appropriate.\n\n2) Prepare the medium in restricted overwrite mode:\n\nDVD-RW: dvd+rw-format -force /dev/hdc\n CD-RW: Do nothing, skip this step!\n\n3) Write an empty session spanning the whole medium. It seems that\nwithout this step, any attempt to create the UDF filesystem will fail.\n\nDVD-RW: growisofs -Z /dev/hdc=/dev/zero\n CD-RW: cdrwtool -d /dev/hdc -q\n\n4) Format the packet device in UDF format.\n\nDVD-RW: mkudffs --udfrev=0x0150 --spartable=2 --media-type=dvdrw /dev/pktcdvd/0\n CD-RW: mkudffs --udfrev=0x0150 --spartable=2 --media-type=cdrw /dev/pktcdvd/0\n\nThe parameters require some more explanation: For --udfrev, use either\n0x0150 for UDF version 1.50, or 0x0201 for UDF version 2.01. The\nversion decision has mostly to do with compatibility:\n  - Windows 98/ME can read up to v1.02\n  - Windows 2000, Mac OS 9, Linux 2.4 can read up to v1.50\n  - Windows 2003/XP can read up to v2.01\n  - Linux 2.6 can read up to v2.60\nFor normal data, UDF 1.50 is OK. UDF 2.00 and 2.01 introduce\nadditional functionality for streaming audio/video.\n\nPossible values for --media-type are: hd dvdram dvdrw worm mo cdrw cdr.\nUse the one appropriate for your medium/device.\n\n5) Mount the disc. The \"noatime\" option is important: It will reduce\nthe amount of writes to the device and thus increase its lifetime. You\nmay first have to create the mount directory using \"mkdir\n/media/dvd0\":\n\n  mount -t udf -o rw,noatime /dev/pktcdvd/0 /media/dvd0\n\nThe \"sync\" mount option might also be useful, but will typically cause\nan increased number of write accesses to the medium. From now on, the\nroot user can access the filesystem under /media/dvd0 using read and\nwrite operations.\n\n6) If regular users should also have write access, modify the\npermissions as follows _while the filesystem is mounted_:\n\n  chgrp plugdev /media/dvd0       # Set group ownership to \"plugdev\"\n  chmod g+rwx /media/dvd0         # Give full read/write access to group\n\nNow all users who should have access to the disc need to be added to\nthe \"plugdev\" group using \"adduser <username> plugdev\".\n\nTo also allow these users to mount and unmount/eject the medium, you\ncan use either of these two routes:\n\n - Install the \"pmount\" package and add the device to the list of\n   allowed devices using \"echo /dev/pktcdvd/0 >>/etc/pmount.allow\".\n   All members of the group \"plugdev\" will then be able to mount the\n   disc using \"pmount /dev/pktcdvd/0 dvd0\" and unmount it using\n   \"pumount /media/dvd0\".\n\n - Add a line like the following to /etc/fstab:\n   /dev/pktcdvd/0 /media/dvd0 udf rw,noatime,users,noauto 0 0\n   This will enable _all_ users to mount the disc using\n   \"mount /media/dvd0\" and unmount it with\n   \"umount /media/dvd0\". However, with the permissions from step 5)\n   above, only the members of group \"plugdev\" ought to be able to\n   write to it. \n\n\nA: There is no quick and ultra straightforward way on the command line to generate a UDF disk; the commands described in your linked article are the usual methods. You would usually install the udftools package and anything else you need with\nsudo apt-get install udftools libudf0 \n\nand then go through the process as noted here. There is no simpler way of doing it at present. (It is important to note that the libudf0 library is also necessary for handling UDF filesystems.)\nHowever, the gui program k3b also has some UDF support (as the screenshot shows), so that is probably the 'easiest' way to go for some of your projects. There is not really a lot of choice where UDF is concerned, but I think k3b will probably be useful, even though it is not a command-line program.\n\n", "Q: Why does service service_name status give different responses for different services? Running the \"service service_name status\" command gives three different types of output when three different service_names are used. I tried with atftpd, apache2, and isc-dhcp-server, as shown below.\nuser@host:~$ service atftpd status\nUsage: /etc/init.d/atftpd {start|stop|restart|reload|force-reload}\nuser@host:~$ service apache2 status\nApache2 is running (pid 1103).\nuser@host:~$ service isc-dhcp-server status\nisc-dhcp-server start/running, process 5696\n\nCould this be because atftpd has not been converted to Upstart?\nThe status for isc-dhcp-server shows \"start/running\" which indicates it has been converted to use Upstart. I would've thought apache2 would have been converted to Upstart already. If it has then why does it not display \"start/running\"?\n\nA: I think I may understand a bit more after doing some digging within Ubuntu and also Googling stuff. All services have not been ported to Upstart.\nls -l /etc/init.d/\n\nThe above command lists all files but we are interested in a few.\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 7621 Feb  6  2012 apache2\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1511 Oct 17  2011 atftpd\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   21 Sep 14 10:57 isc-dhcp-server -> /lib/init/upstart-job\n\nAs you can see, apache2 and atftpd have not been converted to Upstart yet while isc-dhcp-server had. Let's list files in another directory.\nls -l /etc/init\n\nAgain lots of files are listed but we are interested in just one:\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1704 Sep 14 10:56 isc-dhcp-server.conf\n\nThis confirms that isc-dhcp-server has been converted to Upstart but apache2 and atftpd have not.\nBut now the question is whether to use the old invoke-rc.d or /etc/init.d/ commands to start/stop/etc. services, or use service command, or use initctl (Upstart) command? The answer I understand best is to always use the service command. Based on how init files are configured in /etc/init.d/, service will either use the initctl (or start or stop) for services converted to Upstart and use the older /etc/init.d/ for services that have not been converted. As users we don't have to worry and always use service. Disclaimer: I tested this only in Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: Correct, this is because you are checking the status of two types of service, one is Upstart ntive (isc-dhcp-server) and the other two are System V style init scripts.  One of these SysV scripts (atftpd) does not support the status command.  The status sub-command is not a mandatory init script command, unlike start and stop.\nThe reason why Apache has not been converted to Upstart is in how it forks off processes.  In short, Upstart uses the kernel ptrace() facility to follow forks, but it only tracks forks and not exits, it assumes the parent process is gone.  To make a long story short, this is not compatible with the way certain daemons handle forking, such as apache2 and postfix.\nThese two old bugs, get to the technical heart of the matter.\nSome folks have had a little success writing their own Upstart jobs and starting Apache with a \"no detach\" option, but this is unsupported and if you're not careful, a package upgrade could clobber your changes. Init scripts and Upstart jobs are not intended to be edited by the user.  Dpkg considers this a conflict and will prompt you when upgrading.  If you don't have a specific reason to switch Apache to a native Upstart job, I would stick with the init script.  Note: the way to properly modify Upstart jobs is to create a .override file [see man 5 init].\nIn the future, Upstart may switch from ptrace() to using cgroups to manage process groups, which would remove this type of problem.  But that's still over the horizon, I believe. \n", "Q: Get HD Netflix videos on Virtualbox Netflix works great on virtualbox, however it doesn't show up with any options for HD viewing.

After the new install you can then extract the \"tarred\" files to the proper directories.\nAdapted from user Heliodode on Ubuntu Forums: Source\n\nHi, and welcome to the Heliode guide to successful backing-up and\n  restoring of a Linux system!\nEdited out: interesting but unneeded banter. \n1: Backing-up \nEdit: more banter\nTo do this, become root with\nsudo su\nand go to the root of your filesystem (we use this in our example, but\n  you can go anywhere you want your backup to end up, including remote\n  or removable drives.)\ncd /\nNow, below is the full command I would use to make a backup of my\n  system:\ntar cvpzf backup.tgz --exclude=/proc --exclude=/lost+found\n  --exclude=/backup.tgz --exclude=/mnt --exclude=/sys /\nEdit add: The file you create will be very large. You may wish to direct this backup to an external device. If you do then change the\n  file name (backup.tgz) to /media/external-device/backup.tgz  . Then,\n  exclude the /media directory ` --exclude=/media\nNow, lets explain this a little bit. The 'tar' part is, obviously, the\n  program we're going to use.\n'cvpfz' are the options we give to tar, like 'create archive'\n  (obviously), 'preserve permissions'(to keep the same permissions on\n  everything the same), and 'gzip' to keep the size down.\nNext, the name the archive is going to get. backup.tgz in our example.\nNext comes the root of the directory we want to backup. Since we want\n  to backup everything; /\nNow come the directories we want to exclude. We don't want to backup\n  everything since some dirs aren't very useful to include. Also make\n  sure you don't include the file itself, or else you'll get weird\n  results. You might also not want to include the /mnt folder if you\n  have other partitions mounted there or you'll end up backing those up\n  too. Also make sure you don't have anything mounted in /media (i.e.\n  don't have any cd's or removable media mounted). Either that or\n  exclude /media.\nWell, if the command agrees with you, hit enter (or return, whatever)\n  and sit back&relax. This might take a while.\nAfterwards you'll have a file called backup.tgz in the root of your\n  filessytem, which is probably pretty large. Now you can burn it to DVD\n  or move it to another machine, whatever you like!\nEDIT2: At the end of the process you might get a message along the lines of 'tar: Error exit delayed from previous errors' or something,\n  but in most cases you can just ignore that.\nAlternatively, you can use Bzip2 to compress your backup. This means\n  higher compression but lower speed. If compression is important to\n  you, just substitute the 'z' in the command with 'j', and give the\n  backup the right extension. That would make the command look like\n  this:\ntar cvpjf backup.tar.bz2 --exclude=/proc --exclude=/lost+found\n  --exclude=/backup.tar.bz2 --exclude=/mnt --exclude=/sys /\n2: Restoring  (In this case, after you do a full install. Make sure to use the same version of install disk as the system you are\n  backing up.)\nWarning: Please, for goodness sake, be careful here.

You can\n  even remove every single file of a Linux system while it is running\n  with one command. I'm not giving you that command though!\nWell, back on-topic. This is the command that I would use:\ntar xvpfz backup.tgz -C /\nOr if you used bz2;\ntar xvpfj backup.tar.bz2 -C /\nWARNING: this will overwrite every single file on your partition with the one in the archive!\nJust hit enter/return/whatever and watch the fireworks.

I have set up a new pc, and I want to copy data from my old pc to it, without having to manually copy everything to an external drive.\nI guess I could do something with rsync over ssh, but have no idea of how to accomplish that.\nAnyone?\n\nA: rsync is pretty easy to use. You will need to know the ip address or name of the machine. So if your new machine is called shiny and the old machine is called abandoned, and you have the same user on both machine then to copy to the data over you would type this on shiny:\nrsync avz username@abandoned:/home/user /home/user\n\nSubstitute the IP addresses if you don't know the names. You should be able to ping the other machine if they are on the same network. You can get the IP address by typing ifconfig.\nAlternatively, you could take the old hdd and mount it either on the machine physically if its a desktop in the spare slot and just copy the files over. Or use a sata/usb lead to mount it, or one of these toasters: \n\nA: You can easily use Nautilus to copy your data from a remote PC: Connect both units via ethernetfor example, open Nautilus on the new machine, press F3 to have two file browsers in your window, navigate the left one to your destination directory and the right one to your source directory (using \"network\", you need to know username and password of the old machine).

In school I use ubuntu in my programmers class and we use BlueJ. This IDE is set to german language but I want to have an english IDE because I´m also programming in english. But to achieve this I have to modify a specific textfile. This file only can be accessed when you have root permissions. Is there any \"inofficial\" way to change this file without root permissions?\n\nA: I haven't used BlueJ but most applications have their default, system-wide config files, which should not be modified by users (and if that's what your sysadmin refuses to modify, he might be right in doing so) but also a user-specific config files in $HOME/. Looking at its documentation p.30, BlueJ can be invoked like this:\njava -jar bluej.jar -Dbluej.language=german\n\nand it also has a user-specific configuration file in:\n<USER_HOME>/.bluej/bluej.properties\n\n\nA: You could try installing a version of BlueJ onto your home directory (see this question or try the jar) and using this instead of the one supplied by your college. Or use an alternative IDE like eclipse - again installed on your home dir.\nHowever, to actually answer the question if the file you need to edit \n<bluej_dir>/lib/bluej.defs\n\nHas specific permissions that your user account does not have access to then there isn't much you can do.

Im just wondering is it possible to install windows7 or any linux to a loop file from ubuntu. Just reverse of what wubi offers. Loop file has to be on ext partition.\nI wish to easily switch to different test os without the hassle of partitioning. Is it possible.?\n\nA: Windows: no, Linux yes.  In the case of Ubuntu, it isn't supported by the regular installer, but you can set up the loopback mount yourself and then use debootstrap to initialize the system, then configure a custom grub entry to boot it with the loop= command line argument to point the kernel to the image file.\nYou may find it easier to set up a virtual machine, or LVM, which makes it a snap to add, remove, and resize partitions without even needing to reboot or unmount anything.\n", "Q: ACPI _OSC control I've noticed an error from dmesg output that ubuntu canot enable ASPM:\n[    0.192722]  pci0000:00: ACPI _OSC support notification failed, disabling PCIe ASPM\n[    0.192728]  pci0000:00: Unable to request _OSC control (_OSC support mask: 0x08)\n\nWhile I know that this is not a bug, I'd like to ask if there is a way to correct it and enable ASPM, the reason being that it should increase battery life (powertop shows that PCIe is always 100% on).\nEdit: I am running on an ASUS eee pc 1015px with the latest bios version (1401)\n\nA: I'm pasting this in from my blog (plus some changes) as it add some context to this question.\nPCI Express based serial linked devices can be managed by Active State Power Management (ASPM) to extend battery life on mobile devices such as laptops and netbooks.  ASPM is a power management protocol that allows an operating system's power management to place the link physical layer into a low power mode and it has the ability to instruct other devices on the link to go into a lower power mode too.\nThe plus side is that we save power with ASPM, however, it will introduce some latency as the bus needs time to be woken up when in a low power state.\nThe PCIe specification (version 2.0) defines two power modes:\n\n\n*\n\n*L0s, which set low power mode in in direction on the link (usually from the physical link layer controller downstream)\n\n*L1, which sets low power mode in both directions on the link, however there is greater wakeup latency.\nUnfortunately it seems that your firmware is indicating to the kernel that it really does not support ASPM on your hardware. The kernel has queried the firmware using the ACPI _OSC control to see if ASPM is supported and it is informed it is not supported, so ASPM is disabled.  The reasons for this being disabled are vendor specific.  It may be because on Windows somethings just hang or are unreliable with ASPM enabled so the firmware disables it completely.\nLinux also provides some ASPM driver kernel parameters to allow some level of tweakability.  The following kernel parameters can be used:\ndisable ASPM:\npcie_aspm=off\n\nuse default firmware configuration:\npcie_aspm=default\n\ndisables ASPM and clock power management:\npcie_aspm=performance\n\nhighest power saving mode, enable ASPM and clock power management:\npcie_aspm=powersave\n\nforce ASPM on:\npcie_aspm=force\n\nYou may wish to tinker with the last setting to see if you can override the default ASPM settings.\n", "Q: Cannot get grub menu to timeout (or go away) I am running Ubuntu 12.04.\nI cannot for the life of me get the grub menu (with options) to go away.\nI would like it to auto-boot into the first option.

Editing /boot/grub/grub.cfg manually should be out of the question as is automatically generated.

For example:\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=5\nGRUB_RECORDFAIL_TIMEOUT=$GRUB_TIMEOUT\n\nEdit\nSee this answer for more details.\n\nA: change the GRUB_TIMEOUT=10 to zero\nThis is my Configuration file:\nGRUB_DEFAULT=\"Ubuntu, with Linux 3.2.0-30-generic-pae\"\n#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=10\n#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=1\nGRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"\"\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\"\n\nFirst, write the name of the OS that you want to boot to directly. Mine is Ubuntu. So you will write it as in the GRUB_DEFAULT=\"Ubuntu, with Linux x.x.x-xx-generic-pae\"\nthen I used 1 second in the GRUB_TIMEOUT= to give me 1 second before selecting the default OS (if I need to boot to another OS for example Xubuntu)\nas for GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"\" if you remove quite splash it will show you texts instead of the Ubuntu logo during the booting process (I like it this way :P )\n\nThere is another solution: \nThere is a program called boot-repair which helps in configuring with a GUI.\n\n\nas you can see from the image. there is a box called Unhide boot menu. Just uncheck the box and press appy. You can access this by clicking on the advanced options arrow.\nto install boot repair\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair\n\nand then run boot-reapir either from the terminal or from the dash.\n\n3rd solution:\nou can use an easy to use GUI app called grub-customizer to make your life a little easy. As the name suggests, you can do much more than just reordering Grub menu entries with it.\nYou can install it by:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\n\nas you can see from the menu there is show menu option. Unhceck and see if it works\n\nA: GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT and GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET options are deprecated. So comment those out.\nTo skip the menu and show it only when holding ESC, add:\nGRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE='countdown'\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=1\n\nSample /etc/default/grub\nGRUB_DEFAULT=0\n#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\n#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=1\nGRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=countdown\nGRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"\"\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\"\n\nGRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE:\nIf this option is set to countdown or hidden, then, before\ndisplaying the menu, GRUB will wait for the the timeout set by\nGRUB_TIMEOUT to expire.  If ESC is pressed during that time, it will display the GRUB menu and wait for input.\n\nA: I could solve that issue by adding the following line to /etc/default/grub\nGRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=true\n\n...and then running sudo update-grub.\nExplanation: The file /boot/grub/grub.cfg is generated by running update-grub using the files in /etc/grub.d and /etc/default/grub. Therefore you should not edit grub.cfg, but it can be helpful to find out why the timeout is set. Search for lines starting with set timeout= and then search for the next line starting with  ### END /etc/grub.d/ .... This might give you hints which script sets the timeout. In my case the os-prober script was responsible for the timeout. It turns out that there is a 10s hardcoded timeout in /etc/grup.d/30_os-prober which is not set by GRUB_TIMEOUT. You can either disable os-prober by GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=true or edit /etc/grup.d/30_os-prober or use GRUB_OS_PROBER_SKIP_LIST to skip some of your harddisk partitions (30_os-prober is used when another OS is found somewhere). See this Q&A for details. As others pointed out another reason might be the recordfail, in this case set GRUB_RECORDFAIL_TIMEOUT=$GRUB_TIMEOUT.\n\nA: My Ubuntu had always a timeout of 30 seconds either I would have set a value or not. Here after is how I have found out that recordfail was the missing value.\n1. Verify the actual grub script /boot/grub/grub.cfg\nIMHO, the best way to verify what Grub will do, is to open /boot/grub/grub.cfg. It is the script automatically generated by grub-mkconfig using templates from /etc/grub.d and settings from /etc/default/grub.\nAround the line 109, you will see see something like:\n108 if [ \"${recordfail}\" = 1 ] ; then\n109   set timeout=30 # Note here this value\n110 else\n111   if [ x$feature_timeout_style = xy ] ; then\n112     set timeout_style=hidden\n113     set timeout=3\n114   # Fallback hidden-timeout code in case the timeout_style feature is\n115   # unavailable.\n116   elif sleep --interruptible 3 ; then\n117     set timeout=0\n118   fi\n119 fi\n\nIn my case with the help of that generated script, I could find out that the recordfail variable was unset.\n2. If the recordfail variable is unset, set it\nOpen /etc/default/grub in your favourite text editor (e.g. vim) and then set the variable GRUB_RECORDFAIL_TIMEOUT to a given value, for example 5 seconds.\nYour config file should look like:\nGRUB_DEFAULT=0\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=3\nGRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\nGRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\"\nGRUB_RECORDFAIL_TIMEOUT=5\n\n3. Update the configuration to run with update-grub\nLast step, update the configuration to run with update-grub. For now on, GRUB2 will use the set timeout. This command will regenerate the /boot/grub.cfg file.\n4. Verify the generated script result\nAgain, open /boot/grub.cfg and check the result around the line 109:\n108 if [ \"${recordfail}\" = 1 ] ; then\n109   set timeout=5 # Note here this value\n110 else\n111   if [ x$feature_timeout_style = xy ] ; then\n112     set timeout_style=hidden\n113     set timeout=3\n114   # Fallback hidden-timeout code in case the timeout_style feature is\n115   # unavailable.\n116   elif sleep --interruptible 3 ; then\n117     set timeout=0\n118   fi\n119 fi\n\nNote that the value at line 109 is now 5 instead of 30 as before.\n\nA: I had the problem that the grub menu appeared always after I used the AUFS (unionfs) to put the root filesystem readonly. I had phisically to hit the enter key at the server after every boot. I followed the instructions here : disable grub 2 menu. Since, I had no problems at all.\nEdit the /boot/grub/grub.cfg and change:\nif [ ${recordfail} = 1 ]; then\n  set timeout=-1\nelse\n  set timeout=10\nfi\n\nTo \nif [ ${recordfail} = 1 ]; then\n  set timeout=1\nelse\n  set timeout=10\nfi\n\n", "Q: How to configure an Ubuntu server so that all traffic goes through a VPN?

To do it the simple way - enable acting as a gateway for any traffic it knows a route for - uncomment the net.ipv4.forward line in /etc/sysctl.conf, and reread it:\nsudo sed -i s/\\#net\\.ipv4\\.ip_forward/net\\.ipv4\\.ip_forward/ /etc/sysctl.conf\nsudo sysctl -p\n\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Error: File not found Error: File not found.\nPress any key to continue...-- \nI get this when after I choose Ubuntu on start.

If I try to access the drive from windows 7 by using \"\\nicholas-desktop\" it fails saying it cannot locate \"nicholas-desktop.\" However, if I use the current IP address assigned to my machine by my router's DHCP server by typing \"\\192.168.2.XXX\" I have no problems accessing the share. if I try to ping my ubuntu machine's hostname from windows it fails. \nThe same happens if I try to ping my windows machine, \"nicholas-laptop\" from my ubuntu machine.

I have tried enabling SAMBA'a WINS server so I could resolve the hostnames using netBIOS, however that didn't work either, I may have made a mistake setting it up though.\n\nA: Hi a couple of thoughts,\n\n\n*\n\n*you don't need name for windows share to access. \\\\<desktop_ip_address>\\nicholas_share works just as fine.\n\n*as other pointed out, you don't have a DNS server to resolve name to IP. If your router acts as a DNS server, since it does DHCP, check if it has any options to add names to IPs, or register host names on DHCP. It all depends on the router.\n\n*how do you keep the current IP for the desktop. If the desktop acts as a server, then it should have a reserved lease IP address or a static IP address. Once a name is cached to the IP, sometimes it remains cached, and when the IP changes, wondrous things can happen.\n\n*Have you checked that your windows has network discovery enabled for the home network?

The system-wide file that causes your per-user configuration lives in /etc/fonts/conf.d/50-user.conf (actually it's a symlink to a file in conf.avail, but it's its presence in conf.d that makes it work here). Do you have that file?\nIf you're using 12.10, you'll see in it that the ~/.fonts.conf* locations are deprecated, meaning that support for them will be removed in a future version, so you shouldn't put your configuration there. Put it in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fontconfig/fonts.conf instead. On Ubuntu by default $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is ~/.config, so if you haven't changed this (which you probably haven't) the location for you to put your per-user customisation is ~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf.\nWhen using 12.04, however, ~/.fonts.conf is the right location as you'll see that 50-user.conf doesn't have the other entries there.

Since this conflicts with the stored key on your machine ssh will ask if you still trust that machine. \nThe first time you connect to a machine ssh will ask you if you trust that key. If you do then that key is copied to the known_hosts file for that user. \nLook in the known_hosts file and remove the entry for the remote machine. Now when you connect you should be asked to accept the new key. By moving the file, you will probably have triggered the creation of a new known_hosts file for the first key that you import and will have lost the records of the other machine you may have connected to. \n\nA: You can also remove just the offending key with this command:\nssh-keygen -f \"~/.ssh/known_hosts\" -R hostname_or_ip_address\n\n", "Q: How do I enable changes in /etc/lirc/lircrc without reboot I have installed lirc, and I want to use irexec to control my music player daemon (mpd) using mpc commands from my mce remote control.

As soon as the rotation happens, tail stops displaying. I did some investigations and it is a bug in Debian : Debian Bug Report. The bug has been around for a long time ago. Does anyone knows if this bug in Ubuntu is to be fixed?\nI'm on Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit. I don't have to mention that this bug is total hell! Every time I have the problem, I have to interrupt the command tail and re-execute the command!\n\nA: The Gnu coreutils version of tail has the --follow[={name|descriptor}] parameter, which allows you to follow the file name rather than the descriptor. It continues to tail files even after they rotate or truncate. From the help output:\n\nWith --follow (-f), tail defaults to following the file descriptor, which\n  means that even if a tail'ed file is renamed, tail will continue to track\n  its end.  This default behavior is not desirable when you really want to\n  track the actual name of the file, not the file descriptor (e.g., log\n  rotation).  Use --follow=name in that case.  That causes tail to track the\n  named file in a way that accommodates renaming, removal and creation.\n\nI'm on Fedora, but I believe that you can install the Gnu coreutils on Ubuntu with the following command:\nsudo apt-get install coreutils\n\n\nA: You can automate the interruption and resumption of your tail command by adding the requisite commands to your logrotate configs.  See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LinuxLogFiles#Log_Rotation - in short, you will probably want to put the command in /etc/cron.daily/logrotate, the system-wide crontab which handles rotation.\n\nA: As stated in the bug report, you can bypass the malfunctioning inotify code with:\ntail ---disable-inotify servicemix.log\n\nIt will then use an older polling behavior.\n", "Q: Bluetooth adapter turned from working fine to unrecognized i had been using bluetooth fine, with devices working, but today when i turned on my computer again bluetooth strangely failed.\nthere is a bluetooth icon on the top bar, showing \"bluetooth on\", but if i click on the \"bluetooth settings\" item, a system settings window shows up and shows me a bluetooth on-off switch which is disabled (i.e. fixed to off).\nmore information about my case:\n\n\n*\n\n*i am a new linux used, coming from windows, and do not know supposedly-obvious commands.\n\n*i am using a laptop. it initially doesn't have bluetooth. i bought a built-in type (instead of USB type) bluetooth module, and added it inside the laptop. hence, i do not have a specific FN+* key for bluetooth. in windows, i needed to install an additional driver that was intended for other machines in my laptop's seires which have built-in (i.e. factoryly built-in)j bluetooth modules. the Fn+* key seemed to only affect wifi under ubuntu.\n\n*i have been successfully using magicmouse with my later-added built-in bluetooth module/adapter on both windows and ubuntu\n\n*i have been trying to tweak the magicmouse scrolling speed with commands rmmod something, modprobe hid_magicmouse --scroll_speed=45 --scroll_acceleration=30 or something, then added a file `/etc/modprobe.d/magicmouse.conf\". the mouse seemed to be working fine with these changes.\n\n*now if i run commands like hcitool dev, the shell tells me that i do not have any \"Devices\" or \"adapters\".\n\n*i seem to have bluez installed, because when i type \"blue\" then tab-autocomplete, a bunch of commands like bluez-test-device pops up.\n\n\n-- update --\nsome commands and their results:\neasoncxz@eason-Aspire-4741-ubuntu:/etc$ hcitool dev\nDevices:\neasoncxz@eason-Aspire-4741-ubuntu:/etc$ hcitool scan \nDevice is not available: No such device\neasoncxz@eason-Aspire-4741-ubuntu:/etc$ rfkill list \n0: phy0: Wireless LAN\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: no\n1: acer-wireless: Wireless LAN\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: no\n2: acer-bluetooth: Bluetooth\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: no\neasoncxz@eason-Aspire-4741-ubuntu:/etc$ rfkill list \n0: phy0: Wireless LAN\n    Soft blocked: yes\n    Hard blocked: no\n1: acer-wireless: Wireless LAN\n    Soft blocked: yes\n    Hard blocked: no\n2: acer-bluetooth: Bluetooth\n    Soft blocked: yes\n    Hard blocked: no\n\n\nA: Just figured this out and had the same symptoms as you.

Copy is similar; use Ctrl+Shift+C to copy from a terminal.\n\nArild's comment explains (edited a bit):\n\nFollowing tradition, some Ctrl+(letter) shortcuts are mapped to entering control characters in the terminal (see How control characters map to keyboards on Wikipedia).

Python2 is at this point also installed by default (AFAIK), and importantly, /usr/bin/python is still a symlink to python2.7.\nThe transition to Python3 has been done such that it has zero effect on existing Python2 applications. 2 and 3 are parallel installable, and install their site packages in different locations.\nIf you want your app to use Python3, you'll have explicitly change the shebang to:\n#!/usr/bin/python3\n\nSee Python 3 on Ubuntu for more details.\n\nA: the hash bang should be:\n#!/usr/bin/env pythonX.Y.Z\n\nand not\n#!/usr/bin/pythonX.Y.Z\n\nThis way the code will work even if python is not in /usr/bin/python but say /usr/local/bin/python or /opt/python2.7/bin/python and all is in $PATH.\nIt even makes the code work on OSX.

Once that was removed (oddly there was a vga=1 as well, got rid of that too), the Intel drivers work as expected again.\nI will attempt another upgrade to Mesa 9 over the weekend, hopefully it won't lead me straight back to this thread.\n\nI tried pretty much everything I could find:\n$ _ apt-get purge 'bumblebee*' 'nvidia-current*' 'nvidia-settings*'\n$ _ reboot\n$ _ apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dri libgl1-mesa-dri:i386 libgl1-mesa-dev mesa-common-dev libgl1-mesa-glx:i386 libgl1-mesa-glx libglapi-mesa libglapi-mesa:i386 libgles2-mesa libgles1-mesa libegl1-mesa-drivers libopenvg1-mesa libegl1-mesa libosmesa6:i386 libosmesa6 libdrm-nouveau1a libdrm-nouveau1a:i386 xserver-xorg-core libdrm-dev libdrm2 libdrm2:i386 libdrm-radeon1 libdrm-radeon1:i386 libdrm-nouveau1a libdrm-nouveau1a:i386 libdrm-intel1:i386 libdrm-intel1 libkms1 libgbm1 --reinstall\n$ _ reboot\n$ _ rm -f /usr/lib/xorg/modules/extensions/libglx.so* /usr/lib/xorg/modules/extensions/nvidia_drv.so\n$ _ reboot\n$ _ rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n$ _ reboot\n$ _ apt-get install bumblebee\n\nSo essentially, I purged everything, re-installed everything and still nothing.\nI followed the advise in Enable hardware-accelerated desktop effects with NVIDIA Optimus/Bumblebee:\n$ ls -l /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/xorg/extra-modules\n\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 53 Oct 18 17:58 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/xorg/extra-modules -> /etc/alternatives/x86_64-linux-gnu_xorg_extra_modules\n    $ ls -l /etc/alternatives/x86_64-linux-gnu_xorg_extra_modules\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 48 Oct 18 17:58 /etc/alternatives/x86_64-linux-gnu_xorg_extra_modules -> /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/xorg/x11-extra-modules\n    $ ls -l /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/xorg/x11-extra-modules\ntotal 0\n\n$ uname -a\nLinux stan-inspiron 3.2.0-32-generic #51-Ubuntu SMP Wed Sep 26 21:33:09 UTC 2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n$ $ cat /etc/lsb-release \nDISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu\nDISTRIB_RELEASE=12.04\nDISTRIB_CODENAME=precise\nDISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=\"Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS\"\n\n\n$ update-alternatives --display x86_64-linux-gnu_gl_conf\nx86_64-linux-gnu_gl_conf -

I'm preparing an old system with 256 Mb RAM to send it to some children. It doesn't have Ethernet controller and there are no Internet access at the destination. I've chosen Edubuntu for obvious reasons and modified it with UCK trying to minimize memory usage just to install, let alone using it yet.\nBut Ubiquity won't start even in openbox (edited /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf) because there are no space left on /cow right after booting. I've already deleted things like ibus, zeitgeist, update-manager (no network access after all), twisted-core, plymouth logos.\nI'm thinking about creating a swap partition on HDD, can it be later added to expand this /cow ?\nThis behavior is reproducible in VM limited to 256Mb RAM.\nThis question is moved to a follow-up below: Is there a package for the text-mode installation which is used on Alternate CDs? I don't want to re-create Edubuntu from an Alternate CD.\nFollow-ups:\nHow to move packages from the live image to a pool on the disc?\nWhere is the source code for Alternate CD installer?\n\nA: After all I've used Alternate CD and added all necessary packages to it:\nHow to move packages from the live image to a pool on the disc?\n\nA: I am not sure why you would want to install any Ubuntu flavor on a machine that old. Ubuntus (Edubuntu included) are not designed for a small footprint or compatibility with older hardware. Why don't you use a lightweight distribution? Something like Arch or Gentoo or DamnSmallLinux? \nEdubuntu is just a normal Ubuntu linux with certain packages installed. There is nothing that special about it. You can use any distribution and install the necessary packages. Just go through Edubuntu's included packages and choose what you want. \nAlso, do not use Ubiquity. I would recommend not using a Desktop Environment at all, or if you really want to, go for something simple like LXDE. Otherwise you will not have the resources to run it. Personally, I would just install a simple Window Manager and no Desktop Environment at all. Look at fluxbox, openbox, WindowMaker etc. There are many choices, this is Linux! :)\nAs for swap, I am not clear on what /cow is but a swap partition will not \"expand\" your hard drive. If anything, it will reduce your available space since you will use some of it for the swap partition. You can think of it as a kind of extra RAM (emphasis on the \"kind of\").\nIn any case, on a system with 256MB RAM you most definately will need a swap partition of at least 1.5 * RAM = 284 MB. I would recommend using more but it depends on your hard drive.\n", "Q: Never before had a problem with Ubuntu desktop graphical display; Trying to use nvidia GT630 I've been using ubuntu since 9.04 and never had a problem with Ubuntu bringing up the desktop graphical user interface.  However I am currently not able to see anything graphical past the install screens.\nI have an Intel DP55KG motherboard and just installed an nvidia gt630 graphics card (zotac), since the old graphics card failed.\nI can install the server and see text.  So I do a apt-get install ubuntu-desktop...or apt-get install kubuntu-desktop...or apt-get install xubuntu desktop, but after the reboot there is no display...its like something is hung up.  I tried using the Live quantal dvd and I do see the graphical prompt to try without installing, but after that the screen goes blank.  I've tried two monitors and the same thing happens.  There is a faint \"glow\" on the screen and I do not get a \"no input signal\" from the monitor, so something is happening.\nI can install an old OEM of XP so I know the video card and motherboard are at least semi functional.\nAny help is appreciated.\nThanks,\nGreg\n\nA: SOLVED\nThis was an issue with the boot process hanging not with anything video related!\nAt first my video card failed, which I replaced. When I could not boot to desktop, I used recovery mode to see the boot process hang at intel e1000. So I disabled internal lan in bios.\nStill the thing wouldn't boot to desktop. I used the recovery mode again and found the boot process hanging on rt2800pci ! So I removed my airlink wireless card and...presto!...I can boot to GUI desktop.\nStrange to me that some OSs (Live FreeBSD) don't get hung up on hangs while others do. Also strange to me that Ubuntu server doesn't get hung up, but when overlaying ubuntu-desktop or kubuntu-desktop or xubuntu desktop it does!\nLesson: Always start trouble-shooting the recovery mode issue! \nThis event was two network hardware failures. I got distracted thinking it was a video issue because of the different behavior of server boot and server with gui overlay boot.\n", "Q: Problem with upgrading Ubuntu I tried updating Ubuntu 12.04 by following the guide at http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/upgrade but I received this error message: \n\nWhat do I do?\n\nA: \nThe solution is simple.Take the first key you have problem with, for\n  example 082CCEDF94558F59, take the last 8 symbols (in this case -\n  94558F59) and run the following in the terminal: Code:\ngpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv 94558F59\ngpg --export --armor 94558F59 | sudo apt-key add -\n\nThen repeat this step with every problematic key.\n\ni found it here GPG error: http://ppa.launchpad.net lucid Release: The following signatures couldn \n\nA: Either you get the keys or you just disable the ppa for the upgrade to 12.04/10.\nto disable the ppa open up the \"software sources\", which you will find with the unity dash, and uncheck spotify's repository in \"Other Software\".\n\nafter this is done, try the system upgrade again using the \"Update Manager\" which also can be found in the dash\nIf you want to get the new public key for spotify instead, you have to open a terminal and use these 2 commands\ngpg --keyserver subkeys.pgp.net --recv-key 94558F59\ngpg --export  94558F59 | sudo apt-key add -\nafter you successfully executed these commands try the upgrade again.\n", "Q: Ubuntu with KDE and kernel 3.6.2 - performance issues I have recently swiched to Ubuntu and installed KDE on it.\nI like software included in Ubuntu but interface from Kubuntu.\nMy problem is, that after installation of Linux kernel 3.6.2 (default Ubuntu 12.04 is 3.2 I think), whole KDE interface is laggy and I have to render using Xrender because OpenAL doesn't work.\nSo please tell me, I didint find it anywhere, Does KDE has some problems with new kernel? should I downgrade back to 3.x.x?\nThank you for answers and your time.\nPelda\n\nA: when you login u can choose old kernel on GRUB menu with advance menu and open konsole\n\n\n*\n\n*You can check your current used kernel with this command:\nuname -r\n\n\n*To find a list of all installed kernels on your system, run this command:\ndpkg --list | grep linux-image\n\n\n*To remove all unused kernels, run now this command:\nsudo aptitude purge ~ilinux-image-\\[0-9\\]\\(\\!`uname -r`\\)\n\nIn case aptitude is not installed, then install it with this command:\nsudo apt-get install aptitude\n\n\n*Update now your Grub2 boot loader with this command:\nsudo update-grub\n\n", "Q: Transmission shutdown script for multiple torrents?

This is sometimes done by client libraries -- for example, a Python script could use python transmissionrpc. There are other interfaces like this listed at http://www.transmissionbt.com/resources/ .\nHere's a quick approach that will use transmission-remote to count the number of non-idle downloads:\ntransmission-remote yourhost:yourport -tall --info | grep \"^  State:\" | grep \"Down\" | wc --lines\n\nIf you want to include idle downloads too, you could try this:\ntransmission-remote yourhost:yourport -l | grep -v -e \" 100% \" -e \"^Sum\" -e \"^ID\" -e \" Stopped \" | wc --lines\n\nWhere \"^ID\" and \"^Sum\" strips the header and footer; \" 100% \" strips completed torrents; and \" Stopped \" strips out the incomplete-but-paused torrents. This approach isn't foolproof -- for example, a torrent named \" 100% Stopped \" would break it.\n\nA: I created a better script(from user98677 advice) which takes advantage of transmission's RPC Interface.\nCode:\n\nGithub Gist: https://gist.github.com/khurshid-alam/6474227\n\nWhat it Does?\n\n\n*\n\n*Pause or remove completed torrents after they are completed.\n\n*Send a pushover notification (with curl)[optional]\n\n*Send a twitter notification (requires twidge)[optional]\n\n*Suspend/Shutdown Computer OR leave it as it is.\n\nScreenshot\n\nSetup\nOn Ubuntu\nsudo apt-get install libnotify-bin\nsudo apt-get install transmission-cli\n\nOn Ubuntu >= 13.04 (For twitter notification):\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:moorhen-core/moorhen-apps\nsudo apt-get install twidge\n\nFor suspend action on non-Ubuntu distro (Ubuntu uses Upower) install powermanagement-interface package\nsudo apt-get install powermanagement-interface\n\nAfter installation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get the code from github-gist & save the file as trsm anywhere on your hard-drive.

I have laptop with GT 650M and that's also a Optimus card. Optimus cards behaves a little differently and there is no Linux support for them by default. More info about Optimus in linux: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1657660\nBut it's possible to get it working with Bumblebee.

Good way to test the difference between integrated graphics and your graphic card is to run glxspheres with and without optirun.\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee\nThis saves power when you activate your graphic card only when it's needed. I hope I helped someone, because I have spent hours to find out the problem with my graphics card (yup, I'm quite new with these Linux graphics drivers).\n\nA: I had the same thing happen.  Here is how I fixed it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Switch to a terminal Ctrl+Alt+F1.\n\n*Login as your username.\n\n*Install linux headers: \nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic\n\n\n*Uninstall nvidia driver - this depends on which version you installed :\nsudo apt-get remove nvidia-current\n\nor \nsudo apt-get remove nvidia-current-updates \n\nor \nsudo apt-get remove nvidia-experimental-304\n\n\n*Reinstall nvidia driver\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current-updates\n\nWhen you do this, it must say something like:\nBuilding initial module for 3.5.0-17-generic\nDone.\n\nIf it says\nModule build for the currently running kernel was\nskipped since the kernel source for this kernel\ndoes not seem to be installed.\n\nthen the problem will not be solved. Do not believe the message.\nIt is not asking for linux-source to be install, it does only want\nthe headers but you must install the specific -generic headers for\nyour kernel. Run:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`\n\nIt will not work with just linux-headers-generic or linux-headers-3.5.0-17 (for example).\n\n*If it successfully installs, restart the computer :\nsudo shutdown -r now\n\nThis should allow the kernel module to compile and install properly.  It did for me!\n\nA: After meddling with this for a few evenings (disappearing unity desktop, 640x480 resolution only, weird artefacts on my screen) on my Geforce GT 630, this is what worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fresh install of Ubuntu 12.10\n\n*Immediately after install, run software updater. Download & Install all updates\n\n*Reboot\n\n*sudo apt-get install linux-sources && sudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic (I'm not entirely sure whether/why this step is necessary, but I saw it in this thread and thought I'd give it a try)\n\n*Open \"Software Sources\" from the Dash\n\n*Click \"additional drivers\" tab.\n\n*Activate NVIDIA binary xorg driver (proprietary, tested)\n\n*Reboot\n\n\nso far so good - I have the NVIDIA settings panel (without the Xconfig error message), dual monitors, and high resolution.\nSpecial note: do NOT install the \"additional drivers\" package (Jockey). This package actually seems to disappear after step 2 (software updates) - the method for adding additional drivers seems to have moved to the \"software sources\" app.\n\nA: I just installed Ubuntu 12.10 today, and had this issue with nvidia driver.\nI tried to follow above instructions, but all these failed because of two words that are quite important: \"generic\" and \"-17\".\nI eventually found that the best way of installing NVidia driver is to actually use installer privided by nvidia. So I went to:\nhttp://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us\nand downloaded version for Linux-64bit \n(install synaptic sudo apt-get install synaptic and look in the menu Settings -> Repository -> Additional Drivers to find out the exact name of your nvidia card)\nThen you run the tool and it says you need kernel headers, however read carefully because it requires \"generic\" headers.\nYou need to verify your kernel version, mine was 3.5.0-17 (this \"-17\" at the end matters), so in my case I did:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-3.5.0-17-generic\n\n(find out your kernel version by typing ina terminal uname -r)\nYou need to kill GUI login daemon:\nkillall lightdm\n\nand after that you may run:\nsudo sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-310.19.run\n\nInstaller will probably tell you that Noveau kernel module is loaded and will suggest adding modprobe script. You should say Ok/Yes to all whatever it tells you and then reboot and run NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-310.19.run again.\nNot sure if other approach would work as well, but this one does for sure.\n\nA: This also works for the Nvidia 7400 cards. \nBut if the kernel updates you must change the install line to the latest version now it is: \nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-3.5.0-18-generic\n\ninstead off:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-3.5.0-17-generic\n\n\nA: sudo apt-get install nvidia-current nvidia-settings\nsudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.old\nsudo nvidia-xconfig\n\nReboot the system!\n\nA: I tried almost everything, but here is the one that really worked for me:\nrun the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:amith/ubuntutools\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install unity-reset\n\nthen reset unity with this command:\nunity-reset\n\nreboot and Unity is back!! I hope it works for you.\n\nA: I solved the problem tonight. I installed the latest Kernel 3.7.1 after compiling it like I always do. Then I installed the nVidia drivers from Synaptic. This caused the Unity menus to disappear like what you show in your screenshot. The solution for me is below:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current nvidia-settings\n\nNow not only is the problem solved by you have the very latest nVidia drivers!\n\nA: If your install doesn't work (initial module not building), you have to make sure you only have one set of headers installed. \ndpkg --get-selections | grep linux-headers\n\nThis doesn't work\nlinux-headers-3.5.0-26              install\nlinux-headers-3.5.0-26-generic      install\nlinux-headers-generic               install\n\nThis works\nlinux-headers-3.5.0-26              install\nlinux-headers-3.5.0-26-generic      install\n\nIn this case, simply\napt-get remove linux-headers-generic\n\nNow, the nvidia installer will work.\n\nA: I did this:\nsudo apt-get autoremove fglrx --purge\n\nWorked great.\n", "Q: Unable to login - account disabled Ah, recently, I've been unable to login to my main master account, as it would return me to the login screen after entering my password. Thinking I could just delete the account and make a new one, I logged in via the guest account, went to 'User Accounts' and authenticated with the main account's password. I was successfully able to delete the account, and create a new one. Once I returned to the login screen to log in with my new account, it asked for a password, though I hadn't set one. The old password does not work either. I returned to the guest account, went to 'User Accounts', to see that the Password field shows \"Account Disabled\" for my new account. Since I deleted my old account, I am unable to authenticate with the master password. I cannot add, change, or delete any accounts - nor can I login to it.

I've got a dual-booting laptop - Windows 7 & Linux Mint 13 - and I want to get rid of Mint, keep Windows 7 and install Ubuntu 12.04.\nAlso, I want to have a separate home partition (I've only got one disk drive) so that if I want to go back to Mint (or any other distro) then I won't have to overwrite my home folder again.\nAnyone tell me - in newbie friendly terms - how to do that?\n\nA: First things first, make sure you have all your files backed up to a different device.\nWhen installing Ubuntu,you'll be prompted to choose your installation type. Select \"Something else\".  \nThis will take you to the Gparted partition editor.\nYou should see one or more NTFS partitions. That is (these are) your Windows partition(s). Then you should see an ext3 or ext4 partition. That will be where your LinuxMint is currently installed.\n\nFrom your description you want to overwrite your Mint partition and add a separate /home partition.  \nTo do this, Double click your Mint partition (/dev/sda5 in this example). This will allow you to edit the partition.  \nResize this partition. Make sure it is at least 4GB. IN this example I chose 6GB. To figure how many MB you need, Multiply 1024 by the number of GB. (example: 1024 x 6GB = 6144MB)\nSelect Format partition. Later when you apply these settings All Data will be lost!!!\nYou'll want to set the mount point to /.\n \nWhen you select \"Continue\" a Warning will pop up. Please understand that this will write to disk. And you could lose data on the edited partition.\nThis should leave you an new grey \"Free space\".\n \nDouble click on \"Freespace\", to \"Create New Partition\". In the dialog box that pops up select ext4 and set the mount point as /home.   \nYour final out come should look similar to this.\n \nContinue with the installation.  \nFor more information on using Gparted checkout dedoimedo.com\n", "Q: How do I install Burg in Ubuntu 12.04?

With that said, you may not be able to access the tty's easily, so if a deep problem arises where you cannot use your graphical environment(or worse, if GRUB were to fail) then it is harder to diagnose it as the screen for GRUB prompts and the tty you can see with Ctrl+Alt+F1 may be unreadable. You can try pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1 to see whether you get a readable prompt to log in, and use Ctrl+Alt+F7 to return to the GUI. If you don't, you should be warned that recovery or TTY mode may be extremely difficult to use. \nIn a nutshell, it won't hurt anything, but if something breaks, it may be harder to fix it.\n\nA: Have the same issue on one of my older boxes. A while ago I read in the ubuntuusers.de wiki it's simply because some Nividia graphic cards/drivers lack support for that type of graphic during boot.

I am running Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.2.0-29-generic-pae i686) which according to the Ubuntu documentation contains Grub2.\nHowever grub --version gives me grub (GNU GRUB 0.97), but grub-mkconfig --version gives me grub-mkconfig (GRUB) 1.99-21ubuntu3.4\nDo I have 2 versions of Grub installed simultaneously? If so, what is the easiest and safest way to remove one.\nIf not, which configuration file should I edit? I have edited /etc/grub.d/40_custom to contain a password, but running update-grub does not appear to include this in the grub.cfg file.\n\nA: grub2 doesn't have a \"grub\" command, only grub legacy has that. And grub legacy does not have a grub-mkconfig command, only grub2 has that. So yes, you have two versions of grub installed. My guess is that you have the grub-common package installed, which contains grub-mkconfig but you do not have the grub-pc package which contains most of grub2's files and is needed for grub on a BIOS based PC (if you have UEFI firmware, you may want grub-efi-amd64). I believe that to be the case because the package \"grub\" (containing grub-legacy) and the package \"grub-pc\" (containing most of grub2) conflict and therefore cannot be installed at the same time. Because you have grub legacy installed, \"update-grub\" is modifying grub legacy's /boot/grub/menu.lst rather than using grub-mkconfig to write a /boot/grub/grub.cfg.\nThe solution is simple: \nIf you have a BIOS based system then just install the grub-pc package (which will automatically remove the grub package).\nIf you have a UEFI based system then install grub-efi-amd64.\nIf you don't know which you have, say so in a comment and I will help you figure that out.\n\nA: It is important to point out here that the word \"installed\" has two meanings for grub (or lilo). You have installed in your filesystem the tools and images for two grub packages. You have installed in your MBR (probably) one version of the actual grub bootloader. Uninstalling the packages won't affect your bootloader, although you might find yourself wanting to use the packages to modify your bootloader configuration later.\n\nA: Yeah, I think I also have 2 versions of GRUB.  First I used 12.04, and I used Grub Customizer to give it background image and give Windows & Ubuntu friendlier entry names (instead of 'Ubuntu with Linux 3.0234.123.5.12412-02131/2.321-generic on /dev/sda4').  Then I installed 12.10, and it replaced Grub with an ugly black screen, and now Ubuntu 12 has 3 entries, 2 of which lead to the same sda7.  However, when I run GRUB Customizer, it still displays the old entries from when I used to have 12.04.\nHow do I get only 1 copy of grub on my machine?\nAs in, how can I know for sure I have 2, and how can I delete one?\n", "Q: 12.04 making BCM4313 card work with aircrack-ng?

I am trying to upgrade to a new Ubuntu version but the update manager does not recognize an update.

But, now the problem is that every time I switch wireless networks, I have to give that command. how do I make this permanent?\n\nA: You need to edit your DNS configuration.\nType gksudo gedit /etc/resolv.conf in the terminal. Add your DNS ( eg 8.8.8.8 ) in place of 127.0.0.1.\nAs pointed out, this configuration may be overwritten.

To restore it, do the following in a terminal.\nsudo apt-get install resolvconf\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure resolvconf\n\nIf you want to use 8.8.8.8 as your nameserver then set up either ifup or NetworkManager to use that nameserver address for the interface(s) that it brings up.\nIf you use ifup then edit /etc/network/interfaces and, in the stanza for the interface in question, add the line \"dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8\"; then ifdown the interface and ifup it again.\nIf you use NetworkManager then open the connection editor and add 8.8.8.8 as an additional nameserver address (network indicator | Edit Connections... | Wireless | myconnection | Edit... | IPv4 Settings | Additional DNS servers).\n", "Q: Unity Gwibber lens doesn't work 12.10 Is there something Specific I am needing to do to get the unity Gwibber/Social lens to work.\nI have gone into system settings and added google account, twitter account and facebook account.

I have 2GB installed on my machine running Ubuntu 12.04. After some time of use, I see much of my RAM used. The RAM does not free enough even though I closed all my programs.\nI included 2 screenshots. First is \"Gnome system monitor\" (all process) and second is \"htop\" (with sudo), both sorted by memory usage. From both you see, that it's not possible that all running apps takes together 1GB of memory. First 7 biggest programs sum 250, but others are much smaller (all can't sum even 100MB). The cache is 300MB (yellow ||| on htop) and is not included in 1GB used. Also 260MB is already on swap. (which actually makes 1,3GB of used memory)\nIf i start Firefox (or Chrome) with many tabs, it has only 1GB available and not potentially 1,5 GB (assume 0,5GB is for system). When I need more ram, swapping happens.\nSo where is my ram? Which program is using it? How can i free it, to be available for e.g. Firefox?\nGnome system monitor\n\nhtop\n\n\nA: free -g is probably the best way to tell how much RAM your system is using. See serverfault question here. If you use free -m it will give you a breakdown in Mb.\nIn this example, from a server with 251Gb RAM:\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:           251        130        120          0          3         61\n-/+ buffers/cache:         66        185\nSwap:            5          0          5\n\nOnly 66Gb is actually being used, however top reports 137Gb. The RAM isn't freed from the cache until another program requests it, so if you open up another program that requires the RAM it will be allocated to that program.\nEssentially I wouldn't worry about the RAM that's available, the OS is taking care of this.\n", "Q: ubuntu 12.10 can't find java, but it's exists!

The desktop exists, and once I remember I messed up the compiz settings and just had to press Ctrl+Alt+F1 and in the virtual terminal type unity --reset then sudo reboot. \nEverything worked as if I reinstalled the entire operating system. This time it said:\n\nWarning no variable set. setting to :0. The reset option is now\n  dupricated.\n\n\nWhat am I suppose to do now? I need this fixed as soon as possible because I need a couple of certainly installed programs and the data within them (long story short).\n\nA: So I have just had the exact same issue, these are the steps that I had taken to get everything working OK.\nFirstly, I had a resolution warning so I cleared my xorg config using tty1 (Ctrl+Alt+F1), login and execute the following commands:\nsudo su -\ncp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.back\necho \"\" > /etc/X11/xorg.conf\nreboot -r now\n\nSecondly, I ran the re-install packages command to update everything using:  \nsudo apt-get install -r\n\nLastly, once completed, reboot the machine using:\nsudo reboot -r now\n\nAt this point everything started working again, I just have to redo my NVidia graphics settings.\n\nA: I finally got Unity back at a normal resolution with compiz working as usual (apparently).

If you do not include dependency checks or tests, your users (Ubuntu or Debian) will be very disappointed. Creating a DEB package without dependency checks is like cheating, making the user belief you did something for them which you did not. \nMy advice would be: if you don't want to add the checks by hand, do not generate a DEB package at all. Provide a short line of information that says something like \"Install the software by running install.sh.\". Then users know what to expect.\n", "Q: Plymouth not showing after upgrading to Ubuntu 12.10 After I upgraded to Ubuntu 12.10 today, the Plymouth splash screen is not showing when I startup my computer.

How can this be true?  I have almost all the packages on the DVD.\nIs there something additionally I should do to avoid downloading?\n\nA: It's bad news, I'm afraid.  Canonical removed the ability to upgrade using CD/DVD images from the 12.10 release.   \nAll of the instructions I have seen for upgrading to 12.10 only talk about a network installation, usually using the Update Manager.  See the 12.10 release notes. It is also mentioned in the 12.10 Beta2 Technical Overview, and there are lots of comments and complaints out there on the net.\n\nA: There's a workaround to this: Boot into the Live media and choose \"Test Ubuntu\" instead of \"Install Ubuntu\". Now, open \"Install Ubuntu 12.10\". The upgrade option will now work. :-)\nHowever, an online upgrade is still better as your environment (i.e the software installed & its config is unique to your system. In a DVD upgrade, some stuff may be reset or an interfering application might be installed), however there are bleak chances of this happening.\nIf the upgrade dialog is not displayed for any reason, you may also run the following command using Alt+F2:\n$gksu \"sh /media/cdrom/cdromupgrade\"\n\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Using intel's pin tool on Ubuntu? I'd like to use Intel's pin tool on Ubuntu 12.04 and having trouble installing it. \nI downloaded pin for Linux 64bit from here http://www.pintool.org/, extracted the package and compiled the examples in source/tools/..\nHow do I run pin now? \nTried: \npin\npin.sh\n./pin\n\netc, none seemed to work :( \nDo I need to install any extra libraries or...?\nThanks!\n\nA: Basically pin tools are designed as \"Just In Time (JIT)\" compilers, so the two components behind the architecture are Instrumentation and Analysis Code. As you may know, PIN tools has the ability to instrument the architecture independently. Therefore, as instrumentation occurs immediately before the code sequence execute the first time, you have to treat the program directly with the target benchmark.\nHere are some tips: \nFirst of all go to the parent directory of the Pin tool, the general usage of pin is defined as :\npin [OPTION] [-t <tool> [<toolargs>]] -- <command line>\n\nSecondly, export the path of pin to the env to be able to use it everywhere else (in my case is):\nexport PATH=$PATH:/home/amir/pin-2.12-58423-gcc.4.4.7-linux/\n\nNow you can use it everywhere to pin the instrument (compilation counts, branch takens, etc). \ni.e. :\nThere are some sample sources in order to start working around in \n$ cd source/tools/ManualExamples\n\nlike inscount, linux_buffer, etc. use the make command to g++ compile the source codes:\nmake inscount0.test\n\nand then :\n$ pin -t inscount0.so -- /bin/ls\n\nto get the output of the /bin/ls.\nHope that helps you.\n\nA: Intel's PIN is a binary instrumentation framework, and can be used to instrument binary programs on the fly. To specify what instructions exactly must be instrumented, and with which, you specify a pintool to pin. There's not really any further 'installation'.\nHere an example from the README file on how to use pin:\npin -t obj-intel64/opcodemix.so -- /bin/ls\nThis will instrument and run /bin/ls, the output for this tool is in opcodemix.out.\n\nA: Is your host architecture 64-bit (amd64)?  If so, you'll need to add 32-bit (i386) support as pin is a 32-bit program.  \n$ file pin\npin: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-linux.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.2.5, stripped\n\nFirst add the architecture support to dpkg.\n$ sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\n$ sudo aptitude update   # or apt-get if you use that\n\nThen install the i386 versions of the needed libraries.

In a system with x identically partitioned HDD's each drive has a UEFI boot partition with the bootable flag set. During power on I'm able to select any of the HDD's to boot from using UEFI.\nOnce Ubuntu has started. How do I determine which HDD the system was booted from?\nAn incorrect answer is: The one containing the partition mounted at /boot/efi. It is incorrect as that is written to /etc/fstab when installing Ubuntu. It's not dynamic and does not point to the UEFI partition I actually used to boot.\n\nA: I've not tested this experimentally, so it may not work in practice, but the efibootmgr utility does return a variable called BootCurrent that should identify the boot loader that the EFI launched. For instance:\n$ sudo efibootmgr -v\nBootCurrent: 0001\nTimeout: 3 seconds\nBootOrder: 0000,0001\nBoot0000* EFI DVD/CDROM ACPI(a0841d0,0)PCI(14,1)ATAPI(0,1,0)\nBoot0001* OsLoader0000  ACPI(a0841d0,0)PCI(11,0)03120a00000000000000HD(1,800,5ede2,2c47c282-ee6e-45de-a5ad-e8658ca67de6)File(\\EFI\\BOOT\\BOOTX64.EFI)\n\nThis output indicates that the system was booted via entry 0001 (Boot0001). The -v option to efibootmgr used here adds verbose information, which includes the GUID of the partition on which this boot loader was stored -- 2c47c282-ee6e-45de-a5ad-e8658ca67de6 in this case. Note that this is a partition GUID, not a filesystem UUID. AFAIK, the only way to extract partition GUID data in Linux is via gdisk, cgdisk, or sgdisk. For instance:\n$ sudo sgdisk -i 1 /dev/sda\nPartition GUID code: C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B (EFI System)\nPartition unique GUID: 2C47C282-EE6E-45DE-A5AD-E8658CA67DE6\nFirst sector: 2048 (at 1024.0 KiB)\nLast sector: 390625 (at 190.7 MiB)\nPartition size: 388578 sectors (189.7 MiB)\nAttribute flags: 0000000000000000\nPartition name: 'EFI System'\n\nNote the Partition unique GUID line, which matches the value included in the efibootmgr output (aside from case, which varies). Given the input to sgdisk in this example, it means that partition 1 on /dev/sda (that is, /dev/sda1) held the system's first boot program. You may need to scan all your partitions, or at least all the ones on which EFI boot loaders might be present, to be sure of finding a match. Even then, you might not find a match -- for instance, if the boot loader was on a USB flash drive that's since been removed from the computer, or if you've changed the partition's GUID.\nBased on my check on the system at which I'm sitting, it appears that the efibootmgr -v output reports the boot loader program that the EFI launched. This may not be the same as the one that launched Linux, since the program the EFI launched may have been a boot manager that in turn launched another boot loader. If your system's boot process is simple, this may not matter; but if your boot process includes the possibility of cross-disk redirection, this technique won't be reliable.\n\nA: Once Ubuntu has started, and if grub-efi has been installed in several disks, I think you can't. \n(it is the same problem as with Legacy/mbr boot, AFAIK it wasn't possible to determine from which mbr the pc had started if grub was installed in several MBRs)\n", "Q: How Can I enable Ubuntu One indicator?

Yet there is no icon in top panel.\n\nSync and upload notifications appear normally and Ubuntu one client is functioning correctly. I have several other indicators in my panel but I don't see any probability that one of them is conflicting with ubuntu one indicator.\n1: \n\nA: You will need to install the indicator-sync package as well. You may need to log out and back in after doing so, for the icon to appear in the top panel.\nIf you have not set up Ubuntu One yet, though, it will not appear. You will need to configure Ubuntu One to connect, and then the icon should appear after the client starts. It may take some time after you log in for it to appear, as the client is configured on a delayed start to avoid slowing down log-in.\nThe gir1.2-syncmenu-0.1 package is also required to be installed for the functionality to work. It is installed by default on Ubuntu 12.10, but is only recommended by ubuntuone-client so that it may be uninstalled by users who do not want the indicator. If you've managed to uninstall this package, you will need to re-install it, and then restart the Ubuntu One client.\n\nA: This is not a direct answer to your question, but rather an alternative. You can also install the app called \"Ubuntu One Indicator\".\nType the following commands in the terminal to do so:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:rye/ubuntuone-extras\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install indicator-ubuntuone\n\n\nA: From terminal, type:\nubuntuone-installer\n\nThe above command aims to installer Ubuntu One Service.

For that I don't think editing the umask is good idea.\nThen I tried the sticky bit, but in case of sticky bit only the user who created that file has the permission to delete the file. Again undesired behavior.\nThen I tried, to use acl permissions on that. But on gogoling I got to know that acl is not recursive, therefore the permissions would be lost on 2nd level directory.\nplease suggest something..

I don't want to go for ntfs - I believe I can have this drive as ext4 with the permission problem solved.\nPlease help !!\n\nA: This problem is commonly solved by adding all users into a group and then using sticky bit in directory's permissions to make sure all files in the directory are owned by that group. \nThen the users will have permissions to add/delete files in the directory by virtue of being members of the group.\n", "Q: How to show Windows System Reserved partition using Ubuntu live dvd?

I have Mac OS X Mountain Lion installed and Windows 7 installed using Bootcamp. \nI also have rEFIt installed and both OSes boot up fine... now I just need to figure out how to install Ubuntu with both OSes being happy. Because Windows uses MBR there isn't really room for another partition.\nNow there is a Recovery Partition starting with Lion... so EFI + Recovery + ML + Windows = 4 partitions. Has anyone had any success in triple booting?\nI don't want to virtualize, I want to use it natively. And I really don't want to resort to WUBI, it feels like I'm cheating, and that's a horrible solution for things.\n\nA: You might be able to do it by not using BootCamp. Bootcamp uses the Mac's EFI Compatibility Support Mode that turns your disk from a GPT one to a hybrid MBR which brings with it a whole swag of problems (one of which you have discovered being the 4 partition limit - others include slow boot times, limited multi gpu support, limited partition sizes). \nYour aim would be to install all 3 OS using EFI mode (so that the disk remains as a GPT). I have yet to see a guide that shows how to do it - maybe I need to write one. \nTo begin your project a good start is Rod's Books who has written a ton about EFI booting. \n\nA: Triple booting OS X, Windows and Ubuntu is completely possible and has been done before.\nhttp://lifehacker.com/5531037/how-to-triple+boot-your-mac-with-windows-and-linux-no-boot-camp-required\nInstall the rEFIt Boot Menu for Macs\nHead on over to rEFIt's SourceForge page and download the DMG for the most recent version of the installer. Open it up and launch the installer package, and go through the installation process (which is pretty self-explanatory; it'll do all the work for you). Afterwards, restart your computer to see if it works!\n\nPartition Your Hard Drive with Disk Utility\nWe're going to make three new partitions; one for Windows, one for Linux, and one for our Linux swap space, the space Linux uses if it runs out of memory. To do this, just click on your Macintosh HD partition. If you have multiple partitions already, click on the one from which you want to take back some space. Next, hit the plus sign enough times so that you have four total partitions. Click on your first new partition (the one under \"Macintosh HD\") and on the right side of the window, type \"WINDOWS\" in the name box. Format this Windows partition to MS-DOS, then make the size whatever you want.\nThe sizes don't particularly matter, as long as your OS will fit on the partition, and you have enough extra space for whatever you want.\n\nInstalling Windows\nInsert your Windows installation disk and restart your computer, unless you've already installed it, in which case, move on to installing Ubuntu. As your computer starts up, listen for the familiar Mac startup sound, then immediately press and hold the Option (or \"Alt\") key on your keyboard, until you see a drive icon with the word rEFIt under it.\nGo ahead and navigate through the first few steps of the installation. When you're asked what type of install you want to perform, choose \"custom install\", so you can pick and format the partition. You'll want to choose the one named WINDOWS (obviously), though you'll have to format it by clicking \"drive options\" and then \"Format\". It should reformat that partition to NTFS for you, after which you can hit the next button. It'll take a little while to install, and it'll restart a few times during that process—whenever it does, select the Windows partition on boot (which should show up in rEFIt now, so you won't need to hold option down again).\n\nWhen it's done and you finally get to the Windows desktop, you can go ahead and install the Boot Camp drivers from your OS X installation DVD. Since your eject key won't work yet, you'll have to eject your Windows disk manually by going into Windows Explorer, clicking on your optical drive, then choosing the \"Eject\" button in the toolbar. After inserting your OS X installation DVD, it should start automatically with the option to run setup.exe. Pick that, then let the installation run. Once you're done, head back over to OS X, so you can burn and install Ubuntu.\n\nInstalling Ubuntu\nDownload the Ubuntu ISO file and burn it to a DVD or use a USB bootable media application to write the ISO on a USB flash drive. Boot from the DVD  or USB. It'll take a few minutes for the Ubuntu bootable media to boot, but you should eventually be presented with the option to try Ubuntu or install it on your computer. Choose install, then go through the first few steps of the process, picking your language, time zone, and keyboard type (USA probably works fine, but I usually pick USA - Macintosh because, you know, that's what I have). When you're presented with the partition window, choose the bottom option to \"Specify partitions manually\".\n\nDouble click on your Linux partition's entry. If you've been following this how-to to the letter, it should be /dev/sda4. You'll be presented with a window in which you manually set the partition's characteristics. I chose to use the partition as Ext4, although you can pick something else if you want—Ext4 seems to be the new standard, so I'd recommend it if you don't know the difference between them all. Check the box to format the partition and make the mount point \"/\". Hit OK and double click on your partition at the end of the drive, set it to be used as a swap area, and then hit OK. At this point, your window should look something like this:\n\nGo through the rest of the installation until the last window, where it's ready to install and asks you to double-check everything. Hit the advanced button. Make sure \"install boot loader\" is checked, and change the device for boot loader installation to the same partition on which you installed Linux (in the above case, /dev/sda4). Hit next and let 'er rip. When it's done it should restart your computer and your rEFIt boot menu should contain an option for all three operating systems. If you can successfully boot into both partitions, congratulations! You've got a working triple-boot system.\n\nWhen the Ubuntu installation is finished, installing drivers in Ubuntu can be done after rebooting the computer to Ubuntu by opening the built-in Additional Drivers application\n\nA: You are right in saying windows uses MBR. using rEFIt can help you triple and is quite simple to set up. However a more attractive set up would be to create a hybrid MBR that will manage both windows and linux partitions, so you will not need to install rEFIt if you choose this method.\nI have set up my macbook pro retina using this config and its pretty sweet.

Just google for Ubuntu Themes and find one to your liking. (Ensure that it is both gtk-2.0- and gtk-3.0-compliant. Mostly, the author will make that clear. If not, after extracting the files as described below, you will have to check that the theme has folders for both gtk-2.0 and gtk-3.0.)\nExtract the theme because most themes come as compressed files.\nThen open your home folder and create a new folder titled .themes. Then move your downloaded and uncompressed theme into that folder.\nWhen you've done all that you will need to install an advanced edit tool such as Ubuntu Tweak. It is installable from the Ubuntu Software Center.\nOnce installed, run the program and navigate to the \"themes\" tab and select the appropriate theme. \nEnjoy.\nIf you want to change your Icon theme you must download a new Icon Theme then create a .icons folder within your home folder. Then place the new Icon theme folder inside the .icons folder and you can change that in Ubuntu Tweak as well, under the Themes tab.\nRemember that putting a . in front of a folder will make it hidden and you will need to press Ctrl+H to show hidden folders.\nYou may also want to make a few logical links so that programs running system-wide will pick up your theme and icons:\nsudo ln -s ~/.themes /root/.themes\nsudo ln -s ~/.icons /root/.icons\nsudo ln -s /home/<username>/.gtkrc-2.0 /root/.gtkrc-2.0\nThese steps are based on advice here.\n\n", "Q: Files copied to a NTFS partition in Ubuntu 12.04 missing I had recently downloaded an .iso file in Ubuntu. I decided to burn it in Windows as I am well acquainted (I am using an evaluation copy of Windows 8). So I copied it over to one of the NTFS partitions (D:\\ being the directory under Windows). But when I booted into Windows, I could not find the specified .iso file. Booting back into Ubuntu, I mounted the NTFS partition, but alas! The file was gone from there too!\nIt was a fairly large .iso file and I do not want to download it all over again. Please help me out.\n\nA: Here is the answer I referenced:\nIf you hibernate windows (or purpose or because of power-saving), then use ubuntu to store files on the NTFS partition, and then boot up windows, Windows thinks the disk was corrupted while it was in hibernate and \"fixes\" anything different. After that loging back into ubuntu just confirms that the files have in-fact been deleted.\nAlso I have seen that windows 7 may do a chkdsk after it installs updates on shudown when you bring it back up windows does extra tasks related to installing updates, so be careful not to boot into ubuntu after shutting down from updates. http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-newbie-8/windows-chkdsk-deletes-files-written-by-ubuntu-on-an-ntfs-partition-913606/\nYes even on a shared partition seprate from the windows partition and take care even with fat partitions (usb drives).\nSources, https://superuser.com/questions/211079/what-do-i-have-to-take-care-of-when-hibernating-both-ubuntu-and-windows-dual-bo/211175#211175 , https://superuser.com/questions/39532/hibernating-and-booting-into-another-os-will-my-filesystems-be-corrupted\nEdit: I was looking through the widows site to try and find if they detailed the hibernate process, but this sounds interesting http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd143253(v=winembedded.5).aspx , It seems at best the write caching from the harddrive is being saved to memory, then being written after bringing the drive back up, this may mean that the files can't be recovered, because it's not \"deleting\" as in removing the first letter of the file so the system does not see it, but actually overwriting large areas of data that have been cached. Needs to be looked into more.\n\nA: Sometimes this is because Linux uses the characters in filenames which are invalid in Windows. For example you can save a file with a question mark (?) in its name in Linux (even in an NTFS partition). However, you cannot open it in Windows, and if you run a chkdsk, Windows will delete the file, and puts it in a folder named Found.nnn in the root of the drive with a different name which may become really tricky to find.\n", "Q: Linux kernel not upgraded from 3.2.x to 3.5.x after Ubuntu upgrade from 12.04 LTS to 12.10 (through 12.10 beta) I had upgraded to Ubuntu 12.10 beta from 12.04 LTS.

Usually I use Launchy application to have a quick access to any app/config/file etc. Now I'm trying to get used to Dash, which is supposed to be default way to do such things in recent Ubuntu versions. The difference between the usage of Launchy and Dash is following:\nLaunchy: Alt+Space -> Launchy shell shown instantly -> type your request -> open the target\nDash: SuperKey -> PERIOD -> Dash is shown -> type your request -> PERIOD -> navigate with arrow buttons between the results -> open the desired result\nAnother problem. When I type the term \"ryth\" (which is incorrectly spelled part of \"Rhythmbox\") what is shown in these 2 shells:\nLaunchy: 1 result, which is Rhythmbox. The letters 'r', 'y', 't' and 'h' are highlighted.\nDash: 2 results, which are MP3s from Amazon and are completely irrelevant to my request\nSo is there any way to tweak the Dash to allow me to use it as I use Launchy with the same performance and results?\n\nA: You can use a 'low graphics mode' that Ubuntu 12.10 has. This mode disables some dash and launcher effects like active blur and transparency, this make Unity more responsive with a no powerful graphic card.\nFor activate this mode, you must  add following line to ~/.xprofile (if the file doesn't exist, create it):\n\nexport UNITY_LOW_GFX_MODE=1\n\nLogout, and come back for the effect to take place. This really works for me :-)\nAnd for stop dash show you Amazon results, you can unistall the lens with:\nsudo apt-get remove unity-lens-shopping\n\nAnd of course, logout and come back.\nGrettings!\n\nA: To have launchy behaviour with the power of unity dash I recommend you use synapse. synapse uses the same backend zeitgeist engine to crawl all your activity plus application and commandline run. easy to use ans super fast \"low on resources\" + themeable.\nOpen a terminal and copy past the PPA:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:synapse-core/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install synapse\n\nAfter installation start a gnome classic session and look for the synapse under accessories, configure from the tray icon to auto start and your set with a full replacement of 95% of unity dash functions. add a dock launcher like Cairo-dock or AWN and your set to go with 50% faster experience.\n\nA: The very bad performance of the Dash is a bug that appears to have a fix incoming (or already uploaded?). The bug report is at https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/1064834\nand your question sounds just like you experience this problem. Try to install nux 3.1 and see if it helps.\nLike others already pointed out, the irrelevant results from Amazon can be eliminated using\nsudo apt-get remove unity-lens-shopping\n\nand logging out + in again.\n\nA: Try to disable 'Record Activity' options in the 'Privacy' settings.\n", "Q: java MainServer gives java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: Unsupported major.minor version 51.0 Compiling is easy but when using java to run the programs, it gives Exception found.

I use Ubuntu 12.04. Recently, 12.10 was released. I'd like to upgrade but I want know what the benefits are in using Ubuntu 12.10 over Ubuntu 12.04 first.\nMy requirement is here Security , is there any security difference existed between Ubuntu 12.04 and Ubuntu 12.10 ? How best I can protect my PC ? \n\nA: You can see some benchmarks here comparing performance between 12.04 and 12.10. The majority of tests show no difference in terms of computational performance.\nAs with all benchmarks, there are many caveats:\n\n\n*\n\n*It only tests one hardware combination. Your results may vary.\n\n*It is based on a pre-release version of 12.10 (although it is unlikely much has changed).\n\n*\"Bare metal\" computational performance is not the same as user interface responsiveness. As observed above, anecdotal evidence claims that the performance of the Unity interface has regressed, but I cannot find any actual quantification of this.\n\n\nA: If your definition of working performance includes having a stable system, then a difference to keep in mind is that Ubuntu 12.04 is Long Term Service (LTS) release, whereas 12.10 is not.\nA LTS release is targeted at running stable, whereas the others could be more experimental. It is less likely for a LTS to introduce a change that could break your system. Furthermore, you can upgrade a LTS release to the next LTS release, but for each intermediate release you have to upgrade to the next version.\nFor further reference, see this question.\n\nA: it is slower (but trust me this problem will not be remain) on the other hand, there are several new features on it, especially in notification bar (top right of Unity desktop). Also there are several new features in Unity Interface. so I think it is better to use latest released Ubuntu because this OS is for smart and cutting edge people. ;D\nSlower, to be precise is when it comes to loading the desktop from the login screen onwards. The booting of the OS is still as fast as it always used to promise. But it takes a little longer than 12.04 to load the unity DE.\n", "Q: Cannot access Windows Shares on Win-7 from Ubuntu 10.04 after Copied files from another Win-7 Hi I know Samba problems is all over the places.

The Asus EEE-PC 1015bx is born with 1 GByte RAM only and it is not possible to add further or exchange the existing 1 GByte with a larger card.\nWhen looking at the system monitor, it looks like all swap is being utilized along with 70-75% of the RAM, even with very few applications running.\nCan the lack of much swap space be the reason for my computer running slowly and at times freezing?\nHow can I add a swap partition?\nOr should I add a swap file instead?\nAt the moment, I see two partitions when viewing the system monitor: one 28.6 GByte ext4 partition which must be the one containing Ubuntu and one 100 GByte fuseblk partition which I assume is the one holding Windows. It shows that I have 18.6 GByte free space on the ext4 partition.\nCan I \"take a bite\" from the ext4 partition and convert this into a swap partition? I was thinking something like 3 GBytes for swap considering my limited RAM.\nI hope that someone can guide me through.\nThank you.\n20th Oct 2012 - Further details\nThank you for below answer which I find very useful.\nI am certainly considering switching to one of your suggested shells as I can see from the Internet that many have posted that these require much fewer resources than ubuntu. It seems to me that lubuntu is the perfect match for my very limited computer. I will have to wait a few days, though, as I am presently limited by a very slow and restricted Internet connection via satellite.\nBut will lubuntu install as simply another shell replacing unity or will it replace ubuntu all together? Will the software that I have installed under ubuntu still be accessible in lubuntu? And can I return to ubuntu if required?\nRegarding the actual question of swap:\nWhen I run gparted, it shows me that there is one ntfs partition of 100 GBytes from where it boots and the before mentioned ext4 partition of 28.6 GBytes is not mentioned. Could it be that my ubuntu installation resides inside this 100 GBytes ntfs partiotion? And if so, can I take a bite of this for my swap partition?\n\nRealising that gparted is shown in Danish, I hope that you can make out what I mean.\nSystem monitoring shows below details:\n\nOnce again I sincerely hope that you can help.\nThank you.\n\nA: Before I answer your question, a word of advice: consider changing the default Ubuntu desktop (which is quite resource heavy) to something more lightweight. Lubuntu or Xubuntu both seem to be good alternatives. You can install them with\nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop\n\nand \nsudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop\n\nrespectively.\nYes, you can change the size of your partition and create a new one using a program called gparted.\nHowever, you should boot the computer from the LiveCD or USB installation (with the \"try Ubuntu\" option), because you cannot modify partitions which are in use.\nAfter you have used gparted (which is pretty intuitive, but google if you have any problems) and your swap has been successfully created (remember to tell gparted to format the partition as Linux swap!), you will have to boot modify the /etc/fstab file to tell it to use the new swap partition.\nYou can do it either from the LiveCD, or from the running system. The second one, in its least efficient, but simplest form is this: boot into your system, open the /etc/fstab file:\ngksudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\nPut a comment char (#) in front of the line (if there is one) which refers to swap. Add another line like that:\nUUID=2xx52d6-12b6-4457-bc4e-24ac7fe64176 none             swap    sw              0       0\n\nWhere to get this UUID thing? Type the following command\nsudo blkid\n\nIt will list all partitions and their respective UUID's. The one which is swap will have TYPE=\"swap\".\nAsk if you have any further questions.\n", "Q: My Ubuntu system doesn't shutdown.

It lost all my configurations for all accounts (see info on the bug below). Then when I went to set it up again it took me a while for all 6 or 7 of the calendars to get set up. It kept seeming to hand when identifying so I was only able to add 2 at a time (add 2, restart evolution, add another 2, etc). I'm still not certain that all my files are sync'd to disk as I like so contemplating a purge and starting over still. I should also mention I did not already have the associated google account set up in the online accounts setting.\nIn researching my issues I found a bug - https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/evolution/+bug/1049028 I know it's not explicitly related but could be. It says there's a fix released so hopefully this goes away shortly, if this is indeed the issue you're facing.\n\nA: My answer is not so different from Mar Warne's one. After a couple of reboots, my Personal Keyring started asking for google password, I could not say if because of Evolution, Web Accounts, or a Webapps related thing.\nIn any case, I tried with my google account password, but the dialog window continued to show up. Then I remembered I created a password for third party apps (2-step verication needed), and even if I disabled 2-step, some of my apps, such as Thunderbird or calendar clients still asks for the second password, don't know why.\nSo I tried this second one, and Evolution opened, showing my calendar multiple times (each time I created it, I suppose). \nJust deleted the copies and all started to work again.\n", "Q: Are console and gnome applications using different sudoers file ?

Last couple of weeks played around with Ubuntu 12.10. This is running as a guest on Virtualbox hosted at Windows 7. There have been some challenges with the Unity 3D stuff. Particular due to not supporting X11 release 1.13 till very recently. Since today we are able to download Virtualbox version 4.2.2 which has through guest additions also support for X11 release 1.13. SO far great work everybody.\nSince Unity now only runs in 3D mode it would be nice to access the graphics card directly from Virtualbox. lshw -c display shows: VGA compatible controller; product: VirtualBox Graphics Adapter.\nQUESTION: how to get the 3D and other graphics directly supported by the hardware ie Nvidia GeForce M310 \n\nA: As of 2016 it is fully implemented but for Linux guests experimental.\n\nThe PCI passthrough module is shipped as a VirtualBox extension\npackage, which must be installed separately. See Section 1.5,\n“Installing VirtualBox and extension packs” for more information.\nEssentially this feature allows to directly use physical PCI devices\non the host by the guest even if host doesn't have drivers for this\nparticular device. Both, regular PCI and some PCI Express cards, are\nsupported. AGP and certain PCI Express cards are not supported at the\nmoment if they rely on GART (Graphics Address Remapping Table) unit\nprogramming for texture management as it does rather nontrivial\noperations with pages remapping interfering with IOMMU. This\nlimitation may be lifted in future releases.\n\nSource: VirtualBox manual\n\nA: PCI passthrough\nPCI passthrough is experimentally supported in recent Virtual Box closed source (PUEL) versions. However there are several limitation, i.e. for a graphics card we can read from the Virtual Box User Manual:\n\nAGP and certain PCI Express cards are not supported at the moment if they rely on GART\n\nI cant tell if this is the case with the Nvidia M310, you will have to figure this out first before you try.\nTo get PCI passthrough working we also need a motherboard with an enabled IOMMU from BIOS settings (i.e. VT-d for Intel, AMD-Vi for AMD).\nThere are several additional prerequisites to be met (see Virtual Box Manual for details):\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Your motherboard has an IOMMU unit.  \n  \n*Your CPU supports the IOMMU.  \n  \n*The IOMMU is enabled in the BIOS.  \n  \n*The VM must run with VT-x/AMD-V and nested paging enabled.  \n  \n*Your Linux kernel was compiled with IOMMU support, DMA remapping, and the PCI stub driver.  \n  \n*Your Linux kernel recognizes and uses the IOMMU unit.\n  \n\nWe can then attach a PCI device with its bus:device.function properties read from lspci to our virtual machine using:\nVBoxManage modifyvm \"VM name\" --pciattach <host-bus>:<host-device>.<host-function>@<guest-bus>:<guest-device>.<guest-function>.\n\nSee in the guest with lspci if the device was attached properly before installing drivers for this device.\nPlease also refer to the Virtual Box Manual for further limitations.\n", "Q: Confusion regarding fglrx in ubuntu 12.10 I have an ubuntu 12.04 system with an amd radeon hd 4670 graphics card running beautifully.

I have installed Cinnamon and Muffin and I love them. Finally, I have a working expo! However, I would like to remove all window decorations: I resize and move the windows with alt-mouse, and close them with alt-f4; I have absolutely no need for a title bar. However, I can't seem to find a similar setting for Cinnamon.\nIs it possible to get rid of all window decorations in Cinnamon?\n\nA: Although it is true that you cannot disable window title bars, you can make them so small, that they are hardly visible. As I landed here via google, I post my solution though the thread is old as it might help others. You can edit\n/usr/share/themes/Mint-X/metacity-1\n\nand set all non-zero value properties in the metacity-theme-1.xml (of course you need sudo, to edit something there. A backup is useful.). Now select under Theme settings -> Other settings -> window borders another theme and reselect Mint-X. Now the height of the title bar is determined by the title itself. Chose under Font settings font size 0 for the window title front and the title bar is almost gone.\n\nA: You cannot remove the Window title bar i.e the window decorations from cinnamon. Cinnamon depends on clutter and uses it to draw the window and decorations. \nI believe, The cinnamon window manager cinnamonwm get assigned dynamically during runtime. \nThis is a line from /usr/share/cinnamon/js/ui/main.js\nlet cinnamonwm = global.window_manager; \n\nSo, I believe you cannot do this yet on Cinnamon. And I'm not going to get the bounty ;\n\nA: I know this is old but you can remove the titlebar with this GNOME tip for maximized windows but you can also adjust the normal window mode settings in the same file.\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2011/05/how-to-remove-maximized-windows.html\n\nA: If you can use extensions in Ubuntu with Cinnamon like you can in Mint, now you could use \"Cinnamon Maximus\".

I have Ubuntu 11.04 (natty).  \nI have read 'Screen goes blank when VLC is playing video'. My question is similar, but also I have this problem when viewing a video on youtube.\nI am not quite clear about the meaning of 'computer idle'.  Is it considered idle only when the keyboard or mouse is not being used?  Because, when watching a video stored on HDD using VLC, or when watching a youtube video in a browser, there is some disk activity.  And I was thinking that this means that the computer is not idle.\nIn system settings -> control center -> screensaver preferences, I have a check mark for 'Activate screensaver when computer is idle' set to 5 min.  And the screen goes blank while watching videos in VLC or in a browser.\nThe answer suggested in the question refered to above (Screen goes blank when VLC is playing a video) suggests to disable the screensaver.  I was hoping not to have to turn off the screensaver each time I want to watch a video.  \nI wanted to understand the meaning of 'computer idle' so I have asked this as a separate question rather than asking this in the above referred question.\n\nA: Yes, 'idle' generally means there is no user input through the keyboard or mouse (or touchscreen).\nThere is also API available for applications to tell the system to inhibit idle screen blanking, for when in presentation, watching a movie, etc… However, not all applications make use of this API.\n", "Q: 12.10 Unity GUI Not Displaying \nPossible Duplicate:\nDesktop does not show when I installed nvidia drivers! \n\nI had 12.04 installed and had no problems at all, having had it setup on my Compaq Presario CQ62 for about 2 weeks (I'm new to Ubuntu and I had a spare laptop to experiment with).

Do this to get it up and running:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the calendar list, right-click and select \"New calendar\".\n\n*Choose \"On the Network\" and click \"Next\".\n\n*Select \"CalDAV\".\n\n*Enter \"https://www.google.com/calendar/dav/yourname@gmail.com/events\" as \"Location\".\n\n*Specify options on the next page.\n\n*Use your full e-mail address as username when prompted.\n\n\nThere are some instructions here:\nhttp://support.google.com/calendar/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=99358\n\nA: I got this to work, and here's how I did it:\nI use Thunderbird/Lightning as my email/calendar client on my main computer (Thinkpad W541, Ubuntu Unity, 16.04) and my travel Chromebook (Acer C720, Ubuntu XFCE, 16.04), and I wanted to regularly sync the calendar data between both machines.  Suggestions online often mention Google Calendar, but I'd rather use open-source tools (that I control) to do the job.  I use SeaFile (a FOSS DropBox equivalent) to sync folders & files between my machines.\nStep 1:  On my new Chromebook, I copy over my entire Thunderbird directory:\nrsync -zarv user@thinkpad:~/.thunderbird/  ~/.thunderbird/\nThen, I install Thunderbird and open it: presto, all my accounts, old emails, and (most importantly) calendar events are accessible. Great!\nStep 2: It looks like all relevant Thunderbird data are stored in ~/.thunderbird/blah.default/, with calendar data in ~/.thunderbird/blah.default/calendar-data/.  On the Chromebook, I create a new calendar event, save it, and see that ~/.thunderbird/blah.default/calendar-data/local.sqlite has increased in size and has a newer \"last-modified\" timestamp.  I conclude that local.sqlite contains all relevant calendar data.\nStep 3: I close Thunderbird on both machines, then use SeaFile to sync the entire calander-data/ folder on both.  I see that the newer filesize and timestamp have successfully synced on the Thinkpad. I open Thunderbird on the new machine, and there in the calendar is my new event.  Success!\nDrawbacks: \nThe main drawback seems to be that if Thunderbird is open on both machines and either calendar is edited, syncing the calendar-data files sometimes causes the other machine's Thunderbird to crash.  They just weren't built to handle that sort of I/O.  But otherwise: it works great!\n", "Q: why upgrade to 12.10 is not shown When I execute sudo update-manager -d I see a button to upgrade to 12.10. \nBut when I execute sudo tsocks update-manager -d, I don't see an option to upgrade to 12.10. \nI can't execute sudo tsocks release-upgrade.

The developer announced that he won't go any further with the software and the online services ... That is sad and destroys my hope for easy appearance editing just by waiting ... has been such a nice tool for 12.04 ... r.i.p. \n\nA: You can go into Tweak Tool and changes borders and fonts and what not.  It's not at all difficult but it's lacking on the options.  Be careful with what you put on there...I put on cairo dock and it led to a gpu fault that took two hours to get rid of.  I'm a noob (in the highest degree-used to be a Windows disciple) and I had an easy time fiddling with the options.  Have fun!

I've enabled natural scrolling via Ubuntu Tweak's miscellaneous options, but that doesn't seem to take effect for horizontal scroll - neither in web browsers, nor in nautilus or other native applications.\nIs there a way to enforce this behavior on horizontal scrolling as well?\nI'm using Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: Instead of using a designated application to configure natural scrolling, a script can be made to reverse the scrolling directions - both on the vertical and the horizontal axis.\n\n\n*\n\n*First, obtain the xinput prop related to the scrolling distance (note the variables wrapped in angle brackets):\n$ xinput list\n⎡ Virtual core pointer id=2 [master pointer (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer id=4   [slave pointer (2)]\n⎜   ↳ SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad id=<TOUCHPAD_ID>   [slave pointer (2)]\n⎣ Virtual core keyboard id=3    [master keyboard (2)]\n    (...)\n\n\n*Fetch the appropriate values for that prop:\n$ xinput list-props <TOUCHPAD_ID> | grep \"Scrolling Distance\"\n    Synaptics Scrolling Distance (<DISTANCE_KEY>):  <V_DISTANCE>, <H_DISTANCE>\n    Synaptics Circular Scrolling Distance (301):    0.100000\n\n\n*Than, create the script file to apply the reversed directions, by negating the values for vertical / horizontal distance.

Thank you, Andy, for providing an elegant, system wide solution.\n\n\n*\n\n*Fixing natural scrolling in Ubuntu 12.04 by Andy C..\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n*\n\n*It seems that calling nautilus is breaking the script on 13.04. Omitting the two calls to nautilus solves it.\n\n*Natural scrolling (both vertically and horizontally) is working properly out-of-the-box in 14.x, so no need for scripting there, just toggle the \"Natural Scrolling\" in the Mouse & Touchpad options.\n\n\nA: There is also a \"nicer\" xorg.conf based way to make the inverted <V_DISTANCE> and <H_DISTANCE> settings (determined according to @Eliran's answer) permanent:\nCreate a directory /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/, and in it a file like 51-synaptics-tweaks.conf, containing:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"touchpad\"\n    Driver \"synaptics\"\n    MatchIsTouchpad \"on\"\n        Option \"VertTwoFingerScroll\" \"on\"\n        Option \"HorizTwoFingerScroll\" \"on\"\n        # In the following lines, use your own negative V_DISTANCE / H_DISTANCE values.\n        Option \"VertScrollDelta\" \"-113\"\n        Option \"HorizScrollDelta\" \"-113\"\nEndSection\n\nThis follows Ubuntu's recommendations in the /usr/share/xorg.conf.d/* example files and also Archlinux instructions. To see the effect, restart X of course :)\n\nA: As an alternative to using script files or Ubuntu Tweak, you can also try the app called \"Natural Scrolling\", made by Zedtux. It will come as an indicator.\nTo install it, the easiest way is using a terminal:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:zedtux/naturalscrolling\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install naturalscrolling\n\n\nA: In xfce4 (Xubuntu, Ubuntu Studio,...) you can add this on the console:\necho 'pointer = 1 2 3 4 5 7 6 8 9 10 11 12' >> .Xmodmap\nxmodmap .Xmodmap\n\n", "Q: Which Lenovo laptop is featured on the new Ubuntu homepage?

This takes you to a working download for Ubuntu 12.04.\nSuch web-search based techniques are often helpful for downloading Ubuntu files when you are having trouble finding the right file because it's old, or when there is a problem with the Ubuntu website, with your browser or proxy (e.g., due to caching problems), or just a network slowdown somewhere in between.\nJust make sure you're only downloading Ubuntu (and any other software) from sites you trust.\n\nA: You can always go to http://releases.ubuntu.com/, select the version of Ubuntu you want, and then download the appropriate Wubi.exe file at the bottom of the page. (You must scroll all the way down to get to it.)\nAlternatively you can download an ISO image for the version you want to install with Wubi, then unpack the ISO image (7-zip will do this) and run the Wubi.exe that (along with all the other files therein) was extracted from the ISO.\n\n\n*\n\n*Or you can write the ISO to a USB flash drive, or burn it to a CD or DVD, and run Wubi.exe from the written USB or burned disc.\n\n*Or, if you have software installed in Windows that lets you mount ISO images as virtual drives (like Virtual CloneDrive), you can mount the ISO and run Wubi.exe from the virtual drive.

Is Ubuntu using some kind of \"lite\" WLAN driver and I might run into problems with certain networks in the future, if I don't use the firmware? Would there be benefits in using the firmware? (maybe longer runtime because of lower consumption?)\n\nA: It's working out of the box because the system is using the generic driver, that is not exact driver for the device but near to it.

Now that various Ubuntu ISOs has been folded into the regular desktop ISO, how do I install the minimal version which featured in the erstwhile alternate and the minimal ISO?\nMinimal CD\nRegarding minimal CD, it can install minimal Ubuntu  but requires net connection to download even the basic that basic set of Ubuntu packages. And therein lies the problem: I don't have a LAN connection I can use and, even if text-based installers did support wireless connections (they don't, IME), my wireless hardware is a little too new and requires manually compiling and installing drivers.\nIf you do have net connection and want to install minimal Ubuntu, Minimal CD is the way to go.\n\nA: Sadly it's gone:\n\nThe alternate installer, required when users want to configure\n  cryptsetup, Logical Volume Manager (LVM) or software-based RAID arrays\n  during installation, may disappear from Ubuntu as early as version\n  12.10. The idea is mooted in a proposal put forward by Steve Langasek, Engineering Manager at Canonical's Ubuntu Foundation.\nAccording to Langasek, dropping the alternate installer image would\n  represent a step towards reducing the number of Ubuntu installation\n  images. The guided partitioner in ubiquity – the installer from the\n  desktop live images – now contains extensions to set up cryptsetup for\n  encrypting whole disks and to manage disks using logical volume\n  manager. Both functions should, according to Langasek, also be\n  available with manual partitioning soon. The changes are planned for\n  Ubuntu 12.10, which is currently under development and due to be\n  released in October.\nThe ability to set up software-based RAID arrays using mdadm will not,\n  however, be finished in time and ubiquity is unlikely to support this\n  before Ubuntu 13.04. Langasek nevertheless proposes dropping the\n  alternate installer in 12.10. Users who want to use RAID can continue\n  to use Ubuntu 12.04 or, alternatively, install 12.10 as normal, set up\n  a software-based RAID array manually and migrate their data to it. The\n  decision will only affect Ubuntu proper – Ubuntu variants such as\n  Kubuntu will continue to offer the option of creating images using the\n  alternate installer, which will continue to use a Debian\n  installer-based installation program.\n\nSource\n\nA: I think that for your minimal command line requirement, Ubuntu Core would suffice.\n\nUbuntu Core is a minimal rootfs for use in the creation of custom\n  images for specific needs. Ubuntu Core strives to create a suitable\n  minimal environment for use in Board Support Packages, constrained or\n  integrated environments, or as the basis for application demonstration\n  images. It is available for the i386, amd64, and arm architectures.\nUbuntu Core delivers a functional user-space environment, with full\n  support for installation of additional software from the Ubuntu\n  repositories, through the use of the apt-get command. —\n\nWiki\nDownload: From here\n\nA: Install minimal Ubuntu from Ubuntu Server 12.10 USB/DVD\nYou can achieve a 12.10 minimal (no GUI) install via the Ubuntu Server installer image downloadable from the Ubuntu Server page or the alternative downloads page.\nThe minimal install option has been made available via different modes as detailed on the following screen shots.\n\n*\n\n*Opt to install a minimal system\n\nPress F4, and you will be able to choose minimal system installation mode.\n\n*\n\n*Skip or choose manual package selection\n\nGoing further, you will eventually be asked if you want to install more packages on top of the minimal system. If you want a pure command-line system, skip the step without choosing anything. Or you can select the last \"Manual package selection\" option to preemptively select any packages you were planning to install to build your custom environment.\n\nUpon choosing manual package selection, you will be greeted by a standard interactive instance of Aptitude if you chose manual package selection. If you're unfamilar with operating Aptitude, refer to this guide to navigate and select packages. Do note that the selection of packages you will find are only those available on your installation media; an internet connection will be needed to install anything else at install time.\n\nServer Minimal vs Minimal CD\nWhile the minimal system installed using the Ubuntu Server image is undoubtedly a genuine minimal system as known and loved by minimalist lovers, there is a slight differences in the package package selection compared to the Minimal CD. In fact, Minimal CD pulls in 7 extra packages during installation, which I (@Oxwivi) personally deem them to be all but redundant. But for the information freaks (like myself) who will have nagging doubts if the details are not known,  the seven in question are: daemon, dictionaries-common, discover, discover-data, language-pack-gnome-en, language-pack-gnome-en-base, libdiscover2, mpt-status, wamerican and wbritish.\nUsing the Lubuntu Alternate Installer, as this answer originally suggested, also worked and resulted in the same package list as installing Ubuntu Server. To use the Lubuntu Alternate Installer, minimal system mode must be chosen the same way as Ubuntu Server by pressing F4.\n\nA: This answer is more for the admin user, wanting to create an install CD. If you are just a desktop user and want to install Ubuntu this is probably overkill.\nCheck out Debian Live (Yes for Ubuntu!). Afaik. Ubuntu provides the live-build package (or similiar) from the Debian project which can also create Ubuntu live CDs. You can include an installer and packages with this CD. The entire process of building the live system is quite easy.\nCreate a directory \"live\", then cd live, Create a directry auto and a file \"auto/config\" with exec permissions. The file should look like this:\n\nlb config noauto \\\n     --apt-source-archives false \\\n     --architectures i386 \\\n     --binary-images iso-hybrid \\\n     --debian-installer live \\\n     --debian-installer-distribution quantal \\\n     --debian-installer-gui true \\\n     --distribution quantal \\\n     --mode ubuntu \\\n     --system live \\\n     --win32-loader true \\\n     --package-lists ubuntu-cloud-desktop \\\n     \"${@}\"\n\nSee the manual here: http://live.debian.net/manual/html/live-manual.en.html\nThen run lb config and sudo lb build. Voila, there you get an image for CDs or USB sticks with a complete installer.\n\nA: Edit:\nAs stated here, this will not work because Ubiquity ignores some preseed components, like tasksel because \"(...) they do not fit with Ubiquity's mode of operation\".\n\nI'm assuming what you are asking is a way to install the Ubuntu Desktop without the \"desktop\".\nIf you are using a USB device to install Ubuntu you can try to change the file pressed/ubuntu.seed present in your USB disk, replacing\ntasksel tasksel/first   multiselect ubuntu-desktop\n\nwith\ntasksel tasksel/first   multiselect standard\n\nI haven't tested it, but it should create a basic Ubuntu installation without the \"desktop\".\nAlso, i've read somewhere that the only differences between Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Server are at the kernel used and the IO scheduler (if someone could prove or deny this would be nice). If this is true you can just use a Ubuntu Server CD and after the installation install the \"desktop\" kernel and alter the IO scheduler.\n\nA: There are two Alternative iso images to my understanding the network installers and the full image which you can get here Alternative Downloads you will need a bit torrent client to download the full iso which does not require a network connection \nwhen installing it will auto try to setup a network connection it will fail as you are not connected to the internet it will then go to  a screen where there will be a few options one saying to try again or to go the menu select to go to the menu and then select the next logical step in the setup i have tried this personally and it works to my best knowledge \n\nA: I think you are stuck with the Precise images for the alternate installer.  This is a shame, in my opinion, as it removes Ubuntu one step further from power users like yourself.\nNow, after installing Precise from the CD, you will be, well, running an older version.  My recommended course of action at this point would be to make a custom Quantal repo DVD and apt-get dist-upgrade from it.  Here is a nice tutorial about making repo DVDs.\nThis approach has several problems, namely that you still have to download a ton of data.  Second, I think Ubuntu frowns upon dist-upgrade as an update method; they have a special tool that does the update, so you'd have to download it and run it manually, assuming you could even make it use local repos...\nIn other words, Canonical has decided you're out of luck.  I hate it, too.\n\nA: I think that I understand your need.\nYou need that the installed ubuntu can be used for your compilation needs without having to use internet. Plus you need a minimal operating system installed.\nIf it's the case I recommend you the full DVD sets of Debian testing. http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/weekly-builds/\nWith those you'll be able to use your system being completely disconnected.\nThe DVDs contains all languages, binary and sources that debian officialy has. (so it contains the kernel sources, the compilations tools, etc).\nI don't know about a ubuntu or ubuntu like that can do that much offline. Before you had alternative ISO of ubuntu ....\nYou can try with alternative ISO of Xubuntu or Lubuntu but I can't assure you that they'll have the sources (so you'll have to download them before). http://mirror.anl.gov/pub/ubuntu-iso/CDs-Xubuntu/12.04/release/\nBest regards,\n\nA: This is probably not quite what you're looking for but worth mentioning:\nWhat about Lubuntu?\nThis gives some handy files and ideas.\n\nA: There is Minimal CD project:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD\nQuantal images:\nhttp://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/quantal/main/installer-i386/current/images/netboot/mini.iso\nhttp://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/quantal/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/mini.iso\nMinimal CD boots to minimal CLI system where you're supposed to use tasksel to install what your want.\n", "Q: Upgrading kubuntu to version 12.10 stops It's on the step \"Installing the upgrades\", says it's \"Configuring virtuoso-opensource-6.1\", and the last line in the log is \"Unpacking linux-headers-3.5.0-17 (from .../linux-headers-3.5.0-17_3.5.0-17.28_all.deb) ...\"\n..

There are two parts. \"Turn screen off when inactive for:\" x minutes, which determines when the screen turns off.

Do I need to check both options to have full encryption, or just the first option?\nWhat will happen in each case? \n\nA: Canonical implemented this feature (full disk encryption) in Ubuntu installer edition from 12.10 because Alternate CDs are dropped. From QQ Alternate CD are no longer available. \n\"Encrypting full disk\" stands for creating encrypted volumes (luks) and it uses full disk, not only /home folder. Encrypting full disk is more secure and with that option you can uncheck \"Encrypt my home folder\". There is no need to use two kinds of encryption.

If you want to do the same while seated on your desktop (and send windows on your laptop) then go on.\nOn your terminal you run\n\necho $DISPLAY\n\nThis will show you something like:\nlocalhost:10.0\n\n\nFrom your desktop:\nOpen a terminal and run\nDISPLAY=:10.0 firefox\nThis should send a firefox window on your laptop but running on your desktop. Make sure the number you put (e.g. 10.0) is the same as in the echo result\n\nA: Variant A - Shooting X Windows to another DISPLAY:\n\n\n*\n\n*See to it, that the Xserver on your Laptop starts up listening to tcp connections. Sadly X11-Networking is disabled by default in most distributions. Since the Xserver is started by your display manager (gdm, lightdm) this has to be configured there:\nWhatever display manager you use, some configuration file in /etc/ will probably contain the responsible XServer parameter. Run grep -r 'nolisten tcp' /etc/ on your Laptop to find out which config file is responsible and remove the part where it says -nolisten tcp (not the entire line, just this parameter). Restart X on your Laptop.\nYour Laptop should now have a display running on tcp port 6000 (try running nmap -p6000 Laptop on your Desktop PC, if the port reported as \"open\", you came this far).\n\n*Make your X-display available to the desktop computer. X11 uses an authentication mechanism to grant access to a display. You have to allow the desktop PC to shoot Windows onto the Laptop. Normally by exchanging a display cookie.\nFor starters perform this step with hands on your notebook. Once you have gotten the concept with the DISPLAY variable and everything, you can do this via ssh.\nQuick and dirty: You can run xhost +desktops.computers.ip.address on your laptop to grant X access to the desktop computer. Note that every user on your laptops computer can use your laptops X display this way. Note that this is sufficient i.e. for installing a keylogger on your laptops display. Use this method only for testing.\nCorrect and secure: run xauth extract cookie-file :0 on your laptop to export your display access secret to \"cookie-file\". Transfer the cookie to your Desktop machine. Run xauth merge cookie-file. Or in one short step (from your desktop) ssh Laptop xauth extract - :0 |xauth merge - Note: if your laptop and desktop are sharing a home directory i.e. via nfs you don't need to exchange any credentials. The credential database is the .Xauthority file in your home dir, and can be shared among different machines.\n\n*Run the program: In a terminal on your desktop PC run export DISPLAY=Your.Laptops.IP.Address:0, run any X program in the same terminal. It should appear on the notebooks display.\nVariant B - Using SSH with a twist.\nSSH accomplishes X11 forwarding by forwardin a local X11 socket (normally a Unix Domain Socket) to a local TCP socket on the remote machine, then negotiating the display cookie, then setting the DISPLAY-Environment on the remote machine. This way all X11 traffic is encrypted over the ssh tunnel. The normal use case is to forward the local display to the remote machine (meaning allow remote applications to display x windows locally).\nThe advantage of using ssh is, that you don't need to put your X-Server into tcp listen mode (since the unix socket is used). And ssh handles the credential exchange.\n\n\n*\n\n*SSH to your laptop from your desktop computer (you don't need to use -X yet).\n\n*In the remote shell enter export DISPLAY=:0 this makes the already running display on your notebook available to the shell you got via ssh. If you run any X command now, it will already appear on your notebook screen, but still run on your laptop (try it out to be safe).\n\n*From this shell ssh back to your desktop computer, use -X this time. You now have a shell on the machine on which the ssh session originated but this time with working X. Run xeyes or xcalc to test it.\n\n*echo $DISPLAY shows you the designation, your laptops X display has now on your desktop computer. I.e. :10 or :11.\n\n*You can minimize the terminal now. Anytime you enter export DISPLAY=:10 (see what display number you got) on your desktop computer now, each program you run afterwards in the same shell will appear on you notebooks screen.\nThis Variant is easy but slow, since all X11 traffic is forwarded via SSH.\nVariant C - The original thinclient concept:\nYou can use your laptop to Open a desktop session running entirely on your desktop computer.\n\n\n*\n\n*Configure the display manager on your Desktop to answer to XDMCP Broadcasts. How to do this depends on your display manager. Some display managers don't support this at all, i.e. slim. XDM, KDM, WDM, GDM do support it.\n\n*Start a X-Server on your Laptop, which requests the display manager from your desktop. Either a nested X: Xephyr :1 -query desktop or Xephyr :1 -broadcast\nOr by shutting down your Notebooks X-Server and enter on a System Terminal sudo Xorg :0 -broadcast\nThe display manager will see to it, that credentials are generated and exchanged and everything. Congrats, you should now see a login window provided by your desktop computer.\n\nA: You are looking at using a combination of SSH and screen then to get the situation you want.\nOn your desktop, install screen:\nsudo apt-get install screen\nFrom there, start up a new screen session:\nscreen\nand open firefox in it:\nfirefox\nUse firefox all you want on your desktop, then ssh into your computer from your laptop:\nssh -X username@hostname\nType the following command to see which screen sessions you have running:\nscreen -ls\nLog in to your screen session (1234 would be the number screen -ls gave you)\nscreen -x 1234\nThen you can use firefox on your laptop and close the terminal on your desktop.\n\nA: Virtualgl will create an extra(background) desktop (TightVNC Style) that you can access via a turbo VNC client. It will function as a remote desktop type deal -> But it will play smooth video over a network.\nIf you looking for a way to offload CPU overhead for a remote connection, so you can run apps from your computer on your laptop, then that would be what I would do.\nhttp://www.virtualgl.org/\n\nYou can also export the desktop environment through SSH as /dude above mentioned. \n\nA: You can use ssh X forwarding to achieve your goal.

I've managed to go through hell with the UEFI setup, and finally now have a working GRUB.  \nHowever, I can't manage to get past the \"Loading initial ramdisk\".\nIf I boot the live CD-USB (only in BIOS legacy mode), I get a wonderful, working Ubuntu.\nI finally managed to get UEFI installed on the hard-drive (no option for legacy BIOS boot, or I'd be there in a flash!), and can boot in UEFI mode into GRUB2. \nBut... I can't manage to get past the \"loading initial ramdisk\".  It appears that the disk drivers are failing (there is no disk activity after this point). \nIdeas?    pastebin from the boot-repair is at: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1290011/\nbest,\n-tony\nNew (22.10.2012):  Well, one of the problems seems to be that when I boot in UEFI mode, the hard disk is NOT recognized by the boot loader.  It's a standard GPT formatted disk, but the boot loader (grub command line, or shell.efi's) can't seem to find it.  Thoughts for what to load in order to get it recognized?  I've tried loading part_gpt and similar other obvious candidates ingrub, but does any one have an incantantion I can study for \"installing\" a disk which is not seen?\nSo here's what really bugs me -- if I boot in legacy compatibility mode from the USB sticks, I get ALL of the file systems (hd0, hd1), but if I boot in UEFI mode, I just get the USB stick.   Does this have anything to do with a secure UEFI safe mode, or something?   Or something else?\n\nA: I keep seeing reports that GRUB 2's EFI support has improved recently, but every time I've tried it, it's been awful. I have yet to try Ubuntu 12.10, so I don't know if the version of GRUB 2 it includes is any better. If not, my suspicion is that you're running into a GRUB 2 problem; but it's also possible that my bad experiences with GRUB 2 are poisoning my interpretation of your problem.\nIn any event, if I'm right, my suggestion is to install another boot loader and try using it. Your Boot Info Script output suggests you've already got an ELILO configuration set up, so you could just try copying your Ubuntu kernel and initrd file and editing elilo.conf (probably in EFI/debian on your ESP, /dev/sda1) to boot Ubuntu. If your ELILO isn't working, though, you might try rEFInd, which is capable of directly booting a Linux 3.3.0 or later kernel, which Ubuntu 12.10 provides. (This assumes, however, that Ubuntu has included the EFI stub loader support in their kernel. I don't know if they've done so.) The rEFInd documentation includes a section on booting Linux. In brief, you would:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install rEFInd according to its documentation.\n\n*Create a refind_linux.conf file that includes your kernel options. (According to your Boot Info Script output, root=UUID=1de654ef-3c5e-4d17-8fc8-8490926d8d76 ro   quiet splash i915.modeset=0 xforcevesa should work. See the rEFInd documentation for details of the refind_linux.conf file format.) Place this file where your kernels reside on the ESP (copied in the next step).\n\n*Copy your kernel (vmlinuz-*) and initrd (initrd*) files from your Ubuntu /boot directory to the EFI/ubuntu directory on your ESP (your /dev/sda1), renaming the kernel file so that its name ends in .efi.\n\n\nWhen you reboot into rEFInd, you should then see a new option in its menu for launching Ubuntu. If this process works, you can take some steps to ensure that rEFInd picks up your future kernel updates automatically. (The easiest is to reconfigure your system to mount the ESP as /boot and change refind.conf to uncomment the scan_all_linux_kernels option.)\nAnother observation: Your /dev/sda4 is incorrectly flagged in your partition table as an ESP. This is unlikely to be causing your current problem, but it could cause difficulties in the future. I recommend you fix it. You can do this in GNU Parted or GParted by removing the boot flag from the partition or in gdisk by changing the type code from EF00 to 8300. The latter is preferable on a dual-boot system, since your libparted will probably give the partition an improper type code for Windows rather than for Linux. (This bug will be fixed in the next version of libparted, which is due out this month.)\n", "Q: Upgrade 12.04 to 12.10 using startup disk I'm trying to upgrade 12.04 to 12.10 using a startup disk, but when I am supposed to choose the type of installation I want, Upgrade option is not available.

Then have the HDD be /home.

Is there any way of achieving a wubi or similar install on the PC in question without connecting it to the internet? (I have other computers with internet connections fr downloading files, etc)\nThanks for taking your time to read this.\n\nA: I believe the WUBI installer only works when you are connected to the internet.  Once you start it the installer will automatically download the operating system.  I just did it two nights ago and it was a surprisingly painless process.

Is it equivalent to the Hwaddr / MAC address or is it a unique identifier that is derived from the Hwaddr addresses? \nI am trying to activate the Maple mathematical software but it gives me an error stating that the software was unable to determine the hostid. I have followed all the instructions listed in the following help page from Maplesoft but with no luck so far.\nhttp://www.maplesoft.com/support/faqs/detail.aspx?sid=32610\nWhen I enter hostid into Teminal it outputs “007f0101” which is probably incorrect. I read that a hostid  is supposed to produce a unique identifier for each unix like machine but I have tried hostid on two different Ubuntu 12.04 installations and they both return the same “007f0101” sequence. Something is amiss I would reckon unless I have misunderstood what a hostid is.\nOh, this Ubuntu installation was done with the WUBI installer so it is technically on a virtual disc which resides in the Windows partition from what I gather. I have a feeling that may be a problem but that doesn' change the fact that the hostid was the same on two different computers, one of which was a standard installation. \nDoes anyone have any idea what the issue might be with regards to the hostid?\nThanks!\n\nA: hostid is your IP address in hex, byteswapped.\nFor example:  \n01234567 -> 23.01.67.45\n\nOr in your case:\n007f0101 -> 7f.00.01.01  = 127.0.1.1\n\nWhich is found in /etc/hosts. That's normal if your machine was installed using a DHCP assigned address.\nA quick hack is to vi /etc/hosts and put in your IP address instead of 127.0.1.1.  But that is a hack... if your IP address changes at the next boot, your hostid will no longer match your IP.\nThe bottom line is that hostid sucks.\nUpdate:\nI wrote my own hostid script in perl/shell and put it in path first:\n#!/usr/bin/perl -w\nprintf(\"%02x%02x%02x%02x\\n\",(split /\\./,`ip addr list|grep \" inet \"|grep -v \" 127.0\"|head -1|cut -f1 -d/|rev|cut -f1 -d\" \"|rev`)[1,0,3,2]);\n\nNotably, it doesn't fall back to using loopback if there are no other interfaces.\n\nA: I have three physical machines all three 12.04 (2 desktop, 1 server), all three AMD64, all three with the same hostid \"007f0101\".\nIt seems in the glibc implementation of gethostid (see man gethostid), the hostid is stored in the file /etc/hostid, which is by default absent in 12.04. If this file is non-existent, it then uses the localhost ipv4 address to generate the hostid. If you use DHCP, in the hosts file, localhost is mapped to 127.0.0.1 on all machines, resulting in non-unique hostid's.\nYou could create the /etc/hostid file with random content to get a unique hostid.\n", "Q: Radeon HD 2000, 3000, 4000 on Ubuntu 12.04.2 and higher: fglrx (legacy) unsupported, what to do? After upgrading to 12.10 quantal, the packaged version of fglrx no longer works. I discovered that this is because there is a separate 'legacy' fglrx driver for the HD 2k-4k series cards, but it is incompatible with the xorg server on 12.10.\nThis is the most current version of the driver for HD 2000 through HD 4000 series cards.

Bless you silence of the coolers.\nHowever, it would be great if AMD released legacy drivers supporting newer X server(s), though now I'm not sure they really care.\n\nA: There's the ppa:makson96/fglrx PPA that has the legacy driver. It will also downgrade your Kernel and X server to older versions, as the legacy driver is not compatible with newer Kernels nor X servers. However, please read the release notes from the link as the driver isn't fully compatible with the Unity used in Ubuntu 13.04.\nIf you want to use the PPA, run these commands from the terminal to downgrade the Kernel and X server and to install the legacy driver:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:makson96/fglrx\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install fglrx-legacy\n\n\nA: I have an ATI Radeon HD 4770 and the open source drivers are working quite nicely.

Also, 3D gaming is noticeably slower without fglrx. However, for most of your desktop use, the open source drivers are much easier to use than fglrx, with the added bonus of being actually supported.\n(Incidentally, the Gnome Shell packaged in 12.10 works very nicely with the open source drivers, and is much faster than Compiz/Unity!)\n\nA: Repo for putting last good proprietary driver : http://www.ubuntuvibes.com/2012/10/how-to-install-amd-catalyst-legacy.html\n\nA: A workaround for this problem is posted at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2073279\n\nA: I have an old Radeon Mobility HD 2600 on 13.04.

I deleted all of those and created a blue-grey version of Radiance based on the new Radiance theme.

Alsamixer display wrong outputs and inputs (more than notebook really have). In clean installations internal speakers were playing, but they didn't mute when headphones was plugged in.\nThere was a solution (propably not the best but working) - edit as root /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf and add a line \"options snd-hda-intel model=z71v position_fix=1\". After restart it worked correctly (alsamixer displayed correct devices and internal speakers were muted after I plugged in headphones).

Or you can be cool and use the command line:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install libcairo2=1.10.2-6.1ubuntu2 --reinstall\n\n*sudo apt-get install libcairo-gobject2=1.10.2-6.1ubuntu2 --reinstall\nIn best case there will be no troubles on the way of \"downgrading those two packages\". I had the same problem and there was no problem. \nThe reason for the occurence of the problem in the first place is that\non your system the newer version have been installed. You have installed\nlibcairo2 (1.10.2-6.1ubuntu 3 ) and libcairo-gobject2 (1.10.2-6.1ubuntu 3 )\nThis can happend if one selects the \"optional updates\" (see picture) \n\nin the source-packages-repositories-configureation. This will cause those new versions to be installed. This normaly is no problem at all. and no error message will occur. \nBut then if you later on deslect/unselect the \"optional updates\". Then the those packages (the new version) will still be kept installed, while the new installs (like your libcairo2-dev) will be requesting version that are older (because the repos/package-sources do not have those \"optional updates\" included anymore). Then there is the unmet dependency. \nSo theoreitcally it might also help to make sure that you have the \"optional updates packages\" selected.\nIf this answer helped/solved, consider accepting it as the answer.\n", "Q: No Soundcards found.

Here are step-by-steps instructions for a noob like me.\n\n\n*\n\n*First step after going to grub recovery is to find out the partition on the disk.\n\n\na) type \"ls\" on the grub-recovery prompt. this would give you all the partitions on your disk.\ngrub-recovery> ls \nmy output was\n(hd0), (hd0,msdos1), (hd0,msdos2), (hd0,msdos3).... and so on\n2) now we have to find out which of these partitions contain Ubuntu files to do this type\nls  e.g. ls (hd0,msdos5) \nin case you see and error it means that this is not the partition that we are looking for. Keep trying this with other partitions till you see something like below\ne.g. lost+found dev bin usr etc-2\nfor me it turned out to be (hd0,msdos5)\n3) now we need to find the location for the file with name starting with vmlinuz.... and initrd...\nthey would be generally under the folder /boot\nls /boot/ \nnote down the full names and the path of the files, we might need them later. For me they we under /boot/ folder and were named vmlinuz-3.2.0-32-generic and initrd-3.2.0-32-generic \n4) now make a Live CD or pen-drive for linux, plug it in and start your PC. When you see grub menu (menu where user is asked to either install Ubuntu or try it without installing) press character C and hit enter.\nthis would take you to the grub prompt.\nHow to install Ubuntu via pen-drive\nwe are not going to make a fresh install of Ubuntu, we just want to use the grub command prompt. \n5) type the below mentioned commands on grub prompt\nset root=(hd0,x) \nif your partition was sda5 type 5 in place of x e.g. set root=(hd0,5)\n6) linux /vmlinuz root=/dev/sdXY ro \nin case you see an error you'll have to use the full path that we notoed in step 3.\ne.g. linux /boot/vmlinuz-3.2.0-32-generic root=/dev/sda5 ro \n7) initrd /initrd.img \nif you see an error specify the full path as in step E\ne.g. initrd /boot/initrd.img-3.2.0-32-generic \n8) boot \nusing the above methods I was able to boot into Ubuntu and was able to access all my data.\n9) as final step we need to fix the grub so that we don't have to follow these steps every time we want to login.\nLink to install Boot-Repair\n\nA: Do you have 2 separate physical disks for W7 and Ubuntu?

(causing a service interruption)\nThe -u option doesn't seem to work, it just updates back to the same values.\n\nA: You are right, \"resolvconf -u\" does not suffice to activate the change you made. That command only updates resolv.conf from resolvconf's database whereas you need to update the database.\nAssume the interface in question is eth0.  Assume that in /etc/network/interfaces you have a stanza that looks like this.\niface eth0 inet static\n    [...]\n    dns-nameservers 1.1.1.1 2.2.2.2\n\nNow you change the \"dns-nameservers\" line.  To activate this change do (note the && avoid breaking a potentially open ssh connection)\nifdown eth0 && ifup eth0\n\nor reboot.\n\nA: Just went through this same issue; even a reboot would be lose the change on manually invoking the libc hook.\nSo the most stable way I've found is, after putting the desired content into /etc/network/interfaces,  to edit /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/original to include the lines wanted, make sure tail (in that directory) is not present, cd /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d and then invoke /etc/resolvconf/update.d/libc.\nNote that if tail is present (by default, pointed to original then the contents derived from /etc/network/interfaces will be followed by the original setup too.\nThat these changes can most safely be applied by a reboot is, frankly, insane. The current system takes what used to be \"edit this file, perhaps deploying from a configuration management system\" and hides it behind multiple layers of abstraction and no clean way to invoke for maintenance outside the normal boot framework.\n\nA: I bumped into this twice recently.\nThe first time, I did sudo ifdown eth0 which of course killed my ssh connection and left the machine ignoring its NIC. Ouch. I had to go in through the IPMI interface on the server to get control again.\nThe second time, I learned from my earlier mistakes and did sudo ifdown eth0 ; sudo ifup eth0. The ssh window died, of course, but the machine quickly responded to a new ssh connection and my DNS modifications were in effect. I did the same thing on a second server but this time I waited before typing anything into the ssh window. The window stayed up and the DNS changes had been applied. Awesome.\nThe critical thing was to use the shell's semicolon operator so that both commands would be on one line. This way, the command to restore the interface has already been entered by the time the interface goes down. I suppose I could have written a script and executed that, but this seemed easier.\nUPDATE: There is another way to do this. You can also restart the Ubuntu networking service in one step: sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart or sudo service network-interface restart INTERFACE=eth0.

My apologies if this is covered in another post and I was just unable to find it.  I've found a few 'similar' posts, but nothing as bad as my issue.\nWith the history aside, here is the actual detailed issue:\nI purchased a new SSD (Intel 520 SSD), arrived today, and I disconnect my old Windows 7 SSD.  I had pre downloaded the ubuntu-12.10-desktop-amd64 earlier today and burned it to DVD.\nUpon inserting the Live CD into the computer and booting up, everything was fine up to the 'Run From Live CD' or 'Install Ubuntu Now' buttons.  As I was sure I wanted to go ahead and make the switch, I selected the 'Install Now' from the right hand side.\nCD Spins up, black window pops up, and then the errors started:\ndate/time   GPU Lockup\ndate/time   Failed to idle channel 1\ndate/time   PFIFO - playlist update failed\ndate/time   Failed to idle channel 2\ndate/time   PFIFO - playlist update failed\nThinking it might correct itself, I let it run and it would swap over to a GUI Screen that was locked up with major blurring/etc, then back to the command line with the errors.  Eventually it said something along the lines of 'unknown status' and switched back to the GUI and froze.\nSo, that's when I tried to see if I could find a BIOS upgrade for the nVidia GTX580 cards, and had no luck.   So I thought, why not try to just run it from the Live CD and see if I can at least get a look at it, maybe if I could get it running try to do some sort of install from there and fix the driver issue.\nI rebooted, brought up the Live CD, and this time chose the left option / run from the CD.  It brought me all the way in to the desktop, I saw my drives, the other icons, could move the mouse, etc for about 30 seconds and then it locked up completely.  I've tried this a couple of times and get the same results every time.\nHardware:\nIntel i7-3930K CPU @ 3.2GHz (12 CPUs) /\n  MSI MS-7760 Motherboard /\n  32GB RAM /\n  2 x EVGA (nVidia) GeForce GTX 580 (4GB Ram each)\nSo the question is:\nIs there any way to install 12.10 if you can't even get the Live CD to run (for more than 30 seconds)? \nMy current hardware configuration is both of the GTX 580 cards have an SLI jumper on them, and I have 2 monitors on each card.  (Ubuntu info obviously only shows on the main monitor from the failed installation and the attempt at running the Live CD).\nPerhaps opening the machine back up and removing the SLI Jumper and removing the other 3 monitors (so it only would have 1 video card with one monitor on it) would actually allow me to get 12.10 installed, then I could work on an nVidia Video Driver fix for the GTX 580, and then possibly hook up the other video card and monitors?  Or is this something that they are currently aware of and may update with a future release in the next few days/weeks?\nAny thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated, as I can't even try to fix the issue (assuming it is the nVidia drivers) if I can't even get it to install at all.\n\nA: I managed to get my desktop running with a Nvidia Geforce GTX 580. I installed Ubuntu 12.04 via the alternative installer, which can be found here. \nBefore finishing the installation, i installed the nvidia graphics drivers. To do this, open a shell with ALT+F2, then run the command \"chroot /target\" and then run \"apt-get install nvidia-current\". Press CTRL+D and then ALT+F1 to exit the shell. Then finish the installation.\nAfter installing, it was necessary to add the option 'nomodeset' in grub.\nCredit for the alternative installer trick goes to joelalmeidaptg.\nEDIT: Ubuntu 13.04 does not suffer as hard. Nomodeset is needed for installing, but afterwards it is able to boot, albeit with poor resolution. It is then possible to install the nvidia-current package and it works great afterwards. I have submitted a bug report to this issue.\n\nA: Perhaps create a live USB disk, boot it on a machine with a different card, install the proprietary Nvidia drivers, then see if it'll run on your 580?\n\nA: I had same problem.  Boot in NOMODESET mode to get installer up.  To get nomodeset, wait for the first dark grey boot screen with the keyboard=little man icon and press any key to get the basic menu.  Then press F6, use the arrow keys to go down, select nomodeset, press Space (so there is an X by it) and then press ESC.\nNow you can do your install with no errors.\nI had the same issues with GTX580 in the previous version as well.  Seems like a basic thing Canonical could do, to have properly working graphics drivers for major chipsets.  Durh.\nWill post again about fixing the driver once installer is done.

Drivers for nvidia-cards are case-sensitive and it depends on your hardware. If this answer helps not, it is not my fault.\n\nA: Got this working with just about the same configuration. I had to install ubuntu on another machine and install the nvidia drivers while it was in the other machine.

You could embed it in your script, or you could rsync or wget it in from a server, or whatever.\nSo basically your script might do something like this:\napt-get install unattended-upgrades\nwget -O /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades http://myserver.mytld/confs/20auto-upgrades\n/etc/init.d/unattended-upgrades restart\n\nThere's really no reason to monkey with the dpkg-reconfigure script at all.\nIf you don't want to fetch the conf file from a remote server, it's VERY very short and simple - the default version, which fetches and installs security updates only, looks like this:\nAPT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists \"1\";\nAPT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade \"1\";\n\nSo you can just echo those lines into the config file directly with the following:\necho -e \"APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists \\\"1\\\";\\nAPT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade \\\"1\\\";\\n\" > /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades\n\n\nA: I would suggest to insert configuration parameters to configure unattended-upgrades. \nsudo touch /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades\n\necho \"APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists \"1\"\" >> /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades\n\necho \"APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade \"1\" \" >> /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades\n\nSame way you can configure/add parameters according to your requirement in conf file  /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades. \nDon't forget to restart service to apply changes. \n/etc/init.d/unattended-upgrades restart\n\n\nA: You have to use sudo to echo into /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades\nif [[ ! -f /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades.bak ]]; then\n    sudo cp /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades.bak\n    sudo rm /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades\n    echo \"APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists \\\"1\\\";\n    APT::Periodic::Download-Upgradeable-Packages \\\"1\\\";\n    APT::Periodic::AutocleanInterval \\\"30\\\";\n    APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade \\\"1\\\";\" | sudo tee --append /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades\nfi\n\n\nA: dpkg-reconfigure -f noninteractive unattended-upgrades\n\n", "Q: Can't install Ubuntu on my Windows 7 laptop I tried installing Ubuntu in two different ways:\nFirst, I tried the Windows Installer, and it goes well until I reboot the system and, when booting on Ubuntu, I get the error: \n\nNo root file system defined.\n\nSecond, I uninstalled wubi by going to to Control Panel -> Uninstall Programs -> Ubuntu. Then, I booted the laptop from the live CD and selected install. It boots okay but in the screen right after the one that says to make sure you have 4.5 GB available, Internet connection, etc, when I click continue it throws me a message saying that Ubuntu had an internal error and asks me if I want to report the error. After that, I just have a black screen and nothing else! No Ubuntu installed, no boot option to go back to Windows. Nothing!\nMy goal is to install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7 (without the hassle of formatting the computer, creating partition, etc). How can I do it (preferable using Windows Installer)? How can I solve the \"No root file system defined\" that I encountered when I used the Windows Installer?\n\nA: I once tried to instal through wubi but for me its easier partitioning. Esentially, when installing ubuntu you want to have three partitions. One for ubuntu \"/\" one for \"efi boot\" and one for \"swap\". Swap only needs to be as much as your RAM (typically). For the boot partition only 50mb and ubuntu partition depends how big you want it to be...i hope I helped at least a bit in explaining partitionong even though you need advice on wubi.\n", "Q: Grub bootloader failed to boot in dual boot system after installing Ubuntu 12.10 I had 12.04 with my dual boot system.

Any ideas?\n\nA: I don't know what that exactly happens, but that /scripts/init-premount/devpts is probably inside the initramfs. To locate the real file, you can do locate init-premount/devpts. Posting the problematic line will help resolve the problem.\nNote: I don't have that file here on my machine (12.04), but I do have the folders /etc/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-premount and /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-premount, but I will soon upgrade and look again.\nSorry, I can't comment, so I do it now via an answer.\nUpdate: you can also try sudo update-initramfs.

The upgrade went fine until the moment, while still installing packages, all the unity taskbars and window frames went away. I could do nothing more but observe the installation progress (the only app I had running was Chrome but it hanged, and because of lack of taskbars I couldn't restart it). But installation finished successfully and it asked for reboot. After rebooting, it booted into some low-res mode, displayed a message box that it can't detect my video drivers correctly and apparently I couldn't do anything - there were no reaction to mouse nor keyboard. Oh. \nHowever, I noticed in the logs that while booting, it started that bumblebee optimus thing. I had optimus disabled, so I went to bios and enabled it. I also managed to get into text console (framebuffer) and changed grub settings to boot straight into text mode. Now I tried starting X server manually (startx) and it showed me the high-res desktop, started two apps that I had in autostart, mouse and keyboard were fine. But no taskbars and no window frames. The screen resolution was fine (1920x1080) and looked like nvidia drivers booted properly.\nThe next thing I tried was uninstalling nvidia-current-updates, uninstalling bumblebee-nvidia, and setting xorg.conf driver to vesa and then nouveau. In both cases, I got low-res desktop with no damn taskbars nor frames. So then I installed only nvidia-current-updates (installation went fine) - I got back nvidia drivers working (logs and splash screen confirmed it), high-res desktop, but of course still with no unity taskbars.\nThe last thing I tried was removing .compiz and .config/compiz directories from my home folder, as I read such advice on the Internet. Didn't work. Also creating a fresh user account and starting x from there - showed only empty desktop, no taskbars.\nNow I'm stuck. Seems the damn thing doesn't work at all.

This stage is usually not necessary.\nThis method works for me, but I have to do it every time after I restart the computer.\nI think the only problem is that the mount on start-up does not set NTFS permissions to grant access from the network, and the command I use does (I don't understand the command, I copy pasted it from a forum post and edited it to my needs, and I'm guessing 'fmask=0111' or 'dmask=0000' gives the permissions)\nI'm thinking of adding a shell script with this command to /etc/init.d but I fear that might not be a very 'neat' way to do it. Also, I will need to find a way to deactivate whatever mounts the drive currently on-startup.\nAny help or better ideas?\n\nA: You can enter the drive into /etc/fstab. This is the place, where all volumes to be mounted permanently go (i.e. your system disk as well).\nJust add the line:\n/dev/sdc   /media/Expansion  ntfs  rw,auto,fmask=0111,dmask=0000  0  0\nor: UUID=\"12345566789ABCD\"   /media/Expansion  ntfs  rw,auto,fmask=0111,dmask=0000  0  0\nwhere \"12345566789ABCD\" is the UUID of your disk. You can get this information with sudo blkid\nYou recognize some parameters from your mount command here.\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sdc1 - is the device file, a unabstracted representation of the partition as it appears to the file system driver (the \"block device\")\n\n*/media/Expansion - is the Directory in which the drives content will be made available (the \"mount point\")\n\n*ntfs - guess what, it's the filesystem driver to use.\n\n*rw,auto,... - this is a list of mount options\n\n*\n\n*rw - mounts the volume for read/write access\n\n*auto - mount the volume automatically if needed\n\n*fmask=0111 - well this is more complicated, without explaining it in detail: it helps the system define file permissions on the volume, since ntfs does not normally store Linux- (Posix-)permissions\n\n*dmask=... - same here for directories\n\n*user - allows a mere user to mount and unmount the volume without using sudo, since you specified auto (which keeps the volume mounted anyway) this should not be required\n\n\n*0  0 - Those parameters have to do with system maintanance jobs like error checking the volume on startup, see man 5 fstab if you want to learn more\n\n\nPLease note, that this is completely independet of the \"share volume\"/\"guest access\" stuff, but since you said, you don't need to normally do that anyway, I thought you might want to care about mounting the volume first.\n", "Q: How do I install the original gnome-control-center?

My bluetooth dongle does not get detected after the upgrade, which was working fine before.\nI tried another dongle of another brand and that works. But I want to use the old one as that is good quality one that comes with Logitech DiNovo keyboard.\n\nA: I have the DiNovo Cordless Desktop too, the old version (LZ845AG).\nThe problem reside in the dual mode functionality of the USB dongle. It is a full btusb dongle, but it has a second operating mode: it works as a (non-bluetooth) HID device. \nThis is neccessary if, for example, you want to enter BIOS with the keyboard. There is no bluetooth stack available at BIOS stage, so the dongle works in HID mode. Otherwise you could not use the keyboard in BIOS / DOS / any non-bluetooth environment, so the dual mode does make sense.\nHowever, full functionality is somewhat broken (again) in 12.10., depending on your setup. I have tested 3 choices so far: \n1.) You are working on a non-dualboot machine: No problem. Just bind the keyboard / mediapad / mouse once. Re-insert the stick if it does not work. Re-insert the stick while pressing the red button on the stick if it still does not work (this will force bluetooth mode manually). When the bluetooth icon finally appears on screen (top bar, left to the time clock): Press the red buttons one the devices, then use the bluetooth icon to add the devices, one by one.\n2.) You are using a different usb dongle with the hardware: Works too, see above, but you need additional software on dual boot machines, e.g. for Windows. May be tricky there, but works for Ubuntu just fine.\n3.) You have a dual boot machine and want to use the original usb dongle as well as the standard Logitech Windows software: At least with my DiNovo (old version) the problem is now that you are forced to re-bind all of the devices everytime you switch operating systems. There are rumours the newer DiNovo does not have this problem, but I did not find a way around it with my old DiNovo so far. Very sad, as the DiNovo is not the cheapest keyboard / mouse combo around at USD $180.\nSo everytime you switch, enjoy the hen and egg problem: Try to add keybard and mouse in Ubuntu without having keyboard nor mouse. Good luck. ;)\nOn older Ubuntu versions you could circumvent this by uninstalling the Logitech software in Windows and let the DiNovo run in HID mode under windows, and in Bluetooth mode in Ubuntu. For some reason, this does not work in 12.10. anymore.\n\nA: Solution is as follows.\n\n\n*\n\n*Keep the red button under the dongle pressed, while inserting the dongle into the USB port. The dongle is then recognised instantly. (did'nt need to do that on 12.04)\n\n*Pair you keyboard, so the keyboard is now attached to your dongle.\n\n*Reboot and you can even goto BIOS using your keyboard, however you will not see the dongle again when system boots. However your keyboard is still working.\n\nA: I had the same problem. Killing and starting bluetooh again solved my problem without installing/editing anything.

You can view and control systems in bidirectional. \nTightVNC is a opensource remote control software package. With TightVNC, you can see the desktop of a remote machine and control it. You can get it here. You need to configure router \n\nA: Summarizing from comments\nThe two computers are connected to the Internet by mobile (cell phone) data network. I will refer to the cell data service provider as the \"Internet Service Provider\" or ISP. There are two issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*The ISP is providing the NAT (Network Address Translation) service\nsuch that the computer has an internal IP address and an external IP\naddress with no apparent way to forward the ports of the external IP\naddress to the internal IP address.\n\n*The ISP is also blocks all the useful ports of the external IP\naddress.\n\n\nI have no knowledge of the specific ISP in question. However, generally ISPs take these actions to prevent mobile data connections to be used to connect servers and for the security of the customers. Sometimes ISPs prohibit the use of mobile data for servers in their service agreements. \nUnder these circumstances,  specifically if the ISP service agreement prohibit the use of mobile data for servers, the ISP is unlikely to open the ports needed to connect the two computers and forward the specific ports from the external IP address to the internal IP address. \nYour connections will work If the ISP:\n(a) opens the ports \n(b) and do either of the two following:\n\n\n*\n\n*forwards the open ports from the external IP to the NATed internal\nIP, or\n\n*provides you with a real IP, not a NATed one (See the quote from\nsuperuser below)\n\n\nWithout these from the ISP it is impossible to use the native solution to remotely connect from computer B to computer A.\nAbout conversion from NATed setup to real static IP setup from Superuser:\n\nThe problem lies on what address you are given, most of the time it's\n  already a NATed IP. However, many carriers can switch you to a real\n  \"external\" IP - which is generally used for VPN because sometimes NAT\n  can interfere with VPN (assuming you can get past the CSRs). However,\n  even though this would be a publicly addressable IP - I imagine that\n  they would still put in restrictions/firewall to prevent you from\n  doing exactly what you are trying to do.\n\nIf the ISP is agreeable to opening and forwarding ports, the I recommend using VNC over ssh tunnel for the following reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*VNC over ssh will require opening (and forwarding) of port 22 only (or some other port set by the user).\n\n*VNC over ssh is a more secure method where the data transmitted over\nthe mobile system is encrypted.\n\n*ssh can be set up to use public/private keys instead of passwords,\nwhich is much more difficult for hackers to crack.\n\n\nTo try this in Remmina, go to the ssh tab and check the two checkboxes, (a) use ssh, and (b) use tunnel. You may have to install ssh in both the computers.\nHowever, this solution is not available without port forwarding in NATed IP setup or a setup with direct access to the external IP. \nHope this helps.\n\nA: Forgettaboutit! You've done nothing wrong. You are just geting NATed by your mobile providers. On both ends. with no control over the routers. That's the worst case imaginable.\nI recommend splitting your question in two:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can you get any connection running between the machines.\n\n*If you got that far, you can see how to get a desktop connection.\n\n\nI recommend starting out with ssh. Connecting these two Computers is probably going to involve some ssh tunneling. It would be very good to have a third party with a public internet address. I.e. some cheap 2€/month VServer.\nBest would be to have a vpn solution. This is a bit tougher for starters, but more convenient in the long run.\nSorry. There is no easy answer for you. You either have to dig network tunnels or get a serious internet connection. Choose one. This may sound rude, but believe me, I'm just the messenger of bad news here. Please don't vote me down.\nHere is some lecture for further reading about your problem: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation#Drawbacks\nNote the phrase: Hosts behind NAT-enabled routers do not have end-to-end connectivity and cannot participate in some Internet protocols.\nAny solution anyone can come up with here will involve a third party.

For those of you who think the chosen names could be improved, you might be relieved to know that the \"Breezy Badger\" was originally going to be the \"Bendy Badger\" (I still think that rocked).

I have tried to download it in different browsers same problem.\n\nA: Open this as a text file.\nYou will able to see all links. Maybe you will be able to use them. Try each one, one by one.\n\nA: I can download the Ubuntu Server 12.04.1-i386 image just fine, but it appears to be a bad ISO. No matter which computer I use to download the image I am unable to read it. I am also unable to find a link back to the previous version ISO (12.04 without the .1).\nI've tried this using Mac OS X v10.8.2 (Mt Lion), Windows XP SP2, and VMware ESX.\nUPDATE: Also, the amd64 appears to have the same problem. Perhaps it's the mirror that the web site is pointing me to by default that has the bad images? I guess I'll start trying links from Xiokang's response...\nUPDATE: Doesn't seem to matter which mirror I use. The MD5 checksum verifies that the image I'm downloading matches what Canonical thinks I should have. However, I still can't do anything useful with the images, nor can VMware read it.\nChecksums:\n\n\n*\n\n*ubuntu-12.04.1-server-i386.iso  = 3daaa312833a7da1e85e2a02787e4b66\n\n*ubuntu-12.04.1-server-amd64.iso = a8c667e871f48f3a662f3fbf1c3ddb17\n\n\nThese match what Canonical has listed here.\nSOLUTION: Ok, apparently these images are SUPPOSED to be broken, as they are using some kind of hybrid multi session layout or something. OS X is not able to verify or read these images without extra help from some shell commands. Also, VMware, when using EFI mode, will not be able to boot from the images as well. Apparently these images are intended for applications (like Roxio Toast) to burn directly to physical optical media. Hence why they have the unusual hybrid configuration, which works fine when being read from a CD. Follow the instructions for creating a USB thumbstick in order to use the images on a Mac. For VMware, make sure that your ESX virtual machine is set to use BIOS rather than EFI.\n\nA: first of all, if you can download torrents which is the preferred way to download big files then use this \nhttp://releases.ubuntu.com/precise/\nif you don't want torrents. Then take my advice: Never download big files using the default downloader of the browser, they are so bad, do not support stopping and resuming, and you will often end up with a corrupted image. Use an independent download manager. If you're on windows use FDM, if you're on Linux download uget. \n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04/12.10 Keeps on Freezing \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat should I do when Ubuntu freezes? \n\nSince I installed Ubuntu 12.04 it keeps on freezing. It happens on different PCs and I don't think it's a memory problem. For example, I recently got a laptoptop with 8Gb of RAM and I got the problem there as well. The only solution is unplugging the machine or pressing +REISUB (I found this magic spell in a related thread).\nThe problem seems to be triggered by a task switch, e.g. when I press F12, which moves guake to the background or into the foreground or when I press ALT+TAB, which switches the current gui task.\nI am suspecting guake, Chrome, or Evince are possible causes of the problem. However, I disabled guake on the laptop and I've seen the problem once since then.\nI just reinstalled 12.10 and I had 3 freezes in 10 minutes. I wasn't doing anything special. The only thing I was doing was running Chrome and gimp.\n\nA: I have the same problem sometimes. There are 20 PC with Ubuntu OS in my office and just 1 of them had this problem randomly. I solved it by changing 32 bit to 64 bit. I think it is better to use the 64-bit version of Ubuntu with 8GB RAM (on your laptop). I do this and it helps most of the time. \nAnother possibility is a graphics card problem. I had a PC with Intel on-board graphics card and it was OK, but when I added an ATI graphic card to it, I had this problem again. This can be fixed by using the correct driver. \nI've also solve this problem in the past by upgrading the kernel to the latest stable one, from the mainline PPA\nHere's some instructions on upgrading the kernel\n", "Q: No permission to suspend/hibernate after upgrading to 12.10 After upgrading to Ubuntu 12.10, when I click on suspend/hibernate in the menu, nothing happens.

How do I get the hibernate/suspend buttons in my menu to work again?\n\nA: Here's a workaround. First you'll need to create a script that is on your PATH.

If you can help thanks!\n\nA: Well, If you totally lost root access Ubuntu is not going to allow you, from inside, to get root access. That would be a security issue.\nSecond, you shouldn't add a root user without a good reason. I recommend you to think why you need a root user.\nThe recommended way of dealing with that is by using the sudo system. The sudo system allows an user to promote an application or command-line (cdm as you call) program to act as root or other users without having to log in as this user. This adds an extra security layer in many senses.\nIn ubuntu the first user has the right to act as root. This means that when you use sudo you are going to execute the command given as root. If you are logged in as the first user created and you execute:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh -a\n\nYou are asked for YOUR user password. If you did not mess with that configuration you should be able to execute this command.\nBut this command will almost for sure not fix your problem. You will need to fix any problem that you made with the users manually by the command line.\nIt would be probably easier (if your installation is not really old or customized) to reinstall. But that's just a suggestion.\nPlease, tell us in the comments if you succeed. \n\nA: *\n\n*Your are using the console, aren't you? \nso the passwd command allows you to set a new password for your user.\n\n*If you reboot you can try to catch the right moment, when the grub console should pop up.

If you're happy with it, simply use cp with the backup option, this will \"make a backup of each existing destination file\". Since you said names don't matter that much that should be OK. Backed-up files will have a \"~\" attached to the name.

I have a laptop that I have used for many years, and it has had Ubuntu on it since maybe version 8.04 or so.\nThis morning I upgraded from 12.04 to 12.10. The upgrade process went perfectly smoothly until it rebooted.\nNow, when the computer boots, it goes into some kind of memory test, and never reaches GRUB.\nOn the one hand, it would seem that this is a hardware memory failure, and nothing to do with the operating system. On the other hand, I can't shake the feeling that it seems the timing is more than just coincidental. If my memory were as cataclysmically faulty as it now appears, I'm sure I would have seen some problems before today. In my experience, memory tends to start failing bit by bit, not all at once like this.\nIs it just a horrible coincidence, or is there anything about an OS that can impact or trigger a problem like I'm seeing?\n\nI've tried rebooting, but it will not get past the memory test. The memory test itself seems to go on indefinitely. It's been over 24 hours and it's still going. \n\nA: The issue sounds like a hardware problem to me and you can try to disconnect the HDD and you will probably see the system still failing at the memory test.  I have a few questions and suggestions:\nCan you somehow bypass this my hitting ESCAPE or ENTER to get past the test?\nCan you enter the BIOS? If so, try to reset it to the fail-safe configuration.\nSomething might be conflicting with BIOS RAM detection so try MemTest86. You can get it, from their site and make a bootable Cd or a floppy. Twelve to twenty four hours of testing proves your memory good or bad. Or you could try a process of elimination by removing all but 1 stick of Ram and see if it will post then - IF not remove that one and try another one - IF one of them works then go into BIos and check the Voltage and timing settings and save. Turn off the system and try the other sticks adding one at a time. - It doesn't need all of them to fail in order to stop posting so it may just be any one of the sticks or it could be the settings\n\nA: Two interrelated bu different things come to my mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*As the memory test shows your memory is faulty. Memory faults might cause random crashes.\n\n*The ubuntu grub file grub.cfg was altered during installation. One normally expects a grub boot menu during the boot process and chooses the relevant operating system if more than one os exists. Since you cannot boot to ubuntu, then u have one option: use a live cd to correct the grub.cfg file manually (not recommended) or \"sudo update-grub2\" command. Then, you should normally boot into ubuntu. Your system might crash due to memory faults randomly.\n\nA: You could also try unseating and then reseating the memory itself - thermal socket creep could be an issue, although it's a long shot.

Recently moved over onto Ubuntu. First time for anything like this for me as I'm coming from Windows but I'm here and ready to learn. The only problems Ive experienced so are saving in Libre office doc as a word doc file and then losing the formatting upon receival via email. However the more pressing issue is getting my old Brother DCP 135 c to work. Ive scanned a few help blogs and have found them frankly quite frightening.\nWould it be possible for someone to write u a step by step guide (including explanations of terminology)\nFor those of us new to this magic world?\n\nA: I have also a Brother printer (DCP-series) and it only started working after i installed  the Brother drivers. Have you tried that? If not, here's what it takes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Here you can find the driver for your printer (download the 2 .deb files). \n\n*Open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T)\n\n*If you are using a 64bit system, you have to install ia32-libs\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs\n\nAfter that just double click in each of the .deb files you downloaded and install it using Software Center. This should make your printer work (if not try restarting the system). Also, you can find a more complete guide here.\n\nA: Type \"brother\" in the search box in the Ubuntu Software center.\nInstall both drivers that you find there.\nThen open the terminal and type (as in Salem's answer):\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs\nIn my case the DCP-135 printer now works. However, the scanner facility does not currently work. I am still trying to fix it.\n\nA: To put the scanner to work follow the instrutions on this post: Brother scanner not working in Ubuntu 16.04 though driver installed.\nSamy's answer made my scanner work finally after months of investigation and failed trying.\n", "Q: Chrome in Ubuntu 12.10 It seems like Chrome isn't ready for Ubuntu 12.10 yet, as you get the error when trying to install it, should I install Chromium instead, or just stick with Firefox for a bit?\nThe only problem is, I like using the Chrome web apps. I have a nice clean install of 12.10, and don't want to mess it up with some dodgy installs already.\n\nA: As Google Chrome is a proprietary application it will never be available in Ubuntu repository, but you can install the Chromium web browser that also support the Google Chrome apps and you can also access the Chrome Web Store from it.\nTo install Chromium run the following command at the Terminal:\n sudo apt-get install chromium-browser\n\nTo install Google Chrome go to http://www.google.com/ and search for \"Get Google Chrome\"\n\nA: Chromium provides almost the same experience and same UI as Chrome, and it also allows you to change the theme and install web apps.  So you can install Chromium instead of Chrome. I think that there's no Chrome for linux system.\n\nA: Chromium has the same web-app creation feature as chrome.\n\nA: Stick with Chromium, it's quite easy to install (e.g. via Software Center), and there's no setup needed - it will sync with your user data much like any other Chrome distribution and you can access your bookmarks, web apps etc..\nNote, however, that Chromium needs to be updated manually (unlike Chrome), but that easy - just run the Update Manager once in a while and you're good to go. Other than that, it's pretty much identical to Chrome.\n", "Q: Where on the launchpad page given in the description is the ppa of openoffice that I need to add to get the repository? https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/quantal/amd64/openoffice.org/1:3.3.0-7ubuntu7\nPlease help me I've spent hours trying to figure out how to install openoffice on Quantal Ubuntu 12.10 and it is driving me nuts!\n\nA: There is no longer an app called OpenOffice.org.

Also Fn+F3 or Fn+F5 didn't work.\nI was in Ubuntu 12.04 and I thought it might be a system problem, but when I started my laptop with Ubuntu 12.10 installation disk, this problem still exits.\n\nA: look at Hard blocked: yes it seems at that time maybe you forgot about the hard switch. may be it was turned off ?\nI had the same problem wireless is disabled by hardware switch and this happens to me every time when I am in windows and I disable the wireless using the hard-switch. and when I reboot to Ubuntu, I see that I can't enable my wireless and the error is wireless is disabled by hardware switch.\nThen I found the command sudo rfkill unblock all which solved the problem. However I had to type it a couple of times before the command had enabled my wireless switch.\nSo what I will do is, go to windows, disable the wireless using the hard switch and then enable it again using the hard-switch while you are still in windows. then reboot to Ubuntu to see if it has worked. if not then use the command and type 3-4 times in the same terminal.\n\nA: Simple just check the wireless in your BIOS where if its set to off then change the value to on. It worked for me as am using Lenovo Thinkpad Edge laptop.\n\nA: I had the same problem with my Dell XPS 15 9530. I tried different Linux distros (Debian GNOME, Debian with Xfce, Ubuntu Workstation) and the problem never occurred. Then, in a new installation of Ubuntu Server + Openbox, I suddenly found my wireless disabled (hardware switch off):\nWith sudo rfkill list I received the following status:\nphy0: Wireless LAN\nSoft blocked: no\nHard blocked: yes\n\nsudo rfkill unblock all didn't help.\nThen I searched and tried several suggestions without success:\n\n\n*\n\n*There was no BIOS option that could help.  \n\n*Pressing the function keys on my keyboard didn't help.   \n\n*Loading/unloading modules didn't help.  \n\n\nThen I thought, if my operating system fights against me and I have no idea what could be wrong, I'll simply try to weaken it, put it in sleep mode and press the function key again (...). Indeed, this workaround did it:\nOn my Dell XPS 15 keyboard, there is a key with a wireless antenna symbol. (I have a German keyboard, where the function key for wireless on/off is not F2 but a separate key next to F12)   \n\n\n*\n\n*Put the notebook in sleep mode using sudo pm-suspend  \n\n*Reactivate the notebook by pressing the power button.   \n\n*Now press the correct function key(s) for removing the hardware lock during wake-up. \n\n\nThis doesn't work when the notebook is in sleep mode, you need to press the function key DURING the wake-up process. \nI am not a Linux specialist and  have no reasonable explanation for this technical workaround, so I apologize if this doesn't make a lot of sense. However it works (and in my case is required after every reboot). If someone has a more objective explanation why this worked, I'd appreciate your comment. I still would like to know what went wrong.

Based on your output, sudo apt-get install kernel-headers-3.5.0-17-generic should do it. On the guest VM, either autorun the ISO image or sudo sh ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run from the shell prompt should work. Appears this is a known problem with the latest 12.10 release.\n\nA: This is caused by the kernel headers not being available.  These headers are not typically required, but help other applications need them to build kernel modules to keep in sync with your distribution and the version you are using.\nYou can install specific headers, or you can install 'generic', or 'current':\nsudo apt install linux-headers-generic\n\nThis will ensure that when you take in new kernels, the headers of those kernels are also installed.  When you update your kernel, VirtualBox will be able to update itself with the newest, matching headers.  Sometimes these can be found by other names, such as linux-headers-amd64, in other distributions.\nAfter you have the headers, you can purge/re-install VirtualBox, or have VirtualBox rebuild the modules and complete the setup:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure virtualbox-dkms  \nsudo modprobe vboxdrv\n\n\nA: Didn't work for me. Solved it by running:      \ngksudo synaptic\n\nSearch for 'dkms' and (re)install the one for VirtualBox and press the 'Apply' button. The output should say that virtualbox kernel drivers are up and running.\n\nA: My Virtual Box told me that the kernel drivers were not installed. I ran  \nsudo apt-get remove virtualbox-dkms   \n\nto remove the drivers and then re-installed them   \nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-dkms \n\nwhich rebuilt the drivers and I was able to run virtualbox with no problems\n\nA: An other way:\napt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`\ndpkg-reconfigure virtualbox-dkms\n\nThe normal way:\n/etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup\n\n\nA: What worked for me: To run vboxconfig to rebuild virtualbox kernel drivers sudo /sbin/vboxconfig\n\nA: Okay...so I had this problem. I tried an amazing array of different things to solve the problem. What worked for me was turning off Bios Security.

How do I burn the latest 12.10 790 MB ISO to a CD?\nMy burning software says insert a disk but 700 MB CD's are too small. I tried a DVD and that didn't work either.\n\nA: There were many talks about the final size for Ubuntu 12.10. The decision was made that the CD size was not capable of handling the amount of packages and ideas that the developers wanted to put in 12.10, like for example Python3 and all other packages related to it. Additionally, since both DVD and USB are more used than common CD (Not all parts of the world, but most of them), the final decision was then made to start building against the DVD and USB sizes, starting with a size around 800MB, which eventually ended around 700MB but still, a couple of megabytes above the biggest size for a common CD disc (Assuming you are using a 650 or 700 size one).\nSo for 12.10, you can either use a DVD disc or USB (Pen drive, Flash drive...). This gives you 2 benefits:\n\n\n*\n\n*Faster loading than CD (Since reading a DVD or USB is much faster than a CD)\n\n*Faster installation than CD (Same reason as point 1)\n\n\nNote that this only affects the Desktop version, since the Server version still supports a CD size. Also note that this talk was also mentioned for 12.04 but in that case, they waited for 12.10 instead of applying the size change in 12.04.\nIn my personal opinion, with the increase in size of many programs, for example games (That even go out to sizes of bluray), and large download installer (Like in steam), or OS updates like the Windows 7 SP1, sizes bigger than 1 GB are more common. So it was just a matter of time before this really needed decision was made, which should help in promote more options for end users (Like me trying to see aptitude implemente again ^^). Hope this answer helps you.\n\nA: \nUbuntu 12.10 will increase the maximum size of its disc image from\n  700MB to 800MB, thereby making it too big to fit onto traditional CD-R\n  media.\nThe news came from Canonical’s Kate Stewart on the Ubuntu Mailing\n  list, who wrote:\n\n\"There  is no longer a traditional CD sized image, DVD or alternate\n    image, but rather a single 800MB Ubuntu image that can be used from\n    USB or DVD.\"\n\nUbuntu Server remains unaffected by the switch.\n\nSource: OMGUbuntu.com\n\nA: You can't\nlive cd option is no longer available for ubuntu, you should use live dvd or usb disk :)\n\nA: I would start by taking out the additional language files such as French, Spanish, ... This usually reduces the size by 100 or so MB. The files can be found in the source root of the disc. \n\nA: This was a decision made some time ago by Canonical, the corporate backers for Ubuntu.\nSee: OMG! Ubuntu > It’s Official: The Ubuntu LiveCD is Dead\n\nThe news came from Canonical’s Kate Stewart on the Ubuntu Mailing list, who wrote:\n\nThere  is no longer a traditional CD sized image, DVD or alternate image, but >> rather a single 800MB Ubuntu image that can be used from USB or DVD.\n\n\n\nI stopped burning a CD (or DVD) for ISO files about 2 years ago.\nA cheap 2GB Flash USB drive is 3-4 times faster for installs, and can be repeatedly reused (for later releases).\n\nA: If you know someone who knows how to repackage a boot image and modify the config files it can be done, im sick of people who just reply \"you cant\", it can be done, but like i said, you need someone who knows how to modify the 790mb image (perhaps leaving out a few measly pkgs or drivers you dont need). I have done this in the past...\nOh and there aren't just 2 options, Linux can be installed many ways not just USB and DVDs exist in the real world ya know... the MiniCD (34mb) or even better, if you have a machine already set up with PXE, or have a windows machine handy, you can set it up with  TFTPD and set up a pxe boot and get the ubuntu distros for it, i have tried this and it does work.. just google around you'll find lots of different ways to do this. I am currently working on shrinking the build to 700mb because i have 7 machines that need installs and none of them have DVD drives (all cd) and whats worse they are servers and have no way of using my IDE DVDROM cause its SCSI-LVD.. so.. if i ever get this done or find someone else who can do it for me i'll get back to ya, good luck -- hope that helps...

To create a proper DVD follow the instructions here.\nRegards.\n\nA: You could use the minimal cd iso which you can download from here. It's only 34MB so it's able to fit on a CD.\n\nA: You could try installing Ubuntu 12.04 via CD and then upgrading it immediately after installation to 12.10.\nTo do that, check out this article on OMG!Ubuntu!\n\nA: Yeah,as david6 said, you can use a Flash USB device.uncompress the files in the iso to you USB device and boot from the USB device just like your CD.(you can use ultraISO to uncompress the iso to your usb device)\n\nA: Your two alternatives are either to burn a DVD or to make an Ubuntu live USB. \nBurn a DVD\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert a blank DVD into your burner.

This limits your partitioning options during setup, of course.\nIf you use your swap partition for this, you might save yourself a bit of trouble, since swap is the easiest thing to deal with after install.\n\nA: Try using a USB, as other had stated. You can get one for pretty cheap from your local Staples or other such market.\n\nA: I know this is an old post but I am going to try an answer anyway.  \nThere are some mini.iso files that have been created that are anywhere from 27MB ~ 40MB in size.  After you have created the CD / USB media with one, it boots up and starts to download the required packages.  Recommended to do this with a hard wired connection (I don't think I was able to get it to connect wireless until after the installation).  \nAfter the required installation packages are downloaded, it then asks you all the packages you want installed.  It even has the ability to install the GNOME Desktop without Unity, and vice versa.\nThe files can be found here.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Check hash (MD4, MD5, SHA-1, and CRC) on Ubuntu 12.04 and 12.10 I have a lot of iso-files downloaded from internet.

Also, I don't want my projects to be in any way exposed to the general Internet while they're still half-baked.\nHere's what I have to work with:\n\n\n*\n\n*1 quad-core machine that acts as a file server, DHCP server, and DNS\nserver.  I am OK with letting MAAS handle DHCP and DNS on my network.  I am NOT OK\nwith reinstalling the OS in a special configuration.\n\n*1 quad-core machine that can be freely reinstalled or whatever.\n\n\nSo far, I've installed MAAS on the first machine (although it seems I'm getting bitten by bug #1067929 still, despite my use of the workaround), added the second machine as a node, and (apparenlty) commissioned it.  MAAS lists the status of the second machine as \"Allocated to root\" (root being my MAAS user).  Juju, however, obstinately refuses to do anything.  Running it from my laptop ended in failure because apparently it can't handle MAAS with an HTTPS URL.  Running it on the first machine using HTTP gets further, but bootstrapping fails because \"No matching node is available.\"  Research suggests that Juju needs at minimum 2 actual, physical machines, but I have yet to see an adequate explanation of why.\n(I have to say, I'm rather intrigued by MAAS.  With a bit more work (especially in QA), it looks like it could be the centralized machine management platform I've been looking for.)\nSo, now I find myself looking at DevStack.  I can't say I'm particularly thrilled by the idea of downloading some script off GitHub and running it as root, but that seems to be the least painful path.  Is DevStack really the way to go?  Does it work with Ubuntu 12.10?  Does it handle routing and DNS automatically? (I would rather not have to fiddle with bind9 configuration files every time I create a new cloud VM, and I would rather not have to fiddle with iptables at all.)\n\nA: From my experience (I've done OpenStack installations using Dodai-deploy, manually and development DevStack setups), DevStack is the best way to go if you primarily want to center around something non-production - testing, development. All the other methods (including Juju+MaaS from what I've poked around) are still hard to deploy and there are too many knobs to be fiddled with until you get things operating. Don't get yourself caught in them if you don't have to.\nIf you're worried about security, my advice is to create a Virtualbox image with 4 cores on top of the hardware you've got and install DevStack in it (a short guide - not very different than a normal devstack installation). You can do this in a couple of hours. It's a cloud within a \"cloud\", but that's not a big problem (apart from speed) - accepting all the default settings gives you VMs which can reach each other and the internet, which is all that's important. As far as I remember I installed it in a 12.10 image and it worked fine. You're right about being reluctant to install everything on a physical machine if you use it for any other purposes. Also, with VMs you have the extra benefits of snapshotting them and reverting back in case you mess something up.\nAlternatively, to achieve a level of sandboxing you can try Juju + Linux containers (LXCs) or maybe LXCs + devstack and I heard people had good experience with LXCs, but I haven't tried them myself.\n", "Q: How to make hidden windows show up in alt-tab box I'm trying to get a 'show desktop' shortcut to work, so I'm using 'hide all windows' shortcut to show the desktop.

Uninstalling the proprietary drivers did the job, everything worked unexpectedly smooth, but soon after boot, the laptop started heating up and continued doing it, even during idle (70 celsius in idle is a lot). Formatted everything and installed 12.04, now everything works fine with the proprietary drivers (around 49 celsius while idle, will need to clean the fan soon).

I've currently got all of my music saved on a NAS server, and want to play it on my Ubuntu machine as well as Windows, which works fine using Linux music software. \nThe problem is I'm so obsessed with Foobar2000 (Windows music player), that I'd rather have that running under Wine to play music on. If I try to create a virtual drive in Wine pointing to the network location it doesn't work, Foobar2000 can't find any music there.\nAlternatively, if I create a Samba share of my local music folder, Wine recognises the location and I can play music from there, and I can also access the folder from Windows. This works great, but I'd rather be storing my music on the NAS server.\nSo, is there any way I can integrate a remote network location into Wine, so that programs in Wine can access the Network? Like how I'm using the Samba share, but files stored on a server?\n\nA: Found a solution.\nNetwork Locations are found in /home/user/.gvfs, so linking Wine to there works.\n", "Q: webapps doesn't show up I have chosen some of the available webapps to integrate to my ubuntu 12.10, but none of them are functioning.

I was a little surprised to discover that in LibreOffice (3.5.4.2), the spell check doesn't actually work. I was surprised since spell checkers have been around since....80's? Not a difficult thing.\nI am running Ubuntu 12.04, on a relatively new install. I haven't done anything to my dictionaries or language files. \nUnder tools>options>languages> writing aids, I have the option selected to check as I type and to use the English dictionaries. \nHowever, I get no errors when I type spelling mistakes on purpose, and when I run the checker it just says the spell check has completed and closes the window.\nIs this a bug with Libre? or have I done something wrong?\n\nA: To install the spell check packages for English and USA the terminal commands are:\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install myspell-en-gb myspell-en-us\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you already have installed hunspell-en-gb then you have to remove it to install myspell-en-gb.  \n\n*If you already have installed hunspell-en-us then you have to remove it to install myspell-en-us.  \n\n\nA: Install the following:\nsudo apt-get install myspell-en-us\n\nNow restart the office suite to make the spell check work. Hope this helps\n\nA: A quick fix for the current document (assuming English text) is Tools - Language - For All Text - English (USA). \nI think the permanent fix is to make sure that the default language used for documents is supported by an installed dictionary.  This solution has been documented by \"idiota\" on LibreOffice's questions forum:\n\"The problem is fixed by clicking Tools/Options/Language Settings/Languages.  It allows dozens of flavours of English, BUT spelling is disabled for all the ones that don't have the little blue tick ABC icon beside them.\"\nhttp://ask.libreoffice.org/question/1678/spell-checking-not-working-in-v342/\n\nA: In my case the spell-check option to enable my language of choice was not present.\nThe dictionaries were installed so the problem was with the office program.\nThis was remedied by the following :\n\n\n*\n\n*killall soffice.bin\n\n*rm -r .config/libreoffice/\n\n*Start LibreOffice & go to Tools->Options-> Language Settings -> Default language for documents: English UK (now with spell check icon)\nPS: For English UK I have libreoffice-l10n-en-gb and myspell-en-gb installed. \n\nA: When choosing your language do you see the check besides it?\nIf not then open up \"Language Support\" and click on \"Install / Remove Languages...\" and install the language you want and close LibreOffice and try again.\n\nA: Go to -> tools-> options-> languages-> western. Then set the western language as English usa as it is enabled with spell checking.\n\nA: If you've chosen anything other than English (USA), it'll likely not have spellcheck available.\nThat's the A with green dots seen here:\n\nIf you need a GB, AU, CA or ZA English variant, install the English Dictionaries extension.\n", "Q: Shade effects not working ubuntu 12.10 Apologies if this has been asked elsewhere.\nDespite the option still being available in CCSM, shade effects are apparently broken in 12.10\nI'm not using the unity plugin (because it still sucks) instead making do with Cario-Dock for my interfaces.\nIs there are work around for this?

Things get confusing when there is bridging or tunneling interfaces, vm interfaces, bonded interfaces, and so on.  With this output, I'm not sure why your interface is listed as eth1, but given that it is the only one with an address, that's probably it. \nWithout more info, I'm guessing that Ubuntu/Linux is misidentifying your onboard NIC. \nYou can use wireshark or tcpdump to confirm that traffic is originating from the interface you believe it is. \nwireshark is a GUI-based capture tool (with a command-line option), while tcpdump is a command line tool.  You can see its output quickly (once installed) with something like sudo tcpdump -i any. \nIf you have access to your wireless gateway, you can use it to view the connected devices.  The MAC address your system is using to connect will be there. \nAs LivewireBT suggests, there may be a clue in /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules .  \nTo see what interfaces your computer is recognizing and bringing up, look at the output of your system logs.  Using dmesg is probably the easiest.\nHere's an example:\n~$ dmesg | egrep 'lan|eth'\n[    1.608941] e1000e 0000:00:ff.0: eth0: (PCI Express:2.5GT/s:Width x1) 5c:af:0a:15:42:a2\n[    1.608943] e1000e 0000:00:ff.0: eth0: Intel(R) PRO/1000 Network Connection\n[    1.608994] e1000e 0000:00:ff.0: eth0: MAC: 9, PHY: 10, PBA No: 2041FF-0FF\n[   29.486325] IPv6: ADDRCONF(NETDEV_UP): eth0: link is not ready\n[   30.532255] IPv6: ADDRCONF(NETDEV_UP): eth0: link is not ready\n[   33.622226] e1000e: eth0 NIC Link is Up 1000 Mbps Full Duplex, Flow Control: Rx\n[   33.622856] IPv6: ADDRCONF(NETDEV_CHANGE): eth0: link becomes ready\n[   43.880499] IPv6: ADDRCONF(NETDEV_UP): wlan0: link is not ready\n[   43.880939] IPv6: ADDRCONF(NETDEV_UP): wlan0: link is not ready\n[   50.500518] wlan0: authenticate with 0c:d9:0f:23:ae:0f\n[   50.541272] wlan0: send auth to 0c:d9:0f:23:ae:0f (try 1/3)\n\nNote the MAC addresses associated with e1000e/eth0 (the wired Gigabit interface), and wlan0 (the wireless).  Your computer should have something similar, even if the actual interface name is not what we'd expect. \n\nA: Removing the entry from /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules might help assigning the interface a more suitable name.\n\nA: iwconfig shows the wireless information including the mac address, just like ifconfig shows the ethernet information.\nHere is a link for iwconfig that tells what everything it shows and what the information means.\niwconfig\n\nA: I used ifconfig | grep HWaddr.\n\nA: Using my file manager and editor (read-only), I found my MAC address here:\nGo to \"Other Locations\"\nChoose: Computer | sys | class | net | wlp3s0\nand open the file named \"address\"\nUsing the terminal window the command is:\nsudo nano /sys/class/net/wlp3s0/address  \n\nClose the editor with Ctrl X, don't try to save anything!\n", "Q: Realtek RTL8188CE wireless is slow The wireless used to be just fine now is dead slow.\nHow i should troubleshoot this issue any idea?

Backstory:\nI am working on setting up a MineCraft server and want to allow admins to have ssh access to the MineCraft server console and appropriate mc server files, but not the whole system. The console provided by the minecraft server is only available to the user that launched the process. In addition, the admins will need terminal access to some basic cli tools such as wget, cp, mv, rm, and  a text editor.\nPlan:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have already setup the ssh aspect of things, requiring pre-shared\nkeys and whatnot. \n\n*Setup a jailed environment in which all user activity will be contained.\n\n*Setup user accounts.\n- The first user account will be the minecraft user. The minecraft user will start the MC server in a multiuser screen session and allow the other admins to attach to it.\n- Subsequent users should have their own /home directory for normal usage.\n\n*Setup acl for the appropriate files to allow each user to edit the mc server files.\n\n\nNo one will be doing system updates, nor will anyone be installing any programs, so I'll be the only user with sudo.\nThe Issues:\nI don't want the ssh users to have access to the whole system. Users will still need to use wget or curl to update the mc server files. I have no experience setting up a chroot environment and have found several tools to aid in this process. Jailkit seems to be the most robust, but it's not in the standard repos.\nThe Questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is chroot the right tool for this use case, or is there something\nmore appropriate for the job?\n\n*Should there be a chroot environment for each user, or one chroot\nenvironment for all users?\n\n*Should chroot be setup by hand, or should I use one of the tools\navailable?\n\n*How will system updates effect a chroot environment?\n\n*Which chroot tool is the most newb friendly? Which chroot tool is the most robust?\n\n*Would a VM be a better solution overall?\n\n\nA: I won't answer point by point as I don't know all the answers, but I will give you these pointers:\n\n\n*\n\n*A chroot isn't terribly difficult to break out of. A VM is somewhat harder.\n\n*A VM is much easier to set up and manage as it is a full OS.\n\n*A chroot can have a smaller footprint as it's not necessarily a full OS.\n\n*In either case, the guest environment will not be updated when you run updates on the host. You'll have to enter the chroot or VM and update it manually.\n\n*A VM has a feature which may be good or bad for you: You typically have to provision a fixed amount of memory for it. Minecraft can be very memory hungry, so you might run out with a VM. On the other hand, a VM would be an easy way to put a hard limit on the resources it can use.\n\n*Neither a VM nor a chroot will place any intrinsic limits on what users can do over the network. Only a firewall can do that.\n\n\nA: Using a chroot jail is a false sense of security for the most part.  It keeps honest users honest.  If you do not trust the users to log into the machine, you should give them a different machine, a VM.\nFor network security, attach the Minecraft machine to a different zone on your firewall with very restrictive rules.  If Minecraft is running on the firewall machine, the only safe solution is to use VMs running on that machine.\n", "Q: Android SDK PATH Error: doesn´t find home directory I use Ubuntu 12.10 and I tried to follow this guide Install android sdk and eclipse in Ubuntu 12.04 but I keep getting this error:\n Error: The AVD manager normally uses the user's profile directory to store AVD files.

Most importantly I do not want a centralized server that works as DNS server 24/7 and consumes a lot of energy in addition to the energy consumed already by the modem offering its own LAN-dhcp services. i.e. I need a decentralized DNS service.\nHas anyone ever heard of such a script?\nBut I guess that's too much to ask, is some way to automatically read the /etc/hostname file of all computers at the moment they enter my LAN and update name-resolution directly without the need for a /etc/hosts file. Anyone know if that would be possible without altering the dhcp server?\n\nA: As you're probably going to use IP the MAC addresses won't help you at all. What you want is mDNS to reslove local host names. In Ubuntu, this is activated automatically. You should be able to resolve other computer's IP addresses using their name plus .local as in:\nmy-pc.local\n\n", "Q: How to get windows back? Lubuntu? I installed lubuntu and I don't like it. I did a clean install to lubuntu rather than making it dual. Now when I want to go back to Windows it won't work. I put the Windows Vista CD in and it won't load. It just loads lubuntu back. I know for a fact that the CD works just fine. I don't know what to do? I did a little research and it says I deleted the windows loader or the partition. Can someone help me?\n\nA: From what I understand, you want to reinstall Windows Vista, boot your computer won't boot into the DvD. \n\n\n*\n\n*Power your computer on. When the BIOS screen appears (the first screen to appear during the boot process), press the \"Delete\" key. This is the most common way to enter the BIOS settings on a computer, though some systems differ. If the Delete key does not access the BIOS setting on your computer, look for different instructions on the screen itself. For example, it may say \"Press F10 to enter setup.\"\n\n*Using the arrows on your keyboard, scroll down to \"Boot Device Select\" and press \"Enter.\"\n\n*Change the boot order, moving DVD drive to the first boot device.\n\n*Insert the DVD you wish to boot from.\n\n*Save your changes and exit BIOS. Look for on-screen instructions on how to save and exit, as this option differs between systems. Exiting BIOS will force your computer to restart. When it does, it will boot from the Vista DVD.\n\nA: i had similar problem.Windows just cant see hard drive after ubuntu changed it to ex4 format  type..

I have no idea how to do it....\n\nA: Depending on your desired partition setup, just click on the free space and click the \"+\" to add a swap partition of whatever size you want, and then click the \"+\" again to create a / partition (probably with the default ext4 file system, unless you want something specific from another file system) filling the rest of the drive (or split your / and /home into separate partitions if you'd like to preserve your data should you need to reload Ubuntu).\nAfter it's installed, you'll be presented with a Grub menu to choose to boot Ubuntu or Windows.\n\nA: In gparted there, you can right click a partition or use the options in the partition button on the menu bar to select resize partition on one of your partitions, allowing you to allocate unallocated space for Ubuntu to install on.\nOnce you are done, make sure to select Apply Changes.\n", "Q: Any search tool for LXDE menu?

What is more likely is that you did a normal dual boot, and now that you've removed the Ubuntu partitions, Grub can no longer boot (most of Grub's code is stored on the partition and without it you end up at a Grub rescue prompt). I doubt that you can boot Windows from the grub rescue because you've remove the partitions already (you'll need grub modules to boot).\nSo what you need to fix it is to reinstall a Windows bootloader, either from a Windows repair CD prompt: bootrec /fixmbr, or you can install something like lilo from a linux live CD:\nsudo apt-get install lilo\nsudo lilo -M /dev/sda mbr\n\nOr if you use something like boot-repair it will install another Windows-style bootloader.

In my personal experience on two computers, it works ok.\nThere are however a few things you can do to get them to work awhile we wait for patches to come through the Software Updater.\nFirst, open Fire Fox, click Edit>Preferences In the General tab at the bottom, you will see Desktop Integration, make sure it is checked. There is a button that says \"Exceptions...\", click it and make sure there are no exceptions:\n\nFor this second tip, here isn't much documentation on if this works or not, but I find it helped me. Open the Ubuntu Software Centre, and search for \"Webapps\". At the bottom of the search, you will see something like \"Show 57 technical items\", click that. Now you will see all the Webapps, you can install the ones you want one by one. Alternatively, you can install them all by using this command,\n\nsudo apt-get install unity-webapps-*\n\n\nLastly, to install the Chromium extension for Unity Webapps (I didn't manage to get a single Webapp to work in Chromium), use this command:\n\nsudo apt-get install unity-chromium-extension\n\nRemember thought that this is all new to Ubuntu, and that the bugs will be ironed out in the next few week through updates.

How I can safely remove a USB external drive?\nUbuntu 12.10 does not come with this option, only to \"Unmount\" the disk, but not \"Eject\".\n\nI have tried both USB sticks and with my external hard drive.\n\nA: There seems to be a bug report about the missing option.\n\n@k-k-patel Even if \"eject\" and \"safely remove\" are virtually the same for external hard drives, none of the two are available. Only \"unmount\" is offered.\n@hari @isoma No \"unmount\" and \"eject/safely remove\" are not the same and even for an external hard drive \"eject/safely remove\" is not subsumed by \"unmount\". For instance, consider a drive with two partitions. If the \"user\" unmounts one of them, the other one will remain mounted, and, as a result, if the user unplugs the drive, they face a data loss on the second partition. On the other hand, if the user \"ejects/safely removes\" the first partition, both will get unmounted.\n\n\nA: Gnome Disks Utility has an option to Power off a disk.\nYou can first unmount the partitions as suggested in other answers or using the Gnome Disks Utility as I explained below.\n\n*\n\n*access gnome-disk-utility searching for 'Disks' on Gnome Applications Menu or typing gnome-disks on a terminal.\n\n*Select the disk in the left list\n\n*Unmount the partitions clicking on each of them and clicking on the Stop button for each of them.\n\n*click on the Power Off button located on the window top bar.\n\n\nA: To safely remove i.e. disconnect an external USB drive you need to manually unmount all of its partitions (represented by 'drive icons'):\neither in Unity Launcher\n\nor in Nautilus\n\nIn the example above: \nto remove my Hitachi external USB drive I have to unmount all of the partitions on the said drive. To make things easier when formatting my drive I named (labelled) all of its partitions so that the names (labels) begin with 'HIT'.\nFor further reading please refer to the bug report (the lack of either \"Safely remove\" or \"Eject\" is a bug in Ubuntu 12.10):\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/udisks2/+bug/1067876\nDon't forget to mark 'This bug affects me' in the upper portion of the page.\n\nA: My toy project can help on this problem:\nhttps://github.com/fenrrir/bdin\nThis is a appindicator for ubuntu that uses udisks for detach device\n\nA: I found a way to do this in Nautilus, in Ubuntu 12.04, using Gnome desktop (not Unity). There was no \"unmount\" in the right-click menu. But, there was an icon to the right of the name of the USB hard drive. I clicked it and it did the unmount, and after that 1) \"Mount\" was in the menu and 2) \"Safely remove\" worked fine. \n\nA: *\n\n*If external drive was connected when I turned on my PC - I have\n\"Unmount\".\n\n*If external drive was connected after I turned on my\n    PC - I have \"Safely remove drive\".\n\n\nFor the first case I used \"Unmount\" in Nautilus and \"Power Off\" in Disks application.\n\nA: 'Eject' works same as safely remove\n\nA: Unmount and eject are the same. If you need to check it, Open Terminal after eject/Unmount the drive and type this command : mount You wont be able to see the device if it's unmounted\n\nA: “Eject” is for drives with removable media, like a DVD drive. An external hard drive does not have any eject mechanism.\n“Unmount” is the correct operation to use before you unplug the drive.\n\nA: You can always unmount in a save way using the console, that said the \"safe remove of a device\" is under the hood nothing else but un-mounting all mounted partitions of a device. \nsudo -s -- 'sync; umount <mounted-folder>'\n", "Q: How do I install Compiz extra animations?

New Nautilus version 3.6 (coming with Gnome 3.6 / Ubuntu 12.10) is showing annoying text tips on the bottom right/left edge as a new feature.\nIs there a way to disable it?\n\nA: No, there is no way to remove the tip in the bottom left/right edges when you select a file or folder showing it's information. \nThis has been called floating status bar and the gnome developers wants to remove the old status bar also!! The old status bar is still available in 12.10. If you select from menu → View → Status bar, the old status bar will be activated and you will get rid of the new floating status bar.

Now I would like to install a fresh 12.10 release. I have a separated /home partition.\nAfter installing a new version, I need to configure users on the system. \nHow to add new users that will use the existing /home partition? \nIf I have user \"user1\" and there is /home/users1 folder, would adding a new user \"user1\" delete the existing /home/user1 folder and create a new one or it will use the existing /home/user1 folder?\n\nA: Adding a new user will not overwrite the existing /home/username. You will however, want to look at your current /etc/passwd file and make sure that the UID's for each user on the newly installed system match the existing one. For example, User 1's UID = 1000; User 2's UID = 1001; etc.  \nThe way to check this is to open a terminal and run cat /etc/passwd \nThe following is an example of an /etc/passwd file:\nroot:!:0:0::/:/usr/bin/ksh\ndaemon:!:1:1::/etc:\nbin:!:2:2::/bin:\nsys:!:3:3::/usr/sys: \nadm:!:4:4::/var/adm:\nuucp:!:5:5::/usr/lib/uucp: \nguest:!:100:100::/home/guest:\nnobody:!:4294967294:4294967294::/:\nlpd:!:9:4294967294::/:\nlp:*:11:11::/var/spool/lp:/bin/false \ninvscout:*:200:1::/var/adm/invscout:/usr/bin/ksh\nnuucp:*:6:5:uucp login user:/var/spool/uucppublic:/usr/sbin/uucp/uucico\npaul:!:1000:1000::/home/paul:/usr/bin/bash\njdoe:*:1001:1001:John Doe:/home/jdoe:/usr/bin/bash  \n\nSo when you make new users be sure that Paul is user 1000 and John Doe is user 1001; etc. That way the files that belonged to these users will still belong to them.

I have got Ubuntu 12.04 alongside Windows 7 on Dell Inspiron mini 160 GB. The size of Ubuntu is not sufficient now. Can I redraw partition size when upgrading to Ubuntu 12.10, as I find myself not able to understand GParted.\n\nA: Yes, You can resize the partition in the installation process. You have to select something else option in the partitioning phase. But, This can be sometimes tricky and I recommend using Gparted in the Live session.\nIf you are referring to resizing the partition while doing upgrade (using update-manager), you cannot. You cannot resize, delete or otherwise change the partition while using it (the partition is mounted at /)\nIf you want to upgrade with update-manager\nIf you want resizing of the existing partition, and also do not want to do a fresh installation, You can use the Live session. Take note that, you must have free space after the Ubuntu partition or create free space\n\n*\n\n*Boot to a Live Ubuntu system.\n\n\n*Open gparted by typing \"Gparted\" in the dash\n\n\n*Select the next partition just after the Ubuntu, Select resize and move the slider from left to right to make some space just after the Ubuntu installation. Then click on Apply button. This might take some times, so take precaution for power/battery down.\n\n\n\n*After you created free space, select the existing Ubuntu partition, then right-click → Resize and move the slider from the right end to fill all the gray free space area. Then click on Apply button.\n\n\n\n*Now, exit the Live session, boot to your Ubuntu installation and perform upgrade from it.\nThis method might not work, if your Ubuntu is a primary partition and the partition immediately following is an extended/logical partition. (This might be possible also, but I haven't tested it).\n\nA: In that case , upgrading wont help you, you need to make a fresh installation of ubuntu alongside your existing windows, and while installation, you need to specify partition.\nI suggest have a look at gparted once again : http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/gparted.html\n", "Q: High temperature on my laptop with Radeon Mobility HD4670 As almost everyone here, I guess, in these days I downloaded Quantal Quetzal to give it a try. However I noticed that my laptop runs fairly hot with cooling fans almost always on, even sitting in the desktop doing nothing. \nI downloaded XSensor to read temperature sensors, and I saw that while CPU stays on about 65°C, so quiet normal I guess, the GPU sits at 75°C. In comparison my actual Windows 7 installation, which dual boots witb Quantal, stays at 59°C CPU and 65°C. So I went reading and learned that AMD dropped support for my video card from fglrx package, and that fglrx-legacy won't support 1.13 Xorg, so I'm basically stuck with OSS drivers. \nSo I was guessing if there's anything I can try, and if it's possible that the OSS drivers could be the cause of the high temperature?\n\nA: The high temperature is caused by the poor power management of the open source drivers. Installing the latest proprietary drivers would help, if official support for the HD4xxx series hadn't been dropped with Quantal. So you're left with two options:\n1.) Install the legacy FGLRX drivers through a custom PPA that ships with an older version of X.ORG. \nAdvantages: unsurpassed power management, better performance both in 3D and 2D apps ; \nDisadvantages: packages provided by user, no guarantee that installation will work, might even break your system\nTutorial\n\n2.) Adjust the power management of the open source drivers.\nAdvantages: safer option\nDisadvantages: neither power management nor performance will be close to the proprietary drivers; this might change in the future, mind you\nTutorial , Making the changes persistent\n\nA: Latest proprietary AMD Catalyst driver version 12.9 cannot be used with Ubuntu 12.10 If you have an AMD Radeon HD 2xxx-4xxx series card.\nDrivers for these cards are now available in a separate branch called legacy series. Unfortunately these legacy drivers (version 12.6) have not been updated to work with Ubuntu 12.10. Ubuntu 12.10 comes with xorg 1.13 while these drivers have support for older xorg 1.12.\nSo if you want to install these drivers in Ubuntu 12.10, you have to downgrade to xorg 1.12. A PPA has been provided by Tomasz Makarewicz that includes all the required packages you need to downgrade plus a fglrx-legacy package.\nTo install these packages, run the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:makson96/fglrx \n\nsudo apt-get update \n\nsudo apt-get upgrade \n\nsudo apt-get install fglrx-legacy\n\nDo note that these packages are not officially supported by Ubuntu, so use them at your own risk. If something goes wrong, you can purge the packages by running following commands:\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\n\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:makson96/fglrx\n\nSOURCE OF ANSWER\n\nA: Unfortunately, yes.\nIf you can't install the proprietary drivers (that anyway doesn't work on quantal!)

I am doing a fresh installation of Ubuntu 12.10, and it says than I can install Ubuntu using the entire disk and create LVM \"partitions\", but my plan is to install Windows 7 using one of those LVM partitions for dual boot. Is this possible?\nWhat is the right strategy to do this?\n\nA: If you want to run Windows natively it would have understand LVM, and that seems to not be the case(1, 2).\nI suppose you could allocate a virtual machine disk on a LVM partition, and run Windows inside the virtual machine.\nHowever, if you are only concerned about using LVM in Ubuntu you can\n\n\n*\n\n*install Windows on raw disk partitions\n\n*Install grub on one partitition (to boot) and LVM on another partition and allocate all remaining volumes from inside the LVM.    \n\n\nA: install windows 7 first then ubuntu over the top.  the ubuntu installer will take care of partitioning for you.  i usually split the disk in two when installing windows so i have a separate 'data' partition but you don't have to do that.  you can actually install ubuntu from within windows using the windows installer.  if in doubt do it that way because it's easy peasy to uninstall if you don't like it.\n\nA: with Ubuntu's Ubiquity installer (LVM supported since version 12.10) this is not possible if you install Ubuntu on the same physical drive as Windows 7. However, I wonder myself if there is a way to do it nevertheless, maybe using other tools or do it via terminal?\n\nA: I am trying the same thing. I think it is not possible to install ubuntu first and then install windows on LVM. it is possible in the opposite way. First install windows 10 (preferably) thereafter install Hyper-v, create ubuntu machine inside VM. Add Boot entry to BCD and dual boot. Later you may install your another windows host on VM through Hyper-V and completely remove the entry of windows 10.

Then it will install flawlessly (and if it is a Pentium-M (even one of those early ones that are missing the pae flag) then it will boot and run without errors).\nTo do so do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install 12.04 Precise (maybe you have that already)\n\n*Install the package \"fake-pae\" from this repository\n\n*Do a normal distribution upgrade to 12.10 and enjoy the new Version :-)\n\n\nAs long as you have the fake-pae package installed there won't be any problems with kernel updates, these kernels run just fine on Pentium-M, even the early ones that do not announce their pae capability in their cpu flags.

I'd like to give the new nouveau drivers a try. When I try a Ubuntu live distro, they work pretty flawlessly, but I don't seem to be able to use them correctly on my installed system.\nWhat I do is remove Nvidia drivers from the Additional drivers utility and reboot, but what I get is no 3D acceleration and low resolution on my monitor. What am I doing wrong?\nI wonder if I might have broken something when I messed up with grub trying to fix the infamous plymouth splash screen...\nThanks for your support\n\nA: OP probably solved his problem but for future reference.\nIf you have tested various versions of nvidia drivers using jockey, it will just revert to whatever version of nvidia you have on your computer. You must continuously remove drivers on jockey until all versions are grayed out.\nIf you're stuck on command line, there is a command line jockey that can be started by jockey-text. Type jockey-text --help to see the list of options. You need to work with it as su (sudo) in order to disable/enable drivers.\nFinally, you must remove xorg config file i.e. sudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf since nvidia settings in it will most likely clash with nouveau and can prevent X from starting.\n\nA: Could it be that the nouveau drivers are blacklisted?\nSee if it something in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf or in one of the others in /etc/modprobe.d/\nSo, if there is, uninstall NVidia drivers, remove the blacklist nouveau line in the blacklist file(s) and reboot.

However, after the 12.10 upgrade, all but a few no longer work. Is there a way to get them back manually, or must I wait until the extension authors make updates for Quantal Quetzal? \nI'm using gnome-shell 3.6.1 and installed the extensions using extensions.gnome.org.\n\nA: http://www.noobslab.com/2012/10/install-gnome-shell-36-and-gnome-shell.html\nthis helped me, but it contains only some of them...I don't do how to get the others, because from the website they don't work...even if you put them on ''on'' mode, they're not installed\n\nA: *DOH* just noticed this question was a bit long in the tooth. Answer still applies, but is probably not particularly relevant any longer.\n\nYou can try to update them manually where the author hasn't updated their extensions, though they may or may not actually work.\nIf you've installed the extensions locally for your user (likely when using extensions.gnome.org), the extensions will be in \n\n~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/\n\nWithin that directory will be one directory for each extension in the form extension@something . Within each extension@something directory will be several files, open the one named metadata.json. You'll see a line something like:\n\n\"shell-version\": [\"3.6.1\"]\n\nmodify that line by adding ,\"3.8\" (or whatever version of gnome-shell you're running) to it:\n\n\"shell-version\": [\"3.6.1\", \"3.8\"]\n\nSave and repeat for each extension that doesn't work. Then logout/login. This will work so long as nothing else changed in the newer gnome-shell that the extension relied upon. This is not a given. IF there are any problems, remove your modification (just the part you added , not the whole line).\n", "Q: Why is my OpenOffice.org presentation opening in LibreOffice Writer? I have project created in OpenOffice.org Impress which is created in a local language. Today when I open it what I could see is:\n\nWhen I open with the settings what I could see is Writer is opening which is complete of the symbol \"#\".\n\nHow can I recover my project?\n\nA: Libre Office shouldn't open an impress file in Writer, but in its own Impress. As such: Try to force it to open through Impress (via context menu or the Ctrl+O dialogue on Impress).\nIf that doesn't work, it's either an issue with the file extension or the collation you used, in which case we'd need more information on the file(s) in question.\n\nA: It looks to me like your presentation is corrupted. If you still have a copy of the version of OpenOffice.org that you used, you can try to open it in there. If it opens fine, export it to ppt format (Microsoft Office 2003).\nDo not try to save it from within Writer. If Impress will not open the file, then for sure your file has become corrupted.\nTo be sure, you can rename the file so that the file extension is .zip, and open it with Archive Manager. This will tell you if the file is corrupted (at the level of the compressed file) or if it is corruption in the xml files.\n\nA: Before you start, make a copy of the 'corrupt' file for backup reasons.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Create an Impress demo-file, save and close it.\n  \n*Go to the demo-file with the file explorer and do a right mouse click.\n  \n*Open the demo-file with an archive manager or any other zip-manager.\n  \n*Open the 'corrupt' file also with an archive manager.\n  \n*Copy the file 'mimetype' from the demo-file-archive into the corrupt-file-archive that you're trying to repair.\n  \n*Close the archives.\n  \n*Do a double click on the corrupt-file, it will ask to repair the corrupt-file in a slightly other way.\n  \n\nNow your file should open in the impress application. \n", "Q: How to associate file types with Sublime Text 2?

It might work if I hard-code my username and export the default DISPLAY :0 in these scripts, but that feels like a very ugly hack.\nScripts in ~/.config/autostart/xyz.desktop run after login, but they don't run after merely unlocking the screen after resume.\nIs there a way to run scripts after unlocking the screen after a resume?\n\nA: It looks like you have to hard code the username in the previous answer anyways, so here's a simple script for in /etc/pm/sleep.d if anyone is looking for a quick fix:\n#!/bin/bash \ncase \"$1\" in\n    hibernate|suspend)\n        sudo -u USERNAME env DISPLAY=:0 zenity --info --text \"do stuff on suspend\"\n        ;;\n    thaw|resume)\n        sudo -u USERNAME env DISPLAY=:0 zenity --info --text \"do stuff on resume\"\n        ;;\nesac\n\n\nA: This question at the Unix & Linux site documents an alternative approach using dbus messages:\ndbus-monitor --session \"type='signal',interface='org.gnome.ScreenSaver'\" | \\\n( while true; do\n    read X;\n    if echo $X | grep \"boolean true\" &> /dev/null; then\n        SCREEN_LOCKED;\n    elif echo $X | grep \"boolean false\" &> /dev/null; then\n        SCREEN_UNLOCKED;\n        fi\ndone )\n\n(Replace SCREEN_LOCKED and SCREEN_UNLOCKED with the actions you want to perform.)\nUsing xrandr 1>/dev/null 2>1 as the action on unlocking fixed my problem that monitor resolutions/positions were not being correctly restored on screen unlocking (xrandr seems to cause a re-reading of screen settings). I added this line as a background task in my .bash_profile (strictly it might be better as a desktop file in ~/.config/autostart, since that only runs when you start gnome):\ndbus-monitor --session \"type='signal',interface='org.gnome.ScreenSaver'\" | \\\n( while true; do\n    read X;\n    if echo $X | grep \"boolean false\" &> /dev/null; then\n        xrandr 1>/dev/null 2>1;\n        fi\ndone ) &\n\nFurther background on the gnome-screensaver API can be found at this site, and on the dbus monitor here.\n\nA: One solution is a script which runs when logging into the desktop, and which catches dbus messages. After resume from suspend the screen is locked, and after entering the password, there is an Unlock event on dbus.\n(Thanks to Kim SJ for putting me on the right track. I have no ScreenSaver signals, but found another interface to use).\nIn ~/.config/autostart/, I have a .desktop file which starts a bash script:\n$ cat ~/.config/autostart/mymonitor.desktop\n[Desktop Entry]\nCategories=System;Monitor;\nComment=Monitor dbus for unlock signals\nExec=/usr/local/bin/unlock_monitor\nName=unlock_monitor\nType=Application\n\nThe unlock_monitor monitor script reads dbus messages from com.canonical.Unity.Session and does stuff on Unlocked signals:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ndbus-monitor --session \"type=signal,interface=com.canonical.Unity.Session\" --profile \\\n| while read dbusmsg; do\n    if [[ \"$dbusmsg\" =~ Unlocked$ || \"$dbusmsg\" =~ NameAcquired$ ]] ; then\n        sleep 5\n        notify-send \"$(basename $0)\" \"Unlocked or freshly logged in...\"\n        # ...\n    fi\ndone\n\nWhen logging in, there is no \"Unlocked\" signal, but there is a \"NameAcquired\" signal when dbus-monitor starts.\n\nA: You can run a script using start-stop-daemon. start-stop-daemon can fork the thread running as different uid and gid, hence solving your problem.\nWhat you need to do is to write a job script placed in system PATH like /usr/bin, and to create an extra daemon script in /etc/pm/sleep.d. Matching pm-suspend action like resume or thaw the daemon script commits the job script via \nstart-stop-daemon --start $ARGs --name nm-rtvt--exec /usr/bin/job_script\n\nwhere ARGs could be --chuid 1001:1001 or just --user your_username.\nAnd for integrity, you might as well want the daemon script to stop the damon named nm-rtvt before suspend via\nstart-stop-daemon --stop <...>\n\nmatching pm-suspend actions like suspend or hibernate.\nFor details, man start-stop-daemon. And there are many other examples in /etc/init.d of daemon scripts.\n", "Q: upgrade broke in the middle - how to verify?

I followed the step-by-step article here: UEFI/EFK2 . Everything works nice until I need to actually build it. At the paragraph 'Building MdeModulePkg module package' the description says: Just type build:\nbash$ build\n\nbut my Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS says:\nNo command 'build' found, did you mean:\n Command 'xbuild' from package 'mono-xbuild' (main)\n Command 'guild' from package 'guile-2.0-libs' (universe)\n Command 'sbuild' from package 'sbuild' (universe)\n Command 'bwild' from package 'bacula-director-common' (main)\n Command 'buildd' from package 'buildd' (universe)\nbuild: command not found\n\nMaybe someone knows where exactly I can find this mysterious command?\n\nA: The solution is to use\nbash:~/src/edk2$ source edksetup.sh\n\nbash:~/src/edk2$ build\n\nThe effect of export command inside edksetup.sh is not reflected in the main bash shell but rather in the sub-shell spawned for executing it. \"source\" directs it to run the script in current shell.\n\nA: As long as you have installed the build dependencies and followed the guide exactly, I think you just need to make sure you are in the edk2 directory when you issue the build command. If you enter the build command when you are in any other directory you will get the error that you received.\nAlso, the build command will only work if you have run edksetup.sh and edited the correct build parameters into  ~/src/edk2/Conf/target.txt (or whatever your path is). \nHere is the initial output of the build command when run from the edk2 directory (with files tweaked as per the guide):\nmik@Acer ~/src/edk2$ build\nBuild environment: Linux-3.2.0-32-generic-i686-with-Ubuntu-12.04-precise\nBuild start time: 00:45:15, Oct.22 2012\n\nWORKSPACE        = /home/mike/src/edk2\nECP_SOURCE       = /home/mike/src/edk2/EdkCompatibilityPkg\nEDK_SOURCE       = /home/mike/src/edk2/EdkCompatibilityPkg\nEFI_SOURCE       = /home/mike/src/edk2/EdkCompatibilityPkg\nEDK_TOOLS_PATH   = /home/mike/src/edk2/BaseTools\n\nArchitecture(s)  = IA32\nBuild target     = DEBUG\nToolchain        = GCC46\n\nActive Platform          = /home/mike/src/edk2/MdeModulePkg/MdeModulePkg.dsc\n\nProcessing meta-data ........... done!\n\nThen it proceeds to compile everything required. \n", "Q: Custom shortcut does't work!

Most UEFI computers provide relatively primitive options for switching between BIOS-mode and EFI-mode boots, although you can sometimes do so by pressing a key at boot time. (On my ASUS P8H77-I motherboard, it's F8.)\nIf you've got an EFI-mode Windows installation but you installed Ubuntu in BIOS mode, the better solution is to install an EFI-mode boot loader for Ubuntu. Replacing the grub-pc package with grub-efi should do the trick, except that to fully register the boot loader, Ubuntu has to be running in EFI mode, so you've got a chicken-and-the-egg problem. Since you've just installed, the easiest solution may be to re-install, but this time ensure that the installer is running in EFI mode. You can determine this by dropping to a shell and looking for the /sys/firmware/efi directory. If it's present, you booted in EFI mode; but if it's absent, you probably booted in BIOS mode. If you find that the installer is running in BIOS mode, reboot and look for those boot-time options (by using F8 or by adjusting your firmware options). Another way to gain better control of the boot process is by installing rEFInd, which is an EFI-mode boot manager that I maintain. Using its default settings, it should enable you to force an EFI-mode boot of the Ubuntu installer, provided the disc is inserted when you boot the computer. Version 0.4.6 can also switch to a BIOS-mode boot loader on many UEFI-based systems, although you must adjust the scanfor line in its refind.conf file. Using this ability, you might be able to chainload into your BIOS boot loader for Ubuntu. This might be acceptable to you, although IMHO it's simpler to boot directly in EFI mode.\n\nA: *\n\n*Run Boot-Repair from a liveCD or liveUSB\n\n*Click the Recommended Repair button\n\n*Reboot the computer.

You can boot off the LiveCD and try deleting the disk image on the drive, then try booting off the hard drive.  The VitualBox disk files can normally be found in ~/.VirtualBox/HardDisks (note dotfile and  capitalisation).  Another place that Virtual Disks are stored is '~/VitualBox VMs' depending on whether you are running the opensource or PUEL version of VirtualBox.\nTo force the mount you may need to open a terminal window and type:\nsudo mount -t ext4 -o errors=continue /dev/sda6 /mnt\n\nThis will mount /dev/sda2 on /mnt in read/write mode.

(I'll try to write \"acpi=off\" instead, but I don't know if it works.)\nIn addition: Yesterday I found that before \"acpi=noirq quiet splash\" there is this text: \"ro\". When I removed that, everything worked perfectly and I were able to boot normally. Today I did it again, but it didn't work. I also noticed that \"acpi=noirq quiet splash\" is repeated, and there is a meaningless mix of numbers and letters at the end of two lines and before \"root=(something like UUID)=\". \n\nA: More information about this issue you can find at Launchpad Bug #1048141.\n", "Q: How do I mount a hibernated NTFS partition? I have a Windows HDD attached to an external docking bay on my Ubuntu System, but the HDD brings up an error message:\n\nError mounting: mount exited with exit code 14: Windows is hibernated, refused to mount.\n  Failed to mount '/dev/sda5': Operation not permitted\n  The NTFS partition is hibernated. Please resume and shutdown Windows\n  properly, or mount the volume read-only with the 'ro' mount option, or\n  mount the volume read-write with the 'remove_hiberfile' mount option.\n  For example type on the command line:  \n       mount -t ntfs-3g -o remove_hiberfile /dev/sda5 /media/92441EC8441EAF4B  \n\n\nI am at a loss for exactly how to remove the hiberfile, or even mount it as read-only or read-write. I tried directly copy and pasting that exact command into my terminal, but it said:\nmount:only root can do that\n\nI do not know what to do at this point. I do need to get the information off of this drive, but I do not have a computer to put it in. Does anyone know what I should do from here?\n\nA: You need to use sudo before the command it gave you. So typing the following in a terminal should work.\nBig Disclaimer:\nRunning this will delete the hibernation file, which as I understand it will not damage Windows, but will delete any hibernated session that you have saved. If you were working on something in Windows that you did not save before you hibernated you will lose your work if you run this command!\nIf you understand the above, the command you should run is:\nsudo mount -t ntfs-3g -o remove_hiberfile /dev/sda2 /media/FE46D60C46D5C615\n\n\nA: Enter the following commands:\nsudo mkdir /mnt/spider \nsudo mount -t ntfs-3g -o remove_hiberfile /dev/sda2 /mnt/spider\n\nRemember to replace the drives name from /dev/sda2 to yours.\nYou can find the name of your drives by using the command sudo fdisk -l .\n\nA: The main answer is very simple: You'll have to run the command as root. As such, you'll have to add sudo in front of the command (sudo mount ... - replacing mount ... by the command you're prompted to execute).\nHowever, what you want to do is mount as read-only, as you only want to retrieve the information. Removing the hiberfile is dangerous, if you ever plan on using the Windows installation that placed the hiberfile again. You would prefer to use the -r option (sudo mount -r /dev/sda2) to force read-only mode.\nWhich mounts the drive as read only. This prevents you from writing to the drive, and thus prevents you from changing what might be actively used by another OS, which in turn might corrupt the entire other OS upon reboot.\n", "Q: ubuntu hardware somehow related to windows i just upgraded to ubuntu 12.10 and i noticed a very strange behavior.

My repository is hosted in Github, and I have the a key for my desktop. Whenever I do either \"git pull\" or \"git push,\" a dialog box will pop up asking for my passphrase. This works fine if I type the passphrase correctly. However, if I'm connected to my desktop through ssh and do a git pull or push, the command does not prompt the passphrase and it outputs the following error: \nPermission denied (publickey).\nfatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly\n\nThis error makes sense because I'm not inputting my passphrase. So the question is, how can I get the passphrase prompted in the terminal?\nThanks!\n\nA: I think I figured it out. After running ssh -vT git@github.com, I noticed how my key was not being included in the list of keys that were being tried for authentication:\ndebug1: Trying private key: /home/***/.ssh/id_rsa\ndebug1: Trying private key: /home/***/.ssh/id_dsa\ndebug1: Trying private key: /home/***/.ssh/id_ecdsa\ndebug1: No more authentication methods to try.\n\nI figured that somehow I needed to tell ssh to use my specific key when connecting to github.com. I added a github entry in my ~/.ssh/config file\nHost github.com\n    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_github.pub\n\nAfter doing that, the ssh command and the git push/pull commands ask for my passphrase in the terminal and connect successfully. I still don't know why when the command is run from the desktop, the dialog box for the correct key comes up. Does anybody know why this works?\nThanks!\n\nA: If you want to push/pull to git on a machine that you're connected to via ssh, using the ssh version of the git protocol, you can do it one of two ways:\n1) Do not forward the agent (ssh -A) when connecting to the machine, and ensure the key you want to use is on the host you're connecting to, and ssh is looking for it. You can do this with the IdentifyFile option for a Host in the ssh config file. Note you should point at the private key file, and not the public key file.\n2) Forward the agent with ssh -A when connecting to the host you wish to use git on, and ensure the private key is available on the client machine you're connecting from, and that ssh can find it.\nFor slightly more security, you can use a different key from each machine, and add the public keys for the keys you're using for github, for each machine, to your github account. This way, if one key is compromised, you only need to replace it in one place, rather than trying to make sure you have the same keys everywhere.\n", "Q: Trying to do a batch rename, can't figure out the proper RegEx I'm trying to rename my movie collection. All of the files are currently named using dots instead of spaces, i.e. Men.in.Black.avi. I want to replace all of the dots with spaces which isn't terribly difficult, but I need to preserve the last dot for the file extension, i.e. .avi, .mp4, .ogg, etc.\nMy Googling has provided no solutions. I'm also a Javascript developer  and could see some snazzy applications for it. So, any suggestions?\n\nA: One way would be to use the Perl rename utility. The Perl regex \\.(?=.*\\.) matches a dot only when there is another dot later.\nrename 's/\\.(?=.*\\.)/ /g' *.*.*\n\nIf you want to act on files in subdirectories as well:\nshopt -s globstar    # you can put this in your ~/.bashrc\nrename 's/\\.(?=.*\\.)/ /g' **/*.*.*\n\nThis works assuming you don't have dots in your directory names. Otherwise I think the simplest method would be to use find:\nfind -depth -name '*.*.*' -exec rename 's/\\.(?=.*\\.)/ /g' {} +\n\nAlternatively, using zsh (this only renames regular files and leaves directory names alone, due to the glob qualifier (.) at the end):\nautoload zmv    # you can put this in your ~/.zshrc\nzmv -Q '(**/)(*.*)(.[^.]##)(.)' '$1${2//./ }$3'\n\n\nA: While writing this question it occurred to me that I hadn't checked the Ubuntu Software Center. I found an app, pyRenamer, which did a fantastic job of accomplishing my task. I ended up just changing all of the dots to spaces, then changing all instances of the file extensions that were preceded by a space, i.e. \" avi\", \" mp4\", \" ogg\", to replace the spaces with dots. This isn't the best option as there could be a movie with avi or ogg in the title which would be a major pain in the bum, but it did the trick this time.\nI'm still interested in the simpler RegEx solution.\n\nA: cd $movielibrary\nrename -n 's/\\./ /g;s/ ([^ ]*$)/.$1/' *\n\nDoes it look good? Rerun the last command without -n.     \n", "Q: How to disable uefi variables I need to disable uefi variables when booting from live usb. How do I do this?\nI think that this is done through setting noefi, so if this is the right approach, how do I do this? I've tried from grub-edit like when temporarily setting nomodeset, but it didn't change anything.\n\nA: Why do you need to disable EFI variables? There may be another way to accomplish your ultimate goal without messing with the EFI variables.\nThe noefi kernel option should indeed disable the EFI variables. If you've only tried it once, you might try it again; perhaps you mistyped it. I just tried on an Ubuntu 12.04 installation in VirtualBox, and noefi disabled the EFI variables support for me. (efibootmgr no longer worked and /sys/firmware/efi was missing.) You might also try placing it somewhere else amidst the kernel's options.\nAnother option is to boot using a BIOS-mode boot loader rather than an EFI-mode boot loader. If the USB device you're using is an Ubuntu installer, I believe it includes both types of boot loaders, so you should be able to use your firmware's boot option or possibly rEFInd 0.4.6 or later to select your boot mode. If you're using a custom USB flash drive, you'll need to install a BIOS version of GRUB manually.\nA final option might be to remove the efivars kernel module, as in rmmod efivars, after booting. I tried to test this, but my test system uses a custom kernel with that module compiled in directly rather than as a module, so I can't guarantee that you'll be able to remove that module.\n\nA: Either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable it from GRUB via the noefi kernel option\n\n*or make your firmware (BIOS) boot the USB in Legacy mode.\n\n*or use an ISO which is not EFI-compatible. Eg, Ubuntu32bit cannot boot in UEFI mode.\n\n", "Q: mod_rewrite not working after upgrade to 12.10 I'm hoping this is a quick and simple fix and that I just need a fresh set of eyes. However, I'm fearful that it might actually be an error in the latest build of the rewrite module.\nI have a .htaccess file that turns on the rewrite engine (I've made sure the module is enabled), creates some rewrite conditions, and finally a rewrite rule. Here's my .htaccess file for reference:\n<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>\n    RewriteEngine on\n\n    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\n    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d\n\n    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?request=$1 [L,QSA,NC]\n</IfModule>\n\nNow for the problem: if I go to hostname.com it works fine. If I go to hostname.com/Index it works fine. However, if I go to hostname.com/index it doesn't rewrite the request and I get a 404. I'm not sure what's going on here. I've used a rewrite rule tester and there doesn't appear to be any issues with my rewrite rule itself.\nAgain, this issue didn't manifest until after I upgraded to 12.10, at which point I know that Apache was updated.\nAny thoughts? Has anyone else here experienced this? I know that two other people besides myself have experienced this here.\nThanks in advance for any help you can provide!\n\nA: I was able to fix this issue. All I had to do was edit my virtual host and remove \"Multiviews\" from my options.\nOld:\nOptions Indexes FollowSymLinks Multiviews\n\nNew:\nOptions Indexes FollowSymLinks\n\nAnd then it worked!\n", "Q: \"ImportError: No module named XKit.xutils\" while removing nvidia-current My PC shuts down while upgrading from 12.04 to 12.10.\nEverything seems to work but I can't install the missing updates.

Since you are logging on in LightDM and not yet known, the system can not display files which are limited access. \nTo make a file accessible for the LightDM screen, right-click on the file in Nautilus and select Properties, then Permissions and make sure \"Access\" is not set to \"None\" for \"Group\" or \"Others\".\n\nAlso note that the LightDM background defaults to the background of whatever user is highlighted in the log in space.\n\nA: There's another thing to keep in mind. If the picture is not located in your ~/Pictures folder, it will not work. Not even if you put it in a sub-directory of that folder.\nI tried a lot of different possibilities, and the only one that works is to give both group and others at least Read-only access, place the image in your Pictures folder and change your background, selecting the Pictures folder from the dropdown box.\nLogout, et voila, there's your background.\n\nA: Sorry it has been a while..

I'm running into issues where if I have two applications running, where one is smaller and in the foreground, and I click on the window in the background, it does not move into the foreground. For example, if I have a terminal window on top of Firefox, and I click on the webpage in the background, Firefox gains focus but the terminal is still visible on top of Firefox. Is there a way to change this setting so that clicked on applications are always on top?\nNote: If I click on the title bar, the application does in fact move to the top (in front of the terminal for instance).\n\nA: I believe the options for what I want to happen are selected, but for some reason unity doesn't use them properly (this may have something to do with upgrading from 12.04 instead of using a clean install). I had this problem with alt+click after upgrading, even though I changed the setting so it worked on 12.04. I went into the dconf editor, twiddled some settings but ultimately didn't change them, and now clicking on a window works as expected.\nsudo apt-get install dconf-editor\n\nNow run dconf Editor, and navigate to the relevant settings:\norg->gnome->desktop->wm->preferences\n\nNow change \"focus mode\" and \"raise-on-click\" to something and then set them back to default.\n\nA: Maybe you've that application fixed in the top layer. I do not exactly know how to put back in the same layer as the other applications because I'm using LXDE and not Gnome. But I guess in Gnome it can be done the same way. You can achieve the menu by right clicking on the title bar.\n\n", "Q: sound stops working after a while in ubuntu 12.10 i did a clean install on ubuntu 12.10.

You can edit the postinstall file and run apt-get install -f to clean error messages.\nSee this article:\nCitrixICAClientHowTo - Community Ubuntu Documentation: Citrix ICA Client 12 on Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit\nParticulary this excerpt:\n\nBeware - this should be used with caution as it will install with an error. The postinst script exits 2 as it fails to correctly determine the architecture of the system. The ICAClient package will function, but APT will complain that ICAClient is \"not fully installed or removed\" and you will get errors each time you use a package manager.\nThis can be fixed by unpacking the deb and editing the regular expression in line 2648 of the postinst script to match x86_64. Then rebuild the deb and it should install without a problem.\nAlternatively /var/lib/dpkg/info/icaclient.postinst can be edited after an installation that gives an error and apt-get -f install can be run afterwards.\n\n\nA: icaclient will throw errors that it failed to install when it installed correctly. I installed it just fine using the Ubuntu Software Center, it worked although it still said install failed.\n\nA: I needed to use a patched installation package, check out this:\ndpkg reports error on package icaclient\nI opened a forum thread on Ubuntu Forums to get more hints and tips to get it work:\n\nA: The following worked for me on 12.10 (32 bit).

If possible, could anyone explain the benefits of Ubuntu's six month release cycle? I can think of some benefits like to provide users with a release without bugs from previous one and updated software but nothing else. Maybe, to know how long which release must be supported is another reason.\nThank you in advance.\n\nA: It's important to fully understand the mentality behind the 6 month release cycle, once you do it makes perfect sense.\nThere are many benefits to the 6 month release cycle. But in general, these restrictions are in place to serve as a commitment to quality, and to keep the project goal oriented. Now as I was saying about the mentality behind the decisions. As the Ubuntu website says: \n\nAs an analogy, consider a play being produced in a theatre. While things may go wrong during production, even (perhaps especially) on the night, tickets have been sold and there is a very high cost to backing out: \"the show must go on\". \n\nA roughly 6-month release cycle allows them to coordinate development of the features that have actually been implemented, allowing them to maintain the quality of the overall release without delaying everything because of one or two features. Updates to programs and projects come out constantly, if they kept on waiting to implement features, we would never see a new Ubuntu release. Setting a specific date insures that they plan responsibly.\nThe 6 month limit was chosen because that is the release cycle the Gnome project uses. Gnome is what Ubuntu is built on, so naturally they follow their release cycle: https://live.gnome.org/ReleasePlanning/TimeBased\nYou can read all about it on their Wiki, it is a VERY interesting read and helps one understand it all, read HERE.\n\nUbuntu releases are challenging because they represent an aggregation of the work of thousands of independent software projects. We feel that a time-based release process enables us to provide our users with the best balance of the latest software, tight integration, and excellent overall quality.  - Ubuntu Wiki\n\nIn conclusion, keep in mind that there are projects that are planned to be completed over multiple releases. Not everything is a 6 month affair. Also, if you stick to LTS release, you will get a more solid and bug free experience. A lot of people only use LTS, meaning it's more of a 2 year release cycle. From 8.04 to 10.04, and from 10.04 to 12.04, there were massive differences.\n\nA: It allows developers to test new ideas, while maintaining the same base core, reliable and solid. You get new \"clothes\", but on the same body. This will help in later developments.\n", "Q: How to install Diablo 2 Lord of Destruction? I first tried to install Diablo 2 LOD from an iso image using acetone iso. However, after acetone iso mounted the image, it said \"Please install the labelled disc\". \nI then tried with Gmount, and, following advice I received from some forums, I attempted to create mount points and then install; after it mounted the image, it installed the first three disc images but not the expansion. \nWhen I tried to play, it told me to insert the labelled disc, even though the iso image was still mounted with Gmount. How can I resolve this problem?\n\nA: In order to configure Diablo II to read the CD, you have to change Wine propierties (I assume that you are using Wine because it is impossible otherwise) and change the letter of the CD drive linking it to the iso mounted.\nIf not, use another .exe to run the program ;)\n\nA: Install PlayOnLinux and use that, It even comes with it's own wine bottle system, similar to Crossover. It makes it easy to edit the registry for better performance, and it even comes with nifty installation scripts. I also use furius iso mount, to mount my isos. It's in the USC.\n\nA: From what I've read about Diablo it's not designed to run on linux-based operating systems like Ubuntu, however, you can probably run it if a .exe or .msi file is available for its installation by use of wine. \n\nA: Open winecfg. Go to Drives tab, there you should map path of your mount point to correct drive (D:).\n\nA: According to WineHQ you should be able to run it.\nSo you should install, open terminal and type:\nsudo apt-get install wine\n\nLet the installer finish installing Wine.\nAnd now you can insert the dialbo disk and run the .exe\nAnd if you legally bought Diablo 2 LOD you should have a downloadable alternative on battle.net, which should not ask for a cd when installed.\nAnd you could always download a crack, desperate times ask for desperate solutions.\n\nWine folders:\n  Wine installation:\n  Wine will now install diablo 2 to it's \"c\" drive, which is located in\n  your home folder with the name \".wine\".

In your xorg.0.log, you will probably have a similar error as this:\nAIGLX: Screen 0 is not DRI2 capable\nAIGLX: Screen 0 is not DRI capable\n\nThis means that DRI is disabled: DRI is known as Direct Rendering Infrastructure and is the rendering standard used on Linux based systems for 3D acceleration by such means as opengl. However, the open source driver does not support it and there are unfortunately no proprietary drivers for the SiS hardware: the source code and specifications have never been released. \nThomas Winischofer was the man who thankfully contributed the code so that SiS adapters can actually work in Linux based systems; his site is here and contains useful technical information and he particularly mentions here that\n\nThere is no DRI/OpenGL/3D support for the SiS 6326, 5597/5598, 530/620, 315, 550, 650, 651, 740, 330, 661, 741, 760, 761 including all model variations with letters in the model number.\n\nAgain, at the freedesktop site it is noted that there are no available DRI drivers for your model unfortunately. It is seen as a wishlist item rather than a bug at Launchpad because it won't be worked on by the Ubuntu developers, but it is up to those at the dri project and others. However it is very unlikely that a suitable driver will be produced because the source code has never been released by SiS.\n", "Q: Can I use my old home partition and just format the root partition when installing Ubuntu? I installed Ubuntu's root on one partition and /home on another.

Next to update your sources list open up the Terminal and type:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nOnce your sources list has been updated you can install either the stable 1.4 Wine package or the 1.5 development package using the following commands:\nWine 1.4 (stable)\nsudo apt-get install wine1.4\n\nWine 1.5 (development)\nsudo apt-get install wine1.5\n\nThat’s all there is to it, you will now also continue to get the latest Wine releases and updates on your Linux, enjoy!\nsource of the solution\n\nanother solution: How do I resolve unmet dependencies after adding a PPA?\n\nA: I've been having the same issue, it turns out that with newer versions of apt and dpkg they support a feature called \"Multi-arch\". In simple terms, you can specify that apt pulls package info from repositories for architectures other than the native install, and install multiarch compatible packages from those repos.\nFor more detailed information, see:\nhttp://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch/HOWTO\nYour issue specifically, is that the wine1.5-i386 is in the 32 bit wine repository, but not in the 64 bit repo, and your dpkg/apt are not configured to deal with this for some reason. To resolve:\nCheck your native architecture with:\nsudo dpkg --print-architecture #in your case this should return 'amd64'\n\nOther available architectures can be shown by:\nsudo dpkg --print-foreign-architectures #in your case this should not return anything\n\nSo you need to configure a new foreign architecture (quantal/12.10 or newer***):\nsudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\n\nCheck your new arch is now available, update and install your package with apt:\nsudo dpkg --print-foreign-architectures #now this should return 'i386'\nsudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install wine1.5 #and away you go!\n\n=======\n***Note that the Ubuntu dpkg in natty (1.16.0~ubuntu7 (reports 1.15.8.10)), oneiric and precise (1.16.1.2ubuntu7) uses a different syntax:*\necho \"foreign-architecture i386\" > /etc/dpkg.cfg.d/architectures\n\n\nA: This is an error when trying to install the i386 package on a 64 bit install.\ntry following this guide for your system!\nhttp://wiki.winehq.org/WineOn64bit#head-77def7ca75193f24e358dba3dd6bcf674bd61b37\nI know this because this is what I had originally done.\n\nA: It's not installable, because it depends on i386 architecture which isn't there in your system.\nTo add it, try:\nsudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\n\nupdate your apt repositories:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nand install wine again:\nsudo apt-get install wine\n\nAlternatively you can --force-architecture by using dpkg.\n\nA: First I recommanded to remove wine with configuration files\nsudo apt-get  --purge wine*\n\nUpdate system and upgrade packages, Fix dependency\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install -f \n\nRemove Unnecessary packages if any\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nNow Install wine \nsudo apt-get install wine1.4\n\nClen cache\nsudo apt-get clean\n\n", "Q: How do I use LVM with 12.10 when I already have Windows 8? I asked about the best way to setup a PC with Windows 7, Windows 8 and Ubuntu 12.10 here and followed the recommended order. But when I try to install Ubuntu 12.10 it doesn't allow me to select LVM without blowing away the Windows 8 installation. If I select the advanced option I can't create another partition (there's room on the drive). Is WUBI the only option? Or do I need to setup the partition before running the Ubuntu installer?\n(Not sure how to get screenshots from the installer)\n\nA: I would start out by doing all the partitioning from the Ubuntu live CD. Then install Windows 7 (using the existing partition scheme), add Windows 8, and finally add Ubuntu.\nFor Ubuntu I would create two partitions: /boot and LVM. Then follow the advice in How to install ubuntu 12.10 with / partition on LVM? when you come to install Ubuntu.\nThe physical partitions will be Windows' two “system reserved” partitions plus /boot; the remaining partitions can (I hope) be logical partitions.\n\nA: Seems like you don't want to use the \"Something Else\" option in the installer, but I recommend you do.\nI recommend using gparted to build your partitioning scheme the way you want it, and after that use the ubuntu installer option \"something else\" and appoint those partitions you created for specific mount points (/, /home, /boot, etc.; also: swap)\nsee this question\nThe only difficulty here is that you'll need to make your own plan for the partitioning.\nIf you're using MBR/legacy mode, and both win7 and win8 need a \"system-reserved\" partition for booting, and if both windows's C: partitions must be primary, you have a problem. I don't know if grub's bootloader will be able to find a /boot partition on a lvm.\nIf win7 and win8 can both have their C: partition be logical, install them like that first:\n\n\n*\n*system-reserved partitions for win7 and win8: primary\n\n*C: partitions for win7 and win8: logical\n\nthen ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n*/boot: primary\n\n*/, /home, swap, etc.: logical\n\notherwise it won't work with MBR/legacy mode due to the limit of 4 (primary) partitions\n", "Q: SSH Public Key - No supported authentication methods available (server sent public key) I have a 12.10 server setup in a virtual machine with its network set to bridged (essentially will be seen as a computer connected to my switch).\nI installed opensshd via apt-get and was able to connect to the server using putty with my username and password.\nI then set about trying to get it to use public/private key authentication. I did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Generated the keys using PuttyGen.\n\n*Moved the public key to /etc/ssh/myusername/authorized_keys (I am using encrypted home directories).\n\n*Set up sshd_config like so:\nPubkeyAuthentication yes\nAuthorizedKeysFile /etc/ssh/%u/authorized_keys\nStrictModes no\nPasswordAuthentication no\nUsePAM yes\n\nWhen I connect using putty or WinSCP, I get an error saying No supported authentication methods available (server sent public key).\nIf I run sshd in debug mode, I see:\nPAM: initializing for \"username\"\nPAM: setting PAM_RHOST to \"192.168.1.7\"\nPAM: setting PAM_TTY to \"ssh\"\nuserauth-request for user username service ssh-connection method publickey [preauth]\nattempt 1 failures 0 [preauth]\ntest whether pkalg/pkblob are acceptable [preauth[\nChecking blacklist file /usr/share/ssh/blacklist.RSA-1023\nChecking blacklist file /etc/ssh/blacklist.RSA-1023\ntemporarily_use_uid: 1000/1000 (e=0/0)\ntrying public key file /etc/ssh/username/authorized_keys\nfd4 clearing O_NONBLOCK\nrestore_uid: 0/0\nFailed publickey for username from 192.168.1.7 port 14343 ssh2\nReceived disconnect from 192.168.1.7: 14: No supported authentication methods available [preauth]\ndo_cleanup [preauth]\nmonitor_read_log: child log fd closed\ndo_cleanup\nPAM: cleanup\n\nWhy is this happening and how can I fix this?\n\nA: SOLVED:\n\n*\n\n*You need to download the puttyGEN and generate a public and a private key.\n\n*I've assigned a password to my private key.\n\n*then configure the private key in putty. Putty->SSH->Auth->Browse to your private.\n\n*You need to configure the public key on the server. (In my case I've talked with the server guy and asked if he could add my public key to the server). You need the public key in the other side (server) the connection.\n\n\nA: In my case the reason was that private key file (.ppk) had been removed in Putty authentication agent i.e. Pageant. I just updated it again to Pageant there and connection worked perfectly after that. \n\nA: *\n\n*Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file.\n\n*Change PasswordAuthentication and ChallengeResponseAuthentication to yes.  \n\n\n3a. Restart ssh /etc/init.d/ssh restart.\n   OR\n3b. better you use service sshd restart\n\nA: Just a tip I hope may help someone else with the headaches I had. F21 is right that you need to copy the key out of the PuTTYGen window instead of saving the file, but after copying, the way you paste may have significant impact on whether your key will work or not. Some editors will alter the text as you paste, or do something with newlines or something that makes the authorized_keys file invalid.\nWhat I have found to be the least likely to break is to echo the full string and redirect the output to the file.  Right-clicking in PuTTY to paste the key string to the commandline, it works out like this (with the example given above):\necho [right-click-to-paste-here] > /etc/ssh/username/authorized_keys\n\nYou'll end up with this:\necho ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABJQAAAIEAhGF6GIuMY8FJ1+CNApnSY1N2YSlkYz72Yvwua6N1nFpBklz1+dsIMg4rcTLcF34M/tW5Yz+NUDAw2AEbxQ32FPgw7sAOIXktkYOHtr7mmimiTjkoSCrJh1kqalPSpi8rglT/Bp67Ql2SZwvUFfMzHISryR0EZC4rXP/uvObrJe8= rsa-key-20121022 > /etc/ssh/username/authorized_keys\n\nAnother advantage of this method is that you can add multiple keys this way by using >> to append instead of > to overwrite, eg:\necho ssh-rsa AAAAB3<...snip...>rJe8= rsa-key-20121022 >> /etc/ssh/username\n\nHope that helps someone.\n\nA: We were already using the right type of key (ppk instead of pem).\nIn our case, it was a problem with the file permissions for authorized_keys on the server user folder. It has to be -rw-r--r-- ... It was -rw-rw-r--.\nSSH is very finicky about file perms.\nCheck file permissions using:\nls -l authorized_keys\n\nYou can fix them if necessary with:\nchmod 644 authorized_keys\n\n\nA: Problem solved:\nLooks like there was a problem with my public key file. PuttyGen will create a public key file that looks like:\n---- BEGIN SSH2 PUBLIC KEY ----\nComment: \"rsa-key-20121022\"\nAAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABJQAAAIEAhGF6GIuMY8FJ1+CNApnSY1N2YSlkYz72Yvwu\na6N1nFpBklz1+dsIMg4rcTLcF34M/tW5Yz+NUDAw2AEbxQ32FPgw7sAOIXktkYOH\ntr7mmimiTjkoSCrJh1kqalPSpi8rglT/Bp67Ql2SZwvUFfMzHISryR0EZC4rXP/u\nvObrJe8=\n---- END SSH2 PUBLIC KEY ----\n\nHowever, this will not work, so what you need to do is to open the key in PuttyGen, and then copy it from there (this results in the key being in the right format and in 1 line):\nssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABJQAAAIEAhGF6GIuMY8FJ1+CNApnSY1N2YSlkYz72Yvwua6N1nFpBklz1+dsIMg4rcTLcF34M/tW5Yz+NUDAw2AEbxQ32FPgw7sAOIXktkYOHtr7mmimiTjkoSCrJh1kqalPSpi8rglT/Bp67Ql2SZwvUFfMzHISryR0EZC4rXP/uvObrJe8= rsa-key-20121022\n\nPaste this into authorized_keys then it should work.\n", "Q: Can I install Windows Drivers in Ubuntu I do not know if the proper drivers are install because the system has a lot of lag and crashes at times.

From my understanding, what I need is a non-live CD installation which most creator that I found on the internet is unable to provide.\n\nA: That's not virtualization. What you're describing is installing Ubuntu on a USB stick, which is quite possible. (I have done this successfully, and in fact was running Ubuntu off a USB hard disk for about a year.)\nTo do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy anything you want to keep off the USB disk.\n\n*Run the Ubuntu live CD, plug in your USB disk, and start the Ubuntu installer.\n\n*At the partitioning step, tell it to install to the USB drive (likely /dev/sdb, assuming you have 1 internal hard disk).\n\n*Install. Tell it to install the bootloader only on the USB drive, and not on the internal hard drive (which would trash the computer's OS installation).\n\n*Reboot.

Windows 7 started giving me a lot of problems lately and I've been wanting to try Ubuntu for awhile, so I got Linux Live USB Creator and the Ubuntu ISO. I didn't have any USBs or blank CDs, so I made it boot from my extra D drive. Now when I turn on my computer, it automatically boots into Ubuntu for some reason and I have no option to get back into Windows. I can press shift on the grub and get into the thing that say boot: but I don't know what to type to make Windows boot. \nI'd be fine with not getting back into Windows if Ubuntu would install, but it gives me an error every time I try to install it, so I assume doing it from the CD drive just isn't going to work or something and I need to get back into Windows and undo what I did to my D drive and wait until I get a USB to do it with. But the first problem I have to deal with is how am I supposed to get back into Windows? Right now I can't get into any OS except for Ubuntu's Live Version.\nThanks for any help you can give me.\nEDIT: I don't think my computer even recognizes Windows 7 is on it any longer. When Ubuntu tries to install, I don't get the \"Install Alongside Windows 7\" or \"Replace Windows 7 with Ubuntu\" (not the exact wording, I know) options, Windows 7 doesn't show up anywhere at all. It's just gone. And I don't see a second hard drive in my laptop, so I think maybe I changed the hard drive itself to an Ubuntu ISO installer. I'm really not sounding like the brightest person right now, I know. When I click on \"OS\" in Ubuntu Live Version, though, it still has all the Windows files and all the folders from my old C drive from Windows 7. I really don't know what's going on. At this point it looks like the only plausible option is to just take this hard drive out and replace with with a hard drive from my other laptop. \n\nA: This is weird . Are you sure you didn't install completely Ubuntu in the drive ? \nThe only thing I can imaging is the BIOS. Hold down the key during PC boot, to go into BIOS configuration page (in my laptop is F2 , maybe is Del or F10) and search for \"Device boot priority\" or \"Boot sequence\". See if your internal HDD (or the other HDD ,not the extra D drive) is placed first in boot. If not then change it, save and reboot.\nIf none of above works, then something else is going on and I suggest to boot into BIOS , place first BOOT the DVD and boot from the Windows DVD to repair the installation.\n", "Q: G5 quad core will not boot from Ubuntu CD I have a PPC G5 Quad Core with Leopard on one hard drive and I want to install Ubuntu on a second hard drive.

I would recommend first collecting some data checking with any sar data or using tools like iostats and vmstat to identify the loads and the times the freeze/hang occurs. You could possibly write a small cron job for this.\nex:\nsar -A 1 30 > /tmp/sar_-A.out.txt &\nvmstat 1 30 > /tmp/vmstat.out.txt &\niostat -tkx 1 30 > /tmp/iostat_-x.out.txt & \nps aufx > /tmp/ps_aux.out.txt &\nAlso get a kernel thread dump using: \"echo t | sudo tee /proc/sysrq-trigger\" as this would help in determining to some extent what the apache process is waiting for.\nAlternatively, you could get configure crashdump when your system is in a hung state and obtain a vmcore file, if you are more adventurous to do a dump analysis.  \n", "Q: Reliance net connect and ubuntu 12.04 I added recently purachased a reliance net connect broadband+.

When I inspected /dev/mapper from that shell (BusyBox built-in shell ash), it was empty.\nSince I overwrote my previous Ubuntu 12.04 installation, there was no windows MBR, and thus the grub installer did not create a windows option. To make sure I could boot at least something, I ran the windows recovery tool bootrec.exe /FixMbr. Now I have a totally inaccessible zombie-ubuntu on my disk :P\n\nA: I figured it out myself:\nI just tried again. The way I did it is first using gparted to create my partition scheme, and after that, I use the ubuntu installer and appoint the partitions I want to a specific mount points. Since this is exactly the way I did it the first time around, I don't know what made the installer change it's mind.\nImportant side-note: If you already have some version of Grub installed, and do not have the default windows MBR, the grub installer apparently does not detect your windows and thus it won't create a boot menu entry for it. So first restore your windows MBR. And eventually, don't forget to choose the right device (in my case a /dev/mapper/isw...Volume0) to write the mbr to.\n", "Q: Message indicator for liferea missing in Ubuntu 12.10?

In a very subjective way, because it is a subjective issue.\n12.04 is the LTS (long term support) version. I have excellent experience with LTS Ubuntu; my main workstation runs 10.04 LTS and I still do not see a reason to upgrade. Personally, I opt for 12.04. I'm old, and the time flows very quickly; I remember installing 10.04 as if it was yesterday. I don't want to fiddle with installations too often.\n12.10 will soon be replaced by another Ubuntu version, and will not be supported in the long run.

As an alternative you can install Kubuntu that is the KDE (Desktop Environment) specifically modified for Ubuntu, it looks a little like Windows.\n\nTo install Kubuntu (KDE + Ubuntu) type the following command at the Terminal:\n$ sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop\n\nIf you prefer a graphical interface to install it you can use Synaptic.\nBut the recommended way to do that is downloading the Kubuntu ISO. it's like downloading Ubuntu, but instead of using the Unity shell interface it will comes with KDE installed by default. To download the ISO file access Kubuntu.org to get more information about it.\n\nA: Getting Started:\n\n\n*\n\n*Re-theme to Windows 7 as per this AU Answer:\n\n*Complete the Vista transformation: Use this link and google translator\n\n\nA: If you like Vista's GUI, but don't want to leave Ubuntu then check out reference article with the links to skins, wallpapers, fonts and icons for making Ubuntu look like Vista. \n", "Q: What security exist when sharing files via an external USB drive? We have several external sources that send us data via an external hard drive. What security risks are we exposing ourselves to?\n\nA: Next to none, as long as you do not run any programs from these sources. \nThere is no autorun in Ubuntu, so drives attached to the system will not trigger execution of any executable files found on the drives. \nMoreover, the drives are automatically mounted for a given desktop user, which makes the scenario of automatic infection of the system unlikely, even in the case that a user runs one of the programs from the drive.\nOne can imagine the following scenario: someone hides an executable and calls it \"portrait.jpg\". The user opens the drive, ignores the fact that Nautilus indicates executable (rather than a jpeg), and when the binary asks for password, the user happily types in the password... \nWell, you can always make sure that mounting is done with the noexec bit. But then, what is to stop the user from copying data from the hard disk to home directory and running it?\n\nA: As far as I know, there is currently no generic malware targeting desktop Linux systems. However, it is definitely possible. An example has been shown by Jon Larimer at Shmoocon 2011.\nBy default, Ubuntu auto-mounts inserted USB drives and opens a Nautilus window to show the content. It may also generate thumbnails for pictures found on a drive.\nThis can be disabled, or it can be configured to do more automatically.\nIn Ubuntu 12.04 you want to check these options:\n\n\n*\n\n*System Settings: go to System / Details and check the actions for \"Removable Media\"; you may want to select \"Never prompt or start programs on media insertion\".\n\n*Nautilus preferences: the \"Behavior\" tab (the \"Executable text files\" part!)\n\n*Nautilus preferences: the \"Preview\" tab, and if paranoid, disable \"Show thumbnails\"\n\n\nYou can also check your settings from a command prompt:\ngconftool -S \"*autorun*\"\ngconftool -S \"*executable*\"\n\nIn short, apply the same precautions with Ubuntu as with Windows or Mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*disable all autorun mechanisms\n\n*don't give admin rights to normal users\n\n*educate the users to not click \"yes\" on messages they don't understand\n\n", "Q: Upgrade Ubuntu 12.04 to 12.10 failed \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I resolve unmet dependencies? \n\nI've a problem.

When I'm looking for articles with long names in Unity dash, I would like to have the full filename displayed instead of the current truncated view.  \nIt's difficult to find a specific article by searching on filters as it sometimes returns 10 or more results making it impossible, especially if you have a regular file naming convention e.g. YYYY-[Author Name]-Title\nDisplaying full document names similar to compact view of Nautilus would be helpful.\nIs there a way to do this?\n\nA: The answer appears to be No. Dash determines if you are using a desktop, laptop, or netbook, but after that the layout of the Dash results view is hardcoded. I saw no options available to change the layout or how it works.\nGiven the need to present a consistent appearance across platforms, especially phone and tablet, I can see how this is needed. I suspect such long file names would be a problem even for the equivalent of Nautilus compact view.\nBut you might file a bug report asking for the ability to see the full name in a tool tip or in the new preview view. \nAnother option would be to wrap a basic GUI, even something as simple as Zenity or Yad, or other GUI options using Python, Tcl/Tk, etc to create a simple way to browse and select these files.\n", "Q: gerrit push not working I tried executing the command git push gerrit HEAD: refs/for/BR_PS_1109\nIt gave the response: fatal: remote part of refspec is not a valid name in HEAD:\nGit remote version is also fine, as evident below:-\nvverma@l-vverma:~/git_repo/nextag$ git remote -v\ngerrit  ssh://vverma@gerrit.corp.nextag.com:29418/apps/nextag (fetch)\ngerrit  ssh://vverma@gerrit.corp.nextag.com:29418/apps/nextag (push)\norigin  git@ind-git.corp.nextag.com:apps/nextag (fetch)\norigin  git@ind-git.corp.nextag.com:apps/nextag (push)\n\n\nA: You have a space between HEAD: and refs/for/BR_PS_1109 which souldn't be there.

If not how should I format it and with what format?\nOnce I finish preparing the partition, how do I install Ubuntu on that partition? I'm not sure how to set up dual-boot Ubuntu and Windows.\n\nA: NTFS is not the right format for Ubuntu. The best course of action is to delete the 55GB partition in Windows 7 and leave it unformatted. Ubuntu will then find the empty space and create 2 partitions it needs there. One of then will be in ext4 format and the other one in Linux/Swap format.\n(Update as of 2019\nRecent versions of Ubuntu creates a swap file by default instead of a separate swap partition as described above.\nEnd Update)\nBoot from the Ubuntu DVD/USB and you will get the choice of Install or Try.

Remember after you chose the partitions and made everything remember to mark the two squares for format the sda 2,and sda 3 before installing and after that install.\n\nA: You do not need to prepare a partition in advance of installing Ubuntu alongside Windows with dual-boot. Ubuntu's installer has a very easy to understand installer that will guide you through the process. It's as easy as this:\n\n*\n\n*The Ubuntu installer asks whether to install Ubuntu alongside Windows (dual-boot), or to replace Windows completely. Choose the first option.\n\n\n\n*You can choose how much space you want to give to Ubuntu by dragging and dropping the slider in the next step of the process:\n\nFull instructions are found in the answers to this question: How can I dual boot Windows and Ubuntu?\n\nThe hard way\nIf you absolutely must prepare a partition for Ubuntu in advance, here's how to do it.\n\n*\n\n*First, the filesystem must be ext2 or ext3 or ext4. It can't be NTFS or FAT, as these filesystems do not support file permissions the way Ubuntu requires.\n\n\n*In addition, it's recommended you leave a couple of gigabytes for another partition called the swap partition. It does not need to be formatted in a certain filesystem.\n\n\n*Launch the installer, and choose \"something else\" to select advanced manual partitioning.\n\n\n*Find the partition created for Ubuntu. Select it and click \"Change...\". Select the filesystem ext4 (or ext3 or ext2), and assign it to the mount point /, also known as the filesystem root. This means that all Ubuntu's files should be installed in this directory. If you want to make sure that all existing files on that partition are deleted, tick the Format option in the main window.\n\n\n*Find the second partition reserved for swap. Select it and click \"Change...\". Choose \"swap area\" next to \"use as\".\nNote that the manual partitioning option also allows you to create partitions, so you really don't need to prepare partitions in advance.\nUbuntu will install the boot-loader GRUB, which will allow you to choose between Ubuntu and Windows on boot-up.\n", "Q: How do I make Unity quit opening Firefox under the Shiretoko icon? I'm using Ubuntu 12.04, and whenever I open Firefox, whether it is from searching on the dash or clicking a 'quick-launch' launcher, it always opens yet another icon for the running instance that is a blank page and says Shiretoko. It will pulse the Firefox icon for a while (I'm guessing until a timeout or something).

Which seems to have been confirmed after you couldn't rename the new.disk either until running chkdsk. By deleting the root.disk initially you haven't done yourself any favours, but hopefully the resize successfully completed before the corruption occurred.\nIf you've renamed the new.disk to root.disk and it isn't working, you may have better luck trying to recover the old root.disk. Maybe run the bootinfoscript first to see what shape the new disk is in. Or try to open it with ext2read from Windows.\nYou can see whether chkdsk recovered the root.disk (even though you deleted it, the file still exists and windows may still have recovered). So have a look for it as described here. In short, look for the hidden \\found.??? directories, and check for a file named file0000.chk that's about the same size as your old root.disk:\nC:\\>dir /a:h\nC:\\>cd \\found.000\nC:\\found.000>dir\n Volume in drive C is OS\n Volume Serial Number is B4B7-99A8\n\n Directory of C:\\found.000\n\n19/07/2011  02:02 PM    15,000,000,000 file0000.chk\n               1 File(s) 15,000,000,000 bytes\n               0 Dir(s)  222,258,069,504 bytes free\n\nC:\\found.000>move file0000.chk \\ubuntu\\disks\\root.disk\n        1 file(s) moved.\n\nNOTE: you have to run those commands from CMD.EXE that you selected \"Run as administrator\".\n", "Q: Gnome-terminal + Vim and Ctrl-Shift mappings Is it possible to map sequence with Ctrl-Shift in Gnome Terminal?\nI'm trying to add the mappings\n\n\n*\n\n*map <C-S-[> gT\n\n*map <C-S-]> gt\nand it's not working. How to do that?\nSomehow I mapped <C-S-]>, but it turned out it's not <C-S-]>, but <C-]>, so it looks like it doesn't recognize Shift in this sequence. It's misconfigured or it's gnome-terminal's fault?\nBesides. Mapping <C-[>, after pressed, looks like vim is waiting. I suppose it's mapping timeout, but how to get rid of this timeout when I press precisely <C-[> and I don't want to press anything else?\nI just started learning vim, so sorry if there is something obviously wrong in that mappings.\n\nA: I think the problem here is that you are trying to get vim, which expects to run in a terminal, to recognize a CTRL-SHIFT sequence.  While it's possible for X to recognize such combinations, applications that run in a terminal (or, these days, a terminal emulator) cannot.  This is because, historically, terminals could only send and receive seven- or eight-bit sequences of ASCII data across a serial connection (though this could include \"escape sequences\" that position the cursor, scroll or delete lines, change color and other helpful effects).\nThere are 32 \"Control Codes\" in the ASCII character set, including the familiar CTRL-A through CTRL-Z.  But there are no corresponding ASCII codes for \"CTRL-SHIFT\" A through Z.  Now, gnome-terminal itself can recognize these codes (CTRL-SHIFT-V, for instance, will paste text from the clipboard), but vim will not be able to have direct access to it.\nOf course, it may be possible (I don't know) for a terminal emulator to be set up to convert CTRL-SHIFT key presses to an escape sequence which can then be recognized by a vim mapping.\n=======\nUPDATE\nYou might be interested in gvim, which is a graphical version of vim that runs as an X program rather than a terminal program.  Maybe gvim will be able to understand CTRL-SHIFT codes?\n\nA: Seems to be an issue with GNOME Terminal not allowing certain combinations with the Ctrlkey. Searching online shows a lot of cases of this.\nJust in case you don't know, Ctrl+page up/page down cycles through tabs.\n\nA: As Bartleby pointed out this is a terminal restriction, because vi sees the keycodes as being the same.\nFor terminals such as xterm you can change that. For gnome-terminal which ignores the X resources settings I don't know how to do the following:\nThis SO question covers the same topic, and this example shows this in use for mapping multiple keys in the .Xresources file. E.g.:\nXTerm*vt100.translations: #override \\\n  Ctrl ~Meta Shift <Key>a: string(0x1b) string(\"[65;5u\") \\n\\\n  Ctrl ~Meta Shift <Key>b: string(0x1b) string(\"[66;5u\") \\n\\ \n  Ctrl ~Meta Shift <Key>f: string(0x1b) string(\"[70;5u\")  \n\nNow we have different key sequences coming into vi for Ctrla vs. CtrlShifta, Ctrlb vs. CtrlShiftb, Ctrlf vs. CtrlShiftf.\nWe can now map them differently in ~/.vimrc:\nmap <ESC>[66;5u   :echo \"ctrl-shift-b received\"<CR>\nmap <ESC>[70;5u   :echo \"ctrl-shift-f received\"<CR>\nmap <C-b>         :echo \"ctrl-b received\"<CR>\nmap <C-f>         :echo \"ctrl-f received\"<CR>\n\n\nA: It seems you just have to disable all keyboard shortcuts in gnome-terminal.\n\nA: In gnome-terminal the escape sequences generated by keys are not configurable. For many keys Ctrl+key and Shift+Ctrl+key generate different sequences; unfortunately for [ and ] they don't, so you can't distinguish them.\n", "Q: Kompozer not in the repo?

The default installation process now creates a swap file in the main Ubuntu systems partition /, rather than a separate swap partition described below. \nOriginal Answer\nUbuntu need at least 2 partitions in formats that Windows does not understand and cannot create.  You can shrink sda5 (D:) in Windows 7 and leave the empty space \"Unallocated\" and unformatted. \nYou should use Windows internal tools to defragment and then shrink or resize the D:. See http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/gg309169.aspx . and http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/window-on-windows/quick-tip-shrink-a-hard-drive-volume-in-windows-7/3616 for detailed steps. Remember, do not create a new partition in the empty space. Leave it unallocated.\nUbuntu installation will then find the unallocated space and create sda6 (/) and sda7 (Swap) there during a \"side by side\" installation. \nUbuntu (and Linux in general) do not use C:, D: etc. to identify partitions. Partitions are mounted at various mount points that can be a folder or a directory. An important mount point is root denoted by /. This is the rough equivalent of C:\\ where the OS will get installed. Other partitions are mounted to folders within /. By default /home is a folder in / in Ubuntu. However, one can devote a separate partition to /home by mounting the partition, say /dev/sda8, to that folder. In that case all sub-folders of /home will be in the partition dedicated to it.\nNote: the Swap partition has its own format and no mount point, as it is not accessed by the user directly. \nSee I have formatted a partition for Ubuntu. How do I install it on that partition? and Dual Boot Installation with Win7 - Install Ubuntu in New Partition.\nHore general instructions for installation is at: How do I install Ubuntu?.\nHope this helps\n\nA: Here is my suggestion:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start by defragmenting your drives in Windows. This means that all your Windows files will be in a right order and, more importantly, that your files will be all in the beginning of the drive. The result will be that the end of the partitions will have no more data.\n\n*Make a backup of your data anyway. You probably will not loose anything. But it is \"good practice\".\n\n*Partition your D:\\ drive. That is to say, divide it into two. The first part will stay D:\\ with your Windows data. The other part will host Ubuntu, let's call it \"sda6\" from now on, as I think it will be named this way.\n\n*Increase the size of sda4, since the swap partition should be at least as big as your RAM (memory) capacity.\n\n*Install Ubuntu. During the installation, select the option of selecting the partition on which you want it to install ; you will chose sda6, mounted as \"/\".

I want to convert a PDF file to DOC keeping the formatting. I found an article explaining how to do this with KWord, but when I installed KWord I got Caligra Words.\nImport doesn’t support PDF files. Should I install an extra plugin for this extension, or install an older version of KWord?\n\nA: Try using the online service zamzar.com\nYou can even email your file to doc@zamzar.com\nDepending on the complexity of the formating there might bee some losses though.\n\nA: You can use google drive - during uploading, check option \"convert sent files to google format\" (or similar, my languge is Polish). \nYo can also check other online tools - such as http://www.pdftoword.com/ (untested by me). \nEDIT:\nYou can also use LibreOffice Draw. This program can open PDF files, and you will able to edit them. \n\nA: If your pdf is a one-page document, the best I found is Inkscape. It won't be able to save as a doc but you can edit it.\nUnfortunately you can only do this one page at a time.\n\nA: I found a PDF converter, which can convert PDF to MS Word Document, JPEG, TIFF and other formats. I think it’s very powerful.\n", "Q: Can't reboot system using ssh I am running Ubuntu Server 12.04 and I would like to reboot my system. I ssh into it fine, but when I run sudo reboot I get the following error -bash: /usr/bin/sudo: Input/output error. It is at this point that I noticed other commands are disabled and I am no longer able to write or save any files to the disk. Short of manually rebooting the system, is there a way to fix this? I am not sure I understand exactly what is going on.\n\nA: Your hard drive most likely dropped off the SATA bus.  If it had simply encountered an error and your filesystem had remounted read-only, you'd have gotten a different error - sudo: unable to open /var/lib/sudo/something/something: Read-only filesystem or similar.\nWhen you rebooted, your drive decided to play nicely again.  This might be an isolated once-in-a-lifetime issue caused by a power burp or something, or it might be an early indicator of impending drive failure.  Check SMART data on the drive, and consider replacing the drive.\nUptime has nothing to do with this.  Linux systems are easily capable of years of uninterrupted uptime (though in practice this would mean a years-old version of the kernel, and therefore shouldn't really be strived for).\n", "Q: How to install ia32-lib on 64 Bit System?

For the longest time, I've been running Windows 7 with Ubuntu 12.04 inside VirtualBox.  As I found myself more and more inside the virtualbox, I decided to switch roles.\nThe problem I'm seeing is that running windows 7 inside VirtualBox on top of a linux host seems to be slower than when the roles were reversed.  One thing in particular I noticed was on the Windows 7 guest vm, the CPU frequency reflected the default frequency (2GHz).  To contrast this, I created a Windows 7 VM on top of a windows 7 host and it shows the turbo mode frequency and is much snappier than my VM being hosted on Ubuntu.\nIs there anything special I need to do to enable the turbo mode?  Are there any other steps I can do to make the virtual machine run better?  The VM I created has 4 Cores, 8 GB RAM and 256GB video memory dedicated to it.  Since I'm a .NET developer, I need some horsepower when I'm running Windows...\nIf it's of any help, here are the specs of the machine I'm trying to get this to work on:\nProcessor: i7-2630QM\nRAM: 16GB\nVideo:  NVidia GTX 460M\nStorage: 128 GB Crucial M4 SSD, 750GB HDD\n\nA: If you are allowed to expose it to your VM, it will be in the Virtual Box Settings for the VM Image. It will probably right on the menu where you enable VT-X for your virtual box session. I don't have an I7 Processor so I can't really say. My next bet would be to install the PPA for virtualbox and get the latest and greatest version to see if it would allow me to do that. Then if not check the DEV versions.

However, now I'm able to pair my phone with the computer, and to send files from my computer to the phone. What's not working is sending files from the phone to the computer and browsing phone files on the computer.\nThe reason why I'm asking this question is actually to check whether my Bluetooth adapter is still not fully supported, or I just don't know how to use it properly.\n\nA: *\n\n*Create a folder in `/media/mountpoint with root rights\n\n*Install obexfs \n\n*pair the phone with the PC \n\n*Get the device MAC and mount it with obexfs: \nsudo mkdir /media/mountpoint\nsudo apt-get install obexfs\nhcitool scan\n\nScanning ...\n8F:77:17:77:44:16 My Android Phone\n\nobexfs -b 8F:77:17:77:44:16 /mountpoint\n\nTo unmount the device: \nfusermount -u /mountpoint \n\n\nA: ok then try this:\ntest before, if your usb dongle was recognized you test it with this command:\nlsusb | grep Bluetooth \n\nif you get this message, its successfuly recognized:\nBus 003 Device 004: ID 1310:0001 Roper Class 1 Bluetooth Dongle\n\nthen install an another browser for ubuntu:\nsudo apt-get install bluez-utils libopenobex1 bluez-tools \n\nafter the installation, you must restart the bluetooth dongle with this command:\nsudo /etc/init.d/bluetooth restart \n\nor with this command\nsudo service bluetooth restart \n\nDetails of the Bluetooth device is obtained with the command:\nhciconfig --all \n\nif all is ok, install bluetooth applet \n\nA: Have a look to https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Blueman\nand install the packages obexftp and obexfs.\nMounting Bluetooth devices\nThe instructions below describe a method for using different file managers with Blueman.

Can I add Ubuntu 12.10 repositories to 12.04 to have the latest software and updates? If, yes, how can i do this? I know that by adding PPAs I can have latest software, but really, I do not like to use PPAs. So is there any way to use 12.10 repositories in 12.04?\n\nA: You can add other repositories, including for future and past versions of Ubuntu, to your /etc/apt/sources.list file or new files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/\nHowever, this is not recommended. Ubuntu does not do testing of packages across versions and you are very likely to encounter undocumented conflicts and errors if you do this. If you want to mix and match repositories I would recommend starting with debian testing as your base OS and then adding Ubuntu or other distros' repositories on top of that.\n\nA: If you want you can add them in /etc/apt/sources.list file. But, be warned that, you may face dependency conflicts later. Also adding them is like running 12.10 without upgrading. But anytime you execute the upgrade command, the system will be upgraded to 12.10. So, there is no benefit adding them to 12.04 without using the upgrade instead.\nIf you wanted to have an upgraded version of some apps only (and wanted to remove the 12.10 repos after doing that), then I strongly advice you not to do that. Because upgrading to an updated version will/can put your system forward and after removing the 12.10 repos, you'll face numerous problems with dependency from the non-upgraded packages.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 Touchscreen Calibration I have a machine with Ubuntu 12.04 installed, with dual monitor, via VGA and DVI Interface.

Tried to reinstall 12.10 over 12.10 and failed.\nPut in Debian....let it wipe the drive, create partitions, then killed the install.\nThen a fresh install of 12.10......and in it went.\nSo it seems to be if you have a clean drive or a failed install to be written to, there's no problem.\nNo idea why....that just seems to be the way it is.\n\nThis seems like a partition cleaning bug, since you can clearly install it on a clean drive or over an installation that failed.\n\nA: Well, I had the same issue. The way I resolved it was starting up with the live CD and then got into the disk management app, and just format the drive from there. In the option of which file system, I checked the linux file system option. And the installation went very nice.\nThanks a lot!\n\nA: If you have multiple HDDs and dozens of bootable operating systems,as I have, this is a real problem.\nI cannot install 12.04 from CD because it just hangs.\nThere are plenty of clean volumes and previously installed versions, but the installer simply cannot resolve my drives and just hangs. (I have over 3TB of HDD space divided into logical volumes)\nThe only way to do it is to install 10.04 and then upgrade it to 12.04\nBlack mark for Ubuntu, by some sort of assumption that all users will be installing to a desktop with just Windoze installed or a previous linux version on a single small HDD, they have completely screwed up what should and used to be, a simple process.\nTry installing to a completely virgin HDD and you will get a similar problem, the partitioner does not recognise it until you run fdisk and do rudimentary partitioning.\n\nA: Delete the partitions and make new ones from GParted. That worked for me.\n\nA: I observed the same issue on ubuntu 13.04.\nI was able to work-around the issue by mounting the partitions not needed by the installer.\n", "Q: How can I change the two figure behavior with my MacBook Pro (6,2)'s trackpad? By default on mac os, with two fingers I can do this:\n-leave a finger on the mouse pad, and move another finger, and still be able to move the mouse\n-two finger scrolling requires both fingers be moving \nthis is handy, as sometimes (because the trackpad is so large, I leave my thumb on the \"button\" (or any other fingers depending on how I'm sitting) for clicking, as clicking AND moving the cursor at the same time is difficult with this track pad (the whole thing needs to be pressed to click)\nI think this probably also affects click and drag, as I would only be allowed to use one finger, instead of one finger to click, and the other to move the cursor.\n\nA: Have you checked the mouse settings under system preferences? On my MacBook Air I have some settings there. I'm using the Synaptics driver. If there are no extra settings under the mouse and touchpad bit then you can try the following providing synaptics is installed: \nsynclient TapButton3=2 ClickFinger3=2 PalmDetect=1\n\nLet me know how it goes :)\n", "Q: Unity completely broken after upgrade to 12.10?

(Almost) everything works just fine. However, the lock screen (Gnome screensaver) does not expose a UI to control music playback. Whenever I have Rhythmbox running in the background I cannot pause music playback without unlocking the screen. Obviously some package(s) or configuration bits are not present but I am not able to figure out what needs to be added or done in order to enable playback control in the lock screen.\nAny idea what I might be missing? Ideally I would not like to install Ubuntu desktop only to get music controls in the Gnome lock screen.\n\nA: i think this should solve your problem:\nexecute the following command:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver show-notifications true\n\nthis will enable notifications ( music too ) for gnome-screensaver . \n( for disabling run the same command with false at the end! )\ni found that command somewhere while i tried to fix my own problem..\nNote: This solution on currently works for Rhythmbox and may be deployed in a later version of Gnome (3.8?)

However, it keeps going to a black screen with a single yellow character on a burgundy background.

After finding and reading this answer for \"My computer boots to a black screen, what options do I have to fix it?\" I began following the steps under \"2. Black/purple screen when you try to boot the LiveCD\" and it worked perfectly. After installation I could only get it to boot properly by selecting the \"recovery mode\" option in GRUB and then choosing \"Resume - Resume normal boot,\" but downloading and installing the recommended updates and drivers solved that problem.\n", "Q: Partitions for Ubuntu and Windows 7 dual boot on SSD + HDD setup I have purchased a new SSD (120GB) and I had a HDD (1TB) already installed. I will install both Ubuntu and Windows on these drives. As the file space on the SSD is limited and I've read that writing to an SSD drive is discouraged, I would like to store most of the data on the HDD drive. I am aiming at faster system but also keeping the valuable data safe on the more reliable HDD and expanding the life span of the SSD.\nI have already set up Windows on these drives (system files and applications on SSD, Users folder and ProgramData on HDD) and now it's time to set up Ubuntu.\nSo my question is which partitions I should create, on which drive should they be placed and how large they should be.\nBased on my experience and articles I've read, I will probably create /swap, /home and / partitions. \nDoes it seem reasonable to place /swap and /home partitions on the HDD and / on the SSD?\nAnd how large should / partition be?\nAlso, will the applications be installed in / partition?\nIf so, is it rational to store the applications on separate partitions on the HDD instead of / on the SSD, and what should the size of the / partition be in this case?\n\nA: Putting / in the SSD and Swap and /home in the HDD seems reasonable. \n/ will contain the OS, all the applications, and any server related stuff that does not belong to a specific user. For example, if you run a web server all the data files for the server will be in /. \nSo how big / should be depends on what you plan to do with the box. For \"normal\" desktop use 15-30GB should be more than enough. This should be sufficient for the OS and all the applications you may install in the future.\nThe advantage of keeping the OS and applications in the SSD is speed. However, personal settings and preferences are stored in the /home. So for the fastest results you may want to keep the /home in the SSD as well and use symbolic links to the folders with large data, such as Documents, Pictures, Music, Videos, etc. See Setup for dual disk (SSD+HDD) with /home partition for some details.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: LIRC (remote control daemon) doesn't work I have Pinnacle's Analog TV PCI card with remote (IR) controller.

I have just started using Okular and I love it. It has a lot of functionality that I need when I am in pdfs and it already opens up epubs automatically. How to I get it to open pdfs by default instead of \"Document Viewer?\"\nI appreciate the help!\n\nA: In Ubuntu 14.04, the file you need to edit is :~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list\nThe name of okular may varies. Someone may also find that there is no \"Set as default\" button.\nSo follow these steps:\nStep 1: Right click on any pdf file => Open with => find Okular\n\nThe name of okular applications now should be specified in mimeapps.list. Now move to step 2.\nStep 2: gedit ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list\n\nStep 3: Find okular in [Added association] and copy to [Default application] section.\nIn my case, it is 'application/pdf=kde4-okularApplication_pdf.desktop;'\n\nAnd you are done.\n\nA: According to here, Right click the file of the format you want, select properties:\n\nGo to the open with tab, select the program you want to be the default for that type of file, then press the button Set as Default:\n\n\nA: First open a terminal and use this command:\ngedit ~/.local/share/applications/defaults.list\n\nAfter opening it, Under the [Default Applications] section add a line like this\napplication/pdf=okular.desktop;\n\nNow save the file and exit gedit.\n\nA: In short, if I remember correctly : \n\n\n*\n\n*Right click on a PDF,\n\n*Properties,\n\n*Open with,\n\n*Select an app,\n\n*Set as default.\n\n\nA: Well, none of the other answers worked on 14.04, Okular simply doesn't show up in the list. But this worked perfectly:\nmimeopen -d myfile.pdf\n\nIt will give you a list of applications that can open the file, and will also update the default application for you. \n$ mimeopen -d myfile.pdf\nPlease choose a default application for files of type application/pdf\n\n1) Print Preview  (evince-previewer)\n2) Xournal  (xournal)\n3) MuPDF  (mupdf)\n4) Adobe Reader 9  (AdobeReader)\n5) GIMP Image Editor  (gimp)\n6) Document Viewer  (evince)\n7) Other...\n\nuse application\n\nSelecting one of these will set it as the default for application/pdf file types. You can easily set any executable to be the default by using the Other... option:\nuse application #7\nuse command: okular\nOpening \"myfile.pdf\" with usr (application/pdf)\n\nAside: If okular doesn't work, you might want to try entering the full path (usr/bin/okular). You can find out where Okular is located by running which okular.\n\nA: Use file manager (Dolphin in my case), select a file of the .pdf format, right click and select Properties (or Alt-Return), then click on the \"File Type Options\" and put your favorite viewer on top of the list (you may need to add one), and if it doesn't help, remove the one that is currently offered in the application (e.g. \"Document Viewer\") from which you want to open your file in Okular (Firefox in my case), even if it is not the first one on the list.\nWorked on 20.04.5 LTS with KDE.\n", "Q: Installed Windows 7 with Ubuntu 12 and grub isn't there?

I have about 200gb of data on the Ubuntu partition, and I need a way to boot back in. How can I resolve this issue? \n\nA: You will need to re-install Grub. Every time I installed Windows AFTER Linux, Windows would write its Master Boot Record (MBR) over Grub, therefore you will need to re-install grub on your drive.\nI don't remember the command from Grub, been too long, hopefully someone can help you out with a link or a step-by-step guide.\nEvery time I had this issue, all of my data was safe. Unless you did something wrong or something went wrong, all your files should be fine.\n\nA: Sounds to me like you installed Windows over your Ubuntu install or killed grub.\nWindows doesn't play nice with Ubuntu/Linux, but Ubuntu Linux does.  So most the time the best way to do this is to install Windows then Ubuntu, but no worries you can easily repair it.\nYou can watch this video to get an idea http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcbTgMKpVHQ\nTo simplify you can easily just create a live distro and do a grub repair.  \nHow to Repair/Restore/Reinstall Grub 2 with a Ubuntu Live CD\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Can the shopping lens be changed to display results from Amazon.co.uk?

I also have a RAID 0 (striping) setup of 2x1TB disks, configured at the BIOS level (raid controler which boots before OS/after BIOS?)  which merges the two physical volumes into one 2TB volume labelled MainVolume. The volume contains four primary partitions - two for Windows (boot and data) and two for Linux (root and swap), no logical partitions. \nI had problems installing any Ubuntu after 10.04 on this setup. In fact, I installed  12.04 by installing 10.04 first and then upgrading. Ubuntu 10.04 worked flawlessly, but  after upgrade to 12.04 it always displayed a message during boot in the console, something like \"iwatch dm-5 failed\" (not sure), but I didn't pay much attention to it because the system worked. Up until today's upgrade to 12.10.\nToday when I upgraded to 12.10 at the end of the upgrade process it tried to install grub, and failed with the message:\nPath `/boot/grub' is not readable by GRUB on boot. Installation is impossible. Aborting. \n\nThen the upgrade manager offered me to select a destination for GRUB - sda, sdb or MainVolume. When I select MainVolume it falls back to the above error message and asks again. I didn't choose sda or sdb, because I thought it might write to the physical drives as non-striped and mess up existing partitions. In the end I chose not to install grub and completed the upgrade. \nI'm writing this now from that box which I don't dare to reboot since it might not boot.\n:(\nAny ideas & sugesstions?\n\nA: Maybe you should reinstall and update grub2? Or try boot-repair tool to fix issues. I dont know if it will work with 12.10 it worked with 12.04 just fine\n\nA: When I tried to install grub, it failed as well because it was defaulting /dev/mapper which is not an actual device.\nI had to drop to BusyBox from the grub screen and ls /dev/m* showed a device called /dev/mapper/pdc_baagjii, so that's where I installed grub to, then rebooted no problem.  Hope that helps you.\nThe install of grub failed because I wasn't certain of the device location.  It was defaulting to /dev/mapper.\nSo I dropped to Alt+F2 and hit Enter key to enable ~BusyBox (which is the environment that the installer runs in).\nI looked at mount | grep mapper output and saw that my root partion was listed as /dev/mapper/pdc_baagjii1 / ext4.\nThat meant my grub install location should be the device /dev/mapper/pdc_baagjii.\nI flipped back to Alt+F1 to continue the installation and typed /dev/mapper/pdc_baagjii.  I could also have typed grub-install /dev/mapper/pdc_baagjii.\nAfter successfully installing grub at /dev/mapper/baagjii device location, I rebooted and was happy to see my Login prompt waiting for me.\n\nA: Yes, it seems that the distribution upgrade script does not play nice with RAID0.

I upgraded from 12.04 to 12.10 and after the install I had the same issues as you. I've spent hours messing with various things trying to get this resolved, complicated by the fact that I currently can't boot from DVD/CD and my largest functional USB key that my main board will boot is < 120mb.\nFinally I went back to trying super grub2 disk again and tried booting into Ubuntu using the 3.5.0-17-generic kernel instead of the 3.2 kernel I was previously on. Earlier, I was unable to boot that kernel due to it hanging before loading completely (I can't remember what exactly caused the hang) but it finally let me boot. I was then able reinstall grub-pc & dependencies as normal. Make sure you have some way to chainload into your install on the 3.5 kernel and maybe you'll be able to reinstall grub.\n\nA: I had the same issue with a new 12.10 installation. The solution was based on the one presented by Matt, but it needed some further steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select \"something else\" on the partition wizard to manually define the partitions.\n\n*Create at the start of the hard drive a 250 MB ext4 partition, mounted to /boot (set as primary)\n\n*Create the root and swap partitions\n\n*When the installation fails to install grub, choose to continue without installing it.\n\n\nWhen the installation ends:\n\n\n*\n\n*mount the \"/boot\" and \"/\" partitions manually\n\n*grub-install --boot-directory=(directory where the \"/boot\" partition is mounted) --root-directory=(directory where the \"/\" partition is mounted) (hard drive device)\n\n*umount the partitions\n\n*load \"gparted\", select the \"/boot\" partition, and activate the \"boot\" flag on the \"manage flags\" option.

After the installation got crashed the Computer wasn't able to boot and I wasn't able to reinstall it.\nI need help I don't know what to do now.\n\nA: if you decide to quit upgrade i would recommend to install aptitude with sudo apt-get install aptitude and run sudo apt-get safe-upgrade or sudo apt-get update -f and sudo apt-get -f install.Once i upgraded from 10.04 to 12.04 and it took almost 2.5-3 hours.If system is full of files and setting that can be a reason why it took to upgrade for so long\n", "Q: Learning the base for programming in C it's been a while since I think about starting to programming in C and after that to learn programming in C# and I search a lot on google but couldn't find a good guide to start learning base programming in C .However I found that Eclipe integrates very good with Ubuntu and it's a good programming environment for starting to program in C but somebody can give please some links with guides or tell me where can I find the bases for starting to program in C ,and I mean good base because I found a lot of incomplete guides over google ? And if I don't ask to much please give some tips of how to start and how to use Eclipse.Every help will be welcome ,thanks.\n\nA: You do not need to complicate things with Eclipse and stuff if you want to learn C (which is also an interesting choice of a first programming language... while not discouraging you, I'm curious about your motives). I think it would be much more useful to learn how all the low-level bits (source code, compiler, headers, libraries, debugger, makefiles) fit together and then, if you want, to transition to an IDE.\nFrom the Learn C the Hard Way book linked by Goddard:\n\nAn IDE, or \"Integrated Development Environment\" will turn you stupid.\n  They are the worst tools if you want to be a good programmer because\n  they hide what's going on from you, and your job is to know what's\n  going on. They are useful if you're trying to get something done and\n  the platform is designed around a particular IDE, but for learning to\n  code C (and many other languages) they are pointless.\n\nYou surely don't need Eclipse to write a \"Hello, World\" program in C. First install stuff needed to compile programs:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n\nthen open a text editor and type something like\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    printf(\"Hello, World\\n\");\n    return 0;\n}\n\nsave the file as hello.c. In terminal, run\ngcc hello.c -o hello\n\nyou'll find an executable file called hello in the same directory. Run it:\n./hello\n\nIt prints \"Hello, World\". Magic! Now get a book on C and try to modify the program to do something interesting.\n\nA: A good book to add to Sergey's answer is listed below.  This is the recommended route to go for a fresh developer.  The Ubuntu/Linux development world is bitter sweet.

I want to make different user accounts separate in Ubuntu 12.04  for some applications only.\nMy brother uses some applications I don't want so more specifically,\nCan I install application like \"Wine\" or \"Webapps\" in my account but have the application not appear in or affect other accounts??\nThe reason is that if I install Wine it conflicts with the Arabic fonts, causing problems on all accounts. So how can I install Wine in an account and stop it from affecting/conflicting with all accounts.\n\nA: Programs installed from the Software Center should be installed globally(system wide) and will be available to all users.  Each user will have their own file in their account to save there preferences and data except any user logged in as a guest as their data is deleted on logging out.  \nI would think that most(if not all) programs that need root privileges to install would also be usable by any user.  \n.sh and .bin files that install without root will only be available by the user that installed it unless the folder that it is installed in is made available to all users via the sharing options via the mouse right click or the command line chmod.  This is because progrmas that install without root only install into the home directory of the user that installed them.\nTo answer the part of your question about Wine, if it is installed via the Software Center or apt-get is will be available to all users.  This is true even if you download a current deb file from winehq.org.  If yo download the tar file from the sourceforge.net/ page it will (likely) only be installed locally and only available to one user.\n\nA: Since apt is system-wide, any installations and removals will affect all accounts. Since Wine does conflict with the arabic fonts, I suggest you get the font files and tick them in ~/.fonts. \nAlso consider using virtual machines. Since each has a separate virtual hard disk, each has its own programs and apt configuration.\n", "Q: Compaq Presario R3000 randomly fails to boot on 11.10, 12.04, 12.10 I’m trying to figure what to do with random failures to boot.\nMy old HP Presario R3000 with AMD Athlon XP-M sometimes boots, sometimes hangs with a blank screen during boot, and sometimes hangs on shutdown.

I have written a character device, and I want to declare it as the keyboard and use it to generate events from the virtual keyboard. How can I achieve that?\n\nA: If you've written the character device driver yourself, and it is intended to be used as an input device, then you might be best off altering your driver to work as an input device instead of a generic character device.\nFortunately, there is some good documentation in the kernel tree, at:\nDocumentation/input/input-programming.txt\n\nFor an online version, take a look at the input-programming.txt file in the linux tree on kernel.org.\nBasically, you'll create a struct input_dev, and register it with the input subsystem with input_register_device.

I have it booted up but when I get to the install page the only options are erase hard drive or \"Something Else\". I don't want to destroy anything messing with partitions, so if that is the answer please be specific and detailed...\nThanks \n\nA: There should be an \"Install alongside Windows\" option and I think you know that, but it's not showing. That may be a problem but immediately, to get Ubuntu safely installed isn't too hard:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to LiveCD under the Try Ubuntu mode.\n\n*Load gparted\n\n*Resize Windows' partition so there's enough space for Ubuntu, apply the changes and close gparted. If it gives you gyp about Windows needing to shut down properly, that might explain why the main installer isn't being cooperative: Boot Windows, shut down, boot Windows again, shut down again, and try the installer again. If that doesn't work, use the try-ubuntu mode and do the resize.\n\n*Then run the installer and it should give you an option to install into the free space you have created. Accept all the other defaults.\n\n\nThis should get you to a point where you can boot into Ubuntu. There is a possibility that because that installer couldn't find Windows, that there will be no option to boot to Windows from within the Grub boot menu. If that's the case you might want to run Boot Repair to fix things up.\n\nA: Firstly, ensure you have enough space to create a new partition.\nIn this case, I'd recommend looking at the links in mikewhatever's comment above. The first one at least will give you an overview of the process. But the instructions you probably want are located here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowtoResizeWindowsPartitions\nIn short, you can use a program like GParted to shrink the Windows partition in order to provide enough space for Ubuntu. Like James said, be aware the Windows typically uses the NTFS file system, while you'll probably want ext4 for Ubuntu. I think GParted comes pre-installed with Ubuntu, so you should be able to access it when running the live USB/CD.\nOnce you have created a new partition, you should be able to follow to typical installation instructions to install Ubuntu side-by-side with Windows. Then, when you boot up your computer, you should see a screen that allows you to select which OS you want to boot into.\n\nA: Please be sure to read this manual \n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/dual-boot-windows-7-ubuntu.html\nbefore doing this be sure to read manual first it a lot of plusses using dedicated /home folder because your files and settings stays with you & still you can reinstall ubuntu just by formating / partition\nHow did i set dual boot and installed ubuntu on windows system \n\nSo i booted from ubuntu live cd , run gparted wich shows your hard drive with windows on it.My goal was to make  unalockated space to create linux partitions and install ubuntu.So i resized windows partition to make free space (you can use any software you preffer*)\ni created free space with amount of 60 gigs. Be sure to wait until progress is finished dont close it or you will mess up system.

Then, the option to install alongside your existing OS might be available.\nWhat version of Ubuntu, and what installer are you using?\nI'd recommend re-downloading the ISO, and actually burning it to a disk. Writable CD's are fairly cheap at Wal-Mart or wherever; I got a 50-pack for $20 or so. (I can't remember how much, exactly, but they're fairly cheap. I ended up using them for all kinds of things, and it's lasted me forever, so I'd actually recommend buying a few just to have them.)\n(The reason I recommend re-downloading it is that you may have gotten an outdated, incorrect, or unofficial version. There may have also been an error in the download, although that's fairly unlikely.) The official download page for the Desktop edition installer is http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop.\nGet the \"Standard\" installer unless your computer is truly ancient, as it is easier to use and more user-friendly (and therefore more likely to offer pre-configured partition options, such as installing alongside an existing OS.)\nIf none of that helped, and you end up \"forced\" into a manual partitioning, then remember that the Windows partition will be an NTFS partition. I believe that this will be labeled as \"Type 7\".\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 5.5 compatibility issues with 12.10 I'm trying to figure out how the compatibility for the MacBook Pro 5.5 is now, with the new release of Ubuntu 12.10. I have tried several times with the previous 12.?? releases, and it always seemed to run hotter than normal and have a couple kinks with drivers and what not. So out of fear of burning out my laptop, I've had to force myself to wait with hopes of a brighter future, haha. \nI really want to move on to ubuntu for good, and heard a lot of compatibility issues have been fixed.\nIf anyone could shine some light on the situation, it would be great. Again, I would love to finally use Ubuntu as my primary OS finally.\nThanks,\nBarkerto\n\nA: I have a MacBook Pro 5,2 model, one of the last 17 inch models. A few months ago, I did a clean install of 12.04 (no OS X). I upgraded to 12.10 yesterday, and everything is going well. I did have to take about three days to get my install working perfectly. This is a good weekend project.\nBACKUP\nMake sure to do a complete backup of all of your data on a separate drive. I recommend a complete byte-for-byte drive copy. I cannot stress enough how important this step is. After a clean install, you will need to copy all of your files over to your Ubuntu install. \nPrograms\nThere were a few problems that I had to get through first, however. Heat wasn't exactly an issue, since your fans will make sure that your CPU doesn't melt. However, without a special program installed, your fans will always run at max RPM, which is quite annoying and unnecessary. You want this program to control your fans:\nmacfanctld - Fan control daemon for MacBook\nYou will also want to add this repo for mac-related stuff in Ubuntu:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mpodroid/mactel\nDrivers\nYou also might have some problems with WiFi drivers. If you do an install, make sure you have (1) power and (2) wired ethernet. On 12.04 I had to custom install some Broadcom drivers for WiFi to work properly. However, in 12.10, Ubuntu's Install Drivers thing works for me (Software Sources -> Additional Drivers (tab)). Make sure to install the Broadcom Corporation wireless drivers.\nYou will also want to install the current Nvidia proprietary drivers.\nAdditional Stuff\nI did a good deal of web searching during / immediately after my install. These are a collection of websites that I used when doing my install. They might not be applicable for your situation, but I recommend that you do a read through to become aquainted with what others have done.\nhttp://maketecheasier.com/install-dual-boot-ubuntu-in-macbook-air/2012/08/27\nhttp://blog.projectz.me/2012/10/21/setting-up-ubuntu-12-10-on-a-macbook-pro/\nGood luck with everything.

(WEP/WPA/WPA2) How can I find out what type of security a wireless access point (essid) is using? wep/wpa/wpa2 (preferably using commandline tools)\n\nA: NetworkManager has a great command-line backend called nmcli. The small draw-back is that some commands in 15.04 differ from 14.04 version of nmcli.\nUbuntu 14.04\nnmcli  -f NAME con status allows listing names of the current connections. For example,\n$ nmcli -f NAME,DEVICES con status                                                                                                \nNAME                      DEVICES   \nSerg-Wifi                    wlan0 \n\nNow, to list specific details about a connection, we can do nmcli con list id \"WifiName\". To be more specific, we are looking for line that says key-mgmt.\n$ nmcli con list id \"SergWifi\" | awk '/key-mgmt/ {print $2}'                                                                        \nwpa-psk\n\nThus we know , this wifi uses WPA protection.\nAnother hint is the following line:\n802-11-wireless.security:               802-11-wireless-security\n\nNow, how do we put this into the same script ?\nIf you have only one connection established ,\nnmcli con list id \"$(nmcli -t -f NAME con status)\" | awk '/key-mgmt/||/802-11-wireless\\.security/ {print $2}'\n\nHere we merely manipulate nmcli with -t flag to give us only the name of wifi Access Point without the pretty header,and use it in parameter substitution brackets$( . . .) and give it as an input to  nmcli con list id to list data about that Access Point. Finally, awk just filters out the necessary line. \nIf you have wifi connection established but also Ethernet connected, nmcli -f NAME con status will output multiple lines. I suggest filtering out wifi from that list, with nmcli -f NAME,DEVICES con status | awk '/wlan0/ {print $1}'. The rest of the processing would be the same as above.\nUbuntu 15.04\nThe above commands translate in 15.04 as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*nmcli -t -f NAME,DEVICE con status | awk -F':' '/wlan0/{print }' to get the name of established connection on wlan0\n\n*nmcli con show \"ConnectionName\" to list details about your established connection.\n\n\nSide note: in Ubuntu 14.04 there is nm-tool which lists information about your current connections in a readily organized format, however it is not present in 15.04 , hence I suggest you study and play with it on your own\n\nA: nmcli  is command-line client for NetworkManager. It can be used to view security types of nearby wireless access points. \n$> nmcli device wifi list \n\nResult will show up as following:\n\n\nA: You can use the iwlist tool to print out all details of access points nearby.

Thanks\n\nA: Gnome 3.6 features a new theming engine that is different from 3.4, 3.2, and 3.0. As Gnome 3.6 is relatively new, make sure that the theme is 3.6 compatible first.\nAfter you have verified that it is compatible, extract the zip to your .themes folder in your home folder. If you don't have a .themes folder, make it. To view hidden files in nautilus, use Ctrl + H.\nThen, you can apply the theme using a program called the gnome-tweak-tool.

The problem occurred after I first activated port forwarding.\nApparently until you activate port forwarding for the NAT it automatically enables port 53 forwarding.    I enabled UDP and TCP forwarding on port 53 and DNS started working again.    It did not work with only UDP forwarded. \nI am a little concerned that my host may no longer receive and process port 53 and will fail future DNS lookup as a result but have not tried it.  If this is correct then we probably need to also forward some of the other ports like network Time.  \nI suspect this is a bug in VirtualBox where it should automatically enable forwarding / sharing some of these common ports unless you explicitly disable them. \nI also modified the network interfaces in linux to include the name servers.   /etc/network/interfaces with the line dns-nameservers xx.xx.xx.xx but this had no effect on the problem until port 53 was forwarded.\nNote: I tried to post two pictures to make it more clear but the blog required a reputation of 10 so I couldn't.

Please help! Mmm I cannot add an image... I'll comment with the link to the error! \n\n\nA: First check md5sum of ubuntu 12.10 iso file you downloaded. If it corrects than may problem in DVD you burned. Burn Another DVD at low speed. If you face problem then It should be faulty hard drive.\n\nA: Check your ISO download if it is complete. Sometimes when you download a torrent it isn't really completed even though it states otherwise. Same can happen through direct download as well. Boot from you USB flash and you should not have problems.\nAlso go ahead and use CHKDSK utility on the drive you are trying to install. This might fix an issue if it finds one.\nYour last option is alternate ISO. Go ahead and try if none of the rest works.\n\nA: Get the .iso image ONLY from www.ubuntu.com/download/\nUse a torrent [available at http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/alternative-downloads ] if you're using a slow connection.\nBurn onto a new DVD at a slow speed using a system different fro the previous one.\nIf it still fails, you can try installing on your HDD using another machine.

The C:\\users\\NAME directory is equivalent to the home directory and can only be accessed through elevated permissions.\nYou should avoid using nautilus to access the data on this, but rather first attempt chown on the user directory to remap it to your user's ownership. Once done, it should be possible to retrieve the data.\nNote that this may corrupt access to the directory from windows-side, or corrupt the Windows user itself. Given that this hard drive seems less-than-workable, however, I doubt that you plan on using it again without formatting it, so this should be possible without any problems.\nIf it does not solve the issue, however, please give the output of ls -l on the users\\NAME directory.\n(I hope this doesn't come too late for you)\n", "Q: How to add a splash image in Grub2?

I read another guide which said my computer won't boot if I resize the Ubuntu partition because '/boot will be misplaced and I will have to repair GRUB2 myself.'\nSo how do I do this easily?\nThank you in advance.\n\nA: you need to boot from ubuntu live cd and use gparted wich is installed by default in it.just read some tutorial before you make some changes be sure you do it correctly ps resizing process can take a long time ,watch display options under progres bar to see more detailed  info\n\nA: To enlarge Ubuntu partition, what you need is LiveCD and internet connection\nUse the livecd of any version of Ubuntu. Then choose Try Ubuntu. After that, choose Gparted Partition Editor after search in dash or use terminal then type:\nsudo gparted\n\nAfter that, you can resize the partition.\nBut if you close it without do anything after it, the grub will be broken. To make the grub effective and usable. Open terminal and type:\nsudo grub-install /dev/sdx\n\nThe x variable depends on your harddisk. To check where is Ubuntu partition, type in terminal:\nsudo lsusb -l\n\nIf there is two harddisk, the terminal will show information for /dev/sda and /dev/sdb. Check where is the Ubuntu / Linux partition. If you see the Linux partition on (example) /dev/sda5, the x variable is a.

I can get a wired internet connection but cannot get a wireless connection.  Can anybody help?\n\nA: Make sure that you have the driver enabled for your wireless card. In order to do this, go to settings>software sources>additional drivers. You may need to temporarily use a wired connection to activate the driver.\n\nA: \nConnect to a wireless network\nIf you have a wireless-enabled computer,\nyou can connect to a wireless network that is within range to get\naccess to the internet, view shared files on the network, and so on.\n\n*\n\n*If you have a wireless hardware switch on your computer, make sure\nthat it is turned on.\n\n\n*Click the network menu in the menu bar, and click the name of the\nnetwork you want to connect to. If the name of the network isn't in the list, select More Networks to\nsee if the network is further down the list. If you still don't see\nthe network, you may be out of range or the network might be hidden.\n\n\n*If the network is protected by a password (encryption key), enter the\npassword when prompted and click Connect. If you do not know the key, it may be written on the underside of the wireless router or base station, in its instruction manual, or you may have to ask the person who administers the wireless network.\n\n\n*The network icon will change appearance as the computer attempts to\nconnect to the network.\n\n\n*If the connection is successful, the icon will change to a dot with\nseveral bars above it. More bars indicate a stronger connection to the\nnetwork. If there aren't many bars, the connection is weak and might\nnot be very reliable.\nIf the connection is not successful, you may be asked for your\npassword again or it might just tell you that the connection has been\ndisconnected. There are a number of things that could have caused this\nto happen. You could have entered the wrong password, the wireless\nsignal could be too weak, or your computer's wireless card might have\na problem, for example. See Wireless network troubleshooter for more\nhelp.\nA stronger connection to a wireless network does not necessarily mean\nthat you have a faster internet connection, or that you will have\nfaster download speeds. The wireless connection connects your computer\nto the device which provides the internet connection (like a router or\nmodem), but the two connections are actually different, and so will\nrun at different speeds.\n\nFrom: Ubuntu Documentation\n", "Q: What should look like example network configuration for maas/juju?

I have multiple iso files, actually two. I use Furius ISO Mount. Can I mount multiple iso files in a single image with this tool or another under Ubuntu 12.04? And how can I do it?\nEdit: \nI need to system see the full dvd. This is the main task. I hope this clarification makes clear the meaning of my question.\n\nA: Your question is still somewhat ambiguous and unclear to me (Blaming myself). I'm answering this considering each case:\nCase 1: Mount iso which is within another iso file\nIf you are asking whether you can  mount an iso file which is within another iso file, I would say, Yes, You can mount an iso file which is itself in another iso file\nFor example, Let us assume we have an iso file named file1.iso in our home directory and there is another iso file inside it named inside.iso. One way to mount both iso file is ---\n\n*\n\n*Create two folder in your home. Each for each iso file.\n mkdir ~/iso1 ~/isoInside\n\n\n\n*Mount the first iso file in the ~/iso1 directory\n sudo mount ~/file1.iso ~/iso1 -o loop\n\n\n\n*Then mount the second iso file inside this iso to \"~/isoInside\" directory\n sudo mount ~/iso1/inside.iso ~/isoInside -o loop\n\nNow you have the first iso file mounted in \"~/iso1\" folder and the second one in \"~/isoInside\" folder\nCase 2: Mount two iso file in a single directory.\nIf you are asking whether you can mount an iso file to a folder and then mount another iso file in the same previous folder, I would, Yes, you can do that also. But You cannot access the content of first mounted iso file.\nThat is, if you mount an iso file iso1.iso in a folder, say /mnt and then mount another iso file iso2.iso in the same folder /mnt, you will only see and access the content of iso2.iso file in /mnt. You cannot access the contents of iso1.iso file in /mnt folder until you unmount the second iso file, i.e iso2.iso file.\nTake note that, in such cases, you cannot either unmount the first iso file. You must unmount the second one and then first one.\nI think, you are having a problem with installation from an iso file (probably from alternate installer iso), if this is indeed the case, I suggest you to ask a question about your problem.\nHope this answer will help.\n\nA: I have done the trick. I made a directory, after I mount the ISO and by order, transfer data of both mounted drives to the directory. Finally, I made one ISO from merged data.\n\n\n*\n\n*Thanks you people for help! *\n\n", "Q: Laptop has no Wifi connection on boot, also disconnects when suspending I just got a new laptop, an Asus ultrabook, and installed 12.10 on it. The installation went smoothly with no errors.\nThe one issue is that wifi is not enabled by default when I boot. I have to manually enable it after logging in by clicking on the icon in the Gnome panel and selecting \"Enable wireless\".\nAlso, if ever the laptop goes into suspend mode, when it comes back, the wifi is disconnected.\nAfter a search on the web, it seems that the problem should be solved by editing the connections, and ensuring that for every wireless connection the \"Connect automatically\" and \"Available to all users\" checkboxes are checked. I have done this, but it has not changed anything.\nI would like the wifi to always be connected by default, when booting or any other time. How can I get this to happen?\nTo be clear, I am connecting to a wireless LAN connection, sometimes on my home connection, and sometimes at a hotspot. This is not a 3G or cellular service connection.\n\nA: Check that you've got the configuration to connect automatically:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click on the Network manager icon\n\n*Click on 'edit connections' in the drop-down menu\n\n*Click on the 'Wireless' Tab \n\n*Select your connection and click the 'edit' button\n\n*Up the top left click on 'Connect automatically' and down the bottom left click 'available to all users'\n\n\nIf this doesn't work then it seems there may be a problem with Network Manager and the configuration.  You could try removing Network manager and the configuration completely and re-install\nsudo apt-get purge network-manager\nsudo apt-get install network-manager\n\nNote that you will have re-configure the connection afterwards.  To re-install you will need a wired connection to plug into so that it can download and install network manager.  I'm not sure, but when you remove network-manager it will most probably stop all related services and disconnect from the network.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 upgrade stopped halfway through While upgrading from 12.04 to 12.10 the upgrade crashed while installing the upgrades.\nIt stopped while \"configuring python3-aptdaemon.gtk3widgets\" and the terminal says flashplugin-installer: downloading then shows the url for the flash plugin that its downloading.\nI think it stopped working because my internet connection is a bit patchy, and it probably failed while downloading the installer, but what can I do to make it get going again?\n\nA: You can give a try to fix your problem using Recovery Mode if none of the method works for you. If you are using wired connection then no problem, for wireless connection I'm not sure whether it will work or not, because I never tried to enable network in Recovery Mode when using wireless connection. Although you can give it a try.\n\n\n*\n\n*When your system starts chose Recovery Mode (2nd option in grub menu).\n\n*From the Menu just go to Grub option, it will give a message like Updating grub will mount your system in read/write mode. Just chose yes to mount your system in read/write mode. It will update your grub and will exit from Grub menu.\n\n*chose network option it may enable your network.\n\n*Then chose dpkg menu from the list, chose yes for all.\n\n*Finally chose root option and login. Execute following commands one after another:\n# apt-get autoremove\n# apt-get autoclean\n# apt-get update\n# apt-get -f install\n# apt-get dist-upgrade\n# apt-get upgrade\n\nThen reboot your system and check whether your issues are fixed or not. Run this command to reboot:\n# reboot\n\nReply if something goes wrong.s\n\nA: If the update is still running I would stop the internet connection for some seconds. That should result in an error in configuring the flashplugin-installer package, but it should continue with the others.\nThen you'll just have to run sudo dpkg --configure -a after the update (with working internet connection) and the flash plugin will be updated.\n\nA: In my experience, it's better to do a completely fresh install, because even the 'leading' Linux-based system will break at dist-upgrade.\nAlso, in my experience, at the 'sudo apt-get upgrade' stage, flashplugin-installer ALWAYS fails to download the .tar.gz from the Canonical archive, and nothing has ever been done to resolve this issue, in the several years that I've been using Ubuntu.\nFurthermore, 'sudo dpkg --configure -a' has no effect.\nStart all over again, and hope that the downloads don't fail, just for once.\nIs anyone at Canonical listening?\n\nA: Keep in mind that upgrading to new release can take a long time depending on files and settings you have. There was a bug with python 3 with me upgrading to 12.10 while it was in early beta. If you decide to stop upgrade process i would try intalling aptitude cause it works better with dependencies then apt-get and finish upgrading\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get aptitude  and run  sudo aptitude safe-upgrade\nAlso try  \n\n\n*\n\n*`sudo apt-get update -f && sudo apt-get upgrade -f\n\n\nAnd\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get dist-upgrade && sudo apt-get -f install\nWhen upgrade failed for me once i booted to restore system mode in grub menu and after  enabling network i fixed broken packages for upgrade to finish its process and everything worked fine\n", "Q: How to make my newly created secondary partition accessible? I have decided to reinstall my Lubuntu OS and to split on the occasion my partition so as to have a secondary one where long-time files would be stored. I guess what I wanted followed a logic that was close to my experience as ex-windows user. I just wanted a new non-system partition visible in the left side pane of the file browser.\nWhen trying to install the system onto the smaller partition for which i set / as mount point, I was prompted to set a different mount point for the other: i had already used / for the one that was not meant to be the system partition because i didn't new what / meant. Not knowing what to do I selected /boot for the second and went on installing on the smaller one with mount point /.\nAll was ok except that now the larger/secondary (/boot mount point) partition is not visible as I expected it to be.\nBut this doesn't mean that it is completely hidden or unaccessible. I found that /boot is in fact the location for this partition: when i go there i see i'm within the 30GB/second partition. creating a folder there and adding that folder to side pane (create shortcut) in Thunar, makes in a way that partition immediately visible and accessible in file manager's side pane the way i wanted to.\nbut this is still not a solution, for i cannot access it as a partition (unmount it, etc) \nIn Gparted it is:\n\n\nA: As i can see there is no /home partition you have am i right? I would create one in ex4  /home there all info and downloads will be stored. / partition is system partition with boot information.http://www.linuxbsdos.com/2011/05/04/manual-disk-partitioning-guide-for-ubuntu-11-04/ or check out one of many video tutorials on youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBCHsgry2RQ\n\nA: For your purpose the installation partition doesn't need to be extended (all your linux partitions are extended). \nTo get what you want (a separate partition that would keep your files after reinstalling your system) do the following: delete all linux partition including /dev/sda2. Then create two partition (both as primary partitions). Select mount point as / and /home (/ means your system will install in this partition and /home means your home folder will use this partition so that next installation will preserve your data). \nYou do not need to keep extra partition for swap.

Currently, I have Ubuntu 12.10 working.\nHere is what was done: \nWas running Ubuntu 11.04 and decided to try out 12.10. Backed up everything to external hard drive with rsync using my /root/daily.sh. My daily.sh just does a nightly rsnapshot of all my important file systems (I never ever create just a / and /boot like some do, instead I manually create all file systems or slices or partitions, however you like to call them).\nDestroyed RAID-10 and created new RAID-5 (need more space and don't mind a bit of a slowdown)\nInstalled Ubuntu 12.10 X64 and of course, clicked the radio button to install it customized which is the bottom radio button iirc.\nAfter install completed, rsync -az /bkup/daily.0/data/vmware /data/vmware/ (put back all my VMWare related files and DIRs)\n(fixed desktop to look/feel like 11.04)\nsudo su\n\napt-get install gnome-panel\n\nAfter that, logout, login but change to use gnome (no effects)\nNow to get VMWare working:\nBecome root sudo su\n\n   # apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-`uname -r`\n\n   # sh /path/to/vmware/VMware-Workstation-Full-9.0.1-894247.x86_64.bundle\n\nOnce it installs, go to Applications -> System Tools -> VMware Workstation\nEnter the serial number\nStart your windows 7 or 8 (assuming you want to run windows) .vmx (I use a fairly large partition to keep all vmware stuff.\nHave a nice day.\n\nA: Since 9.0.1 is out you can uninstall 9.0.0 and install that.\nIf you have problems uninstalling 9.0.0 or previous versions \nreboot in single user mode by pressing e at the grub loader and adding single at the end of the kernel line.

I go to TTY1 by pressing keys CTRL + ALT + F1, where I am asked to enter username and password, which I do, but I get the message \"Login incorrect\". In my log file /var/log/auth.log this entry has been made:\nOct 23 13:17:45 SomeName login[3361]: FAILED LOGIN (1) on 'dev/tty1' FOR 'aUser', Authentication failure\n\nI do not have the wrong username or password. It is the same username/password I use to log in when Unity starts.\nSo how come I can't log in to TTY1?\n\nA: The most common cause of this error is simply typing your password (or username) wrong. The keymap in the console is often subtly different from the one in X.\nMake sure you're typing the correct password by first typing it in the login field where you can see if it's being written as expected.\nCheck that you're typing your username exactly as it should be (including case), by comparing it to the output of whoami run in a terminal.\n\nAnother thing that will cause this exact same error message is if your login shell is not listed in /etc/shells. Find which shell you're using by searching for your username in /etc/passwd:\ngrep \"dave\" /etc/passwd\n\n(replacing dave with your username) you should see something like this:\ndave:x:1000:1000::/home/dave:/bin/zsh\n\nThe last field (/bin/zsh) is your shell. Let's search for it in /etc/shells:\ngrep \"/bin/zsh\" /etc/shells\n\nWe should see something like this:\n/bin/zsh\n/usr/bin/zsh\n\nBut if you don't, that's what the problem is. Try re-installing zsh (or whatever shell is missing from /etc/shells), and if that doesn't work, add it manually:\necho `/bin/zsh` | sudo tee /etc/shells\n\n(we use tee because > redirection doesn't work with sudo)\n\nA: Perhaps your keymap configuration is wrong fo the tty (which is a different setting than Xorg / Unity) and your password is wrong because of this. Try entering your password when you're prompted for your username and see if the characters turn out right; don't press enter, but delete your input (since login tries get logged and your password would be in that logfile). If something is wrong, you must set the keymap. In unity, open the terminal application and enter\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure console-setup\n\nand choose the right layout there. You might have to reboot.\n\nA: Maybe the layout is different.Also to login in console you have to enter username wich can be different from your name in profile installation option.For example there is user profile name wich is Andrew but the user pc name can  differ.See it here \nI have my profile name on russian and when i login to console i use english login name.

I want to create unity web-app for my new website.So,is there any up to the mark tutorial.I've read Ubuntu's official tutorial on this topic but that is not even complete.I've developed the code but don't know how to package the code\n\nA: Actually packaging a webapp isn't really different from packaging any other application. Take a look at resources in this answer and especially at existing integrations, e.g. LinkedIn, Feedly and (shameless plug) This Is My Jam.\nBasically, you need debian/ directory with at least the following files (see the guide for details):\n\n\n*\n\n*control with basic description for package manager (see example) Three keys are important for webapps in particular: XB-Ubuntu-Webapps-Includes, XB-Ubuntu-Webapps-Name and XB-Ubuntu-Webapps-Domain.\n\n*compat\n\n*copyright\n\n*install specifies which files should be installed where\n\n*rules\n\n*changelog specifies the resulting version of the package and must follow a very specific format; can be managed using e.g. dch command\n\n\nYou can generate these files using e.g. dh_make command or just copy the debian directory from other webapps project and change package names, filenames, and domains.\nOnce you have the files in place, you should be able to generate package using e.g. dpkg-buildpackage command (from the dpkg-dev package). The resulting package is generated in the parent directory.\nIf you are using version control such as Git or Bazaar, take a look at git-buildpackage or bzr-builddeb respectively (both available in Ubuntu repository). I've found especially the git dch command useful for maintaining the changelog. There's a nice HowTo on packaging with Git and uploading to PPA.\n\nA: I'd take a look at this link: http://developer.ubuntu.com/resources/technologies/webapps/ seeing it's the official guide. \n", "Q: Neverwinter Nights does not run in 12.10 I recently installed a fresh version of Ubuntu 12.10 on my notebook. Then I copied the backup copy of my Neverwinter Nights folder from my old 12.04 install on the same computer to the new installation and tried to start the game. \nThe terminal prompt disappears and top shows some low activity on nwmain, but there is neither showing up the game graphics nor plays any music.\nAny suggestions how to fix it? The game runs fine using the same setup expect for running on 12.04.\nBtw. I set up a virtual box with Ubuntu 12.04 on my notebook and use a copy of my Neverwinter Nights installation from the host (Ubuntu 12.10) to start the game. It works, I can play it under 12.04 64Bit Ubuntu in my virtualbox.\nKind regards and thanks in advance\n\nA: If you have a fresh installation of Ubuntu, there are a few things you usually need to install before running Neverwinter Nights. You should cd to the nwn folder and run \n./fixinstall\n\n(like you will have done when initially installing the game). This will check the game files and make sure you are ready to run the game. It is also worth manually checking that everything is executable that needs to be. (See also the bioware site for a good general tutorial and forum on Neverwinter Nights).\nThe most important dependency of the game is SDL, as we usually use the system SDL rather than the old, buggy version that comes with the client. So please enter: \nsudo apt-get install libsdl1.2debian libsdl-sound1.2 libsdl-mixer1.2 libsdl-net1.2 libsdl-image1.2\n\nYou should also make sure you are using the following line in the nwn script in the nwn folder:\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./miles:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n\n\nIf you are using the movie patch as noted at the Bioware site, you will need to install the dependencies for the BinkPlayer.\nsudo apt-get install libstdc++5 libx11-dev\n\nI assume that you have the BinkPlayer executable in the nwn folder and the line\nexport LD_PRELOAD=./nwmovies.so\nin the nwn script in the nwn folder.\n\nIf none of these suggestions fixes the problem, please cd to the nwn folder and run:\nstrace -o nwn.log ./nwn $@\n\n(As you have done, you could also put strace -o nwnmain.log ./nwmain $@ in the nwn script and then run the script with ./nwn.)  The resulting log files in your game folder might contain some useful information. As included by you in the comments, the logfiles are nwn.log and nwnmain.log.\n\nAfter examining your log files and comparing (in particular) your nwnmain.log results to mine, there are some differences (although most of the unimportant errors are common).  \n\n\n*\n\n*You don't have open(\"./nwmovies.so\", and all that goes after that, but you may not have applied the movie patch.\n\n*There are many ./lib references in your file and none in mine, so I wonder if there are any errant ./lib references in your nwn script.\n\n*Your file obviously terminates with a segfault, but I think the main problem is that the libraries cannot be found properly. You can confirm this by going to the nwn folder and running ldd nwmain. \n\n\nIn sum, I should make sure the game is set up properly (as I noted earlier in the answer), look for any errant references to ./lib in your config files, check that your libraries are being loaded properly (and if not perhaps add them to the nwn script with LD_LIBRARY_PATH), and check the permissions on your files are correct so that they will run properly. \n\nA: It does work on 12.10 64 bit and here is how I got it to work.\nIt should work for you as well, only I can't see the video even when it plays because of 64 bit.\n\nA: @0x0me.  I just tried the same thing as your original technique since I already had all the patches installed and working under 11.10.

But for machine learning you probably can provide us with more information what exactly you want to do. Probably you will need some additional libraries, for sure numpy, matplotlib, scipy which are the base on this type of problems, but also you need to decide what data format you have. For example I use pandas to have R-like dataFrame where I have different type of data with named rows and columns. \nMy point is. that at some point you need to know which Python version you have and which you want (pandas require at least some versions of libraries) what type of machine learning you going to use and what type of data you going to proceed.\nFrom that point your question can get better/precise answers.\n\nA: Python is installed by default in Ubuntu.

I was successful except for the Windows drive (dev/sda1) and that is because it is encrypted. Now, I cannot even run Windows with Windows Vista recovery CD. Any help please.\n\nA: To access a drive encrypted with LUKS or dmcrypt:\nFirst, open a terminal window and become root.  Type blkid to learn the device name of the partition you want.  (In your case you have already done this ;-)\nNow for the magic bit:  Run\ncryptsetup luksOpen <device file> <device-mapper name>\n\nand type your password.  For example, you might do something like cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda1 mydrivethatineed.  With this command, the decrypted device would appear at /dev/mapper/mydrivethatineed.\nNow you can go ahead and\nmount /dev/mapper/<device-mapper name> /mnt\n\nand your filesystem should appear under /mnt.\nOne last thing:  don't forget to unmount a crypto drive when you're done; otherwise, what's the point of crypto?  (Do note that the kernel unmounts everything and forgets all passphrases on shutdown.)  Unmount it with:\ncryptsetup luksClose <device-mapper name>\n\nand you should be set!\n\nA: Actually, I think you used the guided install and used the entire partition.

Moving lvm is quite dangerous and time consuming, don't do that.\nfor next time try not to allocate the entire disk to lvm...\n\nA: Meanwhile in Ubuntu land....\nit appears that grub-pc on 12.10 server uses a core.img to embed in the mbr which is slightly bigger than 12.04.

I'm trying to downgrade subversion to 1.6 from 1.7, doing sudo apt-get install subversion=1.6.17dfsg-3ubuntu3. This does not seem to work. \nAny idea on how to do this without breaking half the installation?\n\nA: If you have Synaptic Package Manager installed, you can force-downgrade Subversion to an older release. Just look up Subversion in Synaptic, right-click Properties, go to the Version tab and check what versions are available to you.\nIf you're lucky enough, you will find both an 1.7 version (1.7.5 in my case) and an 1.6 version (1.6.17). Close the Properties window, select Subversion from the list, go to the Package -> Force Version menu item and select the desired version.\nIf everything worked out fine you'll only need to worry about Ubuntu updating your software to the most recent release. In order to stick to the 1.6 version, you can lock this update: Package -> Lock version. And voila, you're back to good old 1.6 :)\n\nA: I have successfully downgraded to 1.6 by manually downloading the 12.04 svn and dependency packages from http://packages.ubuntu.com. I first uninstalled  version 1.7. Then, I installed the Ubuntu 12.04 packages in the listed order.\n\n*\n\n*libdb4.8_4.8.30-11ubuntu1_amd64.deb\n\n\n*libsvn1_1.6.17dfsg-3ubuntu3_amd64.deb\n\n\n*subversion_1.6.17dfsg-3ubuntu3_amd64.deb\n\n\n*subversion-tools_1.6.17dfsg-3ubuntu3_all.deb\nThe other solutions did not work for me.\n\nA: With the help of the other posts, I think I have a come up with a simpler way to nail it using Synaptic (so first ensure it is installed).\n\n\n*\n\n*Append the following line to /etc/apt/sources.list:\ndeb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu precise main\n\nThis will ensure you have at least two versions to select from, i.e 1.7 and 1.6.\n\n*Run\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\n*Go to the package manager, search for subversion and select it.\n\n*From the menu select package -> force-version select 1.6 or right click  -> properties -> version select 1.6.\n\n*Install the package\n\n*Select package again, then menu -> lock version.\nThis is to prevent automatic updates to higher versions.\nThis is it. Good luck.\nRecall: This uses the previous answers to provide an easier straight forward approach.\n\nA: svn 1.7 client is fully compatible with svn 1.6 server.\nYou only need to do \n$ svn updgrade working_dir1 working_dir2 ...\n\nAnd work as always, the upgrade preserve local modifications. See svn help upgrade\n\nA: Add deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu precise main to your /etc/apt/sources.list.\nRemove your current SVN by apt-get remove libsvn1 subversion. \nPurge files if needed dpkg --purge libsvn1 subversion.\nDo apt-get update and apt-get -t precise install libsvn1 subversion.\nYou might want to test your installation first with apt-get -t precise -s install libsvn1 subversion.\n\nA: What you could try is changing all your entries in /etc/apt/sources.list to precise, like this\ndeb http://extras.ubuntu.com/ubuntu precise main\ndeb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise main universe restricted multiverse\n\nthen run:\nsudo apt-get remove subversion\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install subversion\n\nIf the install of subversion 1.6 works out for you, then you'll want to revert your sources.list, and to lock subversion at 1.6 you run echo subversion hold | sudo dpkg --set-selections\nThis type of installation is not highly recommended, but sometimes it's the easiest option. If it runs into all kinds of crazy conflicts, then you're other best option is to just switch back to Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: I usually do the follow for Ubuntu 18.04, in this case to install subversion 1.6.17 because the “format 10” commit model. So for ubuntu I Download from ubuntu 12.04 amd 64 precise pangolin the binary:\nhttps://ubuntu.pkgs.org/12.04/ubuntu-main-amd64/libdb5.1_5.1.25-11build1_amd64.deb.html\nhttps://ubuntu.pkgs.org/12.04/ubuntu-main-amd64/libaprutil1_1.3.12+dfsg-3_amd64.deb.html\nhttps://ubuntu.pkgs.org/12.04/ubuntu-main-amd64/libapr1_1.4.6-1_amd64.deb.html\nhttps://ubuntu.pkgs.org/12.04/ubuntu-main-amd64/libsvn1_1.6.17dfsg-3ubuntu3_amd64.deb.html\nhttps://ubuntu.pkgs.org/12.04/ubuntu-main-amd64/subversion_1.6.17dfsg-3ubuntu3_amd64.deb.html\n\nAnd then execute in the cli with in the download diretory the follow commands:\nsudo apt-get remove subversion\nsudo dpkg -i libdb5.1_5.1.25-11build1_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i libaprutil1_1.3.12+dfsg-3_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i libapr1_1.4.6-1_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i libsvn1_1.6.17dfsg-3ubuntu3_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i subversion_1.6.17dfsg-3ubuntu3_amd64.deb\nsudo apt-cache policy subversion\n\nSo the first command assurance there is no subversion and dependencies, the last command aid to see what you have installed from that package. The inner commands install each downloaded package and you will be prompted if something is different or missing. Any doubt you could use the website where I suggested the downloads to seek dependencies and see another detail about the package.\n", "Q: Upgrade to Ubuntu from Windows Vista \n\nI am trying to upgrade a Dell inspiron 1501 from Windows Vista to Ubuntu.

Keep in mind that these are just warnings, not errors.\n\nA: This error indicates that the software is using valid GTK library calls with a newer version of the GTK library.  Sometimes during software development it is desirable to get rid of the, \"old way\", to do things while maintaining backwards compatibility.  This is accomplished by marking the undesired calls deprecated.  This tells the developer that their code is valid in this release, but in the future their code will need to be updated to work with a new version of the library, possibly many releases down the road.\nIn this case, GTK wants to be more strict about including units on dimensions.  It tells the developer that GTK is assuming the units are pixels, which is the exact assumption that the software developer made in the first place.\nNot using units is deprecated. Assuming 'px'.\n\nThat is a long and very complicated way of saying that these warnings are for the developers of the icon-theme, and do not reflect actual run-time problems.  \nUsing the Ubuntu software repositories, you will not be given incompatible programs and libraries.\n", "Q: Remove \"Install Ubuntu\" menu on persistent USB stick? I used the Lili software to create a persistent live Ubuntu install on my usb stick, and everything appears to be running fine. However, whenever I boot the PC, Ubuntu always prompts me with the \"Install Ubuntu\" (or try it) menu, instead of sending me to a login screen. \nI've already added a couple new user accounts, and I created some test files to ensure the persistent memory is working, but I can't find a way to disable the menu. \nIs there a way to remove that menu without actually installing to the usb stick (and to just keep it in persistent live mode)?\n\nA: it because its not currently installed system its still live usb (even if it unlike ubuntu live dvd save your settings)and that is because everytime this menu appears.If you install ubuntu  from usb stick to hard drive you wont get this menu\n", "Q: Use Spanish ONLY in LibreOffice I tried to use Spanish in LibreOffice, but it won't work.\nThe Spain Language Pack is installed. If I enable it, my complete Ubuntu installation is in Spanish, but not in LibreOffice.\nI tried to use Spanish via LibreOffice extension, but Spanish is nowhere to be found.\nPlease help me.\n\nA: I assume you mean you want to use LibreOffice's Spanish-language user interface, and enable its editing features for Spanish (e.g. spell-checking).\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the language packages are installed. To do this, open the Language Support dialog (from the menu or by running gnome-language-selector), click \"Install / Remove Languages...\", make sure the box for \"Spanish; Castilian\" is ticked:\n\nThen, if needed, press \"Apply Changes\".\nDon't change the order of the languages (i.e. leave English on top) in the main Language Support dialog; this means that the default language for all applications will be English.\nAfter doing this, make sure the packages libreoffice-l10-es (Spanish UI), libreoffice-help-es (if you need the help in Spanish), and a Spanish spelling dictionary are installed. (I'm not sure whether Language Support dialog installs these for you.)\n\n*Open any LibreOffice application, and browse to Tools > Options > Language Settings > Languages:\n\n\n*Change \"User interface\", \"Locale setting\", \"Default currency\", and default document language (as desired) to your desired national variety of Spanish, and press OK. (You must close and reopen LibreOffice before the language will change.)\nThis will change the language only for LibreOffice, leaving other applications in English.\nIf you meant you want the Spanish-language tools (for writing documents in Spanish) but still want the English UI, do the same, but leave \"User interface\" as English.\n\nA: Is the libreoffice-l10n-es package installed? It will need to be installed for LibreOffice to have Spanish UI.

However, none of those fixes have worked for me (A guy suggested them to me in the irc chat also).\nThe problem is that this laptop has two speakers in front, two down the screen and a small subwoofer down the case. The problem is that the two front speakers and the subwoofer don't work at all, thus causing my music and any other sounds bassless (And being a big electronic music fan, I can tell you that's awful).\nI dual boot with win8 and I had the same issue there, but quickly fixed it installing the IDT High Definition codec driver from the HP support center, which is seemingly not available for linux at all. The strange thing is that it doesn't seem to be a driver issue, since if I plug some quality headphones, the bass is there, so the audio codec/soundcard is processing all the sound properly, it is just not sending it through the appropiate channels.\nIn case it is useful, my laptop specs:\nhttp://www.cnet.com/laptops/hp-pavilion-dv7-6165us/4505-3121_7-34800415.html\n\nA: Beats Audio is just a brand name that stands for nothing in particular when talking about laptops and especially Linux.

Actually right now I use quickly merely to start my application, because I could'nt figure out how to run a quickly application without quickly run.\nI appreciate every answer!\n\nA: The second part of your question: \"How to make you application run without quickly run\" is  discussed here. The patch to enable that is available as part of the bug report on the issue: Compiling schemas not part of the application template\n\nA: Port Quickly Python 2.7 to Python 3.x\nI am not sure if it was there before I upgraded to Ubuntu 12.10 but now is a bin/<programname> Folder inside the quickly-template code. E.g. <programname>/bin/<programname>. It's the entry point from where the quickly app is started!\nIn this file it's simple to change the python version: Modifying the first line is enough, e.g. change it from\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nto\n#!/usr/bin/python3\n\nand your quickly application is running with python 3! Of course, you'll still have to modify all the project files to work with python 3 instead of python 2.7.

The first step is to boot using the Windows 7 cd, enter the recovery console (right at the beginning of the installer), and type the following into the console:\nbootrec /fixboot\n\nThis will fix the windows bootloader files without altering the MBR.  More info about the bootrec tool can be found here: Use the Bootrec.exe tool in the Windows Recovery Environment to troubleshoot and repair startup issues in Windows.  Reboot and see if Windows will load from GRUB.  \nIf that does not work some people suggest booting again from the Windows installer cd, and doing a repair install on windows.  This will most likely overwrite grub in the MBR so ONLY windows will start.  \nIf windows now boots, simply use the Ubuntu CD to recovery boot your existing Ubuntu install.  Once it is started run the grub tool again to restore grub to the MBR, so it can start either Linux of Windows. Replace /dev/sdz with the device of your boot hard drive. \nsudo grub-install /dev/sdz\n\nMore details about this process can be found in this very well written HOWTO: Recovering Ubuntu After Windows Install.\nHopefully both systems will boot from grub now.

When I try to log in as that user, I am prompted for a password.  \n\nA: It sounds a bit like you don't have a password set for your account. To verify this, try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Head back into the User Account settings\n\n*Choose 'Unlock' from the upper right (if my assumption is correct, you should not be asked for a password)\n\n*Click on the string of dots next to the 'Password' field\n\n*Choose a new password, making sure to leave the 'Current Password' field blank.\n\n\nIf you really didn't have a password set, then you should do now.\n\nA: I found the problem.  I was in our LDAP group with GID 119, which on this system happens to be the nopasswdlogin group.  I fixed the problem by changing the GID to another number.\nI believe group 119 was the admin group on Fedora when we setup our LDAP a while back.\n", "Q: sbackup fails to connect via ssh when run via sudo I prefer to run sbackup via sudo to be able to backup other things than my normal user has access to.

I'll show you by way of an example, and then you can adapt it to your own purposes. \nI first created a zip archive of my script folder with the following command (working from my home folder):\nzip -r Scripts.zip Scripts\n\nNow this had 76 items. I then added some 2 pdfs to the Scripts folder on disk and then ran the following command, and transferred just the new and changed files to a new zipfile:\nzip -r Scripts.zip Scripts -DF --out new.zip\n\nThis was the output:\nupdating: Scripts/ (stored 0%)\nadding: Scripts/GIMP+Magazine+Issue+1.pdf (deflated 2%)\nadding: Scripts/Whitepaper-CentralisedLogging-v1.pdf (deflated 10%)\n\nNow only these 2 new files are in new.zip, and they have not been added to the original zip. In the command, the -DF option allowed us to create a 'difference archive' specified with the --out switch, so that any new files present in the folder on disk, but not in the original zip, go to the new zip. So according to the man page, it is indeed possible to \n\ncreate an archive that contains all new and changed files since the original archive\n  was created. For this to work, the input file list and current directory must be the same as during the original zip operation.\n\nThere are some interesting options to play around with for zip, so please see man zip or the Ubuntu manpages online.\n", "Q: \"Awebrowser\" Pop Up Is Blocking My Internet Access With Ubuntu I have a Dell netbook with Ubuntu loaded onto it.

Does anybody have an idea where does Shotwell store its config files?\nThe problem is:\nI made a new installation of 12.10, and decided to use a new hdd for the home directory. I moved all pictures from the old hdd to the new one and copied all files from ~/.gconf/apps/shotwell to the new home folder, but shotwell doesn't see the folder with pictures.\n\nA: Shotwell 0.12.3 and earlier ->  ~/.shotwell \nShotwell 0.13.0 or later -> ~/.local/share/shotwell \nShotwell's FAQ page has much more detail and a better explanation of how to migrate to a new hard drive.\n\nA: Firstly, you won't be able to simply copy over the files in the .gconf directory, while your user is logged in on, as the running instance will take precedence, and changing the files out from under the process will have no effect.\nAnd Shotwell uses dconf to store its settings now, so you'll likely need to export them from the one installation, and then import them in the new installation. I don't know if Shotwell itself has any export/import feature for backing up and restoring settings, but some applications do.\nTo export/import from/to gconf while it is running, you can use the gconftool command line utility with it's --dump and --load options.

May be upgrade some package, or something, I don't know...\n\nA: Unfortunately the image you link to isn't the new spread, it's a mockup of what the new spread would look like. The spread in 12.10 is the same as it's always been. \nNo new spread (yet).\n\nA: The new spread you are hearing about is not for every window (The Super + W one), but for several windows from one application.\nWhen you have several windows of the same type (application/program) you can click on the app in the sidebar to get the new spread.\nSo for instance you have 4 firefox windows (not tabs) open.

I plan to develop multiple websites using Joomla. I'm using Ubuntu Desktop, and only need to access the sites and configuration files locally, while logged in to my user account.\nPreviously I tried this using tasksel and set up a LAMP server with files in /var/www, but then encountered problems with developing more than one site, and also permissions issues when editing code like CSS files.\nHow do I set up multiple Joomla sites, each in its own directory and database, for developing on a local desktop machine? Do I even need directories  outside of /home?\nRelated questions here (simplest way to add & edit files in /var/www) and here (avoid sudo when working in /var/www). This might even be a duplicate of one of those, unless there is a simpler solution for web developers.\n\nA: I would use Name-based Virtual Hosts support in Apache. \nFirst, you need to modify your /etc/hosts file to add some names which resolve to your local loopback interface:\n127.0.0.1       localhost.localdomain   localhost\n127.0.1.1       test1\n127.0.1.1       test2\n\nThen, in your home directory, you create a directory for your sites, say, sites and a sub-directory for each one:\n  sites\\\n  - test1\\\n  -- apache_config\n  -- www\\\n  - test2\\\n  -- apache_config\n  -- www\\\n\nEach apache_config file would define configuration for each of your virtual hosts:\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n ServerName test1\n DocumentRoot /home/username/sites/test1/www\n</VirtualHost>\n\nThen you symlink all the configs into /etc/apache2/sites-enabled\nln -s /home/username/sites/test1/www /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/001-test1\nln -s /home/username/sites/test2/www /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/002-test2\n\nRestart Apache.\nAnd that technically should be it - all your sites and their configs are in your home directory, editable by you. \nI haven't tested the steps, so it's just a general outline, but that's where I would start. I would avoid placing my work files into /var/www (or using Apache's default virtual host in general), and also I would avoid modifying Apache's main config file (/etc/apache2/apache2.conf) or the default virtual host file (the one in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default).\n", "Q: Scale / Spread shows windows from all workspaces in 12.10 I used Ubuntu Tweak to set up the lower left corner of my screen to activate scale/spread/show_windows/whatever_it's_called.

The problem is that release-upgrade-motd caches the message, which means that once it's been generated, changing /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades doesn't get rid of the message.\nSo the answer is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tell Update Manager what releases you want to be notified about.\n\n*sudo rm /var/lib/update-notifier/release-upgrade-available to get rid of the cached message.\n\nNote: For version 13.04 (and later), the path has changed.

Is there a way to enable/increase palm sensitivity?\n\nA: Besides the settings posted by mikewhatever, these settings seems to work very good for me:\nsynclient AreaLeftEdge=2000 \nsynclient AreaRightEdge=5000\n\n\nNote: those are the settings for my device... you need to find out\n  your device values.\nTry incrementing AreaRightEdge starting from zero until you can move\n  the cursor as \"normal\". AreaLeftEdge works the opposite, so from zero,\n  increment it until it doesn't move... then go back little by little\n  until the cursor moves as \"normal\" again. (at the end, AreaRightEdge\n  can not be lower than AreaLeftEdge).\n\nPerhaps Top and Bottom should be set as well... I will test that later, but at least Left/Right seems to do the job.\nAlso, in terms of \"sensitivity\", you can adjust these:\nFingerLow               = 25\nFingerHigh              = 50\n\nAs the above values, try to find those that are optimal for you.\n(Quoted from my answer to my own question:)\nSynaptics Touchpad : solving 2 finger problem triggered by resting palm\n\nA: AFAIK, palm sensing is not exposed through the graphical touchpad configuration tool. That said, you could try playing with it by using synclient.\nTo see what options are available, run synclient -l | grep -i palm\nPalmDetect              = 0\nPalmMinWidth            = 10\nPalmMinZ                = 200\n\nThose are the options I see, so, to activate the palm sensing, run synclient PalmDetect=1, and then experiment with the values of the other two.\n   \"PalmMinWidth\" \"integer\"\n          Minimum finger width at which touch is considered a palm.  Prop‐\n          erty: \"Synaptics Palm Dimensions\"\n\n   \"PalmMinZ\" \"integer\"\n          Minimum  finger  pressure  at  which touch is considered a palm.\n          Property: \"Synaptics Palm Dimensions\"\n\nWhen you find the right values, create a startup entry in Startup Applications with a command of the following form:\nsynclient PalmDetect=1 PalmMinWidth=xx PalmMinZ=yy\n\n...where xx and yy are the desired values.\n\nA: Adding to lepe's excellent answer: I was able to discover the AreaLeftEdge and AreaRightEdge numbers by using\n\nuser@t560:~$ xinput list\n\nand in there is a line like \n\n↳ SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad               id=11   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n\nand then taking the device number and feeding it to\n\nxinput --test 11\n\nand then dragging my finger across the pad, noting the numbers that corresponded to where I wanted the borders to be. \nIn my case (Thinkpad T560), the extremes of the pad are about 2200 and 4400, so I ended up setting 2700 and 3700 as my left and right edges.\n", "Q: Lubuntu 12.10 PPC-Can't Login after install I installed Lubuntu 12.10 PPC alt.

I just bought an Acer Aspire 3830TG, it comes with an integrated 1.3M HD Webcam.

This is the Card Reader I bought: http://dx.com/p/usb-universal-magnetic-stripe-credit-debit-card-bidirectional-track-2-swipe-reader-75-210bpi-25053\n\nA: Start by looking at the Wikipedia article on magstripe cards, which describes the common data layouts.\nYour reader is designed for track 2, which means it reads a series of digits and special characters.  From the product page, the device shows up on your system as a keyboard and enters the characters it sees.  Thus, the information you see when you swipe the card is exactly the information stored on track 2 of the card.  In this case, it looks like your customer ID number and nothing else.\nTo get more interesting bits such as names, you could try placing a physical shim inside the reader so that the head reads across track 1.  However, this might not work if the hardware only knows how to decode track 2.\nTo read the device programmatically, you can use stdin just like you would for a full keyboard.  The open-source StripeSnoop project is long dead, but you can probably glean some good tips from it nonetheless.  Magstripe technology hasn't changed in a long time.

And not my actual question but noted just in case it's relevant.\n\nA: Have you checked the network manager connection settings under [Network icon]->edit connections->[your connection]->edit->IPv4 settings?\nIf the DNS domains/addresses are hard coded to google's DNS there, you can try selecting the \"Automatic(DHCP)\" option in the \"Method\" dropdown and saving the connection?\nTry: dpkg-reconfigure bind9-host and then rebooting.\n\nA: For future reference, I've had the same problem and found my solution here: \nhttps://www.slightfuture.com/how-to/debian-dns-resolv.html\nIn short, it turns out conflicting services are fighting for your dns which means Network Manager doesn't always win. \n\napt-get purge rdnssd\napt-get purge resolvconf \nservice NetworkManager restart\n\nSorted it out for me. Note that your might not have rdnssd or resolvconf installed but if one of them IS, its redundant as Network Manager does their job anyway.\n", "Q: I just dual booted 12.10 into my asus g74sx installed nvidia drivers and now I cant see the dash and pretty much anything HELP!

It is like it should be? Because I had a lot of problems with formatting and partitions.\n\n*Should I keep it like this or format again and create partition for swap, boot and home like I see everyone talking about? It would be better for the PC?\nDon't know if you need this information but I have 6GB of RAM, and a i7 processor on a laptop.\n\nA: Everything looks perfectly normal. You probably don't even need swap with 6Gb of RAM unless you simulate nuclear reactions on your laptop.\nSo, as they said in that ad, you can reinstall your system with swap and separate /home partition if you want to, but if you don't want to then you don't have to. :)\nRegarding the sda5 being \"inside\" sda2: the latter is an extended partition - due to limitations of MBR partitioning scheme hard drive can contain at most 4 \"primary\" partitions. To overcome this restriction, an \"extended\" partition may be created which acts as a container for more partitions. This is absolutely normal.\nRegarding \"not yet supported\": I suppose this means crypt-luks partitions are not yet fully supported by gparted (maybe they can't be resized or something like that).

I find lvm a lot more flexible than regular partitions. My main machine is all using lvm, including / without any problem and very quick to resize/reconfigure Logical Volumes.\nTo use your current HD with lvm, you'll need to empty and format it.

It still isn't perfect but most people (myself included) have seen improved performance.  I also doctored the driver so that you can crank up your Tx power to 33 dBm if you want, instead of the 20 dBm that the stock driver allows (I can't promise that over-powering won't break you card, but I run mine at 30 quite often with no problems)\nYou can find the full installation instructions and source code at:  https://github.com/FreedomBen/rtl8188ce-linux-driver\n", "Q: How do I get an Atheros AR8162 working?

I am sure It is something I'm over looking, Thanks in advance.\n\nA: You said \"but tried with NAT bridge\". That doesn't make sense. You can either choose NAT or bridged. NAT means that the guest can access the network, but other computers (including the host) on the network don't see the guest VM. If you use bridged, it means that the guest gets it's own IP on the network, and that other computers can access it via the IP.\nSounds like you should be using bridged for what you want to do.\nYou'll then need to set up the guest operating system as a router, to do NAT translation from the virtual network card to forward packets to the modem.\nThen you'll change the host operation system's network settings to use the guest as a router. (You could also run DHCP on the guest to do this if you want to, but probably not worth the bother in this case).\nThe reason it just worked when you were using the modem on the guest, is that the NAT settings in Vmware automatically handle the NAT translation, and also configure the guest systems network settings via DHCP to use the host as a router. You don't get that with bridged.\n", "Q: \"A Disk Read Error\" while starting Windows after Ubuntu upgrade + Boot Repair I just upgraded to 12.10.

For eg, I failed many ties while installing FreeBSD on my laptop (and on a friend's laptop of same make & model), but it went smooth on both HDDs when I used them in my Desktop!\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Rescue GRUB problem 12.04 I have a problem with starting Ubuntu 12.04 LTS in a system which has a Windows 7 beside.\nthe GRUB cannot load and we see a massage which announces there is a problem with GRUB and there is a line like :\ngrub rescue >\n\nI can load the system with a GRUB recovery CD,but the loaded GRUB knows the other OS as a Windows Vista.\nHow can I fix it and have my two OS without needing CD.\n\nA: You can go through the wiki entry below and see whether it fixes the issue.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\n\nA: See this post my answer will work for fixing your problem but You must need Ubuntu Live disc.\n", "Q: I'm at the boot: prompt I have Ubuntu 10.04 on a bootable flash drive. It appears that the configuration file is not there anymore.  I need to know what the commands are to get me back into the system. I am sitting at the boot: prompt now I do know that vmlinuz works but then it says \"kernel panic\"\nand freezes the computer\n\nA: Try re-installing the system on the flash drive.\nMight possibly work if any files were incorrectly copied.\n", "Q: Booting Ubuntu with ReFIT fails I have, for quite some time, a dual boot setup on my MacBook Pro with MacOS X (minimal setup for emergencies) and Ubuntu (the system I use daily). I have ReFIT 0.14 installed. I am running this setup on this machine for well over a year without an issue.\nThis morning I rebooted my MacBook and when it came back up, it showed the ReFIT menu but the Linux entry would not work. When selecting it, all I would see is the penguin, and nothing else happens. Booting MacOS X works fine.\nI have access to the file system via fuse-ext2 on MacOS, and looking at the logs the laptop booted the last time on October 22nd. The only system update afterwards was this morning, but only for git, some xserver input module, ruby and macfanctld. No updates to grub or the kernel.\nI am a bit at a loss what to do, any pointers are greatly appreciated. I already reset the NVRAM and the SMC. I also tried syncing the partitions but it refused to do so due to \"analysis inconclusive\" (the MBR partition table shows two additional partitions at the end (Linux root and swap) that the GPT table does not, however the GRUB partition is shown in both).\n\nA: Until I read your last sentence, I thought this sounded like your GRUB installation had gone south; however, if your MBR partition table is showing partitions that aren't present in the GUID Partition Table (GPT), then that sounds like some serious partition table corruption. To diagnose this, both GPT and MBR data is required. You can get this in one go from the Boot Info Script. Run it from an emergency Linux boot and post a link to the RESULTS.txt file that it produces. Be aware that this is likely to be a highly system-specific problem.\nOTOH, if I've misunderstood, it could be that you need to re-install GRUB on the computer, or install another boot loader. I generally recommend using an EFI boot loader on Macs, especially if they don't boot Windows, since this enables you to do without all the flakiness associated with hybrid MBR configurations. OTOH, some models don't do well booting Linux in EFI mode because Linux doesn't correctly activate all their hardware (sometimes including video hardware). The only way to know for sure is to try it. I've written a Web page on EFI boot loaders for Linux, so you can peruse it and decide which one you want to install. Since rEFIt is already installed, you should just be able to drop the files into a subdirectory of the EFI directory on your ESP or the OS X boot drive (as in EFI/elilo or EFI/grub) and rEFIt should pick them up. (An exception is if you want to use the Linux kernel's EFI stub loader; for that, you should replace rEFIt with rEFInd.)\n", "Q: The NVIDIA X driver is not new enough to support the nvidia-settings Display Configuration page I've been trying without success to configure dual monitors on 12.04, I've installed the nvidia drivers but the gui tool doesn't seem to support my graphics card.\n\nAny Idea on how to resolve this?\nOh, and the output from \n$ lspci | grep VGA\n$ 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation G86 [Quadro NVS 290] (rev a1)\n\n\nA: Problem was solved for me by switching from \"(version current) [Recommended]\" to \"(post-release updates) (version current-updates)\"\n.\n\nA: I had the same problem and this worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open \"System Settings\" -> \"Additional drivers\"\n\n*Select \"NVIDIA accelerated graphics driver (version current)\" and click \"Activate\"\n\n*Reboot\n\n\nA: I had the same problem on Ubuntu 10.04.\nI had to install \"nvidia-settings - Tool of configuring the NVDIA graphics driver\" via Software Center.

I've ubuntu 10.04LTS installed, but I'm not able to play any sound. I don't know how to install sound drivers on my machine.\n\nA: Sound drivers should be detected automatically by Ubuntu although sometimes one of the channels is muted which causes nothing to play...\nGo into Terminal and type:   sudo apt-get pavucontrol\nThis will install a much better volume/sound manager that you can play with which will let you set up your sound driver a little easier...\n", "Q: Ubuntu for my Asus netbook I have an asus netbook with the following specs: \n      Processor: AMD C-50 Processor (2 CPUs), ~1.0GHz\n         Memory: 1024MB RAM\n\nAvailable OS Memory: 750MB RAM\n       Also have AMD HD 6250 as graphic card. \nI want to know what is the best ubuntu version for this hardware? i have tried ubuntu 12.04 and 11.10 and they both were sluggish. I had them installed as Wubi..Is it my machine that is just slow or its the wubi installation?(full install vs wubi install) but then again I heard ubuntu does not require high spec hardware..please help, windows starter is just painfully slow\n\nA: I have a much more underpowered machine than yours (512Mb RAM, 700MHz processor) and it runs Bodhi Linux (Ubuntu with the Enlightenment desktop) fine.\n\nA: Can't say how much wubi affects the speed - but your machine is that slow. Try Lubuntu, this one should work fine.\n\nA: Installing by Wubi simply launches the installer from Windows. \nThe version of Ubuntu you use is not as critical as what you put on it.Ubuntu relies on 3D graphics to draw the interface, which slows small systems down. There are many options for you if you are set on using Ubuntu. \nThe most noticeable resource hog on a netbook is the Unity shell (Compiz); if you want Ubuntu to run faster, I suggest using another desktop environment. \nYou have many options, like Xfce, OpenBox, and LXDE to name a few. Each of these has its perks and drawbacks, but the overarching theme is minimalism and resource-sparing performance. You won't have as many of the graphical luxuries as Unity offers, but your system will certainly run more quickly.\nIf you use a new desktop environment and decide that you need a Dash-like search and command center, you might try Gnome-do or Synapse , which has much of the same functionality with far less overhead.\n", "Q: Precise suddenly showing blank screen on bootup I've been using my system for quite some time now, and it's been working (more or less) fine.

Then, it just hangs there without ever getting around to showing the login screen. What's wrong?\n\nA: I noticed from checking your RSS feed that you have a graphics card installed in your computer. Your problem could be a caused by a failing graphics card. \n", "Q: How to connect to Windows PC in graphical mode? My basic desktop PC uses Ubuntu 12.04. However for work I need a few programs (like Hec-Ras) that I didn't succeed to run trough wine or play on linux.\nI thought of easy solution: to connect Windows PC in graphical mode. I can succeed with it using TeamViewer, however I'd like to connect trough my local network. How do I achieve that?\nThanks in advance,\nMisery\n\nA: I suggest to try tightvnc.  TightVNC is a free remote control software package. With TightVNC, you can see the desktop of a remote machine and control it.\n\nA: You can just use Teamviewer for Linux if you are familiar with it.  \nOtherwise you have 2 options, RDP or VNC.  \nRDP is windows Remote desktop sharing and there are linux clients for it like rdesktop. Advantage of RDP is windows side setup is relatively easier. \nInstall the rdesktop package, then from a terminal window use the following command line:\nrdesktop -u REMOTE_USER_NAME -g 1024x768 REMOTE_HOST\n\nIt opens a remote session for the REMOTE_USER_NAME on the REMOTE_HOST. The screen (window) resolution is set through the -g parameter.\nVNC is more well known on Linux. There are several servers you can use on Windows(UltraVNC  is one that I have some experience with) to share your desktop and then connect using the inbuild VNC client in Ubuntu. \n\nA: You can use rdesktop to access windows PCs from a linux box. or check whether your distribution is having remote desktop client. Create a new connection in that and use the protocol remote desktop protocol.\n", "Q: Zotero error in LibreOffice I installed Zotero standalone in 12.10 64-bit. Some problems which I managed to fix.

I am on an Asus Zenbook UX32VD in Ubuntu 12.10. Both in 12.04 and 12.10 I haven't been able to change the mouse speed (i.e. the \"sensitivity\" in the mouse/touchpad dialog). I can change the slider, but nothing changes.\nThis is a big problem for me, since the mouse speed is somewhat slow. Any suggestions?\nThe problem is both for the touchpad and mouse.\n\nA: You can use these scripts to set the touchpad and mouse speed each systemstart:\n#!/bin/sh\nTP=$(xinput --list --short|grep -i touchpad|cut -f 1 | cut -d\" \" -f 5-|sed 's/\\s\\+$//g')\nxinput --set-prop \"$TP\" \"Device Accel Constant Deceleration\" 1.5\nxinput --set-prop \"$TP\" \"Device Accel Velocity Scaling\" 10\n\nFor me, I think 1.5 and 10 are suitable values for the touchpad.\n\nI use a Logitech usb mouse too.\nSo for a Logitech mouse use this script:\n#!/bin/sh\nMOUSE=$(xinput --list --short|grep -i Logitech| cut -f 1|cut -d\" \" -f 5-|sed 's/\\s\\+$//g')\nxinput --set-prop \"$MOUSE\" \"Device Accel Constant Deceleration\" 1.2\nxinput --set-prop \"$MOUSE\" \"Device Accel Velocity Scaling\" 10\n\nFor me, I think 1.2 and 10 are suitable values for the mouse.\nI created a project on Github:\nhttps://github.com/rubo77/mouse-speed\n\nA: Running sudo xset m 1 1 worked for me. \nMy mouse speed now behaves in a normal behaviour like in Windows platform. \n\nA: Ubuntu 12.10 64-bit, Logitech cordless TrackMan\nxinput did nothing for me.\nxset q\n\nto check settings\nxset mouse 3 0\n\nThis sets the acceleration to 3 and the threshold to zero. Not great settings but better than before.\nIf you want to use fractional value, you can enter fraction (i.e. 3/2) instead of floating point number.\nThe man page says the settings will be lost on logout/reboot.\n\nA: The above mentioned \"Device Accel ...\" options do not exist on my machine. Lenovo T440s running Ubuntu 18.04\nInstead, I have success using these:\nxinput --set-prop \"TPPS/2 IBM TrackPoint\" \"Coordinate Transformation Matrix\" 0.5 0 0 0 0.5 0 0 0 1\n\nThe original \"Coordinate Transformation Matrix was 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 and I have now half the speed, which is slow enough for me.\nWith this syntax, we can adjust horizontal and vertical speed separately.\n\nA: I've fine-tuned deceleration by closing my eyes, before moving pointer to a certain place on the screen. After 5 adjustments, now my mouse moves that much as I'm expecting.\nThat's the line I'm using right now:\nxinput --set-prop \"Bluetooth Mouse M557\" \"Device Accel Constant Deceleration\" 2.3\n\nA: First we need to identify the input device ID to change the speed/sensitivity. Open a terminal and run this command: \nxinput --list --short\n\noutput:\nabcd@abcd-abcde:~$ xinput --list --short\n\nVirtual core pointer\n\n↳ SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad                id=11   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n\n↳ Logitech USB RECEIVER                     id=12   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n\nMy pointing devices are a Logitech USB RECEIVER and a Synaptics TouchPad.\nTo list out device properties: \nxinput --list-props \"SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\"\n\nEDIT: \nAnother option:\nxinput --list-props 11 as 11 is the number that is shown above in its parent property (SynPS/2 Synaptic TouchPad).\nNow reduce it's property values to suit your need:\nDevice Accel Constant Deceleration (267):   2.500000\n\nusing this command:\nxinput --set-prop \"SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\" \"Device Accel Constant Deceleration\" 1.5\n\nEDIT: \nAnother option:\n    xinput --set-prop 11 267 1.5 where 11 is the device, just like from above, 267 is the id of the device property (Device Accel Constant Decleration) as you can see when device 11 is being listed all of properties being attached, and finally 1.5 is your desired speed.\nYou may have to play around with this number a bit to set it exactly as you need.\nIf you need to set this value automatically every time Ubuntu starts then:\ncreate a .sh file\n#!/bin/sh\n\nxinput --set-prop \"SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\" \"Device Accel Constant Deceleration\" 1.5\n\nchange the file to executable :\nchmod +x\n\nand Put this in the start-up applications list. \nSource : Configuring Mouse Speed manually\n\nA: I used the 'simple' profile to increase the mouse resolution without acceleration. \n#!/bin/bash\n\ndevice=\"Dell Dell USB Optical Mouse\"\nresolution_percent=\"241\" # Greater than 100, use constant deceleration otherwise with profile -1. \n\nxinput set-prop \"$device\" \"Device Accel Profile\" 4 # Simple profile with threshold 0 allows constant scaling up\nxinput set-ptr-feedback \"$device\" 0 \"$resolution_percent\" 100 # Set threshold to 0 and acceleration to $resolution_percent/100\n\nYou'll have to modify the script by using your particular device name. You can look that up by running xinput without arguments. Also the script has to be run each time the mouse is connected or when you start the system. \n\nA: Just want to add to the previous answers that it's possible that there won't be \"Device Accel Constant Deceleration\" property. For example, I don't have it for Logitech G600 in Kubuntu 17.04. But there is\n\"Coordinate Transformation Matrix\" which is even more power\n\nA: As mentioned by others acceleration is not the same as speed. Until recently I used the Coordinate Transformation Matrix setting to scale the mouse velocity and disabled mouse acceleration with xinput. But this comes with its own issues - I had issues in Blender when doing mouse middle button drags to rotate the scene - The cursor was jumping as soon as I released the button. There is an open issue.\nBut I found a way to directly set the DPI of the mouse. It is possible to create a setting file here:\nsudo vim /etc/udev/hwdb.d/50-mouse-dpi.hwdb\n\nWith the following content - Replace <name-of-the-device> with the name shown in xinput (e.g. \"Logitech G700s Rechargeable Gaming Mouse\").\nmouse:*:name:<name-of-the-device>:\n MOUSE_DPI=320\n\nTo apply the settings execute\nsudo systemd-hwdb update && sudo udevadm trigger\n\nRepeat until you find a DPI value which makes you happy.\n\nA: My Logitech MX518 mouse was too slow on Ubuntu 18.04. I tried to set Accel speed prop to max (1), but it did not speed it enough.\nAfter some more searching, found lomoco (Logitech Mouse Control) and installed it with\nsudo apt install lomoco\n\nThe man page is here http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man1/lomoco.1.html\nThe manual is good, but for a restless soul, this is what I did:\nlomoco --scan\n\nGot this as one of the output lines. c051 is the product ID.\n002.004: 046d:c051 MX518 Optical Mouse (M-BS81A) Caps: RES\n\nThen set the sensitivity\nsudo lomoco -p c051 --1600\n\nAnd got a fast mouse.\n\nA: I'm running 16.04 on my Mac and xinput worked fine with Magic Mouse. The only thing I needed to do was run it as root:\nsudo xinput --set-prop 14 271 3.0 \n\n(I'm impressed how speedy was this mouse)\n\nA: Using a live environment of 19.10, the following will set the max mouse speed.\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.mouse speed 1.0\n\nTo show all settings:\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ gsettings list-recursively org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.mouse\norg.gnome.desktop.peripherals.mouse middle-click-emulation false\norg.gnome.desktop.peripherals.mouse natural-scroll false\norg.gnome.desktop.peripherals.mouse speed 0.5\norg.gnome.desktop.peripherals.mouse accel-profile 'default'\norg.gnome.desktop.peripherals.mouse left-handed false\n\n\nA: I am running ubuntu 21.04 and changing the mouse speed is eeeeeazyyyy. This is not 12.10, but this is how you do it on 21.04 it will probably work on 12.10 if 12.10 is the same way. Here's how.\nClick on the applications icon in the bottom left corner of the screen.\nSearch for Settings.\nClick on Settings and go to Mouse & Touchpad.\nThere, it will have a Mouse Speed slider; slide it up like so.\n\nThat should do the trick if your gui is the same or similar.\n", "Q: Can't access my old email in Thunderbird after upgrading to 12.10 I was using Thunderbird on 12.04 and upgraded to 12.10 with the option that keeps my current data 3 days ago.

But my other files like documents and photos are there.\nIs there a way I can recover my old email?\n\nA: I had a similar problem with Thunderbird Greying out and than everafter displaying some of my account setup but none of my mail.  On looking at the mail storage links I noticed that Ubuntu made a huge change that broke all my folder allocations.  I use Ubuntu at home and Portable Thunderbird at work where I use a Windows box. So I store my mail on the portable drive with the PortableApps on it so that I can carry it from home to work and back again. In both systems, Thunderbird points to the same directory on that portable drive.  Ubuntu has changed the way this works as follows:\nInstead of: /media/drivename/\nIn 12.10 it's: /media/username/drivename/\nWhich means I had to manually edit every folder location in my Thunderbird settings.

Every so often I'll bash out a bash script and it strikes me there are a few ways of setting a variable:\nkey=value\nenv key=value\nexport key=value\n\nWhen you're inside a script or a single command (for instance, I'll often chain a variable with a Wine launcher to set the right Wine prefix) these seem to be completely interchangeable  but surely that can't be the case.\nWhat's the difference between these three methods and can you give me an example of when I would specifically want to use each one?\nDefinitely related to What is the difference between `VAR=...` and `export VAR=...`? but I want to know how env fits into this too, and some examples showing the benefits of each would be nice too :)\n\nA: Let us consider a specific example. The grep command uses an environment variable called GREP_OPTIONS to set default options.\nNow. Given that the file test.txt contains the following lines:\nline one\nline two\n\nrunning the command grep one test.txt will return\nline one\n\nIf you run grep with the -v option, it will return the non-matching lines, so the output will be\nline two\n\nWe will now try to set the option with an environmental variable.\n\n*\n\n*Environment variables set without export will not be inherited in the environment of the commands you are calling.\nGREP_OPTIONS='-v'\ngrep one test.txt\n\nThe result:\nline one\n\nObviously, the option -v did not get passed to grep.\nYou want to use this form when you are setting a variable only for the shell to use, for example in for i in * ; do you do not want to export $i.\n\n\n*However, the variable is passed on to the environment of that particular command line, so you can do\nGREP_OPTIONS='-v' grep one test.txt\n\nwhich will return the expected\nline two\n\nYou use this form to temporarily change the environment of this particular instance of the program launched.\n\n\n*Exporting a variable causes the variable to be inherited:\nexport GREP_OPTIONS='-v'\ngrep one test.txt\n\nreturns now\nline two\n\nThis is the most common way of setting variables for use of subsequently started processes in a shell\n\n\n*This was all done in bash. export is a bash builtin; VAR=whatever is bash syntax. env, on another hand, is a program in itself. When env is called, following things happen:\n\n*\n\n*The command env gets executed as a new process\n\n*env modifies the environment, and\n\n*calls the command that was provided as an argument. The env process is replaced by the command process.\n\nExample:\nenv GREP_OPTIONS='-v' grep one test.txt\n\nThis command will launch two new processes: (i) env and (ii) grep (actually, the second process will replace the first one). From the point of view of the grep process, the result is exactly the same as running\nGREP_OPTIONS='-v' grep one test.txt\n\nHowever, you can use this idiom if you are outside of bash or don't want to launch another shell (for example, when you are using the exec() family of functions rather than the system() call).\nAdditional note on #!/usr/bin/env\nThis is also why the idiom #!/usr/bin/env interpreter is used rather than #!/usr/bin/interpreter. env does not require a full path to a program, because it uses the execvp() function which searches through the PATH variable just like a shell does, and then replaces  itself by the command run. Thus, it can be used to find out where an interpreter (like perl or python) \"sits\" on the path.\nIt also means that by modifying the current path you can influence which python variant will be called. This makes the following possible:\necho -e '#!/usr/bin/bash\\n\\necho I am an evil interpreter!' > python\nchmod a+x ./python\nexport PATH=.\npython\n\ninstead of running Python, will result in\nI am an evil interpreter!\n\n", "Q: missing resolution in ubuntu 12.04 lts I have a NVida GT 630M in my laptop. I tried to install the graphics driver by using the following command :\nsudo nvidia\n\nAfter installing I face a serious problem with the resolution:\nThe only one available is 640*480. What should I do, to have my graphical device correctly installed.\n\nA: The normal way to install the NVidia drivers in 12.04 is with the restricted drivers manager. Go to System Settings->Additional Drivers and install the drivers from there. If you want to do it from the terminal the command would be:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current nvidia-settings\n\n", "Q: 12.04 hangs at \"checking battery state\" My 12.04 system hangs at \"Checking battery state\".

I have an integrated graphics card \"Intel Corporation Mobile 4 chipset Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 07)\". \nSo I cannot install Nvidia drivers as everyone else suggests.

The problem that there was the existence of /etc/init/lightdm.override. Inside the file was the word manual.  \nThis was how it was present on install of lightdm, and then running 'sudo dpkg reconfigure lightdm'. Upon removing this file the system went to the login screen with no problems!\n\nA: Worked for me with Ctrl+Alt+F1 and then login.\nAfter this, I typed:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall lightdm\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm\n\nAfter this, I rebooted system and worked fine.\n\nA: A solution is available here\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1606130\nDisplay manager was looking for gdm instead of lightdm.\n\nA: The disk was full. \nIt worked for me with Ctrl+Alt+F1 and then login. After this, I typed\nsudo df -H\n\nIt showed me 100% hard disk full. I made some space by deleting the unnecessary files. \nsudo reboot\n\n\nA: In my case it didn't have anything to do with lightdm or battery state. It was the nvidia driver. I had to execute\napt-get remove --purge nvidia-3*\n\nto remove ALL nvidia related packages. Then I restarted, and the desktop loaded in standard graphic mode. Then I reinstalled nvidia by \napt-get install nvidia-current\n\nand after reboot, nvidia drivers worked again.\n\nA: I have had this problem for more than 8 months now; it put me off using Ubuntu because the solutions never worked for all scenarios. I use a Lenovo x301.\nThe only solution I've found that seems to fix across all scenarios is the one below.

The mail server has OS Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and the new server that I set up is also on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. Are there any commands that can help me achieve this?\nThe server runs Postfix MTA\n\nA: Without more specific info about which email server you are using it's gonna be rather difficult to answer.\nOne thing you can be interested in is imapsync. \nhttp://www.howtoforge.com/how-to-migrate-mailboxes-between-imap-servers-with-imapsync\nHowever, it doesn't support migration of a whole server but rather a separate mailbox.\nWhen it comes to migration of a whole email server it all depends on the format you are keeping your mailboxes. Dovecot's wiki offer a detailed guide about migration of email. http://wiki.dovecot.org/Migration. The simplest way is probably a rsync between two folders / network shares.

Now, How do I forward my wired internet connection to N7? I think I must run some proxy server to forward all requests to eth0 interface.

I need to be able to mount and read on the fly a compressed dd image. I think that cloop is what I need. But I don't see it in /lib/modules and, anyway, I'd like to know how it works first.\nAnybody has already managed to mount a compressed image and read it on the fly via cloop?\n\nA: Unfortunately Ubuntu 12.04 doesn't include the cloop.ko module needed to have a compressed loopback device. However, it's very easy to add it to the running kernel.\nI found it on this page (not sure if it's the latest version but compiles and works well), so I wget'd and uncompressed this file. The configure seems to be already included inside the Makefile so running:\nmake\n\nis enough to build the module correctly. The package also contains the advfs utility, the original name for the command create_compressed_fs whose synopsis can be found here.\nI copied the modules in /lib/modules with:\nsudo cp cloop.ko /lib/modules/`uname -r`\n\nbut this step is not mandatory. Then one can choose to use the advfs or install the ubuntu package cloop-utils that provides the same utility with another name. I chose the package option because it's cleaner (I also suggest to install pv to have a nice progress bar):\nsudo aptitude install cloop-utils pv\n\nNow the compressed image can be created through the create_compressed_fs utility, and can be subsequently assigned to the /dev/clooop0 device passing the filename as parameter to the module cloop.ko. Honestly I didn't find a better way to pass the filename to the cloop module and this poses a problem if one wants to mount multiple compressed images in different time frames. However, for the moment I don't have this problem, so this script has been more than adequate for my needs.\n#/bin/sh -e\n\nINPUTDEVICE=\"/dev/sda1\"\nOUTPUTFILE=\"/tmp/dev-sda1.cloop.img\"\nBLOCKSIZE=\"1048576\"\nNUMBLOCKS=\"2000\"\nCOMPRESSIONLEVEL=\"9\"\n#COMPRESSIONLEVEL=\"-1\" # for 7zip compression (untested)\nCLOOPLOGFILE=\"/tmp/cloop-creation.log\"\nCLOOPBLOCKSIZE=\"64K\"\n\ndd if=\"$INPUTDEVICE\"  bs=\"$BLOCKSIZE\" count=\"$NUMBLOCKS\" | pv -s \"$((NUMBLOCKS * BLOCKSIZE))\" -Wpetr | create_compressed_fs -L \"$COMPRESSIONLEVEL\" -B \"$CLOOPBLOCKSIZE\" -s \"$NUMBLOCKS\"M - \"$OUTPUTFILE\" > \"$CLOOPLOGFILE\" 2>&1\n\ninsmod /lib/modules/`uname -r`/cloop.ko file=\"$OUTPUTFILE\"\n\nmount -o ro /dev/cloop0 /mnt/cloop\n\nSome other information can be found on the Knoppix wiki about cloop devices, here.\n", "Q: How to clone displays with my laptop and an external HD Monitor I have been trying to connect my laptop to an external monitor (different resolutions).

I merely want both displays to show the exact same image. I assume that the mirror option would do this but it is disabled.\n\nA: I'm not sure I understood the question well, but to change the view modes for the screen, you can use xrandr. With that you can flip the screen, invert the output (upside down, mirrored), etc. (and it also handles dual screens? maybe?)\nGood luck!\n\nA: After some trial and error I managed to find the solution.\nThe mirror displays option will only be available if both monitors are set to use the same resolution.\n", "Q: Why is \"http://my.archive.ubuntu.com\" very slow?

(Cannot edit tags of files from external drive) I do not have enough understanding of this issue for the moment but please bear with me and I'll edit/improve the question to make it of more general scope as soon as I get proper help and I better understand the matter. \nSo, I keep my music files on an external (Samsung, fat32) drive  and use Foobar2000 with Wine to edit their tags (get tags from freedb, among other things)\nNow I cannot do that anymore.

Ask a new question with details on the error messages and your proxy configuration.\n\nA: This might seem not proper way but it works take a terminal and run \nsudo apt-get install emacs \nSince proxy is not working you will get error messages , see at the end of error messages you can see like this \nFailed to fetch http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/e/emacsen-common/emacsen-common_2.0.3_all.deb  Could not resolve 'in.archive.ubuntu.com'\nFailed to fetch http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/e/emacs23-non-dfsg/emacs23-common-non-dfsg_23.4+1-1_all.deb  Could not resolve 'in.archive.ubuntu.com'\n......\nThis are the files that are need too install emacs, if you are patient enough copy paste each link and download the files into a folder. \nthen copy the entire files to /var/cache/apt/archives then again run \nsudo apt-get install emacs, it should work. \nAnd please note this might not work if you havnt never run a successful sudo apt-get update\n", "Q: Where to configure synaptics touchpad to use inverted two finger scrolling? I want to configure my synaptics touchpad to user inverted scrolling with two fingers.\nWhere to configure synaptics for this in Ubuntu 12.04?\n\nA: It is relatively straightforward to do this, but it may not work for all touchpads, although it worked for my Synaptics Touchpad on my old laptop. I began experimenting with mine and using xinput, etc, and did mostly the same as this useful article here. \nFirstly, run xinput to list all your devices, and note the id of your touchpad.\n↳ SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad                id=11   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n\nNow to get your button map for the device number found:\nxinput get-button-map 11\n\nwhich should return something like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 \n\nNow, just reversing 4 and 5 should invert the 2 finger scrolling (at least it does on my system). In the following command, just remember to use your device hardware id (not my example 11) and leave spaces between the numbers after the device number: \nxinput set-button-map 11 1 2 3 5 4 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\n\nNow with xinput get-button-map 11 the button map should be\n1 2 3 5 4 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 \n\nNow, check it in your web browser. This of course only sets it temporarily, so it is probably easiest to add it as a startup item rather than messing with xorg. Just create a new startup item and add the whole of the above xinput set-button-map command in it. It is critical that there are spaces between the numbers after your device number, and of course use the actual device name of your hardware, not my example. \nAgain, see the article and Ubuntu forums for more information and discussion- you can probably experiment and invert a lot of the other functions of the touchpad as well; you can reset your experimentation (which is temporary anyway, unless you put a command in startup) by just simply placing the numbers in order again:\nxinput set-button-map 11 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\n\n\nA: The Arch Linux Wiki has a good tutorial at:\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Synaptics_Touchpad#Configuration\nThe only major requirement is an understanding of how to edit configuration files.\nThe main point to focus on at this URL is setting VertScrollDelta (and HorizScrollDelta if you enabled horizontal scrolling) to a negative value. What I do is take the previous value of this variable and set it to itself with a minus sign in front of it (e.g. instead of 106, use -106).\nIf Linux isn't your expertise, I'd suggest you read the entire article to gain a basic understanding of what to do.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I suppose the best way to do this is by using dconf-editor:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*Type in deconf-editor and hit Enter\n\n*Now go to org>gnome>settings-daemon>peripherals>touchpad and now you can make most of the changes you want\n\n\nHere's a screenshot of deconf-editor:\n\n\nA: For inverted scrolling, open gedit (or your favourite text editor) and type this:\npointer = 1 2 3 5 4 7 6 8 9 10 11 12\nThis enable vertical and horizontal natural scrolling (i.e. inverted scrolling). 4 and 5 interchanged is for inverted vertical. 6 and 7 interchanged is for inverted horizontal. Now, save this file as .Xmodmap in your home folder.\nNext, for 2 finger scrolling, open Mouse and Touchpad Settings in System Settings, go to the Touchpad tab and check the box which says Two-finger scrolling. The screenshot below will show you this.\n\n\nA: For inverted scrolling, there an indicator you can install at https://launchpad.net/~zedtux/+archive/naturalscrolling.\nIn summary : \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:zedtux/naturalscrolling\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install naturalscrolling\n\nThen run Natural Scrolling from your Dash. An indicator icon will appear where you can invert scrolling on a per-device basis (e.g. invert your trackapd, but don't invert your bluetooth mouse).\n\n\nA: To use reverted/inverted/natural scrolling (whatever you call it), create file containing these line, right click, properties, and make it executable, add the file to Startup Application, and reboot. \n#!/bin/sh\nDEV_NO=`xinput list | grep \"SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\" | sed 's/.*id=\\([0-9]*\\).*/\\1/g'`\nPROP_NO=`xinput list-props ${DEV_NO} | grep \"Synaptics Scrolling Distance\" | sed 's/.*(\\([0-9]*\\)).*/\\1/g'`\nxinput set-prop ${DEV_NO} ${PROP_NO} -106 -106\n\ndirect link download https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75813759/.nat\n", "Q: Kubuntu permanent install won't attach sound card I installed Kubuntu Live version and sound card visible in the volume/mixer panel.

It should be -rw-r--r--\nTo do so in a terminal ls -la |grep .bash, all 3 files should have the above permissions.\nOtherwise try deleting .bash_history, restart & see if a history is then written \nNote that the history is only written once the terminal is closed or quit. \n\nA: As commented above, this can be fixed with root->user ownership changes. Initial permissions may be from -rw-r--r-- or any other variation and root ownership.\nIn my case I only had .bash_history owned by root but it is all of .bash_* that must be owned by user.\n", "Q: Nvidia Graphic installed?

I have just a basic understanding of this system so feel free to talk down to me or explain this like you would to a 5 year old. \nLet's start from the beginning. My son has a computer built by an IT friend of mine (we moved so he can't help any more). It had Windows XP running on it and it just stopped working correctly. This same friend had built a laptop for me with Ubuntu which I liked so I thought I'd put a new OS on my sons computer and it may work better. I downloaded Ubuntu 12.10 onto a USB drive and loaded it onto his computer. I followed all the prompts, it installed, I restarted the computer, it gives me the option of which OS to pick. I pick Ubuntu and it seemingly loads. The desktop comes up with just the basic pinkish Ubuntu background but that is it. There are no icons. I can't right click anywhere to create a file. Left clicking the mouse does not create a square when moved. Alt + F2 doesn't do anything. I can open a terminal but any of the commands I have seen in previous threads do not correct any issues. \nWhat else can I do, or what resources are available to fix this problem? I don't know if there are additional files on the USB drive that I need to access or what.\nAlso, one of the problems we were having with my sons computer is that windows would only load to a blank screen. It runs accordingly in safemode and my install of Ubuntu was through safemode of Windows XP. \n\nA: *\n\n*If you're able to boot, but after login Unity doesn't load: It's possible that your GPU drivers are interfering; or that your hw isn't 3d-capable. Please insert the LiveDVD and post the result of the following command (press CTRL+ALT+T) :\n/usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If you're using nVidia drivers: Run the following commands to remove them, and reboot:\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia-current\nsudo apt-get remove nvidia-current-updates\nsudo apt-get remove nvidia-experimental-304\nOr just install/open Synaptic and search for nvidia, delete everything that you see now.\nReboot the system. See if everything's working. Run this command to check if Unity-3D will work:\n/usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p\n\nReboot again. Reinstall latest nVidia drivers:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current-updates\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If using AMD/ATI GPU drivers: Run the following command to remove them, and reboot:\nsudo apt-get purge fglrx\n\nDon't reinstall them as ATI cards currently don't support Unity-3D.\n\n*If you're unable to boot: Insert a Ubuntu 12.10 Live-CD/DVD and run the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\nBoot-Repair will launch.

Is there a way to have the number of workspaces automatically increase and decrease intelligently?\nFor example: I set a minimum of 2 workspaces, but if I have windows on those workspaces, a 3rd workspace is automatically created. If I close out the windows on workspace 2, then workspace 3 is removed.\n\nA: I am guessing you are using Unity. This idea is a feature in the Gnome-3 desktop environment see the right column on the image below - workspaces are added and removed as necessary. In this case there are two, but if the user puts something in the second workspace, a third one is created.). .\nTo install the gnome-shell, use these commands here:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install and use the latest version of GNOME?\nThen, log-out and before you log back in, change your desktop by clicking on the Ubuntu icon near your login name.

Is there a command to mount a folder from one partition to my main partition?\nExample of what I'd like to do, which obviously doesn't work:\nmount /media/tc1/folder /home/dvad/home\nIf not by using a command, is there another way I can do this?\n\nA: Yes but before I go that far, couldn't you just symlink?\nln -s /media/tc1/folder ~/home\n\nThis link is just a file that is interpreted. It is automatically permanent (until you delete the file).\nFailing that you can use mount as you described but the syntax is slightly different:\nmount --bind /media/tc1/folder /home/dvad/home\n\nThis is not permanent at all, and will be nuked by a restart. If you want it to persist, you'll need something in your /etc/fstab like this:\n/media/tc1/folder    /home/dvad/home    none    bind\n\nIf you're trying a mount and it's not working, you should make sure that the block-level device is mounted. You can't directly mount a subdirectory of a partition without first mounting the partition.\n\nA: An alternative to mount:\nbindfs --no-allow-other /media/tc1/folder /home/dvad/home\n\nRequires sudo apt-install bindfs.\nLike with mount, this will be a (non-permanent) actual mount point, i.e. for instance version-control systems will not only track it as a symbolic reference, but see the files “in there”. However like for ln -s, you do not need superuser permissions for bindfs as you would for mount.\nUnmount with fusermount -u /home/dvad/home (or by restarting).\n", "Q: Why upgrade from LTS to a X.10 version \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat’s the difference between a Long Term Support Release and a Normal Release? \n\nrecently in an OMGubuntu's article i saw some comments about the reason of the selection of ubuntu 12.10 over 12.04 LTS for the new System76's All in One. One of the comments said more or less \"Why using 12.10 with 1.5 years of support over the 5 years the LTS offer?\". Until now i thought the X.10 version was more complete, but with this point of view of the LTS, the LTS will in some moment be more complete than 12.10 i guess.\nShould i stick with the LTS or upgrade to 12.10 and why?\n\nA: This is really a questions of personal preference. \nThe non-LTS releases which also consist of some .04 releases have shorter periods of support, but often have 'new' features that the LTS releases do not.\nFor me I usually update myself to the latest on my personal primary laptop, go to testing on my testing laptop and depending on the features stay on the LTS for servers. For my work laptop I usually upgrade to the most recent, but I do not always have time to do it immediately upon release.\nIn summary:\nIf you want stability and want long term support then go with an LTS\nIf you want cutting edge, but still stable, go with the latest release\n", "Q: Apache / MySql is not running.

It's specially annoying given that it used to work fine before.\n\nA: If you are using the latest nvidia drivers, then I'm sorry to inform you that there is no fix currently.

Currently only the front two (front l+r) are working. I'm running a fresh install of 12.10. Headphones work fine though. Doesn't matter which program is producing audio either.\n\nA: The subwoofer and rear speakers are not detected in Debian. You need to correctly assign the pins using hdajackretask.

Just install it using the Linux PAE kernel (installed by default) and everything will run exactly the same. PAE stands for Physical Address Extension, and it is the technology that allows the software to access over 4GB of RAM.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_Address_Extension\n\nA: Yes it will work but your system won't be in full use. So you may find that it won't be able to use as much RAM as your laptop has and the processor ability. Basically it won't perform as well as 64bit would. \nI think more the question is here is how to install the ia32-libs? What errors are you getting? \n", "Q: How can I get a single-click workspace switcher? \nPossible Duplicate:\nIs there a command for the “Workspace Switcher”? \n\nEasy workspace switching has always been one of the strongest feature of linux. It's a huge productivity boost not unlike having multiple monitors but without the need to carry a large desk and monitors with you all the time :-) Good implementations have existed in different desktop environments since the early 90s. \nI thought OSX was catching up when they came up with 'spaces' but they made this very slow two steps plus animations process that made working with multiple 'spaces' quite a pain. To my horror it seems Ubuntu (in my case 12.04) copied this OSX UI and made it the default.\nIs there a way to install a one click workspace switcher? It would be neat if it dynamically showed me an image of the desktops like it used to, but mainly it just has to be single-click.\nI know there are keyboard shortcuts but I also need a solution for when my hands are not on the keyboard.\nThe other problem with the current workspace switcher is that when I have a lot of apps opened, it gets pushed down to the 'stacked icons' part of the dock and it then becomes an even slower process to change workspace. I can't seem to be able to move this icon (I guess another question would be how to do this). As one of the most often used dock icon, shouldn't it be at the top of the dock?\nEDIT: I was just told by this site to explain how this is different from other questions about workspace switchers. The important thing is that it has to to be a single-click mouse manipulation (as it has been in Unix type desktops since about 1995). Other questions only mention keyboard shortcuts or 2 or more steps solutions. To me this is unacceptable for an action as frequent as desktop switching.\n\nA: Unfortunately I do not know of any alternative workspace switchers besides a simple drop down menu. As with nearly and change to the visual components of Ubuntu you will need CompizConfig Settings Manager. It is installable from the Ubuntu software centre by searching \"Compiz.\" CompizConfig Settings Manager is also known as CCSM.\nOnce you have installed CCSM open it by searching in the dash for \"compiz.\" Once open navigate down to the Expo plug-in. Expo is the workspace switching plug-in. All settings pertaining to it are located there. \n\nFirst to tackle your single click to exit expo: The opening tab in Expo is the bindings tab you will want to set your exit expo button to which ever you want. I have it kept on the default left click but you can choose to use any mouse button you want. If you set it to left click you will have to change the drag and drop binding. If you never use drag and drop windows in the workspace switcher simply disable it.\nAnd as a final note for productivity. It can be much more useful if you set the Expo key, Expo button, and expo edge. These will be the bindings that initiate the switcher. For instance I have my workspace edge set to bottom right so that when I'm primarily doing things on my mouse I can easily switch workspaces for multitasking. This can be seen in Mac and Linux Mint by having the switcher initiated by moving the mouse to the top right corner. \nI hope that helps you out.\n\nA: If you have a specific application open on another workspace, simply clicking on its icon in the launcher will indeed take you straight to that workspace.\nAs far as being able to move the workspace switcher position on the launcher, no you can't in 12.04, but this feature has been added in to 12.10.  It's a real shame they didn't add this feature for 12.04 LTS, but I guess there was only so much they could achieve in the given time.\n", "Q: Why will upgrading Ubuntu cause problems? This is a general question about the changes that occurs in the development of Ubuntu. I want to know if Ubuntu, let's say 12.04, is working fine on my laptop. Why when I upgrade it to a newer version 12.10, sometimes it will not work? \nFor example, a black screen, boot hang ups, etc. Isn't 12.10 an exact copy of 12.04 but with added support to some new hardwares and new cool stuff like amazon lens?\n\nA: No, it is not 12.04 with just added hardware support and some cool new stuff. Ubuntu LTS versions are designed to be very stable, and long lasting. LTS versions have a Complete Polish, and are the least likely to have any problems or difficulties running.\nThe versions between LTS are like \"testing\" versions. The developers are trying out different software, and Ubuntu 12.10 has changed software a lot. For example 12.10 comes with Python 3 instead of Python 2.7. This has a large impact on the programs that may or may not run. The Ubuntu versions between LTS are like the Ubuntu playground- they try out different things, and do a lot of testing, so that when the next time for an LTS comes (Ubuntu 14.04), then hopefully they will have something that works great again.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_%28operating_system%29\n\nA: The only things that might not work is Unity and AMD/ATI or nVidia drivers.\nUse this command to find if Unity will work:\n$ /usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p\nUnity-2D has been discontinued. So, you'll have to remove nVidia & ATI drivers before you install.\nTo remove ATI GPU drivers:\n$ sudo apt-get purge fglrx\nTo remove nVidia drivers:\n$ sudo apt-get purge nvidia-current\nAfter you install (or upgrade to) 12.10, install nVidia drivers again if you use a nVidia card. Don't install ATI drivers.\n\nA: The upgrading process is a kind of a personal matter : It can be great and good for some and it can be disastrous for others.\nFor instance :\nThe upgrading process can be a failure depending on how you master ubuntu and how much changes you have done to your actual linux.\nIn features it can also be both good and bad. For letting you having your own judgment you can read those articles : http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=search&q=Ubuntu+12.10\nIt will give you performances and feature list.\nThe fact that it's a personal matter is because Linux itself is designed itself to be owned by each user but at the same time sharing experiences with a common ground.\nDepending on your use you'll like or dislike the new ubuntu, you'll have a successful upgrade or not. No one can give you the warranty that'll be 100% ok.\nDo what TomKat has said for the upgrading process. But before : try it with the live dvd witch will show you if your pc is still supported and work correctly.\nBest regards,\n", "Q: Failed to load session \"ubuntu\" I installed CCSM to enable window previews in Unity.

Once I removed it using Failed to load session \"ubuntu\" - Ubuntu 13.10 on MacBook Pro everything was fine. ( I don't have a macbook pro, it was the same on my Dell desktop).\n\nA: Try booting into the LiveDVD and install Compiz. It's possible that you disable Unity. Update Unity.\nAdd the following PPA to your Software Sources per these instructions: ppa:unity-team/staging\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:unity-team/staging\nAfter adding, open the 'Software Updater', click ‘Check for Updates’, and proceed to install those you’re prompted to do.\nThis can also be achieved via the Terminal by running:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nRestart your computer.\n", "Q: Errno 5 Input/output error when trying to install Ubuntu on noisy hard drive I'm trying to install Ubuntu 12.04 to my brand new eBay purchased hard drive. I only got the drive today and already it's causing me problems. The seller is a proper professional company with 99.9% positive feedback, so it seems unlikely they would have sold me something rubbish.\nMy old hard drive packed up last Tuesday and so I bought a new one to replace it. Because this was an entirely new drive I decided to install Ubuntu as there was no currently installed operating system.\nMy computer is an eMachines EM250 netbook. There's no disk drive so I am installing Ubuntu from a USB stick.\nThe new operating system loads beautifully, and the desktop appears just as it should. When I click install I am taken to the installer which copies the files to about 35% and then displays this:\n\n[Errno 5] Input/output error\nThis is often due to a faulty CD/DVD disk or drive, or a faulty hard\ndisk. It may help to clean the CD/DVD, to burn the CD/DVD at a lower\nspeed, to clean the CD/DVD drive lens (cleaning kits are often\navailable from electronics suppliers), to check whether the hard disk\nis old and in need of replacement, or to move the system to a cooler\nenvironment.\n\nThe hard drive can be heard constantly crackling.\nWhen I booted Ubuntu 12.04 from my old faulty hard drive as a test I didn't even make it past the purple Ubuntu screen, so it can't be that bad.\n\nA: What fixed this for me was to boot up a live cd of gparted and then delete all the partitions on the drive (and apply).\nRestarted and booted up into the install again and it worked as expected.\nThere's some kind of incompatibility with existing partitions. I'm not sure exactly what it is, obviously, but wiping the drive clean of partitions should do the trick.\nI ran into this many times and reproduced this cause/fix several times to make sure I wasn't going crazy.\n\nA: The 'constant crackling' thing might mean that either the drive is faulty or it's getting less power. Visit the HDD company service centre and get it replaced. Try again.\n", "Q: Hiding the sidebar in Ubuntu I have two questions :\nFirst, I wanted to hide Ubuntu’s side-bar, so I set the settings in appearance to 'autohide'. The side bar did indeed disappear but when I roll over the left side, the side bar don't appear again. So, I am using a virtual box. Can it explain the fact that this bar doesn't show again when it is set to autohide. \nSecond, assuming I wouldn't be able to come over the problem, I pined to the dock every element of the sidebar, except the dash home. Is it possible either to pin it in the dock or to launch it from the terminal ? \n\nA: Auto-Hide of side bar (or Ubuntu dock in 17.10 and later) in Ubuntu desktop can be easily done as following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Settings.\n\n*Then go to Appearance (Dock in Ubuntu 18.04).\n\n*Click on Behavior.\n\n*Turn on the Auto Hide Launcher (Auto-hide the Dock in Ubuntu 18.04). By default it is off.\n\n\nA: \nI'm using virtualbox too and I suffer the same problem, this is a virtualbox bug. The easiest thing you could do is to install gnome-fallback and use it instead of unity, since you're not using the unity dash anymore.\nCheck this link with details on how to switch to the default gnome desktop, if it's not installed by default, you can open a terminal and use the command:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-session-fallback\n\nThen you can change your desktop in the login screen:\n\n\nA: Above solutions don't work for Ubuntu 17.10+,\nfor Ubuntu 17.10 GNOME Desktop,\ngoto Settings>Dock>Auto-hide the Dock and toggle it to hide automatically.\nalso, you can customize the position of sidebar and icon-sizes.\n\nA: Ubuntu 18.04\nToggling on the setting Settings > Dock > Auto-hide the Dock hides the dock as the setting hint says i.e The dock hides when any windows overlap with it, however when switching back to the Desktop the Dock appears.\nIn earlier versions like Ubuntu 14.04 there was following setting System Settings > Appearance > Behavior > Auto Hide Launcher enabling which the Dock auto-hide on Desktop as well and could be accessed by hovering the Dock position, which is by default Left.\nTo restore the desired behaviour on Desktop as well I followed the steps below I found at https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-dock-add-true-autohide-option-to-default-session/11200/4 which worked spot-on:\n\nyou can use dconf editor GUI to access all the features of Ubuntu\nDock. They are located here: org.gnome.shell.extensions.dash-to-dock\nThe parameter you need to activate “true autohide option” is\nintellihide.\nTo quickly enable it, you can use the following command:\ngsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.dash-to-dock intellihide false\nAfter that, turning on autohide option in System Settings will\nactivate “true autohide” instead of the default intellihide.\nTo get things back just obviously run\ngsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.dash-to-dock intellihide true\n\n\nA: Using GNOME Fallback is one way to work around this problem, but there are other workarounds that also merit consideration.\nIt is worth noting that if anyone wants to use a GNOME2 style desktop instead of the default Ubuntu desktop, then you should know that the MATE desktop is available. It IS (a fork of) Gnome 2, it is just not called Gnome 2 anymore to avoid conflict with Gnome 3.\nThat is worth knowing, because although MATE is certainly a bigger download than only installing Gnome-fallback, the difference is that IF you install MATE you will have a fully functional Gnome-2 style desktop that can do everything that you could do in Gnome-2, whereas Gnome-fallback desktop does not provide quite that much. \nBut if you don't care about having as much as you get with MATE, then Gnome-fallback works too. \nLastly, but not least, Gnome 3 really is a usable desktop too, IF you learn -all- the keyboard shortcuts. (Look them up some time, if you want to get good at Gnome 3.) And remember that Unity is getting better and better with each release also.\n\nA: I adjusted the sensibility in \"appearances\" to \"high\" because on my other computer I had the same problem with the side bar that was hard to get out again.\nNow it works fine.\n\nA: another option is running this in terminal:\ngsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.dash-to-dock require-pressure-to-show false\n\nI have Ubuntu running in Virtual Box and having issue with dock not show up when maximine application.\nThanks to Tamer Badawy (thbadawy) in this thread.\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-shell-extension-ubuntu-dock/+bug/1870519\n\nA: Just auto hide the task bar and set the sensitivity all the way down to low and it wont pop up again\n", "Q: Audio playback: part of song is skipped I am experiencing some problems with music playback after upgrading to Ubuntu 12.10.\nBasically some of the songs stop playing after some time as if the song has ended. It's always the same songs and the same time. The weird thing that it happens with Clementine and Totem but VLC doesn't have this problem and it also plays as it should on Windows. I'm guessing there might be a problem with some library that's shared with by the first two applications. I don't know if it's relevant but the file format of the audio files is flac(don't know if the problem affects mp3, because I don't have many of them).\n\nA: I still haven't found the reason behind this issue but at least I have found a workaround.\nI just decoded the file using flac -d and encoded it again with flac -e and it plays as it should.\nAs I have said before I'm not sure if this affects mp3's, obviously if it does this workaround wont work since mp3 is a lossy format.\n\nA: I've been having the same issue, it seems to be a GStreamer problem, VLC doesn't have an issue since it doesn't use GStreamer, whereas Totem and Clementine do. I've found the command-line program gst-play-1.0 also does this. Here is the output for a song that has this issue. I have reported this as a bug here.\n", "Q: Deja Dup Backup to Cd/Dvd Possible or Not? I started to use Linux/Ubuntu 12.04 last week. I'm a new comer. I liked this O.S. But I have a question which I couldn't find the answer here and by google search.\nThe question is \"Can I get scheduled backups to Cd/Dvd with Deja Dup software on Ubuntu O.S?\"\nThe firm that I'm working has a 700mb folder to be backed up. The files in the folder can be changed by any user during the day. So we need to backup the whole 700mb folder each day. The best solution comes to my mind is that taking the back-up to a Cd or Dvd. It will be very easy if this back-up procedure is scheduled by a program. Do you have any answers?\nThanks in advance\nAltan from Turkey/Istanbul\n\nA: To backup through deja-dup to a CD or DVD, change the backup location to local folder and select choose a location (approximate translations), then choose your CD/DVD in the location.\nThanks, mjchopperboy\n", "Q: Having troubles installing Ubuntu using Wubi I am trying to install Ubuntu on My Toshiba laptop, it is a 64 bit system and is running windows 7 I keep on getting this error\nError executing command\ncommand=C:\\Users\\A'den\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\pylA524.tmp\\bin]resize2fs.exe -C:\\ubuntu\\disks\\root.disk17744M\nrecal=1\nstderr=\nstdout=resie2fs 1.40.6 (09-Feb-2008)\nUsage:\n/cygdrive/c/Users/Aden/AppData/Local/Temp/pylA524.tmp/bin/resize\n2fs.exe-f C:/disks/root.disk 17744M [-d debug_flags] [-f] [-F] [-p] device [new-size]\n\nand the log file reads\n\nA: You have to install Wubi the way you install any other windows exe.
