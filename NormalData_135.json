["Q: Font rendering in gedit is smooth, but not smooth in NetBeans \nSee the attached image. The window in the background is gedit with the fonts rendered smooth. The window on top is NetBeans with not-so-smooth font rendering (not anti-aliased, I think). Both editors use Ubuintu Mono font. Can anyone help me to make NetBeans render the fonts better?\nI'm on 12.10.\n\nA: You should be able to improve the font rendering, but it will never be like the one in Gedit. Usually all java applications using Swing have that weird rendering. If you use Eclipse, for example, the font rendering should be correct.\nFont rendering can be changed in /etc/netbeans.conf:\nsudo gedit /etc/netbeans.conf\n\nand at the end of netbeans_default_options (between the quotation marks) add this:\n-J-Dswing.aatext=true -J-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=<OPTION>\n\nwhere option can be \"on\", \"gasp\" or \"lcd\". You can get the full list here.\nTry all those and see which one gives you best look. Hope it helps.\nNOTE:\ni don't have Netbeans installed right now to test, but depending on the way you have installed it netbeans.conf can be located somewhere else.\n\nA: Fixed.\nSee this and this.\nTL;DR:   just add -J-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on -J-Dswing.aatext=true to netbeans_default_options in the netbeans.conf file.\n(netbeans.conf is at <installdir>/etc/netbeans.conf)\nOf course, restart NetBeans.\nSee the result screenshot below. The Netbeans window on the extreme right is the onc after the above options are applied. Still not as good as gedit, but better than before.\n\n", "Q: How do I install Ubuntu on a computer without an OS on it? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I install Ubuntu? \n\nI'm trying to installing Windows 8 consumer preview on my laptop, but it doesn't work. So now I have no operating system in my laptop, and I'm trying to install Ubuntu on my laptop, but how?\n\nA: How to install Linux in under 5 minutes with NixiePixel!\nLike any normal installation, use an .iso:\nWhen you install Ubuntu, you will do so via three main methods:\n\n\n*\n\n*A Bootable USB drive, how do I install this?\n\n*A Bootable CD or DVD, how do I install this?*\n\n*The wubi.exe installer, which will not be effective in your case\nA .iso file is an installable file, which can be installed onto a disc - or in this case, a USB key.\nIf you already have one of these, you can review the next step. If not, follow this guide.\nBooting from a USB or CD/DVD\nThis is a tricky step because many computers are made by many different manufacturers, so the steps will not be definite, but should still give you a general idea on how to do this.\nEach computer comes with this thing called BIOS. It's job is to check that all your hardware and equipment is running, active and good to go. It is also BIOS' job to handle things like the booting of your computer, which is when the operating system begins to load. Before a Windows logo comes up, or a Linux logo or something like that - usually the manufacturer's logo will appear beforehand. This is when BIOS is doing it's work. For instance, most Dell computers have the Dell logo and a blue loading bar below it, and Compaq (HP) has a red screen with a Q in the middle. When this is there, theer may be some text in the bottom hand corners of the screen. They may say:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot Options Press F12\n\n*SET UP PRESS ESC\n\n*Press F5 BIOS\nOr similar. So what you want to do is press whatever key you need to enter BIOS. This is usually Esc or F12. You want to initiate something labelled 'Boot Options' or 'Set Up' or 'BIOS' or similar. Keep in mind each manufacturer's BIOS is different.\nWhen there, you will come to an (actually pretty scary looking) awkward computer-nerd looking screen. Note you cannot use your mouse in this screen and must use the arrow keys on your keyboard. Use the Left and Right arrow keys to navigate to a menu labeled BOOT, START UP, BOOT ORDER or something similar. \nIn this menu, you should have a list of the prioritized start-up methods. It is usually:\n\n\n*\n\n*HDD (Or 'Hard Drive'/'Hard Disk')\n\n*CD/DVD\n\n*USB\n\n*Network\n\n\nOr something very similar. If you can't see CD/DVD or USB in that list, your computer does not support booting that way (and basically there is nothing you can do about it. But don't fret: only computers made before 1970 would restrict such a thing. Computers before 1990 may not support USB booting, though.)\nDepending on your manufacturer, this process may be different:\nIf you are editing in the BIOS:\nYou should use your arrow keys and Enter to rearrange your boot order. If you have a disc, set CD/DVD to the first priority, if it's a USB you're using set the USB as the priority. Press Esc or navigate to the exit menu and save your changes!.\nTip: Read all the information on the BIOS screen, it will no doubt give you instructions on how to do this using your particular BIOS version.\nIf you are in the boot menu:\nUsually by using your Up and Down arrow keys, you should highlight your selection and press Enter to confirm your selection.\nTip: You will be able to tell if you're in the boot menu because there are no other menus, and by pressing Enter it will begin to boot.\nIf you are having trouble understanding, you can refer to this article with a nice couple of photos of different BIOS'.\nReboot\nFollow the prompts!\nTo answer your kind-of question, whether you have a currently have a OS installed or not doesn't actually matter. It only restricts the use of the wubi.exe installer which is launched in Windows. If you have a smaller computer which does not have CD drive, a USB drive is the best way to go and most newer computer support booting from USB.\nDon't forget you can also purchase pre-made install discs for Ubuntu's official store!\nGood Luck!\n*- Ubuntu 12.04 will fit on CD and DVD, but 12.10 will fit on only DVD\n\nA: Download ubuntu. Write it to a USB-stick according to the docs that tell you how to make a bootable USB stick. Fix your BIOS if needed so it boots from the usb stick. Insert USB stick (re)boot.

I want to install Ubuntu 10.10 on my Macmini first gen(Snow Leopard),my iMac G3(Tiger), or my PowerBook G4(Tiger). But i still want my Mac OS X on it. I can't use the disk utility to partition my drives. Even though my macmini runs Snow Leopard the disk utillity says that I need 10 GB of free space even though i have way more then that. I tried using the  Ubuntu 10.10 partition table to partition my computer(s) with it. But I can't figure out how to use it. Please Help!!!\n\nA: Is there any reason why you go with 10.10 instead of 12.10 or 12.04 LTS?\nWhen installing Ubuntu, choose manual partitioning and set 3 partitions for your Ubuntu. Make first boot point /, second swap and third /home. I usually take 15GB for / partition, 2xRAM size for swap and rest for /home partition.\nTick format to all 3 partitions.\nBe sure that you backup your data from MAC as you need to format whole drive if you didn't left unpartitioned space on drive.\n\nA: The \"free space\" you've got now is within your OS X partition. As such, it can't be used to hold a new OS -- for the most part, every OS requires its own partition (or sometimes multiple partitions, as 10robinho has suggested). Thus, you need to shrink your existing OS X partition (or perhaps a data partition, if you've got a separate data partition) to make room for Linux. You can do this with OS X's Disk Utility, but be aware that resizing partitions is inherently dangerous, so it's best to back up your important data before you proceed.\nThere are numerous online guides that can help you set up an OS X/Linux dual-boot configuration. The only one whose URL I have handy is my own, at http://www.rodsbooks.com/ubuntu-efi/index.html. A Web search will turn up more.\nI'm not familiar with the details of installing Ubuntu on a PowerPC system, so I can't comment on any specifics you'd encounter with that. A G3 system, in particular, is likely to be quite slow with a modern Linux installation.\n", "Q: Fastboot gets stuck while sending userdata image (raring preinstalled) to nexus 7 I am trying to install the latest pre-installed image of Ubuntu on my Nexus 7. However, I am stuck at flashing the userdata image. I have all my drivers and Android SDK updated.\nHaving said that, this seems like a image size issue. I read elsewhere on the Internet (here actually), that there is a size limitation on flashing 'userdata' partition; which is max 700MB.\nThis is interesting, because the size of raring-preinstalled-desktop-armhf+nexus7.img shows up as 690MB, however, when flashing it, fastboot quotes it as 705701 KB.\nI suspect that this could be a problem, because the previous version 12.xx was less than 700000 KB and hence I was able to easily flash it.\nAny help is appreciated on how to flash this new version, or whether I should flash the old version and upgrade it.\nSome info on the devices:\nNexus 7 16GB\nHost OS: Ubuntu 12.04.1  \nUPDATE: Initially I was following the Manual Install instructions from Ubuntu Nexus 7 Wiki. While flashing gunzipped image raring-preinstalled-desktop-armhf+nexus7.img, fastboot showed the size as 705701 KB and consistently went to disk sleep.  \nHowever, today I tried the installer script (ubuntu-nexus7-installer) and the fastboot flash was successful. This time fastboot showed the size as 692481KB \nI am going to file this as a bug instead and close this question. \n\nA: The 'current' Raring / 13.04 image does install on the Nexus 7, and updating (with appropriate commands) brings this up to latest versions.\nfrom: What do the updates provide in the Nexus 7 Desktop Installer?\n\n.. Now vs updating and then re-installing, you can get essentially the same results by upgrading. However, a simple upgrade won't do, you'll need to run (on the device):\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade && sudo apt-get install linux-image-nexus7\n\n\n\nIf you are trying to do something 'more clever' than that, it is probably outside the scope of this forum to assist you.\n\n*\n\n*Why are you trying this method?\n\n*Have you asked the author (of the post you noted) for assistance?\n", "Q: How to change unity launch application to wiggle?

If the AR8162 card is disabled, it will boot just fine.  The problem is that I need an ethernet connection...\nWhat is strange is that I'm able to boot Ubuntu in legacy mode with the AR8162 enabled in BIOS and this card is working just fine with the alx module available in compat-wireless package (see: 12.04 does not detect eth0(Atheros AR8162 )).  The only thing is that I want to keep dual booting with Win8, so UEFI Grub installation is mandatory.\nAny idea someone on how to boot Ubuntu 12.10 in UEFI mode, with a working AR8162 card?\nThanks.\n\nA: I'm not sure about the cause of the hang, but one workaround is to boot Ubuntu in BIOS/legacy mode and Windows in UEFI mode. This is awkward with most firmware implementations, but my rEFInd boot manager can help, since it can redirect the boot process from EFI-mode to BIOS/legacy-mode. To do this, you'd need to install rEFInd, add hdbios to the scanfor line in its refind.conf file, and install the BIOS version of GRUB (grub-pc in Ubuntu's packages). Thereafter, you should see rEFInd menu options when you start up for booting either Windows or a legacy OS, and the latter will take you to the BIOS-mode GRUB. Initially you'll also have additional menu items that will launch the EFI version of GRUB and perhaps directly launch Linux kernels in EFI mode, but you can eliminate those by removing the EFI-mode GRUB's boot loader on the ESP and by removing the ext4fs driver that rEFInd's installer will set up (or by setting it up without the file to begin with). OTOH, there's a slim chance that booting in EFI mode via a rEFInd->kernel path (without involving GRUB) will fix the problem, so it may be worth trying that before you even install grub-pc.\nAnother option is to convert from a GUID Partition Table (GPT) disk setup to a Master Boot Record (MBR) setup and boot both Windows and Ubuntu in BIOS mode. This will involve more work, though, since you'll need to convert the partition table type (which is possible with gdisk) and install appropriate BIOS-mode boot loaders for both OSes. I've seen instructions on doing this for Windows, but I don't happen to have any URLs handy.\nOf course, it's probably better to get the computer to boot Linux in EFI mode without hanging, so if somebody has a fix for that, you should try it first.\n", "Q: Mouse cursor lag after lock screen, 64 bit 12.04 Recently I have noticed that when I return to my computer after it has been \"locked\" for a while, the mouse pointer has significant lag.

However, I am specifically looking for tools to capture Scrolling Windows.\nAs an example, my personal favorite for Microsoft Windows is DuckCapture.

Use Shift+F2 to open the dev console.  The basic command for capturing an entire webpage looks like this:  \nscreenshot fileName --fullpage  \n\nWhich will save a screenshot of the entire webpage as fileName.png in your Downloads folder. This will be huge and some photo viewers can't handle it, but it has good quality.  If you'd rather copy the screenshot to your clipboard you can use this command:  \nscreenshot --clipboard --fullpage\n\nYou can also set a delay (in seconds):  \nscreenshot fileName --delay seconds --fullpage\n\n\nA: Method one: using add-ons.\nIf you are now using Chrome, you can use WebPage Screenshot Chrome extension to save full web page. If what you are using is Firefox, just install Screengrab Firefox extension.\nMethod two: using online screenshot tools.\nThere exists many webpage capture tools for you to capture scrolling windows such as Webpage Screenshot Capture, Screenshots, Capturefullpage, etc. Using these web tools to capture scrolling windows is simple, just copy the URL and paste it in the bar, then you can save the window as image format. \n\nA: This feature has been discussed many times, for example at Ubuntuforums, but there aren't really any perfect solutions apart from the workarounds listed on that forum, as none of the screenshot applications for Linux based systems seem to have the desired functionality.\nHowever, it appears that Shutter can capture tall, scrolling webpages (and local file:/// locations) if you install the necessary plugin:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-web-photo\n\nThen restart shutter, click the globe to get this dialog and then enter the desired url.\n\nIn the resulting tall webpage further below I've tried to reduce the image quality and size a bit (it's just 31kb now).\nYou can also use this website screenshot feature for local uris such as file:///home/mike/bin but you only get a list view of the files, but a tall one at that. This may be of some use for you, but it probably isn't ideal.\nShutter doesn't currently support taking scrolling screenshots of your files in your file manager's windows, although the developer is said to be targeting 0.90 as the release that will include the new functionality, as noted at Launchpad. However, it doesn't seem to be in the latest release. There seems to be problems in implementing the functionality, as the developer notes that there are still 'several unsolved problems':\n\n1) The scrolling is not the same in all application, e.g. firefox scrolls 50px and nautilus 35px when you use the mouse wheel\n  2) How to detect the last screenshot to take?

You will see later that we need the Samsung Unified Linux Driver mainly for supporting the scanner.\nAdd the following repository:\ndeb http://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/ debian extra\n\nYou can do this with Synaptic Package Manager, Software Sources, etc.\nInstall the GPG key, from http://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/suldr.gpg, for the repository. You can do this with Synaptic Package Manager or Software Sources, or paste this line to your terminal:\nwget -O – http://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/suldr.gpg | sudo apt-key add\n\nReload / update the repository information.\nStep 2: Install the Printer Driver\nHere, you can choose to use either one of the following drivers:\n{Recommended. The driver is very stable.} The open-source driver provided by the Splix project. (Check this too: http://www.linuxprinting.org/show_driver.cgi?driver=splix)\nThe Samsung unified printer driver. In this case, install the samsungmfp-driver package first.\nEither of the drivers seems to work fine. I personally do not have any particular recommendation yet until further testing. (For the moment I use the Splix driver.)\nFrom the start menu, invoke System -> Administration -> Printing.\nChoose ‘Samsung’, and then ‘SCX-4521F’.\nFor the driver, choose either the Splix or the Samsung driver according to your preference.\nCheck the ‘Printer Options’ in the ‘Printer Properties’. Change the options where appropriate (especially the ‘Media Size’).\nTry to print a test page. It should work!\nStep 3: Install the Scanner Driver\nInstall the samsungmfp-scanner package.\n{ONLY FOR Ubuntu 11.10.} Use your favorite editor to modify [i]/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-cups-usblp.conf to comment the following line by prefixing with a ‘#’: #blacklist usblp. Restart your computer.\n{ONLY FOR Ubuntu before (not including) 10.04.} Add users you allow to access the scanner into the lp group. You can use System -> Users and Groups from the start menu to do this, or use the adduser command. Logout and re-login.}\nNow Graphics -> Simple Scan or xsane should be able to detect and use the scanner! You can use sane-find-scanner or scanimage -L to detect the scanner too. (If it does not work, refer to this troubleshooting guide.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Some Technical Details\n\n\nSplix is included in Ubuntu since 9.10. So it is now possible to use the printing feature of the printer out-of-box (without using the Samsung unified printer driver.)\nFor very complete and detailed instructions including various approaches for setting up Samsung printers, please refer to http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=341621 and http://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/.\n", "Q: How to share architecture-independent latex files across multiple setups I have 3 ubuntu computers, 2 of them running 32-bit and one 64-bit.

I am trying to install ubuntu 12.04 on new hp notebook nb pc dv6-7205 tx. This notebook comes with windows 8 preloaded. \nItried to install ubuntu 12.04 but while rebooting the boot loader does not show both the operating systems and second thing is if only ubuntu is loaded on this laptop I don't know how to configure wireless/bluetooth Is there any step by step guide available.\n\nA: I assume that you have burned Ubuntu to a CD or a USB stick. You need to enable the computer to look for other boot devices than the hard disc first. This can be a bit technical. You will need to enter the BIOS, which is a menu controlling hardware of the computer. If you are not experienced with this, I would recommend that you find someone, who is, or look closely in the handbook following the notebook for instructions. What needs to be changed is the 'boot order', making sure that the CD drive (or USB) is checked before the hard disc.\nConcerning wireless, it should tell you that there are wireless coneections available, when you open the computer. After entering the password, it should work. There is a guide here: https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/ubuntu-help/net-wireless.html \nSimilar for Bluetooth: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BluetoothSetup\n\nA: I just bought HP DV6-7210US. I thought our computers could potentially vary quite a bit, but my problems were solved but going to HP and updating the BIOS. I was then able to use/install UEFI/Legacy at the same time.

It then says it cannot find  the configuration file and I cannot do anything from there on. It is important to note I did use the universal usb thing and this appeared after I sued that and tried to boot the usb. Any help would be appreciated, thanks.\n\nA: Try first plugging your USB into another computer and rename the folder \"isolinux\" to \"syslinux\" and the files \"isolinux.bin\" and \"isolinux.cfg\" in that folder to \"syslinux.bin\" and \"syslinux.cfg\" respectively. Then try booting with the USB again.\nIf that does not work, you will have to reformat your USB to FAT. You can do that using a tool like GParted (\"sudo apt-get install gparted\" in terminal). After that make the USB drive again and it should be fine.\nSource: http://techie-buzz.com/how-to/syslinux-no-default-ui-error-fix.html\n", "Q: Touchscreen woes: Attempt to scroll using touchscreen is recognized as a click and drag/select I am running Ubuntu 12.10 on a HP Envy 4t-1105dx with touchscreen.  Everything except Wifi (Atheros AR9565 doesn't work out of the box) and touchscreen (mostly working) works.\nI believe that the Envy i have has an Atmel Maxtouch Digitizer.\nWhen I'm on Firefox and certain other programs, attempting to scroll using the touchscreen si recognized as a click and drag/select motion as if I were holding down the mouse button to drag and highlight something.\nUsing the scroll bar on the side works.  \nDrag scrolling in Documents Viewer works.\n\nAnother problem is that while clicking generally works on the touchscreen, when I try to click folders or files using the touchscreen in Nautilus, the file/folder is only highlight.  \n\nBesides this problem using the touchscreen is fine save for the lack of gestures in gnome shell.  Utouch is not in 12.10 anymore sadly.  Why  I have no idea.\n\nA: To get touch scrolling in Firefox working, install this addon extension Here\nIt's an addon called Grab and Drag. It allows you to scroll using the touchscreen in the same fashion as a tablet or smartphone.\nDouble tapping on the screen should also open files and folders in nautilus.\n\nA: The failure to trigger actions by double tapping the touchscreen in nautilus is a bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-nexus7/+bug/1071922 and https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg-server/+bug/1002788\nSwitching to \"Single click to open items\" (nautilus->edit->preferences->behavior->) does not help. You can, however, switch to list view (nautilus->view->list). In list view the touchscreen works as expected. That doesn't help directly with the desktop items, but you can go to home/user/Desktop in nautilus in list view and trigger actions from there. \n\nA: One setting you could change is the 'Single click to open files'. When this is active, you will have to tap and hold the itens to select.\nI have been strugling with scrolling with touchscreen for some time now as well, without  much success. While firefox and chrome have some extensions to make that work, there are other applications that still dont work very well (for instance the unity launcher) \n", "Q: USB Stick won't boot So I wanted to play around with CHrome OS, and installed the Vanilla version of Chromium OS to my trusty USB Stick.  I used the Win32DiskImager.exe to install the OS to the USB stick.  All went well, but I decided I didn't really want to use the OS, so I formatted the USB Stick in WIndows using the Minitool Partition WIzard.  I finished with that and downloaded openSUSE, and then installed it with your normal Linux Live USB Creator.  \nThat's when everything got screwy.  It wouldn't boot after that.  Files could be copied to the stick, but it's not bootable anymore.  I tried unetbootin after that with the same result, and then one last time with the generic live usb creator from linuxpendrive.com.\nAny idea what could have happened?  Was it the win32diskimager that toasted the usb stick?\nAnd is there any way to get back to a bootable state?  I was thinking of booting into gparted and formatting from there to see what would happen if I formatted through Linux instead.  (Oh, I should mention I tried a regular good 'ol format through Windows 7 as well.  \nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nA: I have found that using:\nfdisk /dev/sdX \n\n(where X is the identifier of the USB device in question - make SURE this is correct!) and deleting the partition table:\n\n\n*\n\n*p - to print (display) the partition table\n\n*d - to delete (gives choice of partition if more than one)\n\n*w - to write the changes\n\n\n...seems to work on rebooting.

Before installing OpenSUSE the order probably was: CD/DVD Drive > USB > HDD; after the installation it turned to be: HDD > CD/DVD Drive > USB. So at startup, your system veryfy the possiblity to boot from the HDD and if it is possible it won't try to boot from USBs and CDs/DVDs.\nTo restore the prior order you need to enter in BIOS (It may vary to computer to computer, but in general to enter in the BIOS you need to be pressing F1 or F2 or DEL or ESC or F10 at the startup time). In the BIOS go to the Boot tab and there you'll find an option to change Boot Order or Boot Priority or Boot Management or Boot Sequence, then just put the USB on the top of the list, CD/DVD Drive in second and HDD in third.\nDone, now you should be able to boot from your USB Stick.\n\nA: It happens when usb drive lose its Partition Table. To recover it you can just use Gparted in virtual machine or live usb or any other way. Just run Gparted, then select your usb drive, then from Device option select Create Partition Table and proceed. [Cautoin: This will remove all data from the drive].\n\nA: I had the exact problem you described, tried out Chrome OS with win32diskimager on 2 different usb drives and both then had problems booting afterwards (as well as their partitions being scattered, but repaired using minitools partition wizard).\nI then used gparted on a 3rd usb to Create Partition Table on the 2 faulty ones and that has cleared up the problems and the usb drives now boot perfectly!\nTook me ages to find this answer so thanks MARUF SARKER!!\n", "Q: Access Violation in WINE I am using ubuntu 12.04 and wine version 1.5.

When I press Win+W expo only shows the windows of the current workspace. I remember 12.04 had a similar problem (it was a Compiz bug) and there was a PPA to solve that (see this question). The problem is that PPA does not seem to be  maintained any more for Quantal 12.10 at least.\nI really don't know if this is related to that bug or is just some configuration problem...\nSo how can I change this behaviour and get expo to show windows from all workspaces?\n\nA: This is not a bug, but a configuration issue. You need to install Compizconfig-settings-manager from the Software Center, and then, when you run it, go to the scale plugin.\nFrom here, you have to set the option \"Initiate Window Picker For All Windows\" to use Super+w. This will complain of a conflict, but all you have to do is disable \"Initiate Window Picker\".\nYou can begin using it immediately.\n\n\nA: As of 14.04, you could expo windows from all workspaces using\n\nShift+Win+W\n\n", "Q: Terminal tab autocompletion like in Mac OS I could not find a screenshot, but i've seen a colleague of mine doing this:\nhe has a terminal open in his MacBook Air, starts typing a file name, presses Tab and is given a list of suggestions, like in linux, but has a possibility to move a cursor to select a suggestion.

Do NOT su to root for these actions. In addition, ensure that the user who is running the command is in the sudoers list.\n\nQuestion #1: How do I avoid su-ing to root?\nI'm new to Linux and Ubuntu.\nDuring the installation process, I entered the following details:\n\nName: Sharon\nAccount name: Sharon\n\nI notice that whenever I open up a terminal window, it says:\n\nsharon@sharon:~$\n\nQuestion #2: Is sharon@sharon:~$ root?\nPS: I am very new to Linux and Ubuntu; please excuse me if my questions seem elementary.\n\nA: Just use 'sudo' before the commands.  This only assumes root privileges for that command and is the safe way of doing it.  What they are saying is do NOT do somthing that will assume root privileges on a more permanent basis (such using 'su' or 'bash' with sudo)\nsharon@sharon is your user name, which will be an administrative user, on the computer sharon.  You've give the computer the same name as your user.  If you want to change the computer name have a look at this question and it's main answer. Most of us use a descriptive name like, office, laptop, or you can follow the geeky convention of giving it a SF name: spock, kirk, picard etc.\n\nA: 1) What do you mean by that? sudo gains the account a temporary root privileges. Some applications will need these privileges and you will need to sudo. If however you don't want to type sudo all the time, then type sudo su BUT THAT'S NOT RECOMMENDED.\n2) No.\n\nA: If you have downloaded the .deb file from Symantec, double clicking on the file will open Ubuntu Software Center and you will see a button to install the software. Once you click install, it will ask you for your password and then install the software.\nIf the above procedure does not work, you will need to use the terminal and type in the command in the readme file. \nFor example the readme file may tell you to type\ndpkg -i *.i386.deb\n\nas root. Linux has a special user called root, but in some distributions, like Ubuntu, it is disabled by default. To do something as root, when it is enabled, you have to first type suEnter, then enter root's password. Then you get the root prompt:\nroot@sharon:/root#\n\n. Once you get the root prompt you enter the command. However, this is not for Ubuntu.\nFor Ubuntu\nYou add sudo to the front of the command you want to use as root. You do not (cannot) use the su command first and then use the command you want. So you type:\nsharon@sharon:~$ sudo dpkg -i *i386.deb\n\nThis is the same command as above but with sudo in front. Once you type a command with sudo in front, the computer will ask for your password. The cursor will not move when you type the password. It will look like nothing is happening at the terminal. This is normal. Enter the password and hit Enter. \nThen the computer will execute the commad that you typed after sudo as if you are the root. Thus, even if you are not root, you get temporary power of the root by using the sudo command. In Ubuntu the root account is disabled by default for security. The only way to act as the root is to use the sudo command. This default can be changed, but that is not recommended.\nHope this helps\n\nA: 1) sudo gives root privilegies temporary (for command than you type after sudo), like you say: \"su, do it!\" su is for logging into someone's else account, like root's. Just run sudo su and you will have root privilegies. Ubuntu doesn't configure su's password, but you can configure it with sudo su passwd. It's best to use sudo for begginers.\n2) No, it isn't. You can find two simbols (after any1@hostname) — $ (normal user) and # (root). If you are user, you will see sharon@sharon:~$, if you are root, you will see root@sharon:~# in your terminal.\n1st part of any1@hostname (any1) is name of user. 2nd part (hostname) is name of your machine, sometimes called hostname (your machine is host, name is hostname).\nTilda (~) is symbol for user's directory.\n", "Q: Ubuntu is booting into terminal instead of GUI Interface I recently upgraded my computer to Ubuntu 12.04 from 10.04 and it started messing up, as in, freezing up on certain programs and then randomly logging out and going to the log-in screen.

I have only installed one game (OpenTTD) and the rest of the applications that I have installed are purely software development and debugging centric. I have installed VMware (visualization), Evolution (groupware), and Plex (media center server). I have also uninstalled a few of the default applications, add-ons, and Unity Lenses that I would never use.\nThe recommendations I get for my account are exclusively for applications that I have already installed, applications that are instaleld by default (even the ones I have chosen to uninstall), graphic design; typesetting; and photo tools, and  weird games I have never heard of and that does not look interesting.\nHow are these recommendations intended to work?

Is there such a thing on the user side?\nHow does the rating mechanism work? (and where do I find it/can contribute improvements to it?)\n\nA: The pieces that conform the Recommendations feature can be viewed in the blue print registered to track its development in the 12.04 cycle. In a nutshell, it’s a server-side recommendations algorithm (Launchpad project) that sends data to the Software Center so it can display apps that you’re likely to give a good rating.\nThis feature is specificated in detail here.

How to diagnose? I've been using an HP Officejet 6500 All-in-One for a few years now without any trouble. It is connected wirelessly to my network, for both printing & scanning. However, this week, scanning quit working, apparently as a result of some updates. After trying various things I found that it works fine connected using USB, but that's not a satisfactory fix.\nI updated hplip to version 3.12.11 and tried reverting to the previous kernel version.  Also, I've tried various scanner programs with varying failure messages such as the following hp-scan results:\n3.5.0-20-generic x86-64 fails with:\nOpening connection to device...\nerror: SANE: Invalid argument (code=4)\n\n3.5.0-21-generic x86-64 fails with:\nExpecting to read 10.9 MB from scanner.\nReading data: [|                                          ] 0%  0 B   \nerror: No data read.\nClosing device.\n\nAny suggestions are welcome.\nJust realized that I should have made clear that printing still works well, via either wireless or USB. \n\nA: After many hours of googling & trying different suggestions, I gave up troubleshooting & uninstalled everything I could find to do with printers & scanners.  Reinstalling seems to have cured the problem.\n\nA: You have tried several remedies to no avail and I cannot swear that your problem is exactly what I experienced. However I am using MInt13 64 bit, which is based on Ubuntu 12.04. My printer/scanner is HP OfficeJet all-in-one 4620. I downloaded and installed hplip 3.12.11 and the scanner doesn't work. It is not even detected. However I have solved the problem like this:\nGetting scanner to work with Mint13 Mate 64bit:\n1) If necessary use a text editor as root to add 'hpaio' into '/etc/sane.d/dll.conf', that is if 'hpaio' doesn't appear already.\n2) Use a File Manager (Nautilus perhaps), to go to /usr/lib and /usr/lib64, both as administrator/root.\nIn lib64, make link of directory 'sane', and then cut and paste it into directory /usr/lib; rename the created link as 'sane'. (N.B. There is probably already an empty directory 'sane' in /usr/lib which will first have to deleted or renamed in some meaningless way such as 'sane.original.empty').\nThis worked ok for me on 08/08/12. Now scanner works fine, either simplescan or xsane.\nThis is a slightly edited version of my post on the Linux Mint forum dated 09 December 2012.

Now when I try to launch wmware workstation it asks for linux header path like shown here. I tried all the solutions on that page but nothing works...\nIt was working before I switched to the 3.7 kernel.\nAny idea what I can do to get it work?\n\nA: To make the original answer a little clearer for other folks:\nIn Ubuntu 13.04 (should work in 12.10 as well), with just the kernel headers installed, you can do this:\nsudo ln -s /usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r)/include/generated/uapi/linux/version.h /usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r)/include/linux/version.h\n\nI have to do that every time I update the kernel right now.\n\nA: First thing to check is for the availability of a newer version of VMplayer or workstation to download.\nIf the latest version does not work, then start looking at the error messages and try to add a link to fix the problem.\nLooks like the version.h file got moved again, so adding a symlink is needed:  \nln -s /usr/src/linux-3.7-rc6/include/generated/uapi/linux/version.h /usr/src/linux-3.7-rc6/include/linux/version.h\n\nSee the link http://rglinuxtech.com/2012/11/18/vmware-9-0-1-not-so-clever-after-all/\nThe headers have been a moving target since 3.2, and vmware does not keep up.\n\nA: After making sure the proper Linux header files were installed for my kernel, manually creating symbolic links, installing build-essential, and basically following all advice that you linked to here, I still was receiving an error saying the path to the linux headers were invalid.\nAfter doing a sudo apt-get update, it turns out there was a newer version of the Linux headers available than was previously reported. Upgrading the currently installed headers package to the latest version fixed the problem, and the VMWare Config Tool was able to find the headers. In my case, the packages which needed to be upgraded were linux-headers-generic-pae and linux-generic-pae.\n\nA: If following the instruction that VMware gives you in the error messages doesn't work, you might have to re-install VMware.  \nI have the same problem with VirtualBox PUEL every time the kernel is updated because I installed it manually from the .deb files.  Fortunately the VBox error message includes instruction for re-running the installation script to install the right code into the kernel.\nI surmise that if you use a PPA it might get around this problem by including it in the kernel each time it is updated, but I haven't tried it yet.\n\nA: In my case, the symlink to version.h didn't work. I found that this helped on a 64-bit 13.04 system:\nhttp://linuxg.net/how-to-install-vmware-player-5-0-2-on-ubuntu-13-04-12-10-12-04-linux-mint-15-14-13-debian-sid-wheezy-and-squeeze/\nThe headers package was already installed, but what seemed to make the difference was installing 'build-essential'. I then uninstalled vmplayer (running the installer with -u vmware-player does this) and reinstalled, and everything was copacetic after that.\n\nA: I have found that with Ubuntu 14.04 the solution is very simple:\nIn the terminal:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)\n\nNow run VmWare again and it will ask to rebuild and run perfectly.

Do I need to do something else to see all the files on the HD?\n\nA: No.  If you can see some files on the hard drive but not others then it might indicate that there is a problem with the filesystem.  Make sure that you change the view in Nautilus to show hidden files, but this is unlikely to be the problem.\nYou could try installing testdisk on Ubuntu on the USB and see if that can help you recovery the missing files.  Check the partition and mount status of the NTFS partition(s) with the commands\nsudo fdisk -l\nblkid\nmount\n\nfirst so that you have a better idea what you are dealing with.\nIf you have an external drive that is big enough and has enough free space, you could make a bit copy of the internal drive and use testdisk to investigate the file system on it.

So Minecraft fullscreen seems to not work for me. Because of this I just run it in a maximized window. Usually what I do is set my sidebar to auto-hide, revealing at the top left corner with 0 sensitivity, so that it doesn't take up space or keep popping up.\nMy question is how would I be able to do this through a script? I currently have a bash script to run Minecraft, I could make it a python script or something if needed. My best guess is that there's a file I can write into that would store these values. I would prefer not to disable it entirely just because I sometimes like to switch to another workspace and open up a web browser through the dash.\n\nA: Add the following lines at the beginning of your script:\nAUTOHIDE=$(dconf read /org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/launcher-hide-mode)\ndconf write /org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/launcher-hide-mode 1\n\nThe first line saves whether or not we currently autohide to the variable AUTOHIDE. The second line simply turns on autohiding.\nThen, add the following at the end of the script:\ndconf write /org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/launcher-hide-mode $AUTOHIDE\n\nThis restores the autohide setting from the variable we saved earlier. If autohiding was enabled before you launched Minecraft, the script won't turn it off; otherwise, it will.\nI can only think of two situations in which this wouldn't work:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you lauch Minecraft using exec, in which case the code at the end wouldn't get called (not much we can do about that except for not calling it with exec).\n\n*You run multiple instances of Minecraft at the same time, which would require a more elaborate method (which I would be happy to detail for you, should you be interested).\n\n", "Q: How do I play mame games on 12.10 without being interrupted by the screensaver? \"gnome-screensaver-command -p\" is gone in 12.10 so mame can't poke to keep the screen alive. \nIs there a command I can add before \"mame\" to deactivate the screensaver and one to reactivate it after I exit \"mame\"?\nThank you.\n\nA: If you have installed Caffeine as fleamour suggested, it will do it automatically once you have configured it.

The problem is that when I enter my static ip in the browser, I always get stuck at the modem/router login interface.\nGoing to the ip address assigned to my ubuntu server (on my network) I can see that nginx serves pages correctly. Another thing is that getting my modem/router interface is only possible via my local network. I asked a friend to try my static ip but he said he got a blank page. I think this means that the gateway is not accessible from the outside world.\nI think I'm missing something minimal here as it's not supposed to be this complicated setting up a home server. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: The huawei router does not support loopback. This means that when you use the WAN address of your router from the LAN side you get the LAN address instead. Your router setup page is connected to LAN:80 and your forwarding is done from WAN:80\n", "Q: Installing on a Vaio S I have a new Vaio S 15\" with Windows 8 pre-installed and UEFI.

Is there an easy way to check a notebook's hardware compatibility with ubuntu before you buy it?\nI really don't want to buy a notebook home and find several bugs caused by the hardware.\nI know that DELL has some notebooks which are pre-installed ubuntu12.04LTS, i.e. the new xps. But what about other notebooks? isn't there a way to quickly check a notebook's compatibility with ubuntu?\nA way I can see is using a LiveCD/ubuntu stick and boot in ubuntu first, then run some tests. But the problem is: how to make these tests in a short time automatically??? and how can I check the hardware compatibility? I know that I can use lshw or hardinfo to get informations, but only having the information is not enough, there are still some possibilities that your hardware has a bug. For instance, Lenovo T410i's wireless driver has a bug which causes extremely low speed internet connection, I googled a lot and recompiled the driver to fix that bug. So this is the kind of situation I'm trying to avoid.\nAny help is appreciated.\n\nA: Testing hardware compatibility is a long a tedious process, even if you have unrestricted access to the hardware. There is no easy way, I am afraid. Without proper vendor support and testing for Linux, it's down to the user to make sure the hardware works, and that is anything but easy.\n\nA: Hw-probe may warn you about hardware compatibility problems: https://github.com/linuxhw/hw-probe\nYou can quickly create a probe of the computer (snapshot of hw specs and logs) using Ubuntu Live ISO, save the link returned (like this) and investigate it later at home.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a probe\nsudo hw-probe -all -upload\n\n\n*Open the link returned\n\n*Check statuses of devices (works, failed, malfunc, detected)\n\n*Check if drivers are loaded for all PCI/USB devices\n\n*Investigate logs for hardware errors\n\n\nAlso you can run simple graphics card tests (for integrated & dedicated cards):\nsudo hw-probe -all -check -upload\n\nI'm the author of this project, so feel free to ask any questions in comments!\n\nA: You can check Ubuntu Certified Hardware. If some hardware is certified you will be 100% it will work for Ubuntu.\nThe problem is: you can't know if some not-certified hardware will work or not.\n\nA: Check at https://certification.ubuntu.com/ to see if the laptop you are considering buying is certified. Even if it is not certified there are a few other things that you can do to check if the laptop model is compatible with Ubuntu before you buy it.\nYou can test if a computer's hardware is compatible with Ubuntu by downloading the Ubuntu Live DVD iso file and booting the live DVD or live USB. The Ubuntu live USB runs faster than the live DVD and has the additional advantage of being reusable for something else after you are finished testing and/or installing Ubuntu with it.\nA live DVD/USB can be used for a quick demo or test of Ubuntu to check if the computer's hardware works as expected without making any changes to the machine. Windows or whatever is already installed on the computer is unaffected after trying this and then rebooting. See this answer for detailed and specific information about how to create a bootable USB flash drive for testing potential PC purchases for compatibility with Ubuntu.\nMany computer stores provide their own Ubuntu live USB with Ubuntu for testing Ubuntu as a service to their customers. I discovered this after trying to return a graphics card that wouldn't boot Ubuntu, when a technician plugged the graphics card into one of the store's computers and booted Ubuntu from that computer to show me that my new graphics card was compatible with Ubuntu. If the computer store won't let you test their laptop with your Ubuntu live media, ask if they have their own USB with Ubuntu, and will demonstrate Ubuntu with it on the computer of your choice.\nA quick demo can test two things:\n\n*\n\n*Check if hardware (Ethernet, USB, sound, webcam) works as expected.\n\n*Check the look and feel of the operating system. \n\nWifi cannot always be tested with a quick demo. Even if the laptop doesn't connect to wifi in the store, it might still work after installing the driver for the wireless adapter.\n", "Q: How to investigate display lockup after Alt-Tab switching? Running Kubuntu 12.10 on a Dell Latitude E6500 running the free NVIDIA driver for my display.  If I hit alt-tab to switch between windows too fast the display locks up and the only way I can unlock it is restart the machine, either hard power the box off or SSH into and reboot.  All other services and applications continue to run.\nNothing locks or crashes, no other messages, just the display locks.\nAny ideas where to start troubleshooting this?\n\nA: This is a bug, so I'm assuming you're asking how to collect the necessary information to report it. (Otherwise, this question is probably off-topic; see the FAQ and this meta question.)\nConsult the Bug Reporting Documentation First\nYou said:\n\nI'm running the Project Neon ppa and when I login with the user asscocatied w/ that i don't seem to have any lockups.\n\nI'm assuming that means when you log in to a KDE desktop, the problem does not occur, but that it does occur when you log into a dekstop not provided by packages from the Project Neon PPA.\nHowever, if this is happening in a GUI provided by Project Neon, please make sure you've read this carefully and are following its guidelines when reporting the bug.\nWhether or not this is a bug in Project Neon software, I highly recommend reading this all the way through before reporting bugs in Ubuntu. For Kubuntu, I recommend still reading that, but also this (and take a look at this portal page). This question is also a useful resource. And here's some good general bug reporting advice.\nIf you've already read all that and understand how to report bugs, you can skip ahead...\nFigure Out What Package Is Probably Affected\nIf you report the bug against the wrong package, provided that the report is otherwise good and has all the necessary information, this usually can be figured out by a triager or developer, and the bug report can be pretty easily retargeted to another package.\nHowever, since much of the important technical information in an Ubuntu bug report is often provided by running Apport, and Apport figures out what to send based on what package the bug is being reported against, it's good to make an initial effort to select the right one, especially for video, sound, driver, or kernel problems, where Apport can often submit a lot of highly valuable information.\nThe screen freeze is probably due either to, or at least closely related to, the X server or the window manager.\nThe X Server\nAt the login screen you can select between different interfaces. All of them use the same X server, but some use different window managers.\nIf you're experiencing this with all options, then this bug probably relates to the X server, and it can be reported against xserver-xorg by running ubuntu-bug xserver-xorg. But it's better to run ubuntu-bug with the PID of the running Xorg process that may be malfunctioning. ubuntu-bug $(pidof Xorg) should do this.\n(See below for an explanation of how to run ubuntu-bug when your screen is frozen.)\nThe Window Manager\nHowever, it sounds from what you said that this is not the case--that at least one option (logging in with a desktop provided by Project Neon) works.\nKubuntu's window manager is kwin, provided by the kde-window-manager package. To report a bug against it, you can run ubuntu-bug kde-window-manager, but it's better to run ubuntu-bug with the PID of the running kwin process that may be malfunctioning. ubuntu-bug $(pidof kwin) should do this.\nIf the problem is specific to a 3D Unity session, the window manager running when it occurs is compiz.\n\n\n*\n\n*ubuntu-bug compiz is okay. ubuntu-bug $(pidof compiz) is better\n\n\nOn the other hand if it just happens in Unity 2D (and a GNOME Classic/Fallback session), the window manager is metacity:\n\n\n*\n\n*ubuntu-bug metacity is okay. ubuntu-bug $(pidof metacity) is better.\n\n\nIf it happens in a GNOME 3 desktop running GNOME Shell (not Unity), the window manager is mutter.\n\n\n*\n\n*ubuntu-bug mutter is okay. ubuntu-bug $(pidof mutter) is better.\n\n\nIf it happens in an Xubuntu desktop, the window manager is xfwm4.\n\n\n*\n\n*ubuntu-bug xfwm4 is okay. ubuntu-bug $(pidof xfwm4) is better.\n\n\nIf it happens in an LXDE desktop, the window manager is openbox.\n\n\n*\n\n*ubuntu-bug openbox is okay. ubuntu-bug $(pidof openbox) is better.\n\n\nUser-Specificity\nIf you have one user account that boots to one UI by default, and another user account that boots to another UI by default, and the bug happens in one but not the other, then (since this is a UI bug) the UI difference is probably what's important.\nBut you sure make sure, since sometimes a specific user's configuration manages to trigger a bug. You should verify that it happens with a user account logged in with one UI, and with the same user account logged in to a different UI.\nYou should also see if usage patterns are what trigger the bug. For example, see if the number of windows you're Alt+Tabing through is relevant to whether or not the bug occurs. (If it occurs with only one window, that's particularly interesting.) This sort of information should be included in your bug report.\nOther Packages\nIt's possible the bug is in some package other than the X Server or the window manager.\n\n\n*\n\n*It could be higher level (that is, most of the problem might be happening in an process that runs on top of the GUI, which is only triggering another bug in the window manager or X server).\n\n*Or it could be lower level. Probably not a bug in the kernel itself (your system still works fine, you can SSH in). But it could be a video driver problem.\n\n\nIn any case, reporting the bug against either the window manager or the X Server, depending on which appears more likely, will usually cause Apport to upload enough of the right information that if the bug is in something else, that can be figured out.\nReporting The Bug, While The Bug Makes Itself Hard To Report\nYou've found you can SSH in. So it seems likely that you can access a virtual console with Ctrl+Alt+F1, Ctrl+Alt+F2, and so forth, up to F6.\n(To switch back to the GUI, use Alt+F7.)\nIf that works, you can report the bug from the virtual console while the GUI is still running and malfunctioning. ubuntu-bug, when run in a virtual console, should detect there is no GUI and run in text mode instead. Or if you prefer to use the apport-cli command instead, that works too.\nSSHing in to report it is probably easier though, as then you can copy the Launchpad URL provided by ubuntu-bug/apport-cli and paste it into a graphical web browser on the SSH client.\nAlternatively you might consider using ssh -X to connect. Then you can run GUI programs on the malfunctioning machine (that you're SSHed into), and make their interfaces (their windows) appear on the SSH client. You could then run ubuntu-bug graphically and report the bug from a graphical web browser that runs on the malfunctioning machine that is the SSH server but displays on the properly functioning machine that is the SSH client.\nMore Ways to Find the Affect Process's PID\nDepending on the nature of the bug, it might be particularly helpful to run ubuntu-bug (or apport-cli) with the PID of the buggy process, rather than just with the name of the package. This will automatically include information about the running state of the process, in the files uploaded to Launchpad by Apport.\nSo if ubuntu-bug $(pidof processname) doesn't work or doesn't get the right process, you can also:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run pidof manually and see what you get. If you get nothing, it means no process by that name is running.\n\n*Run pgrep, which shows PID's of all processes matching the argument as a regular expression (rather than whose names are equal to the argument, as pidof does).\n\n*Use the tried-and-true, classic technique (ps, piped to grep):\nps ax | grep -v grep | grep processname\nThat provides more detailed information--it gives a listing of the name, PID, and states of any matching processes.\nFiles to Make Sure Are Attached\nMake sure /var/log/Xorg.0.log and (if it exists) /var/log/Xorg.0.log.old are attached.\nSimilarly, make sure ~/.xsession-errors and (if it exists) ~/.xsession-errors.old are attached. (~ represents your home folder.) Dotfiles are not shown in Nautilus by default, so if you want to see them in a graphical file browser window, do Ctrl+H (or View > Show Hidden Files).\nWhen you report a bug on Launchpad, Apport will have automatically sent a number of files, which will have been attached. You can also attach one more file. To attach different files, submit the bug report first--then you can attach them.\n", "Q: Ubuntu on Nexus 7 32gb, says only 6gb disk space I have installed ubuntu on the nexus 7 and have noticed through conky and the file manager that ubuntu says I only have 6gb of disk space. Does anyone have any ideas as to why this is happening or should I file a bug report?\n\nA: There is already a bug filed. For raring, only \"8g\" images are being made, which produces a 6g rootfs.  One of the issues with flashing a larger image is that when you flash the Nexus7, it first copies the image to memory and then writes it out. This limits the image size. Android does offer a \"sparse copy\" which will split the .img files up during the copy operation. However, when we tested this prior to UDS, installs had a 30% failure rate. On promising route might be to resize the image after it copies, when it unpack\n\nA: Solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*boot into stock recovery (volume up + power button)\n\n*factory reset\n\n\nor\n\n\n*\n\n*lock and unlock the bootloader\n\n", "Q: Dash shows programs behind Recently when I have been opening my dash the programs that I have open behind them will flash through.

This may fix your problem.\n\nA: I'm running 12.10 an an Asus N56VJ and lately the dash pops up for no apparent reason and won't go away, and doesn't have a close button.

Downloaded their update client without problems, and updates seem to be working just fine.\nNext steps:\n\n*\n\n*Set up static IP address on Ubuntu Server.\n\n*Go into router settings and forward ports 22 and 80 to my computer's static IP.\n\n*Check functionality with ping and by trying to access the site by name.\n\nI found a lot of information online about setting up static IP addresses with 12.04, but where some sites said to modify resolv.conf, others said that this was an outdated method and that one should just add dns-nameservers xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx to /etc/network/interfaces. Following the latter method, I gave my computer the static address of 192.168.0.200 and modified the router's DHCP range to end at 192.168.0.199. Restarting the network with\n\nsudo ifdown eth0\nsudo ifup eth0\n\nI confirmed that the computer retained the static IP (at least for time being) and killed all dhcp processes.\nI then set up port forwarding for ports 22 and 80 and pinged the gateway, computers on my own LAN, and Google's 8.8.8.8 without issue, with ssh from a home computer also working fine. The noip client continues to update as well.\nThe problem occurs when I try to access the server using the name registered with no-ip.com. The browser tries to load it for a good long while before declaring that it \"Failed to open page\" because the page was not responding.\nAny clue as to what's going on? I don't have a firewall on the server side, and I don't think that the router's is preventing access. One odd thing is that Ubuntu Server does not show up under the router's \"Device Table\" even though the server is clearly connected to the router.\nStumped!\n\nA: Solution found: I was testing the connection to my domain name from my home network, which the computer is setup on. No-ip support informed me that external to the network everything was operating just fine and that to access the server within, I had to use the LAN IP address.\n", "Q: ubuntu 12.04 & Adnroid Debugging I'm really struggling to set up Debugging from my android phone with my 12.04 installation.

However, when I click Select App to Debug on the phone the only option I get is \"NOTHING\".  The only issue I can come up with is that it is somehow related to Ubuntu seeing the phone as a media device.  I've done some research but have found no way of changing this.\n\nA: This may sound trivial but it solved my problem, try a different USB cable, it appears that there are USB cables for charging only not data and charging.

You can keep tabs on the copy if you open up another terminal window and type\nwatch ls -l /path/to/filename/\n\nThis is SOP for data recovery as long as you have the extra disk space (normally you would want to use a SATA drive because of the copying time involved).

But on ma machine this doesn't help, and the other machines run also without this disabling without any problems.\nSo it seems to be a specific problem of this machine and not that 5GHz WLAN would not work properly under Ubuntu/Linux.\nBye\nRalf\n\nA: today I just found out, how to get the 5 GHz network to work.\nI installed the compat-wireless drivers (package linux-backports-modules-cw-3.6-3.5.0-21-generic) on my system and now also this network works without problems.\nMay be, this hint also helps someone, having similar problems.\nJust to add, the chipset on my Acer Aspire S7 is an Atheros Communications Inc.

I don't believe the headers were needed; I installed them just in case ...\nI also avoided a reboot by disabling wireless, then removing and re-installing the ath9k module:\nmodprobe -r ath9k\nmodprobe ath9k\n\nthen re-enabling wireless in Network Manager and connecting.\n", "Q: How to separate fields with space or tab in awk While playing with awk I came to execute:\nls -la >> a.txt ; awk {'print $5  $1'} a.txt ;\n\nThis is giving output like:\n53277-rw-------\n52347-rw-------\n\nHow can I get a space between these two friends of output?\n\nA: Another awk-specific technique, use the \"output field separator\"\nls -la | awk -v OFS='\\t' '{print $5, $1}'\n\nThe comma is crucial here.\n\nA: I know this is an old thread, but I'm just learning and found these posts helpful. My best solution was to use gawk to insert spaces between the variables for you. \nls -la | gawk '{print $1, $9}'\n\n\nA: To place the space between the arguments, just add \" \", e.g. awk {'print $5\"  \"$1'}.\nHowever it is not recommended to parse output of ls command, since it's not reliable and output is for humans, not scripts. Therefore use alternative commands such as find or stat.\nHere is example using GNU stat:\n$ stat -t *\n001.txt 23 8 81a4 501 20 1000004 242236402 1 0 0 1460260387 1460260239 1460260239 1460260194 4096\n7c1c.txt 21 8 81a4 501 20 1000004 242236595 1 0 0 1460261322 1460260486 1460260486 1460260486 4096\n\nwhich will print you machine-friendly output (in terse form), so you can get exactly what you need. Then use -c to use specific format, or use awk, cut or read to get the right columns.\nCheck stat --help for further options. For example to print day of modification, check this example. \n\nA: A simple way to get tabs is:\nawk {'print $5\"\\t\"$1'}\n\n\nA: Just change the line to \nls -la >> a.txt ; awk {'print $5 \"        \" $1'} a.txt ;\n\nthis should print the output with spaces.\nHope this helps.\nEdit:\nAs suggested by McNisse you can use printf, which would provide you good output format\nls -la >> a.txt ; awk {'printf (\"%5s\\t%s\\n\", $5, $1)'} a.txt ;\n\n", "Q: How can I get rid of wine menu entries when wine packages are not uninstalled? I prefer to use PlayOnLinux to configure wine and manage prefixes.\nPlayOnLinux requires wine packages to be installed, but I won't use default /home/$USER/.wine prefix. So I deleted default prefix but can't get rid of default menu entries.\nIf I delete them manually they are recreated, and occasional click on them will recreate default .wine.\nIs there right way to hide all default wine entries?\n\nA: Introduction\nWhenever you make a new WINEPREFIX menu entries and context menu entries are recreated automatically; your default .wine prefix will even be recreated, as you know, if winecfg is run and it the prefix doesn't exist.\nEven though you are probably using different versions of wine and not just the system wine in playonlinux, removing system wine will probably take playonlinux with it, so there are some better alternatives that will stop wine regenerating menu entries all the time.\nPossible Solutions\nI have found that there are really two distinct ways of dealing with the issue: \na) Refer to the wine FAQ and permanently disable the winemenubuilder application, although that would generate quite a lot of error messages if you used default wine to install programs rather than playonlinux in the future. The alternative ways of dealing with winemenubuilder are detailed in the FAQ, such as disabling it when a particular new application is installed or disabling it for all programs to be installed by placing an override in winecfg. \nOR \nb) Just keep deleting the created menu entries by placing the commands below in a script and running it regularly. They are from the wine FAQ, and you should be careful if you use them and make sure you don't make any typos. The commands below will remove wine applications (but not playonlinux ones) from your menus.\nHere is the full list of commands from the wine FAQ; use with caution and avoid typos:\nrm -f ~/.config/menus/applications-merged/wine*  \nrm -rf ~/.local/share/applications/wine  \nrm -f ~/.local/share/desktop-directories/wine*  \n\nIf you wish to see what will be removed, you can use printf with command one and three above to list the items (You can examine the directory mentioned in command two manually if you wish). As an example, \nprintf '%s\\n' ~/.config/menus/applications-merged/wine* \n\nwill format the list of items nicely so it is easily readable:\n/home/mike/.config/menus/applications-merged/wine-Programs-ViewNX 2-ViewNX 2 Help.menu\n/home/mike/.config/menus/applications-merged/wine-Programs-ViewNX 2-ViewNX 2.menu\n/home/mike/.config/menus/applications-merged/wine-Programs-ViewNX 2-ViewNX 2 Readme.menu\n\nConclusion\nIn short, it is up to you which option you choose to use to solve your problem, but I personally think that the simplest way is to place the commands from the wine FAQ in a script and run it periodically.\nIn addition, for a general discussion of how to remove wine context menu entries, which you may also be interested in, see my answer here:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I eliminate wine application options from Thunar's context menu?\nwhich is applicable not just to Thunar and Xfce, but all desktop environments that adhere to XDG standards.\n", "Q: I can't install programs in ubuntu 10.10 \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to install software or upgrade from old unsupported release? \n\nI had to reinstall Ubuntu 10.10.\nNow i can not install programs (flash, chromium...)\nThe computer shows this message: \nW:Failed to fetch http://extras.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/maverick/main/source/Sources.gz  404  Not Found\n\n\nA: Ubuntu 10.10(Maverick Meerkat) had reached end of life on April 10 2012.

The user should go into the shell with no elevated privileges, but execute the first command with elevated privileges.  In the end, the user should be in non-privileged shell that is kept open for further use.\nHow do I do this?\nQuestion Edited For WIP Answer.\nLatest test:\ngksudo \"gnome-terminal --execute bash -c 'boss \"apt-get update\"; bash'\"\n\nDoes not work.\nWhat follows is the answer thanks to Laurent helping me brainstorm.  Unfortunately my situation was too sophisticated for me to express well.\nI have an admin user who never goes online.  He uses proxy users to fetch things and do his bidding.  The user named update is in the sudoers file and is allowed to apt-get with NOPASSWD.  admin wants a shortcut leading to a gnome-terminal that automatically calls apt-get update upon execution because admin wants to install something right after that, something that can't be predicted to be put in a script.  Auto updates won't work for admin, because admin is fire-walled from the internet and is forced to hire goons for system updates and fetching other downloads.\nThank you Laurent for leading me to the right answer! Here it is:\ngksudo -u update \"gnome-terminal --execute bash -c 'sudo apt-get update;bash'\"\n\n\nA: You have to make the launcher using this:\ngksudo \"gnome-terminal --execute bash -c 'apt-get \"update\"; bash'\"\n\nEdit after definition of not opening terminal as root (to leave it in unelevated privileges after running the command:\ngnome-terminal --execute bash -c \"sudo apt-get 'update';bash\"\n\nThis way, the terminal will open, ask for password (if needed) and continue.\nObs: if your command doesn't need sudo, just remove it from the command. I used gksudo on the first answer because your example was using it so I thought it was needed for the whole process (and leaving the terminal in elevated privileges).\nBoth launcher will work but 1st one will ask password with in GUI and run the whole process as sudo leaving the terminal open in \"sudo mode\" and 2nd launcher will open terminal, ask for password there, run command as sudo and leave terminal in \"user mode\".\nYou can edit sudo (with visudo) to make it use sudo without password (and maybe restrict this user to run only a few command if not only this one) but this is not the most recommended thing to do.\nIf you can give more info about what you are trying to do, maybe there is a different way to do it? (can be better... or worse... of course :) ) \n", "Q: Can not see Wine's C drive I have a problem. My Wine has a C drive, but it's invisible. When I try to locate it in terminal, I can see the path: /home/michal/.wine/drive_c/windows\nProblem is, when I open my user directory \"Michal\", the /.wine/ directory is not visible. It's simply not there. How can I access it using Ubuntu's graphic interface?\n\nA: Notice the '.' in front of the directory? On unix systems, the dot means the file is hidden. To view it in nautilus (the program used to view files in the gui, also known as \"files\"), go to your home directory and press \"Ctrl+H\". You will now see a whole bunch of \"dot\" files. Out of these, you will find .wine. The other dot files are used to store resources, settings and other stuff which you don't directly use (instead, a program you use uses the files).\n\nA: Directories starting with . is hidden. You can see hidden files and folders by pressing ctrl+h. And then hide them again by pressing ctrl+h again.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu: Dual-boot repartition exisiting Windows 7 I have been using Ubuntu for 5 years now and had no problem with dual-booting with Windows XP.\nI got a new laptop with preinstalled Windows 7 partitions. The problem is that although there are plenty of space on it, there are already 4 primary partitions on my system. I tried allocating free space on the 2nd large partition but GParted and Ubuntu installer won't let me create a 4th partition.\nI am wondering how I should re partition in order to install ubuntu alongside Win7. If it involves removing a partition or merging, if possible, can you go through explaining the possible consequences involved? \nThanks very much and any help at all is appreciated.\nThe following is a screen-shot of my existing partitions:\n\n\nA: Is there anything on the 4th (10GB) partition? If not I'd suggest you delete it and create the ubuntu system and swap partition in the free space. That would be the simplest way.\nOtherwise you could shrink the 100GB partition and create the ubuntu partitions between the 100GB and the 4GB partition, but that would take a long time and you would probably have to tell windows where it's hibernation partition went...\n\nA: From what I see you have a system partition and a Windows partition followed by a small 4Gb partition and a Windows recovery partition.\nTo get Ubuntu on this machine you will need to remove one partition, replace it with an extended partition. Then, in the extended partition, you may create your Ubuntu (mount point /) and swap partitions.\nI have never done this but one possible solution is to use an Ubuntu live CD or live USB, to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do a backup of one of the partitions, say the small 4Gb one with dd -if /dev/sda3 > partitionimage.dd. Modify thr path of the partitionimage.dd file to an external disk (ex. /media/Data/partitionimage.dd)\n\n*Delete that partition.\n\n*Reduce the Windows partition by say 30Gb.\n\n*Create an extended partition in the empty space left by the two partitions.\n\n*Create your two Ubuntu partitions in the extended partition and another 4Gb one.\n\n*Restore the backup of your original 4Gb partition in this new partition by navigating  in a terminal to the folder where the backup file is and type dd -if partitionimage.dd -of /dev/sda3. Change /dev/sda3 with your new reference for the new partition (ex. /dev/sda6)\n\n\nWARNING: I never did the backup and restore bit of this procedure so I would wait for someone to review it before going through it.\nWARNING 2: This is a MAJOR OPERATION and if something went wrong you could loose everything. Be sure to have a Windows recovery disk and an external backup of your data just in case.\n", "Q: Web server on local network I have problem accessing (one of my) web server from my local network. \nI have a (Ubuntu) computer that that acts as router, web server etc. That works well, I can access the web server both externally and from the internal network. I can also access computers on the internal network via ssh from the outside (re-direction with iptables). \nNow I have another web server on the internal network. I have made some routing paths with iptables. If I in the browser type some.webadress.com:40080 it should go to the “internal” web server.\nThis works: \n\n\n*\n\n*Access the internal web server with the domain name (+port) from an\nexternal network \n\n*Access the internal web server with the internal IP    number (+port)\nfrom the internal network\n\n\nThis does not work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Access the internal web server with the domain name (+port) from the internal network\n\n\nI'm pretty sure that the routing part works ok. The question is if I have to have a DNS or is it something that I should add/change in my /etc/hosts file?\nEDIT:\nSome clarification. The device/webserver that I'm having problem to reach is a webswitch. The webswitch is a device that makes it possible to control a number of high-voltage relays (e.g. car heater, external lights etc.) via the web/phone app. The problem arises when a smartphone is used. If I'm on the 3G net, I use some.webadress.com:40080 (note that I use port translation) and if I'm on the home-wifi I must use 192.168.0.101:8080. What I want to use is some.webadress.com:40080 regardless if I'm on the local net or an external net.\n(The better half in the family is not that interested in technical stuff so having to swift addresses is actually an issue :)\n\nA: hosts file will work well and there is no need to build a DNS server only for that in my opinion.\nAnother way you could consider is making an alias for the webserver virtualhost using an internal name (hostname, hostname.local or hostname.internal.domain, depending on how is your LAN configured) that can be resolved locally without DNS server. This way local machines will be able to access it directly, without using the external IP / router path.\nComments after clarification in original question:\nIf you want to use the same URL on both networks (3G and wifi), using an internal name different of the external one is ruled out as it will be a different URL.\nWhat you may be able to do is to change the hosts file based on the connection you use: One hosts file for wifi (converting the URL to internal IP of the server) and one for 3G (converting to external IP). You can do this with automatic scripts on a computer (running Linux at least) but I have no idea on a smartphone.\nWhen you use some.webadress.com:40080 with the wifi connection, your router doesn't route internal traffic using external addresses. This is one of the purpose of a LAN, to be isolated from public network. \n\n\n*\n\n*I suppose you made the forward in iptables using the input interface and not the destination IP as it is probably dynamic but if you have a fixed public IP, if you use the destination IP + port (your public IP) instead of the input interface + port for the rule, it should work the way you want I think. Anyways, you can try it temporarily using the IP you have at the moment of the test.\n\n*If your IP is dynamic, you have to use the interface as input for the iptables forwarding rule so you may try to forward to the internal IP of the webserver when it comes on the internal interface too instead of only the external one.\n\n*Another option you could try is using the port and source 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 to forward using iptables. \n\nA: Other machines in your network will reach the web server without passing your router; it's in the same local network. You should be able to access your web server from the internal network directly using its IP address, e.g. http://192.168.0.101:8080. I assume that you don't do port translation and your web server runs on the same port on the machine as you configured your router to forward it from.\nIf that works, then you'll only have to tell your machines to talk to 192.168.0.101 when resolving the name some.webadress.com. This is something you should be able to configure on your local DNS server (might be running on your router). You should also make sure your machines in the local network are always using this local DNS server.\nFor example, if you would set up a DNS server in Ubuntu using dnsmasq, it will load the /etc/hosts file on this machine by default, so putting a line\n192.168.0.101     some.webadress.com\n\nwould be sufficient.\nAlternatively, edit the /etc/hosts file on all machines to overrule the answer from DNS. That's a lot harder to maintain, especially when it's about a larger number of machines.\n\nA: Looks like what you want to achieve is NAT loopback. Found this guide:\nhttp://for-invent.com/nat-loopback-using-iptables/\nSomething in the line of: \niptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -s 192.168.0.0/24 -d some.webaddress.com -p tcp --dport 40080 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.0.101:8080\niptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -d 192.168.0.101 -s 192.168.0.0/24 -p tcp --dport 8080 -j SNAT --to-source some.webaddress.com\n\nNot 100% sure about the --dport value in the POSTROUTING rule though, if the above doesn't work, try with 40080 instead.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Wireless problems with Broadcom BCM4313 I have a wireless problem with this wifi adapter. At first when installing my Ubuntu 12.10 the STA driver was working fine. Then my wired connection wasn't working. After installing the alx driver and modprobing it the wire started working flawlessly. Then my wireless failed. There wasn't anything about wireless in the network manager. \nI've already looked and did what is said here, here.

I've added the b43 driver in /etc/modules.\nThen my wireless started working again for a while (1-2 minutes of browsing) and then disconnected. The only wireless network my laptop finds is my own wireless network (the router is next to my PC). There are a number of other networks in my building that don't show. After a reboot, the wireless 'decided' not to work again - int the network manager it's only stated : \"Wireless Networks disconnected\". So now I have only wired connection.\nThere is the output of some commands related to the issue:\nlspci -vvnn | grep 14e4:\n03:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Broadcom Corporation BCM4313 802.11b/g/n Wireless LAN Controller [14e4:4727] (rev 01)\nSubsystem: Broadcom Corporation Device [14e4:0587]\n\niwconfig:\neth1      no wireless extensions.\nlo        no wireless extensions.\n\nwlan0     IEEE 802.11bgn  ESSID:off/any  \n      Mode:Managed  Access Point: Not-Associated   Tx-Power=19 dBm   \n      Retry  long limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off\n      Power Management:off\n\nrfkill list all:\n0: ideapad_wlan: Wireless LAN\nSoft blocked: no\nHard blocked: no\n1: ideapad_bluetooth: Bluetooth\nSoft blocked: no\nHard blocked: no\n2: phy1: Wireless LAN\nSoft blocked: no\nHard blocked: no\n\nlsmod:\nModule                  Size  Used by\nnfnetlink_log          17845  0 \nnfnetlink              14327  1 nfnetlink_log\nsnd_hda_codec_hdmi     32007  1 \nsnd_hda_codec_conexant    57842  1 \nparport_pc             32688  0 \nppdev                  17073  0 \nrfcomm                 42651  0 \nbnep                   18140  2 \nbluetooth             204950  10 rfcomm,bnep\narc4                   12529  2 \ncoretemp               13400  0 \nkvm                   414070  0 \nghash_clmulni_intel    13180  0 \naesni_intel            51037  0 \ncryptd                 20403  2 ghash_clmulni_intel,aesni_intel\naes_x86_64             17208  1 aesni_intel\nbrcmsmac              531127  0 \nbrcmutil               14755  1 brcmsmac\ncordic                 12535  1 brcmsmac\nsnd_hda_intel          33491  3 \nsnd_hda_codec         134212  3        snd_hda_codec_hdmi,snd_hda_codec_conexant,snd_hda_intel\nsnd_hwdep              13602  1 snd_hda_codec\nsnd_pcm                96580  3 snd_hda_codec_hdmi,snd_hda_intel,snd_hda_codec\nb43                   370289  0 \nmac80211              549340  2 brcmsmac,b43\ncfg80211              211133  3 brcmsmac,b43,mac80211\nsnd_seq_midi           13324  0 \nsnd_rawmidi            30512  1 snd_seq_midi\nsnd_seq_midi_event     14899  1 snd_seq_midi\nsnd_seq                61521  2 snd_seq_midi,snd_seq_midi_event\nideapad_laptop         18086  0 \nsparse_keymap          13890  1 ideapad_laptop\nsnd_timer              29425  2 snd_pcm,snd_seq\nsnd_seq_device         14497  3 snd_seq_midi,snd_rawmidi,snd_seq\nnouveau               895609  0 \npsmouse                95552  0 \nuvcvideo               76749  0 \nserio_raw              13215  0 \nvideobuf2_core         32851  1 uvcvideo\nvideodev              120309  2 uvcvideo,videobuf2_core\nvideobuf2_vmalloc      12860  1 uvcvideo\njoydev                 17457  0 \nvideobuf2_memops       13368  1 videobuf2_vmalloc  \nttm                    83595  1 nouveau\nlpc_ich                17061  0 \nmac_hid                13205  0 \ni915                  520539  3 \nsnd                    78734  16     snd_hda_codec_hdmi,snd_hda_codec_conexant,snd_hda_intel,snd_hda_codec,snd_hwdep,snd_pcm,s    nd_rawmidi,snd_seq,snd_timer,snd_seq_device\nalx                    81256  0 \nmxm_wmi                12979  1 nouveau\nwmi                    19070  2 nouveau,mxm_wmi\nbcma                   40069  2 brcmsmac,b43\nssb                    61895  1 b43\nsoundcore              15047  1 snd\nsnd_page_alloc         18484  2 snd_hda_intel,snd_pcm\npcmcia                 48964  2 b43,ssb\npcmcia_core            22569  1 pcmcia\ncompat                 14949  10    rfcomm,bnep,bluetooth,brcmsmac,b43,mac80211,cfg80211,alx,bcma,ssb\nmei                    40690  0 \ndrm_kms_helper         49112  2 nouveau,i915\nrts5139               356158  0 \nmicrocode              22803  0 \ndrm                   288670  6 nouveau,ttm,i915,drm_kms_helper\nlp                     17759  0 \nparport                46345  3 parport_pc,ppdev,lp\ni2c_algo_bit           13413  2 nouveau,i915\nvideo                  19335  2 nouveau,i915\nhid_generic            12493  0 \nusbhid                 46947  0 \nhid                   100366  2 hid_generic,usbhid\n\nCan someone give any ideas on how I can fix my wireless to run smoothly?\n\nA: I was seeing the same error message on modprobe wl as Dimitar, on an Ideapad with bcm4314.\n# dmesg | tail -2\n[ 2795.255929] wl: disagrees about version of symbol lib80211_get_crypto_ops\n[ 2795.255938] wl: Unknown symbol lib80211_get_crypto_ops\n\nThis led me to this bug report, where removing the linux-backports-modules was suggested.\n# apt-get remove linux-backports-modules-*\n# apt-get install --reinstall bcmwl-kernel-source\n# reboot\n\nmade wifi work again.\n\nA: Ok, so after a while digging I found out some stuff. I decided to reinstall my Ubuntu 12.10 (completely erased the previous one so everything is 'clean') and to try to work with the bcmwl driver. On the install page everything is fine - the wl driver (bcmwl-kernel-source) was working fine. After doing apt-get update my linux version updated from 3.5.0-17 to 3.5.0-21 . Then after reboot the wl module does not get loaded. When I issue the modprobe wl command I get a message that the module is not found. After following a forum suggestion I created a symlink in /lib/modules/3.5.0-21-generic/ to the file wl.ko located in /lib/modules/3.5.0-17-generic/updates/dkms/. After running depmod -a and modprobe wl I get: \nFATAL: Error iserting wl (/lib/modules/3.5.0-21-generic/wl.ko): Invalid argument\nFATAL: Error running install command for wl\n\ndmesg says: this\nSo there is some mismatch with symbols. As I read here I think that after updating there isn't a new wl version for 3.5.0-21 and the kernel won't load the old wl as it sees that it is for an older version of the kernel. Am I correct in this statement ? And what is the support of this driver (I know that it isn't managed by the ubuntu community) but is it always behind updates ? (not to mention that my wired connection doesn't work with it at all).\n", "Q: How to add a shortcut to a command to the Cinnamon menu? Is there a utility I can use to add an icon to the Cinnamon menu which runs a user-specified command, and as a bonus, displays a user-specified icon?\nspecifically I'm trying to add a command to open a virtual machine directly, without having to keep the terminal open.\nVirtualBox --startvm <myMachineName> --seamless\n\nworks fine with alt-F2, but I'd rather have a short-cut so I don't have to type it out.\n\nA: or you could just use the\ncinnamon-menu-editor\n\n(Also available by right clicking the start button, selecting configure and Open the menu editor.)\n\nTip: When adding a custom icon, be careful to locate the icon image somewhere you won't be likely to change in the future.\n\nA: Simply create a gnome desktop link and place it in .local/share/applications/\nfor personal menu links.\nSigh: some installers install their desktop links into .gnome/apps/\nso you might want to link them:\n$ ln -s .gnome/apps/*.desktop .local/share/applications/\n\nAs pointed out by @roman-raguet https://askubuntu.com/a/232083/37280 place it into /usr/share/applications for all users\nAs pointed out by @mockfrog https://askubuntu.com/a/800605/37280 you might create this personal entry by cinnamon-menu-editor graphical tool. Run it with sudo for all-users\n\nA: You can create a .desktop file to add your command to the Cinnamon menu.\nFirst, create a little script eg: In your home directory\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your terminal and type:\ngedit /home/user/myvm.sh\n\n\n*Type the following:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Save the file in your home directory and change the permissions with:\nchmod 775 /home/user/myvm.sh\n\n\n*Then you can create a desktop file, in the terminal type:\ncd /usr/share/applications\nsudo -H gedit myvm.desktop\n\n\n*Add the following information:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Save the changes and make sure the .desktop has the right permissions, in the terminal type:\nsudo chmod 644 /usr/share/applications/myvm.desktop\n\nYou can change the information according to your needs, in this case in the field \"Icon\" put your path to your custom icon, and this should be visible under the Cinnamon menu in the category \"System Tools\" with the name \"My VM\".\n\nIf you want, you can add it to your cinnamon panel with right click in the icon \"My VM\" in the Menu, and then choose \"add to panel\"\n\n\nA: For anyone else looking for a simpler solution, then the following offers a GUI interface for adding custom launchers to your panel:\ncd /usr/share/cinnamon/applets/panel-launchers@cinnamon.org/\n./cinnamon-add-panel-launcher.py\n\n", "Q: I cannot get /mnt/hgfs in ubuntu 12.10 I have installed Ubuntu 12.10 in VMWare 5.i need to mount my project(using aptana studio 3,Ruby on Rails project in my workspace).I have even shared workspace in VMWare.but still i cannot see it when i run cd /mnt/hgfs/my workspace/project_1,there is no hgfs folder in mnt.I have ruby on 1.9.2 and rails 3.2.\n\nA: you probably have to run like\ncd /mnt/hgfs/my\\ workspace/project_1\n\n", "Q: Self-hosted browser based IRC client alternatives I have looked at the self-hosted web browser based IRC-clients Subway and Alice as I never seem to get an invite for IRCcloud.\nThe two alternatives I have found suffer from really bad bugs. They work for about an hour, and then it seems their communication with their backends just falls apart. Subway duplicates all open channels ever few hours and sometimes sporadically reloads. Alice has ridiculously long delays for delivering messages. Side-by-side with another client it can be up to 15 minutes (!) out of sync, and that will not do for an instant messaging client.\nAre there any other alternatives I should take a look at? or services?\nThe desktop IRC clients for Linux simply does not cut it for me, and I like having a persistent connection that I can join from wherever.\n\nA: In case someone stops by years later, The Lounge (website / source code), in its private mode (see the configuration docs), will do what the OP wanted :)\nIt is an actively-developed, official fork of Shout (mentioned in another answer here) now inactive, and is recommended by the author of Subway (mentioned by the OP).\n\n\nA: The following clients are my favorites. \n\n\n*\n\n*Kiwi IRC - Open source.\n\n*Light IRC - Closed source. Uses Flash.\n\n*qweb IRC - Open source. The network Freenode uses it. \n\n\nI hope this helps!\n\nA: I would like to offer the suggestion of \"Shout\".

In Ubuntu, Apache is configured to run as user www-data. Make sure you set the permissions on your filesystem to allow Apache reading the whole path.\nTo test whether this is really your issue, try in a terminal\nsudo su -l www-data -s /bin/bash\n\nand then cd step by step to your Dropbox folder:\ncd /home\ncd me\ncd Dropbox\ncd Web\n\nFix the permissions, e.g.\n\n\n*\n\n*chmod o+rx on directories and chmod o+r on files, or\n\n*change groups on files/directories chgrp www-data and allow only the www-data group to read/access: chmod g+r for files and chmod g+rx for directories.\n\n\nA: www-data, the group/user Apache runs is not allowed to read in your home directory.\nYou can use regular permissions to change that as gertvdijk explained in its answer.\nI would consider using acl instead of regular permissions, allowing to add permission to apache instead of replacing the group in home directory or making the directory world readable.\nFor that, you need to install acl:\nsudo apt-get install acl\n\nYou can use man setfacl to have more info.\nTo add permissions to apache:\nsudo setfacl -m d:g:www-data:X,g:www-data:X /home/me\nsudo setfacl -m d:g:www-data:X,g:www-data:X /home/me/Dropbox\nsudo setfacl -Rm d:g:www-data:rX,g:www-data:rX /home/me/Dropbox/Web\n\n1st and 2nd commands will allow Apache (www-data) to change directory only through the path (without allowing other subdirectories) in your home.  They are probably not needed if you are using default config but if you already changed permissions (or will change in the future) to disalow other users to read in your home, they are needed.\nThe 3rd one is the command that will allow Apache to read and change directories in Dropbox/web and sub-directories).\nObs: uppercase X will act only on directories instead of lowercase x that would act on both files and directories (this way apache user is only able to change directories, not executing files).\n", "Q: How do I find the chokepoint in my private ethernet network? I'm currently living in a rather austere part of the world where I have limited access to good computer hardware. I have a private network set up where an old IBM thinkpad laptop (Lubuntu 12.10) sits on my \"porch\" where it can see a wifi network. It shares its connection through its ethernet port and is connected to a no-name ethernet hub. In my room I use a somewhat more modern HP Elitebook 8440p (Ubuntu 12.04 LTS). The setup is quite satisfactory for web browsing and ssh. However, the ethernet connection is definitely very slow and I don't know why. For instance, ping from one machine to the other gives me times that are > 700 ms and large file scp between machines settles down at ~1.1 MB/s.\nI would like to know what is limiting my connection speed, whether it's settings or hardware. However, I have no idea how to go about it.\nIf it's hardware, my options are limited at the moment, but it would be good to know. OTOH, if I can isolate the problem to the generic hub, I can possibly get my hands on a crossover ethernet cable.\nregards,\n\nA: have you tired bypassing the hub? the Ethernet card in the 8440p should be auto sensing so you shouldn't have to have a crossover cable \n", "Q: Cannot run executable file - SPAZ installer After reinstalling my Ubuntu (right now I have 12.04.1) I'm trying to install SPAZ, but when I run the installer:\ngacek@gacek-Vostro-3460:~$ ./spaz-linux-humblebundle-09182012-bin \nbash: ./spaz-linux-humblebundle-09182012-bin: No such file or directory\n\nit says there's no such file.

I first noticed the problem when using google sketchup together with sketchy physics, but this problem actually occurs in all my wine programs.\nSpecifically, whenever I would click or select or whatever some part of my model in sketchup, the object would not highlight until I did something else that would update the display.  For instance, I click on one of the edges of a cube.  No change to the display.  Then I click on the side of the cube.  The display now shows the edge highlighted.

No need to reboot Ubuntu, the 'Bose' output device disappeared and re-appeared during the process, and now the sound is going out fine.\nI usually leave the Bose system on 24x7, plugged into a power surge protected line, but for some reason, it seems like it crashed.

Windows doesn't have in-built ability to read or write on this filesystem.\nYou would have to use a tool like Ext2Read. However, this isn't a perfect option. It won't allow you to write on Ubuntu's Partition. So you would only be able to read the files and copy them on your NTFS/FAT32 Partition in Windows. There is one more drawback that it sometimes fails to copy large files/folders. You must always cross-check even while copying smaller files.\nHowever, the best way to access these files is Log into Ubuntu and copy the files which you require to your Windows Partition.\n", "Q: Gamepad Controller issues on Ubuntu 12.04+ For whatever reason I can never get any of my controllers to work properly on Ubuntu. The main one I want to get working is the Xbox 360 controller (wired, not wireless). It detects the L and R triggers as axis which causes serious issues in a majority of games. I press any of the triggers and it suddenly makes the game unplayable. A similar issue occurs with the PS3 Controller.\nI thought that if I bought a PC game controller it would fix my issue...but man was I wrong. Is there some type of secret method to getting this to work...I'm so irritated!!!\nEven configuring inputs for emulators is a pain.

Please help me maximize the battery life of my lenovo\n\nA: 'Laptop mode tools' has become obsolete. I suggest to check out the Ubuntu wiki on Kernel/PowerManagement/PowerSavingTweaks and the Jupiter applet.\n\nA: Don't bother with laptop mode or Jupiter, the best tool is at www.linrunner.de called TLP and it has a PPA, this is the only one that works well minus any intervention.

I just installed ubuntu 12.10 with windows xp. It's success, but after login just background, no bar, no button and there is no anything. What is the problem? \n\nA: I had a similar problem with 12.10.  I would suggest downloading and installing 12.04, because it is an LTS, and will be supported until 2017.\nI would also suggest using Lubuntu if your machine is really old and slow.\nhttp://cdimage.ubuntu.com/lubuntu/releases/12.04/release/\nThough the regular Ubuntu interface is very nice... you can get it here\nhttp://releases.ubuntu.com/precise/\n", "Q: why is maximum resolution 640x480 with Nvidia? My old computer is used by my mother now. I have installed Lubuntu 12.04 on it (on 2012.11.02), replacing the old, but perfectly working Lubuntu 11.04.\nAfter installing 12.04, it was OK for a while, but after a time, I think, there were some software updates, and resolution fall back to 640x480.\nI have tried many fixes.\n\n\n*\n\n*open source nvidia driver (nouveau, nvidia-96, experimental 310)\n\n*previous version of nvidia driver...\n\n*edit xorg.conf (the best result was that I copied the existing xorg.conf from my desktop computer, and with it, there is a 1280x1024 resolution, which still not fits to this widescreen monitor)\n\n\nBut no success.\nThe VGA card is a FX5200, which is supported by Nvidia 173 driver... But if it is supported, why is maximum resolution 640x480 with it? (I noticed, too, that my monitor is also unknown by the system.)\nStrange problem, too : the nvidia-settings is now reporting that the nvidia driver is too old, and he can't use it, even if there is the latest nvidia driver installed. \nI can agree with the open source driver, this computer is not used for gaming, or such things. So I only want a resolution, fitting to the widescreen monitor (1280x768, 1280x720, or 1440x900).\n\nA: http://www.iloveubuntu.net/easily-increase-screen-resolutions-indicator-scaleres\n\nIf the user's screen features a 1440x900 resolution, the xrandr-based\n  Indicator ScaleRes will add (as extra resolutions) 1585x991, 1800x1125\n  and 1872x1170, basically, multiplying the native screen resolution by\n  1.10, 1.25, 1.30\n\nI have not had the same problems as you, though I have Lubuntu on an old machine with Nvidia as well.  I can only use the stock Ubuntu driver, because the driver that would work for my machine nvidia-96 depends on xorg-video-abi-10 which unfortunately doesn't exist... whoops.  This bug also affects YOU.  Look through this bug report for more details.\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nvidia-graphics-drivers-173/+bug/948053\n\nA: Don't forget that when you install nvidia-current (or updates) then the nvidia-settings program also gets installed.  It's often necessary to run nvidia-settings, select the best resolution, then tell it to save the configuration (actually, it saves /etc/X11/xorg.conf).\nIf you still have problems look in the /etc/X11/xorg.conf and see if it's tried to set VertRefresh and HorizSync to rediculously low settings that only allow 640x480 resolutions to be selected.  It's a bug that I've been coming across, from time to time, but it's hard to say what triggers it.  If the screen is working OK apart from \nthe resolution then this is worth a look.\nEdit:\nBased on the data in your xorg.conf, it looks like you are trying to acheive 1440x900 at 60Hz.  Running cvt with these parameters gives a modeline of \nModeline \"1440x900_60.00\"  106.50  1440 1528 1672 1904  900 903 909 934 -hsync +vsync\n\nYou should delete or comment out the metamodes (never found them useful) and instead substitute this mode line.  Restart X and see if it gives you option to change to this resolution.\n", "Q: Updated system and Firefox now won't let me type tildes or backquotes % uname -a\nLinux phoebe 3.2.0-33-generic #52-Ubuntu SMP Thu Oct 18 16:29:15 UTC 2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nI'm running 12.04 on the machine I'm typing this on, and I've been running it for quite some time.  I just did a dist-upgrade, and it included some update for Firefox (to 17.0.1 now).  After restarting the browser, I noted with some surprise that I can't type back-quotes or tildes.  They worked just a few minutes ago before the update, but not now.\nI use a Deck keyboad, and I have the back-quote/tilde key remapped. I've had the keyboard for many years now and the remapping has always worked:\n% xmodmap -pk | egrep tilde\n133         0x0060 (grave)  0x007e (asciitilde)     0x0060 (grave)  0x007e (asciitilde)\n\nI can type those characters into xterm windows, into Chrome, gvim, gedit, etc.  What in the world is going on with Firefox?  I can't find any relevant configuration options, and I certainly haven't been tinkering with them.  I've tried restarting it a couple times too.\nI'll try running a new clean profile and see if that makes a difference; I do have some add-ons but nothing new and nothing particularly crazy. edit Nope, can't type the characters in a plain-jane profile either.\nedit — reinstalled Firefox, same thing.\nedit again — I've also found that VirtualBox seems to ignore the xmodmap remapping.  I've basically got the grave/tilde key swapped with another key that's remapped to \"Alt\".  In VirtualBox now (I don't think it was always this way, but I'm not 100% sure), I can type back-quote or tilde with the key that's swapped to \"Alt\".  However, that does not work in Firefox — neither key works as the grave/tilde key, though I've just verified that the remapped \"Alt\" key in Firefox does work (as \"Alt\")!!\nedit yet again — upgraded to 12.10, same problem. Something changed somewhere, as I am 100% positive that that key was working today and over the past many months. (Why? How do you quote code snippets inline in Markdown? I'm on Stackoverflow a lot and that's how I noticed it was broken.)\n\nA: My old (and I mean old) xmodmap remapping file included these two key lines:\nkeycode 49 = Alt_L\nkeycode 133 = grave asciitilde\n\nThose two lines accomplished the remapping only partially.  What I had failed to do was this:\nadd mod1 = Alt_L\nremove mod4 = Super_L\n\nThe key that I wanted to be the accent/tilde key had been a modifier key, for \"mod4\", with the keysym \"Super_L\". For some reason, that didn't start causing a problem until yesterday. Here I am in Firefox typing back-quotes just like before!!\nSo the bottom line is this: if you remap key symbols, make sure to check the modifier map. You can check the initial state of keys by starting a fresh X session and then typing:\nxmodmap -pk\n\nThen, view the initial modifier map with:\nxmodmap\n\nIf you change keysyms for keycodes, make sure you add/remove them from the modifier map as necessary.\nedit — oh also you can use xev to figure out what the keycode/keysym for a particular key is. Just run it from a terminal window; it's kind-of a mess but just mouse over its little window and press the key a couple times. Use ^C (control-C) in the terminal window to stop it, or I guess the \"Close\" thingy on the window.\n", "Q: How to install ethernet driver on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS with working wireless connection?

And finally make the user own it own files (chown)\nsudo edit /etc/passwd\nsudo chown -R 499 UserName\n\nA second option is to edit /etc/lightdm/users.conf, add the user that you want to hide to the list of hidden-users.\nTo login with the hidden user I think would be difficult, or hide all users and let them type in their username. A workaround I think that would work is to press ctrl-f1 (to f6) login to console and then write \nstartx \n\nto start kubuntu would work\n\nA: To enable manual login (so you can enter the hidden username also):\nsudo sh -c 'echo \"greeter-show-manual-login=true\" >> /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf'\n\nsee this thread: \nhttp://www.liberiangeek.net/2012/10/quickly-enable-root-login-in-ubuntu-12-10-quantal-quetzal/\n", "Q: Problem with internet-connected ubuntu apps (Software Center, Nuvola Player, Lightread, Ubuntu Tweak) in 12.10 quantal quetzal) There seems to be something broken with the Ubuntu Software Center (or at least my install of it), and what ever it is also effects some other internet-connected native ubuntu apps (Ubuntu Tweak, Nuvola Player, and Lightread (although lightread doesn't give the error message)).\nWhen I try to install a free app that goes through the payment service (as in one that you 'buy' for $0.00), or a paid app, in the Software Center, I get this message:\n*Unable to load page\nProblem occurred while loading the URL https://software-center.ubuntu.com/subscriptions/en/ubuntu/quantal/+new/?archive_id=commercial-ppa-uploaders%2Fstormcloud&arch=amd64\nCannot resolve hostname (software-center.ubuntu.com)*\nNuvola gives me a similar message:\nUnable to load page\nProblem occurred while loading the URL http://8tracks.com/\nCannot resolve hostname (8tracks.com)\nAnd Ubuntu Tweak gives:\nUnable to load page\nProblem occurred while loading the URL (I have to put this text here so it's not more than two hyperlinks in the post)http://ubuntu-tweak.com/utapp/\nCannot resolve hostname (ubuntu-tweak.com)\nI have tried reinstalling everything other than the Software Center.

Normally when window in installed on a machine running ubuntu, GRUB is replaced by native window's MBR. This is what happens when you are expecting a GRUB loader to come up and you are surprisingly greeted with nothing but windows booting up. Here is what I did to repair my GRUB loader.\nTo repair GRUB, you can use any live cd to boot into ubuntu and open up terminal and then issue the command sudo grub-install . Well, in many cases, that fails. For that, you have to manually mount the root partition and then re-install the GRUB into it. It follows as:\nsudo fdisk -l \n...list of devices and partions\n//here find out the root partition (mine is sda3, so i am condireing /dev/sda3 here)\n\nsudo mkdir /mnt/anyname\nsudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/anyname\ncd /mnt/anyname\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt/anyname /dev/sda\n\nThis will re-install your GRUB. If you are encountering any problem in installing the GRUB, just go to google, there are millions of guides on \"installing the grub in linux\". \nMerry Christmas :)\n\nA: I have successfully achieved dual boot from installation on the primary hard drive with the following configuration and issues:\nHardware; August 2012 build HP Envy DV7 laptop, Windows 8, i5 Ivy Bridge, UEFI/Secure Boot.\nLinux: Ubuntu 12.10 x64 ISO.\nIn UEFI (F10 menu):\n•\n•Disable Secure Boot. I could not achieve boot in any configuration with it on.\n•\n•UEFI boot scheme (not Legacy BIOS). I tried Legacy mode, and can boot from disk, but not from an installation on the hard drive. UEFI flies right by it during boot every way I tried with it on.\nIn Ubuntu:\n•\n•/Boot=EFI, /=EXT4, /Home=EXT4, SWAP=swap\nWith this configuration I can boot with user intervention during the boot sequence: 1) Select F9 Boot options in UEFI (BIOS) 2) Select the now avialble Ubuntu 12.10 option and procede.\n3) Immediately the Ubuntu boot option screen is now available. Select prefered option and procede. 4) I'm in.\nIf anyone following this thread comes up with a way for the Windows UEFI boot loader to recognize the /Boot partition manually, please share. The above method is not that much of a pain, but an automatic boot whence windows recognizes Ubuntu as a boot option would be a somewhat more elegant affair. Also, I would prefer to have Windows handle the primary boot sequence, and not grub, as a personal preference, so I can live with the above until other options are available.\nGregg\n", "Q: Dell XPS 15z Overheats When Using Optirun I installed Bumblebee on my Dell XPS 15z running Ubuntu 12.10.

To fix this, boot into a live session of Ubuntu (or any Linux Distribution that uses GRUB), open a command line and run the command sudo grub-install /dev/sda. That will reinstall grub and you will be able to choose between Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04 to boot from.\n\nA: When I reinstalled my Windows OS, I ran into the same issue.  I decided to fix it by using Window's boot manager instead of GRUB, so if you really want GRUB this won't help you, but:\nBoot into Windows (obviously, you don't have any other choice) and download EasyBCD.  Watch this video tutorial that will explain how to use EasyBCD to configure the Windows Boot Manager.  In this process, you will add an entry for Windows and an entry for Ubuntu, so when you start your computer you will be prompted to chose one (or boot into Windows by default - you can change all that too). The caveat is that the Ubuntu entry will take you into GRUB, where you will be again prompted to chose an OS.  That will allow you to get into Ubuntu, but to avoid the extra boot menu, you may want to change the GRUB timeout to 0 or .1 seconds.  Here's a tutorial on the timeout change.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: What is Unity Panel? Could someone point out to me what Unity Panel looks like?

I have a source tarball: ap-kernelmodule-1.0.14-13.tar.gz\nI have to compile a kernel module out of it and was instructed to install development tools for my Ubuntu version (which is 12.10).\nThe format is: sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) build-essential\nQuestion #1: what is uname?\n(When I installed Ubuntu, I input sharon as my name and which is also my account name. Whenever I open a terminal window, the words sharon@sharon: appear)\nBased on the format, I should input:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(sharon -r) build-essential\n\nor\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-$sharon -r build-essential\n\nQuestion #2: Which of the above is correct?\n(I am new to Linux and Ubuntu; hence detailed instructions are appreciated)\n\nA: uname is a command which must be entered at the commandline. So if you open a terminal and type uname it outputs the word Linux. In the command you mentioned you find -r. This is an option to uname. It instructs uname to print the kernel release number. So it will basically print out some numbers (like 3.2.0-41-amd64).\nYou should enter the command\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) build-essential\n\nlike it is written. The $(something) tells your commandline (better word would be shell) to execute the command something and insert the output of that command.\nSo in your uname case (assuming that the number I wrote is correct, which might not be in your case) the command which is executed is sudo apt-get install linux-headers-3.2.0-41-amd64 build-essential. Basically you could just look for your kernel version and insert it manually.\nAs you now see none of your versions is correct. The solution looks a bit different.\n\nA: Do not copy my commands, you must type them in and use your tab key becuase my kernel may be different than yours.  I explain play by play:\nOpen up a terminal and type:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThis update gives your computer a heads up of files you may need.  But no files download, only information on what can be downloaded.  If you didn't do this first, you may not have the latest link to security updates or the latest versions of software.\nAs you type, press the tab key, to finish your command.  Start typing the command that will install build-essential.  Once you get this far stop:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-\n\nThe next part that should appear will be your Linux kernel.  So open another terminal and type this:\nuname -r\n\nYou should see something like this:\n3.2.0-23-generic\n\nNow go back to the other terminal and press tab as type.  You should see your kernel pop up.  Choose that one.\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-3.2.0-23-generic\n\nNow type a space and add build-essential (don't forget use your tab for completion).\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-3.2.0-23-generic build-essential\n\nNow hit enter and files will download that help you compile code.\n", "Q: How do I extract this source tarball? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat command do I need to unzip/extract a .tar.gz file? \n\nI have a source tarball: ap-kernelmodule-1.0.14-13.tar.gz\n\n\n*\n\n*What specific commands should I issue to extract it?\n\n*What is the default folder/directory of the extracted contents?\n\n*Can I change the destination folder/directory of the extracted contents?\nI am new to Linux and Ubuntu; hence detailed instructions are appreciated.\n\nA: Drag and drop the tar ball to where you want to extract (I keep my windows wide, so I prefer F3) .

I create a document with Ubuntu on comp1 and then copy the file onto a FAT formatted USB flash drive. Via the flash drive I paste the document onto comp2. The problem is that the file-permissions are never preserved during the transfer. I'm assuming because the FAT is not supporting the permissions.\nIs there a solution to this? Should I continue to use FAT file system for USB flash drives (because FAT is best for flash drives) and just live with this permissions issue? Or is it recommended to reformat my flash drive with a more \"Ubuntu Friendly\" file system that will preserve the permissions?\n\nA: You can try formatting your drive as UDF(Universal Disk Format). It is the format for use on CD's and DVD's. Most modern OSes will be able to read and write to it.\nRight now, looking at my data on UDF formatted drive, Linux file permissions seem to be preserved. So far, it's worked for me.\nAnother good thing about UDF formatted drive is that it can store a single large file of up to 16 Exabyte(correct me if I'm wrong.), whereas Fat32 can only store a file of size 4GB or less and MAX partition size for FAT32 is only 2TB.\nIt works good on Win7 and 8. For older Windows OSes like XP and 2000, you can read from the drive but you have to install some sort of driver to write to it.\nFor Mac, OS X 10.5 and above has full compatibility.\nHere's a full compatibility chart.\nUDF Compatibility Chart\nOn Ubuntu, follow these steps to format a drive as UDF.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install udftools\n\nOkay, now you want to delete the current partitions in the target drive.\nYou can either use a GUI tool like Disk Utility, or do the following.\nsudo blkid\n\nFind your drive in the output. (they look something like /dev/sdb or /dev/sdc)\nNow do the following, but replace the 'x' in /dev/sdx to point to the drive that you want to clear its partition. Do this for both lines of code.\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdx bs=1M count=1\nsudo mkudffs -b 512 --media-type=hd --utf8 --lvid=DriveLabel --vid=DriveLabel --fsid=DriveLabel  /dev/sdx\n\nYou could alter where it says 'DriveLabel' to your liking.\nThat should be it.\nActually, I do this slightly differently, but decided that this method was easier to follow. I referenced this method from this site.\nI hope this helps someone out there.\n\nA: When using a filesystem which preserves user IDs on a USB drive you may face problems caused by the fact that user IDs are assigned in the order user accounts are created, and the filesystem actually stores numeric IDs of file owners, not usernames. So if, say, machine A has alice and bob accounts, and machine B has bruce, zoe and alice accounts then it likely that when Alice copies her files to an ext(2/3/4)-formatted USB drive, walks to machine B and tries to access the files she will discover that the files are all owned by bruce and are read-only for alice.\nOf course, if you only have one user on both machines then this won't be a problem.\nTransferring files packed in a tar archive, as proposed by @FSMaxB may solve this problem because when you unpack an archive the files will be created owned by your user ID.\n\nA: ext4 is a journalling filesystem which means that if the device is unplugged prematurely it stands more of a chance of recovering the damaged filesystem. The journal part of the write contains information about what is about to be done and it gets cleared after the operation is completed.  If it is found that there is an uncompleted journal on a device when it is mounted, the filesystem can be reverted to it's previous state thereby preserving its integrity.\nWhile there is some extra overhead in terms of space involved in having a journalling filesystem on a USB stick, it's actually a good choice for most things.\nObviously, if you need a device that can also plug into any computer at any time then FAT would be the way to go.  If you want a device that needs to be plugged into one Windows computer only occasionally, then it's possible to install ext2 device drivers in Windows that will allow it to read any and all ext(x) drives.  Of course, since Windows doesn't know about Linux permissions and ownership these will not be handled as well.\n\nA: If you use your flash drive only with linux systems, you may use one of the ext-filesystems e.g. ext4 but when using with other systems, FAT is the only compatible file system.\nOne way of using FAT and preserving permissions (not ownership) would be the usage of tar-Archives!\n\nA: I'm using reiserfs for years on USB-Sticks without problems. Well - just that they aren't readable from windows systems which might not be bad, if they get lost.\nIf you partition a stick, to use parts with Windows for data exchange, make sure the windowspartition is the first one - else it won't be identified (at least for XP I made the experience).\nYou can build a fat-filesystem (aren't they pretty limited for todays stick sizes?) and add an big but empty file to it, and mount that file as a loop device in Ubuntu. Then you will be able to preserve your file permissions, and to increase or decrease the reserved space without partitioning or formatting. \nAs already mentioned: Tars, Zips and so on are another possibility.\n", "Q: How do I use testdisk? I would really appreciate it if someone could give me a walkthrough in testdisk. I wouldn't ask for this, but I caused this problem by trying to fix things myself using testdisk without really knowing how, so now I'm nervous to try anything else.\n\n\nI was messing with it trying to fix another problem and now I only have 1 partition out of the 9 that there was.

I have an established home web server (I am the only admin/user) that runs Apache and hosts my web pages.  I have MySQL installed, and was able to create and query a database through Terminal.  I have PHP installed, and can use echo to print text to the document.  When I work with MySQL however, everything changes…\nI have a page that contains initialization stuff in .  contains a few paragraphs of hardcoded HTML and then PHP code to access MySQL.  When I first loaded the page, all that resulted was a blank page.  I commented out the PHP section and reloaded to confirm that the plain HTML still worked, which it did.  Therefore, some part of PHP was keeping any of the page from ever loading.  \nTo begin troubleshooting my code, I left all of the PHP code commented except the following code for the server connection, which is adapted from several different tutorials:\n<?\necho(\"<p>PHP is working</p>\"); \n$ses = mysql_connect(\"localhost\",\"username\",\"password\");\nif(!$ses){\n echo(\"<p>Connection to content server failed.</p>\");\n exit();\n}\necho(\"<p>Database Connected</p>\");\n?>\n\nWhen the page is loaded, the beginning HTML loads in addition to a paragraph reading “PHP is working” but neither the failure or success message appear.  I removed the If structure from the code - so that only two echos and the mysql_connect remained – and got the same result.  \nIt seems that the mysql_connect feature is causing the server to stop loading the code when it is run, but I’m out of ideas for how to fix it.  For the record: I’ve modified the php.ini file to include the “connection = msql.so” line, and I’m using MySQL 5.5, Apache 2.2.22, PHP 5.3.10, Ubuntu 12.04.  Also, both my router and modem have been configured to forward port 3306 to the server – though I don’t see how that should be necessary – and my MySQL username and password have been triple checked and are identical to the ones that I use successfully in Terminal.\nWhat am I missing?\n\nA: Everything looks OK so I think your installation is not complete.

I've since reversed what I did to the grub config file (edited out the nomodeset option and did 'update-grub') as I read that an update would cure my graphics glitch issues (and it seems to have). \nI had a previous install of 12.04 running on my laptop and I wanted to migrate my settings over, so I backed up my laptop's home folder using Deja Dup and restored it to my destop installation as per a suggestion I found. This worked quite well with a few adjustments that had to be made (e.g. update file system references in deluge). \nI've done a lot of searching to see if I could solve this issue myself and save having to post a question, but so far I think my limited familiarity with Ubuntu and Linux is letting me down. Please let me know if you need any additional info and I appreciate any help you can offer a noob.\n\nA: I managed to fix my issue. First, after poking around I decided to update my kernel to the mainline 3.7.0 kernel in case the issue was due to hardware incompatibility. It still didn't work out so I kept looking and found that people were having graphics driver issues when they had proprietary ati drivers installed. This hadn't occurred to me, because I didn't think these would be on my system at all (would the drivers have been migrated over when I transferred my home folder from my laptop?) but sure enough I found the fglrx driver installed. \nOnce I purged and rebooted, I'm greeted with launcher icons stacking on top of each other and the ability to finally load up Steam!\nSo the fglrx drivers were definitely giving me trouble, but I can't confirm if the integrated graphics weren't supported in 3.2.0-35-generic.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS fails to find Intel HD Graphics 3000 and video playing error hello i'm new to linux\ni'm using Toshiba c850 notebook and i can't install ' intel HD graphics 3000 ' driver on ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS (32 bit)\nthe problem is when i play HD movies , video is not smoothly playing. and every time i boot up my notebook on ubuntu i have to adjust my screen brightness.it goes maximum level every time i restart my notebook.but in windows it works fine and HD videos play smoothly.\nplease help friends.\nThanks\n\nA: Welcome to askubuntu.

We don't own the device. Google search will reveal many model with the same name. \n\n*Last, search before you post.\n\n\nBack to answers\na) Intel Grpahics card drivers are open sourced and in inbuilt in kernel.

This includes those on external drives. As long as the computer BIOS can see and boot from the external drive, it will work. Note that external drives that have to be unlocked or simulate a CD will not work.\nWhat happens if you unplug the external drive? \nNothing. You will still be asked whether to boot Windows or Ubuntu. If you boot Windows, no problem. If you try to boot Ubuntu it will complain about not finding wubildr.mbr (if you have Windows Vista/7/8) or just fail to find the install if you have Windows XP and drop you to a grub prompt. If you made this mistake, you can just reboot.\nWhat does the size of the install matter?\nFor Wubi, the size you choose is used to create a fixed virtual disk. This is the entire space available to the Ubuntu install. Yes you can access and save data on other mounted partitions, but e.g. if you try to install software or anything on the Ubuntu file system you will soon run out of room with only 5GB. The maximum you can allocate with Wubi is 30GB which is a reasonable amount to try out Ubuntu if you are planning to install a number of applications and store some data.\nIf you run out of space on the Wubi install, it is possible to resize it with a downloadable script, but it's better to pick a reasonable size upfront.\nWhy do you need Wubi with an External drive?\nYou don't need Wubi if you have an external drive. You can just install Ubuntu directly onto the external drive, making sure the Grub bootloader is installed on it (not on your internal drive). Then whenever you want Ubuntu you can plug in and boot from the External. And when it's not plugged in, Windows will boot. This sort of installation is portable to different computers (assuming you don't need custom hardware drivers) and not reliant on Windows in any way. \nNote: Make sure you install the Grub bootloader on the external or else you'll have a grub rescue prompt whenever the external is not plugged in.\n", "Q: Cedarview Video Driver Doesn't work with Intel DN2800MT Motherboard I updated my computer today with the latest kernel and video driver for the Cedarview Chipset by Intel and after I reboot I only see vertical stripes on the monitor.

I want to encrypt my ubuntu file system. I was trying with truecrypt. In windows 7 I'm not getting any drive where I installed ubuntu to encrypt using truecrypt. Also I'm using grub for OS selection. In ubuntu truecrypt is saying \"TrueCrypt can encrypt system partitions only under Windows.\" I think truecrypt needs to format ubuntu drive that's why it is saying this. Is there any way to do encryption without erasing data? If it can't be done then what can I do for encryption of my ubuntu data. Encryption is mandatory for me. Please help me to get out of these problem as I'm trying for 3 day's and nothing comes fruitful. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: The thing is, TrueCrypt currently supports the following operating systems:\n\nWindows 7  (32-bit and 64-bit)\nWindows Vista\nWindows Vista x64 (64-bit) Edition\nWindows XP\nWindows XP x64 (64-bit) Edition\nWindows Server 2008 R2 (64-bit)\nWindows Server 2008\nWindows Server 2008 x64 (64-bit)\nWindows Server 2003\nWindows Server 2003 x64 (64-bit)\nWindows 2000 SP4\nMac OS X 10.7 Lion  (64-bit and 32-bit)\nMac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard  (32-bit)\nMac OS X 10.5 Leopard\nMac OS X 10.4 Tiger\nLinux (32-bit and 64-bit versions, kernel 2.6 or compatible)\n\nBut TrueCrypt can currently encrypt the following operating systems:\n\nWindows 7  (32-bit and 64-bit)\nWindows Vista (SP1 or later)\nWindows Vista x64 (64-bit) Edition (SP1 or later)\nWindows XP \nWindows XP x64 (64-bit) Edition\nWindows Server 2008 R2 (64-bit)\nWindows Server 2008\nWindows Server 2008 x64 (64-bit)\nWindows Server 2003\nWindows Server 2003 x64 (64-bit)\n\nSo it can read a volume that was encrypted under Windows in Linux, but it cannot encrypt a volume that has a Linux File System.\nYour solution, as Web-E suggested, is to follow these instructions.\nBut beware, this will encrypt a single user; if you wish to encrypt several users, you need to repeat the how-to for each one.

Strange things about your installation, some of which could be causing problems, include:\n\n\n*\n\n*A computer that shipped with Windows 8 should boot in EFI mode and use the GUID Partition Table (GPT), but your disk is clearly using the older Master Boot Record (MBR) partitions. This suggests that you converted from GPT to MBR, which would render Windows unbootable.\n\n*Your MBR partition table clearly shows that your Windows installation uses the Windows Logical Disk Manager (LDM) configuration, aka \"dynamic disks.\" This is Microsoft's equivalent to the Linux Logical Volume Manager (LVM), but the two technologies are different in detail and therefore incompatible. If you converted from standard partitions to LDM before installing Linux, then resizing operations by the Linux partitioner could have done serious damage to the LDM setup, making Windows quite unhappy.\n\n*As a sub-point of the former, I'm not at all sure that it's advisable to mix LDM partitions with conventional partitions on a single disk.\n\n\nThe easiest solution at this point is probably to wipe the partition table and re-install everything from scratch. This may be considerably less easy if you lack Windows installation media, though, or if you've got personal data in the Windows setup that you want to rescue. If either of those is the case, you might want to post a question to a Windows forum about recovery prior to repairing the setup.\nSorry I can't offer a simple and easy solution. If there is such a solution, I don't know what it is. I can think of a number of ways to proceed short of wiping your partition table, but they're all risky. For instance, you could use a Windows tool like EaseUS Partition Manager to try to convert back from LDM to conventional partitions, then either convert from MBR to GPT (if I'm right that Windows originally booted in EFI mode) or try to get Windows booting from a non-LDM MBR setup.\nIn the future, do not use Windows partitioning tools to prepare a disk for use with Linux. (That's one common way to dig yourself into an LDM hole.)\n", "Q: Assign Group rights to folder Hello I am new with ubuntu and I have a question.\nI created a user ABC. I created a group XYZ.

When I login (even if I just unlogged from Gnome) to Gnome session, everything starts ok, but gnome-shell takes about 20% of CPU and its responses are very slow (searching for applications takes around 30 seconds and so on). It is very annoying. But, when I kill gnome-shell process, and than start it by \"nohup gnome-shell &\" from terminal, it starts again, but now without any troubles, fast, like it should.\nCan you help me how to fix this permanently? (it's really annoying to kill and run gnome-shell after every session login, and also, it takes about 15-30 seconds to start again).\nI googled this problem and found out that there might be a problem with gnome-shell extensions. But when I open tweak-tool I find that I have no gnome-shell extensions, so there is nothing I can disable.\nThanks for any help.\n\nA: A really easy way would be to open up Start-up Applications and put those commands into a new start-up application.\nFor example, in the command box you would put:\nkillall gnome-shell && nohup gnome-shell &\n\nAdd it and logout and login, or restart and test it.\n\nA: I'm observing the same behavior with gnome-shell on OpenSUSE and I suspect this is related to tracker and its need to load indexes during the startup. The second boot of gnome-shell should be fast as all data is already in caches. You may try dropping caches between each gnome-shell execution, so as to see if this is related to long IO waits during the startup.\n", "Q: What GL libraries do I need to install the Finite Element Toolkit (FETK)?

I encrypted a flashdrive using TrueCrypt, but now I've changed my mind and I want to format it as an unencrypted drive. When I plug it in it is no longer appears on the launcher or in the Nautilus sidebar (until I mount it as an encrypted drive via TrueCrypt, which appears in the Nautilus sidebar, but even then the flash drive itself is not recognised).\nHow can I access/mount it in order to format it?\n\nA: Using Disk Utility or Gparted, delete the partition and create a new one, format it to your choice of filesystem.  Disk Utility may have a problem deleting partitions it doesn't understand which may include an encrypted partition.  If Gparted also has this problem, open a terminal window and use the following command:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=512 count=1\n\nWhere /dev/sdX is the device name of the USB drive.  Make sure you have the right device because there will be nothing left on the target device after you press enter. It deletes the partition table entirely.\nYou can then re-commission the USB device by using Gparted to create a new partition table then create the primary partition and format it as before.\n\nA: One does not need to \"access\" or unencrypt the drive just to format it. By your question, I'm assuming you needed to pull some stored data off the flashdrive before reformatting it and this is why you ended your question asking for how to access the drive. With the drive still encrypted, you can reformat it. But you will lose any stored data present on the encrypted drive. To reformat the flashdrive without gaining access to it first, you should plug in the flashdrive and then open the \"Disk Utility\" program that you can find via Dash. In Disk Utility, the flashdrive's drive will appear as a \"Peripheral Device\" in the left column of Disk Utility. Locate your flashdrive and select it: all the format/partition options available will be presented in the main body of the program.\nTo pull stored data off the drive before reformatting you will need to access/mount the drive before you reformat. You can access/mount the drive by doing the following:\n1) Plug in your encrypted USB flashdrive.\n2) Start the TrueCrypt program > click on the \"Select Device\" button and in the window that opens select the drive that matches your flashdrive (match it by size, etc.) and then click OK.\n3) Click the \"Mount\" button > input your password.\nThe encrypted material should now show up as an entry in your Places column in Nautilus.\n", "Q: Has Unison error on \"File name too long\" I'm using Unison for backup/file replication.\nUnison has a problem with long file names - it does not sync files with long names  \nError:\nFailed: Error in querying file information: File name too long  \n\nOver here the developer says about plans to fix that.  \nAny information weather this has been fixed in specific version?\nI've tried 2.40.102 - not fixed.  \n\nA: This issue has been resolved as of Unison 2.45.

I was running Mandriva on it using samba to share some data areas for backups and storage (had added a SATA card and some 1TB drives).  With it's death I decided to switch to Ubuntu..\nI am running Ubuntu 12.10.  I initially installed samba since that is what I was used to, but then noticed when in Nautilus that, like in windows, I can right click and share.\nWhat is the difference between these sharing modes?  I can see my samba share but still have permissions to fix since I setup one of the old drives and it doesn't have the right group ownership yet.  But I \"right clicked shared\" another area and I can see that and use it right away from my windows boxes...\nDo I not even need to use samba any more?  Should I ditch it for this other sharing method?\nI did some searches but didn't find much, most likely I just don't know the key words yet to use in my search..  \nUnix: medium user; Ubuntu:  NEWBIE!!\n\nA: Ubuntu requires the Samba server to be able to share files using network protocol called Server Message Block (SMB) that's where the name \"Samba\" came from. Thus, any Ubuntu apps that runs on top of Ubuntu including Nautilus requires the Samba server daemon installed to serve files over the network.\nAdditional info at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Samba\nHope this helps.\nEduardo B.\n\nA: Nautilus just provides a simple front-end to creating a share with Samba. It is Samba that actually does the job. Therefore is you require a more fine-grained control over sharing use manual configuration instead. You may find the below and related docs useful: http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/Samba-Guide/index.html \nThere are also other protocols available, that allow to share files from Linux machine, like NFS (Network File System).

Or preferrably only remote videos, Nautilus used to only thumbnail local videos not remote. So if disabling for only remote is possible that would be better.\n\nA: There is also now an officially recommended way to manage which thumbnails are generated in Thunar by tumbler, the Xfce thumbnailing service. Using the method described below means nothing will need to be uninstalled from the gstreamer set of packages, and all other thumbnails (apart from video) will be generated.\nHowever, it is important to note that this is only possible if you have tumbler 0.1.27, although this will be at least the version in Raring (13.04). If you are on Xubuntu 12.10, you only need to enable the Xfce 4.12 ppa to get the latest version of tumbler.  \nOn the Xfce announce mailing lists for January 2013, it was noted that, regarding tumbler 0.1.27,  \n\nThis release ships a config file installed in the xdg directory to\n  control the various plugins (especially the priority). There is also a\n  cover download plugin (dependency is libcurl), but this has been\n  disabled by default. \n\nHow to enable and disable various plugins is explained on the Xfce official page, but briefly here's how it works. As noted in the explanation, if you want to customise the tumbler rc file, you can make a tumbler folder in your  user-specific configuration folder and then copy tumbler.rc from /etc/xdg/tumbler to that folder:\ncd ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}\nmkdir -p tumbler\ncd tumbler\ncp /etc/xdg/tumbler/tumbler.rc .\n\nNow, edit the file with your preferred text editor, e.g.\ngedit tumbler.rc\n\nand you will see something like this sample rc file, which has sections for video, image and other thumbnailer plugins.\nAs an example, you could find the section Video Thumbnailers in the file above and set Disabled=true in the sections for the ffmpegthumbnailer and the gstreamer plugins. Using this method you do not have to remove gstreamer0.10-plugins to stop video thumbnails being shown. \nExcerpt from the Video Thumbnailers section of tumbler.rc:\n# ffmpegthumbnailer plugin\n[FfmegThumbnailer]\nDisabled=true\nPriority=2\nLocations=\nMaxFileSize=0\n\n# GStreamer plugin\n[GstThumbnailer]\nDisabled=true\nPriority=1\nLocations=\nMaxFileSize=0\n\nIf at some later point you find that you do not want to entirely disable the video plugins, you could instead use Disabled=false to re-enable them and set a value for the MaxFileSize, so that only files up to a certain size were shown. This would solve problems with high memory usage when thumbnails for very large files are being generated. \n\n\n*\n\n*Note: after making any changes to tumbler.rc , it is crucial that you log out and log in again. Video thumbnailing for those two plugins, for example, would not be disabled until you logged in again.\n\n*Remember, this will only work if you have tumbler 0.1.27 or a later version installed.\n\nA: open your synaptic package manager and remove gstreamer0.10-plugins and ffmpegthumbnailer packages . I am not sure which packages installation causes this problem to you but Thumbnail generation will done due to because of this two packages only . \nso remove the one which is installed in your system and synaptic is the easy way .\nhope that helps .\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 graphics or booting issue Merry Christmas everyone.\nYesterday I upgraded Ubuntu from 12.04 to 12.10. I have an Intel integrated graphic card. I know it's not compatible with the new version. Ubuntu warned me about it, but I upgraded Ubuntu anyway.\nMy main idea is to disable Unity 3D after the upgrade, or use Cinnamon, but now I'm facing problems... I see the boot loader, I click Ubuntu and then all I see is a purple screen, just that. I don't see the loading screen or the login screen, just a purple screen. What to do? Can I fix it without removing 12.10 and reinstalling 12.04? \n\nA: I found a similar problem with install in Oracle VirtualBox after configuring boot and swap partition as well. I also installed metacity, kernal headers (Ubuntu 12.10), manually downloaded VB additions, etc. Then I found to kill process with gnome-session provided a GUI login screen. Then I select Classic Gnome. To get the panel again I also had to kill process with gnome-panel - also from Ctrl-Alt-Fx (x from 1 to 6) as root. Maybe this helps somebody a bit further along.

Generally speaking, the battery extender can be suitable for most models, like iPhone extended battery also fits for other phones. That's why smartphone app developers tout battery-conservation apps. These programs purport to save battery life by clamping down on unnecessary tasks, ensuring that your phone is running only the apps you really need at any given moment.\n", "Q: Series of task to be done after a single stroke in Easystroke gesture recognition I use easystroke for many tasks like command, key combination, etc.\nNow, I need to perform a series of tasks in a single stroke.\nFor example:\nFirst i need to execute the command 'cryptkeeper'.\nSecond, I need to execute 'gnome-terminal'.\nThird, I need to press key combination \"ctrl+c\".\nFourth, i need to press 'up-arrow'.

In all cases I have seen the tutorial asks you to \nmodprobe efivars\n\nHow can this be done when the kernel module efivars.ko does not exist in any Ubuntu kernel that I can find. If you doubt me do these two things, firstly run the command \nsudo modprobe -l | grep efivars\n\nYou will get no results. Next go to packages.ubuntu.com and enter the search term efivars.ko in 'search the contents of packages'. Again you will get no results. \nDebian have kernels with this module in it and so to Arch. Ubuntu however do not. Or if they do they conceal them remarkably effectively. \nAm I missing something - it is not unknown!\n\nA: A cursory examination of an Ubuntu 12.10 installation I've got suggests that the efivars kernel module is now built into the kernel rather than installed as a module. Most notably, here's an entry from /usr/src/linux-headers-3.5.0-19-generic/.config:\nCONFIG_EFI_VARS=y\n\nThis indicates that the support is built into the kernel. The effect of this module is to create the /sys/firmware/efi directory, and it's present on the system in question.\nWhen a module is built into the kernel, you don't need to load it, so you can ignore any instruction to do so, so long as you're sure the module is built into the kernel. In the case of efivars, just check for the presence of /sys/firmware/efi.\n", "Q: Ubuntu desktop 12.10 64-bit, icons don't show Recently I had problems with fglrx cause I have an ATI card, if I install the privative drivers from the Ubuntu repo, I get no Unity launch bar cause the drivers are not compatible with the new Xorg.\nSo, I installed manually the new beta drivers following the reponse of ryanpcmcquen in this question:\nCan't install ATI proprietary drivers in 12.10\nBecause I have also a 5670 card.\nEverything work, I get now from info:\njdsampayo@jdsampayo-M61PME-S2:~$ fglrxinfo\ndisplay: :0  screen: 0\nOpenGL vendor string: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\nOpenGL renderer string: ATI Radeon HD 5670\nOpenGL version string: 4.2.11995 Compatibility Profile Context\n\nThe problem is that when Unity starts I don't get any icons in desktop and right mouse clicks there also do nothing, but I get the Unity bar working.\nIf I launch ccsm and I disable the Unity plugin (bar dissapears) and reenable it, the bar reappears and icons in desktop and right click mouse in desktop works as expected.\nIs there any way to do this automatically?

It is not mounted at all. And even Ubuntu detects only the installed partition of the D: drive, which means the rest 550G was invisible somehow. \nI have installed pysdm to fix mounting the drives, but it does not do any good since it doesn't show the rest of the drive at all.  \nWhere can I find the rest of the drive visible in both Windows 8 and Ubuntu?\n\nA: I'm not sure if it is the case for multiple HDDs, but if you partition one HDD, windows is only capable of recognizing each adjacent partition up until it finds one it doesn't recognize, and none after. Since Windows does not recognize Linux partitions, if it comes directly after windows and you have another recognizable partition, say a different version of windows, after it, it will not recognize either of them. This is possibly your problem. If you have Ubuntu at the start of your second HDD, Windows will likely stop looking as soon as Ubuntu is detected.\nI can't guarantee results, but if you put the Ubuntu partition at the very end of the second HDD, you will hopefully be able to read the rest of it. Make sure that you make Ubuntu big enough for Ubuntu data to build up, as it is much more time consuming to add space to the start of a partition than it is to add to the end. That being said, Ubuntu is capable of reading and writing to any partition without ill-effect (except the occasional trash can folder and obviously files incompatible formats; no different than if you were to use a flash drive between the two), as long as you gain r/w permission for them. This means that you will only really need room for system files, you could very-well keep all of your personal files on your windows partition if you wanted to. (When I still used windows I gave it 100 GBs, followed by a large ntfs partition for shared data and the last 50 GBs to Ubuntu, and put all personal files on the shared partition so that they were accessible to both OSes).\nAlso make sure that the extra partition is in a format that windows is compatible with. I used to use ntfs because I also had Snow Leapard for a while and it is compatable with all 3 OSes, FAT would also work with all 3 (this is what flash drives use by default). \n\nA: Check with partition editor or disk utility whether the 550GB is formatted as a partition or is unallocated. If it's unallocated, you'll need to create a partition in there and format it as NTFS for it to be visible to windows.\n", "Q: Flashplugin-installer errors I have installed flashplugin-installer through Synaptic and before have tried sudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer in LXTerminal, and whenever I load Google Chrome/Chromium and navigate to a site with ANYTHING flash I get an error message saying \"Could not load Shockwave Flash.\" Any help?

I read that OpenSuse ported Ubuntu's Unity desktop and made a repository, also available in Fedora and Arch. I was wondering if, besides Ubuntu, any other distro (or spin) is using Unity as default.\n\nA: Well you just answered yourself. Yes OpenSuse, Fedora and Arch have a repo for Unity. In the Ubuntu ecosystem, all direct Ubuntu based distros (Lubuntu, Xubuntu, Kubuntu...) have Unity in the package manager, so you can install it if you want to change from the default this distros carry.\nOutside of the Ubuntu world (In other distros not based on Ubuntu directly) we can see the following:\nArch Linux offers Unity and Unity 2D for low end systems.\nFedora and OpenSuse do offer Unity, but this need to be installed from a repository.\nOther distros like Frugalware and Leeenux have or had Unity in some version or another and at some point in their development.\nThe small amount of distros offering Unity as an alternative is because:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unity is/was still under heavy development so the decision was on hold.\n\n*Unity uses Compiz which some distros do not want\n\n*Unity has compatibility problems with Gnome libraries\n\n*Unity is a radical change.\nOf course, there are many benefits of using Unity, and most of this points in later versions were fixed, but depending on the distro (Is it orientes towards and old linux user, is it for low end systems...) they would use or not use Unity.\nI myself, can't really go back to another since Unity really covers everything I do in a strange way that after using it for a week had/needed to stay with it.\n\nLinked Questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do any Ubuntu-based distributions ship with Unity?\n\n*https://askubuntu.com/questions/71345/have-any-other-distributions-packaged-unity\n", "Q: Installed xorg on server, no screens found All:\nFollowed this link:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/ServerGUI\nPerforming startx says no screens found... ???\n\nA: From the OP, the solution:\n\nOK, so someone should add this to the ServerGUI page: I had to do: sudo Xorg -configure and sudo cp /root/xorg.conf.new /etc/X11/xorg.conf This should really be spelled out in that servergui page, as mentioned above.

I'm trying to use Ubuntu 12.04 to transfer data from an unbootable hard-drive in Windows XP  to a usb. Does the partition need to be mounted beforehand? Also, I read I could use ddrescue to perform the transfer but it doesn't seem operational on ubuntu 12.04.  Any suggestions\n\nA: You have two issues here, so I suggest you open a new question about ddrescue.\nTo perform any disk operation you need to mount the disk beforehand, because Ubuntu needs to know that the disk is in the computer to handle it. Being the disk with Windows XP unbootable does not mean you can not mount it, so if the disc is not already on your computer, do so.\nAfter restarting your Ubuntu, it should recognize the new hard drive and mount it for you. If this is true, then simply just browse it with Nautilus and copy to USB you need.\nIf not, you need to manually mount the disk.

I have both Greatest Hits by the Offspring and Greatest Hits by Queen in my Rhythmbox library.  When I sort by album, it looks like this:\n\nHow can I tell get rhythmbox to sort by album in such a way that it doesn't interleave albums by different artists with the same name?\n\nA: Out of the box, rhythmbox does not have the ability to differentiate between different \"greatest hits\" albums because it treats album titles as the unique identifier.\nThrough the rhythmbox plugin coverart-browser, we treat both the album-title AND the album-artist as the unique identifier.\n\nAs the picture shows - two artists with the same \"greatest hits\" titles but the albums are shown separately since the two albums are by different artists.\nYou should note - when ripping CD's, often the album-artist is not ripped and is left blank.\nWorse still, for multi-artist albums (compilations), both the album-artist and artist fields are also left empty.  Thus you can be left with two albums with exactly the same title.\nThe trick here is to select all the tracks for an album, right-click and choose properties and then fill in the album-artist field to make it unique\n\nSee the links below for installation instructions.\nLinked Question:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to browse by album art in rhythmbox?\n\n*How do I install third-party rhythmbox plugins?\n\nA: I have seen this problem on a variety of systems and with different players and the only solution I have come up with is to name the albums prefixed by the artist.\nFor example:\n\"Red Hot Chilli Peppers Greatest Hits \" instead of just \"Greatest Hits\".\nI know its a lot of work but if someone has a better way I would love to hear it.\n\nA: You cannot do this in Rhythmbox. However, I would consider it a bug that this happens. You should open a bug about it upstream, if one is not already opened. What it should do, is sort by album, then album artist, then artist, then disc number, then by track number, when you sort by album. However, it is not currently doing this.\n\nA: Select all the tracks from the album, right click, choose properties. Don't change the artist or album tag. Set \"album artist\" if you like, or click on the \"sorting\" tab. Here, you can set an artist and album tag that will not be displayed, but will be used specifically for sorting. If you set \"Album sort order\" to \"greatest hits 1\" for example, and set it to \"greatest hits 2\" for the other album, they would still both show up as \"Greatest Hits\" in the library, but would be sorted as separate albums. Better solution would be to change the \"artist sort order\" field to the corresponding artist's name. This is also a good solution for albums with multiple artists.\nYou can also use this if you like your albums sorted chronologically, as Rhythmbox doesn't have the \"album by year\" feature that I've only ever seen in iTunes.\nSorting your library using the \"Artist\" heading rather than \"Album\" would solve this problem much more easily; your albums will still be sorted alphabetically, with their tracks in order, and albums by the same artist will be grouped together. That way Offspring and Queen wouldn't even be near each other, let alone all mixed up like that.\nI know this question is pretty old, but no one seems to have posted this solution.

Sometimes (but not all the time with certain packages) it will need to remove these packages in order for the upgrade to proceed.\nIn certain cases like Cinnamon (which I can see is in 13.10) an inplace upgrade is possible, but that really depends on the differences between the packages in the PPA and the ones in the distribution.\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*What are PPAs and how do I use them?\n\n*Are PPA's safe to add to my system and what are some \"red flags\" to watch out for?\n", "Q: Going to a virtual terminal disables Vim color scheme When I'm going into a virtual terminal my Vim color scheme is ignored.\nI've configured it by following this blog.\nHeres all of my ~/.vimrc\nif $COLORTERM == 'gnome-terminal'\n    set term=gnome-256color\n    set t_Co=256\n    colorscheme railscasts\nelse\n    colorscheme default\nendif\n\n\n\"FileType support\nset filetype=on\nfiletype plugin on\nfiletype indent on\n\n\"Color scheme and font\nautocmd FileType javascript,html,css,php colorscheme railscasts\nautocmd FileType javascript,html,css,php set gfn=Monaco\\ 10\n\n\"Indentation\nautocmd FileType javascript,html,css,php set ai\nautocmd FileType javascript,html,css,php set sw=4\nautocmd FileType javascript,html,css,php set ts=4\nautocmd FileType javascript,html,css,php set sts=4\nautocmd FileType javascript,css,php set textwidth=79\n\n\"Enable autocompletion\nautocmd FileType javascript set omnifunc=javascriptcomplete#CompleteJS\nautocmd FileType html set omnifunc=htmlcomplete#CompleteTags\nautocmd FileType css set omnifunc=csscomplete#CompleteCSS\n\n\"Enable line numbers\nautocmd FileType javascript,css,php set number\n\n\"Enable incremental search\nautocmd FileType javascript,html,css,php set incsearch\n\nThis part should have been fixed it right?\nif $COLORTERM == 'gnome-terminal'\n    set term=gnome-256color\n    set t_Co=256\n    colorscheme railscasts\nelse\n    colorscheme default\nendif\n\n\nA: It can be done but it quite complicated (so I recommend using a regular terminal if you really want the colors) but if you really want to do it have a look at the following question on superuser: https://superuser.com/questions/67582/tty-with-256-colors\nThey instruct to set the appropriate TERM variable, this TERM variable then also needs to be added to your vimrc, becaues now the colors are only set for TERM=gnome-terminal.\n", "Q: Lubuntu 12.04: unresponsive windows with certain applications OS: Lubuntu 12.04 64-bit (Ubuntu 12.04 with LXDE)\nSystem: HP DV7-1040ED notebook with Nvidia GPU: NVIDIA Corporation G96 [GeForce 9600M GT] (rev a1)\nWhen working with certain applications windows become unresponsive or take ages to load and when I move my mouse outside of the window the application immediately becomes responsive again.

If I just let Thunderbird continue it will eventually become responsive again. If I click on a folder and immediately move my mouse pointer outside the Thunderbird application window Thunderbird immediately loads the folder and remains responsive.\n\n*Qtractor: if I load a project with a lot of plug-ins it takes up to 40 seconds for Qtractor to load the project and become responsive.

When you ask for 'cd Home' the terminal looks for /home/sharon/Home. There is none.\nsharon@sharon:~$ cd /Home \nbash: cd: /Home: No such file or directory \n\nNow you are asking, given the leading slash, to go to a directory above the current location; that is /home/Home. There is none.\nsharon@sharon:~$ cd Documents \nsharon@sharon:~/Documents$\n\nSuccess!\nsharon@sharon:~/Documents$ cd /Downloads \nbash: cd: /Downloads: No such file or directory \n\nI'm not too sure where exactly this is. If you want to change from /home/sharon/Documents to /home/sharon/Downloads, please try:\ncd ~/Downloads\n\nIf you want to go directly to your home directory, that is /home/sharon, simply do:\ncd\n\nAlso you can go Step back with \ncd ..\n\nAnd you can print the directory you are working in with (print working directory) \npwd\n\n\nA: The filesystem is GNU/Linux is like a tree, except that the root is on top. :-) So you have structure like:\n/\n  bin/\n  home/\n    sharon/\n      Documents/\n      Downloads/\n      fileA.txt\n      fileB.jpg\n  usr/\n  var/\n\nIf you want to move inside the tree, one option is to use relative paths. If you are in /home/sharon, then typing cd Downloads will work, because Downloads is an immediate child of your current directory. If you are in the subfolder Documents and want to change directory (cd) to Downloads, you have to go up (..) and then to Downloads. So the correct command would be cd ../Downloads.\nYou could also enter an absolute path. So the Downloads folder is a subfolder of sharon which is a subfolder of home which is … (you get the idea :-))\nSo you can also enter cd /home/sharon/Downloads wherever you are in the filesystem.\n\n\n*\n\n*~ always refers to the home directory of the current user (/home/sharon in your case). If you enter cd ~/Downloads you'll land in your Downloads folder. \n\n*. refers to the current directory, so cd ./Downloads is roughly equivalent to cd Downloads.\n\n*.. means \"parent directory\". \n\n*/ at the beginning of file path refers to the root directory.\nThe next nice thing is tab expansion. If you enter cd ~/DowTab (last is pressing Tabulator key), the bash automatically expands it to cd ~/Downloads.\nAs the others said GNU/Linux is case sensitive. So it makes a difference if you enter Home, hOme or home. Furthermore I hope that you see now that there is a difference between /home and home. The first is adressed absolute while the last is relative to your current directory.\n\nA: The command tells you why: There is no such directory.\nFilenames are case sensetive, so it is /home, not /Home.  Without a leading slash, it is assumed to be relative to the current directory, and the Downloads directory is not in ~/Documents, nor is it in /, but in your home directory, to which ~ is a shortcut, thus it is ~/Documents.\n\nA: I have to answer over this, because i can't comment on answers -.-\n\nWhat does the leading slash mean? – n00b\n\nit means that the thin you are talking about is a directory not a file. Files don't have to have file endings like in Windows, so ~/thisIsAFile would be a file in your home-directory but ~/thisIsAFile/ would be a directory/ a folder.\n\nWhat does ./ mean? – n00b\n\nThat means that the file you want to access is in your current directory. \nOther usefull tips:\nYou can go a folder back with \ncd ..\n\nAnd you can get the path you are in with (print working directory)\npwd\n\n", "Q: How do I gain access to these programs? sharon@sharon:~$ cd /opt/Symantec/symantec_antivirus\n\nsharon@sharon:/opt/Symantec/symantec_antivirus$ ./rtvscand -k shutdown\n\nno permission to access rtvscand\n\nsharon@sharon:/opt/Symantec/symantec_antivirus$ ./symcfgd -k shutdown\n\nno permission to access symcfgd\n\nsharon@sharon:/opt/Symantec/symantec_antivirus$ \n\nCould someone provide detailed instructions as to how to gain access to the 2 programs?\nI am new to Linux and Ubuntu and running version 12.10, 64bit, US English.\n\nA: Did you tried running your command with sudo ?

Im trying to setup dual booting. The laptop came with Windows 8 pre installed and UEFI and quick Boot enabled. In the Ubuntu UEFI documentation it tells us to create a EFI partition in the beginning of the disk. But if we do this, the Windows 8 won't boot right?\n\nA: The EFI System Partition (ESP) is intended to be shared across OSes, so you should be able to use the one that already exists. It's also legal to create multiple ESPs on a single disk, but this can be confusing, so I recommend against it. AFAIK, Windows will boot with multiple ESPs, but Windows 7's installer becomes confused by such configurations. I don't know if the Windows 8 installer (or repair utilities) become confused in a similar way. If they do, creating a second ESP is inadvisable for this reason alone.\n\nA: During the Ubuntu installation,  when setting the mount points for the partitions under the Something Else option;  in the pull down for the mount point for the /Boot partition,  select EFI from the available options.\nOn my W8 installation,  Windows 8 certainly still boots with this configuration:\nFor your reference,  this is how I achieved dual boot with vendor (HP)  installed Windows 8 / Ubuntu 12.10 on the machine that’s in the linked data sheet,  with manufacturing date 08/12:\nhttp://www.shopping.hp.com/shopping/pdf/c2h70ua.pdf\nThe chipset=HM77.

I have a hard drive in my laptop with a windows and an ubuntu partition.  I got an SSD to replace my hard drive, but it has a slightly lower capacity. I've already partitioned the SSD to the sizes I want, and each partition on the new disk is larger than the amount of used space on my old hard drive.\nI was going to use dd, but it appears that it requires partitions to be the same size.\nHow can I copy my old partitions onto my new ssd? I'm copying my boot partition too, so how can I make sure the new disk is bootable, and the new partitions are exactly the same as the old ones (but with less free space)?\n\nA: Don't bother to partition SSD disk.\nI would suggest to shrink the partitions on the old disk first to fit the size of the SSD, then dd old disk to new one\nBut make a backup first.\n\nA: You can definitely use dd, as long as the data on the larger drive is notably smaller than the SSD and that no data exists in the area that is beyond the SSD's storage limits.\nJust do a straight up dd sector by sector from the source drive to the SSD until the SSD is \"full\" and then use parted to fix up the incorrect partition table that says the SSD has larger geometry than it really does by \"deleting\" and \"recreating\" the truncated partition with the correct geometry (this doesn't delete data in that partition, it simply changes the start and end of that partition).\nAlternatively, as already mentioned, use a tool like GParted to shrink down the partition to less than the size of the SSD, clone it over using either dd (it will have correct geometry and no risk of data loss this time) or Clonezilla (faster than dd because it only clones the occupied areas of the drive rather than everything - you still need to resize the partition down beforehand), and then resize the partition on the SSD up again afterwards to fill any empty space below the total capacity.\n\nA: Disclaimer: I am the author of the WereSync software\nWereSync can do this with one command. Install the program with:\npip install weresync\n\nAnd then run it:\nweresync -C --grub-partition 2 --efi-partition 1 /dev/sda /dev/sdb\n\nThis will copy the data from /dev/sda to /dev/sdb. The -C flag makes weresync copy the partitions to the target drive, then resize them so they fit. --grub-partition is the number of the partition you want weresync to install grub on, and --efi-partition is the partition number you want to be mounted and passed to grub-installs --efi-directory flag. Generally --grub-partition should be your root drive, so if /dev/sda2 is mounted on /, pass a 2 to --grub-partition. If you have your boot folder on a seperate partition, you will need to pass that number to the --boot-partition flag. For more detailed information, see the WereSync Documentation.\nNote: As of yet, WereSync only supports GPT drives as the source drive. Support for MBR drives is being actively developed.\n\nA: Use lsblk to get your device ID and do (running it without arguments)\nlsblk -b /dev/sdYY\n\nThis is to get the exact size of the disks and make dd from there.\nBefore dd you might need to use Gparted to resize it to fit. Go to the device picker on the top right of Gparted, right click on the partition to be resized and hit the Apply button (and make a Home run) but watch for your finger. And you'll be ready to \"dd\" the disk.\n", "Q: grub boot order problems after update My grub menu went through rather extensive changes after the last update.

When I attempt to boot in Windows 8, a quick _ gets displayed, and then I get moved back to the boot screen where I can select what I wish to boot from.\nHere is my fdisk -l output:\nDisk /dev/sda: 256.1 GB, 256060514304 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 31130 cylinders, total 500118192 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0xdec26e36\n\nDevice Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1            2048      144584       71268+  de  Dell Utility\n/dev/sda2          145408    18057059     8955826    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda3   *    18057216   437300047   209621416    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda4       437301246   500117503    31408129    5  Extended\n/dev/sda5       437301248   492031999    27365376   83  Linux\n/dev/sda6       492034048   500117503     4041728   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\nI do have several extra partitions on the hard-drive for work related reasons as well, so treat any extra non-linux related partitions as such.  As you can see, my Windows partition is still in-tact, as well as sda1 - sda6.\nI can also view my Windows partition using this Ubuntu version.\nDoes anyone have any idea why I am unable to boot into Windows 8?\nAny help would be appreciated, as I need to do work on both Windows 8 and Linux.\n\nA: Have you resized the Windows partition, especially the Windows boot partition during the Ubuntu installation? If so, that might be the cause of the problem. I had this problem with Windows 7 on an OEM system after installing Ubuntu if I deleted Windows's boot partition.\nBooting from the Windows installation medium (DVD or USB flash drive with your Windows ISO image written to it) and using its recovery tools to perform automatic repair may help.\n\nA: If you have the win8 Cd I would try inserting the disc into drive and trying to repair the OS that way, seems to me like you overwrote the win8 system32 data\n", "Q: Unmet dependencies.

However these chips works fine with the open\nb43 driver, but you first need to install their firmware -- easily done with\na package install. First, remove the proprietary STA driver if installed, (which\nis the same as driver wl), and its configuration files which suppress\nthe working b43 driver) by reversing whatever you did to install them:  \n   sudo apt-get purge bcmwl-kernel-source \n\nand/or run additional-drivers and unselect the Broadcom STA driver\nCheck that your removal/deactivation above is complete:\nall the lines with  \"blacklist b43\" should have been removed from all\nfiles in /etc/modprobe.d. These blacklist lines suppress  the b43 driver,\nso they must be removed -- just the exact \"b43\" and \"b43legacy\" lines,\nleave the \"bcm43xx\" lines alone.  Deal with any leftovers:  \n\nsudo rm /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-bcm43.conf  \n\n gksudo gedit  any-file-found-with-b43\n\nand delete or put a # at the beginning.\nThe proprietary firmware cannot be distributed with the release,so you\nhave to manually add it. Use a wired connection, and in a terminal:\n   sudo apt-get install linux-firmware-nonfree\n\nAnother source of the Broadcom firmware is the package firmware-b43-installer\n   sudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer  \n\nbut only one set of firmware is needed (and non-4311 users should\ncheck for needing other versions of the firmware (like\nfirmware-b43-lpphy-installer).  \nWith the firmware in place, NetworkManager may start scanning,\nif not, manually load the b43 driver module, or just reboot.\n sudo modprobe b43  \n\nAt this point, you should have the b43 driver module loaded, and\nthe wl and another possible driver, brcma module NOT present in the\nmodule list produced by:\n sudo lsmod | sort\n\nIf the brcma module is listed, blacklist it by adding the following:\n  blacklist brcma\n  blacklist brcmsmac\n  blacklist brcm80211\nto file /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n  gksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nNetworkManager should start scanning and offer a list of possible\nconnection points within a few seconds.\nSelect your access point, select the correct encryption method, and enter\nyour key. If you are not broadcasting your ssid and it does not show up  in\nthe list of access points, you might have to left click NetworkManager and\nselect the menu item \"connect to hidden network\", and enter your ssid. Next\nboot, the connection should be automatic. \n", "Q: Does not boot ubuntu? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I repair grub?

This may indicate that a previous upgrade has not taken this into account or that you've altered the sources.list file yourself and didn't change it when upgrading.\nFrom the comments I can determine that it's just one line that is not configured for precise, the 'official' Ubuntu extras repository. Now the best thing to do is to fix this line to use precise instead.

Any applications that cause memory problems (eg \"memory leaks\") would be considered buggy. Unused RAM is utilised by the system for read-ahead cache and other optimisations.  These optimisations are removed from memory if it required by the system, so there's no need to clean it either manually or by some kind of watchdog daemon.\nIf you run out of normal memory, then the system will start to use the swap partition, so it's important to at least have one set up.  This will cause performance to degrade but will prevent the system from crashing if you do run out of normal memory.\nIf you are consistently using a large amount of swap in normal operations it would be a good indication that your system is underspec'd for the kinds of things that you are trying to do.  If you hardly every use any swap, or only use a tiny amount after extended run times then you don't have an issue.

Be aware, though, that the \"boot repair\" utility others have been recommending renames the Windows boot loader file in a standards-violating way, which means that rEFInd won't be able to locate the Windows boot loader. If you haven't run the boot repair tool, this shouldn't be an issue; but if you have, you'll have to rename what is, in Linux, /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi.bkp to /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi, overwriting the file that currently uses the second name (it's a duplicate of GRUB).

You can record unlimited number of channels, route them through effects and process them however you wish.\n\n*Editing, combining, processing tracks - That's what Ardour was designed to, and it does it has wide possibilities in this matter. It provides both simple tricks like mixing, moving, transposing tracks, as well as advanced signal processing tools.

Background\nFirst of all, this is not a question about opinions. I am assuming that we are talking about Unity 3D and on a computer with decent graphics configuration. By \"desktop environment\", I am assuming the most generally accepted definition of what a DE means.\nI have seen lot of comparisons made and many people saying that Unity is the slowest desktop environment on Ubuntu (compared to others like Gnome, XFCE, LXDE etc.). I don't know whether people took KDE into consideration or not.\nQuestion\n\n\n*\n\n*Why is Unity slow compared to other desktop environments? Is it just because of the high graphics used in Unity or something else? (I don't know what in unity makes it run slow.).\n\n*What changes can be/ are being made to Unity in order to make it\nfaster/ improve its perfomance?\n\n\nA: The answer depends heavily on 3 major factors contributing to the feeling of \"slow\" or better yet, less FPS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Version of Ubuntu (Updated, not just left as it came when it was released)\n\n*Video card (Ati, Intel, Nvidia)\n\n*Driver version (Proprietary, Open Source, Actual Version)\n\n\nI'll explain each point:\nVersion of Ubuntu\nFor the version of Ubuntu, it is known that using 11.10 with Unity will suck. Literally make the PC suck at even opening Gedit or Nautilus in most cases. Trying to play a game in either OpenGL or through Wine with DirectX or OpenGL will result on less FPS than normal, even compared to any other DE. This drastically changes in 12.04 and then again in 12.10 where the FPS count starts to go up. \nSince the latest is the 12.10, I should mention that for some, using 12.10 without upgrades does not address several key problems that were fixed in Compiz and Unity around a month after release. So any 12.10 user has to upgrade to receive this benefits. This is because the 2 most important parts that are talked about when FPS and OpenGL performance comes to mind are Unity and Compiz (Compiz being the most important one when it comes to a performance impact).\nThe benefits and enhancements that both, the Compiz project is getting throughout the 0.9.8 Series and the 0.9.9 Series and Unity is getting in the 7.x Series are actually very impressive.\nTests in Phoronix and some of my own showed that for Nvidia cards (The only tests I could actually do were with Nvidia cards) the performance has gone up. And not just 3 or 4 FPS but about 20 to 70 FPS depending on the Video card and Driver.\nThis is important, since, depending on the Ubuntu version the user is using, it will also depend on the Compiz and Unity version available for it, and the performance cost that comes with it.\nSince Unity needs Compiz, this will be the biggest cause of low FPS count, but not much as before, or at least 2 versions ago. Running the Benchmark utility of Compiz while playing video games in Wine or Open Source ones gave me very good FPS in 12.10 and even more while I am testing 13.04 with the latest 313.xx series of Nvidia.\nIt should be noted that video performance is one of the points that will be dealt in 13.04 (And to some big degree in 12.10 and 12.04) because of a commitment that Ubuntu has for it's users and Steam (Valve). Not only is Ubuntu and Valve working on this, but Nvidia and Intel have joined also with many updates that have jumped the FPS count time and time again. If you are following the improvements that are coming to the 3.7 and 3.8 Kernel you will see some of them.\nVideo Card & Driver Version\nIt has been known that performance wise, Nvidia is on top of it, followed by Intel and Ati (This is not to be confused with ease of use, since Intel is much better at that). The latest drivers for Nvidia (For example the 306.64, 310.19 and 313.09) have all brought OpenGL performance improvements specifically for Unity. Specially the 313.09 which is used to improve Compiz even further. \nNow, not only is Nvidia doing a lot of work to improve the road for Compiz/Unity. Intel is also hard working (Very hard) on several key features for Mesa, which should improve performance in general for all Intel video cards, specially the 965, 2000 HD, 3000 HD and 4000 HD Series. Lastly Ati/AMD has also several updates already made that will fix many bugs and issues with Compiz. \nSo in general, having the latest driver for each will improve performance but having an Nvidia card will enhance it more, followed by Intel and Ati.\nAfter reading all of this, what changes are being made to improve the performance in general, well here are some:\n\n\n*\n\n*Nvidia is working since several versions ago on improving Unity performance with more than a 50% enhancement in general over older versions\n\n*Intel is working with Mesa to improve Unity performance\n\n*Ubuntu and Valve are working on improving performance for Compiz and Unity\n\n*As seen in Launchpad, there are several fixed made to Compiz to improve responsiveness and better performance in general (Including memory and cpu usage)\n\n*As seen in Launchpad, Unity has received many fixes in regards to most problems encountered by end users\n\n*Compiz has lowered by more than 50% the amount of memory it used a year ago.\n\n*Unity feels faster and lighter compared to the version used a year ago.\n\n*There is some work done by Sams Spilsbury for the latest Compiz and Unity that will address some common problems known with Unity.\n\n*Kernel versions 3.7 and 3.8 will bring video improvements in general\nSo as you can see, there is much work that is being done to improve Unity and Compiz. To be fair, comparing Unity to Xfce or Lxde is not fair. This is like comparing a bike to a car. Both can do some things better. Compiz offers for example some very neat effects that Xfce or Lxde do not and even though most of us do not use them, they are an option (Like the cigar lighter inside the car). \nSame goes for comparing KDE, Gnome3 and any other DE to low end DE. They are low end for a reason. They tend to avoid making huge changes that will impact performance, while high end DE will try to add features that might take more resources at the beginning. For example, having widgets, the ability to rotate a window to any degree possible, having a blur effect that hides the background or having an animated background at that. There are options that some uses enjoy that are offered by some Desktops that others DE do not need or use since they are more oriented towards a low end system.\nWith this in mind, anybody that has tested KDE since the 4.0 release knows what huge improvements it has received up till the latest 4.9 version. Huge ones indeed. Anybody that has tested Gnome 3.0 up to the latest 3.8 release knows of the huge changes in performance it has received and anybody that has tested Unity from the 3.x up to the 6.x (And soon 7.x) will know how the performance has jumped. I for one miss gnome2 for example, but there are several cases where I can't use gnome2 for since Unity is much friendlier and quicker in helping me achieve some of this cases.\nSo what tips I could give to improve performance?\nWell install the Compiz Config Settings Manager (ccsm)\nand play with the OpenGL plugin:\n\nSome of this options will enhance performance, others I needed to avoid video problems. If anybody finds the question about this I will be happy if they edit this answer to include a link to it here. I can't find it right now but I know there was an answer that talked about this.\nOther is updating the drivers and if possible, using Nvidia. Other than that, waiting for 13.04 will be a worthwhile.\nFor some reviews, here are benchmarks from Phoronix that check how Unity is performing on 11.04, 12.04, 13.04 and 13.10:   \nDesktop Benchmark 11.04\nDesktop Benchmark 12.04\nDesktop Benchmark 13.04\nDesktop Benchmark 13.10\nAnd this is what has happened with Nvidia over the past months\nAlso some articles about Ati/AMD HERE, HERE, HERE and HERE\nLast, Intel, Mesa and Opengl HERE, HERE and HERE\n", "Q: Nvidia driver installation error Here I join the multitude of \"Nvidia error\" questions, because I couldn't find anything that helped.\nBackground: For some reason my drivers (nvidia-experimental-310) stopped working, so I tried re-installing them.

Then I ran apt-get autoremove to remove any leftovers, apt-get update, and the apt-get install nvidia-current-updates, which still didn't work. Looking at the log from terminal, it seems that I don't have the source of the kernel or something.\n\nA: Alright, so here's what was causing the real problem in the end.\nFirst of all, as mikewhatever said, 3.7 is a non-standard/unstable kernel, and as such doesn't really need to be used.  In light of this, I:\n\n\n*\n\n*Removed the Xorg-edgers PPA\n\n*Removed the 3.7 kernels and all the guff that went along with them\n\n*sudo apt-get update\n\n*sudo apt-get upgrade\nBut that was still causing problems, although a slightly different one. As you can see near the bottom of the terminal log, it says \n\nModule build for the currently running kernel was skipped since the\n  kernel source for this kernel does not seem to be installed.\n\nSo I opened synaptic to see what was installed for the kernels, doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Limit search to linux-*-3.5.0-19\n\n*Mark linux-headers-3.5.0-19-generic for installation\n\n*If it wasn't selected automatically, select linux-headers-3.5.0-19 as well\n\n*Install\n\n\nAfter I did this (and restarted my computer to be safe), I ran sudo apt-get install nvidia-current-updates in terminal, and this time it correctly installed! I then restarted my computer, and voila! Everything was working!\nThe moral of the story: avoid using non-standard kernels.\nThanks again to mikewhatever for leading me on the right track.\n", "Q: Generic flash downloader There are several content downloaders like You_tube_downloader and many others.

It is available for free in Ubuntu Software Center\n\nFlareGet is a full featured, multi-threaded and multi-segment download manager and accelerator\n\nBut the free version in Ubuntu software center does not support \"Browser integration\", you need to pay $10 to get browser integration plugin. I guess without browser integration, download manager won't make sense.\nSo here is the workaround to get Broeser integration for Firefox. I have tested it on Firefox 18 and it works like a charm.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Just go to Firefox > Tools > Add ons > Extensions.\n  \n*Search for addon \"FlashGot\", install it and Restart the Firefox.\n  \n*Go to Tools > Add ons > Extension > Preferences for FlashGot.\n  \n*On General tab, choose FlareGet as download manager and check the check-box against \"Show in Context Menu\"\n  \n*On FlashGot tab, choose FlareGet as download manager and check the check-box against \"Show Toolbar button\".\n  \n*Now restart the Firefox. FlashGot will act as Firefox integration plugin for FlareGet.\n  \n\nJust right click any downloadable link and choose FlareGet.\n\nIf you want you download video from YouTube just play the video, an icon will appear on right most side of the tile bar. Just click on that icon and FlareGet will capture and download the video.\n\nI love Firefox so this is enough for me. Something similar can be worked out for Chrome.\n", "Q: How to speed up copying files to NTFS drive? I recently bought new USB 3.0 flash drive (write speed: 110 MB/s, read speed: 190 MB/s). And I have Dell XPS 13 (it has SSD and USB 3.0).\nMy problem is speed of copying files to the USB flash stick.\nWhen I formatted it to FAT32 or EXT2, EXT3, EXT4, the speed was around 100 MB/s.

Because when I look to the indicator-multiload, the read speed is around 30 MB/s, but the write is around 100 MB/s (see the graph: http://ubuntuone.com/3zHzUFfR9QGjeV62Qpq6va).\nAnother proof is simple program that I wrote in Java, which only read data from SSD and write them to USB stick. The speed with this program was also around 100 MB/s.\nDoes anybody know, how to improve native copying (cp command) to get the full speed with NTFS drive?\nThank you very much!\nPS: I'm new Ubuntu user.\nEDIT:\nI test it now with 3.9 GB file:\nCTRL+C/CTRL+V in Nautilus: 1:58 (34 MB/s)\nCommand \"cp\": 1:39 (40 MB/s)\nJava program: 0:44 (90 MB/s)\n\nEDIT 2:\nIf anyone wants to try it. Here is the program (for Java 7), that I used (source + compiled): http://ubuntuone.com/0KQgANrgN17izZm5fDPayJ\nTo test it, just cd to the bin folder and run:\njava NtfsCopy source destination\n\nor run:\njava NtfsCopy\n\nto see the usage.\nNOTICE: Please notice that this program has not been tested, so use it at your own risk. To check if the file was copied correctly, use md5sum or sha1sum or something similar.\n\nA: You don't know whether the problem is reading from the SSD or writing to the USB. So, instead of copying SSD -> USB, try copying SSD -> Hard Drive -> USB.\n\nA: I had the same problems copying files from ext4 to NTFS. But, in my case, they were on the same physical disk, just different partitions. However, I've found out in the tests, that using rsync is faster as I got 80kB/s on average.\n", "Q: java not allowing for the use of all 8gb of ram I have a 32bit version of Ubuntu server with PAE active allow for the full use of the 8gb of RAM but I can't use more than 2gb of RAM in Java.

But when I want to open and edit it with a text editor I couldn't see that file in Home folder.\nCan someone tell me why is this. And also if possible how can I access .profile in home folder the GUI way.\n\nA: The reason you can't \"see\" .profile\" is because the ls command\ndoes not display file and directory names starting with .  - this\nis the original device for \"hiding\" files in Unix.\nYou can still edit .profile by typing emacs .profile  (or whatever\neditor you wish to use.)\nAnd, you can \"see\" all your files by typing ls -al  which\nasks for the \"long form\" (more informative) output for all specified\ndirectory or file arguments.\n\nA: GUI way to show a hidden file or folder\nHidden files and folder have names that start with a .

I don't know how to control this in the DOSBOX emulator, but ClamAV found them on a routine scan of my /home folder. Any suggestions?\n\nA: From a security standpoint, if you've got games running on DOSBOX, Wine, or otherwise that have viruses, trojans, worms, or other things, you should just remove them instantly and purge any other files they may have touched.  That'd be my suggestion.\n\nA: Dosbox apps can access and modify files from mounted directory only, So probablity of affecting virus via dosbox is very less. Still it is better to remove viruses for better security\n\nA: You can run a \"boot disk\" anti-virus solution, but there's no telling how well it will handle an emulated environment. You can try one of these antivirus boot disks and see if that gets rid of your viruses.\nAs far as your main question: there's too much we don't know.

I have a laptop computer with the following setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*/ on a btrfs /dev/sda3 subvolume @\n\n*/home on a btrfs /dev/sda3 subvolume @home\n\n*/boot on an ext4 /dev/sda2\n\n*/boot/efi on a vfat /dev/sda1\n\n*no swap\n\n*/tmp on a tmpfs\n\n\nNow I got a new solid state disk that I want to use instead of my current setup. Besides dd'ing the whole disk to the SSD (which I don't want to do since it marks all sectors as used), what steps should I do to copy all data in a way that my system still boots afterwards?\nBig gotcha: I can't insert both discs at once into my system but I have a sufficiently fast eSATA backup disc that is big enough to store all data from the old HDD.\n\nA: Personally, I use tar for this sort of thing: Create a tarball on your eSATA disk with a command like:\nsudo tar cvfz /mnt/backup/backup.tgz --one-file-system / /boot /boot/efi/ /home /tmp\n\nYou can then boot with an emergency system, create your partitions and filesystems, mount your eSATA disk, and unpack the tarball. You'll also need to do some cleaning up -- most notably, you'll need to adjust your /etc/fstab entries for the new system, and probably deal with your boot loader configuration to point it to the new filesystems.\nYou've got \"UEFI\" and \"grub-efi\" tags set, so I assume you've got an EFI-based system. One major difference between BIOS systems and EFI systems is that BIOS-based computers rely on boot code tucked away in boot sectors and elsewhere on the hard disk, whereas EFI relies on boot files on the ESP (/boot/efi in your installation) along with NVRAM entries. When you swap out one disk for another, the old NVRAM entries will no longer be valid, since the GUID of the disk and the GUID of the ESP will have changed. Thus, you'll need to either move your boot loader to the fallback filename of /boot/efi/EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi or create a new NVRAM entry with the efibootmgr utility, as in:\nsudo efibootmgr -c -l \\\\EFI\\\\newloader\\\\loadername.efi -L NewLoader\n\nThe details depend on where your boot loader is located and what you want to call it. In some cases you may need to add more options, particularly if the ESP isn't /dev/sda1. Consult the efibootmgr man page for details. Also, efibootmgr must be run from an EFI boot, so it won't work from some emergency disks.\n", "Q: How to connect to internet using Reliance NetConnect data card?

I have 290.3 GB hard disk which is split into 3 partitions. They are 200 GB, 50 GB and 40 GB in size. The 200 GB partition has my Windows files and the 50 GB partition is totally empty. So I thought I'd use the 50 GB partition for Ubuntu.\nIs that 50 GB one big enough? Is it too big? Which partition should I use? And how do I partition it?\n\nA: The minimum memory requirement for Ubuntu 12.10 is 768 MB of memory and 5 GB of disk space for Ubuntu Desktop. so anything more than 5 GB is good enough for installing Ubuntu 12.10 :)\nThis link will tell you how to install Ubuntu step by step. Hope it helps you!! :)\n\nA: As Mukind said, 50 GB is more than enough to install Ubuntu. As for whether or not you should use a partition bigger or smaller than that, this depends on what you're going to do with your Ubuntu system. If you install a lot of software and store a lot of files in your Ubuntu system, then you might want a bigger partition. If you are using your Ubuntu system for word processing and web browsing and storing most of your big files (e.g., videos) in your other partitions (remember, Ubuntu can access them), then you might choose to make it smaller.\nBut I'd go ahead and install on the 50 GB partition. It's big enough that you can put plenty of stuff in it, and small enough that your Windows partition is big enough for Windows files.\nAs for how to partition it, if you created it in Windows it is probably an NTFS partition. However, Ubuntu does not install on an NTFS partition--Ubuntu prefers to use ext4. Furthermore, when Ubuntu is installed, the default behavior is for it to use a much smaller, separate partition for swap. (This is called a linux-swap partition, or just a \"swap partition\".) Your swap partition is usually just several gigabytes in size.\nSince the 50 GB partition is empty, I recommend going into Disk Management in Windows (right click Computer and click Manage, or click the Start menu, type diskmgmt.msc and press Enter) and removing the 50 GB partition. That way, there will be 50 GB of unpartitioned space where that partition used to be, and the Ubuntu installer can automatically create both the big ext4 partition and the small linux-swap partition where the 50 GB partition used to be.\nThen just boot from an Ubuntu CD/DVD or USB flash drive, install Ubuntu (you may want to try it out first on the live CD if you haven't already), tell it to install alongside existing operating systems, and before allowing it to make changes to your disk, make sure it's not shrinking down any of your remaining NTFS partitions (i.e., that it is really making its partitions in the unpartitioned space where the 50 GB partition used to be).\nThese are some more good resources to walk you through installing Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu 12.10 (official instructions on Ubuntu.com)\n\n*How do I install Ubuntu?

I am looking for any tools that can measure the video quality in a subjective way (As how the eye sees a moving picture). Are there any tools to which I could input a video file and get a subjective reading of how the quality of the video is?\nHere is information thanks to snow about how to measure video quality\nNote that the script there does not work and the other alternative is a windows app.\n\nA: Your interpretation of quality and my interpretation may differ as well as anyone else, therefore your subjective way is tainted. You need a definitive measurement of sort that will recognize pixel strength, movement, blur, saturation, density, focus and such. \nThis will all be handled according to the equipment used of course. What type of input/output media-processing-recording and capture are being used. As well as storing the data via film, digital or magnetic tape? \nThe variables are consistence to the finished product. ie: $100,000 3D theater projector or a home movie 8mm camera? There is a difference.\nNow, back to your graphics card. Can it handle stressing the media analysis? \nMy point is this. There is no ONE GOOD ANSWER. I would suggest starting to research from this site : http://www.linux.com/news/software/applications/321373-the-beat-goes-on-open-source-multimedia-tools-part-2 \nThis may not be definitive enough but you can get a good start. \n\nA: There are two established algorithms that can measure the faithfulness of video to its source.  You have to input two video streams, the original source and the encoded version, and the algorithm calculates the faithfulness and outputs a figure.\nUnfortunately for you, they both require you to supply the un-compressed source along with the compressed video, to do a comparison.  There is no reliable algorithm to detect video quality that doesn't require the source.\n\n\n*\n\n*PSNR is a very simple measure that just takes the difference in each pixel between the source and encoded version and averages out the squares of this difference across all pixels in all frames equally, arriving at a figure, which can be expressed as a \"signal to noise ratio\".\nAs video codecs became increasingly tuned psycho-visually, this algorithm became more and more irrelevant.  Today, optimising a video codec for PSNR equates to optimising it to look badly.  It is a very bad measure of how faithful to the source video actually looks to human eyes.\n\n*SSIM was created in large part due to these deficiencies in PSNR.  It is a more complex algorithm that also takes into account how well the shape of structures in the resulting image correspond to structures in the source.  This heavily biases against certain artefacts common in earlier block based compression (eg MPEG-2 as used in DVD) which includes blocking or ringing, artefacts that contribute a lot to our perception of the video quality even though their contribution to PSNR is lesser.\nSSIM arrives at a figure indicating similarity, which can be converted to a ratio similar to PSNR.\nAs video codecs have evolved even further, SSIM now too has limitations, making it similarly unsuitable as a catch-all measure of video faithfulness.  Modern video codecs such as h.264 do not have as much of a problem with blocking structures due to features such as in-loop deblocking and 4x4 transforms, whereas they do still suffer from loss of detail and noise (blurring), which is not well measured by SSIM.\nThere are other algorithms in existence, some of which claim to solve the deficiencies in these algorithms, but none of which have gained as much popularity.\nTherefore, neither of these algorithms is a suitable way of measuring perceptual video quality.  Instead, tuning video codecs requires a lot of observation: preferably, double-blind comparisons so that the observer can't be biased by knowing the codec in use: a feat that is difficult for video codecs which leave tell-tale signs unique to the codec even in fairly high bitrate compressed videos.\n\nA: Here is a Streaming Video Quality tool I accidentally found.  Unfortunately I can't recall the toggle method. I have been trying to re-find it.  Here are my recent efforts that include an explanation of the tool:\nPlease tell me the name of the feature and especially how to enable / disable it. I found the toggle by accident, and it was cool, but then I left it toggled on and now can't remember how to turn it off.

There are also two more lines below these, one for Audio and one for video. Each of these lines has a quality rating (0, 1, 2, etc) and a graphic of dots added in a line. The length of the line represents the length of the video load. the dots are color coded to show 'waiting for response,' 'receiving bytes,' downloaded, appending, appended, and error. The audio line also shows stats for avg wait in ms and avg receive in ms. The video line shows additional stats for avg wait in ms, avg receive in ms and avg bandwidth in mbps. The is a vertical line that progresses across the dot plot and this line represent the playback position of the video relative to the cached data.\nKey words:\nState (play or pause), load in ms, manifest in ms, stalls, buffer rate in s/s, buffer left in s,  'waiting for response,' 'receiving bytes,' downloaded, appending, appended, and error avg wait in ms and avg receive in ms bandwidth in mbps\nThis is similar in nature to the post Chrome's video statistics feature Categories:47-StableDiscuss ChromeWindows 8\nhttps: / / productforums.google.com/forum/#!msg/chrome/x7q1rM2G3DY/wYpD4896yRwJ;context-place=forum/chrome\n\n12/17/15 Google says:\nI'm not familiar with this feature at all, but my initial guess would be that it's some sort of extension. I don't recognize this as a Chrome feature.\nMy Reply to them was:\n I turned off all extensions and this still exists.  I also know I did not install any extensions or even any other SW at all for weeks (other than anti-virus updates) prior to finding this 'feature.\nI will note that I found the feature while using Chrome to play a OneDrive video in OneDrive's native streaming player.  I went up one side and down the other in two separate hour-long chats with OneDrive 'experts' (clearly Tier I and limited to a problem solving tree) and at the end, microsoft, in their wisdom, says they think it's a virus.  Seriously?  That's where I gave up on them and went to the experts at Google.\nI wish I could remember if I found it with a right-click pop-up, a hidden context menu item, or one of those lucky accidental finds of a shortcut key.  So it could be related OneDrive.  Unfortunately, on the day I found and used the toggle function I only tried it in Chrome, not another browser.  And now I can't remember the toggle function.\nIt's a very sleek and informative function on streaming video.

I booted from the Ubuntu ISO which I burned on a disk and installed Ubuntu, and chose the option to replace windows 7 with Ubuntu, now the version of windows 7 I was running was an illegal cracked version and I already had tried to get rid of it without booting into the actual OS and after many attempts was unsuccessful. Now did installing Ubuntu and choosing the option of replacing windows 7 actually solve my problem and did it wipe the previous windows OS EVERY LITTLE PART OF IT.\n\nA: Your Data Might Still Be Recoverable (But Don't Count On It!)\nSince, as you commented, your goal is to ensure that no data from the Windows system can ever be recovered:\nNo. Nothing you could have done with the Ubuntu installer utility can completely eradicate all possible informational trace of previous data on your disk.\nYou can, however, probably accomplish this, and if you wish, you can probably accomplish this with the Ubuntu live CD. (You cannot accomplish it from within a running operating system installed on the drive, like your newly installed Ubuntu system.)\nTo render all data on a disk permanently unrecoverable, you need to overwrite every byte on the disk. This takes a moderately long time (up to several hours, or days for disks that are really big and also really slow).\nAccording to some respected computer engineers and data recovery specialists, to be entirely sure you're destroying all the data, you have to overwrite it with unpredictably random bytes. (On the other hand, my understanding is that some equally learned folks think that's not necessary.)\nIf you're really interested in doing this, see:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I securely erase a hard drive?\nBut remember that some of the information in some or all of those answers might be wrong.\n\n*How can I reliably erase all information on a hard drive?\nAnswers there could be wrong too, but they're more likely to have useful comments pointing out that something is wrong, because this is one of the sorts of question that really engages the Security.SE community.\nBut is that really what's important?\nThe potential recoverability of data from your old Windows system is entirely irrelevant to all of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your Ubuntu system's stability.\n\n*Your Ubuntu system's security.\n(Malware on your old Windows system cannot cause itself to be run. The configuration that gave it power can no longer be attained by booting to it, unless you deliberately recovered the system to the point of being able to run, which  probably would not succeed. Even if it did, though, anyone who can perform low-level data recovery of old partitions from previous OS installations that are no longer in the partition table, can also do whatever they want to your computer. In order to perform such a recovery, you see, someone already has to have full access to read and write to any part of your hard disk and to cause your computer to perform any action or run any software. If someone wanted to take control of your computer and/or install unwanted software on it, recovering your old Windows system would be one of the least efficient and most ineffective ways imaginable to do that.)\n\n*Your Ubuntu system's performance.\n\n*The amount of disk space available to your Ubuntu system.\n(If data are recoverable from the old OS, that just means that your Ubuntu system hasn't gotten around to storing its own data in all the same places on the disk that contained the old data. The physical presence of remnants of the old data does not make any difference at all to the speed with which any part of the hard drive can be accessed for [over]writing new data.)\n\n*The stability, security, performance, and disk space available to any future operating system installed on your computer, even if it is a Windows operating system. For the same reasons as explained above, any malware on you previous Windows system still has no mechanism to affect the state of a subsequent Windows OS that is written over it.\nFuthermore, assuming the Ubuntu installation worked properly (which is something we can check, see below), you will not be accidentally booting into the old operating system. To get it to even start booting you'd probably have to try hard. If you got it to boot all the way, that would be truly impressive.\n\nJust Installing Ubuntu Over the Old System Seems Reasonable for Most Purposes\nThis following paragraph pertains to law, but I am not a lawyer, this is not legal advice, and relevant law probably varies from one place to another. Please consider this section to be my personal thoughts. I am not even pretending to be able to tell you what is and is not legal.\nIf your goal is to make sure you are not infringing copyright law by having an unlicensed copy of Windows, or to make sure you fulfill your end of an end user license agreement that says you must do something like \"destroy all copies of the software,\" it is hard for me to imagine that installing Ubuntu over it, so that the partition table no longer contains any partition entries for your old system, would not fulfill that requirement. I have never heard of anyone interpreting a requirement to \"destroy all copies\" of a copyrighted work to require that they be destroyed beyond the possibility of even partial recovery. Right now, assuming your Ubuntu installation worked the way it should have (which you can check, see below), your situation is similar to the situation of someone who destroys a paper letter by ripping it up into a thousand pieces, burns a third of them, and then scatters the other two thirds between two separate trash cans in their house that get emptied at different times.\nThen again, I don't know everything. That's not legal advice, and the ripping-paper analogy is a technical illustration that may very well be legally irrelevant. If you need legal advice, you should consult with an attorney who practices law in your jurisdiction.\n\nSometimes You Really Do Have to Destroy All the Data Completely\nIf there is information in your old Windows system that must be kept secret, for example if you are ethically or legally obligated to ensure that it is not disclosed, then it is a good idea to scramble the disk completely (as discussed in the two questions linked above).\nIf there is information in your old Windows system that is so sensitive that one or more people could plausibly die as a result of its disclosure, or that something comparably bad could result, then you should scramble the disk completely. Then, you should physically destroy the disk. The reason for this is that, even if the likelihood is small, it is possible that you could make a mistake (or that your software tools could have a bug) that would cause some data to survive. I am not familiar with what techniques are recommended for physically destroying hard disks, but some government agencies and some businesses do actually have protocols for that sort of thing, some of which can be read by interested members of the public.\nI am guessing your situation is not like either of those two. This section is included for completeness only (and in case you were wondering under what circumstances I recommend making sure all data on a disk are completely destroyed).\nPeace of Mind Is An Acceptable Reason to Securely Erase a Disk\nIt takes a bit of time to read and absorb information about secure erasure techniques. But deciding what technique or utility to use is ultimately not too difficult, and most hard drives these days don't take overwhelmingly long to overwrite.\nTherefore, if it makes you feel better to do it, do it!\n\n\n*\n\n*I don't know how well this works compared to other options, as it's been some time since I read up on securely erasing disks. But many hobbyists and small businesses that resell PC's use Darik's Boot And Nuke. If you really want to securely erase your disk, you might want to use that.\n\n\nOf course, this will overwrite your new Ubuntu system, too. But you just installed it, so you probably haven't customized it much yet. You could probably reinstall it without too much hassle.\nIt is almost certainly not necessary for you to securely erase your disk, but it's kinda cool, so if you feel like it, go ahead!\nYou Should Check Your Partition Table(s) to Make Sure Ubuntu Installed the Way You Wanted\nWithout checking your partition table, you don't know for sure if the Windows partitions themselves were really wiped out. If they weren't wiped out, your Windows system might be fully accessible and you might even end up booting to it again (though this is still not extremely likely, assuming it's not booting now and there's no menu option for it).\nIt's a good idea to do this. Here's how:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot your Ubuntu system if it's not already booted, and log on if you don't have it set to log you on automatically.\n\n*Open a Terminal window by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T.\n\n*Run this command:\nsudo parted -l\n\n(If you want to run sudo fdisk -l instead, as in fabricator4's answer, that's fine. For this purpose, choosing between them mostly comes down to personal preference.)\n\n*You'll probably be prompted for your password. This is the same password that you would use to log in, install updates, or unlock the screen. It is the password you set up when you installed Ubuntu.\n\n\n*\n\n*As you enter it, no placeholder characters (like *) appear. That's by design. Just type the password in and press Enter.\n\n\n*If you know how to read the output of parted or fdisk, you will be able to see if there are any partitions still existing that belong to your old Windows system.\nOtherwise, as fabricator4 said, you can make sure there are no NTFS partitions (since Windows uses NTFS partitions for its system drives, and by default for all drives).\nOr, you can copy all the text from the Terminal, edit your question, paste it in, and then comment on this answer so I know you did so. I (or someone else) can then look at the output and tell you what each existing partition is for and whether or not there are any partitions that belong to a Windows system or that are likely to have existed before you installed Ubuntu.\nI believe checking your partition table to make sure there are no Windows partitions left over is quite sufficient, and I think most other experienced users would agree. Please do not hesitate to ask if you want help interpreting the output of parted or fdisk.\n\nA: If you choose to replace Windows then the hard drive is re-partitioned and formatted completely.  You can be fairly sure that Windows no longer exists.\nYou can verify this by opening a terminal windows and typing\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nwhich will show all drives and all partitions on the system.  You should find that there are absolutely no NTFS Windows partitions on the machine.  If there is a second hard drive in the machine, and if Windows was installed on that also, then it's possible that it might still exist.\n", "Q: How to find drivers and tools for eeePc F201e I got a F201e with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS preinstalled.

I don't want to update to 11 or 12 since my system is lagging so much, and I would like to stick with 10.10.\n\nA: 10.10 is now End of Life as support for it ran out in April.  You can see the release and support schedule here. You will find it increasingly difficult to maintain this release.\nUbuntu 12.04 LTS is supported until 2017 however you might be more happy with one of the lighter distributions available (Lubuntu, Xubuntu)\nPersonally I would recommend Lubuntu on less capable machines, however the much lighter apps may not suit your tastes.  It certainly makes for a very snappy machine however.  Given that you're working with gtk you might want to investigate other issues that may be involved in both of these, for example theming issues with gtk.\nNote that Lubuntu 12.04 is not an LTS release.  The Lubuntu team have decided not to have LTS releases which means that they are strictly on an 18 month support cycle. I believe the reason is that they do not have the resources to support LTS releases. It would more of an advantage to try Lubuntu 12.10 in this case.\n", "Q: Help: cannot install a gz package on Ubuntu 12.10 64-bit I am a new Ubuntu user.

You can try again changing the username with the GUI or you can relax the check by using the command line with the following command.\nsudo adduser --force-badname <username>\n\nand then if you want to add the user to the sudo group run the following command.\nsudo adduser <username> sudo\n\n\nA: In Debian systems, the regex defining acceptable user names is found in /etc/adduser.conf.\nA typical regex (found on my system) is:\nNAME_REGEX=\"^[a-z][-a-z0-9_]*\\$\"\n\nI don't want to veer too far off topic with regex parsing, but the caret ^ symbol indicates the beginning character of the user name must be between lowercase a and lowercase z. The remaining characters may be lowercase a-z, 0-9, hyphen, or underscore. As mentioned in other answers, you can override this check if you like. By default, regexes are case-sensitive.\n\nA: You can force this by using the --force-badname option 'adduser --force-badname Ali', or by changing the regex in the aforementioned config-file, however...\nThe reason upper-case letters aren't normally allowed is that it leads to ambiguous and confusing usernames, both to humans and to programs.  I.e. John, john, JOHn, and JOHN, would all be separate usernames, if allowed or forced (sixteen variations with four of the same letters, upper and lower-case).  As to other symbols, it could lead to catastrophic and dire consequences in some cases-- for example having the pipe symbol '|' would probably be a really bad idea, because it means something in the command-line, and sometimes to other programs that might not deal well with it in a username.  With caps, standard email in particular is usually not case-sensitive, and could lead to mixed up or undeliverable mailboxes if used this way-- normally reverting all to lower-case, because that's the historical standard, not to mention whatever is contained in the RFC's.  Be careful if you tread outside those bounds.  I'm not saying never do it-- but be advised and consider that it would be experimental and may not be freindly to all your purposes.\n", "Q: Using TP-Link TL-WDN-4800 I am currently unable to run my newly obtained TP-Link TL-WDN-4800 wireless card with Ubuntu 12.10 and I'm currently unable to get it working.\nI've tried sudo modprobe ath9k, and that didn't change anything, so I added ath9k to the end of /etc/modules and that didn't work.

The music collection is only a few hundred GBs. I've tried adding my music collection to a number of different apps, so far with no luck. \nI have tried:\n1) Clementine\n2) Exaile\n3) Spotify\nThe issues with each are:\n1) File loading never completes. Even after waiting days. It approaches 90% and then the percentage complete begins dropping. I have no idea why this is happening\n2) Exaile is just buggy. The files seem to eventually load (well, I have only tried the albums starting with \"A\") but even with this small collection loaded I have interrupted music playback and frequent fading out of the app GUI (while it 'thinks')\n3) Spotify just doesn't seem to scan the mounted share at all. I can't get anywhere, which is a shame.. as it's a great way to catalog your collection with the additional online resource in one searchable library.\nPlayback through Audacious works fine when I drop in a folder from the mounted share.

I answered a similar question regarding Rhythmbox with Samba shares:\nRhythmbox's not playing music from network share\nYou'll probably have to modify this method slightly to account for your HDD being plugged directly into your router - I'm not sure how your router would mount the drive or share it on the network, sorry!\n\nA: What I'm used in the past for local network music server is tangerine.

The problem is that I can't adjust brightness at all. If I press the relevant media keys, the indicator in ubuntu works correctly but the brightness is not changed.\nSo far I've tried the following:\nEditing xorg.conf in this way:\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"Device0\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n    Option         \"RegistryDwords\" \"EnableBrightnessControl=1\"\nEndSection\n\nAdding the options acpi_osi=linux acpi_backlight=vendor to the grub boot options\nSetting brightness from the terminal and using xbacklight. The values of /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness can be changed as well but the brightness remains the same.\nDo you have any other hints?\nSolution\nIt is possible to enable the backlight by installing the nvidiabl module. First of all install git and dkms:\n$ sudo apt-get install git dkms\n\nDownload the code on your machine and compile the package:\n$ git clone https://github.com/guillaumezin/nvidiabl.git\n$ cd nvidiabl\n$ sudo make dkms-install\n\nNow the module should be installed. To activate the nvidiabl module you should issue the command:\n$ sudo modprobe nvidiabl\n\nNow the directory /sys/class/backlight/nvidia_backlight/ should be present. In order to manually change the brightness you have to write in the brightness file:\n$ sudo su\n# echo 100 > /sys/class/backlight/nvidia_backligh/brightness\n\nYou can substitute 100 with any value up to 127. In my case not the complete range of backlight are supported. You can tune the brightness calibration by varying the min and max parameters (you will still have to write values in brightness up to 127):\n$ sudo modprobe -r nvidiabl\n$ sudo modprobe nvidiabl max=100000 min=10\n\nYou can load the module at startup by adding nvidiabl (with or without max and min parameters) to the file /etc/modules, but I still haven't figured out how to properly add hotkeys.\n\nA: I installed Xubuntu 12.10 on my new Lenovo Y500 and also could not adjust brightness, it was at at maximum and could not be controlled. \nGet installed and used graphics driver:\nlshw -c video\nGave me:\nconfiguration: drigver=nouveau latency=0\n\n\n\n*\n\n*changing the value in /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness does not change brightness\n\n*booting with acpi_backlight=vendor does not change brightness\n\n*etpci -s 00:01.0 F4.B=XX (XX = 00 to ff) does not change brightness\n\n\nFor the moment I solved this by installing the nvidia driver:\nsudo apt-get install linux-source\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current-updates\n\nThis gives you the terminal command:\nsudo nvidia-settings \n\nGo to: \nDFP-0-(LGD), Tab: Color Correction \nHere you can set the brightness. \n\nA: Add this to grub:\nacpi_backlight=vendor\n\n\nA: I am using xbacklight\nyou can install it with: sudo apt-get install xbacklight\nxbacklight use-help for saver as used, is very simple to use, you can assign any key convinacion\nami I worked until you install some nvidia driver\nyou can install it manually by downloading the driver from the nvidia official website as follows:\nctrl + alt + f1\nLightDM stop sudo service\nsudo chmod + x NVIDIA.run\nsudo. / NVIDIA.run\nif there is some error with the nouveau driver, select that whether or accept\nrestart the computer and re-run the NVIDIA.run\nor repositories THROUGH\nfor ubuntu 13.04 or 12.10:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa: xorg-edgers/ppa\nfor ubuntu 12.04:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa: ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current nvidia-settings\n\nA: I dunno if this is helpful to anyone at all, but I've come across this post several times looking for help with my Y500.\nI'm running mint cinnamon 17 and I have the GT 750M, with the NVIDIA drivers.  All I needed to do was install xbacklight and set my keyboard bindings for the function keys to xbacklight -inc 10 and xbacklight -dec 10.\n\nA: To resolve the brightness problem on a Lenovo Y500 you should to do the following:\n1. In the file \"/etc/default/grub\" you need to change following string:\n\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nto\n\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_backlight=vendor\"\n\n2. Reboot your laptop!\n3. Now you can change the brightness of display with following command (for example we want to set 30% of brightness):\n\necho 30 > /sys/class/backlight/nv_backlight/brightness\n\n4. If you want configure the brightness automatically during booting OS you need the following. After selecting a suitable brightness, add the following command to /etc/rc.local (for example if you have chose 30% of brightness):\n\necho 30 > /sys/class/backlight/nv_backlight/brightness\n\nI have tested this on my Lapton Y500, GeForce GT 750M (Ubuntu 14.04)\n", "Q: SSH Process not Killed on Remote Machine when the Remote System Unexpectedly Disconnects I have a question to which I haven't been able to find an answer. I have two computers, both of which run Ubuntu 12.04. I keep one of my computers at home and use SSH to connect to it from the other (\"remote\") computer. The remote computer is able to connect to the home computer without problems. The remote computer also has SetAliveInterval set to 60 in /etc/ssh/ssh_config, so that the connection doesn't die if I step away from the computer for a moment.\nOccasionally, my internet connection on my remote computer gets interrupted. Internet interruptions cause my SSH tunnel to close (of course). When I restore internet connectivity and re-connect to the home computer using a new SSH tunnel, though, I can see using #ps ax that the old SSH connection process is still running. This is a problem because I use an encrypted home directory on the home computer, which doesn't allow the files to be re-encrypted until that (now-dead) SSH connection is killed. \nIs there a way to set sshd_config on the home computer so that it automatically detects when a connection has died, and terminates it?\n\nA: Try screen or tmux. On the server side, or both sides if you like:\nsudo apt-get install tmux\n\nAfter logging in, start tmux.\ntmux\n\nIf the connection breaks, log in again via ssh and reconnect the tmux session.\nTo discover the session number:\ntmux ls\n\nThe output might be something like this:\n0: 1 windows (created Tue Dec 25 19:20:40 2012)\nConnect to the tmux numbered session like this:\ntmux attach -t 0\n\nThen you are right back where you left it. You won't have to kill the sessions. They just wait for your next visit. Or, if you just want to kill the session...\nOn the server side, see the /etc/ssh/sshd_config setting for ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax. (man 5 ssh_config)\nClientAliveInterval 300\nClientAliveCountMax 0\n\nOnce they have been changed to your preference, restart the SSH server.\nsudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart\n\nThe 300 is seconds (five minutes).\n\nA: You could try mosh , a replacement for SSH built on top of SSH. It supports and roaming and intermittent connectivity, so your Mosh (SSH) session would just continue where you left off whenever your Internet connection gets re-established after an interruption.\nYou will need to install Mosh on both machines.\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mosh's website\n", "Q: Is the Ubuntu installer capable of resizing/moving existing NTFS partitions?

I know that you can resize partitions.

GParted is a good tool to use for resizing, moving and creating partitions.\nJust boot Ubuntu from a CD or USB stick, choose \"Try Ubuntu\", and then open GParted.\n\nA: You haven't detailed your existing installations, but I am expecting that all 3 are windows partitions, so, essentially you want to \"resize\" the partitions and create new partitions.\nI believe(not sure) it can be done, but it is dangerous preposition. I did something to resize my Ubuntu partition but lost grub in doing so. Here are the steps I would look into to start with.\n\nA: If you want to resize a logical partition (e.g. 285 GB data partition in your hard drive), you may as well use EaseUS Partition Master from within an existing Windows installation.\nIt proved to be very useful and easy for me when I was a newbie to Ubuntu.\nBe sure to leave installation space that you set aside for Ubuntu as unallocated.

Some hardware has drivers that can take over and allow software control if you desire ( but this is not recommended ).

Last week I gave google next try and it occured that\n  it's hardware problem in some of dell's laptops family. I've been\n  using i8k since ubuntu 12.10 till yesterday. Look on this post:\n  http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/laptop/f/3518/t/19511930.aspx\nI've added heat sink like this guy suggested and now everythink works\n  like should without i8kfan. I have checked temperatures and it looks\n  that dell is suppressing fan control in windows with drivers. I've\n  tested it in such way that after turning laptop on I stopped  on uboot\n  screen and waited for couple of minutes. Fan shortly hit the maximum\n  so then next step was to boot into windows. Fans stopped immediately\n  after couple of seconds but I've checked and temperature of PCH was\n  always >65Degress. Now after installing termalpad and small copper\n  heat sink temp is ~50 and even on grub menu fans are quiet. I think\n  this is only reasonable solution. Some dell's guy just f-u-c-k-e-d up\n  design cause thermal plate which covers almost all main board is cut\n  on PCH chip so it is without any thermal sink. they should repair such\n  things on warranty. Hope this helps, after over a year it is really\n  pleasant to have it finally quiet.\n\n", "Q: Migrate Ubuntu Studio 12.0.4 To New Machine Also Using Ubuntu 12.0.4 I have been attempting to find the proper avenue to migrate my Ubuntu Studio 12.0.4 (Low Latency) user account, settings, and programs. My MAC is running a virtual Machine with the prior Ubuntu version mentioned on Parallels Desktop 7. I have a Ubuntu configuration that I'm comfortable with and I would loath having to spend hours tweaking everything to my liking. \n*I utilized my laptop as a test machine and I question how to avoid any migration of drivers.

Therefore, I require more instruction and descriptiveness than most. I am not well acclimated with Ubuntu yet.

It is possible that the terminal (xterm, gnome-term, etc) used up all your memory if set to unlimited buffer/lines.\n", "Q: I can't update, upgrade and remove my app from kubuntu I have a problem upgrading software.

This happens when the information on your Ubuntu system about what packages are available in what versions is out of date.\nIf you are updating with the Software Center or the Update Manager, this should not be happening, as they are supposed to automatically retrieve up-to-date information about what packages and versions are available.\nHowever, if you are using the command line and you're just running sudo apt-get upgrade, this is entirely expected. When updating your system or installing new software from the command line, you should run sudo apt-get update first. So, to upgrade, run:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\n(To make sure you're upgraded, you may want to then run sudo apt-get dist-upgrade to catch any updates that require other packages to be installed or removed. Unless you're experienced at knowing what packages can and cannot be removed safely, I recommend running that after sudo apt-get upgrade.)\nFor a more detailed explanation of why it's important to run sudo apt-get update and what each of the commands does, take a look at:\n\n\n*\n\n*What does \"sudo apt-get update\" do?\n", "Q: My makefile results in: No rule to make target `arch/x86/tools/relocs.c', needed I am using Ubuntu 12.04.

The path is not different in Nautilus, it just shows it like that in the GUI.\nPress Ctrl+L in nautilus to view the actual path.\n\nA: Nautilus use the word \"Home\" to identify your /home/ directory.\nWhen it shows the path in the breadcrumb, the first \"home\" is the actual /home dir, and the second one (\"Home\") represents your /home/ directory.\nThis substitution makes sense is some cases - I think it's easier for the user to identify the home folder by the name \"Home\", instead of the username.

I have a VirtualBox virtual machine. The host machine runs Ubuntu. The guest (virtual) machine runs Windows XP.\nI googled this problem, and people claim that they fixed it by changing adapter type to NAT, but there is no such option for me:\n\nAny idea?\nUpdate:\nIt didn't work either, after just switching it to NAT. Here are the current settings (with all details shown):\n\nHere's a screenshot of the guest showing some networking information:\n(Please note that this question is about how to give a VM Internet access in VirtualBox, so the presence of a picture of Windows doesn't automatically make this off-topic!)\n\nLarger image here.\n\nA: NAT is in the Attached to drop-down list.\nThe adapter type is advanced and does not have to be changed in most cases..\nBridged should work fine too, but you have to adjust the network interface. Name has to be set to your internet interface on your host machine (very likely wlan for wireless, eth for ethernet).\n\nA: Setting Up NAT\nNAT is not an option for Adapter Type. Rather, it's an option for Attached to.\nClick where it currently says Bridged Adapter and you should be able to select NAT.\nBy the way, the reason changing it to NAT sometimes helps is not specific to Windows guests. Rather, if your physical (host) PC is on a LAN, Bridged Adapter (as well as NAT) usually works fine. If your physical PC has a network connection for just one computer--as is often the case if it's plugged directly into a cable/DSL/ISDN modem that only has one Ethernet port on it--then there is no local network to bridge to, so then you must use NAT.\nIf you use Bridged Adapter and your host machine is on a physical LAN, your guest machine will automatically be able to see and be seen by computers on the LAN. If you use NAT on a LAN, the guest machine will be able to see the other computers on the LAN but the other computers on the LAN (besides the virtualization host) will not be able to see it.\nIf you're interested in more details, see these articles on network bridging and network address translation.\nIf that works, great. Otherwise...\nCheck the Guest's Network Configuration\nIn the virtual machine, open the Network Connections configuration (from the Control Panel or in Start Menu > Settings). Unless you've manually configured multiple interfaces for the guest machines in VirtualBox (or have actual network adapters attached to it with USB forwarding), you'll see just one, and unless you've changed its name, it will be called Local Area Connection (perhaps with a number after it).\nRight-click on that and click Properties.\n\nUnder The connection uses the following items, click Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and click Properties.\n\nMake sure the configuration is correct.\nFor Bridged Connections\nIf you kept the VM's network adapter bridged in VirtualBox, rather than switching it to NAT, then it is as if there is a layer 2 network switch connecting three devices:\n\n\n*\n\n*The virtual machine.\n\n*The physical host machine.\n\n*Whatever the physical host machine is connected to (on the particular host network adapter that was bridged). For example, if your computer is plugged into a router, it's like the switch is plugged into the router. If it's connected wirelessly to an access point, it's like the switch is a wireless bridge.\n\n\nSo, your VM is \"networkologically\" equivalent to your host machine. Whatever settings it has (except its IP address of course), your virtual machine should have.\nFor NAT Connections\nIf you selected NAT for Attached to in VirtualBox, then it's like your real computer is acting like a small home/office router. Your host machine runs a DHCP server that is accessible only to VirtualBox virtual machines, and the guest gets all its network configuration information from it.\nThe VirtualBox DHCP server will provide both an IP address and DNS information to the guest, so both of these two options should be selected:\n\n\n*\n\n*Obtain an IP address automatically\n\n*Obtain DNS server address automatically\n\nThis is the key.\nThis is the particular problem, for the system in this question. If this is the only problem with the configuration, then fixing this should solve the matter entirely.\nYou have manual settings, rather than DHCP.\nThat can work, but the manual settings would need to be correct, and you'd also want to make sure the IP was not in the range of IP addresses that your router assigns from (or there could be a collision with another device on the network).\nIn this case, the manual settings are not correct at all, because:\n\n\n*\n\n*The host machine's IP address on the network interface through which it provides an Internet connection to the guest is not the same as its IP address on the physical network. Even if your computer's IP address is 192.168.1.1 \"in real life,\" the guest cannot access it that way.\n\n\n*\n\n*More likely, if you set it up this way yourself, you may have been thinking that you should put your real-life home/office router's IP address (which is often 192.168.1.1) in as the default gateway and the primary DNS server.\n\n\nBut the guest cannot directly access the physical NAT router on your desk (or wherever), because any data transmitted between the VM and the real router must go through the VM's router, and the VM's router is your computer (accessed through that special virtual network interface).\n\n*Since the default gateway is wrong, no routing occurs and the VM cannot access any physical network devices outside your computer.\n\n*Since the VM's IP address is outside the correct range (which is usually 10.2.2.*) and the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, it cannot access the correct range. (The subnet mask is correct, but together with the IP it identifies the wrong subnet.)\n\n*The DNS server must also be fixed or no hosts can be accessed through their domain names (like askubuntu.com).\nIf for some reason you need to use a \"static IP,\" i.e., not use DHCP, then you'll have to get the correct information from VirtualBox and input it. Please let me know if you need help with that (I can expand this to include instructions).\nAssuming DHCP is okay with you, you can solve the problem by making your Internet Protocol (TCP/IP Properties), General tab settings look like the screenshot above.\nStill No Internet Connection? Time to Troubleshoot\nIt may help to gather some more information from the guest side. In the virtualized Windows XP system that is mysteriously not connecting to the Internet, install the VirtualBox guest additions (by clicking Devices > Install Guest Additions; see the manual for more information). Reboot, and see if you can connect to the Internet. If you cannot, you've still accomplished something useful, because now you can copy and paste between the guest and host clipboards.\nSo open the Command Prompt in Windows. One way to do that is to run:\n\nStart > Run... > cmd.exe\n\nNow run this command to get information about the Windows guest system's network interfaces and connections.\nipconfig /all\n\nThen copy all the text in the command prompt to the clipboard. This functionality is accessible in the contextual menu raised by right-clicking anywhere inside the command prompt window. You can then edit your question on your Ubuntu host system where you have a working Internet connection, and paste it in.\n\n\n*\n\n*More generally, for people other than the asker of this question:\nYou can then paste it into applications in your Ubuntu host system, permitting you to refer to it when your Windows VM is suspended/off. You can provide it to whoever is trying to help you. You can include it in your own question here on Ask Ubuntu\n(However, if your network problem is in the virtual installation, rather than the virtual hardware or the VirtualBox software--for example, if your VM accessed the Internet fine until you installed some Windows software other than the guest additions--then your problem would likely be considered off- topic for Ask Ubuntu. It would likely be on-topic for Super User though.)\n\nA: This solution has worked just perfectly for me (Host OS: Ubuntu 14.04; Guest OS: Windows XP SP3):\nSelect \"PCnet-PCI II (Am79C970A)\" at 'NAT'->'Advanced'->'Adapter Type'.\n", "Q: What does Ubuntu iso \"desktop image \" mean?

After, click on the output device tab and select the HDMI output if it is not already selected.\n\nA: I've solved the problem. Apparently the problem was my graphic card was not installed, so i finally managed to update the graphic crad driver and the hdmi audio option finally appreared in sound settings.\n", "Q: GPU Compatibility I've recently installed Ubuntu 12.10 but haven't succeeded in getting a driver to work with My graphics card (Radeon Mobility HD 5650).\nIs there a graphics card out there I can purchase and add to my system for which there is a confirmed compatible driver?\nNote: I'm not a gamer or anything like that; my graphics needs are rather basic.\n\nA: I have a system using a Radeon HD 5650 (it is the desktop version though), which needs the AMD Catalyst Control Centre to be installed for all the features to work properly. You can download it from here: http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/linux/Pages/radeon_linux.aspx?type=2.4.1&product=2.4.1.3.42&lang=English\nYou might also need the latest proprietary driver installed under System > Administration > Hardware Drivers (Gnome) or System > Hardware Driver (KDE) (alternatively run jockey-gtk or jockey-kde from command line).

I managed to install 12.10 without any problems following the advices on this page. Everything worked as expected, even many of the Fn keys, excluding F5 and F6. \nThe problem came after upgrading the kernel to 3.5.0-19 and onwards (as suggested by ubuntu update manager) that WMI stopped to work. When executing lsmod I can see far less modules loaded than when I boot with a working kernel and loading those modules by hand does not work. Actually every fn key behaves as if I was pressing fn+f4 (this after loading the modules by hand).\nIs there anything I can do to make this work? \nShouldn't I be using 12.10 with this hardware?\nRight now the solution I have is to manually boot with kernel 3.5.0-18 that seems to work flawlessly.\n\nA: Ok... solved. The modules directory /lib/modules/ was not present at boot time. Only some of the kernels had the directory present. \nMaking the directory available at boot time solved the problem. \n", "Q: Video hangs while playing on VLC I have just installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.I am unable to play any video.When I play video on VLC the video freezes and after few min it moves to some other frame and also the sound is breaking.  \nPC Details(From Ubuntu >system setting > details)\nRAM 968.5 MiB \nProcessor AMD Athlon(tm) 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 4000+ × 2 \nGraphic Unknown\nOS type 32 bit\nDisk 248.7\nMother Board ASUS M2NPV-VM\n\nA: There are a few steps that you could try.

However, when I use terminal and look at files (using \"ls\" or \"la\" command) I can see the deleted files with \"~\" added after their names. For instance, a file named \"Test.txt\" will have a copy named \"Test.txt~\" after deletion.\nIs this a bug? Why don't those files get deleted even after some time? \n\nA: In Linux, files beginning with a dot are hidden files. A lot of commands (like ls) will not display these by default. In addition, Nautilus also hides files that end with a ~. These files generally are backup files created by text editors like Gedit.\nIf you want to delete these files in Nautilus, you need to view the hidden files first by pressing Ctrl+H or by clicking View, Show Hidden Files.\nTo permanently prevent gedit from creating backup files head to Edit --> Preferences --> Editor and remove the checkmark in front of Create a backup copy of file before saving:\n\nNote: Please consider that backup files can be quite handy at times, so disabling them might not be the best idea.\n", "Q: Windows 8 not booting any more I installed Ubuntu 12.10 alongside Windows 8 after this guide.

May be I can use live disk, but I don't know how to configure packages on my HD from livedisk.\nI am on Windows 8 now. Any help regarding how can I get my desktop back is appreciated!\n\nA: I am writing an answer for my question, but actually I haven't figured out exactly what happened that gave rise to those errors.\nI am assuming that the whole xorg itself broke and I got my desktop back by using a live disk and chrooting (yeah - had to do that as its hard to connect to internet from terminal and its lot more easier to connect to internet from live disk and copy resolv.conf from here to there). \nSo, after creating a live disk and in Try Ubuntu mode, I chrooted into old partitions (I followed the guide here) and did\napt-get update && apt-get upgrade\napt-get install --reinstall xserver-xorg\napt-get install --reinstall gdm gnome-desktop-environment xorg\n\nThen I changed my default display manager to gdm at /etc/X11/default-display-manager by changing this line (I think this step is not needed if after a restart your desktop is working fine, but I basically did a couple more things than said above and broke lightdm too, so I had to change to gdm!)\n/usr/sbin/lightdm\n\nto\n/usr/sbin/gdm\n\nand restarted. Well, unity is working and I got my desktop back working. \n\nA: you have to try this \n sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg\n\n", "Q: In a bash script what does a dot followed by a space and then a path mean? I came across this example when trying to mount a usb device inside a openvz container and I have never seen the construct in the second line before. Can you explain what it signifies?\n#!/bin/bash\n. /etc/vz/vz.conf\n\n\nA: \nWhen a script is run using `source' it runs within the existing shell, any variables created or modified by the script will remain available after the script completes.\n\nSyntax\n      . filename [arguments]\n  source filename [arguments]\n\n\nA: It's a synonym of the builtin source. It will execute commands from a file in the current shell, as read from help source or help ..\nIn your case, the file /etc/vz/vz.conf will be executed (very likely, it only contains variable assignments that will be used later in the script). It differs from just executing the file with, e.g., /etc/vz/vz.conf in many ways: the most obvious is that the file doesn't need to be executable; then you will think of running it with bash /etc/vz/vz.conf but this will only execute it in a child process, and the parent script will not see any modifications (e.g., of variables) the child makes.\nExample:\n$ # Create a file testfile that contains a variable assignment:\n$ echo \"a=hello\" > testfile\n$ # Check that the variable expands to nothing:\n$ echo \"$a\"\n\n$ # Good. Now execute the file testfile with bash\n$ bash testfile\n$ # Check that the variable a still expands to nothing:\n$ echo \"$a\"\n\n$ # Now _source_ the file testfile:\n$ . testfile\n$ # Now check the value of the variable a:\n$ echo \"$a\"\nhello\n$\n\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Gwibber Problems I have configured my facebook account in Gwibber since I installed Ubuntu 12.10.\nUntil a few days I started to notice that the program does not refresh and display notifications, when opened gwibber interface goes blank and not updated.

I've tried manual reconfiguring of file system, have tried automatic one. also tried to install ubuntu 12.04 - destop - amd64. None of errors were noticed during the installation process. But after install windows 7 starts automatically. seems to me that nothing changed within winloader. I know that not so much info i put in here, but i'll answer any questions. \n\nA: Your problem is that you're attempting to mix BIOS-style and EFI-style booting. Windows 7 is installed in EFI mode, as indicated by the use of a GUID Partition Table (GPT) with an EFI System Partition (ESP) as /dev/sda1 that contains Windows EFI boot files such as EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi. Your Ubuntu installation is in BIOS mode, though, as indicated by the presence of GRUB code in the MBR, the presence of a BIOS Boot Partition (/dev/sda5), the lack of any Ubuntu EFI boot loaders in the ESP, and the fact that you attempted to install the i386 version.\nThe cleanest solution is to wipe your current Ubuntu installation, download an AMD64 version, and install it in EFI mode. Unfortunately, the Ubuntu installer doesn't make it clear that you're running in EFI mode vs. BIOS mode. To make that determination, you should open a shell and look for the directory /sys/firmware/efi. If it's present, you've booted in EFI mode; if it's absent, you've probably booted in BIOS mode. If you boot an AMD64 installer and find that this directory is absent, try again, but use whatever tool your computer offers to select the boot device, and be sure to select the one for your CD or USB flash drive that includes \"EFI\" or \"UEFI\" as part of its description.\nAnother solution is to install my rEFInd boot manager in Windows. Edit the refind.conf file so that the scanfor line is uncommented and includes the hdbios item. rEFInd should then give you boot options for Windows and for a generic BIOS option. The latter should launch GRUB, which in turn will take you to Linux. Using two boot managers complicates the startup process, so it's better to install a 64-bit version of Ubuntu unless you've got a compelling reason to use a 32-bit version. (Such compelling reasons to go 32-bit are rare these days.)\nYet another solution is to use your computer's own boot manager, which you typically access by pressing F2, F8, or some other function key during startup. You should have options to boot Windows in EFI mode or to boot from your hard disk in BIOS/legacy mode. (The exact names used vary from one installation to another.) This is likely to be the most awkward solution in the long run, but you might consider it acceptable, especially if your firmware has a better-than-average boot manager.\n\nA: You didn't install Ubuntu bootloader to MBR.\nTo restore GRUB follow this link:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows\nIf restoring fails, see the first answer:\nHow can I repair grub? (How to get Ubuntu back after installing Windows?)\nIf it still fails, try again but install GRUB to your Ubuntu partition:\nif it is in /dev/sda7 enter\ngrub-install /dev/sda7\n\nand NOT\ngrub-install /dev/sda\n\nto install, then use EasyBCD and add an entry for your Ubuntu partition.\n\nA: Helo\nTry this metode if you've grub installed:\nIn Terminal:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo update-grub\n\n*edit by NANO or vii /etc/default/grub  and modify if in GRUB_TIMEOUT= 0 modify for ex 5 and SAVE; easier in Midnight Commander (apt-get install mc)(sudo -s ENTER, mc ENTER)!!!/etc/default/grub and F4!!!!(sudo -s ENTER, mc ENTER)\n\n*again\nsudo update-grub\n\n*Close the terminal and RESTART or REBOOT\n", "Q: How to clean from non working files?

A new folder called \"Link to source_folder\" will be created in /home/you_name/ and you can move it inside dest_folder and rename the link to what you want.\n\nA: You can do it from the Termnial:\nln -s /home/your_name/source_folder /home/you_name/dest_folder\n\n\nA: Right click the folder you want to link to, select Make Link. A link to the that folder will be created, and you can copy it to the music folder, or wherever within the filesystem.\nPS: Apologies, if it's not like in Windows, not sure how it's done there.\n\nA: If you have a Mouse with 3 buttons (or a pressable mouse wheel) you can drag and drop the file/folder with the 3rd button pressed.\nAlternatively, hold down the \"Alt\"-Key while dragging. A pop-up menu will give you options whether you want to link, move or copy.\n(That is for Unity and Gnome. KDE might be different.)\nEDIT:\nI just played around a little. When you press \"Shift+CTRL\" while you drag, it will crate a link. The mouse pointer indicates which action will be taken (a small plus next to it means copy, a knot for a link)\n", "Q: Is there any Gtk+ 3 port of the Redmond theme?

It's definitely got some rough edges, like occasionally taking forever to sync and the menubar helper doesn't quit when I select Quit. So I want to remove it completely. How do I do that?\n\nA: We would love to have the opportunity to solve your problems with it - if you contact support at https://one.ubuntu.com/help/contact/ we will investigate.\nIn particular the menubar helper not quitting is a bug that I'd personally like to hear more about - if you have the time, a bug report that describes in more detail what you did and what the context was, and includes the log files from ~/Library/Caches/ubuntuone/ (those will contain file names, so you can mark it as private), would be really helpful - the place to file that bug would be here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntuone-control-panel/+filebug\n\nIf you would still rather completely remove the Mac client, here's how:\nFirst quit the service (not just the control panel app) using the quit menu item in the menubar helper.\n(If that doesn't work, force quit everything with 'ubuntuone' in its name using Activity Monitor).\nIf you never run the app again, the ~/Ubuntu One/ folder is just another folder and nothing will change it.\nYou could stop here in case you would like to try using it again in the future.\nTo continue and really wipe everything:\n\n\n*\n\n*Drag Ubuntu One.app to the trash.\n\n*Remove the following data and log folders: \n~/Library/Application Support/ubuntuone/syncdaemon\n~/Library/Application Support/ubuntuone/shares (NOTE: this deletes shared folders, copy any files you want to keep out first.)\n~/Library/Caches/ubuntuone\n~/Library/Caches/sso\n\n\n*Remove the background fsevents monitor, which watches for changes in the file system:\nfrom the terminal, type sudo launchctl remove com.ubuntu.one.fsevents\nThis will prompt you for your administrator password.\n(The fsevents monitor does nothing if the syncdaemon process is not running, so this is not strictly necessary).\n", "Q: Many problems booting / shuting down ubuntu 12.10 I installed Ubuntu 12.10 about a month ago, and since then it's been some kind of a nightmare! not listing all the issues I had to face, now I have this weird behaviour that really bugs me: when I turn on my pc (and if it properly boots after grub's menu), sometimes the synaptic touchpad does not work at all. I can login using the keyboard and then use the terminal to try to reboot or attempt to fix problems, but this results usually in the pc freezing at the \"exit\" screen, with strange lines of messages interfering with the coloured background. Every possible solution found to fix the touchpad won't be of any help.\nThus, with no touchpad and the pc stuck, all I can do is to brutally shut the pc down and restart: it usually takes from two to five times in a row of \"brute-shut-downs_reboots\" before getting the touchpad back working. And when it works, I can check all properties and log files related, but always everything appears to be fine.\nI'd like to know which conditions could lead to such random behaviour and, if any, which actions to attempt in order to solve this annoying problem\nps\nI'm running ubuntu 12.10 64bit with gnome3, linux kernel 3.5.0-21-generic.

Figuring out sudo as the source of unspecific server error messages would be too much of a headache.\nIf you do not need this, and are certain that you will never call postgres binaries in such error-prone way you can safely remove the shell:\nusermod --shell /bin/false postgres\n\nKeep in mind that, beign able to become root, you can still become anyone, including users without valid shells:\nsu --shell /bin/bash postgres\n\nAuthoritative source:\n\nSometimes you want to log in as that user to be able to do certain\n  types of special administration or fixes. For example, if you ever \n  need to run pg_resetxlog, you probably want to be logged in as postgres, \n  unless you are very confident that your su or sudo invocations\n  are correct and don't mess up the permissions of the database\n  directory in strange ways. -- Peter Eisentraut, PostgreSQL dev\n\n\nA: There is a shell because we use PostgreSQL from the command line as the PostgreSQL user.\n\nA: Postgres runs under a special operating system user account for security reasons. This account is created on your machine when the installer runs, and unless overridden on the command line, it will be called \"postgres\". \nOn Unix-like operating systems such as Linux and Mac OS X, the account is setup without a password and users generally never need to worry about it again.

Java isn't freely redistributable, so the PPA makes you agree to the license and then downloads it from Java to head off any potential legal conflicts.  The PPA has always been this way.\n\nA: I cant help you install java with that ppa. But I can explain why there is no java files in the ppa. Its because Sun(now Oracle) changed their license.

It contains all the system files that make Ubuntu work.  In order to create a liveCD you need to extract the files from the ISO.  You do this with a program that knows how to extract the insides of the ISO and then move those files to the CD/DVD.  You can do this with Brasero disk creator, like another answer says.\nSo, when you burned your disk you were putting the ISO on the disk, when you really needed the contents of the ISO on the disk.\n", "Q: How to install Sun Java jdk 6 on Ubuntu? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I install Oracle JDK 6? \n\nThe issue has been posted in various sites, but didn't get any of them working for me.

What things do I have to consider during the installation process?\nThanks for your help.\n\nA: You can't do what you think you could do and it has nothing to do with Windows or Linux if you plan to dual boot.  Something has to control the RAID1 in your case before either OS boots (Win or Linux).  The only case where it would work as described, you would need to have a smart controller where the RAID is handled by the disk controller and not by either OS.\n", "Q: Recording speaker audio using avconv I'm having some problems recording the audio from my speakers using avconv.\nThis is the command I type into the terminal:\navconv -f alsa \\\n       -i pulse -f x11grab -r 30 -s 1920*1080 \\\n       -i :0.0 \\\n       -vcodec libx264 -preset ultrafast \\\n       -ab 320k -threads 8 \\\n       screen.mkv\n\nTHE PROBLEM: avconv is recording the speaker audio and my microphone audio, however the speaker audio is extremely low.

I would like to remove the cheese config file and I have tried searching for the config file in my home directory with\n~ $ find -name '*cheese*'\n\nBut I still can't find it. I am running ubuntu 12.10. \n\nA: In the habit of Gnome applications, Cheese stores its configuration data in the dconf configuration system rather than in plain files.\nTo access that, you could use a GUI program called dconf-editor from the package dconf-tools :\nsudo apt-get install dconf-tools\n\nCheese uses the /apps/cheese /org/gnome/cheese(since 14.04) gconf path:\n\nYou could easily play with the settings (they all typically have well-documented schemata displayed in the bottom of the dconf-editor window), and, ultimately, wipe the  settings clean by resetting the values to defaults (non-defaults are highlighted with bold font as you can see on my screenshot).\n\nBesides dconf-editor, you can also do this from the command line:\ngsettings reset-recursively org.gnome.Cheese:/apps/cheese\nUPD since I don't know when, that gives an error:\n\nSchema “org.gnome.Cheese” is not relocatable (path must not be specified)\n\nWhich simply asks to call it without the /apps/cheese path, like this:\ngsettings reset-recursively org.gnome.Cheese\n\n", "Q: Why am I getting \"Command 'deb' not found\"? I have come across several installation instructions that include the command deb. But it appears that this command is not available on my installation.\nWhere can I get this command? Is there a work-around?\n\nA: This is not the CLI command.\nThis is information about some Debian package repository (used also by Ubuntu).\nIf you want to use this repository:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the file /etc/apt/sources.list with administrator privileges.\n\n*Add to this file a line with information about the repository starting with deb ...\n\n*Save the file.\n\n*Run this command:\napt-get update\nNow you will be able to use this repository.\n\nA: deb is not a unix command. If you have a line like the following (source for docker): \ndeb https://apt.dockerproject.org/repo ubuntu-xenial main\n\nit is a line that must be available in your ubuntu sources.list so that apt-get can find future packages from this new source.\nHowever, it's not a good practice to edit the /etc/apt/sources.list file directly. Instead add the deb line as an entry to a new .list file inside the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ directory. We will create a docker.list file like this:\necho \"deb https://apt.dockerproject.org/repo ubuntu-xenial main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list\n\nOnce done, remember to perform a sudo apt-get update and you should now be able to find new packages from this source easily.\n\nA: Like the answer by @Eric Carvalho deb is not command line If you have deb then url like this:\ndeb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian trusty contrib \n\nEdit \nLike commit of @muru, you need to create new file with the extension .list into /etc/apt/source.list.d/ folder:\nExample:\nI want to download Oracle virtualbox, create new file : \nsudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list.d/oracle-virtualbox-trusty.list \n\nThen copy and paste the line of deb into this file \n\nA: On Ubuntu, you don't have to manually edit the source.list to add the repository.\nInstead, you can use add-apt-repository, as you would do for a PPA.\nFor example, to add the LLVM repository, you can call:\nsudo add-apt-repository 'deb http://apt.llvm.org/trusty/ llvm-toolchain-trusty main'\n\nAs you can see, we must pass the deb line as a single argument to the command.\n\nA: deb is not a command. It is used in /etc/apt/sources.list file to indicate a Debian software repository.\nFrom Ubuntu Manpage - sources.list:\n\nThe source list is designed to support any number of active sources\nand a variety of source media. The file lists one source per line,\nwith the most preferred source listed first. The format of each line\nis: type uri args. The first item, type determines the format for\nargs.  uri is a Universal Resource Identifier (URI), which is a\nsuperset of the more specific and well-known Universal Resource\nLocator, or URL.\nThe deb type describes a typical two-level Debian archive,\ndistribution/component. The format for a sources.list entry using the\ndeb and deb-src types is:\ndeb [ options ] uri distribution [component1] [component2] [...]\n\nThe URI for the deb type must specify the base of the Debian\ndistribution, from which APT will find the information it needs.\ndistribution can specify an exact path, in which case the components\nmust be omitted and distribution must end with a slash (/). This is\nuseful for when the case only a particular sub-section of the archive\ndenoted by the URI is of interest. If distribution does not specify an\nexact path, at least one component must be present.\n\nSo, if I have deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ quantal main restricted in the sources.list file - it says: I have a Debian archive which is based on http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/, the distribution is quantal and the components are main and restricted.\n\nA: Deb isn't actually a command (I thought so too, at first) --  Assuming you are trying to download/install a deb, do this (for example):\nwget http://whatever.com/whatever.deb\nthen dpkg -i whatever.deb\nthen run the commands:\nsudo apt-get update\n\n", "Q: Run conky over LightDM Is it possible to have my conky gadgets run over my lightDM login screen?  If so, how would I go about this?  I saw someone doing it with XDM under debian in this screenshot from a thread on the archlinux forums\n\n\nA: Yes it is.\nThe idea is that you edit your lightdm configuration file (/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf)\nand set the greeter-setup-script variable to start conky.\nA complete example might be found at:\nhttp://vogelchr.blogspot.com.br/2012/11/ligthdm-custom-app-on-login-screen.html\n", "Q: Full disk encryption - separate home partition How to create separate /home partition when using full disk encryption feature in the Ubuntu 12.10 installer?\n\nA: Warning:  Keep in mind what you are doing has to be done right or you may potentially destroy other systems on your hard drive or data on other partitions.  If you are installing to the entire hard drive and want to overwrite the entire disk, no worries.\nWhen you are installing, when you see this screen:\n\nChoose Something else.\nYou will need to create the minimum of two partitions (three if you want a swap).\nCreate one partition for you system and set it's mount point to '/'\nCreate another partition for your home directory and set it's mount point to '/home'\nCreate a swap partition as well if you need one.\nWhen you are asked to encrypt the /home directory, choose that option.\nSee this tutorial before you start this process.

Second, you can mount Lubuntu .iso, although it will be of no use. Wubi isn't the best way of installing Lubuntu (in my point of view it's the worst), you should try installing it in dual boot with Windows, it's just to burn this .iso to a CD/DVD or USB and boot your pc trhough it, then you should choose 'Try Lubuntu without installing', wait to the interface to load and from there you will be able to open GParted and create a partition for Lubuntu after Windows partition, then you just need to install Lubuntu and when prompted choose advanced options to choose the partition you created to Lubuntu and to keep Windows in your pc.\nIf you need, for any reason to use wubi for the installation process you should defragment your disk data, make sure you have at least 3 GB of free space in your disk, update your Windows' softwares, it's recommended that you close any running program in Windows during the installation process, after doing these steps you should be able to install Lubuntu trhough Wubi, although if you don't succed you won't be able to do many things as something into Windows or HDD (such as badblocks) are hampering Wubi performance and preventing the installation of Lubuntu.\n\nA: *\n\n*Get a copy of a Ubuntu distro that does start live.\n\n*Burn and boot it from dvd.\n\n*Pop in Lubuntu disk in other drive.\n\n*Use unsquashfs to copy file system in Lubuntu to your Windows drive.\n\n*Use Chroot to mount Lubuntu file system and start x.  http://www.gentoo-wiki.info/HOWTO_startx_in_a_chroot\nYou will have to research more on step five because it's a Gentoo tutorial (dont see Ubuntu tutorial) but fundamentally similiar concepts most likely needing modifcation to achieve success.

What follows is a rough outline of the package requirements and steps required to complete the installation. \nA complete step-by-step installation guide is beyond the scope of this question. \nRequest Tracker pre-requisites\nThe installation can be accomplished in a number of ways.\nYou will need to install and configure a number of applications before RT will run. I have tried to provide some preliminary sources to assist in getting started. I would strongly recommend reading over this install guide as a reference to get you started. \nYou will need to refer back to this guide to make additional changes to your Apache, mail, and RT services to complete the installation.\n\n\n*\n\n*LAMP server\n\n\n*\n\n*This can be done by running sudo tasksel install lamp-server from the command line.\n\n*See also the Ubuntu LAMP help page.\n\n\n*Mail server \n\n\n*\n\n*Basic Postfix setup\n\n*dovecot configuration - for IMAP and POP3 mail deployment.\n\n*fetchmail is used for pulling mail into the RT ticket queue.\n\n\n*SQL server (MySQL)\n\n\n*\n\n*MySQL server guide - RT does not require much manual configuration of its database beyond assigning a root user, their password, and dB name, but this might be useful for familiarity with your system.\n\n\nMy system preferences are noted above, but there are other backend email and database solutions available that RT could run with as well(i.e. exim, SQlite):\nOnce the above applications have been installed and configured, the packages specific to request-tracker can now be installed. To begin, use the following command from the terminal (Ctrl-Alt-t):  \nsudo apt-get install rt4-apache2 rt4-clients rt4-db-mysql request-tracker4 rt4-extension-assettracker fetchmail\n\nNote that I have updated the package references to reflect the latest RT packages in the 12.04 repository.\nIf you choose to install request-tracker4 via Synaptic, most of the dependencies will be picked up, but you will need to specifically select rt4-db-mysql as the package dependencies install sqlite and exim by default.\nExpect to be prompted to also install a large number(approximately 80-90) of additional packages. During installation the request-tracker4 package will bring up a menu and prompt you on personalizing your initial setup(Web URLs, default email accounts, etc.). \nAfter the apt-get process completes, you will need to refer to the already referenced install guide to modify your apache2 and email configurations for RT-specific requirements.\nRequest Tracker has a very good documentation and wiki support system.

He also claims newer versions of Ubuntu are too much for the WII (RAM seems to be the problem) but in the comments also states downloads for Ubuntu up to Gutsy. Of course you can follow this guide and use one of the newer versions of Ubuntu adjusting the how to as it seems needed.\n\nThis how to is from 2010 and uses a patched kernel and debian (Lenny and Etch) with a custom tar ball.\n\nVideo demo with download link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7DBAZuNusE\n", "Q: why ubuntu uses more battery power? Why ubuntu uses more battery power than windows?  \n\nWhen I use windows, my battery lasts for 2 hours\n  But when I use ubuntu, the battery decreases so quickly. hardly I can use for only 1 hour.  \n\nWhy ubuntu uses more battery?\n\nA: First I recommend you to upgrade to Ubuntu 12.04LTS. To know why Ubuntu uses more battery power you could look into this site.\nYou can improve your battery life by installing Jupiter.\nIt is designed to improve battery life of a portable Linux computer by integrating with the operating system and changing parameters of the computer based on battery or powered connection.\nYou can install Jupiter by typing the following commands.\nOpen a terminal window (alt+ctrl+t) and type\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/jupiter\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install jupiter\ni advise you to check out this \"link\" about Power Saving Tweaks.\nYou can also install powertop which is a Linux tool to find out what is using power on a laptop. you can get it here.\n", "Q: Why are windows going to top left of the screen? Recently I noticed all the new windows are popping up in the top left. This is annoying because the top bar blocks the title bar of the new window. See screenshot of Tunesviewer with Firefox, Tunesviewer can't be moved without alt-drag trick.\n\n\nA: Yeah by-default Ubuntu opens it in the top-left corner of the desktop. You can open it in the centre by doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install CompizConfig Settings Manager from the Ubuntu Software center if the   application is not in your system. You could also install it from the terminal by typing:\nsudo apt-get install compiz compizconfig-settings-manager compiz-fusion-plugins-extra compiz-fusion-plugins-main compiz-plugins\n\n\n*Press Alt+F2 and type ccsm into the box, press Enter to run this program.

There is a community help wiki page on Broadcom wifi devices and a quick search shows that there other users with problems getting Broadcom wifi devices to work on 12.04.\nHope that helps! It did for me. See my post about it. I had very similar issues as you - greyed out \"enable wifi\", etc. In particular my solution (after searching the ubuntu forum, ask ubuntu and community help docs) was to remove the STA drivers using the Ubuntu Software Center, and installed the b43 drivers instead.

Is there a setting for this this?\n\nA: You can add a menu option to the GRUB boot menu which specifies that you want to boot into \"text\" mode. While in the boot menu, select the ubuntu item and hit 'e', then add \"text\" to the end of the line that begins with \"kernel\" (it should span across 2 lines in the emacs like editor GRUB2 has.) Press CTRL+X to boot and you should see it boot without starting an X server or desktop manager. However this is a one off solution, below is the solution to add an option in the menu which does this for you.\nAdding a menu item with these options:\n1) Edit the linux entry to boot to text mode:\nOpen the entry (should be 10_linux in the grub.d menu entries directory) in your preferred text editor as root (mine is gedit as you see here):\nsudo gedit /etc/grub.d/10_linux\n\nAnd search for the definition of this function \"linux_entry ()\", this is the first thing that needs changing. Edit the start of this to look like so:\n...\nlinux_entry ()\n{\n  os=\"$1\"\n  version=\"$2\"\n  recovery=\"$3\"\n  args=\"$4\"\n  if [ \"${recovery}\" = \"text\" ]; then\n    title=\"$(gettext_quoted \"%s, with Linux %s (text mode)\")\"\n  elif ${recovery} ; then\n    title=\"$(gettext_quoted \"%s, with Linux %s (recovery mode)\")\"\n  else\n    title=\"$(gettext_quoted \"%s, with Linux %s\")\"\n  fi\n  printf \"menuentry '${title}' ${CLASS} {\\n\" \"${os}\" \"${version}\"\n  cat << EOF\n        recordfail\nEOF\n  if [ \"${recovery}\" != \"text\" -a ! ${recovery} ] ; then\n      save_default_entry | sed -e \"s/^/\\t/\"\n\n      cat << EOF\n    gfxmode \\$linux_gfx_mode\nEOF\n  fi\n\nThen scroll down to the first call of this function (search for \"linux_entry\") and add the following line:\n#Add this line\nlinux_entry \"${OS}\" \"${version}\" \"text\" \\\n    \"text ${GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX}\"\n\n\n#Above/below this\nlinux_entry \"${OS}\" \"${version}\" false \\\n    \"${GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX} ${GRUB_CMDLINE_EXTRA} ${GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT}\" \\\n    quiet\n\n(Which should be near the end of the file.)\nAdding it will add it to the menu in the order it is shown in the script, here it goes before, just move it to after the preexisting lines and it wont be the default choice.\n2) Update GRUB:\nsudo update-grub\n\n3) Reboot and you should see the new text entry in your menu!\n", "Q: Error in using HTTP through Telnet on terminal To access www.ietf.org/rfc.html, I entered the following commands:\ntelnet www.ietf.org 80 > log\nget /rfc.html HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.ietf.org\n\nWhile I was in the midst of typing the 3rd command, the following message displayed :\nConnection closed by foreign host.\n\nThe log entry was :\n> Trying 64.170.98.30...\nConnected to www.ietf.org.\nEscape character is '^]'.\nHTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\nDate: Thu, 27 Dec 2012 09:32:01 GMT\nServer: Apache/2.2.10 (Linux/SUSE) mod_ssl/2.2.10 OpenSSL/0.9.8h PHP/5.2.13 with     Suhosin-Patch mod_python/3.3.1 Python/2.6 mod_wsgi/3.3 mod_perl/2.0.4 Perl/v5.10.0\nContent-Length: 226\nConnection: close\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\n\n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN\">\n<html><head>\n<title>400 Bad Request</title>\n</head><body>\n<h1>Bad Request</h1>\n<p>Your browser sent a request that this server could not understand.<br />\n</p>\n</body></html>\n\nSo what's the problem?\n\nA: Assuming you are able to retrieve the file with wget as Eric Carvalho suggested (wget www.ietf.org./rfc.html), the problem is likely just that the web server hung up on you because you didn't send your request fast enough.\nEach time a page is retrieved, a separate TCP connection is made to the web server's HTTP port. Once connected, if you don't send a command soon enough, the server will assume that the connection is abandoned (which happens quite often, even though most web browsers minimize it by properly terminating their TCP connections when they're done).\nIf your goal is just to download the page and look at it, you should use wget, curl, or fetch instead of telnet. You can view the file on the command line with cat or less.\nIf your goal is to play around with using telnet to access web content--for example, to enhance your understanding of HTTP--then you might consider writing a program or script (it could even be a shell script) that acts as a simple front-end for telnet by taking the server's name and HTTP commands, and then connects to the server, sending the command(s) quickly thereafter.\n", "Q: Why does wubi fail with a 404 error?

See this page for details. When a release is not supported anymore we call it EoL (end-of-life).\nAt least currently, Wubi cannot automatically download the files needed to install an EoL release. You must provide all the necessary files. (A 404, or File Not Found, error will occur otherwise.)\nTo do this:\nIf you have just Wubi.exe, saved to your hard drive:\nDownload the ISO image for the release. Make sure to get the one for the right architecture. If you have a 64-bit machine you can use the amd64 (64-bit) or i386 (32-bit) version. If you have a 32-bit machine you can only use the i386 version.\nISO images for old releases can be downloaded at http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/.\nSave the ISO image to your hard disk. Then there are three ways you can proceed:\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the downloaded ISO image it's in the same folder that contains Wubi.exe. Then run Wubi.exe again.\n\n\n*Alternatively, if you have an archive manager for Windows like 7-zip that is capable of extracting ISO images as though they are compressed archives (even though they really aren't), you can use that to extract the ISO image into its own folder with nothing else in it. Then find Wubi.exe in that folder (it's one of the files that was extracted) and run that.\n\n\n*If you want, you also have the option of burning the ISO to a CD/DVD or writing it to a USB flash drive. That will work, and on rare occasion might make sense if you're having a lot of trouble getting Wubi to find your downloaded ISO. But generally this way is harder and takes longer.\nIf you're running Wubi.exe from an Ubuntu CD/DVD or USB flash drive that you've burned or written from an Ubuntu ISO:\nWubi only gets to the point where the error occurs after checking to make sure the necessary files for installation aren't already present and usable. So they are either not present, or one or more of them is corrupted.\nEither way, there's two causes: either the ISO is corrupted, or the burn/write was bad (or modified afterwards). You can find out which by MD5 testing the ISO. Then rewrite it to the USB drive, burn it to a new disc, or (if the ISO is what's bad) download the ISO again.\n(And then you can use one of the techniques described above, which are faster than having to make a disc or write to a USB drive.)\nIf you're running Wubi.exe from a virtual drive mounted from an Ubuntu ISO:\nSome programs exist to mount ISO images in Windows as virtual drives. This is a somewhat popular way to install Wubi. If you're doing this and getting the error, then the same problem is happening as above. Since there's no actual physical Ubuntu disk, that means the ISO is bad. (Or that there's some problem with your drive virtualization software.)\nThe Caveat (and better solution, really)\nWhen Ubuntu releases are EoL, you really shouldn't use them. You can't get as good support, the software on them is old, and most importantly, newly discovered bugs are not fixed. That means that there are lots of security bugs that are discovered and fixed only in supported releases. Users of EoL releases remain vulnerable. So it is actually dangerous to continue using an EoL release.\nIf you choose to continue using an EoL release of Ubuntu, we will respect that, but we may not be able to help you with problems (as most of us have moved on), and it's important you understand the disadvantages and risks.\nCurrently supported Ubuntu releases are 10.04.4 LTS, 11.10, 12.04.1 LTS, and 12.10. You can get them all here. Both ISO images and Wubi.exe installers are available for each supported release. This is highly recommended!\nTechnically, 8.04.4 LTS is also supported, but only for limited server use, which doesn't include GUI, community-community packages, or Wubi.\nIf you can't decide which version to use, it's usually best to go for the latest release (as most people do) or the latest LTS release.\nThe Analysis\nThe Traceback (most recent call last) line means this is a crash, which is a type of bug. Therefore, as Jorge Castro says, you should report this as a bug (against the Wubi project on Launchpad).\nHowever, the fundamental problem here would probably not be considered a bug, and you can solve it pretty easily. See above for solutions, or below for an explanation.\nThey key to understanding what's going on lies in the output just before the crash:\n12-27 15:15 DEBUG  CommonBackend: Searching for local ISO\n12-27 15:15 DEBUG  CommonBackend: Could not find any ISO or CD, downloading one now\n12-27 15:15 DEBUG  TaskList: New task get_metalink\n12-27 15:15 DEBUG  TaskList: ### Running get_metalink...\n12-27 15:15 DEBUG  downloader: downloading http://releases.ubuntu.com/11.04/ubuntu-11.04-desktop-amd64.metalink > G:\\ubuntu\\install\n12-27 15:15 DEBUG  downloader: Download start filename=G:\\ubuntu\\install\\ubuntu-11.04-desktop-amd64.metalink, url=http://releases.ubuntu.com/11.04/ubuntu-11.04-desktop-amd64.metalink, basename=ubuntu-11.04-desktop-amd64.metalink, length=28363, text=None\n12-27 15:15 DEBUG  downloader: download finished (read 28363 bytes)\n12-27 15:15 DEBUG  downloader: downloading http://releases.ubuntu.com/11.04/MD5SUMS-metalink > G:\\ubuntu\\install\n12-27 15:15 ERROR  TaskList: [Errno 14] HTTP Error 404: Not Found\n\nFirst, Wubi tries to find an Ubuntu ISO image on your computer. You don't have one--you probably just downloaded Wubi.exe (which is ordinarily a perfectly good thing to do). Then Wubi tries to download the ISO.\nIt connects to the http://releases.ubuntu.com server. But Ubuntu 11.04 is no longer supported--it is an end-of-life release. EoL releases are stored on a different server, accessible at http://old-releases.ubuntu.com. Some data on the releases server will redirect to the old-releases server automatically, but most will not; in particular, trying to download files that are actually part of an old distribution will fail. So Wubi downloads the initial .metalink file successfully but fails to download the first file that's part of Ubuntu 11.04 (which happens to be MD5SUMS-metalink).\nThis also explains why you can solve this by providing the ISO image yourself.\n\nA: If you are using a cd either in physical or virtual cdrom drive.

Windows will have their key in the usual format HAN50-0L00M-4D31T-CR4ZY. 5 letters or numbers in 5 groups.\n$ ls /sys/firmware/acpi/tables\n$ sudo hd /sys/firmware/acpi/tables/MSDM\n\n00000000  ha ns oo lo oe at es ap  pl le sa uc ef or li fe  |Key in area|\n00000010  cu si ca nb ro ha ms am  cu si ca nb ro ha ms am  |In key area|\n00000020  it sj us ho wz ir ol lz  it sj us ho wz ir ol lz  |Area in key|\n00000000  ha ns oo lo oe at es ap  pl le sa uc ef or li fe  |It is 5 x 5|\n00000010  cu si ca nb ro ha ms am  cu si ca nb ro ha ms am  |Key in area|\n00000020  it sj us ho wz ir ol lz  it sj us ho wz ir ol lz  |In key area|\n00000050  ha ns oo lo ow az he re                           |Area in key|\n00000055                                                    |It is 5 x 5|\n\nRunning the following command will dump the product key in its standard Microsoft format.\nsudo hexdump -s 56 -e '\"MSDM key: \" /29 \"%s\\n\"' /sys/firmware/acpi/tables/MSDM\n\n\nA: Another way that doesn't require looking through a ton of output is:\nsudo acpidump -b -t MSDM | dd bs=1 skip=56 2>/dev/null;echo\n\nacpidump dumps the table (default in hexdump format), but the -b options tells it to output the raw data. Since we only need the last part of the table, pipe the output into dd, but but skip the unnecessary junk. Finally, add an echo at the end to make it terminal-friendly =D\nacpidump -t MSDM will work as well, but the key is broken over multiple lines, making it hard to copy.\n\nUpdate thanks to Lekensteyn:\nNew versions of acpidump shipped with Ubuntu work differently than described above. The -b flag causes acpidump to write to a file under all circumstances, so an alternative method is to use the command\nsudo tail -c+57 /sys/firmware/acpi/tables/MSDM\n\n\nA legitimate Windows 8 installer should automatically detect the key in the ACPI and continue installing with the built-in key.\nIt should be noted, however, that I used this method to try to install Win8 in a VM using my own product key, but it automatically deactivated saying that the product key was in use. So, it's of little use in all reality. Since Win8 OEM keys are designed to be tied to that specific computer, you'll hit a brick wall if you ask Microsoft to unregister the key so you can use it in a VM, let alone another computer.\nThe only way you could use the key is if you had never booted into Win8 to begin with or weren't connected to a network when you did. Even so, if your VM/new computer is ever allowed to connect to the network, it will automatically register the key making your actual installation unusable.\n\nA: Usually, OEM manufacturers have preloaded a key electronically on a ROM. Windows will identify this and automatically activate your installation. So, usually, you don't need to know this code. However, you may see some trace of this using\nsudo dmidecode\n\nlisted as OEM-specific Types, encoded/encrypted, which may hold it. Major OEMs like HP and Dell use this. Ask on Windows websites for more details; this is the wrong place. The only detail I remember is that one needs an OEM version of the Windows installation disc (i.e. non-retail).\n\nA:  sudo tail -c+57 /sys/firmware/acpi/tables/MSDM\n\nThis got me the Product Key of my OEM Windows 8 on MSI laptop.\n\nA: so I saw the other answers on here and needed to chime in.\nfound\nstrings /sys/firmware/acpi/tables/MSDM\n\nworks great if the original key is what is still being used.

What is the command update-alternatives used for?\nTake this example:\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /usr/local/java/jre1.7.0_09/bin/java 1\n\nWhat does it do? How is it different from adding jdk to the path?\nLet's say that I have run the command. How would I revert back to the original state?\n\nA: While @gertvdjik's answer is a good explanation of how alternatives work at the lower level, it doesn't explicitly say how to revert the original state.\nI find it easier to use the corresponding GUI galternatives which is available as a package. To install it, just run:\nsudo apt-get install galternatives\n\nThen managing alternatives becomes much easier. For java in particular, you have a lot of auxiliary binaries which you'll have to update and it's faster to overview them in the GUI.\n\nA: It updates the links in /etc/alternatives to point to the program for this purpose. There's lots of examples, like x-www-browser, editor, etc. that will link to the browser or editor of your preference. Some scripts or system tools may want you to edit a file manually (e.g. configuration conflict in dpkg) and they'll look into the alternatives to give you the editor of choice. For java, this is the Java runtime environment - Oracle's, OpenJRE, etc.\nThe links in /etc/alternatives are just symbolic links. You can see them using for example\nls -l /etc/alternatives\n\nMoreover, the regular /usr/bin binaries are also symlinks. E.g.:\nls -l /usr/bin/java\n  lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 22 Aug 14 10:33 /usr/bin/java -> /etc/alternatives/java\nls -l /etc/alternatives/java\n  lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 46 Aug 14 10:33 /etc/alternatives/java -> /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java\n\nSo, no PATH has to be modified. It just uses symbolic links.\n\nA: And update-alternatives can create a group to switch easily. For example javaw, java and javac needs to go together if java switches. Then javaw and javac should be installed as slaves of java.\nOr oc and kubectl (openshift client and kubernetes control) should go together, too. I have installed oc v3 and v4, and each version goes with its own kubectl. So I do:\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/oc oc /opt/oc3/oc 2 --slave /usr/bin/kubectl kubectl /opt/oc3/kubectl\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/oc oc /opt/oc4/oc 1 --slave /usr/bin/kubectl kubectl /opt/oc4/kubectl\n\nSo oc3 and its kubectl are prioritized.\n", "Q: How to purge psmouse-alps-dst-0.4 driver?

I use multiple domains and also multiple subdomains. I would have to add a line for each combination.\nI have read that a DNS forwarder like DNSmasq can be used to do the job (for example as described here). Also this software is already installed on Ubuntu 12.10.\nThe problem is that I fail to see how and where I should configure DNSmasq, i.e., where I should put this line:\naddress=/dev/127.0.0.1\n\n\nA: In Ubuntu 12.10 or later you can do this with dnsmasq as run by NetworkManager.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create the directory mkdir /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d if it doesn't already exist.\nsudo mkdir /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d\n\n\n*Toss the following line into /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/dev-tld.\naddress=/dev/127.0.0.1\n\n\n*(Ubuntu 12.10) Restart NetworkManager.\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\n\n*(Ubuntu > 13.04) Restart Dnsmasq.\nsudo service dnsmasq restart\n\n\n*Enjoy the awesomeness.\n\n\n\nA: Just installed a fresh 19.04 and the only way I got it working was disabling systemd-resolved and have NetworkManager use dnsmasq instead for DNS.

I would not use *.dev anymore but instead one of the reserved top level domains.\nSolution\n\n*\n\n*Disable systemd-resolved\n sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved.service\n sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved.service\n sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf\n\n\n\n*Edit /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf to use dnsmasq for DNS.\n [main]\n dns=dnsmasq\n\n\n\n*Put dnsmasq configuration in /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/test-tld.conf\n address=/test/127.0.0.1\n address=/customerX.test/192.168.33.10\n\n\n\n*and finally restart NetworkManager which will generate a new /etc/resolv.conf\n sudo systemctl restart network-manager.service\n\n\nA: The complete standalone dnsmasq (DHCP and DNS server) is not installed by default in Ubuntu 12.04 and 12.10, but a package called dnsmasq-base is installed by default in Ubuntu Desktop 12.04 and 12.10. The dnsmasq-base package contains the dnsmasq binary and is used by NetworkManager.\nTo do what you want you will need to use dnsmasq as a caching DNS server. You need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install dnsmasq\nsudo apt-get install dnsmasq\n\n*Change your network setting, so that your computer uses itself as it dns server.\n\n*Make the changes to the config files:\n\n\nCreate /etc/dnsmasq.d/dev-tld with these contents:\nlocal=/dev/\n\naddress=/dev/127.0.0.5\n\nThe first command says *.dev requests can't be forwarded to your real DNS server. The second says *.dev resolves to 127.0.0.5 which is localhost.\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart the dnsmasq service (not network-manager)\n\n\nA: The following worked worked for me in Ubuntu 16.04:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install dnsmasq\nsudo apt-get -y install dnsmasq\n\n\n*Edit dnsmasq.conf file:\nsudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf\n\n\n*Add your command:\naddress=/dev/127.0.0.1\n\nFor wild card (*) then you can use dot (.) then dnsmasq to resolve \nWHATEWER_YOU_PUT_HERE.yourmachine.yourdomain to the same ip.

After increasing the height of the xfce-panel I noticed, that the icons of the window buttons remained small. Because this looks stupid and makes recognizing the icons harder than it has to be I want to increase the icon size of the window buttons of my xfce4-panel. I am running Linux Mint 14 Xfce, but this should affect everyone running Xfce 4.10.\nThe xfce docs tell me that I \"can set a custom icon size in gtk-icon-sizes with the name panel-tasklist-menu. The default icon size is 16px\". -- Source.\nAs far as I can tell this can be done in a few different ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using the graphical Settings Editor to customize the settings stored by Xfconf to add in the xsettings the Property IconSizes panel-tasklist-menu=32,32 (Or maybe just panel-tasklist-menu=32)\n\n*Editing ~/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/xsettings.xml directly, doing basically the same thing\n\n*Adding gtk-icon-sizes=\"panel-tasklist-menu=32,32\" to ~/.gtkrc-2.0\n\n*Adding this to the gtkrc of my theme (/usr/share/themes/Mint-X/gtk-2.0/gtkrc)\nAs you can guess nothing worked. Now after a while of blind trial&error trying to guess the correct way to define the icon size, I surrender. I was able to change the size of pretty much all the other icons on the panel, but still the size of the window button icons eludes me.\nHas anyone an idea how I can increase the icon size of the xfce4-panel window buttons? Or should I send a bug report?\n\nA: If you mean the Window Buttons panel plugin, then what you describe seems to be the behaviour when you have Show button labels enabled in the plugin Properties. This certainly sounds like a bug and you can report it on Xfce's Bugzilla.\nYou can improve the icon display if you uncheck that option, which will result in a Windows 7-like look of the tasklist (which I find more useful and easy to use). In this config, the icons are scaled appropriately.\n", "Q: How can I list all files and folders beyond a specified size limit?

If I install Ubuntu dual-boot on laptop that has recovery partition will it become useless the recovery option provided by the BIOS and accessibility of recovery partition?\n\nA: Yes it may become useless if you install GRUB at the beginning of your hard disk (master boot record).  (At least for my case, on a Dell XPS 15). The master boot record is the normal place for GRUB to be installed; Ubuntu's installer will almost always pick the MBR if you allow it to automatically choose. Sometimes, when GRUB's boot entries are created,  it may detect your recovery partition as bootable, and create a menu entry for it, allow you to select it and enter it to perform (or attempt) recovery.\nIf install GRUB into some other partition and use windows boot loader to load ubuntu, possibly you won't loose access to the recovery. (I am not very sure as I don't know how the recovery button is implemented. It does vary manufacture to manufacture)\nA bit advanced thing:\nA windows recovery is nothing but a .wim file. You can assign a drive letter and open it to copy the wim image for backup. Later point of time you can apply the wim image from a bootable disk with winPE. Which is very easy.\nBest option: Generally the preinstalled windows systems come with a special software that can create a recovery disc (DVD/USB). You can use these disc for recovery instead of the image in recovery partitoin.\nWhatever you do first create recovery disc and/or copy the wim image somewhere else.\n\nA: My recovery partition worked for me, even after I installed Ubuntu. My situation was similar to yours, so I think your recovery partition will probably work as well.\nI have eMachines eM355 that comes by default with Win7 and a recovery partition. During last three months of usage (Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS) I saw no problems. I even used Recovery partition for another install of Win7 because I got some nasty Trojan. Everything went fine. And even more, I don't really use Windows at all lately.\nI'm just a newbie as I suppose you are, so maybe I'm missing something.

Im' thinking about formatting my HD and reinstalling with Ubuntu instead. However I'm concerned about losing internet access. I currently use XP and connect to the net via a router which I can access by typing its IP address into my browser. Will there be any compatibility issues with Ubuntu doing the same? Do i need an ubuntu compatible router or something, or any special software to setup internet access using Ubuntu?\n\nA: Other answers have addressed your options while installing and the issue of Ubuntu accessing the Internet. The key points are that it's a good idea to test Ubuntu first on the live CD/DVD/USB (same as what you use to install from), and that your options are explained in various resources that explain how to install it, like this.\nI'd like to address the question about whether or not you can connect to your router's setup page and configure it, from Ubuntu.\nYes.\nYou can access your router's setup page. You do not need a special, compatible router.\nThis is just a web page--the router is itself a machine on your network, and it is running a web server. Any machine that can browse the web can access this.\nSome devices are configured by plugging them into a computer with a USB cable. Often Windows-only software is necessary to perform this configuration, and this is usually not possible with Ubuntu. Some routers provide this as one way to configure them. But even if your router has a USB port, you don't have to use that to configure it.\nIf your router lets you connect to it in a web browser on Windows, you can do the same thing in Ubuntu.\nIt's possible to design a web page that can only be used by clients on certain operating systems. But routers don't have that sort of client-side active content. Their setup pages are relatively simple, as web pages go. The authentication that is performed is done through universal web protocols. You're good.\nYou should be aware, though, that being able to connect to the router is not actually the same thing as being able to connect to the Internet through it.\nWhen you access the Internet through your router, your router's web-based setup page is not actually being used. You can use it to change settings that affect (or even disable and enable) your Internet connection. But when you open a web page other than your router's setup page (and I'm specifically thinking of page whose web server is in a remote location on the Internet), or update Ubuntu, or use instant messaging or bittorrent, or play an online game... the data that's transmitted and received does not go through the router's web page. It goes through the router, but the web page is just there for configuration.\n\nA: Ubuntu, does not, usually have problems related to internet access, unless something is broken during installation or afterwards. And yes, please refer to this guide before you proceed with the installation. You should be able to access internet without purchasing a new router or any other special software, the drivers and applications are loaded into the default iso image. Hope this helps; post, if you have any problems.\n\nA: you don't have to format your drive before trying to install Ubuntu, you can even just try Ubuntu without installing or removing anything thus you can check if everything is working. I recommend the following installation guide: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/install-desktop-long-term-support\nIf you can't access the internet when trying Ubuntu then you can search for answers to the problem(s) you encounter or edit your question explaining the details and hopefully you will be helped.\n\nA: Only problem I had with Internet access was with Nokia USB Modem for GSM connection. That was because it has memory slot in it which is mounted first (like Windows usually do). Everything I had to do was to unmount Nokia USB Modem and then it starts to act like a modem.\nAny change You need to do for internet access is situated under menu connection settings (little icon of network type in upper right corner). That's the easiest way of managing that.\n\nA: I have put ubuntu on about 10 different desktop's and laptop's. i have only had a problem with wireless after install once. The answer was to connect with an ethernet cord to the router itself and install the restricted drivers. similar to when you have to install the drivers for video cards. it should pop up in the upper right corner after install and ethernet connection. hope this is useful to you.\n", "Q: How can I disable the DNS that Network Manager uses? Ubuntu uses a DNSMasq instance for Network Manager starting in 12.04 - how can I disable it?\n\nA: Edit /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf with the following command:\ngksu gedit /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf\nEnter in your password when prompted.\nComment out the line dns=dnsmasq, so it looks like this:\n#dns=dnsmasq\n\nand then restart Network Manager with \nsudo restart network-manager\n# if you get /com/ubuntu/upstart: Connection refused, try:\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\nTa-da! You're all set!\n\nA: If this still does not work for you, like was my case with Ubuntu 16.10.\nThen check who is using this port with:\nlsof -i :53\n\nAnd if you for example have \"systemd-r\", then you have to stop the service with:\nsudo service systemd-resolved stop\n\n\nA: I also had this problem, but I'm on Ubuntu 16.04, so the original solution did not work. However, this page had the solution.\nAdd DNSStubListener=no in /etc/systemd/resolved.conf and then restart the systemd-resolved service. Now, the built-in dnsmasq should not start automatically. \nYou will also need to make sure that dns=dnsmasq is commented out in /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf, like the previous answer specifies.\n", "Q: Capture moving images with multiple webcams I am trying to capture images when there is any movement involved using 2 webcams, each one pointing at different angles. I started to try motion but I am starting to believe is only for a single webcam. Is it for multiple? and if not, what other terminal or GUI app is there to capture only when movement is involved from 2 or more webcams?\n\nA: Trying out the suggestion from AbrahamVanHelpsing was good. Zoneminder which already comes in Ubuntu did work but after several minutes of configuration it was set up. Bad thing is, it did not detect one of the webcams, it only threw a black screen when probing it. Anyway it is recommended to use this one as it is more robust that motion.\nInstall it with sudo apt-get install zoneminder. Configuration information is in their website.\nBut after messing around with it I went back to motion because I felt it was strange that a app called MOTION did not have an option for multiple webcams. I was right.\nJust in case, to install motion is as easy as sudo apt-get install motion\nNow in the /etc/motion/motion.conf file the LAST options are for multiple webcams:\n##############################################################\n# Thread config files - One for each camera.\n# Except if only one camera - You only need this config file.\n# If you have more than one camera you MUST define one thread\n# config file for each camera in addition to this config file.\n##############################################################\n\n# Remember: If you have more than one camera you must have one\n# thread file for each camera. E.g. 2 cameras requires 3 files:\n# This motion.conf file AND thread1.conf and thread2.conf.\n# Only put the options that are unique to each camera in the\n# thread config files. \n; thread /usr/local/etc/thread1.conf\n; thread /usr/local/etc/thread2.conf    \n; thread /usr/local/etc/thread3.conf\n; thread /usr/local/etc/thread4.conf\n\nSo I edited the last lines so it looked like this:\nthread /etc/motion/thread1.conf\nthread /etc/motion/thread2.conf\n; thread /usr/local/etc/thread3.conf\n; thread /usr/local/etc/thread4.conf\n\nNote that I changed the folder location since there is no thread.conf files in /usr/local/etc. They are found in the same place as motion.conf.\nAfter that I had to go to each thread.conf file and change it to what I needed. There are 3 options that should be edited:\nvideodevice - Should be set to the /dev your webcam is using. To find out simply type find /dev -name video* in the terminal. It should show you the webcams you have. In my case it was video0 and video1.\ninput - This should be set to 8 if you are going to use a webcam, else use 1 if you are using a TV Card.\ntarget_dir - It should be set to where you want the captured images to go.\nLastly all other options are in the motion.conf file like web server, amount of capture images when movement is detected, etc..\nAfter that run motion with sudo sudo motion to start capturing.\n", "Q: How do I run update_java_home.sh? The following is an extract of an instruction manual:\nIf Java is reconfigured after SAV for Linux has already been installed, the JAVA_HOME value in /etc/Symantec.conf must be updated.\nThis can be done manually, or automatically by running /opt/Symantec/symantec_antivirus/update_java_home.sh\n\nHow do I run update_java_home.sh? What specific commands must I issue?\nWhat does the file extension .sh mean?\nI am new to Linux and Ubuntu and would welcome detailed instructions on how to run update_java_home.sh\n\nA: .sh is an extension for a shell script. A shell script is a file that is executed directly run by the \"shell\". For example, a .c file is compiled by the C compiler like gcc, Turbo C, etc. Similarly there are shells like bash, Bourne shell, etc which are also called as command-line interpreters which execute this .sh file.\nSo, in order to run a .sh file, you can try any of the following at the terminal (the command-line interface) by first going to the directory in which the file is located:\n1) For executing using a particular shell:\nbash filename.sh\nwhich is in your case:\nbash update_java_home.sh\nIf you have installed Ubuntu, you should have bash by default.\n2) For executing using the default shell:\nchmod +x filename.sh\nwhich is in your case\nchmod +x update_java_home.sh\nHere, chmod is a command to change the file permissions. +x gives executable rights to the user logged in, if permissible, upon the file given as filename.sh\nand then\n./filename.sh\nHere, a . indicates the path is the current directory and asks the shell to execute the file gives as filename.\nThese are perhaps the most common methods used to execute shell scripts. There may be other methods too.\n\nA: Open a terminal and do the following.\nTo mark the file executable if it isn't already\nchmod +x /opt/Symantec/symantec_antivirus/update_java_home.sh\nthen simply:\n/opt/Symantec/symantec_antivirus/update_java_home.sh\n\nA: The file extension .sh means it is a shell script. If you dont know what a shell is you can read about it here. Any shell script file can be executed by typing its path (complete or relative) in shell and pressing enter:\nadnan@laptop:~/>/some/path/script_name.sh\nadnan@laptop:/some/path/>./script_name.sh\n\nIn your case the error is giving you complete path to the file update_java_home.sh. So just open Bash and write the following line\n/opt/Symantec/symantec_antivirus/update_java_home.sh\n\n", "Q: problem with PDF file and Document Viewer I downloaded this file from IEEE website using my institute subscription, \nhttp://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx5/4629386/6365209/06042853.pdf?tp=&arnumber=6042853&isnumber=6365209\nmy Document Viewer version 3.6.0 terminates every time I cross page number 4, any help or reason why this happens?\nI tried changing the extensions to odt and doc, LibOffice draw opens the files, but they aren't clear,\n\nA: Option 1\nOpen Ubuntu Software Center and search for PDF reader. There are quite a number of them you can try them one at a time and see if any of them can read the file. If not you can uninstall them using Ubuntu Software Center.\nOption 2\nYou can download Adobe Reader from Their official website.

Make sure you use units of sectors when partitioning.  You put fdisk into sector mode with the u command, and parted with the unit s command.  Make sure to recreate the partition with the same starting sector, and enough length to cover the size you shrank the filesystem to with resize2fs.  Round up to avoid making it too small.\n", "Q: Does dm-crypt have a GUI for creating encrypted containers? On Windows, I would always use TrueCrypt to perform full-disk-encryption and to create encrypted containers that I can put files in. \nOn 12.10, ubuntu uses dm-crypt to perform full-disk-encryption. I've read online that dm-crypt can also be used to create encrypted containers. I'm interested in using dm-crypt to create encrypted containers on ubuntu. Does dm-crypt use a GUI for this (noob friendly interface)? Or is dm-crypt CLI? I've tried looking for dm-crypt in Synaptic, Dash, BASH: man dm-crypt. But nothing shows up.

I have a Samsung Np900X4C which came with Windows 8 installed.\nMy goal is to have a dual-boot setup. I followed pretty much the answer at Samsung series 9 np900x4c-a03us Dual boot windows 7, namely:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disabled secured boot in BIOS\n\n*Changed \"OS mode selection\" to CSM OS*\n\n*Booted from the USB and installed Ubuntu 12.10\n\n\n*- with UEFI + CSM OS I got some kernel panic errors while booting from the USB\nThe problem - I can only dual boot if I change the boot type in the BIOS:\n\n\n*\n\n*With CSM only I get the Grub options and I can boot in Ubuntu. If I select the Windows 8 option I get a windows error message** and can't boot.\n\n*With CSM + UEFI OS or UEFI only I boot straight into Windows 8\n\n\n**- windows boot manager - Windows failed to start(...). The boot configuration data for your PC is missing or contains errors.\nIt seems like I have the traditional grub installed and UEFI boot installed and I can't have both working simultaneously.\nHow can I correct this dual-boot setup? If I did install Ubuntu on legacy BIOS and shouldn't have, how do I correct that?\n\nA: You did install Ubuntu using the BIOS/legacy boot option -- that's what \"CSM\" is. (This acronym expands to \"Compatibility Support Module,\" which is EFI-speak for BIOS compatibility mode.) Thus, setting the \"OS mode selection\" in your firmware to \"CSM\" for the installation essentially tells your computer to boot only in BIOS/legacy mode.\nThere are a number of possible solutions. These include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install my rEFInd boot manager in Windows. Edit the refind.conf file: Uncomment the scanfor line and add hdbios to its options. When you reboot, rEFInd should come up and show at least two boot options. One should boot Windows and the other should start up GRUB in BIOS mode, which should in turn launch Linux. If you try this and want to experiment more, you could try tweaking the configuration to boot Linux directly in EFI mode.\n\n*Convert your existing Ubuntu installation to boot in EFI mode by adding a suitable EFI-mode boot loader. rEFInd can serve this purpose, or you could install ELILO or the EFI version of GRUB 2. The trick is registering the EFI boot loader with the firmware, which requires an EFI-mode boot of Linux or doing the work from Windows. (The preceding option does this for rEFInd by doing the work in Windows.) See my EFI Boot Loaders for Linux site for more on your options on this score. This approach has a fairly steep learning curve, but it's a fairly clean approach. There's the caveat about EFI-mode boots possibly having problems on your system, though. \n\n*Re-install Ubuntu in EFI mode. This will require overcoming your kernel panic problem, though, and I don't have any specific suggestions on doing that. Perhaps adding (or removing) a kernel option would do the trick, or switching to another kernel version (but this is awkward for an installer's kernel).\n\n\nOverall, I'd say your easiest course of action is to install rEFInd. It will probably enable you to boot Linux in EFI mode, and it provides a path to experiment with EFI-mode booting if you decide to pursue that.\n\nA: I reluctantly decided to follow the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI:\n\nIf the PC does not load Ubuntu (but instead loads Windows, for example, as in Bug #1050940), or if the Windows entry in the GRUB 2 menu does not boot Windows (see Bug #1024383), boot your PC using the Live CD/DVD or Live USB and choose \"Try Ubuntu\" once again. When the live session has loaded, run Boot-Repair (see link for details). When Boot-Repair loads, click on the \"Recommended repair\" button, and write on a paper the URL (paste.ubuntu.com/XXXXXX/) that will appear. \n\nThis reinstalled grub and apparently it installed it in UEFI mode, so I can now dual-boot as expected.\nIn short:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot-repair as per the documentation\n\n*Changed boot OS mode to \"UEFI OS\" in BIOS\n\n*Dual boot works\n\n\nI did notice that the first time I tried to boot in Ubuntu it stopped in a black screen. I restarted and chose \"advanced Ubuntu\" (or something similar), chose the latest kernel option from there and it booted normally. After that, the first \"ubuntu\" option in Grub started booting Linux normally.\n\nA: You need to not load the samsung_laptop kernel module.\nThis module in efi mode does not work as it goes and write to parts of memory making the kernel throw a check exception and panic.\nHave the same issue with arch. But then you lose the keyboard backlight.\nImho if you need that you will have to reinstall both windows and ubuntu in bios mode.\n", "Q: When a Bluetooth audio device auto-connects volume settings won't work until I manually select it I have an Asus UX32VD running 12.10 and for audio I'm using a Big Jambox. They're paired and connect quickly every time. It also correctly directs audio to the Jambox every time it connects.\nThe problem is that when the Jambox connects the volume keys and volume control indicator applet don't work. When I open the volume control app after the Jambox connects it is unselected (despite playing the audio already). Once I select it then the volume control works as it should.\nThis wouldn't be a problem were it for but one thing - it defaults to max volume. Which is a problem with a Big Jambox.\nSo the question is how do I get the volume control app to accurately reflect what the system is already doing?\n\nA: You could add load-module module-switch-on-connect to your file /etc/pulse/default.pa\nOn my Ubuntu 12.04 system, I added this line before the lines that set the volume restore:\nload-module module-switch-on-connect\n\n### Automatically restore the volume of streams and devices\nload-module module-device-restore\nload-module module-stream-restore\nload-module module-card-restore\n\nWhen this takes effect, (pulseaudio -k to restart), I can connect to a bluetooth audio sink, and the audio stream switches to the right output and the volume keys directly trigger on the bluetooth sink.\n", "Q: Gnome-Terminal reports $TERM to be `xterm` On a clean install of Ubuntu 12.10, the default gnome-terminal is reporting $TERM to be xterm where it should really be reporting xterm-256color. What is the best way of changing this? I'm avoiding putting this in my .bashrc as that's just asking for trouble.\n\nA: While it's true that terminfo has xterm+256color (/usr/share/terminfo/x/xterm+256color), termcap has just xterm (/usr/share/vte/termcap/xterm), so changing $TERM shouldn't be advisable.\nAnyhow, $TERM is not set by gnome-terminal, but by vte. The default value for that environment variable can be changed either at compile time (giving an option to the configure script) or by calling the vte_pty_set_term() function. Looking at the sources of gnome-terminal, I see that vte_pty_set_term gets never called, so I can say that there are no ways to modify $TERM by editing gnome-terminal's settings.\nWhat you have to do is to place the following piece of code in your ~/.profile:\nif [ \"$TERM\" = \"xterm\" ]\nthen\n    export TERM=xterm-256color\nfi\n\n\nA: You were well advised not to change your startup scripts, specially ~/.bashrc. Any \"terminal detection\" using current $TERM or $COLORTERM in ~/.profile is merely a guess, and may, as you said, cause trouble when using other terminals (say, Putty or xterm). The terminal emulator is supposed to set $TERM, and this should not  be changed from within the shell.\nGnome terminal, AFAIK, does not offer a configuration to change its TERM, but it does allow you to change your startup command, and that's all you need. Here is the trick:\nProfile Preferences => Title and Command => Run a custom command instead of my shell\n\nThen use the following command:\nenv TERM=xterm-256color /bin/bash\n\nJust replace /bin/bash with your preferred shell if it's different. And no, you can't use \"$SHELL\" in that line for shell auto-detection ;) You have to hard-code it\n\nA: For connecting with a terminal that's not able to do 256 colors.\nIt'd be far better to detect the terminal specifically with $COLORTERM. Look for gnome-terminal, xfce4-terminal, etc, and then set the $TERM variable to xterm-256color. \nI do it with: \nif [ \"$COLORTERM\" = \"gnome-terminal\" ] || [ \"$COLORTERM\" = \"xfce4-terminal\" ]\nthen\n    export TERM=xterm-256color\nelif [ \"$COLORTERM\" = \"rxvt-xpm\" ]\nthen\n    export TERM=rxvt-256color\nfi\n\n", "Q: \"Cannot access secondary GPU\" error on a Lenovo y580 I've laptop with nvidia optimus technology.

I was copying a ISO from my PC, accidently closed the window, and now the progress windows is away. How can I bring it back?\n\nA: When you close the browsing window and the progress window closes:\nThere are four major possibilities (and it varies from file manager to file manager).\n\n*\n\n*The copy operation could simply have finished on its own at around the same time you closed the the file browsing window. If you think this might be what happened, you can compare the target files of the copy to the source files you copied from.\n\n\n*You could be using a file browser that is written to cancel copy operations when the parent browsing window closes. This is not a very good design, and I'm not sure there are many file managers that (intentionally) do this anymore. Nautilus, the default file manager in Ubuntu, is not written to do this.\nIf that happens, then the copy operation has cancelled (see below).\n\n\n*The file browser could have crashed. \"Stable\" software is not supposed to crash but sometimes it happens.\nAs before, if that happens, the copying stopped. Furthermore, in this case, it's even more likely than usual that there is a partially written file at the target, usually smaller than the file at the source to which it corresponds.\n\n\n*It's worth checking to make sure the progress window is actually gone. You can Alt+Tab through all the open windows to make sure it's not hidden behind anything (as sometimes they do not have their own entries in window lists). You can make sure to check each desktop workspace for it.\nWhen you close the progress window itself (or it's otherwise closed before finishing):\nWhen you copy a file in a file browser such as Nautilus, closing the progress window itself terminates the file transfer. If that happened, or the progress window was closed due to any of the above reasons except the copy operation actually having completed, most file browsers (including Nautilus) don't support resuming cancelled transfers. In this situation, you have to start over. (And if it's a single file, it will not be able to benefit from any of the progress that occurred before cancellation.)\nStarting over is relatively simple and easy to do when you are copying a single file, as you've described.\nWhen you are copying multiple files and cancel the copy operation, you may be prompted multiple times about what to do when files that were already copied (or partially copied) are encountered again at the destination.\nWhen you are not copying but moving multiple files, it is from one volume to another, and you cancel the move operation, it's usually pretty simple to just do it over again. Typically only one file will be in both places; the rest will typically copy into the directory tree without doing any harm.\nWith that said, whatever your situation, make sure to look closely at any dialogs that prompt to you to decide how to resolve a \"collision,\" before choosing an option.\n", "Q: Why am I seeing \"freezing tabs\" in Chrome after upgrading to Ubuntu 12.04? I just upgraded my system to Ubuntu 12.04 on Fri., everything works great but Chrome is giving me issues with most pages.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/pusx6.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ZEERk.png\nAs you can see the graphics in that tab are frozen sort of. If I switch tabs after loading the page and go back to that tab then it looks fine. But for instance on FB if I scroll down and play with any menu item or the advisory icons at the top, it won't popup. I have to switch screens and come back and it then comes up that menu item.\nChrome version is 23.0.1271.97. I can't figure out if this is an issue with the latest Chrome and how to fix or if this is an XFCE problem or Graphics card problem.\nI can play games just fine so I don't think it's that. I do remember that in Gnome before switching over to XFCE under the new Ubuntu I had window cutting problems while dragging windows over the desktop. But XFCE doesn't have this problem.\nAlso if I open any of the pages I have problems with in FF I don't have these same problems.\n\nA: After a lot of investigating, re-installing Chrome, purging options, etc. I found the problem is caused by the internal flash of Chrome in the latest release. Very easy to fix.\nFirst off go to the URL bar and enter about:plugins and press enter. This will bring up the plugins screen. Once there click on the plus icon next to Details to display all plugin details.\nScroll down till you find Adobe Flash Player, it should say 2 files, meaning you have Flash player installed separately in the system. Either way find the first one in the list libpepflashplayer.so and disable this one. If there is a second one /usr/lib/adobe-flashplugin/libflashplayer.so do NOT disable the second one.\n\nOnce done you can go to:\nhttp://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/\nAnd install the latest version of flash for your system, in this case the page will tell you to download Flash for Firefox if you have it installed, yes this is what you want.\nDownload and install, in my case I already had Flash installed for FF so it worked immediately no need to install anything else.\nOnce done, restart Chrome and it works perfectly. Something seems to be wrong with flash for Chrome in the most recent build, so gonna have to leave it off until they fix it.\n\nA: \nWhat I tried:\nDisabled all Extensions\nDisabled all Plugins\nCleaned the browser and all private data (cache!)\nNothing worked.\n\nI exported all my bookmarks (more then 4000!)\nand deleted them in Chrome.\nNOW THERE WAS NO MORE FREEZING!\nI imported the bookmarks back and I now try to keep the list short so there is no scrolling and the freezing almost stopped (only freezing when the list is too long).\n", "Q: grep command not returning all results I am running the following command but not all files that I know have this string are being returned and I cannot work out why.

I generated a brand new (reformatted) USB Key to boot on Ubuntu.\nI generated the USB Key using the internet procedure accessing it from a Windows 7 PC with Google Chrome.\nI generated the USB KEY successfully.\nNow I insert my USB KEY, called PENDRIVE (F:/) automatically, in my other laptop (installed on Ubuntu 8, but I can not just upgrade since the internet connection does not seem to work). Unfortunately my computer I want to re-install on the new Ubuntu has not the possibility to boot on the USB port (if I click on F12 I have 3 options: HDD, DVD, external disk), therefore it boots on Ubuntu 8. No pb, I can try to reboot after. But when I enter the USB KEY, the system detects it is a bootable key, and requests if I want it to autorun. I answer Yes, of course, and it says \"Can not find autorun.exe\" \nIf I look in the key, there is file called wubi.exe, but it seems the system does not identify it.\n\nA: You can create a PLOP - CD that allows you to boot from USB even if your Bios doesn't support it. Here is some more information.\nWubi.exe supports to run Ubuntu after Windows has already been booted. As the comments say, that is probably not what you really want and I assume you did try this as a secondary solution.\n\nA: as suggested I would think the external disk option in the bios could be the option to boot from the usb drive. If this does not work you could burn the iso image to a cd or dvd and boot from dvd. \n", "Q: How do I get 10.04 to load with rEFIt?

The desktop version is reaching end-of-life status in just four months, according to the Ubuntu releases page. IMHO, unless you've got a compelling reason for using it, you're better off using 12.04 or 12.10. In fact, 12.10 has a pretty compelling advantage because it ships with a post-3.3.0 kernel, which means that it can boot in EFI mode without the help of a separate boot loader.\nSecond, the instructions to which you linked seem to describe setting Ubuntu up to boot in BIOS mode. Although this is the traditional way to do it, it's got a lot of drawbacks. IMHO, if your system works properly booting Linux in EFI mode, that's a better way to do it. OTOH, since you've also got Windows XP booting in BIOS mode, you'll get less benefit from booting Linux in EFI mode than you would on a two-OS (Linux and OS X) installation.\nMy suspicion is that you've got problems because of your BIOS-mode GRUB installation. You don't seem to have a BIOS Boot Partition, which helps out with GRUB. You may need to create such a partition and re-install GRUB. This will likely disrupt your hybrid MBR setup, though, so be prepared to re-create it with gptsync or gdisk.\nAlternatively, you could convert your system to boot in EFI mode. My Web page on the topic describes how. You've already done most of what's described there, so you should be able to pick up with \"Fixing the Installation\" (or even a good chunk of the way through it -- say, step #13).\n", "Q: Blank Screen upon boot, but no GRUB menu!

It worked on everyother computer. \n\nA: When I first tried to get into the GRUB menu on my computer, I found holding shift down as soon as the computer was powered and holding it usually opened the GRUB menu. Have you plugged the USB into another computer and checked it for errors?  It is also possible that the boot sequence is wrong, or there was an error when you updated the BIOS. try going into the boot menu, not the BIOS, when you turn your computer on (probably by holding F5) and see if it says boot from USB.  \n\nA: If your bios is legacy boot mode just check if ubuntu could start in Uefi boot mode.

Since, your windows has crashed, it won't be possible to shut it down. To manually mount it as a read only file-system type the following on the terminal in ubuntu:\nsudo mount -r <your windows partition on the device> <mount-path>\nin your case, to find out the windows partition, if you don't know what it might be, type\nsudo fdisk -l on the terminal. You can make out if you remember the size of the windows partition, it should be of type NTFS. If you have gparted installed in ubuntu, you also see the partitions as below:\n\nAnd the mount path is usually /media/user where user is your user-name\nFor example, if you know your windows partition is on /dev/sda2 and want to mount it on /media/user, just type this on the terminal:\nsudo mount -r /dev/sda2 /media/user.\nThis will mount the file system, then go to the folder where it got mounted, and then you can copy the folder you want to by cp -r <source> <destination>\n\nA: Actually you don't have to install Ubuntu to access directory on disc. Ubuntu installation DVD can act as Live CD as well (Try Ubuntu option). \nAfter you start Ubuntu as Live CD, open Nautilus and look for the discs/partitions available in the system.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 Battery monitor problem? With win7 I had about 4hrs battery life. My battery was fully charged and I had my laptop plugged in during the entire install of ubuntu. However, about 15 minutes after unplugging my laptop I get a message that says I only have 19 minutes of battery left. So now instead of 4 hours of battery I only have 45 minutes max. WTF?\nEverything I've researched so far seems to say things like \"change your power settings\" \"dim your screen\" etc. But none of these 'solutions' would in anyway account for a missing 3 hours of battery life. \nSo is this an issue with the battery monitor itself? How do I fix this? I came to Ubuntu because I'm starting to learn some programming and my win7 was gettting too buggy. I really don't want to go back now that I've seen what ubuntu is, but I can't function with only a half hour battery that I KNOW will last at least 3 hours. Please help!\n\nA: So, after lots of research from multiple websites and hours of reading (and no help from this post):\nHere is what I used to increase my battery life from 45min to 2:15 fully charged.\nInstalled the following programs\nPowertop\nLaptop Mode Tools\nJupiter\nI then figured out how to enable Intel i915 RC6 by using the following commands:\ngksudo nautilus\n\nwhich enabled me to have root access to the /etc/default/grub file \nthat I then modified the following lines\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\" \n\nto:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash i915.i915_enable_rc6=1\"\n\nand then used the terminal command:\nsudo update-grub\n\nNext I uninstalled all programs I was not using or would not use (including all the default media applications which I replaced with VLC) especially anything related to \"bluetooth\" as I have no bluetooth devices.\nI also made sure that beagle and updatedb are disabled such that they won't consume unnecessary power.\nI managed to do all of this after literally hours of reading about how to properly use the terminal, multitudes of google searches, and a composition notebook now half filled with terminal commands and lists of apps.\nUltimately I feel as though powertop, laptop mode tools, and jupiter are all basically doing the same thing from different angles and should all just be things that Ubuntu already should have, but that would just be crazy wouldn't it?\n", "Q: Deleting old windows files through ubuntu I had a pc with windows vista on and then got a new laptop so i installed ubuntu onto the vista pc using the USB installer (i didnt really know what i was doing just messing about i dont know a lot about this stuff however im competent with computers and such, enough knowhow to build a pc). Since then for some reason windows has become corrupted and wont launch so i cant go in to delete the files to clear up space as there is very little space left. Is there a way i can do this through ubuntu?\nEdit: Its dual boot as it gives me the option to choose but the vista one doesnt actually work for some reason, system restores and fixes failing.\nI cant see any of the files for the vista side from within ubuntu to delete them in the first place.\n\nA: Since you have a new laptop, and since your old laptop won't boot Windows, your best bet is to just reinstall Ubuntu on it(12.04 or 12.10). Use the entire disk and forget about deleting the Windows files from Ubuntu, etc. That's the easiest way forward.\nIf you really want to delete the Vista files/partition without reinstalling then just use disk utility or GParted and reformat the Vista partition. Open either program, select the Vista partition(s), and delete them.\n\nA: I haven't tried this with Ubuntu, but I have run a dual boot operating system before. It should be possible to view files in the other partition, and unless Vista denies permission, you can probably delete some. I ran a dual boot with two versions of windows (XP and 7 beta) and I could view files, music, and photos, but not programs. Windows Permissions might deny you access to delete the files, but I think that you should be able to view them anyway.\nWindows may have become corrupted because the partition was created on a drive containing data already. Usually it is best to only partition on a formatted drive, and then install your operating systems.\n", "Q: The battery of my laptop is maybe in danger? In windows 7, the battery of my core i7 VAIO would always only charge until 79 %\nhowever, in ubuntu it charges 100 %\ni heard from a friend that it is dangerous for battery to become charged fully and stays that way while the charger is still plugged in. i always have my charger plugged in. so is there a danger to my battery? or is there a way to manage battery options?\n\nA: Laptop batteries have a micro controller which switches the power drain from the battery to OFF when plugged in to an adapter. Leaving the laptop plugged in will not harm the battery. However, batteries have a lifespan, and depending on the manufacturer can last you a year or more. Eventually, the battery will go bad no matter how much care you put into it.\nAccording to the manufacturers they advise you to Unplug your charger once your battery is fully charged.Even though it shouldn’t make a difference if you don’t unplug it i advise you to unplug it once your laptop is fully charged!\nYou could also install a software/app which notifies you once your laptop is fully charged.look into this link for the software/app. \n\nA: Sometimes Windows laptops can develop a \"battery memory\" and gradually hold less and less of a charge. It is caused by not fully charging and draining a battery, and can be fixed by fully charging and draining the battery several times. However, I think that was limited to older machines, so it may not be your problem. Windows 7 on laptops can have trouble recognizing an old battery. On mine, it used to say I had a full charge, even though the battery no longer worked. Your battery may be having charging issues that are confusing Windows. How long does it last for? P.S. It's not dangerous to keep your laptop plugged in and the battery full, unless it overheats. Keep it on a cooling mat and you're fine.\n\nA: Two older types of batteries, once popular in portable computers, are nickel-cadmium (NiCad) and nickel-metal hydride (NiMH). A NiMH battery is longer lasting than a NiCad, but it too woefully suffers from The Dreaded Memory Effect.\n\nIt has to be discharged very often. For example, after you use, drain it til your computer shuts down and recharge it again to make you battery more healthy. \nThat progress is really painful for lazy people like me. \nFortunately, with new Li-ion battery type, it wouldn't be a problem if you keep charging your battery even it's full. In my opinon, it would be better to drain your battery 2-3 times per week to ~30% and then recharge it. \nSource: The different types of laptop batteries! \n\nA: There is an excellent post on how to make sure the battery only charges to 80%. It started out as a question about a Lenovo laptop, but it might hold for your case as well. It uses the tp_smapi kernel module.\nI personally find this one of the best battery management strategies.\nHere is a quote from the post by aquaherd:\n\ninstall and load the tp_smapi kernel module:\n\nsudo apt-get install tp-smapi-dkms\nsudo modprobe tp_smapi\n\n\nand write the desired charging thresholds to virtual files in /sys/devices/platform/smapi:\n\necho 40 | sudo tee /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/start_charge_thresh\necho 80 | sudo tee /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/stop_charge_thresh\n\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu 12.10 on UEFI along Windows 8 Hello I want to install Ubuntu 12.10 on an UEFI machine with manual partitioning.\n\n\n*\n\n*Do I have to disable \"Secure Boot\"?\n\n*Do I have to create a 2nd ESP (EFI System Partition) for Ubuntu?\n\n*Do I have to give it the boot flag?\n\n*Do I have to set mount point /boot/efi?\n\n*Do I have to install grub on /dev/sda?\n\n\nI am used to BIOS installation where:\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda1 100 MB Windows 7 hidden System Partition\n\n*/dev/sda2 200 GB Windows 7 C:\\ Drive\n\n*/dev/sda3 115 GB Linux Ext4 Root\n\n*/dev/sda4 2 GB Linux Swap\n\n*grub-install /dev/sda\n\n*update-grub\n\n\nA: *\n\n*In theory, no, you don't need to disable Secure Boot; Ubuntu 12.10 includes Secure Boot support. In practice, this feature is still new enough that it may not work reliably on all systems.\n\n*No, you don't need a second ESP; Ubuntu should be able to share a single ESP with Windows (or any other OS). In fact, sharing an ESP is the way it's supposed to work (although multiple ESPs are also legal).\n\n*The \"boot flag\" is simply libparted's (and therefore GParted's and parted's) way of identifying an ESP.\n\n*In principle, you can mount your ESP anywhere you like, or not at all. In practice, some tools may require the ESP to be mounted at /boot/efi. This would be most important for GRUB package updates, but some other tools might need this, too.\n\n*In an EFI system, GRUB doesn't install any code directly to the hard disk's MBR, although of course code does go on the hard disk -- just in the ESP. Thus, installing GRUB on /dev/sda doesn't really make sense. That said, some user interfaces may refer to doing so because they haven't been properly updated for the EFI case.

The following command fails with an error:\n$ dpkg -i libmotif*i386.deb\ndpkg: error: requested operation requires superuser privilege\n\nHow do I become a superuser? I thought I was the superuser?\n\nA: In all Unix systems, including Linux a Superuser is the system user who has all permissions to be able to perform administrative tasks. This can be the user root but this user is diabled in Ubuntu for security reasons.\nThe Ubuntu way to perform admistrative tasks is to temporarily gain superuser privileges by putting the command sudo (super user do) in front of another command that requires superuser powers:\nsudo dpkg -i packagename.deb\n\nThen you will be asked for your password (which is identical to your login password):\n[sudo] password for lasse: \n\nNote that you don't see anything in terminal while typing this passoword (not even asterixes).\nUsers that are allowed to be administrators on creation of their account are put on a list of sudoers to enable the system to look them up before granting administrative privileges with sudo.\nFor further reading and alternative ways on how to become superuser or root see:\n\n\n*\n\n*What are the differences between sudo, su, visudo, chroot, and gksu?\n\n*What are the differences between \"su\", \"sudo -s\", \"sudo -i\", \"sudo su\"?\n\n*Why is it bad to login as root?\nPlease also note that you can seriously harm your system when running a bad command as superuser. Sometimes you will not even be able to repair it. Therefore be careful what you do as superuser, and think twice before you press enter.\n\nA: Prefix sudo to your command to be a superuser. Hence, run the following command:\nsudo dpkg -i libmotif*i386.deb\n\nRunning this command would prompt you for your password. Type the password for your user account and press Enter. You won't see the characters as you type your password (not even asterisks *).\nFor more information on sudo, read this wonderful ubuntu wiki.\n\nA: Just do this If you are on Ubuntu\nnaren@kadmin-KCPL190: sudo su\n\nThen you will now be a root user and can do anything\nroot@kadmin-KCPL190:# dpkg -i libmotif*i386.deb\n\nwill work\nBe careful.

For some reason I'm unable to view videos on Youtube when using the Tor browser.

Those plugins can be manipulated into revealing your real IP address and harming your anonymity and privacy. Therefore, it's not recommended to install additional addons or plugins into the Tor Browser.\nThe lack of plugins means that Youtube videos are not available by default, but Youtube does provide an experimental HTML5-player as an opt-in feature that works for most videos.

It is an hp pavilion p6-2376.\n\nA: UEFI is not an impediment to installing Ubuntu 12.10. Contrary to one comment, it's not an impediment for 12.04, either, or even several earlier versions -- but Ubuntu's UEFI support has improved with recent releases, so it's better in 12.10 than in 12.04.\nThat said, you may need to do things differently than you would on a BIOS-based computer. Windows 8 machines also usually ship with Secure Boot enabled, which can cause problems. (This is an area in which 12.10 is supposedly better than 12.04, but I've seen a few problem reports even with 12.10, so you may have to disable Secure Boot in your firmware.)\nI've heard that the image file used to distribute Ubuntu boots successfully in EFI mode from CD, but not when burned to USB drive.

So there's no magic command which reads such files or, say, a magic switch for some command:\ncat --ignore-permissions /home/hacker-weekly/secret\n\nThat's why it is called a competition - you need to work around the OS security machinery or find a mis-configuration of the machine which would allow you to access the file. \nIn this case, I think, the give-away is the guest user which is in the secret group - I think you need somehow to become guest.\nIf you had physical access to the machine, you could also reboot into a single-user mode or unplug the hard drive and put it into another machine.\n", "Q: How come many of the AppShowdown apps aren't available in Ubuntu anymore?

I used to work with a virtual machine on which I installed Ubuntu (and my host is Apple OS X). But my Mac's hard-drive crashed. I managed to retrive the .vdi file on my VirtualBox App folder.\nHow can I install it again?\n\nA: A .vdi (virtual disk) file is a disk image used by VirtualBox. You can think of it as representing one piece of your virtual hardware--the hard disk.\nIf you only have one piece of the machine, that's the important one--it's a virtual machine, after all, and new virtual parts don't cost anything.\nOpen Virtual Box. Create a new virtual machine. When you get to the point where are asked about its hard disk, specify that .vdi file as the disk. Or make a virtual machine and, later, add it as a disk and remove whatever unused virtual disk was originally created for it. (If you do it that way and you want to delete the new blank disk, make sure you don't delete the .vdi file that has your data on it by accident!)\nBy the way, if you can manage to recover the whole virtual machine (i.e., the other files from it as well), then you can import it into VirtualBox by opening the virtual machine file (ending in .xml).\nYour question may be considred off-topic, as you're asking how to reconstruct a VirtualBox VM in OS X. Which operating system the VM is running (in this case Ubuntu) is irrelevant, so this isn't really about Ubuntu. On the other hand, VirtualBox is also Ubuntu software--for Ubuntu users who want to have virtual machines. Answers to your questions won't really be host system specific either, so I suppose this might be considered on-topic, which is why I've posted this answer. Better sites for it may be Ask Different and Super User, but please don't have the same question open on more than one SE site at a time.\n", "Q: Recent notebooks incompatible with ubuntu? I'm thinking about purchasing a laptop. Since without Linux it would be for me a worthless object, let me ask the following: \n\n\n*\n\n*Are there recent note- or ultrabooks that cannot support Ubuntu 12.10 installation? \n\n*Are there notebooks that work considerably below the features they promise when one uses Ubuntu?\n\n\n(I posted this question because I saw this post and I'm afraid of buying something that won't work).\n\nA: Yes, due to the fact that hardware developers often do not bother themselves with supporting anything but Windows, and often do not release specifications for the hardware, there may be sometimes a lag between a product appearing on the market and support for it added to Linux. The situation improved quite a bit over the last years though, with major hardware developers supporting Linux.\nIf you want to avoid problems with device support in Ubuntu, you're advised to buy a laptop with Ubuntu pre-installed from one of the manufacturers which sell such machines, or refer to Ubuntu Desktop certified hardware document.\nIf you have a particular laptop on your mind and it's not in the list of certified hardware - it does not mean it won't work with Ubuntu though, in many cases everything works just fine, but you need to search google to see if there any problems with that particular model. \n", "Q: Why doesn't mplayer work with VDPAU?

That will significantly cut down initial download.\nYou add GUI (unity, gnome, lightdm, gdm, etc) later. They will function exactly the same as the desktop installation.\nThe major difference between Server and Desktop installation is all GUI and desktop related packages.\nThis post provide a simple tweak to use wubi and install as a server, quote as below\n\nThat said you can edit c:\\wubi\\install\\preseed.cfg and set the package\n  to \"ubuntu-standard\".\nThat will install a minimal set of packages, good enough to get a\n  useful shell and enable you to install other packages, from there you\n  can install any other ubuntu-server specifc package you want\n\n", "Q: How do I get my volume keys working?

Should I copy my Wine folder and paste it in the Playonlinux directory? \n\nA: The Wine import plugin works fine.\nOR\ncopy the whole .wine folder with registry entries.\nto:\n/home/user/.PlayOnLinux/wineprefix/\n\nPlayOnLinux For the Precise version\nType the following commands:\nwget -q \"http://deb.playonlinux.com/public.gpg\" -O- | sudo apt-key add

It is a bit like a 'shortcut' in windows language.\n    -l, --links                 copy symlinks as symlinks\n    -L, --copy-links            transform symlink into referent file/dir\n        --copy-unsafe-links     only \"unsafe\" symlinks are transformed\n        --safe-links            ignore symlinks that point outside the tree\n    -k, --copy-dirlinks         transform symlink to dir into referent dir\n    -K, --keep-dirlinks         treat symlinked dir on receiver as dir\n    -H, --hard-links            preserve hard links\n\nHere is an easy example:\nsudo rsync --verbose --recursive --links --perms --executability --owner --group --times /media/some-user-name/the-c-drive-you-want /media/some-user-name/the-external-drive\n\nUse the option --dry-run for a hypothetical run that does not write anything to your external drive.\nRead the man rsync for more information on the different options.\n", "Q: How to run windows-only forex application MetaTrader in Ubuntu? After checking some forex sites like AGEA - Trading and Investing site, they are giving good business but only run on windows. What I want to know is if there are any kind of forex business application which run under Ubuntu? What is the name of the platform and how do I join that business. I don't want to go back installing windows to make this business run with me. \n\n\nA: You can use Wine to run Windows-only Application within Ubuntu.\nWine supports MetaTrader and you would be able to run it fine. However, you would have to use the Development Version of Wine as MetaTrader4 requires Wine 1.5.4 and MetaTrader5 requires Wine 1.5.9. Look at this link which gives further information about running MetaTrader under Wine. The latest Wine Development Release is 1.5.20 and you should install this version for greater compatibility.\nStep 1 : Add Wine PPA to your software sources:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa\n\nStep 2 : Update your software sources:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nStep 3 : Install latest development release of Wine:\nsudo apt-get install wine1.5\n\nStep 4 : Run the executable Setup File *.exe for your version of MetaTrader to install it as you normally do in Windows.\n\nA: Although you can run MT4/5 on ubuntu (as I do), you will run into issues with regards to rendering of icons/graphics, that is problematic in the linux world. My suggesting to you, is if you want to run something native on your laptop/desktop (without the use of a VPS), then try opening up a demo account with a broker that offers a web based platform.\n\nA: Maybe Crossover fits you better than Wine. According with the official webpage, crossover runs MetaTrader.\nOk, Crossover is not free software, but maybe for you is most straitforward solution.\n", "Q: gnome-contacts-search-provider using all resources I noticed that when I use GNOME Shell Activities menu search, my CPU usage on first core jumps to 80 - 100 %.

Or it might be taking a lot of time.\nPlease tell me why am I getting error, and how to fix it.\nThanks!\n\nA: *~ gets expanded by the shell before it gets assigned to your alias. The actual assignment is:\nalias rm~='find .name some~ file~ 1n.in~ -print0 | xargs -0 /bin/rm -f'\n\nI suggest to use functions instead of aliases, these are much more powerful and easier to handle in regard with quotes.\nWhile we are at it, remove the superfluous . (current directory is implied if no parameters are given) and stop abusing xargs since a -delete option already exist.\nrm~() { find -name '*~' -ls -delete; }\n\nThe -ls option is optional, but adding it will show you which files have been deleted.\n\nA: Your bash alias is not well written (the single quotes are not well used). Instead it should be:\nalias rm~='find . -name \"*~\" -print0 | xargs -0 /bin/rm -f'\n\nNow, I personally don't like useless uses of pipes and xargs, so your alias would be better written as:\nalias rm~='find . -name \"*~\" -type f -exec /bin/rm -fv -- {} +'\n\nThe -type f option so as to find only files (not directories, links, etc.), the -v option to rm so as to be verbose (prints out what it's deleting). The + at the end so that find runs rm with all the found files (spawns only one instance of rm, instead of one per file).\nNow from man bash:\n\nFor almost every purpose, aliases are superseded by shell functions.\n\nInstead of an alias, it's better to use a function: comment your alias in the .bash_aliases file (i.e., put a # in front of that line), and in the file .bashrc, put this function (anywhere in the file, at the end is fine):\nrm~() {\n    find . -name \"*~\" -type f -exec /bin/rm -fv -- {} +\n}\n\nAlso, as the other answer mentions, you can use the -delete command to find. In this case, your rm~ function will be:\nrm~() {\n    find . -name \"*~\" -type f -printf \"Removing file %p\\n\" -delete\n}\n\nIn fact, you can make a cool function that will take an argument, say --dry-run, that will only output what it will delete:\nrm~() {\n    case \"$1\" in\n    \"--dry-run\")\n        find . -name \"*~\" -type f -printf \"[dry-run] Removing file %p\\n\"\n        ;;\n    \"\")\n        find . -name \"*~\" -type f -printf \"Removing file %p\\n\" -delete\n        ;;\n    *)\n        echo \"Unsupported option \\`$1'. Did you mean --dry-run?\"\n        ;;\n    esac\n}\n\nThen use as:\nrm~ --dry-run\n\nto only show the files that will be deleted (but not delete them) and then\nrm~\n\nwhen you're happy with this.\nAdapt and extend to your needs!\nNote.

Do you know some alternatives?\nI already know about DirectFB and Wayland. With Wayland I am not really sure if it can be seen as a replacement-alternative or simple some kind of addon.\nAlso I am asking about Ubuntu in particular in the question. So I was wondering if there is an alternative (already packed as a packaged for ubuntu). If somebody knows an \"not ubuntu yet\" alternative I would none-the-less appreciate a response as I assume ubuntu is thought to embrace development and progress (which alternatives might induce). Thank you.\nbackground\n(why I am looking for it?)\nThe key aspect here is security.\nWhile ubuntu offers security in many aspects\n\n*\n\n*LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup) for disk encryption\n\n*AppArmor MAC (Mandatory Access Control) for zero day attacks\n\n*gnupg (Gnu Privacy Guard) signatures, safe mail communication\n\nit is sad to know that the X.org server might give away much security. The concern is stated in many places. It is for instance:\nThe X server allows an X client to:\n\n - Snoop on the screen by reading its contents.\n - Snoop on the keyboard.\n - Take control of other X clients by sending them keyboard and mouse events.\n - Impersonate other X clients by using their names in window title bars.\n - Discover what other X clients are running.\n - Steal the input focus.\n - Deny service by grabbing the pointer or keyboard or the whole server.\n - Deny service by consuming the X server's resources. strong text\n\nsource: http://plash.beasts.org/wiki/X11Security\nThe above would mean that some software running in the X-server (this almost is every program that has a graphical output - is not running on the command line) can make itself a keylogger.\nThe linux file system is keeping the permissions set and by this User A can be restricted to access User B's files.\nIn the X.org/X-server it is hard to keep program A from accessing the X-server resources of program B. So by having installed a malicious firefox addon + using a sudo ... on gnome-terminal you might have done enough to give away remote root access.\nThis is why I want to learn / ask about alternatives to X.org's Xserver software (in ubuntu). At best an alternative that keeps the programs graphic resources (windows,keyboard input) separated!\nMaybe this is some comprisive description of the problem that drives my search for an alternative: http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.de/2011/04/linux-security-circus-on-gui-isolation.html\n\nA: Wayland is supposed to be a complete replacement for X, not an addon, and it addresses the problems which concern you. Note that at the moment Wayland is not production ready and there is limited driver and toolkit support for it.\nIt seems that Ubuntu does not have any plans to integrate Wayland at the moment, and wants to create its own display server called Mir, which may also address some of your security concerns. Mir is also not ready for general use.\nDirectFB is a bare bones solution for embedded systems which gives programs direct access to the video card's framebuffer. It does not have any security mechanisms.\nAnother solution is not to run a GUI at all.\n", "Q: How can I restore template functionality after having deleted the Templates folder in 12.10? As many I deleted the Templates on a fresh install. I followed the instructions in the accepted answer of What is the templates folder in the home dir for? I am running 12.10 and the proposed solution to restore the templates functionality does not work.\nI did reboot. I tried a .Templates folder and a Templates folder and I played with XDG_TEMPLATES_DIR=\"$HOME/Templates\".

I've been trying to install Ubuntu for last 2 days, and have gone through many webpages for help with no avail.\nHere's what I did:\nI downloaded Unetbootin and used it to mount the 12.10 Desktop Edition .iso file to 4GB USB. The computer i'm trying to install does not support USB booting. But by going to Hard Drives --> Extra Plugin in boot many(F12), it does allow USB booting. and it opens and shows the error invalid or corrupt kernal image boot:.\nI guess if I give the directive to the booting file which it asks for, it will allow me to install. Or what should I do to install it? This same error has shown before when I tried to install it through CD.\nThe above method is what I tried last. I have tried many ways. By using USB Installer, the error is UI Directive not found, or something like that. It was caused by my USB being NTFS. \nEdit:\nI formatted my USB to FAT32. My C:/ is already FAT32. \n\nA: I got it working. I formatted usb in fat16 and used universal usb installer to mount iso and now its done. I've installed it. But i dont think i want Ubuntu now, because this seems pretty slow, 'cause this pc is pretty old. It have Pentium 4 @ 3 GHz, Ram - 1.2GB.\nI searched web and found out Xubuntu. I've downloaded the iso. Now this is my new problems.\nTo format the drive and to mount the iso, i went to startup disk creator. It failed to format the drive. So i just deleted the files in it and clicked on make the drive. Xubuntu booted for install, but showed some error. I guess it's 'cause its because the format wasn't done. Help me.\n\nA: Before burning the Image file to DVD or copying it to USB, i think you should test the checksum of the downloaded file.\nHere you can re-download the .ISO file if needed.\n", "Q: Networking security issue with suspicious traffic.

I am running 12.04 64 Bit with an Atheros Wifi Module. My WLAN router to which I'm trying to connect to is a Thomson TWG850 device. It seems that this device crashes every time I connect to it using this PC only.\nAt the beginning I thought my own wireless module on the notebook would crash. After looking at my mobile phone (android) I realised that the router kicks out all devices conntected to it. So after I shut down Ubuntu I tried with my W7 PC and everything works fine. \nFurthermore, each time that happens, Ubuntu asks me for my WLAN Key (WPA). Ubuntu send out a system report for an internal error stating that the \"WPA Supplicant hast crashed\". I am not sure if this has anything to do with the WPA I am talking about.\nOther Forums suggest deactivating N-Modus on Ubuntu or on the Router. This unfortunately doesnt help me. I have been looking in many forums, but theres no real help. A lot of people seem to face the same problem.\nI am sorry, very new to ubuntu so if you need anymore info about the system, please tell me how to pull those.

When StartTLS is enabled, msmtp will connect to the server and wait for the server to send data (the SMTP welcome message). If the server does not support StartTLS and expects the connection to be encrypted with SSL from the beginning, it will not send data and will wait for the client to set the SSL connection up.\nSo you can try setting tls_starttls off in the defaults section of ~/.msmtprc. Also check that the port is correct.\n(To troubleshoot this problem, I verified with strace msmtp that when msmtp was hanging it was connecting to the right server on the right port and waiting to receive data, whereas using openssl s_client on the same server and port seemed to work.)\n\nA: Beware! \"reading recipients from the command line\" is the last informational message from msmtp before it tries to connect to the server. If it hangs at that point, it means it can't connect. Nothing to do with the command line so don't do what I did and go off on wild goose chases. You could try connecting with telnet (e.g. telnet mail.example.com 587) to see if the server responds. If not, double check its url and port. Or, in my case, fail2ban on the server had banned me after some failed login attempts due to a wrong user name. Simple answer in that case is to wait several hours for the ban to expire.\n\nA: OK, problem solved.  msmtp version 1.4.26 seems to be broken; after installing v1.4.30 it started to work.\n\nA: Sorry for bringing this old thread back to life, but seeing it as 12.04 currently still is LTS it may still be of value to some.\nToday I configured msmtp and ran into the same problem as OP described; the command hanging at \"reading recipients from the command line\". I solved the problem by adding the \"port\" parameter and the port used by my ISP. If no port parameter is set the default (25) is used, and my ISP uses a different port when using STARTTLS.\nI see that OP already had the port parameter configured, so it might not be the issue in this particular case. However with my configuration the email was successfully sent (and received), so I don't believe msmtp 1.4.26 is broken.\n\nA: Scaleway blocks the typical SMTP ports by default - 25, 465, 587 which resulted in this same log results.\nTheir docs show how to enable the SMTP access, archived from their website 2022-01-06 [0]:\nYou can enable them from the security group configuration.\nRequirements:\n\n*\n\n*You have an account and are logged into the Scaleway Console\n\n*You have created at least one Instance\n\n*You have a Build Level account\n\n*You have completed the identification process (KYC)\n\n\n*\n\n*Click Instances on the side menu of the Scaleway console.\n\n\n*Click the Security Groups tab.\n\n\n*Select the security group for which you want to enable SMTP ports.\nNote: If you have not created any security groups, your Instance has been assigned to the default security group, so this will be the one you should modify.\n\n\n*Tick the checkbox Enable SMTP.\nNote: The security group settings will be immediately updated on all your virtual Instances.\n[0] https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/console/my-account/how-to/send-emails-from-your-instance/\n", "Q: What desktop environments can group window icons in the taskbar like Windows 7? I find it much faster to identify a window in the taskbar (window list) by its icon,\n\nrather than by its text:\n\nThe problem with most graphical interfaces I've switched among is that they don't group windows, and if you have more terminals or file managers, they'll just clutter the taskbar and you won't know which is which. Windows 7 offers a relatively elegant solution to this by grouping similar window icons together.\nQuestion: What Linux desktop environments have this functionality? If addons exist that provide it, that's alright.\nFor reference, a Cinnamon applet that sort of does this is Window List With App Grouping.\n\nA: Unity's launcher groups windows belonging to one application in the same icon.\n\nFor example, in this screenshot, I have two Firefox windows open, and one Thunderbird window open. The Firefox icon in the launcher has two corresponding arrows on the left to indicate this, and the Thunderbird icon has one arrow. If I click the Firefox icon, I can choose between its two windows, which are immediately rearranged and laid out on the screen.\n\nA: *\n\n*LXDE's LX Panel has this capability. Right-click the taskbar and select \"Task Bar (Window List)\" Settings. Check \"Combine multiple application windows into a single button\". If \"icons only\" is also selected, there's no visual indication that an icon may represent more than one window.\n\n*There's also XFCE4-panel in which a task list item could be added [1].\n\n\nA: Dockbarx does exactly what you want. It can be combined with AWN and others easily.\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2009/12/7-beautiful-dockbarx-themes-taskbar.html?m=1\nIf you want to see this in action, download the free version of Zorin OS, which has done this.\n\nA: In Xfce, you can easily configure the Window Buttons plug-in on the panel to emulate a Windows 7-like look & feel. See screenshot: \n\nTo do so, right-click on the plug-in's handle, access Properties, then uncheck the Show button labels option. You may also consider modifying the Sorting order option to something that you prefer (personally I always go for None, allow DnD). \nAnother possibility in Xfce is the less well-known xfce4-tasklist-plugin, which specifically \"mimicks the Windows 7 taskbar (pinning applications, etc)\". \nSee this related discussion on xfce-dev ML: tweaking Window Buttons defaults.\n\nA: I personally just stick with Gnome Shell for this feature though with the Dash extension.  You can install gnome shell extensions at https://extensions.gnome.org/\nIf you have say multiple Google Chrome windows open you just right click on the icon and select which window you want.  \nNot exactly the same as windows 7, but you use a right click instead of a left to view the window.  If you left click it takes you to the window you viewed last.  I prefer this functionality.\nYou can also look at docky, cario dock, awn.  I prefer docky.  AWN has a lot of features though for just a seperate more customizable \"dock\", \"dash\", \"launcher\", or thing.\nI also use alt+tab alot.  In gnome shell you also have access to the super key.  It makes viewing all your applications pretty easy.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: KDE Plasma Desktop can have the taskbar like Windows 7.\nIn KDE Plasma 5, there are three steps to follow:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right-click on the bottom panel, somewhere next to the K-menu icon  \n\n*Click Alternatives... to see list of Alternative Widgets  \n\n*Select Icon-only Task Manager and then click Switch\nThat is all, launch few similar applications to see the result. With Icon-only Task Manager, application icons will always be combined and grouped together.\n\nDiscrepancy: By default, a click on the application icons will activate a certain desktop effect. To disable this behaviour, Go to Settings > Desktop Behavior > Desktop Effects and then, locate and clear the checkbox for \"Present Windows\". The desktop effect will be replaced by a small pop-up window as shown in the screenshot above.\nFollowing above steps, the taskbar option \"Always combine, hide labels\" in Windows 7 can be reproduced similarly in KDE Plasma Desktop. This has been possible beginning from KDE Plasma 4, but the newer generation KDE Plasma 5 has simplified the setup.\n", "Q: How to make wireless working on HP Pavilion g6-2220?

A different one?\n\nA: Using rsync directly turned out to be more problematic than I first thought:\n\n\n*\n\n*The command needs to be run as root on the remote machine.\n\n*I didn't won't to enable remote root login.\n\n*The filesystem in based on LVM and it was a hassle to mount the actual root partition of the VM from inside the LVM in the VDI file.\n\n\nFor these reasons I ended up with a 2 step process:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy all the files from the remote machine to the local host machine.\n\n*Copy the files to the guest.\n\n\nI finally went with basic tar, although I could have used rdiffdir provided by duplicity to save some bandwidth.\nI started out by setting up an SSH tunnel which I could use to tunnel the tar files so I wouldn't have to write the archive to the filesystem I was copying.\nlocal$ ssh user@remote -R 3000:localhost:3000\nloacl$ nc -l 3000 > filesystem.tar.gz\nremote$ sudo tar -vcz / --exclude={/dev,/proc,/sys,/tmp} | nc localhost 3000\n\nThis created a tar archive of the entire filesystem in my local host machine. The next step was to untar it on the guest:\nguest$ cd /\nguest$ nc -l 3000 | sudo tar -xvz\nlocal$ nc guest_ip 3000 < filesystem.tar.gz \n\nIn my case /etc/fstab referenced filesystems by their UUIDs, so I had to update it with the output of guest$ sudo blkid. I also had to update the networking settings in /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules (interface names) and /etc/network/interfaces (ip addresses).\n\nA: Admittedly the dd-approach or creating an otherwise image of the server is likely to have bandwith issues in case you only have remote access to the server.\nInstalling Ubuntu 10.04 server to a VDI only to be able to copy an existing installation also is not really needed (but it may save some bandwith).\nLet me suggest the following approach:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a Virtual Machine with an empty virtual hard disk of desired size.\n\n*Boot the VM with any live (Ubuntu) system from an .iso file.\n\n*Partition the hard drive (include boot flag and format with the same file system your old server has).\n\n*Mount this partition to your live environment.\n\n*Copy all files from the old server to the yet empty partition of your VM\nrsync -avze ssh user@host:/ /<mountpoint>\n\n\n*Install Grub resp. Grub2 to the MBR of the now populated VDI drive.\n\n*Reboot.\n\n", "Q: How can I switch a 64-bit installation to a 32-bit one?

So just do a clean install. You can do a clean install that keeps all your files, but it's highly recommended to back up first.\n", "Q: How do I resolve date range events? Shotwell has grouped a large number of images in a \"date range\" event. I do not know when and how this happened; the images may have been group this way for a year or so. All new images a event tagged correctly.\nAt any rate: is there a way to move the images to their right event, based on their dates?\nDates (both EXIF and file system dates) seem to be correct. \nI use Shotwell version 0.12.3 and has been using it for a couple of years. It works fine, otherwise.\nPer.\n\nA: Shotwell defines Events as 'A group of photos that were taken at approximately the same time.' This is a grey area, and things like batches of scanned images, multiple photo shoots with multiple imports the same day, or sets of photos taken around midnight, can leave you with an event structure that you might not prefer.\nIf your goal is to have Shotwell sort photos strictly by individual dates, then this is a long-standing bug report/feature request (#2747). Disabling events entirely and using date only is another closely related request (#2665).\nQuestions that are bug reports (and feature requests are a subset of bug reports) are off-topic on Ask Ubuntu so your question may be closed.\nIf you want to manually sort the images in question, creating events and moving groups of images in to each event, Shotwell's help page describes how. I'll summarize here but it's best to read that entire page.\n\n\n*\n\n*To rename an event select Events -> Rename Event or double-click it and type.\n\n*To move photos between events, drag any photo to the sidebar and drop it on an event.\n\n*To create a new event select Events -> New Event\n\n\nIf you find that any of the photos have the wrong date/time that's easy to adjust too.\n", "Q: Can I write programs in C# on Ubuntu?

I'm aware that askubuntu is probably not the ideal place to ask this question, but considering that the problem occurred while I was installing ubuntu I'm guessing others may have run into the problem. \nI needed to reinstall ubuntu from 12.10 to 12.04, so I went about the routine, creating a bootable usb, formatting the partition with ubuntu currently installed, and installing it anew. \nUpon reboot I get the grub rescue fault, only with a little twist, this time it says:\nError, no such device: <####>\ngrub rescue>\n\nI quickly make a rescatux bootable USB on another PC and try and restore MBR through it. I still get the error, but this time GRUB shows up if the computer is booted with the USB inserted. \nAny thoughts? \n\nA: You are experiencing launchpad bug 384633, feel free to add yourself to the \"does it affect you\" list.  In a nutshell, the initial grub.cfg file is set up when the live usb media is present, and counted in the devices, with the target usb device some other device.  At the first boot, without the live usb, the device order is different, and your \"no such device\" is probably grub trying to boot off an sdc which doesn't exist, when it should be using sdb.  12.10 changed the wrong disk ordering, sticking the target at sda, which at least will be present, but probably is the hard disk instead of the usb.  Anyway, you can edit the initial grub boot (instructions on screen) to fix the wrong device (change the hdx when it occurs to refer to the correct disk (hd0 typically the hard disk, hd1 typically the usb) and on the linux line the /dev/sdx to be sdb.  At the first successful boot, run \nsudo update-grub\n\nto insert the UUID's and correct the wrong devices.\n", "Q: What is the difference between mono and mono develop? i am curious to know what exactly is the difference between Mono Software and Monodevelop. and do i need both of these if i want to do \"C#\"?\n\nA: *\n\n*mono\nis the runtime that executes your interpreted code.\n\n*monodevelop\nis an IDE (Intergrated Development Enviroment) it helps you write, evaluate and debug code written in VB, C#, etc. that eventually gets executed by the mono runtime.\nWhile you need mono, you don't need monodevelop to write and execute C# applications.

I just installed the LAMP server and PHPMyAdmin. Once I logged in I noticed databases already created and within them tons of tables and rows.\nMy question of course is whether I can just delete them all without failing the system in any way. Below you see what I saw once I entered the first database.\n\n\nA: INFORMATION_SCHEMA, PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA and mysql (and possibly more) are special system tables in MySQL. Please refer to the MySQL documentation on this. One excerpt:\n\nUsage Notes for the INFORMATION_SCHEMA Database\nINFORMATION_SCHEMA is a database within each MySQL instance, the place that stores information about all the other databases that the MySQL server maintains. The INFORMATION_SCHEMA database contains several read-only tables. They are actually views, not base tables, so there are no files associated with them, and you cannot set triggers on them. Also, there is no database directory with that name.\n\nSo, no, don't attempt to delete them. You need them in order to have a functional MySQL installation. Moreover, they're probably protected from any regular way of deleting/altering them.\n", "Q: Behringer usb Guitar Link, how to?

If I do not delete XP (so I have to choose what OS I want each time I boot), will all the files and programs on XP be deleted? If not will I be able to access them through Ubuntu or will I have to load up XP to get at them?\n\nA: If, by \"windows installer\", you mean to say you want to install Ubuntu \"inside\" Windows, then no files will be deleted and you will be able to access your files and folders even in Ubuntu. However, you won't be able to run your windows applications directly in Ubuntu. You can run some of those, if not all, using applications like wine.\nAll files which are stored in the virtual disk where Ubuntu is installed are stored in a folder /host, which you will be able to see when after you install Ubuntu and boot into Ubuntu. For your information, you can also install Ubuntu alongside Ubuntu, which is usually considered to be more common and better for long-term uses, since crashing of Windows does not affect Ubuntu, which is not the case if you install it inside Windows, i.e. like an application.\nFor more information, read this. If you have trouble installing Ubuntu, please refer to the above link or you can also post your queries or problems here, if they are not already posted.\n\nA: First of all, let me clear up some confusion you seem to have. If you use the Windows installer (Wubi), Ubuntu will be installed inside Windows onto a virtual disk (not partition) and will be thus vulnerable to Windows Filesystem Fragmentation and other issues. This option does not put your files at risk on Windows (though it does put Ubuntu at risk).\nUbuntu does best if you install it on its own partition, and you can use the Ubuntu installer to do this. Once installed, Ubuntu can access your Windows files (which will be on another partition). In fact, it can even do this when running as a LiveCD/USB. If you use the advanced partitioning options, you can even have your Windows partition show up as a folder on Ubuntu (such as /Windows).\n", "Q: enabling volume renaming in Quantal I partitioned my vaio with ubuntu 12.10 (Simple Gnome environment) so that I have 2 separate volumes for folders and file keeping (call it a long paranoid windows using effect :)).

But when I try to remove it in Synaptic it wants me to mark lubuntu-desktop for removal as well. (This also happens when I try to remove Abiword and anything else that came with Lubuntu.)\n\nA: I've had no problems because of its removal in Lubuntu 12.10. It's considered a \"meta package\" and not of any consequence.\nYou can read this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Documentation/RemoveLubuntuDesktop.\nTo quote from there:\n\nWhen you want to remove a program from lubuntu, you may be told that by doing so it will remove lubuntu-desktop. The package lubuntu-desktop is only used for the installation of lubuntu and can safely be removed.\nLubuntu-desktop is what is called a meta-package which, simply put, is just a list of what to install. It is a design decision that all packages included in lubuntu-desktop depend on it, so as to be able to use --no-install-recommends option when the initial installation occurs, thus preventing non-essential programs being installed.\n\nAnd here is more on the subject: Re: [Lubuntu-desktop] lubuntu-desktop metapackage - Recommends vs Dependencies.\n", "Q: How do I disable the discrete graphics and force the use of my integrated Intel HD graphics on an HP Envy 15t-3200?

See Alvar's answer bellow.\n\nA: I just want to clarify why you are doing this. The basic idea is wrong since it will use the same amount of RAM as the 64-bit version.\n32-bit consume less ram on a 32-bit system, this is a fact. But it will allocate more RAM on a 64-bit system because the 32-bit packages will be carried through the cpu as 64-bit packages and therefor allocate the same RAM as the 64-bit version. If you are worried about RAM install the 32-bit version. I just did a report on this 32/64 bit problem for school.\nSo my answer to you is to install any version of 64-bit or 32-bit both will use the same amount of RAM. IF you want to use less RAM install the 32-bit version or upgrade the hardware of your computer. \n\nA: I think it would be better to install chromium rather than chrome.\nChromium is available in repository for easy install, you might be interested in updating it often. To do that, you have to add chromium-update to repo.\nFrom information i was able to obtain, the official PPA of chromium is still active but due to low human resources it's not updated always when stable version is released. For that reason some of you might still use version 18 instead of 22.\nThis is temporary PPA till official will work properly:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:a-v-shkop/chromium\nMore info you'll find here\nwww.ubuntufixer.blogspot.com\n", "Q: How do I remove a stuck Nvidia-settings-experimental-310 package?

First time asker, relatively new to Ubuntu/Linux. Haven't had much luck with the search function. Please forgive the essay below - the problem is a bit unique, I think...\nI'm running 12.04 on a laptop (with UEFI BIOS), with full disk encryption set up up using the Alternate CD. I recently made a backup image of the entire hard drive using dd, to an external USB hdd. Having recently made some changes on the laptop, I tried to plug in the external USB clone to copy the files to it. Despite getting the password prompt and having it appear in the Disk Utility as a logical volume group, it would not actually mount the external drive, saying it was 'not a mountable file system'. Tried it on my desktop, and it mounted up just fine (once I installed lvm2). \nUsing pvdisplay, I noticed that both the external drive and internal laptop drive had the same UUID (duh, it's a clone!). So, on the desktop, I used pvchange -u to change the external drive's uuid. Plugged it into the laptop, alas, still no joy. Gave up, turned off the laptop (drive still plugged in), went and had dinner. Came back, unplugged external drive from now-off laptop, tried to boot. Problems!\nIt boots to the password prompt screen fine. Enter the password, and after a long wait, it drops to an initramfs prompt, with the error: \n\"ALERT! /dev/mapper/ubuntu-root does not exist.\"\nPoop. \nIf I reboot, and plug back in the external drive, it boots up, seemingly running root off the USB drive. I have tried the solution here, entering /dev/sda3 (and yet more variants) instead. No bingo, still get exactly the same messages. The fact I'm using LUKS with a LVM seems to complicate things. I think I've muddled a config file somewhere, probably by plugging in two drives with the same UUID (stupid!) and now it thinks /root is on the external drive. I'm stumped as to how to get it back. \n\nA: I FIXED IT!!\nFor the references of future generations, heres how:\nThe problem was that by plugging the a clone of the system I was running into it, I'd \"confused\" my system as to which drive to write to, and somehow nuked the Volume Group metadata for the original internal drive. Luckily, I still had the metadata from the clone I'd made.\nThis meant that I could plug in the working backup, unlock it, and use vgcfgbackup to make a copy of its metadata.\n~$ sudo vgcfgbackup -f /tmp/trousers\n  Volume group \"ubuntu\" successfully backed up.\n\nThis creates a text file with the metadata in /tmp called trousers (called it whatever you like, makes no difference)\nThen, I dismounted and unplugged the functioning backup clone, and plugged in the borked internal drive. Unlocked it like I did the backup, then run:\n sudo vgcfgrestore -f /tmp/trousers ubuntu\n  Restored volume group ubuntu\n\nUpon doing this, the volume group suddenly sprang to life in disk utility, and the borked internal was unborked, mountable and readable again!\nCritical bit here is that 'ubuntu' was the name of the original volume group. You can verify this by opening up the 'trousers' file in gedit and looking at the entry on the line below \"creation_time\".\nAlso worth noting that this only worked because the backup was an exact clone of the original internal, and hence the VG metatdata file had all the correct UUID's in place. I actually got an error message first time round because I'd originally manually changed one of the UUID's on the external drive.  I had to use pvdisplay on the original internal to find its UUID, and then manually edit the 'trousers' file to get it to work.\nAnyway, hope that helps someone one day.\n", "Q: Crontab and Shell Script not Executing Anybody any suggestions on why my crontab and shell script is not running.\nI have \nchmod +x my shell script and added the following into crontab -e\n*/5 * * * * bash cd /home/jclark/scrips/ipcheck/ && ./ipCheck.sh\n\nipCheck.sh then costits of the following:\n#!/bin/sh\ncurl http://api.externalip.net/ip/ -o ipRecord.txt\n\nAlthough it doesn't appear to be running?\n\nA: You can't run bash commands like that.

If you use the override to boot, Windows will start as usual.\n\nA: The \"override to boot\" is a menu on the \"boot\" tab of the motherboards configuration menu. It lets you select and start instantly any boot loader installed yet on your rig.\n\nA: I have a similar issue with my new HP Pavillion Sleekbook, Model 15-b142dx.  It came with W8 pre-loaded.  I was able to re-size the Windows partition from within Windows, then installed 64-bit Ubuntu 13.04 from a thumb drive.  However, on reboot, W8 started normally, with no boot menu.  So, I used \"boot-repair\", which made the system unbootable.  On start-up, it would print:\nFailed to open \\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\grubx64.efi - 800000000000000E \nFailed to load grub\nFailed to open \\EFI\\BOOT\\grubx64.efi - 800000000000000E\nFailed to load grub\nFailed to open \\EFI\\BOOT\\grubx64.efi - 800000000000000E\nFailed to load grub\n\nIt would then shut down.\nAfter some trial and error, I found that pressing F10 during boot would take me to the BIOS, where I could disable Secure Boot.  The next boot, I got a LONG menu from grub, with lots of entries like:\nWindows UEFI bkpbootmgfw.efi\nWindows Boot UEFI loader\nEFI/HP/BIOSUpdate/CryptRSA32.efi\n.\n.\n.\n\nThese were all contained in a file, \"/etc/grub.d/25_custom\".  I made a backup copy of that file, then eliminated all the entries except Windows Boot UEFI loader. (This is one of the entries that allows W8 to boot).  I then ran \"update-grub\", and wound up with a much nicer boot menu, and can boot either OS.\n", "Q: Problems in Waking Mars 12.04-1 64bit The Game Waking Mars is great however once you get mid way thru the game you get to an area where there is a large oval shaped stone that is supposed to be emitting a signal, a dialogue takes place between npc and yourself, your then supposed to use some sort of software to scan for the signal..  at this point the screen becomes solid colours with LARGE coloured circles in the background and the mouse cursor becomes an X/Y coordinate cross graph.  \nYou can hear the game in the background but can do nothing any more to interact with anything.

Recently I had to install some new packages in my server, but the version of Ubuntu (10.10-maverick) is not supported anymore. So, when I tried with apt-get update, I got lots of 404 not found messages.\nI didn't know I could change the sources.list using the old-releases addresses, so I changed my sources.list with the repositories in the next newer supported version (11.10).\nI executed apt-get update, and it worked. Then I installed the new packages without problems. I could see some of the old packages (like libc, perl, etc) were updated too. \nUntil now, everything seems to work fine, but I don't know if this solution can give problems in the future. I'm a little afraid about this, because the server is on production and many people depend on the services on it. I don't want to install new packages using the new sources.list if I am going to get problems of libraries or similar.\nCan you help me? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: The correct way to upgrade an Ubuntu system to the next release is using do-release-upgrade. That tool downloads a set of upgrade scripts, different for each Ubuntu release, that will not just update your sources.list, but also tune some settings.\nYou said that you were on Maverick and then you skipped to Oneiric. This means that you have not run the Natty and Oneiric script sets. They are:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/natty/main/dist-upgrader-all/current/natty.tar.gz\n\n*http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/oneiric/main/dist-upgrader-all/current/oneiric.tar.gz\nYou can download and extract these two tarballs and examine the content, looking at the actions that the scripts would have performed. Note that you will find some uninteresting scripts, for example the Nvidia-related scripts (which, on a server, do not need to be run). It's safe to skip them.\nOnce you have identified the scripts that would have run if you did the upgrade correctly, you can try performing the actions of that scripts. Examining the scripts can also help you detect the potential problems that your upgrade may have introduced.\nBy the way, do test your server's services deeply. This is the only way to know for sure if everything works correctly. If everything works, then you don't have to worry (obviously, this sentence is true only if you have performed accurate and complete tests).\nFinally, I'd like to point you to the answer of this question: How to install software or upgrade from old unsupported release?. It's too late to apply the procedures described there, however the next time you'll know what to do.\n\nA: If you do a sudo apt-get upgrade or sudo apt-get dist-upgrade now it will pull all the new packages from 11.10, essentially upgrading you to 11.10.\n\nA: Ubuntu packages, unlike windows probably, run only specific versions only. For example, a package(an application) \"made for\" Ubuntu 10.04 will run only on 10.04 without hiccups. If you try to install this package on 11.10 or any higher or lower version, it may run but can cause dependency and likewise other errors. Therefore, it is recommended that you either upgrade to another LTS version, since your system is very much busy and can't be frequently upgraded or less recommended, continue using your old Ubuntu without updating and hence upgrading the packages. Installing packages belonging to a different version by modifying sources.list is, on my part, asking for trouble.\n\nA: I think I just made it by replacing some lines on repositories list /etc/apt/sources.list:\nit seems the server is not called archives.ubuntu.com but \nold-releases.ubuntu.com. I just replaced all the archives. entries by old-releases. leaving the rest as is.\nI also deleted us. entries.\nHope it works for you too.\n", "Q: how to create a live-usb for ubuntu from a lubuntu system I am using lubuntu 12.04 on my PC.

Leaving with same error notice. I have no idea. Searched many forums to find any solution but no use. Please suggest some solution or reason behind this disappearance of folders.\n\nA: It may be a matter of language. Folders like ~/Documents/, ~/Downloads/, ~/Desktop/, ~/Music/, ~/Pictures/ and ~/Videos/ get their names translated into the system language. For example, if your system language is set to French, the folder will be called  ~/Documents/, ~/Téléchargements/, ~/Bureau/, ~/Musique/, ~/Images/ and ~/Vidéos/. So you can check if these folders get their translated names into your system language.\nAnother idea :\nUnlike Windows, Linux is case sensitive with files and folder names. So if your username is \"Arun\" and not \"arun\", the /home/arun/Videos folder will not exist because of Linux case sensitivity (unlike the /home/Arun/Videos folder).\n", "Q: How to send an email when laptop battery is low?

When suspend or\nhibernate is called, several things happen:  \n1) The files in /etc/pm/config.d/* are evaluated in C sort order.\n These files can be provided by individual packages outside of\n pm-utils, and contain globally available configuration settings\n for pm-utils and the hooks.\n2) Each of the hooks in /etc/pm/sleep.d/* are executed in C sort\n order, with a command line argument of either \"suspend\" or \"hibernate\".\n3) The system suspends or hibernates.\n4) Some event happens to wake the machine up\n5) Each of /etc/pm/sleep.d/* are executed in reverse C sort order,\n with a command line argument of \"resume\" or \"thaw\".  \n\n*For more detailed information on how hooks work and how to write one,\nread HOWTO.hooks .  \n\n*For information on how to debug pm-utils, read README.debugging.  \nThat's it!  \n", "Q: Configure Python 2.7.3 interpreter in aptana studio?

I only want this to happen in the script so what switches should I use? I also want to reduce the output so it doesn't clog up the console. \n\nA: You need to use apt-get --yes. Quoting from the man page (man apt-get):\n\n-y, --yes, --assume-yes\nAutomatic yes to prompts; assume \"yes\" as answer to all prompts and run\n  non-interactively. If an undesirable situation, such as changing a held\n  package, trying to install a unauthenticated package or removing an\n  essential package occurs then apt-get will abort. Configuration Item:\n  APT::Get::Assume-Yes.\n\nFor example:\napt-get install --yes gedit\n\nTo reduce the output you can redirect it to /dev/null (only errors will be shown):\napt-get install --yes gedit > /dev/null\n\nTo make it produce zero output (not even print errors):\napt-get install --yes gedit &> /dev/null\n\nThen, if something goes wrong, you will be able to find information in /var/log/apt.\n", "Q: FlashBuilder 4 Linux -- Debugger disconnects after a while I am running ubuntu 12.04 64Bit, I have installed eclipse via the software center,  FlashBuilder for Linux and the flash debugger plugin as decribed here. everything is working fine accept that the debugg session is just disconnected after a while. No errors, nothing, just end. Here is the .log file of the project. I am using flash player 11.2. What could that be? Any Ideas how to fix this?

There are plenty of guides to get it working; they all say you need to add a few lines to the xorg.conf file. Here is an example of one suggestion on Ubuntu Forums:\n\n# RAT3 mouse\nSection \"InputClass\"\nIdentifier \"Mouse Remap\"\nMatchProduct \"Saitek Cyborg R.A.T.3 Mouse\"\nMatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\nOption \"ButtonMapping\" \"1 2 3 4 5 0 0 8 9 0 0 0 13 14\"\nEndSection\n\nThe mentioned configuration does not work. After opening a few windows, the same issues occur again. I have lost track of all of the countless guides, which all suggest adding a variation of the above configuration. I don't like this hit-or-miss game of searching for guides; I have no clue WHAT exactly that configuration is doing. I tried to look at the xorg website for information, but I can't find anything. The manual page for the xorg.conf file doesn't even mention \"InputClass\" or \"ButtonMapping\".\nI am willing to try another configuration if it worked for you. I would really like to understand what is going on here, though. I would greatly appreciate an explanation of what those settings are doing, or a link to documentation so I can try to fix it on my own. I am going to further look up documentation and will edit this post when I find anything.\n\nA: Well, I eventually determined that with the xorg.conf I mentioned above from Ubuntu Forums, it works until I press either of the mode buttons (one changed a colored LED, and another changes the sensitivity of the pointer). Using an answer to another askubuntu question about R.A.T.3 mice, I was able to figure out that buttons 10 through 14 correlate to those mode buttons. So in the above configuration, I changed 13 and 14 to 0's, and now it works! Here is the configuration I am currently using:\n\nSection \"InputClass\"\nIdentifier \"Mouse Remap\"\nMatchProduct \"Madcatz Mad Catz R.A.T.3 Mouse\"\nMatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\nOption \"ButtonMapping\" \"1 2 3 4 5 0 0 8 9 0 0 0 0 0\"\nEndSection\n\nThe functionality of the two mode buttons is preserved, as they operate with the mouse's on-board firmware. Although I changed the MatchProduct line, but it appears that the configuration works either way.\n\nA: The trick I found, after pursuing the same routes/dead ends as you, is that the MatchProduct value MUST match the actual product name as listed by xinput -list, like this:\nmetz@nnnnnnnnn:~$ xinput -list\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                      id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Mad Catz Mad Catz R.A.T.5 Mouse           id=10   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎣ Virtual core keyboard                     id=3    [master keyboard (2)]\n    ↳ Virtual core XTEST keyboard               id=5    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                              id=6    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                              id=7    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Chicony Saitek Cyborg Keyboard            id=8    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Chicony Saitek Cyborg Keyboard            id=9    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Microsoft® LifeCam Cinema(TM)             id=11   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ IR-receiver inside an USB DVB receiver    id=12   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n\nIn my case, the mouse is a R.A.T 5, but I suffered all the same issues (I beleive the RAT7 also suffers).\nI changed my settings exactly as you detailed above for the ButtonMapping, but I had to correct my MatchProduct as shown. I first tried to change it to \"Madcatz Mad Catz R.A.T.5 Mouse\"...but that didn't work. Changing it to \"Mad Catz Mad Catz R.A.T.5 Mouse\" worked fine. So that answer is...make sure the value of MatchProduct....matches...the....product ;):)\n\nA: I used the above lines suggested by drdrez (thanks btw) with lines someone else suggested.\nHit Ctrl+Alt+T for a terminal window:\nType sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf\nand inserted this:\nSection \"InputClass\"\nIdentifier \"Mouse Remap\"\nMatchProduct \"Madcatz Mad Catz R.A.T.3 Mouse\"\nMatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\nOption \"ButtonMapping\" \"1 2 3 4 5 0 0 8 9 0 0 0 0 0\"\nEndSection\n\n\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n       # generated from default\n       Identifier     \"Mouse0\"\n       Driver         \"evdev\"\n       Option         \"Name\" \"Saitek Cyborg R.A.T.3 Mouse\"\n       Option         \"Vendor\" \"06a3\"\n       Option         \"Product\" \"0ccc\"\n       Option         \"Protocol\" \"auto\"\n       Option         \"Device\" \"/dev/input/event4\"\n       Option         \"Emulate3Buttons\" \"no\"\n       Option         \"Buttons\" \"7\"\n       Option         \"ZAxisMapping\" \"4 5\"\n       Option         \"ButtonMapping\" \"1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\n       Option         \"Resolution\" \"3200\"\nEndSection\n\nFixed my RAT 3 mouse in Ununtu.\n", "Q: Import error when running update manager It seems like I am getting some error related to Python, but I am not sure why I am getting it.

It was here (Post #5)\nWhat I did was, in \"Edit Connections...\" delete all the existing connections and then add the wireless network manually. After reboot it keeps working :)\nThank you all for your replies! They helped a lot\n\nA: It could be your network router kicking you off. Have you checked to see if there are any IP address conflicts, or if you have the correct network ID? Here is how to check.\nIf you have another computer connected to the network running windows (7) open the network and sharing window. in the window look at your active network. click the network connection and look for your SSID, this is the network ID. Under details in the same window you should see the IPv4 address. It usually is something like 192.168.1.100. When you go back to your Ubuntu computer, click the network icon in the upper right, and select connection information to display your IP address. The number should be similar, but the last numbers have to be different (e.g. windows IP 192.168.1.100, Linux IP 192.168.1.102) If they match you need to change one. To check the network ID click the network icon and select edit connections. Select your wireless network, click edit, and the SSID should be displayed. It must match the one on the windows computer. If the Ip's are different and the SSID's match, then you have a different issue that I am not familiar with.\n\nA: There is a bug report report for this issue (Ubuntu 12.10):\nNM fails to connect Wi-Fi; dhclient works -- Intel Centrino Wireless-N 1000 iwlwifi \nThis suggests that Ubuntu is failing to issue iwconfig for this device / driver.\n\nPossible workaround: (from Post #40)\n\njerrylamos (jerrylamos) wrote on 2012-11-24: \nWorkaround since this bug is even worse with 3.7.0-3:\nStartup Applications\nAdd\nTitle: Connect\ncommand: ~/wl\n\nwhere wl is\n#!/bin/bash\nsudo iwconfig wlan0 essid LAUREL   { <-- your SSID }\nsudo dhclient wlan0\nexit 0\n\nHas worked O.K. for three boots so far.\nWhy can't Ubuntu issue the iwconfig??\n\n\nA: I found a different workaround with ndiswrapper, a tool that injects Windows XP's drivers in Ubuntu.  You can download it from http://sourceforge.net/projects/ndiswrapper/files/latest/download?source=files\nOnce you have downloaded the .tar.gz file, unpack it on the Desktop and follow all the instructions in INSTALL file.\nThere is a passage where it asks you to write \"ndiswrapper -l\" in the Terminal, and it says you should get \"driver present, hardware present\". If you get something like \"device (2001:3308) present (alternate driver: rtl8192cu)\", add the name of the alternate driver (in this case \"rtl8192cu\") to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\nTo do it, just type in Terminal \nsudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nand add \"blacklist rtl8192cu\" (rtl8192cu is the name of the driver I have, you should put the name of the driver YOU have) in a new line. Then just save and reboot. \nIf you followed correctly all the instructions in INSTALL file, the wifi key will use the Windows driver instead of the Linux driver.\n", "Q: How do I install and apply a theme for CairoDock? I just downloaded an OS X theme for CairoDock. I have already extracted it and put it in my documents folder (just so I know where it is). I am completely clueless on how to apply it. Thanks in advance!\n\nA: Open the folder where you have downloaded the tarball with the theme. Do not extract it.\nThen go to the Cairo Dock settings : right click on a dock > Cairo-Dock > Configure (first option). Once the configuration window is opened, go to the Themes tab (the last one) > Load a theme (first tab in the second of of tabs). On this tab there is a line which offers to drag and drop the tarball. So drag and drop your tarball for its folder to the text entry at the end of the line. You can also click on Open and select the tarball in the dialog window. Once you do it, click on Apply at the bottom of the window and your theme will be installed.\nYou can also install the themes which are on the list at the left side of the tab by selecting the theme and then click on Apply at the bottom.\nFor further informations, you can refer to these web pages :\n\n\n*\n\n*Cairo-Dock themes' French wiki page : http://glx-dock.org/ww_page.php?p=Gestion%20des%20th%C3%A8mes&lang=fr (fr)\n\n*Overview of Cairo-Dock themes : http://glx-dock.org/ww_page.php?p=Our%20Themes%20(an%20overview)&lang=en (en) or http://glx-dock.org/ww_page.php?p=Nos%20th%C3%A8mes&lang=fr (fr)\n", "Q: How does one install PlayOnLinux? How do I install PlayOnLinux on Ubuntu?\n\nA: Installing from the Ubuntu repository:\nPlayOnLinux is available from the default Ubuntu repositories on Ubuntu versions 12.04 and later.\nInstall it with\nsudo apt-get install playonlinux  \n\nThen click ➕ Install a program in PlayOnLinux and search for the Windows program that you want to install.\n\nHowever, if you want the latest version, you will need to add the PlayOnLinux repository.\nInstalling from the PlayOnLinux repository:\nThe following example is for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS\nwget -q \"http://deb.playonlinux.com/public.gpg\" -O- | sudo apt-key add -\nsudo wget http://deb.playonlinux.com/playonlinux_precise.list -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/playonlinux.list\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install playonlinux\n\nIf you want to ensure that you have the correct repo for your version of Ubuntu, or only want to install from the .deb file, you can check here: http://www.playonlinux.com/en/download.html\n", "Q: How do I ensure that all of my drives are mounted when I boot up? Here's my situation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 12.10\n\n*Several drives/partitions: 200gb partition on ssd, 20gb partition on ssd for Ubuntu, then some old hard drives and a dvd drive\n\n\nWhen I start up Ubuntu, I try to open up something like Sublime Text. It will look for the last loaded project, which is on the 200gb ssd partition, but it will fail to find it. So in Nautilus I check out /media/[user] and I see that only the DVD drive is listed in there. However, in the left menu in Nautilus it shows the drives are there. When I click on the 200gb ssd partition it seems to load it up for a second and then it shows the contents. Then when I immediately return to /media/[user], the 200gb partition is there and all is right in the world.\nI assume this has something to do with mounting drives, but I'm not sure. How do I get it to automatically load up without me having to navigate directly to the partition first?\nThanks!\n\nA: For the partition to be mounted during boot you need to add a line to /etc/fstab file, like this:\n# /etc/fstab: static file system information.\n#\n# <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>\nproc            /proc           proc    defaults        0       0\n# /dev/sda3\nUUID=b2d904e2-139c-498f-b076-d3a05a02902b /            ext4    relatime,errors=remount-ro 0       1\n/dev/scd0       /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto,exec,utf8 0       0\n/dev/sdb1       /mnt/disk       ext4    relatime,errors=remount-ro      0       1\n\nthe last line mounts /dev/sdb1 partition into /mnt/disk directory (which you will need to create manually first).\nSee man fstab for more details.\n", "Q: fax: efix segmentation fault I'm having some trouble getting efax to work on Ubuntu server 12.04.1 LTS\nSometimes fax send gives a 'terminated by signal' error and sometimes it appears to work, but it always gives the warning: 'only read 0 byte(s) from input file, assuming text'.

I want to write a script that obtains a list of all open programs and files, and then generates a shell script to re-open these files. For example, if I were editing the file example.txt using gedit, and editing the file myscript.js using geany, I would want to generate a script that could re-open both of these files using their respective programs.  Is there any way to obtain a list of running programs and files from the command line?\n\nA: Generally, it is not possible to do in the way you're approaching this, because the files opened in a text editor are not \"open\" in the sense programmers use the term (i.e. \"having an active file handle somewhere within the program which can be used for I/O operations\"). What most programs do is open the file, read the data in a memory buffer, then close the file. Saving a file is the same - open, write, close. Between open and save operations the file is not \"open\", it's just the copy of the data in the program's buffer in memory.\nSo it is generally not possible to figure out which files are currently loaded into the program's memory - however, the program itself does know that, so from inside the program it is trivial to implement an option to remember the list of open files on shutdown and re-open those files on startup. Many text editors, for example Kate and Sublime Text 2 do provide such option. \nSome desktop environments, such as KDE (and also the old Gnome, I'm not sure about Gnome 3/Unity) also provide an option to save the list of running programs on shutdown and re-launch those programs on startup. Which combined with using a good editor kinda achieves what you're trying to do.\n\nA: The command ps aux will display a list of running processes. In some cases, it will also list the files that are being edited with those programs, if the file name was used as a command line argument when starting the process. For example, I opened the file stuff.txt using gedit, and gedit /home/anderson/Desktop/stuff.txt was displayed in the output of ps aux.\n\nA: You can get a list of files opened with gedit today (July 1, 2020 in this case):\n$ grep 2020-07-01 /home/$USER/.local/share/recently-used.xbel\n\n  <bookmark href=\"file:///mnt/e/bin/scpto\" added=\"2020-06-27T00:32:22Z\" modified=\"2020-07-01T20:09:35Z\" visited=\"2020-06-27T00:32:23Z\">\n          <bookmark:application name=\"gedit\" exec=\"&apos;gedit %u&apos;\" modified=\"2020-07-01T20:09:35Z\" count=\"228\"/>\n  <bookmark href=\"file:///mnt/e/bin/reset-owner\" added=\"2020-06-30T12:51:15Z\" modified=\"2020-07-01T01:39:20Z\" visited=\"2020-06-30T12:51:15Z\">\n          <bookmark:application name=\"gedit\" exec=\"&apos;gedit %u&apos;\" modified=\"2020-07-01T01:39:20Z\" count=\"5\"/>\n\nThen call gedit and pass the filenames to it:\ngedit /mnt/e/bin/scpto /mnt/e/bin/scpto\n\n\nA: There is trick you can try [may be in gnome]\nthis show files opened by a process [may not currently using]\nHistory file \n\n/home/$USER/.local/share/recently-used.xbel\n\nmay help you.\n\n\n*\n\n*First take a copy of recently-used.xbel\n\n*Run process and exit [open file, close it. open file, close it and so on... and exit]\n\n*now compare recently-used.xbel with old recently-used.xbel\n\n*from the diff extract file name and associated process\nFor a DEMO just copy paste\ndiff <(cat ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel)  <(gedit /tmp/2.txt; cat ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel)\nfrom the output you can extract filename and process.\n", "Q: Any apps for hosting a terminal app as a website?

This would save me a lot of time. Surely, there must be an Ubuntu one-liner that can accomplish such a feat...\nThanks for any pointers!\n\nA: The problem is slightly more complicated than simply \"redirecting stdin/stdout\" to a port.\nWhat you need is basically a shell session to your server with a client which runs inside a browser. This answer links to two such shells, AjaxTerm and WebShell\n\nAjaxterm is a web based terminal. It was totally inspired and works\n  almost exactly like http://anyterm.org/ except it's much easier to\n  install\n\n\nWhat worries me a bit is that both programs were last updated in 2008, which in web-years like 50 years ago. Please report back if you manage to run any of them.\nA newer and seemingly more supported option is Shell In A Box:\n\nShell In A Box implements a web server that can export arbitrary\n  command line tools to a web based terminal emulator. This emulator is\n  accessible to any JavaScript and CSS enabled web browser and does not\n  require any additional browser plugins. Most typically, login shells\n  would be exported this way:  shellinaboxd -s /:LOGIN\nThis command starts a web server at http:// localhost :4200 that allows\n  users to login with their username and password and to get access to\n  their login shell. \nAll client-server communications are encrypted, if SSL/TLS\n  certificates have been installed.\n\nIt is even available in Ubuntu repositories and can be installed with\nsudo apt-get install shellinabox\n\n\nA: actually you can upload Application into your Launchpad account as PPA . All your clients can access the application by adding it's PPA .\nFor more information read these things \nPackaging\nCode\nOne more choice is you can upload your application into dropbox . \n\nA: Why not use Gate One?  It's a web-based terminal emulator.  You can configure it to automatically launch your terminal application whenever a user connects/opens a new terminal.

I was just wondering, is it efficient to have the entire Ubuntu file system on a Windows file.\nCurrently I am using the option to directly boot from Ubuntu, as opposed to running it as an application in Windows. Even so, I notice a slow boot and sluggish performance.\nJust to add, I am running a Dual Core, 1 GB RAM machine. Could the performance be slow due to low configuration of the machine. \n\nA: Looks like it's not efficient as the intallation still uses a single windows file to store all the stuffs, which surely is not efficient.\n", "Q: Permissions fail to change, even using sudo nautilus I've read a lot of threads here but still can't seem to make this work:  I'm trying to share various folders (any folders whatsoever) on HDDs other than \"File System\" over the LAN using fresh install of Ubuntu 12.04 with a fresh version of Apache installed.  Other (Win XP) computers can see the shared folders over the network no problem, but come up with the error:\n\"[Folder] is not accessible.  You might not have permission to use this network resource. Contact the administrator...\"  (The typical WinXP \"access denied\" message)\nSince I can see them alright, I've been led to believe that I need to set the folder permissions so that \"Others\" can read, if not read/write.  Since these are folders on completely different HDDs than my OS, I shouldn't be too afraid of changing permissions (right?).\nSo, even when I run sudo nautilus and go to the containing folder and right click -> properties -> permissions, I see:\nOthers\nFolder Access: None\nFile Access: ---\nWhen I change Folder Access (again, coming from nautilus window), it changes for about half a second and then revert.  When I change File Access, it stays in the drop-down, but doesn't stick after closing and re-opening properties. \"Allow executing file as program\" also instantly reverts.\nWhy?  (And thank you!)\n\nA: This problem has occurred to me too, but never bothered to correct it the GUI way. However, you can change the folder permissions, if that is the problem, by opening a terminal and then typing the following:chmod 775 <folder_name>This gives the normal folder permissions to the folder given by the name folder_name. If it asks you to be root, then prepend the command by sudo. To know more about the chmod command, have a quick look at this Wikipedia page, it gives a good detail and couples it with examples which can help you understand it better. To just know about the numerical options, have a look here. Hope this helps.\nEDIT: Added links to make it a little more explanatory.\n\nA: N.B. don't attempt this on your root directory. I'm assuming you are talking about a data directory owned by the user.\nI can't comment on the first (Windows-centric) part of the question, but I can tell you how to change permissions via the command line. You can give \"others\" read and write permissions using\nchmod -R o+wrX /path/to/directory\nThe -R flag is to make it recursive (i.e. repeat for all the contents of the directory. o means for others, and +wr means give them write and read permissions. X means give execute permissions only if it's a directory, which allows you to descend into that directory (the man page calls it \"search\"). Presuming you are the owner of the directory/files, you should not need sudo.\n", "Q: Where does Ubuntu store Desktop Environment options I'm currently working on a stripped-down purpose-built custom desktop environment on top of Ubuntu.

Sometimes a link has unicode characters in it, such as http://www.example.com/файл.zip\nIf you point your browser to it, it will properly prompt you to download the file as файл.zip. But if you try to do it with wget, the file comes with a mix of ?, percent encoding (like %D0%BB) and the (invalid encoding) string  after the filename.\nWhat parameters can I add to wget, or any other command line tricks, so that it behaves as Chrome and Firefox and saves the file exactly as specified in the rendered link - in this case, as файл.zip?\nThe solution should work without having to explicitly write it in the command, so an explicit wget -O файл.zip http://www.example.com/файл.zip is not a good solution.\nI realize that as soon as you run wget http://www.example.com/файл.zip it tries to retrieve http://www.example.com/%D1%84%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BB.zip, that is, it converts the link to percent encoding, which may be the reason why it saves it doesn't render the filename \"properly\". \nI posted a somewhat related question here, whose answer may or may not be of help to this one.\n\nA: You can use curl instead, as follow\ncurl -O http://www.example.com/файл.zip\n\nIt will save it to файл.zip.\n\nA: For wget, you can use:\nwget http://www.example.com/файл.zip --restrict-file-names=nocontrol\n\nif your system can handle UTF-8 or other encoding properly.\nFinally, if you still have those % symbols left in your downloaded file, you can use Python module urllib.unquote(filename) that will replace %xx escapes by their single-character equivalent.\n\nA: I couldn't find a way to solve this issue with wget but could successfully transfer the files with Midnight Commander.\n\nA: My answer is similar to the one posted by Balaji Purushotham.\nI had to add .parse to get this working in python:\nimport wget\nwget.download(urllib.parse.unquote(url), destination_file)\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 on Samsung Galaxy?

If you also have lines with a filename, a colon, and contents of the file, then it was found that that might be where it's being set. It also might not be.\nYou can expand your query by removing the = character; just be aware you're more likely to have false positives, where the variable is being used but not being set.\nIf that fails...\nIf you still cannot find it, you can try setting the variable yourself. See:\n\n*\n\n*How do I set environment variables?\n\n*Setting the PATH so it applies to all users, including root/sudo (not limited to PATH)\n\nIf it gets set after it's set by whatever mechanisms are currently doing it, you can replace its value with whatever you want (and that can be a reordered version of what it currently is).\nIf you try this and it either does nothing or you find it contains the text you gave it, with other text before or after it (or some before and some after), then at least this will give you information about when it's being set, compared to when it gets set by whatever method you choose to use.\nIf text in the wrong order is tacked on just to the end of the variable as you set it, that's annoying but it's equivalent so long as all the same directories are part of your previously ordered path. (All that matters is where a directory first appears in the path, because after it's not matched there, it won't be matched anywhere else either.)\nIf you can provide more information about why you need to do this, that might make it easier to figure out better ways of discovering what is currently setting it, and that might make it possible for a suggestion to be made about how best to set it yourself.\nThis answer applies to other environment variables, too.\nBut, for some variables, like PATH, there are a few places that almost always set it, so a similar problem with that might be easier to solve.\n", "Q: How to use Intel N2800 / GMA 3650 in 12.10?

Its size is approximately equals the hard-disk size and it is almost free, so it seems like all the data is lost.\nCould anyone please help me on this? Would it be possible to recover the lost data?\n\nA: You may use testdisk.\nFirst and foremost stop using the system!\nBoot a live DVD or live USB, install testdisk and run it. Try the Recover partitions option.\nIt's your best bet.\n\nA: The important part right now is to stop using the system and get your hands on a live cd. If you installed Ubuntu from CD then you already have one. I don't believe (and Andrea Corbellini confirms this below) that Ubuntu does a hard format of the drive, it just creates partitions (this is a guess). The data that was not overwritten should be recoverable. Assuming that C was the first partition for previous Windows system, other two partitions should be towards the end of the disk, so at least some data should be intact.\nAlso, I find the option to Replace Windows confusing and I understand the mistake of Vikram. Replace Windows for me means that the installer understands there is a windows installation, where it is located and that it can replace it and only it, without destroying the data in other partitions. Again, I'm assuming the new-comer perspective here.\nNick\n\nA: I agree with Aditya, replacing win7 you made repartitioning your HDD.\nYou can use R-STUDIO for restoring data.\nI recommend to use Live image.\nFor example Alkid Live CD/DVD/USB or something similar.\n\nA: with Live CD first create the image of your hard disk..\nFire up the terminal and run:\ndd if=/dev/sdX of=/dev/sdY conv=noerror  \n\nwhere X is your hard drive and Y is the external drive in which you are creating image ..\nand after the image creation .. mount the image in any linux system and do the recovery..\n", "Q: Can I make my Ubuntu make sounds when I press Caps Lock etc.? On the computer upstairs we have an option to make the computer make a sound when we press Caps Lock, Number Lock and Scroll Lock.

I went looking, did not change anything and that was that.

What worked for me was to put a \"good\" xorg.conf file into \n/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/\nand reboot or log out and back in.\nI still haven't figured it out entirely, but I believe that upon startup, Ubuntu  looks there for any X setting overrides. Having an entire xorg.conf file there is probably not the idea, but it worked for me.\nI believe that the problem is, that the settings managers from Nvidia or Ati save their changes to /etc/xorg.conf but Ubuntu does not update any of its own files dynamically... something like that.\nSorry if this is not a scientifically correct solution, but I believe it could be a work-around or at least give you some pointers for further investigation.\nDrTebi\n\nA: FYI, I was having this problem with Xubuntu 12.04, and none of the fixes for Nvidia Xserver did the trick. I ensured I ran nvidia-settings as root, regenerated xorg.conf, changed the xinit files, edited xorg.conf manually (using \"TwinViewOrientation\" in every imaginable way, as well as playing with the offsets). I reinstalled the driver twice (and somehow managed to lock my user account out in the process?) and re did all of the aformentioned fixes. I pretty much tried everything I could find by searching for problems with Nvidia Xserver dual monitor and persistent settings.\nIn the end, moderately hungover me approached the problem from a different angle: I just searched for other ways to use dual monitors in Xubuntu. \"How to use multiple monitors in Xubuntu\" did the trick for me. Basically I installed what it said and generated the script for use in startup applications, completely side-stepping the nvidia-settings and xorg.conf trouble.\n", "Q: Headphones not working in Ubuntu 12.10 I've tried multiple ways to solve my problem as described in other topics in this forum, but none succeeded.

If I am not mistaken, programs like Spotify or Steam are not included in any of the Ubuntu repositories (main, restricted, ...). And I guess they will never be?\nCorrect me if I am wrong. \nIf I am right, is there a ppa that provides a collection of closed-source, non-free software and takes care of updates?\n\nA: First of all, a PPA is just one form of a software repository. PPAs are special ones, as they're hosted on Launchpad and must comply with the rules there. A general software repository (privately hosted) can hold whatever packages someone put in there.\nPPAs\n\nIs there a ppa that provides a collection of closed-source, non-free software?\n\nNo, PPAs will accept source-only uploads as a policy, by design. The binaries will be built \"in the cloud\" of Launchpad and both binaries and sources are published in the PPA. So, unless Spotify or Steam are releasing all relevant code (and comply with all packaging+licensing requirements), it will not be possible to publish this in a PPA.\nPlease refer to \"How do I submit a binary?\" on Launchpad and this very similar question: \"Can I upload binary packages to a Launchpad PPA?\".\nAbusing PPAs\nAs mentioned by @dobey, one could make a source package consisting of binary blobs (precompiled binaries), with no need to compile at Launchpad anymore. However, this is rather a hack and outside the terms of use for Launchpad PPAs. source in \"source package\" does not mean anything in such a case. Having several of these packages to just to \"collect\" several pieces of software for the convenience will not exist very long.\nOther types of repositories\nSoftware vendors can (and already do) publish this in a private (binary-only) repositories (e.g.Google Linux repositories), or, Canonical may include them in the extras and/or partner repositories. This is how Skype and Adobe Flash Player are being distributed by an \"official\" Canonical-maintained repository, easily accessible for all Ubuntu users. Also, the MyApps project as proposed by @dobey is an example for a way closed-source software can be maintained in a repository. However, for MyApps, this has to be on the initiative of the vendors.\n\nA: There is no specific PPA for finding such applications. If you wish to find proprietary applications, you should look in the Software Center.\nThis is exactly what MyApps publishing to the Ubuntu Software Center is for. If you have a proprietary app you'd like to see available on Ubuntu, you should suggest to its maker or publisher, that it should be published in MyApps. Alternatively, if you own some proprietary software which you'd like to make available to Ubuntu, then you should do so via MyApps.\n\nA: \nIf I am not mistaken, programs like Spotify or Steam are not included\n  in any of the Ubuntu repositories (main, restricted, ...).

Juju is the effort to have scripts to make deployment of specific node-types easier.  \nDo I think Landscape will leverage a lot of Juju scripts?  Yes, but provisioning isn't all it does.  \nMySQL is a separate product from the Oracle database.  They acquired it AFTER they had a functional high-end product.  Let's leave that one out.  Examine Virtualbox instead.  Virtualbox OSE has a lot of features, enough to make it usable.  If you want USB passthrough, you need the non-open-source parts.

They analyze it, and post the answer.\nWhat is this syslog, and how can it help me solve problems with my system?\n\nA: There are many software packages that can provide system logging. Ubuntu is using the package rsyslog. Its configuration files are located in /etc/rsyslog.conf and /etc/rsyslog.d/*. The configuration files define which system messages to log, which directories to store messages, and which files to record different portions of system messages. As with the majority of Unix and Linux, the system log files are recorded in the files located in the directory, /var/log/.\nBy examining these files, we can learn what is happening with the software on the system. For example, auth.log records user authentication events, boot.log records boot events, syslog records all messages except authentication events (in the default configuration).\nTo examine a log file in real time: tail -f /var/log/syslog\nTo find cron-related messages: grep cron /var/log/syslog\nTo learn more about system logging from the command line:\napropos syslog\n\nThis command, apropos, will try to return relevant manual pages for the term syslog.\nIt will return a reference for rsyslogd and its configuration files. \nThere is also a good Wikipedia article on the topic.\n", "Q: /var/www permission problem \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhats the simplest way to edit and add files to “/var/www”? \n\nI'm fairly new to Ubuntu, and Linux in particular.

I will be managing my project locally.\n\nA: Instead of making your files world open, you can use ACL to give one of your groups the permissions to the whole subtree. ACL are more flexible than regular permissions in my opinion and a default rule can be used to apply to new files/directories.\nsudo apt-get install acl\n\nTo use, you have the command setfacl and getfacl\nman acl will explain the concept and man setfacl will give you all the use ptions but here is a suggestion:\nsudo setfacl -Rm d:g:<your-user-main-group>:rwX,g:<your-user-main-group>:rwX /var/www\n\nWill give your main group rw permissions and x on the directories (to enter them).\n-R: recursive\n-m: modify existing rule (the actual permissions)\n\nd:g:<...>:rwX = default part for new files, group permissions\ng:<...>:rwX   = applied to the existing files/directories\nrwX           = read, write and change directory allowed (rwx will allow file execute too)\n\nIf you prefer, instead of using your main group (if you have other users for example), you can create a group (webdev for example) and use it:\nsudo addgroup webdev\nsudo adduser your-user webdev\n\nand use webdev group in the acl instead of your-user-main-group\nObs: you can also use ACLs with users (u:) or others (other:) instead of groups.\n", "Q: How do I configure 'Natural Scrolling' with an Apple Magic Mouse?

Katies-iMac:~ KatieBaer$ sudo dd if=/Users/KatieBaer/Downloads/ubuntu-12.04.1-desktop-i386.dmg of=/dev/rdisk4 bs=1M\n\nWARNING: Improper use of the sudo command could lead to data loss\nor the deletion of important system files. Please double-check your\ntyping when using sudo. Type \"man sudo\" for more information.\n\nTo proceed, enter your password, or type Ctrl-C to abort.\n\nPassword:\n\nI'm hoping someone knows what this is and there is a simple solution.\n\nA: To create a USB flash drive using Mac OS X, so that you can boot from it and install Ubuntu on your Mac (or another machine), you have to perform administrative tasks. When you perform an administrative task with a graphical program (i.e., outside of Terminal.app), you are prompted for your password. You've almost certainly seen this before--when you install certain software, or when you install updates or modify global settings in System Preferences, you're prompted for your password.\nThis is the same sort of thing, but in the Terminal. If you want to proceed and perform the task in your command, you'll enter your password (the same one you'd use to log on to your Mac OS X system or to perform any of those administrative tasks graphically as discussed above). As you enter it, you won't see any placeholder characters (like *). That's by design. Just put it in and press Enter.\nsudo will work essentially the same way in your Ubuntu system as well. (And like in Mac OS X, in Ubuntu most likely you'll be performing most administrative tasks graphically, so you'll get graphical password prompts like you do most of the time in Mac OS X.)\nYou should understand what sudo does and why that warning is displayed before proceeding, though.\nThis message appears normally, the first time you use sudo, on some versions of Mac OS X (and maybe some other OSes too):\nWARNING: Improper use of the sudo command could lead to data loss\nor the deletion of important system files. Please double-check your\ntyping when using sudo. Type \"man sudo\" for more information.\n\nTo proceed, enter your password, or type Ctrl-C to abort.\n\nIt is not, in and of itself, anything to worry about. It's just warning you that sudo is very powerful, and that you can do just about anything with it...including things that you do not want to do and that would prevent your Mac OS X system, or other systems, from booting up until repaired or reinstalled. You could also accidentally wipe out important files such as your documents.\nThat warning is not in response to the particular commmand you are running. It could have been sudo ls and you would still have seen it.\nHowever, it turns out that particular command is especially dangerous if done wrong. What you're doing with that command is to write the data from the file specified after if= (the input file) to the device specified after of= (the output \"file\").\nThis will overwrite whatever data currently exist on of= (if any), and it's unlikely you could get those data back again. Unless, of course, you have a copy somewhere else.\nSo not only is it important you're not overwriting valuable data...but it is also important that you specify the correct output device, or you could overwrite another device altogether (perhaps an important hard disk).\n\n\n*\n\n*I once typed in a sudo dd ... command, check to make sure the device was correctly specified and that the device didn't contain any important information, ran it ...and then less than a second later realized that the command prompt I used was actually a remote login to a different computer! I cancelled it immediately, but even the small amount I did overwrite made it so the partition wouldn't be mountable again, and required me to copy the data off to another disk and consult my partial backup. And the main factor that saved me was excellent luck.\n\n\nYou're not likely to be making that specific error, but just make sure the command is correct, the device is correct, and there's no data you want to keep that is stored on the device.\nPlease note that any sudo command is potentially dangerous if you make a mistake but dd commands tend to be just about the most dangerous if you make a mistake. You shouldn't be reluctant to explore and experiment on either your Mac OS X or your Ubuntu system...just be careful.\nI highly recommend reading Ubuntu's community documentation on sudo to understand how it works and what to keep in mind while using it. As many of the same considerations were taken by Apple developers when they decided how to set up sudo in Mac OS X, and because sudo is a standard command, with all OS-specific variants changing very little (if anything) from Todd C. Miller's upstream code, most of the information there applies to Mac OS X and other OSes, as well as to the Ubuntu system you're about to install.\n", "Q: Oracle Java javac runtime error I have been trying to install Oracle Java 7 on Ubuntu 11.04.

Detail is here.\n\nA: I haven't looked at the source for either of these, but if they allow specifying an install prefix (usually something like ./configure --prefix /opt/pencil-2d) then you could install them in a way that avoids them conflicting.\nHowever, this is likely to be a problem that other people run into too, and it really should be fixed at the root. Pencil is clearly too generic a name. Ideally we should persuade one or both of the projects to use a less generic name. This is something that comes up every now and then, and the best long-term solution is upstream renaming.\nIf these were packaged for Debian/Ubuntu, they'd have to be modified to have different names (there can only be one /usr/bin/pencil), and store their data in different places. Other distributions would probably rename them differently, and then we end up with a situation where the applications behave differently on different distributions. This makes it harder for the upstreams to support their users.\nSo, it sounds like you need to talk to both of them, and get them to come up with less generic names. I suggest filing bugs with both, saying that the can't be co-installed with the other project. If the projects don't have a bug-tracker, mail their development mailing list / contact the authors however they like being contacted.\n", "Q: How to boot Ubuntu without a monitor plugged in?

Set 1 to HDD, and 2 to CD and see if it makes a difference.\n", "Q: How to boot Ubuntu from SSD drive which cannot be selected as boot device? I have freshly installed Ubuntu 12.10 (64 bits) on an Asus S405CM-WX117H laptop (similar to this one) which features a 24GB SSD drive and a regular 500GB hard drive.\nI placed the / (ext4) root file system in the SSD drive and partitioned the regular hard drive with 10GB swap and the rest as ext4 for /home. It installed smoothly without errors, but when it restarted, I seem not to be able to boot Ubuntu (I have nothing else there).\nTo verify the installation was successful, I checked it using a live Ubuntu (DVD) and both hard drives are recognized and the files from the new system are there. The order of the disk as recognized in Ubuntu is: sda = 500 GB SATA hdd, sdb = 24GB SSD. Would it help my boot issue if I would be able to make Ubuntu swap the drive name assignments?\nIn the BIOS both hard drives are listed, yet I can only choose to use the regular hard drive as a boot device, for some reason I don't understand. It simply doesn't let me boot from the SSD drive.\nI know that if I would install Ubuntu on the 500GB disk, it would probably boot just fine, but I want it in the SSD for obvious performance reasons. Any idea on how I could fix this?\n\nA: \nIn the BIOS both hard drives are there, but I can only choose to use the 500gb disk to boot somehow.\n\nYour OEM system vendor Asus probably placed the 24GB SSD drive for caching purposes, e.g. Intel Smart Response. This could explain why you can't set it as a boot drive. I suffer from the same issue in my HP laptop with an mSATA SSD slot and HP's response to this is \"this is intentional\".\nMy suggestion is to use your regular hard drive as the initial boot device, but to install the whole Ubuntu OS on the SSD. To do this, perform a regular installation, but configure an advanced partition layout like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a small partition (say 200MB) on your regular HDD for /boot.\n\n*Put / on the SSD.\n\n*Make sure the bootloader (Grub) is installed on the hard drive.\n\n*Optionally use the rest of the free space of hard drive as another mount point (e.g. /data  or /home1)\n\n\nThis way your regular hard drive will only contain the kernel and initramfs for the initial boot stage, which is loaded within seconds. The speed in that is not significantly slower compared to an SSD due to only a few sequential reads in that stage. The kernel and initramfs will then move on to your / on the SSD and boot your system in about the same time as booting directly from SSD.\nOne downside of this approach is that your system will fail to boot even if just one of the drives fails.\n1I would not recommend putting /home on the regular hard disk. Your home folder contains a lot of small files for which an SSD will help in speeding things up. I suggest to leave /home within /, use a separate /data for your hard disk and use symbolic links for folders with large files (e.g. /home/myusername/Music -> /data/Music.\n\nA: There are two possible mistakes:\n\n\n*\n\n*You must invert the disk order, like you said, in the BIOS.\n\n*Probably you selected the wrong disk for the boot, when you were installing.\n\n\nAbout point 2, try booting from the pen you used to install Ubuntu and see if it goes to your SSD installation.\nIf none of these work, re-install Ubuntu and when it goes to the partitioning, amke sure you select the boot device correctly.

While this configuration file exists, X will use the driver specified in it rather than auto-detecting your hardware setup.  You can see how this would be problematic when you switch back to your integrated graphics adapter; the AMD/Nvidia proprietary driver is still specified in the xorg.conf file.\nThe way to safely revert back to your integrated graphics adapter is to delete the xorg.conf file:\n$ sudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\nAlternately, you may rename the file such that it can no longer be found by X:\n$ sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup\n\nOn your next boot, when no xorg.conf file is detected, the X system will again auto-detect your hardware configuration and load the appropriate open source driver.\n\nA: Currently there is no solution for this problem.

So I just pressed that key combination and the external monitor immediately was turned on.\nEDIT:\nThough the key combination to enable the external monitor works, you'll have to repeat this every time you reboot. I found a way to have the external monitor automatically detected and enabled at the login screen (after a reboot). And when you login, the previous settings for your monitors are restored, as you would expect. Here's how to do it:\nNote: I only tested this with an Nvidia card. And before you continue, I recommend you install SSH first (sudo apt-get install ssh) to be safe. In the case something goes wrong and both internal and external monitor stop working, you can always undo whatever you did by logging in from another computer via SSH (e.g. ssh user@192.168.1.12). So make sure you know the IP address of your computer in the network.\n\n\n*\n\n*First of all, run sudo apt-get install v86d in a terminal to install the v86d package.\n\n*Run gksu gedit /etc/initramfs-tools/modules or sudo vim /etc/initramfs-tools/modules and add the following line at the end of the file (replace 1280x1024 by the resolution of your internal monitor):\n\nuvesafb mode_option=1280x1024-24 mtrr=3 scroll=ywrap\n\nsave and exit.\n\n*Create the file /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/splash by running gksu gedit /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/splash or sudo vim /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/splash with the following content:\n\nFRAMEBUFFER=y\n\nsave and exit\n\n*Now you need to update the initramfs image because we changed some configurations. Do this by runnning sudo update-initramfs -u.\nNow reboot your system and your external monitor should get a signal as soon as the Ubuntu login screen appears.\n\nA: I used nvidia-settings command to enable external monitor (selected TwinView mode). Note native \"Gnome Classic\" Displays configuration dialog did not detect external monitor. This was on Ubuntu 12.04.\nMartin\n\nA: I had a similar problem on an Ubuntu 12.04 desktop with an Geforce GT 640 (Baby Kepler version) and the nVidia 310 drivers. When disconnecting and reconnecting a second monitor, in all trials expect one, the monitor seemed to be working properly: correct EDID, detecting monitors works properly, mouse moves off screen to other monitor's area, nvidia-settings reports proper info for both monitors. \nHowever, the monitor reports 'no signal', displays no image, and otherwise acts as if it was stuck in dpms suspend mode. Disconnecting the monitor also worked as expected, and the system would reconfigure for single monitor mode.\nIssuing:\nsudo vbetool dpms on\n\nresolved the issue. Of course if you don't have vbetool installed, you'll need to run:\nsudo apt-get install vbetool\n\nto install it. I suspect in my case a reboot or logging in and out would have also fixed my issue, but since it was resolved by the above command I didn't get to test that thoery (nor do I really want to, of course). note that various actions in nvidia-settings (such as changing resolution, enabling/disabling various monitors, and so on) had no effect.\n\nA: 9 years after...\nI'm using Ubuntu 20.04 I'm getting the same behavior with an Mesa Intel® UHD Graphics (CML GT2).\nUsed the temporary workaround Fn + F7\n\nA: I had same problem, it was related to max possible throughput of USB docking station. The solution was to manually set refresh rate of monitor to lower value (i.e. max refresh rate for given monitor is 144 Hz, and I needed to limit it to 60 Hz)\nPlease note, that when having connected only one monitor, its max rate can be higher than when working with two monitors. So, when you set 1st monitor to 144 Hz, then connect 2nd monitor, then 1st or 2nd could stop displaying properly. If you have 3 monitors, there could be even more problems, so resolution or refresh rate might be needed to be limited even more.\nExample (my setup):\n1st monitor is 2460 x 1440 max 144 Hz.

To rule out whether the Nvidia drivers are the problem, try removing them:\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia*\n\nThen make sure your system has the open-source version:\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-nouveau\n\nThen restart, and your laptop will be running the nouveau open-source drivers. If your monitor works after that, you know the binary drivers are suspect; because you said it has been working, a recent update may have broken the multi-display functionality.\n\nA: I was facing the same problem with an external monitor connected to my laptop's USB-c port using HDMI to USB-c adapter/dock. Nothing else worked so finally I just decided to swap the USB-c port.

But even after installing the drive, it doesn't show up at all. the driver install successfully. How do i make the wireless card(chipset) communicate with ubuntu. \n\nA: I own an HP650 which came with preinstalled SUSE Linux Enterprise Novell.\nThe wireless card on this laptop is the Ralink 539a. The driver/module for this wlan card loaded by the kernel is the rt2800pci. The problem ofcourse is that by default they do not work or if they work its unstable and practicly unusable. After reading many threads and following a lot of different lines to build the 2011_1007_RT5390_RT5392_Linux_STA_V2.5.0.3_DPO the result was never successful failing either at the build with >make returning an error for Antenna being changed to y for yes or the driver not starting the wlan0 interface if the Antenna switch remains n for off.\nLater I found a bug report and exchange specificly for the Ralink 539a where the solution to the problem was finallzy found. Essentially 1. Download latest Compat-Wireless drivers from http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Download/stable/#compat-wireless_3.6_stable_releases 2. Unpack to a directory 3. cd to directory 4. sudo make 5. sudo make install 6 reboot your computer 7. make sure the wireless card light/led is on by using the wireless on/off button....\nThat did it for me. A note I also read is that any time the kernel or drivers are updated the old rt2800pci driver/module gets unpacked and thus the wireless gets back to not working .... So the same procedure of make and make install to overwrite with the compat.wireless drivers that work is to be done...\nGood luck\n", "Q: DVI Monitor and HDMI TV on Intel HD4000 Some please help!

I found that running the script from bash_completion works as far as I can tell.  Is this an acceptable solution, is there a better way? I am using ubuntu 12.10 64-bit.  Also the script sets LD_LIBRARY_PATH so I can't place it in many common locations or else LD_LIBRARY_PATH gets erased.\n\nA: I think that /etc/profile is a better place if you want it for all users in the system.

I don't know if my question makes sense, but I am asking anyway if there is actually an answer.\nFrom what I have read, a regular install performs better when compared to Wubi install.\nMy question is, is it possible to make a regular install on a Windows XP system, without using Wubi. If so, what is the procedure to do this?\n\nA: You do not need to do anything previous to simply just inserting the LiveCD or LiveUSB (Assuming this is what you call Regular install) of Ubuntu and just let the Ubuntu install process guide you.\nIt will tell you if you need to partition and let you adjust the size to the one you need. The LiveCD/LiveUSB of Ubuntu is very easy to use and will let you do the following things while you go through the installation process:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create, Resize, Delete partitions (It will not delete or damage a Windows partition if you don't want to)\n\n*Import Windows user accounts (Like Administrator)\n\n*Let you take a webcam picture for your Ubuntu user logo\n\n*Setup all proprietary drivers if you select them in the installation process (To listen to MP3 songs, see some type of videos that use special codecs, see flash player enabled web sites, etc..)\n\n*Encrypt your home folder, partition or hard drive\n\n*Give you helpful hints while installing\n\n*Will serve as a way to checking how Ubuntu will behave before installing it\n\n*Only way right now to install Ubuntu if you had Windows 8\nIn your case, with Windows XP, just insert the LiveCD / LiveUSB, boot from it and enjoy the show. It is even easier than installing Windows XP.\n\nA: You can use disk manager in XP to make a partiton just don't format it with a filesystem. Link http://support.microsoft.com/kb/309000\n\nA: First you need to un-install the Ubuntu version that was installed using the windows installer, and then defrag the windows partition, and then Just boot up a Live usb or DVD (do this by selecting the device you want to boot from in the bios of boot menu). If you want to duel boot just select install Ubuntu alongside Windows xp, and I would give Ubuntu at-least 40gb of disc space when you are prompted to select the partition size.\n** Important** after the install is complete, and you want to boot xp  make sure you allow it to do an error check if prompted, if not it's a good idea to do it after xp boots. \nI hope this helps.\n", "Q: howto use Webb Apps feature \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I use Ubuntu’s web application integration? \n\nOk, I've just decided to try Ubuntu distro.

Now I would like FileBot to rename them using the 'find' command, since it (filebot) doesn't seem to support regular expressions. How would I have bash pull a file-name-variable (not sure if this is a thing haha) and use it in find -exec \"$FILENAME\" kind of pattern?\nHere is what I have (pseudo is commented out), I'm sure there's a more efficient way to do this. But hey, I'm a python coder NOT a bash scripter!\nmkdir \"Movies\"\nfind \"Complete/\" -iname \"*.mkv\" -exec mv {} \"Movies\" \\;\n#find \"Movies/\" -iname \"*.mkv\" -exec filebot -rename \"$iname\" --db themoviedb\"\n\nI need the mv and filebot commands to execute separately as eventually more commands will be called between them. \n\nA: Firstly, for the second line, mv takes wildcards too, so you can simply use\n\nmv Complete/*.mkv Movies\n\nIs it possible that filebot also takes wildcards? i.e. filebot Movies/*.mkv? Otherwise, instead of \"$iname\", you just want {} again. As you probably know, {} substitutes for the name of the file found, which is the same as *.mkv here.  Hence,\n\nfind \"Movies/\" -iname \"*.mkv\" -execdir filebot -rename {} --db themoviedb \\;\n\nN.B. use -execdir instead of -exec for security reasons. From the man page:\n\nThere are unavoidable security problems surrounding use of the -exec action; you should use the -execdir option instead.\n-execdir command {} +\nLike -exec, but the specified command is run from the subdirectory containing the matched file, which is not normally the directory in which you started find.  This a much more secure  method\n                for  invoking  commands,  as  it  avoids  race conditions during resolution of the paths to the matched files.\n\n", "Q: Shortcut to switch to app Is it possible to focus an opened app instance/window using a command?\nI'd like to assign a keyboard shortcut as to quickly switch to a specific app.\nI want shortcuts for:\n\n\n*\n\n*chromium (now it opens a new window with blank tab)\n\n*terminator (now it opens a new window)\n\n\nIt works fine for these (running the default command, eg. thunderbird):\n\n\n*\n\n*thunderbird\n\n*sublime text 2\n\n\nI am using gnome-shell @ 12.04 (shouldn't matter)\n\nA: You can use Ubuntu's Super+1 to 9 to switch to your app. Press the Super key for three seconds to see the number for each tray icon.\nTo prevent the app's the number key from changing, you can lock the icons to the Launcher (right-click icons for menu, then choose lock).\n\nA: The wmctrl package offers access and manipulation of application windows and would do what you want. Install this little package first:\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\nHere is the man page for wmctrl:\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man1/wmctrl.1.html\nWhen you look at the command line switches, you will see that -a will raise and focus a window. In order to know which window to focus, make sure you have a Chromium window open, and then run\nwmctrl -l\n\nThis will give you a list of all open windows and their titles. Chromium will most likely always have \"Chromium\" in the end of it's window title, so you can use that. \nWith this information at hand, you can construct your command for the shortcut. Open the Keyboard preferences, go to Shortcuts, click on Custom Shortcuts, click the + sign and enter:\nName: Focus Chromium Shortcut\nCommand: wmctrl -a 'Chromium'\n\nI am using Unity and just tried this with Google Chrome, it did the trick. It should work in Gnome-Shell as well.\nPretty cool idea :)\nDrTebi\n\nA: A few years ago, I created a small application called mcgr exactly for this purpose. It originally worked only with the Metacity windows manager, but I later adapted it for Gnome.\n\nA: I use the following simple script for this. It raises all Windows with the matching title (or tag). \nRun like this for instance:\nwinfocus.sh chrome\n#!/bin/sh\n\nif [ \"\" = \"$1\" ] ; then\n    echo \"usage $0 Window title\"\n    exit 1;\nfi\n\nwmctrl -lx | grep -i \"$1\" |cut -d' '  -f1 | while read id; \n   do wmctrl -i -a $id; \ndone\n\nI have added some Ubuntu keyboard shortcuts to execute this script, so that Super+C raises all Chrome and Super+T displayes all terminal windows. Works really nice I think.\n\n", "Q: Use clonezilla without booting from the clonezilla live cd? I have two hard drives, /dev/sda and /dev/sda. Predictably, I boot from sda.

Just go through the installation description.\n\nA: To get a copy of the command you \"would\" have used, go all the way through the process and then at the end, hit go to command prompt, then cd into /tmp and there should be a file called ocs-FILENAMEYOUCHOSE. Nano it and copy its contents. That is the command.

I am thinking of getting a dual Intel Xeon machine, each CPU is a quad core.  Will Ubuntu utilize both processors, especially with both being quad core, optimally? \nWanting to do Video editing and processing, but the Xeon machine's clock speed is actually slower than my current computer, so if both procs are not being used, I will actually end up with a slower machine than I already have.  I am not too familiar with dual processor machines. Thanks in advance for any answers.\n\nA: Yes, Ubuntu is more than capable of using the Xeon PC you want to buy and detect all CPUs (Physical and Threads). It can also detect, as far as I have tested 4 sockets (4 CPUs) but the kernel version that Ubuntu uses can detect even more. For this case I would suggest the 64 Bit version so you can max out on the performance benefit of all CPUs. Of course, this will also depend on the video editing tools you use. If they are not compatible with running multiple processors, then you will not see much improvement. I for one use for example Handbrake which takes advantage of multiple processors but at the end it all depends on:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using 64 Bit version of Ubuntu for performance benefits when using multiple processors\n\n*Using a video editing app that can actually use multiple processors when doing any processing work.\n\n\nRecommend reading this questions I just found:\nIs Ubuntu optimized for multicore CPUs?\nFor better performance should I install 32-bit or 64-bit?\nUnderstanding machine config, multiprocessor or multi-core or both?\nAnd others found in the tag multi-core\n", "Q: Dumping a list of corrupt video files & quality Having trouble finding a solution to this. I have a folder with a few thousand movies in it, and maybe 20-30 are corrupt. I'm trying to find a way to list these corrupt files (NOT delete them). They are named nicely, and all located in one directory (/media/NS02/Movies/*) \nI found that XBMC cannot find quality information of these files, and tried dumping a list of the damaged ones to no avail. I also tried using mediainfo. I'm particularly interested in this approach, as I would also like printed a list of videos that aren't 720P (separately).\nThe video files are MKV, MP4 and avi. I am not particularly worried about getting AVI quality. How could I achieve these? I prefer CLI approaches. \n\nA: I'm not sure about the behaviour of corrupt video files. I'll just give suggestions for possible behaviours.\nWill these files not play at all? Or will the playback crash somewhere in the middle of the movie?\nIf it is the former, you can try mplayer -vo null -ao null on a file, make sure that mplayer doesn't quit in the first 2-3 seconds, kill mplayer and move to the next. Should be easy enough to script and shouldn't take more than an hour for 1000 movies.\nIf it is the latter, again there are two possibilities.\n\n\n*\n\n*mplayer cannot seek to any position beyond the crash point.\n\n*mplayer can seek to a position beyond the crash point and play smoothly.\n\n\nCase 1 can be handled by opening a file with echo 'seek 95 1' | mplayer -vo null -ao null -slave and checking if mplayer crashes. This command just opens the file and tries to seek to 95% time position.\nCase 2 means that a crash cannot be detected by looking at any point of the file other than the crash point. So, the only way to go about it will be to decode the entire file and see if the decoding fails at some point. There are ways to decode files faster than real time playback, but still I'd expect this process to go on for days, possibly months. It's up to you to decide whether detecting 20-30 corrupt files among a few thousand is really worth this much effort.\nDetecting videos that aren't 720p:\nmplayer file.extn -frames 0 -vo null -ao null 2> /dev/null | grep VIDEO | awk '{ print $3 }' prints the resolution of the video. You can use this to generate the required list.\n", "Q: Where is my Android phone's mount point, so I can rsync it?

I'm using Synaptic for package management on Ubuntu 12, and am currently trying to get the newest version of SWIG - 2.0.9. My currently installed package swig in Synaptic is version 2.0.7-3ubuntu1. I would like to have the latest version 2.0.9, how can I get it?\n\nA: The best way to get the latest version is to get it directly from the authors' website.\nIt takes time and energy to turn software into nice Ubuntu packages. Sometimes it can be a while before it turns up in the Ubuntu repositories. You can try enabling the less-stable repositories, such as backports, but in this case, SWIG 2.0.9 is not in there. Sometimes there are non-official repositories, but I couldn't find one from a quick Google.\nThere are a few negatives to this. The software will usually not auto-self-update, unlike repository packages. The software has not been tested by Ubuntu devs for compatibility, so there might be a few glitches. Finally, sometimes dependencies are packed into the software itself, so the manual download might be larger than a repository version.\nNew versions of Ubuntu itself come out every six months. In each Ubuntu release, new versions of software that add new features are generally not provided. Generally speaking, within a single Ubuntu release, only security and serious stability bug fixes are rolled out. Upgrading to the next release upgrades software to the versions that were considered stable when that release came out. You can sometimes use backports and PPA's to get newer software within a single release, but generally speaking if you need the latest version of a program, you'll likely need to download its source code and build and install it yourself (see also this howto).\n", "Q: How do I install gmate in ubuntu 12.04 I am trying to install gmate in ubuntu 12.04, I followed instructions from here\n\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:ubuntu-on-rails/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gedit-gmate\n\nThe package successfully installed, But I can't see any of the plugins included in gmate in gedit plug-ins list .

Beware that this may take a while, depending on how much you have saved on your drives. You can leave it mounted read-write, but you would still need to use sudo for all operations to the files.\nAssuming they are already mounted (at the locations stated above), you can just do:\nchmod -R o-w,a+r /mnt/media1 /mnt/media2\nchown -R root:root /mnt/media1 /mnt/media2\n\nThe first command makes all the files within /mnt/media1 and /mnt/media2 readable to everybody and writable only to the owner or group. The next command changes the owning user and group to root so that you need to use sudo to modify anything on the drive. You will only have to run these commands once; after that, they are permanently stored on the drive.\nThis will sufficiently protect your drive from user tampering while maintaining the readability of its stored contents.\n\nA: Since the drive is formatted as NTFS, something different than normal needs to be done. As NTFS does not support Unix-style file permissions, you will need to protect your drive by mounting it read-only. Assuming it is already mounted, you can do:\nsudo umount /mnt/media1 /mnt/media2\nsudo mount -o ro /dev/<device> /mnt/media1\nsudo mount -o ro /dev/<device> /mnt/media2\n\nThese will remount your drives in read-only mode, so you can't even modify them with sudo. To be able to modify them, do:\nsudo umount /mnt/media1 /mnt/media2\nsudo mount -o rw /dev/<device> /mnt/media1\nsudo mount -o rw /dev/<device> /mnt/media2\n\nMake your modifications (without sudo), and then execute the top two commands to protect them again.\nHope this answers your question.\n\nA: I think \nchmod -R o-w,a+r /mnt/media1 /mnt/media2\n\nis sufficient.\nand open standard accounts for kids.\nchange your password with passwd command.\nThat would be easier than typing sudo for any change to the disks.\n", "Q: Installing libgtk-3-dev on Ubuntu 10.04 How can I install Libgtk-3-dev on Ubuntu 10.04?

Why does this happen? How can I fix this? I am on a ubuntu 12.04 system.\n\nA: Anything not in your home folder needs root permission to execute for sake of security in case of multi-user systems. Place the proxy settings script in the home folder inside a special folder, say ~/commands. Add this line PATH=$PATH:~/commands in .bashrc\n\necho 'PATH=$PATH:~/commands' >> .bashrc\n\nNow, every time you run setproxy like any other command, like ls or date, proxy will be set. Just add sudo inside the script to avoid permission clashing.\n\nAlternatively 1 :\nThis forum explains about Upstart which is quite simple to use.\n\nAlternatively 2 :\nJust enable root account on your system and always use that.\nWarning : This is dangerous for the system in case you are not familiar with the system functioning, you tend to make silly or sloppy mistakes or for some reason are distracted and unknowingly make a mistake.\n\nA: I would suggest just adding the script to /etc/bash_completion which should get used every time you open a terminal as it is contained at the end of ~/.bashrc.  Alternatively you can add the script to the end of ~.bashrc directly. If you choose to add it to bash_completion it should contain the line\n. /etc/network/if-up.d/setproxy\n\nand you should check ~./bashrc to make sure that bash_completion is used (it is at the end of the file).

It is my understanding that the encrypted partitions are mounted and deciphered when I turn my computer on.\nI now like to know under what circumstances what partitions are dismounted and encrypted again. Obviously, all of them are dismounted when I turn my computer off. And obviously, not all of them are dismounted when I go into suspend or lock. But what about the home folder? Is it dismounted when my computer suspends or is locked? In other words: How secure is my data when I just go into suspend or lock my computer?\nShort version:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is the encrypted home folder dismounted when the computer is locked or goes into suspend?\n\n*How secure is my data when my computer is locked but not shut down?\n\n\nThank you!\nEDIT: Confused hibernate and suspend.\n\nA: I've been looking for the same answer and after a while I found it here on superuser:\nhttps://superuser.com/a/94688/35226\n\nHibernate mode can be made to be very secure, given that your resume device (ie swap device) is encrypted. You will be asked for the pre-boot passphrase after resuming from hibernation. I've tried it, and it works. Not susceptible to cold boot attacks either (well, not after the first minute or so).\nSleep mode is less secure; it does not dump its memory to swap when it goes to sleep. It can be made secure up to a point, in that you can require a password to unlock after resuming. However sleep mode is susceptible to cold boot attacks. Someone with physical access to the machine can find the key and get to your data.\n\nWhole tread is worth reading.\nGeneral conclusion for Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Suspending is weak for cold boot encryption attack. Attacker gets dump of your whole memory having physical access to your motherboard and dumps your encryption key. It works the same for any OS.\n\n*Hibernating is again not secure, because Ubuntu dumps your memory into swap partition which is not encrypted with default eCryptfs used by Ubuntu.\n\n\nI'm also not happy with it, but we should always fully shut down computers to feel more safely.\n", "Q: Gnome 3 always hangs after logon The problem I'm having is that after logging into GNOME Shell 3.4.1 on Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS.\nAfter a short period of time (approx 0-2 minutes) gnome shell becomes unresponsive.\nHovering on the corner / clicking on activities button doesn't do anything,\nWindows get stuck (the application is responding but the gnome is not)\nAlso the Alt + F2 doesn't do anything.\nThe only way I know how to resolve this issue is to go to linux shell by pressing\nCtrl + Alt + any from F1 to F6, login and restart the lightdm service.\nsudo service lightdm restart \n\nSo the question is How to solve the Gnome 3 hang after logon problem?\nhertz@hertzbox:~$ uname -a\nLinux hertzbox 3.2.0-35-generic #55-Ubuntu SMP Wed Dec 5 17:42:16 UTC 2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nhertz@hertzbox:~$ lsb_release -a\nNo LSB modules are available.\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS\nRelease:    12.04\nCodename:   precise\n\nhertz@hertzbox:~$ gnome-shell --version\nGNOME Shell 3.4.1\n\nP.S.

I am running MS Office under wine and would like to print PDF documents.\nInstalling the official extension via wine does nothing.\n\nA: cups-pdf didn't work properly for me, here's what I did:\nDownload the official extension from Microsoft's website. It didn't work for me eihter initially, but this is because I have Microsoft Office installed in a separate Wine prefix.\nTo find out if you have Word installed in a separate prefix, look at the file ~/.local/share/applications/wine/Programs/Microsoft Office/Microsoft Office Word 2007.desktop. Locate the line that starts with \"Exec\". On my system it looks like this:\nExec=env WINEPREFIX=\"/home/rune/.wine_office2007\" wine C:\\\\\\\\windows\\\\\\\\command\\\\\\\\start.exe /Unix /home/rune/.wine_office2007/dosdevices/c:/users/rune/Start\\\\ Menu/Programs/Microsoft\\\\ Office/Microsoft\\\\ Office\\\\ Word\\\\ 2007.lnk\n\nFrom this I can see that Office is installed in the prefix /home/rune/.wine_office2007.\nNow go to the folder where you downloaded the official PDF add-on. And run the .exe file using the following command, replacing <prefix> with the prefix in the \"Exec\" line of your Word .desktop file.:\nWINEPREFIX=\"<prefix>\" wine SaveAsPDFandXPS.exe\n\nIn my case the prefix is /home/rune/.wine_office2007, so the command to install the add-on becomes:\nWINEPREFIX=\"/home/rune/.wine_office2007\" wine SaveAsPDFandXPS.exe\n\nAfter doing this, restart Word, and you should see the option to save as a PDF in the Save As file menu.\n\nA: I support runeks' answer.\nHowever, I kept having problems installing the SaveAsPDF.exe extension - it never showed up as being installed. \nI finally realized that I had used PlayOnLinux to install Office rather than pure Wine, and this meant using the PoL Wine prefix.\nThis thread (in Italian!) helped me solve it:\nhttp://forum.ubuntu-it.org/viewtopic.php?t=447961&p=3510913\nBasically had to look in my /home/name/.PlayOnLinux/wineprefix folder to discover the correct WINEPREFIX path, then used that to run the .exe file.\n\nA: The answer is cups-pdf\nsudo apt-get install cups-pdf\n\nor from Ubuntu 16.04 on\nsudo apt-get install printer-driver-cups-pdf\n\nIf there's no such folder, create PDF at your home:\nmkdir ~/PDF\n\nNow you're set to go. From MS Word, do Print -> Select PDF as printer -> wait for the printing to complete (it takes some time).\n", "Q: what is repository mirror in Debian and ubuntu? What is a local mirror of a debian apt repository? any simple explanation. Is it the same as ubuntu repository? what is the best way to create one? and is it mandatory to keep the same folder hierarchy as the original repository? or there is a way to configure that change?\n\nA: when not to mirror\nBefore even bothering to start mirroring a whole repository, you should be aware of this:\n\n\n*\n\n*In case you're just trying to save bandwidth with multiple similar clients. Instead:\nBest way to cache apt downloads on a LAN?\n\n*In case you are setting up a public mirror, but the software license restricts you to do so. Not all third party software allows you to redistribute their software, such as Oracle Java. (not the best example, as they don't even offer a Debian repository)\n\n*If you're just interested in a small selection of the packages. Instead, just download the .deb files and then follow:\nHow to set up a Debian Repository?\nthe what\n\nany simple explanation.\n\nI hope you mean simple as in simple wording, rather than short/compact.\n\nWhat is a local mirror of a debian apt repository?\n\nLet's zoom out a bit, first. Debian and Ubuntu are very common Operating Systems, specifically, Ubuntu is derived from a Debian base. One of the key features of Debian and therefore also Ubuntu, is the package management. Repositories are a set of packages published in a certain way that the package management can easily understand the package list and verify the integrity of all of it. Repositories are copied all over the world for more efficient use of bandwidth as well as to have a higher availability. This continuous copying (or synchronisation) is also called mirroring.\nNow, zooming back in on your question. You can do this mirroring operation yourself as well. This will pull in tens of Gigabytes of data just for the main repositories, but once copied, you'll have them local, at LAN speed! This is useful for deploying a big amount of machines and you don't want to rely on the internet for some reason (bandwidth, availability, etc.). You can mirror from a local mirror near you or pick one that has a lower delay.\n\nIs it the same as ubuntu repository?\n\nIf one refers to a Debian APT repository, this is ambiguous for either a repository for...\n\n\n*\n\n*the Debian OS, containing all Debian packages.\n\n*the use with APT, possibly providing packages for other APT-based distributions.\n\n\nThe format of the repositories is the same, speaking in terms of simple ones. Debian has some differences for differential updating package lists for example, but it doesn't mean it's incompatible.\n\nis it mandatory to keep the same folder hierarchy as the original repository?\n\nIf you do a simple mirror, you can pick another sublevel, e.g. http://host.domain.tld/my-mirrors/ubuntu-archive/ubuntu, but you'll have to adhere to the format of the repository. You can't just shuffle around .debs there, as there are cross-references in there.\n", "Q: Slow booting / starting after apt-get update 12.04 I have just bought a new Lenovo Ideapad Z580, which came with Windows 8.\nI have since, removed that and installed 12.04 on top. Everything works fine. However, after I have to updated all 272 updates using update manager, my machine now takes about 15mins to get to the password/login page. Once I have logged in everything works fine.\nI have a before and after bootchart image if that helps (should I save it online e.g. pastebin, or can I attach it here?). It's very odd, in that the slow image has the opening init command taking over 1000 seconds, before the boot process kicks in.\nSince having this issue I have tried multiple things to fix it with no success. \nYesterday however, I did spend the entire day updating 5-10 updates at a time, to see if I could find the culprit for the slow boot. After going through all of them, I managed to get everything installed fine! It worked!! Then I went to install Mate on top, and bang, back to 15 minute boot times.

I am using Gedit and LibreOffice Writer. When I want to write in Hebrew I don't have any problem. When I download a LibreOfiice file in Hebrew I do not have any problem, either. When I download a file that is not a LibreOffice file (which means I am opening it with the Gedit) all I see is àðà äùàéøå ùí åîñôø èìôåï.\nWhy is that? Is it because I am opening a file with \".str\"? Here is an example of website which from there I downloaded the file.\n\nA: You need to set the encoding when you open the document. If you right click and choose open with gedit, gedit will display a prompt that lets you choose the encoding. But if you choose the wrong one, it doesn't give you an easy way through the menu to change it abd the prompt doesn't not always display again.\nThe best thing to do is use the File>Open dialog. In the lower left of the dialog, you'll see a Character Encoding option, which will say Auto Detected. Click the button to see a choice of encodings (there are 3 for Hebrew), be sure to click add after selecting the one you need, then choosing it again from the list on the right. Hebrews Windows and Hebrew Visual both worked, but Hebrew IBM did not.\n\nA: .srt files are sub-title files, which means they contain the timing and text to be displayed when a video is played. This can be safely opened and viewed in gedit. The reason you are seeing the file the way you are, is because the language is not set to Hebrew and the file is in Hebrew, if I can make out from your question correctly.\nTo set languages in gedit, go to Tools -> Set Language and set your language to Hibrew. If you cannot find Hibrew, you may need to install it from System Settings -> Language Support -> and install click on \"Install/ Remove Languages\".\n", "Q: How to access my virtual machine server via hostname? I created a Ubuntu 12.10 virtual machine in VMware which runs an Apache server.

In order not to have to determine the IP address of the machine over and over again, I'd like to access it using a domain/host name, e.g.:\nhttp://name.local/...\n\nHow can I accomplish this?\nEDIT:\nIt's a VMware vm with bridged networking.\nMy host OS is Ubuntu 12.10 too.\nMy local network uses DHCP and I'd rather not using static IP address.\nThe DHCP server is the one built-in my router. And I don't know about the DNS sever (Do I have a local one by default?)\n\nA: I think you need Apple's 'Bonjour' for this, and it needs to be installed on the Host OS. as well as the Guest OS. It should be installed by default in Ubuntu. If it is already installed, accessing:\nhttp://hostname.local/\n\nshould work, where the hostname is the name you get at a CLI on the Guest OS, e.g.:\nusername@hostname:~$\n\nIf you don't have 'Bonjour' installed on either then just install the packages avahi-daemon and libnss-mdns with:\nsudo apt-get install avahi-daemon libnss-mdns\n\n", "Q: Where can I get Project Looking Glass source code?

Whatever, unfortunately I would like to use ubuntu :) So the question is still there: why and how to run it.\n\nA: I figured out the problem. It was because of the sata connector on the mainboard.\nThe mainboard got 4x SATA3 connectors. But these are not equal. If we look into the manual (http://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/Z77%20Extreme4/?cat=Manual) there we can see:\n\n2 x SATA3 6.0 Gb/s connectors by Intel® Z77, support RAID (RAID 0,\n  RAID 1, RAID 5, RAID 10, Intel Rapid Storage and Intel Smart Response\n  Technology), NCQ, AHCI and Hot Plug functions\n2 x SATA3 6.0 Gb/s connectors by ASMedia ASM1061, support NCQ, AHCI\n  and “Hot Plug” functions (SATA3_A1 connector is shared with eSATA3\n  port)\n\nI was using two devices on ASMedia ASM1061 and I think Ubuntu dont have any drivers for the ASMedia SATA connector. So after I connected everything to the Intel connector -> no more crashes or black screen during the installation. This is interesting. Wondering why Ubuntu is not able to ignore the devices on the ASMedia connector. Even if I would connect a HDD to the ASMedia that I wont use for the installation for Ubuntu -> crash.\nWhatever, I hope this can help for people with the same problem with newer asrock boards.

I'd like to file this as a bug report, but I'm confused to where to post it: Ubuntu's bug tracker in Launchpad or GNOME's Nautilus bugzilla?\n\nA: I think it would be important to note that before posting the bug upstream, one must be sure of this:\n\n\n*\n\n*it's not a Ubuntu/Debian-specific feature/patch causing this\n\n*it's not present in the latest stable upstream release (which might not be available as a package)\n\n\nDevelopers upstream aren't too keen on debugging stuff that has been altered by a third party. Similar to asking for support at the factory while you bought a product from a reseller/retailer which has repackaged it.\nTherefore, I would recommend posting it on the Ubuntu bug tracker only first in case you're in doubt. In case this is an upstream bug, Ubuntu developers can decide on (back)porting the fix in the version in Ubuntu like all regular bug fixes.\nIf, some time later, you're able to find evidence that other distributions (other than Debian-derivatives) suffer from this as well, or a Ubuntu developer can point out it is not a packaging issue, then you can open an upstream bug report including a link to the Launchpad bug report. Launchpad is able to track several major external bug reporting systems, so the information can be linked, rather than completely independent.\nEither way, a bug report on Ubuntu's bug tracker might help indirectly in decision making for the Ubuntu developers. Suppose case tons of \"hot\" bug reports for application X come in after Ubuntu release Y to include this, then it's a good way of evaluating the decision on replacing X as a default application or for future decisions.\nMy conclusion to this is: start by filing a bug on Ubuntu's bug tracker and only post upstream if you have evidence to support it's not Debian/Ubuntu-specific.\n\nA: You could report it in both places. On Launchpad indicate that a GNOME bugzilla report exists for the bug. Then the Launchpad bug will monitor the GNOME bug so that if GNOME addresses it it will get incorporated by Ubuntu.\nReporting in both places helps ensure that both ubuntu and GNOME developers know about the bug and hopefully whichever team can best address it will take it on.\n", "Q: Play the movie faster with cvlc I have seen that I can control the speed of vlc by using the keyboard shortcuts +/-.

This can happen because Xorg no longer uses the config file in the same way. \nIf your nvidia drivers are working fine then start by removing all sections except \"device\". Make sure to backup the file first of course. \nOnce X comes back up use Displays (from the dashboard or system setting) to correct the resolution. This will save the setting so that it is \"high res\" whenever you log in. \nMake sure, the first time you make the changes, to actually log out, and not just kill X or issue the reboot command. \nIt that doesn't work for you you can try editing your settings in Nvidia Settings and saving them to the Xorg config file, but this should not be needed. \nBasically the Xorg config structure underwent a huge change a few years ago and now a lot of the well published data is just plain wrong, or leads you down the wrong path. Simply put the Xorg config file should only be used to override things that don't work normally.  \n\nA: Your system may be differnt than mine, and you may want specific features that I don't require, but I have found a very useful program called \"ARandR\" that allows you to manage which monitors are displaying and at what resolution. I have a laptop that I normally have plugged into a monitor. So I had a similar issue, my monitor would, by default, only display at the \"nearest\" resolution to the highest resolution of the laptop. I know this sounds confusing, but my monitor was the good old aspect ration of 4:3, while my laptop's display was one of those new wide screen ratios, so you can imagine what it looked like.\nSO to solve this problem, someone recommended ARandR to me (http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2084045). It basically worked like a charm. Once I log in the settings are immediately set (my laptop monitor terns off and my monitor displays at full resolution). ARandR also let's you save profiles so if I want to take my laptop to a different monitor set-up I can have a profile for it.\nHere is the official website:\nhttp://christian.amsuess.com/tools/arandr/\nthere are install instructions there. You can type:\nsudo aptitude install arandr\n\nOr just find find it in sypatic and install it from there.\nAgain, this program works for me, there maybe some features that this program doesn't give you... But this is the best answer I can give.\n", "Q: Why I am taken to grub4dos when selecting Ubuntu from the windows boatloader menu? I recently installed Ubuntu 12.04.1 64x alongside Windows 7(32bit) (Ubuntu after Windows 7) on my PC. Ubuntu installed properly without any errors. I installed grub on sda5 logical drive (one mounted with /boot), and os on sda6 (again logical) (mounted with /).\nwhen i rebooted it took me to windows as windows bootloader is in mbr, on first primary partition of disk. I added the entry for ubuntu with easyBCD and when again rebooted there was an entry but i was taken to a prompt called grubfordos, which looks like grub rescue prompt.\nin windows C drive i found folder LST and one .mbr file created by easyBCD i guess.\ni dont know whats gone wrong. Please help.\nPS i ahve swap area of 8 gb on sda7 (logical).\n\nA: For understanding what is going on and repairing your boot problem\nsee Dual boot Windows 7 and Linux.\nEasybcd uses Windows 7 bootmgr to chainload grub4dos to chainload GRUB which is overkill. Bootmgr can chainload GRUB directly as well the other way around - GRUB can chainload almost any foreign boot manager.\n\nA: If this problem occurred to others, please try out 32 bit Ubuntu with 32bit Windows. I dont know exactly why, but it solved my problem.\n\nA: Samir Chauhan's solution of installing 32bit version of Linux solves the problem but it arises another problem - it restricts the max RAM usage to 4GB as we use 32 bit architecture. (mine has got 8gb ddr3 ram and why should I waste the remaining)\nI have a solution for that, but you cannot use windows bootloader with it, instead grub2 takes control. Still you can boot into both the OS. \nInstall ubuntu once more, configure the partitions with one partition (for installing linux) with ext4 file system and with mount point /, and format the 350 MB (or sometimes it is 1024MB) system reserved partition that contains windows 8 bootloader and set it to EFI BOOT PARTITION, and set the installation of bootloader in that partition (most probably it will be hd0,0 meaning it is the first partition sda0) and then install the ubuntu normally. Once you reboot you can see violet screen (grub2 showing some three to five options) or sometimes it would take you directly into ubuntu, and what you gotta do is open terminal after booting to ubuntu and type \"sudo update-grub\" and then windows will be detected :) \nYou can then see both ubuntu and windows the next time you boot in the grub2 menu\n", "Q: Install ubuntu on windows 8 with intel smart response I have a dell inspiron 15z (ultrabook) with two drives, one HDD (500 Go) and one SSD (32 Go) managed by a kind of raid 0 array called intel smart response, and Windows 8 already installed.\nDell allows the bios to disable the secure boot mode, but when I launch the ubuntu installer from a live cd, the install does not recognize any drive.\nSo I tried, as read on the web, to deactivate Intel smart response from the GUI in Windows 8, and to set the SATA mode to AHCI or to ATA (I tried both).\nIn both cases, it does not work. I just want to use ubuntu and remove (if possible) Windows.\nWhat can I do? Should I format the bios and reinstall it from scratch?\n\nA: thank you all for your replies, the problem was that the Ubuntu installer did not recognize any disk while the Intel Smart Response was on. \nBut it was easy after all, I was being a bit stupid : I just needed to find the Intel Smart Response GUI in Windows 8 and to turn everything off inside.\nThen I could install any Linux distribution.\nThanks again. \n\nA: There is actually a simple answer to this question, if you mean to completely remove Windows 8 and keep only Ubuntu. After installing Ubuntu on the USB through PenDriveLinux, reboot with the USB attached to your computer. Now, restart and keep pressing F2, F12, or delete while it is booting to access the Dell startup menu. There should be an \"exit\" or \"Boot\" option. On one of those, if you see anything related to \"USB\", just select that. The Ubuntu load button should show, and after a while it will show a menu. Click \"Install Ubuntu\". After going through a few steps, you will see one which says \"Installation Type\". If you are sure you want to take out Windows and keep Ubuntu, select \"Erase disk and install Ubuntu\".

When starting gparted, it crashes with the error:\nGtk-ERROR **: GTK+ 2.x symbols detected.\nUsing GTK+ 2.x and GTK+ 3 in the same process is not supported\n\nI already opened LP bug #1094354 for this.\nSearching the internet for this error, I see that almost every Linux distribution suffers from the same issue regarding this GTK+ 2.x/GTK+3 error for various other GTK-based programs too, e.g. gedit, gwibber, canberra-gtk, etc...\nThe GTK developers are claiming that it's not a GTK bug. Yet, no one on all the sites I've Googled has come up with an answer as to what this error message actually means.\nWhat is going on in a program to cause this error? And what does this error mean in detail?\n\nA: It means that you are running an application which attempted to load the symbols from the GTK+ 2.x libraries, as well as the 3.x libraries. This is a problem, because there are several conflicting symbols in the libraries.\nIt is not a GTK+ bug, as GTK+ is doing the right thing by exiting early with a failure. If it didn't, you would most likely get very unpredictable behavior. In many cases, it is an issue with plug-ins, where the main app has been ported to GTK+ 3.x, but all the plug-ins haven't, and some people might still have older plug-ins installed, or similar.\n\nA: I got the same error message.\nIt turns out that for development I've set LD_PRELOAD to load some libraries (e,g: caffe libs), and those (with GTK+ apps) caused the error.\n", "Q: Can I record playback with audacity without Pulseaudio?

I can't see any option in alsamixer or audacity.\nIs it possible?\n\nA: This depends highly on your sound card. To do so without some kind of software intervention would require a \"full duplex\" sound card. \nBasically look in ALSA Mixer (alsamixer) and hit [Tab] till your on the \"capture\" page. Then if you have the option to select either \"Monitor\" or \"PCM\" choose that and you should be capturing your output. \nMany, many computers do not have full duplex cards, in addition the channels may be named something else. \nThere are some options, if you do not have a full duplex card. This site should get you started, but recording the playing sound, generally requires a better then average sound card. \n", "Q: Having a Problem After Installing Mac-osx Theme and setting it up With Cairo dock When I enter sudo apt-get upgrade, this message shows up:\ndpkg: error: cannot scan updates directory `/var/lib/dpkg/updates/': No such file or directory\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (2)\n\nAny Help ?! \n\nA: This may work. \nsudo dpkg --clear-avail  \nsudo apt-get update\n\nIt may also not.

So, my question is :- \nIs it possible to repair grub with different version of Ubuntu Live CD? If possible then how could I do that and how risky that process?\n\nA: If the questions are:\nIs it possible to repair grub with different version of Ubuntu Live CD? \nIf possible then how could I do that and how risky that process?\nThe answers are:\nYes, it is possible and safe. It does not involve any risk to repair the Grub.\nShould just do it through chroot:\nInsert the Ubuntu LiveCD into the CD/DVD drive and reboot the computer.

However when I type the full path of the utility I'm able to run it.\nHas anyone experienced this problem before? Do you know what I can do to fix this problem?\n\nA: First, make sure that you're restarting your session.  Either by closing the terminal window, or logging completely out and back in.\nNext, make sure you have actually modified the PATH with echo $PATH.\nIf you're not the aldin from the file's path (or even if you are), make sure you have permissions to see that directory and to execute that file.\nFinally, make sure the command you are trying to run is actually marked with the execute permission. Something like chmod a+x /home/aldin/mybin/fasta-35.4.12/bin/file.sh should work.\nAlso, you are trying to modify the PATH in a very dangerous way. Instead try:\nPATH=\"$PATH:$HOME/mybin/fasta-35.4.12/bin/\"\n\nNEVER (sometimes I wish there was a \"super bold\") modify the $PATH the way you are, always reference the current $PATH in there somewhere or you will overwrite, rather than, append to the existing entries in it.\n\nA: I was having the same type of problem. I couldn't get bash to accept a library path so that my program could use it. That's when I found out about the linker manager.\nLinux has a linker manager named ldconfig. I navigated to /etc/ld.so.conf.d as a root user. Then I made a config file in there named something like myLibPaths.conf. I added one library path line to that file: like; /home/userName/lib. You could probably add as many path lines to that file as needed. After that, a configuration command was needed.\nExecute ldconfig on the command line. Verify the path addition with ldconfig -v | less or  ldconfig -v | grep /home/userName/lib.\n&)To delete the paths:\nrm /etc/ld.so.conf.d/myLibPaths.conf\n&)To edit the paths:\nEdit myLibPaths.conf then run ldconfig again.\nI have not experimented with setting a library path using bash any more. I may have been able to set the library path with LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PATH:$HOME/lib, but the linker manager works just fine. The whole trouble was in getting bash to acknowledge the LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Perhaps Linux doesn't handle libraries in this way at all?\n", "Q: What to do if Installation in virtual machine says \"no detected operating systems\"? I'm installing Ubuntu 12.10 in a virtual machine using Virtualbox with Windows 7 as the host OS.\nOne of the steps is to follow the regular installation procedure, but then I encountered a problem that says that there is no current OS in my computer. The choices that I have are to erase disk or to create a partition. I'm not sure what to do next.\nA screenshot of the installation step concerned is below:\n\n\nA: VirtualBox will create a file drive inside your Windows file system that emulates a disk by itself.\nIt is not (unless specified) using a real hard disk. Since that virtual disk is empty, the Ubuntu installation inside the vbox will give you only the option to initialize and create a new partition.\nYou should not worry about modifications actually happening to your hard disk, the only thing affected will be the virtual drive you just created when adding a new vbox, it is safe to press next and create new partitions.\n", "Q: Receive and Send SMS via PC \nPossible Duplicate:\nDesktop SMS client in Ubuntu \n\nI am very interested in using Ubuntu , but there is one question .

I just purchased a Lenovo thinkpad and I am so proud of everything in it. It feels just as rock solid as the Linux kernel :P.\nThe problem is that Lenovo decided to remove the context menu key that is the key that does the right click stuff. They replaced it by a print screen key. My keyboard has its numeric part with some buttons above it. There is a magnifying glass key that I would like to remap to open the context menu or be the right click key. Is it possible to do this?\nI've tried searching for other related questions but I only found Q&As on how to add options to the Nautilus context menu. I want to to map a physical key of my keyboard to open this menu. Just like before. It also appears that Dell is dropping this key in their inspiron keyboard. I dont know whats going on since I use the keyboard more than mouse.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: I recently acquired a Lenovo E550 and had the same problem, I solved it by using xte (from xautomation) along with xmodmap.\nWhy the other answers won't work entirely?\n\n\n*\n\n*@Ed Villegas (nor @Null Pointer) answer won't work because some of the keys located above the numeric part are not unique keys by themself (e.g. the lock key is related to the Super+L combination). When xev is used to try to find the lock key keycode it returns both the Super and the L keycodes, you just have to interpret the xev output line by line.\n\n*For @Bahax and @John Finegan: Shift+F10 is a context menu key, it doesn't work in all the applications and it doesn't provide the same functions as Menu. If you select a file in the file explorer and press  Menu the context menu for the file itself should pop-up, this does not happen with the Shift+F10 combination, it would provide a context menu for the window instead.\n\n*@Danial Behzadi takes a similar approach to the people in the 2nd item, but linking the keyboard combination to one key through a keystroke simulator, it will link the key to the Shift+F10 and provide the same result.\nThe answer that works\nIt is important to take into account that the key that is not present in the ThinkPad keyboard is the Menu (that is it's name), it is shown in the following picture:\n\nAlthough the key is not present, it's keycode should exist in your computer, you can find it by printing the keycode table with xmodmap -pke | grep Menu which should give you something like:\n\nWith that in mind, install xautomation (in order to use xte for keystroke simulations) like in @Danial Behzadi answer:\n\nsudo apt-get install xautomation\n\nAnd create a custom shortcut, in the Trigger press the key that you want to be the shortcut, and in the Action paste xte 'key Menu'. Apply and test.\n\nA: This did the trick for me.\nFor me the keycode for \"PrtSc\" button on my thinkpad is 107. I found that by \"xev\" tool in ubuntu.\nxmodmap -e \"keycode  107 = Menu\"\n\nThis is a temporary change.\nYou can make this permanent by adding this command to /etc/profile and it will execute everytime you boot and it will be a permanent change. \n\nA: I finally found the way to do this after hours of tests and fails :D\nFirst of all install xautomation:\nsudo apt-get install xautomation\n\nThen head to the Shortcut tab of Keyboard section in Ubuntu System Settings. First go to Screenshots entry and remap the actions to another key or disable them if you want. I replaced PrtSc(Print) key by the Thinkpad black button (Launch1).\nNow go to Custom Shortcuts section and add a shortcut. name it whatever you like, e.g. Menu. In Command field insert this:\nxte 'keydown Shift_L' 'key F10' 'keyup Shift_L'\n\nThe work is done! It's working like a miracle ;)\n\nA: The following finally worked for me!\nI'm have had the same problem with my Huawei Matebook 14 where the menu key is missing. Although I show how to map the menu operation to the right control (as I personally don't use it), this instruction works for any button.\nThe method works permanently.\nFull guide (steps):\n\n*\n\n*Know the key code you want to bind Menu command to. Execute :\nxev | grep keycode\n\nthen press your button and remember the code. E.g. I want my Right control to call the context menu. I press it, and get the code: 105.\n\n\n*Modify the keycodes configuration file:\nNote: you need to do this as a super user.\nOptional but highly recommended!

E.g. while renaming a file in Nemo file manager, it will not show the context menu and cancel renaming.\nSo I followed @Ed Villegas' answer to create an xmodmap configuration that is run on startup. To reactivate the remapping after suspend, I changed my keyboard shortcut (still assigned to the Print key) to execute:\n/bin/bash -c \"xdotool keyup Print key --clearmodifiers Menu && /usr/bin/xmodmap $HOME/.Xmodmap\"\n\nIn this way, the first use of the Print key after suspend will emulate the menu key using xdotool, while after that, it will be remapped to the menu key.\n\nA: 4 simple lines in your shell startup i.e. .zshrc\nmysetting=$(xmodmap -pke | grep 135)\nif [ $mysetting != 'keycode 135 = Control_R NoSymbol Control_R' ]; then\n  sleep 4 && xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap &\nfi\n\nIn my case I keep hitting the menu button instead of right CTRL button. So I added this to my shell startup which also gets auto-launched on system boot via start-up items, opens my terminal. Yes there's a lag on the first terminal load, but after that, no such lag even if closing terminal and launching new one. For other remapping see previous answers to locate the mapping you need and you can modify this script accordingly.\n", "Q: Locked out of admin account; but the password is right in shell; password changed too!

This question explains how:\n\n*\n\n*How can I repair grub? (How to get Ubuntu back after installing Windows?)\nI know your problem isn't that Windows was just installed. But the fix is the same.\nOr if you prefer, you can use any of these methods:\n\n*\n\n*Grub2/Installing - Fixing a Broken System\nIf you experience any further problems booting your new Ubuntu system, please go ahead and edit your question again (then you can comment on this answer to let me know).\nEverything you need to know to fix this problem is there...but in case you're interested in what is wrong and why that will fix your situation, I've included an explanation below.\nThe Problem\nThe error message is actually telling you that it tried to boot via Ethernet and failed. This makes sense--to boot successfully from the fourth device in the boot list, PCI Lan, you'd have to have a boot server running on a local network.\nThis error message is useful to us not because it tells us it failed to boot from PCI Lan, but because it tells us it tried. That means it was unable to boot from all of the boot devices that are set before it in the list.\nIt makes sense that it didn't boot from USB--the Ubuntu live USB was disconnected, and you've reported that when it is connected, it boots. And it makes sense that it didn't boot from the CD/DVD drive--you probably didn't put a bootable disk in that drive.\nThe question is, why didn't it boot from the hard disk? We know the hard disk works, since it worked before, it worked when you installed, and you can access it from an Ubuntu live system. And it looks like the system was installed.\nFor the BIOS to move down on the boot device list from the hard disk, the disk must have appeared not bootable at all. That is, the problem isn't that the installed operating system begins to start and has a problem. Rather, the installed operating system cannot even start. Its boot loader, GRUB, is nowhere to be found.\nWhile most installations go without anything going wrong, this is actually one of the more common installation problems. It can occur if you manually tell the installer not to install GRUB to the master boot record of the first hard drive, if it identifies the first hard drive incorrectly (its idea of first isn't necessarily what the BIOS tries to boot first), if it thinks a suitable boot loader is already in place (and is wrong), and possibly for other reasons.\nReinstalling the GRUB2 boot loader to the master boot record of the drive that the BIOS is trying to boot almost always solves this problem. When someone with a working Ubuntu system installs a Windows system alongside Ubuntu, the Windows installer will overwrite the master boot record with its own boot loader, which does not detect and provide an option to boot Ubuntu. That's what your situation has in common with that of users who've just installed Windows beside Ubuntu.\n", "Q: How can I test if a variable matches another value and move to another function? I am writing a script where I store a predetermined line of text into a string (we will call abc). I am storing the results from grep -iqs $USER file (we will call def) into another string. \nHow can I test if $abc matches content in $def and if it does, move onto next function? If it does not, prompt user for input.\nThis is my attempt thus far:\nfirstFunction() {\nabc=\"$USER content\";               #text stored as string\ndef=`grep -iqs $USER /file`;       #results of grep stored to string\nif [[ $def = \"$abc\" ]]; then       #test if result from grep command matches text in\n   secondFunction                  #string $def. If true, move to secondFunction. If\nelse                               #false, prompt user.\n   echo \"Message to user with a y/n prompt\"; read prmt;\nfi;\nif [[ $prmt != \"y\" || $prmt != \"n\" ]]; then prmt\nelif [[ $prmt == \"y\" ]]; then\n   sed -i \"s/$def/$abc/g\" /file    #If user chooses y at prompt, replace $abc with $def\nelif [[ $answer == \"n\" ]]; then    #in file. If user chooses no at prompt, move to \n   secondFunction                  #secondFunction.\nfi;\nclear;\n};\n\nEnvironment titles have been changed but the concept behind the snippet should be clear. \n\nA: First of all, because you used grep with -q argument, the value of def variable will always be equal with an empty string. From man grep:\n\n-q, --quiet, --silent\n       Quiet;  do  not  write  anything  to  standard   output.    Exit\n       immediately  with  zero status if any match is found, even if an\n       error was detected.  Also see the -s  or  --no-messages  option.\n       (-q is specified by POSIX.)\n\nSecond, you should think a little bit logic. This expression:\n$prmt != \"y\" || $prmt != \"n\"\n\nis always in any programming language evaluated as true:\n\n\n*\n\n*if $prmt = \"y\", then for sure $prmt != \"n\", so your expression is true\n\n*if $prmt = \"n\", then for sure $prmt != \"y\", so your expression is true\n\n*in any other cases is clear that your expression is true.\n\n\nThird, your function should look like:\nfirstFunction() {\n    abc=\"$USER content\"\n    def=`grep -is $USER /path/to/file`\n    if [[ $def = \"$abc\" ]]; then\n       secondFunction \n       return                            #does not make sense to go ahead\n    else\n       echo \"Message to user with a y/n prompt\"\n       read prmt\n    fi\n    while : ; do\n    if [  \"$prmt\" = \"n\" ]; then \n       secondFunction\n       return                            #does not make sense to go ahead\n    elif [ \"$prmt\" = \"y\" ]; then\n       sed -i \"s/$def/$abc/g\" /path/to/file\n       return                            #does not make sense to go ahead\n    else\n       echo \"Message to user with a y/n prompt\"\n       read prmt\n    fi\n    done\n}\n\nOr, as you said, you can use case statement.\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*Introduction to if\n\n*Using case statements\n\n*Function syntax\n\n*Examples using grep\n", "Q: How stop Ubuntu from reading my password out loud every time I log on?

When I open gdebi to install, it tells me that it's uninstallable because it's for a i386 architecture. I've tried installing ia32-libs (installed, no success), gdebi --add-architecture i386 (with and without --force, command unknown). This is all I've found to fix the problem, but none of it has worked for me. Any suggestions are welcome, thanks for your time.\n\nA: Some similar questions have already been asked here.\nThe problem, in short, is trying to force the installation of a 32 bit package on a 64 bit machine.\nI would suggest you to have a look at these questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I apt-get a 32-bit package on a 64-bit installation?\n\n*How do I install a 32-bit proprietary deb on a 64-bit system without causing dependency problems?\n\nA: You could do this:\nDowland the package from\nhttp://steampowered.com\n\nand then appgrid\nsudo apt-get install appgrid\n\nor\nsudo dkms-reconfigure steam\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall steam\nsudo apt-get update \nsudo apt-get upgrade \nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade \n\nand it might work fine this way.\n\nA: To install steam, if you have issues, the best approach is to use the terminal with dpkg + apt. Those utilities will give you the most fine grained control. If you get problems you'll be able to copy/paste the errors to get more help.\nThis steps also work for Debian.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the steam DEB package\n\n*Enable the 32 bit repository: \nsudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\n\n*Update the package list: apt-get update\n\n*Try to install the package with dpkg, it will fail because of the missing dependencies: sudo dpkg -i steam.deb\n\n*Now, correct the missing dependencies: sudo apt-get install -f\n\n*Verify that steam is properly installed: sudo dpkg -i steam.deb\nAt this moment steam should be installed.\nThere have been cases where the libraries in steam created issues, like: https://askubuntu.com/a/706796/430526\nIn other cases Steam will complain because the packages with the 32 bit 3D libraries are not installed, you may need to install those packages. For example if you use nvidia drivers: install libgl1-nvidia-glx:i386\nAn useful link regarding missing 32bit 3D drivers: https://www.codeweavers.com/support/wiki/Diag/MissingLibGL\nIf it doesn't work, paste the contents of your terminal, it is usually easy to see what the problem is from them.\n\nA: If you intend to play somewhat modern games on this computer, you need to do at least two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and install a recent 64-bit version of Lubuntu.  Currently, this is 16.04 LTS.  Anything less than this, and you're asking for trouble.  12.04 was released in April of 2012.\n\n*Download and install the latest 64-bit version of Steam, either from the Ubuntu repository or steampowered.com.\n\n\nOf course, install your graphics drivers, as needed, and otherwise do everything necessary to make it go.  If this computer is too old to run anything 64-bit, at least get a current version of Lubuntu, and install the latest 32-bit Steam package.  There are still some games that don't require a modern processor.\n", "Q: How can I format my drive completely to prepare it for any OS, not specifically Ubuntu? I am sad to say it, but I am turning my back on Ubuntu. One last thing I need to know though is how to nuke my hard drive.

I have an external USB disk drive formatted E2fs/E3fs by another linux system (specifically a Linksys NSLU2 running stock Linksys firmware). From the command line as a root user, I have used 'chmod 777' on the mount point to allow me to write around 400Gb of files to this disk. When I move this USB disk drive back to the normal system the new files are visible in a directory listing, but not readable. This is because the file permissions have been screwed up (My background is simple Windows systems, so I know very little about Linux file permissions). The files newly written by the laptop show the owner as 'username'. Older files written by the NSLU2 (the normal intended host for the disk drive) and accessed correctly show the file owner as '501','1000', '2000' etc.\nI have tried to use Nautilus to change the file permissions to those expected, but Nautilus will only allow me to select owner names from a pre-defined list, not including the ones that I want. When I try to add a user to the Ubuntu system with the desired user name (to allow Nautilus to offer the correct choice) I get an error message I do not understand - I suspect that Ubuntu does not like these numeric usernames because a bit of research suggests that they are used for special purposes in other Linux systems.\nHow do I fix the file permissions on this external disk - specifically owner and group names?\nThanks, Peter\n\nA: The NSLU2 has its own users. These do not match the Ubuntu system, so you have to use the UID's and GID's of the NSLU2 (501, 1000, 2000, as you wrote). Using names when you change ownership of the files will not work. You could have copied the files over the network to prevent it, but that would have been a much slower process.\nPlug the disk that belongs on the NSLU2 into your Ubuntu computer. Locate the files you copied to the NSLU2's disk. Change the owner and group to the numeric UID and GID appropriate for the NSLU2. For example...\nchown 1000:1000 filename.ext\nIf you know the right UID and GID for the NSLU2 files, and if you copied those files to the NSLU2 with Ubuntu, then you may be able to find your copied files and change ownership in one line:\nfind /media/nslu2 -user peter -exec chown 1000:1000 {} \\;\nThe mount point is /media/nslu2; the Ubuntu username that was used to copy the files was peter; the correct UID and GID for the NSLU2 files is 1000.\nCaution\nYou might want to see what that find command actually finds first before passing the \"-exec\" switch.\nfind /media/nslu2 -user peter\nBetter Firmware\nThere is a firmware replacement for the NSLU2 (unslung) that can provide SSH access to the NSLU2.\n", "Q: How to recover flash drive lost after formatting with GParted? I was just copying audio files into my 2GB USB mp3 player, then i had a problem saying that it could not copy files into the drive any more, i tried removing it and trying again, but it didn't work, but the files already copied to the drive where working just fine and i was able to read them.\nBut after the problem remaining i decided to format the drive using Disks, but somehow this didn't work. When i choose to format the drive nothing happens and I get no error messages.\nSo i tried Gparted and it worked, I formatted the drive as FAT32 but after this, the drive doesn't show up, in Ubuntu, Disks, Windows or even GParted. The drive is still working because its a mp3 reader, and when i try to use it just says that there are no files in it (because of formatting it of course).\nThere is any way I can restore my flash drive back?\nAny ideas will be very welcome :)\n\nA: It's possible your USB connector or cable is damaged, and preventing the computer from recognizing the flash drive/mp3 device. Plug the drive in under Ubuntu and run the command LSUSB in a terminal. If the flash drive doesn't show up, try another port or cable. If it does, then try and format it again. check and see what file system your computer is formatted as again and make sure you use the same one on the flash drive. One other comment. Some MP3 Players come with a small file (frequently less than 100kb) pre-installed, that contains vital information for the proper function of the device. If yours had one, and you deleted it, then you might be stuck. \n", "Q: What's a recommended alternative to Quickbooks pro? I've just installed Ubuntu to replace Windows. I can't seem to find a good alternative to Quickbooks pro to run on Ubuntu. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: There are a variety of alternatives to QuickBooks, if you're looking for a web-based option. Or, as Jackson Doak mentioned, there is GnuCash - open source & desktop. It's a pretty robust accounting software and certainly worth exploring, if you prefer a desktop alternative to QuickBooks.\nIf you're open to web-based options, then have a look at Wave (completely free), Monchilla or Outright (both free/paid options). QuickBooks does have an online version available and there's Xero also.\nIt will depend on your accounting needs, as much as your chosen platform. I'm a certified advisor and user of QuickBooks, as well as the web-based software options I listed. \nGood luck!\n\nA: You could install quickbook via wine, if that's too much hassle, you could try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Gnucash, \n\n*kmymoney and\n\n*moneydance \n\n\nThey may be what you're after, they all have got decent reviews.\n\nA: For medium to Large size businesses I'd highly recommend Quasar Accounting http://linuxcanada.com/. The Business I work for is running it. We have 6 branches and they are all connected. I also give support for 3 smaller businesses (Less then 5 employees) that use Quasar. The Single user addition is free and the older versions you can even get GPL licensed source code for. To download visit ftp://linuxcanada.com/pub/Quasar/\n", "Q: How to reset hotspot key?

I followed these instructions \nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/116409/how-to-turn-your-ubuntu-laptop-into-a-wireless-access-point/\nwhich worked quite well.\nUbuntu assigned a default wep key for this hotspot. I used it to connect another laptop I have and everything was fine. However, I decided to change the default key and its type from wep to wpa. I did this in the \"wireless security\" tab, pressed save and exited.\nI then tried once again to change the key and I was welcomed with:\n\"password or encryption keys are required to access the wireless network\" \n\nwhich was expected.

Once I tried to reconnect, I was asked for authentication:\n\"password or encryption keys are required to access the wireless network\" \nI put in the default key and I still wasn't able to reconnect. \nI'm guessing the ad-hoc characteristic is precisely that you use it only once.

Just forget G-Parted at the time being.\n\n*To date, the only GUI application able to resize LVM2 partition is \"system-config-lvm\" (sudo apt-get install system-config-lvm) but for some reason, I haven't been able to get much from it.\n\n*Alternatively, it is possible to resize LVM2 partitions by using the appropriate command lines. More here > http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/40702/how-to-manage-and-use-lvm-logical-volume-management-in-ubuntu/ and there > http://www.tcpdump.com/kb/os/linux/lvm-resizing-guide/all-pages.html\n\n*I am personally a fan of G-Parted, the usual fast & easy trick. I hope the next version will be able to resize LVM2 partitions all graphically. But in the meantime, the best thing I always do, and I really mean it, is NOT to install new Linux boxes with LVM2; but rather with Ext3 or Ext4 instead. This choice is given in the middle of the install process: just avoid doing the \"OK / Next / Next\" thing mindlessly as LVM2 will be picked up as the default partition system ^^ it is far better customizing the formatting method. So let's keep say 1024 Mb for the Swap Partition, and assign 10GB or more to the /dev/sda1 partition (the Ext3/4 one), on which \"/\" is the Mount Point.\nThis way, you may be able to use G-parted later on it if needed, with no limitation of any kind.\nEdit 1 : if you desperately need to free some disk space on your FileSystem partition ASAP, logon your linux and type the following command : \"du -sh *\", which will display a list of all the directories and their size. This will help you identify the biggest folders at a glance and maybe move or remove static data.\nEdit 2 : Latest news from the G-Parted Team (dated 2nd sept. 2013) : \"\nTo resize LVM2 PV partitions, the volume must be deactivated.  To do this, select the menu option \"Partition --> Deactivate\".  When the LVM2 PV partition is deactivated, then the resize/move menu option will be enabled.\nSince Logical Volume Management is not simply a file system, there are serious repercussions to changing the volume group name or UUID.  Also problems will occur if the LVM2 PV is copied.  That is why these operations are not supported for LVM2 PV.\"\n\nA: I've run into the problem where you simply want to extend the LVM volume like so:\nresize underlying disk, usually /dev/sda in vmware\n/dev/sda1 is /boot\n/dev/sda2 is LVM partition\nre-read the disk\nfdisk to delete and recreate /dev/sda2 (lvm partition only) effectively extending the partition.\npvresize /dev/sda2\nvgdisplay never sees it!!!\nThat's the problem.  You have to do a flipping reboot.  CentOS 6 is where I see this issue.  I'll have to try it on 7 and see if it works.\n", "Q: Installing driver for Atheros AR8131 I am having the same trouble as others getting my Atheros AR8131 Ethernet card recognised by Ubuntu 12.10 on my new HP Pavillion P7-1449 PC.

So, let's take a step back and look at another much simpler approach to install it.\nSimply install the appropriate linux-backports-modules-cw-* package for your kernel, e.g.:\n\n\n*\n\n*For Quantal, using Linux compat-wireless-3.6 backported to regular kernel\nsudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-cw-3.6-quantal-generic\n\n\n*Same, but for Precise\nsudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-cw-3.6-precise-generic\n\nOr use any other package management tool to install this package. While it has 'backport' in its package name, it's not needed to enable any backports repository - it's just there in main.\nFinally, reboot, or if you know the kernel module to load: sudo modproble modulename.\n\nA: Lately the modules from the 3.8 kernel have been backported, so use \nsudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-cw-3.8-precise-generic\n\ninstead of \nsudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-cw-3.6-precise-generic\n\nas in gertvdijk's answer here\n\nA: I am not sure, there is no need of compilation.

I looked for a changelog on the Ubuntu site and the most recent one is for the version I have, 10.04.4, and makes no mention of sudo at all.\nIs all correct here or is there something I should be worried about?\n\nA: The update to sudo you have there is just a regular update announced in this mail. To verify what versions of sudo are installed and available, check out the power of apt-cache policy (this works for any package), e.g.:\n$ apt-cache policy sudo\nsudo:\n  Installed: 1.8.3p1-1ubuntu3.3\n  Candidate: 1.8.3p1-1ubuntu3.3\n  Version table:\n *** 1.8.3p1-1ubuntu3.3 0\n        500 http://nl.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-updates/main amd64 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n     1.8.3p1-1ubuntu3.2 0\n        500 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-security/main amd64 Packages\n     1.8.3p1-1ubuntu3 0\n        500 http://nl.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise/main amd64 Packages\n\nFrom your question I also assume that you would have expected more updates for a point release. Well, 10.04.4 or a .5 if that would be planned, is not a real \"release\" like a complete new version of Ubuntu to where you get a whole pile of new updates. Instead, you've already received the updates during the last months and once the release team determines it's time for a new point release, ISOs get updated as a \"point release\". The update for sudo you got is just an additional update to the 10.04.4 release. It will not be included in any new point release, as .4 is the last one in the 10.04 series.\nPlease refer to these links for more information:\n\n\n*\n\n*What are point releases in LTS versions? - on what point releases are\n\n*Ubuntu Wiki /PointReleaseProcess - on the process\n\n\nA: In fact you don't need to worry, although it's a little bit strange that just one package is to be upgraded, but as this package is sudo, maybe upgrading it and then performing sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get upgrade again you will be presented to more packages to upgrade.\nIf you remain in doubt check Software Sources and /etc/apt/sources.list to see if the repositories that you use are enabled.\n\nA: sudo is a package just like any other and occasionally a newer version needs to be updated.

The Wikipedia page on the subject explains it pretty well.  From what you're doing, you're trying to create a link from ~/.vim/.vimrc to ~/.vimrc.  What has me curious is that your source file is a really weird directory for that file to be in.

I know how to grep 2 keywords using 1 command, but I can only manage to color one of them in output . Here is my command:\ngrep 'keyword1' file.log | grep 'keyword2'\n\nOnly keyword2 is highlighted. How can I make keyword1 highlighted at the same time ?\n\nA: Try actual regular expressions, rather than piping to another instance of grep, e.g.:\ngrep -E \"\\<foo\\>.*\\<bar\\>\" file\n\nThis limits to matching lines in which this the keywords match in this order only, unfortunately. Anyway, the use of grep in your question is rather inefficient and you should avoid it. The answer of @DanielH is pretty much more straightforward for your case, probably.\nFor an 'or' matching of keywords, I use this regularly:\ngrep -E \"(foo|bar)\" file\n\n\nA: The grep command accepts a --color=always option, so you can use\ngrep 'keyword1' file.log --color=always | grep 'keyword2'\n\nAs gertvdijk points out, this command may be inefficient, but it will look for all lines that contain both keyword1 and keyword2. If you want to highlight them in different colors, you can use\ngrep 'keyword1' file.log --color=always | GREP_COLORS=\"mt=01;34\" grep --color=always 'keyword2'\n\nwhich will highlight keyword2 in blue. The mt part means that grep will highlight matching text using this CSI code, and 01;34 means \"bold blue foreground on normal background\".\n", "Q: How do I pair with a bluetooth mouse via a USB dongle? I have a Microsoft Sculpt Touch bluetooth mouse, and a bluetooth/USB dongle.\nI have tried to pair with the mouse by going to System Settings > Bluetooth and clicking on the \"+\" button to add a device. This launches the Bluetooth New Device Setup wizard, which lists the mouse at the Device Search stage.\nI can only click \"Continue\" on the wizard if I select a PIN option (or tell it not to use one). But I always just see:\n\nConnecting to '(null)'...\n\n...followed by:\n\nSetting up '(null)' failed.\n\nHow do I connect to and use the mouse?\nThe dongle is listed by lsusb as:\nBus 005 Device 002: ID 0a12:0001 Cambridge Silicon Radio, Ltd Bluetooth Dongle (HCI mode)\n\nAfter plugging it in, dmesg shows:\n[  256.876091] usb 5-1: new full-speed USB device number 2 using uhci_hcd\n[  257.132851] Bluetooth: Generic Bluetooth USB driver ver 0.6\n[  257.135389] usbcore: registered new interface driver btusb\n\nI'm using 12.04 with kernel 3.2.0-35-generic.\n\nA: Explicitly set the pin to 0000 or whatever your mouse takes before starting the search, then you should be able to proceed.\nIf clicking on the bluetooth icon  in the notification bar shows a Bluetooth Mouse, click on that entry, and if it says connected, disconnect it.  Disconnect the mouse battery. Then repeat the icon click and click on connect, and repeat once more clicking on connect. Then connect the mouse battery, and it should start the pairing.  Sometimes there is a little button on the mouse to for the pairing also, but the battery disconnect seems to work better for me.\n  Confirm that the btusb and bluetooth modules are present when you run  \nlsmod\n\nWhen you look at the bluetooth settings, is the mouse connected but not paired?  This is what I see with my working bluetooth mouse.  Here's a heads up for you, 12.10 has more serious problems with bluetooth mice than 12.04.  My working mouse in 12.04 mouse loses its movement info to something in the notification bar, probably the battery indicator which added the bluetooth mouse in 12.10. Never any problems in 12.04, and it still connects just fine in 12.10, just doesn't work until I kill the notification bar.  Try removing other usb devices, try another usb port, (change batteries in the mouse?).  \n\nA: This was due to (a) really bad BT/wifi drivers for the Realtek 8723BE chipset in my wifi card and (b) the Sculpt mouse's weird power-saving behaviour. The answer is simply: you can't, in this case. I had to buy a different mouse and wait three years for the kernel to support it.\n", "Q: Permanent permission change to sys file I'd like to always give my user the permission to write on a specific file located in the /sys folder.\nThis because in the solution I posted here I have the problem that every time I reboot I have to reset the permission on the file with chmod.\nI tried to follow this guide but it didn't work.

Second, the touchpad will occasionally go into a state where it jumps all over the screen and is completely unusable.

But, if I open a app outside the shell command line, for example, choosing from the unity dash, the same apps can't see my custom PATH.\nI tried putting shopt -s expand_aliases in my .bash_aliases, but without success.\nHow can I set a PATH for environments other than BASH?\n\nA: If you're running apps outside the shell command line that will always run with your UID, you can create session-wide environment variables by adding them to ~/.pam_environment, rather than .bash_aliases.\nIf you're running apps outside the shell command line that will not always run with your UID, system-wide environment variables by adding them to /etc/environment, rather than .bash_aliases. \nHowever: Creating system-wide environment variables will affect ALL users, including root. If the variable you set overwrites another, bad things will happen. Adding something onto the end of PATH doesn't seem like it will cause any havoc, but seeing as you don't have root, you would need your sysadmin to do it for you, and s/he can probably advise you as to whether it is safe to add it. Whether s/he actually allows you to do this is something else entirely; anything user-related is best kept within the config files within their home folder, and it is not normally 'done' to have a users configuration affecting the whole system!\n\nA: The PATH environment variable does not belong in ~/.bash_aliases; a better place is  ~/.profile or ~/.pam_environment recently. If you put your path in ~/.profile, it will be available to X and the window managers that use X. Edit ~/.profile. Add to the end of that file:\nPATH=\"$PATH:$HOME/opt/bin\"\nMaybe you are using Xubuntu? You may need to use ~/.bashrc instead. And ~/.pam_environment:\nPATH DEFAULT=${PATH}:~/opt/bin\nSee help.ubuntu.com on Environment variables.\nWhat does belong in ~/.bash_aliases are command aliases, like this:\nalias l=ls\nalias ll=ls -l\nalias la=la -la\nalias x=exit\nalias b=my-insanely-long-command-i-never-want-to-type-again\n\n", "Q: How to change Guake cursor from block to I-Beam? As the title says, I want to change the cursor of Guake to I-Beam (the vertical line). I find block cursor to be confusing sometimes. I looked into the preferences but unfortunately there is no option for the cursor. Is it possible to change?\n\nA: There is a patch at guake.org, which you can download to patch the source code, compile and install the program. This is the only way at present to get the option you want; it does work though (see screenshots below). This is how I did it.\nThe patch should be downloaded from here as a file; it is designed to work with the 0.42 source code, but could be tweaked to work with any source code available, such as the more recent 0.4.4. (Inspecting the 0.4.4 source code suggests that the patch might be implemented in that version, but when compiled, the option to switch to i-beam cursor didn't seem to work.)\nHowever, it is straightforward to use the 0.42 source code, so download that file, cd to the downloads folder with terminal and unpack it with:\ntar xzvf guake-0.4.2.tar.gz\n\nBefore you do anything else, remove the current version of guake if you have it installed, and then install the build dependencies and other tools with:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential checkinstall \nsudo apt-get build-dep guake\n\nAs noted in my comment, to get the build-dep feature to work, you need to go to software sources and enable source code by checking the box. Then run sudo apt-get update and any build-dep commands should work. The build dependencies are also listed in the Readme file with the source code download as python-dev, libgconf2-dev, libgtk2.0-dev, python-gtk-dev.\nNow, while in the folder in which you downloaded the files, copy the patch to the guake folder with\ncp CursorShape.patch guake-0.4.2/\n\nNext, cd to the guake folder and patch the source code with\npatch -p1 < CursorShape.patch\n\nThen configure and build the files with\n./configure && make\n\nThe final step is to run\nsudo checkinstall\n\nbut when you install it, make sure you specify the version number in the checkinstall menu as not 0.4.2, but 0.4.3 or something similar, as you will constantly be prompted to overwrite your custom version with the package version (0.4.2) if you don't specify a higher version number.\nScreenshots showing the patched version preferences and the guake terminal respectively.\n\n\n", "Q: What is the difference between single user mode, recovery mode from GRUB, and booting with Ubuntu install disk? What is the difference between the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Entering single user mode, e.g. telinit 1\n\n*Entering recovery mode, at the GRUB screen selecting Ubuntu ... (recovery mode)\n\n*Using the Ubuntu installation DVD and entering the command line\n\n\nIn what cases would you use the different options for recovery/administration work?\n\nA: Runlevel\nFormal explanation\nAccording to wikipedia, The term runlevel refers to a mode of operation in one of the computer operating systems that implement Unix System V-style initialization.  \nBasically every Multi-User or Time Sharing system allow several users to log in at same time when system is running in multi-user mode (Default mode of modern OS). However there are situations, like kernel upgrade or other maintenance, when you have to make sure that no other user is logged into system that can possibly alter the resources or processes, You can do same by bringing the runlevel down to single user mode so that only a single user is allowed to log in who is authorized to perform the desired task.\nYou can say that A runlevel is a software configuration of the system which allows only a selected group of processes to exist.\nIn linux system telinit utility is used to change system runlevel among 6 possible values:  \n0 System Halt\n1 Single user\n2 Full multi-user mode (Default)\n3 Full multi-user mode\n4 Full multi-user mode\n5 Full multi-user mode\n6 System Reboot \nRecovery Mode\nRecovery mode is same as the single user mode but it allows only a selected kind of programs to run, Recovery mode make sure that only a program which is absolutely necessary to run the system is loaded, It prevent any other programs to load by default to prevent a possible failure due to any malfunctioned configuration or program.  \nLive Mode\nWhen you boot using a live linux CD you have a completely different operating system and configuration than that of pre-installed on your system, This is because of the fact that you are actually using the operating system made available through the live CD.  \nYou can use telinit to switch between Single User mode or Multi user mode when there are more than one users who use the same Operating system and it is necessary to perform a task which might be interrupted by another user if logged in, such as fsck or kernel upgrade etc.\nRescue mode is best to overcome most of the system malfunctions such as an installed package which can prevent system to boot as it allows you to log into system even if you cannot boot into regular mode  \nYou can boot into live mode for various testing or diagnostic purpose. Live mode provides you access to system hardware and even the installed OS using the chroot utility. When nothing helps and you cannot find a way to log into the system you can boot into live mode and chroot into the installed system.\n\nA: *\n\n*Single User Mode is a mode in which a multi-user system is booted into a single superuser environment. When in this mode, quite a few non-essential services are not run, such as the networking services (which also prevents an outside intrusion). It is often used when exclusive access to disks are required; for example when one needs to run fsck, as no other users will have access to the disks.\n\n*Recovery Mode is essentially the same as Single User Mode.\n\n*Getting a command line on an Ubuntu Live CD is a completely different matter. You have a session on the Live Environment that has been loaded into the memory from the CD. While you may have root privileges (if you use su to get a root shell), they are root privileges on the Live Environment, not on your installed environment. This is normally used if a problem has stopped you accessing your installation, in which case you would use the tools in the live environment directed at the installation; for example if you have killed GRUB, you could run sudo grub-install /dev/sda && sudo update-grub to fix it. If your problem can only be solved with access to the installed system, and you cannot access it, you can use chroot to make your terminal emulator act as if you are in the installed environment.\n\n\nToo long; didn't read: If you can boot into the system, and you have a problem, use recovery mode (no-one really uses single user mode). If you can't boot into the system, and you need to fix something that doesn't need direct access to the system, use a Live CD. If you can't boot into the system, and you need to fix something that does need direct access to the system, use a Live CD and chroot. \n", "Q: Downloaded Kubuntu 12.10 and installed Ubuntu 11.10 I wanted to install Kubuntu 12.10 from USB on a brand new computer, with no OS.\nI downloaded the file and started the computer with the USB.\nIt installed Ubuntu 11.10.\nWhy and how can I change that?\n\nA: I can only assume that you have inadvertently downloaded the wrong image.

I recommend doing that--it seems to be what you intended to do first.\nWubi Troubleshooting\nIf you did want to install Ubuntu inside Windows with Wubi, and you are using Windows Vista or later, the permission denied error can often be fixed by right-clicking Wubi.exe and clicking Run as Administrator. Running Wubi.exe with normal abilities when UAC is enabled will fail.\nIf that doesn't work, then you must consult the log file that the error message referred to, to see what is wrong. It should have been created in the same folder that contains Wubi.exe itself. If you can make sense of what the log file tells you, you may be able to solve the problem. Otherwise, you should edit your question to include the text from the log file, or post it at http://paste.ubuntu.com and add a link to it in your question. (You can then comment here to notify me.)\nWith all that said, remember, unless you want a Wubi system, I recommend you install a normal Ubuntu system alongside Windows by creating and booting from a USB flash drive (or CD/DVD) as explain in Web-E's answer.\nInability to Boot Ubuntu After Installing Alongside Windows\nWeb-E and I had both thought you meant that when you created the bootable USB flash drive to install Ubuntu alongside Windows, you were unable to boot from it and start the installation.\nHowever, if the problem is that you can install Ubuntu but when you try to boot it, it just boots into Windows, this is caused by Ubuntu's boot loader, GRUB2, not being installed to the master boot record.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.\nI've included my xorg.conf file\nxorg.conf\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n    Identifier     \"Razer Naga\"\n    Driver         \"mouse\"\n    Option         \"Protocol\" \"auto\"\n    Option         \"Device\" \"/dev/psaux\"\n    Option         \"Emulate3Buttons\" \"no\"\n    Option         \"ZAxisMapping\" \"4 5\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n    Identifier     \"Razer Lycosa\"\n    Driver         \"kbd\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier     \"VS10859 ViewSonic Widescreen\"\n    VendorName     \"ViewSonic\"\n    ModelName      \"DFP-0\"\n#   DisplaySize    433.44 270.9\n    HorizSync      30.0 - 82.0\n    VertRefresh    50.0 - 75.0\n    ModeLine       \"1680x1050_60.00\" 146.25 1680 1784 1960 2240 1050 1053 1059 1089\n    Option         \"PreferredMode\" \"1680x1050_60.00\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"GTX 660 Ti\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n    BoardName      \"GeForce GTX 660 Ti\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"Primary Screen\"\n    Device         \"GTX 660 Ti\"\n    Monitor        \"VS10859 ViewSonic Widescreen\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    Option         \"nvidiaXineramaInfoOrder\" \"DFP-0\"\n    Option         \"metamodes\" \"1680x1050_60 +0+0; nvidia-auto-select +0+0\"\n    SubSection     \"Display\"\n        Depth       24\n        Modes      \"1680x1050\" \"1280x1024\"\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nSection \"ServerLayout\"\n    Identifier     \"Default Layout\"\n    Screen         \"Primary Screen\"\n    InputDevice    \"Razer Naga\" \"CorePointer\"\n    InputDevice    \"Razer Lycosa\" \"CoreKeyboard\"\n    Option         \"Xinerama\" \"0\"\nEndSection\n\n\nA: Working on it all day, I've come to the conclusion that problem lies solely in the monitor, VX2025wm's have a history of problems for the EDID and DVI Input, such as not showing native resolution, Signal Not Found errors, and a bunch of other messy little things that aren't conducive to a fluid computing environment.\nThe solution lied in adding a Custom EDID to the xorg.conf file:\nOption         \"CustomEDID\" \"DFP-0:/etc/X11/viewsonic.raw\"\n\nFor this specific monitor, I was able to find the EDID here:\nhttp://blog.komeil.com/2008/06/fixing-edid-dvi-monitors-no-signal.html\nI hope this helps anyone who is having problems with their native resolution and is certain that their Graphics Cards / Drivers are not the problem.\nExample: xorg.conf\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n    Identifier     \"Razer Naga\"\n    Driver         \"mouse\"\n    Option         \"Protocol\" \"auto\"\n    Option         \"Device\" \"/dev/psaux\"\n    Option         \"Emulate3Buttons\" \"no\"\n    Option         \"ZAxisMapping\" \"4 5\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n    Identifier     \"Razer Lycosa\"\n    Driver         \"kbd\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier     \"VS10859 ViewSonic Widescreen\"\n    VendorName     \"ViewSonic\"\n    ModelName      \"DFP-0\"\n    HorizSync       30.0 - 82.0\n    VertRefresh     50.0 - 75.0\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"GTX 660 Ti\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n    BoardName      \"GeForce GTX 660 Ti\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"Primary Screen\"\n    Device         \"GTX 660 Ti\"\n    Monitor        \"VS10859 ViewSonic Widescreen\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    Option         \"nvidiaXineramaInfoOrder\" \"DFP-0\"\n    Option         \"CustomEDID\" \"DFP-0:/etc/X11/viewsonic.raw\"\n    SubSection     \"Display\"\n        Depth       24\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nSection \"ServerLayout\"\n    Identifier     \"Default Layout\"\n    Screen         \"Primary Screen\"\n    InputDevice    \"Razer Naga\" \"CorePointer\"\n    InputDevice    \"Razer Lycosa\" \"CoreKeyboard\"\n    Option         \"Xinerama\" \"0\"\nEndSection\n\n", "Q: What command should I type to run Chrome from the terminal? I have remote box accessed by VNC and jwm desktop.\nNo menus, not desktop icons, only a terminal window.\nI have downloaded Chrome's .deb package and installed it. \nHow can I run it from the terminal window?\n\nA: In Ubuntu 15.10 this command works very well\ngoogle-chrome www.google.com\n\nfor more options you can use\ngoogle-chrome --help\n\n\nA: Type\ngoogle-chrome-stable\n\nI use this command and it works for me. I too installed it using the .deb package. So this should work for you too. Typing an url after the command opens the url.\n\nA: If you get the path where the application is installed then you can run the application from there\nFor example to know the path where google-chrome is located run this command:\nwhereis google-chrome\n\nYou will get the path like:\ngoogle-chrome: /usr/bin/google-chrome /usr/bin/X11/google-chrome /usr/share/man/man1/google-chrome.1\n\nNow you can run chrome by either executing two commands:\n/usr/bin/google-chrome\n/usr/bin/X11/google-chrome\n\nNote: it will be applied for all installed applications. Also, It would be possible that you would not get the path /usr/bin/X11 or would get something different.\nHope you like this way to find the path and run chrome :)\n\nA: Enter to opengoogle-chrome, and exit google-chrome to close the Chrome browser\n\nA: Well simply typing google-chrome works fine for me. It might not work if you installed Chromium. chromium-browser is for Chromium.\n\n\n*\n\n*For Chrome:\ngoogle-chrome\n\n\n*For Chromium:\nchromium-browser\n\nHowever if it's a remote box... At least via ssh you must use -X when option connecting to be able to run windowed apps. Like this:\nssh -X username@server.lt\n\n", "Q: could not decode stream in Ubuntu 12.10 When I want to play Radio Stream in Clementine, I get error:could not decode stream.\nI installed w32codecs, but is not solved.\nsudo apt-get -y install w32codecs ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\nHow can I solve this ?\n\nA: open your terminal and install gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad and/or gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad-multiverse.\nyou can do that by\nsudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad-multiverse\n\nyou can also use synaptic or software centre to install.\nhope that helps.\n", "Q: Dual Booting Pre-installed Windows 8 I've recently purchased a Lenovo T430, and sadly when configuring it, I forgot all about the Linux UEFI Fiasco, and kept the default option of pre-installing Windows 8. \nI'm able to disable secure-boot, but what I would like to know is whether I need to install Ubuntu in UEFI or Legacy Mode. I am aware is possible to find this out by installing Ubuntu along side Windows normally and fixing it if it fails (trial & error in my opinion), but I would rather install Ubuntu normally, or install it in UEFI mode first off.\n\nA: Give a try with ubuntu 12.10 64 bit. (32 bit won't detect efi). \nBasically you need to create a 250mb partition to store efi if you choose manual partition,\nand use boot-repair tool to fix the boot if any problem comes.\nFor more details please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI . \nDisabling UEFI is best option but  you may need to reinstall windows 8.\n\nA: Try doing an EFI-mode installation. Creating a separate EFI System Partition (ESP), as Web-E suggested, is not necessary; Ubuntu and Windows can share a single ESP.\nIf you do a BIOS-mode installation by accident, it's possible to convert Linux to boot in EFI mode. The Linux-side conversion is pretty straightforward, but it will take jumping through a few hoops to get the Linux boot loader to launch.\nI'm not much of a fan of the \"boot repair\" tool; it does weird and non-standard things that can make it harder for other utilities to cope with the disk. Avoid it if possible.\n", "Q: Can't start MySQL server if the .sock file is changed in /etc/mysql/my.cnf I have installed MySQL server 5.5 on Ubuntu 12.04.\nI am trying to start MySQL server on a different sock file.

This machine is always run by mains electricity rather than by battery as I have hooked it up to my 40\" TV.  It works like a dream in every respect - except one...\nIf I want to watch a video longer than 10 minutes the power-saving blank screen associated with an inactive keyboard/mouse kicks in; a tap of a key or movement of the mouse restores the display instantly. This is irritating and happens for both 10.10 and 12.10.  I have tried the following remedies:\n\n\n*\n\n*Checked BIOS for advanced setting that might override Ubuntu commands (no such settings exist)\n\n*Changed system Power settings in 12.10 to 'Don't suspend' (battery or plugged in) for inactive behavior and 'Do nothing' when lid is closed for battery and plugged in.  \"When power is critically low\" has been left with the default blank (although this is not really applicable as the unit is always plugged in).\n\n*Changed system Brightness and Lock settings in 12.10 to 'Turn screen off when inactive for:' to Never.  Lock is set to 'Off' and 'Turns screen off' option is greyed out. Brightness is set to maximum and 'Dim screen to save power' is unchecked.\n\n*I have checked out the Displays, Keyboard and mouse settings but there is nothing of relevance there.\n\n*I have seen a similar question on Ask Ubuntu but there were no satisfactory permanent solutions for Ubuntu 12.10 “Turn screen off when inactive for: Never” still turns off as\n\n*sudo xset s off did not work\n\n*sudo xset s 0 0 did work within the session (screensaver timeout = 0; cycle =0 ) but on rebooting from cold xset q showed a reverted screensaver timeout = 600; cycle = 600  - so it is not an acceptable solution.  (Yes - I do have administrator rights!)\n\n\nOne annoying facet of this problem is that the screen goes blank after 10 minutes of inactivity and it takes 10 (very long) minutes to find out if a solution has worked so any trial and error method of solving this has a significant time penalty for me.\nHas anyone experienced and successfully overcome this problem?\n\nA: This is how I do it for v12.10\nGo to the dconf Editor > settings daemon > plugins > power (schema: org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power)\nMake sure the boxes for \"idle-dim-ac\" and \"idle-dim-battery\" are both unchecked. That will set both booleans to false.

The only think i can do is to type in the website adress again and then it directs me correctly. \nHow can i remove this? I'm working on ubuntu 12.10\n\nA: Well, you can try purging Google Chrome. This will remove your history, favorites, and everything that isn't cloud-synched.\nOpen up Synaptic Package Manager. If you don't have it, install it from the Ubuntu Software Center as it is quite useful.\nIn Synaptic, search for Chrome or Chromium in the quick search bar. If you see any with green filled in boxes, that means they are installed. Click on the green box and select the option to remove completely with configuration. Now, click the checkmark in the top bar of the Synaptic window to apply changes. Confirm as needed.\nThen, reinstall Google Chrome or Chromium. You can do so within Synaptic by searching chromium-browser and clicking the box in its row in the list of packages to install it, then clicking the checkmark to perform the planned installation.\nThanks to Vasa1, I've realized this may not help.\nSo, type Alt+F2 and enter nautilus  ~/.config/. Now, rename the chromium folder to oldchromium if it exists, and do something similar with the google-chrome folder.\nWith that said, if you did cloudsync, any other Chrome installations also cloudsynched may be hijacked in the same way.\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu on a CR-48 Chromebook?

How can I get a list of commands that have been installed with a particular package?\nFor example, if I install Chromium, what should type now? Or if I install moreutils, how do I know which commands have been installed?\n\nA: Short answer:\ndpkg -L packagename | grep 'bin/'\n\nLong answer:\nTo get a list of all files installed in a package (say moreutils), run this command:\ndpkg -L moreutils\n\nNow, all we need to do is filter out the ones that are executable files in the path. In general, commands are installed to /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin and /usr/sbin, so we can simply match those patterns:\ndpkg -L moreutils | grep -e '^/bin/' -e '^/sbin/' -e '^/usr/bin/' -e '^/usr/sbin/'\n\nIf you want something that's easier to memorise, but not completely accurate, just filter out lines with bin/ instead:\n$ dpkg -L moreutils | grep 'bin/'\n/usr/bin/isutf8\n/usr/bin/pee\n/usr/bin/errno\n/usr/bin/vidir\n/usr/bin/zrun\n/usr/bin/lckdo\n/usr/bin/ifne\n/usr/bin/mispipe\n/usr/bin/parallel\n/usr/bin/sponge\n/usr/bin/ts\n/usr/bin/ifdata\n/usr/bin/vipe\n/usr/bin/chronic\n/usr/bin/combine\n\nSo, in this example, I have discovered these commands: isutf8, pee, errno, etc.\n\nSome packages don't install commands into the path, but do install an icon for the GUI app. If you want to find the command that launches the application, you will need to find the installed .desktop file, and look at the line beginning with Exec=. For example:\n$ dpkg -L worldofgoo | grep '\\.desktop$'\n/usr/share/applications/WorldOfGoo.desktop\n\n$ grep '^Exec=' /usr/share/applications/WorldOfGoo.desktop \nExec=/opt/WorldOfGoo/WorldOfGoo\n\nSo in this example, I have discovered that I should run /opt/WorldOfGoo/WorldOfGoo to launch World Of Goo from the terminal.\n", "Q: How to analyze a \"[Waiting for headers]\" problem during \"apt-get update\"? sudo apt-get update sometimes becomes stucked:\n...\n99% [Waiting for headers]\n\nThis seems to be a common problem and can have several reasons.

So, does putting any of these on the Sandisk make sense? Is there something that would? Or should I just leave it empty?\n\nA: If you don't care about using Samsung SSD space put everything in there as it's the best choice, although putting /boot partition on Sandisk SSD can save you some space in the Samsung SSD and it won't affect too much your system, the only thing that would change is a boot time increased for about 5 or 10 seconds.\n\nA: It has become common practice to put / on a small SSD (32 or 64Gb) and /home on an much larger HDD, SAS or SSHD to speed things up and keep it all low cost and take advantage of cheep access to very large drives (2, 4 or event 8Tb HDD or SSHD). You can access both drives at the same time and read and write will also increase marginally.\nPutting / on a small SSD and /home on a larger SSD is even better, access time being that small, no noticeable difference there, but on read and write, certainly so... Mind you, you won't see any noticeable difference if both are M.2... Than comes the question of what to do with swap??? 1. If you have over 8Gb of RAM, I doubt that you'll ever need one. Swap is faster on SSD, but never as fast as RAM; and keep in mind that swap on an SSD shortens its life, so go for more RAM instead. But, should you need one, put it on the small SSD if it is is at least 64Gb or otherwise on the larger one if it is only 32Gb. To lengthen the life of the 64Gb SSD, get an SLC instead of an MLC SSD...

If it's an older one (made in 2009 or earlier, before Advanced Format became common), it's not an issue; but if it's a newer disk, partition alignment to 8-sector boundaries is important.

I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 with XBMC and am streaming media files from my fileserver (mounted using NFS).\nRight now I have fstab configured to mount my NFS share like this:\n192.168.0.99:/tank/media   /mnt/media   nfs4 _netdev,auto     0 0\n\nHowever, sometimes the mount is not yet available (?) when XBMC starts, so when I try to play a file from that mount it freezes (i.e. just waits, and waits...).  To fix the problem I need to SSH into the server and mount -a.  (or it sometimes I can wait a few minutes and it might fix itself and/or finish mounting.\nIs it better to use AutoFS for this situation?  If not, what other options are available?\nEDIT: I also want the mount to be resilient against file server downtime or weird network issues, etc.\n\nA: I have used static mounts for years for media files with good results since we want them highly available. However we have a dedicated HTPC/MediaServer runinning 24/7 (it takes backups at night from the destops too). I've thought AutoFS seemed complicated vs just mounting the server partitons in fstab and letting them run. I don't like switching harddisks off and on. \nI wonder why your mounts are behaving like this? is something odd about how you've setup your nfs4 mounts? I think I fixed a similar problem with the 'crossmnt' option on the parent directory in the /etc/exports entry. The child mounts would be delayed for a while after I opened the parent export folder. I think with the crossmnt option on the top level /etc/export entry; the child mounts popped up quickly but it has been a while since I solved that issue. \nListing your /etc/exports would help.\nOn the client side:\n$cat /proc/mounts | grep nfs4\n\nwill show all the client nfs4 mount options you are ending up with.\nThis from might help you from nfs - fstab format and options for the nfs file systems\n   bg / fg        Determines  how  the  mount(8)  command  behaves  if  an\n                  attempt  to mount an export fails.

I know that one key to UNIX administration is not to use the Admin account as little as possible, which I'm trying to enforce on their machine. I've looked at other articles regarding this, but they do the easy way out - changing the account to Administrator. That is changing the permissions completely. I want my standard user account to be able to execute sudo commands, but not be an administrator account. Thank you in advance for any help.\n\nA: Ubuntu has taken care of these issues for you, you don't need to worry about the Standard user or even the Administrator using the Super User priviledges all the time. In order to be able to use the sudo command, the Standard User needs to be listed in the /etc/sudoers file; the Administrator is automatically listed in this file. To add a user to this file, type the following command at the terminal:sudo nano /etc/sudoersYou will see the following lines:%sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALLJust add the name of the user who is to be able to use the sudo priviledges below these lines. To save the file, press Ctrl + o and to exit, press Ctrl + x.Unless the user is listed here, she won't be able to use the sudo command, and it will return the error \"The user\"(the user name) is not listed in the sudoers list. This incident will be reported.\n", "Q: upstart init script remains on apt-get remove I just created my first .deb file ever from a Python script.

Is this normal behaviour? \nIsn't it bad that the upstart script will be trying to run my program on every boot of a user's machine even if they have removed my application?\n\nA: apt-get remove only removes the packages, it does not remove the associated configuration files of the package.\napt-get purge is the command snippet you use if you also want to remove a package's configuration files.

I am trying to make a python environment separate from the system one (using virtualenv) in a directory which is not under /home, because I need to use it to build other software that has to be accessible to multiple users. I can create and activate the virtualenv all right, but when I sudo some command (for example to make or compile other software), it is the system python that is used (I can tell because of the available modules).\nSince on Ubuntu it is not a good thing to use the root user, is there a way to tell sudo to use a virtualenv? Or maybe this is not the correct approach, and I should make a completely new python installation?\nI am using the 64bit version of Ubuntu 12.04 (and python 2.7).\n\nA: Depending on your particular use-case this may or may not solve your problem, but this wasn't yet mentioned here.  Say, you want to run a Python script that was installed in your virtual environment, and you need to setuid(0) it, i.e. you want to run it as superuser. Say, your script is called myscript.py, then, you can do it like this:\n(.venv) $ sudo -E env PATH=$PATH ./myscript.py\n\nExplanation\n(.venv) $ is the shell's prompt, you don't need to type it, it just shows that you are currently using some virtual environment, and you are not a privileged user.\nsudo -E will tell sudo that when starting a process, it needs to copy the environment variables from your current shell environment.  So, if you have any extra variables defined in .venv/bin/activate script, they should stick around while you are root.\nenv PATH=$PATH when using sudo -E not all environment variables are preserved, specifically, and most importantly, the PATH may be removed. The specifics of this behavior will depend on your sudoers file.  This, however, will circumvent whatever's written in sudoers file, as it will copy the PATH explicitly into environment sudo creates for the new process. This is important because when your system resolves shebang comment in your myscript.py, it will look in the PATH variable, and the first directory to match the requirement for interpreter will be used. venv on the other hand, sets up the shell environment in such a way that the directory containing the symlink to the chosen Python interpreter appears first, thus causing system to locate the desired Python before any other Pythons on system path.\n\nA: The issue is almost certainly that when you run sudo, the virtualenv environment variables, aliases, functions, etc aren't being carried over.\nThe solution would be to explicitly run the virtual environment's Python executable with sudo. For example if your virtualenv is ./AwesomeProject, then you could run sudo ./AwesomeProject/bin/python <script> to use the script with the virtualenv with root privileges.\n\nA: Just stumbled across this and for others who may find the same issue, Ken is correct that the env variables are not being carried over.  The solution I used was to add the following lines to my script.  This has the added benefit of always loading the virtual environment directly from the script.  (Meaning you can use the script with crontab or launchd without any other workarounds.) \nbase_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))\nactivate_this = os.path.join(base_dir, 'venv/bin/activate_this.py')\nexecfile(activate_this, dict(__file__=activate_this))\n\nMore background here: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide.html#using-virtualenv-without-bin-python\n\nA: Sometimes you need the $PATH updated because the script runs other programs. For example pypi-install needs py2dsc-deb in the PATH. This command works: sudo sh -c \". venv/bin/activate ; pypi-install $PACKAGE\"\n", "Q: Recovering files/not booting on Windows 7 after installing Ubuntu My friend installed Ubuntu 12.04 on my HP Laptop, and now I can't boot windows and all my work files are gone.

I have tried many solutions provided in the internet but none of them are working. After mounting the guest additions tools and running ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run it fails. \nHere is a screenshot of the problem:\n\nHow to solve this problem?\n\nA: The errors seem to be because you have a whole bunch of programs missing on your guess. The shell script tries to install the graphical X guest additions (even though you apparently don't have X installed on your server). It also tries to compile the guest kernel modules, but you have neither GCC nor the kernel headers installed, so it fails.\nNormally the package manager would automate installing dependencies you need, but a shell script can't do that.\nFortunately, the Guest Additions have been available in the Ubuntu universe repositories for a while. You can install them using from the package virtualbox-guest-utils (on the guest). You probably want to skip installing the virtualbox-guest-x11 package which virtualbox-guest-utils recommends, since you don't have X. The necessary compilers, headers, and DKMS stuff should get installed automatically. Be aware that this will use roughly 200 MB of additional disk space.\n\nA: For compiling the Virtual Box Guest Additions we may need the following packages:\n\ndkms build-essential linux-headers-generic\n\nThe build-essentials package will also include the installation of gcc needed to compile Guest Additions.\nNote however, that the only benefit you will have from Guest Additions on a GUI-less server installation is support of USB2.0.

I've used Ubuntu in the past, mostly as a system rescue disk, but I've got a couple of servers running it, so I'm no stranger to the platform.\nAnyway, the problem I'm having is that while the laptop will suspend normally both through the menu option and by closing the lid, when it resumes the backlight becomes what can only be described as a strobe light: after a few seconds of black after waking the computer (which is normal), the display lights up to the brightest white I've ever seen come from it for a split second, then turns off again. This repeats about every two seconds until I hold the power button to turn it off. If I look carefully during one of the flashes, the display seems to be displaying some uneven horizontal lines across the upper half of the screen.\nNow, from what I've been reading, this is most likely a display driver problem.

I do not have physical access to that machine and I can do only ssh to the machine. I wanted to do remote desktop and came up with lot of options (vnc, xrdp, opennx). I used xrdp and I installed the necessary packages in the ubuntu machine (xrdp and dependent). Then I enabled the remote access in the ubuntu using the following command line option.\ngconftool-2 -s -t bool /desktop/gnome/remote_access/enabled true\n\ngconftool-2 -s -t bool /desktop/gnome/remote_access/prompt_enabled false\n\nThen I restarted the xrdp (/etc/init.d/xrdp start). But when I try to do rdp using the windows client (mstsc), I get the following error. Remote access to the server is not enabled. \nHow do I solve this? Kindly help.\nRaj\n\nA: I'm not familiar with xrdp in particular, but the first thing I'd check is to see if the port its using is a) listening for connections and b) open to the outside world. The default port for RDP is 3389.\nThe first is pretty easy to check; simply run this in terminal on the machine you're trying to connect to (change 3389 if xrdp is listening on a different port):\nnetstat -an | grep \"LISTEN \" | grep \":3389\"\n\nIf you get something similar to the following, something at least (hopefully xrdp) is listening for connections:\ntcp        0      0 127.0.1.1:3389            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN\n\nIf you don't get any output, try (re)starting xrdp or check to make sure you have the right port.\nNext, you need to make sure that the machine is accessible to the Internet on that port, which involved two things: making sure that the firewall on the machine itself isn't blocking connections to that port, and making sure that any network device (i.e. a router) between the computer you're trying to connect to and the Internet isn't blocking connections. PortForward.com can help with the latter; the first depends on what kind of firewall is installed on your machine, if any.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: I finally got this to work for me;\nsetup: older laptop running ubuntu 13.10 running standard unity; I have installed cairo dock (which makes it much more usable for me); still not used to the left side app bar;\nIt would be nice to be able to use my win7 system to rdp into this ubuntu 13.10 so I spent a couple of hours this morning doing research.

I installed the gnome-session-fallback:\n$ sudo apt-get install gnome-session-fallback\n$ echo \"gnome-session --session=gnome-fallback\" > ~/.xsession\n\nThis didn't work; I got the same blank screen, but found another URL that suggested another windows session mgr like XFCE, so I installed xubuntu desktop:\n$ sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop\n$ echo \"xfce4-session\" > ~/.xsession\n\nDon't forget to sudo /etc/init.d/xrdp restart after all the changes.\nThis worked. At first, on initial start-up of rdp session, I got the same blank screen but after 10 seconds (probably because I am using a win7 VDI at work from a remote location) up popped a usable xfce xubuntu desktop; not as nice as gnome but very usable.\nHope this info will be useful, as I couldn't get the initial attempts to work for me.\nDave\n\nA: On file /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini add address=0.0.0.0 which is the default xrdp address.\nAlso you have to permit firewall to listen to connections on port 3389 that xrdp is working on.

You'll be fine with that if you follow step by step (promise!).\n\nRemote Desktop between any OS's Step-By-Step guide\nI. Windows to / from Windows: \nUse Windows Remote Desktop software\nII. Linux / Unix to / from anywhere\nFirst do the following on the server computer that you will connect via remote desktop:\n- Allow other users to view your desktop\n- Best to require a password\n- service ssh status\n- To allow computers to connect with X11 graphics system capabilities as well, you need to \n    install an X11 server on the computer that is trying to connect (client). So\n    * for a Windows computer use XMing\n    * for a Linux Ubuntu computer use XQuartz\n\nIIa. Windows to Linux from terminal with graphics support\n- Launch XMing on Windows client\n- Launch Putty\n    * Fill in basic options\n    * Connection -> SSH -> X11\n        -> Enable X11 forwarding\n        -> X display location = :0.0\n        -> MIT-Magic-Cookie-1\n        -> X authority file for local display = point to the Xming.exe executable\n\nIIb. (b for better) Windows to Linux with full GUI support. This is what most of you will want.\n- install xrdp which uses the remote desktop protocol to present a GUI to the user. \n    It can provide a fully functional Linux terminal server, capable of accepting connections \n    from rdesktop, freerdp, and Microsoft's own terminal server / remote desktop clients. \n    xrdp is the daemon that handles RDP remote desktop access from Windows machines to Linux \n- edit the \"/etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini\" file to include the line:\n    address=0.0.0.0\n    right under #background=626x72 line. 0.0.0.0 is the local server address of xrdp\n- Restart xrdp service\n- allow xrdp port (probably 3389) through firewall\n- We also need a VNC server. Install tightvncserver on Linux server machine. \n- run tightvncserver (no need to create a view-only password)\n- \"netstat -lvp | grep vnc\" to check out the ports that tightvnc is listening on for \n    connections\n- allow the vncserver port from the firewall: sudo ufw allow #\n- allow the xrdp server\n- Install xfce4 desktop environment an update to xfce, minimalistic faster and lightweight\n    sudo apt-get install xfce4\n- sudo apt-get install xfce4-terminal : way better than xterm\n- sudo apt-get install gnome-icon-theme-full tango-icon-theme : installs icon sets\n- Now we modify 2 files to make sure xrdp uses xfce4\n    * echo xfce4-session >~/.xsession\n    * secondly we modify startup file for xRDP located at /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh\n        so it will start xfce4. Replace the last line with \n        startxfce4 \n        (before it had something which started with a ., but no matter whatever it is, just \n        replace the last line)\n    * restart xrdp service: sudo service xrdp restart\n- Now you are ready to log into the computer from client using Remote Desktop (mstsc.exe). \n    Just supply the ipv4 or hostname of the VNC server.\n\nIII. *nix to / from *nix\n- ssh -X [preferedUserName]@[targetIpv4Address] : -X flag enales X11 forwarding\n- accept security certificates from trusted hosts when prompted\n\nIV. Making the connection secure (optional step - applies to any configuration)\nVNC & xrdp protocols are not secure which means that they are not encrypted.\nTo make the connection secure edit the /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini file so that the address becomes 127.0.0.1. This will be the localhost address of the ssh server. SSH encryption will be used underneath to tunnel the vnc traffic.\n- sudo service xrdp restart\n- sudo service ssh restart\n- pkill Xtightvnc\n- tightvncserver\n- putty -> Connection -> SSH -> Tunnels \n    * Source port: 5555\n    * Destination: localhost:3389\n\n\nIf the above don't work:\n\n\n*\n\n*You may need to restart both computers,\n\n*Disable firewall (sudo ufw disable) on server pc and then recheck (might even need another restart).\n\n*If above don't work then you have messed up your system, by installing conflicting packages. You have to do manual troubleshooting on that (very unlikely you reach this step if you follow the instructions properly). \n\n\n\nSources and credit: \n\n\n*\n\n*\"danscourses\" channel excellent 4 video series on YouTube\n\n*https://www.tweaking4all.com/software/linux-software/use-xrdp-remote-access-ubuntu-14-04/\n\nA: Welcome to Ubuntu Community.\nFirst of all Check Network Settings of windows Virtual Machine in Virtual Box.

Note that the tunnel is tied to the ssh session - if you close that ssh session, the tunnel will also close and your connection to the remote desktop will drop. Make sure you use an unused port for the local side.\nIf connecting from a Windows system use putty and enable the ssh tunnelling options for your session (look at connection->SSH->Tunnels in the session configuration options.)\nOnce the tunnel is established you can use your chosen RDP client to connect. Several of the other answers address this part of the setup (personally I wound up following the xfce4-session suggestion.)\n\nA: Run the commands in terminal:\nsudo apt-get install xrdp\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:ubuntu-mate-dev/ppa\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:ubuntu-mate-dev/trusty-mate\nsudo apt-get update \nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-mate-core ubuntu-mate-desktop\n\n\necho mate-session >~/.xsession\nsudo service xrdp restart\n\n\nA: I think it is more important to show how to get to the real problem.\nSo, I'll contribute with this:\nChange in /etc/xrdp/sesman.ini and /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini LogLevel from INFO to DEBUG\nLogLevel=DEBUG\n\nAdd to Xvnc cmd (In /etc/xrdp/sesman.ini, under [Xvnc] )\nparam=-Log\nparam=*:syslog:50\n\nNow both xrdp and xvnc will tell you in logs (files in /var/logs/ ) what it is going on.\nEnjoy !!\n\nA: my problem is, that xfce4-session was still running after xrdp restart.. so i just had to kill it with\nsudo killall xfce4-session\n\n. not a solution but a quick workaround\n", "Q: Upgrading Ubuntu 11.04 to 12.04 while having Windows 7 I have Ubuntu 11.04 & Windows 7 dual-booting on my laptop and I want to upgrade to Ubuntu 12.04.\nI'd like to know whether this upgrade will damage my Windows partition.

If the videos work then, something is messed up with your installation of Chromium/Flash player. Try reinstalling it. If they still don't work, it may be a problem on YouTube's end or your ISP's end or somewhere in between. Could you comment with an example of a video that's giving you this error?\nAlso, does this appear to be a YouTube error, or an error that you're receiving from Flash/Chromium?\n\nA: Fix this problem by replacing the default, limited set of patent-free codecs, with the package containing all codecs. Run:\nsudo apt-get install chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra\n\n(Answer yes when asked if you want to remove chromium-codecs-ffmpeg and have chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra installed instead.)\nAfter the install, you'll need to restart Chromium.\nWhy this happens\nChromium is (for political/ideological reasons) by default only installed with patent-free codecs (Ogg, Vorbis and Theora), which means that much video and audio content on the web will be in formats that Chromium does not understand.\nThe chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra package contains both the patent-free, and a bunch of (widely used) patented codecs.\nDescription of the chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra package:\n\nThis package contains the multi-threaded ffmpeg codecs needed for the HTML5\n  <audio> and <video> tags. In addition to the patent-free ogg, vorbis\n  and theora codecs, aac / ac3 / mpeg4audio / h264 / mov / mp3 are also included.  See\n  chromium-codecs-ffmpeg if you prefer only the patent-free codecs\n\n\nA: I'm using Chromium Version 28.0.1500.52 Ubuntu 12.10 (28.0.1500.52-0ubuntu1.12.10.3) and faced with same issue. To solve issue you need to remove current set of chromium codecs:\nsudo apt-get remove chromium-codecs-ffmpeg\n\nAnd them install similar, but extra package:\nsudo apt-get install chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra\n\nYouTube trouble will be removed and video will be played.\nSo, common solution leads to update chrome/chromium codecs.\nYou can also be faced with proposition to install chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra while removing chromium-codecs-ffmpeg. Just apply suggestion to install package with extra version.\nAdditionally, will be useful to update current version of chromium browser to take newest version:\nsudo apt-get install chromium-browser\n\nThanks\n\nA: Same issue. In http://www.youtube.com/html5 player was set as flash. Problem was with cookies i deleted all browser cookies, than went to http://www.youtube.com/html5 enabled and disabled html5, than in new tab video started to work.\n\nA: But switching to viewing through a proxy server usually fixes the problem, it seems to be something to do with the region definition for the browser as Firefox seems to work unaided.\n", "Q: Firefox running very slow; Microphone does not work with Skype Hi I just installed Ubuntu 12.04 and Firefox is running very slow.

What can I do now?\n\nA: After complete installation make sure you change the controller : IDE settings of the virtual machine in its settings Window under \"storage\" to \"empty\" again from the \"bootable OS disk \" you used to install your virtual OS.  \nOtherwise what happens is that on restart your virtual machine, your machine keeps booting from the disk .\n", "Q: Why is disk usage greater than the size of all files on it? I have a 3TB HDD.  In the properties screen of the HDD, it says that I have used 471.4GB, but when I select all the files in nautilus, it says that 321.0GB is selected.  If I only have 321.0GB of files in the HDD, why is it using 471.4GB?\nThe HDD's partitioning is using GUID and file system being used in EXT4.  When I select the HDD using Disk Utility app, I get a warning saying:\nWARNING: The partition is misaligned by 3072 bytes.\nThis may result in very poor performance.  Repartitioning is suggested.\n\nHas that got anything to do with the missing 150.4GB?\n\nA: This happens because the total disk usage is never equal to the sum of all files there (which is what Nautilius shows once you select all files).\nThe reason for this is that the file systems themselves tend to occupy some space on the partition. Most likely, if you wiped out all data you store on that HDD, disk usage would be about 150GB. That space is reserved for the file system - it is required, as the file system need to store the data about files somewhere. ext4 pre-allocates this overhead space before any files are created, as opposed to - for example - ext3, where that space grows as more files are added to the partition.\nIf you consider these 150GB as a problem, please notice that it's just 5% of your total HDD size. If you would need more than 95% on you hard drive, you probably need to buy a larger one, instead of worrying about these 150GB that are out of your reach.\nAlso, please keep in your mind that in case of ext4 this space is not wasted. Data fragmentation is not a problem here, but the cost of this advantage is that extra occupied space. There are ways to decrease it and to force ext4 to use much less of this space, but that's not reccomended, as - because of fragmentation chances and other optimisations that won't be able to happen - this will very likely result in your machine working much slower, as data access won't be this smooth.\n\nA: Files on disk have two sizes: the  \"apparent size\" and the \"size on disk\". Several reasons can cause a large discrepancy:\n\n\n*\n\n*A large number of files will result in a large amount of overhead, because of internal fragmentation. E.g. Ext4 has a 4KiB default block size; files smaller than that will consume always 4KiB, and sizes above will be \"rounded\" to this block alignment.\n\n*Directories are also files and the same rule applies for them as well. Moreover, if you would create a large amount of files in a directory, and remove them again later, the usage on the directory file can't be reclaimed (recreating the directory helps).\n\n*Sparse files are special files, that appear to be large, but aren't 'consuming' the space. This is common in virtualization for virtual disk images; they will appear large, but the 'real' size can be a lot smaller. A lot of utilities (and file managers) are incapable of showing the actual disk usage.\n\n*The use of hard links. The contents of a file can exist on disk while multiple references are pointing to it. Some file managers may account the size for every reference.\n\n\nI would suggest to use a disk usage tool known to be capable of listing both sizes to see if this is the issue. Try ncdu in a terminal and use a to toggle between actual and disk usage.\n\nA short demo on internal fragmentation due to a 4KiB block size filesystem using du:\n$ sudo tune2fs -l /dev/path-to-device | grep \"Block size\"\nBlock size:               4096\n\n$ echo blaataaap > myfile                      # creates a 10-byte file\n\n$ du --block-size=1 myfile                     # prints the usage on disk (filesystem)\n4096   myfile\n\n$ du --apparent-size --block-size=1 myfile     # prints the apparent size, i.e.\n10     myfile                                  # content length when seeking\n\n$ ls -al\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 gert gert 10 Jan 1 23:24 myfile   # ls uses apparent sizes\n\nThis means that this 10-byte file is 4086 bytes bigger on disk than it would appear in a listing and is suffering from internal fragmentation.\n\nA short demo on hard links and disk usage shown wrong when listing files (ls in this case):\n$ dd if=/dev/zero of=1MBfile bs=1M count=1 # create a 1MB file\n$ ln 1MBfile a_hard_link                   # create a hard link to it\n\n$ ls -alht                                 # ls will report 2MB\ntotal 2.1M\ndrwxrwxr-x  2 gert gert 4.0K Jan  2 11:21 .\n-rw-rw-r--  2 gert gert 1.0M Jan  2 11:21 1MBfile\n-rw-rw-r--  2 gert gert 1.0M Jan  2 11:21 a_hard_link\n\n$ du -B 1024 .                             # du reports 1028K total for directory\n1028    .\n\n$ du -B 1024 a_hard_link                   # and 1024K for each file individually\n1024    a_hard_link\n$ du -B 1024 1MBfile\n1024    1MBfile\n\n", "Q: Can I input Chinese in my xterm?

And if so, how? Is there is a prepackaged version or pre-compiled package of Intel's Graphic Drivers?\nI have an Intel GMA 3150 graphics adapter. One option is compiling from source, from the http://intellinuxgraphics.com website, but I don't know how to compile.\n\nA: This driver is integrated in Ubuntu, as the whole package of drivers from the Intel Linux Graphics suite is. For the very latest builds of graphics drivers, you can try X.org edgers PPA (warning: experimental1).\nYou should not have to compile from source for any regular piece of hardware. If you boot up Ubuntu 12.10 on this hardware it works out of the box and you should not have to worry about drivers.\n1 \"Experimental\" when used in Ubuntu PPAs mean that the software is more or less in the \"Beta/testing\" phase. Therefore it's more likely to experience bugs, so you should not use them if you don't know how/don't want to take the time to fix you system if something goes wrong.\n\nA: Unless you are having issues with your graphics it is recommended that you use the default Ubuntu drivers, they have been extensively tested.  Intel graphic cards are open source so that they have the best default drivers as the developers know how the card works so can write the drivers to take full advantage of the cards.\nNvidia and other graphics cards are closed source so you have to use the company's drivers or the Linux ones that are usually not as good. This is because the Linux drivers that are written are made by reverse engineering the card.\nIntel on the other hand not only has open source drivers but help to write Linux the drivers, hence both Linux and Intel improve.\nThe short answer here is you already have Intel drivers installed but read on for more...\n\nThere are some exceptions, as I mentioned above if you are having problems with your current driver.\nThe other notable exception is if you want to use Steam for Linux it is recommended that you use the updated drivers. See this Wiki for more.\nTo install theses drivers you can use a Ubuntu PPA  type the following into a termnal\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nThe drivers that this will install will be the latest Intel drivers that are considered \"stable\"  but there is still the possibility that it will break something(mine is running fine with the x-swat updates but you never know)  Just FYI the x-swat team does the compiling for you so you only need to use their ppa to install these drivers(saves us average users a load of work, Thanks xswat team)\nYou can remove the x-swat ppa but is may unintall a but of other programs that will need to be reinstalled.  Remove with the following\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\nsudo ppa-purge ppa: ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\n\nMore info in managing ppas on webupd8.org\nPurging a ppa will uninstall the ppa and then reinstall the latest program(driver in this case) that is available in the official Ubuntu Repositories.\nHope this helps, your question is a duplicate of Compiling and installing Intel graphics card drivers but the answers there do not mention Steam or how to remove the x-swat ppa if you wish to revert to the default drivers so I posted this answer.  Good luck and welcome to the world of Linux/Ubuntu.\n", "Q: What is the correct way to use the \"scroll-event\" signal (on an indicator) for Qt? I am again at the same position, when I had the question What is the correct way to use g_signal_connect() in C++ for dynamic unity quicklists?\nThere I was informed that the signature for my static method was incorrect and that I had to add a guint argument in front of the others. Now I have the same problem but for the function called for the \"scroll-event\" signal that I want to make on to my indicator.\nMore specifically:\n//connecting indicator with the scroll-event and altogether with the function indicator_scrolled\ng_signal_connect(G_OBJECT(appindicator), \"scroll-event\", G_CALLBACK(&indicator_scrolled), (gpointer)this);\n\nThis is the function indicator_scrolled:\ngboolean indicator_scrolled(GtkStatusIcon  *status_icon, GdkEventScroll *event, gpointer data){\n    cout << \"The indicator was scrolled\\n\";\n    MainWindow* m = (MainWindow*)data;\n    m->action_on_scroll();\n}\n\nI can see the \"Indicator was scrolled\" message but then the program crashed. Adding a guint argument in front of the others didn't solved the problem.\nSo, what is the correct signature for this function so as to make it work? How can I find what is the correct signature each time so as to avoid this kind of questions? (At the other question user George Edison talked about valgrind but he did not clarify)\nPlease do not advice that AppIndicators are not the correct way to go with Ubuntu+Qt, please see question Make sniqt recognize all tray abilities (or create a working indicator in Qt)\nEdit: After tests I coincidentally found that a guint argument needs to be placed between the GtkStatusIcon and GdkEventScroll arguments. But I would really want to know a way to find out what is the correct function signature.\n\nA: Have a look at the reference manual: https://web.archive.org/web/20130604060558/http://developer.ubuntu.com/api/ubuntu-12.04/c/appindicator/libappindicator-app-indicator.html#AppIndicator-scroll-event\narg0 : The AppIndicator object\narg1 : How many steps the scroll wheel has taken\narg2 : (type Gdk.ScrollDirection) Which direction the wheel went in\nuser_data : user data set when the signal handler was connected.\n\n\nA: As of today, after some search-and-try, this is my working scroll-event callback:\nstatic void indicator_scrolled(AppIndicator *indicator, guint steps, GdkScrollDirection direction)\n{\n    if (direction == GDK_SCROLL_DOWN)\n        g_print(\"DOWN\\n\");\n    else if (direction == GDK_SCROLL_UP)\n        g_print(\"UP\\n\");\n    else if (direction == GDK_SCROLL_SMOOTH)\n       g_print(\"SMOOTH\\n\");\n}\n\nDuring a scroll I am receiving just one UP/DOWN, and then some SMOOTH (in the same direction).\nI have no idea on how to manage the smooth direction, as I should need the GdkEventScroll structure not seen anywhere; \nI am implementing a volume up/down on my app indicator and I will maintain a global direction flag so the following smooth will be applied on the current direction, but I think this is just a workaround on a messy and poor documented implementation which is libappindicator.\n", "Q: How to show mount icons on the desktop, in gnome classic?

I've just reported a paper cut in the current LTS release and was wondering if I will ever see the fix backported, or if I'm going to have to upgrade so get it.\n\nA: In almost all circumstances, a paper cut fix will not be backported. Only paper cuts with a high importance will be submitted, and even then it's not guaranteed to be approved.\nAll Stable Release Updates are approved with caution. Full details about what they are and how they work can be found here, but the passage of importance is this:\n\nStable release updates are automatically recommended to a very large\n  number of users, and so it is critically important to treat them with\n  great caution. Therefore, when updates are proposed, they must be\n  accompanied by a strong rationale and present a low risk of\n  regressions.\n\"It's just a one-line change!\" Even the simplest of changes can cause\n  unexpected regressions due to lurking problems:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*In bug 81125, the upgrade regression had nothing to do with the\n  content of the change that triggered it: any user who had installed\n  the libpthread20 package would encounter a problem the next time libc6\n  was upgraded. \n  \n*In bug 309674, the failure was a misbuild due to\n  timestamp skew in the build process. The underlying problem existed in\n  the source package in the original release, but would only manifest in\n  a small percentage of builds. \n  \n*In bug 559822, a C++ library\n  (wxwidgets2.8) was uploaded with no code changes. Due to an underlying\n  toolchain change/bug, this caused an ABI change, causing a lot of\n  unrelated packages to break (see bug 610975). \n  \n  \n  We never assume that any change, no matter how obvious, is completely free of regression risk.\n\nThe definition of a paper cut requires the problem to be minor, meaning the need to backport it will be low to non-existent. Only paper cuts with a high importance will be considered for SRU, and these will be few and far between.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 installed but won't boot, no other OS OS  Ubuntu 12.04 installed from USB\nComputer   Toshiba Satellite\nOld OS:  Vista\nHello,\nI installed ubuntu 12.04 from a usb.  during the installation I installed Ubuntu over windows so all windows was deleted.

The /var size is completely normal.\nI'm afraid of facing it again. I think my main problem is because of the partitions. The /home and /root are together and not separated. Do I have to create a new partition for /home? Anyone has another idea how to avoid the disk from filling up again?\n\nA: As you noticed yourself, your log folder is huge. You probably want to delete some old logs. Old logs are being archived periodically. If you look into your log folder by\ncd /var/log\nls -lh\n\nyou will see a lot of files ending in .gz. Those files are the archives logs. They have a number before that indicating how old the archive is. .1.gz is the newest. If you are sure you don't need the old logs any more, delete them:\nsudo rm *.gz\n\nBefore you do so you might want to check why your logs are that huge. Take a look which log files and corresponding archives are huge. If you find some look into them. What are the log entries? Are some of them very frequent? What process/program/event is responsible? Can you safely lower the log level for that?\nEDIT\nLook into the error_log. You should use tail for showing the last few lines and hope that it can process such a huge file. You could also delete that file to free up the space but we should find out why it is that big.\n", "Q: Versions newer than the ones in current Ubuntu - where to find them? For example, the OpenCV package (because I'm waiting for that to compile as I write that :) )\nUbuntu has an OpenCV 2.3.1 package while the latest is 2.4.3. Suppose I'd like to skip compiling from source which can take some time. So what I'm wondering is, is there any (well-known/reliable) third-party site that provides unofficial debs with newer software versions than what's available in the official Ubuntu repos? Cause if not, that just means I'm going to be having those annoying compile sessions more often than I like :)\n\nA: The main reason that you do not find the \"newer-bleeding-egde\" packages in the Ubuntu repositories is the stability issue. Those packages are use-at-your-own-risk and do not enter the Ubuntu Release Repository. Caution is always stated, or suggested when utilizing the newest untested packages. \n\nBefore its released (any package) it is tested for the main stream of users. This is how the distro maintains integrity. \nThis is also a how Alphas Betas and RC's come about. \nTesting. If you are willing to compile and test them it is suggested that you give some feedback as to what works and what doesn't. We ALL would like more development. \n\nIf you are looking for the most current/stable projects then GO HERE\nFor researching those projects GO HERE ---> favorite of mine \n\nA: I am not sure if I am telling you old news here, but generally you can often use a PPA to get newer versions of software than are available in the repositories. \nAccording to my search that approach will not be useful for OpenCV though (no newer versions in any PPA).\nPlease have a look at What are PPAs and how do I use them? for general information.\n", "Q: How to run a Perl command?

It is command line so you can use it on a server too.\n\nBackup all your emails on disk.\nUse the full sync mode to backup your entire gmail account in a unique directory. Your email backup repository can then be easily tarred and moved from one machine to the other.\nUpdate your backup in minutes.\nGmvault can run a quick sync mode regularly (ie. every day) to keep your backup up to date.\nRestore emails in any Gmail acc.\nWith the restore command Gmvault can recreate your gmail mailboxes in any Gmail account. All attributes such as Gmail labels are preserved and recreated. With restore, you will recover your Gmail account exactly as it was.\n\n\n\nLinux Installation\n\nOn Linux, it is recommended to install Gmvault using the source distribution or Pypi.\nsudo apt-get install python python-setuptools\nsudo easy_install -U distribute\nwget https://github.com/downloads/gaubert/gmvault/gmvault-v1.7-beta-src.tar.gz\ntar xvzf gmvault-1.7-beta-src.tar.gz\n\nPython is already installed so it will error out.\nThen install with ...\ncd gmvault-1.7-beta/\nsudo python setup.py install\n\nThe basic setup is about as simple as it comes:\ngmvault sync your_email@gmail.com\n\nSynching the last 2 months:\ngmvault sync --type quick your_email@gmail.com\n\nMore information on setting it up here.\n\nA: Rinzwind,\nI decided to go with gmvault. I already had python & python-setuptools packages installed. I don't remember previously installing them but I'm not sure as I upgraded from Lucid to Precise and it could have happened in my Lucid period. I found that I had to do 'sudo easy_install -U distribute' as 'sudo python setup.py install' didn't work properly without it. If I install another Python app, would I have to do that command again?\nThe above installation seems much simpler than the methods outlined in gmvault's website.\nThe gmvault website states that the -t option is 'to daily backup' & 'with the last 7 days of emails'. Your use of the --type option states that it's the last 2 months. Assuming that -t is equivalent to --type, I'm confused. Which is correct? Perhaps the quick parameter changes the time period?

I have a wireless button that's currently set on disabled, and when I try to enable it through the button, nothing happens! What do I need to do to enable my wireless network?\nFrom lspci | grep 802, I got nothing. From lspci, I got the following relevant output:\n08:00.0 Network controller: Atheros Communications Inc.

I had the same case with my 32 bit Pc, 3gb RAM and Ubuntu only recognized 2.98gb, again, it is a little direfence but I wish to know why that happens.\n\nA: It could be either that the system is using IEC Units instead of SI units, or that your Graphics card reserves space for its personal use.\nFor example I have 2 GB Ram installed, but only 1.7GB is usable because 256MB are dedicated to my Graphics Card.\n", "Q: Best way to configure poweroff keyboard shortcut What's the best/right way to configure GNOME/Unity so that hitting ALT + F4 will Power Off the system when no more windows are open?

On a fresh Ubuntu, you usually have these default (empty) folders:\n\n\n*\n\n*Downloads\n\n*Documents\n\n*Music\n\n*Videos\n\n*...\n\n\nall with special emblems.\nBUT, where are these Emblems coming from?, what's telling Nautilus to display these emblems?\nNow that Nautilus has dropped Emblems support, I am unable to inspect or change these emblems via GUI. Just being curious here...\nUpdate\nAs I posted as comment to Uri's answer: everyone here, is right: I was confusing emblems with folder-specific icons in this case. But: let me rephrase my question:\nWhy does, for example, Nautilus know that it has to apply a special icon for these directories? Is there some flag on the actual dir, a metadata field in GVFS or is this hard-coded into Nautilus?\n(running Ubuntu 12.04.1)\n\nA: Those are not emblems, in the image below you can see that the emblems are located in the lower right part of the Item (in this case is a symlink/shortcut).\nThe Icons for the user folders usually have a little representation of what that folder is all about. Those folders are \"special\" and are different from the rest of the folders on your system. In this example the folder is Shared/Public stuff, next to this is a regular folder.\nIcons are located in two locations:\n\n*\n\n*~/.icons\n\n*/usr/share/icons\n\nDepending on the the icon theme, they will placed in different categories (most are in /places).\nThis will help you understand it better:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the meaning of the default directories in the Linux filesystem hierachy?\n\n\n\n\nWhy does, for example, Nautilus know that it has to apply a special icon for these directories? Is there some flag on the actual dir, a metadata field in GVFS or is this hard-coded into Nautilus?\n\nIt's a standard set by the freedesktop organization called xdg-user-dirs.\nFrom the site:\n\nxdg-user-dirs is a tool to help manage \"well known\" user directories like the desktop folder and the music folder. It also handles localization (i.e. translation) of the filenames.\nThe way it works is that xdg-user-dirs-update is run very early in the login phase.\nThis program reads a configuration file, and a set of default directories. It then creates localized versions of these directories in the users home directory and sets up a config file in $(XDG_CONFIG_HOME)/user-dirs.dirs (XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to ~/.config) that applications can read to find these directories.\n\nYou can read more about the XDG Base Directory Specification here.\n\nA: The icons are determined by the desktop-theme you are using- you can find them under \n/usr/share/icons/<ThemeName>/places\nWith Humanity that would then be /usr/share/icons/Humanity/places\n\nA: At least in 13.04, they are emblems, and they can be changed.  Changing the icon gets rid of the folder, which for me wasn't what was desired.\nI only had a handful of folders I wanted to do this to, so I didn't feel I needed the gui tools. Also, none of them worked for me in 13.04 (which I realize isn't what you have).  The below did.\ngvfs-set-attribute -t stringv file_name metadata::emblems emblem_name default\n\nYou can find the possible short names and the images that are applied with them in /usr/share/icons/Humanity/emblems (if you are using the default icon theme, otherwise look in your custom icon theme.)\nFor example, I did:\ngvfs-set-attribute -t stringv ~/Sites metadata::emblems marketing art\n\n\nA: You can use the Emblemize script to edit and inspect emblems (works with 11.10 and 12.04)\nInstallation\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:dr3mro/nautilus-actions-extra\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nautilus-actions nautilus-actions-extra nautilus-gksu\n\nRe-start Nautilus...\nnautilus -q\n\nResult:\n\n", "Q: Recovery after installing ubuntu I know this question has been asked many times and even I have asked it once...But as today I came to know about fdisk so thought of posting it so that someone having good knowledge can help me better.\nHere is the log created by fdisk and I would like Ubuntu to show me sda3 and sda4 which its not showing right now and even my windows 7 is not booting up.I have all of my data in one of them and really need it.\nThanks\nDisk /dev/sda: 250.1 GB, 250059350016 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 30401 cylinders, total 488397168 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x3aa63aa5\n\nDevice Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1              63        2047         992+  42  SFS\n/dev/sda2   *        2048      206847      102400   42  SFS\n/dev/sda3          206848   176334847    88064000   42  SFS\n/dev/sda4       466913278   488396799    10741761    5  Extended\n/dev/sda5       486445056   488396799      975872   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n/dev/sda6       466913280   486445055     9765888   83  Linux\n\nPartition table entries are not in disk order\n\nDisk /dev/sdb: 8075 MB, 8075120640 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 981 cylinders, total 15771720 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x00000000\n\nDevice Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\ndev/sdb1   *        2048    15771647     7884800    b  W95 FAT32\n\n\nA: Well sda1, sda2 and sda3 are of SFS type.When Linux reports SFS for MS Windows machines, that generally means that the Windows machine HDD was formatted using Dynamic Volumes.\nPartition type 42 is a Windows specific dynamic partitioning type that Linux may not be fully aware of or feel safe modifying.\nThey are Pure dynamic disks (those not containing any hard-linked partitions) have only a single partition table entry (type 42) to define the entire disk.

Password is reported to be incorrect I just installed Lubuntu 12.10.

I go to the networking menu, and click on my wireless network. It then asks for the password to log into the network. I type it in, and tell it to log in, but then it says that the password is incorrect. It then asks me to type it in again, but that still fails. I am sure I am typing in the correct password for that network.\nIf I close the box, after I try to connect, it says that I have insufficient privileges to modify the wireless settings. I don't understand this, as I am the administrator of the system.\nThis is really bugging me, and I hope that there is a fix to this. Please help!\n\nA: Are you sure it is asking you for the password for the wireless network, and not your user password in order to access the keyring that contains the key for the network?  The first time you enter the password, it will normally save this paassword to the keyring, then it won't need to keep asking you every time.  I believe it uses your login password as the keyring password, but if these are different, then it will prompt you for the keyring password.  The default behavior always works well for me, but in the past, I've had problems with this when I didn't understand the behavior, but tried to do something non-standard anyway.\nThe next thing you should understand as soon as you can is that there is no such thing as \"administrator\" of the system, per se.  There is root authority, but you do not normally use this, ever.  Instead, Ubuntu has a way to temporarily give you elevated privileges, using sudo, or gksu.  Using your normal login, you should never have privileges to change the system.  But there is an easy way to do it, by using the built-in methods I mentioned.

I dont really want to use linux mint 14 cinnamon, but I love the interface. Is it a good idea to stick to Ubuntu and run cinnamon on it? Does it work 100% fine?\nAnother thing: is it a good idea to put cinnamon interface on top of Lubuntu? Is it still going to be a fast, reliable system?\nThanks a lot and sorry for the newbie question.\n\nA: You should be able to install Cinnamon just fine in Ubuntu.  You can install it with these commands.  \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gwendal-lebihan-dev/cinnamon-stable  \nsudo apt-get update  \nsudo apt-get install cinnamon  \n\nAfter installing you need to select it at the login screen to use it.  \n \nRunning Cinnamon on Lubuntu defeats the purpose of Lubuntu.  The LXDE desktop enviroment is what makes Lubuntu so fast.  Installing and using Cinnamon defeats that purpose as you would be using Cinnamon and not LXDE.  It will work, just not be as fast as LXDE. However from my experience Cinnamon is a pretty fast environment. \nRemoving Cinnamon\nTo remove Cinnamon, first purge the Cinnamon package. \nsudo apt-get purge cinnamon  \n\nThen see these instructions on removing a PPA.  \nResources: \nIs it possible to use multiple desktop environments on same system? \nRemoving PPAs \nHow do I install the Cinnamon Desktop?\n\nA: Lubuntu is Ubuntu with the LXDE desktop environment instead of GNOME/Unity.\nLubuntu also contains some different default programs, like AbiWord and Gnumeric instead of LibreOffice Writer and LibreOffice Calc, and Chromium instead of Firefox.\nWhatever flavor of Ubuntu you start out with (Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Lubuntu, Edubuntu, Ubuntu Studio, Mythbuntu), you can always install a different desktop environment to get the interfaces and applications associated with another one. So if you started with Ubuntu and installed lubuntu-desktop , you'd get the Lubuntu interface and applications installed, and could select Lubuntu Desktop as your session type on the login screen (while still being able to use Ubuntu's regular interface and apps).\nCinnamon and MATE are two other desktop environments, originating in Linux Mint but not specific to that OS. There's no special Ubuntu derivative based on them, but you can install them in Ubuntu. The following situations are therefore basically equivalent in terms of functionality and performance:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing Cinnamon (or MATE) on Ubuntu and selecting Cinnamon (or MATE) as your session type.\n\n*Installing Cinnamon (or MATE) on a combined Ubuntu/Lubuntu system (i.e., Ubuntu with lubuntu-desktop  installed or Lubuntu with ubuntu-desktop  installed) and selecting Cinnamon (or MATE) as your session type.\n\n*Installing Cinnamon (or MATE) on Lubuntu and selecting Cinnamon (or MATE) as your session type.\n\n\nWhatever interfaces you start with, Cinnamon (or MATE) will run the same way when selected (barring any bugs). It should perform the same on Lubuntu as Ubuntu--no better, no worse.\nIf you use different apps with it--for example, if you use Chromium on Cinnamon (or MATE) instead of Firefox--then of course those applications may perform or function differently.\nCinnamon and MATE will not perform or behave the same as each other of course; they are two separate desktop environments.\n\nA: I think lubuntu and Cinnamon would be faster than Ubuntu and Cinnamon. I tried just going with Linux Mint 14; but, their installer is not working well. Everything is laggy. I'll go with lubuntu+cinnemon for the time being. Feels like the same thing since Mint was sort of made as a less heavy, more robust more elegant version of Ubuntu. lol\n", "Q: Wine has dependency issues Okay, I like to use Aptitude for most of my program installation, due to its exceptional handling of dependencies (it's very diligent about removing unused libraries.)\nUnfortunately, it appears not to be able to install Wine.\nThe log is here.\nNow, I can usually get away with typing sudo apt-get install wine, and it will be fine, but the next time I run aptitude (I usually prefer it for programs that have many dependencies,) wine is removed.\nAnyway, I didn't manage to figure out what was wrong (I could make out that it has something to do with an unresolvable dependency,) but I was hoping that somebody else could figure it out.\n\nA: sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs\n\nArchitecture problem with 12.10 Quantal.

How can I achieve this?\n\nA: You can set up a separate anacron instance to run in user mode: \n\n\n*\n\n*Create a .anacron folder in your home directory and in it two subfolders, etc and spool:\nmkdir -p ~/.anacron/{etc,spool}\n\n\n*Create a new file ~/.anacron/etc/anacrontab with contents similar to the following:\n# /etc/anacrontab: configuration file for anacron\n\n# See anacron(8) and anacrontab(5) for details.\n\nSHELL=/bin/bash\nPATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin\n\n# period  delay  job-identifier  command\n1         10     testjob         test.sh\n\n\n*Add the following line to your crontab using crontab -e:\n@hourly /usr/sbin/anacron -s -t $HOME/.anacron/etc/anacrontab -S $HOME/.anacron/spool\n\n\nA: This worked for me (thanks), but I didn't use the last step given in the answer:\n\nThen add the following line to your ~/.profile:\n\nI'm using Ubuntu Studio 12.10 Quantal and in my case instead of that last step I put that one liner here:\n“Applications Menu” → “Settings” → “Settings Manager” then in the Settings Manager under “Session and Startup” then the “Application Autostart” tab.\nThis is for those of us that are GUI users, because ~/.profile is only sourced by bash when it starts a log-in interactive shell (even ~/bashrc is not so useful since that is only sourced when bash is starting an interactive shell).\n\nA: The anacrontab shown above has a problem: anacron looks for executables only in the directories specified in PATH. So it will not find test.sh.\nA better solution is to use the command run-parts:\n# /etc/anacrontab: configuration file for anacron\n\n# See anacron(8) and anacrontab(5) for details.\n\nSHELL=/bin/sh\nPATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin\n\n# period  delay  job-identifier  command\n1         10     dailyjob        run-parts ${HOME}/.anacron/daily/\n\nThis requires that we create the directory daily:\nmkdir -p ~/.anacron/{etc,spool,daily}\n\nrun-parts will not execute scripts with '.' in the name, such as \"test.sh\", so rename the script to, for example, \"my-test\".\nThere is yet another wrinkle: If the computer does not run 24/7, then one does not have control over at what time the daily script is run. I have a web scraping script that I want to be run at about 11 am, or later during the day. I fix this problem by scheduling the web scraping job in the \"at\" facility (sudo apt install at).\nSo I have a script daily/crawl which looks as follows:\n#!/bin/bash\n\npreferred_time=\"11:15\"\nscheduled_time=\"${preferred_time}\"\npreferred_time_as_number=\"${preferred_time/:/}\"\ncurrent_time_as_number=$(date +%H%M)\nif [ \"${current_time_as_number}\" -ge \"${preferred_time_as_number}\" ]; then\n    scheduled_time=\"NOW\"\nfi\nat -M -f \"${HOME}/bin/crawl-dagpris.sh\" \"${scheduled_time}\"\n\n", "Q: Make multiple files hidden?

I'm running out of room on my internal hdd (the 80Gb one), and so I decided I should move my system files to the external (the 60Gb one) and keep my /home on the internal, since it's the larger portion of all my files (50Gb out of ~75Gb).\nI know there are ways to move your /home to a separate partition, but I don't think I can move system files because they're configured specifically for my internal hdd and such, and moving them would essentially break my install.\nIs there a way to move my ubuntu installation to my external hdd, leaving my /home on my internal hdd?  Or is doing a fresh install the best/only method for achieving this?\nSystem Info:\n\n\n*\n\n*Xubuntu 12.10\n\n*80Gb Internal Hard Drive\n\n*60Gb External Hard Drive\n\n\nA: Well, if you want to, you can move your system to another hard drive - all you need to do is, as root, to copy all the root-level directories to the new location making sure you keep permissions. You should not copy /dev/, /proc and /sys because they're just mount-points for kernel filesystems, just create empty directories. Then you just re-install the bootloader. Ahh, and edit the /etc/fstab on the new partition. Easy-peasy if you have basic understanding of how the system works.\nHowever, the resulting system will be quite fragile I think - it'll only boot if your external drive is plugged in (and also subject to the machine being able to boot from an external USB hard drive at all)\nWhat I would do is to keep the system as it is, but off-load some directories from your home directory to the external drive. Say, if you have a lot of videos in your Videos folder, you can move them all to a folder on your external hard drive and then replace your original Videos folder with a symlink to the new location.\nThis way you'll be able to better utilize both hard drives and your machine won't be totally dependent on the external drive being plugged in.\nWhat I would also do is to throw away the HDD enclosure, open the computer case and attach the second HDD normally with an IDE/SATA cable - this is much more reliable than the whole external USB thing. Then you'll have two internal drives. If you go this route and you're feeling adventurous, you can experiment with setting up LVM, which would allow you to have a continuous 140Gb partition and do not worry about balancing your files between two drives.\n", "Q: Somehow I don't see a boot menu when trying to dual-boot with Windows 8.

I was just wondering, if I delete a file (which sends it to the trash bin) and then empty the trash bin, does that completely delete the file off the hard drive? If not, is there a good way to clean up the hard drive from time to time without erasing necessary programs?\n\nA: If my understanding is correct, when you empty the trash can all the files in it are completely deleted.\nIf you want to make sure that a file is deleted, you can delete files using the rm command, although this is dangerous, as you can easily break your system or delete many files if you accidentally mistype this command.\nIf you want more info on rm, look on its manpage.\n\nA: Yes.

USB bluetooth keyboard and mouse is possible through kernel bluetooth modules and the gnome applet.\n\n*Adobe Flash Player is not ported to Linux for ARM architechtures. But sites like Youtube and many others are slowly migrating to HTML5, so you could still watch most videos.\n\n*With a USB host cable Ubuntu will recognise devices like flash drives/SDcard readers, printers, webcams etc.\n\n*Battery life will be less than optimal as the whole project is steel deep into development. You can expect the device to run slower, be resource heavy (especially because of Unity) and as a result use a lot more energy. Results will vary.\n\n\nLook around on the wiki, check out the development process. Support may be minimal because the team is still working very hard on making it work.

While running Virtual Box my system is accessing the hard drive a lot and running slowly.\nWhen I checked system resources using System Monitor it shows processor usage at 15%, RAM usage at 65% and Swap usage at about 50%.\nMy question is why does ubuntu need to use Swap when there is sufficient amount of main memory available?\nEdit - \nOutput of free command - \n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:       4075908    3056931    1018977          0       1944     308408\n-/+ buffers/cache:    2746579    1329329\nSwap:      4139004    1862551    2276453\n\nNote - \nVirtual box seemed to work just fine before I upgraded my 12.04 Precise to 12.10 Quantal. Now its so slow its almost useless.\n\nA: But you don't have enough memory.  In the first column, the amount of total memory available is 4075908.  The amount of memory actually in use for programs excluding cache and buffers is 2746579.  The amount of RAM in swap is 1862551.\nThis means that the amount of memory actually in use is 2746579+1862551 which equals 4609130.  Generally, complete memory blocks and allocations to programs will be swapped out, these being the most efficient way of doing it.\nBottom line is, you have 4609130-4075908 or a 533222 Mb RAM requirement over what you physically have.\nHave a look at how much memory you are allocating to the virtual machines that you are running at the time, and what the RAM requirements of other programmes that you may be running.  Sometimes less is more - if you reduce the amount of RAM allocated to the virtual machines then you'll get no swapping, and performance will be much better.\n\nA: \nThe swappiness parameter controls the tendency of the kernel to move\n  processes out of physical memory and onto the swap disk. Because disks\n  are much slower than RAM, this can lead to slower response times for\n  system and applications if processes are too aggressively moved out of\n  memory.\nswappiness can have a value of between 0 and 100\nswappiness=0 tells the kernel to avoid swapping processes out of physical memory for as long as possible\nswappiness=100 tells the kernel to aggressively swap processes out of physical memory and move them to swap cache \n\nThe default setting in Ubuntu is swappiness=60. Reducing the default\n  value of swappiness will probably improve overall performance for a\n  typical Ubuntu desktop installation.\n\nSource: SwapFaq - Ubuntu Wiki\nOpen the terminal and paste this in before you start virtualbox:\n    sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=10\n\nStart the visualization and check whether the swap usage has decreased, if that's the case then in the terminal do the following command:\n    gksu gedit /etc/sysctl.conf\n\nIt will ask you for your password, type it in and a text editor will come up on the screen, scroll all the way down and after the last line add:\n    vm.swappiness=10\n\nSave the file and restart your computer.\nThat should do the trick!\n", "Q: Error while installing MatlabR2011b Error while installing MatlabR2011b in Ubuntu 12.04 64bit OS\nPreparing installation files ...\nInstalling ...\ninstall: 1: eval: /tmp/mathworks_9756/sys/java/jre/glnxa64/jre/bin/java: Permission denied\nFinished\n\n\nA: Here is the solution provided by MathWorks\nSource\n\nThis error occurs when the installer file (for example,\n  matlab_R2010b_glnxa64_installer.zip or\n  matlab_R2010b_glnx86_installer.zip) is not extracted properly.

Ubuntu Software Center crashes whenever I try to install something. It shows the following error:\n\nPrevious installation hasn't been completed.\nThe installation could have failed because of an error in the corresponding software package or it was cancelled in an unfriendly way. You have to repair this before you can install or remove any further software.\n\nHow do I fix this?\n\nA: Simply install anything through the terminal, such as ccsm Using sudo apt-get install ccsm. If it fails to install, check its output. It will tell you a recommended solution, or a command to run to fix it. At most times, the command is sudo dpkg --configure -a But it varies according to the problem.\n\nA: If you try\nsudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade\n\nyou should be able to see which package installation or configuration is causing the holdup.

I want to dual boot Ubuntu with Windows 8 Enterprise.\nI have a 160 GB Hard Disk Drive and completely wiped out all the existing partitions of this drive to create 3 new partitions in the following order:\n\n\n*\n\n*30 GB (for Ubuntu)\n\n*35 GB (for Windows)\n\n*84 GB (balance for other documents)\n\n\nNext, I installed Windows 8 on the 2nd partition of the drive; ie; the one with 35 GB.\nThen, I booted Ubuntu 12.10 off my USB Drive to install it on the 1st partition of the drive; ie; the one with 30 GB. When it asks for Installation Type, I select Something else and press Continue. \n\nThe following screen shows the partitions on my Hard Disk. However, I notice that Windows is also utilizing a bit of space in the first partition on which I want to install Ubuntu. And probably Windows Boot Manager files also reside in this partition. \n\nFollowing is the snapshot from Windows Disk Management.\n\nSo, my fear is that if I install Ubuntu on the 1st Partition, then I would lose the ability to Boot into Windows. Please help me with what are the options available for me and how I should go about installing Ubuntu in order to make Dual-boot a success.\n\n\n*\n\n*Will installing Ubuntu on this 1st Partition and then running bootrec /FixMbr from Windows Recovery Command Prompt fix the problem?\n\n*Or, shrinking this 1st Partition is the best solution? If so - what size should it be?\n\n*Or, something else all together.\n\n*Or, all my fears are baseless and I should just go on with the installation?\n\nA: You made a slight mistake that got you confused: you should have deleted the partitions and only format the 2 you installed Windows (35) and your documents (85) on. Then you would have seen a slightly different image for gparted (where it would state 'empty' for sda1).\nInstall Ubuntu on sda1 by deleting sda1 and formatting it to ext4 (or less preferred ext3) where you divide sda into 3 parts: / (something like ... 10 Gb), swap (2 Gb) and /home (18 Gb)). (you will thank me someday for suggesting a separate partition for /home ;) )\nSo to answer the question: Or, all my fears are baseless and I should just go on with the installation? is the correct one. But you might need to fix something in grub to get Windows back. The fixmbr will remove grub and therefor Ubuntu from the boot list.\n\nA: To answer this question\nThe best option was to shrink the 1st Partition to a size of anything more than 350 MB [Windows would use this partition as System Reserved and store other critical files which are related to its installation]. Then do a normal install of Ubuntu. Following this simple step would have made Dual-boot a success.\n\nNow coming to what I did and how I came to this solution\n\n*\n\n*I simply installed Ubuntu on that 30 GB partition. As such all the files which were stored by Windows on this partition got erased and I was left with no choice which would have allowed me to boot into Windows. \n\n*I was already prepared for this situation, so inserted Windows Installation DVD and booted from it. I went into the command-prompt and did bootrec /FixMbr and did a reboot. This removed Grub and as such I wasn't able to boot into Ubuntu (I knew that). However, this didn't fix the problem. I was staring at my screen which said that it didn't find any Operating System. So, bootrec didn't solve the problem. \n\n*I booted off Ubuntu's Live USB. Went online and found that bcdboot might help me solve the problem. However, running bcdboot c:\\windows /s c: didn't help my issue. As per Microsoft Technet:\n\nbcdboot: Enables you to quickly set up a system partition, or to repair the boot environment located on the system partition. The system partition is set up by copying a simple set of Boot Configuration Data (BCD) files to an existing empty partition.\n  \n*I again booted off Windows DVD; this time tried to Refresh the installation of Windows, but it said that \"The Drive where Windows is installed is locked. Unlock the drive and try again.\". \n  \n*Then tried to Reset the installation of Windows. This time it complained something about that I don't have a necessary partition. [This was so because all the available space was utilized in installation of Ubuntu. When we install Windows it tries to find unallocated space on disk to create a System Reserved partition of 350 MB. This was the problem when I first installed Windows before asking this question. I had allocated all the space on drive to different partitions. Hence, it used the 30 GB partition to store the files which it stores in a System Reserved Partition.]\n  \n*I understood the issue and completely deleted both 30 GB and 35 GB partitions. Recreated the 35 GB partition and left the rest of the space unallocated. Then, installed Windows and found that it had automatically created a System Reserved Partition of 350 MB out of the unallocated space. Then, installed Ubuntu normally and everything works like charm. [I could also have resized / partition of Ubuntu to create a 350 MB free space; then installed Windows; then do a boot-repair. This would have had the same effect.]\n  \n\n\nIn a Nutshell\nWe should leave some space (more than 350 MB) unallocated on our Hard Disk (preferably at the start) before installing Windows. Following this step should solve all the problem.\n", "Q: All Browsers Crashing on Ubuntu 12.04 This is a fresh install of Ubuntu 12.04, all browsers crash, especially when using Google Mail or Google Drive / Docs.

I'm unable to run in terminal since it is not installed from Ubuntu Software Center because it is five versions lagging in the repo.\nHowever, I tried to drag the executable blender file to the terminal, Blender opened but without the console.\n\nA: First things first, the Blender Console on Linux is a bit different than you might expect.\nUnlike on Windows, Blender's console output is placed on the command line, if run from a terminal. Also, Blender on all versions contains a built in console.\n\nYou can choose either a Python console or a regular console (bash), though some builds do not have this (for example the one I'm using does not).\nSecondly, you can get Blender from a PPA. The builds are from svn and are built usually every week. The PPA also contains Blender 2.4x for backwards compatibility.\nFor 2.6x:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:irie/blender\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install blender\n\nFor 2.4:\nsudo apt-get install blender 2.4\n\n\nA: The easiest way is to:\nopen terminal then type cd \"your blender path\"\nexample: cd /home/daniel/Desktop/DevAPPS/blender-2.79\nthen launch the blender in terminal, type in terminal: ./blender\nthen its all done.\n\nA: I return to this problem on a regular basis, and I usually find this answer when I am searching for the solution, so I figured I should add it here:\nAnother step that was missed, once you have installed Blender, is to go to the /usr/share/applications folder and open the blender* desktop file in a text editor, as root user (if it is updating from the PPA, it will append the svn version number to the application name).\nI use the terminal to open gedit using: gksu gedit, but you could also use the key command Alt+F2, and enter the same command.\nChange the preference Terminal=False to read Terminal=True, then save, and start blender, which should now open from a console/terminal window. The console will remain open, so long as blender is running (but blender will shut down if you exit the console).\nThis fix may only be necessary for 12.04, and does not apply to earlier versions which use the Alacarte menu system, which will allow you to add this preference with a radio button.\n\nA: Edit your launcher\nOpen up your blender.desktop file in ~/.local/share/applications or /usr/share/applications/blender.desktop with a Text Editor of your choice (Sublime, Gedit etc.):\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Blender\nExec=/opt/blender-2.77a/blender %F\nIcon=/opt/blender-2.77a/icons/scalable/apps/blender.svg\nMimeType=application/x-blender\nStartupNotify=true\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\n\nand set the 'Terminal flag' to true:\n...\nTerminal=true\n...\n\nThis will run Blender with the Terminal window:\n\nNote: To create a 'launcher' for Blender before, see this answer.\n\nA: @ Alaa, is correct, but i could not open the blender* icon in text editor so i just fallowed these steps\n\n\n*\n\n*from terminal run gksu gedit\n\n*It asks for password, enter it. it opens gedit\n\n*open home folder and navigate to /usr/share/applications\n\n*select the Blender* icon; drag it into into gedit window\n\n*Change the preference Terminal=False to read Terminal=True\n\n*save and close it\n\n*run blender and the blender terminal too opens :)\n\n\n@ Alaa solution in more step by step manner.\n", "Q: Google Chrome is installed but Ubuntu Software Centre says it's not Ubuntu 12.04.\nWhen I was on Ubuntu 11.10 and 11.04, Google Chrome was available to download from the Software Centre.

Since then, I've been looking for some way to make the HDMI work, as the proprietary drivers do not work with the new Xorg.\nRecently, I came across this post from 2007. Am I missing something? Is it possible to make the HDMI sound port work with the open source ATI driver?

On this site I see hundreds if not a thousand questions being asked about issues with a Wireless LAN adapter not being detected/recognized by Ubuntu. Some mainstream adapters appear to be utterly broken in Linux support, while others just require some simple steps to get it to work.\nThe options to get it to work appear to be infinitely huge and I have no clue where to get started!\nWhat is considered 'best practice'? What order of things to try is most efficient in terms of time, effort and imposes minimal risk to my Ubuntu installation? Please help me save time and guide me what to do, step by step.\n\nA: This answer covers completely non-functional wireless LAN only. It is not about stability/performance issues, or half-working cases. However, some steps may be helpful in case you're running into them and looking for other options.\nPreparation\nIn this answer I'm assuming you're familiar with at least the following tasks: running commands in a terminal and installing regular Ubuntu software packages. If you're not familiar with these basic steps, start reading this and this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Get the machine connected to the internet. This makes performing the the steps a lot easier and to use the clipboard for the actions.\nIf another network card is working, this should be easy. If your only card is failing at this point, find alternatives to this and be creative, e.g. using an USB wired network adapter or an alternative working WiFi adapter borrowed from a friend or neighbour.\n\n*Make sure you have installed the following packages: lshw, rfkill.\n\n*Update your system. By installing all latest (regular) system updates, bug fixes already released by developers after the release should be on your PC by doing so. Don't forget to reboot your system afterwards. See also How do I update Ubuntu?\nAfter applying all updates, reboot. It may already work in this stage. If not, just continue.\nIs it really a driver issue?\nFirst of all, one should determine whether the card isn't recognized and/or if it's a radio kill switch preventing it from working. Follow all steps below, as your problem may be two- or three-fold:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run sudo lshw -C network in a terminal.\nYou might need to install lshw first.\n\n\n*\n\n*In case multiple devices are listed, locate the device concerned.\n\n*In case it's listed as *-network UNCLAIMED, you should follow the steps in Installing (newer) drivers.\n\n*In case it's listed as *-network (without 'Unclaimed'), the output below about the driver could be relevant in further steps, e.g. configuration: broadcast=yes driver=iwlwifi\n\n*In case your device isn't listed at all, try the additional steps in Identifying the exact hardware.\n\n\n*Run rfkill list in a terminal. This lists the state of radio killswitches. Sample output:\n1: phy0: Wireless LAN\n        Soft blocked: no\n        Hard blocked: no\n\n\n\n*\n\n*In case you see yes on Hard blocked: refer to your notebook manual for a hardware switch for Wireless LAN.\n\n*In case you see yes on Soft blocked: hotkeys on your notebook may help activating it, as well as hitting \"Enable Wireless\" in the Network Manager applet. If that fails to remove the soft block, run sudo rfkill unblock all.\n\n*In case you don't see any kill switches listed: this might not apply for your device. Usually only mobile PCs are equipped with killswitches.\n\n\n*Only for USB devices: exclude USB-level issues.\n\n\n*\n\n*Preferably, try one directly attached to your mainbord, avoiding hubs or your computer case's connectors.\n\n*Try using another type of USB port (e.g. USB2.0 instead of USB3.0 port).\n\n*Go to Identifying the exact hardware and see if you can see some error messages when you plug in your device.\n\n*Try another cable (if any) you've verified is working.\n\n\n\nInstalling (newer) drivers\nThese are some obvious, sane and harmless steps to take, avoiding the ones listed in Things to avoid if possible.\n\n\n*\n\n*Try to see if Ubuntu suggests to install additional drivers. Refer to How do I install additional drivers? for more information on how to do do this.\n\n*Install additional firmware as this may be required for your hardware.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you have enabled multiverse as posted in How do I enable the \"multiverse\" repository?\n\n*Install both linux-firmware and linux-firmware-nonfree packages, e.g. sudo apt-get install linux-firmware linux-firmware-nonfree and reboot.\n\n\n*Try backported kernel modules (drivers) from the compat-wireless package. Ubuntu provides packages of compat-wireless of more recent Linux kernel releases for the kernel with the stable distribution (available since 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot).\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the latest ones available by searching with your favourite package management tool. At the time of writing, this was linux-backports-modules-cw-3.6-quantal-generic for Quantal. In the near future, a 3.7 package may be out.\n\n*Install it, e.g. sudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-cw-3.6-quantal-generic for Quantal, or sudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-cw-3.6-precise-generic for Precise. Then reboot.\n\n\nIn case you're running an LTS release (e.g. Precise or Lucid), backported kernels of all next releases are provided as a package. At the time of writing Quantal is the latest release after Precise and the package is linux-image-generic-lts-quantal and boot into your new kernel.\n\n*From here on, you should consider trying out a more recent release of Ubuntu to see if it has gained support for your hardware, just by booting from a Live CD/USB. Also consider trying the latest Beta/RC of Ubuntu+1. If it does work, the easiest approach is to simply wait for the new release.\n\n*Some hardware is just utterly broken on default installs, usually because the vendor isn't releasing (all) source code or does not allow redistribution of all required modules via Ubuntu. See the Hardware requiring special care section at the bottom to see if your device (chipset) is listed.\n\n*Try the latest stable Linux kernel. This is a less harmless approach and may break other stuff. This should not be necessary as the more recent wireless drivers are provided by the compat-wireless package in the earlier option. However, it may just a bit newer and therefore include a bugfix helping you out.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the kernel.ubuntu.com downloads section and identify the latest stable release (e.g. v3.7.1-raring at the time of writing).\n\n*Download all the .deb files for your architecture (e.g. amd64 or i386), plus the ones with all in the name.\n\n*Install them all at once by issuing e.g.:\ncd Downloads\nsudo dpkg -i linux-headers-3.7.1-030701-generic_3.7.1-12345678_amd64.deb linux-image... # include all\n\n\n*and finally, reboot into your new kernel.\n\n*if the new kernel doesn't work for you or introduces other issues, boot your system using the older kernel (e.g. hold Shift during the early boot stage to select it in the Grub menu) and then remove the packages using your package management e.g. sudo apt-get remove linux-\\*3.7.1\\*.\n\n\n\nIdentifying the exact hardware\nThe product you have was probably sold using a retail name completely irrelevant to you issue. Most vendors just use chipsets from manufacturers like Broadcom, Atheros, Ralink or Intel while the product itself may not carry this name. One example of this: a ThinkPad 11a/b/g/n Wireless LAN Mini Express Adapter may in fact just be a Atheros AR5418. The Thinkpad rebrand does usually not affect the hardware support in Linux, but the used chipset does. Therefore, it's of great importance to identify the chipset.\n\n\n*\n\n*PCI and integrated devices (e.g. mobile PCs):\nlspci -nn | grep -i network\n\n\n*USB devices:\nlsusb\n\nIn case you have trouble identifying it from this list:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unplug the device.\n\n*Open a terminal and run sudo tail -n 0 -f /var/log/syslog\n\n*Re-plug the device in and give the kernel/device a few seconds to initialize.\n\n*Stop the command by pressing Ctrl+C. The output should help identifying it from the list.\n\n*Check for output mentioning unable to enumerate USB device. If such output is present, your device is already failing on communication on USB-level. You're hitting a hardware issue probably: check for broken cables/connectors, power issues, broken hubs, other broken hardware. Don't bother dealing with drivers at this point - fix USB communication first.\n\n\n\nIn case your hardware isn't listed, this may be unrelated to your adapter, but a general PCI/USB bus error. This is considered outside the scope of a WiFi issue. Note that some notebooks have integrated WiFi adapters connected to an internal USB port, so it may be listed as USB in such a case.\nExample output:\n$ lsusb\nBus 001 Device 002: ID 8087:0024 Intel Corp. ...\n                            ^^^^-- product ID\n                       ^^^^------- vendor ID\n\n$ lspci -nn | grep -i network\n04:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Intel Corporation [...] [8086:4238] (rev 3e)\n                                                vendor ID --^^^^\n                                               product ID -------^^^^\n\nTips in using Google\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the numeric product/vendor IDs as identified by the commands issued.\n\n*Use linux as a keyword with it, rather than Ubuntu.\n\n*Try using the device's chipset name as listed in the output in the steps of Identifying the exact hardware. Examples: AR9285, BCM4311, Intel+6300.\n\n*Avoid using keywords unrelated to hardware support. E.g. your desktop environment is unrelated, so use Ubuntu instead of Lubuntu.\n\n*Try to be sensitive for 'general' information about your device, rather than focusing on specific solutions, e.g. \"Firmware is needed for this device\", or reports of users that it worked out-of-the-box in a previous release.\n\n\nI had no luck with all options. What should I provide in a new question?\nBefore posting a new question, search this site using keywords from Identifying the exact hardware.\n\n\n*\n\n*All relevant (unexpected or errors) output from the options in this answer.\n\n*Relevant output of the steps done in the Identifying the exact hardware section.\n\n*The kernel you're running and the versions you've tried. Use the uname -r command to identify your kernel version.\n\n*Other Ubuntu versions you've tried.\n\n\nThings to avoid if possible\n\n\n*\n\n*Compiling from source (e.g. running make, sudo make install).\n\n\n*\n\n*This may overwrite system files and confuse your package management. Installing this way may work, but can break anytime later if the package management updates overwrite the files again.\n\n*It may lead to unexpected errors which may be hard to solve for a novice user.\n\n*It's hard to undo all the changes done by sudo make install in case you want to revert your actions.\n\n\n*Ndiswrapper approaches.\n\n\n*\n\n*This 'wrapper' around Windows drivers should be tried as a last resort only, as it's very inefficient to emulate a Windows environment on Linux for hardware drivers.\n\n*Stability and performance are usually reported as low.\n\n\n\nHardware requiring special care\n\n\n*\n\n*Broadcom BCM43xx devices.

Open the \"Software & Updates\" application, go to the \"Additional Drivers\" tab, and if there are any drivers listed for your wireless adapter there, enable them and hit apply changes. If they were the right drivers, then your wifi will immediately start working.\n\nA: In my case, I had an old laptop on which I installed Lubuntu 19. The correct wifi drivers were already installed. I could see all wifi networks, but could not connect to them. Connecting through the internet via cable worked just fine.\nAfter unsuccessfully trying to resolve the issue in many different ways, I found out that some (L?)ubuntu 19 users are having the same problems, and recommended to install Lubuntu 16, and so I did.

This program produces output for every mount point in your system. At the end of every line in the output, the mount flags are listed in parentheses. Check if your mount point has noexec flag set.\nIf so, you can change it with the following command (for example assuming your drive is mounted in /mnt/cdrom):\nsudo mount -o remount,exec /mnt/cdrom\n\nIf your mounted drive is a Windows partition (i.e. a partition formatted with NTFS filesystem), then you can mount it executable as described in this post.\n\nA: You can use the Linux linker to run any file regardless of executable permissions and without changing the mount options like so:\n/lib/ld-linux.so.2 /path/to/binary-file\nor, on 64 bit systems:\n/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 /path/to/binary-file\n\nA: My solution is remount it to another path:\n$ sudo umount /dev/sdf\n$ sudo mount -o exec,defaults,-default_permissions /dev/sdf ~/usbdrive\n\nList all mounted drive:\n$ cat /proc/mounts\n\n", "Q: How to change owner and permissions of a folder in desktop The problem is that the folder directory is /home/marek/Desktop/Tekkitserver/3.1.1 and root has all but 5 file ownership and permissions what are inside it.\nIt all happened after I launched tekkit server .bat file trough terminal and when I opened folder with \"home folder\" I saw that freshly created files are in total root access.\nAnd none of the sudo nautilus commands worked, because the folder was unreachable for nautilus.\nI was able to see no child folder even whit Ctrl+H and I have troubles with chown.

I am running Kubuntu 12.10 64bit. I am trying to get a bash script to execute when I am disconnected from the network. I created a file in the folder /etc/network/if-down.d/ called test which has a single line:\nzenity --info --text=\"network down!\"\nI can execute this script without any issues; typing /etc/network/if-down.d/test into my terminal causes a message box to pop up saying \"network down!\". When I disconnect from my wifi network via the network manager, nothing happens. Unplugging my wifi usb dongle does not cause the message box to appear either. My only guess is that for what ever reason scripts in /etc/network/if-down.d/ are not being executed. Adding #!/bin/bash as the first line didn't work either.\n\nEDIT: 2013-01-02\nI had some issues using gertvdijk's answer (old edits and comments getting mixed up) which are now sorted out. Running zenity with su and DISPLAY=:0 solved my problem.\n\nA: If you're using Network Manager (opposed to the command-line /etc/network/interfaces file), you should use the Network Manager dispatcher scripts instead.\nSimply place your script in the /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/ directory, similar to the if-down.d approach. Scripting with Network Manager dispatcher scripts is rather easy and I suggest to read this (basic) example based as posted on the Arch Wiki:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nINTERFACE=$1  # The interface which is brought up or down\nSTATUS=$2     # The new state of the interface\nUSERNAME=gert # ENTER YOUR USERNAME HERE\n\ncase \"$STATUS\" in\n    'up') # $INTERFACE is up\n    # you could do something here...\n    ;;\n    'down') # $INTERFACE is down\n    # Check for other active interfaces and only act on all down\n    if [ ! `nm-tool|grep State|cut -f2 -d' '` = \"connected\" ]; then\n        /bin/su -l ${USERNAME} -c 'DISPLAY=:0 /usr/bin/zenity --info --text=\"all network interfaces down\"'\n    fi\n    ;;\nesac\n\nFor acting on a specific network, see this answer.\nAnd make sure to restart Network Manager to pick up with this new script.\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\n\nA: I tried this out (on 10.04) and have the same issue. It looks like the script does not know which display to display the dialog on.\nTry replacing your line by:\nDISPLAY=0:0 zenity --info --text=\"network down!\"\n\n(If you have several displays, you may need something more subtle.)\n\nA: The other answers are great - probably even better than this one, but, as usual, there's another way to do it - this time without needing system utilities or elevated permissions (sudo).\nMy system runs kubuntu 12.04, so this code will probably work on your system. It should also work on gnome 2.x as well except that the autostart script goes in a different place.\nI had a similar issue where I wanted to know when my computer went offline (because my notebook seems to do this occasionally by disabling wifi by itself and I often didn't notice the little red x in the taskbar.)\nWhat I did was to add a small (executable) script to the ~/.kde/Autostart directory which runs my main script every time KDE starts (this takes care of it having a display and keyboard to use):\n#!/bin/bash\nif [ -x \"$HOME/bin/offline_alert\" ] ; then\n  offline_alert & \nfi\n\nThe main script, offline_alert, tests to see if I'm offline using ping with a few retries to avoid false alarms and then generates a pop-up using yad (same as zenity, only way enhanced!) and plays a sound. In between testing for changes in online status, it sleeps so it doesn't use too many resources.\nIf you run it manually from the command line, etc., it checks to see if it is already running and gives you the option to end it.\nThe code that tests for offline is in the \"offline\" function, so it can easily be modified without affecting the rest of the script.\nThe images, icons, and sound it uses are hard coded, so you'd have to substitute your own. I found a cool wifi offline icon on the web.\nIt creates a log file which you may or may not want.\nThe script is setup to use notifications, but the code is commented out because the notifications went away too quickly and seemed more of a nuisance than a help.\nThis is just another way to do it and maybe someone will find the code useful.\nJoe\n", "Q: What is Ubuntu Touch (Ubuntu for Phones) Following up on Canonical's announcement, what is Ubuntu for phones, where can I download a copy of the OS to run on my phone? And how do I know if it's compatible with my phone?\n\nA: Ubuntu Touch / Ubuntu for Phones as the name implies, is the Ubuntu version for Mobiles (Smartphones & Tablets). This is still in DEVELOPMENT and any mobile phone right now would be a DEVELOPMENT PREVIEW, which means an unfinished, for test only product.\n(Check at the bottom of this answer for updates)\nRight now is too early to tell how Ubuntu Touch will work, will be sold, how the software will be integrated, how to get the software and work on it/with it or even be compatible with an Ubuntu Desktop.\nThe link you provided about Ubuntu for Phone is just a presentation of a new product, same as Ubuntu for Android and Ubuntu TV, they are being worked on for a future version but at least they have being announced so end users and developers know where Ubuntu is going.\nWe can see right now for example:\nLooks, Design, Features and Requirements\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Touch Status Page (For all Supported Devices)\n\n*How it will look and feel\n\n*Ubuntu for Phones Hardware Requirements\n\n*Ubuntu Table Hardware Requirements\nInformation for Developers\n\n\n*\n\n*How friendly it will be to develop in it\n\n*How to develop in it\n\n*Ubuntu Tablet Information\n\n*Ubuntu Table Development \n\n*Ubuntu User Interface Toolkit (SDK)\n\n*PPA To Download the SDK/QT5 (Supports 12.04+)\n\n*Where to Submit your Apps\n\n*Email Contact for Developers: gomobile@ubuntu.com\nNews About Ubuntu for Phones\n\n\n*\n\n*Testing Ubuntu Touch Images\n\n*Mark Shuttleworth on Ubuntu on Phones and Android\n\n*Video in Phoronix about Mark Shuttleworth talking about Ubuntu on Smartphones\n\n*Direct Youtube (Larger) video of Ubuntu for Phones\n\n*\"Prediction\" by CNN that Ubuntu will \"Fail\" - I added this part to make a personal statement about it, first as one of the comments found there shows:\nFunny thing that there are several windows 8 phone videos on YouTube with 50k - 500k views and they are some 2 - 11 months old. Ubuntu-phone video has almost 1M views after two (2) days...\nIf you look at most Windows 8 videos and then look at that one (1) video of the Ubuntu for Phone ad you will see that it is true. It is important to know that Ubuntu for Phone is not just a normal smartphone and there is no 10 users that will end up buying one. It will have several smart ways of connecting it to a PC or TV. It can actually be used as a PC and it will have many features that will work out of the box with any Ubuntu computer (And also with Windows) integrating itself with Unity, the HUD and other Ubuntu features. This are just to name a few since there are many surprises to be seen from here until we see 13.04, 13.10 and 14.04.\nThe planned design style, I for one finding it awesome, it is very well made taking ideas from Unity itself while thinking on how to be more friendly to the user on phones. The hardware that is optimized is very good and I know that I will not be the only one saving up for one of this when it comes out. All of this is just my personal thoughts about it but wanted to leave some information noted from day one. If you have seen the video, you will have noticed all the information Mark Shuttleworth mentions and how well thought out the Ubuntu idea for phone is.\n\nIn WebUpd8 we can see a quoted message about Ubuntu phones not ready for purchase but they are starting to work with partners to start selling them before the end of 2013. So at least until the end of 2013 when Ubuntu Smartphones start to sell, there will be little information about this.\nAlso remember that Ubuntu for Phones, TVs and Tablets is a milestone set between 13.10 and 14.10 when Unity's integration on all types of hardware will be complete or near completion (Less bugs, better hardware support, better ARM support, etc..).\nWill my Android Phone work with Ubuntu for Phone? Will it be an alternative?\nUbuntu for Phone will be another OS alternative to Phones, specially Smart Phones, that works with any phones that carry Android and have the minimum hardware requirements posted above. Phones like Samsung, HTC, Sony, LG and others that offer Android will be able to install Ubuntu for Phone on them. Of course, this will not be an App for Android, instead it will replace Android on that phone. So not only will new phones come with Ubuntu pre-installed, but it will also work on already existing Android phones\nUPDATE 6 Feb 2013 - In Slashdot we can see an article about Ubuntu Smartphones shipping in October which points to a wsj article about Ubuntu Smartphones, including a link to Ubuntu Smartphone Designs. Pretty neat and open way of providing users with the ideas behind the design. This will truly turn into something big once users know they can be part of it's design. Another link is the OMGUbuntu post about Ubuntu Phones\nUPDATE 18 Feb 2013 - In The H, we can see an article about Developer Preview for Ubuntu Phones which mentions an article in the Canonical Website that mentions the releases of the Developer Preview for Ubuntu Phones on the 21 Feb 2013.\nUPDATE 19 Feb 2013 - Ubuntu has released the first Ubuntu Tour for Tablets. You can see the website at http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/tablet\nYou can also see the video here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h384z7Ph0gU\nUPDATE 21 Feb 2013 - The Ubuntu Phone, Tablet Developer Preview has been released\nUPDATE 22 Feb 2013 - The Ubuntu Phone Porting Guide was unveiled\nYou can also visit the official Touch site\n\nA: Late february 2013:\nUbuntu Phone Download\n\nA: There is already a 'working' build for the Samsung Galaxy Nexus (? i9250) smartphone.\nBBC News > Technology > Ubuntu operating system comes to Android smartphones\n\nThe code will initially be released as a file which can be installed on Samsung's Galaxy Nexus phone, replacing Android.\n\nThere was a recent media presentation in London, and engadget.com got to play with one ..\nengadget > Canonical announces Ubuntu for smartphones, we go hands-on (video)\n\nThis is no ordinary Galaxy Nexus. Instead of Android, it's running a very different Linux-based OS -- the long-awaited mobile version of Ubuntu -- which comes with a new UI adapted for smaller screens. We've played with the phone briefly and we'll have a proper hands-on video for you shortly, but in the meantime there are a few salient features to report. ..\n\nUPDATE: 26-Feb-2013\nengadget > Ubuntu Touch Developer Preview now available for supported Nexus devices\n\nCanonical's preview of a smartphone- and tablet-friendly flavor of Ubuntu has finally arrived for folks willing to flash a Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 4 or a Nexus tablet. Shuttleworth and friends stress that the release is intended for developers and enthusiasts ..\n\n\nAnd, along come the nay-sayers ..\nnetworkworld.com > Ubuntu Smartphones No, Ubuntu Tablets, Yes\n\nDespite all of the giddiness though, I have not seen any phone makers step up and say they will produce and sell an Ubuntu phone. I think other than one or two strictly for the curiosity factor, we probably won't see a headlong rush to manufacture Ubuntu phones either. We might see a CyanogenMod type of group develop an Ubuntu that can be installed on rooted versions of Android phones or maybe WebOS/Palm phones, heck maybe even a Windows phone. But, by and large, Ubuntu is not going to challenge Microsoft or even BlackBerry for smartphone market share, let alone Apple or Android.\n\n\nA: Ubuntu for Phones is a mobile version of the Ubuntu operating system.\nThe link you referred to in your question is all the information we know about the OS at the moment.  However, if you are interested in this as a developer, see the developer page.\nThe OS is not publicly available, nor is there an available device running it.  All that has happened is that the product has been announced and the SDK released.\n", "Q: how to setup my isp provided static ip \n*\n\n*I purchased a static IP address from my ISP\n\n*I am running ubuntu server 12.04 x64 with webmin installed\n\n*I want to point a purchased domain name (and also a free .tk domain) at my server. \n\n\nEvery time I type the name of my free .tk name, I get the login page for my router. If it is my settings in bind can someone tell me the correct way to setup bind?\nIf it needs to be set in ubuntu can someone help configure it correctly?\n\nA: Your question is a bit complicated in wording, so out of all the things we could advice, I need to pick one that matches what I think is your question. Basically I understand you want this:\n\nyou type your .tk domain and get directed to the site you have running on a webserver somewhere in your home.\n\nand you currently have this\n\nyou type your .tk domain and get your router's login page\n\nIs that rigth?\nIf that is so, the only thing you need to do is let your router know that traffic comming from outside for your webserver actually be redirected to the right webserver. This means you have to forward a port. \nThe thing is, your ROUTER has the static IP from your provider. You have a different internal IP for your webserver because you are behind that router. If you forward port 80 (for default http traffic) and possible another port for https (e.g. 443) to that internal IP, you'll be set.\nNow it IS possible to do it differently, but I don't recommend this if guessing your experience\n\n\n*\n\n*set your server in the so called DMZ\n\n*give your server the public 'external' IP, and route from there to your netwerk (this is weird)\n\n*possibly loads of other options.\n\n\nA: This seems to be a fairly typical routing issue that people run into. When you're inside a NAT network, the router won't send your traffic through the port forwarding routing table. That is to say, if you request the public IP, you'll see the router, not the forwarded server.\nIf it's any consolation, it sounds like your DNS is fine.\nThere are at least two solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have an internal DNS server that points to the private IP of the server (eg 192.168.0.56), either running on an internal DNS server, or just munged into each client's /etc/hosts file.\n\n*Fix the routing table on the router. Most Home/SMB routers won't allow you to do this and it's so variable when it is possible that I've no idea what to advise.\nThere are actually a few dozen \"routing options\" but unless you're at the end of a network engineering degree, I wouldn't bother with them. The easiest route is just to play with /etc/hosts on the computer where you want to access the server from and hack it together, but this isn't optimal if you have a fleet of internal client machines.\n\nA: Seems that you just need to do the following...\n1. Adjust the default port for the router's config pages.\n2. Forward port 80 to the statically assigned IP address of your web server.\n3. Ensure that your ISP isn't blocking port 80 (many do, try www.canyouseeme.org)\n\nA: You need to setup port forwarding on the http port (tcp port 80) to whatever private IP is assigned to your webserver.\nThe manual for your router/gateway combo is located here:\nhttp://www.arrisi.com/support/documentation/user_guides/_docs/WTM652_User_Guide_Std1-1.pdf\nIn the manual they don't refer to it as port forwarding, rather as virtual servers on page 44.  There is a section about adding a well known service there which should apply to http.\nAlso, ensure that your ISP isn't blocking port 80 (I assume they aren't since you purchased a static IP and thus most likely have business class internet).\n", "Q: Ubuntu12.10 \"Disks\" Pendrive 64GB format LUKS+ext4 I just bought Pendrive / Flshdrive 64GB and need to archive on it file bigger than 10GB so i believe FAT32 is not an good option since it can handle only 4GB file in size. Next thing is that i though about formatting it with ext2 to avoid overwriting with journaling but when i open Disks application to format pendrive i have only option of Fat32 / Ext4 and LUKS + Ext4, and that is another thing, i need some sort of protection so how safe it will be to use ext4 + luks,\n1.How does it works is the encryption AES 256?\n2.It will ask me the password any time i need access the files on pendrive?\n3.Why it take space on my pendrive in the lost+found folder i make test on old 2GB flashdrive ext4 + luks and it \"eat\" about 130mb?\n4.What will happen if insert to anther linux computer?\n5.What if i put it into windows with ext drivers installed, will it works asking for password?\n6.Will ext4 + luks not overuse \"wear\" my pendrive too fast?\n7.Isn't FAT32 support drive up to 32GB only? then why it let me format 64GB flashdrive?\n8.Files permissions are not useful for me so how to deal with it on ext4, so that if i will use that pen drive on new or re installed system there will be no access problems?\nThank you for an answer\n\nA: \nHow does it works is the encryption AES 256?\n\nAES stands for Advanced Encryption Standard and is considered a strong algorithm for cryptography.\n\nIt will ask me the password any time i need access the files on pendrive?\n\nYes, that's the whole point of having it secured; you'll need to provide a secret to be able to read/write to it.\n\nWhy [...] ext4 + luks [...] \"eat\" about 130mb?\n\nThe Linux Ext2/3/4 file system doesn't 'eat' space - this is either the filesystem overhead, or the reserved space. Similar question: New ext4 partition and used space\n\nWhat will happen if insert to anther linux computer?\n\nDepends on the configuration of that other Linux computer. There's no single answer to this. If you need this to work on another PC, you should make sure at least libcryptsetup, a relatively recent Linux kernel and a capable file manager is installed.\n\nWhat if i put it into windows with ext drivers installed, will it works asking for password?\n\nNo. Besides Ext2/3/4 'drivers' for Windows, you'll need FreeOTFE too.\n\nWill ext4 + luks not overuse \"wear\" my pendrive too fast?\n\nIt does not feature any optimization for flash drives. The block size of a common USB flash drive is bigger than de default dm-crypt one, so I guess it's not creating additional overhead in terms of wear levelling. However, Ext4 does journalling by default. You may want to turn that feature off at creation time.\n\nIsn't FAT32 support drive up to 32GB only?\n\nNo. Where did you get that information? It supports volumes up to 2-16 TB (depending on the block size). As @Rinzwind pointed out in his comment, Windows might be limited to accessing/formatting up tot 32 GB by default.\n", "Q: How do I automatically mute/unmute sound during a certain time period (e.g. night)? Is there an app to mute the computer say 10PM to 7:30AM? (On Android devices I use: phone silencer app )\n\nA: Following the link in the comments of @Rinzwind: How do you mute from the command line?\nUse crontab to mute and unmute the computer at night as follows:\nOpen a terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T and enter one of the the following lines to edit the /etc/cron.d file:\nFor a regular user, use the following command:\ncrontab -e\n\nFor system-wide solution, use the following command:\nsudo crontab -e\n\nAt the end of the resulting file add the following two lines:\n00 22 * * * amixer set Master mute\n29 07 * * * amixer set Master unmute\n\nPress Ctrl+X and then Y to save and exit crontab.\nExplanations:\nEach line in crontab has five time-and-date fields, followed by a command, followed by a newline character ('\\n'). The fields are separated by spaces. The five time-and-date fields cannot contain spaces. The five time-and-date fields are as follows: \n\n\n*\n\n*minute (0-59),\n\n*hour (0-23, 0 = midnight), \n\n*day (1-31), \n\n*month (1-12), \n\n*weekday (0-6, 0 = Sunday).\n\n\nSee the CronHowto in Ubuntu Help for more details.\nNote: This will not work if the machine is off at the predefined time. For example, if power goes off at 9PM and comes back at 11PM, audio will not be muted when the power comes back.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: Upgrading from 12.04 to 12.10 broke display in my NX client I performed an in-place upgrade from 12.04 to 12.10 by following the system update prompts.  When I attempted to log in from an NX client (No Machine), my XFCE session was missing fonts almost everywhere, and some of the windowing elements were either missing or drawn incompletely.  It was like this with XFCE and Unity, but less so with KDE.\nThe only way I could get the NX client to display all of the text and draw the GUI elements properly was to select the option Disable the render extension in the NX client options.\nI tried reconfiguring the X server dpkg-reconfigure xorg, switching video drivers (from open to NVIDIA), switching window managers, disabling font aliasing. . . .

It's called OpenNX and even better, it's open-source! It shouldn't have the performance/legibility hit that the workaround above does either.\nHopefully this will help anyone else struggling with font rendering issues on 12.10 this seems like a much more \"workable\" workaround (and doesn't require messing with Ubuntu). Especially with the Windows version of the client which doesn't have the Disable the render extension option that the Linux client does.\n\nA: I am the one that asked nomachine NX: Text missing on all gtk interface (Unity and Gnome Classic)\nI have found a .... new solution?\nhttp://www.nomachine.com/preview/download-package.php?Prod_Id=14\nI am guessing that's nomachine's next version of their server/player.  I tried the player preview with my my existing nomachine nx server setup, without upgrading the nx server.  It seems to work.

I was trying to install a new Ubuntu 12.04 installation next to my old 10.10 installation, and I've run into a problem.

So, when I installed 10.10, I split the system into /boot on /dev/sda1 and / on /dev/sda6.\nWhen I installed 12.04 LTS, I totally forgot about it, and now I need to reinstall GRUB.

Does anyone know if we can develop apps for ubuntu for phones in Python ?\nPyQT / PySide would seem to support also QML. But can we use them on the phones ?\n\nA: The problem is, that you also need the Python Qt bindings - PySide. Unfortunately the project is not in a good shape and there is almost no work on Qt5 support AFAIK. So it is not really clear if it will be possible to use Python to develop mobile apps. Currently the SDK seems to only support C++.\n\nA: I may not have the answer, but since they said you will be able to program your application with desktop languages like C/C++, and they have partners like Unity 3D and else, I think it means Ubuntu for phones is compatible with any languages already compatible with Ubuntu desktop. It must be a matter of installing the python libraries...\n\nA: It's true that PySide's future on Qt 5 is uncertain, but that's not the case for PyQt. So technically, it should be possible to do this.\nThen there's the point of politics: Canonical said they will release the source code for Ubuntu Phone in due time, so it's very likely that someone hacks support for Python in it after that. If Canonical itself will support that is not clear yet, as far as I'm aware they didn't make a statement on that yet. Nor is it clear for any OEMs/operators (because there aren't any (known) yet).\nUPDATE: Canonical released the source (as expected), and some operators are known now. It seems like Canonical's not planning to add Python support for the SDK themselves (at least for now), but that they're open to contributions. (Source.)\n\nA: Yes, You can use multiple programming languages, but Python is the recommended one  http://developer.ubuntu.com/resources/programming-languages/python/\nupdate: it used to be the recommended language https://web.archive.org/web/20130524092542/http://developer.ubuntu.com/resources/programming-languages/python\n... when writing something new we recommend using Python.\n\n", "Q: How can several branches be nested in the same directory in a bzr-builder recipe?

None of the subdirectories have the same name, so all these things could peacefully coexist.\nI thought about nest-parting the individual addons, but there are many, many addons in openobject-addons. It would be very tedious to list each one individually, plus I'd have to remember to touch the recipe when adding a new addon.\nAny way around this?\n\nA: You cannot nest multiple branches into the same directory.\nHowever, the problem is that youa re nesting the directories wrong. You need to specify a unique name for a directory which doesn't yet exist, as the last argument to the nest or nest-part commands. Something like this should work, assuming the directories don't already exist:\nnest addons lp:~bitglue/openobject-addons/7.0 openerp/addons/openobject-addons\nnest-part web lp:~openerp/openerp-web/7.0 addons openerp/addons/openerp-web\n\nAlternatively, as these are all separate sources, you should package them separately, rather than trying to shove them all into a single source branch, I think.\n", "Q: How can I show the connecting line in treeview of nautilus?

So, since libgtk-family can't be of different versions, apt-get gets an expectacular dependency error. So how to solve this? We use the hold package status:\necho \"libgtk-3-bin hold\" | sudo dpkg --set-selections\necho \"libgtk-3-0 hold\" | sudo dpkg --set-selections\n\nWith this, you can upgrade normally until the dependency conflicts get resolved in the Ubuntu repositories.\nOnce you feel that you can allow upgrades, just run:\necho \"libgtk-3-bin install\" | sudo dpkg --set-selections\necho \"libgtk-3-0 install\" | sudo dpkg --set-selections\n\nAnother option is to force versions to being installed:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install libgtk-3-0=3.6.0-0ubuntu3.1 libgtk-3-common=3.6.0-0ubuntu3.1 libgtk-3-0=3.6.0-0ubuntu3.1\n\nThis will tell apt-get to install everything using the same version number.\n\nA: For anyone who still has those problems. \nI believe they appear when you manually delete some packages but don't clean all the rubbish they leave behind. In my case I had libgtk still installed and it was a newer version then I wanted to install. So it really didn't know what to do with different versions of the library.\nAfter just deleting the libgtk-3-0 and other packages with similar problems everything went on fine.\nPS. Note that if you have done \necho \"libgtk-3-0 hold\" | sudo dpkg --set-selections\nThen you HAVE to do \necho \"libgtk-3-0 install\" | sudo dpkg --set-selections in order to be able to delete this package.\n", "Q: \"dh_install: hamsterdb-dev missing files (usr/lib/pkgconfig/*), aborting\" building a package I'm author of a small open-source database library and want to supply .deb packages through my ppa.

Otherwise, you have to figure out how to not modify them, or undo the modifications.\n", "Q: selinux folder in root directory (/) While navigating through my files, I noticed a \"selinux\" folder in root (/); it doesn't have any files in it, has completely root(root) permissions, and when I looked up about it, it seems to be some sort of server administration program or something.\nIt also appears to have become unattended since Karmic, and is apparently completely broken in Precise.  Just to make sure, I ran sudo apt-get remove selinux in the terminal, and sure enough, it said I had no such program installed.\nCan I delete this folder? Is there anything else I should remove/purge?\nLastly, any ideas as to how this folder might have got here? I never installed selinux on my computer, as far as I can remember...\nEdit: I also just noticed another folder called \"srv\".  It, as well, has no files in it and is owned by root. Is this folder related to the \"selinux\" folder, and can I delete it as well?\n\n\n*\n\n*Running Xubuntu 12.10\n\n\nA: As for the /srv folder, it is listed in the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard as a data folder for system services.\nThere's a bug report from libselinux on Kubuntu a few years ago outlining the same basic question.

For now assume I have a perfectly working command expected to output a filename from the current directory.\nI thought I was going to be able to do latest | vi, to open the latest modified file in the directory, but it seems this won't work - vi complains that the output is not a terminal. I saw a stackoverflow question which suggested the issue is related to subshells and piping and so tried \nlatest | vi < `tty` > `tty`\n\nBut that just gets me \n`tty`:ambiguous redirect\n\nI'm sure there's something basic I am not getting about pipes here - I only recently started trying to use them in earnest, any ideas?\n\nA: It's simple.

(Which you type in manually from the boot screen, unless you edit the .iso before burning it.)\nSo the computer boots syslinux from your optical disc, which then loads vmlinuz and the initrd from the optical disc, but with a kernel commandline which tells the scripts in the initrd to scan all the mountable partitions it finds for an iso image, and loopback-mount that.\nI've been trying to figure out how to make this work with a USB stick that has the unpacked contents of the ISO on it, so you could boot it normally on computers that can boot from USB mass-storage devices.\nedit: like this old page  describes making a boot-CD for Ubuntu on a flash drive.  cdrom-detect/try-usb=true on the kernel commandline might still work.\nedit2: yup, confirmed that the Ubuntu live-CD initramfs still supports cdrom-detect/try-usb=true.  I hex-editted txt.cfg in the Xubuntu iso image (instead of unpacking / repacking the iso) before burning to a DVD+RW, so now I have a boot disc that looks for a USB stick (without having to type that every boot).  It finds the stick made with usb-creator-gtk from that .iso.  (Not a great program: It ignores an iso filename passed on the commandline, and it seems to insist on blowing away the previous contents of your USB stick, instead of just adding files and then using syslinux to set up the boot sector.)\nOr even better, if there's a way to set up a USB stick to boot Linux regardless of whether the BIOS sees it as a USB-HDD (normal modern computers), or as a USB-ZIP (10-year-old A7V600 for example can boot USB-ZIP or USB-FDD, but not usb mass storage.  It will load something off a USB flash drive when it sees it as USB-FDD, but then the loaded code just hangs.)\n\nA: I don't think you can use the usb. Since the computer you're trying to install xubuntu on is old, it might not be able to succesfully boot the live cd. I recommend using the ubuntu 12.10 minimal cd. You won't get the ubiquity-slideshow because the installation is from commandline, there is no gui but the installation is easy. Installing this way works well on older computers. When you use the minimal cd there will be only 28 mb on the cd, the rest of the os will be downloaded during the installation. During the installation you will be able to choose your preferred desktop. LXDE/Lubuntu is best for older computers, but Xfce/Xubuntu is available. Its also possible to install only a commandline system and add a desktop environment and other programs later. You can get the minimal iso from here: \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD\n\nA: I ended up copying the content of the USB stick to a local hard drive using dd:\ndd if=/dev/sdd of=/dev/sdb oflag=direct\n\nWhere sdd is the USB stick and sdb the local hard drive. Then I removed the CD, rebooted, and installation went fine.\nThis works only if you have two local hard drives (one as the install media, one as the target system). I guess you could do the same with fdisk and partitions, but somehow when I tried it did not work.\nEven though this solution worked, I accept jeroen's solution as it works even when you don't have two local hard drives.\n", "Q: How to get mit-scheme from the package manager?

First up is this true?  and if it is, should I install ubuntu using the windows installer or via the CD/USB drive method?  \nI was reading about the differences between these two options and for the windows installer method one difference stated was that \"If your Windows install goes pear-shaped, you may lose access to your Wubi install, too.\" so from this I'm lead to think that in my case it would pointless to have ubuntu there if I install it through the windows installer, so I should choose the CD/USB option.  Some clarification on the issue would be much appreciated.  Thanks :)\nP.S. I'm a really inexperienced user (have never installed ubuntu before or used a dual boot system) so I'm really sorry if the question I asked seems stupid.    \n\nA: It depends on how you are going to use Ubuntu. If you don't know how much you want to use Ubuntu, or if you are going to use Windows more often, use the Windows Installer. Ubuntu can easily be uninstalled with the Windows installer, and you don't need to worry about partitioning if you do uninstall it.\nIf you are sure that you are going to primarily use Ubuntu, but you are still going to use Windows from time to time and you have enough disk space, dual boot. There is less of a risk of Ubuntu damaging your Windows install and Ubuntu will be faster. Also, dual booting is easy. Just click \"Install ubuntu alongside Windows\" in the installer\n", "Q: Unable to download Ubuntu from the official website in Windows I tried to download Ubuntu from the main website twice, even made a donation through PayPal, yet both times the download I expected didn't start.

If I upgrade, will my Subversion data be hidden or lost in some way?\n\nA: It's a good thing you are trying to upgrade to a supported release. Upgrades should run without issues as package maintainers are doing quite good at handling this. Also, packages should not touch user data directories. However, as is valid for all valuable data, make sure you have a backup!\nConcerning Subversion repositories, you should have to worry about incompatibilities either, as 1.6.x is packages from Natty 11.04 until Quantal 12.10.

My RAID1 is years old and has also had no issues until recently. The disks are healthy.

This is a good thing if you have a reason for it. One reason for enabling this is to minimize the amount of data loss during power failures, as it will try to disable all kinds of caching features. This is useful if you're interested in the safest possible way to write data to your disk.\nAs you've stated, you don't have this particular requirement and you'd like to see a better performance instead. By removing the sync options, it is back to the defaults, and regular caches are not disabled explicitly. This allows data (file contents) to be written asynchronously (journal and metadata still synchronously I assume). The disadvantage of this is that more data could be lost in case of a sudden power failure. (This is only concerning the data being written at that point in time.)\nSimilarly, there's the async option to force writes to happen asynchronously. This is considered less safe, and should only be used if you need the extra performance it gains in your case. Stick with the defaults in case you're unsure.\nEither way, the journal design of the filesystem will ensure data appearing present is not half-written or inconsistent by default. Returning from sync to the defaults is 'just safe' in these terms.\n", "Q: Pre-install and post-install advice for installing Ubuntu 12.10 before installing folding@home Machine specs:\n\n*\n\n*Intel S5520SC workstation board with dual Intel X5570 Hyperthreaded Quad core\n\n*24GB Unbuffered DDR3\n\n*320GB WD HD\n\n*2 X ATI HD 5770 GPU\n\nI have prepared a bootable USB key with ubuntu-12.10-desktop-amd64 which I have tested prior to attempting to install the OS.\nIs there anything else that I need to do before and/or after installing the OS in order to install the folding@home app for Ubuntu?\n\nA: As dumb as it may sound, make sure you have a power supply and case. Your power supply must adhere to the amounts of watts your motherboard, processor, and other supplies require. Also make sure you have all the chords to connect all your supplies to your power supply. (not gonna go far without that...) Otherwise, you look pretty good to go besides a screen, keyboard, and display.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, SSL, IRC: Unable to build with OpenSSL I have a small server running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. On it I wanted to set up IRC with SSL support. it appears that ircd-hybrid is most popular. I am not married to using it so other options are welcome. However, I am not seeing other options.\nI have installed using apt-get. That isn't the problem. The problem is that the apt-get install version doesn't enable SSL. Try connecting to the SSL port 6697 using SSL and it will not work. Hence the work to build it myself. If you actually follow the source of the ircd-hybrid package the configuration requires that you edit it and add the \"USE_OPENSSL = 1\" option. \nBecause hybrid doesn’t support OpenSSL by default, you have to do a manual patch to get it working.\nAnyway, I followed the instructions (I listed a couple at the end) and install ircd-hybrid no problem. It's actually running now. However, I noticed that SSL isn't working. The port is never being listened to. Digging deeper, I look back at the building process and notice that OpenSSL isn't being included.\nSo I have been trying to build and just to clarify, here is the ./configure output:\nCompiling ircd-hybrid 7.2.2\n\nInstalling into: /usr\nZiplinks ................ yes\n**OpenSSL ................. no**\nModules ................. shared\nIPv6 support ............ yes\nNet I/O implementation .. sigio\nEFnet server ............ no (use example.conf)\nHalfops support ......... yes\nSmall network ........... no\nG-Line voting ........... yes\n\nA few line up in the output of the ./configure script I notice that it seems that all the encryption algos are unavailable!\nchecking for OpenSSL... /usr\nchecking for OpenSSL 0.9.6 or above... found\nchecking for RSA_free in -lcrypto... yes\nchecking for EVP_bf_cfb... no\nchecking for EVP_cast5_cfb... no\nchecking for EVP_idea_cfb... no\nchecking for EVP_rc5_32_12_16_cfb... no\nchecking for EVP_des_ede3_cfb... no\nchecking for EVP_des_cfb... no\n\nWhich if you look into the configure script you'll see that at least one of the encryption libraries need to be enabled. This is a hunch as I am not entirely positive about this. It seems that OpenSSL has disabled RC5 and a couple other algos. \nI've rebuilt and installed OpenSSL with the enable-rc5 and other flags but no dice.\nThis is on Ubuntu 12.04. Help? Anyone? I'd like to enable SSL on IRC on my personal server. It doesn't have to be ircd-hybrid.\nI have been looking at the forums on Ubuntu and generally following these instructions.\nThanks!\nEDIT\nI have been chatting with the fella that figured out the solution on the first link I posted above. He was able to successfully build and run with SSL on a clean 12.04 install using the default OpenSSL package and the patched pircd-hybrid package. The system I am on was originally built using 10.x. I wonder if doing those upgrades to 12.04 LTS somehow broke something along the way. For example, his running of the ircd-hybrid configuration yields these in the crypto part of the setup:\nchecking for OpenSSL... /usr\nchecking for OpenSSL 0.9.6 or above... found\nchecking for RSA_free in -lcrypto... yes\nchecking for EVP_bf_cfb... yes\nchecking for EVP_cast5_cfb... yes\nchecking for EVP_idea_cfb... no\nchecking for EVP_rc5_32_12_16_cfb... no\nchecking for EVP_des_ede3_cfb... yes\nchecking for EVP_des_cfb... yes\n\nI am running the latest open ssl:\n$ openssl version\nOpenSSL 1.0.1 14 Mar 2012\n\nNot sure why the configure script isn't seeing those cipher algos.\nEDIT 2: Just installed a VM on my ESXi box. Brand new 32-bit install 12.04 LTS. Same problem. Installs fine via apt-get but SSL is not enabled. Tried the patch and it is also missing the algos as I listed above. \n\nA: Is there a reason you're building these packages yourself? Ubuntu already has these packages premade for you.\napt-get install ircd-hybrid\n\nOr if you'd rather see what other choices are available:\napt-cache search ircd\n\n\nA: I've just managed to get this going after a lot of hassle.  Sadly, I don't think I'm going to be able to provide a \"how to do it\", but I do intend to submit a bug report.  Also, my understanding is sketchy, so excuse me if I use the wrong terminology.\nBasically, the problem is an incompatibility between ircd-hybrid and libssl1.0.0.  Where it's looking for cyphers such as EVP_bf_cfb, in libssl1.0.0 it needs to be using EVP_bf_cfb64, etc.  I did some fudging around and made it compile with the cyphers being detected, but it still didn't connect to other servers.\nSadly, whilst libssl0.9.8 is available in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, libssl-dev is only available in the 1.0.0 flavour.  I installed the 0.9.8 packages from 10.04 LTS (not recommended, I'm sure), but then there were various compilation issues in ircd-hybrid relating to a different problem.  I've fixed these, and have finally got a working ircd-hybrid running on 64bit 12.04 LTS.\nMy guess is that, since SSL isn't enabled by default in ircd-hybrid, when other things change and break only the SSL build, it doesn't get spotted by the package maintainers.\nAs I say, I shall now attempt to file a bug report against 12.04 LTS, and see if that gets anywhere.\n", "Q: How do you append info to an environment variable?

I want to write a shell script that will transfer all tabs from Firefox to Google Chrome on Ubuntu.\n\nA: Following the idea given in the comments (getting the links from the sessionrestore.js file in the FF profile dir), here is a Bash script with embedded Python to open the current tabs in Google Chrome:\ngoogle-chrome $(cat ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default/sessionstore.js | python -c \"\"\"\nimport sys, json\njsobj = json.loads(sys.stdin.read())\nfor tab in jsobj['windows'][0]['tabs']:\n        print tab['entries'][0]['url'],\n        \"\"\")\n\nPlease note that although the script works alright, it isn't verifying anything.

PlayOnLinux installs the applications in separate virtual drives. Each virtual drive represents a different windows machine. I have configured PlayOnLinux on my laptop and installed several programs in it. \nThese programs go in the hidden .PlayOnLinux directory in home.\nMy .PlayOnLinux directory is about 12 GB in size. Along with virtual drives it also contains resources that PlayOnLinux downloads from internet such as Windows Service Pack and alternate versions of Wine.\nNot wanting to download/install everything again I copied the .PlayOnLinux directory to my second computer before running PlayOnLinux. \nHowever on startup PlayOnLinux initialized that directory to its own taste, flattening the 12GB directory to a mere 500 Kilobytes.\nMy question is - Is it possible to backup PlayOnLinux virtual drives? How?\nThis would be tremendously helpful in taking snapshots of drives for reverting later and for transferring settings to another system.\n\nA: Manual Backup\nFollowing the path you got (i.e., manually copy files), what you could do is run playonlinux for the first time, let it generate the default .PlayOnLinux folder, then quit the application, delete that folder and replace it with your own .PlayOnLinux folder. Then restart playonlinux and you should be able to use all of your applications that you were using before. You may have to tweak a few settings if you were using a different version of playonlinux before, but it should be a usable solution.\nNote: You must remember to let playonlinux run once before you quit it and copy your folder across from the backup drive. You mention you copied it before you ran playonlinux- this is the main problem, as playonlinux will overwrite the folder, as you have found out.\nPlayOnLinux Vault\nHowever, in the future you could use the 'playonlinux vault' (see screenshots below), which can be used to both backup and restore your applications. It is accessed through playonlinux > plugins > PlayOnLinux vault. It does backup the entire wine prefix that the application is installed in and all the other necessary playonlinux settings. It is a plugin, but is now installed by default. It is easy to use as you are guided through the various stages of the backup or restore. \nThe only downside is that the plugin takes a while to compress the backups, but the latest version of the plugin has an option to disable compression, which will improve speed and performance of the backup. Disable and remove the vault plugin in pluginmanager and then download the latest version from the official site and install it and enable it using pluginmanager. Now reload playonlinux and you will get the option to not use compression (see screenshot).\nThere are perhaps other ways of backing up your programs, but the two solutions discussed should be useful for you.\nScreenshots from the 'playonlinux' vault plugin:\n\n\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu cannot create partitions when I try to install The situation ~ I spilled some booze on my laptop a few months ago, since then I have been working a USB mouse and keyboard. \nOn Christmas day (yay!) my laptop died, made a funny noise then went to blue screen.

Or, actually, a lot on the low side :) On a 4Gb host machine I would give Ubuntu at least 2Gb - that is, if you want GUI, gedit and everything.

I'm doing a simple todo-list with QML for Ubuntu phone OS. Is there any standard way for accessing Ubuntu One Database to sync data?\n\nA: There will be; we're working on it. I plan to have the QML U1DB declarative API published soon.\nIn the meantime, until that arrives, you may find this code interesting; it is a simple notes app, but written with QML and using U1DB. This U1DB QML addition follows the declarative QML U1DB API I mentioned above, but it's a Python-based prototype of that API. So, it's very very hacky indeed, and will be replaced with a proper U1DB QML setup as part of the Ubuntu SDK, but you may find it useful to experiment with. In particular, you'll see from this code how to declaratively declare a U1DB database, indexes, documents, and queries, and from this code that a U1DBQuery is a ListModel. That code should give you some idea of how you will be able to use U1DB from QML in Ubuntu Phone, although I must repeat that the implementation of that API from Python is a hacky prototype.\n", "Q: How can I find all packages that depends on another? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to list package dependees (reverse dependencies)? \n\nI want to find all the packages in the Ubuntu repository that depends on one particular package.

Roland, I believe this action solves most of your problems!\nSee how on this text:\n\"\nUbuntu 64-bit users:\nIf you use the 64-bit version of Ubuntu (12.04, 11.10 etc), then even after doing all this, “Foxit” still won’t work. That’s simply because, Foxit only has a 32-bit version and for an any application that’s created to run under 32-bit processor instructions should undergo few changes in order to support the 64-bit instructions.\nBut you can install a special software library that “fakes” (emulates) a 32-bit processor using your actual 64-bit CPU and the program should run without issues. In Ubuntu (plus, GNU/Linux in general), we need a library called “ia32-libs” for that.\nIt could be because this library has a shi* load of dependencies  (needs a lot of individual packages, about 70-80MB to download), Ubuntu does not come with it pre-installed.\nSo, for all ya 64-bit users, after following all the above steps, there’s this one last step that you gotta do before you can enjoy our naughty little “Foxit”, and that is installing this software library. For that, open your Terminal window and enter the below command.\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs\nThat’s it, now it should work. A big thanks goes to “robert” (in the comment section), couldn’t have done it without you mate!, thank you  .\nBut as this needs a lot of libraries (somewhat an “unnecessary burden”, if you won’t really be running 32-bit apps in 64-bit Ubuntu that is), unless you really can’t live without “Foxit”, I humbly suggest that you try something else, “qpdfview” for instance?. *\nOy Gyan!, BTW, why did the default Foxit “.deb” installation fail?\nI honestly don’t know. But then again, that “.deb” file was last released more than two years ago!, so perhaps it’s some sort of an incompatibility issue.\nAnyhow, if you’ve been having troubles properly installing or running Foxit PDF reader in Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot or 12.04 Precise Pangolin then that’s one way to fix it (hopefully  ).

This seems right and shouldn't be the problem anyway because when I edit the file in the terminal on the server, special characters display as they should. \nAlready searched for hours but can't find the solution. Anyone an idea?\n\nA: Using UTF-8 can solve a lot of that problem, but you still have to use HTML entities for reserved XML characters (ampersand, less-than, greater-than). So, either use HTML entities or serve the webpage with an HTTP header that says it's UTF-8. That could be done with an HTML header or META tag:\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />\nOr, in the Ubuntu web server change the default encoding:\nApache: AddDefaultCharset utf-8\nnginx: charset utf-8;\nOn the terminal, you know that the server is using UTF-8 (locale), so make sure that your SSH client is set up correctly. For example, if using Putty, we have to set Putty's character set:\nPutty: Window->Translation->Remote character set: UTF-8\nOtherwise, it will use ISO-8859-1.\n\nAnd check what format the editor is using.\nfile file.ext\nWe should see \"UTF-8 Unicode text\" if the editor is writing UTF-8 files.\n", "Q: How can I get wireless to work on a Dell Latitude D610?

It will be built using and based on a lot of open source components, yes, e.g. OpenGL, Linux kernel, QML, etc.\nIt may consists of some closed source parts for various reasons: firmware for hardware support, a way to improve security (not discussing if that would be a good idea here), etc.\n\nIf [Ubuntu OS would be entirely open source], how could mobile carriers like AT&T lock the phone to work only with their SIM?\n\nOpen source software and a SIM-lock aren't really related here.\nThe radio part of a phone is a completely independent piece of hardware.

However, in the event that it did, and/or in the event that you wanted an immediate reflection of the default file associations in terminal (i.e. you're xdg-open'ing something in terminal) - you could source the default list in your current terminal session:\nsource /usr/share/applications/defaults.list\n\n\nA: I spent AGES trying to find a method that would work.

You could use xdg-open /path/to/folder/ while in the command line, for example. Or you could use a X application that requests a file.  \n\n*A dialog should appear to you requesting a default application to be your file manager. Type /usr/bin/nautilus there and confirm.\n\n\nAfter that, as long as you don't rename nemo to its original name/location, nautilus will be your default file manager again.\n", "Q: How can I change the keyboard shortcuts in nano?

I have a system with Ubuntu 11.10 and GRUB classic installed. Does an upgrade to the most recent version of Ubuntu also updates my GRUB to GRUB2?\n\nA: If your Ubuntu version is 11.10, it's unlikely you have GRUB \"classic\" installed, unless it is installed by another, separate operating system. Ubuntu started using GRUB2 in 9.10.\nOne point of confusion is that a GRUB installation with version number 1.98 or later is GRUB2. It's only GRUB1, or GRUB legacy, if the version is 1.97 or earlier.\nFurthermore, in Ubuntu, the normal package providing GRUB2 for machines with BIOSes is called grub-pc. (Traditionally, BIOS is a major part of what's thought to make a computer a \"PC,\" which may explain this naming convention.) The GRUB package for GRUB legacy is called grub.\n\n\n*\n\n*There is a grub2 package but currently it is a dummy package with grub-pc and grub-common as dependencies.\n\n\nI am composing this answer from an Ubuntu 11.10 system. My system definitely has GRUB2, but the grub-pc version is 1.99-12ubuntu5.1. That's perfectly normal.\nIf you upgrade your Ubuntu 11.10 system to a later version of Ubuntu, the version of GRUB it provides will also be upgraded. It will take on a version number that starts with 2. But it was GRUB2 before that, too.\n\nA: yeah. latest ubuntu using grub2, anyway u can install back to grub-pc (legacy) for replace grub2.\n", "Q: Linking error when trying to compile on a shared drive I am trying to compile the OpenCV library on a shared drive on my system.

Moving the build directory to a ubuntu only folder (not shared with the mac) solved the problem.\nMoral of the story- don't build in shared folders that cross platforms.\n", "Q: System restore for new users? I am a computer repair technician, with the release of Win 8 my clients are uncomfortable with the new user interface.\nI have been introducing some of them to Ubuntu (12.04). The one thing missing is system restore like in Windows 7.\nI understand that there is a recovery option in grub, but I need something extremely easy for new users to use. \nI found this: http://sourceforge.net/projects/system-restore/ but it hasn't seen any updates since 2009.  Any input would be helpful.\n\nA: Ubuntu does not need a system restore. It is simply not applicable.\nProvided that you stick to the default repositories, and to outside trusted repositories where necessary (ask on Ubuntu Forums if you are unsure if a repository is trusted), your system will always work. Individual applications from outside repositories may fail, but they are dead easy to \"unwind\" (that's what the package manager is for).\nThe recovery option is there for three reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*The initial installation does not work properly, and you cannot log in normally.\n\n*Something goes wrong with an upgrade because of hardware problems (this is rare).\n\n*You enjoy messing around with your system's innards, and sometimes you mess just a little too much!\n\n\nDon't worry about System Restore. Ubuntu doesn't have a Registry, and even kernel upgrades are quickly and easily unwound.\nBTW, 12.04 is a good choice, being an LTS release.\n", "Q: shortcuts lost after restart I'm using Ubuntu 12.10.\nWhen I try setting some shortcuts and restart the System they are \"deactivated\" or default (but they are still working). After one more restart they do not work any more. \nCan you tell me how to handle this problem, please? \nThanks a lot!\n\nA: This is what I use as a workaround:\n1) Install ccsm\n2) Open ccsm\n3) Go to \"Preferences\" and \"Export\" your settings (save)\n4) Go to \"Preferences\" > \"Backend\" and set it to \"Flat-file configuration Backend\".\n5) Right click on Desktop and make a New Folder\n6) Open the New Folder and navigate to /usr/bin\n7) Open gnome-terminal from within the folder\n8) Into terminal, run: ccsm\n9) Go to \"Preferences\" and \"Import\" the settings saved on step \"3\"\n10) Done. \n\n\nA: I recommend not using the flat-file. It will nuke your compiz settings so that you have to:  \nrm ~/.compiz-1 ~/.config/compiz-1\n\nInstead try this workaround:\nCustom keyboard shortcuts are reset. How can I make them set permanently?\n", "Q: 12.04 LTS, update-manager behaves contradictory? I have installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS two weeks ago by downloading the iso image, creating a startup usb stick from this image, booting the live system and finally installing. I have been working successfully during these two weeks in order to get everything I need up and running. :-)\nSince most of the software needed is properly working I decided to tell the update-manager to look for packages to update. After downloading the package information the update-manager says (1) \"The software on this computer is up to date. The package information was just updated\". However, immediately after this, a second dialog pops up and says (2) \"Not all updates can be installed. Run a partial upgrade, to install as many updates as possible\". If the software is up to date, there should be nothing to install, so (2) contradicts (1). \nChoosing the offered \"Partial Upgrade\" results in (3) \"Upgrading over remote connection not supported. You are running the upgrade over a remote ssh connection with a frontend that does not support this. Please try a text mode upgrade with 'do-release-upgrade'.\" Finally, launching do-release-upgrade on the console (e.g. Ctrl-Alt-F5) reports (4) \"Checking for a new Ubuntu release. No new release found.\" Since (4) supports (1), it does not matter if upgrading by means of a remote connection is supported (3).\nPlease give me a hint how to get the update-manager properly working. I can't tell, if my installation is complete and up to date or if there are package updates available, I should install but my package management has an aching stomach. \nKind regards,\nBerket\n\nA: To try to solve your problem, open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and enter the following two commands, one at a time, in order. The first command will ask for your password. The second command may take a little while if you have not managed to update since installing.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nWhen complete, close the terminal and restart your machine. Try Update Manager again.\n", "Q: How to detect processor correct temperature in conky I am using conky&conkyforecast to have a nice widget containing some system information and weather data.\nBut I can see that the temperature that conky shows is different than the one I get running in terminal sensors.\nConky script line:\nTemperature: ${alignr}${acpitemp}°C\nRunning sensors in terminat gets this:\nflorin@florin-Satellite-C650:~$ sensors\nacpitz-virtual-0\nAdapter: Virtual device\ntemp1:        +49.0°C  (crit = +110.0°C)\n\ncoretemp-isa-0000\nAdapter: ISA adapter\nCore 0:       +51.0°C  (high = +80.0°C, crit = +90.0°C)\nCore 2:       +60.0°C  (high = +80.0°C, crit = +90.0°C)\n\nConky shows 49° temperature.\nHow can I make them show the same temperature?

I have a CSV file like this:\nhostname1 | role1 | environment | tag,list | |\nhostname2 | role2 | environment | tag,list,longer | |\nhostname3 | role3 | environment | | |\n\nI need a sed expression that adds to the column with the tags (the 4th column) a new tag if there are no tags already, and inserts a new tag with a comma if there are existing tags. I have tried this:\nsed \"s/\\(^$server |.*|.*|\\) \\(.*|.*|$\\)/\\1 new,\\2/\" testfile.csv\n\nwhere server is defined externally like so:\nserver=\"hostname2\"\n\nbut it doesn't work, and it doesn't deal with the comma if the tag list is empty.\nHow would you do this with sed?\n\nA: A common mistakes when discovering regular expression is to think that they can be used as parser (and so you see questions like \"how can I parse an XML file using REGEXs?\"). However you can't insert too much logic inside a regular expression: for complex problems, like yours, you either need a parser or more than one regular expression.\nIf you want to go with the way of regular expressions, you need two: one for the non-empty tags case and one for the empty tags field. The two regex could look like the following ones:\ns/^(hostname123 \\|.*?\\|.*?\\|\\s*)(\\S+\\s*\\|.*?\\|)$/\\1new,\\2/\ns/^(hostname123 ?\\|.*?\\|.*?\\|)\\s*(\\|.*?\\|)$/\\1 new \\2/\n\nThese two expressions can be used either with two sed piped together:\nsed 'expression1' | sed 'expression2'\n\nor, better, with one command in the following way:\nsed -r -e '/^'\"$server\"' \\|/ { s/^(.*?\\|.*?\\|.*?\\|\\s*)(\\S+\\s*\\|.*?\\|)$/\\1new,\\2/; s/^(.*?\\|.*?\\|.*?\\|)\\s*(\\|.*?\\|)$/\\1 new \\2/ }' testfile.csv\n\nThis is more efficient than using two seds because it does not parse the file twice.\n", "Q: apt-get gcc 4.7 multilib I followed the instructions from @jokerdino here in askubuntu\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gcc-4.7\n\nBut to get a successful compilation I've had to:\n\n\n*\n\n*export LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu  \n\n*sudo  ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/crti.o   /usr/lib64/crti.o  \n\n*sudo  ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/crtn.o   /usr/lib64/crtn.o\n\n\nWhich I understand effectively breaks the Ubuntu multilib model.\nSo how do I compile the correct way and remove the links?\nBecause now I'd like to cross-compile for 32 bits.\n(Using Precise)\n\nA: I removed the symbolic links posted in my question.  \nThen with @shuttle87's suggestion in askubuntu\nI did the following:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall binutils  \nsudo apt-get install --reinstall build-essential  \nsudo apt-get install --reinstall libc6-dev  \nsudo apt-get install --reinstall gcc-4.7-multilib   \nsudo apt-get install --reinstall g++-4.7-multilib \n\nThen this worked:  gcc -m32 foo.c\nto compile for 80386.\nBut to compile for x86-64 gcc foo.c did NOT work.    \nSo I tried: \n gcc foo.c -L /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu\n\nBut that didn't work either.

After an upgrade, Unity would not load. It just froze in a black screen, no mouse movement, no nothing. I went to recovery mode to see what had happened. At first I removed the Nvidia driver and the system booted correctly. I then installed the Nvidia driver (Using the nvidia-current that comes by default with no additional PPA installed) and the problem appeared. I then try the PPA for X-Swat and the PPA from Xorg Edgers, both of which also failed with the same problem.\nI continued checking the /var/log files, specially the Xorg and syslog ones to see what had happened. After trying stuff like sudo modprobe nvidia I saw that the module was not correctly created, hence I did not have for example the nvidia-xconfig command. So I downloaded all header files needed (Generic and the specific version) and reinstalled the nvidia drivers. This time the module was installed and I could have access to all Nvidia commands like nvidia-xconfig to create the xorg.conf file for example.\nBut the same problem persisted. It would not load Unity, it would get stuck right before showing the desktop in a black screen.\nAfter checking some more as my pastebin file shows there were some problems between ACPI and the X Server.\nOn line 55 we can see the following: \n 48.651] (WW) Open ACPI failed (/var/run/acpid.socket) (No such file or directory)\n\nAnd then starting on line 178 we can see the following:\n[    49.993] (II) NVIDIA(0): ACPI: failed to connect to the ACPI event daemon; the daemon\n[    49.993] (II) NVIDIA(0):     may not be running or the \"AcpidSocketPath\" X\n[    49.993] (II) NVIDIA(0):     configuration option may not be set correctly.

This is an Intel DZ68DB motherboard with an Nvidia 560 ti video card.\nThere have been also other distros that have had the same problem:\nArch Linux\nGentoo\nRed Hat\nI have also checked to see if I had acpid installed already and yes. It is running correctly. For what I have understood, it is a timing issue where the X Server and acpid try to load asynced so X loads faster, but since it loaded before acpid, it gets this error when the Nvidia card wants to use ACPI. So a reset of X would help since acpid would be loaded before the second X server but since the system is frozen this is not doable.\nThe last error I found while doint my checks was with sudo cat /var/log/syslog | grep NV which gave me this:\nJan  3 22:39:23 cyrex kernel: [    3.789322] NVRM: GPU at 0000:01:00.0 has fallen off the bus.\n\nSo now I have a \"GPU has fallen off the bus\" issue. \nHow fast was that bus going I wonder?\nI should add that I have tested all versions that come with 12.10 (nvidia-current, updates, experimental) and also the ones that come in X-Swat PPA and Xorg Edges PPA. All give the same problems.\nUPDATE 1 - Test 1\nDid a test in the following way:\nConnected the SSD I was using to another computer that also had an Nvidia Card, this time a 9500 GT. I also connected the other computer's HDD to my computer. Basically switching hard drives.\nUbuntu in the other computer is working fine, but the HDD that was working before on the other computer, when I connected it to my computer it gave the same error as mentioned in this question.\nIn this test, the only thing I changed was the computer for the Ubuntu I was using and it worked. But if I used another Ubuntu from another computer on mine, the error appears, showing that the hardware might be the problem. At least I will need to check the BIOS setup.\nUPDATE 2 - Test 2\nRemoved the video card and did an exchange of it with the other computer. It still worked. So I had, the SSD that had Ubuntu not working on the other computer, with the same 560 TI that was not working and even then it still worked.\nThe only thing left was the motherboard, it is the Intel DZ68DB with already upgraded firmware. I find it odd that it was working 2 weeks ago and not anymore, but this shows that the problem might be BIOS configuration or Motherboard not compatible somehow. I'll keep testing.\nSolution 1 (Not working for me) - Some users have reported that doing the following helped them:\nEdit your /etc/rc.local file: sudo nano /etc/rc.local and add the following line before the exit 0 statement:\n/usr/bin/nvidia-smi -pm 1\nSave and reboot. This will set your video card to Persistence Mode. To see if it worked, after reboot type: \n/usr/bin/nvidia-smi -q | grep -i Persistence and if you see:\nPersistence Mode            : Enabled\n\nThen you know it is Enabled\nSolution 2 (Not working for me) - Some users have reported that doing the following helped them:\nEdit your grub menu:\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub and in the line that says:\n GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nAdd to it one or all of the following kernel options:\nacpi=noirq\nthermal.off=1\nFor example if add both it should look like this:\n GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi=noirq thermal.off=1\"\n\nNow save and type update-grub. Then reboot.\nFor anybody with similar problems, if they have done everything, I recommend also trying out the tests I have conducted. That way you know if it is Ubuntu, the video card or any other hardware.\n\nA: After almost 3 days of battle, I managed (If you read the whole question) to discard everything but the motherboard. So I took the motherboard out, did some cleaning on it and put it back on. Just to clear any confusion, when I say cleaning I literally mean, taking the motherboard out, removing anything connected to it or that it generates any type of electrical current (Like the CR2032 battery) and put the motherboard under a hose with a lot of water pressure. After cleaning it with a lot with water, I left it to dry for 2 days minimum and put it back together.\nEverything is working perfectly and I can happily say that it works in the 32 and 64 bit versions of 12.04, 12.10 and even 13.04 (Which I had to test when I had the problem since I thought it was an Ubuntu issue at the time).\nSo if you happen to have done everything in the question and you still have problems, the most likely cause might be either an option in the BIOS (Which I can not cover here because of the amount of BIOS settings that exist) or that your hardware needs some maintenance.\nHope this helps somebody because it took me too much work to figure it out so it might save someone else time.\n", "Q: Is the Ubuntu Mobile SDK available for Mac OS X or Windows? I'm a mobile app developer. I code for Android and iOS on Mac OS.\nI don't want to buy another computer just to code for Ubuntu Mobile.\nWill the Ubuntu Mobile SDK be available for Mac OS or Windows?\n\nA: There is no SDK preview available for other platforms other than Ubuntu at this point.\nHowever, you can either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu on a virtual machine and try the preview, or\n\n*Manually install the Ubuntu QML components on another platform\n\n\nThe first should be relatively trivial to set up, whereas the second should in theory work, but it's not been tested and obviously not supported.\n", "Q: Best way to put sensitive files on web server and keep them fro being accessible? I need to put a private key on my web server for use with a php script, so I need the web server to be able to access the file in php script, but not allow users from the outside to be able to access this file.\nBasically what I'm asking is where is the best place to put the file in the file system, and how do I set permissions/What are the correct permissions to set?\nI have a newly setup Ubuntu 11.04 Server, and I am using the LAMP package.\n\nA: Outside the document root.

However, if Apache is configured with user dirs (~/public_html), then any user could ask Apache to read it. Or, any user that can create documents that will be read by the web server could read it. \nA better solution is to read the key from a database or as a variable within the script.

However you cannot use it to install a iso that is not a OS\n\nA: An ISO image is a file that contains a complete copy of a CD or DVD. You can either use this file to create a DVD or mount the file on a local drive.\nOn Linux, you will need to use the mount command. First make a mount point, which is just a folder. For example:\nmkdir /media/mathworks\n\nThen mount the downloaded ISO to that directory. For this example, the ISO is in the home folder under the downloads folder and the ISO is called matlab.iso(if you have downloaded on to the same system):\nmount -t iso9660 -o loop ~/downloads/matlab.iso /media/mathworks\n\nNow you can navigate there and run the installer as if it were a copy of the DVD, for example:\ncd /media/mathworks  \n\n\n./install\n\nOn Windows, this would require third-party software to create a virtual CD or DVD drive from an ISO image.\n", "Q: Problems with nvidia-settings and nvidia-xconfig When I start nvidia-settings it gives me:\n\nYou do not appear to be using NVIDIA X driver.

Can Juju bootstrap and deploy to an EC2 cloud instance running Windows Server OS, or can Juju only boostrap/deploy to Linux instances?  I am experimenting with Juju for the first time and have installed Juju on a Ubuntu VM in VirtualBox on my local machine. I also have an EC2 Windows 2008 Server instance that I was trying to bootstrap Juju to without success.  It could be that I have a other config issues with the yaml preventing the bootstrap from working, but I first want to be sure that Juju can deploy to Windows environment before wasting more time trying to fix the bootstrap issues.\n\nA: Juju currently only deploys Ubuntu instances. On the client side, you can have an Ubuntu machine or an OSX machine. The client is Python so theoretically you can get it running on Windows, but I don't think anyone's tried that.\nEven then Juju doesn't really deploy on a working instance that you already have running, it provisions a totally new instance. So you don't need to create an ubuntu instance on EC2 in order to bootstrap and deploy, Juju does all that automatically when you issue a \"juju deploy\" command. \nI'll map this out for you by command, assuming your laptop or desktop is configured to use EC2:\njuju bootstrap\n\nThis fires off an instance in EC2 to get started. You don't manually go into the AWS console or fire up an instance or install Ubuntu or anything like that, you just need to wait for AWS/Juju to do all that for you (takes about 6 minutes).\njuju deploy mysql\n\nThis will fire off another EC2 instance; again, everything is automated, you're not launching anything ahead of time, as far as we're concerned you want mysql, so AWS/Juju will install Ubuntu server for you from the latest images (no need to specify AMI or anything), and then install and configure MySQL. \nThe idea behind Juju is to not have to do any of the manual things like hunting around for AMIs or going into the AWS console, you just ask what service you want and it'll snag the rest for you. \n", "Q: sudo apt-get remove unity Just what sort of problems would doing the above command lead to. I have installed kde desktop and would like a pure kde DE. I understand theres kubuntu but I've done so much with this one now that I'd be loathe to do it all again.\n\nA: It would remove the Unity desktop environment itself, so that when you log in, the Unity session option will no longer be available. If you will never use Unity, there should be no problem.\nBe aware that there are many dependencies of unity that may not automatically be removed. To save disk space, you could also uninstall them. When doing so, remember to check before hitting Enter to make sure that apt-get isn't trying to uninstall half your system.\nA few Unity-related things you probably should leave: libunity9 (many GNOME applications depend on this).\nAssuming you are already using the KDE login screen (which is separate from the default Ubuntu one), you can also remove unity-greeter.\n", "Q: Can't start unity from command line For learning purposes, I'm trying to start my GUI (unity) on Ubuntu 12.04 from the command line.\nI've changed quiet splash in /etc/default/grub to text and I successfully booted into the command line. I was able to start X11 and play around with some lightweight window managers like icewm-lite. Now I want to start the full unity desktop that's default with ubuntu 12.04, so I type unity in the command line and I get \nWARNING: no DISPLAY variable set, setting it to :0\ncompiz (core) - Fatal: Couldn't open display :0\nunity-panel-service: no process found\n\nand unity doesn't start. What am I doing wrong?\n\nA: The DISPLAY environment variable indicates X11 programs which X11 screen they should connect to. If you only start unity, it tries to connect to the \"default\" X11 screen, :0, which fails because there is no X11 server to accept such connections.\nYou'll want to start a full X11 session; you can install and use the startx command, which will start an X11 server and fire up processes with the associated DISPLAY environment variable.\nYou'll have to configure it to start unity by creating a .xinitrc in your home directory; for the simplest session, you can try the following contents:\n#!/bin/sh\nexec unity\n\n", "Q: Repairing grub 2 with Ubuntu live cd I installed Windows 7 on a separate hard drive and I have Debian on another hard drive. After installing Windows 7 my grub doesn't appear so I used an Ubuntu Live CD to use boot-repair to fix my grub2 installation. Everything went well but after I restart it boots directly into Windows 7 and no grub shows up.\nLike I said I have two hard drives one with Windows 7 (sda) and one with Debian (sdb). I installed grub2 on sdb following the boot-repair process but it doesn't work. Any ideas of what I should do.\nHere is my boot info.\n\nA: Go into BIOS setup and change boot order so that sdb drive comes first.\n\nA: I'd make this a comment, but it would be too long.  I'm not sure if it's going to be a solution, or simply a guess, but  here goes...\nI'm guessing that you have installed grub on sdb, but you are booting from sda.  When you install grub, there are two things you need to do:\n1.  Install something in the master boot record (MBR) of the drive that is set to boot by your BIOS.  This is sda on your system.  This disk's MBR apparently has only the windows boot loader, not grub.\n2.  Tell this boot loader where to find the grub menu file, normally in /boot/grub/grub.cfg of the last Linux partition installed.  Note that if the MBR code doesn't know where to look, it does not matter in the least what is in menu.lst, because it will never be seen.\nThe easiest way to fix the problem is to download and burn a live CD called Super Grub Disk.  You can find a lot of discussion on askubuntu, but it's pretty self-explanatory, I think.\nThe other way is use the command line, and run grub-install, telling it where to put the MBR code; you would need to mount the disk to do this, and run it from a live CD.  The command would be something like:  sudo grub-install --root-directory=/location of root directory /dev/sda  You would need to specify the correct location for the root directory of the distro for the grub.cfg file, unless it's run on the live system (I've never tried that, but it may be possible, though probably not recommended).  If you want to go this route, I'm sure you can find step-by-step instructions.\nOnce the MBR is set up, you can run sudo update-grub to update the menu file.\nYou may also be able to use the BIOS setting to choose which OS to boot, by picking either disk 1 or disk 2.  This should work, although I've found it to be problematic in the long run, because grub will eventually get installed on disk 1 by mistake.\n", "Q: How do I get my Xbox360 controller to work in Ubuntu 12.10? I'm trying to play The W​alking D​ead on Ubuntu 12.10 with my Xbox360 controller like I do in Windows. The thing is the game start and only lets my use the mouse and keyboard. In windows when the control is unplugged it start like that and when it's plugged in it's start in the Xbox360 mode (different bottons and so on).\nI tried installing the Xbox360 driver as shown here but the ppa is missing. \nI also tried installing Jtest and it recognizes the controller and all, but still I can't use it in the game.\n\nA: Your problem here isn't with Ubuntu or The W​alking Dead, it's with Wine. That's the compatibility layer you're using to be able to play a Windows game on a Linux operating system.\nI've already asked about this but unfortunately Wine just doesn't support joysticks in any meaningful at the moment. I'm sure there are some edge cases but there you go.\nThere is one workaround that I know of that may work for some things: Mapping the joystick into keyboard controls. It's messy as hell, and you lose the resolution of the sticks but for some things, this will be enough. You'll need to use xboxdrv for this, so blocking the built-in xpad module may be necessary.\nHere's an example:\nxboxdrv --trigger-as-button --ui-axismap x2=ABS_Z,y2=ABS_RZ --ui-buttonmap A=BTN_B,B=BTN_X,X=BTN_A,TR=BTN_THUMBL,TL=BTN_MODE,GUIDE=BTN_THUMBR \n\nI've lifted that almost verbatim from a thread on the xboxdrv forum.

I want to dual boot ubuntu 12.10 with Windows 7 on my laptop. I checked some online guides but each one does it differently. Some only create a  / (root) partition and a swap partition while others create a / (root) partition, a boot partition, a home partition and a swap partition. Which guide should I follow? Please help. And what size should I give every partition considering I am going to install Ubuntu on 200GB of my 500GB hard drive?\n\nA: I'd recommend having at least 4 primary partitions for a dual-booting computer: 1st for windows OS; 2nd for the Ubuntu file system (plus a logical partition to serve as a swap); a 3rd as a shared Data partition in NTFS to serve both operating systems -- vital for both security of data and to not have redundancies with my programs that sync massive amounts of data locally (Zotero, Dropbox, etc); and 4th as a /home/ folder for Ubuntu.\nHowever, you may have discovered that Windows takes more than one primary partition (it gobbled up 3 in my case, and I was able to reduce it to just 2), which means you may have to set up /home/ partition as a logical partition under the Ubuntu partition. When doing future re-installations of Ubuntu, just make sure to not erase the logical partition for home, and remember to mount it as /home. This can be done during the 'do something else' stage of installing Ubuntu when you specify under which partitions to install Ubuntu and mount-points.\n\nA: This depends a bit on how serious you're considering to be with Ubuntu, but in general your answer can be summarized as much:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"/\" - root point (general system), 20-40GB ext4\n\n*\n\n*The folders for applications, libraries and system configurations will reside here. These will live in their own folders, but basically everything except the folder \"/home\" will be stored on this partition. \n\n\n*\"/home\" - equivalent to \"Users\"-folder on Windows, available GB, minus space for swap, ext4\n\n*\n\n*This should be its own partition to live happily with your favourite content. This is where your movies, pictures and other things will live.\n\n\n*\"swap\" - equivalent to Windows' pagefile, depends on your RAM. swap\n\n*\n\n*Swap will be used when the system doesn't have any more physical memory available, or may be used for purposes of hibernating; sleep without the need for any power.\n\n\n\nGoing deeper in, unless you have very specific needs, you will not need any other mounting points to partitions other than the three above.\nHowever, as you'll be dualbooting with Windows you have to ask yourself whether or not you'll be seriously using Ubuntu. If you'll be using it every now and then, I recommend you just use your already existing data partition for Windows.\nOn the other hand, if you end up staying here... it'll be a good idea to have a proper \"/home\" - rather than just mounting your Windows-partition(s).\n", "Q: Where can I find more wallpaper packages?

I recently switched from Lubuntu to Xubuntu but I prefer Lubuntu's file manager, PCManFM, to Thunar, which is the default file manager in Xubuntu. So I installed PCManFM instead. Then I tried to uninstall Thunar via Synaptic but this process wants to uninstall other software as well, including \"xubuntu-desktop\".\n \nAny suggestions greatly appreciated.   \n\nA: Removing xubuntu-desktop will actually do little.\nxubuntu-desktop is only a metapackage.\nThis means that it has no files or code whatsoever, except for a control file that says it depends on thunar and other stuff, and possibly a bit of filler code. [Citation needed]. You can safely remove this package without losing anything, since all its installation did was pull in a ton of other packages, which actually make the Xubuntu interface work, that aren;t on the list of removals.\nThe reason it gets removed, is it \"depends\" on Thunar in order to get Thunar installed in a Xubuntu installation, so when Thunar is removed, xubuntu-desktop is als oremoved(without ill effect).\nWith that said, updates that add Xubuntu packages(uncommon) will go unnoticed, but updates on existing Xubuntu packages(common) will be performed.\n\nA: In Xubuntu 16.04 when removing thunar, besides the packages you show in your question, also the package xubuntu-core is removed, but even when you remove it \"nothing happens\" (I did it).\nSo it is safe to remove thunar and associate dependences in Xubuntu.\nHowever some thunar-related packages remain such as libthunarx-2-0 and thunar-data. The removing of such packages is discouraged, as they force the removing of package xfdesktop4, which has an important display function.\n", "Q: Simon Listens 4.0 build error When trying to install Simon Listens 4.0, I get this error message:\nsudo ./build_ubuntu.sh CMake  \nError at /usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindKDE4.cmake:98  \n(MESSAGE): ERROR: cmake/modules/FindKDE4Internal.cmake not found in /home/me/.kde/share/apps;/usr/share/kde4/apps  \nCall Stack (most recent call first): CMakeLists.txt:17 (find_package)\n\n-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!\n\nCould someone please tell me how to fix this.

As my computer says I have only around 200MB of disk space left but there is a separate partition that is almost empty. I've fiddled around with it a bit and this is what I'm presented with:\n\n\nA: Yes, you can verify that sda2 does not contain any data you need, then delete sda2 partition using gparted and expand sda1 to take up its space.\nTo be able to delete a partition you'll need to unmount it first (see the lock icon next to it?) - I believe the option to unmount is in the right-click menu.\nBecause you can't unmount your root partition while booted from it, you'll need to boot from another medium (LiveUSB) and launch gparted from there.\n", "Q: Wget Scheme Missing When I run Wget from terminal with command\nwget targetfile.php\n\nI got error \"Scheme Missing\".

I had to force restart it again, and now it only shows a blinking cursor. Choosing the recovery boot option hangs up at the exact same place you described.\nAfter some googling it seems like this is a common problem on Z580's recently, and it appears it has something to do with the UEFI boot.

Unfortunately, there is no solid solution yet.\nHope this info will help someone more knowledgeable to come up with a solution.\nUPDATE:\nI managed to solve this issue by booting into the previous Linux kernel 3.2.0-29-generic(the one that came with the 12.04 install disk). To boot using a previous kernel choose \"previous linux versions\" from the grub boot menu.I later noticed that the problem indeed occur after a kernel update to 3.2.0-35-generric.

I have been using ubuntu from a wubi installation for a year now and I really like it, so I'm considering installing it fresh on a new partition, rather than the ntfs windows one.\nI haven't done this again, so I'd like a few tips. Also, on my current install hibernate doesn't work, and I'd really love to have that feature working on my next install.\nSo here is what I'm planning to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*log on to windows and create a partition on my hard drive.\n\n*format above partition in an ubuntu friendly file system (should I\ngo for ext4 or xfs?)\n\n*log on to ubuntu and create a bootable usb drive with ubuntu\n\n*reboot and follow install instructions\n\n\nIs the above process ok? Am I missing something? Also, wht should I do to get hiberate to work as well?\n\nA: I just would like to point out that you should not create a partition in Windows (because of the wrong partition ID) and you should not format the partition in Windows. The most you  can do from Windows is to shrink the existing Windows partition to leave some un-partitioned space on the drive, however, this is not really necessary, because Ubuntu installer can do this for you. So, really, the steps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*create a bootable usb drive with Ubuntu, either from Windows or Ubuntu\n\n*reboot and follow install instructions (choosing \"install alongside existing OS\" or manual partitioning)\n\n\nTo make hibernate work, as a minimum, at install time you need to make sure you created a swap partition at least as large as your RAM. As I remember, hibernate has been disabled by default in recent releases of Ubuntu but it can be enabled after installation.\n\nA: The process you describe seems OK to me but you can speed it up a bit (or make it easier at least).\nFrom Windows you can do all of the following: Create empty space (so without formatting it), download the Ubuntu Live CD/DVD and burn it to a CD/DVD. This will take care of point 1 and 3 without the need of switching OS. \nPut the disc in your system, reboot, switch to BIOS to check for 'boot from CD' if you are not sure it already does. \nAnd then follow the Ubuntu installation instructions to install (point 4) in the empty space you created. This will also take care of point 2 so there is not need to pre-format the partition.\n\nA: Sometimes you may need to go into your bios and tell it to boot into the drive with your install stuff on it if it doesn't happen automatically. Do this by restarting your computer and hitting some variation of an F key : eg mine is F12, I think, I always forget and just press them all until I get into the bios to be honest.\nFrom the bios you just select the hard drive you want to boot into as the most important one (remember to change it back after the install, if needed)   \nIf that did not work then I would say it was because you did not format it properly \nI use FAT. That said, I just install from a usb key using unetbootin (still, I can't see it being a different process once the formatting is done). Formatting a usb is pretty straight forward if you are happy to wipe it clean so you may want to consider that option if you are not sure how to go about things. I have also found it to be useful to keep a loaded usb key handy for when something goes horribly wrong. I can easily to boot into a trial of 'ubuntu to recover my files before having to wipe the system clean and start again afterwards without losing any sweat. \n", "Q: Diskless Workstations I want to run diskless booting with PXE.\nThe gotchas at the end of the Diskless-Howto[1] is quite long.\nI am unsure how to get this done.

I was recently given an Apple iPad and its software restrictions limit what I can do with it (installing software from other sources, customization, file explorer, etc).

As most apps are created for other operating systems, I would appreciate a software recommendation.\nI run Ubuntu 12.10 and own a first generation Apple iPad with iOS 5.1.1.\n\nA: To jailbreak your iPad, you need a special software on your Ubuntu computer and your USB cable. My advice is to use a program that worked for me, Absinthe.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the correct version on GreenPois0n (don't be impressed by the name or the skull logo), depending on your iOS version. In your case of iOS 5.1.1, choose Absinthe 2.0.4. From personal experience, I know that you should not compulsorily choose the all newest version ; just stick with the version that was designed for your iOS version.\n\n*Extract the archive you downloaded, launch the app called \"absinthe\". Choose \"Run\" if Ubuntu prompts you with a pop-up window.\n\n*Follow the displayed instructions.\n\n\nGood luck !\nFor more information about jailbreaking devices from Apple, see for instance iDownload Blog.

I want several Linux distros to share the same home/data partition, each having a unique user name and implicitly a separate home directory.\nI installed Debian Wheezy, and formatted this partition as btrfs. \nBut then, when I install Ubuntu 13.04 and select that partition as /home it creates a new directory, @home, in which it puts another folder with the user name.\nWhy does this happen?    \n\nA: I'm guessing Ubuntu always wants to use subvolumes, if you use btrfs for the root partition you will automatically get two subvolumes, \"@/\" and \"@home/\" (see the Ubuntu wiki btrfs entry for more info on this), and it might set up the \"@home/\" subvolume just for the sake of consistency.\nOn a side note: If you look in /etc/fstab you should see the option \"subvol=@home\" for the /home mountpoint, which means that it mounts the \"@home/\" subvolume of that btrfs (subvolumes are quite similar to directories in some sense).\n\nAnswer to comment:\nYes, you can mount the top node and the subvolume node simultaneously:\nmount /dev/sdX# /mnt/top_node -o subvolid=5\nmount /dev/sdX# /mnt/home_subvol -o subvol=@home\n\n(If the top node is the default mount point (default case) you can omit the \"-o subvolid=5\" option)\nHere the @home/ subvolume will be accessible both through /mnt/top_node/@home/ and /mnt/home_subvol/ equivalently.\nIt might be worth it to have the two dirs there alongside @home/ be subvolumes instead, that way you could snapshot and mount them all independently...\n\nA: I really hope this helps others who went down my path. I installed my root partition to btrfs. After booting it appeared to hang after scanning for btrfs partitions …something about system v compatibility. Someone in another thread said do a \"soft shutdown\" which worked for a second. Then I tried to turn on compression in the /etc/fstab file with compress=lzo. Unfortunately I put a space between theses settings here: \ndefaults,compress=lzo\n\nThis leads to booting the system but not having a home directory when Ctrl+Alt+F4 and logging in.

I'm asking because I find Unity to be slow on aged hardware which according to the system requirements should work fine (2.53 GHz Celeron, 2 GB RAM). So I want the support of the Ubuntu main release (LTS in my case) but have a more responsive UI using another DE, say Cinnamon or XFCE.\n\nA: If you install XFCE, your system should be reasonably faster. Even faster if you use LXDE.\nI cannot vouch for Cinnamon which I do not have experience with.\nIt won't be the same thing as using Xubuntu (which uses XFCE) or Lubuntu (LXDE) because Xubuntu and Lubuntu have different packages installed to optimise performance. For example, Xubuntu comes with Thunar file manager instead of Nautilus. Lubuntu contains leafpad as text editor instead of Gedit. Ubuntu and Xubuntu have Thunderbird as mail program while Lubuntu has sylpheed.\nThis said you should notice a significant improvement on performance because the DE is one of the most resource hungry components of a distribution.\nNote that Lubuntu is not available as LTS whereas Xubuntu 12.04 is supported for three years.\n", "Q: Can't see WiFi SSID I have installed 12.04.1 on Dell Latitude E6510\nAt work I could able connect to WiFi and it is OK\nAt home I use DSL WiFi modem router which works fine and I can connect thru Windows, Android phone etc. But Ubuntu doesn't even see SSID name.

I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 x64, kernel 3.2.0-24-generic with an NVidia GTX460 and an Achieva Shimian QH270-Lite 2560 x 1440 monitor connected by a dual-link DVI cable. \nI've installed the nvidia-current 313-09 drivers from xorg-edgers (and tried the 310-19 from NVidia). Neither of these drivers read the EDID information from my monitor (/var/log/Xorg.0.log) and default to lower resolutions which my monitor will not display, resulting in a black screen. Full story here\nIf I replace the high-res monitor with a lower resolution 1600 x 900 monitor it works fine. \nHow can I force my video card to the resolution I need? Btw the xorg.conf configuration file is deprecated.\n\nA: I finally found a solution - an Edid for my Shimian QH270-Lite here thanks to someone who had the same problem with another Korean 2560x1440 monitor, the Yamakasi Catleap.\nI installed the new Edid following instructions posted at ubuntuforums.org, thread 1857772 - sorry I can't post more than two links:\nCreate an NVidia xconf file with the new edid:\n$ sudo nvidia-xconfig --custom-edid=/etc/X11/Shimian_edid.bin\n\nCheck your Xorg log for Display Device Name - probably DFP-0, or DFP-1:\ncat /var/log/Xorg.0.log | grep connected\n\nwhich should bring up something like:\n\n(--) NVIDIA(0):   *Your_monitor's_name* (DFP-0) (connected)\n  in which case your Display Device Name is DFP-0\n\nCheck and if necessary correct xconf:\n    sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf\nLook for a line like:\n\n\nOption   \"CustomEDID\" \"/etc/X11/Shimian_edid.bin\"\n\n\nand edit it to read:\n\n\nOption   \"CustomEDID\" \"DFP-0:/etc/X11/Shimian_edid.bin\"\n\n\nReboot and at last the monitor works at 2560x1440 as intended. \nIf that hadn't worked, Plan B was to build a custom configuration following NVidia's Xconfig options (in the README file for the 310.19 Linux driver from NVidia's downloads), in particular the \"CustomEDID\" option.\nThanks to the contributors to the links above and hopefully this will help someone else with the same problem.\n", "Q: Change / Choose install path for a .deb I would like to know if it is possible to choose where a .deb file will be installed, or if it is possible to move it after the installation to another directory without troubles for the app.\nI am asking that because I am running Ubuntu on a 32Go's SSD, and I would like to install some games from Humble Bundle on my other HDD.\n\nA: There is a similar Q&A at superuser.com dealing with that question. A more specific question was asked also here at askubuntu.com.\nYour choices are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use symlinks. Open the *.deb package with the archive manager. This tells you where the files go. Move those directories to your external harddisc and put a symlink at the origin. Be careful to move only directories from your games and not shared libraries or so!\n\n*Mount your external hardrive or some of its folders (a second time) at the game's path. E.g. /usr/share/games might be good candidate for your external harddisc. You can use the bind option, e.g.:\nsudo mount --bind /media/external-hardisc/usr-share-games /usr/share/games\n\n*Don't use a *.deb package, but install directly from source to a directory of your choice.\n\n*Use the dpkg parameter --root to change the install location. The man page says:\n--root=dir\n      Changing   root  changes  instdir  to  dir  and  admindir  to\n      dir/var/lib/dpkg.\nThere is no guarantee that this will work. The program might not be able to deal with the different location.\n(This list of solutions is not exhaustive.)\n\nA: As I know extracted files like libraries and executables must be extracted into fixed directories that use these files during program execution. Also I think this debs contains large resources and lightweight files separately. For example many games unpack their resources to /opt directory. You can mount your HDD as /opt that store resources there:\nHere is example:\nsudo mv /opt /media/your_hdd/opt\nsudo mkdir /opt\n\nAnd check mount:\nsudo mount --bind /media/your_hdd/opt /opt\n\nif this works add mount --bind /media/your_hdd/opt /opt to /etc/rc.local before exit 0 to auto mount after each system boot.\n", "Q: Can I install the ordinary php and php-cli on the same machine?

I want to first install the ordinary php5 package and then php5-cli.\nAre there likely to be any conflicts if I do this:\nsudo apt-get install php5\n\nfollowed by this:\nsudo apt-get install php5-cli\n\n\nA: No, there should be no problems at all. If there are, they are unexpected bugs. In fact, you can install both at once:\nsudo apt-get install php5 php5-cli\n\nIn general, Debian maintainers (and downstream, Ubuntu maintainers) work hard to make sure packages work well with each other. If they do not, they are marked as being in conflict with each other, and apt-get will not let you install both.\n\nA: If you plan to use php 5.4 and the interactive cli (php -a), don't forget to add the php5-readline package as well.\n", "Q: Can I install ubuntu on Sony Viao?

Let's say I have a problem with my wireless connection. What commands should I run to share their output with a tech-savvy friend or an online support community?\nFor example:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I tell if my wireless card is recognised?\n\n*How can I get information on which wireless networks are within range?\n\n*How can I tell if I am connected to a wireless, but not the Internet?\n\n\n\nI'm asking this question because I'm seeing many questions about problems with wireless connections, without many details, like this one. It would be useful if I could point to this question so that the asker can improve their question with more information. I'm hoping for a comprehensive answer with all the details, or with links to other generic questions for brevity.\n\nA: To check if the card is recognized, run:\nsudo lshw -C network\n\nor\nlspci -nnk | grep -iA2 net\n\nThe second command is useful, as it shows the vendor and product IDs [8086:4222]:\n~$ lspci -nnk | grep -iA2 net\n06:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 3945ABG [Golan] Network Connection [8086:4222] (rev 02)\n    Subsystem: Hewlett-Packard Company PRO/Wireless 3945ABG [Golan] Network Connection [103c:135c]\n    Kernel driver in use: iwl3945\n    Kernel modules: iwl3945\n\nExample - card recognized, brand and model are correctly identified, correct driver is in use (driver=iwl3945), and wireless connection is established (ip=192.168.2.81):\nsudo lshw -C network\n[sudo] password for hp: \n  *-network               \n       description: Wireless interface\n       product: PRO/Wireless 3945ABG [Golan] Network Connection\n       vendor: Intel Corporation\n       physical id: 0\n       bus info: pci@0000:06:00.0\n       logical name: wlan0\n       version: 02\n       serial: 00:13:02:c8:d2:75\n       width: 32 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: pm msi pciexpress bus_master cap_list ethernet physical wireless\n       configuration: broadcast=yes driver=iwl3945 driverversion=3.2.0-35-generic firmware=15.32.2.9 ip=192.168.2.81 latency=0 link=yes multicast=yes wireless=IEEE 802.11abg\n       resources: irq:45 memory:80000000-80000fff\n\nTo make sure you are connected to a wireless, but not an ethernet network, first identify the wireless interface (usually wlan0, eth1 or eth2) by looking at the output of sudo lshw -C network. Then, look for an IP address to tell which interface is connected.\n\nA: The ability to experiment rapidly is the best approach for a quick diagnosis.\nTwo diagnostic tools I find invaluable to pinpoint the root cause in cases where the WiFi works, but is unreliable, e.g. intermittently losing the connection, sessions hanging, web-pages freezing are iwlist and mtr.\nHere's how to use iwlist and mtr effectively:\n1) Is the low-level wireless reception/transmission healthy?\nwatch sudo iwlist wlan0 scan\n\nThis gives a treasure trove of information about the strongest wireless signals detected by your card.  I find the Channel, Frequency, ESSID, Quality, and Signal level, the most useful.\nIf you have no signal, or your ESSID isn't recognized, you need to focus on the low-level (hardware/drivers): Is the router on? Are antennas oriented optimally? Is device too far away from the router? Do you have the right driver for your wifi card? (for that you may want to check the system logs)\nAssuming the ESSID is known and the quality is good (say about 30%-100% of the maximum) you may move to the second, higher level, stage:\n2) Once a WiFi connection is established, is the connection stable?\nSince TCP/IP supports error-detection with retransmits, and congestion control, WiFi disconnects/reconnects are usually a result of a large number of errors to the point where TCP gives-up.  Rather than waiting for a full disconnect, which may happen only once in several minutes, I run mtr in a separate window and continuously watch the Loss% (packet percent loss) and Avg (average round-trip time in milliseconds) columns:\nmtr <hostname>\n\nWhile looking at this screen, I can immediately see not just whether there's some ongoing transmission/reception problem, but also which link along the way is the most problematic/slow one, in case there's more than one hop between me and the target <hostname>.\n(If you don't have mtr installed, you may install it using: sudo apt-get install mtr)\nI find these two tools particularly valuable because they provide a continuous state of the WiFi connection. I can quickly change configuration and immediately see the effect of my change on the network. Some examples of experiments you may do while looking at the above described screens are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit /etc/network/interfaces and then ifdown wlan0 && ifup wlan0\n\n*Reload drivers: modprobe <name_of_device_driver>...\n\n*Restart the network: service networking restart\n\n*Reorient the WiFi card antenna\n\n*Change the wireless iterface MTU: e.g. ifconfig wlan0 mtu 1472\n\n*Disable the card power-saving ability\n\n*Adjust your access point transmission power, preferred channel number, bandwidth, ... in the router UI.\n\n*If you use a repeater (aka range-extender), turn it off, wait, turn it on again\n\n\nAs there are so many knobs you can turn and experiment with, the most critical thing, is to be able to see the immediate effect of any change on the continuously updating screens.  If it makes no difference (most cases, in my experience), just note it down, and revert to the previous state. But if you suddenly see the Loss% rates jump up in mtr, or the signal strength sharply drop (or conversely, jump way up) in iwlist, you know you've found a smoking gun (or the fix).\nAgain, the #1 take-away from all of this is: Rapid experimentation is the key to be able to quickly diagnose WiFi issues\n", "Q: installing ubuntu on windows 8 \nPossible Duplicate:\nInstalling Ubuntu on a Pre-Installed UEFI Supported Windows 8 system \n\nI have a windows 8 preloaded computer(an Acer aspire m touch) and no luck with the shift+restart method does not bring up ufei settings.

One day I installed Ubuntu 12.04 64bit on my machine, but it is not useful for me. So I uninstalled Ubuntu and now I'm unable to boot from my recovery partition & Win7 64bit. \nHow can I regain my system to factory settings?\n\nA: There are some third-party utilities that will repair the Windows boot-loader. One that I found useful and easy was EasyBCD, but that was years ago.\n\nA: I had the same problem yesterday (I had formatted the Ubuntu partition which turned out to have had contained the Grub settings) and made it work again this way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run the Windows install DVD\n\n*Go to system restore options (I don't exactly remember what it is called) and choose command prompt from the list.\n\n*Execute the following command (replace [DRIVE] with drive letter):\nbootsect /nt60 [DRIVE]: /mbr\n\nMaybe it also works if you use \"SYS\" instead of a drive letter, I don't know.\nThis solved it for me, good luck.\nEdit: Did some research on Google.

Ubuntu uses 3.2.0-29, openSUSE uses 3.5.x, Debian uses x.x.x... Is there a major difference? Does this make a distro better then other, I mean, a \"newer\" kernel(which I think it is)? \n\nA: You can find a summary of the differences introduced in each new kernel here.\nIn general, newer kernel versions add more features and fix bugs, but the differences for the end user between minor versions are unlikely to be noticeable, unless support was added for a specific piece of hardware you use.\nA new minor version of the kernel is released every 2-3 months, and given the wide variety of hardware supported the majority of changes made to each version probably do not affect your specific configuration.\nIn common with other distributions, the kernel shipped with Ubuntu is slightly modified from the \"mainline\" version, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/FAQ/UbuntuDelta if you're interested in the gory details.\nNote that Ubuntu 12.10 Quantal uses kernel version 3.5.0.\n", "Q: Can't adjust brightness i find a answer but its say a error I can't adjust the contrast on my laptop dell and I found this on this site:\n\nOpen the terminal Ctrl+Alt+T and type:\nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nChange the line:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\"\n\ninto\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"acpi_osi=Linux\"\n\nSave and exit the file.\nNow in the terminal type:\nsudo update-grub\n\nRestart your Linux.\n\nBut when I type sudo update-grub it says:  \n/usr/sbin/grub-mkconfig: 35: /etc/default/grub: Syntax error: Unterminated quoted string\n\n\nA: I think you are missing a closing double quote in that line. Please check for that.\nIf not, this well-written page should help you out. While it is written for HP, the procedure should work for any laptops. It is a common procedure for linux kernel.\n", "Q: ubuntu 12.10 - no grub selection after install a new kernel I am using Ubuntu 12.10. I compiled myself a new kernel and installed it. After installing, I updated grub. The problem happens here. When my computer reboots, it doesn't show me the GRUB Screen to choose old/new kernel or windows 7(the screen is black). It starts with new kernel only. How can I fix this? My pc has a graphic card: ASUS - Geforce GT430.\n\nA: I don't know anything about compiling kernels, but it seems to me that Grub is set to be on hidden timeout. You should check the file /etc/default/grub, e.g. by opening your editor:\nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nand see if these lines look the same as yours:\nGRUB_DEFAULT=0\n#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=10\nGRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\"\n\nThe lines concerning GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT and GRUB_TIMEOUT should be the same. In case they are not, change them accordingly. The # before GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0 makes sure hidden timeout isn't used and GRUB_TIMEOUT=10 means you get a 10 second delay before Grub boots to its default entry. \nAfter you made changes to the Grub file and saved it, you have run:\nsudo update-grub\n\nTo make sure the changes are applied. When you do this you should get the Grub menu back so you'll be able to choose the kernel or OS you want to boot again.\n\nA: Try to change the GRUB_TIMEOUT value in order to force the grub menu :\nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub \n\nAnd change\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=0\n\nto\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=5\n\nSave and re-run update-grub\n\nA: after i did all these steps i found this in the terminal \ngrub-mkconfig: You must run this as root\n\nand that was all my actions \nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo gedit /etc/default/grub \nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ update-grub\ngrub-mkconfig: You must run this as root\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo gedit /etc/default/grub \nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo update-grub \n/usr/sbin/grub-probe: error: failed to get canonical path of /cow.\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ ^C\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo update-grub \n/usr/sbin/grub-probe: error: failed to get canonical path of /cow.\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo gedit /etc/default/grub\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ update-grub\ngrub-mkconfig: You must run this as root\n\n\nA: The other thread's solution mentioned did not exactly match this users question but I did find the solution there.\nThis solved the problem for me:\nRun: sudo update-grub\nIn my case, this found the new kernel but did not write out the menu.lst file. I'm fairly certain this is becuase I selected the \"do not update\" option when installing the new kernel and grub was not allowed to update the file even when i do my update-grub.\nTo solve that I moved my /boot/grub/menu.lst to /boot/grub/menu.lst.old (just to be save), then ran sudo update-grub again which wrote the file and reflects the new kernel version I'd just installed.\nHope this helps...\n", "Q: Ubuntu on nvidia tegra 2 (motorola xoom 3g)? Can I flash Nexus 7 image of Ubuntu 13.04 on Motorola Xoom? Both devices have nearly same hardware except the processor and screen and also the 3G. \n\nA: If the architecture of the chips turns out to be similar enough to run the same build then the follow up questions would be if the build can support the other chips that are different from the Nexus to the Xoom and not leave a xoom essentially bricked for the effort in one way or another. I will try and find a list of chips such as wifi and such in the specs of each.\n\nA: I know the architecture between tegra 3 and 2 are different enough that the android 4.2 gesture keyboard does not work on tegra 2 at all, and it does on tegra 3. That is just one example of a known incompatibility. I'm sure there are plenty more, especially in the drivers. Personally, I wouldn't even try it. But if you really want to try it out, just make sure you do a full backup, because I really don't think it will work.

A Huawei P9 lite original cable was the one that finally made the connection.\n\nA: Make sure to turn off the Airplane Mode on your kindle. For me, this solved it, but it took me a while to realize that it was on.\nThere can many reasons why one could have a problem with the USB connection, and this is one of them. Apparently, the airplane mode also disables USB, and not only network connection.\n\nA: You should just be able to install calibre sudo apt-get install calibre, and manage your Kindle Paperwhite. I don't have a new-ish kindle to test with, but that method has worked with the older kindles, and I don't think they changed it much.\n", "Q: \"QtQuick version 2.0 is not installed\" while trying to run CurrencyConverter Example for Ubuntu Phone I was following the step-by-step guide on how to develop an Ubuntu Phone application but Qt Creator throughs the error message (module \"QtQuick\" version 2.0 is not installed) when I run it with QMLscene. Seems to me that Qt Creator utilizes Qt4 instead of Qt5. How can I fix this?\n\nA: You are using qmlviewer when you should be using qmlscene. Quote from the tutorial:\nTo start QML applications, either during the prototyping or final stages, you will use QML Scene. QML Scene is a command-line application that interprets and runs QML code.\n...\nHere's a tip: although Qt Creator does not yet support qmlscene as QML viewer, you can invoke it from within the IDE. Here’s how:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Qt Creator, go to Tools > Options…\n\n*Choose the External Tools tab, then in the pane select the Preview (qmlviewer) entry\n\n*On the Executable: field on the right, replace the contents with /opt/qt5/bin/qmlscene.\n\n*Optionally change the command name by double-clicking on the Preview (qmlviewer) entry from above. You can call it Preview (qmlscene).\n\n*Click on OK to save the changes.\n\n\nYou can also run QML Scene from the command line:\n$ qmlscene /path/to/application.qml\n\n\nA: Hi~ I had the same problem like yours that Qt Creator throughs the error message   \n(module \"QtQuick\" version 2.0 is not installed).   \nAnd I was also following the step-by-step guide just like you. \nFinally I have fixed it now.  this image shows that you have something wrong in configuration the qmlscene. I also had configured the qmlscene, but it had the same error like you had done.  \nFinally I found that when I configured the path of qmlscene , I had typed a backspace before the \"/opt/qt5/bin/qmlscene\" . So it didn't work. I just want to tell you what I've done to cause this error.  :)\n\nA: You will also have to change the default qmlviewer:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Qt Creator go to: Tools -> Options -> Environment\n\n*Choose the External Tools tab, then in the panel select the Preview (qmlviewer) entry\n\n*On the Executable: field on the right, replace the contents with /opt/qt5/bin/qmlscene or /usr/bin/qmlscene (in Ubuntu 12.10).\n\n", "Q: How to setup a RAID Install with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS? I have one pc that has two 120GB hard drives in it. There is currently no operating system installed in my PC. I want to install Ubuntu so it will see and use both hard drives for booting and storage as though they were one. I have looked through the FAQ & blogs and the only one that gets close is the Raid setup, however this version of Ubuntu does not list raid as an option.\nI only want Ubuntu on these hard drives, how do I go about doing this?\n\nA: You need to use an Alternate 12.04.1 ISO for RAID setup - 32bit, 64bit.\nFor a complete walk-through, please see the Wiki page.\n\nA: \nuse both hard drives for booting and storage as though they were one\n\nTo do so, you'll have to check on your computer if the RAID 0 is possible. The easiest way is to give your motherboard information.\nFYI : RAID 0 will show only one logical partition as 240Gb but you won't have any backup partition. RAID 1 will show only 120Gb but with redundancy (if one of your HDD burns, your system will still work the time you change the failing HDD)\n\nA: Probably you are installing the \"Ubuntu Desktop\" edition, it miss the RAID options.\nI suggest to install the \"Ubuntu Server\" edition and follow the Advanced Installation guide.\nThen you can update the Server edition to the Desktop edition run this:\n# apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\n", "Q: Gnome3 Terminal restores previous window size on focus loss Sometimes when I resize a window in gnome 3 and then switch tasks, the window snaps back to it's previous size. How can I make it retain the size that I change it to?\nFor instance, if I drag at the sides of a terminal window to make it a new size it will resize, however when I click on any other window the size of the terminal will shrink back to exactly the same size it was before I resized it.\nIt might only be the terminal window that does this. Other windows I have seem retain their size.\n\nA: This is apparently a bug.\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-terminal/+bug/1040885\nThey mentioned a workaround, select the first tab and resize. Apparently this only happens when the first tab isn't selected. \n\nA: Usual user settings for a Terminal window sizing based on the rows and columns.\nNot a pixel size. So you need change Profile Preferences.  \nEdit > Profile Preferences > General > Default Size ( columns / rows ) \nOr to maintain different window sizes for Terminal you can create new profiles for each:  \nEdit > Profiles > New\nName your new profile and tune it.\nLater you can switch them Terminal > Change Profile \nAlso window sizing templates already exist in menu Terminal\nUpdate:\nHowever, also look this Q/A:\nSetting gnome-terminal window size from within ~/.bashrc \nit means that ~/.bashrc configuration can override columns/rows size.\n", "Q: Problems while using 'quickly create' on ubuntu.

I was trying to play The Walking Dead Game with my Xbox360 controller and it didn't work, in this same site a helpful user told me it was a wine problem and not the driver or the game. So, I tried using the controller in Team Fortress2 for Ubuntu Steam, it detects the controller and all, but right stick (the one for aiming) only moves horizontaly, and not vertically.\nI tried a software called \"jstest-gtk\" and it confirmed the problem, the right stick doesn't move in the correct axis like the left one. In the game it only moves horizontally but in the software it only moves vertically. When I move the stick vertickally, the pointer in jstest only moves a little, also vertically. When I move the stick horizontally, the pointer in jstest moves a lot, also vertically (as you can see in the video). I thick that is the problem. The left stick moves perfect.\nI know it's very difficult to explain in words so I uploaded this video to Youtube. I hope it help to figure out what the problem is. I only know the game is not the problem, because it shows the same pattern of the right-stick as jstest-gtk, and that the controller isn't either, because it work perfectly on Windows.\n\nA: Hopefully you've found the answer by now, but if not...\nusing jstest-gtk you need to hit the mapping tool and move ABS_Z to right above ABS_RZ. \nTo get this to set itself when you plug it in:\nsudo jscal-store /dev/input/js0 \n(replace js0 with your joystick, you can see which it is in jstest-gtk)\n\nyou'll need the joystick package installed for this.\n", "Q: Why do I only hear sound from the speakers with A2DP headset connected? I have a Sennheiser MM100 bluetooth stereo headset (using A2DP) I'd like to use on my Lubuntu machine. The headset works fine with my phone.\nPlease note that unlike all other Ubuntu flavours, Lubuntu does not come with Pulseaudio.\nIt is detected by Lubuntu's Blueman Bluetooth configuration application and I can establish a connection successfully. It also appears to actually communicate as it shows data being sent back and forth. However, Sound keeps coming out of the loudspeakers only, while the headset remains silent. I would have expected the sound to come from my headset at this point.\nWhere do I start troubleshooting here?\n\nA: Note about the answer here - It appears that Lubuntu comes without Pulseaudio and I assumed Pulse is needed for A2DP to work and that OP would have installed it. It appears not to be the case. The answer below is about a Pulseaudio installation.\n\nMake sure you've selected the right output sink for the application you're expecting sound from.\nSimilar to my answer in a similar question, start by installing and starting pavucontrol and check:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the Output Devices tab\n\n\n*\n\n*Check the presence of your Bluetooth device. I assume it's listed there stating you see it in another application.\n\n*Check the obvious settings for that entry.\n\n\n*In the Configuration tab\n\n\n*\n\n*Check the audio profile. Make sure you've selected A2DP rather than 'headset' or 'off' (unless you want to, really).\n\n\n*In the Playback tab the application producing sound should be listed.\n\n\n*\n\n*Try to see what output sink is selected and verify it is using your Bluetooth connection.\n\n*Check the output volume and mute status of this particular audio stream.\n\n\n\nA: EDIT: So I finally got this working:\n1) To make Pulse Audio support A2DP, this package needs to be installed:\npulseaudio-module-bluetooth. But after that it's still not easy to make it work:\n2) Gnome Bluetooth applet vs. Blueman:\n- I have not been able to make this work reliably with Blueman, but I found that it does with GNOME BLUETOOTH APPLET. I came across this solution when I decided to use Gnome Shell (3.4 at first) on my Lubuntu, which of course came with the Gnome Bluetooth applet (package name: gnome-bluetooth: If you decide to install it  without the Gnome Shell, note that it will pull some gnome libraries it needs to work).\n- I removed the troublesome Blueman and paired the devices via the Gnome applet, which led to successfully streaming A2DP, Pulseaudio via Bluetooth. For this to work, BLUEMAN HAS TO BE REMOVED, else it will take control of managing all bluetooth connections. When I upgraded my Lubuntu installation from 12.04 to 13.04, Blueman was reinstalled and did just that, and things started working again after I removed it.\n3) After installing it (I did via Synaptic) I restarted PA\npulseaudio --kill\npulseaudio --start\n\nbut that may be unnecessary, try it in case you experience problems at first.\n4) To make the connection with the Sennheiser headset, I need to put it in PAIRING MODE by turning it on  and holding down the on/off button for a bit longer, till the LED flashes red and blue (as opposed to connection mode - rapid blue flashing - that would usually suffice for connecting the headset to a host device that already knows it: that doesn't work). Then, in Gnome applet (it should remember the headset after first pairing), click the \"connect\" button for the Sennheiser M100 .\n5) You may have to go into Audio Settings and select the M100 as output device, but I get audio through the headset and not the speakers even if the system soundcard is still selected.\nHope this works for you, too, but still: When you buy bluetooth hardware for use with your Ubuntu (or derivative) system, try and find something with explicit Linux support, preferably open drivers!\n\nA: I made it work the following way :\nBefore going further :\n\n\n*\n\n*Update your system (I'm running 13.10) \n\n*Remove blueman\n\n*Install pulseaudio-module-bluetooth, pavucontrol (Utility to set up\npulseaudio) and make sure bluez is installed\n\n*Remove any \"Disable=Socket\" or \"Enable=Socket\" entry in file /etc/bluetooth/audio.conf\n(edit with sudo)\n\n\nSteps : \n\n\n*\n\n*Put device in pairing mode (even if already paired)\n\n*Pair the device with your system using default bluetooth manager (blueman should have been removed) or if already paired go to step 3\n\n*Select A2DP or Audio Sink connection for the paired device. \nIf it fails try \"sudo hciconfig hci0 reset\" (where hci0 is your bluetooth device) check scan is ok with hcitool scan then retry this step (do hciconfig -piscan to identify your bluetooth device)\n\n*With pavutools, select a2dp in \"configuration\" tab and your device in \"Playback\" tab / If a2dp is not selected, try \"pactl list cards short\" to get your device id (1,2,3..) then do \"pactl set-card-profile X a2dp\" where X is your device id\n\n*If it fails, restart avahi-daemon / bluetooth service and reset device through hciconfig hci0 reset. Check if scan is ok with hcitool scan. Then do steps 3 and 4\n\n\nA: I had the same problem on Lubuntu 14.04. \nIn fact I had troubles on my Ubuntu 14.04 and XFCE and there decided to surrender to GNOME again. The GNOME bluetooth manager I also find more stable and user friendly then the description given below. But the lightness of Lubuntu is also due to the amazing job they did with LXDE, and there I didn't dare clogging the system with another (non native) desktop manager.\nHere is what I found to fix the problem. My answer is mainly derived from this fix for mint\n\n\n*\n\n*install pulseaudio and a couple of extra components: \n\nsudo apt-get install pulseaudio pulseaudio-module-bluetooth bluez\n\n\n*sudo gedit /etc/bluetooth/audio.conf and uncomment the following lines\n\n HFP=false   \n [A2DP] \n SBCSource=1\n MPEG12Source=0\n\n\n\n*pactl load-module module-bluetooth-discover\nDone.\nAs other suggested, you might indeed want to install pavucontrol to select the A2DP output easily. It also helps managing audio in a more natural way than alsa with the primitive alsa mixer.\n", "Q: Problems Booting Windows 8 with Grub 2 HELP ASAP please help.

I will soon be starting an application support job and when I asked my soon-to-be line manager, \"what should I get to grips with before I start?\", He specifically stated that I should learn \"the principles and some general knowledge of Linux/Ubuntu\". I believe that the best way to do this is to start using Ubuntu and follow online tutorials.\nI am currently running windows 7 and was about to install ubuntu through a virtual box. While experiencing some problems with the install I came across the windows installer. I am  a total beginner when it comes to Ubuntu but considering how much easier it seems to be to use the windows installer, is it really a better alternative to using virtual box (or something similar)?\nThanks\n\nA: (Not only) for the purpose of \"getting your feet wet\" using a virtual machine is perfectly fine. Additional benefit: you can use snapshots to undo things you tried. I definitely recommend that approach.\n", "Q: Ways to get help in Ubuntu for beginners (Offline) I was asked this today and got me wondering of the different ways a user could get help while using Ubuntu. The particular case I was asked was, how to get help about Ubuntu in Ubuntu if there is no Internet connection available. \nIf it were not for that, I would had said AskUbuntu and the Ubuntu forums first, followed by IRC. But since it is offline it would be good to know, all the ways a user can get help about using Ubuntu without having any online connection. Particularly when using commands, how to navigate in Ubuntu, how to use Ubuntu and get to know it. This are common questions for some students that have started with me which are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Students that have NEVER used a computer (60+ Year old students I should mention). The plus side is that they know how a typewriter works.\n\n*Students that have never used Ubuntu before but are Windows users.\nBoth cases they want to learn how to use Ubuntu in a offline way, using only what help Ubuntu comes with. Of course they can also install any help packages needed before going offline forever, so installing a package not found in the default Ubuntu setup is not a problem.\nThe question should be treated as using the Latest official version of Ubuntu\nSimilar to https://askubuntu.com/questions/51566/what-is-the-best-place-for-learning-how-to-use-ubuntu but oriented toward offline usage.\n\nA: On 12.10, you can search the dash lens for the word help and by selecting the result it will open up a useful, offline help menu displayed in yelp.

Why? Simplicity.\n\nA: This was mentioned in the post you linked to, but think it is worthy of a mention here. The ubuntu manual project:\nhttp://ubuntu-manual.org/\n\nAbout the manual\nGetting Started with Ubuntu 12.10 is a comprehensive beginners guide\n  for the Ubuntu operating system. It is written under an open source\n  license and is free for you to download, read, modify and share. The\n  manual will help you become familiar with everyday tasks such as\n  surfing the web, listening to music and scanning documents. With an\n  emphasis on easy to follow instructions, it is suitable for all levels\n  of experience.\n\nhttp://ubuntu-manual.org/about\n\nAbout\nOur project is an open source volunteer effort to create and maintain\n  quality documentation for Ubuntu and its derivatives. We were founded\n  in 2009 by Benjamin Humphrey, who saw the need for targeted up-to-date\n  and consistent documentation for the Ubuntu operating system. It\n  didn’t take long until the project amassed hundreds of contributors,\n  and what Benjamin originally envisioned became a reality as the Ubuntu\n  Manual Project blossomed into an ambitious and successful project. We\n  have a strong emphasis on just \"getting things done\" and therefore we\n  have a fast-paced development environment filled with lots of unique\n  ideas. Our mission is to provide a wide range of quality educational\n  materials to lower the Linux barrier to entry for new users and in\n  turn increase Ubuntu’s market share.\n\nIt is a free resource, that at the very least you can download the PDF and leave it on your friends computer that they can refer to. It is more of a getting started guide, but gives a good overview of common tasks.\nThe best bet is to download directly from the linked website so you are getting the latest version relevant to the current release of Ubuntu. If you want the manual for a previous version, you can go to the downloads page to specify which version you'd like to download, and for which language. \nAlternatively, you can purchase a copy - there is a Buy it Now link on the website\nI haven't had any personal experience with the manual, but heard about it from a mate who passes it on when he sets up family members on Ubuntu. Just taking a look, it seems to cover a wide variety of topics, and seems like a good resource for anyone new to Ubuntu, to grasp basic concepts.\n", "Q: How do I contribute an autopkg test to ubuntu? How do I contribute an autopkg test for a ubuntu package?\n\nA: Autopkg tests can be written for any ubuntu package. The tests follow the DEP 8 specification for including tests as part of a deb package.\nWriting a test\nA test can be written in a myriad of languages. Common examples are C, bash, python and perl. To write a test:\n\n\n*\n\n*Branch the package bzr branch ubuntu:\n\n*Add a source section in debian/control called XS-Testsuite: autopkgtest\n\n*Add the tests to debian/tests/ folder\n\n*Add a debian/tests/control which specifies the requirements for the testbed. For example:\n\n\n\nTests: build\nDepends: build-essential\n\n\nContributing tests\nGetting the test into ubuntu follows the normal ubuntu developer process. In short, you \n\n\n*\n\n*Branch the source of the package you wish to add a test\n\n*Edit the debian/control and debian/tests/control file to enable the tests\n\n*Add the test(s) to debian/tests folder\n\n*Commit your changes and propose a merge\n\n\nMore information\nTo see a list of current autopkgtests, you can see the live jenkins output of all the tests that are currently being automatically run here.\nIn addition, the ubuntu developer documentation has further information on contributing an autopkg testcase, including examples of tests.\n", "Q: Tried to use deja-dup for backup, but it give the following error(UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii') Is there a way to find the filenames that is causing this error?\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/bin/duplicity\", line 1404, in \n    with_tempdir(main)\n  File \"/usr/bin/duplicity\", line 1397, in with_tempdir\n    fn()\n  File \"/usr/bin/duplicity\", line 1277, in main\n    globals.archive_dir).set_values()\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/duplicity/collections.py\", line 691, in set_values\n    self.get_backup_chains(partials + backend_filename_list)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/duplicity/collections.py\", line 814, in get_backup_chains\n    map(add_to_sets, filename_list)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/duplicity/collections.py\", line 808, in add_to_sets\n    log.Debug(_(\"File %s is not part of a known set; creating new set\") % (filename,))\nUnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xd0 in position 3: ordinal not in range(128)\n\n\nA: This is bug https://launchpad.net/bugs/1080423\nI've uploaded a fix to Ubuntu 12.10, but it's slowly working its way through the approval process.\n", "Q: How to revert an 'apt-get remove' action after pressing CTRL+Z I ran by mistake apt-get remove WRONG_PACKAGE, after realizing this, I pressed CTRL+Z to break the process since removing that package started removing around 100+ other packages.\nNow when I try to run apt-get install REMOVED_ONES it states:\nE: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'sudo dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem.\n\nIs there any way to revert it? \n\nA: Actually...\nCTRL+Z will suspend the process.\nCTRL+c will kill the process.\nNote that suspending a process will send it to the background until you call it again. Since it is suspended you can run another program. It will \"look\" like is gone but is not. It will actually tell you the Process ID that has been assigned to it before going to the background.\nTo know which processes are running on the background we use the jobs command, which would show all background running processes on the opened terminal with their respective background number.\nTo call the process again (Actually to continue the process where you left it) type fg. \nfg means ForeGround. To bring to foreground from background if you want to have an idea of it. If you happen to have other suspended process, you can go to them by doing fg 1 for process 1, fg 2 for process 2 and so on.\nKnow that if you send a process to the background using CTRL+Z you will send the process to the background but it will be stopped. To make it run again, simply run bg followed by the background ID job for that process, like bg 2 for job 2 in the background.\nThe difference when applied to apt-get (Or aptitude or any other package manager) is that the lock files will not get erased when doing a remove/upgrade/install or that the repo file might get corrupted.\nYou will need to literally remove the files with rm.\nBefore removing anything try what the package manager suggests, in that case:\nsudo dpkg --configure -a or sudo dpkg-reconfigure -a in case you did an upgrade. In most cases (in ALL cases for me) I had to first delete the lock files as followed:\nsudo rm -fr /var/cache/apt/archives/lock\nsudo rm -fr /var/lib/dpkg/lock \nIf by chance you want to remove the process (if it is still active) you can either look it up by using ps -e and finding the PID numer, then using kill -9 PID where PID is the number you found or issuing sudo killall NAME_OF_PROCESS\nAlternative you can also do:\nsudo fuser -cuk /var/lib/dpkg/lock\nsudo fuser -cuk /var/cache/apt/archives/lock\nsudo rm -fr /var/cache/apt/archives/lock\nsudo rm -fr /var/lib/dpkg/lock \nAfter all of this you can either use the commands recommended by the app as I mentioned in the beginning or simply try to reinstall the package you mistakenly removed. I also recommend doing an sudo apt-get update just to make sure everything is correct.\nNote that if the package removed all of those other packages, try first to install said package. For example if you did:\nsudo apt-get remove unity by mistake, then first try to do the steps I mentioned and then install that precise package again:   \nsudo apt-get install unity.  \nIf by chance it did not get uninstall then do:\nsudo -apt-get install --reinstall unity\n\nA: I had a similar issue once and ran the command as suggested. \nAfter you do that you can apt-get install WRONG_PACKAGE. It should reinstall all the packages it tried to remove. You do not need to install each one manually.\n", "Q: Broadcom wireless 43142 conflict Atheros 8161 in kernel 3.5 (Ubuntu 12.10) I am exactly in the situation of this question.

I don't know what that is, how do I compile glade from trunk and where do I go to get trunk.\n\nA: Trunk is a term used in version control systems (VCS/RCS). A VCS contains the source code for one or more projects. This is referred to as a source tree. If there are many programmers working on the same code, it's often easier and safer for them to make changes to separate snapshots of the source tree, and then merge their modified snapshots back into the main codebase. Or, in VCS parlance, you create a branch, make changes, and then merge them back into the main codebase - known as trunk. \nSo trunk typically means the latest copy of the codebase; what an outsider would consider to be the latest code for the project. It's more complicated in DVCS systems, but I'll gloss over that.\nIt's important to understand that trunk is where developers are committing their changes to right now. \nNightly builds are generally more stable than trunk, tags more stable than nightly builds, beta releases more stable than tags, and stable releases more stable than beta releases. In other words, trunk is about as unstable it gets, and hence not in any way guaranteed to work. It might not even build.\nYou say you are encountering a bug in glade, and this is why you want to build trunk. It is true the version of glade in the main repo has some bugs at present, e.g. in the inability to edit checkbox label text. But you can work around these quite easily in code, or directly in the glade xml file. \nGenerally, you don't want to be building and running trunk unless you have a good reason to do so (e.g. you're developing glade, or you've encountered issues fixed in trunk that you cannot work around), and are prepared to encounter, investigate, work around (and possibly report/fix) numerous bugs.\nIf you can't stand working around this bug, whatever it is, a better solution might be to try the version of glade in Ubuntu's proposed repository to see if your problem is fixed there. I suggest you go down one of these routes.\nFor the sake of completeness, compiling the latest glade codebase would go something like this.\nsudo apt-get install git\nsudo apt-get build-dep glade\nmkdir glade-src && cd glade-src\ngit clone git://git.gnome.org/glade\ncd glade\n\nTo compile glade, refer to the INSTALL file provided. You'll need something like this, although you may well run into difficulty depending on the state of trunk at the time of your checkout.\nautoconf\n./configure\nmake\n\nIt can then be installed into the default location with \nsudo make install\n\nbut you'd probably want to either adjust the target location to put it under /usr/local/.., or just run it from the bin dir as-is. \n", "Q: Error Message when trying to check for updates \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I fix a “Failed to download package files” error? \n\nI get the following error message whenever I try to check for updates:\nW:Failed to fetch http://archive.getdeb.net/ubuntu/dists/precise-getdeb/Release.gpg  Unable to connect to archive.getdeb.net:http:\nW:Failed to fetch http://archive.getdeb.net/ubuntu/dists/precise-getdeb/apps/binary-i386/Packages  Unable to connect to archive.getdeb.net:http:\nW:Failed to fetch http://archive.getdeb.net/ubuntu/dists/precise-getdeb/apps/i18n/Translation-en  Unable to connect to archive.getdeb.net:http:\nE:Some index files failed to download.

It is a computer that is virtualized.  Meaning there is no hardware directly associated with it.  It uses the host computer's hardware resources to run.  See this link for more information on what a VM is.\nTo answer what I think is the main question, yes.  Once you install Ubuntu inside a virtual machine, you will be able to use Ubuntu apps and anything else Ubuntu has to offer.  It will be very similar to using a physical machine.\nAs far as pros and cons go, I can think of a few.  Mainly, the con would be that you will not get the full computing power of the host machine since you have to share resources between the two \"computers\".  This will not be an issue if you have adequate hardware.  A pro would be that you can do backups and restores of your VMs very easily.\nLet me know if you would like more information on this topic.\n", "Q: Disable compiz in XFCE and switching back to the normal window manager?

How to assign one CPU to one process so that no other process can use that CPU while the process with that PID is running on that CPU?\n\nA: From man taskset:\n\ntaskset is used to set or retrieve the CPU affinity of a running process given its PID or to launch a new COMMAND with a given CPU\n  affinity. CPU affinity is a scheduler property that \"bonds\" a process\n  to a given set of CPUs on the system. The Linux scheduler will honor\n  the given CPU affinity and the process will not run on any other CPUs.\n  Note that the Linux scheduler also supports natural CPU affinity: the\n  scheduler attempts to keep processes on the same CPU as long as\n  practical for performance reasons. Therefore, forcing a specific CPU\n  affinity is useful only in certain applications.\n\nWhile this guarantees that the process will run only on a certain CPU (or a set of CPUs), the affinity setting does not guarantee that no other processes will run on those CPUs. To achieve this, I think you can change niceness (or nice level) of the process to its lowest value (1) - see man nice and man renice for details. \nSetting the lowest nice level will guarantee that the process will not give the CPU to another task while running - however, the guarantee is not 100% (for example, if you have another process with the same priority in the system, both processess may be scheduled to share the CPU)\n", "Q: Can't find steam folder I recently installed steam and TF2 via PlayOnLinux, and I need to find the steam folder, on windows it is on program files.

But just to point it out, Steam is now available for Linux natively(without Wine) and TF2 is Linux supported as well.\nThe Steam folder is located in:\n/home/USERNAME/Steam (also called ~/Steam)\nKeep in mind that if you want to move the Steam folder you must copy it to a location with an EXT3/4 partition format(Ubuntu won't launch Steam from a FAT or NTFS partition without modification to certain system files). You then must Right-Click on the Steam folder and click \"Make Link\". Copy the link to the Home Folder and then rename it to \"Steam\".

I have a bunch of HQ recordings as FLAC with 24bit resolution. They take too much space on my Android device, and Ogg achieves transparent sound (particularly when on the go with noise around me) at much lower bit rates. (I do not want to start a discussion about what differences people might think they can hear at this point.) To convert FLACs to Ogg, I can just do \noggenc -q 6 *.flac \n\nbecause oggenc can directly read in FLAC - which is great. Since I am not a sound engineer, I was wondering if I am cocking-up here. AFAIK Ogg works with 16bit. Anything to take care of when going from 24 to 16bit? \nBesides the bit resolution, is resampling from 96 kHz (or more) to 44.1 (or 48 kHz) problematic? On software side this is pretty easy to achieve, just with: \noggenc -q 6 --resample 44100 *.flac \n\nPractically the outcome is fine. The OGGs sound great. However, the theoretical considerations keep my mind busy. Is the conversion from 24 to 16 bit and the resampling from 96+ kHz to 44100 kHz a problem from the point of sound mastering? \nThanks! \n\nA: I had a large collection of FLAC audio files and I converted them with great quality with The Mobile Media Converter Link it has advance settings and I think it worked awesomely you might wanna give it a try if ogg is not in the list of file formats you can always add it just click the button that has the name of the format and then just select add or remove file formats you will find it there. I hope this helps.\n\nA: You can install the graphical tool Sound Converter from either the Ubuntu Software-Center or your package manager.\nThe tool will allow you to drag and drop audio files and folders containing audio files inside the window and convert it to other formats.

Ubuntu! , Phoronix or ubuntu-news\nUpdate:\nSee this page for more official information of porting Ubuntu touch Ubuntu Wiki as of tomorow (02-22-2013) it will have detailed information of what needs to be done to port to other devices.\n\nA: On OMG!Ubuntu → http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/01/ubuntu-phone-download-will-be-ready-late-february. Source of Ubuntu Phone OS (UPOS) will be aviaible. But that is build for Samsung Galaxy Nexus and Nexus 4, don't Nokia.\n.IMG file - probably.\nN9 is great phone, and UPOS can be installed... also, hardware is same as lot of phones, one of that is Galaxy Nexus, phone where UPOS is presented.\nIf developers can build Android for N9, developers can build UPOS for N9. Wait, and N9 will be on UPOS support list in future.\nAlso, Android drivers can be used for UPOS. Android drivers for N9 exist. Android drivers + Nexus UPOS build = N9 UPOS build. That's my mind.\n\nA: \nWill Ubuntu for phone run well on a Samsung Galaxy Tab2 with 3G?\n\nSome background:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Ubuntu for Phone build is for phones.\n\n*The Samsung Galaxy Tab2 (7\" or 10.1\") is a tablet.\n\n*A tablet with 3G has mobile 'broadband' data capabilities.\nSo, with a 3G-capable tablet you can use VoIP, but not make 'mobile' phone calls. (Unless you add some add-on 'device' to the tablet.) That equally applies regardless of what OS is present on the tablet.\n\nA different question (which you did not ask) is whether there will be a version of Ubuntu that will work on the Galaxy Tab2.\n\nA: Ubuntu Touch is currently maintained by UBPorts Team.\nThe list of supported devices is presented on https://devices.ubuntu-touch.io/.\n\nA: \n\"Work on the phone and tablet is also ending, the whole convergence\n  story, really.\"\nMichael Hall, Canonical Community Manager\n\nIt is not compatible, and will never be. This is Mark Shuttleworth's (founder of Ubuntu) official blog post on the subject, written April 5, 2017:\nhttps://insights.ubuntu.com/2017/04/05/growing-ubuntu-for-cloud-and-iot-rather-than-phone-and-convergence/\n(I was also sad)\n\nA: I have started an Ubuntu Touch FAQ in order to have some answers to frequent questions available: \nplease look here: On which devices does this Developer Preview run? \nand here: Can you make it run on my device xyz as well?\n\nA: I wrote about this a while back but I figure this may help those who stumble across this in the future.\nTop 5 devices you can buy right now that we know support Ubuntu Touch:\n\n\n*\n\n*Samsung Galaxy Nexus\n\n\n*Google (LG) Nexus 4\n\n\n*Google (ASUS) Nexus 7\n\n\n*Google (Samsung) Nexus 10\n\n\n*Aionol Novo7 Venus\n\n\nA: It's certainly not slated as a supported hardware and I would say it's unlikely to ever officially become such. The only two tablets supported are the Nexus 7 and Nexus 10. Phone support is again only slated for Nexus devices (Nexus 4 and Galaxy Nexus).\nYou may be able to hack it on but given the differing hardware, you'd have to do quite a bit of work.\n\nA: I think you can use any Hardware/Device in as much it meets the following requirements.\nThe hardware requirements are quite acceptable. The Entry level Ubuntu smartphone needs to have at least a 1Ghz Cortex A9 (single core as the bare minimum), 512MB or 1GB memory, a 4-8GB eMMC + SD for storage, and Multi-touch capability.\nThe high-end Ubuntu \"superphone\" is a little more demanding and will need at least Quad-core A9 or Intel Atom processors, minimum 1GB for memory, minimum 32GB eMMC + SD for storage, and Multi-touch.*\nI don't know if it support tablet because of screen resolution. it will be awesome though on tablet.\nSources: Click Here\n\nA: I think the XDA site should also be mentioned here. For a lot of phones and tablets this is a good place where development is done. There is no support, or at least not from Ubuntu or canonical, but there is a large community trying to get it to work. Here they have a list of phones on which development is going on to get Ubuntu touch on it. Be sure to read trough the forums to see whether everything you need works. \n\nA: What most people overlook is that Ubuntu Touch as it has been running on the officially supported devices until now runs almost two Operating Systems at the same time, not one.\nYou have Ubuntu Touch running the device and being your interface and you have a LXC container providing Android services. While the LXC container is not a full fledged Android with a UI, this setup consumes a bit more resources and complicates porting for non-Android devices. \n\nA: Canonical has announced some unfortunate news for those who were hoping to get Ubuntu Touch on some rather recent (and even new) Android devices. Engineers have confirmed that they are dropping official support for three different Nexus devices.  That leaves us with the Nexus 4 and the 2013 Nexus 7 as the only two devices that Ubuntu will continue working on for the Ubuntu Touch project.\n\nA: Canonical gives its specifications on the Operator and OEM Partner page.\n", "Q: How to access Ubuntu server 12.10 via hostname, I had it working, but then installed LAMP and a few other things to set up a webserver, now PUTTY only allows connection via IP, which works, and Webmin worked with hostname as well, until now...

Assuming it is mounted at /media/disk:\nsudo rm -rf /media/disk/*\n\n(or just run Nautilus as root using gksudo Nautilus and delete everything in a nice GUI-way).\nIf you insist on formatting the partition, you need to unmount it and do\nmkfs -t ext4 /dev/sda3\n\nAfter that you'll need to update your bootloader so it sees that there's no OS on the second partition anymore and removed the entry from the boot menu:\nsudo update-grub\n\n", "Q: Hide boot drive from nautilus I have a boot drive which I don't want to show up in nautilus.

Some questions I want answered in the answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I know if apparmor is running?\n\n*How can I tell if it's working well?\n\n\nA: To address this subquestion: How can I tell if it's working well?\nApparmor profiles are a work in progress. Consequently, the goal posts are moving. Please take a look at \nPoking Holes in AppArmor Profiles and the response of Canonical's Jamie Strandboge here. I hope these two links will give you an idea of the complexity of the issue.  \nWhether you wish to retain the subquestion as part of your question is your decision.\nApologies in advance for this \"non-answer\".\nEdit to further illustrate why this subquestion is, to say the least, dependent on context:  \nConsider one of the most popular programs: Firefox. It has a profile but it is shipped in complain mode and not in enforce mode. In other words, Apparmor does nothing for Firefox out of the box. The reason is stated here, albeit briefly:\n\nThe end-user impact for users in default installations will be non-existent. The firefox package will ship in complain-mode during the development cycle and before release (or at some point in the cycle) be updated to be disabled. Users must opt-in to using the profile and therefore should know that AppArmor confinement could cause firefox to behave unexpectedly.\n\nNext, consider what happens when an average user who just \"heard\" or \"read\" about Apparmor puts the profile in enforce mode. No doubt there's a sense of achievement.\nThen, look at this bug from 2010, ignoring the rude bits. Notice the title: \"firefox apparmor profile is too lenient\". Read on for the rationale, in part, in Comment #4:\n\nAppArmor can protect against many things. The firefox profile protects against execution of arbitrary code by the browser and reading/writing of files you do not own (eg /etc/passwd), reading/writing sensitive files like the user's gnome-keyring, ssh keys, gnupg keys, history files, swp, backup files, rc files and to files in the standard PATH. It also confines add-ons and extensions to the above. Firefox is integrated into the Desktop and so it must be allowed to open helper programs and access the user's data. The profile is by default general purpose with the design being:\n    * when enabled, it significantly improves the security of firefox as is\n    * it provides a starting point for people to confine firefox how they want to\n    * the implementation gives the user the ability to fine-tune it to be as strict as desired\n  Of course firefox can be locked down more to protect the user's data. We could make it so that it could only write to ~/Downloads and read from ~/Public. However, this deviates from upstream's design, would likely put Ubuntu's Mozilla branding at stake, and most importantly frustrate users. Is Ubuntu's profile a \"violation of the idea of apparmor\"? Of course not -- it is protecting user's from various attacks and many forms of information disclosure. It is a distribution requirement to provide a functional browser. It is a distribution choice to not break it with too-aggressive security protections. It is a user's/administrator's choice to configure the profile for her environment.\n\nSimilar arguments apply to Evince.  \n\nA: To know the status of your app-armor , type this command in your terminal.\nsudo apparmor_status\n\nfor example , sample output:\nTo give working performance of Apparmor I think there is no Measurement tool.As I know we have to detect it by the things happening around with your PC I mean something abnormal.\n\nA: You can check using the following command:\nsudo systemctl status apparmor\n\n", "Q: is it possible to install ubuntu 12.04 on usb drive while retaining windows 8 on HDD? Let me explain what I am trying to do in detail...\nI want to install ubuntu 12.04 (or 12.10) on a 320gb usb drive, and set the boot order to boot usb first. That way, if I want 12.04 to boot, I just have to start my machine with the driver inserted, and if I want to boot windows, I start it with it disconnected. \nI have done this on previous computers, but this machine is windows 8 uefi, which I have never done before.

Left secure boot enabled, and changed the boot order to boot usb first.  I'd suggest pre-partitioning using a gpt partition table, make a 300M FAT32 bootable partition for EFI, and your favorite partition scheme for the rest.  You must install from the \"try\" desktop however, because regardless of where you specify putting the bootloader, your hard disk's EFI partition will be the one mounted and used.  To correct this wrong behavior, before starting the install have a terminal running, and have command lines you can recall (just for speed) which unmount the hard disks's EFI, and mount the target's EFI.  Start the install, immediately after specifying the partitions, check in the terminal, do the umount/mount, and let the install proceed.The the Ubuntu files will be put onto the target.  One big problem you avoid doing this is trying to boot Windows through grub -- Windows may not be seen, wrong grub commands will be used, and you need to run boot-repair just to fix all that up.\n  Removable media use the bootloader in /EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi (for x64 architecture), so copy\n/EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi to /EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi (for secure boot, no need to turn it off).  Also put a (signed) copy of grubx64.efi into /EFI/Boot/grubx64.efi.  Have a copy of grub.cfg in /EFI/ubuntu/grub.cfg, and things should work.  I think installs later than 12.04 will use a grub.cfg which pulls in the maintained copy in /boot/grub, but a full grub.cfg file works too -- you would need to update it when kernels get updated.\n  You probably want to take the execute permission off the /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober, since it won't see windows, and kills the timeout on the grub menu when it adds it's stub code to grub.cfg.  I'd also suggest backing up the EFI partition files.\n", "Q: ess won't fully install ubuntu 12.04 The last time I ran sudo apt-get upgrade ess gave this error and now says its not fully installed.

I'm in a similar situation to the following user:\nHow to combine an SSD boot drive with a HDD data drive?\nIn the process of manually partitioning my drives, I encounter a menu that looks like this (note: I fetched this image from google as an example). I have several questions about this menu and about manual partitioning:\n\n\n*\n\n*What does the F character after the partition size indicate in the menu image? In my case, I also have K and f characters. What do those mean? (I'm assuming B is bootable)\n\n*What characters (properties, whatever) do I need to have for the root partition on my SSD? \n\n*I have indicated where /, swap, and /home go. If I do not make separate partitions for the rest of the top level folders (/var, /tmp, etc), where does it decide to place them?\n\n\nMy setup is based on the opinions I've gathered throughout these forums: 20Gb root partition on SSD, +500Gb /home partition on HDD, 16Gb swap on HDD (this was the default size in my case).\n\nA: *\n\n*The F character indicates that the partition is to be formatted. Under normal installations on a new machine, this is the desired setting, however, if you were to be reinstalling the OS on a machine with a previously used partition for /home, for example, you would go into the manual partition options and specify that partition should not be formatted.\n\n*The root partition on the SSD is usable as-is with the default settings.  There are some tweaks which could be done, post installation, to reduce the amount of writes to the SSD.  Often, the logging options for various system services is scaled back or the noatime filesystem option is turned on to avoid constantly updated access times of system binaries/shared libraries/etc. which are unnecessary.\n\n*As Linux is a singly-rooted operating systems, all directories will appear on the root partition.  If, for example, user home directories are on a dedicated partition, that partition would be mounted into that directory as its mount point.\nBased upon your graphic, it looks like the root partition is a little small and the /var partition is quite large.  For basic test setups such as you are likely doing with this VMware virtual machine, I would probably encourage you to not dedicate a partition to /var.  You will have too little flexibility when you fill your root partition and you have an extra gigabyte of free space in /var.  You can always create a dedicated disk image for /home to reduce overall disk usage.\n", "Q: Is there a command line tool to shrink partition size? I have searched around and found this page.

I found a nautilus script I would like to use. How do I install it?\n\nA: Say you want to install the following script you found while browsing Ask Ubuntu:\n#!/bin/bash\n## Sample Script 0.1\n## Dependencies: notify-osd\n\nnotify-send \"Sample nautilus script\" \"You Selected $NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_FILE_PATHS\"\n\nDependencies\nThe first thing you'll notice is that many scripts won't just run out of the box. Sometimes they depend on other packages you might or might not have installed. In this case our script depends on notify-osd, which comes with Ubuntu by default. \nOn other distros this might not be the case and you'll have to install the dependencies before using the script. If the dependency is part of the official repositories you can easily install it with apt-get, e.g.:\nsudo apt-get install notify-osd\n\nSetting the script up\nNow that we've satisfied all dependencies we can move on and copy the script to our system. To do so we first create a new document in our scripts folder, which is ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts or  ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/ on Ubuntu 13.04 and above. This is a hidden folder. In order to head to it you will have to open your file manager, press CTRL+L and paste the directory path into the Location bar.\nNext we will create a new empty document by right clicking and selecting Create new Document → Empty Document. Name it anything you want, but beware: The title you choose is how the script entry will later appear in the nautilus context menu. So better choose a descriptive name for the document:\n\nOpen the new document up in a text editor of your choice and proceed to copy and paste the contents of the code box above into it. Save it and exit the text editor.\nMaking it executable\nAt this point your script is set up correctly but still won't work as the system does not recognize it as an executable file yet. To make it executable, right click on your file and head to Properties → Permissions. Set the checkmark at Allow Executing as program and close the dialogue:\n\nUsage\nYou should now be able to access the script from your nautilus context menu. Just right click on a file of your choice and head to Scripts --> Script name (here: Sample Script). Click on the entry to execute the script on the files you selected:\n\nAssigning a keyboard shortcut to the script\nKeyboard shortcuts for Nautilus scripts can be assigned by editing Nautilus' keyboard accelerator file. On Ubuntu 12.04 and below this file can be found under ~/.gnome2/accels/nautilus. On newer releases this file has been moved to ~/.config/nautilus/accels. Please note that your script will only appear in the accelerator file after restarting Nautilus (execute nautilus -q, then launch Nautilus again by clicking on its launcher).\nThe syntax of the accelerator file might look a bit overwhelming at first but it's actually pretty easy. Take a look at this excerpt, for instance:\n; (gtk_accel_path \"<Actions>/ShellActions/ZoomInAccel2\" \"<Primary>KP_Add\")\n; (gtk_accel_path \"<Actions>/ShellActions/TabsNext\" \"<Primary>Page_Down\")\n; (gtk_accel_path \"<Actions>/ScriptsGroup/script_file:\\\\s\\\\s\\\\shome\\\\sglutanimate\\\\s.gnome2\\\\snautilus-scripts\\\\sSample%20script\" \"\")\n; (gtk_accel_path \"<Actions>/ShellActions/Search\" \"<Primary>f\")\n; (gtk_accel_path \"<Actions>/ShellActions/Forward\" \"<Alt>Right\")\n\nEvery line represents a single key assignment. The first double-quoted segment designates the action, the second one the assigned key combination. Lines starting with a semicolon are commented and currently inactive.\nIn order to assign a shortcut to your script you will have to search this file for the name of the script and uncomment the corresponding line by removing the semicolon. Then proceed to type in the keyboard shortcut you would like to assign. \nThese are the available modifiers and their corresponding keycodes:\n\n\n*\n\n*CTRL = <Primary>\n\n*ALT = <Alt>\n\n*SHIFT = <Shift>\nYou can find valid keycodes for all other keys by using xev.\nHere's how you would have to modify the section above to assign your sample script to ALT + SHIFT + S:\n; (gtk_accel_path \"<Actions>/ShellActions/ZoomInAccel2\" \"<Primary>KP_Add\")\n; (gtk_accel_path \"<Actions>/ShellActions/TabsNext\" \"<Primary>Page_Down\")\n(gtk_accel_path \"<Actions>/ScriptsGroup/script_file:\\\\s\\\\s\\\\shome\\\\sglutanimate\\\\s.gnome2\\\\snautilus-scripts\\\\sSample%20script\" \"<Alt><Shift>s\")\n; (gtk_accel_path \"<Actions>/ShellActions/Search\" \"<Primary>f\")\n; (gtk_accel_path \"<Actions>/ShellActions/Forward\" \"<Alt>Right\")\n\nOn Ubuntu 12.04 (and perhaps later releases as well) Nautilus will sometimes overwrite the accelerator file before you can make any changes. So it might be a good idea to perform all of the changes you make while Nautilus isn't running (nautilus -q). Either way, you will have to restart Nautilus to see the changes.\nAutomating the installation\nThis Nautilus script will automatically install Nautilus scripts for you.

I'm trying to capture the logs for a certain bug I'm having with Google Chrome. However, I can't find/enable logs for GC.\nAccording to this Chromium project page, I just need to add the flags --enable-logging --v=1 and a chrome_debug.log file will appear in my user data directory. However, after running GC (and closing through the 'X' title bar button) there is no chrome_debug.log file in the specified directory. I even tried running as root as it may have something to do with write permissions but GC refuses to start as root.\nAnother thing, GC also prints messages when invoked from command line. I tried capturing this and redirecting them to a file via $ google-chrome > today.log but the messages are still printed in the command line and the file I specify gets created but remains empty.\nNote that I can't just copy-paste the messages printed on terminal after my bug occurs as the bug freezes up my whole system that, when it occurs, my only option is to turn off my computer straight via the power button. I've seen a few similar bugs already posted but I find that they don't exactly describe my situation so I'd really like to get some logs for this.\nSo how do I enable logging or, at least, get those terminal messages in a file?\n\nA: It seems likely that you're not looking in the right place for the log file.\nWhen you run google-chrome --enable-logging --v=1, the log file will be created inside ~/.config/google-chrome (where ~ represents your home folder). If you're using Nautilus (the graphical file browser), you'll have to press Ctrl+H or click View > Show Hidden Files to see files and folders that start with ., such as the .config folder.\nOr, if you're using Chromium rather than Chrome and you run chromium-browser  --enable-logging --v=1, the log file will be created inside ~/.config/chromium.\nIf you want to send all the output of a command to a file, including error output, use the &> redirection operator instead of just >. So you could run google-chrome &> output.txt.\nedit\n\nyou can also see your crashes reports at chrome://crashes if logging was enabled before\n\n\nA: Another hit is to redirect to stderr\n--enable-logging=stderr --v=1\n\n\nA: I just tried this and to save the console output that shows up on the terminal you have to use BOTH the --enable-logging --v=1 command switch and the &>log.txt redirect.\n", "Q: Why can't I boot Ubuntu?

Also, the system had Windows 8 pre-installed.\n\nA: The problem is actually Windows and not Linux. Microsoft wrote their system to try and hijack the computer as a whole from any other operating systems. Multiple windows updates (I'm guessing you have automatic updates turned on for windows?) will try to kill the GRUB bootloader. \nAlthough there are software ways around this (such as reinstalling Ubuntu), my personal suggestion for avoiding this continually is to add a second internal harddrive to your computer. (This is much better for system stability anyway! One harddrive for each operating system, and one \"documents and media\" hard drive where you store your files, pictures, movies, etc. This usually ensures that if something dies horribly, you won't be completely lost, especially as any big errors to happen will USUALLY happen on the operating system's harddrive.) Then, you can avoid GRUB and windows overrides entirely but just hitting your computers bios \"boot device menu\" key when booting and just change which drive you're using. \n", "Q: My /opt directory is empty and the app lens is not working, what should I do? I have 12.10 installed, and I was searching for Transmission one day in the apps lens. It didn't show up, and I was confused; I began searching more in the lens and realized no apps were showing up. As an alternative, I began using the terminal. But since this isn't a real option, and I was confused by the title of the programs (I din't even know it was chromium-browser instead of just chromium!).\nAfter this, I decided to search for the programs, and where they were installed - so I could execute them that way. Checking this chapter on the Heirarchy of the Linux Filesystem, I found that the /opt directory was most suitable after reading the description.\nHowever, the results of my exploration were not as I had hoped. I navigated to the filesystem and opened the /opt directory. I was surprised to see there was nothing in the folder. No other folders, no files, nothing. I confirmed that I was allowed to access the file in there, and had sure to check for hidden files and folders. \nI can open any applications when I run the command in a Terminal, and I have been pining them for easy access. They open as normal. \n\nA: You will find that most packages installed after installation by the package managers will reside in /usr/bin/ or /usr/sbin/ Ive always thought as /opt/ as a place for applications not installed by package managers or \"propitiatory\" software.\nIf you want to find where a program lives in the filesystem you can use the which command:\nstephenm@mcr-pc-29392:~$ which chromium-browser \n/usr/bin/chromium-browser\n\nAnd for the unity app lens problem:\nTry removing and installing the application lens again:\nsudo apt-get remove unity-lens-applications\n\nsudo apt-get install unity-lens-applications\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu does not keep settings for dual-monitor setup, how can I correct this? First I have a Windows 8 PC with two monitors attached:\n\n\n*\n\n*A 24\" primary monitor at 1920 x 1200, and \n\n*A second 19\" monitor at 1280 x 1024. \n\n\nWindows boots using the smaller 19\" monitor before eventually adopting the saved configuration: 24\" as primary, 19\" as secondary. Ubuntu does more or less the same, booting on the 19\" then using both monitors. \nAfter Ubuntu installation the desktop is mirrored across both. I switch this option off and then set up the correct resolutions. I then adjust the position of the monitors using the utility provided. Everything is good and lovely. However, the next time I fire up Ubuntu (restart or cold boot) the settings have been lost and something else is adopted. That is doesn't seem consistent.\nSometimes it will confuse the 24\" unit and result in a display that, whilst reported to be 1920 x 1200 - is way off the screen by some distance. What's worse, sometimes the displays are completely corrupt and there is no choice but to physically reset the computer. \nI really want to get this working so any help would be welcome. \nFor reference my specifics are listed below:\n\n\n*\n\n*My graphics card is a GeForce 9500GT,\n\n*The BIOS 62.94.80.00.00 and Win 8 Drv:9.18.13.0697, \n\n*The Monitors are:\n\n*\n\n*Acer AL2416W (analog input only), and\n\n*A Viewsonic VG910b (Digital input used),\n\n\n*The motherboard is Gigabyte 965P-S3, \n\n*The CPU is E6420 Core 2 Duo,\n\n*4GB of RAM. \n\n*Ubuntu ISO is 12.10-desktop-i386.iso installed alongside Windows 8. I am using the default desktop.\n\n\nIncidentally, Ubuntu correctly identifies each monitor when using the display settings utility but doesn't automatically select the native resolution for the 24\" unit. This has to be manually selected from the drop down list.   \n\nA: It's quite possible that you aren't starting up your monitor settings with admin rights. Try bringing up the terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T) and typing the following:\n\nsudo gnome-control-center display\n\n(After this, you'll put in your password and press enter) \n", "Q: 12.10 hangs on Ubuntu loading screen been trying to install Ubuntu 12.10 on my Toshiba Satellite C855D.

Since one or two months ago, my laptop with ubuntu 12.10x64 hangs during shutdown. There's just a black screen, no harddisk activity, it justs sits there. I feel it happens near the end of a normal shutdown cycle, judging from time elapsed.\nOnly resolution is hard power-off (holding power key for several seconds) - neither Ctrl-Alt-Backspace (which normally works, I have it switched on in Settings) nor Ctrl-Alt-Del help, nor can I get into a text console with Ctrl-Alt-F1. \nHow do I diagnose that? It does not happen on every shutdown, but often enough to be annoying (as it forces a diskcheck on reboot, of course). \nWhich log files can tell me what's going wrong? More or less blindly searching in the sys log viewer reminds me of needles in a haystack.\nI imagine I could pinpoint the time it happens via log timestamps, but how do I read timestamps like e.g. in kern.log: [36169.146130]? How do I get this human-readable?\nLastly, a bit of a btw, I've never managed to execute an Alt-Sysrq-REISUB to force a cleaner shutdown, but that's probably because I'm on a laptop, PrintScr is only accessible via an Fn key, and I'm not sure of the exact key sequence I need. Is there a \"harmless\" but user-visible magic command I could practice this with (during normal operation), so I can find out how to do a REISUB next time?\nThanks all! Comment if you need additional data...\n\nA: You need to shutdown without the splash screen, and from the command line to see what's going on. First you need to disable splash via GRUB (See verbose shutdown)\nBoot and hold SHIFT to enter grub. Press while over the linux entry to edit it. Then go to the kernel line (press END to go to the end of the line) and remove the \"quiet\" and \"splash\" arguments. In fact, for this one test skip out the GUI al together and add the argument \"text\". (Without this you can get to the command line with CTRL+ALT+F1)\nLogin, then type:\nsudo shutdown -v -h now\n\n(-v for verbose, -h for halt.)\nKernel log files in /var/log/kern.log should contain human readable time stamps. Open them with the log file viewer\ngnome-system-log\n\n(File>open) And you should see the human readable time stamp on the left. If you still don't see the human readable ones, this guy made some python/perl scripts to parse them.\n\nA: I have this problem.  Disabling 3D Acceleration in Bios seems to fix the problem.\nPress F1 or F2 on start up (or on the system settings in the grub) and disable 3D acceleration.  Let me know if this fixes the problem.

That would increase the probability of recording separate audio parts/songs as separate files.\nI have uploaded here the timer syntax help (also available after installation clicking the button beside timer options).\n\nA: First of all: the \"Add\" option beside the name of the output file must not be checked in order to avoid potential new files being added to the previous one. (I guess this is the default setting in fact!!)\nAs for the settings in the Timer, it is a matter of trial an error, and changes should be made from case to case.\nA good start would be adding in any case 'start if sound', so that a new file should be created when sound starts; but in order to have a new file, first the recorder must be made to stop when there is no sound. 'stop if silence' is not a good option, as it creates a lot of small useless files; a better option is 'stop if silence 1 sec.'. 'stop if silence 0.5 sec' may also be a good option. (This should be enough for the stated purpose. Using audio threshold timer commands seems to me more complicated.)\n\nChanging volume level during recording is a bad idea.\n\nA: I just went through this (my daughter had a requirement...well, ok, demand to populate her mp3 player).\nI installed audio-recorder on both her laptop and my server.  I like the server option better since I have more space there and no speakers hooked up.  The laptop makes noise.\nI ended up using the following for timing (this took a bit of trial and error).\nstart if sound 1s 0.5\nstop if sound 2s 0.2\n\nI'm using Jango as my input stream.  On the laptop this works great, on the server I end up (for reasons I can't explain) with a lot of tiny files.  \nSo I wrote a script to clean up:\ncat cleanup.sh\nfind *.mp3 -size -100k | xargs rm -rf\n\nAfter they are recorded, I use Picard to label and categorize them.

My friends ask me to build him a web server with 12.04 64-bit server edition in his 1GB RAM server.\nIs it recommended or safe? Because I heard 64-bit system need at least 2GB RAM.\n\nA: The server guide lists the minimum requirement as 128 megabytes for all architectures. I don't see any reason why 1GB wouldn't be fine.\nHowever, that's just the installation.

Today after a reboot, Ubuntu blurs text (well, anything that is rendered on screen) whenever focus changes or on any interactions with the desktop.\nExample:\nNormal good look:\n\nBlurred state:\n\nNote how the text, folders and the plus signs left of the folders are somewhat blurred.\nIn this case, the normal state is after opening the window. Blur happens on lost focus, and gets normal again whenever something is redrawn\nThis applies to anything that is drawn. Even in 3d games, text and thin lines flicker between normal and blurred intermittently, or whenever desktop interaction happens.\nI have ruled out anything to do with font smoothing, this seems to be opengl-related.\nDoes not occur if I switch to Unity 2D or Gnome, but then again, that's not what I want to use.\nThis just in: As it happened, the issue fixed itself while typing this question, after Compiz crashed and restarted itself while trying to provoke the issue. Strange, seeing how the issue survived several reboots.\n\nA: I had a similar issue, on a colleagues laptop. I even removed compiz (apt-get remove compiz). The bug was still apparent in unity (flickkering, appear/reappear background) no blurry screens since no text because after login nothing started: no toolbars, no icons, no menus.

I have to close Nautilus, or switch to another folder and then switch back to the first folder... make sense?\nI'm not sure where to look/what to do to fix.\nAlex\n\nA: This can happen if inotify subsystem ran out of the handles. Running python -mpyinotify /path/to/folder should display the requests to the filesystem that all applications can see. In case this does not work, neither will other applications.\nThe most likely case for running out of inotify handles is that some application (e.g. Dropbox or Ubuntu One) is tracking the changes in the directories.\nIn this case you will need to increase the value of fs.inotify.max_user_watches sysctl parameter.\n", "Q: Recover Hard Disk from accidentally formate in ubuntu installation I am very new to ubuntu.

Lookup a local data recovery specialist tell them everything you did, With a bit of luck they can recover a lot of the data you had.\nThe only data you will lost is what has been overwritten, I don’t know how much a freshly installed Ubuntu takes up but as long as you didn’t choose to Encrypt the Ubuntu install and overwrite unused space then there will be good data still sat on the disk.\nIf you cannot afford data recovery as it usually is quite expensive I would do the following.\nSTEP 1 (Optional but recommended)\nTake a byte for byte image of the drive using a live CD such as TRK\nyou can use dd to do this\nI'm asuming you have one hardrive and its /dev/sda\nThe next command is going to take an exact copy of your hard drive so you will need somewhere with enough space to fit this copy.

Now this doesn't work. I've found many solutions, people telling to install this program or that, didn't seem to work.\n\nA: Fix Scrolling Speed and back/forward buttons on a Logitech G900 (should be the same for this one):\nxev didn’t work for my mouse, I used the command xinput to find out the device ID of my mouse first. To list the Input devices:\n # xinput \n⎡ Virtual core pointer                      id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Logitech Gaming Mouse G900                id=8    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Logitech Gaming Mouse G900                id=9    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎣ Virtual core keyboard                     id=3    [master keyboard (2)]\n    ↳ Virtual core XTEST keyboard               id=5    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                              id=6    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                              id=7    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ HD Pro Webcam C920                        id=11   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Logitech Gaming Mouse G900                id=12   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Apple Inc. Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad id=10   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n\nand then use xinput test 8 (this is the mouse id, 9 didn't give any output) to find out that the side buttons are actually button 8 and 9 (just press them and look at the output to see which buttons you press).\nI have previously installed imwheel to adjust mouse scrolling speed already\nCreate a .imwheelrc like this:\ncat >~/.imwheelrc<<EOF\n\".*\"\nNone, Up, Button4, 5 \nNone, Down, Button5, 5\nNone, Thumb1, Alt_L|Left\nNone, Thumb2, Alt_L|Right\nEOF\n\nWhere the \".*\" means, use that config for all x-windows. If you want to use that config only in chrome, for example, you could insert there \"^google-chrome$\".\nYou can use xprop WM_CLASS | grep -o '\"[^\"]*\"' | head -n 1 and then click a windows, to get the Name which should be in the config.\nThe None part in the first column means Mouse button klicks are registered without holding any modifier keys (e.g. Shift, Ctrl, Alt) at the same time.\nButton4 and Button5 are typically the Mousewheel.\nThe 5 at the end of the line defines the scroll speed (higher is faster, lower is slower)\nI have no idea what the ThumbN means.\nThe Alt_L|Left should emulate holding down the left Alt key (Alt_L), and pressing the left arrow (←) key to go back in the browser. KP_Left instead of Left would also work.\nRestart imwheel with killall imwheel and imwheel.\nNote: you have to reopen the windows to take effect.\nTo find the Button Names use the listing by xmodmap -pke or the Graphical interface from it xkeycaps\nI used many sources. To honor some of them:\nAnother post on same topic\nAlso about mouses\nexample imwheelrc file\n\nA: There are multi mouse button instructions here and xorg.conf info here.\nEssentially, you mess around with xinput. (Or imwheel for more options.)\nFirst, open a Terminal. List your input devices:\n# show all input devices\nxinput list\n\nYou'll get something like this:\n$ xinput list\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                          id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Microsoft Natural® Ergonomic Keyboard 4000        id=11   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Evoluent VerticalMouse 4                  id=12   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n\nI have an Evoluent VerticalMouse. You can see the identifier number is 12: \"id=12\".\nI can test my mouse with:\n# show all input from device with identifier number 12\nxinput test 12\n\nNow when I move my mouse or click, I get output in that terminal telling me what button I pressed. Hit Ctrl-c to end the test.\nIf your back/forward buttons aren't giving you output, try resetting your button map to the default with set-button-map. Note that I'm using my device name that was output by xinput list:\nxinput set-button-map \"Evoluent VerticalMouse 4\" 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14\n\nNow try running xinput test with your id. If you're getting correct button responses here, then you just need to figure out the mapping you want and update your xorg.conf.

I am intending to dual Ubuntu studio with Vista (already on the computer). I am told by various online tutorials that I need an internet connection while installing Ubuntu Studio. I have installed the ISO file and burned it to a DVD. Does the installation process download more files for the OS and if so, how much?\n\nA: Ubuntu itself is an OS that heavily depends on a internet connection. All the repositories are on-line so installing software and updates are done over the internet. Our dash keeps getting things like webapps, internet searching (ie. amazon) and so on that all expect a permanent internet connection to get results.\nDuring installation the system uses your installation media but can use the internet to update those files or install restricted software (like mp3 playback). Studio itself is aimed at the GNU/Linux audio, video and graphic and restricted formats are more than likely not available on the installation media (since it would be a copyright violation) so you will at least once need an internet connection for that.

If you can live without your custom mouse button assignment on the login screen, add the command to your startup applications. Don't use sudo, it isn't useful here (and in fact might not work).\nWith a Gnome interface, the startup applications are in \"System > Preferences > Startup Applications\".

I want to install ubuntu on my dell notebook, currently it is running windows 7. My question is: Do I need to format windows partition (i.e. C:/) only or the whole hard disk to make an installation of ubuntu?\nsecond question is: If I need to format windows partition only, would I be able to access data in my other partitions on the same hard disk having ntfs file system?\n\nA: For Ist question \nNo you dont need to delete ANY partition. You can make Dual Boot system along with Windows either by using wubi that comes with Ubuntu or completely independent OS. In case of WUBI it will be installed on same Partition e.g C:\\ as an app but will give you option during boot to which OS you want to use and good thing about it that you can it uninstall it just like any other app from Uninstall section of Windows. OR \nif you want to have a only ubuntu as the OS, then choose Somthing else option in ubuntu installer. \nIdentify the c: drive. Delete it. \nCreate a new partition using file system as ext4 and mount point as \\.\nThen continue to installation.  \nFor 2nd Part\nYes u can access other partitions like NTFS thats the beauty of Linux. \nHopes this answers. Enjoy\n\nA: you don't need to format any of the partition, you can simply use wubi installer, it will install as easily as any software or on a specific partion for which you will need to format one partition and rest of the partitions will be accessible from both windows and ubuntu\nsee What's the difference between Wubi and a regular \"alongside Windows\" installation?\n\nA: You do NOT have to format the partition on which you installed windows, that's completely unnecessary. \nJust add another Partition, by removing space from different partitions.\nWhen you have a live-CD or DVD of Ubuntu you can change your partitions while installing ubuntu with gparted. \n", "Q: How do I reboot from the recovery console?

When I switched to ubuntu I was informed that hibernate wasn't activated by default due to motherboards not handling it properly. I believe I'm not in this case since it works great with XP.\nI've tried hibernate without modifying any configuration file, just using as suggested the CL command\n\nsudo pm-hibernate\n\nIt works somehow: from time to time it works normally, but most of the time here is what happens:\n\n\n*\n\n*hibernates correctly after the CL command is issued\n\n*starts resuming when powered on but stops with a black screen\n\n\nHowever I've found a workaround to complete the resume:\n\n\n*\n\n*while the black screen is displayed, just use Fn-F12 (which by default is suspend)\n\n*resume from suspend by pressing Fn again. The login screen appears.\n\n\nIt worked anytime so far.\nTo sum up, sometime hibernating from the CL doesn't fully resume, but if we do a blind suspend and resume from suspend, then the computer is restored as it was before hibernating.\nI wonder how can suspend work with XP and not with ubuntu on the same computer.\nIs this a bug (I'd be happy to file a bug if it helps) ? Can anybody points me to some related online documentation ?\nMy computer: thinkpad T60 with dual core T2400\nEDIT: as explained the comuter may get out of the black screen if a suspend-resume is done on the black screen. I tried to see if ubuntu was reading the keyboard during the black screen, before the suspend-resume... it does! but I'm even more stunned... \nIf I type blindly \"dir\" at the black screen level, then when the resume is completed with the workaround mentioned above, and after I've logged in, then I see the result of the dir command in the console I've used to type the pm-hibernate command.\nWhat it seems to mean is that ubuntu is accepting commands before the login has occurred. Seems to be a big security issue...\n\nA: For suspend-to-disk (=hibernate) to reliably work you need a swap-partition at least the size of your RAM.\nTo be honest I never hibernate my T60, I always use suspend to RAM\nEDIT:\nThis becomes even less of a real answer - but as you asked for a bug report I want to point you to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingKernelSuspendHibernateResume, especially the parts further down.\n(Remark: I remember problems on my T60 too but I have no idea how I solved them and I don't want to play with settings...)\n", "Q: software-properties-gtk does not start I'm using Ubuntu 12.10.

It first compresses 900 MB large data blocks using a dictionary method, and then it hands the cleaned-up data over to bzip2. It is much faster than the other strong compression tools (bzip2, lzma), and some files it compresses even better than bzip2 or lzma.\nYes, gz is the default compression tool on Linux. It is fast, and despite its age it gives still very good results in compressing text files like source code. Another standard tool is bzip2, though it is much slower.\nAddition: lrzip is newer and extends the principle of rzip. It even supports unlimited block sizes, and a choice of compression methods (LZMA, Bzip2, Gzip, LZO, ZPAQ or none). LZMA is the standard. For backup or if you share much data with other Linux/BSD users, it can come in really handy.\n", "Q: How to create a bootable USB stick on windows but to install on linux after a powr failure when upgrading to Ubuntu 12.10 I have a completely deficient system. It is read only and despite many attempts I failed to remount it read write, fsck and mount -o rmount, rw don't work, recovery mode does not work.\nI am not experienced with linux and under time pressure because have to write a paper until tomorrow and have only this computer.\nThus I thought it was best to reinstall. I have downloaded the iso on my usb stick on another computer. However, I can't us my startup disk creator as my usb stick is not being recognized as the filesystem is read only. I don't have a bootable usb or disk around (I know that's stupid) and I have no one using linux nearby who could help me create the stick. They all have windows.\nThus my question: Can I create a bootable usb on a windows system but to install on a computer which has Ubuntu on it? The wuby client you can download for windows on the ubuntu site is .exe so it would be no use on a computer that has only linux on it?\n\nA: Your best alternative would be to create a bootable USB, assuming you have access to the ISO.\nWindows\nThe easiest way to create a bootable USB on Windows (in my opinion), is to use YUMI. It allows having multiple bootable systems on the same USB and it's easy to use as it can download the distro ISO for you.\nDownload YUMI and follow the instructions. Make sure you choose \"Format this drive\" but remember that this deletes all the data on the USB drive.\nUbuntu\nYou can create a bootable USB on Ubuntu aswell. You can either use the graphical interface, or the terminal. If your system is having troubles detecting the drive, you can go into the terminal and run the command sudo fdisk -l you may have to enter your password. This outputs a list of all the disks and their partitions. An USB drive usually looks like this:\n\n> Disk /dev/sdb: 4.0 GB, 40007761920 bytes 64 heads, 32 sectors/track,\n> 38154 cylinders\n> \n>   Units = cylinders of 2048 * 512 = 1048576 bytes Disk identifier:\n> 0x00b4c6f2\n>      Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System \n>   /dev/sdb1               1       38154    39069680   83  Linux\n\nIf the ID of the partition (/dev/sdb1 in this case) is set to \"??\" or if the System is set to \"Unknown\" this means that your partition is formatted in an unrecognized filesystem. You can reformat to FAT32 with the following commands, but please note that this erases all data on the drive.\nsudo umount /dev/sdb (change /dev/sdb according to the results from before)\nsudo mkfs.vfat -n ‘NEWDRIVE’ -I /dev/sdb (format the drive)\nsudo mount /dev/sdb /mnt (mount the drive again)\nOnce the drive is recognized by your system, you can follow directions from the community wiki: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick\n\nA: The official Ubuntu website has a guide on how to create an Ubuntu USB stick on Windows.\nYou will need:\n\n\n*\n\n*a Windows machine connected to the internet.\n\n*an empty USB stick, 1 GB or larger.\n\n\nOn the Windows PC:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the ubuntu ISO file.\n\n*Download and run the Universal USB Installer\n\n\n\n*See the figure: On \"step 1\", choose the version of the Ubuntu ISO you downloaded. On \"step 2\", choose the path to the ISO file. On \"Step 3\", chose the drive letter for the USB stick.

How to deal the error?\n\nA: I assume you are not using the built-in rtl8192cu because it doesn't actually connect.\nThe package you downloaded, written for 2.6.xx kernels, is probably never going to compile correctly in 12.04, using a 3.2.0-x kernel. Also, an error at 'make' suggests you haven't installed the necessary build tools. With a temporary ethernet connection, open a terminal and do:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic build-essential\nwget http://www.orbit-lab.org/kernel/compat-wireless-3-stable/v3.6/compat-wireless-3.6.6-1.tar.bz2\ntar -jxf compat-wireless-3.6.6-1.tar.bz2\ncd compat-wireless-3.6.6-1/\n./scripts/driver-select rtlwifi\nmake\nsudo make install\nsudo modprobe rtl8192cu\n\n\nA: It appears your device is supported in newer releases of the Linux kernel. Ubuntu provides a package with 'backports' of this. This is fairly the same as the answer of chili555, but without downloading from a 3rd party website (potentially untrusted and unsafe) and without the need to compile.\nJust do:\nsudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-cw-3.6-precise-generic\n\nand reboot.\nYou would have come to this step also when following my guide:\n\n\n*\n\n*My WiFi adapter is not working at all, how to troubleshoot?\n\nA: The problem is you don't have a compiler for C (the Programming Language) installed.\nFirst of all run the following command in your terminal to install build-essential.\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n\nThen run all the commands as given in instructions.\n", "Q: How can I cut the margin of a PDF or djvu file for optimal booklet printing?

But if I print directly in booklet format I still get those large margins.\nHow can I get rid of them? can I create a new file in which those margins do not appear and print it optimally as a booklet?\n\nA: Try pdfcrop, available on the package texlive-extra-utils.\npdfcrop --margins 0 file.pdf\n\nThis will take the original PDF and crop completely the margins of it, assuming it is generated will real margins. If you want some margins, you can change the 0 for another number like 5 or 10.\n\nA: I use either Briss as in Sadi's answer, or pdf scissors. \nIf your file is made of scanned images, you may want an even better (but more time consuming) option: Scan tailor.
