I am trying to use pbuilder to upload to PPA. Package builds ok with the command:\nsudo pbuilder build <package>_<version>.dsc\n\nBut upload fails with error:\nSource/binary (i.e. mixed) uploads are not allowed.\n\nIt is said that I need to use pdebuild to build source package, but pdebuild doesn't resolve build dependencies. How can I build this package, so it can be finally uploaded? I don't want to install dependencies manually.\n\nA: The answer is that you don't.  pbuilder takes the source package and builds binaries.  It also can take the source code without a source package built and create the binaries that you would either host yourself or add to your own debian repository systems to host on your own.\nThat's not what you need for a PPA.\n\nWhat you want to do, and what I strongly recommend, is that you follow traditional packaging procedures, and run debuild -S on the code, with the directory for the package there, containing the source code, the debian/ folder, and everything else.\nThen, after you've built the source package by debuild -S, you can then upload the created .changes file in one directory above the source directory to the PPA via dput.  (this step is referred to on Launchpad's PPA Uploading help docs).\nYou can in theory use pdebuilder to keep your system clean and build inside a chroot, but read on for my statements on this, as to why it failed previously for you.\n\nPer the comments, you have correctly identified that debhelper is unable to find the autoreconf plugin.\nAlso as I said in my comments on this answer, pbuilder and pdebuilder are both not smart enough to determine the debhelper dependencies.\nTo solve your issue so that your stuff can build, you will have to manually use pbuilder or pdebuilder to login to the chroot.  Then, you will have to manually install dh-autoreconf into the chroot, usually with apt-get install dh-autoreconf after you've logged into the chroot.\nOnce you've done that, and saved the state of the chroot, you should be able to pbuilder or pdebuilder your package.\n(However, I prefer traditionally working with packages, and I don't care if my build system is entirely clean or not, all I really build are source packages, and the debhelper plugins aren't going to clutter my system that badly)\n\nA: pbuilder is used to build binary packages from a source package. PPAs also build binary packages from source packages. Simply dput the source.changes file that you created when you also created the <package>_<version>.dsc file.\nOne of the main points in using pbuilder is to locally mimic the clean chroot environment that is used to build the binary packages both in the official archives and in PPAs.\n", "Q: How can I enable the drivers for beats audio speakers for hp envy dv6?

The problem you face is that Microsoft wants the Windows operating system as the FIRST operating system on the disc. \n\n\nThe easiest method to fix this is to format all discs, make 2 partitions where the 1st one is NTFS and the 2nd one EXT4 and then install Windows on the 1st and Ubuntu on the 2nd.\nThis will get you a GRUB with both Ubuntu and Windows in the menu.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you do want boot to be NTFS you will also want GRUB4DOS. So you will need to install that 1st. But this will NOT fix your problem of installing Windows. Grub demands support for permissions and symolic links and NTFS does not provide that so it is not possible for boot to be NTFS when using GRUB.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu Live 12.04.3 x64 Skip installation screen My laptop's internal HDD broke a week ago and now it won't boot (or do anything) from it.

Help Appreciated! I've been running Ubuntu 12.04 since it's debut in 2012 without a single problem. Today I just ran sudo apt-key update && sudo apt-get update and then I rebooted my computer. After rebooting however, it first shows the Ubuntu bootscreen (with the Ubuntu logo and the dots below it) after which it booted to the command line. I could login and navigate around on the command line, but no GUI was loaded at all.\nSo I tried running sudo startx, but this gave a message saying (among others) the following:\n\nNVIDIA: API mismatch: the NVIDIA kernel module has version 304.88, but\n  this NVIDIA driver component has version 304.108. Please make sure\n  that the kernel modle and all NVIDIA driver components have the same\n  version.\n\nI found this thread which suggested to do:\nsudo service lightdm stop # to stop the xserver\nsudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia* # to remove all driver elements\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\nsudo reboot\n\nAfter doing this, it now boots to the login screen where it seems that there are now two users named kramer65 on my computer. One of the two has the default (instead of my personal) background and says my password is incorrect. The other one seems to be my \"real\" account and  when I type my password it seems to try to show the desktop. Instead however, it shows a black screen after which I think X.org crashes, because it loads the login screen again.\nSo I guess the Nvidia driver is still not okay, or maybe there is something wrong with the duplicate accounts (both with a username kramer65 (but I guess it's the Nvidia driver). \nDoes anybody know what else I can do from here? All tips are welcome!\n[EDIT]\nThe strange thing is that I can actually login using the guest account, so I don't understand whats wrong with the specific kramer65 user login.\n\nA: I don't know about the duplicated account, but running sudo startx as part of your driver diagnostic / repair process has likely left a root-owned .Xauthority file in your home directory. The X server tries to write to this file when lightdm passes control to the user session, and if it fails the session terminates and sends control back to lightdm, causing a 'login loop'\nYou can go into a Ctrl+Alt+Fn virtual terminal, log in as your regular user (the .Xauthority file is not involved in console logins), and check with\nls -l ~/.{ICE,X}authority\n\n(this will also list the ownership/permissions on ~/.ICEauthority, which also sometimes gets messed up). If it is root-owned then either change its ownership back\nsudo chown $USER:$USER ~/.Xauthority\n\nor simply remove it (a fresh copy will be generated on the next successful GUI session startup)\nrm -f ~/.Xauthority\n\nIf that works, and allows normal GUI login from either of the apparent duplicate accounts, we can then investigate further about those.\n", "Q: \"Missing Update Command\" Ubuntu/Android Dual boot App I'm using the android app to dual boot Ubuntu touch and android 4.4.2 stock on a nexus 10.

Damage was big enough that made the OS unable to boot and even unable to chrooted.\nFortunately I had another Ubuntu on another disc and I was able to recover chroot and then boot and network functionality of damaged OS. Then I booted the damaged OS and ran a script that reinstalled every package installed on it (with apt-get install <package> --reinstall) it wasn't as easy as I'm describing it, there were lots of packages that needed specific attention.\nAfter that almost everything's fine except running 32bit binaries like wine and adb.\nI need an expert in this field to tell me what should I do to recover executing 32bit binaries.\nFor example suppose that I wanna run wine:\nFirst lets run it on fish:\n# wine\nFailed to execute process '/usr/bin/wine'. Reason:\nThe file '/usr/bin/wine' does not exist or could not be executed.\n\nNow lets run it on bash:\n# wine\nbash: /usr/bin/wine: No such file or directory\n\nLets enter the full location:\n# whereis wine\nwine: /usr/bin/wine /usr/bin/X11/wine /usr/share/wine /usr/share/man/man1/wine.1.gz\n# /usr/bin/wine\nbash: /usr/bin/wine: No such file or directory\n\nLets see if the file really exists:\n# ls -l /usr/bin/wine\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 9748 Dec 18 05:11 /usr/bin/wine\n\nWhat ldd and file say:\n# ldd /usr/bin/wine\n    not a dynamic executable\n# file /usr/bin/wine\n/usr/bin/wine: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.24, BuildID[sha1]=0xe4e2fb58bdbbbc2dedf7483825900ed35a6dc989, stripped\n\nHow to solve this?\nDamaged OS is Ubuntu 13.10 amd64.\n\nA: The ldd results are expected, since the \"binary\" is just an script:\n$ file /usr/bin/wine\n/usr/bin/wine: POSIX shell script, ASCII text executable\n$ head /usr/bin/wine \n#!/bin/sh\n\nset -e\n\nwine=/usr/bin/wine32\nif test \"$(file -b -L \"$1\" | cut -d\\  -f1)\" = \"PE32+\" -o \"$WINEARCH\" = \"win64\"; then\n    wine=/usr/bin/wine64\nfi\n\nif test -f $wine; then\n\nSo, what's the solution? Remove them completely and install them. We don't really know how much damage is there so removing and reinstalling is the most safest:\nsudo apt-get autoremove --purge wine\n\nThe same with any package that doesn't work. You can verify the package that correspond to the binary using dpkg -S:\n➜  ~  dpkg -S /usr/bin/wine\nwine: /usr/bin/wine\n\n\nA: Run\nsudo apt-get install libopenal1:i386\n\nor\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall libopenal1:i386\n\nAt least this should make ldd behave well. I don't know if this will solve the other problems, it might. If not then I would just look at the ldd output, and install/reinstall the packages which contains those libraries.\n\n\nA: You could use Rescatux for repairing your broken machine.\nYou can make it to bootable usb using Unetbootin.\nHope this could solve your issue. \n", "Q: How do I make Tools Options show up in GIMP 2.8?

(\"Small\" = ~100MiB to 1GiB.) Chances are you'll need to shrink another partition to do this, of course. Backing up that partition is highly advisable.\n\n*Download the rEFInd binary .zip file and unpack it somewhere convenient (such as that HFS+ partition you've just created).\n\n*Boot from an OS X installation/emergency disc.\n\n*Once you get to the point where a menu bar is visible, use it to open a Terminal window.\n\n*Install rEFInd by running install.sh with its --ownhfs option, as in sudo ./install.sh --ownhfs /dev/disk0s5, changing /dev/disk0s5 as necessary.\n\n*Reboot.\n\n\nThe result should be that rEFInd will appear and enable you to boot. It will also appear in a location that should cause the firmware to find it and present it in its menu when you hold down the Option key while booting, so you should be able to recover a little more easily in the future. Some caveats:\n\n\n*\n\n*The --ownhfs option to install.sh is new, so be sure to use rEFInd version 0.7.6 or later. (0.7.6 is current as I write.)\n\n*When I've tested this method of booting, rEFInd has failed to scan some partitions. If this happens, hit the Esc key to have rEFInd re-scan for boot loaders. Uncommenting the scan_delay option overcomes this problem permanently. (Setting the value to 1 is probably adequate.)\n\n*If rEFInd is reading your Linux kernels from a Linux filesystem, you'll need to either manually install the driver(s) or use the --alldrivers option to install all the drivers. If you do the latter, manually removing the drivers you don't need is advisable.\n\n\nIf you don't have an OS X emergency disc or if this procedure doesn't work, you could try installing it from Linux using the --usedefault option to install rEFInd to the ESP using the default/fallback filename, as in sudo ./install.sh --usedefault /dev/sda1. Some (but not all) Macs will boot from the default/fallback filename if they can't find another boot loader, so this may work well for you; but if your model doesn't use the default/fallback filename, this alternate procedure will fail.\n", "Q: How to set ubuntu to use specific graphic unit?

I have seen similar questions on stackoverflow and elsewhere and have tried everything in those answers, but it still does not work. I am working with ubuntu 12.04 LTS. Here is what i have done:\nchange limits in /etc/security/limits.conf, i have put in settings for * and root. I have also changed  limits to some number like 10000 and unlimited. \n* soft nofile 1513687\n* hard nofile 1513687\nroot soft nofile 1513687\nroot hard nofile 1513687\n\nI have also tried above setting with - instead of soft and hard.

The settings in this file are reflected with ulimit -n. But settings from hdfs.conf and mapred.conf are not reflected.

Both tools work with images rather than PDF files but you can easily convert between the different formats these applications use and PDF by using the tools described at the end of this answer.\nScanTailor\nYou can find a video tutorial here. More extensive documentation is available on the official wiki. You will probably be most interested in the page on black and white output mode and filter settings.\nNote: Since ~2016\n\nThis project is no longer maintained, and has not been maintained for a while.\n\nCheck ScanTailor Advanced.\nUnpaper\nI haven't worked with unpaper myself, yet. From what I understand it has far more features than ScanTailor but it's also much harder to master.\nThere is no GUI interface and you will have to rely on command line switches to get your work done. On the other hand this means that conversions with unpaper can easily be automated using scripts.\nYou can find some scripting examples concerning converting a scan to black and white and removing the background here.\nInstallation\nThis command will install all of the tools mentioned above:\nsudo apt-get install scantailor unpaper poppler-utils libtiff-tools\n\nHelpful tools when working with unpaper and ScanTailer\nI don't have enough time to write up a full tutorial on ScanTailor and unpaper1 but here are some pointers concerning converting between .pdf and the image formats supported by these tools:\n\n*\n\n*You can use pdfimages to convert PDF documents to single page .ppm files, which can be read by unpaper.\nUsage example:\npdfimages *.pdf ./extracted-images\n\n\n\n*ScanTailor doesn't take .ppm files as an input. You will have to convert them to another format like the loss-less .pngfirst. mogrify out of the  imagemagick tool suite can do this for you.\nUsage example:\nmogrify -format png *.ppm\n\n\n\n*The output format of ScanTailor and unpaper are single page .tiff files. In order to convert them back to .pdf I would suggest using tiffcp and tiff2pdf.\nUsage example:\ntiffcp *.tiff all.tiff\ntiff2pdf -F -p A4 -z -o Document.pdf all.tiff\n\n\n1: To anyone reading this, please feel free to compile a more extensive answer based on ScanTailor and/or unpaper.\n\nA: maybe Master PDF editor can help you, although I haven't found anyway to do this automatically over the 600 pages.\n", "Q: How to create a time-lapse video from JPEG images using avconv?

When I installed ubuntu 13.10, I went through all the set up like set a password and what not and everything seemed to work fine. \nOnce I finally got to the desktop and had everything working (or so I thought) there was an icon on the side that had popped up saying that there have been updates to programs or something. When I clicked on details I saw that things like firefox and a few other programs had updates, so my first reaction was to install them. After the install it requested that I reboot, and so I did. \nThe Grub boot menu popped up and I selected Ubuntu and it seemed to be loading up. However, a black screen showed with processes that kept failing, and eventually the screen would be stuck on either the terminal or the Ubuntu loading screen with the dots indefinitely. \nThis happened all 4 times that I installed Ubuntu from fresh. This time I have not updated any of the programs, hoping it works. Has anyone experienced this? And is there anything that I should do the make sure this doesn't happen again?\n\nA: My initial thought would probably be that either the ISO you burned wasn't good, or that a step is missing. I'll wait for someone else to step in and give you a more detailed answer, but I'll give you a tip or two.\nOpen terminal and type\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nYou can also type them separately (line before &&) and line after && \nWhen it asks for your password, you'll type it in but you won't see anything being typed. \nMy final answer: reinstall the desktop.\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:unity-team/staging\n\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\nsudo apt-get install unity\n\n", "Q: Why can't I create a file in “/” or main Directory in Ubuntu? I am trying to create a file in \"/\" directory (which contains bin, boot , cdrom, dev, etc) but I am unable to do so. Although I am the one who install ubuntu and I am the root user? The error I get is of permission denied.\nWhen I used sudo it asks for password but I haven't set any password for it.\nAlso I cannot calculate the hash of a file in this directory.\nI am sorry for my lame question as I just have switched to linux after using windows for long time.\n\nA: In Ubuntu most anything you do outside of your own home directory requires you to become a superuser, in other words to become Root, or to gain root privileges which are all the same.\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I become a \"superuser\"?\nNow with being root you will have a greater responsibility to keep your system in a stable state but also a very high risk to break it. Root can do anything including breaking your OS to a state where you will have to re-install Ubuntu as the only option remaining for repair.\nThere are only rare conditions where creating directories outside of /home/ may be needed. It certainly is not the way our understanding of the file system heirarchy is. In addition backups or a system reinstallation becomes harder with every single file residing outside of /home.\n\nSo if you are a beginner to the Ubuntu world I strongly advise you to not create directories or files outside of your home directory unless you really really know that you badly need them to be there, and your are 100% certain that there is no other solution.\n\n\nA: It is file permissions, you can start a root shell with \n sudo bash\n\nBut be careful what you do. Also please note that, on Linux, you usally don't create dictionaries in the roor dir / - if you want to store files such as documents or photos, they should go in your home directory. \necho $HOME\n\nwill print the path of the current user's home directory to the shell. \n", "Q: optirun with running browser Problem:\nI have a window of Firefox or of Chrome opened via the launcher in the menu and now I want to run another instance of the program that take advantages of my dedicated Nvidia card, via \noptirun firefox\n\nor\nprimusrum firefox\n\nWhat I expect:\nLike in any other program, the already opened one stays there and continue using the integrated graphinc card, while another window opens and take advantages of the dedicated card.\nWhat I obtain:\nThe new window somehow uses something of the old one and does not take advantage of the Optimus technology.\nIMPORTANT NOTE 1: If I run\noptirun firefox\n\nor\noptirun google-chrome\n\nwhen the program is not previously running, the expected behaviour matches what happens, i.e. the browser uses the dedicated GPU.\nIMPORTANT NOTE 2: It is NOT a problem of profiles.

To avoid redundant trouble I'm trying to install win7 first (and partition the system there) and then use that partitioning to install linux. However, after a successful windows installation when I open gparted (from a live CD) and it says that all the devices have unallocated memory (only ssd shown on the screen but every single device has same thing). When I proceed to installation I get the same unallocated spaces thing. \nQuestion: what can be the reason of this and how can I resolve it to simply install ubuntu on ssd?\n\n\nA: You apparently had partitioned the disk using GPT at one point, then used a non GPT aware partitioning tool ( fdisk maybe? ) to re-partition the disk using an msdos partition table.  The GPT is still there, and that is what (g)parted is looking at instead of the msdos partition table.  You need to remove the invalid GPT if you want to stick with msdos:\nsudo apt-get install gdisk\nsudo gdisk /dev/sda\nx # xpert mode\nz # zap gpt\n\nThis is the case for your sda only.  Run sudo parted -l and add it to your question to see what's wrong with the other drives.\n\nA: This question answers it perfectly. And apparently windows converts the sector or block size to 512 bytes, however if reformatted with gparted the sector size becomes 4096 bytes.

But I'm a bit confused with LBA not fitting in the block range shown by fdisk. (however, halving the number aggreees with range; so does that imply LBA blocksize of 2048 ?!?)\n\nA: Use hdparm:\nsudo hdparm --fibmap FILENAME\n\nwhere FILENAME is the path to your file.\nRegarding your calculations:\n97504*512/1024^2=47,6 that's how you do this.\nRegarding the not fitting in the block range:\nYou circled the NTFS drive in the fdisk output, which ends at LBA 251863039, the hdparm output reports, that the file system on which the tested file resides begins at LBA 251863040.

I'm porting some SysV-style service scripts for HBase (a java service) to upstart.\nThe sysv scripts don't call java directly, but instead call hbase-daemon.sh. This is a start-stop-daemon-like tool that ships with the package which pulls in a lot of configuration and ultimately ends in a nohup java ... & to actually run the process as a daemon.\nSince the configuration logic in hbase-daemon.sh is involved, I would rather not modify or rewrite it (to remove the nohup) and instead have upstart call it directly.\nThis seems to be what the expect clause is for, except in my case it isn't working.  Even with expect daemon (the two fork case), I end up tracking the wrong pid on service start.  This suggests that my scenario is forking too much, or perhaps nohup shouldn't be handled with expect, or yet something else.\nHow can I use upstart to manage a service that expects to be started with a script that calls nohup?\n\nA: You could try using crontab, and enter this in the terminal:\n crontab -f nohup\n\nand then enter this:\n pyton(version) -v -f echo 'nohup' & disown\n\nand then enter this in the terminal:\n crontab reboot\n\nand it might work fine this way.\n", "Q: screen freezing while moving large files to external disk I have Ubuntu 13.04, while moving large files to external disk using Nautilus or Thunar screen is freezing, I have to push power button to reboot.\nI have 3.8.0-34-generic kernel installed.

I have never used rsync or cron before. \n\nA: I use rsync over ssh with chron to keep an up-to-date copy of my entire /home over the internet every couple of hours. It takes seconds and works flawlessly. If you take an hour to figure it out, you'll never have to think about it again.\nTo make it a little easier to manage, you can create a fill called firefox-settings-backup.sh somewhere with the rsync command line, and use Scheduled tasks from the repos as a simple cron management tool to run firefox-settings-backup.sh\n\nA: For all those who have writing cron and rsync command, I recommend this app: http://gnome-schedule.sourceforge.net/\nIt has a GUI and creating a repetitive cron job is a piece of cake. \n", "Q: Skype port: open or closed? both Ubuntu 12.04 sudo Netstat,sudo ufw status, and my firewall gfw assure me that my port at skype is open and listened to\nbut the free port scanners on the internet all show it not open\nwhat gives? who is correct and why is the other wrong\nis the port really not open or closed, but filtered?\nif that's the case, can i still use skype?\nthanks\n\nA: Between your computer and internet there probably is your home router that work as firewall.\nIf you want your computer to be reached from the outside you need to \"port forward\" from your router.\nThis shouldn't be necessary for Skype however.

Is there any idea?\n\nA: I strongly recommend you don't permanently stay as a root user. Is there any reason you need to do this? I believe you need to delete your actual user, but I am not really sure if Linux structure allow this. Instead of been root permanently, you can keep the regular configuration, protecting your system from any possible damage or attack. In any case, when you need administrative tasks and permissions, you just need to enter your system password when required and that's it!\n\nA: In Ubuntu 13.10 / 13.04 / 12.10 and Ubuntu 12.04, User defined login or GUI root login is disabled by default. You can enable the user defined login by modifying the lightdm configuration file. Once the manual login is enabled, then its easy to login as root in GUI.\nTo Enable Manual Login in Ubuntu 13.10 13.04 12.10 12.04\nOpen a Terminal run the following command, Issue the password for the user when prompted.\necho \"greeter-show-manual-login=true\" | sudo tee -a /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\n\nNow set / change the password for the root user in your machine.\nTo set / change the root password run the following command in the terminal and issue the password for the user, when prompted.\nsudo passwd\n\nEnter the password twice.

Could you help me?\n\nA: If your drive is Region 2, then both Region 0 and Region 2+4 discs should work in theory. Region 0 discs are designed to be playable on drives of any region code, and discs with multiple region codes should work on drives of any of those region codes.\nI would generally advise not to mess too much with the region code of the drive – chances are that your drive is set to region 0, and will thus accept discs from any region. (Some schemes exist to prevent discs from playing on a Region 0 drive, but they are not widely used and can be bypassed.) Setting a region code may limit your options for the future, as the region code can only be changed a limite number of times.\nAs others have noted already, the correct path to use is /dev/sr0 or /dev/cdrom.\nHowever, I have had a similar experience on 12.04. Certain DVDs would refuse to play, or stop playing some 15 minutes into the main title, while other DVDs would play with no issues. \nThe same DVDs that were giving me trouble would play without a glitch on a different computer (same OS but different hardware).\nI don't have a complete solution – the problem seems to be related to the combination of computer (possibly just DVD drive) and DVD. However, I did figure out a workaround:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try playing the DVD on a different computer. (A live USB installation of Ubuntu may come in handy here.)\n\n*When you have found a computer that will play the main title, use a file manager to copy the DVD contents to a USB drive or network share, in order to move to to the computer that refused the disc.\n\n*To play the content of the DVD, start VLC and open the VIDEO_TS folder.\n\n\nThe copied folder will play even on the computer that refused the disc.\n", "Q: How to test what is causing a delay on user login?

Lubuntu crashes frequently, especially when I use the browser.  I can't close Lubuntu using Alt+SysRq+REISUB, must power off the computer. \nHow can I log off without powering down?\nHow can I resolve the crashing problem? \n\nA: If it crashes frequently when you use the browser (I guess with some flash content), then it is likely a problem with your graphic cards driver. Either the driver has some bugs, or simply it can't control the graphic cards power saving features, so the card overheats. Try testing against this case with some graphic intensive programs. If it is confirmed then try using another VGA driver (fglrx vs radeon, nouveau vs nvidia), or simply don't use graphic intensive programs if you can.\n", "Q: Disk Errors.

The HDMI works fine the mini display port is not recognised, was hoping intel drivers would fix it?\n\nA: I had this problem with a second monitor before. First, you need to know the resolution of the monitor (just google it if you don't know.) Then, go into the System Settings, and into the Displays tab. I'm guessing that you want the screens to extend on eachother, so you can uncheck the box that is labeled \"Mirror Displays.\" Try pressing \"Detect Displays.\" If your second monitor shows up, then click on it, and set the resolution. Hit apply. If that doesn't work, then (this is what I did), change the resolution of your second screen to something lower than what it actually is. Then hit apply. That's when my second screen turned on. Then, you can change the resolution to the actual resolution of the screen, and apply that. It worked for me. I don't know if I exactly answered your question or not. If the second display does not show up at all, then check all your connections. Make sure it has power, and is connected via HDMI. If it still isn't recognized, then you may want to look into getting new drivers. Though I wouldn't expect drivers to be your problem, they very well could be. If none of the things I said above worked for you, then you need to ask someone else :)\nHope that helped!\n--Michael\n\nA: The issue is with either the Intel Driver or the BIOS, not the display set-up. I have several of these BRIX BXi5-4200 units. . They will boot with one monitor plugged in, but will not boot with two monitors plugged in. Video goes on, but hangs. So, after shutdown, the second monitor Best attached to the mini DP, is unplugged at an adaptor. System boots, then we plug in second monitor. No issues once the system boots. Since all monitors are live even when turned off, (but not unplugged), simply turning monitor two off doesn't help. \nSince they draw such little power, at first we just left it all on, but even when all settings are set to NOT sleep, hibernate, etc. (set to always on), after 6-8 hrs the video will turn off, and won't come back up until restart. \nWhat a disappointment.  \n", "Q: Installed Ubuntu and can't connect to WIFI I installed Ubuntu and can't connect to the WIFI. The Wired connection is working and everything else is fine. \n\nA: Here's how to connect to the wifi:\nGo to System Settings, and go to the Network tab. Select \"Wireless Connection\" from the left panel. Then, from the drop-down, select the network you want to connect to. It should prompt for a password (if there is one). Enter the password, and it should pop up a little notification saying something like \"connected to network 54mbps\" or something like that. If you don't get the notification, then there must be a problem either with your wifi card in your computer, or with your router. I would recommend restarting your router, and trying to connect again. If that doesn't work, then restart your computer. If none of that works, then it gets very complicated from there.\nHope this helps!\n--Michael\n", "Q: Upstart unknown job problem I set up nginx according to instructions here and it all went well but I am unable to start with\n$ start <my app name>\n\nI created /etc/init/nomilkfor.me.conf (this is the domain name) and this is what is in the file:\ndescription \"ubuntu 13.10 on Samsung laptop\"\nauthor \"zeynel\"\n                                                   \nstart on startup\nstop on shutdown\n                                                   \nsetuid deploy\nchdir /deploy\nconsole log\n                                                   \nenv PORT=4000\nexec java -jar my-webapp-0.1.0-standalone.jar\n\nI reload nginx with\n$ sudo nginx -s reload\n\nand I try\n$ start nomilkfor.me\n\nbut I get \nstart: Unknown job: nomilkfor.me\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?\nI also tried to open the log files in /var/log/upstart but I could not open them with nano.\n\nA: I found that if there is any errors in the script file the start command will report \"Unknown job\".\nYou can check the script using init-checkconf /etc/init/nomilkfor.me (not as root but as a user account)\nOnce all errors was fixed there the start nomilkfor.me might work.\n", "Q: Difference between Lubuntu Mini Core and Lubuntu Mini Desktop I'm looking at using the minimal install for Lubuntu 13.10 on a Power PC iBook G4. I was originally going with the full Lubuntu 12.04 for PPC version on USB, but as of yet I have been unable to boot from USB and the DVD doesn't boot.\nSo, I looked into using the minimal install, as it can fit on a CD. However, I'm not sure whether to go with the Lubuntu 13.10 Mini Desktop or Lubuntu 13.10 Mini Core? \nWhat's the difference? Is it the number of non-essential packages included (like Abiword, Leafpad, etc.) or what?\nThanks!\n\nA: You are correct that difference is the packages included in each option.\nInstallation options for minimal, core, and full desktop are given at Lubuntu Minimal Install.\nThe minimal version is the same as the standard ubuntu-minimal metapackage. The list of packages included is given at Saucy ubuntu-minimal.\nThe core version is installed on top of minimal. The list of packages it provides is given at Saucy lubuntu-core.\nThe packages in the full version are listed at Saucy lubuntu-desktop.\nKeep in mind that the minimal install does not include a graphical desktop at all. The core install has a basic lxde desktop, but does not include certain graphical tools like network-manager-gnome. If you are dependent on wifi, you will need to set it up manually or install NetworkManager from removable media before you can do updates or install additional packages.\nThe minimal install uses, I believe, a textual installer similar to the Ubuntu server and Debian textual installer.\nPowerPC is no longer officially supported but is supported by the community. See PowerPC FAQ in the Ubuntu wiki for more information.\nPowerPC downloads are also linked from the wiki. Most of the links take you to the daily builds (14.04), but you can get to other releases by navigating the directories.\nA PowerPC iso for Lubuntu is available. You should be able to just install the full Lubuntu with that image and not worry about starting with the minimal install.\nThe list of packages in the PowerPC image, by the way, is given in the ubuntu-13.10-desktop-powerpc.manifest. If in the end the regular install won't run on your computer, you would need to do the minimal install, then download and burn the full PowerPC image to use the media as a repository to install the rest of the packages.\n\nA: I don't know the specific packages, but the difference between core and desktop in any in general Ubuntu distributions it seems safe to extrapolate:\nCore is the \"core\" requirements for the system to minimally function and no more.  Usually this means no Desktop or Xorg is installed.  However, as this is called Lubuntu core, I seems safe to assume Xorg and LXDE are installed, but no extra widgets, applications or helper scripts, such as a graphical network manager will be present.\nSince core is the base requirements for any system, all of core should be contained within any other Lubuntu distribution, as such, Lubuntu Mini Desktop.  Or to rephrase, Lubuntu Mini Desktop should have ALL of the packages in Lubuntu Mini Core, plus some extra packages to make it usable to an average user, like a graphical way to configure your internet connection.\n", "Q: What are some Desktop Enviroments that are 100% open-source and touch-friendly?

The new machine now has UEFI and all that goes with that and I am stumped.\nIt seems that installing Windows 7 from DVD forces it to use UEFI which then requires Ubuntu to use EFI also. If there is no way to install Windows without UEFI then I would like to at least turn off secure boot if possible to keep the installation simpler. I am not sure yet if the BIOS will allow this. Because UEFI is designed to be used with GPT hard disk formatting, many of the workarounds I have read about using MBR formatting may create problems. \nMy understanding is that the newer Ubuntus support secure boot, but Windows 7 does not so there needs to be a way of using UEFI but not secure boot for this to work.\nIdeally I am looking for a way to set up a dual boot similar to the old setup with an independent bootloader on its on partition and chain-loading. If that is still not possible yet please point me to a successful tutorial of an alternate setup. \nThanks\n\nA: Windows 7 doesn't support Secure Boot, so if Windows 7 is already installed, Secure Boot is disabled (or perhaps not supported at all by your motherboard).\nChances are Ubuntu is mostly installed, and you need only install any EFI boot loader you like. Given your current situation, either of two options is likely to be the easiest:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and prepare a USB flash drive or CD-R of my rEFInd boot manager. You should be able to boot to that, and from there into Ubuntu. Once Ubuntu is running, you can install the Debian-package version of rEFInd, and it should become your default boot manager.\n\n*Run the Boot Repair tool from an Ubuntu live CD. This action should install a fresh copy of GRUB on your hard disk and make it the default.\n\n\nNeither option is 100% guaranteed to work. If both fail, post back with the URL that Boot Repair provides and a description of what happened.\nYou could also try any of the other boot loaders described on my EFI boot loaders page. Installing most of them will take more effort than installing rEFInd or using Boot Repair, but if you learn to do it, you'll be better able to cope with problems in the future.\n", "Q: How do I change the title bar buttons on Kubuntu?

I have Lubuntu 13.10 in my seven-year-old PC with 512MB RAM and an Intel Dual Core 3.00Ghz x 2 Processor. I sometimes unplug it from the power while it is running, in an emergency situation. Please tell me if there may be any adverse consequences of manually powering off my computer while it is running.\n\nA: Well, the real question here is \"what could not happen\" because of happening bad stuff doing hard shutdowns there are many:\n\n\n*\n\n*Data loss\n\n*Data corruption\n\n*Degradation of the hard disk plates\n\n*Filesystem inconcistency\n\n*some weirdness about services\n\n*etc.\n\n\nWhy there isn't more detailed and technical information? Well, because nobody does, and you shouldn't either. BTW, this isn't exclusive to Ubuntu or Lubuntu or any operating system, all machines should be properly shut down with their pre-established methods.\n\nA: Improperly shutting down your computer can cause some harmful effects for your software. Though newer operating systems are better equipped to handle an improper shut down, there are still negative effects associated with it. Computers should be shut down improperly only when there are no other options available, such as in the case of a your computer freezing.\nWhat Happens?\n\nIf a computer is improperly shut down, for instance by a power failure, then registry files cease operation while they are still performing a function. This is the main cause of potential problems. Any applications or processes that were running at the time of shut down also will be interrupted and any files that were not saved will be lost.

But it crashed often and that's something that I didn't liked. I was able to run all my files in my terminal without any problem, like my favourite games. And also the executable files. I was able to run them perfectly. \nThen elementary Luna OS came out and I decided to give it a try. When I installed was really quick, but after some days I realized that I couldn't open most of my files on the terminal. Just a few, I can't play games anymore because of that problem. Also, I can't open executable files. \nSo, I decided to reinstall Ubuntu, and guess what? I wasn't able to do nothing! my games and everything, I couldn't open them because the terminal didn't let me. Always displaying the message \"no such file or directory\" while the file actually exist. \nAlso tried in Linux mint, same thing. I've tried everything, can't do anything. Could some of you help me.\nAll of my desktops were x64 bits edition. Right now I'm running Linux mint 16 petra cinnamon desktop x64. \nHow to solve this?\n\nA: Sounds like they don't have executable permissions.

Look for the Terminal and type \ntouch fileName\n\nthen press Enter.\nRemember where you executed the command.

I am running a python program from a terminal in my Ubuntu machine as, \n$ python test.py\n\nBut my whole program will be stopped if I close the terminal, Is there any way of running this python program in the background so that if I close my terminal then it still keeps on running?\nAnd also after running this program in the background, how do I find out my actual program whether it is still running or not if I am logging back again to that terminal?\n\nA: python test.py &\n\nwill run the file in the background.\nIn order to find the running program, you can use ps -e to list all running programs. You can use grep to find your particular program from the list.\n\nA: Use the shebang line in your python script. Make it executable using the command,\nchmod +x test.py\n\nUse no hangup to run the program in the background even if you close your terminal,\nnohup /path/to/test.py &\n\nor simply (without making any change in your program)\nnohup python /path/to/test.py &\n\nDo not forget to use &  to put it in the background.\nRole of nohup: nohup makes your script ignore SIGHUP, and redirects stdout/stderr to a file nohup.out, so that the command can continue running in the background after you log out. If you close the shell/terminal or log off, your command is no longer a child of that shell. It belongs to init process. If you search in pstree you'll see it is now owned by process 1 (init).\nTo see the process again, use in terminal,\nps ax | grep test.py\n\nThat cannot be brought back to the foreground because the foreground (as the terminal already closed) no longer exists. So there is no way to get that terminal back again once it is closed.\n", "Q: Is there a workaround to view Adobe Access (DRM) flash videos on any browser?

That means that your ps and grep is not finding the actual process that you are looking for.\nTry running your script without the trailing \"&\", to see what it is doing. Odds are it's failing quietly on you and not actually starting at all.\nYou can also use the System Monitor tool from the dash to see the full list of processes with process IDs.\n\nA: you can use pkill  to send kill signal same as kill signal \nEg: pkill firefox \npkill -9 firefox\n\n\nA: You can kill with xkill. Just go to the \"run\" dialog (Alt+F2), type in xkill and your mouse pointer will change to an \"x\". Point on the application that you want to kill and click, and it'll be killed. Can sometimes be much quicker than loading the System Monitor.\n\nA: The basic problem is with the command 'ps ax | grep something'.\nThis always lists 'grep ... something' as one of the process, which is in fact the 'grep' started by you.\nuse 'pgrep ' instead to get the pid\nsee: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/74185/how-can-i-prevent-grep-from-showing-up-in-ps-results\n\nA: Best answered here, https://askubuntu.com/a/760514/877732\n\nIf myName is not the process name or for example, is an argument to\nanother (long) command, pkill (or pgrep) might not work as expected.\nSo you need to use the -f option.\n\n", "Q: Youtube going white on ubuntu Whenever I use ubuntu and minimize the youtube videos from full-screen mode, the screen goes white.

I want to upgrade my current O.S. Ubuntu 13.04 to Ubuntu 13.10. For that purpose I created bootable usb stick using unetbootin. When the laptop boots, it boots from the usb. Now after a few steps there comes options as how to install. Here there isn't the option for upgrading ubuntu which is supposed to be there as clear from this installation manual of Ubuntu. For your ease I'm showing the options as mentioned in the manual below. \n\nPlease see the image below that shows what I get when my usb stick boots. It's not having the option for upgrading. ( Also its not having the option for erasing the current O.S. Rather it has option for erasing the whole disk!!! Because of this I can't replace the current Ubuntu 13.04 with 13.10. )\n\nIt may happen that the problem won't be resolved using usb stick. Then tomorrow I will purchase DVD and burn the Ubuntu 13.10 iso image there. DVD should work as earlier also when usb stick didn't work to install my Ubuntu 12.10 then DVD worked perfectly.\nAlso I would like to add how I prepared my usb stick. Using fdisk, I deleted the partition there. I Created only 1 new partition to occupy whole 2GB of space of my usb stick or flash drive whatever you say. Then using mkfs created file system of ext4 type. Then using unetbootin created bootable ubuntu 13.10 from its iso.\nI have a related thread here.\n\nA: Upgrading from the install medium is only available if you have internet access during the install. The source you are referring to had internet access during the install, that is why he had that option. But gaining internet access during install won't help in your case, because you don't want to rely on your not reliable internet connection.\nOfficial source for the above: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/1170531\n\nDimitri John Ledkov (xnox):\nIt is correct, we do not support offline upgrades via ubiquity/desktop CDs. And even for servers, it is not recommended to use new server CD to do offline upgrade.\nThe support upgrade methods are with internet connectivity or a local mirror / package pool. One can for-example use tools like aptoncd to snapshot all installed packages, download them on a machine that has internet connectivity, bring them to the offline machine and upgrade it.\nThe reason behind this move, is enourmous amount of support cases of broken and partial upgrades since newer installation media will be missing manual additionally installed packages; packages that have now transitioned to new names; packages that have been removed from the default installation. Thus default install media for next release simply doesn't contain everything one will reasonably need to upgrade, hence the internet connectivity requirement.\n\n\nA: Make a cd-rom upgrade,if you don't have highspeed internet connection.\nThis and this link will help you.\n\nA: If you want to Upgrade your Ubuntu that installed on a USB Stick i have some suggestion\n1.Upgrade it from a Virtual Machine so the installer won't read any other OS than your USB Stick and the installation media\n2.Install it from a computer with no OS.Boot your Ubuntu Installation media,choose Try ,Then plug your USB that contain your ubuntu that you want to upgrade.Then install just it.open Install Ubuntu XX.XX it's should be located on the Desktop of your Live USB\nN.B. : alternative for second suggestion is,simply unplug your HDD from your computer it's equal with a machine without OS\n\nA: First of all I´m sorry that you don´t have the option to do it via USB, I would like to know if you have an internet connection available to update it through there.\nJust follow the steps:\n1st:\nsudo apt-get install update-manager-core\n2nd:\nsudo apt-get update \n3rd:\nsudo do-release-upgrade -d \nor\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade -d \nand this will update your Ubuntu 13.04 to Ubuntu 13.10.\nHope you find it helpful.\n\nA: That's not an upgrade, it just installs it on a seperate partition on the harddrive along side it. To upgrade login and in a terminal use this command:\n\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n\nA: While this should work, I suspect the upgrade option isn't appearing because the installer (Ubiquity) cannot find the Ubuntu install amongst all those partitions. \nYour other option is to do an online upgrade which is documented at http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/upgrade\n", "Q: How to practice SSH with single Ubuntu system?

One easy way to discover what's your Ubuntu release is by running lsb_release -rc in a terminal.\n\nYou don't have to manually download anything in order to install DupeGuru ME, just add Hardcoded's PPA. Run the following:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:hsoft/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install dupeguru-me\n\nThe correct package and its dependencies will be automatically downloaded and installed, and updates will be offered when available.\n\nA: Quantal is an obsolete version,so you can install DupeGuru Music Edition in any one of these versions Saucy,Raring,Precise.\n", "Q: Battery life becames shorter after upgrading When I was using Xubuntu 12.04 laptop could live 2-3 hours. Now, after installing 13.04 battery life becomes shorter and shorter.\nxfce4-power-manager shows that battery is fully loaded, but after unplugging supplier, notebook works few minutes and goes down.\n\nA: It seems that the blame is not on Ubuntu. If your notebook goes down your battery health has dropped, which is pretty normal.\nMeasure the time your computer run in BIOS. Should not be so different with an idle Session of Ubuntu.\nAlso, check powertop.\n", "Q: Installing Windows 7 after Ubuntu: returning /home to root partition, editing MBR There's nothing to be done, I need a Windows OS for work. The .iso should be ready, thanks to WinUSB.\nI have two questions:\nFirst, the HDD currently has four partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ext4 / (boot)\n\n*/linux-swap\n\n*Ext4 /home\n\n*/ntfs\n\n\nApparently Win7 requires 2 primary partitions, so I assume that I will have to fold /home back in to the root partition. How should I do this?\nSecond, to dual-boot, I understand that I will have to use a Live USB to edit the MBR. How should I do this?\n\nA: Windows 7 does not need two primary partitions. If you are partioning your disk within Windows 7 Installer, it will automatically create two primary partitions for Windows. But if you create your partition yourself, you can still install Windows 7.\nSo if you want to install Windows to your NTFS partition, just boot your computer up with your USB disk and choose the partition when installing.\nThe installer, however, will erase GRUB. If you want to use GRUB for dual-booting (which is a better choice than using Windows bootmgr), you need to re-install GRUB.\nTo re-install GRUB, you could have a look at this question: How can I repair grub? (How to get Ubuntu back after installing Windows?)\n", "Q: Thunar mounts as root I have 4 hard drives. On the first one I have my operating system, that's fine. The others are empty with ext4 file systems. When I try to mount those with thunar (and xubuntu) it mounts those with root owner. Why?\n\nA: Because they are still owned by root. You need to chown the new partitions.\nYou'll want to make sure the partitions are mounted, if you want to mount them at boot, then ensure they are set up in /etc/fstab. \nThe basic syntax for chown being \nsudo chown user:group /path/to/partition\n\nso if you're user/group is bert and the partition is mounted at /mnt/tmp then\nsudo chown bert:bert /mnt/tmp\n\nIf you want to also deal with the access permissions for the partitions then chmod is you're friend.\nTo make the partition read/write/execute for user and group then\nsudo chmod 770 /mnt/tmp\n\nAn excellent source of information for chmod - including a graphic representation tick box - http://ss64.com/bash/chmod.html\n\nA: I found a permissions problem that cause Thunar to mount everything as root.   There is a directory /media/<username>/ that Thunar will attempt to use to mount volumes as your user.   If this volume is not owned by you, it appears that Thunar reverts back to mounting volumes as root in locations such as /media/usb0.\nTo fix this problem, just change the ownership of the directory in question to yourself:\nsudo chown `whoami`:`whoami` /media/`whoami`/\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu on an Eeepc 1005HA netbook? I've been given an old Eeepc 1005HA netbook running Windows XP and want to switch to a Linux OS and remove XP completely. \nIs this easy/advisable? \nWhat's the best way?\nThe netbook has no CD drive I read about installing from USB but then the Ubuntu site mentions using the Windows installer (not sure if this is only applicable if you want to add Ubuntu to XP).\nAlso confused about setting new drive sizes. Device is described as CPU Intel ATOM N280 / 1.66 GHz, RAM 1024 MB.\n\nA: If this old PC supports booting from USB, this is the best way to do it. I'd rather not use WUBI, for it is known to contain lots of bugs.\nThe Ubuntu Website describes how to create a bootable USB stick on Windows. If you've finished creating it, see whether this old computer supports USB Legacy Emulation (have a look in BIOS Setup) or is able to boot from stick natively.\nIf you are able to boot this Live System, you should get a screen like this:\n \nor this:  \n\nNow select Try Ubuntu and wait until you get to the desktop. You can play a bit to see whether you like it or not and can click Install on the desktop to install Ubuntu. The installation offers you to replace XP, to install it alongside XP or to configure everything yourself. From your question I guess that you'd like to replace XP. So select it and let the installation Wizard do the rest.\nWith your PC configuration I'd recommend to get Lubuntu or Xubuntu, which use LXDE or XFCE as desktop environments. Those to environments are designed to be more resource-friendly. I doubt your PC would be able to handle Unity or Gnome, the environments used in default Ubuntu.\nIf you can't boot from USB, you nearly have to use WUBI (although it's not recommended), as long as you don't want to set up a DHCP/tFTP server and try PXE (network booting)...\nHope this can help you.\n\nA: With old netbooks Lubuntu is a great choice. The interface is less pretty then Ubuntu but also takes up less system resources. Lubuntu gave my old Samsung NC10 (similar specs) a new lease of life. You can make a USB installer with he standard method but use the Lubuntu (32bit) iso.\nIn terms of speed on these specs I very much recommend Lubuntu over Ubuntu from my experience.\n", "Q: What package is responsible for webcam detection? I am trying to report a bug but i am unsure about the package to report it under. What package is responsible for the detection of the webcam and creation of /dev/video0 device?\n\nA: you can use this package for webcam detection:\n(Camorama Webcam Viewer)\nyou can install it with this command line:\nsudo apt-get install camorama \n\n", "Q: Howto configure MAAS to separate PXE traffic and IPMI traffic on different subnets? I am trying to set up a part of our network as a linux cluster. Since its a little educational for me, I choose using MAAS with JuJu. However there are some questions that boggle my mind and I was hoping that someone could clarify that for me.\nThe linux cluster I'm about to set up consists of 10 machines. Half of it Dell and the other HP. Both types of machines have a lights-out module (HP=>iLO2, Dell=>DRAC) that support IPMI on a seperate 100Mb NIC. They both support PXE on the first onboard gigabit NIC. I configured the lights out module with a static IP matching the physical layout of the racks and position height. Installing MAAS however didn't ask me on what subnet and vlan the IPMI protocol should be configured. How do I do this?\nAlso I want only the region controller to be able to contact the internet for package management. The other provisioned nodes should only be allowed to connect to the internet via a proxy on the region controller. So the region controller in my case should be configured with 3 subnets; 1 for internet, 1 for client protocol connectivity and 1 for cluster traffic. The region controller itself should also be a node for JuJu.\nThen at last there is the node configuration that should have a sort of basic layout that can be used within JuJu. As far as I could see there is no possibility to set up cluster subnet configuration. Each machine has at least 4 NIC's that I like to assign the different subnets to; 1 for the IPMI traffic, 1 for the PXE boot traffic, 1 for the cluster traffic and 1 for the storage/client network. What I like to do is to bond all these interfaces together as one big trunk and then use VLAN's to separate the traffic before provisioning. Then when provisioning a node, MAAS should automagically configure the network interfaces as the layout suggests above.\nMaybe what I'm looking for is a advanced configuration tutorial/guide for MAAS and JuJu.\nRegards,\nJoham\n\nA: Maybe if you let install of Juju GUI to provide adequately more what type of network balancing you need then you could find your answer faster.  \nUsing Juju with GUI\nThis advanced guides very close to your problem:\nMAAS: Cluster Configuration\nAdditional Manual Configuration\n\nA: Meanwhile I have a better understanding of how networking is arranged in maas and its pretty cool. So to answer my own question: \nI recommend against separating IPMI and PXE traffic. Its more efficient to just share the RAC traffic on eth0. All server can boot PXE default on eth0 too. \nBesides, you don't need an extra ethernet port/switch for just the RAC, and no extra cables, so that is less energy consumption, thus good! You can use shared nic for iDRAC 5+ & ILO2+, iDRAC 6 and higher have shared nic failover, but iLO2 doesn't.\nThe nic interface for PXE traffic is normally selectable in the server boot options. From there you assign the maas cluster controllers network interface. This interface is connected to the machines you like to control on that cluster network. Give them a dynamic range to boot into with DHCP and your a go. In the network tab of the maas webgui menu you will find your first network. You can select if you will, the first interface of each machine on that maas network and create a new maas network to route your other traffic to. \nThanks for the input!\nRegards,\nJoham\n", "Q: Will installing Ubuntu using Wubi have any performance disadvantage compared to a full installation? I wanted to try out Ubuntu. I used Wubi. I really like the appearance and \"feel\" to it, but it is noticeably slower than my Windows 7. I'm wondering if this is because I am using Wubi instead of a disk. Will it be faster if I use Ubuntu from disk and delete Windows?\nI definitely don't want to end up with a slower OS.\n\nA: Ubuntu will be faster if it is installed on the hard disk as a seperate os rather than from wubi also you need not delete win7 you can dual boot your pc until, atleast, you become comfortable with linux \n\nA: \nI'm wondering if this is because I am using Wubi instead of a disk.\n\nYes it is. Wubi is not a regular installation of Ubuntu. It has its disadvantages. It is more like a virtual installation just to see how Ubuntu is and not measure its performance. If you want to see the real performance you have to install Ubuntu on the Hard Disk Drive or even better on a Solid State Drive (if you have). I recently bought one (SSD) and I installed Ubuntu there, well... the speed and desktop responsiveness are awesome !\nWhat I want to say here is that the performance of an operating system is highly-depended on the Read/Write speeds of the media where it is installed. Imagine Windows 7 on a virtual machine or on ext4 filesystem. \nRead more about wubi here. Ubuntu now it is installed as a Windows application (ouch!) rather than a full operating system. \nIn my opinion it would be better to test Ubuntu through a USB-stick (even better USB3.0 if you have) rather than wubi. \n\nA: If u run Ubuntu from a CD then it may run even slower.  But if u install it on ur HDD then it should run great.  Depending on ur computer specs that is.  From what I've seen Ubuntu always runs faster than windows7.\n", "Q: RTL8111/8168B Rev 06 Ethernet controller not working with AMD64 Kernels > 2.6 I'm also having trouble with the RTL8111 Ethernet controller.

kernel version.\n\nA: I had the same problem for years now and with every update that involves a kernel it will reboot with network disconnected, I have it down pat. Turn off the machine, pull the plug , hold the power button for a second or two and try it again. If that fails delete /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules and reboot usually does the trick.\n\nA: Wiggle the cable and force it to the back\nWindows was just fine in connecting to my ethernet and acquiring IP address and internet access. Ubuntu also was connecting just fine at the beginning. After a while when I was booting in Ubuntu I had no network at all even though I still had in Windows.\nI decided to see what happens with the blinking leds in the lan port, because when I was prompting ifconfig eth0 had no IP and no Packet activity.\nThe solution to the problem (which oddly occurred only in Ubuntu) was to wiggle the cable a little bit and forced it a little to the back.\n", "Q: Encrypted home folder and programs working while screen is locked? Is the home folder encrypted while the screen is locked and what happens with programs running in the background that need to access it if it is?\n\nA: Your homedrive gets \"decrypted\" at the time you login. When you lock your screen you're still logged in, so your homedrive is unencrypted and programs wich have the permission to access your homedrive can access it.\n", "Q: Convert docx to PDF I am trying to convert docx files to pdf on my Ubuntu server using the command line but none of converters I tried so far seems to convert Word 2007/2010/2013 files correctly. \nAppearently online converters can manage it without any problems but Web services are not an option because the files contain sensitive data. For tests I use this Word 2007 file because it contains some important elements (formulas, vector graphics, images, lists, etc.). I tested the following tools (partly from this post):\nlowriter  (LibreOffice Writer) - incorrect output (the circle is supposed to be on the last page, not the first one)\n\nunoconv - the same as LibreOffice since it doesn't use its own converter. Converting to odt first and then to pdf messes the file completely up.\nabiword --to=pdf filename.doc - incorrect and incomplete (many elements are missing):\n\nOpenOffice Writer - same result as for abiword\nwvPDF - crash with the following error message:\n\n~$ wvPDF 2007_Office_DocEncryption.docx test.pdf\nCurrent directory: /home/webmt/dev/test/\nSome problem running latex.\nCheck for Errors in test.log \nContinuing... \nConversion into dvi failed\n\nIs there any way to convert docx files to PDF on Linux correctly? It would also help me if I knew it works for someone with any of the programs I already mentioned.\nI will start a bounty as soon as SE lets me.\np.s. I'm using Ubuntu server 12.04\n\nConclusion:\nI had to conclude that as for me, as for now, there is no reliable tool which will work with new MS Word formats and all kind of its elements on Ubuntu and create a one-to-one copy of docx files. None of tools I tested could convert the sample file properly. Since I will be facing very different kind of document versions/contents and the output quality has one of the highest priority, I will end up performing the conversions by means of VB macros in Word on a Windows server connected to my Linux.\nI will set the post getting the best results as the accepted answer. However, the bounty was intended for a solution with absolutely correct conversion. Thanks to everyone, again.\n\nA: If you have Libreoffice installed, you can try to convert using that.  Just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nlibreoffice --headless -convert-to pdf <file_name>.docx -outdir output/path/for/pdf\n\nAnother option is to install Cups PDF.  \nTo do so just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo apt-get install cups-pdf\n\nThen create a new printer, set it as a PDF file printer, and name it whatever you want, as long as you know the name, then run:\noowriter -pt pdf your_word_file.docx\n\nAnd your PDF file will be in ~/PDF.\n\nA: This is a command-line solution that works decently --- but uses proprietary software. \nI think that the basic problem is that Microsoft Word formats are fully understandable just for Microsoft Word (even there, there are differences between versions --- there are Word files from the past that opens incorrectly formatted in newer versions). All the other solutions are approximations and hacks, so they will work or not depending on the file. \nSo to be sure you need to process your .docx files with a Microsoft Word installation (and yes, I think it's their option and it's fair. If you do not want to use Word, don't use it --- I go with LaTeX for my work, but it's difficult to convince the rest of the world around...). \nI am using since ages Crossover for running Microsoft Office in my Linux Desktop (1), finding it quite useful. Maybe it works with wine too --- never tried. \nI do the conversion using this configuration: \n1) I have Crossover installed\n2) I have my version of Microsoft Office installed under Crossover\n3) In Microsoft Word, disable \"background printing\"\n4) I have cups-pdf printer installed and selected as default printer. \n5) To do the conversion, run (hints here): \n~/cxoffice/bin/wine --cx-app winword.exe respondus-docx-sample-file.docx /q /n /mFilePrintDefault /mFileExit\n\n6) Your converted file will appear in ~/PDF/ directory. \nYou document come out almost perfectly (there is some misalignement on answer #2, that are shown in my Office Word 2007 when running under Crossover --- I do not know if it's related to my Windows version). \n\n\nNow, the problem is that the graphic word interface will pop-up --- I do not know how to make it \"headless\". Command line options for Word didn't help...\n(1) I am in no way related to Codeveawers --- just a happy user.\n\nA: This answer passes all tests, but the flow chart one in your test document.\nsudo apt-get install unoconv\ndoc2pdf respondus-docx-sample-file.docx\n\nWhy is this better than other methods suggest thus far?\nI have tested the other methods suggested so far (especially oowriter and ebook-convert), but they pass less tests than this method. The ebook-convert method strips the margins and a part of the texts out of the document.\nThis method even yields better results than a professional converter as rainbowpdf.\nI also tried converting it to html, but the drawing with the square in the circle and the flow chart are incorrect.\nWhy does the flow chart test fail?\nIt seems that libreoffice and unoconv have some problems with correctly rendering the flow chart that is in the .docx file. This is probably because it was made using smart art in Microsoft Office. That is the problem. That is a bug also discussed on this thread. The textual and visual information is present in the pdf resulting from the above method as you can see (I had to select the text, though).\n\nThe font color, for instance, is not properly read and some lines are too long. I am not aware of any linux solution that is able to display smart art correctly. :(\nThis is also the reason why all the print solutions posted on this page will not satisfy you.\nIn short\nIn short, what you are doing is really hard and there are at present no solutions that will fully satisfy you. The achilles' heel of docx2pdf conversions is the smart art. If you can live without that or if you can find a way to spot smart art and convert it somehow into an image, you can reach your goal.\nOption 1. Force your users to deal with the problem\nThis is a very inelegant solution. Your content creators could save their smart art as jpg as described in the office help pages and hence the conversion would be possible on your server.\nOption 2. Hack your way around the problem\nIf the flow charts are often very similar and depending on how good a developper you are, you could try and convert the smart art separately. You could, extract the drawing1.xml file from the .docx cluster of documents and then use natural language processing and some crazy hacks to rebuild a the smart art. For instance, you'd have to mess with this type of xml:\n<dsp:txBody>\n<a:bodyPr spcFirstLastPara=\"0\" vert=\"horz\" wrap=\"square\" lIns=\"8255\" tIns=\"8255\" rIns=\"8255\" bIns=\"8255\" numCol=\"1\" spcCol=\"1270\" anchor=\"ctr\" anchorCtr=\"0\">\n<a:noAutofit/>\n</a:bodyPr>\n<a:lstStyle/>\n<a:p>\n<a:pPr lvl=\"0\" algn=\"ctr\" defTabSz=\"577850\">\n<a:lnSpc><a:spcPct val=\"90000\"/>\n</a:lnSpc>\n<a:spcBef>\n<a:spcPct val=\"0\"/>\n</a:spcBef>\n<a:spcAft>\n<a:spcPct val=\"35000\"/>\n</a:spcAft>\n</a:pPr>\n<a:r>\n<a:rPr lang=\"en-US\" sz=\"1300\" b=\"1\" kern=\"1200\"/>\n<a:t>All three sides are different lengths\n</a:t>\n</a:r>\n</a:p>\n</dsp:txBody>\n\nOr as a minimal solution you at least extract the text (<a:t>?) from the file and save it in an easier way. Or if the flow-charts of your pdfs are all the same, you could write a script to change the text color and the line length in the xml itself. Then you could run doc2pdf and you'd have a file that essentially has all the right info, but maybe not the formatting. In the case of flow charts you'd probably also want to include some of the formatting, because the formatting is part of the info.\nOption 3. Use a third party service\nI have done some more research the past few days and I have found a service that does the conversion perfectly: zamzar. Zamzar allows you to upload a docx file and then emails you a link. They also have a (paying?) service where you can send any file to pdf@zamzar.com and then get the converted file back in your inbox. You could easily build a system around this where you automatically send the file and parse it from the email. This is not so much work and it the end result is the best.\nNotes\n\n*\n\n*If anyone has other services that do the same, please feel free to edit them in.\n\n*I have mailed the zamzar support to ask whether they have an api. That would be even easier.\n\n*Maybe apose for .NET and Java could also help out? Or docx4java as in this very related SO post.\n\n*Another option is to look into the the odf-converter which seems dated and is dependent on openoffice rather than libreoffice.\n\n*I can now confirm that the java jodconverter also suffers fails the flow chart conversion.\n\nI have actually taken the time to test the different methods proposed on this page. Please back any comments up with actual tests.\n\nA: I also had this problem in the past, haven't had to use it lately, so I don't know if it still is affecting me.\nAs for answering the question:\nThis question: How to batch convert .doc or .docx to .pdf gives a reason in the comments why your conversion with lowriter might be failing:\n\nBeware of using \"space\" character from command line... When you get to\n  the space character simply press \"tab\" ;) – Pitto Nov 16 '12 at 13:11\n\nThis question's answer also might possibly help:\nHow can I convert an ODT file to a PDF?\nYou would run libreoffice --headless --convert-to pdf *.odt. You can get more info on libreoffice with the command man libreoffice if you need help understanding or tweaking the command to work.\nHowever, you can't have LibreOffice open at the time, as per this bug: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=37531\n\nThis question is also Ubuntu related, even though it's on SuperUser: https://superuser.com/questions/156189/how-to-convert-word-doc-to-pdf-in-linux\nThe first answer has two options, one using CUPS and creating a PDF printer, the other using LaTex, though you did say that LaTex was failing.\nAs for converting to PDF via CUPS PDF you would run sudo apt-get install cups-pdf followed by oowriter -pt pdf your_word_file.doc(x). This might help with your oowriter issue.\nThis is probably a problem with the fact that you are trying to convert to PDF from DOC/DOCX, when most of the tools use ODT, as they are related to LibreOffice/OpenOffice/AbiWord. Thus, they either fail at trying to convert it from Microsofts DOCX format or in the conversion to ODT. \nThere are several bugs with a conversion from .docx w. Word Art (version is included):\n\n\n*\n\n*https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=33072 - 3.3.0 rc 2 (outdated I believe)\n\n*https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=63289 - 4.0.2.2\n\n*https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=62251 - 4.0.0.3\n\n*https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=65260 - Unspecified\nThis is from the LibreOffice forum regarding conversion from .doc and somewhat .docx: http://en.libreofficeforum.org/node/5096. It's from January of 2013, so it should apply somewhat.\nBeyond all this, I really don't know. Hope you solve your problem!\n\nA: Here is the bitter truth: Office solutions for Linux are total failures! I've been a full-time GNU/Linux user for many years and I've constantly searched and tried different office solutions, from the old Open-Office, to the later Libre-Office, Abi-Word, etc... They have all failed to help me do my office work. It even gets worse when it comes to non-Latin languages (right-to-left languages like Persian, Arabic, etc). The user has to fight with these software to get his/her work done! And Microsoft office compatibility is just not there. I can talk hours and hours of how much I've tried and they have all failed me, but this is not the point of this question.\nI've also tried installing and running Microsoft Office using WINE, and some-how successful but it didn't work-out nice and it mostly crashed when I tried to open my office files.\nLaTeX is fine, but it's not an office solution. LaTeX is for type-setting, and it's more like a pro's tool, and there's no spread-sheets, nor presentations.\nSo what's the solution?\nThis is not a command-line solution. The only solution that I have came up with in all these years, to keep me inside my GNU/Linux OS and also get my office works done, is to use a minimal Microsoft Windows installation in a virtual-machine (like VirtualBox) and install a Microsoft Office suit.\n\nIt might not sound pretty but it's the only solution that works flawlessly and saves me from fighting with bad-office-solutions in my precious time. At first, I myself thought this was not a good solution, but after failing with all the others and doing this VM stuff for more than 2 years, I'm really happy with it  :)\n================================================================================\nNOTE-1: I'm not advertising Microsoft products! Just trying to help solve the problem and move-on with life.\nNOTE-2: As emphasized above, this is NOT a command-line solution. So why post the answer? Because it's a TESTED and WELL-WORKING option!

You might gain a bit in the way of systems administration, but I don't know how much cheaper this would be than chromebooks, and older hardware that could run Lubuntu on it's own might be your best, fastest, and cheapest approach.\n\nA: I just found this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiseat_configuration.

I don't want to just plainly use \"wlan0\" or \"eth0\" or any of that generic crap because some OSes use different names (Like pfSense for example).\n\nA: It depends what you mean by 'active' - if you just want to see the names of all the network devices on the system, you can look at the contents of the /sys/class/net directory e.g.\n$ ls /sys/class/net\neth0  lo  wlan0\n\nTo see the status, you could use the ip command on any link objects - you can parse the output to get the particular fields you want e.g. to see just the device name and state\n$ ip -o link show | awk '{print $2,$9}'\nlo: UNKNOWN\neth0: DOWN\nwlan0: UP\n\nIf you are running a modern desktop version of Ubuntu (with interfaces managed by the network-manager service), then you should be able to get a similar device status list using nmcli\n$ nmcli dev status\nDEVICE     TYPE              STATE\nwlan0      802-11-wireless   connected\neth0       802-3-ethernet    unavailable\n\nor, to limit the output to particular fields in a way that's more easily used in a script\n$ nmcli --terse --fields DEVICE,STATE dev status\nwlan0:connected\neth0:unavailable\n\nIf you are using network-manager, you could also access device and connection properties via DBUS - see for example Dbus Tutorial - Fun with Network Manager\n\nA: You can use ifconfig to detect the active network devices, for a little smaller output use ifconfig -s. ifconfig prints the active interfaces, with -a you can print all interfaces that are recognized by the system as network interfaces.\nOr use ip addr.\n\nA: I may not know the answer directly but I'll give you a list of network commands and maybe from there you can try connecting it with what you need to do. \nTo view networks, and to output the name of active network devices on a single computer, you can try the following commands:\nifconfig\n\nThis command allows us to  detect the active network devices.

I mean, before the actual partition on which windows is installed. I think ubuntu concludes from that, that there isn't any other operating system installed on your hard disk rather than you or someone else (maybe the manufacture) created thise unusual partition table.\nYou have two choices here: If you bought you PC this way then you should keep the current table because that way you have the option of restoring and repairing the windows without using any installation disks. Which is more than just handy. But once you change anything it gets really difficult for you to restore back to that state.\nBut if you or the previous owner messed around here than there is not way around of manually creating an ext4 partition under the 'something else' option. But on the other hand: if ubuntu wasn't able to detect your windows partition before the installation it probably won't detect it while installing and updating the grub2 boot loader. Which means you won't be able to boot you windows at all.\nI would suggest getting yourself some other (newer) version of ubuntu (13.10) and see if this one is able to detect the operating system.\nIf you have another (external) hard drive than also consider installing ubuntu on that one rather then messing around with your preconfigured OEM system.\n\nA: If you made it to the restart part of your ubuntu installation you already finished the setup.

Both of these are just wrappers over the same content so the CPU only needs to do a little work. Don't re encode as you will definitely lose quality.\nIt's very straight forward using ffmpeg:\nffmpeg -i LostInTranslation.mkv -codec copy LostInTranslation.mp4\n\nHere, you are copying the video codec and audio codec so nothing is being encoded.\nTip: To convert all MKV files in the current directory, run a simple loop in terminal:\nfor i in *.mkv; do\n    ffmpeg -i \"$i\" -codec copy \"${i%.*}.mp4\"\ndone\n\nFor future conversions, like from AVI to MP4, check out HandBrake.\n\nA: Here is one you haven't tried.

Eth1 is bridged to br1, which Untangle sees as a WAN. Untangle bridges to br0.\nThat's all working fine. Any new guest that I create will route through Untangle, and my router plugged into eth0 is routing through Untangle.\nHow do I get the host to route through br0/eth0?\nHere's my current routes output with traffic going through eth2 on host:\nKernel IP routing table\nDestination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface\ndefault         76.xx.xx.x      0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth2\n10.10.10.0      *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 br1\n76.xxx.xx.x     *               255.255.248.0   U     0      0        0 eth2\nlink-local      *               255.255.0.0     U     1000   0        0 br0\n192.168.2.0     *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 br0\n192.168.122.0   *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 virbr0\n\n\nA: I know this is old, but I have accomplished it before in a different way.\nFirst of all, I would setup eth2 on a bridge (call it br_wan) and NOT configure it on the host (so the host will not see any traffic arriving on that port or on the bridge). Share  br_wan with the guest and configure it as the wan port. No need to make the traffic go to the host just to have it forward it to the guest. Also, if you route wan through the host you may loose a lot, Untangle will not know the public IP address because the DHCP client will be running on the host which is something you probably do not want. And it is a bit less safe.\nCreate another bridge, you can call it br_net and that is the interface on\nUntangle where all the other Guests and the host will connect to. It does not\nneed to be attached to a physical interface but it can be if you wish.\nConfigure the host to get its IP from the br_net interface, and configure\nthe gateway on that interface so the host will have its default route going\nthrough the br_net interface.\nI must say I started with a solution just like that but ended up choosing\nto handle all firewalling on the host with the help of Shorewall. My rule now as\nfar as firewalling goes is to use UFW if the setup will not forward packets\nand use Shorewall is the setup will forward packets. Shorewall is really awesome,\nvery easy to learn and very powerful.\n", "Q: Downloading files with w3m I'm trying to acess my emails attachements using ̀w3m.

I don't know if I should post another thread or what. I'm simply trying to make my external webcam my default webcam. I have Gstreamer installed (pictured) I have multimedia systems selector installed. I have default settings in Multimedia systems selector to set at Webcam c920, and yet when I open video chat or GUVC, it opens laptop cam.\nI got some help on this, and I followed through. But I still can't seem to get it to work. Does anyone have any ideas, or should I post somewhere else? Thanks\n\nA: I don't know if its the best way, but with the same webcam and problem I found using the command sudo rm /dev/video0 removes my webcam. It is gone till reboot. You may have to cd /dev and make sure your webcam is video0 my c920 is video3.\n\nA: Based on the answer from @hopeithelps, it seems that programs take /dev/video0 to be the default webcam.  On my system, /dev/video0 is initially the integrated camera, while /dev/video1 appears/disappears automatically when the external webcam is attached/detached.\nSo I just wrote a simple command to set /dev/video0 to point to the \"best available camera\" -- the webcam if it's present, and the integrated camera otherwise.  At present I have to invoke this script manually after plugging/unplugging the webcam.  However, the microphone automatically switches to the \"best microphone\" because I followed this askUbuntu answer.  \n\nRant: Shouldn't Ubuntu have a unified approach to hot-plugging of display, camera, speaker, microphone (and also keyboard, mouse, MIDI, ...?).  All these things seem to require separate tinkering.  I think gnome-display-manager has the ideal design: it remembers my old settings when I plug in a display I've used before.  \n\nHere's the script:\n#!/bin/bash\n# Make default camera /dev/video0 point to the \"best\" camera present.\n\nif [ -h /dev/video0 ]; then \n   sudo rm /dev/video0   # not first run: remove our old symlink\nelif [ -e /dev/video0 ]; then\n   sudo mv /dev/video0 /dev/video0.original   # first run: rename original video0\nfi \nif [ -e /dev/video1 ]; then\n   sudo ln -s /dev/video1 /dev/video0   # symlink to video1 since it exists\n   echo \"Set default camera /dev/video0 --> external camera /dev/video1\"\nelif [ -e /dev/video0.original ]; then  # symlink to video0.original otherwise\n   sudo ln -s /dev/video0.original /dev/video0\n   echo \"Set default camera /dev/video0 --> integrated camera /dev/video0.original\"\nelse\n   echo \"Sorry, does this machine have no camera devices?\"\n   ls -l /dev/video*\nfi\n\nTested with guvcview and Google Hangouts, using two different Logitech webcams.  I am running Ubuntu 13.10 (actually Mint Petra) on a Thinkpad T530i.\nYou may have to edit the script if your webcam appears as /dev/video3 or something, as it does for @hopeithelps.  (Perhaps I should have made it choose the /dev/video* device that has the most recent timestamp ...)\n\nA: First you need to install the application Multimedia Systems Selector\nsudo apt-get install gnome-media dpkg gconf-service gconf2 gstreamer0.10-gconf gstreamer0.10-plugins-base gstreamer0.10-plugins-good libatk1.0-0 libc6 libgconf-2-4 libglib2.0-0 libgnome-media-profiles-3.0-0 libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-0 libgstreamer0.10-0 libgtk-3-0 x11-utils\n\nThen open it and in its Video section, you can change the default webcam.\n** This application can be opened with Terminal by running:\nsudo gstreamer-properties\n\n\nA: If Jason Eisner's answer doesn't work, manually doing might work (it worked for me). I used zzu's answer, and it worked like a charm.\n\nFYI I fixed this by doing the following:\n# mv /dev/video0 /dev/video0.original\n# ln -s /dev/video2 /dev/video0\n\nIn my case, /dev/video2 was the \"standard\" webcam. YMMV and some trial\nand error may be required.\n\n\nA: I have set this keyboard shortcut to switch between my laptop and monitor webcam.\nbash -c 'if [[ -c /dev/video2 ]]; then sudo mv /dev/video0 /dev/video01 && sudo cp -a /dev/video2 /dev/video02 && sudo mv /dev/video2 /dev/video0; else sudo mv /dev/video01 /dev/video0 && sudo mv /dev/video02 /dev/video2; fi'\n\n\nA: I think I have a solution. I don't know if you can get your laptop's own camera to work again, but at least I was able to make a USB as default.\nI did it like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo rm /dev/video0\nAfter this I couldn't start Camorama Webcam Viewer at all.\n\n*sudo chmod -R 777 /dev\nThis gives you permission to change file names\n\n*mv /dev/video1 /dev/video0\nThis renames your usb camera to dev0\n\n\nAfter that I was able to see my USB camera automatically when I opened Camorama Webcam Viewer. I hope this helps.\n", "Q: Meaning of files in /var/log/lightdm/ and how to properly read lightdm.log file? Tracking the slowdowns in the system, I was advised to check the files in the folder /var/log/lightdm/. There I see 4 files as on the image. What logs are recorded in each of them?\n\nThe other question is how to properly read file lightdm.log? It's content looks like this\n[+0.00s] DEBUG: Logging to /var/log/lightdm/lightdm.log\n[+0.00s] DEBUG: Starting Light Display Manager 1.8.4, UID=0 PID=1155\n[+0.00s] DEBUG: Loading configuration from /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/10-ubuntu.conf\n[+0.00s] DEBUG: Loading configuration from /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-greeter-wrapper.conf\n[+0.00s] DEBUG: Loading configuration from /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-guest-wrapper.conf\n[+0.00s] DEBUG: Loading configuration from /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-unity-greeter.conf\n[+0.00s] DEBUG: Loading configuration from /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-xserver-command.conf\n[+0.00s] DEBUG: Loading configuration from /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\n[+0.00s] DEBUG: Using D-Bus name org.freedesktop.DisplayManager\n[+0.00s] DEBUG: Registered seat module xlocal\n...\n[+4.52s] DEBUG: Session pid=1262: Logging to .xsession-errors\n[+4.53s] DEBUG: Activating VT 7\n\nIs this file being regenerated each time I log into the desktop? Or data is being appended to the file?\n\nA: Read this Q&A if you want more info on the boot/login process.\nlightdm.log is the log file where your display manager (also called login manager) lightdm write its messages. \nAfter lightdm started the X-server, the X's first and last messages (like a header and a footer) will go into x-N.log, where N represents the display, just like in /var/log/Xorg.N.log which is the log file for the other messages from X.\nThe x-N-greeter.log file is the log file where the greeter (on ubuntu it is unity-greeter) messages are written, N again represents the display number.\nYou should start with lightdm.log and read it sequentially, and you will see that is is always reported when and where newer log files are created, e.g.:\n[+0.22s] DEBUG: Logging to /var/log/lightdm/lightdm.log\n...\n[+0.31s] DEBUG: Logging to /var/log/lightdm/x-0.log\n...\n[+0.87s] DEBUG: Logging to /var/log/lightdm/x-0-greeter.log\n\nYes, those log files are regenerated on every reboot, but the previous log is saved with the .old suffix.\n", "Q: How do I generate a list of packages added since installation A number of useful pages show how to generate a list of all installed packages, eg\nHow do I generate a package download list?\nIs there a way to restrict the generated list to those I have added since system installation?\nThat is, excluding all the packages that were installed from the ISO? and excluding any updates to those packages? Diffing the list generated from the link above with the ISO manifest doesn't quite work because some of the packages in the manifest (eg drivers) are dependent on the hardware and the user selections at install time (eg language).\nWhat I'm looking for is a list of what I have added to the base system.\n\nA: See the answer to How to view a list of packages that were manually installed without their dependancies.\nYou can list the apt-get command-line commands you have typed since installation of Ubuntu with:\ncat /var/log/apt/history.log | grep 'apt-get install '\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu cgroup architecture: cgroup-lite vs cgroup-bin and default config for lxc, libvirt-bin? It seems that (at least in Ubuntu 12.04 Precise), the cgroup-lite package is used to provide some cgroup capabilities for packages like libvirt-bin and lxc.  It sets up a number of cgroups in /sys/fs/cgroup for example.\nI was reading the very nice documentation on cgroups for redhat and I wanted to use some of the other cgroup commands that are only in cgroup-bin.  But when I installed that, /sys/fs/cgroup became empty, presumably because the cgroup-lite package was uninstalled since it conflicts with cgroup-bin.\nWhat am I missing after having done this?  Is there a way to get the same default set of cgroups that cgroup-lite sets up?  Is there any documentation for the cgroup definition that cgroup-lite provides?\nThe lxc documentation in the server guide talks a bit about cgroup-lite, but seems to assume that cgroup-lite will be installed, which won't be true if either recommended packages are skipped, or the alt]ernative, cgroup-bin, is installed. \n\nA: You can get the same cgroup management files just by adding the /cgroup mount to your fstab:\ncgroup          /cgroup         cgroup  defaults        0       0\n\nThe files end up in a slightly different location. With cgroup-lite, you will end up with paths like /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/cpu.shares, whereas with the fstab method you'll get /cgroup/cpu.shares.\nThe cgroup-lite package itself is just providing an init script to mount those control directories if they don't yet exist via fstab or some other means.\n", "Q: Unable to boot from USB drive I am trying to boot Ubuntu 13.10 from a USB Drive. I was expecting a regulation procedure: BIOS>BOOT-order-tweak>boot-from-USB. But it didn't work. I recently upgraded from a 7 year old laptop, and am not familiar with either UEFI or SecureBoot or how these change anything. From first impressions of what research i could do, the combination of said unfamiliar standards help avoid malware from doing there thing, help Windows to boot super fast and are compatible with newer versions of popular Linux distributions. So ideally one should be able to boot into described Linux distro from USB w/o disabling SecureBoot or enabling Legacy anything. The problem seems quite trivial, as it is not being discussed at all.

I want to \"replace\" my preinstalled LibreOffice 3 with LibreOffice 4.1 but I want it to be stable and I don't want to update to unstable newer versions (but maybe to stable newer ones if possible automatically).\nIs it correct to do it like this step by step: (https://launchpad.net/~libreoffice/+archive/libreoffice-4-1)\nIn terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/libreoffice-4-1\nsudo apt-get update\n\nthe update is not only an update for libreoffice 4.1 but for all available Ubuntu programs? And it also just gets updates and will not get newer unstable LO versions correct?\n\nA: Welcome to Ask Ubuntu! Actually, sudo apt-get update doesn't upgrade the software that's installed, it just checks the software servers for new versions. sudo apt-get upgrade is what actually upgrades the software.\nRead this question here, it should help you understand better: What does \"sudo apt-get update\" do?\nFrom the question: \n\napt-get update doesn't actually install new versions of software.\napt-get update downloads the package lists from the repositories and\n  \"updates\" them to get information on the newest versions of packages\n  and their dependencies. It will do this for all repositories and PPAs.\n  From http://linux.die.net/man/8/apt-get:\n\nUsed to re-synchronize the package index files from their sources. The indexes of available packages are fetched from the\n    location(s) specified in /etc/apt/sources.list(5). An update should\n    always be performed before an upgrade or dist-upgrade.\n\napt-get upgrade will fetch new versions of packages existing on the machine if APT knows about these new versions by way of apt-get\n  update.\n\nAs for the steps you took, they are correct as far as I can tell. You add the PPA, then run sudo apt-get update to check for updates available, and then sudo apt-get upgrade to download/install the updates.\n\nA: I Think you method for adding repositories will work, though I prefer the old fashioned method of adding the repo location to the sources-list file \"/etc/apt/source.list \" you can find a step by step method here.  \nThe method that you are speaking of is also documented on the same page under: #Adding_Launchpad_PPA_Repositories.  It was introduced in 9.10 it seems, though I don't have any direct experience using it.  \nI have not tested it myself, but have seen several mixed reviews regarding that specific repository and method.  So this is very much a try at your own risk operation.  I would probably stick with the Official Ubuntu repositories if you want things to be guaranteed to be stable.  If you need some functionality that you can't get from the version available on those repo's try following up with that question. \nAs far as:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThat is just updating the list of packages. You will also need to run: \nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nin order to complete the 'upgrade' process.   You can find this and more on APT by typing:\nman apt\n\nHope that helped, cheers. \nhelp.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/CommandLine#Adding_Launchpad_PPA_Repositories\nask.libreoffice.org/en/question/20804/libreoffice-4-1-ppa-for-ubuntu-1204-the-requested-url-returned-error-404/\nlinux.die.net/man/8/apt-get\n\nA: Yes, it is perfectly fine to add that ppa that way.\nAdd the ppa:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/libreoffice-4-1\n\nYou update the packagelists stored on your computer with \nsudo apt-get update\n\nAfter that you upgrade the actual packages with\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nThis last command will upgrade all installed packages on your computer for which the freshly downloaded (with the apt-get update command) packagelists report that there are newer versions. \nThis libreoffice ppa only contains stable releases from the 4.1.x branch. So by running apt-get upgrade your libreoffice won't be updated to any unstable release, neither will it be updated to the 4.2 branch, but it will update e.g from 4.1.4 to 4.1.5.\nSome other ubuntu packages will also be updated to newer versions from this ppa, because libreoffice 4.1 needs newer versions from them. There is a small chance that these newer packages will cause problems with other programs relying on the same packages with the older version, but it is unlikely, and even if it happens you just have to revert back to the original LO version.

I had been using Bumblebee until software updates indicated the video adapter control it was providing was supposed to be now handled in the kernel. The problem described above started occurring about that time.

Use janitor service from Ubuntu Tweak to clean your system(including the package configurations) and after that reinstall SMPlayer from Ubuntu Software Center. Did it right now and I was able to download subtitles again. It worked for me. Hope it works for others too!\n\nA: The solution is:\nInstall, then open synaptic package manager. Go to Settings/repositories. Then to Other software. Then add: ppa:rvm/smplayer\nthen close, then refresh. then search for smplayer... mark everything for upgrade...you are installing the latest version of smplayer..,.You will have no problems.\n\nA: Does the problem persists? The subtitles SMplayer downloads are from opensubtitles.org and sometimes, when the site is down, the service doesn't work.

You have what is known as fakeraid, which is just software raid that is implemented in a special driver to lie to Windows, and bios extensions to support the boot loader.  Linux has no hacked up driver to do this, so the actual drives show up, but are also recognized by the dmraid package, which configures the device-mapper driver to perform the software raid functions.  Ignore the individual drives, and the array should show up as /dev/mapper/something when you have the dmraid package installed.  If you didn't install ON the raid array, then the dmraid package is not installed by default, so you will need to install it ( sudo apt-get install dmraid ).  In order to resync the array now that it is mucked up, you will need to look for an option in the bios to scrub or resync the array, and boot into Windows until it is done, as this is generally not supported by dmraid.\n", "Q: broadcom BCM4311 wirless problems with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS I recently installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on my Dell D430 to replace an old version of Ubuntu.

Sysinfo is a graphical tool that is able to display some hardware and software information about the computer it is run on. In the CPU category, Sysinfo displays vendor identification, model name, frequency, number of cores, number of threads, level2 cache, bogomips, model numbers and flags.\nYou can view real time information about what each one of your CPU threads is doing in the System Monitor application in the Resources tab under the CPU History heading.

Windows bootmgr is less configurable and more difficult to configure than GRUB. But if you insist, you can try EasyBCD to save your life from struggling with bcdedit or other Windows command line tools.\nSince you want to use bootmgr, you may install Linux first and Windows last.\nIf you have previously installed some OSes (boot loaders) on this hard disk, you'd better erase them first.\nBoot your computer up with Ubuntu Live USB / CD and determine which is your hard disk by lsblk and erase any footprints left by previously installed boot loaders (if any) with head -c 2M /dev/sda. (If your hard disk is different from /dev/sda remember to change it.)\nNow you can partiton your disk with fdisk /dev/sda.\nLet's assume you have divided your hard disk into three partitions, ordered in MBR (Booting Windows with GPT requires UEFI, which is a stupid restriction put by Windows installer):\n\n/dev/sda1\n/dev/sda2\n/dev/sda3\n\nYou do not have to format them since the installers will format them.\nNow you can install Ubuntu within your live session. Remember to choose /dev/sda2 manually.\nAfter installing Ubuntu you can install 4MLinux in /dev/sda3.\nBoth Linux distributions will install GRUB to /dev/sda (notice the difference), but Windows installer will erase it anyway.\nNow you can install Windows to /dev/sda1 and the installer will automatically format it as NTFS and install Windows bootmgr.\nAfter installation of Windows, your computer can only boot into Windows. Here comes EasyBCD for help. Use it to add two more entries (Ubuntu in /dev/sda2 and 4MLinux in /dev/sda3) to BCD.\nReboot and enjoy your boot menu in bootmgr.\n\nA: Completely erasing the hard disk is overkill for your purposes. If you want to start fresh for purposes of installing new OSes, wiping the partition table should be sufficient. You can do this with any decent partitioning software, such as parted, GParted, or gdisk. (fdisk will also work, but only if you want to use MBR partitions and if the disk did not use GPT before. If you use any but the very latest version of fdisk on a GPT disk, the result will be incomplete removal of the GPT partition data.) The details depend on the program, but in general, you want to use whatever option it provides to create a new partition table. In parted this would be mklabel and in both gdisk and fdisk it's o, for instance. In any event, this operation makes the disk look blank to OS installers and other tools, but most of the data on the disk remains intact. Recovering it becomes increasingly more difficult as you repartition and use the disk, though.\nCompletely erasing the hard disk can be useful for security purposes -- say, if you're selling a used disk and you want to wipe it clean to ensure that the buyer can't recover your personal data from it. To do this, you can use dd, as in:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb\n\nThis example completely wipes all data from /dev/sdb. Note that this operation will take several hours on a big disk.\n", "Q: `history` command failed to store the previously entered command Any command(which maybe right or wrong) entered in the terminal are stored in the ~/.bash_history file and later these commands are displayed using history command.\nBut history command failed to store previously entered sudo!! and ^bad^good commands.Instead of storing sudo!!,^bad^good commands,it stores it's functions.\nFor example,\nsudo apt-gat update\n^gat^get\n\nAfter that,the output of history command as,\nsudo apt-gat update\nsudo apt-get update\nhistory\n\nWhat was the reason for this?\n\nA: In the below example,\nsudo apt-gat update\n^gat^get\n\n^gat^get is a shortcut to replace the gat in the previous command with get and then run the corrected command.\navinash@avinash-Lenovo-IdeaPad-Z500:~$ sudo apt-gat update\n[sudo] password for avinash:    \nsudo: apt-gat: command not found\n\navi@avi-Lenovo-IdeaPad-Z500:~$ ^gat^get\nsudo apt-get update \nIgn http://mirror.sov.uk.goscomb.net saucy InRelease\nIgn http://liveusb.info all InRelease \n\nIn the above second block of code you see the corrected command sudo apt-get update and then it runs.\nSo the history command displays the wrong command sudo apt-gat update then the corrected command sudo apt-get update as in the order.It won't displays ^gat^get because it was an shortcut.\n", "Q: System-Settings option is missing \nI no longer get the system-settings option on my ubuntu 12.04.

You have two 1333MHz cards and one 1600MHz card.\nIn theory this can work by downclocking the 1600 but this can cause issues. \nSecondly  your board wants to run dual channel, so you need to fill either 2 or 4 slots not 3. \nI would take out the Kingston 1600MHz stick and try with just the other two. Make sure they are correctly placed (not necessarily next to each other, put them in the same colour slots).\nIf this works and gives you 4GB RAM, then you can try to fill the other two, a matching Kingston stick with he current Kingston stick may work, but everything matching is best.\nIf it will show 4GB RAM, then you can also try and take out the cards and put the 1600MHz to see if it's not dead or something. \n", "Q: How do I get my Acer C720 to boot into 12.04 Cinnamon on startup?

Is it just business and servers, or is it now casual users, home users and students as well?\nOn the other hand, since the regular releases are not as major as they used to be, would they be safe for students and casual users? Could a someone depend on their laptop day in and day out on a regular release?\nWhat are the Pros and Cons of each now?\nSpecifically I ask because I'm an engineering and physics student. I do a lot of programming, CAD (VMWared SolidWorks), and writing (LaTeX). I want to know whats best for me since I can't have my computer unstable.\n\nA: Ubuntu 14.04 will be the last release to completely rely on x-org. Subsequent versions of Ubuntu will be replaced by Mir (Canonicals own display server). The road will be bumpy and expect jerks and crashes for the post 14.04 releases. Although x-org will still be there for legacy applications, it will be systematically removed from Ubuntu in later releases.\nAnother major change the post LTS releases will see is the introduction of Unity 8. Now if you remember the early days of Unity(11.04) then expect at least 2-3 releases for Canonical to figure out and squash all the major bugs.\nVerdict: Upgrade to Ubuntu 14.04 and stick to it for at least a couple of later releases. Let Canonical work on the major bugs and jump ship when the general community consensus seem that Unity and Mir is stable.\n", "Q: Installation of ubuntu as only OS on ASUS X402CA I just got an ASUS X402CA; it has UEFI and secure boot.

I also wanted my launcher to be on the monitor to my left but have the game on my monitor to the right (which full screen doesn't allow you to do.)\nThe only draw back so far is that I cannot get the window to draw over Unity's menubar at the top so you end up sacrificing 20px in height.\nThe solution for me was to set the following launch options in steam.\n\n\n*\n\n*Right Click Dota2 in your steam library\n\n*Click Set Launch Options\n\n*Add the following -h 1180 -w 1920 -x 1280 -y 0 -noborder\n\n\n*\n\n*-w should be the width of the monitor you want it on\n\n*-h should be height of the window, I couldn't get rid of the menubar so I subtracted it's height (20px for me) from the height of the game.\n\n*-x should be the offset of your second monitor (my second monitor is 1280px wide\n\n*-y is the offset from the top, since the menu bar isn't taken into account I set this to 0, it may not even be required to include\n\n*-noborder should indicate to dota that the game should be launched as a bordless window but it didn't so I had to do steps 7 through 10.

CSM or UEFI? As far as I have heard, dual booting (Ubuntu and Windows) in UEFI isn't very clean, and hence people prefer CSM when doing so. But, in case my laptop has Windows pre-installed in UEFI, I need to reinstall it to get it in CSM.\nNow, my laptop's boot menu has an option of UEFI and CSM. What could this option mean? Does it mean I can dual boot without any hassles?\n\nA: Each firmware can be different, but generally this option means that your firmware will first try to boot in UEFI mode (it will search for .efi files corresponding to your UEFI entries), then if it fails to boot in UEFI mode it will try to boot in Legacy mode.\n\nA: dual boot windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 14-10\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Windows 8.1\n\n*Install Ubuntu\n\n*Restart\n\n*Your computer will no show you the option to select the operating system that you want to boot. Don't worry, boot into Ubuntu\n\n*Open a terminal\n\n*Run de following command update-grub\n\n\nEnjoy your dual boot!\n\nA: Dual-booting Windows and Linux in EFI mode can be done in a perfectly \"clean\" way. In fact, it's got some advantages over BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. The main troubles with EFI-mode dual-boot setups are with buggy firmware and with a lack of user understanding of the issues. The firmware bugs are being slowly resolved, but there are still too many problems. (Sometimes upgrading the firmware will help.) User understanding can be acquired by reading appropriate sites. Two I recommend are:\n\n\n*\n\n*My page on Linux EFI installations\n\n*The Ubuntu UEFI wiki page\n\nA: \nAs far as I have heard, dual booting (Ubuntu and Windows) in UEFI isn't very clean\nI need to reinstall it to get it in CSM.\n\nThis is not true.\nAs @RodSmith already said, there are firmware bugs or seemingly deliberate faulty implementations. The device manufacturers are to blame for this, not Microsoft! (If you're blaming Microsoft and do nothing against the bad firmware from device manufacturers things will remain as they currently are.)\nIn case of these issues I was always able to boot from the UEFI loader for removable media.\nAlso you don't have to reinstall an operating system just for changing the way it boots. You can setup a BIOS Boot Partition on an existing Windows 8 installation or you install GRUB to a GRUB BIOS Boot Partition to enable legacy booting. I wrote what can be done from a perspective of legacy booting (MBR) and Windows 8 (GPT):\n\n*\n\n*Is it still possible to install Ubuntu to an external harddrive with UEFI?\nThe topic is actually trivial from a consumer perspective. As it should be.\nWhere does the confusion come from?\nIt's the golden hammer.\nWhile I understand that people would want a tool like boot-repair, I also want them to read the collection of shell scripts it consists of and tell me that this is well written and documented code (which coding style?) before demanding inclusion in Ubuntu and on the live media, where maintainers would have to maintain the code and possibly improve the existing resolution strategies it uses.\nOf course, I know who the author is and it's nothing personal.\n", "Q: Ghosts haunt my Unity Dash!

There is no option to have it switched on at boot.\nSo, my question is, since there appears to be no resolution for this directly, as in having Ubuntu being able to hardware unblock it, is there a way to map the FN key the laptops' built in keyboard had, to my USB keyboard, and how. Or is there a way to access the built in media \"buttons\" (the strip across the top of the laptop) to be able to have Ubuntu recognise the WiFi \"button\" (if it is indeed a \"button\")?\nThanks.\n\nA: So, maybe I'll get to delete my answer in deference to someone more knowledgeable, but my understanding...\nYou can't remap the fn key\n\n\n*open a terminal and run xev\n\n*mash on your fn key\n\n\nMy understanding is that fn's signal is never sent to the os. Rather, it modifies the signals that other keys send. I'm wrong if xev shows anything in response to your mashing.\nWith this premise, I'll guess that fn+wifi sends a signal directly to your hardware to toggle your wifi card off and on. Running windows or linux or whatever isn't ever going to affect this cause and effect relationship.\nHowever, you may be able to remap an fn combo like fn+wifi.\nEnable disabled hardware from the OS layer\nI don't have a clue on this part of your question. If you could do it windows (mind, without using the keyboard..), then theoretically it's possible in linux. You just need to hope the kernel module supporting your wifi card supports this, and then that someone has written ui software to take advantage of the feature.\nIf this is the core of your question, then it might be a duplicate of this one: Unblocking hardware switch Wifi\n\nA: I realise this is an old post but my answer might help others. I broke my keyboard and use a usb keyboard now. The problem I had was that the wifi toggle was last 'off' before the keyboard stopped working. I fixed the problem by going into the bios (I had to pres ESC and then F10 on my laptop but it depend on what computer you have). I then pressed F9 to reset the values to default. F10 to exit and save. This set the switch back to the default postion of on and now my problem is fixed!

While copying the system froze, to the point where I couldn't even move the cursor.\nI managed to log into the text console, and ran iotop, it showed that a process named kswapd0 was taking 99.99% of IO.\nAre there workarounds so copying a large file doesn't make my system unusable?\n\nA: I am experiencing a similar issue with the system freezing when copying to a flash drive. I submitted a bug report about it: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1267648\nAs workaround I found that disabling swap completely eliminates the problem.\n\nA: Yes,  there are kernel settings you can tweak specifying how much data has to be marked as written before it actually gets written to disk.  Look here for a pretty comprehensive description of them. In particular, you'll want to find a value of dirty_ratio that works well for you (it's generally too high for desktop/laptop by default, but there's no one magic number that works for everyone).\n\nA: I have just had exactly the same problem (in 2019), on ubuntu 19.10, while copying large number of files from USB disk to the SATA disk. Both filesystems are ext4. When I turned off the swap, the problem disappeared. It looks like some bug in memory allocation for disk buffers - apparently, the kernel tries to allocate as much memory for disk buffers, as possible in such situation, which doesn't make sense (making disk buffers in swap...), or it just wrongly calculates the memory size than can be used for caching...\nAs someone pointed out, setting swappiness to 1 doesn't solve the problem, which is logical, if the files you copy have total size more, than the RAM size...\nBy the way - can anybody explain, WHY turning off the swap is not recommended? If I have 32GB of RAM, what difference does it make to add another 4GB of swap? I can only think of some obscure applications that actually expect the swap to be there. But I would just stop using such application, since properly written one shouldn't care about swap. The swap should only be managed on the OS level...\n\nA: According to this bug report I solved it adding following lines\nvm.dirty_background_ratio = 5\nvm.dirty_ratio = 10\n\ninto /etc/sysctl.conf\nand running \nsudo sysctl -p\n\n\nA: As an experiment, I've set sysctl.conf to: \nvm.dirty_background_ratio=1\nvm.dirty_ratio=2\n\nand this solved the problem. Previous values 5/10 didn't help. Looks like everybody should play with those params to find the best one.  Copying of 12 GB file from SSD to pen flash drive took about 15 min without system hangups (USB 2.0). Probably I'll check values 2/4, etc after several days of testing.\nSystem: Ubuntu 19.10, i7, 8GB Ram, SSD.\n\nA: Turning off swap while copying worked for me.\nsudo swapoff -a\n\nAfter the copying is done, I turn on the swap\nsudo swapon\n\nEdit: Do note, as Robby1212 mentions in the comment, that swapping off is dangerous and should be done after you have tried out the other answers. I am fortunate that nothing has happened to me when I swap off. I only swap off during copying large files.\n\nA: I ran into the similar issue. Mine is 64 bit Ubuntu 14.04. So After a long struggle I found a answer which solves my issue. For easy use I added the commands below used in that above mentioned answer. Check the answer for detailed explanation.\necho $((16*1024*1024)) > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_background_bytes\necho $((48*1024*1024)) > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_bytes\n\nAfter using the above command system started to work normally on copying files. \nThanks goes to @Rmano.\n\nA: in Ubuntu 19.10 this problem happens due to problem with swap management . Tinkering with dirty_background broke my nautilus file explorer . \nAlong with freezing when copying large files , i have encountered several performance issues due to bad swap management in 19.10 . Since completely disabling swap is not recommended and we can control the degree of writing into swap partition by setting swappiness . \n\nswappiness=0 tells the kernel to avoid swapping processes out of physical memory for as long as possible .\n  swappiness=100 tells the kernel to aggressively swap processes out of physical memory and move them to swap cache \n\nso , we are going to set swappiness =1 .\n\nTo change the swappiness value A temporary change (lost on reboot) with a swappiness value of 1 can be made with\n\nsudo sysctl vm.swappiness=1\n\nTo make a change permanent, edit the configuration file with your favorite editor:\n\nsudo gedit /etc/sysctl.conf\n\nSearch for vm.swappiness and change its value as desired. If vm.swappiness does not exist, add it to the end of the file like so:\n\nvm.swappiness=1\n\nSave the file and reboot. \n\nThis helped me to improve overall performance issues in Ubuntu 19.10 while disabling swap completely eliminated all performance issues that i had with 19.10 but still i won't recommend doing that in normal situations .\n\nA: I had similar problems when copying files to an exfat drive.

The same holds for the settings, which are kept in a folder of the same name under ~/.matlab/. This way it is possible to use in parallel two or more different versions of Matlab.\nThe \"command\" matlab is usually a symbolic link in /usr/local/bin/ which points to the actual binary, e.g.\n/usr/local/bin/matlab -> /opt/MATLAB/R2013a/bin/matlab\n\nIf you want to start another version, you have to type the full pathname of the executable at the command line, e.g.\n$ /opt/MATLAB/R2012b/bin/matlab\n\nIf you only want to use the new version though, I'd recommend to uninstall the old version first. Uninstallation is done by deleting the installation directory with all its contents, and all the symbolic links pointing into that directory in /usr/local/bin/.

I have formatted it as ext4.\nI currently mount / (on my SSD) and /home (bcache) using these fstab options\n# / (root) -> /dev/sda2 (SSD)\nUUID={uuid for /dev/sda2}   /  ext4  discard,noatime,nodiratime,errors=remount-ro   0  1\n\n# /home -> { /dev/bcache0 -> { /dev/sda3 -> /dev/sdb3 } }\nUUID={uuid for /dev/bcache0}  /home  ext4  defaults   0  2\n\nWhat I am wondering is if any mount options (e.g. discard (TRIM), noatime, etc) are useful when mounting bcache, or if bcache its self takes care of optimising the filesystem for the SSD and HDD partitions.\nPlease let me know if I have not made my question clear, thanks.\n\nA: discard is a special case: bcache will (I think) make use of it to discard sectors, but won't pass it down the stack unless you have explicitly asked it to (echo 1 |sudo tee -a /sys/block/*/bcache/discard, which will be remembered across reboots). The best case for performance is that your filesystem sends discards (which means you need to put the flag in /etc/fstab) and bcache passes them down if and only if your SSD is SATA 3.1 (queued TRIM support).\nYour filesystem is able to detect bcache as something like an SSD (rotational=0 in sysfs), which it may use to tune itself a bit differently.  Aside from discard and noatime, I don't think there's a real need to stray from ext4 defaults.\n\nA: If you put discard in the fstab mount arguments for a filesystem on a bcache device, then the filesystem will issue TRIM commands to bcache for deleted blocks. In theory bcache could use incoming TRIM commands as hints for freeing cached data, but I don't think it does, and there are hints searching online that bcache doesn't understand incoming TRIM commands at all (I found one unverified report of errors).\nHowever, bcache can itself send TRIM commands when it deletes buckets on its caching SSD device. By default it doesn't enable this because TRIM is not queued on pre-SATA3.1 drives so it's slower, but on modern SSDs enabling discard gives better peformance.\nTLDR; don't put \"discard\" in /etc/fstab for a filesystem on a bcache device, but endable bcache's discard in /sys/block/*/bcache/discard if your cache device is a modern SATA3.1 SSD.\nUPDATE 2023-02-28: For at least kernel 6.x.x things have changed.\nFor bcache the /sys/block/*/bcache/discard setting doesn't exist any more, at least for my old ssd. It might only appear for drives that support queued trim (SATA3.1) or just defaults to \"on\" for drives that support it. It doesn't seem to have any problem accepting TRIM operations from filesystems, but I don't know if it just ignores them or uses them as hints for discarding buckets.\nFor btrfs it automatically detects bcache devices as \"non-rotational\" so adds the ssd mount option by default. It will \"discard\" whole bcache devices when they are first added, but discard is not \"on\" by default. I suspect using the btrfs mount option discard=async would be fine; worst case bcache ignores it, best case it uses it as a hint for deleting buckets.\nAnother btrfs mount option that is probably worth adding is ssd_spread. From the description this turns on trying to keep data contiguous. It currently defaults to off because modern ssd's don't care, but it's probably beneficial for bcache as it will keep data more contiguous on the non-ssd backing drives.\n", "Q: Gearman problem when trying to run PHP cli When I run the following command in terminal:  \nphp somePHPfile.php\n\nThe following error happens:  \nPHP Warning:  PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library '/usr/lib/php5/20100525/gearman.so' - /usr/lib/php5/20100525/gearman.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory in Unknown on line 0\n\nI've installed gearman and gearmanAdmin.

If you see message GRUB Loading, you know you did it well.\nIn the GRUB menu, see if you have more than one OS. If you do, boot the one you want to, and if you don't, well it is gonna take more time. \nCase 1 \nYour chosen system will boot, and you will be happy :)\nCase 2\nIf you don't see the second OS, go to the OS you see (probably Lubuntu) and when it boots, run  in terminal \nsudo update-grub\n\nIt should find the second OS and add it to fstab file.\nWhen it's done, reboot and try to get to GRUB again. If you still don't see second OS, then it looks like the second one is not bootable. You might have to get GParted  Live and copy all your data somewhere safe and reinstall.\n\nA: You just have to log out your desktop and select the Ubuntu session under your user name in your login screen.\n", "Q: New Standard user autoloads on boot I've been using Ubuntu since about v8.09, now running 13.10, but only ever as a single user - and I'm a user, not a programmer or guru. Now I have a new partner who would like to learn to use a computer, so I created a new user profile for her, (through the Unity Systems Settings/User Accounts control) complete with password, as a standard user. Password is set, Auto-login is disabled, yet whenever I boot up the machine, she is logged in as the active user and I have to log her out before I log in (well, I don't have to but...). Thing is, it's not supposed to auto-login anyone, so how do I set things up so it doesn't? So it behaves the way it's supposed to?\n\nA: I am not sure, but if your account is passworded and your partner's not then it might just load the unpassworded account. Try setting a test password on your partner's account and see what it will do, even for curiosity sake.\n\nA: Your lightdm.conf file contains the line:\nautologin-user=username\n\nwhich will automatically login the user named username. So just remove that line from the lightdm.conf file.\n", "Q: Typing British pound sign Ubuntu 13.10 - Spanish keyboard layout I would like to know how to type the British pound sign in Ubuntu 13.10.

I'd like to (automatically) keep previous versions of files that I'm working on when saved, without using explicit 'commits' to git or other VCS, and without changing the name of the saved file.\nCurrently there are several tools to sync folders to clouds or to your own NAS, that are also maintaining the file versions, so I could use those.\nBut if I don't need or want to save to cloud/NAS and I'd like to have only the bare-bone versioning filesystem functionality, is there anything that I can use in a recent Linux environment?\nIt seems there have been some attempts in the past to build something like svnfs and gitfs, but I did not find any complete and tested solution. Do you know any?\n\nA: What you are looking for is a Versioning File System. The Wikipaedia lists several open source implementations for Linux, although none seems to be fully mature at this stage:\n\n\n*\n\n*ext3cow\n\n*Next3\n\n*NILFS \n\n*Tux3\nTo me it seems far easier to use a mainstream versioning system with auto-commit set on desired files and/or folders.

I go and GRUB menu and set nomodeset and test it without instalation.\nEverything seems ok. What should I do then? Install Ubuntu?  \nAnd after that can't I just go to AMD homepage and download ATI drivers for HD 6570 from their homepage?\n\nA: As a new user of Ubuntu you should not have to download anything from anywhere to get almost all running smoothly without issues. \nThis is especially true for graphics. If there was a bug or any other incompatibility in such brand new and partly untested downloaded drivers they will let you alone with a system booting to a command line terminal only, or in the worst case with a system that can not boot at all. Then it may not be so easy to get rid of these drivers again.\nThere is a great effort from our community to provide you with almost all possible drivers to make sure your system boots. Amongst these the Open Source ATI driver \"radeon\" is very stable, and it is well supported by ATI (ATI engineers develop this driver for us).\nOnly very new graphic cards, or applications demanding a lot of GPU power may benefit from a newer, proprietary or untested driver. Only if we had issues with our present setup we may consider installing a newer proprietary graphics driver.\n\nThis is not the usual case.\n\nMany people are very happy with the default drivers installed from the installation CD. They would not have much if any benefit from a newer driver.\nIn your case after you had already seen that your computer runs well in the live system I recommend you just install Ubuntu and enjoy it as it is. Refrain from updating or upgrading things with downloads from the Internet. \n\nThis will very likely break your system sooner or later.\n\nIn case you have graphical issues - look around for other people with the same problem to see how they solved it. Then you may consider installing a proprietary driver which is only a mouse click away.\nAlso see: Is my ATI graphics card supported in Ubuntu?\n", "Q: ReiserFS NFS for Windows and Ubuntu So I got a new 2TB HDD for Christmas and I wanted to make an NFS with it.\nMy uncle is a computer nerd, but also a teacher and a little hard to catch for a question, but he showed me  how to set up an XFS network drive while he was here for my birthday. He explained a little to me, so now I know that Windows can't directly access XFS, but it can get it over the network.\nIs ReiserFS the same? He also said that XFS isn't the best for small files, like a billion word documents and PDFs. \nI was hoping to format maybe a 10GB partition on the drive for this. Any help from you brilliant people? Thanks in advance!\n\nA: I have a NAS that I'm using to act as a central media storage device for my entire house - what I've personally done is take a spare 1TB HDD, make one giant ext4 partition, blanket the drive with permissions of 755, and use samba shares to serve the media to the three Windows machines on my network, as well as my laptop, which is Ubuntu 13.10.\nI've used samba across a couple different machines/filesystems, and while I've not tried an XFS personally, I see no issue using it.\nTL;DR: Should not matter what kind of partition/filesystem you use, if you're using a tool like Samba to share the files.\n", "Q: how to uninstall Ubuntu 13.04 keeping my Ubuntu 12.04 installation.

This is not my area of expertise but I will try to point you in the right direction. Most of the following is based on the tutorial found at Using C/C++ libraries with Automake and Autoconf\nFirst, you must modify the top level configure.ac file to add the Gtk-2.0 dependency. You can use the PKG_CHECK_MODULES macro to run pkg-config to find the corresponding include and library directives - it's good practice to check that pkg-config exists first, so we should add a PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG test as well. The bolded portions indicate what`s added, relative to the files in the original amhello tutorial that you started from.\nAC_INIT([amhello], [1.0], [bug-automake@gnu.org])\nAM_INIT_AUTOMAKE([-Wall -Werror foreign])\nAC_PROG_CC\nAC_CONFIG_HEADERS([config.h])\nAC_CONFIG_FILES([\n Makefile\n src/Makefile\n])\ndnl Test for pkg-config\nPKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG([0.22])\ndnl Test for gtk+\nPKG_CHECK_MODULES([GTK], [gtk+-2.0 >= 2.24.10])\nAC_OUTPUT\nThen in your src/Makefile.am you can retrieve the CFLAGS and LIBS using the GTK identifier that you used in the PKG_CHECK_MODULES macro above\nbin_PROGRAMS = hello\nhello_SOURCES = main.c\nAM_CPPFLAGS = ${GTK_CFLAGS}\nhello_LDADD = ${GTK_LIBS}\nWhen you re-run make, it should re-generate your src/Makefile with the appropriate -I include paths, -L library paths and libraries.\n\nA: sudo apt-get install build-essential gnome-devel\n\nThat is also needed so that you can do cool things like:\ng++ main.cpp -o base `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0`\n\nIt allows you to use pkg-config to save a whole lot of time\n\nA: In CentOS 7:\na) packages:\npkg-config --list-all|grep gtk\n...\ngtk+-3.0                  GTK+ - GTK+ Graphical UI Library\n...\ngtk+-2.0                  GTK+ - GTK+ Graphical UI Library (x11 target)\n...\n\nb) editing header section of your snippet:\n#include<config.h>\n#include<stdio.h>\n#include<gtk/gtk.h>\n\nto \n#include<stdlib.h>\n#include<stdio.h>\n#include<gtk/gtk.h>\n\nc) compiling using:\ngcc main.c -o main `pkg-config --cflags gtk+-2.0` `pkg-config --libs gtk+-2.0` \n\nor \ngcc main.c -o main `pkg-config --cflags gtk+-3.0` `pkg-config --libs gtk+-3.0` \n\nand\nd) executing using:\nGDK_SCALE=5 ./main\n\nworked for me!\n", "Q: How change resolution screen of virtualbox? 04 and I install Mountain lion via virtual box, and I want to known how I can get full resolution with my monitor.

The text on my monitor was about:\n\n\n*\n\n*The top was the end of a traceback for a ext3 I/O function\n\n*Middle was full of errors concerning writing to somewhere on the disk, also errors about a bad superblock (!)\n\n*Last line was Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init! (exitcode: 0x00000007)\nWhen I rebooted I think fsck fixed the filesystem up (I guess Minecraft was in the middle of a save). My question is: why did Alt-SysRq-E kill init when it shouldn't?\n\nA: Alt+SysRq+E won't kill init. \nThat kernel panic is more likely was caused by that freeze which you experienced. When you issued the terminate all command with the magic combo, the kernel sent the SIGTERM signal to that misbehaving process which was causing your freeze, and because that was a misbehaving one, it decided to not die in the way a gentleman or a samurai should die when their death is needed, but instead it tried to handle that signal before dying and do something before its death. While it was handling that signal it caused some more problem to your already instable (freezing) system and that caused a kernel panic. (So the Alt+SysRq+E triggered that panic, but it wasn't the faulty for init's death. Or something similar to this happened, maybe with less drama.\n\nA: You would need to get a photo or pay careful attention to the messages to be sure, but based on your description, my guess is that your disk was throwing IO errors ( not a good sign ), and this triggered a kernel OOPS in the filesystem driver when init tried to do some IO, and that is why init died.\nYou should use the disk utility to check the SMART status of the drive.  Run the long self test ( this can take hours ) and make sure there are no bad sectors.  If this happens again, try to get a photo of the errors.\n", "Q: Steam Resolution Problem in Ubuntu 12.04 first of all I m noob.\nI would like to know why since I have Steam and installed games, Steam is messing around with my Pc resolution.

The first answer isn't quite complete and I got the same error at first. Here is how it works:\n1st we need to find the primary partition. This will be where the essential files needed for linux to boot will reside, so we enter this -\nGrub> ls\n\nYou should now see a list comparable to (hd0) (hd0,msdos5) (hd0,msdos1). Note that you may have different partitions than myself, as well as multiple drives, but the process is the same.\nNow search the partitions to find the primary -\nGrub> ls (hd0)\nGrub> ls (hd0,msdos5)\nGrub> ls (hd0,msdos1)\n\nUntil grub outputs either a list of files on that partition or shows the filesystem type and date of last modification.\n2nd we need to set up a few things once we've found our primary partition -\nGrub> set prefix=(hd0,msdos1)/boot/grub\nGrub> set root=(hd0,msdos1)\nGrub> set\n\nOnce the last set command is executed Grub will output a list of different parameters. Now lets check that we've set the correct root and prefix -\nGrub> ls /boot\n\nGrub should output a list of files contained within /boot.\n3rd we need to set the mount point and load the kernel -\nGrub> linux /vmlinuz root=/dev/sda1\nGrub> initrd /initrd.img\n\nAnd lastly we boot the system -\nGrub> boot\n\nIf you end up booting into the busybox shell, simply enter fsck /dev/sda1.

My Lubuntu installation presented a very strange feature this time: when I installed AMD proprietary drivers for my GPU I found out that my Catalyst Control Center is in German, even though the rest of the system is in English.\nThe only thing I can imagine to have caused this is the fact that I am in Germany right now, though I highly doubt that AMD's software language is solely determined by the physical location of the PC in which it is installed. Maybe it is because of the repositories, but I don't really know.\nAnyway, does somebody know if I can change the language of AMD Catalyst Control Center without uninstalling the whole thing?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Not the optimal solution, but at least you don't need to change your system's regional preferences.\nCatalyst defaults to English if you remove (or rename) the language file in it's folder. :)\nIn my system (Ubuntu 13.10 with Catalyst 2.18) the language files were in:\n/usr/share/ati/amdcccle\n\nI hide it from the system by renaming the amdcccle_XX.qm file to amdcccle_XX.qm.bak and it did the trick (where XX is the language code that is causing you issues).\n\nA: If you at installation stated some place in Germany for the time zone setting, the installer 'guessed' that you prefer German regional formats (date/time format, currency etc.). That may or may not explain the odd behaviour. (If it does, it's a bug.)\nYou can change the regional formats setting to some English option via Language Support.

This file (as seen in the variable on top of the script) is located in /usr/bin/$NAME. $NAME is transmission-daemon.

I used gparted to format my 1TB external HDD to ext4. I am new to linux and all but after formatting almost 15GiB of space is used. Is this normal? Is this how large the ext4 is? I am going to use this to store a lot of videos and the more videos I can fit the better.\n\nA: When creating ext4 fs, usually you should reserve some space for system daemons needs. Quote from mkfs man page:\nSet the percentage of the filesystem which may only be\nallocated by privileged processes. Reserving some number \nof  filesystem  blocks  for  use by privileged processes\nis done to avoid filesystem fragmentation, and to allow \nsystem daemons, such as syslogd(8), to continue to function\ncorrectly after non-privileged processes  are prevented from\nwriting to the filesystem.  Normally, the default percentage\nof reserved blocks is 5%.\n\nSo by default mkfs keeps 5%, in case of 1Tb it may 50Gb. I don't know what % gparted uses by default.\nAs a summary\nPlease read this and this carefully.\nIn your case, as you wish use this hard not for root ( / ), but as audio/video/other_need storage, you can remove reserving of blocks using tune2fs utility.\ntune2fs -r 0 /dev/sdxX\n\nQuote from opensuse forum:\nIf you set the reserved block count to zero, it won't affect\nperformance much except if you run for long periods of time (with lots\nof file creates and deletes) while the filesystem is almost full\n(i.e., say above 95%), at which point you'll be subject to\nfragmentation problems. Ext4's multi-block allocator is much more\nfragmentation resistant, because it tries much harder to find\ncontiguous blocks, so even if you don't enable the other ext4\nfeatures, you'll see better results simply mounting an ext3 filesystem\nusing ext4 before the filesystem gets completely full.\n\nIf you are just using the filesystem for long-term archive, where\nfiles aren't changing very often (i.e., a huge mp3 or video store), it\nobviously won't matter.\n\n\nA: There is always some space used by file management data structures. To keep track of what part of the hard disk is used by which file, the file system needs to use some of the disk space. If you are an expert user and know what you are doing then you can tweak some parameters when creating the file system to reduce the size of these management structures but that may increase the wasted space per every file. Below is the text that best describes this idea. Its not my text, just some thing that I found on internet. If you want to read the original post or need more detail plz visit this link\n\nAs far as I know, ext2/3 (and maybe ext4 as well) use fixed-size management data structures that are written once during creating the file system - and never extended afterwards (unless you don't resize the file system). As a result, the management structures do always consume the same amount of space on your partition, no matter how much data you have stored there.\n  In contrast to this, some other file systems - ReiserFS is one of this kind, I think - allocate space for their management structures dynamically - that is, management structures start off consuming very little space ruight after creating the file system, but grow as you put more data on the drive. In the end, this approach can lead to the same amount of storage space used for management as in a file system that has fixed-size management structures - so don't let yourself be fooled by the amount of \"used\" space on your freshly-formatted ext3 partition!\n  However, there are some options that can be passed to the mkfs.ext2 command which influence the size of the management structures. Most important of these options are the -i option (this one defines the ratio of inodes per storage space - that is, you can influence how many bytes of storage space one inode should \"take care of\") as well as the -I option (which defines the amount of storage space occupied by one inode). Please note that these values can not be changed once the file system is created - you have to re-format the partition if you want to change one of them. And since the first of these options indirectly defines the total number of inodes on your partition, and since each inode can represent only one single file or directory, it also limits the number of files that can be stored on your partition! As a result, you can tune the number of inodes to your current needs (like, e.g., one inode per 128 MBytes - this could minimize the overhead occupied by the inodes on a file system that is reserved for storing movies, CD-ROM ISO images or other large files of several 100 MBytes each - but if you want to put your photo collection there, you won't be able to get the partition only halfway filled since you'd run out of inodes far before this point).\n\n", "Q: What's the mounted path for sound device?

It seems each program receives a SIGTERM instead of an Alt+F4 equivalent.\nIs there a way to change that behavior?\n\nA: AFAIK, no. But keep in mind this is a minimalist DE for a reason. Apparently, its Makers declared such features too bloaty. They might be right though.\nUNIX already allows for the graceful closing of child processes through SIGTERM. Unresponsive children can be killed immediately with SIGKILL. Sensible DEs follow this design, sending SIGTERM, then following up with SIGKILL only when necessary. Some applications, like libreoffice, do not follow this design and shut down immediately when they receive SIGTERM, even if there are unsaved documents. The Makers rightfully consider this a problem with libreoffice and not with their session manager.\nClosing all clients of an X11 session gracefully can be more complicated than just sending alt-f4 to all windows. For instance, if you have multiple firefox windows open and you send alt-f4 to all at the same time, the windows will close individually, in a random order. When firefox starts up again, only the last window to close will open again. Thus SIGTERM is actually the right signal to send to the firefox process if you want all windows to start up again in their previous state.\nFor reasons I don't understand, most interactive shells don't respond to SIGTERM, so xfce4-terminal and many others will just send SIGKILL to their clients. The result is that terminals generally respond very badly to alt-f4. The only way to ensure there is no data loss is if each terminal is closed individually, with the user judging whether there is a task in the terminal that must be completed before closing it.\nThat said, if you find alt-f4 to be appropriate for gracefully closing all applications you use on a day-to-day basis, it should be fairly easy for you to write a simple script that sends an alt-f4 to all running windows. The relevant X11 event is WM_DELETE_WINDOW. There's some information here on how you might write such a script. It is even possible to filter out the troublesome clients, like firefox and terminals. Now imagine the Herculean task of maintaining such a script for all X11 applications people are likely to use and you can see why most DEs opt for the UNIX-style SIGTERM, SIGKILL approach.\n", "Q: svn post- and pre- commit hooks don't work when subversion gets commited I have no idea how to fix it.

This is not a problem with perms, I already gave right ones to both, the scripts files and datefile.\n\nA: First off, you're missing the shebang line; the first line should read #!/usr/bin/env bash or #!/bin/bash\nSecond, you're making assumptions on what the current working directory will be when the hook is run, so if it manages to run the script even though it's missing the important shebang line, it likely works, but writes datefile in a different directory than you assumed. Provide an absolute path to the file you want to write to.\nLastly, ${filename} is bad practice, you should always quote variable expansions to avoid word splitting and pathname expansion: \"$filename\". Also, instead of doing date | cut ..., just tell date to only output the bits you're after. E.g.\nprintf 'Commit happened at %s\\n' \"$(date \"+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\" > \"$filename\"\n\nOn a side note, bash's printf (since 4.0) can output date strings too.\nprintf 'Commit happened at %(%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S)T\\n' -1 > \"$filename\"\n\nman bash | less +/printf to read more about printf.\n", "Q: Can Filemaker Pro work on Ubuntu?

The same is applying for the RAID volume.\nWhat is the best thing I can do now ?\nEDIT:\n@psusi, htnx for your replay. In the Intel raid configuration manager, I added all the drives to a raid 10 (0+1) configuration, after that I started the installation and Ubuntu auto detected the raid and added it to my partitioning list. Then U just mounted the raid partition to /home and made 2 new partitions on my SSD (boot and swap) and mounted the boot part. on / \nhere is the output:\n~ # dmraid -s\n**** Group superset isw_hjabdiead\n--> Superset\nname   : isw_hjabdiead_Data\nsize   : 3711742464\nstride : 128 \ntype   : raid01\nstatus : ok\nsubset : 2\ndevs   : 4\nspares : 0\n\nPs: sorry can't get that code block working correctly :p\n\nA: okay, i figured it out. For some reason it was writing the EFI boot partition automatically to the raid array. So I just mounted an Gig partition on the ssd as EFI and it fixed everything.\n", "Q: Terminal shows \"Couldn't open audio: Couldn't open audio device or ESD connection\" after launching a game and there is no sound in the game So I tried installing a Heroes of Might and Magic 3 linux loki game version into Ubuntu 13.10  and everything is fine but I don't have sound.

Following the instructions at the Broadcom website Compile Broadcom wifi driver, I successfully made it work...well, almost.\nThe last bit of the instructions tells me that to permanently replace the old driver (i.e. load new driver at boot time), I should do the following:\n$> cp wl.ko /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/net/wireless \n$> depmod -a\n\nThis bit doesn't seem to work, and I have to manually insmod the driver each time I reboot my laptop.\nAny ideas what could be the reason for this?\n\nA: It is far preferable to install the version of the driver tweaked for Ubuntu rather than compile a one-size-maybe-fits-all from source code.

I have nstalled Workstation 9 on it, and then Ubuntu 13.04 on to workstation 9. The working of Ubuntu 13.04 is very low. How can I enjoy good Ubuntu working with efficient speed?\nThanks Advance.\n\nA: Well, you see emulation is sometimes really slow no matter how good your computer is.

I'm trying to imitate this line from my .bashrc:\nshopt -s dotglob # for mv * see hidden files\n\n\nA: This is intentional. Most of time the users don't want to accidentally match the hidden files that are invisible for ls (without -a). Usually, files are hidden for a reason, not just to troll you. Also, if * would match hidden files, matching non hidden files would be too tricky.\nHowever, unlike bash shopt -s dotglob is not needed to match hidden files. In bash, shopt -s dotglob is the only way of matching every file in the directory without accidentally matching . or ... However, fish shell can never match . or .. with globs, therefore that's not an issue (if you seriously need to match . or .. for some silly reason, just say them explicitly). Besides, fish tries to avoid having options by design, so it doesn't have dotglob.\nTo match every single file in the directory, you may want to use bracket expansion to detect files starting with dots, and those which aren't. {.,} is bracket expansion which matches dot that may or may not exist. The star after it matches everything. Because globs in fish cannot match . or .., the following code matches everything except for those two directories (which bash sadly matches, if you use the code below)\ncat {.,}*\n\n", "Q: How to See Hibernate in the Power Setting Correctly?

Try using memset() on your memory block before leaking it.\nYou might also be interested in looking up about /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory\nFrom: https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt\n\novercommit_memory:\nThis value contains a flag that enables memory overcommitment.\nWhen this flag is 0, the kernel attempts to estimate the amount of\n  free memory left when userspace requests more memory.\nWhen this flag is 1, the kernel pretends there is always enough memory\n  until it actually runs out.\nWhen this flag is 2, the kernel uses a \"never overcommit\" policy that\n  attempts to prevent any overcommit of memory. Note that\n  user_reserve_kbytes affects this policy.\nThis feature can be very useful because there are a lot of programs\n  that malloc() huge amounts of memory \"just-in-case\" and don't use much\n  of it.\nThe default value is 0.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu-SDK cannot start qtcreator I cannot start qtcreator with ubuntu-sdk installed.

At that time, A script(python or shell) should be run automatically in my system to perform some validation?\nHow to run the script automatically in server system?\n\nA: You can create a /etc/ssh/sshrc file. See man 8 ssh.\nIf you want this for a single user, use ~/.ssh/rc.\nHere is a sample /etc/ssh/sshrc that will notify you via dbus when someone logs in on your machine. Don't forget to chmod +x:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nip=`echo $SSH_CONNECTION | cut -d \" \" -f 1`\n\nnotify-send -u CRITICAL \"SSH connection from ${ip}\" \"User $USER just logged in from $ip\"\n\n\nA: You can do so by adding the following parameter to your config file (/etc/ssh/sshd_config).\n\n ForceCommand\n         Forces the execution of the command specified by ForceCommand, ignoring any command supplied by the client and ~/.ssh/rc if present.  The command is invoked by using the user's login shell\n         with the -c option.  This applies to shell, command, or subsystem execution.  It is most useful inside a Match block.  The command originally supplied by the client is available in the\n         SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND environment variable.  Specifying a command of “internal-sftp” will force the use of an in-process sftp server that requires no support files when used with\n         ChrootDirectory.\n\n\nAn other option is to use the .ssh/rc files on a per user basis.\nTo use the ForceCommand method you just add ForceCommand /usr/bin/ownscript at the bottom of the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config (on the server).\nThe script looks like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n#Script file for ssh\n#\n#put your commands here\necho \"test\" > /tmp/test.txt\n#\n#exit by calling a shell to open for the ssh session\n/bin/bash\n\nDon't forget to chmod the script sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/ownscript\n\nA: For execution of a script during logon, add it as a call from within the /etc/profile script.  This is executed for every logon, not only for ssh logons.  \n", "Q: Openstack havana shows only one computer I have 3 computers with wich i want to build a cloud.\nOn the first i have installed MAAS, after that i have added the other two as nodes in the MAAS.

If the system settings tell you that the synaptics driver is not loaded (or not used) when you try to configure the touchpad, simply provide an xorg.conf for it.  Turns out, there is a snippet already made for you.  It is in /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d and it is named 50-synaptics.conf. In my case, there was no xorg.conf in /etc/X11, so I simply copied the snippet as xorg.conf into /etc/X11:\nsudo cp -n /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\nIf an xorg.conf already exists, make sure it does not already contain the stanzas for the touchpad, and if it doesn't, append the 50-synaptics.conf snipped to the existing xorg.conf using your favorite editor (and sudo).  If it has touchpad stuff in it, you have a different problem.\nAfter re-starting X11 (re-boot would obviously work too), the touchpad worked like a charm.\n", "Q: Internet loses connectivity when steam is launched I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 whenever I launch steam or start a steam download I lose internet connectivity.

Its a basic fix that may not work, but its worth a shot.\n", "Q: No sound on powerpc, soundcard not detected I am running Lubuntu 13.10 on, among other machines, a Mac iBook G4.\nI hear the signature sound on turning the machine on, but there is no sound when playing audio or video.\nrobert@lubuntu-ibookg4:~$  aplay -l\naplay: device_list:268: no soundcards found...\n\nI have read the advice here, and everything appears in order: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PowerPCFAQ#Why_do_I_have_no_sound.3F\nMy sound does not appear to be muted*.\nModules:\nsnd-powermac is loaded.\nThe following are blacklisted:\nsnd-aoa,\nsnd-aoa-fabric-layout,\nsnd-aoa-soundbus,\nsnd-aoa-i2sbus,\nsnd-aoa-codec-tas.\n(* The above link gives the advice: \"You need to check more than just your master volume,\nfor example the volume of the PCM channel maybe set to zero\". However, I do not know how to\ncheck the \"PCM channel\". I have installed gnome-alsamixer, but it does not appear to open properly i.e.\nthe GUI opens but without any controls, just a blank window).\nAny help gratefully received.\nMany thanks. \n\nA: The problem was that I had failed to consider that I might have both the wrong sound module loaded AND one of the volume controls muted. Thus when I tried with the other sound modules I did not at the same time re-try with alsamixer. (Reading above, see that alsamixer would not show any controls with snd-powermac loaded).\nThe solution was to ensure that these modules were loaded:\nsnd-aoa\nsnd-aoa-fabric-layout\nsnd-aoa-soundbus\nsnd-aoa-i2sbus\nsnd-aoa-codec-tas\n\nand this one blacklisted:\nsnd-powermac\n\ni.e. the opposite of the configuration installed by default.\nDetails here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PowerPCFAQ#Why_do_I_have_no_sound.3F\nHow?\n\n\n*\n\n*In /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.local.conf comment out the blacklisted modules that are in fact required to be loaded:\nblacklist snd-aoa\nblacklist snd-aoa-fabric-layout\nblacklist snd-aoa-soundbus\nblacklist snd-aoa-i2sbus\nblacklist snd-aoa-codec-tas\nand uncomment the following:\n# blacklist snd-powermac\n\n\n\n*In /etc/modules add:\n\n\nsnd-aoa\nsnd-aoa-fabric-layout\nsnd-aoa-soundbus\nsnd-aoa-i2sbus\nsnd-aoa-codec-tas\nThen, from a terminal I opened alsamixer, which now displayed normally. I toggled \"PCM\" to unmuted by selecting it and typing \"m\", then crucially I did the same with \"Headphone\". Without this last step there was still no sound, although what this has to do with it I don't know as I don't have any headphones attached.\nAnyway, that worked.\n\nA: I stumbled on this after some looking around and this corrected my no sound issues.\nI have Lubuntu on a imac g4 powerpc.\nsu (enter root password)\nnano /etc/modules\n\nAdd the following lines:\nsnd_aoa_i2sbus\nsnd_aoa_fabric_layout\nsnd_aoa_codec_tas\n\nCtrl+O, then Ctrl+X, close terminal, reboot.\nReferences:\nhttp://help.lockergnome.com/linux/sound ... 47859.html\nhttp://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=187&t=97450\n", "Q: Do I need gnome on my PC with 12.04LTS to install gtk themes? I was just asking if I need gnome installed on my PC for me to install GTK themes......on UBUNTU 12.04LTS.\n\nA: Technically, GTK themes only require... GTK. However, \"themes\" are designed for specific environments, and you might get a partial result if you do not have GNOME installed. On Ubuntu 12.04, you have basic GNOME, which allows you to install and configure GTK themes. You may need the gnome-tweak-tool.\n", "Q: PostgreSQL Graphical Interface Alternatives Hi I am looking for some suggestions on what graphical interface we can use in PostgreSQL aside from pgAdmin3.

I installed LXDE, but it seems the default theme (ClearLooks) doesn't work for Transmission, which is a gtk3 app.\nAll the themes I see in the Appearance tool are either gtk2, or gtk3, but not both.\nWhat should I do to make both gtk2 and gtk3 apps look good in LXDE?\n\nA: Install a theme that has both gtk2 and gtk3. For example, sudo apt-get install shimmer-themes will get you a few themes which support both gtk2 and gtk3. There's also light-themes which will get you Ambiance and Radiance.\nIncidentally, these themes will work whether you use LXDE or XFCE or Unity.\nWhen you install these themes, they will pull in the necessary gtk engines which you may not have at the moment.\nYou can see what you will get by using the -s flag along with sudo apt-get install or by running apt-cache show _package-name_.\n", "Q: Why is the second linux system I install unable to access the Internet? I am attempting to run Zorin OS 7 alongside Ubuntu on my laptop, but whichever OS I install second, does not have internet access (will not work with ethernet or wifi).  So I was wondering if this was an issue because both OS are ubuntu based or am I doing something wrong?\n\nA: Yes, you can. When you are going through the install options, just be sure to choose \"Install alongside Ubuntu\" when asked how you want to install. Ubuntu should ask how you want to partition. If you aren't particularly experienced with Linux, I recommend just sticking with the default options.

To see those files in windows I have to restart windows.\nIs there a way in which I can do this thing without actually restarting windows 7 'cause restarting windows takes hell lot of time\nThanks\n\nA: When Windows is hibernated, it is just like the system is still up and running. When you boot Ubuntu and copy a file, Windows is unaware of the modifications you make on its back and still assumes that its NTFS partition hasn't changed since it was hibernated. In fact, everything you changed since then is considered as corruption and could cause serious problems in the filesystem structure, even running chkdsk could be a risk since it will try to make the filesystem consistent with Windows own view and will probably find that it differs.\nNTFS-3g which is the tool that allows you to write to NTFS partitions should prevent you from mounting an hibernated partition as said in its manual:\n\nremove_hiberfile\nUnlike in case of read-only mount, the read-write mount is\n  denied if the NTFS volume is hibernated. One needs either to\n  resume Windows and shutdown it properly, or use this option which will\n  remove the Windows hibernation file. Please note, this means that the\n  saved Windows session will be completely lost.

You should either add a rule that allows the packet, or turn off the logging (not recommended) or just don't use UFW unless you are clear about what you are doing.\n\nA: To allow all addresses on 192.168.2.x, add this rule:\nsudo ufw allow from 192.168.2.0/24\n\nTo allow all addresses on 192.168.x.x, add this rule:\nsudo ufw allow from 192.168.0.0/16\n\nTo learn more, see:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW\n\n*UFW - allow range of IP addresees?\n\n*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#IPv4_CIDR_blocks\n", "Q: Can removing GUFW create dangers for my system?

The command-line tool 'ufw' is also just a way to change your firewall settings. \nRemoving the gufw package doesn't remove the linux firewall. So uninstalling gufw is not going to change the security of your system one way or the other. Your firewall is still going to be sitting there with whatever rules were last set up - either the defaults or whatever you changed them to be. \n\nA: Using firewalls is a personal decision based on your usage. I personally think that firewalls aren't necessary for desktops on LANs behind routers that don't have unneeded ports opened. Linux by default does not open any ports that are not required unless a program/service needs them.\nIf you did not create any firewall rules using the app, removing it via the Software Center should cause no problems.\n", "Q: mac address changing i have alfa awus036nh and for some commands i need to change it's mac address but it always gives me ERROR \nplease help....!\nwhen i do \n    sudo ifconfig -a\n\nit give me this:\n    wlan1    Link encap:UNSPEC  HWaddr 00-C0-CA-28-9F-C7-33-30-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00\n    UP BROADCAST NOTRAILERS PROMISC ALLMULTI  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n    RX packets:39069 errors:0 dropped:97 overruns:0 frame:0\n    TX packets:34743 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n    collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n    RX bytes:42537771 (42.5 MB)  TX bytes:4448035 (4.4 MB)\n\n\nA: if the topic of the question was HOW to change the mac address in Ubuntu, I believe you could simply go to network interfaces by entering the command in terminal:\nsudo gedit /etc/network/interfaces \nand then edit the file to something like this at the end :\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\nhwaddress ether 01:02:03:04:05:06\n\nat then end simply restart the networking service:\nsudo /etc/init.d/networking restart\nif for some reasons that gives you error try this (or system restart):\nsudo service networking stop && sudo service networking start\n", "Q: Ubuntu won't suspend, shutdown, etc I've read everything I can find and can't seem to fix this.

It's fast. Unfortunately, during normal boots the step \"Scanning for btrfs filesystems\" fails. To successfully boot I have to enter recovery mode and then simply choose the menu option \"continue to the main system\".\nI assume a normal boot fails because the bcache0 device has not finished being created by the time btrfs scans for its filesystems. How can I insert a delay between these steps?\n\nA: Btrfs is actually supposed to react to new devices dynamically, through udev calling btrfs device ready/BTRFS_IOC_DEVICE_READY. See /lib/udev/rules.d/64-btrfs.rules. This logic obsoletes btrfs device scan which is inappropriate for a dynamic boot. According to this, Btrfs' messages to udev have a flag to tell when there's enough backing devices to mount the Btrfs filesystem on them.\nHowever, I'm not sure that mountall (an underdocumented piece of software that scans /etc/fstab and calls mount) implements the rest. The solution involves either fixing mountall or hacking up something that could be specific to your system, putting the mount command in /etc/rc.local or a custom udev rule.\n\nA: Btrfs is not currently stable with bcache (Feb 2014) - this is a known bug and being worked on, but for the moment I'd strongly advise against this use.\n", "Q: Can't connect to wireless Ubuntu won't connect to my wireless.

Your master, headphone and speaker levels should be un-muted and high enough for you to listen to anything.\nThe problem is that when you mute your volume again, only the master responds reasonably. But the speaker and headphone levels get muted and never back to un-muted. So I have to manually un-mute the headphone and speaker levels.\n\nI tried a solution which didn't work for me, but may be for others. It's about sudo editing a file: /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf and append this line to it: options snd-hda-intel model=laptop-eapd, then reboot, but this didn't work for me.\nI'm using a Dell Inspiron SE 7520, Ubuntu 13.10, Xfce 4.12.\nAnswer 2: Log out of Xfce, log in using Unity, un-mute your voice (This is the trick. I found my sound muted on Unity). Logout and login again using Xfce.\nWhat still bothers me, is that when I muted the sound on Xfce, the problem occurred again. No sound at all even if I un-mute it while I'm still on Xfce !\n\nA: The accepted answer didn't work for Ubuntu 18.04x64. My sound disappeared after moving my PC. \nI installed the old gnome-alsamixer from https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/gnome-alsamixer and all the speaker and mic options were on mute.

How do I fix this or find wherever all of this data is hiding?\n\nA: Well, the first thing you want to do is try to login as root (recovery mode).\nEDIT: If you are in recovery mode, you'll need to remount as RW. To do this, mount -o remount,rw /.\nRun cd /. This allows you to enter the root and begin to trace the problem.\nWhen you are in /, run du -sh *. This'll give you a list of all of the files in your hard drive. Let's say you  see\n2.6T var\n\nYou know that the problem is in /var. You then cd /var and run the du -sh * command again. Scroll and look for something like\n2.6T zpanel\n\nYou then know the problem is in the ZPanel folder. (I am using ZPanel for this example, as I just recovered from this exact problem). By now you know the drill. You cd zpanel/  and du -sh *. Look for something like\n2.6T backups\n\nSame old, same old. cd backups/, du -sh *. But this time, you get\n(size) zpanel_date_etc\n\nThe backups folder contains no more subdirectories, so you expunge the unnecessary files. In my case, I used rm -rf zpanel_* and went from 100% capacity to 25% capacity.\nThen, you fix wherever the problem is. (For me, it's in ZPanel's backup settings, so I should change those).\nThis works with any situation, all you need to do is trace the problem.\nN.B.

Precisely, the part that I don't understand is:\nwhile IFS= read -r -d '' file\n\nI get that IFS is \"internal field separator\" and I suppose this is removing or ignoring the whitespace, but I don't understand the syntax and the options.\nI would also like to understand why the -- is necessary after mv. \nCould someone help? Thanks.\n\nA: read word1 word2 … rest does the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Read a line.\n\n*While the current input ends in a backslash, read another line and append it to the first one, minus the backslash-newline.\n\n*Break the input into separate words, where any character in the value of the IFS variable is considered a word separator.\n\n*Assign the first word to the variable word, the second word to the variable word2, etc.\n\n*If there are words left over, they are assigned to the variable rest, with the original word separators inside preserved.\n\n\nThe option -r deactivates step 2, so a \\ at the end of a line is not considered a word separator.\nWith IFS set to the empty string, there are no word separators, so the whole line is one big word: step 3 does nothing, and step 5 ends up assigning the original line to the specified variable. Regarding why IFS is set in this location, see Why is while IFS= read used so often, instead of IFS=; while read..?.\nThe option -d changes the notion of line: normally a line ends in a newline character; with -d '' (empty argument to -d), bash reads input records delimited by a null byte instead.\nThe upshot is that find … -print0 | while IFS= read -r -d '' file; do … executes the loop body for each match that find prints, regardless of any special characters that may occur in the file name.\n\nAs for the -- in mv -- \"$file\", it's there in case the value of file begins with a dash: mv would interpret it as an option. In this particular case, it isn't necessary, because the ouptut of this find command always starts with ./. Using -- systematically in scripts is arguably good hygiene.\n\nThere is a defect in this snippet: it still won't cope with file names containing whitespace or \\[?*, because of the \"$(echo $file | sed 's/_backup//g')\" bit. A variable expansion like $file doesn't just substitute the value of the variable: it splits the variable into words using the value of IFS (just like read does), and treats each word as a wildcard pattern that is replaced by the list of matching files if it matches any. To avoid this behavior, write \"$file\". This is a general shell programming rule: always put double quotes around variable substitutions (and command substitutions $(…) too), unless you know why you need to leave them out. (If you want the nitty-gritty, see When is double-quoting necessary?; $VAR vs ${VAR} and to quote or not to quote and What is the significance of single and double quotes in environment variables? may also be of interest).\nThe quick fix is to add the double quotes:\nmv -- \"$file\" \"$(echo \"$file\" | sed 's/_backup//g')\"\n\nThis happens to work here because of the way the input is produced, but for general values of file it fails in a few rare cases:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the value of file consists of the character - followed by one or more letters among Een, then echo will treat it as an option and output nothing.\n\n*Command substitution eats up the last newlines of the output, so if $file ends with one or more newline characters, they will be truncated.\n\n\nBash has a string substitution which can be used instead of sed here. It's more robust (you don't need to worry about subtleties with special characters) and faster.\nmv -- \"$file\" \"${file//_backup/}\"\n\nThough given what the question asked for, this is the wrong operation: it removes _backup anywhere in the file name instead of only at the end. Here doing it right would be easier.\nmv -- \"$file\" \"${file%_backup}\"\n\n\nA: In case you have a filename that happens to start with a hyphen, you need -- to separate mv options from the actual filename arguments.\nIf you have a filename that begins or ends with spaces, that incantation of read with IFS= will ensure the file variable contains the exact filename you want.\nThe -d '' option reads zero-byte separated \"lines\" instead of newline separated lines -- that's because you're using find's -print0 option.\n", "Q: Wi-Fi browsing history Is there a way of viewing a Wi-Fi network's browsing history?\n(probably using the command line) \nIs there a package which serves this purpose?\nMy OS is Ubuntu 13.10\n\nA: This depends on the logging capability of the router which serves the network.

As fetching e-mail requires an username and password,\n  we have here a good authentication method that prevents misuse of the\n  SMTP protocol.\nThis kind of authentication is called SMTP-After-POP3, because it\n  allows sending e-mail (SMTP) only after fetching e-mail (POP3).

Any 3 but never 4 at a time, as the fourth one, although detected, is always disabled.\n\n*If I try to enable the 4th monitor, I get two popups with the following messages:\n\"The selected configuration for displays could not be applied\", \"could not set the configuration for CRTC 64\", \"Failed to apply configuration: %s\",  \n\n\"GDBus.Error:org.gtk.GDBus.UnmappedGError.Quark._gnome_2drr_2derror_2dquark.Code2: could not set the configuration for CRTC 64\"\n\nThat's where I am stuck after a week. Tried all sorts of proprietary drivers, all sorts of instructions etc but I feel the only way to get back my 4th monitor is to downgrade to 12.04 and hope 14.04 doesn't mess up things. Anyone to help?\n\nA: The Nouveau driver has problems with supporting 4 monitors in a dual GPU configuration:\n\nI would avoid those if possible. Both nouveau and the nvidia driver\n  wil support them in a 4-monitor configuration, but there will be\n  issues, esp with nouveau. Not sure about nvidia.\nIf possible, get a Kepler-based card, which can drive 4 CRTC's from 1\n  GPU. That way you get none of the trouble.\nThere are 2 ways of dealing with that (neither is nouveau-specific):\n(a) You can use PRIME to render on one GPU and use the outputs on the\n  other gpu to display said rendering. This is possible using xrandr 1.4\n  and Xorg 1.14.3 or later. (b) You can use Xinerama to create a virtual\n  screen on these. This loses you xrandr and direct rendering.\nNeither of these yields a particularly fast experience\n\nAnd freedesktop say:\n\nMulti-monitor desktop with Nouveau\nIf you have a single graphics card (GPU) with multiple heads, it\n  should all just work for you with RandR 1.2 and offer full (whatever\n  is implemented) graphics acceleration. If you really want multiple\n  SCREENs on a dual-head card, there exists the experimental\n  configuration option ZaphodHeads.\nIf you have multiple graphics cards, the only way to combine them into\n  a single SCREEN is the Xinerama feature, and all the drawbacks listed\n  for it apply. Notice, that a card with multiple GPUs counts as\n  multiple cards. The end result depends on which outputs are driven by\n  which GPUs.\n\nConclusion: it may be possible to get Nouveau quad head on two GPUs to work with some particular configuration, but it has not been well tested, and performance will not be optimal. The suggested option is to upgrade to a single GPU card that supports multiple monitors (either Nvidia or AMD Eyefinity 6; AMD has the advantage of official open source driver support).\n", "Q: Cron Script Length I have a backup script, a script that cyncs file with other files on my computer, and a script that uploads files to my website with ncftp.

This will allow you to login to the computer's filesystem from a another computer as a user on the computer you are accessing. First you need to install and setup FTP on the computer you want to access (PC1) , so run this in Terminal:\nsudo apt-get install vsftpd\n\nAfter that has installed, it should be installed. Then run this:\nsudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf\n\nMake sure the write_enable line is set to YES:\nwrite_enable=YES\n\nalso remove any # at the beginning of that line.\nYou may also want to check this line:\nanonymous_enable=NO\n\nas if it is set to YES, or commented out with a #, it may allow access of anonymous users...\nSave with Ctrl+O, and exit with Ctrl+X.\nThen restart it with:\nsudo /etc/init.d/vsftpd restart\n\nYou can set up this on the other computer as well, so it is running on both computers, and you can access the data on both. The setup should be the same, just the Host IP address will be different.\n\nNow, to access it, you will need a 'client' on the computer (PC2) you are trying to access it from as well. For this, gFTP works nicely. First install it with:\nsudo apt-get install gftp\n\nStart it, and fill in the IP address of the computer you trying to access in the Host field - you can find it by running ifconfig | grep inet on the computer you are accessing.\nYou can ignore the Post field, but generally this will be 21 or something like that. \nThen type your Username and Password of your user on the computer you are accessing in the boxes on the right, and make sure the drop down box on the right is set to FTP.\nThen connect and it should work \n", "Q: Running Ubuntu on HP 250 I am a ubuntu n00b!

Fortunately, it is easy to fix as the Chrome repository is now already installed:\nsudo apt-get remove google-chrome-stable:i386\nsudo apt-get install google-chrome-stable\n\nTo also remove the unnecessarily installed 32-bit packages that you don't need anymore, run:\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nThen, you need to either restart Ubuntu or kill all running google-chrome processes:\nkillall google-chrome\n\nYour settings will all still be there, and windows and menus should look correctly now. \nTo fix this permanently for all 32-bit applications (e.g. Skype)\nYou need to install the 32-bit versions of the GTK2 packages responsible (source):\nsudo apt-get install gtk2-engines-murrine:i386 gtk2-engines-pixbuf:i386\n\nThen close and restart the 32-bit application.\n(both fixes tested and working on Ubuntu 14.04)\n\nA: Open ~/.config/google-chrome/Default/Preferences with a text editor and ensure that you have:\n  \"theme\": {\n     \"id\": \"\",\n     \"use_system\": true\n  },\n\n", "Q: how to apply changes when I don't have the unity plugin enables in ccsm I installed compizconfig-settings-manager so I can use my PC, but after checkmarking enable unity plugin, I realized there is no way to apply the changes and I am screwed and there is no way to use this PC without terminal.

It still seems fine for now, but should I fear a reboot?\n\nA: I don't understand your concerns. You ran this script on an Ubuntu machine which downloads some files and installs them to /dev/mtd0. If you are not running your Ubuntu from a flash card, then that /dev/mtd0 is an external device, why would this script cause any harm to your Ubuntu system? Your pogoplug device can be damaged, your Ubuntu system not likely.\nAlso from the output you provided it looks like the script didn't even touch the pogoplug device, just downloaded a bunch of files.\n", "Q: How to enable the Unity plugin without ccsm I can only see my desktop pic upon login and that is because unity plugin isn't enabled.\nI tried ccsm, but there is no way for me to apply changes so the unity plugin remains disabled.

I eventually figured out that Ubuntu had selected the HDMI sound device instead of my analogue speakers. I switched to the correct device and everything worked fine until I rebooted. I now have to select the correct device every time I boot Ubuntu. How do I set my speakers as the default device?\nEdit: Since i upgraded to Ubuntu 14.04 Ubuntu now selects the onboard sound device by default so I no longer have this problem.\n\nA: Run:\n$ pacmd list-cards\n\nTo display the index of your cards.  For example, my pci sound card is at index 2. The sound profile for analogue output (again as an example) is called \"output:analog-stereo\".\nThen: \n$ pacmd set-card-profile 2 output:analog-stereo\n\nTo set this as the output (give it a try).\nTo make it permanent, edit /etc/pulse/default.pa and add:\nset-card-profile 2  output:analog-stereo\nset-default-sink 2\n\nRestart pulseaudio or reboot to check persistence.\nIf you want to also set mic(input) defaults\nset-card-profile 2  output:analog-stereo+input:analog-stereo\nset-default-sink 2\n\n\nA: On the Dash, search for Multimedia Systems Selector.\nOpen it and in its Audio tab you can select the default audio Input and Output devices.\n\nThis application is installed by default in Ubuntu Installation.

Change the NoDisplay=true to NoDisplay=false\n\nA: The easiest solution for Ubuntu 16.04 was to create a script that listens when screen unlocks instead of script that listens to when system wakeups because it seems not all services are available at the instant that system wakes up. I couldn't get pulseaudio to switch to HDMI sound with a wakeup script but have successfully fixed it using the unlock listening script:\ndbus-monitor --session \"type='signal',interface='com.ubuntu.Upstart0_6'\" | \\\n(\n  while true; do\n    read X\n    if echo $X | grep \"desktop-lock\" &> /dev/null; then\n        echo \"screen locked\"\n    elif echo $X | grep \"desktop-unlock\" &> /dev/null; then\n      /usr/bin/pacmd set-card-profile 0 output:hdmi-surround+input:analog-stereo\n    fi\n  done\n)\n\n\nA: If you're using a newer 3.x gnome, show your launcher (default windows key) type settings -> sound.  Select a different default, close the window.\n\n\nA: There's also an Audio Output Switcher GNOME extension, which provides quick access:\n\n\nA: You can set the default by ordering the sound cards in ALSA with slots=. \nFind the driver module names for the sound cards you want to use by inspectinglsmod's output with: lsmod | grep -P '^snd[_]?[A-z]*' or just lsmod. For e.g. my Creative X-FI Xtreme Gamer is snd_ctxfi, my on-board is snd_hda_intel and my USB webcam is snd_usb_audio.\nNow open up in a text editor or nano your corresponding ALSA config file e.g. sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf and at the bottom add something of the following in order of precedence (the first declaration becomes default):\noptions snd slots=snd_ctxfi,snd_hda_audio,snd_usb_audio then to save just CTRL+o+enter & CTRL+x. Restart and you may be sorted.\n\nA: Firstly, thank you to user224082 for your solution which helped me discover which device I needed. \nTo find which ALSA device you need:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using Multimedia Systems Selector, choose ALSA — Advanced Linux Sound \nArchitecture for Plugin\n\n*Test the different options under Device until the desired speaker is\nselected\n\n*Make a note of the device= value in the Pipeline box. Mine was \"hw:0,4\"\nOnce you know which device you need, set it as the default:\nEdit default.pa by typing sudo nano /etc/pulse/default.pa\nAt the very bottom of the file, add:\nload-module module-alsa-sink sink_name=spkr device=hw:0,4\nset-default-sink spkr\n\nreplacing the device= value with your device.\n", "Q: How to share the wireless network through terminal?

Before last month I have taken a backup with Windows OS tools and I have then installed Ubuntu 12.04.\nNow I would like to install the backup-ed windows 8 OS along the side of Ubuntu. I don't how to do that and I fear losing my data while installing.\nI also want to know whether we can install Windows after Ubuntu has been installed.\n\nA: From what you said in the question, I'll assume that you have Windows 8 completely removed and you only have Ubuntu 12.04 on your laptop.\nHere is the steps that I would do, in summary, installing Windows 8 alongside Ubuntu first then restoring it from your backup\n\n\n*\n\n*Install GParted (search in the software center).  Here's a screenshot of it:\n\nRight click the Ubuntu partition and click \"Resize/Move\".  You will need at least 20 GB for Windows 8, which is 20480 MB.  Enter that in the \"Free Space Following\" box, or put a larger number if you need more space for Windows 8.\n\n*Grab a Windows 8 Installation CD and boot into it.  Enter you license key (next, next, next) and stop at this screen.\n \nChoose \"custom\".  Then select the Free space, create a new NTFS partition, and click on \"Next\".\n\n*By now you should have Windows 8 and Ubuntu on your computer, and your computer only boots into Windows 8.  Now boot into a Ubuntu Live CD or USB, and install Boot-Repair.  Type the following lines in the terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install boot-repair\nLaunch Boot Repair from the Dash, and select \"Advanced\"\n\nSelect \"Reinstall GRUB\".  Then apply and restart your computer after Boot Repair did its job.\n\n*Now you should be able to boot into both Windows 8 and Ubuntu with Windows 8 being a clean install.  Boot into Windows 8, then go to the \"Windows 7 File Recovery\" panel.\n\nPlug in the drive where your backup is located and Restore the backup.\n\n*Done!\n", "Q: Nintendo 64, mupen64plus: cannot configure controller I received an nintendo 64 usb controller and tried to use it to play (this one http://www.ebay.com/itm/Retrolink-Classic-Nintendo-64-USB-Controller-for-PC-and-MAC-BLACK-NEW-/360701283915?pt=US_Video_Game_Controllers&hash=item53fb78ce4b ).\nSo I put it,used this tutorial to install it http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=338457 and I can see with jstest that it's working.

My first approach was to install TeamViewer on the OS and then save a copy of the image. After cloning this image on other machines TeamViewer has got duplicated ID. This is expected because it is a whole copy of the hard disk. To avoid this duplication of TeamViewer ID I am trying to install it on first system boot-up. For this I have written a bash script that does the job but I am unable to find a place to put the invocation of this bash script. Since my desktop manager is lightDM I tried to place that call in /etc/init/lightdm.conf but then Ubuntu never starts X server for some reason. What options below should I use to get this working?\n\n\n*\n\n*If I'm to continue with the above approach where should I put my TeamViewer installation script? IMO it should be on a Upstart script that runs before window manager (In my case it is OpenBox)\n\n*Is this a good approach to install application on Ubuntu startup?\n\n*If I can remove TeamViewer configuration just before creating the image, what specific files should I remove to allow TeamViewer to pick up new ID. I am very specific to TeamViewer 9 (NOT 8 or 7)? This can be the easiest way to do this so that I don't have to run installation script on Ubuntu startup level. I have already done this for TeamViewer 7 where I delete \"wine\" folder of current user's home just before cloning. That way when I restore the image on a new machine it picks up a new ID. TeamViewer 9 may have changed this behaviour and it does not work now.\n\n\nA: Ok, Answering my own question, I got it working by invoking the TeamViewer installation script as a post script script. Embedding the TeamViewer installation script call in rc.local did not install it correctly.\n", "Q: Dell Dimension New RAM Installation Problems I Have tried pretty much everything to get this RAM (2x1GB PC2 5300/5400 DDR2 667MHz) to work. I am 99.9 percent sure it is compatible with my Dell Dimension C521. I know all the slots are working because my old RAM (2x512MB DDR2) works perfectly fine in all the slots (there are 4 slots). When I put in the New RAM and start up the computer my screen goes to sleep I hear 1 beep, 3 beeps, another 2 beeps and once again 2 more beeps (1-3-2-2). Then the fan goes on full blast and there is a green 1 and 3 indicator light that stays on. (Power button lights up green if you were wondering and mother board has the orange light as always). Either these BRAND NEW Sticks of RAM are shot or I need to update my BiOS which is almost impossible on Ubuntu, i cant figure it out. My current BiOS version is 1.1.4 but I am able to download version 1.1.11 I don't have access to a windows disk to run the EXE files either. Please Help ! and Thanks in Advance.\n\nA: It looks like you are mixing ram modules, you need to test each dimm seperately to make sure it works alone and if so then the problem lies in inserting two mismatched dimm's...  Preferably ram should be of the same type and speed to be 100% compatible...\n", "Q: Can i access /sdcard/ in ubuntu touch? i'm able to view ubuntu's user data from android. is it possible to view my sdcard from ubuntu ? \nnotes: i'm using the dual boot method explained here\n\nA: yes you can... i found out that the sdcard is already mounted so all i had to do was bind it to the home folder. i did this with adb so connect your phone via usb and type :\n$adb shell\n#su - phablet\n$sudo mkdir ~/Mount \n$sudo mount --bind /userdata/media/0 ~/Mount\n$sudo chmod 777 ~/Mount\n\nand now your content are visible from the file manager in ubuntu touch. you can add it to fstab to make it mount your files automatically at boot\n", "Q: Is there any way to make a hotkey turn the screen off? How can I make a script (or make some changes) to allow me to turn the screen off in Ubuntu (12.04) whenever I want, the way thevscreen can be turned off in Cellphones?\nAnd how can I make a combination of keys (a shortcut) to execute that script?\nI want to conserve power.\nI've seen this question \nTurning Monitor Off With an Icon but there is no hotkey for it.\nMoreover, in the answer, it is said that there are many ways to accomplish this so I'd like to know more. \n\nA: At the beginning I also configured a key shortcut with\nxset dpms force off\n\nBut after 2 seconds the display turned on again. Maybe my newer Ubuntu Version (15.05) is the reason for this different behaviour. The solution was to create a script with the following content:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nsleep 1 && xset dpms force off\n\nNow call this script every time you press the shortcut.\nI think this method works because of any delayed key press event. With the sleep command all key events have 1 second to be processed and they do not wake the screen up again.\n\nA: If I understood well your question, you could use this commmand\nxset dpms force off\n\nIn your settings, go to keyboard, shortcut, click on plus, write the name you want and past the command I just wrote, click on the new short cut and use the combination or key you want to use\n\nA: Custom shortcuts to do this with newer versions of Ubuntu (e.g. 16.04) seems to require a delay from pressing the key combination to running the command. The simplest solution is to modify the shortcut command using sh.\nGo to System Settings... | Keyboard | Shortcuts | Custom Shortcuts. Create a new custom shortcut and in Command put:\nsh -c 'sleep 0.3 && xset dpms force off'\n\nYou can change the delay but I found 0.1s was not quite enough sometimes.\n\n\nA: The command is xset dpms force off\nJust create a keyboard shortcut for it. Go to keyboard->shortcuts....go to custom shortcuts.....& then click on the + icon to create a new shortcut.\nThen assign the above & assign custom key combination.\n\nDONE!\n", "Q: Can't open file '/var/www/svn/repos/db/txn-current-lock': Permission denied on RapidSVN I tried to commit my modified file on SVN (RapidSVN).

To have my own calendar on different machines, I put the .ics file in my Dropbox folder and this works fine.\nI also would like to share in the same way the configuration files of lightning (for example to keep the same color events on all the machines, for the kind of events I defined myself).\nI try to share some files of the .thunderbird forlder by chance, but either nothing happens, or Thunderbird closes. So which are the good files?\nNote the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*the way I would like to share subfolders of the .thunderbird one is to put links in this one calling folders in my dropbox\n\n*I can't share all the .thunderbird folder, it is too big\n\n*I am running Ubuntu 12.04\nthanks!\n\nA: I got this to work, and here's how I did it:\nI use Thunderbird/Lightning as my email/calendar client on my main computer (Thinkpad W541, Ubuntu Unity, 16.04) and my travel Chromebook (Acer C720, Ubuntu XFCE, 16.04), and I wanted to regularly sync the calendar data between both machines.  Suggestions online often mention Google Calendar, but I'd rather use open-source tools (that I control) to do the job.  I use SeaFile (a FOSS DropBox equivalent) to sync folders & files between my machines.\nStep 1:  On my new Chromebook, I copy over my entire Thunderbird directory:\nrsync -zarv user@thinkpad:~/.thunderbird/  ~/.thunderbird/\nThen, I install Thunderbird and open it: presto, all my accounts, old emails, and (most importantly) calendar events are accessible. Great!\nStep 2: It looks like all relevant Thunderbird data are stored in ~/.thunderbird/blah.default/, with calendar data in ~/.thunderbird/blah.default/calendar-data/.  On the Chromebook, I create a new calendar event, save it, and see that ~/.thunderbird/blah.default/calendar-data/local.sqlite has increased in size and has a newer \"last-modified\" timestamp.  I conclude that local.sqlite contains all relevant calendar data.\nStep 3: I close Thunderbird on both machines, then use SeaFile to sync the entire calander-data/ folder on both.  I see that the newer filesize and timestamp have successfully synced on the Thinkpad. I open Thunderbird on the new machine, and there in the calendar is my new event.  Success!\nDrawbacks: \nThe main drawback seems to be that if Thunderbird is open on both machines and either calendar is edited, syncing the calendar-data files sometimes causes the other machine's Thunderbird to crash.  They just weren't built to handle that sort of I/O.  But otherwise: it works great!\n", "Q: How to change a keyboard layout to Dvorak that assumes that the keyboard layout is QWERTY? I use Dvorak as my primary keyboard layout. For writing in my native language(Bengali), I'd like to use the Probhat layout. But Probhat assumes that you are using a QWERTY layout. How do I make it understand that I'm using Dvorak so that it matches with the corresponding Dvorak keys?\nClarification: For example, when I press 'E'('D' in QWERTY), the Probhat layout understands it as a 'D'(ড). I want that it understands it as 'E'(ী).\n\nA: Method 1: using a text editor\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the file /etc/default/keyboard as root. For example, you can run sudo nano /etc/default/keyboard\n\n*Change the line XKBMODEL=\"pc105\" with your keyboard model (full list is here, starting from line 2).\n\n*Change the line XKBLAYOUT=\"en\" with your layout (presummably \"bd\".

(don’t forget to save a copy of the file you’re editing)\nIt should look like this\nkey <TLDE> { [dead_grave, dead_tilde,         grave,       asciitilde ] };\n\nkey <AE01> { [     1,     exclam,    exclamdown,      onesuperior ] };\nkey <AE02> { [     2,         at,   twosuperior, dead_doubleacute ] };\nkey <AE03> { [     3, numbersign, threesuperior,      dead_macron ] };\nkey <AE04> { [     4,     dollar,      currency,         sterling ] };\nkey <AE05> { [     5,    percent,      EuroSign,     dead_cedilla ] };\nkey <AE06> { [    6, dead_circumflex,    onequarter,      asciicircum ] };\nkey <AE07> { [     7,  ampersand,       onehalf,    dead_horn ] };\nkey <AE08> { [     8,   asterisk, threequarters,      dead_ogonek ] };\nkey <AE09> { [     9,  parenleft, leftsinglequotemark, dead_breve ] };\nkey <AE10> { [     0, parenright, rightsinglequotemark, dead_abovering ] };\nkey <AE11> { [ bracketleft,  braceleft,  guillemotleft, leftdoublequotemark ] };\nkey <AE12> { [bracketright, braceright, guillemotright, rightdoublequotemark ] };\n\nkey <AD01> { [dead_acute, dead_diaeresis, apostrophe,        quotedbl ] };\nkey <AD02> { [     comma,       less,      ccedilla,         Ccedilla ] };\nkey <AD03> { [    period,    greater, dead_abovedot,       dead_caron ] };\nkey <AD04> { [     p,          P,    odiaeresis,       Odiaeresis ] };\nkey <AD05> { [     y,          Y,    udiaeresis,       Udiaeresis ] };\n// key <AD06> { [      f,   F       ]   };\n// key <AD07> { [      g,   G       ]   };\nkey <AD08> { [     c,          C,     copyright,             cent ] };\nkey <AD09> { [     r,          R,    registered,       registered ] };\nkey <AD10> { [     l,          L,        oslash,         Ooblique ] };\nkey <AD11> { [     slash,   question,  questiondown,        dead_hook ] };\n// key <AD12> { [     equal,       plus,      multiply,         division ] };\n\nkey <AC01> { [     a,          A,        aacute,           Aacute ] };\nkey <AC02> { [     o,          O,        oacute,           Oacute ] };\nkey <AC03> { [     e,          E,        eacute,           Eacute ] };\nkey <AC04> { [     u,          U,        uacute,           Uacute ] };\nkey <AC05> { [     i,          I,        iacute,           Iacute ] };\nkey <AC06> { [     d,          D,           eth,              ETH ] };\n// key <AC07> { [      h,   H       ]   };\nkey <AC08> { [     t,          T,         thorn,            THORN ] };\nkey <AC09> { [     n,          N,        ntilde,           Ntilde ] };\nkey <AC10> { [     s,          S,        ssharp,          section ] };\n// key <AC11> { [     minus, underscore,           yen,    dead_belowdot ] };\n\nkey <AB01> { [ semicolon,      colon,     paragraph,           degree ] };\nkey <AB02> { [     q,          Q,    adiaeresis,       Adiaeresis ] };\n// key <AB03> { [      j,   J       ]   };\nkey <AB04> { [     k,          K,            oe,               OE ] };\n// key <AB05> { [      x,   X       ]   };\n// key <AB06> { [      b,   B       ]   };\nkey <AB07> { [     m,          M,            mu,               mu ] };\nkey <AB08> { [     w,          W,         aring,            Aring ] };\n// key <AB09> { [      v,   V       ]   };\nkey <AB10> { [     z,          Z,            ae,               AE ] };\n\nkey <BKSL> { [ backslash,        bar,       notsign,        brokenbar ] };\n\ninclude \"level3(ralt_switch)\"\n\nTo use to example you gave, on the line : key <AC03> replace e with U2496, which is the corresponding UTF code. \nIn the file /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/bd they use a coding like “0x10009EA” but I think you can use the UTF code you can find on this page.\nonce you’re done, you can save directly in either /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/us or /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/gb you were editing (which works just fine, it just means you have a bengali layout inside a file of english layouts), or you can just copy the result into the file /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/bd and replace the default layout with the one you just created. just be careful, and leave all this code as it is :\ndefault  partial alphanumeric_keys\nxkb_symbols \"basic\" {\n   name[Group1]= \"Bangla\";\n   key <ESC>  { [ Escape ] };\n\nThen all you need to do is to delete all .xkm files from \"/var/lib/xkb\"\nand you’re done, the layout you just edited is ready to be used. \nWhen I created my own layout using this tutorial (using the french layout bépo as a base to a russian layout that correspond to the bépo I’m used to) I couldn’t find to create a new layout, so that’s the way I used to make it happen.\nTo better illustrate this explanation, here is what my /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/fr file looks look. first you have the default bépo layout, and then you have my bépo/russian layout. Notice that only the second, third and fourth rows are edited. the code include \"fr(bepo)\" takes care of that, so that the first row of this layout is the first row of the default bépo layout.\n// Bépo : Improved ergonomic french keymap using Dvorak method.\n// Built by community on 'Dvorak Fr / Bépo' :\n// see http://www.clavier-dvorak.org/wiki/ to join and help.\n// XOrg integration (1.0rc2 version) in 2008\n// by Frédéric Boiteux <fboiteux at free dot fr>\n//\n// Bépo layout (1.0rc2 version) for a pc105 keyboard (french) :\n// ┌─────┐\n// │ S A │   S = Shift,  A = AltGr + Shift\n// │ s a │   s = normal, a = AltGr\n// └─────┘\n//\n// ┌─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┲━━━━━━━━━┓\n// │ # ¶ │ 1 „ │ 2 “ │ 3 ” │ 4 ≤ │ 5 ≥ │ 6   │ 7 ¬ │ 8 ¼ │ 9 ½ │ 0 ¾ │ ° ′ │ ` ″ ┃ ⌫ Retour┃\n// │ $ – │ \" — │ « < │ » > │ ( [ │ ) ] │ @ ^ │ + ± │ - − │ / ÷ │ * × │ = ≠ │ % ‰ ┃  arrière┃\n// ┢━━━━━┷━┱───┴─┬───┴─┬───┴─┬───┴─┬───┴─┬───┴─┬───┴─┬───┴─┬───┴─┬───┴─┬───┴─┬───┺━┳━━━━━━━┫\n// ┃       ┃ B ¦ │ É ˝ │ P § │ O Œ │ È ` │ !   │ V   │ D Ð │ L   │ J Ĳ │ Z Ə │ W   ┃Entrée ┃\n// ┃Tab ↹  ┃ b | │ é ˊ │ p & │ o œ │ è ` │ ˆ ¡ │ v ˇ │ d ð │ l / │ j ĳ │ z ə │ w ̆  ┃   ⏎   ┃\n// ┣━━━━━━━┻┱────┴┬────┴┬────┴┬────┴┬────┴┬────┴┬────┴┬────┴┬────┴┬────┴┬────┴┬────┺┓      ┃\n// ┃        ┃ A Æ │ U Ù │ I ˙ │ E ¤ │ ; ̛  │ C ſ │ T Þ │ S ẞ │ R ™ │ N   │ M º │ Ç , ┃      ┃\n// ┃Maj ⇬   ┃ a æ │ u ù │ i ̈  │ e € │ , ’ │ c © │ t þ │ s ß │ r ® │ n ˜ │ m ¯ │ ç ¸ ┃      ┃\n// ┣━━━━━━━┳┹────┬┴────┬┴────┬┴────┬┴────┬┴────┬┴────┬┴────┬┴────┬┴────┬┴────┲┷━━━━━┻━━━━━━┫\n// ┃       ┃ Ê   │ À   │ Y ‘ │ X ’ │ : · │ K   │ ? ̉  │ Q ̣  │ G   │ H ‡ │ F ª ┃             ┃\n// ┃Shift ⇧┃ ê / │ à \\ │ y { │ x } │ . … │ k ~ │ ' ¿ │ q ˚ │ g µ │ h † │ f ˛ ┃Shift ⇧      ┃\n// ┣━━━━━━━╋━━━━━┷━┳━━━┷━━━┱─┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴───┲━┷━━━━━╈━━━━━┻━┳━━━━━━━┳━━━┛\n// ┃       ┃       ┃       ┃ Espace inséc.

A kernel cannot be fully updated until the computer is restarted. If this does not work, try reinstalling 3.5.0-43.

Android is not Ubuntu, and the source code is the same everywhere. This should not be a problem unless you plan to run Android on the system, it might run slower on an older one.\n", "Q: Dropbox isn't started automatically despite the entry on startup applications I've added an entry at the startup applications for Dropbox to run this command:\ndropbox start -i.  \nAfter log on, dropbox isn't started.\nAlthough, when I run this dropbox start -i from the terminal Dropbox starts successfully.  \nIs there any log to see why it didn't start?\n\nA: Click on the dropbox icon on the top of your screen, hit \"preferences\" and tick the button where it says \"Start dropbox on system startup\" in the \"general\" tab.\nIf this doesn't work do it command line way :)\nCreate /etc/init.d/dropbox\n#!/bin/sh\n#dropbox service\nDROPBOX_USERS=\"user1 user2\"\n\nDAEMON=.dropbox-dist/dropbox\n\nstart() {\n   echo \"Starting dropbox...\"\n   for dbuser in $DROPBOX_USERS; do\n       HOMEDIR=`getent passwd $dbuser | cut -d: -f6`\n       if [ -x $HOMEDIR/$DAEMON ]; then\n           HOME=\"$HOMEDIR\" start-stop-daemon -b -o -c $dbuser -S -u $dbuser -x $HOMEDIR/$DAEMON\n       fi\n   done\n}\n\nstop() {\n   echo \"Stopping dropbox...\"\n   for dbuser in $DROPBOX_USERS; do\n       HOMEDIR=`getent passwd $dbuser | cut -d: -f6`\n       if [ -x $HOMEDIR/$DAEMON ]; then\n           start-stop-daemon -o -c $dbuser -K -u $dbuser -x $HOMEDIR/$DAEMON\n       fi\n   done\n}\n\nstatus() {\n   for dbuser in $DROPBOX_USERS; do\n       dbpid=`pgrep -u $dbuser dropbox`\n       if [ -z $dbpid ] ; then\n           echo \"dropboxd for USER $dbuser: not running.\"\n       else\n           echo \"dropboxd for USER $dbuser: running (pid $dbpid)\"\n       fi\n   done\n}\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n\n   start)\n       start\n       ;;\n   stop)\n       stop\n       ;;\n   restart|reload|force-reload)\n       stop\n       start\n       ;;\n   status)\n       status\n       ;;\n   *)\n       echo \"Usage: /etc/init.d/dropbox {start|stop|reload|force-reload|restart|status}\"\n       exit 1\n\nesac\n\nexit 0\n\nMake sure to change line 3  to your computer username not the dropbox user\nDROPBOX_USERS=\"user1 user2\" \nand on line 5 make sure you got the right execute file in dropbox-dist\n'DAEMON=.dropbox-dist/dropbox' \nmine had to be DAEMON=.dropbox-dist/dropboxd\nThen make the script executable and add it to the system startup:\nsudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/dropbox \nsudo update-rc.d dropbox defaults\n\nyou can test the script by writing \nsudo /etc/init.d/dropbox start\n\n", "Q: How do I install Ubuntu on to a second Hard Drive? I have 2 HDD in my computer at the moment... One 2TB HDD that is running Windows 8 and one 1TB HDD that I would like to install Ubuntu on. I bought the second HDD so that the two don't have to conflict with each other at all!\nHow do I install Ubuntu onto my second HDD, without affecting my first, and then when I boot up my computer, how can I choose between which OS to use? I have seen it at a friends house: they have a black screen on startup which they can then choose whether they want Windows or Linux.\n\nA: Boot up your Ubuntu install media and choose instal Ubuntu. When it gets to the Install Along Side Windows options screen, pick the one at the buttom saying something like \"Something Else\". This will get you to the partitioner, where you can select the drives and installs as you want. Select your 1 TB drive (probably called /dev/sdb and format it so it uses the ext4 file system. This will make Ubuntu get on the 1 TB drive without touching the 2 TB drive. \nAfter this it gets tricky.\nThe black screen you refer to is the Windows Boot Manager. I don't know how to get that to show up instead of Grub.\nIf you want Grub Bootloader instead, always install it on the first drive (usually /dev/sda).\n", "Q: Dropbox sync status is not visible in Xubuntu. Is this normal or only with me? As on Windows there are no icons showing syncing or the green tick showing sync is complete. All folders and files are just regular folder and files. Is this normal with Xubuntu? Though when hovering pointer to Dropbox icon it tells that syncing is going on or complete but this should also be visible on files.\n\nA: Yes this is normal. Dropbox client only supports Nautilus/Files (it's default Ubuntu and Ubuntu Gnome file manager), sync status on files are only displayed on it or in some of its forks (like Nemo).\nXubuntu uses Thunar as its file manager. There is a plugin for Thunar that will enable some basic Dropbox integration, only rigth-click menu options, not emblems.\n\nA: As a workaround, you can use caja file manager (instead of thunar) along with caja-dropbox, which precisely shows sync icons on each file within dropbox.\n", "Q: Creating a bootable USB Stick using OS X without sudo I'm using OS X Mavericks and I have downloaded Ubuntu.

But be sure you have saved everything important from the USB Stick, because this command erases it, too.\n", "Q: Make touchscreen working with Ubuntu 13.10 on Dell XPS13 I just installed Ubuntu 13.10 on my new Dell XPS 13 laptop but I cannot make the touchscreen working.\nThe OS sees the SYNAPTICS touchscreen:\nste@ste-XPS13-9333:~$ xinput list\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                      id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Logitech USB Receiver                     id=9    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Logitech USB Receiver                     id=10   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad                id=13   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ SYNAPTICS Synaptics Large Touch Screen    id=15   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n\nIt's enabled apparently:\nDevice 'SYNAPTICS Synaptics Large Touch Screen':\nDevice Enabled (134):   1\nCoordinate Transformation Matrix (136): 1.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000, 1.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000, 1.000000\nDevice Accel Profile (264): 0\nDevice Accel Constant Deceleration (265):   1.000000\nDevice Accel Adaptive Deceleration (266):   1.000000\nDevice Accel Velocity Scaling (267):    10.000000\nDevice Product ID (253):    1739, 2808\nDevice Node (254):  \"/dev/input/event14\"\nEvdev Axis Inversion (268): 0, 0\nEvdev Axis Calibration (269):   0, 2972, 0, 1680\nEvdev Axes Swap (270):  0\nAxis Labels (271):  \"Abs MT Position X\" (576), \"Abs MT Position Y\" (577), \"None\" (0), \"None\" (0)\nButton Labels (272):    \"Button Unknown\" (256), \"Button Unknown\" (256), \"Button Unknown\" (256), \"Button Wheel Up\" (140), \"Button Wheel Down\" (141)\nEvdev Middle Button Emulation (273):    0\nEvdev Middle Button Timeout (274):  50\nEvdev Third Button Emulation (275): 0\nEvdev Third Button Emulation Timeout (276): 1000\nEvdev Third Button Emulation Button (277):  3\nEvdev Third Button Emulation Threshold (278):   20\nEvdev Wheel Emulation (279):    0\nEvdev Wheel Emulation Axes (280):   0, 0, 4, 5\nEvdev Wheel Emulation Inertia (281):    10\nEvdev Wheel Emulation Timeout (282):    200\nEvdev Wheel Emulation Button (283): 4\nEvdev Drag Lock Buttons (284):  0\n\nBut when I start the calibration procedure:\nxinput_calibrator \nCalibrating EVDEV driver for \"SYNAPTICS Synaptics Large Touch Screen\" id=15\n\nThe touchscreen just doesn't work.

The steps I followed were:\n\n\n*\n\n*Visit the Dell Support site and entered the service tag for my XPS13\n\n*Selected Get Drivers > View All Drivers\n\n*Changed the selected OS to Ubuntu 12.04\n\n*Downloaded 'Ubuntu Driver Support Pack for Dell XPS 13 Haswell'\n\n*Extracted the contents of that file and installed 'config-usbhid-synaptics-touchscreen_1_all.deb'\n\n*Rebooted.\n\n\nAfter that the touchscreen worked. I haven't installed any of the other drivers from the pack as everything else seems to be working ok.   \n", "Q: Thunderbird on dual boot - profile inaccessible I'm a first-time Ubuntu user - I've just put 13.10 on my XP system as a dual boot.\nI used Thunderbird portable on the XP machine (easy to recover every time you need a rebuild!), and I understand that you can use the same profile on Ubuntu - sharing the profile location by indicating its location in the profiles.ini file.  So I did this using -profilemanager, and it worked nicely. I could access exactly the same data on Ubuntu as I could on Windows.\nHowever, after I turned off and rebooted, I got this message when I started Thunderbird:\n'Thunderbird profile cannot be loaded - it may be missing or inaccessible'\nI looked at the profile.ini file with a text editor - it hadn't changed and was still pointing to the right directory. If I deleted it with -profilemanager and re-installed, it worked fine for that session. I could drop Thunderbird and start it again - no trouble. But if I re-booted, I lost the profile and had to re-establish it - although the profile.ini file hadn't changed.\nI wonder if this is some kind of privileges issue? Whatever it is, I can't think of any more things to try. Has someone out there got any ideas?\n\nA: I have just done the same thing. Created a dual boot machine with XP on one partition and Linux on the other. Then I pointed Thunderbird on each partition to the profile on the XP partition. When starting the Android Thunderbird I got the missing profile error. But i found that if I first clicked on the XP partition drive while in Android everything worked ok. I am now trying to work out how to initiate the XP drive when booting the Android ... all new to me!\n\nA: The Question is a bit older, but still worth an answer.\nThe partition where the Thunderbird-profile is stored must be mounted, otherwise Thunderbird can not load the profile.\nExample:\nI have my Thunderbird-profile stored on a Windows Partition (NTFS).\nI created a folder named DATA in my home-directory. This folder is my mount-point.\nThen I added a line to /etc/fstab with sudo nano fstab\nUUID=01CAFB06CD224070  /home/mook/DATA  ntfs  rw,noexec  0 0\nWith this additional line in /etc/fstab the partition where the profile is stored will be auto-mounted during boot and Thunderbird is able to load the profile.\nYou can find out the correct UUID for your partition with sudo blkid.\nNote:\nThe partition I mount is not my Windows-system-partition, it is a pure data-partition. Normally I never mount my Windows-system-partition to Ubuntu as I could accidentally destroy or corrupt my Windows. But mounting the Windows-system-partition is possible in the same way, you just have to be more careful then.\n", "Q: Fix dependency when apt-get -f install fails I'm trying to get cgminer 3.5 on my Ubuntu 12.04 to work but it fails because libudev.so.1 is missing.

I therefore want all the changes to apply to every public file served (root dir and all other files).\nWhen I read https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache, I get the understanding that var/www should apply to all subdirs, however the Options -Indexes rule clearly does not work (subdir indexes are visible). When I try var/www/* the indexes no longer show, but other rules are not applied to the root dir.\nI can isolate this issue:\n<Directory \"var/www/*\">\n\n    <IfModule mod_autoindex.c>\n        Options -Indexes\n    </IfModule>\n\n</Directory>\n\nDisables listing of subdirs, whereas:\n<Directory \"var/www\">\n\n    <IfModule mod_autoindex.c>\n        Options -Indexes\n    </IfModule>\n\n</Directory>\n\nDoes not.\nHow can I apply the directive to both, and all included files?\n\nA: To assign global options like Options -Indexes you can insert them in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/autoindex.conf, or perhaps more elegant: create a file /etc/apache2/conf.d/autoindex with your modifications. Don't forget the IfModule directives before and after your options.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 does not boot after install I have a new Lenovo ThinkPad E540. I have successfully installed Ubuntu 12.04 after the installation I receive the 'remove all ... and press any key to restart'. No I receive the selection menu (note that I erased the entire disk and now only Ubuntu is installed!!), but after I clicked on Ubuntu I got black screen with a blinking white underline character in the left top corner.\nI read about disabling the UEFI mode in the BIOS, which I did, but I still got the same result.\n\n\n\nI reinstalled everything again. After choosing Ubuntu in the GRUB menu the display stays black but I get to the login screen -> noticed by the sound of the drums!!\nThe graphic card is a NVIDIA GeForce GT 740M.\nError before the login screen:\n\n\nA: If you hear the login sound, but can't see anything, then it is likely that your backlight didn't turn on (or turned off). Try booting with the following kernel parameters:\nthinkpad-acpi.brightness_enable=1 acpi_backlight=vendor\n\nTo add those parameters: While GRUB is shown press e on the Ubuntu menu entry in grub2, this will take you to edit mode and add the following option to the kernel line (add it to the end of the line which starts with \"linux\")\nthinkpad-acpi.brightness_enable=1 acpi_backlight=vendor\n\nThen press CTRL+x to boot with the edited kernel command line.\nAfter you succeed with the boot just edit your /etc/default/grub file and add the working kernel line parameter to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT= line. After you edited the file run\nsudo update-grub\n\nto save the kernel line for later boots.\n\nAfter looking at the logs I would advise you to try these:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go into your BIOS and change you graphics to only use the integrated intel VGA card. Looking at the Lenovo user guide you can do this at the Config->Display->Graphics Device option, change that to Integrated Graphics. (You may also need to change Config->Display->OS Detection for switchable graphics to Disabled) In the live session the intel card was used, and you had no problems, but the installed ubuntu is trying to use the proprietary nvidia driver. \n\n*You may try booting with the nomodeset kernel parameter which usually solves problems with the nvidia driver. (But I don't know how nomodeset behaves with switchable graphics)\n\n*For me your logs doesn't show anything failing (but the constant (II) modesetting(G0): Modeline \"1920x1080\"x0.0  151.60  1920 2010 2070 2220  1080 1086 1095 1138 -hsync -vsync (68.3 kHz eP) might mean that there is a problem, I don't know this.), so I still think that this might be only a problem with the backlight not turning on. So you may try increasing the backlight with the backlight combos on your keyboard. \n\n\nAfter you manage to solve this booting problem, then you can try searching for a solution on how to enable bumblebee or prismus to utilize both of your cards without failures.  \n\nA: Did you install it alongside with Windows?\nMy recommendation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Please install it again. (with or without Windows. It's your decision)\n\n*Install only using bootable CD/DVD (no flash drive)\n\n\nTry & report.

I am currently having the following issue:\nClose lid of laptop - laptop suspends\nOpen lid of laptop - laptop resumes\nSelect Shutdown from menu - computer reboots\n\nSuspend computer from menu - laptop suspends\nPress key on keyboard - laptop resumes\nSelect Shutdown from menu - computer shuts down\n\nSuspend computer from menu - laptop suspends\nClose laptop lid - no action\nOpen lid of laptop - laptop resumes\nSelect Shutdown from menu - computer reboots\n\nI have looked at dmesg, kern.log, pm-suspend.log but not found any information that appears useful. While this may be a bug I would still like to know what log files I should be examining.\n\nUPDATE: 12/31/2013\nThis issue is related to having an Anker USB 3.0 hub attached to the laptop. The problem does not happen unless the hub is attached. Not sure why the USB hub would be an issue, but there is some interaction between this USB hub and suspend/resume.\n\nUPDATE: 1/2/2014\nIt appears that the issue is just using the USB 3.0 port. I am wondering how to check and see what settings a USB hub gets in regards to being able to wakeup the computer. Perhaps the hub is getting set incorrectly on resume.\n\nA: You seem to be assuming that there are a) log files and b) that those log files are persistent, or at the very least, rotated, rather than deleted at reboot or log in time.\nIdentifying which log file to look for is difficult, because you'd need to know which process or component is actually causing the problem. For example, it could simply be a bug on the client side, and not a system level process. The problem could be in gnome-session, gnome-settings-daemon, or indicator-session on the client side, none of which I think have log files, or necessarily use extensive logging in their code. They seem to just dump any warnings or log messages that occur, to STDERR or STDOUT, so you'd need to look at ~/.xsession-errors to see what they output. However, that file is replaced every time you log in, and I do not know that if it is rotated or not. You can enable more verbose logging by ensuring that G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=all is set in the environment, by exporting in ~/.profile or in a file added in the /etc/profile.d/ directory. It may or may not give you more information where you want it, though.\nThe best thing you can do in these situations is to first file a bug in the highest level component (where you're making the clicks, in this case, the indicator-session package), and see if the maintainers/developers can perform the same actions to get the same results, and work downward to the lower levels from there, with their help.\n", "Q: Script to search directories for .deb files and copy them for another location If i have a directory A that contain directories B , C , D  I need a script that search\nDirectories B , C , D for .deb files and if found copy them to a location i choose . \nThis script should reduce effort of hand search and copy .\nAny idea ?\n\nA: Doesn't look like you've tried anything, but anyway. Here's the line, man find will do the talking if you're actually interested.\nfind /path/to/A -name \"*.deb\" -exec mv {} /path/to/new_directory \\; # Moves\nfind /path/to/A -name \"*.deb\" -exec cp {} /path/to/new_directory \\; # Copies\n\nWill move .deb files from A (recursive search) to new_directory. By the way, this is more *nix-related than Ubuntu-specific.\n\nA: If you don't need to search recursively, then a simple bash brace expansion \ncp -t /location/you/choose/ /path/to/A/{B,C,D}/*.deb\n\nshould work. If you want to search all subdirectories of A recursively, then the most portable way would probably be\nfind /path/to/A -name '*.deb' -exec cp -t /location/you/choose/ {} +\n\nIf your shell supports it, you could also use the globstar shell option to make cp recursive without using find - type shopt or help shopt at the shell prompt for more information. If you need to exclude certain subdirectories then you could add a -prune to the find command.\nAs always you need to think ahead about what you want to do in case of non-unique filenames - you could add a -n or --no-clobber to the cp command, or use the --backup=numbered option. In the case of deb files it probably doesn't matter, since (barring file corruption) any non-unique filenames should correspond to exact duplicate files.\n", "Q: How to access localhost using rdesktop? installed android x86 in virtualbox on my host Ubuntu 13.10.

It can access my android device memory card (my Android device has micro SD card slot with micro SD card inserted to the device) . Ubuntu can recognize the micro SD card (yes, your android act as a card reader in MSC method) and mount it automatically. You can set this in your Android device (locate in USB connectivity settings)\nSo far, Android actually use internal memory to store some important data like contacts, and you can only access it using MTP method, which, to what I know, only Windows supports that type of USB connections.\nThere's another, perhaps an alternative, is to use Cloud service, or use Google Sync to do synchronization (of course over the internet). \n", "Q: Copy all files whose hashes don't match I currently have a hash list (known good) of a selection of various files.

Noob question: when using the 64bit version of ubuntu (xubuntu in this case) and I install something through the software center, will it get the 64bit app for me?\n\nA: Yes. Software Center, as well as Synaptic, poke around in your system and determine what you need, and get it for you, 64-bit or 32-bit.\n\nA: It will get the 64 bit app(if its available) if you are using the 64 bit version of ubuntu\n\nA: The software center is just a frontend for aptdaemon, which is a transaction based package management service. It behaves the same way as apt-get, which reads the current architecture. If you select a package to install it will check the current architecture and install it.\n\nA: By default, yes. But most apps is in 32-bit. The only 64-bit apps is drivers, kernels, and maybe some utilities software. \n32-bit apps usually include a code to check for 64-bit OS, if detected, it'll automatically enable all 64-bit features, otherwise it'll stay as 32-bit (x86). This is because there are some computers which couldn't run (or don't have) 64-bit OS. As a software developer, it will be too cumbersome to provide 32-bit and 64-bit software separately, and 32-bit is universal, can be run on both 32-bit and 64-bit OS.

I wanted to donate, as I've done before, without any other returns than the privilege of using the software. I thought I was entering billing info so that my credit card would be charged directly, but instead it appears the site forces me to go through PayPal! While I do have a PayPal account, I don't like to use it much. So I ended up canceling the contribution. I sure don't know why Ubuntu sets up the donation feature thusly - it turns me off.\nIf you want people to contribute voluntarily, make it easy for them and not force one to use a certain payment method. \n\nA: snip\n\nIf you want people to contribute voluntarily,   \n\nsnip\nWell, we are not the people who work for Ubuntu, we are volunteers here. \nThe Contact Us page linked from Ubuntu's website states, in part,  \n\nIf you have suggestions or corrections for ubuntu.com or\n  canonical.com, email us at webmaster@ubuntu.com or\n  webmaster@canonical.com.\n\nwhich is the best way to contact Ubuntu folks about this issue.\n\nI thought I was entering billing info so that my credit card would be charged directly,\n\nWhen I look at the pre-download page, the donation button clearly states PayPal and immediately to its left is the no donation link. Therefore, don't see how you could have thought you were setting up a charge to your card account, and the address collection is so the Ubuntu T-shirt (part of the deal on that page) could be shipped to you.\n", "Q: .Flac files on Ipod Classic? I'm super new to Linux, being a Windows user my whole life, and I'm really trying to learn as much as I can.  When I made the switch, I took my 42+ GB collection of music (Previously handled in Itunes) with me, with over 500 songs in .wav format.  Wanting tag support, I've converted all of these files to .flac successfully through Soundconverter, but just now found out that my Ipod Classic won't play .flac files!\nSo, now I'm looking for a way to get these files onto my Ipod and play them.  I don't care if I have to update its firmware, convert these .flac files to Apple Lossless or any other method, whether through a program or the terminal, all I care about is I want to retain tag support and have them in a lossless format.  Any suggestions??\n\nA: I think you'll have to convert your .flac files to apple loseless format (ALAC) to be able to play them with your ipod. You'll also be able to play your alac files using music player available on Ubuntu.\nHere is explanations to convert flac files to alac files.\nIf you've a lot of files to convert, it can be a good idea to write a script that will convert your files. If you need help for that, ask a new question.\n", "Q: Does having 4 installed OS affect my RAM usage? I installed 4 Os's(Ubuntu 13.04,Ubuntu 13.10,Windows 8,Windows 8.1 in logical partition) on my HDD.\nDoes this configuration may affect my RAM in some other ways?\n\nA: No, the RAM is all given to the active operating system unless you are running another operating system simultaneously by creating a virtual machine.\n\nA: Not at all, your 4 os are on your HDD, so you will choose one on the boot menu, so the others won't be solicited by anyway on the computer.\n\nA: RAM is temporary memory which is cleared when your computer is totally off. If you boot into one OS, the OS will only use the RAM and not other OS-es since you are not booting into it and it is not running.\n", "Q: Missing ia32-libs I'm trying to install TeamViewer 9 from deb file however it says it needs ia32-libs so it won't install:\nI tried to do some fix with sudo apt-get dist-upgrade but:\n$ sudo apt-get install ia32-libs-multiarch\nReading package lists...

For what I understand, when the system is close to have no free memory, the kernel should start to kill processes to regain some memory. But in my system this does not happen at all.\nSuppose a simple script that just allocates much more memory than the available in the system (an array with millions of strings, for example). If I run a script like this (as a normal user), it just gets all the memory until the system completely freezes (only SysRQ REISUB works).\nThe weird part here is that when the computer freezes, the hard drive led turns on and stays that way until the computer is rebooted, either if I have a swap partition mounted or not!\nSo my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this behavior normal? It's odd that an application executed as a normal user can just crash the system this way...\n\n*Is there any way I can make Ubuntu just kill automatically those applications when they get too much (or the most) memory?\n\n\nAdditional information\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 12.04.3\n\n*Kernel 3.5.0-44\n\n*RAM: ~3.7GB from 4GB (shared with graphics card).\n*\n$ tail -n+1 /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_*\n==> /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory <==\n0\n\n==> /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio <==\n50\n\n$ cat /proc/swaps\nFilename                Type        Size    Used    Priority\n/dev/dm-1                               partition   4194300 344696  -1\n\n\nA: You can try earlyoom, an OOM killer that operates in user space and tries to kill the largest process in an OOM situation. \n\nA: From the official /proc/sys/vm/* documentation:\n\noom_kill_allocating_task\nThis enables or disables killing the OOM-triggering task in\n  out-of-memory situations.\nIf this is set to zero, the OOM killer will scan through the entire\n  tasklist and select a task based on heuristics to kill.  This normally\n  selects a rogue memory-hogging task that frees up a large amount of\n  memory when killed.\nIf this is set to non-zero, the OOM killer simply kills the task that\n  triggered the out-of-memory condition.  This avoids the expensive\n  tasklist scan.\nIf panic_on_oom is selected, it takes precedence over whatever value\n  is used in oom_kill_allocating_task.\nThe default value is 0.\n\nIn order to summarize, when setting oom_kill_allocating_task to 1, instead of scanning your system looking for processes to kill, which is an expensive and slow task, the kernel will just kill the process that caused the system to get out of memory.\nFrom my own experiences, when a OOM is triggered, the kernel has no more \"strength\" enough left to do such scan, making the system totally unusable.\nAlso, it would be more obvious just killing the task that caused the problem, so I fail to understand why it is set to 0 by default.\nFor testing, you can just write to the proper pseudo-file in /proc/sys/vm/, which will be undone on the next reboot:\necho 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/oom_kill_allocating_task\n\nFor a permanent fix, write the following to /etc/sysctl.conf or to a new file under /etc/sysctl.d/, with a .conf extension (/etc/sysctl.d/local.conf for example):\nvm.oom_kill_allocating_task = 1\n\n\nA: Update: The bug is fixed.\nTeresa's answer is enough to workaround the problem and is good. \nAdditionally, I've filed a bug report because that is definitely a broken behavior.\n\nA: First of all I recommend the update to 13.10 (clean install, save your data).\nIf you don't want to update change the vm.swappiness to 10 and if you find problems with your ram install zRAM.\n", "Q: Can I instal Ubuntu from the command line? I'm trying to install Ubuntu.\nI've done this a thousand times and usually it's fine. However, this time it has got the screen fonts all far too large. So I can't actually get the mouse to a lot of the buttons and options, making it impossible to install.\nI've had some minimal success by rotating the display by 90 degrees which lets me get to a few options, but this (a) makes my head hurt and (b) only gets me so far.\nSo I'd like a way to install using the command line. How do I do this?\n\nA: I don't think there's a way to install Ubuntu only using the command line. If you check on the ubuntu wiki install methods page. Check the alternate cd who provide an expert mode installation.\n\nExpert mode is accessed by pressing F6 in the boot menu, to access \"Other Options\", and then F6 again to be presented with another menu. In this menu the first choice is \"Expert mode\". This causes the installer to ask questions about virtually everything it does. It's supposed to be powerful rather than friendly, so the developers don't pay a lot of attention to UI warts in this mode; however, it should at least work to the point where you can complete an installation. If you like, you can try playing around with non-default answers to the questions it asks, and make sure its responses are appropriate.\n\n", "Q: Intel Graphic 3rd with 12.4 \"nomodeset\" working but?

I have 4GB of RAM and I want to install Ubuntu. Do I need a to have a swap partition? Because my computer has 4GB RAM, I do not think it is necessary to have a swap partition. If I do need to have a swap partition, should it be a 4GB or an 8GB partition?\n\nA: Whether you need swap space or not depends on the number and type of applications that you run.  I have a desktop system with 6 GB of RAM and no swap configured.  99.9% of the time that works fine for me.  Performance is good and I can run many concurrent applications.  However I can recall at least two times when my system slowed to the point where it became totally unresponsive due to excessive memory use.  In one of those cases I was able to bring up a console window and kill one of the big memory using tasks.  In another case I could not even do that and my only choice was to pull the plug on the system, losing everything that was in progress.\nWe don't know whether your usage patterns are like mine however, if I were doing it again, I would have configured some swap space.\nIn my case, 8 GB total would have been adequate.  Unless you are greatly strapped for disk space, I therefore recommend that you dedicate 4 GB for swap.  8 GB won't hurt you but is less important if you can use the disk space for more important things.\n\nA: Si. Una partición de swap de 4GB (8GB no es necesario) hará que su sistema sea mucho más estable y es muy recomendable. Cuando el sistema se queda sin memoria libre, se canjeará a la partición de intercambio, y si no hay una partición de intercambio, el sistema se arrastra a un alto. La función de hibernación también necesita de intercambio para trabajar.  \n--\nA swap partition of 4GB (8GB is not required) will make your system much more stable and is highly recommended. When the system runs out of free memory, memory contents will be exchanged into the swap partition, and if there is no swap partition, the system crawls to a halt. Hibernation also needs swap to function.\n\nA: If you are using a HDD it's not good to use a swap partition since HDDs are very slow and you have 4 gb ram than you don't need one .\n", "Q: Mining feathercoins in ubuntu?

Running Juju 1.17.0.\n\nA: Juju 1.17.0 has a new bootstrap mechanism, which may be to blame here. There's a few possible answers I can think of:\n\n\n*\n\n*There's a problem with your SSH keys. This seems unlikely, but the way bootstrap works now is that your public keys will be added to the newly started machine's ~ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys. Thus, logging in should not require a password.\n\n*The cloud-init script isn't initialising authorized_keys properly. Also seems unlikely.\n\n*The IP address is routable, but not for the correct machine.\n\n\nIn the log you've provided, there are three IPs: which is the public one according to CloudVPS? While trying to bootstrap, you could try, in parallel, to ssh to each of the IPs as the ubuntu user (ssh ubuntu@ip). If none of them works, then I'd suggest logging a bug against Juju; if one of them works, then I think that would suggest point 3 above.\n\nA: The issues were related to the CloudVPS Compute beta, should be fixed when the platform goes public.\n", "Q: Can I install Ubuntu into an Acer Aspire 5634 WLMI notebook? I have an Acer Aspire 5634 WLMI notebook running Windows Xp.\nCan I install Ubuntu in this machine ? \nIs there anybody who already did it ?\n\nA: This article states that your model has a 1.83 GHz processor, 1 GB of RAM, and 120 GB storage. If that is correct, you meet the installation requirements of 700 MHz processing speed, 512 MiB RAM, and 5 GB storage space. Assuming you have a functioning USB port or optical drive, you can install Ubuntu.\n\nA: Yes.

I don't really want to change that.\nSo how can I mount my drives with executive permissions using the launcher icons??\n\nA: I fixed it using the following command: \nsudo mount -t ntfs -o rw,auto,defaults,exec /dev/disk/by-label/Data /mnt/Data \nand setting it to a keyboard shortcut\n\nA: I apologize in advance if I misunderstood your case, I do not play games so I have no experience with steam.\nBut if your question how can I mount my drives with executive permissions using the launcher icons? describes completely what you need, then one of the possible solutions to this can be changing permissions on the mountpoint after the drive has been mounted. At least in Ubuntu 14.04 these permissions as well as ownership of the mountpoint are remembered by the system.\nSo, for instance, you have a drive and want to mount it via unity launcher. Then you should:\n\n\n*\n\n*mount it as usual\n\n*change permissions of the mountpoint: chmod 755 mountpoint; (it may require root rights)\n\n\nAfter this whenever you mount your drive via the same launcher the drive will be mounted with the remembered permissions and owner.\nAs muru pointed, this will not work in case one uses NTFS filesystem\n", "Q: Downloading for bootable USB (lubuntu) - torrent vs download of standard image? I think I'd better apologize right away for probably kind of stupid questions, I'm a real beginner when it comes to Linux or basically setting up operating systems at all.

However, I'm willing to learn and since my way is trying out and I have a netbook I hardly use (HP mini 210-1000), I want to give it a try; there's nothing to lose (except my dignity ;-))\nSo far I'm under the impression that I should try out lubuntu and I have a USB stick I can use for booting.

Looking up \"torrent file\" and finding out\n  that it has something to do with metadata has not really been helpful.\n\nA 'torrent' download uses the Bittorrent system where, once your machine downloads part of a file, it also uploads that to other folks seeking that file on Bittorrent. Wikipedia explains that in greater detail. You will likely finish the download more rapidly with a torrent IF you have a torrent client on the downloading machine, but it certainly is not required, and downloading the standard image is AOK. \n\nA: If you want to boot an Ubuntu environment from a external hard drive, LinuxLiveUSB is a highly recommended software. They are also very good documentation on setting it up (shouldn't take more than 30 minutes).\n\nA: To install Ubuntu via USB stick, without burning a dvd, just download a standard ISO (an image containing the Operating System) and then use some tool to make a bootable USB with your new Linux on it, ready to be booted and tried/installed.\nSome links for you:\nlink for Lubuntu 32bit:\nhttp://cdimage.ubuntu.com/lubuntu/releases/13.10/release/lubuntu-13.10-desktop-i386.iso\nand the one of the most useful tool to create a bootable USB pen drive with your favorite Linux  distribution - Unetbootin for windows:\nhttp://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/unetbootin-windows-latest.exe\nFist of all, plug your USB pen drive.\nOnce opened Unetbootin, click on the \"disk image\" little button (left side of the window) and then on the [...], the three dots button on the left.\nNow browse for your downloaded ISO file, choose it, click OK on the main window and wait for the whole process to end.\nOne of the advantages about using Unetbootin is that if the pendrive has sufficient free space, you don't have to format it, but you can have both your personal data and your Linux distribution for a live boot.\nOn completion, before rebooting the PC, be sure to set the BIOS to boot from the removable/USB drive, and not from the Windows partition. \nMost importantly, read something about the partitioning tool integrated with Ubuntu, and on how to install Windows and Linux side by side (it's really simple when you get the basics).\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Cant install AlsaProject I need help because I can't install alsaproject utils.\nThis is the message I get when trying to install:\ngaston@Small1:~/Descargas/alsa-utils-1.0.27.2$ ./configure\nchecking for a BSD-compatible install... /usr/bin/install -c\nchecking whether build environment is sane... yes\nchecking for a thread-safe mkdir -p... /bin/mkdir -p\nchecking for gawk... no\nchecking for mawk... mawk\nchecking whether make sets $(MAKE)... yes\nchecking whether to enable maintainer-specific portions of Makefiles... yes\nchecking whether NLS is requested... yes\nchecking for msgfmt... no\nchecking for gmsgfmt... :\nchecking for xgettext... no\nchecking for msgmerge... no\nchecking for style of include used by make...

When you install Apache, PHP's default folder is /var/www/ by default. Some developers find it necessary to change the root directory to something like:\n/home/public_html/ (many shared hosting environments use this)\n/home/user/\nOf course, this requires some tweaking and if you're in the development phase perhaps it's less of a hassle to stick with /var/www/.\nWhat do you think? Should you change the root directory? What are the pros and cons?\n\nA: Yes, I believe you should. We started doing that to understand Apache and it settings but it is now a sort of standard agreement we have when installing a new site for a client.\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup wise it is easier. We host about 100 sites and have our software in /u1/ and then directories to programs and data and also a www directory where the webserver software is. So a backup/restore of /u1/\"client_name\"/ is easy and there is nothing outside the directory for that instance. Besides that: the MySQL databases are stored in those individual directories too. \n\n*It is always better to change the default since security wise you make it a bit more difficult to guess. We also always change the www-data user and group to a more specific one.\n\nA: Honestly, I think it's entirely up to you. \nGoing with the default might give you less headaches down the road. Scenarios where changing it could be a bad thing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Emergency maintenance (by an outside contractor/sys admin/whoever) might be hampered by a non-default configuration.\n\n*Default backup configurations for web servers might have to be modified as well.\n\n\nBut then again, you can also gain a little bit more security (through obscurity) and organization, maybe by choosing a better naming convention (/site1, /site2, etc).\nThat being said, I don't think that it matters that much. You could always change the /var/www directory to be a symbolic link (to point wherever you want) anyways, without even modifying the configuration to begin with. \n", "Q: Warning message in disk utility After opening disk utility, I see an error message as follows on the 8.6G extended swap partition. \"Warning: The partition is misaligned by 1024 bytes.

Do you really have > 8GB of RAM? Windows needs big swap space, but Linux only needs a swapspace equal to your RAM chip memory, unless you are editing humungous files. \nAs to repartitioning to fix the problem, use gparted (and install it if you don't have it from Synaptic or Software Center) and resize the swap file, specifying Align To: Cylinder when you get to the Resize screen.\nThe only tricky thing about gparted is if you have multiple HDD/SSDs - look for the spin box at right, above the middle, which lets you select the drive to work on.

Will this take Ubuntu, or more specifically Ubuntu Studio?\n\nA: The formal requirements seem to meet what you have. However, you would not regret adding more memory to that machine, as \"It is highly recommended that you have 2GB or more memory though so that the system will perform much better.\" Your system will accept more memory, I checked.\nIf you are not able to add memory, then consider using 32-bit (i386) Xubuntu and picking apps from the Studio suite one at a time.\nThere's also an Ubuntu Forums section specifically for Studio.\n", "Q: How to request new driver for Intel 4th Generation?

But when I retried Ubuntu with this newer card, I had a display problem. So I switched back to Windows and waited, telling myself that it would get solved in a future update from the community.\nThis update finally came between 13.04 and 13.10. The open source drivers could finally make Ubuntu look like Ubuntu instead of a purple screen... But the open source drivers are very, very laggy. So much that I can't handle browsing any web page with Firefox. What feel snappy, surprisingly, are the cursor, the launcher and the dash. So I searched on the Web and found instructions about switching to fglrx and fglrx-updates. Man, you can't know how much this frustrated me. I had to reinstall Ubuntu at least 10 times just because of these graphics. I couldn't see any login screen. So I waited for another update.\nNow, one year later I can finally use fglrx and fglrx-updates. However, to my great surprise... it's even laggier than the open source driver!? \nI swear it has nothing to do with my graphics card being not fast enough. In Windows Vista, everything is snappy. In fact, my seven years-old laptop with integrated Intel graphics fares better.\nWhat should I do? For now, my only solution seems to stay with Windows...\n\nA: Up until a few weeks ago I had an HD5670 for my 13.10 install. I downloaded and installed the driver direct from AMD's website and had better performance than from any of the ones listed in Additional Drivers (in fact, AMD just released a driver update on 12/19/13).\n\nA: I have asked for help in the IRC channel, and a user (Pessimist) helped be generously to switch back to the open source graphics and to switch to the PPA : https://launchpad.net/~oibaf/+archive/graphics-drivers\nFor now it seems to be better now. Only thing left is to see how I can make scrolling in Firefox a tad smoother...\n", "Q: Notification When someone connects to my local network , ARP, Notification file I have a question concerning Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Desktop - notifications (same notification as Rhythmbox application when playing music back and forth), technically if I'm not mistaken it should be called \"freedesktop.Notifications.service\". I just want to add notifications when one of my devices such as; laptop, phone, tablet connect to my local network. My configuration is as follows:\nI have a wireless router. My router is connected directly to my desktop computer with a wire, I'm using LAN, the other devices connect through WI-FI.\nBy way of example, let's say : \nMy router's ip address : 192.168.1.1 & MAC address XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX\nMe - as server - 192.168.1.101 & MAC address YY:YY:YY:YY:YY:YY\nSmartphone - 192.168.1.102 & MAC address ZZ:ZZ:ZZ:ZZ:ZZ:ZZ\nLaptop - 192.168.1.103 & MAC address KK:KK:KK:KK:KK:KK\n\n\n*\n\n*What I want to do is simple; add those IP addresses along with their MAC addresses in the ARP and finally modify the notification file, whenever those devices connect to my local network I get notified. That's it.\n\n\nP.S : I said \"ARP\". However, I'm not sure if it is suitable, I'm just supposing it has something to do with ARP config file, and notification file. Any suggestion using terminal or other application will be acceptable.\nI will be much appreciated if someone can help me. \n\nA: You can send notifications by use of notify-send yourmessage but what you want to do is a bit strange. \nYour router is the one handling the connections, a connection to your network will not be logged or noticed by your computer unless the device actually connects / interacts to your computer. Of course you could be making a monitor by regularly scanning the network like:\nnmap -sn 192.168.1.*\n\nand then read you data from here (or arp, because now you can find them there). But basically the device for monitoring connections is your router, not your pc.\nIf your router supports it, you could parse the logging of the router to the syslog of your pc. Now you get an message in the syslog when a connection is made, which you can then send to your desktop environment if you want.\nBut to answer the question, add a script to your cron which will do a nmap -sn, pipe this to temp file and compare this with the previous situation by use of diff. Diff out means offline, diff in means online.\nA rough example (only handles first ip change per run):\n#!/bin/bash\n#\n#Script to monitor the network and put changes to notification\n#\n#Save previous scan\ncp scan.txt previousscan.txt\n#get numeric list of online hosts\nnmap -n -sn 192.168.178.* > scan.txt\n#collect the difference, only the lines with ip-numbers\nmessage=$(diff previousscan.txt scan.txt | grep 192)\n#get first char which indicates if the host came up or went away\niostring=\"${message:0:1}\"\n#get first ip-number from the list\ncomputer=\"${message:23:17}\"\n\n#show ip-number in notify if host came up\nif [ \"$iostring\" = \\> ]; then\n        notify-send \"$computer online\"\n        fi\n#show ip-number in notify if host went away\nif [ \"$iostring\" = \\< ]; then\n        notify-send \"$computer offline\"\n        fi\n\n", "Q: Configure Dns Server in ubuntu Server how to configure Dns in Ubuntu server , such as reverse lookup zone .\ni need  the steps so Ubuntu Dns server will act like windows dns server .\nCan anyone give me the instructions ?\n\nA: Yes.

The link above is for 13.10; I recommend it for you.\n13.10 is the most up to date version but will be supported for a short time (about 5 months left); this is just because newer versions will come up so they stop supporting 13.10 to support the new one (which will be 14.04). 12.04 is not the newest version but will be supported long (several years).\nput in mind that it's so easy to upgrade Ubuntu 13.10 to the next version later from the update manager; just a few clicks and you're there!

(the LXDE and the LXLE!)\nI've never heard about LXLE but I do use LXDE!! YOU CAN INSTALL LXDE AFTER YOU INSTALL THE REGULAR UBUNTU!! Actually LXDE is ubuntu but with lighter user interface and apps. After installing ubuntu you can install the LXDE interface from the \"ubuntu software center\" and then you can chose which interface you want on each startup! the regular \"unity\" interface or the LXDE! That way you have both!! : )\n\nA: I would suggest you to try Lubuntu. With 2 GB of RAM, Ubuntu will swap, hence slow down the system once a while. And if your processor is a P4, it would be slow; Unity is quite heavy.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/GetLubuntu\nAnother interesting alternative is Linux Mint. The XFCE version is lightweight and yet has a very good looking.\nhttp://www.linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=113\n\nA: Keep in mind the laptop in question is quite old and probably has a Pentium M chip. Some of these CPU's lack the PAE flag which prevents a simple install.

However you should attempt to find out why it is not running - it can be configured not to start via files in /etc/xdg/autostart or ~/.config/autostart but that should not be the case in a clean install.\n", "Q: How to Install Testdisk in Ubuntu 13.10 I am unable to install testdisk in Ubuntu 13.10 from Live Disk.\nI am using USB drive to run ubuntu 13.10.

My Windows booted normally.\nWhat do I need to configure to get my dual boot system working?\n\nA: Don't worry. This happened to me when I installed Ubuntu myself. the \"menu\" you're talking about is called a \"bootloader\". The \"windows boot loader\" does not detect anything but windows.

So do this:\nmkdir -p ~/mame/roms\n\nPersonally, instead of cluttering my top-level home dir and my small HOME partition with MAME and large ROMS, I usually choose to symlink it to my data partition ROMs folder:\nln -s /path/to/your/roms ~/mame/roms\n\nYou can also edit ~/.mame/mame.ini (note the leading dot, it's a hidden dir!) and set the location of all MAME-related data paths, or edit the global config /etc/mame/mame.ini for all users, including changing the default top level data path ~/mame or the settings path ~/.mame to other paths.\nAlso it's worth noting that you don't need all those packages to install MAME. sdlmame* was a dummy transitional package and was removed in recent Ubuntu releases, mame-tools is not needed to run games, and gnome-video-arcade is just a GUI (that you're not using, considering you're starting MAME in the terminal). So mame is the only package you really need.\nNote for previous Ubuntu releases:\nThe user paths for MAME-related dirs were changed in recent Ubuntu releases. For older releases such as 12.04, both settings and data (like ROMs) are inside the hidden ~/.mame\nAfter a lot of digging and researching, I've found out when and where such changes were made: the .ini location and default user paths are not an upstream setting, so it's not the MAME developers that set it, but rather configured by each distro.\nIt was changed in Debian, and later incorporated in Ubuntu, starting in MAME v0.146-5 and finished in v0.147-1. \nFrom the Debian Changelog:\n\nmame (0.146-5) unstable; urgency=low\n\n  [ Cesare Falco ]\n  * Replace -march with -mtune=generic gcc flag for compatibility issues\n    with older CPUs (LP: #1063993)\n\n  [ Emmanuel Kasper ]\n  * Add support for parallel building using DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS\n  * Reorganize default paths:\n       $HOME/.mame for ini file and output files\n       $HOME/mame for data search paths\n\n -- Emmanuel Kasper   Tue, 13 Nov 2012 22:54:27 +0100\n\nmame (0.146-4) unstable; urgency=low\n\nThe relevant commits for such changes were \n\n\n*\n\n*2012-10-26 - 9677867a63c6 - Switch local folder to ~/mame (from ~/.mame)\n\n*2012-11-14 - 824bc168084b - Edited config files; use personal non-hidden resources dirs.\n\nA: Mame is just the emulator - now you need to find ROMs for the games you would like to play and put them in ~/mame/roms (create the directory if it doesn't exist)\n\nA: From : http://www.upubuntu.com/2012/10/how-to-install-mame-multiple-arcade.html\n\n\n*MAME Configuration\n\n\nStart now MAME with this command so that a hidden folder (.mame) is created in your home directory which will contain all emulator settings:\nmame\nYou can now close the emulator.

In the downloads page, you can contribute to Ubuntu by donating money. I recall someone saying that this money goes to for-profit Canonical to do as they please, and not to the not-for-profit Ubuntu Foundation. Can anyone find a source for this assertion?\n\nA: From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Foundation\n\nThe Ubuntu Foundation is a purpose trust founded by Mark Shuttleworth and Canonical Ltd. to ensure the long-term maintenance of the Ubuntu Linux distribution independently of the  commercial activities of Canonical Ltd. Its initial funding commitment is $10M. Its current advisory board is made up of chairman Mark Shuttleworth, founder of Canonical Ltd., and representatives of the Ubuntu Community Council and the Ubuntu Technical Board.\nAlthough it was originally announced that the Ubuntu Foundation would employ core members of the Ubuntu community[2] as of 2008, the Foundation remains dormant. Mark Shuttleworth describes it as an \"emergency fund\" in the event that Canonical's involvement in the Ubuntu project ends.\n\nI think you'll need to contact Canonical's legal staff for a full answer of how the money is managed and allocated in relation to Ubuntu, and to ask for that clarification to be included on the donation page of the site as well. However, given the dormancy of Ubuntu Foundation, one can infer that the money is handled by Canonical and is allocated to activities pertinent to Ubuntu.\n", "Q: G++ compilation error \"cc1plus\" not found I think I accidentally deleted a couple files from my machine, and now G++ won't compile.\nI tried to apt-get remove it then apt-get install it to see if it would fix it, but it didn't work.

Just reinstalling the g++ package won't work, as it's a meta-package which simply depends on the versioned packages instead.\n\nA: In Ubuntu, the g++ package is a 'dependency package' that installs the default version of g++ for your OS version (e.g. g++-4.6 for 12.04) so reinstalling the g++ package may not re-install the files you deleted - you probably need to reinstall the underlying g++-N.m package.\nYou can find out what the actual default package is by executing apt-cache depends g++ or by following the g++ symlink using ls -l $(which g++).

I rebooted, and everything looked nice and I chose Kubuntu as my OS for the laptop.  Later, I tried to reboot to my Ubuntu Studio installation, but found that it was no longer the default boot OS.  I figured, I can just take out the other HDD and all will be fine.\nAll was not fine.  I had forgotten that I had removed the HDD (I was testing it the next day) and I panicked.  I scoured the forums and figured out what had happened.\nWhat I was unable to find, though, was an EXTREMELY EASY way to move the GRUB to the old disk.  \nI have gotten pretty good with some aspects of Ubuntu over the last year or so, but I haven't messed with the GRUB, it was just something that always worked and I didn't need to dig into.  So, as a consequence, I am unsure of what to do on this problem.  I looked at other instructions, but I need something really clear and simple that explains what to do and what the reason for doing those things is.\nA lot of tutorials fall short (in my eyes) when they don't explain why things are done.  They just say what to do, and it makes it harder to figure out what exactly is going wrong.\nI am running Ubuntu Studio as my main audio workstation.  As stated before, I was trying out Kubuntu on that computer.  When I rebooted, it had moved the GRUB to the Kubuntu HDD.  It is not a major problem, just a bit of an annoyance when I turn on the computer and I would like to be able to take this HDD out of the computer.  I was just using it to test Kubuntu and it is only 40GB (Tiny and un-nessecary compared to my main 1TB drive).\n\nA: \nWhat I was unable to find, though, was an EXTREMELY EASY way to move\n  the GRUB to the old disk.\n\nTo Copy GRUB from one HDD to another\nYes, this is extremely easy as one command in terminal. \nFirst (to be sure) list the HDDs with the following command \nsudo fdisk -l \n\nit will results something like.. \nDisk /dev/sda: 120.0 GB, 120034123776 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 14593 cylinders, total 234441648 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x0007329e\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1            2048    60289023    30143488   83  Linux\n/dev/sda2        60289024    71774207     5742592   83  Linux\n/dev/sda3        71774208   112734207    20480000   83  Linux\n\nDisk /dev/sdb: 320.1 GB, 320072933376 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 38913 cylinders, total 625142448 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x0001f627\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sdb1   *        2048    81922047    40960000   83  Linux\n/dev/sdb3        81924094   625141759   271608833    5  Extended\nPartition 3 does not start on physical sector boundary.\n/dev/sdb5        81926144   486234111   202153984   83  Linux\n/dev/sdb6       486236160   621045759    67404800   83  Linux\n/dev/sdb7       621047808   625141759     2046976   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\nas you can see in above example output, there are two disks. /dev/sda and /dev/sdb. If I have GRUB in /dev/sda and I want to copy it(install it) to /dev/sdb I would boot from the HDD where the grub is installed (/dev/sda) and I would give this single command \nsudo grub-install --recheck /dev/sdb \n\nAbove method will copy the GRUB from the OS where you booted to the second HDD. In case you remove the OS from the first disk, it is possible to have problems with GRUB. \nIf you want to avoid above (possible) problems, you can attach the second HDD then boot from the OS where grub is handled (usually the latest installed OS) and do\nsudo update-grub \n\nGRUB scripts will recognize the other Linux OSs (in second HDD) and you will be able to boot on one of them. You can do that and then install the GRUB of a Linux OS (you prefer, that relies on second HDD) in the second HDD. That way you will avoid any future problems in case you remove an OS from the first HDD. The command is the same. \nsudo grub-install --recheck /dev/sdb\n\n", "Q: how to uninstall fdupes from ubuntu I have installed fdupes.

Why is it there and how do I make this popup prompt go away for faster, more streamlined computing?\n\nA: Depending on settings of your external device Ubuntu may recognize it's purposed content (i.e. a digital camera will contain photos, an mp3-player will contain music, and an e-book reader will contain e-books).\nWe can define default applications to open the drive whenever the application chosen has  support of this.\nTo change these default application we can go to System Settings... to choose the Details cogwheel.\n\nIn the \"Removable Media\" section we will have predefined applications for the most common media types but there also is an Other Media... button for more types. Amongst these we also may find the type \"E-book reader\" from where we can define default actions on inserting it to our computer.\nIt is there where we can also define the application to open the media, or to choose \"Do nothing\" in case we don't want to be bothered.\n", "Q: How can ending process introduce security risk? I get this message when ending tasks in System Monitor:\n\nI understand ending processes will remove data in memory and break its current session, but how can ending a process create a security risk??\n\nA: It may introduce a risk if the process is not allowed to perform necessary clean-up.\nFor example, when a text file is edited, the new contents are often stored in /tmp, or even in the current directory, with an obscure filename. This file is simply renamed as the original file when the user saves to disk, or deleted when the user discards the edit.\nIf the process is not allowed to either rename or delete, there is a security risk if the original file, or the unsaved edits, contain sensitive information, like passwords.\nNow extend the analogy to web browsers and session cookies, and you have a formidable security risk.\nEdit: As pointed out below, properly coded programs will take due care to ensure that a forced termination does not become a security risk.\nHowever, not all programs are properly coded and the O_TMPFILE mechanism was added in Linux 3.11, so code written prior to the addition will not make use of it. That includes the current LTS, which is stuck on Linux 3.8.\nIt is best to assume that a program will cause a security risk if forcefully terminated, unless you have had the time to inspect the source yourself.\n\nA: It doesn't.

In other case it will read only the Sublime and this doesn’t exist.\nAnother way to avoid this issue, is to use Tab Completion. This is a feature that will help you to auto-fill weird names and/or long names. Read here about Tab Completion and learn it. It is very useful(in Ubuntu is pre-installed). \nA third way for names with spaces is the backslash \\ . Above command with quotes could be \ncd Sublime\\ Text\\ 2/\n\nthe backslash followed by a space explicitly denotes a space. \nA suggestion could be: Do not create folders in Linux with space in name. Prefer something like\nSublime-Text-2 or Sublime_Text_2\n\nA: If there are spaces in the name ,then just use a backslash('\\') and then the space(' ') ,for e.g\n \" os program \" so in this there are three spaces so use three backslashes,\nso the command will be\ncd \\ os\\ program\\ \n\nso for each space in the name use a backslash and then the space,\nanother example \"os  program\" ,have two continuous space ,so command is \ncd os\\ \\ program\n\n", "Q: Automatically add external display to screen in Ubuntu Server I'd like to be able to control my laptop's (Ubuntu Server 12.04) external display over SSH.

None have worked for me and I am reluctant to do something like reinstall kernels, when every kernel I have installed in a year has not worked.

In my case, the response is \"false\".\nIn your case, to revert to seeing the notifications again, now paste in the following:\ngsettings set org.gnome.nm-applet disable-vpn-notifications false\n\nAlternatively, you could just reset the value to the default by using:\ngsettings reset org.gnome.nm-applet disable-vpn-notifications\n\nYou may need to disable networking and renable it or log off and log in again or reboot for the changes to take effect.\n\nEdit: there is a GUI if you want to avoid using the terminal. It's called dconf editor and you can get it from the software center or by running:\nsudo apt-get install dconf-tools\n\nAgain, Mik's answer describes its usage but, at least in the past, there have been instances of confusion: an example is here: Are dconf schema names case-sensitive?.\n**Mik has asked for his account to be deleted according to this.\n", "Q: How to install an app written in Python?

It could be actually because the boot for Windows 7 is actually locate in Windows RE partition instead of the main C: drive. I wonder this may help, but you can try to use Live CD or Live USB to determine your Windows RE partition still exist, and you might want to disable the grub.\nTo my knowledge, Windows RE partition is hidden in Windows, but when I use Linux to detect the partition, it usually located in dev\\sdX3 or 4, (For Windows 8, the boot is somehow in a FAT32 partition), if grub is installed in sdX1 partition, your computer will read the grub and enters grub.\nHope this gives a wee bit information to help you further your quest of solving your answers.\n", "Q: How do I install Ubuntu on laptop with broken screen I have an old laptop with a broken screen so I can't see any text on the right 3/4 of the screen... just a small strip on the left from top to bottom is visible. \nI have the laptop connected to my LCD TV but nothing appears on it until the laptop boot gets to the windows logon screen.

I'm a complete noob to Ubuntu. My goal is to set up a media center using laptop/PS3/XBMC/TV.\n\nA: It is possible. I did this once with a laptop of a friend (he wanted to use his laptop which had a broken graphic card as a server, he has used it for a year as a minecraft, irc, plex, owncloud and subsonic server). The final way to install ubuntu was to remove the hard drive, insert the hard drive into another laptop, install ubuntu and then put the hard drive back again. Before you put the hdd back, you should install openssh-server. After you put the hdd back, you can control your laptop remotely (google for putty/xming if you're using windows or type ssh -X username@lan-ip-address in a terminal on a linux pc).\n\nA: I'm afraid that will be impossible. In OS installation (even Windows), it can only display using internal LCD, it is after the installation then you can configure your OS to use which display.

Having two computers (1 Desktop Ubuntu, 1 Laptop Windows 7). Is it possible to kill a process of a given running service on Windows 7 such as Skype, knowing that I have its local IP address along with its MAC address for the Windows 7?\n\nA: It probably is, though you would have to have the login information as well as having something like SSH or VNC installed on the two systems in coordination with the IP.\nFrom the Ubuntu Community Documentation here\n\nSSH (\"Secure SHell\") is a protocol for securely accessing one computer\n  from another.\n\nThe quickest way would be via SSH, as it is simply text, no GUI needed. You can do this via ssh user@host. However, if your username on Ubuntu is the same as your username on Windows, then you could simply run ssh hostname, it will automatically take your Ubuntu username and use it.\nYou would also need to install an SSH  server on your Windows PC, so you can log in. Read this page to help you set up OpenSSH (the same as on Ubuntu) on Windows 7.\nFrom the ssh on Windows 7 page: \n\nA quick Google search reveleaed the existence of the sshwindows\n  project which is a more lightweight solution than a full cygwin\n  installation.\n\nFrom the page about SSH on Ubuntu:\n\nTo use SSH, you will need to install an SSH client on the computer you\n  connect from, and an SSH server on the computer you connect to. The\n  most popular Linux SSH client and Linux SSH server are maintained by\n  the OpenSSH project.\nThe OpenSSH client is included in Ubuntu by default. For information\n  on connecting to an SSH server, see Connecting to an OpenSSH Server.\nTo install the OpenSSH server, install the following package:\n  openssh-server.\n\nWhile I'm not sure, once you are logged in I think you should just be able to run the usual Windows commands and terminate the processes.\n", "Q: Is it possible to programmatically log in a specific user on a specific virtual console?

Now, this is just another trick : it blocks terminal emulators, not terminals (subtle difference indeed).\nIn a UNIX environment, terminals are the primary interfaces to the system. Blocking them is very likely to disturb many applications, not only command-line ones. Blocking terminal emulators instead is nothing but a workaround. With good permissions, remember that nothing bad can happen to your machine from a user terminal : it takes root privileges to mess things up.\nNote : with xterm, this is said to cause problems with utmp.\n\nA: Especially if your \"targeted\" user has no sudo privileges, the solution below is pretty \"waterproof\". It can be used not only to block users from the terminal, but (any user) from using any application.\nWhat it is\nThe solution exists of a simple and very light-weight background script that you can use in a flexible way to block users from applications. \nThe script is started on start up from /etc/rc.local (see further below)\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\ndata = [\n    [\"jacob\", \"gedit\", \"thunderbird\", \"gnome-terminal\"],\n    [\"William\", \"gedit\"],\n    ]\n\ndef user_appcheck(userdata):\n    try:\n        user = userdata[0]; apps = userdata[1:]\n        applist = subprocess.check_output([\"ps\", \"-u\", user]).decode(\"utf-8\").splitlines()\n        matches = sum([[l.split()[-1] for l in applist if app in l] for app in apps], [])\n        for match in matches:\n            subprocess.Popen([\"pkill\", match])\n    except:\n        pass\n\nwhile True:\n    for userdata in data:\n        user_appcheck(userdata)\n    time.sleep(4)\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*copy the script below into an empty file, save it as users_apps.py in a location where \"normal\" users cannot edit the file.\n\n*In the head section of the script, set the user(s) and their blocked applications in the format:\n[\"<username>\", \"<application>\"],\n\nFor a single user, blocking gedit and gnome-terminal e.g.\n    data = [\n        [\"jacob\", \"gedit\", \"gnome-terminal\"],\n        ]\n\n\n\n*Add a line to /etc/rc.local:\n/bin/bash -c \"python3 /path/to/users_apps.py&\"\n\n\n*Test-run it by running /etc/rc.local \nNB test it with a non- essential application from your user account:\n/etc/rc.local\n\nIf you blocked yourself, you shouldn't be able to run the application; it might just open in a flash, but will close immediately.\nThere is not much to be done about it if a user does not have sudo permissions :)\n", "Q: New Dell 3437 preinstalled Ubuntu laptop not working I got a new Dell 3437 laptop, when ONed the laptop ubuntu started to install intself.

This means that the virtual machine runs with the user account it was created and started.\nTo access a running virtual machine from a different user account we have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run an SSH server on the guest to control the guest OS via SSH from a different account (or through the network).\n\n*Use the desktop remote viewing protocol (RDP) of Virtual Box to have access to the graphical desktop of the guest.\n\n\nSteps to run and access a guest via RDP\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the Oracle Extension Pack.\n\n*Enable RDP for the guest machine.\n\n\n*\n\n*Virtual Box Manager: Enable RDP in Settings > Display > Remote Display\n\n\n*Command line: \nVBoxManage modifyvm \"name_of_guest\" --vrde on\n\n\n\n*Start the guest OS from your main user account.\n\n*Switch to your other user.\n\n*Run a remote desktop viewer (e.g. Remmina which is installed by default).  \n\n\n*\n\n*Connect to localhost:3389 (or another port if defined differently in 2.)  \n\n*Use the name and password of the account from which Virtual Box is running.\n\n\n*Adjust display geometry or color settings according to your needs.\n\n\n\nThis way we can access and control a running virtual machine over the network from any remote computer too.\n", "Q: Host Server minecraft or samp Is it possible to run a Minecraft- or SA-MP-Server (GTA San Andreas Multiplayer) on Ubuntu.

Finally, run:\nsudo ./install.sh\n\nYou'll get an error, but the driver does seem to get installed. After a reboot, dmesg reported:\ninput: AlpsPS/2 ALPS GlidePoint as /devices/platform/i8042/serio1/input/input7\n\nand the touchpad on my Flex 14 worked as expected.\n\nA: I cannot comment yet but I can confirm that the above solution, using the psmouse-dkms-alpsv7 worked for my Lenovo Z510 BUT it was a pain to cleanup a lot of stuff I tried already. I can now control my mouse with the usual System Settings -> Hardware -> Mouse and Touchpad and all settings are working(e.g. natural scrolling, two finger scrolling)\nI'm using Linux Mint 16 and the script had to be modified, to delete /usr, see below line\nMDIR=\"/lib/modules/$(uname -r)\"\n\nI removed the gpointing-device-settings, the /etc/default/grub settings like\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"i8042.reset i8042.nomux i8042.nopnp i8042.noloop\"\n\nWhat I think it was important, I had a file under /etc/modprobe.d with this content\noptions psmouse proto=imps\n\nand this had to be removed too. Without this setting(recommended by other solutions) being removed the driver installation had no effect in my case.\nI had to install the xserver-xorg-input-synaptics Version: 1.7.1-0ubuntu1 is what I have\nand I can finally see this:\ncristi-Lenovo-IdeaPad-Z510 psmouse-dkms-alpsv7 # xinput \n⎡ Virtual core pointer                      id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ ALPS PS/2 Device                          id=12   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ AlpsPS/2 ALPS GlidePoint                  id=13   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎣ Virtual core keyboard                     id=3    [master keyboard (2)]\n    ↳ Virtual core XTEST keyboard               id=5    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                              id=6    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Video Bus                                 id=7    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Video Bus                                 id=8    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                              id=9    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Lenovo EasyCamera                         id=10   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ AT Translated Set 2 keyboard              id=11   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Ideapad extra buttons                     id=14   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n\nand synclient works, no more \"Couldn't find synaptics properties.

When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo apt-get install wicd-gtk\n\nOnce installed, run it to see connectivity, Access point connected to, properties, IP settings, and much more.\n\n\nA: In my case, i used below commands and the output was 1 if the wifi was enabled else 0. You can try and good luck. \nnmcli r wifi | grep enabled | grep -v not | wc -l\n\n\nA: iwlist scanning should do the job.\n\nA: One can use ip address or ip addr command instead of slightly old ifconfig. If you know the name of your interface device, you can use ip addr show <device name>.

I have a Panasonic Toughbook CF-19 MK3 that I recently installed Xubuntu 12.04 LTS on. That install went smoothly and works fine. Was looking for more customization, so decided to try KDE desktop. Used apt-get to install KDE 4.8.5. Everything was working fine after install until I rebooted; once I did that I had login issues (couldn't login, but was using KDE login manager - switched it back to XFCE login manager and that was solved).\nOnce I was able to login to a KDE session, I got this issue: as soon as I tough ANY key on the keyboard OR the touchpad, the screen goes black for a while. Eventually it comes back, but goes black upon key press/touchpad use. I tried editing the compositing line in the .kde/share/config/kwinrc file to Enabled=false, then rebooted, but that doesn't seem to do anything.\nI've spent about 2 hours searching for answers on the internet, but I have not been able to find a solution. Anyone have any ideas? I want to try KDE, but this is frustrating! I'm relatively new to Linux also, and I'm trying to use Linux exclusively now (no Windows!)\n\nA: I don't know if this answers your question, but if your end goal is to try KDE, why not install Kubuntu directly. That is, Ubuntu with the KDE desktop environment. Especially if you are a new user installing Kubuntu is easier than installing another distro with KDE on top.\nYou will find that Kubuntu 13.10 comes with KDE version 4.11.2, so you will get the best of the KDE experience!\n", "Q: Thunderbird: Delete Emails from Certain Address I have the Latest Thunderbird in 13.04 and certain addresses are spamming my mails.

Is there a tool I can use for that?\nDeleting them at startup is becoming a burden.

VIM is a really powerful text editor but it has loads of commands to let you quickly insert text and move around the document. However to type you must press i and then type and press ESC when done.\nYou can remove the -a to take it out of interactive mode so it just uses your original message. \n", "Q: How to mount without mkdir Very very basic conceptual question.

For example\n$ gvfs-mount -d /dev/sda1\nMounted /dev/sda1 at /media/28C68BC3C68B8FAC\n\nTo unmount, use the mountpoint and volume label\n$ gvfs-mount -u /media/28C68BC3C68B8FAC/\n\n\nA: The GUI does the mkdir in advance for you. It deletes it when it's done.\nYou don't need to mount to /media/name/, there is a special folder called /mnt in your hard drive.\n", "Q: Ubuntu-Lampp PHP path issue I use Ubuntu 13.10 and Lampp.\nWhen I try to run sudo php artisan job-daemon I get the above message.

If not (as is the case here), then check for it in the proposed repo (see how to search for proposed updates on ubuntu.com and BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia). Unfortunately it seems that 173.14.39 isn't packaged for Saucy even in proposed: \"nvidia-graphics-drivers-173\" package in Ubuntu.\n\n*If it were available in proposed, you'd have needed to enable it in Synaptic > Settings > Repos > Updates > Proposed and then install it. But since this is (currently) not an option, you can sudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia-173, then download the latest drivers (173.14.39) from Nvidia's website and install that. \n", "Q: Clearing OS Cache I'm guessing that's what it is.

Today I checked my system logs and I found a spam of this line:\n[ 11972.301] (WW) NVIDIA(GPU-0): Unable to read EDID for display device CRT-0\n\nIm on an acer aspire 5742G laptop with NVIDIA GeForce GT540M graphics card.\n\nA: That message means that your VGA-card couldn't get the EDID info from you CRT monitor (or it can be also an LCD connected with VGA-cable). The EDID tells the video card about the capabilities of the monitor (resolutions, frequencies, etc.) More info about EDID on wikipedia.\nYou can see the EDID info in linux if you run \nxrandr --verbose\n\nBecause you have a laptop you will likely see the EDID for your internal LCD screen Hopefully that one didn't fail.\nIt is likely that the faulty in this situation is not your nvidia card, but your CRT monitor. It is also possible that the CRT monitor doesn't have a serious problem, it just has a problem with sending the EDID. (It is also possible that if it is an LCD monitor connected with VGA cable, that it just simply don't send its EDID info through VGA, and it has absolutely no problems)  You can use your card and CRT monitor without the EDID info, the only problem in this case that you will have to manually set up the available resolutions, frequencies, etc. (If you set something what is not suitable for your monitor, then it can damage your monitor.)\n", "Q: Bumblebee's optirun command was working fine, then suddenly it does nothing anymore I installed Bumblebee today on my Dell laptop (i3 2370 + GF630M) to play Doom, using Doomsday. I tested the \"optirun\" command with firefox, then with doomsday and all was working fine. Now however, when I type \"optirun doomsday\" or \"optirun firefox\" in the terminal, literally nothing happens. No error message, the process just hangs for eternity, unless I terminate it. Any ideas?\n\nA: I had a similar issue, due to Linux headers not working properly. A previous answer on askubuntu suggested (also the info on the bumblebee homepage) to install:\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\nsudo apt-get purge bbswitch-dkms bumblebee-nvidia\n\nThat installs the PPA-Purge utility and removes BBSwitch and Bumblebee. Then\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic\n\ninstalls the proper Linux headers. In my case, however, I had to use:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) && sudo dkms autoinstall && sudo restart bumblebeed\n\nSince it seems the \"generic headers\" weren't enough in my case. Finally\nsudo apt-get install bbswitch-dkms bumblebee-nvidia\n\nBut, if you are using Ubuntu 13.10 there might be a further issue, as explained by this post:\n\nIn Ubuntu 13.10 (Saucy Salamander), it seems that the libturbojpeg .so\n  filename has changed from libturbojpeg.so to libturbojpeg.so.0 and\n  this breaks Bumblebee.\n\nThe way to fix it (for 32bit) is to run the following:\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libturbojpeg.so.0 /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libturbojpeg.so\n\nSee the post itself for the 64 bit version\nI hope this solves your issue, let me know how you get on.\n", "Q: Execute sh script from *.desktop file?

Say I have a firewall setup on my linux server with iptables so that I only accept port 22 and port 80 traffic and I block access to all other ports.\nDo these rules only work if the client machine is using a IPv4 address? So if an ipv6 address is used, the client can access ports I don't want them to? (ie ports other than port 22 and port 80)\n\nA: As others already have told you, there are different firewall tables for IPv4 and IPv6.\nYou could set up rules for IPv6 like for IPv4, but there are a great risk you'll mess it up if you don't know IPv6. Like, you can't drop ICMP for IPv6, as there are essential handshake parts there. Like telling the sender that the frames are to large, etc. Without those things, IPv6 could stop working for some users.\nSo it would strongly recommend the use of ufw or the package shorewall6 together with shorewall.\nThe iptables frontend ufw supports both IPv4 and IPv6 and works great on servers with one or two interfaces and now also do support simple routing (work as a router or gateway).\nIt also support applications and comments, so please use them to make it simpler to go back and look at what you have done.\nBut if you route traffic, you probably need something better, like shorewall before manually add some rules for forwarding with iptables and ip6tables.\nDon't forget that you can have more than one IPv6 addresses on your interfaces. Some are only link local, some are globally static and dynamic. So you should set up rules accordingly and the servers only listening on the right addresses.\nAnd again, using iptable directly is like coding in assembler.  It is fun, but if you don't know all relevant RFC:s, you should not do that, use some front end.\n\nA: iptables works for IPv4, but not IPv6.  ip6tables is the equivalent IPv6 firewall, and is installed with iptables.\nUltimately, though, iptables is for IPv4 connections, ip6tables is for IPv6 connections.  If you want your iptables rules to also apply to IPv6, you have to add them to ip6tables as well.\n\nIf you try and replicate your iptables ruleset in ip6tables, not all the rules that iptables can do will port over neatly to ip6tables, but most of them will.\nRefer to the manpage for ip6tables if you want to make sure the commands that you use in your iptables will neatly port over.\n\nIf you'd like, we can help you create equivalent ip6tables rulesets to match your iptables rules, if you provide your firewall rules list (removing any information that could identify the system of coruse).  Otherwise, we can only answer your general question.\n\nA: In 2021 you can create a file with rules that is used for both IPv4 and IPv6, and use the prefix -4 and -6 for rules that work differently with both protocols:\n## Custom rules\n## Based on https://gist.github.com/jirutka/3742890\n*filter\n#\n# Base policy\n:INPUT DROP [0:0]\n:FORWARD DROP [0:0]\n:OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]\n#\n# Don't attempt to firewall internal traffic on the loopback device.\n-A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT\n-A INPUT -s localhost -j ACCEPT\n#\n# Continue connections that are already established or related to an established\n# connection.\n-4 -A INPUT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\n-6 -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\n#\n# and so on ...\n\nOptionally, you can store that as a file, such as /etc/iptables/rules.combined and create symbol links for the rules.v4 and rules.v6:\ncd /etc/iptables\nsudo ln -s rules.combined rules.v4\nsudo ln -s rules.combined rules.v6\n\n", "Q: Window controls missing; Cannot maximise or minimize applications - make fix permanent I have the issue discussed here: Window controls missing; Cannot maximise or minimize applications - .\nI have this problem for one of the users on my Ubuntu 12.04 install (installed 1.5 years ago).

The directories and files are still there, but VirtualBox does not see them.\nHave I messed up my host OS by installing guest additions on it?\nIs there a way to get back my virtual machines?\n\nA: No harm done. The package virtualbox-guest-additions  of the repositories will only install the CD-ROM .iso file in /usr/share/virtualbox/VBoxGuestAdditions.iso.\nWhat may have happened however is that as a dependency you also had installed the OSE edition of Virtual Box from the repositories.

I am looking at partitioning a new hard drive and I am not sure on how to go about it.\nThe drive that I am installing Linux on is 1 TB and I would like to separately partition for my / and /home. I have googled a bit and seen suggestions for the /tmp, /usr, and /var directories to be on separate partitions and would appreciate any information on the benefits and ballpark figures on the sizes required. I know that the swap needs to be a primary and to have its own partition too.\nI am hoping to eventually install three different Linux distros on the one hard drive and access my home directory and personal files from all three without any trouble. I know that they would all have to be on primary partitions. I am not sure how applications install and if they would need to be installed on each OS, or if they could accessible from all three.\n\nA: If Linux and not Windows, I might suggest gpt partitioning. Ubuntu installs to gpt and can boot with BIOS or UEFI. But Windows only boots from gpt partitioned drive with UEFI.\nBut with gpt partitioning you do not have any issues of primary or logical partitions.\nMost desktop installs do not need separate partitions for all the various system folders. Some with SSDs may want them on rotating drive or temp files just mounted in memory.\nDo not use separate /boot. Do not share /home, but create a separate /mnt/data partition. The only issue may be with different installs whether UID will be the same.\nIf BIOS with MBR partition, no Linux partitions have to be primary, Windows requires Primary partitions to boot. Best to use one or two primary, and then make entire rest of drive as one large extended partition for an unlimited number of logical partitions.\nFor the Total space you want for Ubuntu:\nUbuntu's standard install is just / (root) & swap, but it is better to add another partition for /home if allocating over 30GB.:\nOnly if gpt -  all partitions in gpt are primary:\ngpt: 300 MB efi FAT32 w/boot flag (for UEFI boot or future use for UEFI, you only can have one per drive, so if already existing do not attempt another)\n\ngpt: 1 MB No Format w/bios_grub flag (for BIOS boot not required for UEFI)\n\nfor gpt(GUID) or MBR(msdos) partitioning\nUbuntu partitions - smaller root only where hard drive space is limited.\nIf total space less than about 30GB just use / not separate /home or standard install.\n1. 10-25 GB Mountpoint / primary or logical beginning ext4\n2. all but 2 GB Mountpoint /home or /mnt/data  logical beginning ext4\n3. 2 GB Mountpoint swap logical\n4. If desired leave space for added / (root) of 20GB each\n\nDepending on how much memory you have you may not absolutely need swap but having some is still recommended. I do not hibernate (boots fast enough for me) but if hibernating then you need swap equal to RAM in GiB not GB. And if dual booting with windows a shared NTFS partition is also recommended. But you usually cannot create that as part of the install, just leave some space. Or partition in advance (recommended).\nOne advantage of partitioning in advance is that the installer will use the swap space to speed up the install.

I can use the tablet in place of my mouse and I can set the buttons and scroll wheel to do what I want.\nMy problem comes when I open Manga Studios 5, and it is a very strange problem. When I use my normal mouse everything in MS5 works normally, I can draw (without pressure sensitivity) but I checked most of the features and WINE seems to have handled the installation well. Everything seems to work fine with the mouse. The tablet, at first seems to also work in MS5, I can use it to select a pen or pencil change colors and open a new page to draw on. However the Pen does not work in the Canvas area of the page. When I move my pen such that the cursor would enter the Canvas area, the cursor simply disappears. If I make it all the way to the other side of the Canvas area, to the far right side where the screen space is used by more menus, my cursor reappears and works normally. If I try to draw in an area with the cursor while using the pen nothing happens, I can switch to the mouse and draw on the canvas but for some reason the Pen and Tablet seem to only work on the menu portions of the application.\nSadly I am a very new Ubuntu users and I can't provide more information than this. Honestly unless someone else has had this exact same problem I doubt anyone will have a solution but here is hoping. \nIn the mean time I am trying to get CS6 up an running to test the tablet in a different application that is also pressure sensitive. I used the Gnome paint tool and my tablet worked fine, but it was not pressure sensitive and I suspect the problem might have something to do with the pen and tablet not working when they are supposed to display pressure sensitivity. \nEDIT: In case anyone ever has this problem, there seems to be an option under File Preferences in Manga Studios 5 Checking the box for C ordinate mode or Tablet control area both seem to make the pen work on the Canvas with pressure sensitivity. So far I am experiencing some glitchyness with the pen, the cursor seems to skip around a lot but I can't actually tell if this is effecting my ability to draw with it or not, I will play with these settings to see if it gets better. In any case if anyone ever has this problem, then the solution might be to change these settings in Manga studio. \n\nA: Yes, in Manga Studio EX 5, under File/Preferences (Ctrl+K), find \"Tablet\" on the left side and click it, then click \"Tablet PC\" instead of \"Wintab\" or whatever else it says for your setup. This worked for me. Thanks Ashton for the updated info.\n\nA: I found doing it on windows that sometimes the windows choose the Wintab instead of the tablet PC and that has been known to be faulty so \nTry do the following \nPress Ctrl+k\nChanges it from the Wintab to Tablet PC.\nIn my case it unstuck the pen.\n\nA: Changing undo to some other hotkey helps a little. I figured that as soon I use the ctrl, as for undo, the cursor starts to flicker and acting weird. The behaviour turns to normal when I Alt-Tab to another application and back. \n\nA: I actually tried doing the ctrl+k thing and when I hit TabletPC, it worked but  the pen line wasn't smooth anymore and it didn't detect my pen pressure (a definite NO for my professional manga that I am attempting).  So, instead, I tried something random that fixed everything for me.  I left it on WinTab, but I checked the box just beneath it \"Use mouse mode in setting of tablet driver(Z)\" and then it fixed everything perfectly including the no pen issue, jagged line issue, and the pressure issue.\nSo I would say hit ctrl+k but check the box beneath wintab instead of hitting TabletPC\n", "Q: Ubuntu server and Java I'm trying to host a Runescape private server on one of my old dell machines and i'm just about to install java now...Should i install JRE or JDK and in what directory should I install them to?

If yes, which typical user would in her right mind send an Apport report to Ubuntu?\n\nA: Two already answered questions-answers combined, can solve your query. \nFirst : Should I include logs that contain \"sensitive information\"?\nSecond: Why did Apport make my bug report private?\nIf you want to examine the files by your self (in /var/crash) you can do it as well.

When I transfer the folder, the process starts. Initially, the speeds are high. 40 MB takes less few minutes (load average around 3), from around 40 - 60, 70 MB, it used to take another 3-4 minutes (load average around 6). From this point, the speed drops to literally few KB/sec if not less. The load average shoots to double digit. The system stops responding. Repeated numerous times. No success. This also happened if I tried to download any big file from internet as well. Poured over google and tried every possible solution out there.

I forgot my live CD was 64 bit and the hardware doesnot support 64 bit. The installation aborted. \nI made a 32 bit live CD and installed everything including LXDE and Office. Everything was and is super fast now. NO PROBLEMS at all. The load average is between 1 and 2. \nIs this at least a partial solution for painful USB transfer?? MAY BE...in my case it worked. \n\nA: This totally sounds like a disk/filesystem issue, especially since the problem could be seen when doing large file operations (downloading from usb/internet), and since it went away when you nuked the entire disk and reformatted.\nPeople here could probably give you a better answer if you gave more info about your disk setup when you had the dual boot config.\n", "Q: Is there a tool or trick to help with quoting madness? When doing server maintenance, I often find myself writing multi-level nested commands, so as:\nfor server in A B C; do sh -c \"ssh $server 'mysql db -e \\\"select where line like \\\\\\\"%abc%\\\\\\\"\\\"'&\"; done\n\nThis may be a contrived example, but it's really the kind of thing I have to do sometimes for some odd, ad-hoc task.\nThe problem is the quotes. As you go to deeper levels, you have to start escaping the quotes, escaping dollar signs, and escaping the escaping. Using single quotes helps avoid one level, but that's it.\nI began working on a solution for myself, inspired by the qq() function in perl, but I thought I'd ask around first: is there a tool, method or framework that will make it easier to write these nested commands without getting bogged down with backslashes?\n\nA: You can avoid most layers of quoting by passing the mysql commands via stdin instead of via argv:\nfor server in A B C; do\n    ssh \"$server\" 'mysql db' <<< \"select * from foo where line like '%abc%';\" &\ndone\nwait\n\nFor a more generic answer, see http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/096\n\nA: Try this:\necho \"ssh $server 'mysql db....'\" | sh\n\nIt decreases the nesting level, and also makes it much easier for you because you can just run the echo command until you get the exact command you want run after all escaping.\n", "Q: How to remove symbolic link I was trying to create this symbolic link:\nsudo ln -s /usr/share/phpmyadmin /var/www/phpmyadmin\n\nbut I accidentally typed:\nsudo ln -s /usr/share/php,yad,in /var/www/phpmyadmin\n\nSo now I want to correct it but it says symbolic link already exist. \n\nA: You can use the following to remove the symbolic link\nsudo rm /usr/share/php,yad,in\n\nExplanation\n\n*\n\n*rm is the terminal command to remove a file. See rm --help for more options that it can take.\n\n*sudo is used because the symbolic link was created with sudo.

These would be replaced and should be replaced when you upgrade. The files you want to keep are any personal - sensitive - or important - data. All these personal files rely in you /home directory. During the upgrade procedure they will not be deleted. Only if you specify this option (delete everything). But a backup is always a good practice in case that something goes wrong. \nYou can read here on how you can create a second partition (shrink the big one you have now with gparted) and create another one and use it as a backup partition.

I Want to make the emacs minibuffer (where we type emacs command) vertical.\nJust the way we open a window by using \nC-x 3\n\nIs there a way to do this?\n\nA: \nNormally, each frame has its own minibuffer window at the bottom, which is used whenever that frame is selected. If the frame has a minibuffer, you can get it with minibuffer-window.\n\nWell, apparently there's a way. Creating a dedicated minibuffer frame using the oneonone. This method didn't work how I was expecting on Emacs 24 where I tried as the 1on1-emacs. You need to load hexrgb.el first, otherwise it will not work. This is how it's shown:\n\nAs can be seen, it opens a new frame for completions, and for the minibuffer. I haven't figured out why when I switch to the minibuffer it doesn't change the scope to the minibuffer frame and instead tries to reuse the one that I have below. Maybe I'm not using the correct libraries but at least is the start.\nThen I used instead a new minibuffer window. The usability of the new minibuffer window was rather null, since I had two minibuffers (and haven't found a way to remove the original) and the auto-completition was done in the main frame instead of the minibuffer frame.\nThis is the farest I went:\n(setq default-minibuffer-frame\n      (make-frame\n       '((name . \"minibuffer\")\n         (width . 20)\n         (height . 80)\n         (minibuffer . only)\n         (top . 0)\n         (right . 0)\n         )))\n(setq-default mode-line-format nil)\n\n\nA: As the Commentary in file oneonone.el says, just put this in your ~/.emacs:\n (require 'oneonone)\n (1on1-emacs)\n\nYou can also invoke 1on1-emacs from the command line:\n runemacs -l \"oneonone.el\" -f \"1on1-emacs\"\n\n(You might need to provide an absolute file name for runemacs or oneonone.el, depending on your directory etc.)\nIf you call 1on1-emacs any other way than during startup, it will be too late, as Emacs will have already created another minibuffer in its initial frame.  That's the behavior you describe above. \nTip: If you use a 3rd-party library, it never hurts to look in the source-code Commentary for installation/startup instructions.  ;-)\n\nTo respond to the original question: if you want a minibuffer that is to the side of some other buffer, then no, it is not possible in the same frame, AFAIK.  But yes, you can use a standalone minibuffer for that, i.e., a separate minibuffer frame.  And yes, oneonone.el lets you do that --- just customize the position and size of the minibuffer frame using the options in the library.\nThat said, I do not see why anyone would want a minibuffer on the side.  Keep in mind that text is written horizontally.  So it generally makes sense to have a window/frame that is used for typed input and displayed output message (echo area) to be wider than it is tall, not tall and narrow.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 get stucked on boot (ubuntu logo + mouse cursor) After running the latest update on my Thinkpad running Ubuntu 12.04 i got the kernel 3.5.0-44-generic.

The adb ppp command to switch back to the USB cable instead of tcp/ip says it needs the tty as a parameter.\nI have googled for this and found lots of references to solutions that don't work.

It works pretty well with dropbox and Google Drive.\n\nA: No. Unfortunately it is not. As you probably have seen, Ubuntu One is not listed in supported protocols in the external-storage dropdown menu in your Owncloud environment. \nIn fact, the protocol that is used for U1 is not a standard protocol (but Google Drive and Dropbox are not standard either). It is developed by Canonical. It is called ubuntuone-storageprotocol. API's to interface with Ubuntu One are however available so there is nothing stopping the owncloud devs to start supporting this.

I don't have any trouble playing, but I would like to make use of the MIDI function. There are 2 MIDI ports, midi-in and midi-out.\nI bought a midi-usb interface and tried to connect it to my laptop but I can't seem to find how it works. What I would like to do is for example to write sheet music in MuseScore with my keyboard.\nHere is a screenshot of QJackCtl: image\nHow can I make it work?\n\nA: You will need to load some software. Use synaptic.\n\n\n*\n\n*Be sure aconnect is installed.  This enables the midi to pc connection.\n\n*Edit [jack and qjackctl. these are basic.].  If you install rosegarden from synaptic, jack will auto-install.  Be sure to enable the real time processing during install. \n\n*patchage. This is an extremely useful tool to establish/verify the connections. \n\n*rosegarden.  This provides the sequencer and music notater all in one pkg.\n\n*qsynth.  This provides the means to hear your midi files and play with the output.\n\n*linux-lowlatency. Critical. You must install this kernel, else rosegarden will not work.\nAfter all the above are installed, you need to check rosegarden setup to ensure it loads the soundfont and passes to your sound card. If no soundfont, you get no sound from your sound card.  The sound font should be in /usr/share/sounds/sf2  (I use fluidR3_gm.sf2) and it should come with qsynth.  \nFor more information, read this link:\nStep-by-step to run a midi keyboard input device? 12.04\nGood luck!\n\nA: Ok, I finally got it, the trick was swapping the IN and OUT plugs. Also, LMMS did a great job. Rub grune answer is worth looking into though, and especially this link I found in the post he refers to: http://rafalcieslak.wordpress.com/2012/08/29/usb-midi-controllers-and-making-music-with-ubuntu/\n\nA: I would suggest you to try setting the input Midi device to \"24:USB2.0-MIDI\" and the output device to \"129:MuseScore\". I'm not a frequent Ubuntu user so I've never had to face that kind of problem but this should normally work!\n", "Q: Default resource cap on root user I happened to see that on my Ubuntu 12.04 some resources of the root user is capped. I have not capped anything explicitly and my limits.conf as far as root user is concerned is empty. Here is the output of the ulimit -a on the root user\ncore file size          (blocks, -c) 0\ndata seg size           (kbytes, -d) unlimited\nscheduling priority             (-e) 0\nfile size               (blocks, -f) unlimited\npending signals                 (-i) 95931\nmax locked memory       (kbytes, -l) 64\nmax memory size         (kbytes, -m) unlimited\nopen files                      (-n) 1024\npipe size            (512 bytes, -p) 8\nPOSIX message queues     (bytes, -q) 819200\nreal-time priority              (-r) 0\nstack size              (kbytes, -s) 8192\ncpu time               (seconds, -t) unlimited\nmax user processes              (-u) 95931\nvirtual memory          (kbytes, -v) unlimited\nfile locks                      (-x) unlimited\n\nSo I believe it is a default capping. So my question is what is the reason behind capping these resources of the root user by default? Now when I try to set the file limit to unlimited as root user by using the below command , I get an operation not permitted error.\nulimit -H -n unlimited\n\nWhat prevents me from setting the limit to infinity and how safe it is to set it to infinity?\n\nA: Those default limits are hardcoded into the kernel source. Those limits are set for the init process by the kernel and other processes inherit it from init. See here.\nWhy you get an error when trying to set the number of open files to unlimited is likely because the system-wide setting is not unlimited, check it withcat /proc/sys/fs/file-max. See here:\n\nfile-max & file-nr:\nThe value in file-max denotes the maximum number of file-\n  handles that the Linux kernel will allocate. When you get lots\n  of error messages about running out of file handles, you might\n  want to increase this limit.\n\nYou can change that system-wide limit if you run e.g. echo 300000 > /proc/sys/fs/file-max as root, or with sysctl -w fs.file-max=300000 as root. To make those changes permanent add a line similar to the following\nfs.file-max=300000\n\nto the /etc/sysctl.conf file, e.g by running echo \"fs.file-max=300000\" >> /etc/sysctl.conf as root.\n", "Q: How to enable OpenSSL for PHP Cli?

I tried running the command, software-center devede, but ratings or submitting ratings is not available.  I have software-center version 5.2.9 running on Ubuntu 12.04 on two different machines\nMy issue with DeVeDe is that it changes the imported movie size without updating the disk usage in the main window.  Disk usage seems to indicate the input files, not the files to be written.  Adding a video file to a title automatically changes the output size of the input even if you select don't do that.  You must manually change the output video and audio frequencies to match the input in order to not change them.  Selecting optimize to fit disk on the main window errors out.  Very frustrating to spend 3 hours creating a 9GB iso image when the DVD will only hold 4.7GB with no indication that this is what DeVeDe is doing.  Takes a long time and numerous tries to find these types of problems.  (Many Evenings).  Which is why I think the current rating of 4.3 is wrong and I'ld like to submit mine...\nNow if I could figure out why the titles are invisible on the bluray player, and why the iso file will not play in VLC, I'll have a decent way to move my old 8mm tapes to dvd.\nIf we can not input ratings then I wouldn't trust them as I don't know where they came from.\n\nA: First of all, you shouldn't use ratings as a means for reporting bugs. You should report a bug on Launchpad, instead. \nTo answer the question of how to submit ratings for an app in Software Center, you simply need to go to that app in Software Center, and submit a review, and you must have the app installed, in order to submit a review. A log in window will pop up to log in to Ubuntu One, if you are not already logged in.\n", "Q: SSH Stopped working I restarted my computer, and now I can't connect to it through ssh on my remote machine.

Then i went to the drive and opened wubi.exe, and i clicked on install.\nThe window showed that edubuntu-13.10-dvd-i386.iso was downloading. Why is it downloading again?\n\nA: I'm confused. Are you trying to use WUBI on your pen drive, or on the HDD of your computer?\nIf the former, why? and if the latter then WUBI needs an iso file to install from, not a bootable pen drive.\nYou need to download the iso file and place it in the same directory as WUBI.exe. Then when you run WUBI it will find the iso file and install from that.\n", "Q: Plex media server and mount issues in Ubuntu 13.04 hopefully it's not too much of a newbie question......\nso, i have decided to drop plex media server onto an Ubuntu install in order to provide my house with a stable platform that will maximize availability. I had considered setting up an old WinXP machine to do this, but figured that i would get the most out of older hardware on Ubuntu, and that it would make full use of all the RAM as it's a 64bit OS instead of 32bit.\nthat being said, I'm having some issues. My machine is currently an older: \n\n\n*\n\n*13.04 64bit.\n\n*AMD2.7 dual core w/ \n\n*8GB RAM\n\n\nmy Linux knowledge is pedestrian at best, but I do have some command line experience.  my question is thus......\nI have finally moved all my media over from a Windows 7 MCE machine that we were using, but was slowing down tremendously.  apparently Plex does not support sub folders and I had to redo my directory structure again, as I want to separate my video files into kid friendly categories (same with my music files). Because of this, i used gparted to create several different logical volumes that will be mounted independently from one another, and allow me to create different repositories within Plex, that our kids now they can access.\nI know that the naming convention of the media (movies, tv progs, music, etc) must be adjusted so that Plex can find them.  however, I have done some reading and have found that this is probably not the only issue that I may be having. I have read other threads that indicate that the permissions on the volumes need to be 777 in order to allow Plex to access them, or Plex needs to be added to my default usergroup. This is not a concern, as I am probably going to be the only one accessing anything on the server, and i am comfortable with chmod -R enough to have fixed that. Additionally though, I read that the volumes are mounted with a default /media mountpoint and that this is the real underlying problem.  I read that the mountpoint needs to be changed to /mnt. In order to do this, it would appear as though I need to edit /etc/fstab in order to change the mountpoints.  I found this guide: MoveMountpointHowto - Community Ubuntu Documentation \nMy question is after moving all my files into my directories and having them mount at /media, should I back the files out in order to change the mount point? Or perhaps a better way to phrase it, will my data still be in the partition after I change the mountpoint or will it be lost?  another set of questions, is this even necessary?  is there an easier way to change the mountpoint?  while i am somewhat ok w/ using the command line, i would prefer a GUI option as my Linux-fu is far outdated. Alas, i have been unable to find anything that is reliable and all the posts i have read is that editing the /etc/fstab is \"easy\".  i'm afraid that the \"how to\" article referenced above is something that I'm not 100% comfortable with, although it appears to be very well written.\nthank you in advance for any input/feedback/assistance!\n\nA: well the safest option is to always backup, secondly XBMC does a much better job at managing things like this, consider XBMC as an alternative\n\nA: Having backups is always a good idea, but changing the mount points should not put you data at risk. How you create the mount points through editing fstab will depend on what type of partitions you created with gptd - NTFS, EXT, etc. Before you begin editing your fstab entries, simply make a backup of the current file with sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.backup.\nFrom what I know about Plex, it creates the user plex to run processes under and plex will need explicit permissions to the media directories. Partitions mounted through fstab will mount as root. You might be able to bypass this by having your media files stored in a top-level directory (say, \"Media1\" on the first partition) on each partition and assigning permissions to that folder and the enclosing folders with sudo chown -R plex /media/mountpoint/Media1. Otherwise, you will have to use uid, gid and umask values in the fstab entries for the partitions to get them to mount with the desired user plex with read/write privileges. I found this article to be somewhat helpful in explaining fstab entries and setting umask bits.\n", "Q: PlayOnLinux cannot find Wine (though it is installed with POL) Really strange, i use PlayOnLinux (POL) to install Wine 1.7.9, i rebooted my PC and when i try to open POL it says it can't find Wine, although it's listed under installed Wine versions.

Programs like LibreOffice and PDF readers sometimes need to open a file (say, the user downloaded and opened a file from Firefox) as read-only. When that is the case, and the user wants to save the file for later, the user has the option to Save As... or Save a copy. Why is Save a copy included if Save As... would do the exact same thing?\n\nA: \"Save as\" saves the current file as a given filename. That may or may not be the first copy of the file. And in most applications, this path becomes the active file in the application.\n\"Save copy as\" (et al) tend to create another file (which may or may not be the same as above) but won't change the active file (if it exists) and you'll still be editing the original copy.\nTL;DR: \"Save as\" will change the current open document; \"Save a copy\", won't.\n\nA: There should be three options (though not in all programs):\n\"Save\" - This will save the document without asking for a new name or location. It will over-write the original.\n\"Save As\" - This will prompt you to save the document using a dialog box. You will have the ability to change the file name and/or location. If you choose the same file name and location it will over-write the original. Your working document will be the one you just saved.\n\"Save A Copy\" - This will prompt you to save a 'copy' using the same dialog box as 'save as'. You will have the ability to change the file name and/or location. If you choose the same file name and location it will over-write the original. If you changed the name or location of the document you will be working on the original document not the copy. This means that if you make additional changes and then hit save the original will be overwritten with the new changes, but the copy you saved earlier will be left at the state of the \"Save A Copy\".\n", "Q: What are the top video and audio converting software available for Linux?

Will Ubuntu touch have a firefox browser anytime soon? (Seems like the default is webkit at the moment.) Does web apps as first class citizen imply that a web app based OS will be easy to port to ubuntu touch? It's apparently really easy to install these apps in OSX, which is why I'm asking.\n\nA: FirefoxOS apps per se will not work on Ubuntu as the APIs are different. However, as wilf so kindly pointed out above, IF the app is CSS or Javascript it might work.  \n\nWill Ubuntu Touch have a Firefox browser anytime soon?\n\nThat's up to Firefox: Send them a tweet at @MozPDX and ask. \n\nA: The html version of my app IqFitFun has almost identical code base on Firefox Os, Ubuntu Touch/Ubuntu Desktop, IOS, Tizen, Windows8, Chrome OS, Facebook and Amazon WebApp. For Android I have a native implementation and for Windows Phone 8 the html version needs extra native code to integrate Web control.

(Not ClamAV) I know that maybe it sounds like a duplicate but it isn't because I see that the other questions describe totally different situations than mine. Apart from the other users, I don't have a Windows partition on my netbook (yes, I am a newbie but I had the courage to \"forget\" about Windows) and I don't have any CD-RW drive on it. So I don't need to scan my Windows partition from Ubuntu neither I can use any Antivirus CD like some people recommend.\nMy problem is, I hope, simpler. I use a lot of flash drives to store data, and I have used it since my \"Windows times\". But now I have become unaware of the possible viruses that can be \"stored\" on it. Yesterday I have plugged in several of my flash drives on a freshly installed Windows XP system with an up-to-date Avast! Antivirus on it, and the antivisrus has discovered a dizzying number of viruses on my flash drives! While this doesn't affect me, it may affect others, because all of my friends are Windows users and they always call me to help them solve PC-related problems. So, I can't go to them and, unwillingly, \"flood\" their systems with viruses instead of helping them. \nSo I really need to keep my flash drives clean just in case. \nNote.\n\n\n*\n\n*I don't think that using a Windows system to scan them is a good solution, although it might sound to be the easiest and most obvious. My mother's PC runs Windows XP but is an old PC, tricky and unreliable because it falls all the time.\n\n*ClamAV is not an option for me as I have a very bad experience related to it. I have used it in the spring to scan a Windows partition (on a dual boot PC) and the result was a total mess and I had to reinstall both operational systems again. Since that day, I simply hate ClamAV as I am convinced that it erases even good and clean files and all it does is just a mess.\nSo, if you have a a solution apart of those two and keeping in mind my lack of CD drive, then your advice would be very much appreciated. \n\nA: Suggest installing BitDefender for Linux which offers a free personal use license.\n\nA: If it is just the flash drives you want to wipe of the viruses, just copy the files (the ones you know which don't contain viruses) off them, and use GParted to wipe them.\nMaking sure that it is the memory stick you are wiping, unmount it, and delete the partitions:\n\nThen go to Device, and Create Partition Table.... Set to make a msdos table, and click Apply.\nYou can then create a new FAT32 partition, so that it will work with both Windows and Linux.\n\nAll this should effectively remove all date from the memory sticks, making sure there are no viruses.\nHope this helps \n\nA: You could install an antivirus product on Ubuntu such as Comodo Antivirus For Linux (Free) or the previously mentioned ClamAV (Free), or you could install wine and setup an antivirus product inside of it such as Symantec Endpoint Protection (not free) or Comodo Internet Security (Free), just make sure to disable any kind of auto-scan capability (if possible don't install it to begin with). You will of course have to enable access from wine to the usb stick via wines virtual letter drives.\nHow to install wine:\nHow to install and configure Wine?\nHow to install Comodo Antivirus For Linux:\nhttp://postbin.djun.net/pages/article11.php\n\nA: Based upon my logical inference, I have  reached to a conclusion (I might be wrong) that since (in her own words) she only sees what she put on those drives, IMHO, i don't think her system/Linux is any how infected. You see, these Trojans, viruses, Malwares etc. programmed for windows environment are generally of .exe format. As soon as you put them inside a foreign environment like Ubuntu , they can't get executed by themselves and remain in a docile state. There is also very less probability (rather no way if you ask me) that they can remain hidden by default in any Unix based system. (They are programmed/written such way to remain hidden in Windows, so that they can propagate further), but can't stay same in Unix. So, as she mentions, all of her friends are Windows users I guess as soon as she plugs in the drive in their system, these, Trojans/viruses etc. already present in their systems, infects her pen drive as well. (Its relatively easy to guess as the probability of a Windows system getting infected is much more higher than a Unix System). Also, relatively, the chances of getting a pen drive infected by any *Nix system for Windows Os are pretty low. There is no way a *Nix System can infect a pen drive in such a way that as soon as you plug your drive in Windows Xp and scan it with anti-virus, it recognizes virus or malware. That is not linux behavior.  Linux is not designed that way, Security is at its very core. So, what I would rather suggest is that IMHO, your Linux environment is 100 % safe, its when you hop your pen drives from 1 system to other (of your friends) where it gets infected. I wont say don't do it, but my solution will be to rather going to stupid OS and Stupid anti virus, insert USB in Linux(Ubuntu) environment , Let it auto-mount, delete all those files which you haven't put or recognize. Lo and behold, I can guarantee you try scanning that pen-drive/media in that Anti Virus of yours. Bingo ! Virus Free.

Sys‐\n   tem  administrators,  diagnosticians  and trouble-shooters will find it\n   invaluable for solving problems with programs for which the  source  is\n   not  readily available since they do not need to be recompiled in order\n   to trace them.  Students, hackers and the overly-curious will find that\n   a  great  deal  can  be  learned about a system and its system calls by\n   tracing even ordinary programs.  And programmers will find  that  since\n   system  calls  and  signals  are  events that happen at the user/kernel\n   interface, a close examination of this boundary is very useful for  bug\n   isolation, sanity checking and attempting to capture race conditions.\n\n\nFor the actual implementation details, you will ultimately have to rely on the source code.

I believe the BIOS listing should be UEFI/Legacy Boot and changing that to Legacy Only will solve the other possible source of your problem.\nIt's also a general good idea to specify which version (e.g., Ubuntu with Unity, Ubuntu GNOME, Kubuntu, Xubuntu or Lubuntu) of Ubuntu you are trying to install.\n\nA: Trying to install Ubuntu from a USB disk on a Windows 7 system led to a lot of errors. I found that, in addition to disabling Windows active security protection during the time I was using uNetBootin but also that my flash drive was too big (64gb).\nFor me the issue was that I was using exFAT which is a proprietary filesystem.

In my suggestion you need : \n1) shell-script file \"bash programming\". \n2) for-loop counter, as you said \"to see how many files have been processed\" . \n3) notification every X time (seconds / minutes / hours), here you need \"libnotify bin\". \n4) keep the script running.\nNow let's make the script create a file \"counter.sh\"\n#!/bin/bash\nfor f in $( ls /usr/lib ); #just change the path with yours, it was just an example\ndo \nnotify-send -u critical \"How many files\" $f\ndone\nsleep (1000*60) # get notification every 1 hour\ncounter.sh\nsleep (1000*60) # get notification every 1 hour\n#you can make infinite for loop here \n#and put counter.sh inside it, \n#just look that up on the internet (infinite loop using shell script)\n\n\nFinally, to make your file running you can just run it in the terminal and let it running.

Optimus watches the resource load of the computer and automatically switches between the discrete GPU and the integrated low power one on the MB. The problem is that Optimus only supported on Windows. This why you get so many more hours of use on Windows - the majority of your computer time is probably spent using the onboard GPU and not the 555M. In Ubuntu, it's seeing the card and installing it (probably using the Nouveau based open source Nvidia drivers) so your low power on board card is being bypassed. There is a project called Bumblebee that is working on adding Optimus support to Ubuntu, with power management issues being a primary goal of the project.

I see Backporting mentioned below.\nhttps://access.redhat.com/site/security/updates/backporting/\nI'm not sure what they mean by \"module\". For the example scenario mentioned in the link, it sounds that, in ubuntu, if users only use packages managed by apt, there is no need to backport packages in the sense that RedHat means. Is it so? Thanks.\n\nA: It's not really about apt, but packages in the Main repository do get backported security fixes throughout the life-cycle of an Ubuntu release. So if you stick to this software, then you won't have to do anything special except install updates as they become available. \nThe only two exceptions I'm aware of, is Firefox and Thunderbird, which instead of getting backported fixes, are instead upgraded to a newer version. \nIn other words; the document you refer to, pretty accurately describes what happens in Ubuntu. \n\nA: There are two backporting in Ubuntu repositories: security backports and normal backports.\nSecurity backports are enabled and installed by default each day. They are provided through the codename-security repository. This are the same as RH backports that you were reading. Others backports are enabled but not installed unless you ask specifically for them, a behaviour that was taken from Debian instead.\nThe use or not of apt has nothing to do with this fact rather than apt is the one installing them.\n\nI'm not sure what they mean by \"module\".\n\nThis is apache modular system. You can attach modules to change, improve or expand the functionality of apache.\n\nFor the example scenario mentioned in the link, it sounds that, in ubuntu, if users only use packages managed by apt, there is no need to backport packages in the sense that RedHat means. Is it so?\n\nI explained what it the common points of backports between RH and Ubuntu. So in this specific case, it means that since they aren't altering the functionality of apache, just hardening or closing a security hole. Modules depends of the functionality of apache, and business might not like to update their stuff.\n", "Q: How to preseed installing grub to a device during installation without prompt?

How can I configure an IRC server that is backed by LDAP?\nRight now, I'm looking at making an IRC server that is backed by an OpenLDAP or 389 instance for user authentication.\nWhich IRCD should I be using?\nPreferably, it should be able to look up the users LDAP groups and decide if they can be opped, voiced, or even allowed to join a channel at all.\n\nA: You Question Needs a lot of explanation , so i will summarize my answer :\nFirst you should use Inspircd v2.0.15 because its stable , high performance and the most important for your usage , flagged as ldap support Link.\nFirst :\nYou should edit your /etc/hosts file :\nYouserverIp       hostname.example.com        hostname\n\nSecond :\nInstall OpenLdap :\nsudo apt-get install slapd ldap-utils\n\nduring installation just type your ldap administrator password .\nOpenLdapServer\nThird :\nInstall apache2 : apt-get install apache2\nFourth :\nInstall phpldapAdmin : phpLDAPadmin (also known as PLA) is a web-based LDAP client. It provides easy, anywhere-accessible, multi-language administration for your LDAP server.\nsudo apt-get install phpldapadmin ( that's why i installed apache2 , its web tool) \nYou have now two steps :\nedit\n /etc/ldap/ldap.conf\n\nadd : edit \nBASE dc=yourdomain,dc=com\nURI ldap://Your Ip Address\n\nthen : edit /etc/phpldapadmin/config.php\n\n\n\nJust edit your Ip and domain name .\nOpen your browser :\nyourIp/phpldapadmin\nEnter your administrator password that you type when install sldap .\nNow you connect to ldap database . select domain ----> on the right add Generic Posix Group ----> then select group and Create a child Entry add Generic User Accounts for testing .\n\nMore help use phpldapadmin Here\nFifth :\nNow its time to configure inspircd :\nedit : /etc/inspircd/inspircd.conf  you need to load the ldapauth module and point to your ldap server,\n<module name=\"m_ldapauth.so\">\n<ldapauth baserdn=\"cn=test,dc=domain,dc=com\"\n          attribute=\"uid\"\n          server=\"ldap://yourIp or domainname\"\n          allowpattern=\"Guest*\"\n          killreason=\"Access denied\"\n          searchscope=\"subtree\"\n          binddn=\"\"\n          bindauth=\"\"\n          verbose=\"yes\"\n          userfield=\"yes\" >\n\nYou should also add you irc server name and admin name and other option in \n/etc/inspircd/inspircd.conf \n\nThis tutorial would help you : Tutorial\nLast :\nRestart slapd , inspircd and try to connect be users you made .\nNote change as it fits your needs , this configuration both irc and ldap are the same servers .\nHope it helps you because i don't think there is an official documentation could be simple as mine .\n\nA: If you really want that the IRCd does the authentication, I would suggest InspIRCd.\nIt has a ldapauth module, but you need to compile it yourself with \n./configure --enable-extras=m_ldap.cpp\nmake\nmake install\n\nAn example configuration how LDAP is used is in an example configuration file.\nNote that this module is experimental. And the configuration file (and the source code) is all the documentation you get for that module.\nEdit: After reading a bit of the code, I'll try to explain how that works:\n\n\n*\n\n*It first binds to the ldap server with the credentials you specified in the configuration.\n\n*It searches for a user where the attribute that you specified in the configuration is equal to the nick of the connecting user.\n\n*It tries to authenticate the found dn with the password that the user supplied on connect (via PASS, can be configured in the server configuration on most clients).\n\n\nIf any step fails, the user is disconnected from the network/server. I hope that is what you need (unauthenticated users can't connect).\nFor the configuration, there is a concept of databases. LDAP is used here like a database. You first define the database (LDAP server, credentials for the LDAP server...), and use it later for one or more purposes, e.g. user authentication, oper authentication...\nOr put it simple: The default values are either obviously wrong or good defaults.\nEdit: What you want falls in the domain of IRC services. Although InspIRCd could provide basic services, you need to write own code to make it work as you want.\n\nA: You haven't specify which IRCd to use and actually asked for it.\nSo; here is an example for LDAP configuation to InspIRCd.\nFor a complete list of IRCds; you may have a look to this Comparison of Internet Relay Chat daemons in which all -except two, supports Linux.\nand finally in this Table; you can find which does actually supports LDAP Authentication.\nWish that helps you in your decision .\n", "Q: Making external drive accessible from Ubuntu I wish to connect my WD 2TB drive to a Humax HD-foxT2 to play files created on Ubuntu. If I format the drive FAT32 no problems, except the restrictions of file size of FAT32 is a problem, and the Humax apparently uses Ext3 format. \nSo I formatted the drive in Ext3 using Ubuntu, but Humax doesn't recognize it now.  \nSo I reformatted the drive using the Humax Ext3.  The Humax device now recognizes it but Ubuntu says I do not have permission to write to it then.  \n\nA: Aha! You have it formatted (check) in a format the Humax can read (check) and now need to be able to write to it. Well, then, mount the drive in Ubuntu then from a terminal window on your Ubuntu box, please run \n\nsudo chmod -R 646 /path/to/mountpoint\n\nwhere /path/to/mountpoint is the path to the drive, such as /dev/sdb \nIf you are uncertain as to its name, run \n\nsudo lshw -C disk\n\n", "Q: Why doesn't `exec startx` work in 13.10? I am used to being able to launch a second X session in TTY8 with exec startx but instead I'm getting an error:\nX: user not authorized to run the X server, aborting.\n\nAnd then in TTY 8 I end up with a stuck cursor and no login at all. Just the blinking cursor in the very top left. How to I kick up a second x server so that I can log in as another user there? \nUpdate\nWith help in the comments, I've gotten somewhat farther. From the terminal in an existing xsession, I can do exec sudo startx to get a new x session in TTY8, logged in as that user. If I hop to TTY4, log in and do exec startx I can get a session, too. \nHere's what still isn't working: the session I get is a a working x session but without any launcher, top bar or  Unity window management. So ctrlaltt gives me a terminal and I can launch applications from there, but I can't switch between them and if I minimize a window there's no way to get it back. \n\nA: Ok I think I have a solution for you, try this command\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure x11-common\n\nIt should be on console users only by default, try to put it on Anybody.\n\nA: Not a complete answer, though it lets you run startx as root.\nsudo does not execute in a shell. It just looks in the $PATH. That is why the exec is not found. You should try \nexec sudo startx\n\nAlso, to start Unity you can just try and run the export DISPLAY=:0; unity command in a Terminal.\n\nAlso, just guessing though you can try these commands:\nsudo startx\nexport DISPLAY=:0\nunity\n\n", "Q: WSJT software on 12.04 verses version 10 Dear Support Ubuntu support community:\nI recently upgraded my pc from Ubuntu version 10.04 to 12.

I recently installed Ubuntu 13.10 on an SSD drive using the \"encrypt the new Ubuntu installation for security\" option. I wanted to enable TRIM, so was following the guide provided here.\nOne step says to add the discard option to /etc/crypttab. However, the crypttab man page somewhat vaguely states: \n\nWARNING: Assess the specific security risks carefully before enabling\n  this option. For example, allowing discards on encrypted devices may\n  lead to the leak of information about the ciphertext device\n  (filesystem type, used space etc.) if the discarded blocks can be\n  located easily on the device later.\n\nWhat exactly are the security risks of enabling TRIM on an encrypted SSD partion/drive?\n\nA: The warning just want to say, that if you enable the discard option, the firmware of your SSD will zero out the unused blocks on your drive. And these zeroed blocks can be easily identified and analyzed for a pattern. \nObviously the zeroed blocks will show the attacker the unused space and because of that he will know what is the used space. So if he want to crack the encryption he will have to deal with a smaller encrypted data, because he won't care about the unused blocks. And from the pattern of the unused blocks the attacker may be able to guess the filesystem type and the filesystem parameters, which may help him in cracking the encryption.\nI'm not a cryptographer nor a cryptoanalyst but these informations are likely just a minimal help for the attacker. I think the warning is just there because in cryptology every minimal leaked information about the encrypted data can lead to the break of the encryption. So the authors of this encrypting software wanted to inform you that you have better security without enabling that feature, but how much better is not really known, because we can't know how much these leaked information help the attacker in breaking of the encryption. Obviously if the authors thought that the enabling of this feature would lead to a bigger than minimal risk for the encryption then this feature wouldn't be present in the software.\nIf you want to know more about this topic I advise you to read this article from Milan Broz and the comments on that page which also contain some good links. From that good article I paste here his conclusions:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*If there is a strong requirement that information about unused sectors must not be available to attacker, TRIM must be always disabled.\n  \n*TRIM must not be used if there is a hidden device on the disk.\n  (In this case TRIM would either erase the hidden data or reveal its position.)\n  \n*If TRIM is enabled and executed later (even only once by setting option and calling fstrim), this operation is irreversible.\n  Discarded sectors are still detectable even if TRIM is disabled again.\n  \n*In specific cases (depends on data patterns) some information could leak from the ciphertext device.\n  (In example above you can recognize filesystem type for example.)\n  \n*Encrypted disk cannot support functions which rely on returning zeroes of discarded sectors (even if underlying device announces such capability).\n  \n*Recovery of erased data on SSDs (especially using TRIM) requires completely new ways and tools.\n  Using standard recovery tools is usually not successful. \n  \n\n\nA: The key here is the phrase\n\nif the discarded blocks can be located easily on the device later.\n\nSo, make sure /tmp /var and other directories used by encryption are really in memory which will be cleared when they system shuts down. That minimizes risk.\nI found a good explanation here.\n", "Q: New Laptop stopped booting after a good week So far I always could solve my problems by reading through questions already asked but this time I can't find any prescedental case, so here we go:\nI got a new laptop for christmas, immediately installed Ubuntu 13.10 and changed the windowmanager to i3. No dual boot, nothing fancy, just Ubuntu and i3. Today it suddenly stopped booting after working just fine for about a week. It gets to the Ubuntu-loading screen and the loading-animation works, but I waited for severeal minutes and nothing happens.\nI checked the boot-options, they are fine. Aside from that I know neither what to test nor what could be the problem. Any ideas?\nEdit: I totally forgot the option to try booting into recovery mode. Didn't solve the problem, but now I know, that the last thing it tries to do is\nresume: libgcrypt version 1.5.0\n\nThat's where the screen freezes for about two or three minutes. Then it says:\nresume: Could not stat hte resume device file '/dev/dm-0'\n        Please type in the full path name to try again or press ENTER to boot the system:\n\nIt reacts to nothing after that.\n\nA: Did some further searches and found the solution. Apparently uswsusp sometimes causes this problem when /home is encrypted. The solution was to boot into a live-system, mount /home as root and uninstall uswsusp. A step-by-step solution can be found here:\n\nAfter installing a fresh Ubuntu 13.04 I noticed the laptop would no\n  longer hibernate when the lid was closed.\nI installed the hibernate package (apt-get install hibernate) and\n  then ran sudo hibernate\nThis resulted in a laptop that would not boot. initramfs issue that\n  could not be circumvented through recovery mode:\nresume: libcrypt version: \nresume: could not stat the resume device file /dev/dm-0\nPlease type in the full path name to try again or press ENTER to boot the system:\n\nPressing enter does nothing, the only keystroke that works is\n  ctrl+alt+del\nSo after some googling this is what I tried:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Boot into ubuntu live cd/usb – the same one I used to install ubuntu earlier today\n  \n*Mount my system and chroot into it:\nmkdir /mnt/temp/\nmount /dev/sda1 /mnt/temp/\ncp /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/temp/etc/resolv.conf\nchroot /mnt/temp/\nmount /proc\n#optional commands: not sure what caused the issue\napt-get purge uswsusp\napt-get purge hibernate\ndpkg-reconfigure initramfs-tools\n\n  \n*Reboot the live cd and see if that works.\n  \n\nIf needed, replace /dev/sda1 with the partition with Ubuntu's root filesystem inside it.\n", "Q: Comic book project using all open source apps I wanted to know if it is ok to display the Ubuntu logo in my new comic book. I used Ubuntu, Gimp, and Inkscape and wanted to promote them in my project.\n\nA: \"Ubuntu\" has trademark protections and the logo has trademark and copyright. Ubuntu has a fairly loose trademark policy which does explicitly allow most things for non-commercial use as long as you're not hinting that Canonical or Ubuntu are endorsing you, and that you follow their logo guidelines.\nIf you want explicit permission (and I think it would be silly not to), talk to Canonical. At the very least they should be able to give you a written confirmation of what I'm saying.\nMost big projects will have trademarks on their logo and name for software use. Use of them is usually okay in a non-commercial, non-endorsement role but again, it costs nothing but a few minutes to check.\n", "Q: crontab entry to reboot than email I got my weekly crontab reboot entry to work using /sbin/shutdown -r but now I want it to email me when the reboot happens.

But no other line should be inside this file. \nIf other lines exist, edit the file and remove them all except from the LANG string. \nIf the file does not even exist then, create it and add the LANG string only. \nIn any case use an editor with root privileges. \ngksudo gedit /etc/default/locale \n\nafter you edit and save, \nreconfigure some things. \nsudo dpkg-reconfigure locales \nsudo update-locale \n\nlogout/login or reboot. \nAbout the dhcp server, read this answer. Some configuration files must exist.

I was wondering how I might get these commands to run automatically when I log in. I am running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. Thanks for any help! \n\nA: Rather than running the commands on login, it would usually be better practice to configure the kernel modules at boot time via files in the /etc/modprobe.d directory.\nThe names of the files are arbitrary (although they should have a .conf suffix) but it is a good idea to make them relate to the module in an obvious way e.g.\n\n\n*\n\n*create a file /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-iwldvm.conf containing the line\nblacklist iwldvm\n\n\n*create a file /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf containing the line\noptions iwlwifi bt_coex_active=0\n\nThe iwlwifi.conf file may exist already (if you have configured other options previously) - if so just append the new option rather than creating a new file. The changes will take effect when you reboot.\n", "Q: Wiped out OSX (Mac Air), to install Ubuntu 13.10 which doesn't boot What are my options? I tried to do a OSX recovery, but now the macbook air can't pick up my  wireless (but wireless is definitely working). At this point, I'd be happy with either Ubuntu, OSX, or any Linux distro working.\n\nA: I think the issue that you're running into has to do with UEFI. Perhaps simply waiting 30 seconds will reveal grub. In short Macbooks use this as a replacement for the traditional BIOS. Take a moment to look through the Mactel support teams installation instructions and be sure to follow the steps.\nI usually keep a small partition that still has OSX installed for firmware updates as well as checking things out if I suspect a hardware problem. I also have a base image with OSX only should I want to bring the machine in to the Mac store for repair. I highly recommend considering a dual boot system.\nOnce you've looked over the general install instructions take a look at your hardware specific page. I made some assumptions about your version of hardware in this link but you can navigate the wiki should you have a difference version.\n\nA: This is due to Ubuntu installation not writing the NVRAM correctly after installation.  A simple fix is described at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBookPro11-1/Saucy Step 5.  You need to boot into a live mode through a USB drive to do this.

And yet my computer keeps trying to initialize a network connect through my phone whenever I plug it to the USB port. Is there another program that udev is launching?\n\nA: While there may be a way to do this with udev, I found a much simpler working solution at this AskUbuntu question.\nTo summarize, you can tell Network Manager not to manage certain devices by adding a line to its .conf file.\nFirst, find your cell phone's mac address. Run dmesg from the terminal after you plug it in; one of the print outs should have the mac. The line for me was:\n[ 4691.112016] cdc_ether 3-1:1.3 usb0: register 'cdc_ether' at usb-0000:00:14.0-1, CDC Ethernet Device, de:1a:28:c7:db:e6\n\nNext, open /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf with super user privledges, and add a your phone's mac as an unmanaged device. This is my NetworkManager.conf; I added the last two lines.\n[main]\nplugins=ifupdown,keyfile\ndns=dnsmasq\n\n[ifupdown]\nmanaged=false\n\n[keyfile]\nunmanaged-devices=mac:de:1a:28:c7:db:e6\n\n\nA: Modem Manager can be configured to use different filter policies, and the udev tags such as ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE have no effect under the strict filter policy.\nYou can determine which policy Modem Manager is using on your system by viewing its status:\n> sudo systemctl status ModemManager\n● ModemManager.service - Modem Manager\n   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/ModemManager.service...\n   Active: active (running) since ...\n   ...\n   CGroup: /system.slice/ModemManager.service\n           └─644 /usr/sbin/ModemManager --filter-policy=strict\n\nThis also shows that the relevant service file is /lib/systemd/system/ModemManager.service. We can edit this file in different ways to disable probing of a particular device.\nTo use a different policy which will refer to the udev blacklist rules we can change the command in the service: \nExecStart=/usr/sbin/ModemManager --filter-policy=default\n\nOptions are default (just use the blacklist rules) or paranoid (like strict but also use the blacklist rules). The documentation mentions this is not recommended as support for blacklist rules may be obsoleted in the future.\nAnother option is to filter a class of devices using one of several TTY-specific environment variables. This can be achieved by appending a line to the [Service] section of the service file. For example, to prohibit probing of ACM TTY devices:\n[Service]\n...\nEnvironment=\"MM_FILTER_RULE_TTY_ACM_INTERFACE=0\"\n\nAfter changing the service file, reload the systemctl configuration and restart ModemManager:\nsudo systemctl daemon-reload\nsudo systemctl restart ModemManager\n\n\nFor debugging purposes it may be useful to watch modem manager logs when connecting your device. To enable debug logging, run:\nsudo mmcli -G DEBUG;\n\nTo watch the filter log messages, run:\njournalctl -f | grep \"ModemManager.*\\[filter\\]\"\n\nNow when you connect your device you should see lines like:\n# Device allowed with strict filter policy\n[filter] (tty/...): port allowed:... \n\n# Device filtered with default filter policy and udev tags\n[filter] (tty/...): port filtered: device is blacklisted\n\n# Device filtered with strict filter policy and environment variables\n[filter] (tty/...) port filtered: forbidden\n\nTo return ModemManager logging to its prior state, run:\nsudo mmcli -G ERR\n\n\nA: This is solution help me for ModemManager 1.10.0  (Ubuntu 18.04)\nModemManager -V \nYou can learn more: Common udev tags \nCreate a file /etc/udev/rules.d/49-stm32.rules and add this:\n# 0483:5740 - STM32 in USB Serial Mode (CN5)\nATTRS{idVendor}==\"0483\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"5740\", ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE}=\"1\"\nATTRS{idVendor}==\"0483\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"5740\", ENV{ID_MM_TTY_BLACKLIST}=\"1\"\nATTRS{idVendor}==\"0483\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"5740\", ENV{MTP_NO_PROBE}=\"1\"\nATTRS{idVendor}==\"0483\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"5740\", ENV{ID_MM_PORT_IGNORE}=\"1\"\nATTRS{idVendor}==\"0483\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"5740\", ENV{ID_MM_TTY_MANUAL_SCAN_ONLY}=\"1\"\n\nAfter save file and run:\nsudo udevadm control --reload-rules \nand (maybe it's not necessary):\nsudo systemctl restart ModemManager.service \nAfter reconnecting the USB device (physically pull  out and pull in it into the USB port) and enjoy.\n\nA: (just for sake of science, since you have already solved your issue...)\nudev reads/executes its rules in the alphabetical order[1].\nThis could mean that your settings should be overwritten be NetworkManager, that's your rule is useless.\nIf you rename your rule from 99- to 99999- does this change help you?\n\n[1] https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/204979/why-do-the-rules-in-udev-rules-d-have-numbers-in-front-of-them\n", "Q: How to upgrade glade 3.8 to glade 3.13 higher My glade 3.8 \nMy Ubuntu 12.04\nHow ? \nI'm newbier \nI'm try  but not working\nPlease ,help me !\n\nA: First remove glade with apt-get:\nsudo apt-get remove glade\n\nDownload the last version of glade here.\nExtract it somewhere, then just read the INSTALL file.\n\nA: Actually as you said you are using Ubuntu 12.04 , I guess its using GTK+2 which is version 3.8 and latest.

For some reason we terminate the installation of package via apt-get by pressing ctrl+z,it creates a lock file inside /var/lib/dpkg/ and /var/cache/apt/archives/ directories.\nAnd after that if we want to install another or same package via apt-get,we have to manually remove the lock by running these two commands sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock and sudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/lock so that the installation will occurs.\nMy question: Is there any way to remove the lock files automatically that was created after pressing ctrl+z,so that we don't need to remove the lock files manually.\n\nA: No,\nBecause it is not possible for a program to catch SIGSTOP (sent by Ctrl+Z)\nTo quote the relevant parts of signal(7):\n\nSignal     Value     Action   Comment\n───────────────────────────────────────────\nSIGSTOP   17,19,23    Stop    Stop process\n\nThe signals SIGKILL and SIGSTOP cannot be caught, blocked, or ignored.\n\nTherefore, if you stop a progam with Ctrl+Z and close the terminal, it has no chance to perform cleanup (e.g.: removing lock files).\nCtrl+Z should not be used if you intend to cancel an operation, only use it if you intend to pause a program and resume it (or close it cleanly) later.\nThus, Ctrl+C should be used to terminate processes because a program can catch that signal and exit cleanly.\nAlthough, in the case of apt-get, pressing Ctrl+C will leave the lock files behind, but terminate the process. This means that the lock files can be removed, but the package manager could be left in an inconsistent state, if you terminated it at a critical point.\nThere is really no safe option to terminate apt-get cleanly while it is installing/updating packages, but cancelling (Ctrl-C, then remove lock files) while it's downloading should be fine.\n\nA: Never delete the lock manually.(Why?)\nThe best way is to resume the process and not delete the lock. The lock created ensures no other instance of apt runs at the same time.\nCtrl+Z suspends a process. To bring it back to the foreground and continue execution, type\nfg\n\nThis will allow apt to continue what it was doing and finish the process. To stop execution of apt, you need to kill it using Ctrl+C. This will remove the lock as well.\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*Difference between Ctrl+C and Ctrl+Z\n\n*What happens to suspended jobs\n", "Q: How to make .bin file from multiple c source code Hi please let me know how to compile Sony TV source code using Ubuntu 13.10 for making .bin file(system software).\n\nA: The source code shown is  not a full distribution.\nI suspect you could compile everything there by downloading it, extracting and and using make (there are readmes too) but the things that hold it all together are missing, likely because they're still stock code (ask Sony - they're still obliged to make any unmodified GPL2+ code available) or they're custom written. I suspect whatever is bootloading this is custom made to some degree.\nThe process of completing the distribution and actually building it into a bin is not something you can \"just do\". Sony has the secret sauce. You can ask them about the build environment but I'd start by getting the complete source (for everything open source) and see where you stand.\nFailing that, talk to the FSF about Sony being non-compliant. Just understand that there are likely parts that Sony has no obligation to share.\n\nI could also be completely wrong.

The password is generated from a master password and the account name, so as long as you share the master password you can both generate the same password for an account. The program supports multiple master passwords, so you can have one you use for your personal passwords, and others that you share with your various partners. Underlying encryption is provided by gpg and it seems very secure. It also seems quite flexible.

I searched & some sites are providing free antivirus for Ubuntu and Linux. When does it needs anti-virus? \n\nA: You don't need antivirus fir linux\n\nFew Linux Viruses Exist in the Wild\n\nThe core reason you don’t need an antivirus on Linux is that very little Linux malware exists in the wild. Malware for Windows is extremely common. Shady advertisements push nasty software that is practically malware, file-sharing sites are full of infected programs, and malicious individuals target security vulnerabilities to install Windows malware without your permission. With this in mind, using an antivirus program on Windows is an important layer of protection.\nHowever, you are very unlikely to stumble on – and be infected by – a Linux virus in the same way you would be infected by a piece of malware on Windows.\nWhatever the reason, Linux malware isn’t all over the Internet like Windows malware is. Using an antivirus is completely unnecessary for desktop Linux users.\n\nWhy Linux is Safer Than Windows\n\nHere are a few reasons why Windows struggles with a malware problem, while few pieces of malware target Linux:\nPackage Managers and Software Repositories: When you want to install a new program on your Windows desktop, you head to Google and search for the program. When you want to install most programs on Linux, you open your package manager and download it from your Linux distribution’s software repositories. These repositories contain trusted software that has been vetted by your Linux distribution – users aren’t in the habit of downloading and running arbitrary software.\nOther Security Features: Microsoft has been doing a lot of work to fix serious security problems with Windows. Until UAC was introduced with Windows Vista, Windows users almost always used the Administrator account all the time. Linux users normally used limited user accounts and became the root user only when necessary. Linux also has other security features, like AppArmor and SELinux.\nMarket Share and Demographics: Linux has historically had low market share. It has also been the domain of geeks that tend to be more computer-literate. Compared to Windows, it’s not nearly as big or easy a target.\n\nStaying Secure on Linux\n\nWhile you don’t need an antivirus, you do need to follow some basic security practices, no matter which operating system you use:\nKeep Your Software Updated: In an age when browsers and their plug-ins – particularly Java and Flash – are the top targets, staying up-to-date with the latest security patches is important. The biggest malware problem on Mac OS X was caused by the Java plug-in. With a cross-platform piece of software like Java, the same vulnerability can work on Windows, Mac, and Linux. On Linux, you can update all your software with a single, integrated updater.\nBeware Phishing: Phishing – the practice of creating websites that pretend to be other websites – is just as dangerous on Linux or Chrome OS as it is on Windows. If you visit a website that pretends to be your bank’s website and enter your banking information, you are in trouble. Luckily, browsers like Firefox and Chrome on Linux have the same anti-phishing filter they do on Windows. You don’t need an Internet security suite to protect against phishing. (However, bear in mind that the phishing filter doesn’t catch everything.)\nDon’t Run Commands You Don’t Trust: The Linux command prompt is powerful. Before you copy-paste a command you read somewhere into the terminal, ask yourself whether you trust the source. It could be one of the 8 Deadly Commands You Should Never Run on Linux.\n\nWhen You Need an Antivirus on Linux\n\nAntivirus software isn’t entirely useless on Linux. If you are running a Linux-based file server or mail server, you will probably want to use antivirus software. If you don’t, infected Windows computers may upload infected files to your Linux machine, allowing it to infect other Windows systems.\nThe antivirus software will scan for Windows malware and delete it. It isn’t protecting your Linux system – it’s protecting the Windows computers from themselves.\nsource1\nSource2\n\nA: In most peoples experience, Linux doesn't NEED anti-virus. I recently read an article about Linux anti-virus and this isn't an exact quote not is it the exact truth. but its not far from it: \"For every thousand viruses or worms for windows, theres one for mac. And for every thousand for mac, theres one for Linux.\"  I know plenty of users who don't use anti-virus with Ubuntu, and haven't had a single threat let alone a successful attack. If you're doing some adventurous browsing or snooping where you should, or you just want to be more safe than sorry, sure get anti-virus. But you shouldn't worry if not.\n\nA: you don't need an antivirus unless you are on a dual boot system and want to scan the windows partitions. And also don't install any software outside software center unless you really trust them and you'll be fine and as you say you are new take it as an advice, be careful with terminal commands that you find on the internet especially that start with \"su, sudo and gksu\" and also that which have wget and sh (download and execute script)types\nbottom line you don't need an av as long as you know what you are doing and if you don't know what you are doing Av cant help \n\nA: As far as I understand he means not a mere virus that deletes files and destroys OS, he means malware stuff like trojans, keyloggers, profile checkers.. Yes Linux is safer as compared to Windows but how can he make sure that he won't get a rootkit stuff from unsafe repositories? It's possible though noone mentions here. I personnally use one of the \"personal firewalls\" to detect  suspicious activities, I feel safer. You can find \"personal firewalls\" on the net. \n", "Q: Is over-provisioning of an SSD possible with dual-boot? I have a few machines I'd want to dual boot different OSs with but also maximise the lifetime of the SSD fitted to them.\nI am aware that over-provisioning can help maximise the life of the SSD as it provides space for the SSD to conduct its internal housekeeping.\nWhat is over-provisioning in terms of what space is reserved on the SSD? Is it just creating another (physical type) standard partition? And is it possible to also setup a partitioned dual boot a machine (using the standard procedure) using an over-provisioned SSD?\nExample setup:\nA Lenovo X201S Thinkpad with 256Gb Samsung 840 Pro SSD I fitted myself. This machine is currently single boot Windows 8 Pro 64bit and I intend to dual boot it with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, say W8: 128Gb Ubuntu: 32Gb and a 64Gb shared partition.\nAssuming that over-provisioning is creating a partition, or at least, just allocating unreserved space, then presumably I should have at least 3 physical type partitions available to support dual boot. (4 physical partitions is supported by a standard boot-loader, though a partition can contain multiple logical partitions). Thoughts?\n\nA: Yes it is:\nFor Windows with Ubuntu dual boot:\n\n\n*\n\n*Assuming that you had installed Ubuntu after installing Windows, such that Ubuntu is on the upper end of this disk, you would therefore want to reduce the size of your Ubuntu partition to provide free unused space for the overprovisioning. GPartEd free tool that comes with Ubuntu is ideal for this.\n\n*If you need to also resize the Windows partition to give Ubuntu some more space after freeing up the space, you may need to deal with unmoveable files before you adjust the partition size,  guide here: - If necessary, temporarily disable some functionality to remove unmovable files that may prevent resizing, see guide here: http://www.brandonchecketts.com/archives/how-to-shrink-a-partition-with-unmovable-files-in-windows-7 (includes how to turn off restore point files, and swap file, which you'd need to re-enable after)\n\n\n(I did all of the above)\nAlso, if interested: For Mac OS and Windows (via Bootcamp):\n\n\n*\n\n*Resize the Windows partition using Windows built-in Disk Manager, so that there is some spare unused space at the end of the disk, this is for the overprovisioning, a rule of thumb is to allocate 10% of the disk\n\n*If necessary, temporarily disable some functionality to remove unmovable files that may prevent resizing, see guide here: http://www.brandonchecketts.com/archives/how-to-shrink-a-partition-with-unmovable-files-in-windows-7 (includes how to turn off restore point files, and swap file, which you'd need to re-enable after)\n\n*If necessary, Use CampTune (purchased tool) to increase the Windows partition if you need more space after\n\n\n(I did all of the above)\nI wrote to Samsung on 2 separate occasions and in both they confirmed that overprovisioning is just unallocated space at the end of the drive. There are no vendor unique/specific commands that configure the drive here. Their Samsung Magician software that comes with the SSD has a facility to setup overprovisioning but it is no more sophisticated than setting this up yourself as described, it is just an easier user interface. If this UI approach in the Magician doesn't work, then allocating unused space at the end of the disk has the same effect.\n", "Q: What does the \"nice\" value mean in CPU utilization statistics I am relatively new to Linux and Ubuntu. I have attached the system monitor to the bar (the upper bar of the screen) and opened the preference to configure this gadget. On the processor tab I see that I can mark the choose 5 colors : user, system, nice, IOwait and idle. I can understand all 4 (I think...) except for \"nice\". What is this \"nice\" ? I read this answer and I understand that the superuser can perform tasks with greater priority but , what does it mean if I see it in the system monitor without me running any new nice processes ?\n\nA: The nice field in the CPU bar measure those process that are nicer to other process. The CPU priority in Linux are expressed in nice values, between -20 and 20, the higher the nice value, the lowest the priority in the CPU.\nWhat you are seeing is a nice (low priority) process working and using the CPU. This is to prevent you from thinking that your system is under load that would happen if you only see 100% utilization and indicating that when you need those cycles you will have them.\n\nA: The nice value for the processor is \n\nthe time the CPU has spent running users' processes that have been \"niced\".\n\n(from man top) A \"niced\" process is one with a positive nice value. So if the processor's nice value is high, that means it is working with some low priority processes. So this indicator is useful when you see high CPU utilization and you are afraid that this high load will have bad effect on your system:\n\n\n*\n\n*High CPU utilization with high nice value: Nothing to worry, not so important tasks doing their job, important processes will easily get CPU time if they need. This situation is not a real bottleneck.\n\n*High CPU utilization with low nice value: Something to worry because the CPU is stressed with important processes so these or new processes will have to wait. This situation is a real bottleneck.\n\n\nI think this nice value is not too important for a simple user, this is more useful in a server environment.\n", "Q: Cannot install or update through Terminal Get this Error (in the body of question) Everything was working fine but now every-time I run sudo apt-get install (program) or even sudo apt-get update I get this message:\nE: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'sudo dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem.\n\nwhat must I do to fix this?

My disk is MBR and I think the problem is having more than 4 partitions. I created another Local Disk from inside Windows but Ubuntu just sees that drive and the drive I shrinked to make it as one partition. \nSo, right now I want to install Ubuntu without killing my Windows (if it's possible). Perhaps there is some way I can make an extended partition and use that but I don't know how to (I can shrink one of my drives but that wouldn't make a new partition would it?).\nHere is a screenshot of GParted in Ubuntu:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*I don't know why the 800 GB is unallocated, in Windows, it is consisted of 2 drives (I've named them Local Disk E:\\ and L:)\n\n\nAlso, when I right-click on that 800 GB partition and click on \"New...\" it gives me this error:\n\nWhich makes sense and is exactly what I'm trying to do but I don't know which partition I can remove so that my Windows doesn't break. Also, I don't know how to create an extended partition as I haven't done it before so I guess I would need help with that.\nEDIT: Here's a screenshot of the Warning descriptions beside the partitions:\n\nFor the NTFS partitions the description is the same apart from that last part which instead has written:\nThe following list of software packages is required for ntfs file system support: ntfsprogs / ntfs-3g\nThank you!\n\nA: First, unallocated space in a partitioning tool like GParted is different from unused space on a partition. Unallocated space in the partition table is unusable from an OS unless and until a partition is created in that space, or until an existing partition is resized to cover that space. This is because a partition is sort of like a room number in a hotel; without it, although the space exists on the disk(/hotel), the OS(/guest) can't locate it.\nSecond, you should never create a partition in Windows that you intend to be used by Linux. You seem to have gotten lucky and didn't do any damage, but many people who do what you did end up having to use third-party utilities to fix the damage -- when asked to create more than four partitions, Windows will, unbidden, convert from a standard partitioning setup to a Logical Disk Manager (LDM), aka dynamic disks, setup. You can't install Linux to such a disk, so you've got to undo this operation, which of course can't be done with the tools that Microsoft provides.\nIf you intended to install Linux to one of your existing partitions, then I recommend you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete that partition.\n\n*Move/resize your remaining partitions so that they're contiguous. If you move /dev/sda4, do so from Windows; if you do it from Linux, Windows will probably stop booting.\n\n*Reboot to Ubuntu (or any Linux emergency system).\n\n*Create an extended partition in the unallocated space and create logical partitions inside that extended partition for Linux's use.\n\n*Install Ubuntu to the logical partition(s) you've created.\n\n\nIf, OTOH, all four of your existing partitions are in use by Windows, you could do the same as I've just described, but for step #1, delete a partition that you're willing to sacrifice (because it's empty or because you transfer its data to another partition). If that's not possible, try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Assuming /dev/sda4 is your Windows C: drive (it's the only one big enough to be that), move it to the end of the disk. Use Windows for this job; if you use Linux, it will probably no longer boot.\n\n*Assuming /dev/sda3 is not involved in the Windows boot process, convert it to a logical partition using FixParts.\n\n*Using GParted in Linux, resize the extended partition (which FixParts will create) to cover the space between what used to be /dev/sda3 but that will now be /dev/sda5 and /dev/sda4.\n\n*Install Ubuntu, and let it (or tell it to) create additional extended partitions for its own use.\n\n\nBefore undertaking either of these tasks, back up any important data on your disk. Partitioning operations are inherently risky, and the sorts of things you need to do run the further risk of disrupting the Windows boot process. Moving and resizing NTFS may be a little safer in Windows than in Linux. This is especially true when you're dealing with a partition that boots in BIOS mode.\n\nA: According to your second image (On that image Windows already create 4 Primary Partition under MBR disk) it's impossible to create more partition. so i have some suggestion which both require to delete your entire HDD\n1.Use GParted to repartitioning the whole disk.Create an Unallocated partition and some extended partition.so you can install your Windows on extended partition while the System Reserved and others can reside on primary partition\n2.Delete your entire HDD and re-format it under GPT Partitioning Table.So theoretically you can create unlimited of primary partition.But if you want to use this your BIOS should support UEFI and you should use Windows 64-bit installer also (not also the OS but also the installer)\nsorry.only this that i can suggest to you\n", "Q: Does choosing the \"Replace Windows 7 with Ubuntu\" delete my drive data?

I have just started using this OS so my experience is next to nothing.\n\nA: No there are no incompatible file extensions. Ububntu doesn't really care about file extensions and just sees a file. \nIt treats every file the same and doesn't break them up into different sorts that need to be treated differently.\nThe programs and apps themselves know how to deal with file extensions if they come across them, but if you ask a Ubuntu app to open a file it will not worry about the extension unless its own program logic needs to.\n\nA: Wine can be used to run windows programs(i.e .exe files).most programs will run easily with no or little twerks.  \nthere could be hundreds(if not thousands) of file extensions that are not compatible with Ubuntu out of the box.this is because anyone can create different extensions for there private use,or for use with a specific programs.for example a program Anki uses .apkg format.naturally this file format would be incompatible with windows or osx or any other os.  \nBut that's not all,Ubuntu comes with a set of very good apps,and other apps like 7zip\nsupport most of file formats which are frequently used in day-to-day life.\n\nfor how-to on Wine\nofficial  wine wiki\nhow-to-use-wine‎\nhow to use wine on linux \n\nA: Linux/Ubuntu technically does not work with extensions but checks the 1st few characters inside the file to determine what that file is.

In Linux/Ubuntu clicking the file will open and show a picture. \nYou can not run software from another system on a different system (software made in Java is an exception).

For example, while MPlayer is paused extract the line that is currently on the frame and send it into Goldendict. A method that takes minimum actions, a shortcut key, for instance, would be great or selecting subtitles on the screen with a mouse. Any ideas? \n\nA: No. This is all you can do with subtitles and extracting them. Depending in the type of file you can use:\nMPsub: -dumpmpsub\nSubRip: -dumpsrtsub\nMicroDVD: -dumpmicrodvdsub\nJACOsub: -dumpjacosub\nSami: -dumpsami\n\nThere are some more on that site but all will extract all lines and not just the current line.\nSo to get a specific line you need to extract the subtitles to a text file. Examine the text file, locate the timestamp you need and the copy/paste the line.

And I tried it with CD and USB.\nFor burning CD I used Poweriso.\nFor USB i used poweriso and Universal-USB-Installer-1.9.5.1.\nThis is the screen that pops up when trying to install - \nI'm using HP EliteBook 8540w\nintel core 2 i5-520M \nNvidia quadro fx 1800M\nCurrently using windows 8.1\n\nA: This is not a Ubuntu version and/or 32bit or 64bit issue but caused by how Nvidia hardware (NVIDIA Quadro FX 1800M - 343.22) in the HP Elitebook 8540w is handled by Ubuntu during Live CD or plain install. I would call it a bug but it is there for quite some time. It can be fixed though. There is another site mentioned on this thread but it is a bit too complex since it proposes to edit Grub, which isn't necessary and tricky since Grub2.\nFurther I found that downloading the driver .run file from the official Nvidia site certainly was NOT the right driver and caused problems, whereas the standard (-current or -340) as available through the Ubuntu repositories was fine.\nHere is the straightforward procedure (I tried distro Zorin 9, recommended for WindowsMovers, but assume Ubuntu 14 is the same)\n\n\n*\n\n*Load a Zorin9 (Ubuntu14) LiveDVD into the DVD reader or connect a Live USB\nstick and (re-)boot from it\n\n*Pess any key when you see the first screen with the * / keyboard \n\n*Pess F6 and then ESC - allowing you to edit the boot\ncommand with the Arrow keys and typing in or over the existing command \n\n*Navigate to quiet splash and replace that with  nouveau.modeset=0  \n\n*Continue boot with F10. \n\n*In live CD you will be using the Xorg 1024x768 driver and you cannot update the driver in live CD mode. So wait until CD booting is ready (no strange distorted screen now!) \n\n*From there install on HD. Dont forget to have an internet connection or install will hang\n\n*Reboot (from the HD)\n\n*At the boot screen (Zorin or Ubuntu) press E and again here replace quiet splash with  nouveau.modeset=0 and boot with F10\n(off topic) (In case (as mine) your password is not accepted even when you are sure it is correct, you need to reboot in Advanced-recovery-root mount as rw (see below for the command) and check if there is a home directory, or change the access rights, since that didnt happen well in Zorin...)\n\n\n*Update your driver by Software Center/Dash, or in terminal mode as below, which for the 8540w means looking for nvidia-340 or nvidia-current.\n\n*Reboot. You should see the Nvidia logo shortly and you know you are fine!\n\n\nAlternative commandline from point 8:\n\n\n*Reboot\n\n*Select Advanced and then recovery\n\n*Select networking (have a wired internet connection!) and then root\n\n*sudo mount -o rw,remount /\n\n*sudo ubuntu-drivers devices\n\n*Look at which driver will be recommended. you can then\n\n*\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get update\nand then\n\n*sudo apt-get install nvidia-340\n\n*or sudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\n\n*Reboot\nYou should be fine now.\nIn terms of usability I find the HP8540 OK with Ubuntu but it seems to me the power/heat/fan control is not at the Windows driver level. Nevertheless, still a great laptop especially if free.\n", "Q: 32bit program on 64bit Ubuntu fails when using linux 32 before setup.sh When I try to install a 32 bit program on ubuntu 13.10 64bit it falis.

I've been using 12.04 since it came out, never changed due to stability, but I do fear that I am missing a lot of stuff and new software in the newest versions. My idea was to upgrade to 14.04 when it pops out, from lts to lts, but I feel that I can't wait. Is there any issue from upgrading from 12.04 to 12.10, 13.04 and then 13.10? I remember that when upgrading windows vista to seven, instead of doing a clean install of windows seven, would make the windows heavier on resources, and quite slow in general.\nSo, what are the risks of upgrading to the latest non lts release instead of doing a clean install? are there performance issues? loss of personal data? \n\nA: There's always a chance of something going wrong when doing an upgrade. And doing 3 upgrades in a row is just asking for trouble.\nBy doing a fresh install, you have far less risk of corrupting your install, you can start out with an optimized partitioning and get the \"new install\" feeling.\nJust remember to backup your /home before doing anything. Upgrade or fresh install, make sure your data is safe!\n", "Q: Guake terminal hiding on AltGr - can't type pipes Today my Guake Terminal started acting up in a way I haven't seen before - every time I press AltGr (which on my Swedish keyboard is the right Alt, right next to Spacebar on the right-hand side) the terminal looses focus and hides. On my Swedish keyboard this is extremely inconvenient, since AltGr is used to type pipes (|)...\nI did install some updates which required a restart of my system today, but IIRC that was only Ubuntu Base and nothing else. I don't know for certain if this behavior was present before the update - since the popup came up when I started my system, I didn't do much work before I installed them and rebooted.\nI also took a look in the Guake preferences to see if there was anything fishy with the keyboard shortcuts, but AltGr isn't used at all, and all other shortcuts work as expected. AltGr works normally in other context, such as an actual Terminal window (opened e.g. by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T) or typing here in Chromium.\nWhat could have caused this? How do i troubleshoot and/or fix it?\n\nA: I've found a workaround that actually solves the problem for me, if only temporarily1: restart the window manager. Using Unity, this can be done by running\ncompiz --replace &\n\nin a terminal.\nBut be careful!\nCompiz spits out an aweful lot of gore in the terminal - the first time I did this I forgot the & and my initial reaction to the gore was Ctrl+C - killing my window manager.\nIt is (supposedly, I never tried it myself) possible to recover, using tricks like Ctrl+Shift+<number> to get to a TTY terminal, and run\nDISPLAY=:0 compiz --replace &\n\nbut tread carefully anyway. Save all your stuff before trying this, in case you do something stoopid and need to reboot.\nCredits:\nI probably wouldn't have figured this out without looking in the bug report which falconer brought to my attention.\n\n1) I haven't had this problem since, though. Touch wood 'n' stuff.\n\nA: Try going into guake preferences and under the General tab make sure that Stay on top is checked and Hide on lose focus is unchecked. (Although these settings doesn't explain why it is hiding on AltGr they may help.)\nUPDATE: I made up a series of commands to show us the passive grabs on a keystroke. (Unfortunately I couldn't find an easier way to show passive grabs as XF86LogGrabInfo only shows active grabs.) So please run this command and post its output so we can find out if something is grabbing that AltGr key:\nxdotool keydown \"ISO_Level3_Shift\"; sleep 1; xdotool key \"XF86LogGrabInfo\"; xdotool keyup \"ISO_Level3_Shift\"; tail /var/log/Xorg.0.log\n\nor just\nxdotool keydown \"ISO_Level3_Shift\"; xdotool key \"XF86LogGrabInfo\"; xdotool keyup \"ISO_Level3_Shift\"; tail /var/log/Xorg.0.log\n\n(The above code will trigger the AltGr keypress event, so your guake terminal will hide/unhide during the execution, so better to run this command from e.g. gnome-terminal. If guake doesn't hide/unhide then something is wrong with your layout as your AltGr is not mapped to ISO_Level3_Shift)\n\nUpdate as it looks like this maybe a layout problem.\nFirst I would just try switching to a different layout and test if AltGr is functioning well in an other layout (Dash->Keyboard Layout and press on the + sign to bring up other layouts.) You may try out a different swedish layout or a layout of another North/Eastern European language (At least I know that these are using AltGr, but of course don't switch to a cyrillic, like Russian or Serb.) Though it is unlikely that the problem is with some of the official layouts, more likely it is a problem with some fine-tuning of an official layout. So if you modified your layout in some way remove those modifications and check again.\nNext you can test with xev the keysym what your AltGr is reporting. Launch xev, click in its window, press AltGr, see the output. But if it causes a Focus-Out event then it likely won't catch it. In this case try with xev -root to monitor the root window, maybe you altgr is going there. (This latter won't draw a window, so just press AltGr and see if there is some useful output.) \nYou can also dump your keyboard layout with xkbcomp $DISPLAY output.xkb then examine the output.xkb file with a text editor, it should contain this\nkey <RALT> {\n    type= \"ONE_LEVEL\",\n    symbols[Group1]= [ ISO_Level3_Shift ]\n};`\n\n(At least for me it does contain that and my AltGr is working correctly.)\nYou can also check if your keyboard has some modifier key which is turned on and maybe changes the behaviour of the AltGr.\n\nUpdate 3, I think this is the most likely situation in your case\nPlease also check if you are maybe hit by this bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity/+bug/971462\nThough I never had that kind of problem with the HUD, some people looks like have it. \nThere is a workaround in that bugreport's conversation:\n\nSystem Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Launchers > Key to show the HUD\n  to your right Alt key.\n\nBut of course it is better if you change it to your left Alt-key, don't know why he proposes the right. For me at that option I indeed have Alt L by default.\nYou may also try to disable that shortcut totally.\n\nA: I had the same issue. Workaround:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold Shift+AltGr\n\n*Release Shift\n\n*Type the key you want\n\n\nWorks for me.\n\nA: I observe the same problem since recently (Ubuntu 13.10). I have also a Swedish keyboard, but the issue remains even if I change the keyboard layout.\nI tested the command:  xkbcomp $DISPLAY output.xkb but everything seems correct.\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu on Windows 8.1 Can I install Ubuntu on a Windows 8.1 computer?

As usual the selected text can be pasted using the mouse middle click.\n\n*Run in terminal:\n$ cngstr \"string\" \"replacement\"\n\n\n*Next when you paste using mouse middle click, the word(s) \"string\" in your selection will be replaced with \"replacement\".\nExample\nSay your selection is \"hello world!\". Next you run in terminal,\ncngstr world potato\n\nUse \"\" for a string consisting of more than one word. Next when you paste using the mouse middle clip, \"hello potato!\" will appear. See the screenshots.\n\nHow it works\n\n\n*\n\n*xclip -o prints the selection to standard output which is being piped to sed here.\n\n*Next sed is replacing the strings taking input from the user.\n\n*Finally the modified contents are being passed to xclip which put it in the primary selection and becomes available for pasting by a mouse middle click.\n\n\nI think xclip comes with the default Ubuntu distribution. Otherwise install it through apt-get:\nsudo apt-get install xclip\n\n\nExtra Information\nMake the modified contents available to clipboard also\nIf you want the modified contents also be available to the clipboard so that Ctrl+V also works as well, add the following line in the above script.\necho `xclip -o` | xclip -selection c\n\nThe above line will pass the contents of the primary selection to the clipboard. The modified function will look like:\ncngstr(){\n    echo `xclip -o` | sed -e \"s#$1#$2#g\" | xclip\n    echo `xclip -o` | xclip -selection c\n}\n\nA Bash function that can modify contents of the clipboard (i.e., copied using Ctrl+C or from the right click menu) and make the modified string available to the primary selection as well as to the clipboard.\ncngstr1(){\n    echo `xclip -o -selection c` | sed -e \"s#$1#$2#g\" | xclip\n    echo `xclip -o` | xclip -selection c\n}\n\nxclip -o prints the contents of the primary selection by default. Use -selection c to print the contents of the clipboard. See man xclip for more.\n\nYou can combine these two functions in a script using a switch case,\n#!/bin/sh\nstring=\"$2\"\nreplacement=\"$3\"\n\ncngstr(){\n    echo `xclip -o` | sed -e \"s#$1#$2#g\" | xclip\n    echo `xclip -o` | xclip -selection c\n}\n\ncngstr1(){\n    echo `xclip -o -selection c` | sed -e \"s#$1#$2#g\" | xclip\n    echo `xclip -o` | xclip -selection c\n}\n\nif [ $# -lt 2 ]\nthen\n    echo \"Usage : $0 [c|p] \\\"string\\\" \\\"replacement\\\" \"\n    exit\nfi\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n\n    c)  cngstr1 \"$string\" \"$replacement\"\n        ;;\n    p)  cngstr \"$string\" \"$replacement\"\n        ;;\n    *) echo \"Usage : $0 [c|p] \\\"string\\\" \\\"replacement\\\" \"\n        ;;\nesac\n\nUsage\n./script.sh [c|p] \"string\" \"replacement\"\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Use option c for altering contents copied using the clipboard i.e., contents copied using Ctrl+C or from the right click menu.\n\n*Use option p for altering the contents copied using the primary selection.\n", "Q: Software center shows “use this source” instead of “install” I was downloading vlc media player. Suddenly there was a network problem and it stopped. Then when I tried to install it again it does not show the install option, but instead shows \"use this source\".\n\nA: Install VLC this way.

Use a Live-USB/CD. \nI would use NTFS or FAT32 for the file storage drives, since they can be accessed from both Ubuntu and Windows. \nQuestions? \n\nA: Ubuntu is installed to /dev/sda3.  I have no idea what that 3 GB partition is, but based on the fact that it is named \"OS\" and you have a dell recovery partition, I would say that it was where you had Windows installed at one point, and you must have deleted most of the files there and shrank the partition to install Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu 13.10 run well on Alienware 14 laptops?

Not even asterisks appear\nFor example, here is my 20+ character long password:\n\n:-)\n\nA: \nWhat's the Issue?\nA lot of new users are thrown off by an inconsistency in the Ubuntu interface. When you enter a password in\nthe GUI (graphical user interface, where you point and click), there\nis visual feedback—a dot or an asterisk for every character you type.\nWhen you enter your password in the terminal, the terminal doesn't\nseem to \"accept\" your password because it doesn't offer any visual\nfeedback for the characters you enter.\nHow do I solve the \"problem\"?\nYour password is being accepted in the terminal.

UEFI\n\n*Dual boot problem, black screen during the ubuntu boot\nUnfortunately, this problem has multiple causes, so a solution for one computer may not work for another. Two particularly common solutions are to add nomodeset as a kernel option (using GRUB or whatever other boot loader you're using) and to hit the screen brightness key to bring up the brightness (which sometimes comes up completely dimmed). FWIW, my new Lenovo has the latter issue, but compiling a 3.12.6 kernel from source code fixed it.

It is often used to execute untested code, or untrusted programs from unverified third-parties, suppliers, untrusted users and untrusted websites.\"\nSometimes there is more than one app that is candidate to solve my problems, in that case I want to get the one which better fit my needs, so I install all of them, but I just want to try them, I want to \"restore\" my machine state as it was before the installations, of all changes the software did. Just removing them is not enough, it is because them generate dot files in my home, or generate logs files, or change other software's settings, I want to have register of all the changes the app do when it runs, and undo them.\nYes, a VM would solve my problem but besides taking a large space to hold two or more linux installations, it also lose performance.\nA separated linux installation in my disk doing chroot would please me better than a VM in performance, but it still takes some unwanted spaces because of repeated files, almost all of them are the same of my original distro.\nThis is what prompted me to open this topic, if somehow I could return to a previous state of my entire disk, like a version control system, or like the qemu-img's backing file \"If a base image is specified with -o backing_file=filename, the image will only record differences between itself and the base image\". Of course this still isn't the best solution, because I wish undo only a specific app changes.\nThe ideal solution would be something like that:\n$ mkdir dir1 dir2\n$ echo \"Lipsum\" > dir1/file1\n$ echo \"Original\" > dir1/file2\n$ sudo mount -o bind -some-magic-flag dir1 dir2\n$ echo \"Changed\" > dir2/file2\n$ touch dir2/file3\n$ ls -1 dir2\nfile1\nfile2\nfile3\n# it's ok\n$ ls -1 dir1\nfile1\nfile2\n# file3 sould not be here!\n$ sudo umount dir2\n$ ls -1 dir2\nfile2\nfile3\n# file1 was not changed, but file2 was\n$ cat dir1/file2\nOriginal\n$ cat dir2/file2\nChanged\n\nThis is what I need!\n\nA: Create a virtual machine, boot it up, and apply your install there. They, if it is OK, install it in your physical machine; if not, delete the VM. virtual machine inside ubuntu may be useful to you.\nIn Linux, the sandbox IS a VM.\n", "Q: bash: No such file or directory I've written a simple C program that uses the GTK+ visual interface (I can post the code if it's relevant).

Is there a command at the grub shell that would indicate if the machine is presenting EFI or BIOS firmware?\nI'm using GRUB 2.00 on a 2010 Mac Pro. This computer has EFI firmware of course.  But I have been trying for a couple of days to get it to boot Ubuntu in BIOS-emulation mode for want of NVIDIA display drivers. My understanding is that by the time GRUB is running, the decision to use EFI or BIOS emulation has already been made.  So how can I check from GRUB?\n\nA: As of GRUB 2.00, assuming GRUB is working well enough to get into normal mode rather than rescue mode, echo $grub_platform from the GRUB shell will show pc in BIOS mode and efi in UEFI mode.\nThe BIOS build corresponds to the grub-pc package, and the UEFI build corresponds to the grub-efi-amd64 (or, less commonly, grub-efi-ia32) package.\n\nA: Grub2 implements shell-like syntax.

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, Chrome 31.0.1650.63. Somehow my Chrome browser window has gotten into a state where it behaves different from before and different from any other window that I have ever experienced. On this Chrome window, when I drag a side to change the size of the window then the opposite side is resized at the same time in the opposite direction. When I drag a corner to move two sides then both opposite sides are also moved (in the opposite direction, so the window maintains the position of its center). Shutdown and restart of the computer did not remove the problem. How do I change things back to the state where dragging one side or one corner affects only that side or corner?\n\nA: I had a similar problem, but in my case resize and maximize where disabled, I couldn't drag the window either. When I tried using the mouse to resize it nothing happened and the chrome window was covering the whole screen and I wasn't able to \"restore\" or maximize. Even when I tried using the context menu with CTRL+space, resize and maximize options were disabled. \nWhat I did was open a new tab (CTRL+T) and then drag that new tab down so that chrome creates a new windows. The new window had all the options I wanted enabled and I could drag that new window around. I closed the other one, and when I start chrome again everything works fine. \nI hope this can help in your case.\n", "Q: Transmission stops responding frequently / slowing down Ubuntu So I'm using Transmission to download some files but it has been acting really weird recently.\nOn the program, I'm getting a bit of slow download speed and the program freezes a lot, and sometimes the GUI stays black and white, even the close button, that usually is orange. \nI'm also feeling that it is slowing down my pc in general.

I'm trying to install Ubuntu in BIOS emulation mode, not the native EFI firmware, on my Mac Pro (2010).  I'm doing NVIDIA CUDA / OpenCL development and I require the NVIDIA proprietary graphics drivers.  There is pretty universal consensus around the web that the NVIDIA proprietary drivers will not run in EFI mode.\nI have not been able to get to that BIOS emulation mode condition.\nThe most clear-cut installation method I have tried is to install without GRUB using ubiquity -b from the Live CD in combination with rEFInd.  This installation is very smooth, but the resulting Ubuntu install is running in EFI mode.\nAn alternative I have tried is to install without -b and to install the boot loader to a different partition on the same drive.  This time, my machine first boots to the GRUB menu, and correctly starts Ubuntu 13.10, but it starts in EFI mode.  (Evidenced by ls /sys/firmware/efi )\nI have confirmed that the hard drive is partitioned with hybrid-MBR, and the GRUB2 partition is marked as bootable on the MBR.  (using gdisk /dev/sdb)\nI'm not sure about this, but I am wondering if the Ubuntu installer is installing an EFI version of GRUB instead of a BIOS version, because the Ubuntu installer is running in EFI mode.  If this is the case, how can one start the installer from the Live CD in BIOS mode?\nI have this related question regarding, is the BIOS-emulation vs EFI decision made before, during, or after the GRUB boot loader?\n\nA: I was able to get Ubuntu booting in BIOS mode following experimentation with manual GRUB installation. Subsequent to that, my NVIDIA drivers worked.\nThe key factor is that grub-install will either install a BIOS or EFI version based on factors I don't understand. More importantly, I was not able to find an option that forces the BIOS version to be installed from an EFI machine. (The --target=i386-pc option was not working for me.) I found a special case: when running the Ubuntu Live CD on a Mac, grub-install installs a BIOS version not EFI, even though the Live CD is booted in EFI mode.\nSketch of the procedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Partition hard drive in Mac Disk Utility, making at least two partitions for Ubuntu. 1) a very small GRUB boot partition, and a partition for the root file system.  Format for the partitions can be anything, they will be changed later.\n\n*Boot the Live CD.  Start the installer from a terminal using ubiquity -b.\n\n*Run the custom installation \"Something Else\". When given the partition options, select the root partition and format it for linux, setting the / mount point.  Edit the the GRUB boot partition, changing the partition type to BIOS Boot -- and mark it System Partition and Legacy BIOS Bootable.\n\n*Complete the Ubuntu installation.  Do not reboot.\n\n*We'll install GRUB from Terminal in the Live CD session.  For whatever reason, this installs the BIOS GRUB. Terminal Commands: (sdX is the drive to install GRUB and the Ubuntu installation)\n$ sudo mount /dev/sdX /mnt\n$ grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sdX\n  Installation finished. No error reported.\n$ grub-install --root-directory=/mnt --recheck /dev/sdX\n  Installation finished. No error reported.\n$ ls /mnt/boot/grub\n  #the presence of the director i386-pc is a great sign.\n\n\n*Configuring the GRUB installation is a bit tricky.  We run it as though /mnt is the root filesystem.\n$ sudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev && sudo mount --bind /dev/pts /mnt/dev/pts && sudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc && sudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys\n$ sudo chroot /mnt\n$ update-grub\n$ exit\n\nRunning grub-install from the above context would install the EFI GRUB.  This explains the two steps.\nNote: If the above update-grub command fails due to executable not found then this procedure needs an adjustment. That indicates the initial condition for Step 5 is that the application package GRUB2 be installed on the target installation already. This procedure has not been tested straight through.\n\n*If all went well, you should be able to restart.  Hold down the option key, and you should a boot option presented by the Mac called Windows.  That should boot you into GRUB, which will be set up to boot the new Ubuntu installation.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Touch - Multiple App Windows I'm learning how to make Ubuntu Touch OS applications, and I looked all over the web for something, but didn't find any satisfying results.

It's dual core and the default frequency is 1.8 ghz. For the past few months, the clock speed has been droppign to 800mhz. I installed a program that allows me to control the clock speed for the K8 processor family called cpupowerd so I am able to adjust the speed back to what It's suppose to be easily. I installed the program about 2 months before this problem started happening.\nIt typically occurs when I'm running an application, or applications that require a rather large amount of system resources. If I run videos on youtube via firefox, occasionally the clock speed will drop, not necessarily though. I will be obvious as the machine starts to become somewhat unresponsive, and with video streaming, the frame rate will drop dramatically. I know the clock speed of the processor is dropping because of the outputs from:\n$ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep \"MHz\"\ncpu MHz     : 800.000\ncpu MHz     : 800.000\n\nand\n$ sudo cpupowerd -s\ncpupowerd 0.2.1 written by Markus Strobl.\nWARNING: This program could cause damage to your Hardware!\nVendor                      : AMD\nFamily                      : K8\nModel                       : 4\n  Mastercpuid               : 0\n    Affected cpuids         : 0 1\n    Current voltage (VID)   : 0.8000 V (30)\n    Current frequency (FID) : 800 MHz (0)\n    Supported frequencies   : 800 1600 1800 MHz\n\nI am able to reset it with \n$ sudo cpupowerd --freq \"0|1800\"\ncpupowerd 0.2.1 written by Markus Strobl.\nWARNING: This program could cause damage to your Hardware!\n\nFor a while I thought something from Chrome was causing the problem (as there were several Chrome processes running even when I wasn't using the browser). However, I uninstalled Chrome and the problem still persists whenever I need to do something that requires more resources. This is particularly a problem when I run virtualbox which will cause the system to lock up completely (800mhz on a dual core processor just can't handle the sudden load).\nWhen booting, accessing the system bios doesn't let me adjust the clockspeed which is set to 1800mhz (as I want it).\nWhat is causing this shift in processing speed? Are there any logs that I can access that might shed light?\nEdit:\nRegardless of what speed the processor is actually running out, dmidecode reports 1800MHz\n$ sudo dmidecode -t processor | grep \"Speed\" \n    Max Speed: 1800 MHz\n    Current Speed: 1800 MHz\n\n\nA: OK, suggest you time how long it takes to start dropping in speed.\nThen, if you're somewhere frosty, take it outside. Does the speed pick back up again after a bit?  If you are not somewhere frosty (Scofield Barracks, say, or Oz), borrow a hair drier and put it on no heat/fan only, then point it at your lappie's intake vent. This could show an old, tired fan, or (more likely in 30 yrs of experience with these infernal devices) there's foreign objects within obstructing airflow.

Is it possible to copy over the current Ubuntu or not?\n\nA: \nIs it possible to copy over the current Ubuntu or not?\n\nYes it is, but it is not guaranteed that it will work as it should. \nTransfer an existing Ubuntu installation to an empty partition with rsync.\nLinux filesystem is a prerequisite (ext4 is preferred) \nFirst create the partition (ext4 filesystem). Use gparted to create a partition in your HDD. Be sure that is equal or even better bigger than your current Ubuntu installation. \nThen mount the new ext4 partition under /mnt directory. We assume here that is /dev/sda1\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt \n\nNow prepare for the last step. My suggestion (it is not a rule) is to close any programs you have open and do not do anything until the end. \nsudo rsync -aAXv /* /mnt/ --exclude={/dev/*,/proc/*,/sys/*,/tmp/*,/run/*,/mnt/*,/media/*,/lost+found}\n\nWhen the copy is done,\ngive an additional command (maybe is not needed, but in any case) \nsudo grub-install --recheck /dev/sda \n\nAgain, we assume here that the HDD is the /dev/sda drive and the  new created partition (for the Ubuntu transfer) is /dev/sda1. \nReboot your PC, set it to boot from the HDD first. \nGood Luck.\n", "Q: BT_GET_CAPABILITIES warning slowing down audio apps I'm using a bluetooth audio receiver to stream music from my PC to an old stereo.\nEverything works fine, except that everytime an app needs to use audio, and starts initializing ALSA, it gets lots of warnings like this:\nALSA lib audio/pcm_bluetooth.c:1614:(audioservice_expect) BT_GET_CAPABILITIES failed : Input/output error(5)\nALSA lib audio/pcm_bluetooth.c:1614:(audioservice_expect) BT_GET_CAPABILITIES failed : Input/output error(5)\nALSA lib audio/pcm_bluetooth.c:1614:(audioservice_expect) BT_GET_CAPABILITIES failed : Input/output error(5)\nALSA lib audio/pcm_bluetooth.c:1614:(audioservice_expect) BT_GET_CAPABILITIES failed : Input/output error(5)\nALSA lib pcm_dmix.c:957:(snd_pcm_dmix_open) The dmix plugin supports only playback stream\nCannot connect to server socket err = No such file or directory\nCannot connect to server socket\njack server is not running or cannot be started\n\nI know it's safe to ignore them, but it takes about 20 seconds to initialize audio because of this. For instance, Audacity takes too long to open, and crashes eventually by this. And there are also some apps that show a timeout error and I just can't use them if I have bluetooth turned on.\nI tried googling it and there seems to be a bug filled with bluez-alsa but couldn't get more info than that.\nAny workaround suggested?\n\nA: Depending on the application, it might be possible to disable ALSA support so that it instead uses Pulseaudio directly.\nFor example I have an OpenAL game which shows this problem. I edited /etc/openal/alsoft.conf and added the line drivers = pulse, so that OpenAL will always use Pulseaudio rather than checking for ALSA, OSS or other audio frameworks. Since it appears to be the ALSA framework which causes the BT_GET_CAPABILITIES error, this change fixed the problem for me.\n", "Q: How to access Media Files across Android and Ubuntu while using dual-boot I'm using dual-boot on my Nexus 4 with Android and Ubuntu OS.

It seems that this agent is not setup correctly in your environment.\nI had the same problem using gnome-disks within an i3wm-session (in archlinux -- however this should be similar under Ubuntu): After having installed the (legacy) \"polkit-gnome\" authentication agent (and starting it in a session startup script), I got first the passphrase dialog for specifying the LUKS passphrase of the device and then a second dialog asking for the root password.\nThe command line hack you mention can alternatively also be done using udisksctl in an cleaner way:\nudisksctl unlock --block-device /dev/sda1\nudisksctl mount --block-device /dev/mapper/my_encrypted_volume\n\nNote that the udisksctl unlock will ask for the (same) two passwords as gnome-disks would do when the authentication agent is setup correctly. No need to use sudo here.\nFor further information, dig into udisks2 and polkit documentation or look into udisks2 source code directly. This is how I understood and finally solved the problem for me.\n\nA: The problem can be solved with sudo:\ngksudo gnome-disks\n\nthen, operate normaly\n\nA: What helped me is very similar to Thrushbeard’s explanation, but I can’t post comments yet.\nI installed mate-polkit and then executed /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/polkit-mate-authentication-agent-1.

I am using ngspice in interactive mode on Ubuntu. I expected the up and down arrows to scroll through previous commands just like in bash or pretty much any CLI ever. However doing so in ngspice just prints out \"^[\" or \"[A\". There is a history command and I am able to use \"!\" to execute previously executed commands just like in bash but what I want to do is bring up a previous command and edit it (like I can by pressing the up arrow in bash). Is there any way to so this in ngspice or do I really have to keep typing out the command from scratch if I want to change it?\n\nA: I would upgrade to Quantal or later so the editline support be activated without having to compile stuff, but if you feel hacky you can do this easily (you must make sure that you have the sources repositories activated):\nsudo apt-get build-dep ngspice\nsudo apt-get install dpkg-dev\napt-get source ngspice\ncd ngspice*\nsed '0,/\\.\\/configure/{N;N;s/$/\\n                --with-editline=yes \\\\/}' debian/rules\n## Add the -i option once you are sure of the changes,\n## I recommend using `| grep -A5 -B5 editline` to verify\ndpkg-buildpackage\ndpkg -i ../ngspice*.deb\n\nDone.\n\nA: The ngspice package in the precise repository was compiled without editline support.

When I plug it into my Macbook Pro retina 13 2012 edition, rebooted it and pressed ALT to select to boot from my USB, it gets into it and lets me select \"try\" or \"install ubuntu\". So I selected install, but when i got in it just shows the wallpaper and a mouse, and nothing else, so I can't install it. What can I do?\n\nA: You should install ubuntu by the following steps:\nMake sure you have allocated free space, if it still can`t boot to installation GUI, try to run ubuntu installer in text mode.\n1. First,create a Partition\nThe first step is pretty simple.  You can resize the Macintosh partition using the OSX Disk Utility.  I resized the partition to 90GB and left the rest as free space.\n2. Create USB Installer\nYou should follow the directions to create a 64-bit Ubuntu USB startup drive.\nAt the end of the instructions, you’ll see an error message indicating that OSX isn’t able to read the drive.\nDon’t worry, this is normal and it should still work as a USB installer but you just won’t be able to read/write to the drive itself.\n(OPTIONAL but RECOMMENDED)\nSince you won’t be able to read/write to this drive, if you have another USB stick handy, you should upload the wifi driver to the 2nd USB stick.  After the Ubuntu installation, wifi will not work and you will need to install the driver and its 3 dependencies to get it working.\n3. Install Boot Manager\nI used rEFInd as the boot manager instead of rEFIt.  It seems to work for me.  Download the binary zip file.  Once downloaded and unzipped, open a Terminal window and install:\ncd ~/Downloads/refind-bin-0.6.7  \n ./install.sh \n\n4. Install Ubuntu\nHere comes the fun part.\nInsert your Ubuntu USB installer and restart your computer.  When the computer restarts, you should see your new boot manager screen with an Apple and a triangle shaped icon for the Ubuntu installer.  Right arrow over to the installer and hit Enter to select it.  This will load the typical Ubuntu installer.  Select “Install Ubuntu”.  If this is the first time you are installing Ubuntu, it should give you the option to install Ubuntu alongside Mac OSX.  If you are reinstalling over a bad installation, it will give you the option to erase Ubuntu only and reinstall.  WARNING! If you are attempting a reinstall and select this option, the previous swap partition will not be reused or erased.  A new one will be created meaning you will lose about 8GBs of space for nothing.  Instead of having the installer create the partitions for you, initial install or reinstall, I recommend selecting the “Something else” option and create your own partitions.\nIf you select “Something else” you will see a screen with a list of partitions.  If this is a reinstall, scroll to the bottom of the list and delete the previous install’s partitions.  At the very bottom of the list is “Free space”.  Select that and click on the “+” sign to create a new partition.  You can create a root “/” using ext4 with a size of about 25GB.  Next, create a swap partition with a size around 8 to 16GB.  Finally, create an ext4 home “/home” partition with the rest of the remaining space and continue with the installation.  After the installation, it will ask you to reboot and you should do so.  If you get a blank screen after the message, just hit the space bar and it will continue.\n", "Q: Unable to create partition table/partitions I have a strange situation at the moment and I am not sure if the issue lays on the side of the hardware.\nI wanted to create a new partition table with Gparted as well as with cfdisk.

For the last couple of days I have been trying to install but most importantly run Ubuntu 13.04 and 13.10 on my Intel Core i7 Haswell iMac Model (late 2013). Unfortunately I haven't been able to boot into the system itself. The installation was nice and easy, but as soon as I restart my computer I am stuck at a purple boot screen.\nNow I don't know if I have done anything wrong or if this is related to a hardware issue/the iMac itself. Does Linux support Intel Haswell chipsets at the moment? Or is this an Apple/Mac specific problem?\nHere is how I installed Ubuntu on my new iMac:\n\n\n*\n\n*I installed rEFInd boot manager in OS X 10.8.5. \n\n*Created a bootable Ubuntu USB thumb drive. \n\n*In the installer, I created 3 partitions, 1 for Swap 8 GB, 1 for the BIOS 10 MB (I also tried Efi) but the result is the same and 1 for Ext4 850GB.\n\n*Ran the install and waited until it fished. \n\n*Once everything was successfully installed I was asked to restart my computer.\n\n\nAnd that's about it really, from there on I cannot boot, I'm stuck at the purple screen.\nMy computer specifications are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*iMac (Late 2013)\n\n*3.1GHz Quad-core Intel Core i7 Haswell, Turbo Boost up to 3.9GHz\n\n*16GB 1600MHz DDR3 SDRAM Memory\n\n*1TB Serial ATA Drive @ 5400 rpm\n\n*NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M 1GB GDDR5\n\n\nAny information would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Download the Ubuntu 13.10 64-bit PC (AMD64) desktop image, not the Mac one. Burn it to a CD/DVD with disk utility, the next step is creating a partition for Ubuntu. Go into Disk Utility and manually shrink your Mac partition. Shrinking your Mac partition will create some free, unallocated space, which is exactly what we need. Don't forget to Install The rEFInd boot manager before you proceed.\nNow we can begin installing Ubuntu. Boot from Ubuntu CD by holding the option key on your keyboard (alt) right after the chime sound) and choose  the \"Windows\" CD. I know this sounds strange but for some odd reason the mac thinks it's windows. This will bring you to a Ubuntu-like desktop where you can check out Ubuntu or use some useful tools. Just start the installation. When you start the installation you will be led through the installation process. Somewhere early along the path you will be asked where to install Ubuntu. I chose install alongside Mac OS X and it worked fine for me!\nYou will then be guided through the installation. If you are not familiar with Ubuntu installations, I can assure you that this is pretty straightforward. You will be able to pick a username, password, computer name etc. I recommend you to install the third party audio software since Ubuntu can't provide Audio codecs itself. Installing updates will increase installation time of course, but since it's the first thing we will do after the installation, you might as well do it. After having finished the basic configuration feel free to look at the slideshow, play around Ubuntu a little bit or just leave the installation to itself. Check in every 15 to 20 minutes to see if everything is alright. The installation took about 20 minutes on my iMac after having entered the personal info. The usb stick method did not work for me, I was only able to install and boot Ubuntu properly with a CD/DVD. Try this workaround and let me know if it worked for you..\n", "Q: Sublime text - no shortcuts working on non-latin layout, 12.04 I have fresh ubuntu 12.04 and Sublime text 2 installation.

In Ubuntu the kernel will not be replaced by the new one. So even if the updater brings the 3.13 in your system (reportedly) the 3.12 kernel will still remain. \nYou have to know that GRUB boot-loader automatically lists the newest kernel first and this depends on the number/version/upload number/ of the kernel. \nSo 3.11 considered as older than 3.12 and except that will never be replaced, as it is newest it will be listed first in GRUB menu. \nAlthough from the version I can assume that you are using a mainline kernel, read here about mainline kernels.\n\nAnd is there any way to put software updater get me updates for\n  3.12.4?\n\nAs far as I know, no.

Since part of the current development emphasizes on more customizable networking and better addressability between entities across a Juju environment, your issue is considered a regression and is highly likely it will be fixed in the next stable Juju release (1.18.0).\nIn the mean time, you could manually or through the OpenStack command-line clients reproduce the suggested fix:\n\n\n*\n\n*Instead of 2 separate subnets with netmask /24, create them with mask /16.\n\n*This way with sufficiently recent OpenStack (likely at least Havana: see here) you could create a router, gateway, assign one to the other and make sure all of them fit in the same /16 netmask. This way you enable floating IP assignment with sequential exhaustion (pick the next available going over and translating to each subnet's IP address).\n\n*See also http://openstack.redhat.com/Running_an_instance_with_Neutron\n", "Q: No Dom0 in \"virsh list\" Basically I am trying to setup a cloud with Ubuntu 12.04, Eucalyptus and Xen.\nI have installed Xen. Now when I run xm list command, it shows Domain-0 is running. But when I try with virsh list, nothing is populated. Even virsh list --all does not produce any output.\nHow to solve this problem?\n\nA: I think with virsh you need to explicitly tell it where to connect to as well, so the correct command, given that the qemu instance you want to connect to is local, would be\nvirsh -c qemu:///system list --all\n\nor with xen, I guess it might be (unsure here)\nvirsh -c xen:/// list --all\n\nIt's likely possible to configure virsh to use this a the default location, I don't know if there's a reason the virsh package does not do that automatically.\n\nA: I have the same issue using the latest Ubuntu 14.04 with Libvirt 1.2.2.\nIf I run\nvirsh version\n\nI will have this\n\nCompiled against library: libvirt 1.2.2\n  Using library: libvirt 1.2.2\n  Using API: QEMU 1.2.2\n  Running hypervisor: QEMU 1.7.91\n\nI guess the problem is that libvirt connect to QEMU instead of xen.

Any solution will be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Here are two solutions that may work for you, the first tried to get your Ati graphics card working instead of having both running at same time:\nhttp://xpressrazor.wordpress.com/2013/01/13/how-to-setup-amdintel-hybrid-graphics-cards-in-linux-ubuntu/\n... and the second disables Ati completely and lets you use the Intel chipset on it's own:\nhttp://usernamepending.wordpress.com/2011/11/02/getting-back-some-battery-life-in-ubuntu-11-10-by-disabling-discrete-graphics/\n... also, running the latest version of Ubuntu is recommended for newer drivers and support, Xubuntu if you would like a simpler non-3D desktop...\n\nA: update this bios\nhttp://downloads.dell.com/bios/N5010A15.EXE\ntry cleaning up the vents, i have requested my friend at dell factory to check for any know issues in this model or solution for this issue.\nRegards,\nMohan\n", "Q: \"The following signatures were invalid: BADSIG 16126D3A3E5C1192\" I am new to ubuntu and I just installed it. when I tried to install git using \"apt-get install git\" I received error with \"unable to connect\".

Thus you'll want to match the internal setting to what you've set your router to listen and send via and your external one to how you want to display / hide the port to the rest of the world.\n\nInternal startport : [The beginning of the range that your home server will listen on- for a single port use the same number for both!]\nInternal endport : [The end of the range that your home server will listen on- for a single port use the same number for both!]\nExternal startport : [The beginning of the range that your router will listen on- for a single port use the same number for both!]\nExternal endport : [The end of the range that your router will listen on- for a single port use the same number for both!]\nProtocol : [TCP / UDP / Both Depending on what application you need to use, choose one!]\n\nThe settings below beginning with a time: enable / disable radio button can make the rule automatically turn on and off on a certain schedule.

I'm hoping if I give a description of my exact problem it might help:\nI recently got an ASUS 1015E laptop and for about the first week of using it the wireless connection worked perfectly fine. Eventually one day, I suddenly lost the wireless connection. I assumed it was a router problem or something like that, but the internet was still fine on other devices in my house using a wireless connection. After a reboot I regained the connection, but the same thing happened after about 10 minutes. When I lose the signal it keeps showing that it's trying to connect on the icon but it never does. Every 2 minutes or so it will ask for my wifi password again and it will already be entered in, so I just click Connect and it still can't seem to connect. If I click cancel to ignore the password prompt then it stops trying to connect and if I click on the network manager icon it says \"Wireless is disabled by hardware switch\". I have no hardware switch that disables wifi, but Fn + F2 will disable it. The thing is that I never did do Fn + F2, and when I do \"rfkill list all\" it shows:\n0: asus-wlan: Wireless LAN\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: no\n1: phy0: Wireless LAN\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: yes\n\nI've tried so many different solutions I can't even count them, and none of them work.\nSome of the solutions I've tried, based off of my terminal history:\n1. sudo rfkill unblock all\n2.

When a user backports a driver from a new kernel (as detailed here), does this backport need to be re-applied each time the kernel updates, e.g. if there was an automatic security update from kernel version 3.8.0-34-generic to 3.8.0-35-generic, would this break the user's backport? and thus require the user to reapply the backport?\n(hence if the backport was to make wifi work, the wifi could die after an automatic kernel upgrade)\n\nA: Yes, the backported driver needs to be recompiled for each successive kernel update. After rebooting into the newer kernel, the process is, roughly:\ncd ~/Desktop/backports-3.12-whatever\nmake clean\nmake defconfig-rtlwifi  <--or whichever driver suite you are building\nmake\nsudo make install\nsudo modprobe rtlwhichever\n\nOf course, adjust the process for your exact circumstances.

(I have these 4 in a command in \"startup applications\", with ; separating them, and that does work)\nWhy does synclient not work from shell script, but running those commands immediately after, does work?\n\nA: Is the script running from within an X server? If not you need to set the DISPLAY variable\nIs the hardware still initialising? You could try adding a sleep after the modprobe to make sure it is fully working before the rest of the commands run. (This probably isn't the case as the kernel should fully initialise the device before handing it back to usersspace)\nIs the modprobe command working? Try adding --first-time so that it reports if it's already loaded, also try replacing rmmod with modprobe -r (for your use rmmod should work but modprobe -r is the recommended tool)\nSorry these are mostly questions but I don't have enough kudos to add a comment\n\nA: You might want to run your script every time you \"plug in your touchpad\" - which includes resuming from suspend. To do that you should point to your script from the org.gnome.settings-daemon.peripherals.input-devices.hotplug-command configuration key. You could do that through dconf-editor for example, or by running the following command (once) from the shell (replace the text within the double quotes with the right path):\ndconf write /org/gnome/settings-daemon/peripherals/input-devices/hotplug-command \"/absolute/path/to/your/script\"\n\n", "Q: I made my partition too small I made a partition to install (20gig) and I'm realizing it's too small. Do I need to reformat and start over or is there a fix to this as I've already been using and love it. I hate to have to do over what Ive done but will if thats the best answer.\nWindows 7 64bit\n\nA: 20 gig is more sufficient for an Ubuntu installation.  If you need more space for a directory like /home, /opt, /srv or /var, you can move these to a new partition and mount it over the directory. \nIf you need more space for a Windows partion, you may be able to use a tool like partionmanager to resize the partition.  You will need to install the package before using it.  However, if you have a failed installation, you may want to delete and recreate the partition with the proper size. \nEDIT: There are lots of guides to adding a new partition to linux such as this one.  Moving /var is likely the best bet to move first. \nThe command apt-get clean should free up a fair bit of space fairly quickly.  It will remove the file used to install the packages.   Often apt-get autoclean will free up a fair bit of space by removing outdated package downloads.\n\nA: You can Use Gparted to resize your Partition. You can install it on Ubuntu from the \nSoftware-Center.

I'm running my computer using dual monitors. As when I am gaming I call my right monitor my \"primary\" and my left the \"secondary\" because I've set my PC up to where fullscreen games load on my right monitor, which is the way that I want it. But the default way wine works, my \"Secondary\"(left) monitor when I'm \"gaming\" is disabled by wine, which is something I extremely dislike and will not put up with.

I used to dual boot ubuntu and windows 7 before I decided to format my windows partition and install windows 8 instead.

However, the recommended repair fails with the message: \n\nYou have installed on sda5 a Linux version which is not EFI-compatible. It is probably incompatible with your computer. Please install an EFI-compatible system. For example, Linux-Secure-Remix-64bit and Ubuntu-64bit are EFI-compatible systems.\n\nSo it turns out that my  newly installed windows is 64-bit and with EFI while my installed ubuntu is not EFI compatible (so it must be 32-bit?). \nAfter reading around, it seems that this is actually the kind of thing that boot-repair should solve by default, yet I get that message.

Go to http://localhost:631/. This is the CUPS 1.7.2 site where you can manually register your printer. When you get to the site, click on the Printers tab; you may very well see your printer listed here, but it may not have been registered automatically. Weather you see it listed or not, click on the Administration tab and enter your printer information. (My printer was listed when I clicked on the Printer tab, and it was also recognized by Ubuntu, but it still would not print because it was not registered automatically.)

Every time I open a PDF, Document Viewer takes up the whole screen and then I press F11, Ctrl+Super+Up to maximize it instead. This is tedious.\nHow can I stop it from automatically entering full-screen mode?\n\nA: Converting Volodya's answer as a comment to a complete answer:\n\nYou probably changed Document Viewer's default settings by accident. This is an easy mistake to make, since the keyboard shortcut for doing so is the same as for opening a tab in your web browser, and you frequently type into the wrong window as a result of the lag in Unity's window switcher.\nTo correct the mistake:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Exit the full-screen view by pressing F11 or unchecking View ▸ Fullscreen.\n  \n*Save the current settings as default by pressing Ctrl+T or selecting Edit ▸ Save Current Settings as Default.\n\nThis won't affect documents you've opened previously until you reset the stored settings for those documents.\n\n\nA: You can also run the following command in the terminal to change the default setting:\ngsettings set org.gnome.Evince.Default fullscreen false\n\nIf you also want to have all windows maximized by default, additionally run the following command, replacing 1920, 1080 with your screen size:\ngsettings set org.gnome.Evince.Default window-ratio '(1920, 1080)'\n\nAfter the first launch of Evince after that, it rewrites that ratio to something else (that still works).\n(Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 with Evince 3.36.10.)\n", "Q: How to resolve \" The harddisk seems too small\" with Testdisk deeper search option I need to recover the NTFS partition that was removed by Ubuntu 13.10 installation after choosing \"replace Ubuntu 12.04 with 13.10\"\nBut I am getting this message\nDisk /dev/sda - 640 GB / 596 GiB - CHS 77825 255 63\n\nThe harddisk (640 GB / 596 GiB) seems too small!

Then we can change the partition characteristics in the screen above with left or right arrow keys to primary bootable, primary, logical, or extended.\nOn writing these changes to the drive (or much better an image of the drive!) the partition may then be recovered. If that is not possible you will get a warning Structure: Bad. on selecting.\n\nWarning: Whole partition recovery though often beneficial is nevertheless a potential additional risk to your data. It may lead to a completely messed up partition table which makes further recovery harder if not impossible. Therefore single file recovery is the preferable way to go before we try with partition recovery. Alternatively we can try to recover partitions on an image of the drive rather than on bare metal.\n\nIf all fails...\nThe old partition tables may be so much damaged that a partition recovery is no longer possible. Then we may try to recover single data files using PhotoRec which should also be installed with TestDisk .\nRecommended further reading\nThe makers of TestDisk and PhotoRec provide a very concise step by step guide on data recovery which is really recommended reading before we start.\n\n*\n\n*TestDisk Step By Step\n\n*PhotoRec Step By Step\n", "Q: How to copy and paste a file?

The best solution is to use a test machine to try 14.04 to see if you have issues and if not stick to 12.04, it is supported until 2017.

My miner consists of 3 Radeon R9 290x GPUs. From time to time one of them (not a specific one, it happens randomly) stops mining. Usually restarting cgminer (mining program) doesn't help, the only thing that helps is reboot. Next week I'm leaving for 8 days and I have nobody to do that for me so I thought of a script that would do that automatically. \nThe script would have to periodically verify if all GPUs are working and if not - reboot.\nI think temperature reading is the easiest thing to determine if all cards are working.

However, we tried to setup a apache2 server which did work. But the problem is that we can't configure apache and other configure files due the lack of permissions. I found a command for some days ago and gave myself access to \"/var/www\". But that's the only folder I got permissions to. I forgot what the command was and I can't use root because I don't know the password. I can't remember if I tried to setup any. I am the only user on the machine so I got admin permissions but need root. So what I need help with is to give myself access to the whole server. Mostly \"/etc/apache2\" but the whole server would be better. Anyways, how do I give myself permissions for this and how do I enable root? All sudo commands tells me this \"\nsudo: must be setuid root\".\n\nA: isn't sudo what you're looking for? In Ubuntu, when you want to get root privileges, you must run \"sudo command\"... or \"sudo su\" (there is also \"sudo -s\", and I think the difference is with environment variables, but I don't remember now) if you really want a root session. The password is your user password.\nTry to check the owner of the directories... If I remember correctly, in ubuntu, apache creates a user and group of his own, and that only has access to it's own directories.\nEDIT: I believe your only way to fix this is to boot with a Linux live disc and mount your Ubuntu file system there to fix the permissions and owner of the sudo binary (and maybe sudoers file). These commands should do it:\nsudo chown root:root /mnt/yourfs/usr/bin/sudo\nsudo chmod 4755 /mnt/yourfs/usr/bin/sudo\nsudo chown root:root /mnt/yourfs/etc/sudoers\nsudo chmod 440 /mnt/yourfs/etc/sudoers\n\nThe leading 4 in first chmod is to set the setuid special permission: http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19683-01/816-4883/secfile-69/index.html\n", "Q: USB mouse/keyboard stopped working ubuntu 12.04 lts 32 bit I have Logitech easy call desktop set.

Maybe it can help.\n\nThis is what the post gives as a solution:\n\nFor anyone interested, here's what I did: I looked at the logs\n  (specifically /var/logs/auth.log) and saw that an entry is made when\n  ever the password is checked and accepted. My log said:\nAug  7 14:10:57 mumble gnome-screensaver-dialog: gkr-pam: unlocked login keyring\n\nUltimately I found an application called \"Swatch\" which monitors a log\n  for you and will run a script when a string that you specify appears\n  in that log. Swatch requires a config file (.swatchrc), and mine looks\n  like this:\nwatchfor /unlocked login keyring/\n  exec /root/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/wakeServer\n\nwhere \"/unlocked login keyring/\" is the string to look for and \"exec\"\n  defines the script to run when it is found. My wakeServer script looks\n  like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#wake the server\nwakeonlan AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF\n\n#record info in the log file\nmyVar=\"woke server at login:\"\necho \"$myVar\">>/home/me/.serverWake.log\ndate>>/home/me/.serverWake.log\n\nwhere \"AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF\" is the MAC address of my server.\nSwatch will need to be entered as a start-up application (create an\n  entry in System | Preferences | Startup applications called\n  \"runSwatch\" and make the command \"swatch --tail-file /var/log/auth.log\n  --daemon\". (In Debian, only root can read logs So the start up command needs to be prefaced with \"sudo\" and swatch will need to be added to\n  the sudoers file without a password. In Ubuntu it appears non-root\n  users can read logs. There could be a security issue with granting\n  password-less access to swatch, but in my case it seems acceptable). \nSo far it has worked perfectly!\n\n\nA: .bashrc will be the place you want to use for that process.  .bashrc holds users' profile and all of configurations, and that's what system will read first thing when you log in, therefore that's where you want to put your codes for your customized scripts to run upon logging in.\nHere's an example from my codes that I use.

It kind of sucks that I had to bang my head against this issue for like 10 hours, but oh well.\n\nA: If you're dual-booting with Windows 8 or 8.1, you must disable the Fast Startup feature in Windows, as described here, among many other places. This feature turns a shutdown into a suspend-to-disk (hibernate), which leaves filesystems in an inconsistent state. This can result in an inability to mount the filesystem(s) in question from Linux, although I don't recall offhand if the \"IO charset iso8859-1\" error message is a possible symptom in Linux. (I suspect not, offhand, although I'm not positive of that.) Note that the Windows Fast Startup feature is not the same as a feature with the same or similar name in many EFIs, so disabling such a feature in your firmware is not adequate (or even necessary) to fix this issue.\nIn the short term (for a single boot), the EFI System Partition (ESP), which is mounted at /boot/efi, need not be mounted for most day-to-day activities. Thus, pressing S to skip mounting it should get Ubuntu to boot. This should enable more diagnostics and repair attempts. I recommend:\n\n\n*\n\n*Once you've booted, try mounting the filesystem manually, as in sudo mount /dev/sda1 /boot/efi. This may produce a more informative error message; or you can type dmesg | tail after a mount attempt to look for anything that might be recorded to the kernel ring buffer. Note that if you do get the partition to mount, you can unmount it with sudo umount /boot/efi if you want to try again (say, to try various options to figure out what's working and what's not working).\n\n*The /etc/fstab file contains entries that describe what to mount where and how to mount each filesystem. Try locating the entry for /boot/efi and do a Web search to learn more about this file. This won't help you per se, but you may discover a mount option that will fix the problem, in which case editing the /etc/fstab file may be in order.\n\n*In a worst-case scenario, backing up the ESP, umounting it, creating a fresh filesystem on it (via sudo mkdosfs -F 32 -n ESP /dev/sda1, re-mounting it, and restoring it may be necessary. A file-level backup (via cp, tar, or the like) should be adequate; but you may need to adjust the /etc/fstab file because the serial number (UUID= in /etc/fstab) will almost certainly change. Of course, you'll need to successfully mount the ESP in order to back it up.\n\n*It's conceivable that your kernel has been built incorrectly; or more likely, that your initial RAM disk (initrd) has been built incorrectly. This type of problem is difficult for most users to overcome, although Ubuntu's update-initramfs tool can help with the latter.\n\n", "Q: Connecting my ubuntu pc to tv and getting netflix to run full screen on the tv? When I connect my ubuntu pc to the tv, the screen is fully mirrored on the tv but when I run netflix it only fills up about 1/4th of the screen.

For clarification the whole screen is filled when browsing the internet.\n\nA: I think you can fix this by having Netflix closed, switching the main display in \"Displays\" to the tv, and then opening netflix.

Even though im not even near my traffic cap. :-)\n\nA: The \"SRC=A_LOT_OF_IP_ADDR\" are the IP you are wanting. IP addresses, mac as well, can change and be spoofed, so the information does not do much for you and certainly does not identify any specific individual(s) responsible for your woes. The traffic is being blocked by your firewall. The only course of action you might have is to complain to the ip provider(s) of the source IP. Often they will not do much.\n", "Q: Where do \"random numbers\" come from in Ubuntu? This Ars Technica article reveals the likelihood that CPU based random number generators \"RDRAND\" and \"Padlock\" have been crafted with NSA input to benefit NSA code cracking.\nDo the current Ubuntu distros utilize those routines on machines with Intel and VIA CPUs?  \nIf so, can those generators be bypassed by installing other code?\nA search on \"random number\" did not reveal either, and since privacy is important to many, I do believe this is of general interest and not an obscure issue.\n\nA: The source of random numbers in Ubuntu come from the Linux kernel, specifically /dev/random and /dev/urandom (pseudo-random).  The difference between the two is that /dev/random may be blocking while /dev/urandom does not but may not be as random.  \nThat aside, RdRand is just one of many sources of entropy used in the Linux kernel and as long as userspace applications don't use RdRand directly but make a system call to the kernel, there is no issue with Ubuntu's random output.\nHere is a link to Slashdot story where Linus explained why a petition removing RdRand from the kernel would be stupid\n\nA: Linux (Ubuntu or otherwise) can use many sources of entropy to generate random numbers, including the timing of hardware access such as key presses and mouse movements, as well as a hardware generator such as RdRand if available. Entropy is also saved from one boot to the next.\nIf done right (and Linux does it right — not perfect, but good enough to combat the threat of a backdoored hardware RNG), combining different sources of entropy can only make for better entropy, not worse. Indeed, it is expected that the sources of entropy are individually not good enough, and only their combination is. So even if RdRand is crippled and has less entropy than the hardware manufacturer pretends, this does not weaken Linux's random number generator.\nFor a more in-depth explanation, see Could RDRAND (Intel) compromise entropy?\nThere is an indirect threat which is that none of the sources of entropy are good enough. It isn't that RdRand is compromised in itself, but that a system might be counting on it as its sole good entropy source. This is especially likely on an embedded system which lacks other hardware that exhibits randomness. Feeding /dev/random entropy pool? has some suggestions of additional entropy sources.\n", "Q: no download for 13.04 raring ringtail I have 13.04 Raring Ringtail OS, installed from USB\nbut to install other vender software like google earth, it requests the installation CD/DVD, which I never had, but now need.

Maybe you could try to boot a live cd and browse your files, then copy to an external backup disk before reinstalling the system... if they were in a different partition than your system, this should probably work.\nIf, on the other hand, you had all in the same partition, AND there was damage to the partition (unlikely, I believe, as it was just an upgrade, which doesn't repartition your disk), maybe you should use something more specialized...

Anyway, you could still use a live ubuntu, but you would need to download specialized tools, and I don't know any.\nYou could also try recovering the system using the live cd, but I don't know how this works...

But none of the solutions works for me. Keep in mind I have NEVER touched Ubuntu before. I want to try out Ubuntu and get to know it.  \nHere is my problem.\nWhen I boot up Ubuntu from my USB device the option to install alongside windows 7 is gone.\nI have 2 drives in my computer. One 120GB SSD and one 1TB HDD.\nI want to install Ubuntu on my SSD where Windows 7 already is installed.\nI've read about Ubuntus limitations to 4 partitions, I only got 3 (my 1TB included) So it's only 2 partitions on my SSD. \nI've reduced my Primary partition on the SSD so Ubuntu can have 10GB. And I've kept those 10GB as \"unlocated space\". But still it won't detect the partition.  \nI tried some guys step by step guide, where he used a program named Gdisk.\nBut the terminal in Ubuntu won't recognize the command. \nSo what should I do now? Any advice?\nPlease remember that I have no experience with Linux at all, so giving me a lot of advance steps might not help. Just think of me as stupid if that helps :)\nThanks!\n\nA: I recently had a problem just like yours (I had Windows 8.1). Not showing the \"Install alongside Windows\" is probably because either you have too many partitions (4) or the disk you're trying to install on is a Dynamic disk (Not MBR), and my case was the latter. Since you say you haven't got all 4 partitions then I'm assuming (although I can't really tell, it would have been much better if you had put some screenshots) that your disk is a dynamic one. To check if that is true:\n1) Go into Windows 7\n2) Search for \"Create and format hard disk partitions\" in the start menu and open it\n3) After some waiting, the window will open and display all your disks and drives. At the bottom of the window you will see like \"Disk 0\" (see which one is the SSD drive) and under that it has either written \"Dynamic\" or \"Basic\"\n4) If the SSD you want to install Ubuntu was Dynamic, proceed:\n5) Using a software like AOMEI Partition Manager (Home edition) you can select that disk and convert it to a Basic one without loss of data. (I did that and my Windows still worked. However I had to delete one of my volumes which had normal files in it; I copied them elsewhere).\n6) After that, you can now run Ubuntu and you will probably see that option\nI hope this helps! \n", "Q: Using Ubuntu and Win7 on two drives I would like to dualboot.

WHen you specify a dev name with no number (e.g. /dev/sdb) that refers to the entire disk, not to a particular partition.

This is fairly common.\n\n    Sending keystrokes to a specific window uses a different API than simply typing to the active window. If you\n    specify 'xdotool type --window 12345 hello' xdotool will generate key events and send them directly to window\n    12345.  However, X11 servers will set a special flag on all events generated in this way (see\n    XEvent.xany.send_event in X11's manual). Many programs observe this flag and reject these events.\n\n    It is important to note that for key and mouse events, we only use XSendEvent when a specific window is\n    targeted. Otherwise, we use XTEST.\n\n    Some programs can be configured to accept events even if they are generated by xdotool. Seek the documentation\n    of your application for help.\n\n    Specific application notes (from the author's testing): * Firefox 3 seems to ignore all input when it does not\n    have focus.  * xterm can be configured while running with ctrl+leftclick, 'Allow SendEvents' * gnome-terminal\n    appears to accept generated input by default.\n\n", "Q: Boot to shell script I want to make a live usb boot just to execute a script with echo off.

Select few have slight changes so, I would like it to continue to boot just to test. The faster the better because I have ~250 to get through. So, essentially I'm asking if I can boot to run a shell script.\n\nA: I think that may work for you.\nFirst you could create Linux Live USB stick in persistent mode. Persistent means your changes are stored on the pendrive too, so you can modify the system as you need. Easiest way to do it is to simply install distro on pendrive. You should probably think about something like DSL (Damm Small Linux) if you care about time. \nThen you should modify the system to run your script right after booting. It can be achieved many ways e.g.\n\n\n*\n\n*calling your script from /etc/rc.local\n\n*using cron\n\n*using something like update-rc.d, depending on distro\n\n\nNote that you don't event need to run X server on startup, you will save some time disabling it. \nYour script should reboot the machine once finishes since you want to boot original system.\n\nSumming up, your walkthrough with this solution will look like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert pendrive to the port\n\n*Start machine\n\n*Choose to boot from USB\n\n*Wait until script finishes and reboots the machine\n\n*Remove pendrive and watch original system booting\n\n\nI assumed here that default order of booting on all machines is hard drive before USB. Otherwise you will have to remove pendrive before booting original OS and forget about point 3. \n", "Q: Regarding Ubuntu installation on Windows 7 64-bit I want to install Ubuntu 12.04.1 (desktop i386) on my HP laptop which already has Windows 7 installed on it. I have an Ubuntu setup file as ISO file in my USB. \nMy question is, if I install Ubuntu through USB or by copying it on Windows 7 and then installing Ubuntu, will any of the data stored in my hard disk is lost?... because I have 200GB of data which I don't want to lose. I want both Windows 7 and Ubuntu to run on my same laptop. Is this possible?\nMy laptop Configuration:\n    HP Pavilion g series\n    RAM - 4GB\n    Windows 7 OS - 64-BIT\n    IntelL Core i3 2330M CPU, 2.20GHz \nThanks for your quote. Well, my laptop hard disk capacity is 500GB, and currently my hard disk is holding around 275GB of data. Well, it's almost more than half.  So I think Ubuntu needs 20GB of free space. Now the thing is that I am having only one drive which is C drive, it's holding around 275GB of data, which includes the Windows setup, all other software installations, and also my personal important data which is around 92GB. All this is only in the C drive. I have two more drives which are of 15GB and 4GB. One is the recovery drive (D drive) and the other one is HP_Tools drive (E drive).\nIs it possible to make one more drive so that I will install Ubuntu on that drive? I mean is it possible to shrink it?\n\nA: Yes. It is completely possible. I am using both OS parallelly and I am not having any problem at all. My PC configuration is slightly better though. But I doubt it has anything to do with dual boot. Your laptop will run one OS at a time (so, chill). The only thing matters is, do you have enough hard disk space?\nNow, due to the new partition you create to install Ubuntu, no stored data should be lost. The space you allocate to Ubuntu, will simply come from the free spaces available in HDD. No existing data will be touched. I also have installed Ubuntu 12.04 on Win7 and after nearly a year now, it is still running smoothly and I haven't got any data missing.\nPersonal opinion: Keeping in mind the future, allocate some good amount of space (like 100GB at least) in you Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Tried to disable GUI now neither GUI or TEXT loads I am brand new to Ubuntu Server (or even having a server).

I then typed sudo apt-get remove lightdm and seemed to have made a mistake.\nThe machine now shows Ubuntu and the loading circles but does nothing.\nWhat have I done, and how do I get back to command line boot, with GUI option?\n\nA: You need to have root permissions to edit the grub file so it should alow you to write if you open with either:\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub \n\ngksu gedit /etc/default/grub\n\ndepending on whether you want a to do the editing in command line. You want to change\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nto\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"text\"\n\nthen save and go back to the terminal and run:\nsudo update-grub\n\nThen you can reboot to test:\nsudo reboot\n\n", "Q: How to sync my Dropbox files with a preferred local folder? I installed Dropbox using following commands \ncd ~ && wget -O - \"https://www.dropbox.com/download?plat=lnx.x86\" | tar xzf -\n\nThen I ran the demon with this command:\n~/.dropbox-dist/dropboxd\n\nNow I want to sync my Dropbox data with the /var/www local directory.\nIs it possible? \n\nA: According to their site https://www.dropbox.com/help/12/en you can't sync folders outside the Dropbox folder, but there is a workaround in Ubuntu\nTo get other folders synced into Dropbox you have to create a symbolic link from the target folder to the Dropbox folder \nFor example:\nln -sfn ~/Documents ~/Dropbox\n\n\nA: Dropbox currently does not support syncing folders outside the Dropbox folder, according to their web site.\nHowever you can achieve this by creating a symbolic link between the Dropbox folder and the other folder you want sync, using this command:\nsudo ln -s ~/Dropbox  **/path/to/another/folder**\n\nSo when you go inside /path/to/another/folder, you will be taken into ~/Dropbox\nMake sure the other folder is accessible after linking.\n\nA: My five cents:\nUsing a virtual machine it is quite easy\nFirst stop all the shares or uninstall dropbox.\nJust create virtual disk and mount it in /etc/fstab. \nMount it to the ~/Dropbox, i.e., /home/user/Dropbox/ . Like this \n/dev/sdb1    /home/blue/Dropbox/           ext4    defaults        0       2\n\n\nA: I have this setup on my laptop and often I edit the files on another computer and then test them on the laptop, takes 30 seconds for Dropbox to realize there are new files to sync, but works really great. \nI created a symbolic linc with var/www/ and /home/user/code/.\nrun this in a terminal to setup the link between your local files and var/www \nln -s /home/user/code /var/www/\n\nNow add /home/user/code to your dropbox folder. Then when you edit the files that are in /code via dropbox they will be changed also in /var/www/. \n\nA: I think this is the right command \nsudo ln -s /path/to/another/folder ~/Dropbox\nnot this \nsudo ln -s ~/Dropbox  /path/to/another/folder\nbecause he want to Dropbox this /var/www folder outside his server..  \n", "Q: Fan control for i5 in Lenovo T520 not working I have a Lenovo T520, which is annoyingly loud all the time. My CPU however doesn't do anything and the BIOS is set to \"balanced mode\". \nI tried to check, and the fan control is set to automatic, and even correctly tells the fan to run at low speeds or turn off:\nroot@xubuntu:~# cat /proc/acpi/ibm/fan \nstatus:     enabled\nspeed:      1974\nlevel:      auto\n\nroot@xubuntu:~# cat /proc/acpi/ibm/fan \nstatus:     enabled\nspeed:      0\nlevel:      auto\n\nHowever, my fan is ignoring that completely, running happily all the time on full speed despite having the ondemand governor set:\ntux@xubuntu:~$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor \nondemand\n\n\nA: A few things you can try:\n\n\n*\n\n*(source) Edit /etc/default/grub and add acpi_osi='Linux' to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT variable:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_osi='Linux'\"\n\nThen run sudo update-grub and reboot.\n\n*For tips on controlling a Lenovo's fan, have a look at this page. The thinkwiki webpage in general is always a great source of info for Linux on Lenovo machines. \n\n*There is a very nice utility called \"Simple ThinkPad Fan Control\" which allows you to fine tune the trigger temperatures that change the fan's speed.\n\n*If you are on a Dell machine (I know you are not, but someone else may read this), use the i8k module: \nsudo apt-get install i8kutils \nsudo modprobe i8k\nsudo i8kfan 0 1 \n\n\n*If you are dual booting with windows, check the fan settings there. I had a similar problem and the power settings in windows were making changes in the BIOS which then would affect my linux system as well. \n", "Q: Is there a Ubuntu Server Minimal CD?

Creating a partition with this configuration was suggested by boot-repair tool after I got the error you mentioned and I tried to fix it using such tool.\nI hope this helps! Good luck!\n\nA: It is a bug. If you are installing using a pendrive, just modify the filename grub-efi-amd64-signed_1.9~ubuntu12.04.4+1.99-21ubuntu3.10_amd.deb in directory /pool/main/g/grub2-signed/ by adding 64 at the end before .deb. It works 100%.\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/1633913\n\nA: I worked around this issue in Linux Mint 16 by running the following command before starting the install:\nsudo dpkg --remove-architecture i386\n\nIt's probably caused by installing both 32- and 64-bit versions of all packages, in case only one of them exists (or maybe to support heterogeneous clusters that have both 32-bit and 64-bit CPUs). In the case of grub-efi-amd64 (which is part of grub-efi-amd64-signed), both versions exist, but they declare conflicts with each other so that they can't both be installed on the same system.\n\nA: I had a same problem while installing Ubuntu 16.04 as well as while installing Mint.\nThe following steps fixed my problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu/Mint whichever you want (after the installation or in-between, you'll get this error).\n\n*Start o. with live boot.\n\n*Install boot repair.\n\n*Follow steps in that.\n\n\nThat's it. Restart your PC and remember to remove the bootable medium you used.\n\nA: Disable the \"Fast Boot\" and \"secure Boot\" options in Boot Options menu. Select Legacy Boot. Restart the installation process. Create a boot partition >1MB during installation. This solved the issue for me in UBUNTU 16.04 LTS installation.\nPartitions created:\n/boot       - 2048 MB\nswap        - 10000 MB\n/           - 50000 MB\n/home       - 100000 MB\nMarked remaining to be unused.\n", "Q: How to download SPE?

You must do the same in any program where you wish to store the content directly on the server.\nHowever, if the Ubuntu One client is configured to automatically subscribe to any folders on the server, then the data will be automatically synchronized back down to the local machine.

I've been using Ubuntu 12.10 alongside windows 8 and I installed it a long time back using a .iso file which is roughly 800mb in size. Can I delete it now ? Will it affect my PC?\nCan I do the same for 13.10?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Yes you can delete the .iso files. That will not affect the existing system anyway. But you may need it any later time for re-installation or repair. \nUnless there is acute crisis of disk space it is recommended to preserve the .iso file of the existing distro you are using.\n\nA: Yes you can, the ISO file is just a disc image used for creating Live CD's or bootable ~USB's for installation purposes, there is no need for it to sit on your desktop/usb.\n", "Q: Sudo command not found (su login not working) I had a system crash and now my Ubuntu runs into low-graphics mode.

When you try with full path, then of course you get the permission denied message. This problem with the directories is likely also the cause of your original problem with the low-graphics mode thing.\nSo please try \nls -ld /usr\nls -ld /usr/bin\n\nboth of these should report:\ndrwxr-xr-x\n\npermissions.

I have used ubuntu 13.10 for last month. I enjoyed using it, but it was very buggy and unstable. Every now and then I experienced random freezes, mishappens and various other bugs. Because of this reason, I installed ubuntu 12.04 just now. Even though I know, that 12.04 should be more stable, I miss various new features, one of them is unity tweak tool support.\nI would like to ask you about 13.04. Is it stable? Personally, I use computer for the following:\nbrowsing the internet\nwriting various documents\nreading\nstudying in general\nwatching films / listening to music (spotify)\nprogramming in c++, java(android), and java in general\nflashing custom android roms to my phone\nI would like to experience the good side of linux: stability, performance, customizability.\nI liked 13.10 because of customizability options, but stability was a dog.\nWhich one, if you were me, would you choose and why?\nThank you for your tips.\nEDIT: also I would like to ask about 14.04. I have heard that it is much more stable then 13.10 :)\n\nA: right now 14.04 is not yet complete. There's only a \"beta\" version. so if you try 14.04 now I think you'd find it even more buggy.\n...personally I think that 13.04 had less bugs than 13.10 but the thing is that its not supported anymore. ... and it's not as fast as 13.10 but I think it's less buggy\nYou can try installing and updating it.

You could use two dongles to connect your PC to two different Wifi signals (like 1 on your WiFi and the other on your neithbor's WiFi), but that's not what you asked.\nTherefore, you will have to use the most performant adapter you own.\nIn general, your USB WiFi dongle will have better results. You can monitor your wireless connection with the command : \niwlist scanning\n\nFirst, use this command while your are connected with the built-in chips. \nThen use it again with your USB adapter connected, when the built-in one is not used.\nChoose the most performant one. \n\nHow-to : read the iwlist scanning results\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the wlan section (wlan0 by default), that means \"WiFi\".\n\n*Cell 01 is the first signal recieved, Cell 02 is the second one, etc. \n\n*To have a \"human-readable\" name, check the ESSID line, for each Cell. That is the name your WiFi has, the same name you must clic on to connect with Ubuntu.\n\n*Once you have identified your signal section, check the Quality line, and mainly the Signal level line, expressed in Decibels (dBm)\n\n\n-> This is what we were looking for ! The signal strength in dBm represents the quality of your reception, thus the quality of your WiFi Adapter. \nIn dBm, the higher is better. Note that the dBm number is a NEGATIVE number, so -68 is higher than -91 (so : -68 dBm is a better quality than -91 dBm). \n\nAnother thing :  You will notice the Frequency line in the iwlist scanning results. If you leave near other people who also have a Wifi connection (your neightbors for example, or other people living in the same building, ...) and use the same Frequency as you do, you may want to change the frequency you are using. \nWhy ? Because using the same frequency as others can mess up your transmission, other WiFi acting like parasites to you, and you acting like a parasite to other's signal. \nYou can change easily the frequency of your WiFi by choosing another Channel or another Frequency in your Internet Box options (not sure of the english name for Internet Box... I mean the electronical device where your WiFi signal come from, the thing that's plugged into the wall in your house).\n", "Q: Is there a way to know the creation date of a folder? I can't find the creation date in the properties. Is there a way to know? I tried arranging the files by modification as to know which were created first but I don't know if it is in ascending or descending order.\n\nA: I don't think creation date is stored. There is a modification date associated with any file, which you can see by running ls -l in terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T should open it). But if you modify any file inside the directory, I believe this modification date is touched.\nEDIT: Here's a more precise answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14842195/how-to-get-file-creation-date-time-in-bash-debian.

How can I do it?\n\nA: It turns out my X session with dbus running has the following environment variable set, which is accessible from all terminal emulators in X:\nDBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS\n\nIt's contents (`echo $DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS) appear to denote the Unix socket used by Dbus.\nGetting banshee terminal commands to work in a virtual console has turned out to be a simple matter of sharing that value with the virtual terminal.\nTo automate it, I wrote the following simple script:\n$ cat get_dbus_addr.sh \n#!/bin/bash\n#Use this file for sharing the most recent DBus socket address \nFILE=\"/tmp/${USER}_DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS\" \n\nif [ ! -z \"$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS\" ]\nthen\n  echo $DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS > \"$FILE\"\nelse\n  export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=`cat \"$FILE\"`\nfi\n\nI source the script from the appropriate terminal config files (so that it gets sourced in both GUI and in the virtual console). Sourcing it in the GUI saves the value to the sharing file in /tmp and  sourcing it in a Virtual console (where the ENV variable isn't set) loads it.\n\nA: I take it all back-- tmux enables a number of terminals (or windows) to be accessed and controlled from a single terminal like screen.  I was able to banshee --next from a virtual console.  Very cool utility.\nUnfortunately, until they fix the known bug, no it is not possible because banshee uses DBus to get those commands from the command line to the player.  Best workaround would be to use CTRL-ALT-T instead of CTRL-ALT-F1.  Or at least that works for me on 12.04.\n", "Q: Synergy wont be installed Hello I'm new to linux and all that so I might have lots of questions.\nIf possible it would be cool to be directed to a site where all kinds of commands all the good things to know about linux and ubuntu is explained in a good way.\nHeres my question.\nwhen I'm trying to install synergy, it says:\n\"dpkg: fejl under behandling af synergy-1.4.15-Linux-i686.deb (--install):\n synergy:i386 1.4.15 (Multi-Arch: no) is not co-installable with synergy:amd64 1.3.8-1ubuntu1 (Multi-Arch: no) which is currently installed\nDer opstod fejl under behandlingen: \n synergy-1.4.15-Linux-i686.deb\nAll help is appreciated\n\nA: It's telling you that you already have another version installed.

My system is an IBM thinkpad T23 I am trying to install Ubuntu 13.10 and the computer stops running during \"configuring bcmwl-Kernel-source\". What should I do?\n\nA: Be sure your computer is always connected to power, when performing updates or installing systems. Doing CPU heavy stuff, while on battery will drain the battery in no-time.\nIf the PC dying on you is not the case, then please be more specific in your question. Like explaining exactly what you mean by \"stops running\".\n\nA: Just wait...

The servers handling the software packages for Ubuntu 10.10 have been shut down, so you can not install new software from the Software Center.\nMy best advise is to update your system with a fresh install of Ubuntu, either 12.04 (Long Term Support) or 13.10 (the current release).\n", "Q: How to disable right click in menus? i'm having troubles with the right click, because when i press in dolphin or in chrome to open some menu action, the right click open the menu and start the first action in that menu in the same click! i want to disable the right click not for open menus, just for click! or move the menu away of the click position...\n\nA: I don't think it's possible.

I'm using btrfs successfully and have luckily separate home and system partitions.\nUsing Ubuntu 13.10 and wanting to test 14.04, how can I do this using the btrfs file system?\nThe system has an EFI partition, but no extra boot partition. /boot is inside the system partition (/@/boot).\n\nA: Yes, you can. This is what I use at the very moment. The other cool thing is that you can bedup the partition after you have installed many similar OSes (like Ubuntu and Linux Mint) to conserve a lot of hard disk space.\nThe trick is to rename the default subvolumes: @ and @home into something unique to the distribution installation, e.g. @ -> @mint or @trusty and @home into @homemint or @hometrusty.\nThis can be done at any moment after the installation of the first system, before the installation of the second. The most error-safe way is to take a snapshot of the subvolumes, for instance like this:\n\n*\n\n*mount root subvolume of the system btrfs partition (assumed to be /dev/sda3) somewhere, e.g. to /mnt: sudo mount btrfs /dev/sda3 /mnt\n\n*Optional: list the already existing subvolumes - just check you don't create name conflicts in the following steps: sudo btrfs subvolume list /mnt\n\n*Clone the main @ subvolume: sudo btrfs subvolume snapshot /mnt/@ /mnt/@trusty\n\n*Clone the home. I strongly don't recommend sharing the whole home subvolume across different systems. (For shared documents create another subvolume, or even better a separate partition, link it with ~/Documents, ~/Desktop etc. and share that): sudo btrfs subvolume snapshot /mnt/@home /mnt/@trustyhome\n\n*Edit /mnt/@trusty/etc/fstab on the new root @trusty to reflect the change the @home -> @trustyhome subvolume (and @ -> @trusty, but that step is not strictly necessary, because by the time the system reads @trusty/etc/fstab it must have already assumed the correct subvolume for root).\n\n*Edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg: modify all lines that call the current kernel (they look like this: linux   /vmlinuz-3.16.0-50-generic.efi.signed root=UUID=9e571eab-4c88-4913-baa3-8d41d94f73d5 ro recovery nomodeset rootflags=subvol=@) and change the rootflags=subvol=@ into rootflags=subvol=@trusty, so the kernel knows what to boot. Rather miraculously this setting will be preserved when you do update-grub.\n\n*Reboot and do sudo mount and verify that the correct new subvolumes are used instead of @ and @home <- This is step is really important, otherwise you will loose your data\nAnd once you renamed the subvolumes, and made sure that system boots, and made sure that there is no @ and @home - install the next OS, with one modification: use a separate /boot partition (800MB should be enough). It helps if your partitions use GPT rather than MBR, which fortunately has became a norm. (To quickly tell if you are using GPT is to see if you boot with UEFI on the motherboard BIOS setup. UEFI works only with partitions set-up in GPT format.\nIf you don't set up the separate /boot partition - the system will not boot, but you can fix it if you follow the  @HullCityFan852 comment:\n\nIf you don't have a separate /boot partition then the reboot in Step 7\nwill fail and you will be left at the grub rescue prompt. At this\nprompt, type set prefix=($root)/@mint/boot/grub (replace @mint with\nthe path to your distro's subvolume) and then type insmod normal and\nfinally normal to load the Grub menu and boot your distro. Once\nbooted, type sudo update-grub && sudo grub-install to make the change\npermanent\n\nAt the partitioning dialog, use custom partitioning and install the system on the same partition as the first OS. Just be sure, that you tell the installer not to format that partition!\nAfter the installation you can set up chainloading the grubs, so you can select the grub from one installation as an entry on the other and vice versa (how? see What is the recommended way to chainload separate Ubuntu /boot partition).\nBy having separate /boot partitions I don't have to worry about one Linux messing grub for the other Linux during the automated kernel upgrade.\n", "Q: How to watch videos in UK from somewhere else?

I have installed vim using sudo apt-get install vim. But the downloaded files for these plug-ins need to be placed in ~/.vim folder. But there is no such folder. I've found a vim folder in /etc and also in /usr/share directories. Which one to use..??\n\nA: You can copy the plugins in the /etc/vim folder, if you want them to be available for all users:\nsudo cp -rv /route/to/nameoftheplugin /etc/vim/\n\nOr, if  you only need them for your use, just create the vim directory in your home:\nmkdir ~/.vim\n\nThen to open that folder, just type:\nnautilus ~/.vim\n\n\nA: Just create it,\nmkdir ~/.vim\n\nand then move the plug-in files to said folder.\n\nA: You need to create the .vim folder in your home folder. All plugins will go into the ~/.vim/plugins folder. Your personal initialization options will go into the ~/.vimrc file.\n\nA: The following worked for me:\nopen the vim editor and type :echo $VIMRUNTIME\nin my case it was /usr/share/vim/vim74\nGo to the plugin directory inside your runtime directory and copy your plugin file there.\nI've copied yaml.vim for YAML syntax highlighting. Works perfectly fine.\n\nA: The .vim folder can be found in your Home directory. The dot(.) at the beginning means the vim folder is hidden.

As of now I'm running Ubuntu 13.10 alongside Windows 7. I'm planing on upgrading  Windows 7 to Win8. After upgrading will Windows 8 delete my current installation of Ubuntu?\n\nA: Yes, Windows likes to be in the first partition because its fussy. You can partition your hard drive yourself with Gparted for example, install windows and reinstall the grub bootloader, but that’s messy and I would not be the best at explaining how that works unfortunately.\nBut to answer your question yes windows will attempt to overwrite Ubuntu.\nEdit\nAlthough if win7 is in the first partition it may not, sorry I didnt think about that in my first comment. I apologise. Do you have the win8 disc? if you do its no harm putting it in and testing, just don't agree to the format of course if it suggests it.\n", "Q: Kernel Panic - not syncing: A hardware or a software issue? When I try to start my PC I can hear the CPU fan spinning up then turning itself off before again spinning up, repeating itself. Nothing is visible on the screen. Disconnecting the power plug and pressing the power on button to flush the system of residual charge sometimes helps avoid this problem and about 1 in 5 times I am able to boot the system.\nOnce the system is running it usually crashes within 2-6 minutes. See attached image for error(s):\n\nIs this the sign of a faulty motherboard, as the PC has problems starting? Is there other hardware which could be failing?\nSide note: A few weeks ago, the problems were not too severe and the computer would only crash after an hour or two so I was able to do an upgrade, thinking this would help. Having tested my PC under Ubuntu 13.04 and after upgrading to 13.10 (currently installed) the problem still persists. I have also tried various kernels to no avail.\nThe issues exist even if I don't log in to graphical mode (Ctrl + Alt + F1). Any help is appreciated.\n\nA: After sequentially removing hardware components and checking the RAM thoroughly for errors (with Memtest86+), I found that if it was a hardware issue, it had to be either the Motherboard or CPU. I suspected it might have been a hardware issue, as the problem persisted after an Ubuntu upgrade. Since the PC had problems starting sometimes, I had a hunch it was the motherboard.\nI therefore purchased a new motherboard and installed it. My PC has been running for a few days now without a single crash. This has lead me to believe that the kernel panic was due to a faulty motherboard.\n", "Q: Repairing after \"mv /* ../\" After leaving my laptop with an open root shell on my desk (running ubuntu 13.10), some not so nice person bricked my system using \"mv /* ../\"\nIs there any easy way to fix this or am I better off saving what can be saved and reformatting?\n\nA: Now, I'm no expert on commands, but that seems to be a nasty one (why would you leave an open machine in root user anyway?).\nIf the files are still on the system (not likely) you should be able to just move them back. But since you are asking this I don't think they are.\nMy best bet, would be to reinstall the system.\nAnd tell yourself never to leave an oen ROOT system again. :P\n\nA: In most cases, it is actually relatively easy to undo a wrong move. The command mv /* ../ moves every non-hidden file at your top-level directory to the parent of your current working directory.\nIf you were logged in as root, then your current working directory is /root by default. In that case, the command mv /* ../ does not have any effect as it is effectively translated to mv /* /.\nSince you mentioned that \"your system is bricked\", I assume that you were unlucky and your current directory is not /root (or anything with the parent directory /). Let's say that you were in the directory /var/www. Now, this means that all files were moved to the directory /var/.\nSince none of the programs will start (libraries are not accessible, programs are broken too), I suggest to boot into a Live CD and proceed with recovery. In the following commands, replace $ROOT by the mountpoint of your Ubuntu installation (e.g. /media/Ubuntu).\nLet's see what is contained in the root directory:\n$ ls $ROOT\nbin\nboot\ndev\netc\nhome\ninitrd.img    # symlink to /boot/initrd.img-3.8.0-34-generic\nlib\nlib32\nlib64\nlost+found    # special directory for ext filesystems, cannot be moved\nmedia\nmnt\nopt\nproc\nroot\nrun\nsbin\nselinux\nsrv\nsys\ntmp\nusr\nvar\nvmlinuz    # symlink to boot/vmlinuz-3.8.0-34-generic\n\nThe glob pattern /* is expanded by the shell, so the command becomes something like:\nmv /bin /boot (stripped for saving space) /usr /var /vmlinuz  /var/\n\nIf /var/ did not contain any of the names from /, then you could simply move it back. Assuming that your current working directory is /var (cd /var), you can run:\nmv bin boot (stripped for saving space) usr var vmlinuz $ROOT/\n\nOr do it one-by-one:\nmv bin $ROOT/\nmv boot $ROOT/\n...\nmv var $ROOT/\nmv vmlinuz $ROOT/\n\nSpecial cases:\n\n\n*\n\n*When a directory in /var/ has the same name as a directory in /, then the directory is not moved. This is the case for /run/ and /var/run/.\n\n\nSpecial cases that are not applicable here, but mentioned for completeness:\n\n\n*\n\n*When a directory in /var/ has the same name as an item in / (directory, files, symlinks, etc.), then the item from / will be moved into the directory of /var/NAME. For example, if /NAME is a file or directory and /var/NAME/ is a directory, then /NAME will be moved to /var/NAME/NAME.\n\n*When /var/NAME is a file and /NAME is a file too, then /var/NAME is overwritten with /NAME. Recovery is not so easy here as you need forensics tools now.\n\n*When /var/NAME is a file and /NAME is a directory, then nothing will happen (and an error message is printed).\n\n\n\nNext time do not forget to lock your screen (Ctrl + Alt + L) and hint the \"not so nice guy\" that data loss is not a nice New Year present ;-)\n\nA: This will depend on which directory your root shell was left open in. The command mv /* ../ will move everything from the / folder to the parent folder of your current directory.\nNow, the main issue you will have is that no commands will work since /bin will now be  /home/bin (assuming your root shell's working directory was your $HOME). This can easily be solved by booting into a live session, mounting your local drive and moving the files back.\nYou can also try running /home/bin/ls /home. If that shows you folders like /usr and /etc, you know that your / files have been moved to /home` and you can get them back by running (from the open root shell):\n/home/bin/mv /home/{bin,boot,dev,etc,lib,lib32,lib64,media,mnt,opt,proc,root,run,sbin,srv,sys,tmp,usr,var} /\n\n", "Q: dual boot partitioning i have a netbook that shipped with a primary partition with windows on it and a hidden partition with operating system restore features. i wish to setup a dual boot windows and ubuntu but im concerned that the repartitioning of the primary hard drive will affect the hidden partition with the windows operating system restore. will the hidden partition be affected when setting up new partitions to allow dual boot.\n\nA: The hidden partition will not affected if you just shrink other partition (e.g. D:  or E:) to create a partition for Ubuntu it will fine.\n", "Q: md5 does not match with downloaded ubuntu-13.10-desktop-amd64 I downloaded ubuntu-13.10-desktop-amd64 two times and the md5 does not match.

Could anyone please provide me with a temporary solution using GParted or otherwise?\nThank you.\n\nA: This is not a software or configuration problem. It's a hardware problem, and nothing you can solve repartitioning your hard drive. The hard drive failing is /dev/sda, where the Ubuntu installation is in /dev/sda1, while the other partitions /dev/sda5 appear to be an unused partition. This secondary partition is not formatted.\nAbout using gparted in the damaged hard drive /dev/sda, I wouldn't recommend it, since it's not going to solve anything and it can make things much worse, accelerating the process.\nI suggest you use an external unit like an USB or DVD recorder to make a backup of all important information you want to keep because soon your disc is going to stop working completely and you'll have no access to the system at all. By the number of reallocated sectors I can tell you that more than 3712 MB (about 3,6 GB) have been damaged already, so the disc fail is quite serious.\nIf you can't install a new hard drive but you still want to be able to use your PC, I recommend you download an Ubuntu iso and make a bootable USB or DVD so you can boot in live mode. Not a perfect solution but at least you'll have still some use for the computer while you get a new hard drive.\n", "Q: How to remove desktop icons from terminal?

I've tried the options shown for D and Z drives, /dev/sr0, /media/myname etc.\nI've also had similar problems with Medal of Honour.\nCan anyone help?\n\nA: With Wine, you must enter BOTH discs before launching the installation, because Wine only reads what was already mounted when it started. It's the same reasoning when you change a program's configuration file (like .js, .ini, or whatever that's is not in the GUI options), it has to be restarted to apply the changes.\nSolution 1) Insert both discs then launch the installation.\nSolution 2) If you have only one disc-tray (or cd-drive), or if you don't want to restart the installation : \n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new directory somewhere (I'll name it DISC2 but you do what you want): \nmkdir ~/DISC2\n\n*Copy the CD's content into the new directory with drag-and-drop or commandline (replace /path/to/cd by the path to your mounted CD):\ncp -r /path/to/cd ~/DISC2\n\n*Under Wine, point the DISC-2 path to ~/DISC2 \n\nA: If you have 2 CDs, then copy each image/CD into a folder separately and name them 'a' and 'b' (for simplicity). After configuring your wine wrapper, install the game normally and select the setup file in 'a'. When the installer prompts you for the second CD, just change 'a' to 'b' and that should do.

I managed to install it on my computer but now I need to put my image editing software for my Canon EOS camera onto the computer. On running the .exe file I am informed that An error occurred while loading the archive. The software loaded fine onto my XP  -running laptop.\nI'm also getting the report listed below:\nzipinfo:  cannot find zipfile directory in one of /media/CanonEOS241W/setup.exe or\n      /media/CanonEOS241W/setup.exe.zip, and cannot find /media/CanonEOS241W/setup.exe.ZIP, period.\n\n\nA: You can't run windows executables directly inside ubuntu... instead, the system tries to open the file with a zip extractor, and that's why you get the error.\nYou should try to use an alternative image editing software native to Linux, like gimp, which you can find in you software center.\nOr, if you insist in using this specific software, you could try opening it with wine... first, you should install it from ubuntu software center too.

I have a new dedicated server, which I currently access with username and password over ssh. I have not yet set up an ssh key. I am just looking into it now.\nSo this is a new server with ubuntu freshly installed, is it normal that the /etc/ssh/ directory already has ssh_host_ecdsa_key and ssh_host_rsa_key files on it? I can also see.pub files for these as well.\nDoes this mean whoever set up the server can access it using those key files? I want to be the only person who can log in to my server.\nI am not an experienced linux user, still trying to learn.\nThanks\n\nA: The keys are generated automatically when you install the openssh-server.\nTo manually make a new set of keys, \nFirst, delete the old ssh host keys. On the server,\nsudo rm -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*\n\nThen make new keys\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server\n\nYou will see \n\nCreating SSH2 RSA key; this may take some time ...\n  Creating SSH2 DSA key; this may take some time ...\n  Restarting OpenBSD Secure Shell server: sshd.\n\nYour clients may get an message when they log in:\n\n@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\n  @    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @\n  @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\n  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!\n  Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!\n  It is also possible that the RSA host key has just been changed.\n...\n\nIf so, have the clients run\nssh-keygen -R hostname\n\nwhere hostname is the name of the server.\n\nA: As I understand it, you're renting the use of some hardware and associated utilities (power, network connectivity, perhaps backups). The hosting provider has physical access to your hardware. Therefore he can, at any time, read and even change your data. You have to trust them not to make use of that ability. The only alternative is doing the hosting yourself.\nIt is normal for hosting providers to provide a basic software installation including an SSH server (so you have a way to log in — depending on the service this may or may not be your only way to log in initially). The SSH server private key is generated automatically when the openssh-server package is installed, so it's normal that you find it already there when you look. The fact that the hosting provider triggered the key generation doesn't give them any extra access to your server. If you had some other way to log in and installed the openssh-server package manually, then you generated the key yourself even if you didn't realize it.\nThe SSH server key authenticates the server, not users. It doesn't allow users to log in. What allows users to log in is if their public key is listed in the file .ssh/authorized_keys in their home directory; it's always the party who has the private key who is authenticated, and the party who has the public key who does the authentication. The SSH server key pair allows you to be told if an attacker tries to make you log in to their server instead of yours, or tries to intercept the SSH connection between your client and your server. For more information, read up on public-key cryptography and how SSH uses it.\n", "Q: Trying to remove leftover GPT Data using Fixparts So i have a laptop that come with windows 8, like others i dislike it with passion, installed windows 7 over the top (i assumed it would atleast wipe the MBR properly but i dont think so anymore.\nanyway this is my partition setup (according to the MBR Table, this is how i set it up, this is all correct:)\nAnd so being the Ubuntu enthusiast I have a left over unallocated space at the end, I was going to install Ubuntu there with a dual boot, but parted, the partition manager in the Ubuntu setup reads that there is no compatible operating systems installed, hmm, so i searched around on google and on askubuntu, there's a lot of people having leftover GPT data.\nOn the Ubuntu live CD, I downloaded and launched fix parts, there was no warning message at the start, i was following this guide(http://www.rodsbooks.com/fixparts/), so at first i thought it may not be any GPT data\nUntil I got this up \n\nAccording to the guide I should have had a warning at the beginning, and being given the option to remove it. \nI have created a system image of my windows install onto an external HDD\n____________________________________________--\nI also tried using GPT disk, it was very complicated, took me a while to even get it open, and then I count copy the backup of my partition table (parts.txt) out of the system rescue CD as I new it would delete when I powered it down.\nSo, how can I remove this GPT data so that parted will see my windows install?\nOr should I try and convert it all to GPT data?\n\nAs requested, here are the outputs to the following commands\n\n\n\ngdisk doesnt seem to be in the package i have? or atleast the command is unknown\n\n\nThis is the problem i am getting at in the first place, i wish to install ubuntu (dual booted with windows 7) onto that unallocated space at the end of my drive\nBut the ubuntu installer (i read it uses parted) simply does not recognise the windows partition\n\n\nA: That's very odd; FixParts is presenting conflicting information -- the reference to a 0xEE partition indicates a GPT disk, which should cause FixParts to exit; but it's not exiting. Could you please post what FixParts shows when you type p at its menu, and also the output of sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda, sudo gdisk -l /dev/sda, and sudo parted /dev/sda print? (You can cut-and-paste this rather than post a screen shot, but please add four spaces to the start of each line to keep it properly formatted.) This information will help me figure out what's going on. (Incidentally, I'm the author of FixParts.)\n\nA: PROBLEM SOLVED\nSo i was making links as to my desktop and laptop, they have very similar specs, identical graphics and almost identical gpu, BUT DIFFERENT Bios, this got me thinking\nwent into notebook bios, made a admin password (not needed) and changed the mode to disable AHCI, im assuiming its now IDE, somehow its now detecting it lool\nby the way, to everyone out there, Windows remembers the mode and will not boot if you change it\nin order to make windows forget which mode you have follow this guide\nhttp://www.neowin.net/news/neowin-guide-how-to-change-from-ide-to-ahci-without-reinstalling-windows\nI highly recommend you keep ACHI, im going to attempt to change it back after, ahci has many advantages\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 left click not working after a while only left click of touchpad and usb mouse not working right mouse click works.....Hp Pavilion dv6000\n\nA: This is a bug found in Ubuntu.\nFirst open the terminal and type :  \n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:raof/aubergine\n  sudo apt-get update\n  sudo apt-get upgrade  \n\nOn completion of the update restart your computer and done!   \nAnother solution\nInstall the deb file from the following link.  \nFor x86 systems : http://ppa.launchpad.net/xorg-edgers/ppa/ubuntu/pool/main/x/xserver-xorg-input-evdev/xserver-xorg-input-evdev-udeb_2.7.0+git20120504.f28507e8-0ubuntu0sarvatt~precise_i386.udeb \nFor x64 systems : http://ppa.launchpad.net/xorg-edgers/ppa/ubuntu/pool/main/x/xserver-xorg-input-evdev/xserver-xorg-input-evdev-udeb_2.7.0+git20120504.f28507e8-0ubuntu0sarvatt~precise_amd64.udeb\n", "Q: My PC crashes on Ubuntu My Compaq PC with Ubuntu 12.04 used to work as it should when all of a sudden, the screen (along with the rest of the system) kept either freezing or crashing.\nBy freezing, the screen keeps stuck where it was. No mouse or keyboard shortcut can get it back to life.\nBy crashing, the screen shows a blur decomposition of whatever was showing before or, some other times, a black background with a whole pattern of short slopped lines on top (I describe as I am not allowed yet to put up images). No response neither to any shorcut keys.\nManual power off is needed before restarting. Sometimes then, the boot screen shows up distorted with vertically ligned-up whitw dots over the blue background (its a typical HP boot screen). The system won't start nor do nothing. Power off and unplugging is needed to be granted a new try. Sooner or later it restarts and boots normally.\nApparently random, looks though like it happens when massive resources are about to be used: at video/flash web sites (Chrome and Firefox), opening email manager (thunderbird), or just starting up.\nAll this happened sooo often with Ubuntu 12.04 and 13.10. Now I use a light Lubuntu and Midori as the browser, and it has happened just a couple of times in the past week. Which I can live with...\nAnybody got any idea of what the reason can be? Ubuntu vira? Too old (5 years-old) hardware? Too many partitions for dual boot with Windows Vista (which by the way stopped starting up before all this happened on Ubuntu)? Windows vira spread over partitions???\nThanks...\n\nA: I definitely think to have solved the issue. After a row of clean installs and upgrades, one out of the several former problems remainded alive. \nNow and then my PC would freeze: clear image of the screen but no response to any input device.\nAs it had a random appearance -though somehow connected with big, normally graphics-related CPU demands- and was even worse with Windows (no start up at all) I decided to stop thinking \"digital\" and going analog, just applied generous amounts of contact cleaner to CPU, RAM and anyother chip complex enough to show those tiny, thight to each other pins. They can as well stop conducting from micro-dust accumulation as falling into shortcut due toi humidity.\nIT WORKS! Some days after the cleaning (I usde CRC 2-26) and a series of really brutal stress test to my computer, it has never frozen again -may it work slower during the test, as natural.\nSo, for all of you getting sudden unexpected freezings, give up messing around with your O.S. beyond what's reasonable and do an exhaustive dust and contact cleaning.\n\nA: It sounds like the ISO you used to install Ubuntu may of been corrupted upon download.

As known, to run windows programs on wine we usually need to install additional components and stuff to make wine run it.\nI'm just thinking, why the pain? winetricks has a list of \"libraries\" (or whatever), each time I want to run something I need to install some, why not install them all?\nor maybe is there a set of instructions or some documentation or so that would tell me to install certain things in winetricks that would make wine run \"almost anything\" like windows does? Is there a way to \"get the best out of wine\"?\n\nA: For the winetricks which provide Windows libraries there is no reason not to, this will indeed make a lot of programs easier to run. But some of the other tricks are instead used to say install MS Office or another specific task, so unless you are installing Office they are useless. The other thing is the winetricks also often use DLLs which are not open source, which takes away from the point of wine as an open source compatibility layer. This is why they do not come as part of wine.\n", "Q: UEFI Dual-Boot - Ubuntu 12.04.3 + Windows 8.1 (One GPT HDD) UEFI Dual-Boot - Ubuntu 12.04.3 + Windows 8.1 (One GPT HDD)\nHello,\nI'm having trouble setting up a dual-boot (Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Windows 8.1) in my ASUS K55VM laptop's hard drive disk (500 GB).\nI was mostly following tutorials for doing this, but at some point something has gone wrong.\nUp to now, I have followed these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*I formatted my HDD into GPT.\n\n*I clean-installed Windows 8.1. I didn't prevent Windows from choosing the partitions to use and it created these partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*A Recovery partition (sda1).\n\n*An EFI System Partition (sda2).\n\n*A Microsoft Reserved Partition (sda3).\n\n*A Windows Data Partition or C drive (sda4).\n\n\n*I reduced the Windows Data Partition via Windows' Disk Management.\n\n*I made a bootable USB Stick with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS from ISO, using Universal USB Installer.\n\n*I created these partitions for Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*A Boot partition, mounted at /boot (sda5).\n\n*A Root partition, mounted at / (sda6).\n\n*A Swap partition (sda7).\n\n\n*In Device for boot loader installation I chose: /dev/sda.\n\n*Then, when I rebooted, it went straight into Ubuntu. So I installed Boot-Repair, and clicked on Recommended Repair. It automatically did its job without asking for anything.\n\n*I rebooted and Grub showed up, with a lot of options. At this point I had a decent dual-boot setup; Ubuntu and both Windows entries worked fine:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu.\n\n*Windows Boot UEFI Loader.\n\n*Windows UEFI bkpbootmgfw.efi.\n\n\n*I executed this command: sudo grub-install --force /dev/sda5.\n\n*Then I tried to make Windows 8.1's Boot Manager the main boot manager, so that I could choose which OS to boot into from a menu. I downloaded EasyBCD on Windows. It showed 2 Ubuntu entries and 1 Windows entry.\n\n*I went into BCD Deployment tab and clicked on Write MBR.\n\n*At this point, I went into BIOS and made Windows Boot Manager the first boot option.\n\n*When I rebooted, I got a black screen with the message efidisk read error, and then (I guess) it switched to the next boot option, which is Ubuntu, resulting in Grub showing up.\n\n*From Grub, Ubuntu entry is working and so are both Windows entries. If I choose Ubuntu, it normally boots into Ubuntu. But if I choose Windows, it goes into Windows' boot manager.\n\n*In Windows' boot manager, a menu shows up:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu.\n\n*Ubuntu.\n\n*Windows 8.1.\n\n\n*If I choose Windows, it boots into Windows without any problem.\n\n*If I choose Ubuntu, it boots into Grub (back to step 14).\nHere's my BootInfo Summary: http://paste.ubuntu.com/6698171/\nWindows Boot Manager is clearly not working as expected; I can't directly boot into it and I can't boot into it from BIOS either (efidisk read error again). If I want to boot into Windows I need to boot into Grub first, which is the opposite of what I wanted.\nI need help at this point. What is the best thing I can do? Is there a more reliable and/or simpler way of acomplishing a satisfying dual-boot for this situation? Can someone provide a way for going back to step 8, where I had a more efficient dual-boot setup? If only I could undo what I did with Easy BCD and skip Windows' Boot Menu... Can someone provide a way to fix this mess?\nThanks in advance and sorry for the length of this, I wanted to be exhaustive.\n\nA: Broadly speaking, you made two mistakes:\n\n\n*\n\n*The last I heard, EasyBCD is useless for managing a dual-boot installation on an EFI-based computer. Thus, by installing it you just started digging a hole for yourself.\n\n*You tried to apply BIOS-specific knowledge to an EFI-based computer. I know that almost everybody (including manufacturers) is calling EFIs \"BIOSes,\" but they aren't. An EFI boots in a fundamentally different way than a BIOS, so you really do need to read up on EFI boot methods and ignore all your BIOS-specific knowledge. Thinking of an EFI as a BIOS just creates confusion and causes mistakes. See the following sites for EFI-specific information:\n\n*\n\n*My page on installing Linux in EFI mode\n\n*My page on EFI boot loaders for Linux\n\n*The Ubuntu wiki on EFI-mode installations\nYou can recover your system from where you are now, but it might be simpler to start from scratch. To do so, follow your procedure through step #6; however, be sure that you boot the Linux installer itself in EFI mode. That should get you an EFI-mode installation of GRUB, which in theory should boot Windows without your having to run Boot Repair. If you have problems at this point, you can either run Boot Repair (which is klunky and often over-does things) or install my rEFInd boot manager. Do not install EasyBCD.\nAt this point in time, your best method of dealing with problems is to read and understand the technology; automated tools get things right sometimes, but they also often mess things up worse than they were before. (This isn't really a criticism of the automated tools; unfortunately, there's so much variability from one EFI to the next that it's impossible for automated tools to get things right all of the time.) If possible, test a tool on a USB flash drive without installing it to your hard disk. You can do this with rEFInd, but it's difficult to do a test installation of GRUB to a USB flash drive.\n\nA: Boot-Repair ran the 'buggy' UEFI. It should have asked you and you should have said no, until confirmed that your UEFI/BIOS only boots from Windows not from an ubuntu entry.\nTo undo & to rename files to their original names, you just need to tick the \"Restore EFI backups\" option of Boot-Repair.\nI think using EasyBCD just adds confusion with UEFI. You end up with too many boot managers. UEFI is a boot manager, grub is both a boot manager and a boot loader.  Use UEFI or one time boot key or use grub. \nCurrently with grub you need secure boot off as there is a bug with booting 8 from grub menu with secure boot on.\nSince with UEFI all systems install boot files into separate folders in the efi partition, there is not the issue of competing boot loaders all trying to use one MBR. \nAnd forcing grub into a PBR or partition boot sector makes grub less reliable and it may hve to be re-installed on grub updates as it has to use hard coded addresses for boot files or blocklists.\n", "Q: Enlightemnent, window content upside down I've installed Enlightenment with this commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:vase/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install enlightenment\n\n(Ubuntu 13.10 (Unity as default), amd64 with Enlightenment 0.18.0-alpha4)\nBut as I open my session with it, every window content is upside down:\n\n(And reversed & flipped with Gimp):\n\nAnd to click on buttons, I have to click where they are normally:\n\nI did the installation on a bootable USB key too (with Ubuntu installed on it) but I have the same result.\nthanks!\n\nA: I just waited and, after an update via the update manager, everything went right!\nIt updated to 0.18.2!\n", "Q: juju bootstrap fails on local environment - Could not install mongo service I'm attempting to use JuJu install for the first time.

This can be corrected by forcibly writing fresh data to the sector, but this requires manual intervention.\n\n*Sudden loss of power causes the drive to do an emergency head retract, which is more violent than a clean shutdown.

And the argument -m during import is not helping.\nI cannot find a way to tell zpool import to use a different path/id for the log devices. Any help and idea for fixing this problem will be much appreciated. What else can I do to recover this pool?\n(Here is the current output of gdisk -l for all disks: http://pastebin.com/bBec21WN)\n\nA: As everything was still intact and the only problem that prevented importing the pool was the wrong recognition of the partitions used for the log devices, the solution is to create temporary symbolic links under /dev/disk/by-id for the missing partitions.\nIn my case like this:\nln -sf ../../sda2 ata-Samsung_SSD_840_PRO_Series_S1ATNEAD707062H\nln -sf ../../sdb3 ata-Samsung_SSD_840_PRO_Series_S1ATNEAD707066K\n\nAfter that, in my case zpool import changed the old wrong IDs to new ones that are present now under Ubuntu 13.10 (each disk and partition has 2 IDs now), and I had to create symbolic links for these as well, like this:\nln -sf ../../sda2 wwn-0x50025385503e8531\nln -sf ../../sdb3 wwn-0x50025385503e8535\n\nAfter that zpool import automagically started to recognise the correct partitions.\nFor importing I ran the command:\nzpool import -f nestpool\n\nAnd the pool was imported. DO NOT FORGET to fix the temporary links! Also after a server restart the links will be recreated and fixed.\nIn my case zpool did recognise the correct partitions during import and no further action was necessary. Otherwise it is necessary to remove the ZIL devices and re-add them back, before anything else!\nDo not forget to run scrub and all should be back in place.\nA lesson learned for the future is that ZFS recognises the partition if it is the first partition on disk, this is for example the case when using full disks for ZFS. So try to use full disks or when possible only first partition on disks.\n", "Q: Slow wired internet speed Ubuntu 13.10 Just switched from WinXP to Ubuntu 13.10 and have extremely low net speed compared to what I had, (600kbs) to now (50kbs).

Chances are you've got a BIOS-mode GRUB installation with a hybrid MBR to tell the Mac's firmware to activate its BIOS (aka CSM or legacy) support. This is a poor way to do things because it's dangerous and it can create problems like the one you've encountered. I recommend you instead try an EFI-mode boot of Linux using another boot loader. If you're using a 3.3.0 or later kernel, you can do this directly by upgrading to rEFInd (a fork of rEFIt that I maintain; rEFIt has been abandoned for close to four years now):\n\n\n*\n\n*Install rEFInd in OS X. (Alternatively, you can test this from rEFInd on a USB flash drive or CD-R, although some Macs have problems booting these images. These images include all the necessary filesystem drivers, so you needn't install them for such a test.)\n\n*Install the EFI filesystem driver for whatever filesystem holds your kernel (normally ext4fs).\n\n*When you reboot, select one of your Linux kernels, press Insert or F2 twice, and add ro root=/dev/sda6. (It's probably /dev/sda6, given the information you posted; but if it's something else, change that appropriately.) When you press Enter, Linux should boot.\n\n*In Linux, run the mkrlconf.sh script that comes with rEFInd. Be sure to run it as root or by using sudo. This step creates a file called /boot/refind_linux.conf that holds kernel options, thus obviating the need to edit them, as in the previous step.\n\n\nThereafter, you should be able to boot Linux directly from rEFInd without using GRUB and without editing the boot options via F2/Insert. You may even want to replace your hybrid MBR with a standard protective MBR. (Don't do this if you're triple-booting with Windows, though.)\nYou can check out my page on EFI installations of Ubuntu on Macs for more on this topic; but that page is written for somebody doing a fresh installation. Thus, it covers much more than you need to do.\n", "Q: X-Star DP2710 Monitors not recognized I recently purchased two Korean IPS monitors, however, on plugging them in, all I was able to see was a flashing coloured screen, I've read elsewhere that this is related to EDID: \n$dmesg | grep edid \n[    2.700416] [drm:drm_edid_block_valid] *ERROR* EDID checksum is invalid, remainder is 128\n\nAfter some shinanigans, I switched to the nouveau drivers using the following instructions: \n\n\n*\n\n*sudo nvidia-settings --uninstall\n\n*sudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia*\n\n*sudo apt-get remove --purge xserver-xorg-video-nouveau xserver-xorg-video-nv\n\n*sudo apt-get install nvidia-common\n\n*sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-nouveau\n\n*sudo apt-get install --reinstall libgl1-mesa-glx libgl1-mesa-dri xserver-xorg-core\n\n*sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg\nSource: Ubuntu Wiki\nThey both work flawlessly for about ten minutes up to about 39 minutes so far (and let me tell you how glorious 5120x1440 is...)

The gear icon on the top right has turned red. why?\n\n\nA: This happens when there's an update/upgrade that will only be completed after you restart.\nThis generaly only applies to kernel updates or, of course, upgrading to an ubuntu major release.\n\nA: An update having been installed that requires a restart is one reason the icon will turn red. However, updates are generally installed via the Update Manager application, and it will also not give you an obvious way to quit, displaying a dialog with only a single Restart button in it, in the event of installing an update that requires a restart.\nHowever, the gear icon will also turn red, when there is a problem with an account you have configured in Online Accounts, such as Twitter. When this occurs, an Online accounts… item will also appear in the menu, when you open it.\n", "Q: Installing WLAN driver After 6 hours I've come close to give up on Ubuntu.\nI installed Ubuntu 12.04 on my desktop computer, but my WLAN won't work.

Its not a Linux issue, rather Ralink has not updated the drivers for this card since its release. These drivers work for the 2.6 kernel. you would need a patch to get them to build properly for the 3.8 kernel and above like we use today.\nI have the same card. I bought it cause it advertised linux support. Yeah, Samsung lies on the box to get sales too. I had to fight them over a printer with advertised Linux support. Finally they have updated their drivers to be worth something. Yeah, it supported linux... for a little while.

If you do, in fact, have an Nvidia card installed, it may be disabled by your hardware configuration options in EFI/BIOS.\n(for example, I have a ThinkPad W530 with both Intel and Nvidia cards in it. You can specify one or the other, or both where it dynamically switches between the two)\nIf you do have an Nvidia card, and the \"Additional Drivers\" section isn't listing it... it may be an unsupported model.\nIf you will report back your findings, I'll do what I can to help you. :)\n", "Q: I'd like some help installing and running Minecraft on Lubuntu 13.10 So, just today I installed Lubuntu 13.10 on my piece-of-crap laptop and I absolutely LOVE how fast it is.

I then right-clicked it, went to properties, made sure it was marked as executable, and then selected \"open with...\" but I didn't find Java 7 Runtime Environment nor anything Java-related.

If you are not sure which it is, launch GParted (included in the Live CD) and find out. It is usually a EXT4 Partition. Replace the XY with the drive letter, and partition number, for example: sudo mount /dev/sda5 /mnt.  \nsudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt\n\n\n*Now bind the directories that grub needs access to to detect other operating systems, like so:\nsudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev && sudo mount --bind /dev/pts /mnt/dev/pts && sudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc && sudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys\n\n\n*Now we jump into that using chroot.\nsudo chroot /mnt\n\n\n*Now install, check, and update grub.\nThis time you only need to add the drive letter (usually a) to replace X, for example: grub-install /dev/sda, grub-install –recheck /dev/sda.\ngrub-install /dev/sdX\ngrub-install --recheck /dev/sdX\nupdate-grub\n\n\n*Now grub is back, all that is left is to exit the chrooted system and unmount everything.\nexit && sudo umount /mnt/dev && sudo umount /mnt/dev/pts && sudo umount /mnt/proc && sudo umount /mnt/sys && sudo umount /mnt\n\n\n*Shut down and turn your computer back on, and you will be met with the default Grub2 screen.\nYou may want to update grub or re-install burg however you like it.\n", "Q: I need to compile backprots-20131206 into ath10k device driver I need to compile source code backports-20131206 into wireless AP device driver as ath10k\nI used \n   make clean\nmake defconfig-ath10k\nmake\n\nbut I found there are no ath.ko   mac80211.ko   ath9k.ko   ath10k_core.ko   rt2x00lib.ko\nrt2x00mmio.ko   rt2x00pci.ko   rt2800lib.ko   rt2800pci.ko\nThese are device driver for ath10k, how & where can I use the source code to compile\ninto ath10k for these device driver for wireless AP.\nThanks\n\nA: The compat-20131206 package compiles a driver ath10k_pci, not ath10k.

(Also, make sure the names of the files haven't changed for some reason, I don't suspect this one but have seen it happen before in a move).\nSecond, try doing \"chown root:root\" on the files your uploaded, seriously, don't ask me why but this sometimes does the trick even when it appears the files have the right permissions.\nFinally, download the files you uploaded to the server and check them on another computer to make sure that they weren't corrupted in the transfer.

The next phase is to scan for any wireless access\n  points with the command:\niwlist wlan0 scan\nFrom the output of the scan you should see a line (or lines) like:\nESSID: \"NETWORK_NAME\"\nWhere NETWORK_NAME is the name of an available wireless network.\nNow that you have your network name (and you know it's available) you\n  can connect to that network with the command:\niwconfig wlan0 essid NETWORK_NAME key WIRELESS_KEY\nWhere NETWORK_NAME is the name of the network you want to connect to\n  and WIRELESS_KEY is the security key for that network. NOTE: The\n  iwconfig command defaults to HEX values for wireless keys. If you need\n  to use ascii you have to prepend the \"s\" prefix to your key like so:\niwconfig wlan0 essid NETWORK_NAME key s:WIRELESS_KEY\nWith your connection made, you now have to get an IP address for your\n  machine using the dhclient command like:\ndhclient wlan0\n\nYou can also look at hostapd. \nHope this'll help.\n", "Q: Audacity isn't playing any sound and it makes 30 tracks instead of one When I play anything in audacity there is no sound. I uninstalled it but it didn't work. Before I installed it through the Ubuntu software center, so I reinstalled it this time using a command. Still no change. Also every time I record it makes 30 tracks instead of one.\n\nA: Audacity has sound settings.  \nOn the top left go to Edit Preferences Devices and in Devices choose which device you want your sound to play through.  \nClick OK and test to see if that solves your problem.  I'm using version 2.1.0 which you will find under Help and About Audacity at the top and that works.\n\nA: Okay for anyone else who has the same problem, No sound playing from almost anything, I figured out how to fix it. Instead of \"Speakrs\" being selected in the sound settings menu in the output tab I selected one of the USB devices. This fixed both audacity and Youtube not playing any sound. And the extra 29 tracks that Audacity was making was just A bug that was recently fixed (I guess).\n\nA: I have this issue too.

Apparently my CPU doesn't have 64-bit virtualisation support (I enabled CPU virtualisation in the bios but no joy). Apparently something changed in a certain version of VMWare and in my scenario I'm stuck. I am trying to find out if I can get back to the last version of VMWare that will support my hardware.\nAll versions of VMWare I've tried give me \"One or more of your processors does not have the necessary 64bit extensions to run VMware virtual machines.\"\nCan anyone help? If you're about to ask, it does need to be VMWare and not Virtual Box or other alternatives.\n\nA: My understanding is that in version 4 they dropped support for 32bit cpu's. While a 32bit operating system can still be used, it must be running on a 64bit cpu. The following information may not apply to since you said you are running a 32bit OS but didn't state if you had a 32bit cpu.\nThe links below are for workstation because Vmware posts more information about it, but player is built from workstation so often the same information applies.\nVMware Workstation 9 CPU requirements:\nhttp://pubs.vmware.com/workstation-9/index.jsp#com.vmware.ws.get_started.doc/GUID-BBD199AA-C346-4334-9F56-5A42F7328594.html\nAccording to this a 64bit cpu is required.\nVMware Workstation 6 (player 2 equivalent):\nwww.vmware.com/pdf/ws6_manual.pdf\nAccording to the workstation 6 document an x86 or x86-64 cpu can be used. So vmware player 2 should support 32bit cpus.\nVMware Workstation 7 (player 3 equivalent?):\nwww.vmware.com/pdf/ws71_manual.pdf\nAccording to the workstation 7 document some x86 cpus are still supported like the Intel Pentium 4 models that support PAE, however older ones like pentium III are not any longer.\nVMware Workstation 8 (player 4 equivalent?):\nwww.vmware.com/pdf/ws80-getting-started.pdf\nAccording to the workstation 8 document a 64bit cpu is required.\nIf you have 32bit cpu I would suggest installing VMware Player 3 and if it doesn't work then I guess you will be stuck with version 2. If you have a 64bit cpu but are experiencing issues I would suggest trying version 4 and working your way up.\n\nA: Did you download the 32 bit version from here? That link contains the most up-to-date version currently available.\n", "Q: Creating DSL connection from terminal I am using Ubuntu 12.04. I use DSL connection and I configured it using the most common approach, using the network manager in the upper panel. But recently I am facing problem.

If connection is dropped while using, sometimes I can't connect it again unless restarting the PC. So I thought of configuring it raw using terminal.

I am using ubuntu 13.10.I cant able to use backspace in terminal. While using backspace it just passed through the letters.Please help me...\n\nA: You can change this behavior by editing the terminal profile.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go Profile Preferences, either by: \nRight-clicking in the terminal window and choosing Profiles >> Profiles Preferences\nOr from the menu: Edit >> Profile Preferences\n\n*Go the the compatibility tab\n\n*Find Backspace key generates\n\n*Select ASCII DEL\n\n\nThis should solve your problem.\n\nA: If by \"passed through the letters\" you mean the cursor goes back over top of the previous character without removing it, then your computer simply can't render the terminal properly. If you type a letter after that, it should replace the letter it was hovering over.\nThe problem should be resolved by closing (or logging out) of the terminal and opening (or logging back in to) the terminal.\nThe only other option I can think of is somehow your keyboard layout is incorrect and thinks that the backspace key is the left arrow key.\n\nA: The cursor has got 2 states. One looks like a box and the other is an under score. It seems the current state of yours is the box. Simply press the Ins key (Insert key) in your keyboard and the cursor transforms into a line. It should work as normal.   \nP.S: The Insert key is a keyboard key located on the majority of all computers that allows text to be inserted. When insert is enabled, the text inserted in a document will not overwrite any other text. However, when disabled, text will be overwritten.\n", "Q: How to remove temp installation packages Not very well versed with Ubuntu. I got this message when I tried to get some updates: \nThe upgrade needs a total of 31.9 M free space on disk '/boot'. \nPlease free at least an additional 27.6 M of disk space on '/boot'. \nEmpty your trash and remove temporary packages of former installations using 'sudo apt-get clean'.\n\nWhen I'm trying to run 'sudo apt-get clean', it says command not found. How do I remove temp packages?\n\nA: I'm not sure why sudo apt-get clean isn't found for you, but one way to clear up some space is to run sudo apt-get autoremove, which can remove packages that aren't used by any other packages (such as a package installed with another package as a dependency but the package that depended on it is no longer installed, sorry if that didn't make much sense).\nOne other way to clear up space is to just restart your computer. That will (if I remember correctly) clear out your entire /tmp directory, which stores temporary files.\nIf the program that spits out the not found error is sudo and not apt, then you would have a much more serious issue on your hands, and the only way I can think of to restore Aptitude (more commonly known as apt or apt-get) is to reinstall Ubuntu.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I think you have some problems with your installation or you have install your OS in some way i am not familiar with, since it shouldn't show \" command not found\" error. Also in your error message  it shouldn't be showing \" on /boot\".\nLeaving aside, try\n\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nit will remove any unused packages from your system.\n", "Q: Replace OS to expand Ubuntu partition I have a question (duh, but anyways).\nOn my computer, I have 3 OSes installed; Windows 7, Ubuntu 12.10 and CrunchBang 11 (based on Debian). I've been having some trouble with CrunchBang, and frankly, I'm done messing around with distributions that don't work properly.\nOriginally, I had installed Zorin OS 6 (based off Ubuntu 12.04 LTS) alongside my Windows installation, with 2 GB swap. I later installed Ubuntu 12.10 alongside all three of those, on a 15 GB partition, for testing purposes. As time went on, I started liking Ubuntu 12.10 more and more, but my disk space was limiting me.\nThe way Ubuntu installed itself was kind of weird. Instead of tacking itself on the end of the hard drive, it was put in the middle, right in between Windows and Zorin OS.\nRecently, I replaced Zorin OS with CrunchBang, having thought that it was a great OS based on my experiences with the Live USB, but I've had a lot of problems with it freezing and crashing a lot, and it's getting a bit old having to reboot multiple times just to get CrunchBang to work.\nSo what I want to do is expand my Ubuntu installation into CrunchBang's partition, essentially erasing CrunchBang and merging the two partitions. Can I do this without reinstalling Ubuntu or without a lot of rebooting, and would it be as simple as removing the CrunchBang partition and just expanding Ubuntu? Here's how my hard drive is laid out:\n/dev/sda1 (Diagnostics, NTFS, 15.00 GB) is Windows recovery.\n/dev/sda2 (Bootable, NTFS, 100 MB) is GRUB (I think?).\n/dev/sda3 (NTFS, 198.56 GB) is Windows 7.\n/dev/sda4 (Extended, covering a total of 84.43 GB) is the parent of the following Linux partitions:\n/dev/sda7 (EXT4, 14.48 GB) is Ubuntu.\n/dev/sda5 (EXT4, 68.22 GB) is CrunchBang.\n/dev/sda6 (linux-swap, 1.73 GB) is swap space.\nSo to make my question a little more technical, can I just erase sda5 and resize sda7 to take up the space sda5 previously occupied?\nAlso, GRUB is currently controlled by CrunchBang. What would be the commands to transfer control of GRUB back over to Ubuntu?\nThanks in advance,\nSil\n\nA: Yes, via a Live USB of Ubuntu you can use GParted to resize your partitions. There's a good tutorial located here:\nNote: Make sure you backup any important information before making changes! Also, don't resize/move over your Ubuntu boot partition and when resizing, you can only expand into continuous unallocated space. \nYou need to reinstall grub-bootloader , follow this guide to reinstall grub. It will replace previous crunchbang grub. \n", "Q: How to remap an unknown key I'm using a standard QWERTY keyboard not that really matters, just That I just a few extra keys I don't use.

I'm pretty new to Linux, but over the past few days I've taken it upon myself to give it a shot. I'm trying a few different distributions just to kind of get a feel for different versions, and this is the only thing that's really got me hung up.  \nI started with Windows 7, then I installed Ubuntu 13.10 (which works perfectly), and then I installed Linux Mint. However, I don't have a way to boot Linux Mint, and that's what I'd like to accomplish. My goal is to have a Linux Mint menu entry on the Grub2 menu that appears on startup to goes along with the Ubuntu and Windows 7 menu entries (and a few others that I have yet to use, like the Advanced Ubuntu Options submenu, and the memtest menu entry). \n\nIn case any of this information is needed, here's some information from the GParted partition table, as well as parts of the bootinfoscript output:\nPartitions info and descriptions taken from GParted:\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda1 is a 101.94 MiB primary partition with fat16 file system with a flag of \"diag\"\n\n*/dev/sda2 is a 11.29 GiB primary partition with ntfs file system with a flag of \"boot\" and a label of \"RECOVERY.\" According to /boot/grub/grub.cfg, this is where the Windows 7 loader resides. I have no issues booting into Windows 7 from the current Grub2 menu. \n\n*/dev/sda3 is a 275.12 GiB primary partition with ntfs file system with a label of \"OS.\" This partition holds all of my files that were originally made on Windows, though some have been saved over using Ubuntu programs (nothing went wrong editing files across operating systems so far but let me know if this is bad for whatever reason). \n\n*/dev/sda4 is a 171.01 GiB extended partition. This partition is currently mounted. This contains the swap partition, in addition to logical partitions for the Ubuntu 13.10 and Linux Mint 16:\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda5 is a 58.79 GiB logical partition with ext4 file system, which contains the installation of Linux Mint 16. In GParted, it says the mount point for this file system is /. This is the only partition that has a non-empty mount point entry. I don't know what to make of that, and I also currently do not know of a way to boot Linux Mint 16 as it currently resides. \n\n*/dev/sda6 is a 19.56 GiB partition (I believe it's considered primary?) with \"linux-swap\" file system. This was created automatically when I installed Ubuntu, but I increased its size manually by about 10 GB when I was having a few issues trying to install Linux Mint 16. Linux Mint 16 is currently successfully installed as far as I can tell, but I don't know how to boot into it like I said before. This partition is currently mounted. \n\n*/dev/sda7 is a 36.41 GiB logical partition with ext4 file system, which contains Ubuntu 13.10. Ubuntu 13.10 works quite well, and it's what I'm currently writing this question in. This partition is currently mounted. \n\n\n\nHere is the bootinfoscript output (it's quite long, and includes the grub.cfg file as well as the sudo fdisk -l info already posted here - some had to be omitted due to character limitations, however):\n                  Boot Info Script 0.61      [1 April 2012]\n\n\n============================= Boot Info Summary: ===============================\n\n

If the right way to go about booting Linux Mint from the Grub2 menu is to just add a menuentry block for Linux Mint, then I'd like to know how to do this. If there's a better way to get each of these operating systems to have an option to be booted on startup, let me know that as well! \nI saw a somewhat similar question here but it seemed a little bit different since that user didn't have two operating system partitions contained within the same extended partition, and I didn't want to just be shooting in the dark and possibly break something important by accident. \nIf any more information is needed that I haven't given here, I'll be keeping a close eye on this so let me know right away and I'll do my best to provide you with whatever info you need. \nThank you very much for any help!\n\nA: You could try update-grub to see if that will detect Linux Mint. This should check to see what operating systems are installed.\nAlternatively, you could try booting off the live USB (or LiveCD) and running grub-install /dev/sda with the hard drive mounted. This will reinstall GRUB and should check for other operating systems again.\n", "Q: How can I get the bash $RANDOM in a makefile? This works on OSX:\nRANDOM := $(shell /bin/bash -c \"echo $$RANDOM\")\n\ntest:\n    echo $(RANDOM)\n\nFor cross platform random numbers I've instead resorted to this:\nRANDOM := $(shell od -An -N2 -i /dev/random | tr -d ' ')\n\nHow can I get the first example to work?\n\nA: The reason your first line works on OSX and not Ubuntu, is likely because sh is bash on OSX. $$RANDOM is already expanded by the time the bash -c gets around to executing it, since you used \"\" quotes. So you probably want this:\nRANDOM := $(shell bash -c 'echo $$RANDOM')\n\nPersonally I'd probably go with awk.

Unfortunately, this is the maximum number of sessions per network connection, not the maximum number for a specific user.  \nOne thing you can do is set UsePAM yes in /etc/ssh/sshd_config, then configure PAM to handle the user limits by enabling the PAM module pam_limits.so.  If you only want the limits to apply to ssh sessions, add the following line to /etc/pam.d/sshd:  \nsession required pam_limits.so\n\nI'm pretty sure all of the above stuff is the default configuration, now comes the part that actually sets the limit.  pam_limits.so pulls its limits from /etc/security/limits.conf.  If you want a user to only be able to have one active session at a time, just add the following line to that file:\nuser    hard    maxlogins    1\n\nOnce this is set up, on any log in attempt when there's already an active session, the user will get the error Too many logins for 'user'.  To make this apply to all users, use * for the user.  You can also have it apply to certain groups, for instance, use @users to apply to rule to everyone in the users group.\n", "Q: How to manually add OS in GRUB?

I currently have the settings as follows:\nRepeat Keys:\nDelay: SHORT (all the way to the left)\nSpeed: FAST (all the way to the right)\n\nThis works okay in the sense that if I press a key, it will after a few seconds, repeat quickly. The problem is, the initial keypress. If I press and hold a key, I want there to be NO delay and it to immediately start repeating the key quickly! The delay seems to be only relevant to the keypresses following the original keypress.\nHow do I get my keypress repeat to be very fast from the very first keypress?\n\nA: \nThis is easy with dconf editor. (To install run sudo apt-get install dconf-tools). Open dconf editor and navigate to:\norg>gnome>settings-daemon>peripherals>keyboard\n\nThe location for keyboard delay has been updated to:\n\norg>gnome>desktop>peripherals>keyboard\n\nChanging the delay to 200ms worked well for me.\n\nA: This is easy with dconf editor. (To install run sudo apt-get install dconf-tools). Open dconf editor and navigate to:\norg>gnome>settings-daemon>peripherals>keyboard\nHere the \"delay\" can be set in miliseconds. Do not set zero, I just had a little play and 10 ms it is impossible to type without getting 2-3 letters. Play around with this number (it updates instantly once you have entered the new number.

When using an external keyboard with track-point, I observed the following unexpected behavior: when scrolling (pressing and holding the middle mouse button and moving the track-point), the text I had selected last is being pasted. But this should only happen when clicking (not holding) the middle mouse button. The interesting thing is that this is only happening on the external keyboard, the the keyboard of the laptop is behaving correctly. Furthermore, this is only happening when the track-point is used shortly after pressing the middle mouse button, it is not pasting when I wait for at least a second.\nGoogling didn't bring up anything. Are there any similar experiences or a workaround I missed?\nOne acceptable workaround for me would be to disable the middle-button-paste on the external keyboard only, so that I can still use an external mouse to do the pasting. I only found a way to disable this feature completely on all devices, but I use this pasting feature quite and often so I cannot live without it. \n\nA: Use xinput list to find the device you want to disable the button on:\n$ xinput list\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                          id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Logitech USB-PS/2 Optical Mouse           id=8    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎣ Virtual core keyboard                         id=3    [master keyboard (2)]\n    ↳ Virtual core XTEST keyboard               id=5    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                              id=6    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                              id=7    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ AT Translated Set 2 keyboard              id=9    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n\nI'll try this on my mouse. Next step is to get the current button map:\n$ xinput get-button-map 'Logitech USB-PS/2 Optical Mouse'\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 \n\nTurns out my mouse is mapped in a very straightforward way: physical button 1 is logical button 1, etc. This is the default; you may see something different if you've selected left-handed mode for example.\nAnyway, the middle button is mouse button 2. To disable it, you set whichever one shows 2 to 0 (disabled) instead. (Hopefully, when you're scrolling, its generating button 4 or 5 clicks, depending on if you're scrolling up or down. That's the normal way for a scroll wheel to work.)\n$ xinput set-button-map 'Logitech USB-PS/2 Optical Mouse' 1 0 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\n\nMiddle-clicking will now be entirely ignored on that one device. To change it back, just run that command again, but with the 2 back in its place.

Over time I have installed applications that offer or require an interface runs through the browser on localhost (for example, Transmission web interface, StackApplet configuration, Veracity web interface). I also develop software that I test via localhost.\nOf course, all these applications must run on different ports, and if there happen to be conflicts it is up to me to resolve them by configuring the application in question. But I have no localhost \"manager\" that I could use to:\n\n\n*\n\n*require applications register themselves against (e.g. for port allocation)\n\n*record port allocations (if the underlying application doesn't have the functionality to register itself)\n\n*start/stop the web services\n\n*control port access from other machines on the network/Internet\n\n*other things I haven't thought of ;)\n\n\nAs more end-user-style applications offer web interfaces, it looks like I'll end up running a little multi-application web server for myself. How can I (easily) manage this?\n\nA: Juju would be good for this for one major reason, with the local provider each of those applications would be in their own separate LXC container, so they could be isolated amongst themselves. \nJuju would handle the management of those services (the starting and the stopping) and the port registration. Most charms allow you to set a config option for which port to listen to so you could keep those nice and managed. \nThe other plus would be the ability to then push those applications to another machine/cloud when you're done developing them. \nA minus would be overhead, do you really need an entire container for your torrent web interface?, etc. But on the other hand if they all share one mysql instance then that might make more sense. \nControl port access to other machines on the network would be tricky, the local provider is kind of designed for you to develop these apps from your local machine, and not so much to have other machines on the network access these services, however if you know how to configure LXC networking properly you should be able to do this.

Also number of computers are connected to this server, which is used as internet gateway/router. The question is whether it's possible to configure iptables to prioritize traffic from eth1(lan if) over local traffic generated by server? Something like QOS..\n\nA: There are several alternatives to achieve what you are looking for. But first of all, yes it is possible. Though, many of the possibilities are rather complex. \nOne of the easiest options might be to run the torrent daemon under a own user\\group. Then use iptables to mark all traffic from that user\\group with a flag. Then later let the tc filter on that flag and put it in the low priority queue. Look at the bottom of this wiki for an idea. \nFor what you are asking do you only need two queues(fig 1.), one low priority and one high. Though it might be better to stick with something closer to this example.\nYou can adopt the example to your needs, just drop the part with nat and make the default mark lower value than the mark you will use for the traffic generated by the daemon.\nSo for my suggestion you can use something like iptables -A OUTPUT -t mangle -m owner --uid-owner ZZZZ -j MARK --set-mark 6 ZZZZ is the user identificator.\nAn alternative for setting a flag might be to use iptables -A OUTPUT -t mangle -m owner --uid-owner ZZZZ -j CLASSIFY --set-class X:Y where X and Y is the class identifier, and ZZZZ is the user identificator.\nFig 1:\n+---------+\n| root 1: |\n+---------+\n     |\n+------------+\n| class 1:1  |\n+------------+\n  |      |    \n+----+ +----+ \n|1:10| |1:11| \n+----+ +----+\n\nThe best might be to have a leaf for every fw mark. But my best advice now is, read and try to understand the example referred above to adopt it to your needs. If you have any questions add them.\nIn the example referred above, is it important that you understand this part (fig 2.) when you want to write iptables rules for marking or classifying traffic. For a short explanation of it with a slightly different looking diagram have a look at this.\nFig 2:\nFirst you have to understand how packet traverse the filters with iptables:\n\n        +------------+                +---------+               +-------------+\nPacket -| PREROUTING |--- routing-----| FORWARD |-------+-------| POSTROUTING |- Packets\ninput   +------------+    decision    +---------+       |       +-------------+    out\n                             |                          |\n                        +-------+                    +--------+   \n                        | INPUT |---- Local process -| OUTPUT |\n                        +-------+                    +--------+\n\nThis will point you in the right direction:\nRules, Guidelines and Approaches\nLinux Advanced Routing & Traffic Control HOWTO: Rate limiting a single host or netmask\nA Traffic Control Journey: Real World Scenarios\nIptables Tutorial 1.2.2\n\nA: Quality of service is quite a complex topic -- the link posted by @anders-f-u-kiaer is possibly the best solution, but quite complex.  I am not at all an expert on this so I will not comment. \nNevertheless, often a simpler solution can be handy. If you want just to limit the bandwidth for one program (for example, the torrent client) a much simple solution is using trickle (1). \nYou can install it by \nsudo apt-get install trickle \n\nand then you run a program with \ntrickle -d 100 -u 50 program \n\nand program will have its bandwidth topped at 100 kbps for download and 50 kbps for upload. A lot more options and info for trickle can be found on this page on tuxradar: \ncontrol your bandwidth with trickle. \n(1) This is different from proper QoS: the bandwidth used by the \"crippled\" program will be reduced every time, not only when there is demand on the higher priority services as it will happen with proper QoS. \n\nA: You don't do this with iptables.  You need to change the routing metrics.\nSet routing metrics for a network interface — Ubuntu Apps Directory\nTo give all other interfaces a higher priority than wlan0 simply run:\nifmetric wlan0 1\n\nTo reset the metrics of the routes attached to wlan0 simply run:\n ifmetric wlan0 0\n\nmore info here: http://0pointer.de/lennart/projects/ifmetric/\n", "Q: Does dual-boot negatively affect performance? I only have one hard disk and Windows 7 is currently installed on it. I'm considering dual-boot but I was wondering: Will having Ubuntu and Windows at the same time with only one HDD affect my PC's performance?\n\nA: Setting up a dual boot does not affect the performance of a computer as only one operating system is running at a time. Thus, they get access to all of the computers resources.

Normally this is a good thing, but you may be booting to your login screen so quickly that your Nvidia graphics card isn't able to keep up. So try installing GDM.

We all download our apps through Internet which uses our Internet bandwidth. Is there a way to share downloaded softwares through network to prevent others from downloading the same thing through Internet.\n\nA:  From my understanding to your question, it is possible to prevent or notify users from re-downloading same apps that have been already downloaded by other users from the same local network. There are many ways to be notified about those apps. Hereby, I can only suggest a general solution because you didn't mention or provide more details about your requirement; for example you forget to mention what OS's are running on those computers!, what things you can do and you cannot do!...etc. Thus, I'm going to suppose that you have 4 computers whose OS's are Ubuntu (maybe same assumption goes for Windows). For example I'm running Ubuntu and my room-mate has Windows 7, we have the same local network. We had the same problem as yours but we were downloading same movies twice not apps. So my room-mate asked me whether I could fix this problem and I did. \nSuggestion 1:\nAs you might know, I had to install OpenSSH server on my Ubuntu and SSH-client in my room-mate's Windows 7, by doing that He could access ONLY the folder of movies that I gave a 777 permission JUST to check my Movies' list I had and to copy un-downloaded movies. If he found a movie he wanted to download, he would just copy the movie in his Windows 7 if he didn't find it on my movies' folder, he would have to download it (I would do the same, I would check his movies' folder...) , so he would not have to re-download them. In your case, I assume you know about OpenSSH Project. If you do, then you will easily fix your problem.\nAbout notification :\nI made a shell script including \"notifylib\" and a counter. The script works in this way; if any movie has been added to the list then notify me. (I could do as much conditions as I wanted in the script) that's it. \nSuggestion 2:\nShare a folder between you guys and name it \"downloaded-apps.\" In this way, you and your friends will be able to check the folder for downloaded apps everytime before go downloading an application, if you want a notification in each computer then you can do it, however, you need to make a script by yourself and keep it running in each computer. All users will be notified whenever a new app has been downloaded. I hope my explanation will help you anyhow. Those are only my suggestions and my personal way of \"How-To-Solve\" your problem, maybe your problem is bigger than that, maybe it is not what you wanted to do.

In a QML app, set the applicationName attribute of the MainView to this value.  In a C++ application, call\nQCoreApplication::setOrganizationName(\"\");\nQCoreApplication::setApplicationName(\"com.ubuntu.developer.flscogna.ubuntu-netwalk\");\n\nWhen it's running, the program uses this value to figure out which directory is writable, but apparmor uses the value in the manifest file to decide where to allow file system access.  If these aren't the same, you run into problems.  (Why the program can't get its application name directly from the manifest file, I don't know.)\n", "Q: What can i do with a low And Old spec computer?

I'm running windows 7 along with ubuntu. Please suggest how I do install Internet explorer there....I have tried searching for downloading file from the internet but couldn't find any for ubuntu...Please help!!\nThanks and regards,\n\nA: You can't install IE5 (or any IE) in an operating system other than Windows (except for some older versions that worked on Mac if I'm correct).\nYou should me able to use Firefox instead - which is installed by default and way better than IE.\n\nA: In order to connect to the internet using an authenticated DSL connection, you need to set your username and password in the network connections. To do this, follow the procedure:\n1.Type \"network\" in your dash, and click on \"Network Connections\".\n\n2.When a window such as the one below pops up, click on \"DSL\" and then \"Add\".\n\n3.When a dialog box such as the one below pops up, add your username and your password in the relevant fields.\n\n4.Next, if you are assigned a static IP address by your Internet Service Provider, then click on \"Manual\" method and add the IP address, Netmask and Gateway and DNS server provided by your ISP in the relevant fields. If you have a dynamic IP, click on \"Automatic PPPoE\".\n\n5.Finally, click on save and see if you are connected to the internet.\n\nA: If Jobin's solution works for you, don't waste your time installing IE, except if you really need it.\nYou cannot find any IE for Linux. However, you can make it work through Playonlinux or wine.\nThe easiest way to make IE work on Linux is to install PlayOnLinux; you need the last version, which you can get here:\nhttp://www.playonlinux.com/en/download.html\nmake sure the package wine1.6-i386:i386 is installed.\nsudo apt-get install wine1.6-i386:i386\n\nOnce PlayOnLinux is installed, simply run it and on the top, click install, then internet, then Internet Explorer 8 (or any version you want). Just follow the installation instructions. It will download and install automatically.\n\nA: Mozilla Firefox and Chromium can be used as Internet Explorer 5.5 and above once you install an extension named 'User-Agent Switcher' which can be found in the ADDON's page, and which will add a button in your toolbar, and allow you to change browser identification settings to IE6 or IE7.\nFirefox also features another addon called 'User Agent Quick Switch' which allows you to quickly and manually change browser identification to whatever you want.\nKonqueror can also be used as Internet Explorer 5.5 and above if you change some settings that are to be found in: Settings - Configure Konqueror - Web Browsing - Browser Identification. You can press 'NEW' and change settings to IE6 or IE7 but you need to know your ISP provider web address to be able to identify Konqueror as Internet Explorer.\n", "Q: How to use ORI file sysstem on Ubuntu How to use the new ORI file system on Ubuntu?

I have performed the scroll up and scroll down operations successfully using this keyboard and have recorded the relevant xev output.\nThe following is the xev output for the successful scroll up operation:\nButtonPress event, serial 40, synthetic NO, window 0x4c00001,\n    root 0x9e, subw 0x4c00002, time 53834970, (55,63), root:(1797,1083),\n    state 0x0, button 5, same_screen YES\n\nEnterNotify event, serial 40, synthetic NO, window 0x4c00001,\n    root 0x9e, subw 0x0, time 53834946, (55,63), root:(1797,1083),\n    mode NotifyGrab, detail NotifyInferior, same_screen YES,\n    focus YES, state 4096\n\nKeymapNotify event, serial 40, synthetic NO, window 0x0,\n    keys:  4294967198 0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   \n           0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   \n\nButtonRelease event, serial 40, synthetic NO, window 0x4c00001,\n    root 0x9e, subw 0x4c00002, time 53834970, (55,63), root:(1797,1083),\n    state 0x1000, button 5, same_screen YES\n\nLeaveNotify event, serial 40, synthetic NO, window 0x4c00001,\n    root 0x9e, subw 0x0, time 53834946, (55,63), root:(1797,1083),\n    mode NotifyUngrab, detail NotifyInferior, same_screen YES,\n    focus YES, state 0\n\nThe following is the xev output for the successful scroll down operation:\nButtonPress event, serial 40, synthetic NO, window 0x4c00001,\n    root 0x9e, subw 0x4c00002, time 53829778, (55,63), root:(1797,1083),\n    state 0x0, button 5, same_screen YES\n\nEnterNotify event, serial 40, synthetic NO, window 0x4c00001,\n    root 0x9e, subw 0x0, time 53829754, (55,63), root:(1797,1083),\n    mode NotifyGrab, detail NotifyInferior, same_screen YES,\n    focus YES, state 4096\n\nKeymapNotify event, serial 40, synthetic NO, window 0x0,\n    keys:  4294967198 0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   \n           0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   \n\nButtonRelease event, serial 40, synthetic NO, window 0x4c00001,\n    root 0x9e, subw 0x4c00002, time 53829778, (55,63), root:(1797,1083),\n    state 0x1000, button 5, same_screen YES\n\nLeaveNotify event, serial 40, synthetic NO, window 0x4c00001,\n    root 0x9e, subw 0x0, time 53829754, (55,63), root:(1797,1083),\n    mode NotifyUngrab, detail NotifyInferior, same_screen YES,\n    focus YES, state 0\n\nSo, with this additional information, would any of you kind, clever people have any guidance on how to instate this type of scrolling on my little ThinkPad? :)\n\nA: Have you tried xinput setting like the link mentioned in this thread? The recognized device TPPS/2 IBM TrackPoint is exactly what's explained there.\n", "Q: If you can send emails from server, but cannot configure desktop client, can you say SMTP is working? This question is a somewhat prologue to a different question posted (here). As I can state that I can send email from my Ubuntu server (12.04) via Roundcube, perfectly. However, I cannot manage to correctly configure my desktop email client on my Mac. And I feel the problem lies in the SMTP port.\nHowever, I want to know where I should be debugging. Therefore I want to know: If I can send emails from the server, via Roundcube, can I state that the SMTP server/postfix is correctly installed/configured/working?\nEdit: Just found this information, which made help:\n\nStarting Nmap 5.21 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2014-01-06 15:50 CET\nNmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)\nHost is up (0.0000060s latency).\nNot shown: 993 closed ports\nPORT     STATE SERVICE\n21/tcp   open  ftp\n22/tcp   open  ssh\n53/tcp   open  domain\n80/tcp   open  http\n110/tcp  open  pop3\n143/tcp  open  imap\n3306/tcp open  mysql\n\nsudo netstat -tlnp\nroot@vps:~# sudo netstat -tlnp\nActive Internet connections (only servers)\nProto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name\ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:10025         0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      2550/master\ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:3306          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      779/mysqld\ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:110             0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      758/dovecot\ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:143             0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      758/dovecot\ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:80              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1002/apache2\ntcp        0      0 159.253.1.196:53        0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      744/named\ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:53            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      744/named\ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      665/sshd\ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:25              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      2550/master\ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:953           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      744/named\ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:4190            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      758/dovecot\ntcp6       0      0 :::21                   :::*                    LISTEN      946/proftpd: (accep\ntcp6       0      0 :::22                   :::*                    LISTEN      665/sshd\ntcp6       0      0 :::25                   :::*                    LISTEN      2550/master\n\nA: Yes! I'm so glad this issue has been fixed! After a lot of googling, I found the solution myself. However, many steps need to have been taken!\npostfix should be configured well. Gladly I had a second VPS with correct postfix configuration (which I completely forgot) - This one doesn't have a correct configuration either, though. Time to fix that.\nApparantly, after a lot of sudo mmap <server ip> and using telnet <port number> plus googling to port 25, I found out that port 25 is blocked by my ISP. Or.. I think so.\nTherefor, I went into the Postfix master file (sudo nano /etc/postfix/master.cf) and pasted this line submission inet n      -       n       -       -       smtpd within the file. This opens Postfix on port 587 and will have Postfix use port 587 instead of port 25.\nAfter that, just enable port 587 in your server firewall (sudo ufw allow 587) and after checking with my desktop mail client, I can verify: It's working!\nIf anyone has an issue like this, just open chat / comment or something. I'd like to help. However: My skills are equal to your grandmother's skills with computers, so don't expect much: Though, I managed to fix this... =)\n", "Q: Setting up gconf2 , Problem Recently I removed Mono Develop .

I have an extra PC and its hard drive died. I would like to buy a new hard drive, 500gig, and load Ubuntu. My question though is if I burn Ubuntu iso with an ISO Burner, will the PC boot from the DVD and install Ubuntu on an empty hard disk?\n\nA: Yes, it will. You just need to set your BIOS for boot from DVD after installing your HD. Follow the instructions on the installation wizard and that's it.\n\nA: There are several considerations. If you never have run Ubuntu on the target system then you could know just by using the Live CD/USB and verifying everything is working. If you have already installed Ubuntu, the new hard drive do not change anything of importance to Ubuntu and everything might work the same as when you installed the system. So, will Ubuntu boot up on your system? The only answer is just test it.\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu with windows 8 I need to install ubuntu alongside with my current version of Windows in my new computer\n(I prefer UBUNTU but I still need windows to run some programs in my work place).\nThe point is that, in windows 8 I can not access BIOS as I did the first time that I installed ubuntu in my older computer.\nCan somebody please provide me a detailed information about how to install Ubuntu without corrupting Windows 8\nThanks people.\nLuis\n\nA: Have you considered doing this in a virtual machine? It is a very good way to get familiar with Linux until you are ready to do something like a dual boot. It also eliminates the need for you to reboot your machine to get to the other OS.\nSome options you have to do this:\nVMware Player download\nVirtualbox download\nThese are both free, and they allow you to install an entire OS inside a virtual machine.\nIf you look at the screenshot I have attached, you can see on the right half of the screen that I am running VMware Workstation, and I have several VMs installed. I have Windows 8 installed in a VM and it is active. The arrows point to some of the VMs that I have installed on this machine.\n\nI am doing what I am suggesting to you, but in the opposite direction. I am working on a Linux OS for the host, and running Windows (and several other OSes) as a guest.\nIf you have any questions on how to get this working, let me know.\nOne thing to note - I've listed the free solutions. The \"Workstation\" version of VMware that I use, that has a paid license, but you can use it in trial mode for some period of time.\n", "Q: Command to open new terminal window from the current terminal? I installed xdotool by running sudo apt-get install xdotool and throw  xdotool key ctrl+alt+t command to open a new terminal window from the current one.But it was not working.\nWhat was the command to open a new terminal window from the current gnome-terminal?\n\nA: Just this command will do:\ngnome-terminal\n\nNormally if you want a command to open from the terminal and separate (so it returns to the prompt without having to close the opened program),  you have to use something like this:\ngnome-terminal & disown\n\nHowever the parent terminal seems to detect that the same command is being used so you don't need to do that and gnome-terminal will suffice. This also seems to happen when running xfce4-terminal from Xfce's terminal, konsole from KDE's as well (doesn't seem to work when running xterm from xterm (see also xterm xterm) - Running konsole from Gnome/Unity & Xfce's terminal works as well, but for Xfce's terminal in gnome terminal you need xfce4-terminal & disown).\nFor more visit gnome-terminal's manual page:\n gnome-terminal  [-e,  --command=STRING]   [-x, --execute ]  [--window-with-profile=PROFILENAME]  [--tab-with-profile=PRO‐\n       FILENAME]    [--window-with-profile-internal-id=PROFILEID]    [--tab-with-profile-internal-id=PROFILEID]    [--role=ROLE]\n       [--show-menubar]   [--hide-menubar]   [--geometry=GEOMETRY]   [--disable-factory]  [-t, --title=TITLE]  [--working-direc‐\n       tory=DIRNAME]  [--usage]  [-?, --help]\n\n\nA: Command to open new terminal window from the current terminal,\nxdotool key ctrl+shift+n\n\nTo install xdotool,\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\n\nA: The following script will open a new tab in the current gnome-terminal window and optionally give that tab a title.  This works from any window, you don't have to be in a gnome-terminal window to run it.  And, if there is no gnome-terminal running, it will start one.  The only caveat is that if you changed the hotkey for opening a new tab you might have to change the line xdotool key ctrl+T to use your hotkey instead.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nDELAY=1\n# get title we are going to set tab too, default to Terminal\ntitle=\"Terminal\"\nif [ $# -eq 1 ]; then\n    title=\"$1\"\nfi    \n\n# get pid of running terminal server\nTPID=$(ps -C gnome-terminal-server -o pid | tail -1 | sed -e's/\\s//g')\nif [ ${TPID} == \"PID\" ]; then\n    # no terminal process running yet, so just start one\n    gnome-terminal -t \"$title\" --tab\n    exit 0\nfi\n\n# there is a terminal, get window id of the running terminal server\nWID=$(wmctrl -lp | awk -v pid=$TPID '$3==pid{print $1;exit;}')\n# get title of currently active tab\nTTITLE=`xwininfo -id 0x5000006 | grep xwininfo | awk '{print $5;exit}'`\nif [ \"$TTITLE\" == \"\\\"Terminal\\\"\" ]; then\n    # so we don't go into an infinite loop later\n    TTITLE=\"we had a terminal named terminal $$\"\nfi\n# get focus on active terminal tab\nxdotool windowfocus $WID\n# use keyboard shortcut to open new tab\nxdotool key ctrl+T\n\n# see if we have created tab and are in terminal\nNTITLE=`xwininfo -id 0x5000006 | grep xwininfo | awk '{print $5;exit}'`\nwaited=0\nwhile [ \"$TTITLE\" == \"$NTITLE\" ]; do\n    # sleep for 1 second before we try again\n    xdotool sleep 1\n    NTITLE=`xwininfo -id 0x5000006 | grep xwininfo | awk '{print $5;exit}'`\n    if [ $waited == 0 ]; then\n    echo \"Waiting \"\n    waited=1\n    fi\n    echo -n \".\"\ndone    \nif [ $waited == 1 ]; then\n    echo \"\"\nfi    \n\n# active tab is the new one we created, wait DELAY seconds just to be sure we can type into it to set tab name\nxdotool sleep $DELAY\nxdotool type --clearmodifiers \"termtitle $title\"\nxdotool key Return\n# make tab the active window and raise it to top\nwmctrl -i -a $WID\nexit 0\n\n", "Q: how to install RADEON Open Source and Ati Catalyst (fglrx) together? -ubuntu 13.10-\ni have two ATI video cards.

It ended up formatting the logical drive(E, but not C !). I realised my mistake in the middle and forcefully ended installation. However it formatted the disk. On windows, the disk space appears to be unallocated. Is there a way I can recover the data?\n\nA: You gave it as swap?! And you're currently using this Linux? I think you lost all your files. Disable this swap space immediately (swapoff). The longer it remains active the less chance you have of saving anything. If you can keep this PC off, it's better.\nI suggest you boot your computer with Hiren's Boot CD. It has a number of tools for maintenance... among these, there are a few for recovering deleted files/files from lost partitions.\nGood luck.

When both machines are windows i can simply hook them up with a network cable and after some time when they dont find a dhcp server they revert to link-local address of range 169.254.x.x/16 and file transfers would just work. Unfortunately in Ubuntu this does not happen. I have to manually set an ip address. Then the machines can ping each other and can transfer files, but only for a short interval of time. \nOne thing I can do is keep issuing sudo ifconfig eth0 ... every 30 secs or so to keep things working but this is pretty annoying. I have to do this kind of transfers quite frequently so would rather not take the hassle of modifying etc/network/interfaces everytime.\n\nA: You have a GUI method to do this:\nType \"network\" in your dash and click on \"Network Connection\".  Click on \"edit\" after clicking on the present network connection in \"wired connection\".\nIn the IPv4 settings, set your method as \"manual\" and set the IP address, gateway and netmask address as required.\nThis will set the IP address manually.\nTo know your IP address, netmask and gateway address, type this on a terminal:\nnmcli dev list iface eth1 | grep IP4\n\n\nA: Following @Jobin's answer I made a discovery that was easier. \nIn Network management under wired connection tab -> IPv4 settings, you can change method to Link Local (from Automatic DHCP). for a quick file sharing session, this is easier as you dont have to enter a manual IP address everytime.\n", "Q: firefox not working as expected When I click on a ink to open a website, I get an \"allow\" button from Firefox, never have seen this before, I went into edit preferences, and I don't see anything. How do I get rid of this???\n\nA: What you are seeing is a feature that Mozilla has enabled in Firefox 26: click-to-play. (It has been available earlier but had to be enabled in about:config).\n\nClick-to-play -- a security feature that requires users to authorize the use of a plug-in when a website or page element requires it -- has been adopted by other browsers as protection against a rising tide of exploits that leverage bugs in plug-ins, particularly Adobe's Flash Player and Oracle's Java.\n\nSource\nIf you really don't want to see this security in action you can, at your own risk, go into about:addons and, in the plugins tab, change what you want to \"Always Activate\".\nFor more information look at Plugin Activation in Firefox written at the time the Aurora version was released:\n\nTo give people a better Firefox experience, we’re changing the way plugins work. Earlier this year we talked about our plan for putting users in control of their plugins.  We are now seeing these plans take shape in the latest version of Firefox Aurora. To give people more control over their browser, Firefox will no longer activate most plugins by default. When a site tries to use a plugin, the user will be able to choose whether to enable the plugin on that site.\nA plugin is 3rd-party software which is loaded into the browser to assist in rendering the Web. Even though many users are not even aware of plugins, they are a significant source of hangs, crashes, and security incidents. By allowing users to decide which sites need to use plugins, Firefox will help protect them and keep their browser running smoothly.\n\n", "Q: Touchpad sometimes not working after click on Thinkpad T440s I have brought a Thinkpad T440s from Lenovo and installed Ubuntu 13.10 on it.

The Windows 8 drivers apparently have some sort of workaround (maybe faster reconnecting or ignoring of these error conditions). The issue (at least in my case) is easy to fix - the touchpad cable moves around and becomes disconnected when I press the touchpad button - you should be able to confirm this by determine if you only see the errors shown above when you push the touchpad down.\nThe solution is to either have Lenovo replace the touchpad, or fix it yourself. In my case, I rerouted the touchpad cable under the battery in a manner such that when I push the touchpad the cable does not come loose. This took only a few minutes, so if you've already opened the bottom of your laptop you probably don't have anything to lose.\n\nA: I can also confirm that it is a hardware issue. Attempts to reroute the touchpad cable weren't successful. The touchpad exchange fixed it.\n\nA: Install the indicator-cpufreq package (sudo apt-get install\nindicator-cpufreq) than reboot. It has solved the problem for me.\nSee this mailing.\n\nA: A fix working for me is given here: Touchpad stopped working out of the blue\nCreate a configuration file for the touchpad:\nsudo -H gedit /etc/modprobe.d/touchpad.conf\n\nAdd this to the file:\noptions psmouse proto=imps\n\nSAVE file.\nREBOOT\nThis is on a T440s\n", "Q: NVidia not working after most recent update I updated today (06 Jan 2014), and X11 failed to boot.  I tried running startx from a terminal login, and noted that it said that there were no screens found.  I trued running nvidia-xconfig, and this failed to resolve the issue.  I deleted /etc/X11/xorg.conf, and this got my system up and running on the sucky on-board video, but then trying to re-enable the NVidia card failed.  I tried using nvidia-settings, I tried re-installing the driver, I tried rolling it back.  None of the above worked.\nI am running XUbuntu 13.10-x64 on an Intel Core i7-2600 CPU @ 3.40GHz, 8 GB RAM, most recent updates installed (in fact, that's what broke things).\n\nA: Working solution:\nThe recent ubuntu xorg update wiped out the NVidia libglx with a default one that crashes.  It's likely only an issue with the NVidia vendor driver.  A quick and easy resolution (see assumptions after these commands!) is:\nsudo mv /usr/lib/xorg/modules/extensions/libglx.so /usr/lib/xorg/modules/extensions/libglx.so.orig\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/xorg/modules/extensions/libglx.so.331.20 /usr/lib/xorg/modules/extensions/libglx.so\n\nThis assumes you were running driver version 331.20.  You can go to /usr/lib/xorg/modules/extensions/ and take a look to see what is there.  You are basically replacing the default (which should be small) with the one provided by NVidia (which should be substantially larger).\nDisclaimer: I handtyped the above commands based upon my setup (Kubuntu Saucy), they may contain typos, enter at your own risk, I am not responsible for puppies spilling out of your CD drive or any other malfeasance wrought upon your system.\nOriginal klunky work-around:\nThe same thing is occurring to me.  I managed to at least be able to log in by disabling all acceleration in KDE.  Chrome still kills the desktop (as it uses acceleration as well).  Something about this update killed the nvidia acceleration and anything that uses it instantly kills X.\nCertainly not a complete answer, but possibly a useful and terrible work-around that may help you find a solution. (I'm using Opera right now, posting this as I seek a resolution myself).\n\nA: You can install it manually, using this post:\n Install Nvidia Drivers in LINUX lightdm xdm gdm 13.10 13.04 Xubuntu Lubuntu Kubuntu. It explains, how to install the driver manually, stop the X service if running, and an alternate solution if that doesn't work.\nI got sick and tired looking for a solution on this, so I decided to post one myself after it worked for me...\n", "Q: MacBook Air MID 2012 Fan Control on Ubuntu 13.10 and higher On my MacBook Air MID 2012 I use Ubuntu since 12.04.\nAfter installing Ubuntu I had to install the \"macfanctld\" package (incl. configuration) to get the fan control of my MBA working.

See the list of releases here.\nOf course the upcomming version, Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr, will have lots of new features, but maybe a little less than you expect: Ubuntu 14.04 will be a so called LTS version, so the focus lays rather on stability than on new features.\n\nA: A new version of Ubuntu comes every April and October. The Ubuntu versions are related to these dates. \n\nExample :\n  Ubuntu 13. 10 : 10th month of the 13th year = October 2013.\n\nLTS versions (Long Term Support) come every two years. Last version was 12.04, so next will be 14.04 (meaning April 2014).\n\nLinux Mint is a modified version of Ubuntu, that's why it comes after Ubuntu, they need time to modify Ubuntu and test if everything works well. Linux Mint 16 is based on Ubuntu 13.10\n\nA: Ubuntu comes out with a new version every 6 months. The version numbers are in the YY:MM format, thus the reason Ubuntu version are always the year and then 04 or 10 (13.10, 14.04).\nAs for the next version to come out, it will be 14.04 LTS Trusty Tahr, the newest Long Term Support version, so you can download the official ISO in April (4th month). LTS versions are supported for much longer and tend to be more stable than the newest version (currently 13.10), but also tend to lack some of the newest features.\nNew LTS versions come out every 2 years, the current LTS release is 12.04 LTS, from 2012. You can read about the release here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases and the release schedule here: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/08/ubuntu-14-04-lts-release-schedule\n\nA: In April. Just so you know the version numbers of Ubuntu indicate when they are released 12.04 is released in April (the fourth month), 12.10 in October (the tenth month). So every six months there is a new release.\n", "Q: How to avoid creation of EFI system partition during installation? I am installing Ubuntu 12.04. After creating partition it prompts for a partition for EFI. I do not want any such partition and have old MBR thing. How to do this?\n\nA: You should make sure that you are booting the installation media in MBR mode, not UEFI mode. You might want to check the settings of your firmware setup screen (formerly called BIOS setup screen).\n\nA: The simplest way is to use a 32bit Ubuntu install media.\nAs it technically cannot boot in UEFI mode, it will install Ubuntu in Legacy (MBR) mode for sure.\nIf you really want to install a 64bit version, then you need to disable UEFI in your BIOS (UEFI firmware) even before starting your Ubuntu disk. Depending on your firmware, this is not always easy/possible.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.10 doesn't boot up after successful installation Installed Ubuntu first time on my pc. Flashed it on my flash-drive,  ran it on my computer and decided to install, after successful installation computer restarts and I only see white line on black blank screen. Again boot from flash drive, run installation and face the same problem. \nComputer specifications:\nCPU: Intel Core i5-2310 2.90GHz\nMotherboard: MSI MS-7732\nRAM: DDR3, 4096 МБ (2х 2048 МБ)\nHDD: SAMSUNG HD161HJ (149 ГБ)\nGPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTS 450\n\nA: I'm guessing your boot loader's installation failed. Boot on your Live drive, and try to reinstall it. In order to do so, select Try Ubuntu when prompted, wait for the environment to load, and open a terminal by doing Ctrl + Alt + T. Become root by typing sudo -i an proceed with the following commands :\ngrub-install --recheck /dev/sda # Install GRUB on sda (adapt this line, see below)\nupdate-grub # Generate configuration.\n\nNote : you can find your hard drive's device file (/dev/sdX) by doing :\nfdisk -l # As root, again.\n\nYou'll recognise your partitions, and hard drives. On most computers, there is only one hard drive, and the kernel loads it on /dev/sda.\nReboot, and everything should be fine.\n", "Q: How can do you install Ubuntu onto a blank Computer using a USB? I wiped my computer and need to install an OS. Unfortunately my computer does not have a CD drive so I need to boot from a USB. How do you do this?\n\nA: You create a live usb from another OS:\nWindows - http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows\nUbuntu - http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu\nOSX - http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-mac-osx\nThen you boot your commuter and set your BIOS to boot from the usb first (before the CD or Hard drive). This varies by BIOS and you may have to look thorugh the (BIOS) menu.\n\nA: You can install Ubuntu from a USB-key. \nYou will need to have : \n\n\n*\n\n*another computer with internet access (running Windows, MacOSX or Ubuntu)\n\n*a 1Gb USB storage key (minimum)\n\n\nGuide for Windows : http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows\nGuide for OSX : http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-mac-osx\nGuide for Ubuntu : http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu\nThen you can install Ubuntu : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick\n", "Q: ELF header smaller than expected I have a Dell XMP-13 Ultrabook (SSD drive only) with 12.04 installed dualboot with the original windows. It has been running flawlessly for many many months.\nToday in the middle of a system update (kernel) I accidentally put it in suspend mode. Then it got frozen whenever I tried to boot. \nI then booted in a previous ubuntu version and the partial upgrade dialog box appeared. I started it and the computer got frozen again.\nNow it stops in the Dell logo screen with the message:\nerror: ELF header smaller than expected. \ngrub rescue>_\n\nI did some research and tried to find the linux images as suggested in this answer: Recovering moved .mod files using grubrescue\nHowever I always get the error: no such partition. when trying to ls on the drives:\ngrub rescue>ls\n(hd0) (hd0,gtp10) (hd0,gtp9) (hd0,gtp8) (hd0,gtp7) (hd0,gtp6) (hd0,gtp5) (hd0,gtp4) (hd0,gtp3) (hd0,gtp2) (hd0,gtp1)\n\ngrub rescue>ls (hd0,gtp1)\nerror: no such partition.\n\ngrub rescue>ls (hd0,gtp1)/boot\nerror: no such partition.\n\nThis is the same for all drive numbers with and without the \"/boot\"\nAny idea of what should I try?\n\nA: First of all: if you come across this error do not despair. Despite the horrendous appearance of the situation it seems that in most cases it is savable.\nAfter some research and help from Julian Stirling in the comments of my question I got the problem resolved by using boot-repair.\nI had to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use my ubuntu desktop to create a bootable USB stick on Ubuntu\n\n*Then in order to be able to boot from the USB I had to change the BIOS Boot Mode Setting to Legacy Boot Mode, Secure Boot Off  \n\n*After booting from the USB I selected the Try Ubuntu\n\n*connected to the internet (WiFi in my case)\n\n*open a new Terminal, and installed boot-repair:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\n\n*When the update finishes run boot-repair:\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && (boot-repair &)\n\n*Then I clicked the \"Recommended repair\" button. In this step I got a little worried when prompted to choose Yes or No to the message \"The boot of your PC is in Legacy mode. You may want to retry after changing it to EFI mode.\". It turns out I had to click Yes or the boot-repair would not run. After a little wait boot-repair did its magic and when it finished I took note of the URL as instructed.\n\n*Finally I changed the BIOS Boot Mode Setting back to what it was before I started. Rebooted and boom! Everything was back to normal.\n\nA: Sounds like your install is somehow mangled and the bootloader can't load the kernel. I would try to do a fresh install , if you have nothing to lose.\n", "Q: how do you get ubuntu for android via windows 7 I personally think that ubuntu touch is a great idea, but there is a problem with it: As far as I can tell, Ubuntu for Android can't be installed unless you have ubuntu on a computer. And my PC runs Microsoft Windows. I've tried the commands that are listed on the site, and nothing has happened. So someone please explain how to get ubuntu for android via Windows 7/8.\n\nA: You do, indeed, need to install Touch into Ubuntu. You have two choices:\nMake your PC a dual boot with both Windows 8 and Ubuntu, leaving Windows 8 intact but shrinking the space on the hard drive/SSD it uses and give some space to Ubuntu, around 8GB or so. The process is pretty painless and menu-driven, and you can resize things later without needing to reinstall either Windows or Ubuntu.\nSet up virtualization in the Windows operating system, then install Ubuntu as a virtual machine, and Touch inside the Ubuntu virtual machine. This is more difficult.\n", "Q: PDF metadata viewer / tag editor for Ubuntu There are a lot of questions and answers regarding the best PDF viewer available with Ubuntu, but I want to parse the PDF file and know details of PDF, such as images, fonts and links that are available in a given PDF file.\nAre there any PDF metadata viewer/tag editors available?\n\nA: *\n\n*View pdf metadata for a file called Example.pdf:  \npdfinfo Example.pdf  \n\n\n*Edit existing metadata in the terminal using nano editor:  \npdftk Example.pdf dump_data output Metadata-output.txt\nnano Metadata-output.txt  \n\n\n*Update metadata:  \npdftk Example.pdf update_info Metadata-output.txt output Example-new.pdf\n\nNano editor keyboard shortcuts\nUse the keyboard combination Ctrl + O and after that press Enter to save the file to its current location.\nUse the keyboard combination Ctrl + X to exit nano. \n\nA: CLI solution\nAnother utility worth looking into is exiftool. The advantage exiftool holds over pdfinfo is that it supports a lot more metadata types (e.g. XMP tags).\nHere's an example of a command that will print all available meta information (-a), sorted by groups (-G1):\nexiftool -a -G1 \"$File\"\n\nOverviews of the supported PDF-related tags:\n\n\n*\n\n*PDF Tags\n\n*XMP PDF tags\n\n*XMP dc tags\nYou can install exiftool on Ubuntu with:\nsudo apt-get install libimage-exiftool-perl\n\n\nGUI solution\nIf you are looking for a GUI PDF metadata viewer/editor you could give PDFMtEd a try. It's a a set of graphical utilities I wrote for managing PDF metadata with exiftool:\n\n\n\nA: The answer of \"best\" really depends on how much detail you want and on how stable you want the viewer to be.  There exists many softwares for viewing and even editing post script and pdf files in linux; all which seem to have been removed from the current Ubuntu repositories (probably due to stability issues).\nFor now I'd recommend trying pdfedit.  If you are using Quantal or earlier it can be installed via\nsudo apt-get install pdfedit\n\nFor newer releases you'll need to download it from it's project page, unpack it, and compile it your self.\n\nA: To elaborate on the pdftk editing method, which is nice because it shows you everything that's being set, at the same time as allowing you to change anything you like, here is a script (for your .bashrc or other aliases file) to do it with one command. This creates a new version of the file you want to edit, opens your favourite editor with the metadatafile, and then implements your changes and sets the file creation/modification time on the modified PDF file to be the same as the original. To use it, after resourcing your .bashrc file, just type\neditPDFmetadata myfile.pdf\nHere's the alias:\neditPDFmetadata() {\nOUTPUT=\"${1}-new.pdf\"\nMETADATA=\"tmp${1}-report.txt\"\npdftk ${1} dump_data output $METADATA\n$EDITOR $METADATA\npdftk ${1} update_info $METADATA  output $OUTPUT\ntouch -r ${1} ${OUTPUT}\n}\n\nSimply place the definition above into the .bashrc file in your home folder, then open a new terminal and it will be ready to use.\n\nA: sudo apt-get install libimage-exiftool-perl\nMetadata can be removed altogether by the following command\nexiftool -all:all= file_name\n", "Q: Graphics card low graphics mode errors Two days ago I updated my system. One of the updates was the nvidia driver.\nWhile updating it asked me if I wanted to update some config file as well. It told me the recommended thing to do was to update this config file. Usually I never do so, but I did agree to upgrade those config files.\nToday I started my PC and was greeted with this message: \n\n\nAfter that I got a message box with the following options:\n\nWhat information would you like to review?\n  ⠀\n  □ Review the xserver log file\n  □ Review the startup errors\n  □ Edit configuration file  \n\nI tried to run it in low graphics mode, but there was no result. Then I tried to reinstall nvidia 331 drivers, but I had the same problem, nothing changed. \nSo does anyone know what can be done here? \n\nA: Did you install 331 using the xorg-edgers ppa? I was using that and ran into this same issue. I exited to the console and purged that ppa. Then I moved to their stable x-swat track. Once I reinstalled 331 from there I've had no issues.\n", "Q: Is a desktop needed to set up a private cloud? I installed ubuntu server 13.10 \n\n\n*\n\n*FTP and SFTP server work OK\n\n*SSH via terminal works as well\n\n*no desktop - only terminal input / output\n\n\nNow I want to install a private cloud\n- with calendar and contact synchronization.\nWhat are the best next steps ?\nDo I need the unity-desktop ?\nIf yes, how can I install it from within the server ?\n- and then ?\nIf not, I would need the terminal commands to proceed.\nAll of what I read so far, required a desktop\nBest regards\n\nA: Devstack is the simplest way to set up a private cloud without using a GUI, and the instructions are available at the OpenStack website.  You will need to make sure git is installed with sudo apt-get install git-core, [Download DevStack] with git clone https://github.com/openstack-dev/devstack.git whose repository contains a script that installs OpenStack and templates for configuration files. Then, start the install with \ncd devstack; ./stack.sh\n\nA: You should not need a desktop installed to run any web based services, but you will probably need to set up a LAMP server. As for the cloud services you are looking to set up, I would take a look at ownCloud, it is a nice fully featured suite  (Calendar, Contacts, Dropbox like file sync with document editing, etc...) \nYou can find simple installation instructions here\nAnd Configuration information can be found in the Documentation Centre here\nHope it Helps.\n", "Q: Should I set up my CUPS Printing to use IPP, LPD or URL? When I got to add a network printer, I'm always confronted with the same dilemma:\nDo I set up the printer via IPP, LPD, or using it's IP address (AppSocket/Jetdirect?) and why?\nWhat are the advantages and disadvantages of each?\nHow is IPP different from the IP address option? If I chose IPP will that prevent me from the need to re-add the printer if the the IP address changes? \n\nThere's a similar question here, but the answers refer to a specific model / situation:\nWhat's the difference between the various printer connections?\n\nHere's a screen shot of the IP style configuration from the Kubuntu set-up wizard:\n\n\nA: LPD is an old standard, IPP is newer.\nUbuntu uses the Common UNIX Printing System (\"CUPS\") to handle printing. CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol (\"IPP\") as the basis for managing print jobs and queues. Other protocols are also supported (LPD, SMB, AppSocket a.k.a. JetDirect), some with reduced functionality.\nLPD/LPR is still commonly used and works quite well but it doesn't provide much control for users on the printer settings per print job.\nBoth the LPD and JetDirect/AppSocket protocols can be used over the Internet today, however neither of these protocols provides authentication services, access control, and all of the document management and formatting (including printer-specific commands) must be handled by the machine sending the document.\nIPP is preferred as it uses bidirectional communication which gives you more feedback and control.\nSome printers may not support IPP.\n\nA: @KodduX answered the question already quite well (and I upvoted it). But here are some additional details...\nThe main advantage of IPP over JetDirect/AppSocket are these:\n\n\n*\n\n*AppSocket is a \"fire and forget\" protocol. IPP(S) can give a very detailed backchannel info about the current state of job processing (which page is currently printed), and more (like query about past, completed or cancelled jobs).\n\n*AppSocket is a very simple protocol, so everybody could reverse engineer it after HP introduced it (quite long ago) and even though it never was an official standard; it's also quite reliable and robust (with all this empty set of 'features' it supports) -- which is why it was widely used and supported by virtually every network printer out there.\n\n*IPP is standardized by the ISTO Printer Working Group (PWG), which is a representation of practically every single printer manufacturer around the world. HP themselves even have embraced IPP quite closely, having more than 350 of their newest printer models self-certified to be consistent with the new 'IPP Everywhere' Standard.\n\n*With IPP(S) you have much better options related to security: authentication/authorization, encryption of transferred data, access control, etc.\n\n*With IPP you have a specified set of names and values for print job options. Duplex printing is either one of 'sides=two-sided-long-edge' or '...=two-sided-short-edge', whereas before, you could have up to ten or more ways to specify a duplex printout (because every vendor was free to use his own naming scheme). The same holds true for many other print parameters.\n\n*IPP(S) allow you query an IPP-enabled printer (and more than 90% of devices sold in the last 10 years can talk IPP -- because AirPrint can only work because of it; and more than half of these can directly consume PDF too) about its specific capabilities: Can it do color? Which paper sizes does it support? Does it do duplex prints? Can it staple, punch, fold? Which IPP versions does it support? Which Page Description Language (PDL -- PostScript, PDF, PCL, JPEG, etc) can I send to it? Etc.pp. ...\n\n*With the latest evolution of the IPP Standard, aptly called 'IPP Everywhere', finally driverless printing starts to work. CUPS can do it! Whenever it encounters an IPP Everywhere printer, it does not need any driver and/or device specific PPD prepared or pre-installed by the administrator any longer: it knows it can send one of the standard page description formats (either of JPEG, PWG-Raster, URF-Raster or PDF which don't require a proprietary driver to generate), it can query the device about its specific capabilities and it will auto-create a PPD reflecting these capabilities so even non-IPP-enabled applications can still print the traditional way (these 'legacy' apps don't talk IPP yet and are used to look for PPDs -- apps like LibreOffice or Firefox or what-not do).\nIPP is the future, and the future is already here. (AppSocket is the past, but it is not yet completely gone. Most IPP printers still talk AppSocket too....)\n\nIn the specific case of your printer, though: some vendors/models have buggy IPP implementations, and they may not work well, while AppSocket printing to the same model may work flawlessly. Just test it with IPP, and keep using it if it works fine.

We had front-end Apache using OpenSSL 0.9.8 and going to backend servers via HTTPS.  We tried to upgrade to using OpenSSL 1.0.1 and we stated seeing the same problem.  After the SSL Poodle issue, we were forced to disable SSLv3 on the front side.\nWe were determined to resolve the problem so I started playing with settings.  I discovered if you disable SSLv2 and SSLv3 on the front side then disable SSLv2 and TLSv1 on the back side, the connection between your front side and back side machine will use SSLv3 and will connect!\nThe settings I used were:\nSSLProtocol all -SSLv2 -SSLv3\nSSLProxyProtocol all -SSLv2 -TLSv1\n\nNow TLSv1 on the front side and SSLv3 on the back internal network.\n", "Q: How to partition a small SSD alongside an HDD when installing Ubuntu There is both a HDD and a 24GB SSD in my Ultrabook.  \nI will install Windows (for testing in feature, as its free in university) in the HDD.\nI need to decide what to do with Ubuntu, as its the system which I'm using for education and for my job (Python Developer).\nThe SSD works very good, but some people write its not a good idea to install an operating system on an SSD.\nIf I will use it as the main Ubuntu partiton, the 24GB for system is not enough as its my primary system, and new games from valve is around 7 GB and in some years i will collect a lot data in system. I don't like reinstalling Ubuntu, its not Windows :D.\nSo, what is your idea?  To use all SSD as swap (RAM is 4GB) and install all the system in HDD, to use part of SSD as swap and other part as /system, to use SSD as system and make partition for swap in HDD, or something else?\n\nA: Actually, installing Linux into an SSD is very good... with a little bit of modification.\nInstall Windows first to the HDD. Only once Windows is installed and working OK do you bring in Ubuntu.  \nPut the swap partition on the hard drive as well as /var and /tmp because those are written to constantly; moving those off the SSD will prolong the life of the SSD to match the HDD life, because older SSDs live much longer if you don't write to them constantly, and swap, /tmp and /var are the areas which are written to heavily. \n(Note: Now that Linux supports TRIM, modern SSDs often outlast HDDs.)\nAlso put /home in an ext4 partition on the hard drive, for if the SSD fails for whatever reason it is much more difficult to recover data from it than an HDD.  Resizing the partition(s) created by Windows is easy, menu-driven, and painless.\n/ (AKA root) takes up as much space on the SSD as you have available. Ubuntu should fit well into the 24GB you have available, since it typically is only 6GB, but if the / partition grows to take it all you can move some parts of the filesystem off to the HDD flexibly.\nOther configuration modifications help as well, such as enabling TRIM.\nHere's testimony which shows Linux LIKES SSDs... What about the performance enhancement when using an SSD as the main disk? and Setup for dual disk (SSD+HDD) with /home partition . \n", "Q: Booting from Ubuntu ISO CD - Windows 7 partitioning Do I partition Windows 7 hard disk before I install Ubuntu using disk utility in Windows 7?\nOr do I do it with my Ubuntu ISO CD after booting?\nAnd can I choose the size of the partition using Ubuntu ISO CD?\n\nA: \nDo I partition windows 7 hard disk before I install Ubuntu using disk utility in windows 7. \n\nYes, you can do this.\n\nOr do I do it with my Ubuntu ISO CD after booting. And can I choose the size of the partition using Ubuntu ISO CD.\n\nYes, you can do this too.\nThe only difference is that, in the second case, you will find a ready-to-use empty partition to host Ubuntu, when you will be in the Ubuntu live session.\nIn any case, a defrag pass is recommended (from win7) to prepare the empty space you're planning to use for your Ubuntu partition. Faster and with the same result (for this scope) is to just \"consolidate\" the free space.\nI also suggest to have a separated partition for your /home dir, as this can easily survive (and then conserve almost all your personal settings) from one Ubuntu version to the next one. It's also easier to backup.\n", "Q: How can I install Django for Python 3.x? I installed Django with this command: \nsudo apt-get install python-django\n\nAnd it installed version 1.5.4-1ubuntu1. The Django docs say that as of version 1.5, Django supports Python 3. Yet when I run the python 3 interpreter and try importing Django, it says there's no such module. I tried looking for a python3 version of Django, but no such package exists. How can I get django working on python3? I'd prefer to use ubuntu packages instead of installing things manually. \n\nA: Django for Python3 has now been added recently. So simply type in a terminal:\napt-get install python3-django\n\nA: I would strongly suggest avoiding pip3 to install things in the system site-packages. I've made these arguments before but I'll give you the notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*System updates break everything\n\n*Installing apt packages can overwrite pip-installed things\n\n*Version conflicts\n\n*Distribution upgrades are unpredictable chaos. Seriously. I've lost hair to these.\n\n\nI would strongly advocate using virtualenv. It's a massive pain in the wherever to get going but once you've got it set up you have a complete Python environment under your complete control. This does mean more work (you'll have to check things for updates and pip doesn't really help there yet) but you don't have to worry about what Ubuntu's doing.\nI have an environment for each site (just sitting in a subdirectory called venv). Some people —including me, once upon a time— prefer to share their environments between multiple sites. I found this easier to maintain in terms of issuing updates but some sites can be fragile or require old versions and that holds the whole environment back. YMMV.\nIn terms of installing this, and just to slap me in the face, virtualenv isn't packaged for Python 3 yet so we have to use pip3:\n$ sudo pip3 install virtualenv\n...\n\n$ virtualenv-3.3 myenv\nUsing base prefix '/usr'\nNew python executable in myenv/bin/python3\nAlso creating executable in myenv/bin/python\nInstalling setuptools, pip...done.\n\n$ source myenv/bin/activate  # This is important!\n\nYour bash PS1 should now be preneded with (myenv) to let you know you're in a different environment. We can test the environment to check we're on the right versions of things (not using the system versions for starters):\n$ python --version\nPython 3.3.2+\n$ which python pip \n/home/oli/Desktop/myenv/bin/python\n/home/oli/Desktop/myenv/bin/pip\n\nAnd then you can just carry on as if you were master of the universe. You don't need root to use pip anymore and you don't need to specify pip3. It's just a lot more friendly.\n$ pip install django umemcache\n...\n\nIf you're using something like uwsgi to host this (you should) use its -H flag (or home config argument) to tell it where the Python environment lives.\nAs for making development easier, you can automatically \"mount\" your virtualenv environment. There are many scripts out there but this one is mine (this lives at the bottom of my ~/.bashrc:\nexport VENVDIR=\"/web\"\nexport VENVDIR_VENV=\"$VENVDIR/venv\"\n\nvenvcd() {\n        wd=$(pwd)\n        [[ $wd == $VENVDIR/* || $wd == $VENVDIR ]] && wasin=true || unset wasin\n\n        builtin cd \"$@\"\n\n        wd=$(pwd)\n        if [[ $wd == $VENVDIR/* || $wd == $VENVDIR ]]; then\n                source $VENVDIR_VENV/bin/activate\n        else\n                [ $wasin ] && deactivate\n        fi\n}\nalias cd=\"venvcd\"\n\ncd .\n\nWhenever I cd into /web (where all my development websites are stored), it mounts the virtualenv for me. Note that I only have one environment for all my sites so this will only suite you if you do something similar. There are many other ways of doing similar things.\n\nA: Guys there is an easy way using virtualenvwrapper, by far the most easiest to manage Python 2.7/3.x virtual environments in Ubuntu/Debian.\n$ sudo apt-get install python3 virtualenvwrapper\n$ mkvirtualenv <venv> -p python3\n$ workon <venv> # sets into the virtualenv from any terminal.\n\nOptionally enable --system-site-packages to reuse global site packages.\nvirtualenv installs pip and other python setup tools to help us get started quickly.\n$ pip install Django\n$ pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n\nA: I figured out how to do this with pip. Turns out I needed pip3: \nsudo pip3 install Django\n\ndid the trick. \nYou might need to get pip3 by:\nsudo apt-get install python3-pip\n\n", "Q: Iomega External HDD Not Accessible I have an Iomega HDD of capacity 500 GB that works flawlessly on Windows 7, and I own the drive for approximately 3 years.

I use it for web development and I need to make Git repo from virtual HDD visible for the host OS to edit files on the host.\nWhat is the best way to do it?\n\nA: There are two straight forward ways to accomplish this that are independent of the virtualization software that you are using.\n1. set up a samba share folder on the guest and then add it like a shared network folder on the host.\n2. Share a folder on the Windows host and then use samba to open/map it on the Ubuntu guest.\nVirtual box, and I believe VMWare have an option to share folders between guest and host that uses this underlying setup but is all done through the gui of the virtualization software. \nTo be more specific I would need to know what path you would like to take.  Option 1 would best match the paradigm of guest to host. \n\nA: Right click the virtual machine in VirtualBox and select Settings. You'll see the dialog below with a button to add a shared folder. \n\n", "Q: System hangs during boot at \"Starting MySQL server [OK]\" I have Ubuntu 12.04 installed on my machine (Dual boot).

But when I start copying files again, the sme happens.\nWhat is wrong with my PC or my setup? Is it a Bug of Ubuntu (that maybe fixed) or is my HDD broken?\n\nA: It sounds like you have a problem with your external HDD. It may not be the HDD itself - it may just be the enclosure failing.

I want to be able to use the voice chat abilities of Skype, but I'd rather not sign up for another online service, privacy and all that. \nSo, I have been looking around and came across SIP, and would like to use Jitsi (or, if anyone has a better SIP client, please comment - Empathy is another I am looking at) just for voice (no video needed.) I have googled quite a bit and can't seem to find any sources.\nBasically, do I need a Skype (or any other site for that matter) account to talk to someone who is using a Skype account?\n\nA: As far as I know, Skype and SIP accounts are not compatible. So, no you won't need a Skype account to talk via SIP. However, you will need a SIP account. By the same token person at the other end will need a SIP account too, not to mention a working and properly configured SIP client. \nUnlike Skype, I found configuring SIP a bit more difficult, particularly because there are multiple SIP service providers and settings may be a bit different for each. \nBoth Skype and SIP allow calling regular phones and receiving calls from phones. Unfortunately these are not free in either for Skype or for SIP service providers.\nIf you just want to talk and already have a gmail account, you can try Hangout. It works without any download/install, (tested with Chrome browser). You can talk to people with Android phones and tablets as well as PCs, using WiFi (or wired Internet for PCs). Skype apps are available for phones as well.\nIn any case, you will need an account somewhere. The account is what identifies you to the other Skype/SIP/Gmail users. If you don't have an account there is no easy way for someone to call you (and you to call someone else without an account).\nOne alternative is to use Viber. Not that it does not need an account, but it uses your (mobile) phone number as your account number. So anyone who knows your phone number can contact you. See How to install Viber in Ubuntu? for more on Viber. I have never used it, so I don't know much about it. \nHope this helps\n\nA: I'm not an expert on sip protocol but afaik, sip is just that, a protocol.\nHaving a client is not enough to talk to anyone. You need a server with a service implementing the sip protocol and you and your contacts would need to register to that service.\nSkype uses its own protocol, not sip, although the skype connect mentions something like sip profile and the like. \nJust use Skype or any other voice chat service, you will always need an account unless you host your own server (like a teamspeak server).\n\nA: As other answers have eluded to SIP is just a protocol much like 4G LTE.\nWhile direct SIP to SIP calling is possible, you usually need to have both SIP accounts hosted on the same server.  However, many SIP providers provide access via the older POTS (plain old telephone service) network by providing you with a traditional phone number.  You can use this phone number to bridge different SIP providers.\nTo use the SIP you'll need an account on an SIP server, whether that be google voice, OnSIP, skype, or your own Astrix PBX server.\nI personally use google voice for personal use because it's free and I already had a google account and set up my workplace using OnSIP because of their flat rate pricing, but have since come to love their  web-tools.   \nIf you plan to use a google account for SIP calls I'd recommend Yate as a client so that you don't have to leave you gmail constantly open.\n", "Q: Best option for recording Minecraft Server play? I am planning on doing some server minecraft screen recording just for fun, and so I've been looking around at what there is to offer. I know FRAPS won't work on Ubuntu and I'd rather not spend the $30 for it anyways, so I looked around and found glc, which I thought looked good.\nI then googled some more and found this question: Fraps like programs for Ubuntu? and there are two answers, one suggesting glc (which I knew about), and another suggesting gtk-recordmydesktop (also knew about) and VLC streaming (did not know about).\nMy question is, which of these would have the least impact on RAM and still record my video at good (minimum 360p) quality and get sound from voice chat through an SIP client on my system (SIP=Session Initiation Protocol - I would be using Jitsi or Empathy) connected to my friend(s) using Skype.\n\nA: recordMyDektop is going to be your best option. I've used it in the past, and it's done well for gameplay. As for getting it to receive audio input from Skype or Empathy, that will take a little bit of tweaking with a virtual soundboard.

Solved it by reinstalling audacity after deleting /home/your_username/.audacity-data directory and that fixed the problem\n\nA: I built audacity from the latest SVN source, and it segfaults while trying to load /usr/lib/ladspa/blop_files/parabola_1649_data.so.  I found that out by starting it from inside gdb:\ngdb /usr/local/bin/audacity\nrun\n....\n<segfault happens>\nbt\n\nUninstalling the blop package fixed it for me.  IDK why, because the ubuntu-packaged /usr/bin/audacity doesn't have a problem even with blop installed.\n\nA: Not really an answer, but a solution, because, I was no longer able to reboot after altering permissions, I decided on a fresh install. \nSo I booted in on a live disk, made backups, and reinstalled the OS.\nTurned out to be the easiest solution, very easy to restore most settings, just by copying over the appropriate backed-up files into the new system.\n", "Q: Force 16:9 from 4:3, Intel graphics Is there a way to force 4:3 screen resolution/scale to 16:9?

Both are no longer under warranty as they are more than 3 years old.\n Naturally, I moved all my important data on another drives. But, since the number of bad sectors is (or, more exactly, was) not very high, several hundreds at most, I intended to keep using them (for \"junk\" data, which I would not care about if it is suddenly lost) until they would simply fall apart.\nI had once a hard drive (internal) which showed bad sectors and I was able to use it intensively for more than 18 months after the first bad sectors appeared.\n But here is a little problem: I reformatted both drive in order to have the bad sectors marked as \"bad\" and re-allocated. But, while the bad sectors dissappeared after the reformat, the reformatting resulted in several sections of the drives (tipically of 5-10 GB in size) becoming extremely slow.\n One of the drives showed bad sectors almost 2 years ago. Reformatting removed them and no new ones appeared, but there are small parts of the drive where the writing speed slaws to a crawl (up to 1-2 MB/s). The reading speed is fine over the entire drives.\n The second drive (which went bad just a week ago) again had no bad sectors after reformat anymore and its health status is labeled as ok by HDTune Pro (the tool I use for drive diagnostic), but there is at least one part of the drive where the reading speed, this rime, becomes very slow. The part is at the position 48-54 GB on HDTune's drive map and the reading speed slows down there to 4-5 MB/s. The writing speed is fine over the entire drive.\nIs there any way to fix this? Not to repair the damaged sector (that is pretty much impossible most of the time), but at least to mark the slower sections so that Windows won't try to write there.\n The drives are still usable; the first which went bad had been stable for more than a year with constant usage, but this speed problem can become irritating when you hit the faulty sections.\nAny ideas? \nPS: I have replacement drives and I intend to use the faulty drives for data I don't actually care about. Basically, I want to give them a go until they fail for good.\nMoreso, I am not certain that the drives were doomed, so to speak. One of them kept functioning for 2 years after it developed some bad sectors. By most accounts, this is very unlikely to happen in case of physical bad sectors.\nIn addition, the bad sectors disappeared after being rewritten and physical bad sectors can't actually be mapped out by conventional diagnostic/repair utilities.\nIf the bad sectors my drives developed were logical ones, then the drives are still very usable.\nThey do continue to work, but they only have a problem with the speed (one drive with the writing speed, the other with the reading speed) over some small portions, which I can't figure why and it's a bit annoying.\n\nA: Likely you reformatted on MegaByte boundaries. Re-reformat on cylinder boundaries for better speed. \nThe cylinder is a physical stack of all the same-numbered sectors (slices) across all platters (visualize a stack of pies, all with the same sized slices,, all lined up).\nA MegaByte (MB) boundary does not physically align with the slices, and although using MB boundaries on an SSD is OK, if slows things down on an HDD.  \nGParted makes setting this up easier and here is an illustration.\n", "Q: Where is dualboot.sh?

You can partition your hard drive 50-50 but you don't have to. This guide recommends 5 GB free disk space. I am not sure if it is still up to date, but 10 GB should be enough for a minimal installation.\nHow much disk space you really need, depends on the programs you are installing.\nBut, you have to consider where you want to store your private files (Music, Photos, Documents, etc.). Ubuntu is able to access your windows partion, so you can store this things primiliy there, but if you want to store them on the Ubuntu partion you need some more space for that.\nMost of your peripherals should run out of the box, but that depends on your hardware. I suggest installing Ubuntu first. If something is not working, come back and ask again ;-)\n", "Q: How do you create a live persistent Ubuntu USB on a Mac that will boot to a Mac or PC? Hello I have actually successfully created a live Ubuntu USB (12.04.3 64-bit on 8GB LiveUSB) using unetbootin, however it is not persistent and will not boot on a Mac. \nOr, if anyone has any suggestions on how to edit the .iso file so it boots from a Mac and is persistent, that would be great too. I am running OSX Mavericks so the application would have to run on Mavericks too. \nI tried following  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2174630 ans, as suggested below, chose GUID partition (not MBR) and then add persistent word in grub.cfg file. and after I booted and changed a few settings, I tried to reboot using the restart option in the ubuntu menu, and it didn't work. I manually powered my computer off and on, but when I tried to boot the second time, I got past the Ubuntu logo and then my screen went black.

Be very careful, check and double-check, that everything is correct, before you start the cloning process.\n\n\n*\n\n*One step: If you find a [compressed] image file of an Ubuntu [based] system, that is persistent live, and can do what you want, clone it to a USB pendrive or a memory card. If the downloaded file is compressed, you need to extract it before cloning, for example\nfile.img.zip --> file.img\nfile.img.xz --> file.img\nUnmount all partitions on the target drive and run dd\nsudo dd bs=1m if=path_of_your_image.img of=/dev/rdiskn\n\nwhere n is a number (for example, /dev/rdisk4).\nThere are tips in this link.\n\n*Two steps: Download and clone a [compressed] image file of an Ubuntu [based] system, that is persistent live, and contains mkusb.\nBoot from from the USB pendrive or memory card which was made bootable by cloning.\nDownload an iso file of the Ubuntu version and flavour, that you want to install as persistent live.\nRun mkusb-dus and create a persistent live drive in another USB drive or memory card.\n\n*Links\nInstalling operating system images on Mac OS (www.raspberrypi.org)\nhelp.ubuntu.com/community/mkusb\nhelp.ubuntu.com/community/mkusb/persistent\nCompressed image file with a persistent live system and mkusb\n\nA: You should be able to accomplish this using diskutil.

I exactly followed same instructions, and in fact i've used it for so many times. At this point what you can try is follow what is says and this time follow as it is. I mean select MBR not GUID. If you don't have grub.cfg file in your boot folder, that's fine. But, check syslinux.cfg file for the word persistent. If it's there, that should work perfectly. I mean it did work for me, I hope that would work for you as well. Try to play with .cfg files and you'll sure can do it.\n\nA: If you need your Mac to boot from the Ubuntu USB, the Ubuntu website has a detailed guide explaining how to dd the disk image onto a USB. \nAlternatively, if you have access to Windows, download Rufus. When selecting the image type, choose DD and select your desired ISO file (Ubuntu ISOs are hybrid, meaning they can either be copied in ISO or DD mode). DD's the one you want, that's the important thing. Also make sure you set the partition scheme/target system type to MBR for BIOS AND UEFI.\nAs for persistence, if anyone else can add to/improve my answer, please do so as I've never had experience setting up persistent volumes.\n\nA: TLDR; Adding \"persistent\" to grub.cfg is what broke the boot for me (hung at the same black screen). Adding a casper-rw file fixed it and now I have persistence:)\nBackground: I'm running High Sierra, installing Ubuntu 16.04, 64 bit. Erased the USB with Disk Utility and set up as MS-DOS(FAT32). Downloaded Ubuntu ISO, installed to USB with UNetbootin. Had a working boot but wanted linux to recognize my trackpad and keyboard on my Macbook. Did the setup and rebooted and all the setting were lost--no persistence:(\nAdded \"persistent\" to grub.cfg and the boot hung after the Ubuntu logo screen. Turns out I needed to create a casper-rw file in the root of my USB stick by running\ndd if=/dev/zero of=casper-rw count=3500\nReplace 3500 with the size storage you want your live usb to have.

If I install something through source, and install it, when apt-get something else, apt-get can't find the app I installed through source as dependency, How can I solve this problem?\n\nA: apt-get only knows about software that you installed using the package manager, that is by using apt-get, aptitude, Software Center or similar programs.\nYou can use  equivs-control  and equivs-build (package equivs, not installed by default) to create \"fake packages\" to fulfil dependencies.\nIn general it's better to use the package manager if possible.\n", "Q: How to make dual monitors output the same color?

So I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 and glabels 2.2.8.  The only problem is that glabels 3.0+ have been available for a loooooong time now.  I want to install glabels 3.0 just by downloading the deb and installing it (like every other windows computer gets to do by the way), but No, I don't have all the right dependecies installed.  \nSo I start downloading all of those and installing them one by one.  Then I learn that those dependencies have dependencies and so on.  How on earth can I just download the latest software version with everything included in one installer package and install it?\nI just want the latest and greatest version of the software that I like to use.I waited forever for Ubuntu to get the latest version of Miro added to the repository.\n\nA: Generally, you should stick to the stable official repositories, but seeing as you don't want that, read on.\nThere are several options when you want the latest version of a package or program, in order of preference:\n1. Using a PPA: This is the most preferred method.\nPros:\n\n\n*\n\n*You'll get the latest version of the software.\n\n*The software will automatically update (with the Software Updater)\n\n*Dependencies are automatically resolved (via apt-get)\n\n\nCons:\n\n\n*\n\n*It may take some time for a new version to be pushed to the PPA. This should be a lot faster than the normal repos, but keep it in mind.\n\n*You're relying in the PPA maintainer to update it to the lates version. If (s)he chooses to abandon it, you'll be left with an old version. If it is an official PPA from a project, you should be fine, though.\n\n*PPA Security: You're allowing a random person from the internet root access to your computer (during install).  See Are PPA's safe to add to my system and what are some \"red flags\" to watch out for?, generally you should be fine but just a warning.\n2. Using a provided Debian Package (.deb file)\nPros:\n\n\n*\n\n*You'll get the latest version of the software.\n\n*Dependencies should be relatively easy to install with apt-get.\n\n\nCons:\n\n\n*\n\n*No automatic updating via the Software Updater. The program itself might provide auto-updating.\n\n*Root access to your computer. The main points in Are PPA's safe to add to my system and what are some \"red flags\" to watch out for? still apply.\n\n\n3. Using provided binaries\nNote: This differs from \"compiling from source\", though they may be using the same archive formats.\nPros:\n\n\n*\n\n*You'll get the latest version of the software.\n\n\nCons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dependencies may be more difficult to install.\n\n*Installation is more difficult, files may need to be copied or moved manually.\n\n*See Cons for Debian Package.\n\n\n4. Compiling from source\nPros:\n\n\n*\n\n*You'll get the latest version of the software.\n\n\nCons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Compiling from source is often tricky and involves work with dependencies and such.\n\n*See Cons for Using provided binaries.\n\n\nA: I would recommend installing via apt (advanced packaging tool) or Synaptic (GUI for apt). Apt will automatically resolve complex package dependencies for you. An apt-cache search glabels returns the following:\nglabels - label, business card and media cover creation program for GNOME\n...\nSo... sudo apt-get install glabels and you should be good. \n\nA: Easy solution, forget LTS and install a Normal release instead.

The most common way this happens is that currently working customized configuration files are over written by the default version upon installation of an updated package (the bug I mention below is a result of this).\nHowever, especially when a user is trying to install a package that is no longer maintained, or one that hasn't yet been accepted to the general repository, it's not all that uncommon to come across dependency related issues.\nThe most simple form of this is a versioning issue that is caused when the package you want to install has a co-dependancies with other packages on your system that can only be satisfied by installing an downstream or upstream version of a file on your system.\nWhile usually not a problem, package-maintainers often claim that their package has indefinite forward compatibly with packages they are dependant on.  However if the maintainer of the package depended on makes an unexpected change upstream, this can break your system (and indeed has caused me problems when adding new desktop environments to saucy)\nIn other cases, the dependences required by the package you are installing conflict with what's already installed on your system.  When this happens the package manager may ask you to remove some packages that you may be relying on in order to install and satisfy the dependencies of the new packages.   This can be avoided by carefully reviewing the purpose any packages that are requested for removal.\nIn some rare cases where packages on your system did not adequately declare all of their dependencies, you may find some packages no longer work even though they claim to have all their dependencies satisfied.\nIf you always use either synaptic, or aptitude to do your package installs, then you'll have a better chance of recovering form this situation.  Unlike apt-get, synaptic, and aptitude keep a log of exactly what was installed and removed, and thus allow you to easily revert to your previous state.\n\nI have personally experienced a problem with trying to co-install Unity and another lightweight desktop environment, so I wouldn't be surprised to hear that LXDE also doesn't work well with unity installed.  That said, the likely hood is low and recovery via aptitude (or synaptic provide you can still access the GUI) is easy.\nNevertheless, I found the fight to keep unity happy with openbox and enlightenment really wasn't worth it to me, especially considering the extremely slow performance of Unity's dash.   \nAfter trying a plethora of other environments and distros, I settled on KDE via Kubuntu and/or LinuxMint as a better choice to replace Unity as a full fledged desktop because it still provides access to ubuntu support channels, and overall seemes to be better suited for traditional desktop use.  I do, however, still run Unity on my lower powered netbooks/nettops/tablets where I'm less likely to use dash anyway.\n", "Q: creating usb boot drive on mac os I have followed the instructions for creating a bootable usb drive on my mac for use on another non-mac machine.  The non-mac machine is not booting off the new usb drive.   I notice that in the instructions here (http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-mac-osx) it mentions that macs tend to append the .dmg suffix to *.iso.  \nIf that happens -does anything need to be done?

For the last month on my Ubuntu 13.10 system, Software and Updates always shows that the laptop is up to date. I tried to change the server for updates but with the same result.\nSo is it normal?\n\nA: This is often to be expected, especially if updates are being installed automatically behind the scenes (which you can configure in the Software Updater). And sometimes, a month or more goes by without any updates being released.\nWhy does so much time sometimes pass with no new updates? With default settings, it is intended that users of stable releases only get updates for security bugs and serious stability/usability bugs; in Ubuntu, updates to provide new features are not typically rolled out after the end of a release's beta phase.\nIt's a good idea to check to make sure updates are working properly on your system, though.\nCheck Your Update Settings\nTo check your settings, run the Software Updater [Update Manager for people using old versions of Ubuntu] and click Settings.... You might have to wait for it to automatically check for updates, before being able to do that.\n\nThe Software & Updates window is shown (called some different things on some other versions of Ubuntu). Under \"Install updates from:\", there are checkboxes for the different kinds of updates that can be installed. At least \"Important security updates\" should be checked, and you probably want \"Recommended updates\" as well.\nUnder that, you can choose how often to check automatically for updates, what to do when new security updates are found, and what to do when other (non-security) updates are found. If you have something relatively frequent chosen for \"Automatically check for updates\" and you have \"Download and install automatically\" chosen for \"When there are security updates:\", then most likely any important security updates are being installed behind the scenes for you.\nBut if you have \"Never\" selected for \"Automatically check for updates,\" then you're not getting updates installed or even checked for automatically.\n\nAfter making sure your settings are however you want them, click Close. Then I recommend checked your Ubuntu's systems record of what updates have been installed recently. That should answer the question as to whether or not you're getting updates.\nChecking If Updates Are Being Installed\nIf your settings look good, then you should check to see if the updates you'd expect to get are really being installed automatically.\nTo see when updates were last installed, you may be able to see a list of everything installed recently (including updates) in the Software Center.\nOr you can look at the package manager's logs, especially history.log in the /var/log/apt folder. You can view that file by double-clicking on it in Nautilus (the graphical file browser), or in the Terminal with:\nless /var/log/apt/history.log\n\nIf the file is empty, there's still typically no need to worry; in that case, look at history.log.1.gz, the most recently \"old\" log. To examine it graphically, you can double-click it, drag the .log file inside anywhere (e.g. the desktop), and double-click the extracted file (since a .gz file is compressed).\nOr you can easily view it in the Terminal with:\nzless /var/log/apt/history.log.1.gz\n\nIf the dates in the log(s) show updates installed in the last couple of months, then most likely everything is fine.\nIf they do not, then maybe something isn't working. In that case, please edit your question to include the full contents of sources.list in the /etc/apt folder. You can view that graphically, or have its contents shown on (and copyable from) the Terminal with:\ncat /etc/apt/sources.list\n\n(For readers with this or a similar problem other than the poster of this question, of course you shouldn't edit this question. Instead, you should post your own question, fully describing your situation; you can include the contents of that file in your question.)\n\nA: reinstalling the ubuntu 13.10 solved the issue \n", "Q: Where I find the usb-creator.exe that was included in previous versions of Ubuntu?

Just run the following:\nsudo apt-get install ocl-icd-libopencl1\n\nThen run:\n    sudo apt-get autoremove\n...which removes the packages that libopencv-dev depends on but which are now satisfied by the generic package you just installed.\nIf you rebooted before installing ocl-icd-libopencl1 and after installing libopencv-dev, your desktop is probably still messed up. If you see a blank black screen with your mouse pointer on it after following the steps above, re-install ubuntu-desktop and unity and reboot. Then, if you see a graphical desktop without Unity running, you will need to install the Compiz config tool:\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager compiz-plugins-extra\n\nReboot once again, then when you get to your Unity-free desktop, hit Ctrl-t to open a terminal and run:\nccsm\nThis will start the Compiz settings manager.

I don't know if this will work, but you say that the script works when you run it directly but when it's run automatically it doesn't: This makes me think that the problem might be to do with it being run by a different user when it's run automatically, and the tilde resolves to different values for different users.\n", "Q: Error removing initramfs tools (fresh install) I have seen a few other people with this issue, but they have an existing install that they can drop into to fix it. I don't!\nSo, I am trying to install Xubuntu 13.10 using a live USB, and in doing so I have intentionally formatted the installation partitions (all my data is safely floating in the sky). Everything seems to work until right at the very end I get the message:\nError removing initramfs-tools:\nsubprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1\n\nThe only thing I can think of is that some partition somewhere isn't big enough... I have:\nsda1 /swap   512MB\nsda2 /boot   56MB\nsda3 /home   32GB\nsda5 /var    4GB\nsda6 /opt    4GB\nsda7 /       31GB\n\nAny advice at all would be welcome as at the moment I have a totally unbootable system following the attempted install. Booting to GUI hangs at the splash screen. Trying Ctrl + Alt + F1 from there does NOT give a login prompt. Booting into recovery and dropping to root shell leaves me with no partition other than sda7 and sda5 mounted, all the other partitions refuse to mount!\nIf I attempt to mount, for example sda2 then:\n# mount -t ext4 /dev/sda2 /boot\nmount: /dev/sda2 already mounted or /boot busy\n\nEdit: Now cross-posted to http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2198405\n\nA: In the end I 'solved' this by installing 12.04.3 LTS instead of 13.10.  As part of this I also 'rejigged' my partitioning schema:\nsda1 /swap  swap 4GB\nsda2 /boot  ext4 128MB\nsda3 /var   ext4 8GB\nsda5 /opt   ext4 4GB\nsda6 /      ext4 16GB\nsda7             16GB\nsda8 /home  ext4 200GB\n\nsda7 is unformatted free space for test installations and is where I will eventually try installing 13.10.\nIn any case, 12.04.3 LTS is installed and running quite happily.\n\nA: Instead  of dropping into a root shell please enter dpkg or fsck or grub options from the menu and wait till it finishes. This will automatically mount the file-systems. Also enable network before dropping into root shell. Otherwise you wont be able to download the package list or any packages:\n\nPlease try the following commands:\nsudo apt-get clean\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nIf you still end up with the same error, try:\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\n", "Q: How do I find the program to associate with a file on the web? I'm not so good at wording questions, but I'll try and explain it. \nOn a website webupd8.org, there are some orange boxes that has \"available on the Sofware Centre\" written on it. When I click on it I get the \"Launch Application\" dialogue box.\nAssuming that it is like clicking on a link for the google play store that opens up the play store app on your phone, I hit \"Choose\" to look for the \"ubuntu software center\". I can't find it though.  Am I looking for the wrong thing? \nHow to I make manual file associations in the future? \n\nA: You are correct to use the \"Lauch Application\" dialogue box to create file associations.  Another way to do get to the dialogue in the future is to right click on the file of interest and choose \"open with\".\nThe ubuntu-software-center handles .deb file types, and would be what you would want to look for if the link was directly to a .deb file.\nHowever, in this case you to open that can handle 'apt:' uris.

It seems my version is generic.    \n\nA: There are several different flavours of the kernel available, but -generic is very likely what you want.\nThe specialised versions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*linux-image-server: tuned to respond to lots of requests rather than handle real-time interaction with a user. EDIT: This appears to have been discontinued and just points to -generic.\n\n*linux-image-virtual: I think this mostly just involves removing hardware drivers that are unlikely to be encountered in a virtual machine to save space.\n\n*linux-image-lowlatency: I think this is intended for eg, audio editing where low latency is important (see Why choose a low latency kernel over a generic or realtime one? ).\n\n\nAs to the folders in /usr/src, all these different kernels are actually very similar except for a few options, so most the the headers are stored in the non-specific /usr/src/linux-headers-x.y.z. The specific folder /usr/src/linux-headers-x.y.z-generic (or -server, -lowlatency) etc consists mostly of links to /usr/src/linux-headers-x.y.z, plus any files (eg .config) changed compared to the non-specific version (to avoid duplication if you have multiple flavours of the same kernel version installed).\n\nA: \nWhy do I have those two linux folders in /usr\n\nThose are the header files for the kernel(s) you have on your system. Both can be removed through apt-get (do not do it manually). (probably sudo apt-get purge linux-image-3.8.0-29)\n\nWhat exactly is generic version of ubuntu ? how it differes from other versions?\n\n\"generic\" means the general usage kernel. It is the kernel used for desktop installations. Before 12.04 we also had a \"generic-pae \", \"server\" and \"virtual\" version next to \"generic\" but that distinction was removed. Nowadays we have \"omap\" (Kernel for TI OMAP3 and OMAP4) and \"highbank\" (Kernel for Calxeda Highbank).\nIn general the difference are optimal setttings for that specific hardware.

I recently had several problems with ubuntu (like lost password etc) , so i tried booting through the recovery mode .\nBut unfortunately, everytime i run the recovery mode it loads up some processes and then freezes , as in nothing happens after that , it just keeps on waiting there.\nmy specs are:\nubuntu 12.04 LTS\nRelease 12.04 (precise) 64-bit\nKernel Linux 3.2.0-58-generic\nGNOME 3.4.2\nIntel® Core™ i5-3210M CPU @ 2.50GHz × 4 \n\nA: If normal booting works, just the recovery mode freezes then it is possible that the recovery mode's kernel command line is causing the problem. Either it has an option which causes this error or it is missing one.\nBy default the recovery mode's kernel command line doesn't contain the \"quite splash\" parameters but contain the \"recovery nomodeset\" parameters. If you added extra parameters to your normal boot in the /etc/default/grub file, then those are also missing from the recovery mode's kernel command line. Obviously the \"quiet splash\" is not needed in recovery but the \"recovery\" is needed.\nSo at first I advise you to remove the nomodeset parameter from the recover modes kernel command line and try to boot with that setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*While in GRUB and on the recovery menu entry press E to edit the menu entry.\n\n*Remove the nomodeset parameter from the line starting with linux.\n\n*Press CTRL+X to boot with the modified kernel command line.\n\n\nIf this doesn't solve it please upload your /boot/grub/grub.cfg file so we can see what other options are present on your normal kernel command line what maybe necessary also in the recovery's. (Or you can examine it yourself and add them to your recovery command line.)\nTo make the changes permanent you will have to edit the /etc/grub.d/10_linux file, search for the nomodeset word in the file and delete them. (Best is to make a backup of this file before you edit it, just in case as always.)

I want to replace it with Ubuntu 13.10. For the same, please approve whether my approach mentioned below is right!\nI have created a bootable usb stick having Ubuntu 13.10. Before proceeding ahead I would like to add how I prepared my usb stick. Using fdisk, I deleted all the partitions on the stick. I Created only 1 new partition to occupy whole 2GB of space of my usb stick. Then using mkfs created file system of ext4 type. Then using unetbootin created bootable ubuntu 13.10 from its iso.\nWhen my laptop boots from the usb, the below options are displayed as shown in the photo. (Its not having the option for erasing the current O.S. Rather it has option for erasing the whole disk!!!)\n\nI will select the option of ' something else' & proceed. Then I will delete /dev/sda5 (/boot) & /dev/sda6 (/) & swap partition & create the same partitions (/boot , / & swap) by allocating sizes. ( I think there is no compulsion to create home partition & so I wont create ).Then I will proceed to install 13.10 on these newly created partitions. After the installation completes, I will login to the 13.10 O.S. Then I will delete all files & folders under /home directory. Then I will edit /etc/fstab to mount the previous home partition /dev/sda8 (this I currently have on 13.04) on /home directory. Is that a right way please?\nAlso, may I create btrfs file systems this time rather than ext4 for the /boot & / partitions? This fs is new & I should try it out to see how it's better.\n\nA: First of all, do backups. They are never extras. Then check twice and thrice what you are doing. Verify that the partitions you are removing are the ones you want to remove, by the way, is not necessary that you remove the partitions, just format them.\nIf you want, you can reuse the old /home just unticking the format option in the Something Else dialog. That will save you a step. Don't use btrfs for /boot, but ext4. BTRFS is still experimental and may have problems if you use it for GRUB.\n\nA: \"(Its not having the option for erasing the current O.S. Rather it has option for erasing the whole disk!!!)\" \nThis answer is only a tangential recommendation. Never trust automatic partitioning options in Ubuntu installers, as you may end up with nasty surprises. When installing Ubuntu I always prepare the partitions manually (as you seem to be planning to to do). \nSee Should I choose to Install alongside windows 8 or something else for an example on how manual partitioning can be approached.\n\nA: I am assuming you want to preserve your personal files in the /home directory.  This will only be possible if you do a system upgrade with the Ubuntu upgrade software or if you have a separate disk partition for /home and you manually parition your disk when you install Ubuntu.  \nWhen you select \"Something else\" at installation, simply set the /, SWAP, and /home paritions to their proper mount points (you can check these with the gnome-disk-utility included with Ubuntu, so take note as to which is sda1, sda2, etc.).  Choose only the / partition to be formated.  This will preserve your /home partition with your personal data, but will erase all Ubuntu system files and most applications you installed on top of Ubuntu 13.04.  \nI like having a separate /home partition and I wish Ubuntu did this by default; this would make re-installing much nicer, so I now partition my disks manually when I install Ubuntu.  Depending on your disk size, I would give 10GB-30GB to the / partition.  My Arch Linux install with GNOME 3.10 has 28GB for / with 21GB currently free.\nOf course, you should always backup your data: the more important it is, the more copies and different places you should keep it!\n\nA: If you have other computer with windows installed, or you have some neighbor,try to make bootable USB using Universal USB Installer. Sometimes,when I want to create bootable USB drive on Ubuntu,it won't work,but with this tool on windows,newer failed.\nYou can always try to upgrade your Ubuntu from 13.04 to 13.10. I think that this is best option for you,because you'll keep all your files and apps from previous version.\n", "Q: How to set the timeout for sudo asking for password?

Restoring Android will not restore this data.\n\nSo, if you want to contribute to Ubuntu and help out testing, and know your way around smartphones, Android and Ubuntu, go ahead. However, if you expect a smoothly running system without flaws, I would suggest for you to wait a little.\n\nA: As already written in Malte Skoruppa's answer, a tool exists and has it's own Wiki page.\nIf you know how to unlock, backup and flash a (factory) image to your phone by using Android development tools like fastboot and adb, and this is what you do anyway, you can give it whirl.\nFrom what I have seen on my device, this particular implementation seems to replace the recovery image with Ubuntu Touch on the device. So usually your phone boots into Android unless you tell it to boot into recovery by key combo at boot or via commands/app, which boots Ubuntu Touch.\n\nA: I am using Multirom to kind of dual boot. It is an android app. You can also easily install Ubuntu Touch through this app but you should root Nexus 4(or install CyanogenMod) \n", "Q: I'm having issues w/12.04 and want to remove it I built and installed 12.04 about 3 years ago.  I have a 1T hard drive and 4G of ram...nothing special, but it ran great. But then, I ran into an issue where my internet started acting up, so I made some adjustments removing some plug-ins that I felt were unneeded; too many programs junking up my computer. Then I started to have issues with the password...none of these things should have affected one another. But now the issues were starting to build.  However, being the semi-tech savvy person that I am, I researched the issues and nothing. So, I assumed that there must be a bad plug-in that started all of these issues. I have tried to repair and reinstall and now I have the 12.04 LTS as my OS, but now, when I start up, it still has issues.  Start up; logs in automatically, I try to use the internet, it doesn't run at all...it just sits there.  I log out and try to log back in; tells me there's a passwords error.  So it won't let me log in, even though I KNOW that the password is correct and I have to reboot and then it lets me in.  SMH...So, I want to remove 12.04 all together!

But, I am getting conflicting information about how to do so.\nBut, bc I wasn't raised on DOS based systems...I need help. \n\nA: If you want to remove 12.4 and replace it with 13.10, and if you don't have files which you need to save, the best way to replace it is to clean install ubuntu 13.10. It's like the first time you installed ubuntu 12.04.

Looking for PAM modules, you'll find alternative ways to authenticate, and playing with PAM configuration, you'll be able to enable / disable thoses modules depending on the context.\nFor example, you can have a look at pam-face-authentication.\nAnother alternative is using Fingerprint readers with libpam-fprintd (see here)\nEach pam module provides integration guide, but beware, it's quite easy to lock you out of your system when playing with PAM configuration!\n", "Q: How to configuring which Packages should be removed on Ubuntu Installation? On Ubuntu installation not all packages on Live Session (Try Ubuntu) were installed on the Ubuntu,some are removed.\nHow i can configure which packages should be removed on an installation ?\n(Example : I want to keep GParted from Live Session and not removed on Installation)\n\nA: Changing the installer (the ISO) is a LOT of work (look at my and other answers here in how messy this can get: How to customize the Ubuntu Live CD? )  It is also one-time only so you will need to do this with every new release. \nFor adding software during installation have a look at \"kickstart\". It is not 100% supported by Ubuntu but you can add a seed file. Example file.\nHere are some tips: How do I create a completely unattended install of Ubuntu? You can create a config file for adding software. Last time I used this it did NOT have a method on how to remove packages.\nA working kickstart file can be re-used when a new release arrives. But it is also a pain to setup correctly (to test you must install with the kickstart file and failure means you wasted a lot of time). \nBut there is an easier method: you can add gParted to your installation after installation. Just do: \nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nI have a post-installation script with lots of package names in it that I run after installation. It is the best method to configuring your system to what you want. I myself always install mysql, smplayer, vlc and shutter. All I do is execute a text file with lots of 'apt-get's in the file. \nThis is something you can repeat after every install and it requires the least amount of maintenance. Pseudo example:\nsudo apt-get install vlc\n   sudo apt-get install gparted\n   sudo apt-get remove totem\nSave it, make it executable, run it after the installation and all you need to do is provide the password 1 time and it will install/remove all you added to the text file.\nI have played alot with creating my own ISO installer, played with kickstart but none of them come as close as just a plain text file with some apt-gets in it. \n", "Q: Add asymmetrical margin on LCD display? My old laptop display is starting to break, and I have many dead pixels and other physical issues on the left side of the screen only.

With the alsamixer is also possible to change the gain setting.\nTo fix the broken pipe error, add options snd-usb-audio ignore_ctl_error=1 at the end of alsa-base.conf:\nsudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf\n\nadd options snd-usb-audio ignore_ctl_error=1, save and close. \nalsa force-reload\n\nthen\nalsamixer\n\npress F6 and select \"Xonar U7\", now you can change the \"Speaker Front\" value to increase/decrease the headphone output gain.\n\nA: It works perfectly in Ubuntu with ALSA, but only with the minimum gain setting (I can't figure out how to change the default gain setting). BTW, this card has the lowest noise I ever seen: it's practically noiseless!\n\nA: The U7 soundcard is supported, yet I've noticed on my PC that the multimedia keys (configured to use amixer) to raise or lower the volume don't work as they do with my internal xonar DX. I wonder if it's a conflict with this one already installed in my pc which (unlikely) could be resolved by removing or disabling the DX...\n\nA: I have one, it works, but it's not something you should look forward to.

It works out of the box though, but yeah, if you're looking for better quality sound, I would say get something that's not ubuntu or become software developer to make your own drivers. \n", "Q: autocomplete at desktop level I often type the same words in several applications:\n\n\n*\n\n*Editor (emacs, vi)\n\n*Webbrowser\n\n*Shells\n\n\nIt would be great to have an autocomplete of the words I typed during the last week available in all the above applications.\nEach of them has a way to improve the typing speed. But something at desktop level would be the best.\nExample: \"Continuous Integration\". I want a fast way to type this word without changing the program which receives the input.\nIs there already something like this?\n\nA: The solution to your request is Input Method.\nWhat you have described is something familiar to most CJK language users.   Let's review how input method works in current Linux systems.\nThe Input Method system\nHere's a simple architecture for a common input method system:\n\nNOTE: I snapshot this image from The X Input Method Protocol. Some of the arrows are irrelevant to following discussion.\nHistorically, XIM (the X Input Method protocol) was the only protocol. It's overly complex and lacks some desired features. So it's mostly abandoned, though compatibility is still provided by popular toolkits like GTK, Qt.\nA modern input method system contains several parts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Client-side library support  \n\n\n*\n\n*typically implemented as a module loaded by toolkits (e.g. for GTK, see /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gtk-3.0/3.0.0/immodules/)\n\n\n*Input method server  \n\n*X server\n\n\nHow do these parts fit together?\nA user types a key. X server receives the hardware event from evdev interface, composes a XEvent and sends to the application under keyboard focus. The application toolkit (GTK, Qt) input method module intercepts the event and passed the info to input method server. The input method server figures what the user may want and passes some text back to the IM module.\nNow, let's talk about the architecture of the IM server.\nAn IM server typically consists of two parts:  \n\n\n*\n\n*An IM framework which handles platform specific intricacies and provides a nice interface to IM engine and toolkit IM modules. It provides the IPC mechanisms used by the IM module, server and engine.  \n\n*Various IM engines do the actual work of transforming user-typed keys to desired text. IM engines can be shared libraries loaded by the IM server or independent processes communicating to the IM server.\n\n*Auxiliary input method configuration programs provides friendly user interface for customizing the IM server and engine behaviors.\n\n\nAll in all, what an IM does is to transform what you type to something different and optionally provide predictions. \nAn example\nWe use ibus-pinyin here to type some Chinese characters.\n \nThe romanization of 汉语拼音 is han yu pin yin. At, first you need to type all these letters to get the four Chinese characters. But after a few times, you just need to type the four initial characters h y p y to get the Chinese character.\nIn the ibus-pinyin case, han yu pin yin is shortened to h y p y.\nMore advanced IM engines utilize statistical learning techniques to provide better prediction. Nothing can stop you from writing a English input method engine to provide a typing boost.\nAs a bonus, all toolkits have input method support except some plain old X programs. So this is a quite universal solution.\n\nThanks to Anders F. U. Kiær.

I am trying to print to that printer from my 32-bit 12.04 Ubuntu laptop.The printer is shared by my windows computer and I installed it on my 12.04 Ubuntu laptop and it says it is accessible per the instructions from Ubuntu. I try to send a test print page to the printer and it gets sent ok and the printer starts as though it is going to print the test page but then it stops and the light on the printer stays blinking as though it is going to print. \nMost posts I've read on this say that I have to install the 32-bit drivers on my 64-bit systems and I try to do this following the the instructions from this web site http://www.labnol.org/software/share-printer-between-different-windows-computers/9530/. Every time I do this I get a pop up that says the drivers for thing device are not in the folder. I downloaded the 32-bit driver from the HP website.\nThis is on a home network with 3 Windows 7 computers (2 laptops with home edition(64-Bit) and 1 desktop with pro(64-Bit)) and the 12.04 32-bit Ubuntu laptop. Could it be a RAM issue in the laptop? I have 1.2Gigs in it right now of PC-2700 \n\nA: On the windows 7 computer where the printer is connected, go into Devices and Printers\nRight click on the printer you want to print to from the Ubuntu machine.\nLeft click on printer preferences, then in the window that pops up click on the Ports tab for the printer.\nLook for bi-directional printing and un-check the box next to it and save.

Therefore, if you want better graphical performance, please consider a new video card, after verifying you have the best driver for your existing graphics adapter.

Normally Windows has those in a separate 100MB (hidden) boot partition, but you do not show that partition or missing space for it.\nYou will have to move boot flag back to sda1 as Windows only repairs the partition with the boot flag. You can use gparted or with your Windows repairCD or flash drive the set active command. And then run Windows repairs to recreate the bootmgr & BCD. If you run auto repairs 3 times, it will also put the Windows boot loader back in and you have to use Boot-Repair or manual install to readd grub to MBR.\nThen the sudo update-grub will find Windows. Or Boot-Repair will run it also.\n", "Q: Simple GUI to display static text informations I would like to know if there is a way to write or modify a simple program (I don't really care what language it'll use) that can be launched in GUI mode and will display formated text and URL that will open in a web-browser by a simple clic.\nA good example of the program I would like to run is the \"About - Information\" window that can be found on most programs, example :\n\nIt has everything I look for :\n\n\n*\n\n*Simple windows using same theme as the DE\n\n*No menu\n\n*Possibility of displaying images\n\n*Formated text (bold, italic, font-size)\n\n*URL links with custom clickable name\n\n*Buttons (that one is not really important, it could be usefull but I'm afraid it's too hard to configure \"actions\" for my level in development)\n\n\n\nMy idea would be going for something like that (where orange is a URL link) :\n\nNote : I just drew that, it isn't an existing program. \n\nI unfortunately don't have time to learn a developer language like C++, Python, QT, but I can examine a file with gedit (or alike) and adapt the content, that shouldn't be really difficult as I have experience on looking at configuration files and modifying them, you know, to see what would happen if I change this or that. \nAre there any prebuilt code I could use and/or modify ? \nThanks \nPS: HTML would have been great but apparently there's no easy way to achieve this, nor prebuilt \"html interpretator non web-browser\" I could use. \n\nA: Why not using QML and the Ubuntu SDK to build such screens?

I also enabled Guest session option. My sister was using the Libre Office writer in the guest session, wrote a document and saved it. After restarting the laptop, she found that the document was not there. Even the history of firefox was cleared.\nEverything works fine with administrator account.\nIs it so that nothing is saved in guest session? If yes, How can I recover the files? Its pretty important! \n\nA: No, documents and data are deleted on reboot. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DesktopTeam/Specs/Intrepid/GuestAccount\n\nDocuments and Data are deleted on reboot\n\nfurthermore , by design, the guest session uses a tmpfs as home directory, and AppArmor rules completely hide /home, and give read-only access to /boot, /etc, /lib*, /opt, /root, /sbin, /srv, /usr, /var.\ntempfs is in RAM, so with reboot data is lost, no chance of recovery, no data is written to the hard drive.\nSorry you lost data, the only thing you can do is back up your data in the future as data loss happens from time to time for any number of reasons from power loss to bugs to hardware problems and thus you need to back up your valuable data.\n\nA: No solution for the data already lost. But next time, if anyone uses a guest session and has to save something, advise them to send it over web mail (gmail & such) or upload it to a file hosting service (Google Drive, Dropbox, & the like). That will keep the data in a non-volatile accessible place.\n", "Q: like pluma or gedit with spell-check I am a lousy speller. I like using pluma, and gedit because they open fast, and do just about everything I need. but automatic spell-check would be very nice.

I want to know what I am am spelling wrong, as I type. \nthe html web element \"textarea\" would be perfect, if it let me save, and warned me if I were about to close a not saved document.  \ncan gedit or pluma offer this?\n\nA: gedit is a text-editor that supports plugins. \nOne of the plugins is Spell: Checks the spelling of the current document. This plugin is shipped with Gedit by default, you can activate and desactivate it in the Options. \nOnce the plugin is activated, push Shift+F7 to activate the spell-check, or Tools > Spell-Check. \nYou can also activate automated spell-checking in the Tools menu. \n\nA: I have Pluma version 1.8.1.\nA spelling plugin is available.\nTo make sure it is selected as a Plugin, go to:\nEdit > Preferences > Plugins tab > Select \"Spell Checker\"\nThere is an option to set \"Autocheck spelling\" in the tools menu.

Searching a keyword in linux terminal using the locate command gives answer in a short time.\nWhat is the search algorithm used?\n\nA: The system creates a data base of all the files in the computer. So when you search trough locate the command doesn't really checks the whole file-system but only the database, it does a binary search algorithm which is fast like looking up a word in a dictionary.  That's why it's so fast (and handy).\nSuch database is updated regularly; you may have seen it work sometimes when you install a new package: updating mlocate.... You can find more information about how it works by executing in a terminal:\nman locate\n\nman updatedb\n\n\nA: It uses a database. The database searched by default is located at:\n/var/lib/mlocate/mlocate.db\n\nDownside of locate is that it is NOT real time.\nFrom the man page:\n\nDESCRIPTION\n         locate  reads  one or more databases prepared by updatedb(8) and writes\n         file names matching at least one of the PATTERNs  to  standard  output,\n         one per line.\n\n", "Q: Trine 2 on Ubuntu 13.10 Saucy 64-bit Having bought Trine 2 on the Humble Indie Bundle, I can play the game on Ubuntu 13.04 after having installed the ia32-libs package.\nThis package has been deprecated in Ubuntu 13.10 and the game no longer works from this version of Ubuntu.\nI have a done a fresh install and am unable to get the game working.

However, I have a Google Chromecast and like to stream Netflix to my TV.  In order for me to do this, I have to be watching Netflix IN CHROME.  I have yet to find a way that actually works to get Netflix streaming in Chrome on Ubuntu 13.10.  Does anyone have any insights?\n\nA: Pipelight is one of the more popular solutions and my chosen one, but it will not work with chrome versions newer that version 34. From version 35 onward chrome has dropped support for the netscape plugin api, which is the api that pipe light uses. Chrome now only supports the pepper plugin api, so I am not sure that you are going to be able to find anything to make it work unless the pipe light developers decide to support the pepper api which is unlikely and netflix will hopefully be switching away from silverlight in the near future.\nI know that isn't what you wanted to hear and isn't really a solution, but I thought that information might be useful. \nThe only thing that MIGHT work would be to run a windows version of chrome under WINE, but I'm not even sure if that is possible and it probably wouldn't run very well if at all. \n\nA: If you install pipelight with silverlight plug-in, chromium browser, user agent switcher and chromecast from google app-store, then it works.\nFollow the steps explained here:\nhttp://www.muktware.com/2014/03/watch-netflix-ubuntu-based-distributions/23091\n\nA: I haven't try this but hope it helps you, que guide is a little long and detailed so I recomend you to read once ot twice before tryin it.\nPipelight is project that brings Silverlight to any Linux browser that supports the Netscape Plugin API.

Make sure you're burning the entire IMAGE, and not the FILES in the image.\n\nA: When you burn a disc, you have to make sure the filesystem is closed in order to make it bootable (or 'mastered'). The CD can be closed or left open ('packet writing') and other uses. \n"]
