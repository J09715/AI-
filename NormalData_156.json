["Q: How to set default editor in 13.04? None of this, this nor this worked in setting my default editor. Haven't tried this, I'm afraid it won't work either.\nSo how do I set the default editor to emacs or possibly emacsclient in 13.04 through the CLI/terminal?\nDouble-clicking on a text file still opens up to gedit.\nI specifically say 13.04 because I had no problem in doing so in 11.04 from which I recently upgraded from.\n\nA: This is how you set default applications..\nPoint and click:\nRight click on the text file you want to open, choose Properties and then Open with. You should find Emacs in the Recommanded Software list. Click the Set as default button.\nUsing the commandline:\nIf you want to set default applications using the terminal, you use to XDG tool.\nxdg-mime default emacs23.desktop text/plain\n\nThen try to open a plain text document. \nIf you want to set default applications for the current user, edit this file: \n~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list\n\nTo edit global settings by hand, see this file: \n/usr/share/applications/default.list\n\nEdit: Thanks to Oli how made me aware of XDG in the comments below the question\n\nA: I have already asked a similar question about changing all the associations for Gedit to Sublime Text (another GUI editor).\nThat's essentially where you answer lies except instead of using a .desktop file for Sublime Text, you'll be adding one (if one doesn't exist) for Emacs and then just changing all the associations to that.\n\nA: Try this.  Just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo update-alternatives --config editor \n\nWhen it comes up choose your editor.  See image below.\n\n\nA: Go to system settings -> Details -> default applications and select Emacs as the default application for files. I did this yesterday and it works fine...\n", "Q: After Installing Ubuntu 13.04 Not able to see options for Windows 8 and Ubuntu at Start Up Today i installed Ubuntu along with Windows 8 on my HP laptop using DVD Drive (Boot from Internal DVD).\nDuring installation it said something like \"You need to have space of 1 MB or so for booting else also you can install it might give errors later\"\nIssue:\nNow i wont get option when systems boots up it directly goes to Windows 8.\nI have C Drive 320 GB for Windows, D as 8 GB for Swap, F as 16 GB for /home and 30 GB for Windows recovery.\nPlease help me, do i need to try boot repair with Try ubuntu option that i get when i boot from DVD?\nWaiting for response.\nI guess issue is related to MBR, i guess during my installation instead of writing to Windows MBR it wrote to F Drive?\nPlease help me.\n\nA: When you install, make room for \"/\" for all your system data.  It looks like you only allocated /home and swap space.  I'm guessing it said you have <1MB because there was no partition for /.  Here is a post on here about it.\nHere is documentation on it as well\nI personally use swap space, /, /home, and /boot.  But I think only the first two are required.\n", "Q: Why can't I resize partitions? I am trying to install Windows 7 (Ubuntu installed first).\nI try to resize my partition but everything is greyed out but unmount, info and manage flags.\nI am also using the partition I am trying to resize.\nAnd im not trying to dual boot\n\nA: Mounted partitions cannot be re-sized. Umouont the partition and you will be able to re-size it.\nAlan\n\nA: You cannot resize mounted partitions. To resize your Ubuntu partition (or any mounted partition for that matter) you will need to boot into a liveCD/liveUSB. From the live environment you should be able to resize your partition to your hearts content. hope this helps!\n", "Q: GDB crashes with: ImportError: No module named libstdcxx.v6.printers I have a problem with GDB. Whenever I try to debug any C++ program, just after running it, GDB gives this error:\n(gdb) run\nStarting program: /home/errikos/Workspaces/tests/a.out \nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/lib/debug/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6.0.18-gdb.py\", line 59, in <module>\n    from libstdcxx.v6.printers import register_libstdcxx_printers\nImportError: No module named libstdcxx.v6.printers\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/lib/debug/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6.0.18-gdb.py\", line 59, in <module>\n    from libstdcxx.v6.printers import register_libstdcxx_printers\nImportError: No module named libstdcxx.v6.printers\n\nAfter that, GDB continues running (ie. does not crash completely).\nI am aware that there are several bug reports about this (here, here and here). In the second report, there is also a claim that there is a fix released. In the third one, there is a symlink workaround, that did not work for me (and which I do not like, even if it worked).\nHas anyone found a workaround for this? Any missing package?\nNote: I have the Ubuntu Toolchain test builds (ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test) PPA activated.\n\nA: This is a bug in /usr/lib/debug/usr/lib/$triple/libstdc++.so.6.0.18-gdb.py; if it were operating correctly, you would only see the ImportError once, and the pretty-printers would work.\nSee http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=701935#18 for some information about what's going wrong here.  This worked okay in Debian's gcc-4.7, but until recently did not work in gcc-4.8 on Debian.  I'm not sure if I even tried this with gcc-4.6.\nRegardless, you can patch that file to look in the right place.\n", "Q: What does installing Ubuntu \"alongside\" Windows entail? I recently posted a question about an error I was receiving trying to access Ubuntu from the boot menu. I am using Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.x (I THINK because I haven't accessed it in over a year due to being unable to run an important program for one of my classes on Ubuntu). \nOn another laptop, I partitioned the hard drive and installed Windows and Ubuntu on the partitions. On this laptop, I simply installed Ubuntu from Windows, picking the option alongside Windows, and didn't partition my hard drive manually. I was under the impression that \"alongside\" entailed Ubuntu partitioning my hard drive, and that if I were to return my Windows partition to factory settings it would not affect the Ubuntu partition. However, given my current problem, I am wondering if I was mistaken in this assumption? \nWhen installing Ubuntu from Windows, selecting alongside Windows as the option from the Ubuntu installer, does that simply install Ubuntu within the Windows partition and thus returning it to factory settings would wipe out anything I had on the Ubuntu OS as well? \nUbuntu is still in the boot menu as an option, but when I try to access it it says the drive is \"corrupt\" and wubi is mentioned in the error. \nI additionally tried to download a program ran from Windows to investigate partitions and there were no sign of my Ubuntu partition viewable from Windows. Is it possible Windows just can't see it?\nAny insights, corrections or answers are appreciated. \n\nA: This is called WUBI. Wubi creates a virtual Ubuntu inside Windows. Imagine it as a virtual machine you need to reboot into. You can still boot to both from the Windows Boot Manager, but there is no second partition. About the corruption, run CHKDSK from Windows, then, go into your Programs and Features > Add Remove Programs and uninstall Ubuntu. Run another CHKDSK. Finally, reinstall Ubuntu through WUBI\nWubi does not work (is unsupported) on systems later than Ubuntu 14.04.\nIf Ubuntu is not on your install list, there is a HUGE problem. Disregard all above instructions and:\n\n\n*\n\n*(From Windows) Open a command line as Administrator\n\n*(From Windows) Run command bcdedit. Locate the Ubuntu entry. Find the identifier and take note of it.\n\n*(From Windows) Run command bcdedit /delete <id from step 2>\n\n*Download Ubuntu 12.04. Burn the ISO. Pop it in, click WUBI, go through everything.\n\n", "Q: What version? dell inspiron 910 8GB I'm new to Ubuntu and planning to install it on my Dell Inspiron 910, because in Windows XP some random updates ate all my 8GB storage (SSD).\nEven after stripping down XP to the bone, I'm unable to install any of the updates due to no storage space available. Therefore, I've decided to install Ubuntu instead.\nAfter doing research, I came across various versions of Ubuntu. \nFirst it was 32bit / 64bit. And then, I found Lubuntu, Xubuntu, etc. I have tried Lubuntu from a live disk which did not help me to connect with WiFi (known problem I assume). After some reading I realized, there were different specifications of the Ubuntu versions, especially about disk space that each version requires. In my case, it is pretty important. So, given the fact I only have 8GB SSD.\nWhich one will be most suitable for me?\n\nA: Without knowing your system specification I can only speculate which distribution would be suitable for you. If you want an Ubuntu / Debian based OS then you could try Linux Mint. \nTheir system requirements for their latest version, needs about 5GB so it would still leave you with some room to install a few apps, but not a lot. \nI would recommend installing the Xfce version (last one in the list) as its a bit more lightweight. \nAlso again, guessing the hardware is old only use 32-bit of any distribution as 64-bit is only really for newer machines.  \nHope this helps and let me know how it all goes. \n\nA: I have installed Lubuntu 32-bit once a 8GiB SSD disk in a netbook. \nLubuntu needs around 2.4GiB space. You can install the programs you need (libre office, etc) and clean up the cache and remove any old kernels, this will consume no more than 5GiB. So you are left with 3GiB for other stuff. \nIt may be prudent to try and see if the 32bit Lubuntu liveCD runs on your hardware, before you install it.\n\nA: That computer has an Atom N270, which is 32bit only.  If you didn't get WiFi with the Lubuntu LiveCD, try it with a full Ubuntu LiveCD (or here's a windows tool for making a LiveUSB key), or try a different Ubuntu version.\n", "Q: Alert when a wifi network is detected? Is there any way to play a sound to alert me when a wifi(wireless) network is detected?\n\nA: The problem is that there is no a specific program/service/daemon to check when a new wireless network appear/disappear in/from the range of the wireless antenna as far as I know (in fact there is airodump-ng and maybe others, but this conflicts with Network Manager).\nAs alternative, you can scan for wifi networks from time to time, using iwlist tool.\n\nNote: In tests iwlist tool may only work with Atheros, Intel or Broadcom cards.\n\nThese being said, the following script can do what you wish (I named it wifidetect):\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#wifidetect - Alert when new wireless \n\n#Licensed under the standard MIT license:\n#Copyright 2013 Radu Rădeanu (http://askubuntu.com/users/147044/).\n#Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n#The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n#THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

My Laptop\nDell Inspiron N5110\nUbuntu and Windows 7\nI installed Ubuntu 13.04 in my laptop, but its seemed to be slower than Windows 7 and i am completely surprised , i feel shamed in front of my friend because i told him that Ubuntu is best and Fastest Linux based operating system.\nWhat is roaming in my mind?\nUbuntu > version 10.x is slower and have a lot of problems in it.\nWhat are problems/questions?\n\n\n*\n\n*Why my WiFi is slower in Ubuntu 13.04 than windows 7?\n\n*Why performance speed is slower than windows 7?\n\n*Why Ubuntu > version 10.x is slow?\n\n*Why Ubuntu newer version consume more laptop battery energy?\nIs these problems are due to unity? I notice Gnome is faster than unity.\n\n\nA: There is a lot of missing details here.\nTo be able to be more specific and maybe give you solutions you need to give us the brand and model of the Laptop.\nQuick Answer : Search for your computer brand and model with ubuntu/xubuntu.\nSome generic answers can be made to your questions:\n\nWhy my WiFi is slower in Ubuntu 13.04 than windows 7?\n\nThis is weird, you should not have that kind of trouble with Ubuntu. Have you tried with the latest Ubuntu ? If not search for your trouble and specify the brand/model of your wifi adapter (you can have it usually by typing lspci on a terminal)\n\nWhy performance speed is slower than windows 7?\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If you are talking about the boot time: there is some hardware functions that are not yet well supported by Linux and others that are exclusive to Windows (Like some cache accelerator technology). However the lack of those technology impacts mainly only the boot time and not the performance.\n\n*If you are talking about using it and it seems slower: Ubuntu has made a technological choice by preferring User Experience to Performance. Unity is a development made by Ubuntu to fulfill that purpose. If you are more focused on having performance, install XUbuntu instead of Ubuntu. It uses XFCE that is more optimized than Unity or Gnome 3.\n\n\n\nWhy Ubuntu > version 10.x is slow?\n\nMaybe you'll find your answer in what I've already written. \nYou must also know that, by looking your CPU kind, you must have the latest version \"13.04\". Intel has changed a lot of things since that CPU model got out. If your computer is recent then you have the latest chipset of Intel witch changes a lot of things. One of them is the possibility to have two graphic cards : the Intel one and the amd or nvidia one. The Intel one is normally for common use and the other is for 3d. This choice is made by the drivers.\nWhile the Intel graphic card is well supported, the amd or nvidia is still badly supported by open source drivers. You must look about how to install the proprietary drivers of your graphic card.\nThe 10.X part of your question can be explained with that before there weren't nvidia drivers with the ubuntu and then you used only the Intel GPU. Now you are using the Nvidia one but with slow drivers.\n\nWhy Ubuntu newer version consume more laptop battery energy? Is these problems are due to unity? I notice Gnome is faster than unity.\n\nYour power consumption is surely due to the use of your amd/nvidia graphic card with Intel GPU behind. I don't remember the name for amd but take a look if you have optimus (nvidia) technology. If yes you must configure bumblebee\nUnity and Gnome 3 have the goal to give good user experience by using your GPU most of the time. Try Xubuntu if you want something that is faster and with the same old interface. Unity and Gnome 3 will tend to use lot more power consumption (due to it's heavy graphic use)\n", "Q: Attaching to a service in screen I am fairly new to Ubuntu, but I am becoming better everyday. I know that to detach from a service in screen you do Ctrl+a+d. But I do not know how to attach back to it when I need to. \nCan someone tell me what the command is to attach back to running screen services?\n\nA: If you need information on how to use a certain command, check out the corresponding man page. For screen, simply type man screen in terminal. Also, for some programs more detailed information, often complete manuals, can be found on the info pages (in this case: info screen). The screen man page gives the answer to your question:\nscreen -r\n\nIf you need to know which sessions are running, run screen -ls. Then you can reattach with screen -r <pid.tty.host>, where pid.tty.host is given by screen -ls.\n", "Q: Raid volumes not recognized Ubuntu 12.04 on HP ENVY dv6 I have installed Ubuntu 12.04 on my HP envy dv6 but I get a message every time I boot the system that RAID volumes are not recognized. After a time out of 10 secs the boot continues to grub menu and then boots up normally. I would like to know how can I solve this problem and how can I identify RAID volumes on my Ubuntu. \n\nA: Did you start with clean disks with no partition table on it or did you reuse the disks. This can be the reason why your system won't boot. Guess how I know.\nFirst clean your disks with:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/yourdev bs=512 count=1\nreplace yourdev with the device name of your disks\nThen install Ubuntu again.

This is my first laptop with Ubuntu and it seems I've made a mess with the system since then. I was just wondering if I could erase and start over with a fresh copy since is no such option to restore to factory command similar to Windows. I recently upgraded it, even-though I had no idea what I was doing and it changed from 10.04 to 12.04. But the power cord came out, and battery died while I was asleep. Regardless, I should say that the upgrade went half. Nevertheless, I logged-in finally, but now all kinds of errors pops-up as I have duplicate things going on. All I wanted is to start from scratch with fresh install. How can I achieve this??\n\nA: Christina,  At least your are trying.  I will give you my best answer for now, since I don't know exactly what you are working with.  For starters, do you have a DVD player or are you using only usb? Reference: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop \nIf you are using a DVD, you will want to download the iso image for your chip, (32bit or 64bit). If you can still use the operating system, burn the ISO and run the disk.  If you are using usb, you will have to create a bootable usb device. Reference: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu\nYou will have to make adjustments in your bios, select your boot device.  Once you get the correct device selected to boot, you will be able to follow the directions to install our software. When you get to the part that ask you how you want to install it, choose erase and use the entire disk. \nHopes this helps you.\nJim\n", "Q: How can i remove firefox user data folder from ubuntu 13.04? How can i remove firefox user data folder from ubuntu 13.04?\nMy firefox is too slow whenever it get slows on my other operating system i just simply remove userdata folder but how can i remove from ubuntu 13.04?\n\nA: You need to first delete your firefox user data folder , using following command in Terminal , you can able delete firefox user data folder:\n\nrm -rf ~/.mozilla/firefox/.default\n\nWhere  is the name of your profile that firefox generates random.\n\nA: What I do is simply open home folder and delete mozilla folder.

You will then have to reset firefox like you would if you just installed it.Some times removing some add ons will speed it up.(If you have a lot installed)\n", "Q: No ubuntu 12.04 toolbar when installed through VMware workstation I just installed Ubuntu 12.04 inside VMware workstation.  I'm new to both VMware and Ubuntu.  When I open Ubuntu up, there's no menu anywhere.  Is I move my mouse around, I can see that it's highlighting toolbar options on the leftside, but I can't tell what those options are.  I can click and open things up, but that isn't very helpful.  I've tried changing the background image, but that doesn't fix it.  Any idea how to make the toolbar show up?  Is it because I'm running it through VMware workstation?\n\nA: I had the same problem as you.

I noticed that some files downloaded from the internet have executing permission (e.g. Tor, Bit-torrent, Sync etc.) by default.\nTherefore the permission information is stored within the files itself, but not on the computer.\nDoes that mean, that there's a possibility for hackers to create viruses and set execute permission?\nIf that's so, hackers could trick the user to execute the virus.\nFrom this point of view, security on Linux is not better than Windows.\nCan someone explain this clearly to me?\n\nA: No. Whenever you create a new file the umask is applied. This umask is a number that dictates what permissions will the file have.\nFor having execution permission masks should be either 7, 5 or 3. No file is created with those masks. But, beware of compressed files, since those keeps their file permission when you extract them. If you keep downloading things from trusted sources and verify the content before doing anything, you should be alright.\nLet's see how umask works:\nFor files the default mask is 0666 and the umask is 0022. The system each time you create a file do this operation:\nmask - umask = file permissions\n0666 - 0022  = 0644\n\nThe permissions numbers broken down is like follows:\n0644\n^^^^\n||||\n|||\\_ others permissions, in this case only read\n|| \\__ groups permissions, in this case only read\n| \\___ user permissions, in this case read and write\n \\__ special byte\n\nHence, each file created by your user is created so you can read and write the file, your group can read them, and others can read them too. Nothing to do with the executables.\n", "Q: Installing Lubuntu on a PPC Mac Pro I have a Mac Pro (PPC Model, G3 Quicksilver) that I would like to run Lubuntu on.

This means it can be less suitable for calling from a script (credit: already mentioned in a comment by Wernight).\nThe prompts can be suppressed by passing null arguments:\n adduser --disabled-password --gecos \"\" USER\n\n\n\n*useradd allows you to pass multiple additional groups to add a user to by means of the -G option.  adduser seems to require that you call the command once for each group to add.\n\nA: The biggest different between using adduser and useradd is:\n\n\n*\n\n*With adduser command, the home folder for the user will be created as default.\n\n*With useradd command, there is no home folder for the user.\n\n\nSo I suggest you to use adduser instead of using useradd.\n\nA: I'll also point out that adduser does not always have the -M option and also does not respect the --system flag which specifically says:\n\nNote that useradd will not create a home directory for such an user, regardless of the default setting in /etc/login.defs (CREATE_HOME). You have to specify the -m options if you want a home directory for a system account to be created.\n\nIf you're trying to create a system user without a home directory then use useradd --system -M.\n\nA: The adduser interactive way to creates accounts and pwd with single command. Which can be only found in the Debian family distros.\nBoth adduser & useradd do the same functionality; with few differences in favour of adduser.\nWhen creating a user with adduser it will automatically encrypt the user home directory ( with permission of 755 ).\n", "Q: How can I hook my Ubuntu laptop through HDMI into a TV as a second monitor, but only use the speakers on the TV? I have a laptop that is hooked up to a very large TV as a second monitor and everything works just perfectly, the problem is I use the TV to play music in the background while I work on my laptop. This is great and all, except the TV is LCD and I'm worried about burn-in. Is there a way to make the part of the desktop on the TV blank so no images burn into it while I'm on it for a long time?\nEDIT: I guess I'm not being very clear. I know exactly how to make my tv act as a second monitor and play sound through it, the problem is I can't leave it plugged into my tv for long because the image will burn into it. Is there any way to have a screensaver of a fullscreen moving image on just one screen to avoid such burn-in?\n\nA: No worries: LCD does not experience burn-in. Plasma displays will experience burn-in, but not LCD.\nAnother option would be to run audio cables into the TV when you are not using it as a display.\n", "Q: unable to burn ubuntu 13.04 in mac I can't burn ubuntu 13.04 iso on a dvd because it has a hybrid boot system and my mac doesn't recognize it. is there a way around it?\n\nA: use a burning software for mac and do a 1to1 copy\nI'm not a mac owner  you have to make a google query  or use \nThis list\n\nA: I had this same problem a few minutes ago...I noticed that the downloading of the ISO ended a little sooner than I thought. It said \"10 mins left\" in the browser, 766mb/785mb, and a second later it finished downloading and it wouldn't burn. Must be a problem with the ubuntu servers.

Why playback channels are mono?\nHere is my alsamixer screenshot:\nOutput 3/4 is off but both outputs are playing sound now. And I can`t switch it off.\n\nA: The ICE1724 chip was originally designed for big multi-channel cards where all inputs and outputs are used at the same time, so it is not possible to use the outputs as completely separate devices.\nThe Mono describes the mixer control itself, not the audio device.\nalsamixer shows the mixer controls implemented by the hardware.\nThe Windows driver implements additional controls by doing an additional software processing step in the driver.\nIt might be possible to do the same in Linux with some audio server like PulseAudio, as described in Splitting front/rear:\n\nConnect speakers to front analog output and headphones to rear output. It would be usefull to split front/rear to separate sinks. Add to /etc/pulse/default.pa:\nload-module module-remap-sink sink_name=speakers remix=no master=alsa_output.pci-0000_05_00.0.analog-surround-40 channels=2 master_channel_map=front-left,front-right channel_map=front-left,front-right\nload-module module-remap-sink sink_name=headphones remix=no master=alsa_output.pci-0000_05_00.0.analog-surround-40 channels=2 master_channel_map=rear-left,rear-right   channel_map=front-left,front-right\n\n(replace alsa_output.pci-0000_05_00.0.analog-surround-40 in the sound card name shown from pacmd list-sinks)\n\n\nA: The problem is solved.\nThanks to CL. I tried to solve it with PulseAudio.\nFirst of all I installed pavucontrol. Then I made ~/.asoundrc (Alsa config file) and pasted the following into the file :\npcm.pulse {\n    type pulse\n}\nctl.pulse {\n    type pulse\n}\npcm.!default {\n    type pulse\n}\nctl.!default {\n    type pulse\n}\n\nIt makes PulseAudio to be used by default.\nAnd after that I can manage both outputs of the soundcard separately with pavucontrol. Now it`s possible. Finally Otput 1/2 is named Analog Output , Output 3/4 - Digital Output in Volume Control.\nI used  https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PulseAudio/Examples#Advanced_ALSA_Configuration for information.\n", "Q: I can't use my ubuntu software center?

In the video scopes it shows 2 of my movies in my ~/Videos/Movies(/Media/Videos/Movies) folder. When I have some 20 movies in there. The scope wont show my TV shows either under ~/Videos/TV_Shows/. I want it to show up with as in the scopes where it says \"My Videos\" as \"Movies\" and a second one under that as \"TV Shows\" Setup as seasons where you click on a season and it shows all the episodes.\nHow do I go about doing this?\n\nA: You can customise the results by writing new scopes, but that is probably not the answer you're looking for (here's a tutorial for doing so using the Ubuntu 13.10 API).\nThe default videos scope does not provide any hooks to alter its results in the way you've described.  If the existing scope is ignoring some of your videos under ~/Videos though, that sounds like a bug (and should probably be reported as such).  Is there anything unusual about your system?\n", "Q: How to remove the mate terminal icon from the Dash home? I uninstalled Mate, but the terminal is still in dash home. I click on it, and nothing opens. Is there any way I can remove it?\n\nA: The easiest way is just run apt-get autoremove to remove any extra package:\nsudo apt-get --purge autoremove mate-core mate-desktop-environment\n\nThis should remove any package that are related to mate in any way.\n\nA: It looks like MATE has been removed but left a .desktop file. \nJust run this command in a terminal:\nsudo -H nautilus /usr/share/applications\n\nThen find the MATE terminal file with the same name and icon of the one you found in the Dash home and delete it.\n", "Q: How To Rename Multiple Photos and Videos Based on EXIF Data? I often import photos and videos (mostly having JPG and MOV extensions) from digital cameras and tablets to my PC, and I would ideally like to see them sorted according to the dates and times they were taken already present in their EXIF data. And hence my wish to rename them all preferably using a simple Nautilus Script by preferably inserting the date and time stamps before each filename.\nI have so far managed only to bring together the following Nautilus Script, which I believe is far from perfect:\nfor i in *.*\ndo\nmv -i \"$i\" \"$(exiftool -CreateDate \"$i\" | awk -F ': ' '{print $2}')_\"$i\"\" \ndone\n\nWhat I don't like in this renaming method is the colons used in EXIF date and time stamps (e.g. \"2013:09:03 20:55:09_IMG_0108.JPG\") which might create problems when transferring these files later to other environments (e.g. Windows).\nThis command (using exiv2 instead of exiftool) conveniently enables manipulation of date and time stamps but its drawback is that it doesn't work on video (e.g. MOV) files:    \nexiv2 -k -r '%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S_:basename:' rename \"$i\"\n\nSo I'm hoping someone can come up with a better solution. And it would be magic if it even managed to convert the original filenames and extensions to lowercase as well! \n\nA: \nWhat I don't like in this renaming method is the colons used in EXIF date and time stamps (e.g. \"2013:09:03 20:55:09_IMG_0108.JPG\") which might create problems when transferring these files later to other environments (e.g. Windows).\n\nYou could run the naming scheme through sed, to replace the colons with dashes and spaces with underscores, like so:\nmv -i \"$i\" \"$(exiftool -CreateDate \"$i\" | awk -F ': ' '{print $2}' | sed -e 's/:/-/g' -e 's/ /_/g')_$i\"\n\nAs for making the whole thing lowercase, you could use rename:\nrename 's/(.*)/\\L$1/' file.JPG\n##  or\nrename 's/(.*)/\\L$1/' *.*\n\nOr you could do it within your script using sed, as in:\nj=$(echo \"$i\" | sed -e 's/\\(.*\\)/\\L\\1/')\n\n...and then use the $j variable in place of the final $i of your mv line. This sed way is slightly more portable (if that matters to you) as different linux distros have different rename commands, while sed is universal.\nOr, alternatively, the script can be modified as follows to perform filename conversion to lowercase at the beginning using tr instead:\nfor arg \ndo\n  tmp=\"$(echo \"$arg\" | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]')\"\n  mv -i \"$arg\" \"$(exiftool -CreateDate \"$arg\" | awk -F ': ' '{print $2}' | sed -e 's/:/-/g' -e 's/ /_/g')_$tmp\"\ndone\n\nTo perform slightly different commands for different file types, a bash case statement can be used in this script. For example:\n#! /usr/bin/env bash\nfor filename in ./*\ndo\n  tmp=\"$(echo \"$filename\" | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]')\"\n  case \"$filename\" in\n    *.MOV|*.mov) \n      mv -i \"$filename\" \"$(exiftool -a -s -CreateDate-tur \"$filename\" | awk -F ': ' '{print $2}' | sed -e 's/\\-[0-9][0-9]\\:00//g' -e 's/\\+[0-9][0-9]\\:00//g' -e 's/:/-/g' -e 's/ /_/g')_$tmp\"\n      ;;\n    *.JPG|*.jpg)\n      mv -i \"$filename\" \"$(exiftool -a -s -CreateDate \"$filename\" | awk -F ': ' '{print $2}' | sed -e 's/:/-/g' -e 's/ /_/g')_\"$tmp\"\"\n      ;;\n    *)\n      echo 'Not a *.jpg or a *.mov!'\n      ;;\n  esac\ndone\n\nIn this example, renaming of MOV files that have CreateDate timestamps ANY NUMBER of hours AFTER OR BEFORE JPG files is adjusted by using another (-tur) EXIF data and removing that that time difference suffix, and it might be necessary to change -tur part according to the location set in the system.\n\nA: I'd use krename for this.

It sometimes shows my mouse, but only if it's on the sidebar, and only sometimes.. Weird right? Anyone know what's going on?\n\nA: Ubuntu by default uses the 'Extend' configuration when connecting to an external monitor, this configuration basically extends your screen.

I am trying to create a bootable OS X installation, and for doing so I'm formating a usb drive with GPT and then creating 2 partitions: one with the UFI bootloader and other with the OS, but once it's gparted tells me that \"The backup GPT table is corrupt\" and does not read the second partition.\nIt doesn't matter the size it will always read the sdb1 and not the sdb2 (which I need access for copying the files).\nUsing GDISK I already corrected the GPT (so gparted does not issue an error) but the /dev/sdb2 is still not accessible, with its file system unrecognized.\nCan you help with this?\nThank You!\n\nA: First, what tools and procedures did you use to get to the point of the \"backup GPT table is corrupt\" message, and is that error message reproducible by reproducing those steps? It could be that you did something wrong in creating the partitions, and that this is causing problems, but without knowing how you created the partition table and filesystems, that's impossible to know for sure.\nSecond, if the error is reproducible and if you're using common partitioning tools (such as Disk Utility in OS X, GParted or gdisk in Linux, etc.), then it's very unlikely that you'd get a consistent and reproducible problem in the partition table. This makes me think that you may have a defective USB flash drive on your hands. I can't be sure of that, though, particularly if you used some oddball tool to create the partitions.\nThird, if a partition (such as /dev/sdb2) is inaccessible, you may need to use filesystem repair tools such as fsck on it. Further diagnosis would require knowledge of what filesystem it is (I'd guess HFS+, if you intend to put OS X on it). The output of sudo fsck /dev/sdb2 and/or sudo blkid /dev/sdb2 would be useful in further diagnosis.\nFourth, if you're trying to create a bootable OS X disk, you should probably be doing this in OS X, not in Linux. Is there some reason you're trying to use Linux for this task?\nI recommend you edit your question to provide all this additional information; it's too much to fit in comments.\n", "Q: Locking Eclipse to the Launcher Bar Eclipse (from the Android Developers Bundle (ADB)) will lock to the launch bar, but then it is just an icon which cannot be opened.

But, unfortunately HttpAuthDigestModule is not included while installing. This is how to install from source - ./configure --add-module=../samizdatco-nginx-http-auth-digest-xxxxxxx\nHow do I configure nginx that was installed?\n\nA: TL;DR:  You cannot add a module to the already-installed NGINX.  Read on for why, and possible solutions.\nThe nginx package that is already installed on your system, whether from the main repositories or not, is already compiled with the modules set forth in the system.  This goes for any of the nginx PPAs (from the nginx team), too.  Since the binaries are already compiled with a set of modules, you can't \"add\" any modules to that without a bit more work.\nTo add the http-auth-digest module, you'll either have to find someone who can create a customized package for you in a PPA that you can use to update the software and make it work; create a customized Debian package for you with that module in it; or build, compile, and configure from source yourself.\n\nSince 2016, NGINX has had support for Dynamic Modules.  However, you need to precompile the dynamic module against the exact same version of NGINX that you're going to put the module into.\nThis requires that the module be written in the proper way to work as a dynamic module, but if it is, then you can technically compile it alongside the same NGINX instance, and then move the compiled module to another NGINX system of the same exact version.  This, however, does not allow you to compile modules without compiling NGINX alongside it, so you still have to compile NGINX in order to get a usable dynamic module.\nDynamic module support, however, is not available in 16.04 as it required major packaging changes that were not available at the 16.04 release cycle, and therefore is only available in 16.10 and later.\n", "Q: When shuting down a black screen with a broken pipe message shows for half second It is actually very fast when it shows, I had to record it to actually saw what it said and it is:\ncould not write bytes: Broken pipe\nChecking battery state...\ncpid: exiting\nChecking for running unattended-upgrades\nI have Ubuntu 64 bits, 12.04.3, Intel HD 4000, and I have had several problems with Ubuntu as I had to format my laptop quite a few times, I am using only Ubuntu, not Windows.

Saved the public key on remote server, such that keys are required before connecting ssh.\nI have forgot the passphrase for that key. How can I retrieve it?\n\nA: If it was a reasonably secure password, the answer is probably \"not at all\". According to the ssh-keygen man page, the private key is encrypted using 128bit AES. Although this algorithm has some weaknesses, the complexity is still high enough to make it reasonably secure. So, assuming a strong password and highly parallel decryption (for instance using GPGPU) having 210 threads, each having a very optimistic rate of 230 operations per second, after a day of time, you could have run about 256 operations. With an effective complexity of around 2100, it would take about 3 billion years to break the key...\nIf it was an insecure password, you might have a chance to break it with brute force though. It seems the community enhanced edition John the Ripper has a GPGPU module for brute-force attacks on OpenSSH key files (didn't try it, I don't use proprietary drivers).\nBy thy way, a similar question, not about retrieving the key, but instead breaking the encryption itself was already asked.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu After Download I downloaded the latest version of Ubuntu Desktop (13.04) the other day and think I might have missed something, as I didn't see any \"Install\"-related buttons or links following the download.

PhpMyAdmin.  They can request certain packages be installed rather than doing it themselves. If they really need ssh access for some reason then you can loook at SSH Chroot Jails that give limited access to some resources on the system.\n2) How to list all programs?\nYou can list all installed applications installed by the package manager by issuing the command sudo dpkg -l  but how do you know they have not just put some binaries on system and bypassed the package manager? or edited cronjobs. You can use applications such as tripwire and finely set this up to test for changes in the system.  \nIt really boils down to a little access as is possibly needed for the 3rd party to do the job.  If you give someone root access to the system then in my opinion you can only trust that system as much as you trust the admin you gave access. \n\nA: I plan on installing ClamAV for virus scanning, but if someone has with root access can that be bypassed ?\nTo scan for what? Windows viruses? Why would you need that? Please read this topic: Do I need to have 'antivirus software' installed? regarding the need for a virus scanner on Linux. But to check for suspicious activities on your system a root kit detector seems more appropriate. \n\nRoot kit scanner is scanning tool to ensure you for about 99.9%* you're clean of nasty tools.

Create a separate user for them with what -you- consider enough privileges. And let them complain to you if they need to do something they can not and then decide to either accept their request or deny it. Denying it might be appropriate if you can do that task yourself.\nAnd when they are done lock that user and change your admin password. When they need access again unlock the user. \nIs there a command or somewhere I can see all installed items, so I can see whats actually on there?\nNo. Not with a fool proof methods anyways. If they used apt-get those are logged. but there is no way to log a script being added to your system (and I would expect these scripts to hide itself amongst the software you allow odesk to install anyways; let's assume they tell you to install 10 files and 9 of them are legit, and 1 of them is an odesk user that wants to install something unwanted... how are you going to find this?). \nThere is a better method: what you need to do is check traffic and that you can find in /var/log/. If you see (what you  believe to be) weird connections, the log files will point you to the culprit. But this is not just for this case: regularly checking traffic is a task any admin should do (malware is only useful if is gets its results out the door so you need to play the gatekeeper).\n\nA: *\n\n*The first part (SSH & anti-virus/malware) is answered rightly so by Rinzwind & Shutupsquare, so I'd avoid repeating it.

I think the container setup uses the older mechanism from sysklogd for rotating (i.e. sysklogd in /etc/cron.daily), so:\n$ syslogd-listfiles\n/var/log/syslog\n\nbut,\n$ syslogd-listfiles --weekly\n/var/log/user.log\n/var/log/daemon.log\n/var/log/messages\n/var/log/debug\n/var/log/auth.log\n/var/log/mail.log\n/var/log/kern.log\n/var/log/lpr.log\n\nSo I think that's correct. (Note: I've dumped the split mail.* logging which double logs everything to mail.info and mail.log)\nHowever, I noticed that my VM was missing the /etc/cron.weekly/sysklogd job so had to add it manually.\nThe other thing you might fall foul of is syslogd-listfiles has some extra checks to exclude very small log files from rotation. So if nothing's being logged, they won't be rotated.\n", "Q: cloud-init/cloud-config syntax documentation I am looking for cloud-init/cloud-config syntax documentation.

Just be aware that it may cause issues with left-clicking by touchscreen in some programs, which is why I had to disable it on my system.\n\nA: Out of my answers to this question, this is my personal favourite.\nIf you have a touchscreen that supports at least two-finger multi-touch input, you can install touchegg and configure it to interpret (for example) a two-finger tap as a right-click. I tried this under Lubuntu 18.10 and it works.\n1. Installation\ntouchegg is available in the Ubuntu 18.10 repositories, so you can install it simply like this:\nsudo apt install touchegg\n\nTo start it, execute touchegg. When executing it in a terminal you can check from its output if it detects your multitouch gestures correctly.\nTo make touchegg start automatically for each LXQt session, simply add it to Autostart (LXQt menu → Preferences → LXQt Settings → Session settings → Autostart).\n2. Ways to configure touchegg\nYou can configure touchegg in two alternative ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Configuration with a config file. Edit the file ~/.config/touchegg/touchegg.conf. To make the changes effective, execute the following in a terminal or via the Alt + F2 run dialog:\nkillall touchegg; touchegg\n\n\n*Configuration with a GUI. touchegg has a nice configuration GUI called touchegg-gui, which is seen here. However, it is not part of the touchegg Ubuntu package. Alternatively, you can install the GUI touchegg-gce as described here. touchegg-gce works, but you have to manually restart touchegg after saving changes to its configuration file, again by executing:\nkillall touchegg; touchegg\n\n3. Configuration for emulating a right-click\nTo configure a two-finger-tap right-click, you can use this config file for ~/.config/touchegg/touchegg.conf:\n<touchégg>\n        <settings>\n                <property name=\"composed_gestures_time\">0</property>\n        </settings>\n\n        <application name=\"All\">\n                <gesture type=\"TAP\" fingers=\"2\" direction=\"\">\n                        <action type=\"MOUSE_CLICK\">BUTTON=3</action>\n                </gesture>\n        </application>\n</touchégg>\n\nComments on the touchegg configuration:\n\n\n*\n\n*Two-finger-tap right-clicking as shown above is currently already contained in the default configuration file that comes with touchegg. (Ubuntu 18.10 here.)\n\n*The program will wait composed_gestures_time (given in milliseconds) for you to complete your actions for gestures that consist of multiple parts (like touble taps), and only then interpret them. So when using touchegg only for single-part gestures such as two-finger-tap right-clicking, we can set this to 0 to prevent any noticeable delay in the actions. This is also the default in the config file created by touchegg.\n\n*At least with my touchscreen, two-finger-tapping is not recognized when touching the screen with both fingers at exactly the same time. But when there is even a very small time gap (so that two taps can be heard, probably ≥10 ms), it works reliably. So I just move my index finger and middle finger with a small vertical gap towards the screen, and it works reliably.\n\n*The right-click will be triggered at the location of that finger (out of the two in this gesture) that touches the screen first.\n\n*touchegg lets all events that it was not configured for bubble up to the appication under the cursor to be interpreted there. This is good because the native pinch-zoom etc. implemented in Chromium, Chrome, Evince for example works way more smooth than via touchegg.\n\n*touchegg can be used alongside the (highly recommendable!) single-touch gesture recognition software easystroke without interference. Of course, they should not be configured to be triggered by the same events.\n4. Troubleshooting\n\n\n*\n\n*touchegg may stop to work after a suspend-and-resume cycle. I still have to find a way so that it restarts automatically.\n\n*At least for me and others, touchegg will only interpret touch events on the touchscreen, not on the touchpad. In this case this is desired. It may be because my touchpad uses a driver that does not expose multi-touch events to the X server (synaptics rather than libinput). You can check which devices touchegg binds to by starting it with GEIS_DEBUG=3 touchegg.\n\n*If touchegg causes a kind of \"stuck half click\" for all programs, where taps will move the mouse pointer but no longer trigger left-clicks: this is not its normal behavior. Under Ubuntu 18.10 with LXQt, I did not have this at first, but then had it across several re-starts of touchegg and even restarts of the whole computer. It disappeared after starting the default Ubuntu desktop and then returning to LXQt.\nA fix in the touchegg configuration file by setting up an additional gesture for one-finger tapping will fix the \"stuck half click\", but other misbehavior of touchegg that comes with this bug remains, so it is not a real fix. That misbehavior includes that (1) touchegg will now also consume all events that it is not configured for, at least those for one finger, and (2) some Java based programs (freemind for example) will now suffer from a reverse issue with \"stuck half clicks\", where the cursor position will be stuck but left mouse button clicks will register. This is temporarily fixed by doing a two-finger action in the Java-based program, for touchegg to recognize.\n\nA: You need to enable the secondary click (as AliNa commented) with gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.a11y.mouse secondary-click-enabled \"true\" or with dconf editor.\nThen it is possible that Ubuntu handles the touchscreen partially like a touchpad, where a touch does not trigger mouse-press. Instead you need to  short-tap + touch-and-hold.\n\nA: For those who have the ≣ Menu key on their keyboard, the note in the question about using that to create a right-click is actually a great idea. Since it is not obvious, here is how it works:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap-and-hold the screen with one finger. Do not release the finger, as that would trigger a left-click, which might have undesirable effects in your application. Tap-and-hold however is like pressing and not releasing the left mouse button, and usually no action in an application results from that. But, the mouse pointer's position is already changed to where we want to right-click, which is why we do this step.\n\n*Press and release the ≣ Menu key. Already on the key-press event, a right-click is triggered.\nObviously, this technique needs two hands, and is completely impossible on convertible notebooks in tablet mode. So it is of limited practical use.\n\nA: You can use easystroke to create right-clicks with a modifier plus tap, such as Ctrl + Alt + tap. With additional configuration, this can be accessed single-handedly with just a touchscreen, see below.\nThis is quite nice, as \"modifier plus tap\" as a right-click cannot be configured with any of touchegg (does not recognize modifiers), mouseemu (does not recognize taps as they lack scancodes) or xsetwacom \"…\" set Button 1 … (does not recognize taps as finger input is not a button event in the driver).\n1. Installation\neasystroke program is only minimally maintained right now, but in the release notes they link to a recent Ubuntu package, built on Ubuntu 18.04. It worked well for me (Ubuntu 18.10 here). You can install it as follows:\nwget http://openartisthq.org/easystroke/easystroke_0.6.0-0ubuntu8_amd64.deb\nsudo apt install ./easystroke_0.6.0-0ubuntu8_amd64.deb\n\n2. Configuration\n\n\n*\n\n*Start the program with easystroke.\n\n*Under the second tab \"Preferences\", click \"Gesture Button\" and Ctrl + Alt + tap into the gray field. Ctrl + Alt seems to be the best choice of modifier, at least under LXQt, because:\n\n\n*\n\n*Both Shift + click and Ctrl + click are used for multi-selection already and would become unavailable for that if assigned to easystroke.\n\n*Alt, Super and any combination involving Super will not be seen by easystroke. This is probably a LXQt or Openbox coniguration issue, but I could not resolve it so far.\n\n\n*Under the first tab \"Actions\", click \"Add Action\".\n\n*Configure your action with \"Type: Command\" and \"Details: xdotool keyup ctrl alt; xdotool click 3\". Adapt according to your chosen modifiers. \nDepending on the modifiers, clearing the modifiers first is important to prevent side effects. For example Shift + right-click in Chrome would lead to text selection. Also, clearing the modifiers explicitly is needed to prevent stuck modifiers when triggering these key presses with software (see section 3 below). Not clearing the modifiers on its own before executing the command could be considered a bug in easystroke.\n\n*Click \"Record Stroke\" and record a single tap.\n\n*You can disable the (here rather useless) popups under \"Preferences → Appearance → Show Popups\".\n\n*You can limit this gesture recognition to only your touchscreen and perhaps pen input device under \"Advanced → Devices\".\nNow, Ctrl + Alt + tap will create a right-click.\nNote that easystroke has great gesture recognition for single-touch gestures (\"drawing shapes on the screen\") which you can use to automate many tasks  while using the touchscreen. That's its main purpose, while right-click emulation is just a side effect.\n3. Improvement: touch-only right-clicks\nNow let's improve this configuration so that you can trigger right-clicks with just one hand and a touchscreen by (1) tapping on a special on-screen button that will mean \"next tap is a right-click\" and (2) then tapping on the screen just normally.\nHere is a recipe for Lubuntu (LXQt) and using the Ctrl + Alt modifier chosen above, but the principle is the same in all desktop environments and with all modifiers: a custom quicklaunch entry in the panel.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a custom icon for your quicklaunch entry and save it as ~/.icons/default/rightclick.png.\n\n*Create a custom .desktop file and save it as .local/share/applications/rightclick.desktop, with the following content. Note that you have to supply username for the absolute path.\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Rightclick\nComment=Next tap is a rightclick via Ctrl + Alt + easystroke gesture.\nIcon=/home/matthias/.icons/default/rightclick.png\nExec=xdotool keydown ctrl alt\nType=Application\nCategories=System;Utility;\nStartupWMClass=localdomain.rightclick\n\n\n*Add another quicklaunch widget to your LXQt panel. While in principle you can also modify your existing one, I found that one placed in the bottom right corner of the screen is the most natural for right-handed operation and also accidental misclicks will only show the date (if that's what is next to the left, as in my case) instead of starting some large application.\n\n*Open ~/.config/lxqt/panel.conf and adjust the new [quicklaunch2] section to refer to your custom .desktop file. Again, you have to supply username. Example how it may look:\n[quicklaunch2]\nalignment=Left\napps\\1\\desktop=/home/username/.local/share/applications/rightclick.desktop\napps\\size=1\ntype=quicklaunch\n\n\n*Restart the LXQt panel to make the changes effective. For that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to \"LXQt menu → Preferences → LXQt Settings → Session settings\".\n\n*Select \"Basic Settings → LXQt Modules → Panel\".\n\n*Click \"Stop\".\n\n*Click \"Start\".\n\n\n \n(You could also execute killall lxqt-panel && lxqt-panel in the Alt + F2 launch dialog, but that will interfere with the panel status recognized in the above mentioned dialog, and if you mix both techniques you'd have two panels running on top of each other, with one missing some panel icons. So better don't. This is still buggy.)\nAlso, if you have special hardware buttons at the side of the touchscreen, you could assign the xdotool keydown ctrl alt command to one of them instead.\n4. Other improvements and troubleshooting\n\n\n*\n\n*As a nice side effect, the above technique for touch-only right-clicks also enables single-handed access to all the other gestures you may have configured in easystroke. That's a pretty powerful feature for touchscreen usage automation.\n\n*When you configure other gestures in easystroke, be aware of the following bug: easystroke does not clear our chosen modifiers before doing the configured action. The action types \"Key\" and \"Text\" all result in key combinations together with Ctrl + Alt in the case above, which makes them unusable. As a workaround, choose action type \"Command\" instead and clear the modifiers yourself the same way as above. So to trigger Ctrl + V, the command would be:\nxdotool keyup ctrl alt; xdotool key \"ctrl+v\"\n\n(The xdotool option --clearmodifiers does not help here as it only disables the modifiers during the key combination to execute and re-applies them afterwards. Which in this case would make the next tap a right-click as per the technique above, but we would not want that in this case.)\n\n*If you ever have stuck modifiers during testing, pressing and releasing the modifier keys on the physical keyboard will fix the condition.\n\n*Sometimes during testing these things, my LXQt my keyboard and mouse events would become very messed up. In such a case, only logging out from the graphical environment and logging in again helped.\n\n*The cleanest way to implement single-handed touch-only operation in easystroke, including for the case of right-clicks as required here, would be that a tap on the easystroke panel icon brings it into the same internal state as our custom panel icon configured above, but without actually changing the keyboard modifier state because that can lead to stuck modifiers etc.. To show the easystroke window, one would then have to use the context menu of its panel icon. Obviously, that requires some changes in the easystroke code.\n", "Q: Windows \"jumping\" between monitors when scale plugin used I have two monitors. I am very particular as to which window goes to which monitor (e.g. Firefox always on the left side; terminals on other workspaces always maximized on the left monitor; R graphics always on the right monitor etc.). \nI use the scale plugin with the \"initiate window picker for all windows\" binding to switch between windows. I also use the option \"use device with pointer\" of the \"place windows\" plugin (that way, when opening a window, it goes to the monitor that I want it to go; however, the behavior I'm about to describe happens also when the option \"use active device\" is selected).\nHowever, often when I use the scale plugin to jump between windows placed on different workspaces, it jumps from one monitor to the other. Most frequently it moves from the monitor on the left hand side to the monitor on the right. It annoys the hell out of me, because I then feel compelled to drag the window back to the left side. It never happens if I do not switch between workspaces.\nI think it might be due to the \"place windows\" options and the \"scale\" plugin options that I use together. You see, when I initiate window picker for all windows, most of the windows, for some reason, get minimized on the right hand monitor, like this:\n\nThen when I select one of the windows on the right, the cursor is on the right hand side of the screen; and so maybe the \"place window\" plugin gets called and puts the window there (because it is both, the active device and the device with the cursor).

So, the script will work as expected if you run using the following command:\n/home/michael/Scripts/bring-all-windows.bash michael@michael\n(you  don't need to prepend the above command with bash).\n\n*Or, maybe the best choice, in the script match with the window identity, not with window title:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nProgram=\" $(pidof $@) \"\n\nwmctrl -lp | while read Window; do\n    if [ \"${Program/ `echo \"$Window\" | cut -f 4 -d \" \"` }\" != \"$Program\" ]; then\n        echo \"DEBUG: I bring $Window\"\n        code=`echo \"$Window\" | cut -f 1 -d \" \"`\n        wmctrl -i -a $code\n    fi\ndone\n\nThen run the script using the following command:\n/home/michael/Scripts/bring-all-windows.bash gnome-terminal\n", "Q: Not able to destroy service as agent-state is down I am unable to destroy service as on of the unit agent says its down. I see that this bug has been fixed as stated here unit destruction depends on unit agents\nBut I am not getting whats the solution to the problem?\nI am running juju 1.13.3-raring-amd64. Here is output of juju status,\nquantum-gateway:\n    charm: local:precise/quantum-gateway-56\n    exposed: false\n    life: dying\n    units:\n      quantum-gateway/0:\n        agent-state: down\n        agent-state-info: (installed)\n        agent-version: 1.12.0\n        life: dying\n        machine: \"20\"\n        public-address: opnw02.master\n\n\nA: When you have an agent-state: down that means the bootstrap node can't communicate with the juju-agent. As a result it can't destroy as it can't communicate the next set of events.\nThis happens sometimes when the machine is destroyed outside of juju, so juju thinks it's still there though the machine has been physically removed. Can you confirm that opnw02.master is indeed still running? If so, try to ssh to it either using juju ssh 20 or ssh ubuntu@opnw02.master. If you can gain access to the machine try restarting the juju-agents, which are jujud-machine-# and jujud-unit-<service>-#. So in your case the following commands will restart those services\nsudo stop jujud-machine-20\nsudo stop jujud-unit-quantum-gateway-0\n\nsudo start jujud-machine-20\nsudo start jujud-unit-quantum-gateway-0\n\nAt this point juju status should report the unit-agent as started again. You may need to run juju resolved quantum-gateway/0 a few times as it appears to have stopped during mid-hook execution. Eventually, the service should go par to the course and be removed.\nIf you are unable to log in to the machine (either it was destroyed outside of juju, or for other reasons) then it'll remain in the juju status for now. There's work to allow \"cleanup\" of services but it hasn't landed yet (as of 1.13.3). If you want to deploy quantum-gateway again, and the status still has this agent-state down business, then you can deploy it with a different alias like so:\njuju deploy quantum-gateway qgateway\n\nGoing forward you can make relations to it by issuing juju add-relation nova-compute qgateway\n", "Q: Network-manager cannot install, dependency issue I accidently installed connmanager, it removed my network-manager and network-manager-gnome.

Can you run the memory test from a live CD?\n\n*A damaged installation disc - unlikely since you've tried multiple media\n\n\nCan you run the live disc successfully, that is, have you given the \"Try Ubuntu without installing\" option a try?\nAre you confident that the PC is otherwise healthy? Is XP running happily? You say it's only a few years old, but it's still worth checking for obvious signs of hardware failure, such as swollen capacitors on the motherboard / video card.\n\nA: The processor in the MC1538 only supports 32bit instruction sets. It might be possible that you've semi-booted a 64bit ISO. Simple fix: download the 32bit version.\nHave you tested the ISOs you're downloading? If you have a flaky internet connection, it might be adding corruption to the download. Unlikely if you've done this multiple times, but possible on a really bad connection.\nAnd have you been able to test the media you're using? A bad USB stick and some bad luck while burning may be introducing corruptions. The instructions on doing this are for a Linux-like OS but applications like WinMD5 should be able to approximate it.\n", "Q: How do I copy my whole ubuntu 12.04 installation to a usb flash and to a new partition I initially made a 13 gig partition for my Ubuntu installation and that running out of space.

Or do I have to worry about things like sym-links etc?\nAny other hints will be appreciated.\n\nA: Yes, you do need to worry about symlinks, permissions, etc. Easiest in my book is to use rsync. It can handle symlinks and permissions, plus can resume if interrupted.\nTo copy to your usb:\nsudo rsync --archive --hard-links --one-file-system / /path/to/USB/backup\n\nTo restore, you'd have to boot a livecd to rsync to an empty partition (can't copy Linux over itself!), and update /etc/fstab accordingly. If /home or /boot is on a separate partition, you will need to run it again on those folders.\n\nA: A better choice would be to use a tool (such as the partition editor that comes with Ubuntu) to resize both partitions.  Basically, you shrink the Windows partition, then scoot Ubuntu over into the space freed and resize the partition to take up the extra room.  This keeps everything installed, you don't have to worry about copying to/from a flash drive, and it's faster (done correctly).\nUbuntu actually has a good write-up about how to do this.  Also look at this How-To Geek article if you'd like some screenshots (it's older but still valid).  Lastly, the GParted FAQ talks about this operation.\nTwo points:  First, Particularly important is to reboot Windows immediately after shrinking its partition.  Its bootloader is more fragile than GRUB's or other Linux bootloaders' default setups.  Second, if it makes you feel more comfortable, you can use Windows's own partitioner tool to have it shrink its partition--you can have it do this while Windows is running.\nGood luck!\nEDIT:  It should go without saying that you should back up any precious data.  You're modifying filesystems here!\n", "Q: Install alongside Windows 8 is not working I really want to try out and become a full time user of Ubuntu on my laptop so for the moment I have setup a dual boot on my Windows 8 HP Envy M6 Laptop. To do this, I shrank my Windows 8 partition to create 100GB empty space that the Ubuntu installer could use to install itself to. I then followed these instructions with Ubuntu 13.04 x64 as my distro of choice.\nhttp://www.makeuseof.com/tag/tired-of-windows-8-how-to-dual-boot-windows-ubuntu/\nI selected the option within Ubuntu to install alongside Windows 8 at first. I then later tried the manual option to no avail.\nWhen I restart my machine it just boots straight into Windows. The install booted up in UEFI mode absolutely fine and when I press F9 to get my boot options, Ubuntu 13.04 shows up as an option. However, selecting this option will just cause the machine to boot in Windows 8. I'm at a real loss at the moment as to what I can do as the process should not be this difficult (at least it wasn't with legacy booting) but If nobody can solve this issue it looks as if I'll have to abandon the idea of Linux altogether. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\nCheers,\nJezzipin\n\nA: First, try disabling Secure Boot, if you haven't done so already. This feature can sometimes cause this symptom. If that fails, be aware that HPs are known to have buggy EFIs that make dual-booting difficult. Some things you can try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check with HP to see if there's a firmware update for your computer. If there is one, install it. You may also need to re-install GRUB after you update the firmware.\n\n*Return the computer to the store and buy another brand. This is my #2 suggestion because the problem has existed for months and HP doesn't seem to have lifted a finger to change it. (#1 exists to give HP the benefit of the doubt; maybe they have fixed it, and I simply haven't heard of it yet.) This behavior calls out for action that will get HP's attention, and the best action to take to get the attention of a company is to return their problem products.\n\n*In Windows, open an Administrator Command Prompt window and type bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi (change grubx64.efi to shimx64.efi if you're booting with Secure Boot active). This method works on some computers with similar problems, but usually not on HPs. Still, it's worth trying.\n\n*Prepare a USB flash drive with rEFInd and test it. If it boots both Linux and Windows, reconfigure your firmware to boot from the USB flash drive by default and leave the rEFInd flash drive inserted in the computer.\n\n*Run Boot Repair on the system, select the Advanced option, and click the check box to back up and replace the Windows boot files. This will cause GRUB to be installed in place of the Windows boot loader, and GRUB will be reconfigured to launch the Windows boot loader under its own name. This solution is an ugly hack, and some users have reported that Windows will sometimes undo it, so it's not really a reliable long-term solution.\n\n*Install GRUB, rEFInd, or some other boot manager as EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi on the ESP (that is, as /boot/efi/EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi) and move or rename the EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi file to some other location. With any luck, your target boot loader will then launch. If you use GRUB, you'll need to reconfigure it to find the Windows boot loader wherever you moved it. If you use rEFInd, it will detect the Windows boot loader if you move it to the EFI/Microsoft directory.\n\n", "Q: Multiple NIC Bonds in 12.04 I have installed Ubuntu Server 12.04 x64 on an HP Proliant DL380 G7 (dual CPUs, 24GB RAM, RAID 5 - 300GB). Clean install, nothing else is on the machine. Virtualizing this machine isn't an option or I would already have done that. \nI am trying to bond the network connections of the built in 4-port Broadcom NIC with an HP 331T adapter (Broadcom). Both are gigabit and are recognized by Ubuntu (latest firmware has been applied to everything). \nI am trying to create two bonds (bond0 and bond1), corresponding to the front-end and back-end network.

Is it possible to append a script in nautilus (I don't know how) that will open the file in the already running vlc, instead of changing vlc preference or dragging and dropping methods?\nEdit:\nYou guys might already know this, but I just found out that we could put bash scripts at \"/home/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts\" either in folders or not (to group them). So it's just a matter of finding out the running pid of vlc and force the file to open in it. I don't know bash scripting but if you do, please help me out here.\n\nA: Your new edit at the question is good pointed. But I'll rephrase.\nThe submenu Scripts only appears in the right click on a file or directory in Nautilus once you have at least one script in the scripts directory. This script directory should be located in (if you don't have it, you should create it):\n\n*\n\n*~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts - for versions of Nautilus >= 3.6\n\n*~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts - for versions of Nautilus < 3.6\n\nYou can check your nautilus version from terminal using nautilus --version command.\n\nNote: Once you place a script in your scripts directory, it's name will not necessarily appear in the scripts menu immediately. You might have to visit the scripts directory with Nautilus - which can be done using the last option in the scripts menu. Once the directory is visited, Nautilus will know about which scripts you have, and you will be able to use them.\nSource: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NautilusScriptsHowto\n\nThese being said, the following script should make the trick about you asked for your VLC:\n#!/bin/bash\n\npid=$(pidof vlc)\n\n## !!! if you want that only the last opened instance of vlc to be replaced \n## in case you have many instances opened, uncomment next line (delete the hash mark from the front)\n#pid=$(echo $pid | cut -d ' ' -f1)\n\nif [ \"$pid\" != \" \" ]; then\n    kill $pid\nfi\n\nvlc \"$@\"\n\n", "Q: how to download and install Jubler on ubuntu 13.04?

Could I install only JRE using webupd8 PPA. I think this ppa provides JDK. But I just need JRE. How does it harm if I use JDK when JRE is enough for my webserver?\nAnother thing if I install a package using a PPA or apt-get install utility would I automatically be receiving updates/ upcomning releases whenever I do apt-get update && apt-get upgrade ?\n\nA: When using the webupd8 PPA you will be installing the official , publicly available Java SE JDK which also contains the JRE as a part of that download. If your wish is only to install the JRE and not the JDK, then you can choose to use the manual method of obtaining the latest JRE from Oracle's website, and then finding the Easy Linux Tips Project page and following the method there. \nYou will not be harmed using the JDK, and the PPA may be a much better option for you  For one thing, the scripts to make the java defaults proper in the PPA are much better for you depending on what you use within java, and take effect on all properties versus the manual method (IMHO). \nThe PPA can only update when updates are made in the PPA itself. The manual method requires your own intervention in order to work.  Do hope that helps.\n", "Q: Where is the usage of Ubuntu cloud guest image on OpenStack documented? Whenever I set up a devstack or OpenStack deployment, I want to add the latest LTS Ubuntu server image. I succeeded several times in the past and I believe it can be achieved with something like:\nwget http://uec-images.ubuntu.com/releases/12.04.2/release/ubuntu-12.04.2-server-cloudimg-amd64-disk1.img\nglance image-create --is-public true --disk-format qcow2 --container-format bare --name \"precise\" < ubuntu-12.04.2-server-cloudimg-amd64-disk1.img\n\nI wonder, though, where can I find the officially supported documentation on doing this? How can I contribute to it? I sometimes experience problems and without official instructions I'm never sure if it's the above command or my deployment. I tried adding these instructions to the OpenStack official docs and/or the accompanying Disqus comments on two occasions, but these would get removed and I can't find a consistent, supported manual to do this, I would expect very basic, procedure.\nAlso, what about the elusive cloud-init options to guest images? Where can I find instructions on how to use those? From the terminal and from the web UI? I once had to go fishing for this information in the source code.\nWhat I found so far is the site listing the available images, but one that doesn't state what are the formats of the images - I always have to google for this information. There is the UEC wiki that lists many recipes on how to create your own images, but not how to use existing ones (or the premade ubuntu cloud images). Then there is the most easily found \"cloud\" category on ubuntu.com that only links to some promotional pamphlets and the uninformative cloud images listing.\nI know that this is a semi-bug report (which I would like to see fixed or help fix :) ), but I would also like to know the answers to the questions I posed.\n\nA: I was having the same issue, so I ended up downloading all the \"trusty-server-cloudimg-amd64\" prefixed images.

The '-virtual' string\nrepresents the Ubuntu Linux package that this kernel came from.  It\ncould potentially be '-server' or another string.\n\n*-initrd-virtual\nThis is a Linux initrd.  It can be bundled, uploaded, and registered\nUEC as an Amazon Ramdisk Image (ari/eri). Not all images require an\ninitrd, and thus this file may not be present.

Running a production web server with Ubuntu 12.04 which ships Tomcat 7.0.26. Should I care about updating the tomcat installation to latest 7.0.42 version or should I stick with what's provided? If I stick then am I not vulnerable to threats & bugs in 7.0.26 version ? I've been suggested to always use the latest minor version for things like JRE 7, Tomcat 7 etc, does it not hold good here ? \nShould I be installing the latest version by downloading the tar & untar-ing it instead of using apt-get install to download from ubuntu repositories an older version? How would I be updating those installations later then ?\nEdit:\nI just have single webapp  running on a single server. While I don't have any specific feature requirements for Tomcat or JRE that force me to use a particular newer version. I'm asking this just to ensure that if I'm running an older version supplied by ubuntu(installed from through apt-get install), am I safe in terms of security & quality of software? Do these software packages will be updated to a newer minor version later while I m sticking to a particular LTS version ?\n\nA: If you installed Tomcat with apt-get install and have not messed with your sources.list file too much, then you are secure by just letting Ubuntu update regularly.\nApparently the Tomcat7 package is not updated very often, so you might want to check the changelog to see whether they have a history of updating the package as soon as a security vulnerability is discovered:\nhttp://changelogs.ubuntu.com/changelogs/pool/universe/t/tomcat7/tomcat7_7.0.26-1ubuntu1.2/changelog\n\nA: Q. Should I care about updating the tomcat installation to latest 7.0.42 version or should I stick with what's provided?\nA. Yes, you should update/upgrade.\nQ. If I stick then am I not vulnerable to threats & bugs in 7.0.26 version?\nA. Yes, you're vulnerable to the bugs in old versions. But, you'd get the security updates & patches automatically as they're released.\nQ. I've been suggested to always use the latest minor version for things like JRE 7, Tomcat 7 etc, does it not hold good here?\nA. It's best practice to use the latest stable version.\nQ. Should I be installing the latest version by downloading the tar & untar-ing it instead of using apt-get install to download from ubuntu repositories an older version? \nHow would I be updating those installations later then?\nA. It all depends on whether the latest (stable) version is in the Ubuntu Reps. If it's there, get it from Rep; else build from the source. The 'Software Updater' would take care of future updates if the source PPA/Rep is added in sources.list. If these sources aren't added, it would be updated to any later version in the Reps.\n\nA: \nI'm asking this just to ensure that if I'm running an older version supplied by ubuntu(installed from through apt-get install), am I safe in terms of security & quality of software?\n\nBy default, now Ubuntu includes backports. Meaning? That security fixes are delivered to you fast and steady if they are fixed upstream. These add up to the fact that the security repository should be in your sources.list too. Hence, installing from repositories will keep your system security while you keep it updated.\nUbuntu by default checks for updates each ~24 hrs and install security upgrades immediately.\n\nDo these software packages will be updated to a newer minor version later while I m sticking to a particular LTS version ?\n\nHere your are contradicting yourself. You said that you don't have to stick with a particular version of Tomcat, yet you are fretting if a minor upgrade get released. LTS are for people that prefers stability over innovation. If you keep your system upgraded and follow the standard security methods, you will be fine.\n\nBut it is unclear that how ubuntu updates the tomcat because the minor version never changes, it always stays on tomcat 7.0.26 with ubuntu 12.04.. !?\n\nIf you check the package versions instead apt-cache policy tomcat7, you will notice that there the version change. You should also check the changelog and notice the precise-security updates. These packages gets installed in your system immediately they are available. The internal version of Tomcat will not change, since:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu is applying a minor patch that solves an specific issue.\n\n*Features are not introduced in backports, only fixes.\n\n*As features are not introduced and some code depends of an specific version and down/up to work, these are not affected.\n\n", "Q: Running short-term tasks via upstart OS: Ubuntu 12.04\nTask: run script at certain start/stop conditions.

I just understand somewhat about what's the purpose of shared memory which is for faster exchange or use of data among several programs. But having seen a lot of people trying to or talking about secure it, I dont understand how it could be dangerous & what could be done to secure it ?\nI am asking this in context of configuring a server environment on a VPS.\n\nA: It can be dangerous if the program creating it is written wrong and sets up the permissions so that other users can attach to it.  You secure it by writing the program properly to restrict the permissions to only that user.  As such this isn't an administration problem.\n\nA: \n\"It can be dangerous if the program creating it is written wrong\"<. \n\nOr by a exploiter trying to inject code into a running proc (program) on the server that has been established and has been deployed on the server; and that has elevated (possible) privileges; thereby inheriting those privileges, which sets up a possible api for the attacker. \nSorry for the 5 years after. I'm in the process of deploying a server. This shared memory issue has been well documented\n\nBy default, /run/shm is mounted read/write, with permission to execute programs. In recent years, many security mailing lists have noted many exploits where /run/shm is used in an attack against a running service, such as httpd. Most of these exploits, however, rely on an insecure web application rather than a vulnerability in Apache or Ubuntu< from help.ubuntu.com\n\nBut yes as psusi related, coders can write code that does not allow shared memory.

Running 13.04\n\nA: That is a theme for GNOME's login and display manager. Since Ubuntu uses LightDM by default, you would need to install GDM to replace it. During installation, you should be asked to choose one, because there can be only one. I don't know if this is a very good idea, because there is a slight chance that the Unity desktop relies on some feature of LightDM.\nA quick search indicated that GDM has a configuration manager that allows you to browse your files and select the theme from there.

(Notice the VGA1?  This is the name of the monitor...remember this for later) To do so use a command called cvt. e.g. in your case  cvt 1280 1024\nI get something like this: -\n$ cvt 1280 1024\n# 1280x1024 59.89 Hz (CVT 1.31M4) hsync: 63.67 kHz; pclk: 109.00 MHz\nModeline \"1280x1024_60.00\"  109.00  1280 1368 1496 1712  1024 1027 1034 1063 -hsync +vsync\n\nThen you have to create a new mode for xrandr using above information...Copy and paste (Control C and Control V) sometimes does not work.  highlight and middle click seems to work better.\n$xrandr --newmode \"1280x1024_60.00\"  109.00  1280 1368 1496 1712  1024 1027 1034 1063 -hsync +vsync\n\nand then allow this resolution to be used by VGA1 (or whatever your monitor was called) using \n$ xrandr --addmode VGA1 1280x1024_60.00\n\nTo start using this newly added mode...\n$ xrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1280x1024_60.00\n\nYour computer will now be in the required resolution.

Not sure how to fix it now as I've spent hours reading online.\nOnce I \"Term\" the below, my Wireless top right bar comes alive in 13.04 and connects to my network; once I reboot/turn off, I lose it and have to go back into Term and do the B43 Modprobe again, a pain. \nNow I would like a really simple quick solution to the B43 Modprobe solution as listed below website: http://linuxg.net/how-to-fix-broadcom-bcm4311-wireless-driver-on-ubuntu-and-linux-mint/:\nThis is what they said:\nRemove the default driver:\n$ sudo apt-get remove --purge bcmwl-kernel-source\n\nInstall a the Linux Firmware nonfree drivers:\n$ sudo apt-get install linux-firmware-nonfree\n\nLoad the b43 module:\n$ sudo modprobe b43\n\nTo make it work automatically, do:\n$ sudo su\n\ncho \"b43\" >> /etc/modules\n\nHelp most welcome. Thanks.\n\nA: You have a typo in one of your commands. Please do:\nsudo su \necho b43 >> /etc/modules \nexit\n\nthat should make the driver load on boot.\nThanks\n\nA: You might be experiencing some leftover blacklist problems.  I find I don't need the b43 in /etc/modules at all.  Look in all the files in /etc/modprobe.d for the exact line \"blacklist b43\", and either comment it out with # or remove it.  Also, if ssb is blacklisted, it must also be removed or commented out (it is needed too).  Reboot and if you don't get the network, check what modules you did get with\nlsmod | sort \n\nand see what driver got picked up on the \"cfg80211              208382  2 b43,mac80211\"\nline.  If you got wl instead of b43, you didn't remove things completely, so you should blacklist the wl driver in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf.  Reboot and you should get the b43 driver loading.\n", "Q: What is the meaning of exp9ubuntu1 suffix in Ubuntu?

Most packages that aren't Debianized upstream has this -# suffix.\n\n*~exp9 means Experimental build, 9 version. In this case Ubuntu imported clang from the Debian experimental branch. Those packages normally has this suffix since some patches were introduced while they were in the experimental branch that weren't applied upstream or that were cherry picked from upstream.\n\n*ubuntu1 means that the package was modified to be Ubuntu complaint, that cannot be applied upstream, or that hasn't been applied upstream.\n\n\nYou can see that the versions in the changelog has a value that says the branch that applied the fixes:\n\nclang (3.2-1~exp9ubuntu1) raring; urgency=low\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Merge with Debian; remaining changes:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Do not build-depend on binutils-gold.\n  \n*Don't bump the epoch for raring.\n  \n  \n  -- Matthias Klose   Thu, 18 Apr 2013 17:17:28 +0200\nclang (1:3.2-1~exp9) experimental; urgency=low\n[ Peter Michael Green ]\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Use binutils-gold only on architectures where it is actually available\n  \n*33-armhf-defaults.diff Fix defaults to use correct CPU and FPU for\n  debian  armhf (Closes: #704111)\n  \n*34-powerpc-no-altivec.diff disable altivec by default on powerpc because\n  debian powerpc does not require altivec (patch cherry picked from ubuntu)\n-- Sylvestre Ledru   Tue, 02 Apr 2013 19:37:22\n  +0200\n\n", "Q: Xubuntu - manually restart network after reboot?

I have Ubuntu 13.04 with Gnome 3.8.\nI installed compiz, CCSM. I tried to activate Wobbly Windows, but it doesn't work. It was working properly on Ubuntu 10.10 with Gnome.\nWhy it isn't working now?\n\nA: The wobbly windows is a feature not of Gnome, but of the window manager e.g. Compiz.  The Window manager in Gnome Shell is Mutter.  and this does does not support Wobbly Windows (yet).  There is a Gnome Shell extension in beta that allows you to get a wobbly window effect.  This appears to be buggy currently and is only a beta.\n\nA: Gnome Shell support wobbly windows, you can install this extension to get wobbly working.\n\nA: Gnome shell does not support wobbly windows.\nWobbly windows use the default Ubuntu desktop (Unity). Gnome shell doesn't use the compiz window manager, so you can't configure it using ccsm.\n", "Q: Currently using Thunderbird with Windows. Can I use the same Thunderbird after Ubuntu install (will remove windows)? I'm currently using Thunderbird with Win XP and 7. I want to install Ubuntu on both computers (had enough of windows).\nQuestion: will my current Thunderbird (that I am using with win) work with Ubuntu after I install it, or must I use a NEW Thunderbird install (I think it comes with Ubuntu package - therefore I must configure all my email accounts and loss mail history)? I will take out Win on both computers. \n\nA: Thunderbird works in Linux as you realise.  But you will need to migrate the data(you mail, address books, accounts etc over to Linux yourself.  The installation procedure will not do that for you. A Linux install will replace (or sit next to if dual booting) your windows install...they do not share data, in general, though some installers may copy data across.\nFortunately the data you need to move over is present in \"Profile Folders\".  Locate this folder in your Windows install of Thunderbird and copy it into your Thunderbird profile in your Linux install.  Confusingly this Profile directory is not the same as the profile directory in your Thunderbird Program folder.

My hardisk has 1880 bad sectors and I am beginning to realize that it about to fail.\nIs there a way using my Ubuntu OS to fix or at least partition off the part of my HD where most of these sectors are?\n\nA: No doubt this is a duplicate, but the answer needs to be put up front:\nReplace that hard disk NOW!! Bad sectors cannot be fixed. A small number can be worked around, but this is done automatically by the firmware in the hard disk; you should never see any sign that they actually exist unless you run a SMART test on the disk. When you start seeing bad sectors, it means that the disk is failing. The disk may continue to be usable (in a limited way) for anywhere from no time at all to months, but the problem is that these failures can and often do escalate very rapidly and without further warning -- the bad sectors are the warning. Thus, you should go to a store today, buy a new disk, and copy your data off the bad disk today.

(Note that this works even if the disk has Windows on another partition, and it doesn't matter whether the partition(s) you're cloning are primary or logical.  Note also that it isn't necessary to clone your swap partition.)\n", "Q: How to make ubuntu realize application type? I made a text editor for Ubuntu in Java, and now I want to upload it on the Ubuntu Software Center but I have ran into a problem, how will Ubuntu recognize that my application is an editor once people download my application? is there a way to register my app in Ubuntu with Java as an editor so when people try to open a text file, my application shows in the \"open with\" menu? any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: Create a .desktop file for your program and install it to /usr/share/local/applications. It should then appear in the main menu and in the list provided by the \"choose application\" dialog. To make it open text files, use the MimeType and Categories lines. For example, the .desktop file for Leafpad includes this:\nMimeType=text/plain\nCategories=GTK;Utility;TextEditor;\n\n", "Q: System V init scripts How do I list the services running on an instance started by System V init scripts?\nI attempted to run 'service  | --status-all>' with no luck.\n\nA: The reason is simple. There is no command/function called --status-all:\n$ service | --status-all\nUsage: service < option > | --status-all | [ service_name [ command | --full-restart ] ]\n--status-all: command not found\n\nIn the usage the bar | means OR. So, what the usage is telling you is using either:\n\n\n*\n\n*service <option>: option here is start, stop, etc.\n\n*service --status-all: which give you a list of the status of all the services that supports status.\n\n*service service_name command: the service name is obviously the name of any service in the init and command is start, stop, restart, etc. \n\n*service service_name --full-restart: calls the stop command, then call the start command.\n\n", "Q: Which version should I install? 12.04 LTS or 13.04? I'm just about to download and install UBUNTU but I'm confused by the descriptive paragraphs for these versions;\nIt says that the 12.04 LTS version has support to 2017\nBut that the latest version 13.04 is only supported for several months!!!!\nWhich should I download?\n\nA: You should prefer 12.04 because it offers Long Term Support and it is said to be more stable than 13.04 which is experimental when getting down to some more sophisticated things. Also, you may find yourself with a tool that is not fully compatible with 13.04, while with 12.0.4.3 LTS that is unlikely to happen.\nRegards.\n\nA: \"Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS is a long-term support release.

However when I try to run Eclipse without root authorization, I receive the following error message:\nLocking is not possible in the directory \"/opt/eclipse/configuration/org.eclipse.osgi\". A common reason is that the file system or Runtime Environment does not support file locking for that location. Please choose a different location, or disable file locking passing \"-Dosgi.locking=none\" as a VM argument. \n/opt/eclipse/configuration/org.eclipse.osgi/.manager/.fileTableLock (Permission denied)\n\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: Take ownership on the whole directory:\n    sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /opt/eclipse/configuration/org.eclipse.osgi\n\nA: It is because you don't have permissions to modify /opt/eclipse/configuration/org.eclipse.osgi/.manager/.fileTableLock. You should change the user owner of the file using:\n sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /opt/eclipse/configuration/org.eclipse.osgi/.manager/.fileTableLock\n\n\nA: Usually when Eclipse cannot write to the configuration area it will assume you have a shared installation and create a private configuration area in the user's home directory. So why does it still try to write to the shared configuration area in some cases?\nI had the same problem (which is what brought me here) but found the solution here: http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/mv/msg/206634/661552/#msg_661552 If parts of the shared configuration area are writable, Eclipse will not use the private configuration area. Maybe this information can still be of use to someone.\n", "Q: Is dual booting the answer, or separate OS per device? I have a laptop I have been using for about 2 years now. Works decent for gaming, but I am going to hopefully build a PC soon for much better gaming performance. For school, I am taking classes which involve programs like Microsoft Project.\nI have heard about Linux/Ubuntu for a while, but never really thought seriously about getting it.\nIf I did get it now, what would be the best combination of which OS should go on what device? If I used Ubuntu on either of them, how hard would dual booting be, so I could easily swap between them if needed? I don't really know much about how that works.\n\nA: The biggest issue I have with dual booting is the fact that a reboot is needed to run a program from the other OS. Which obviously include closing all your running applications, sometimes just to run a quick program in the other OS and then come back, having to reopen what was open before.\nSo, unless the program you need to run in Windows doesn't work from inside a VM (which might be the case for games, depending on the game and your hardware), I would recommend using a VM. That way you can keep your Ubuntu programs open and run the Windows programs you need, without having to reboot.\nOften, you won't even need a VM. You can use WINE to run Windows programs from inside Linux, but a lot of programs don't work out of the box, and setting them up inside WINE may not be trivial. It's hard to say which solution would be best because it's highly dependent on which Windows programs you need to run, among other factors.\n\nA: Everyone here is going to say Ubuntu is great, of course! However, I'd recommend keeping Windows installed, until you are sure you can do without it (especially for Microsoft things, and possibly gaming).\nDual booting is slightly more irritating than a VM, since (as David Santos says), you have to reboot. It's not really that difficult to do, you essentially shutdown one OS and launch the other. I think if you really want to give Ubuntu/Linux a try, then you should install it as a dual boot. Ubuntu/Linux will run more efficiently than in a VM, and you won't be tempted to do too much in Windows.\nIf you dual boot and keep your Windows installation, there's not really a disadvantage to this over just having a single OS, apart from taking up disk space. Using Wubi might be another option, but IIRC there is a slightly efficiency boost to Ubuntu from this, so I never went down this road.\n", "Q: Where can I find Epson Perfection V500 scanner drivers Epson discontinued support of Linux drivers for the Perfection V500 Photo scanner at the end of 2012. I have reviewed the older answers (2012) for this question and have the list of needed drivers for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. My question, where can I find them now?\n\nA: You can download these drivers form the Epson Website, the driver date is 06-20-2013.\nInstall these drivers and restart your scanner.

I would like to know if having swap space, uses RAM/Memory to keep the swap space 'active', even though the swap space is virtual RAM. \n\nA: Quoting from Ubuntu website\n\nSwap space is the area on a hard disk which is part of the Virtual\n  Memory of your machine, which is a combination of accessible physical\n  memory (RAM) and the swap space. Swap space temporarily holds memory\n  pages that are inactive. Swap space is used when your system decides\n  that it needs physical memory for active processes and there is\n  insufficient unused physical memory available. If the system happens\n  to need more memory resources or space, inactive pages in physical\n  memory are then moved to the swap space therefore freeing up that\n  physical memory for other uses.\n\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq\nSo in short swap is place in harddisk used to store RAM data.\n", "Q: Can you mount new partition to /var/log without rebooting I have made a new partition that I have for the /var/logs.

I'll also choose the free space for a partition so that the Windows Setup formats it and I can be sure Windows XP will be able to use it.\nThat's basically what I've thought up. All that would be left for me to do should be booting the Ubuntu 12.04 Live CD and running Boot-Repair.\nNow, may I ask you, is there a fail behind my plan? Are there better ways? Any recommendation or comments?\n\nA: you can try installing windows xp using a virtualbox.Below link may be useful for you.\nInstall windows 7 through virtual box\n\nA: 1) You should allocate the space of Windows 7 (min 20GB)\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the terminal and type gparted\n\n*If not installed, please install using \nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\n*Partition a disk where you need to install Windows 7\n2) Insert the Windows 7 CD and install it and the drive allocated for windows. After installation, the windows boot loader will override the grub, so there will not be any menu listing for choosing Ubuntu.\n3) Insert the live CD of any Ubuntu distribution and run the following commands in the terminal.\nsudo mount /dev/<device_name> /mnt      #device_name of Ubuntu installation (ex. sda3)\nsudo rm -rf /boot\nsudo ln -s /mnt/boot /boot\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-pc\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda    #no device number here\nsudo umount /boot\n4) Restart the device.

Does it deserve to be on Linux? I've noticed most Linux apps and games are free, whereas, Steam is causing Linux games and apps to become more and more non-free. \nDo you think that Steam really deserves to be allowed on our software respositories?\nEven though Steam is causing a major uprise in the amount of Linux users, does it really follow the Linux idea that the apps and games on Linux are meant to be open-source?\nFree as in freedom,\nOpen as in open to editing and customization. \n\nA: \nIs Steam for Linux an open-source application?\n\nShort answer: No.\nLong answer: Steam is a closed source application that it is included in the non-free repositories. The non-free repositories include all applications that one or other way, don't fit the FOSS philosophy and policies. That said, since Linux/Ubuntu is an open source anyone can install, modify and redistribute the software as they see fit, following the licences imposed over the code.\n\nDoes it deserve to be on Linux?\nDo you think that Steam really deserves to be allowed on our software repositories?\n\nShort answer: As you see fit.\nLong answer: As said previously, openness means that you can accept almost anything, not that you are tied to a single thing. If you don't like Steam, just don't use it. If you don't like non-free applications, just don't use it. People have the freedom to select what they use or don't use in any open-source operating system. It applies for what they want and what they don't want.\n\ndoes it really follow the Linux idea that the apps and games on Linux are meant to be open-source?\n\nShort answer: As you see fit.\nLong answer: I don't know from where you got that idea. Linux was meant to be freely distributable, modifiable and viewable (from the source code perspective). Who and how they use the core, unless they are infringing some licensing, is entirely up to the end user/developer. If the user wants Steam, and the company behind sees a market, why shouldn't they develop an application and distribute it as the see fit?\nIf you don't like their ways, just uninstall the program and delete the non-free repository. Nobody will blame you for anything. You are in your right to decide what to run or not in your system as they are in their right to develop for the same system.\n\nA: Yes, because it's bringing business to Linux. Gaming should really start to move away from Windows 8, but not toward Macs. So what's left? Linux. They can't give games away for free, and you're paying for great content. What's not to love?\n", "Q: when using mv command What is ./ Thanks to whoever answer.\nI'm trying to install VoIPMonitor on Ubuntu12.04..LTS.\nHere is the previous command:\nwget \"http://www.voipmonitor.org/download-gui?version=latest&major=5&festry\" -O w.tar.gz\ntar xzf w.tar.gz\n\n-what is -O w.tar.gz doing?\nThen, the next command is:\nmv voipmonitor-gui*/* ./ \n\nHere is where I'm stuck. This command is moving the previous downloaded file and unpacking it to where? What is ./?\nThanks\n\nA: ./ is your current working directory, which is $PWD == $(pwd).\nBTW: -O is output the document to a file. Another form -O- | xxx or -O - | xxx is also very common, which outputs the downloaded document to stdout and pipe it to other commands.\n\nA: The software you are downloading from the url given must have been a zipped file.tar is a tool in linux systems (among other zip-unzip tools) which is being used in your command, \nand as stated by @Terry Wang ./ denotes your current directory, so the next command is basically moving your software from the directory where it was unpacked to your current directory\n\nA: This command downloads a file:\nwget \"http://www.voipmonitor.org/download-gui?version=latest&major=5&festry\"\n\nIf you just run this command on its own, the name of the file that will be downloaded will be download-gui?version=latest&major=5&festry\", because that's what wget sees in the URL.\nThe -O option allows you to rename the file you're downloading. So -O w.tar.gz renames the file to w.tar.gz; so basically after the download finishes, you'll find a file called w.tar.gz, that's the file you downloaded.\nThe next command is:\ntar xzf w.tar.gz\n\nWhich extracts w.tar.gz. It will extract a folder called voipmonitor-gui-6.0-SVN1062 and a file called voipmonitor-5.0-SVN-onlyforbackwardcompatibility.\nThe next command:\nmv voipmonitor-gui*/* ./ \n\nWill move everything from under the folder voipmonitor-gui-6.0-SVN1062 to the current directory. So ./ means \"current directory\".\nExample:\nIf you've downloaded the file to your Downloads folder, this will be your folder structure after extracting:\n\nDownloads/\n    voipmonitor-gui-6.0-SVN1062/\n          [lots of files]\n    voipmonitor-5.0-SVN-onlyforbackwardcompatibility\n\nAfter the move command, you'll move [lots of files] to Downloads.\n\nDownloads/\n    [lots of files]\n    voipmonitor-gui-6.0-SVN1062/\n          empty\n    voipmonitor-5.0-SVN-onlyforbackwardcompatibility\n\n", "Q: Why can't I restart cron daemon in 12.04 LTS?

Due to a zram bug leading to machine lock-ups, I've had to disable zram.\nI thought dpkg --purge zram-config as well as commenting any reference out of /etc/rc.local would do the trick, but the module (and its ominous dmesg warnings Buffer I/O error on device zram0, logical block 257912) keeps getting loaded.\nI've grepped /etc/init and /etc/init.d for zram and there were no matches. I've even redefined mkswap to log how it was called (because the \"buffer errors\" occur when mkswap touches protected memory) -- amazingly I didn't get any calls. So I can't figure out what configures zram (calling mkswap + swapon).\nI've taken to breaking the zram.ko to stop its loading. But I would still like to figure out what specific init script loads it. Any ideas?\nNote that I'm looking for answers about how to track down which init or startup script configures zram -- I know very well that the bug might already be fixed, that you can disable zram in several ways etc, and such answers would be off-topic.\n\nA: Try this (adapting the initrd location):\n$ mkdir /tmp/x\n$ cd /tmp/x\n$ zcat /boot/initrd.img-3.8.0-31-generic | cpio -i\n$ grep -lR zram .\n./scripts/init-top/compcache\n./lib/modules/3.8.0-31-generic/kernel/drivers/staging/zram/zram.ko\n./lib/modules/3.8.0-31-generic/modules.dep\n./lib/modules/3.8.0-31-generic/modules.dep.bin\n./lib/modules/3.8.0-31-generic/modules.order\n./sbin/compcache-enable\n./etc/udev/rules.d/80-compcache.rules\n\nThe second last is the culprit, the last one shows the calling parameters. The script /etc/init/zram-config.conf wants to make one zram device per core, the one above is making a single one with 50%.\nI can confirm that the last sector is bad in /dev/zram, probably an off-by-1 bug. A system with zram and the default settings will crash when it tries to use that sector. The options I see:\n\n*\n\n*Add swapoff /dev/zram0 to /etc/rc.local (Most basic).\n\n\n*Blacklist zram (But will this unload it first? Because it's loaded in the initial ramdrive).\nOtherwise, if you want to use the zram, you must add -c to the relevant mkswap, and hope for the best, i.e., that everything works apart from the last sector. Reference: this post\n\n\n*Add the -c to sbin/compcache-enable from inside the initrd image and repack (lost with kernel upgrades).\n\n\n*Add -c to /etc/init/zram-config.conf. You also need a swapoff and rmmod before its modprobe, because the zram is already set when it runs, so setting the size will fail.\nI chose 3 for now, but dmesg is still polluted with those Buffer I/O errors. I'll be watching for crashes, now at least I know where they come from.\n\nA: I prefer to have ZRAM off, since I already use a disk partition for swap.  I'm on 13.10 on one machine and 12.0.4 on another.\nI would suggest another possible change to /etc/init/zram-config.conf, to stop zram swaps completely.  Assuming you're using the default Runlevel of 2, change the line:\nstart on runlevel [2345]\n\nto\nstart on runlevel [345]\n\nI've used the same trick on /etc/init/tty1.conf, to leave bootup console messages for view.r.\n", "Q: I cant copy a file in the var/www directory I installed mediawiki on a Lubuntu virtual machine which is running on virtualbox. \nI configured and installed the mediawiki and now I need to copy the localsettings.php file in the var/www directory.

Is it serif or sans serif or something else ?\nI have installed msttcorefonts already. Now in my Latex document I am preferring not to use Times New Roman as I found after a little browsing that there may be issues when compiling with pdflatex. I am preferring to stick to pdflatex, at least at this moment. This is the reason for asking the closest alternative.\n\nA: \nWhat is the closest alternative font of Times New Roman in Ubuntu 12.10? Is it serif or sans serif or something else ?\n\nI don't know which exact font of those that come by default with Ubuntu 12.10 would be the closest visually to Times New Roman (though Liberation Serif seems a good fit), but:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"serif\" fonts have serifs. That's the little ornament or line at the end of the glyph lines. Serif fonts are typically used in print for large blocks of text, as they are generally considered easier to read when the resolution is high enough to properly render the serif.\n\n*\"sans serif\" fonts lack serifs (that's where the \"sans\" comes from; it's French for \"without\"). The ends of the glyph lines are straight and terminate abruptly. This is commonly used when the font size is small relative to the medium's resolution or dot pitch, because the extra ornamentation at the end of the glyph lines would obscure the shape of the glyph itself. Examples of sans-serif fonts include many fonts normally used for headlines, fonts used for computer screen menus, and so on.\nIt follows from the above descriptions that Times New Roman is a serif font. Hence, to find something similar, you want to look at other serif fonts.\n\nA: I think FreeSerif is the closest:\n\nI guess it’s pre-installed in Ubuntu, by the way you can download it from FontSpace.\n\nA: The PostScript language defines 35 core fonts in PostScript 2. Among them is the serif font family Times. Times was Linotype's copy of Monotype's Times New Roman, which was commissioned for The Times in 1931. A properly configured system should automatically substitute one of the following fonts, if available.\n\n*\n\n*Microsoft has included Times New Roman with its operating systems.  Since Adobe chose Linotype's Times for use in its products, Monotype was forced to modify the original design to fit Times metrics. There was also a bitmap version \"Tms Rmn\", which was later renamed \"MS Serif\". (ttf-mscorefonts-installer)\n\n\n*Red Hat commissioned a set of fonts designed to be metrically compatible with Microsoft fonts. The equivalent of Times New Roman is Liberation Serif. They have a significantly different look and feel from the original fonts. (fonts-liberation2)\n\n\n*Google commissioned the Croscore fonts, designed to be metrically compatible with Microsoft fonts. They appear to be slight modifications of the Liberation fonts. The Times New Roman equivalent is Tinos. (fonts-croscore)\n\n\n*URW released open-source clones of the 35 Postscript fonts for ghostscript. The Times equivalent is Nimbus Roman. The metrics are slightly different from Times New Roman.\n\n\n*GUST TeX Gyre is based on the URW fonts. The Times equivalent is TeX Gyre Termes. (fonts-texgyre)\n\n\n*GNU FreeFont is apparently based on the URW fonts, but metric compatibility was not retained. The Times equivalent is FreeSerif. (fonts-freefont-ttf)\nOther fonts of interest:\n\n*\n\n*STIX fonts were developed by the Scientific and Technical Information Exchange project to provide a comprehensive set of mathematical symbols and alphabets for the scientific and engineering community. They have a Times-like design, but do not appear to be metrically compatible. Apple has included these fonts with some of its products.\n\n\n*PT Astra Serif was developed by ParaType for use with Astra Linux. It is metrically similar to Times New Roman.\nSee also.\n\n*\n\n*ArchWiki: Metric-compatible fonts\n\n*What is the closest font to Helvetica available on Ubuntu?\n\n\n\nA: According with Linux Font Equivalents to Popular Web Typefaces, FreeSerif may be what you need (considering that you do not want to install other fonts):\n\n\nA: \nLiberation is the collective name of four TrueType font families: Liberation Sans, Liberation Sans Narrow, Liberation Serif and Liberation Mono.

I have an old computer, which runs Ubutu 10.04 LTS. There were numerous problems with drivers when trying 12.04, so I rolled back to 10.04, and am scared now to try something new as not to ruin the whole system. Besides, I dislike the whole Unity thing.\nThe computer is not usually connected to the itnernet, so security patches are not a big issue.\nWhat is bugging me, however, is that software in the repositories is ancient. And while backporting security patches to the kernel might be cumbersome, setting up a build server for the newest version of most programs should be straightforward and cost no more than $1000 (mostly for HDD-s) in hardware, one time.\nWhy is recent software not available for Ubuntu 10.04? Are there non-standard repositories, taht do this?\n\nA: But it isn't cheap to support old software...\nA build server is not just a processor and storage. It has to live somewhere, ideally a data centre, honking up a load of power. Then there are the people to look after that server. We're talking thousands a year just to run your build platform.\nAnd this software lives in a stack. Kernels, versions of X and desktop components. These components have changed pretty widely between 10.04 and 12.04 (and will even more by 14.04). Given that developers tend to target \"the latest LTS\", backporting changes gets harder and harder every time. You call it cumbersome, I call it multiple hours developer and tester time per backport. That time isn't cheap.\nA support schedule exists and explains what it means by \"support\". What you're asking for is well outside that schedule both in longevity and expectation. If you want to keep running on an old and now unsupported platform, you're free to. You can either run unmaintained software indefinitely at your own risk or you can bear these \"cheap\" costs yourself. Set up your own repository and build server and pull in all the latest packages of the things you want. It's all out there and you're free to do it. Should be simple, right? Right?\nNo. It's not a Sunday afternoon project. Really the only sustainable option is to get onto a platform and make your peace with it. 12.04 is supported until 2017 (with hardware enablement stacks available to modernise it further) so I would suggest you upgrade and get your problems fixed.\n\n*\n\n*Driver issues are usually transitive (especially if it was working in an older kernel). You should be reporting regressions as bugs and helping the developers help you.\n\n*UI issues like \"I don't like Unity\" are simply side-stepped by not using them. The desktop is very modular. Compatibility versions of Gnome 2 (Cinnamon, mate, gnome-fallback, etc) exist and other desktops (XFCE, KDE, Gnome 3) are also out there vying for your attention.\n\n\nA: \nWhy are old distributions not partially supported indeffinetely if this is very inexpensive?\n\nThey are but it is not inexpensive. Just 1 simple thing like dependencies is going to be a nightmare. \n\nWhy is recent software not available for Ubuntu 10.04?\n\nBecause it would require people from Canonical to spent time on an old release where they are needed to help with the newer versions and most will rather make new stuff. So this is done on a requested amount of programs. That system is called \"backports\". \nBackports: \n\nWhat are Backports\nWhen Ubuntu releases a new version of its OS every 6 months, that release is largely frozen in time. While the software that is part of that release will get bug fixes and security patches, new major releases of software and the new features that come with them will not be available.\nThat’s where Ubuntu Backports comes in. Backports offers a way to selectively provide newer versions of software for older Ubuntu releases. Most commonly, the Backports team will provide new versions of standalone applications which can be safely updated without impacting the rest of the system.\nSecurity Support for Backports\nUnlike the packages released with Ubuntu, Backports do not come with any security support guarantee. The Ubuntu Security Team does not update packages in Backports. When a package which has been backported receives a security update, the Ubuntu Backporters will make a best-effort attempt to update the backport. \n\nBut... backports need to be requested.\n\nRequesting a Backport\nBackports must be approved by the Ubuntu Backporters team, but anybody can request a backport. As backports require testing before they can be approved, the backports team recommends that requesters of backports also test them when possible.\nBackports are requested by filing a bug against the appropriate backports project, as listed here. The Ubuntu Backporters team recommends using the requestbackport tool in the ubuntu-dev-tools package to file backport requests. This tool is aware of many conventions for backports and can walk you through most of the verification steps.\nDuring the initial evaluation, the backports team will evaluate the request against the following criteria: \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Validity of the Backport\n  \n*Package Availability \n  \n*Source Packages Only\n  \n*Ensuring a Safe Upgrade Path\n  \n\nFrom comment: \n\nIf not, any advice on how to handle ancient hardware that most parts of are not supported (at least out of the box) in 12.04.\n\nIf that is the case: it is a regression and those are -bugs- and should be treated as such. \nAny Ubuntu release should include all hardware support available in any previous releases + bug fixes found for this release.\nAnd a final note:\nNothing can stop you from making your own backport packages. All you need is a launchpad account and on your systems the following packages sudo apt-get install ubuntu-dev-tools gnupg-agent. On how to continue see ...\n\n\n*\n\n*http://opensourcehacker.com/2013/03/20/how-to-backport-packages-on-ubuntu-linux/ \n\n*http://architects.dzone.com/articles/how-backport-packages-ubuntu (backup of 1st link).\n\n\nA: If you want newer versions of all packages, then why not get the latest release: 13.04?  That is precisely what a new release is: newer versions of all packages.\nIf, however, you want to keep most packages at their 10.04 versions but upgrade only a select few packages to their newer equivalents, that's not a simple task at all - in fact it is a very difficult task.\nThe effort required to backport software includes modifying the software to make it compatible with older versions of the libraries it depends on for its build.\nIn some cases this is not too difficult, because earlier versions of its dependencies might not differ too much.\nHowever, in other cases, an earlier version of a dependency may work quite differently, or may not even have existed.  In this case the software either requires quite extensive rewriting to work around the lack of compatibility with its older dependencies, or some of its dependencies will need to be backported too, which can have flow-on dependencies.  If you were to carry this to the extreme, you would end up with a system that consists of a large number of packages from later versions anyway (also known as a \"mixed system\" because it consists of packages that don't all come from the one Ubuntu version).\nYou could do this a lot more easily just by initiating an upgrade to the latest version of the operating system, which would negate the need to run a mixed system and would require no dependence on backports.\nMy advice would be to try and sort out whatever problems you're having with the later version of Ubuntu.  It will be a lot easier than trying to get support for a much older version.\n", "Q: Which file is called or event is fired when we plug-in / plug-out power supply to the laptop? Everytime I plug-in or plug-out powersupply the CPU frequency is changed to 'powersave' which results in reduced efficiency. I need to be on 'performance' all the time. I've made a small java utility which I use to turn my CPUs on performance. But this is kind of a too-much-repetitive process as I've to run the Java utility every two hours, whenever I plug-in or plug-out powersupply. Any idea where I can place the commands like this:-\ncpufreq-selector -c 0 -g performance  \ncpufreq-selector -c 1 -g performance\n\nso that everytime I plug-in or plug-out powersupply then the CPUs are set to performance automatically.\nI've Jupiter installed so I believe that might be the culprit. Uninstalling Jupiter is one thing that I haven't tried, however, I'm really interested in knowing what's the standard way of doing this.\n\nA: When you plug in/out the AC adapter, the scripts in /etc/pm/power.d get called with an argument: \"true\" (if you run on battery), or \"false\" (if you run with the power adapter).\nAs far as I know the only package that ships with a \"power.d\" script that does what you say is powernap-common, specifically its file: /etc/pm/power.d/cpu_frequency. Therefore the first thing to do would be to remove that file.\nAnyhow, the default scaling governor in Ubuntu is ondemand, not performance. The ondemand governor is set by /etc/init.d/ondemand during boot. So you may either modify (or replace) /etc/init.d/ondemand or add a new script to /etc/pm/power.d in order to set the performance governor.\nNew script to /etc/pm/power.d\nSo I suggest you to create a new file /etc/pm/power.d/frequency-scaling with the following contents:\n#!/bin/sh\nset -e\nfor f in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor\ndo\n    echo performance > \"$f\"\ndone\n\nThe give it executable permissions:\n# chmod +x /etc/pm/power.d/frequency-scaling\n\nModify /etc/init.d/ondemand\nJust open /etc/init.d/ondemand and replace all occurrences of ondemand and interactive with performance.\nNotes about performance\nYou probably already know, but I must add that the performance scaling governor will make your CPU run always at the highest frequency. This means that often your computer will consume more power than required and will heat more than it should.\nInstead, interactive/_ondemand_ gives you both speed and power saving.\n", "Q: Swap partitioned drive not able to access I am new to Ubuntu however I installed it on drive (D) as my other partition (C) has Windows installed. \nI had selected a partition (F) for swap area while installing. \nNow I have un-installed Ubuntu from (D), but Windows is unable to see or access the swap area that is (F). It does not displaying (F) in 'my computer'. \nHow do I get that partition (F) back, as it has got some information on it that I need.\nI also read in a forum to use 'manage' option and then delete the partition, but, I am unable to do that, as I have got info in that partition (F).\nIs it possible to remove swap area without losing any info in that partition?\n\nA: \nI had selected a partition (F) for swap area while installing.\n\nTo explain this I need to star with a clarification of partitions, filesystems and volumes.\nA disk is usually one physical device. *1.  \nA partition is a piece of that disk.   If you wish you can compare the disk with a book, and the partition with a number of pages (e.g. page 100 till 150).\nA filesystem is a way to write information to the disk. E.g. take a number of blank pages, add horizontal lines to write on, add special marking on the first page to contain a title etc etc.\nA volume is what is exposed to the user. It is the result of a filesystem on a raw disk (using the whole disk) or on a partition. Your F:\\ would be a filesystem, as are C:\\ and D:\\\nYou wrote: \"I selected a partition (F) for swap area while installing.\".\nLinux has two ways of using swap:\n\n\n*\n\n*To a file on a disk.\n\n*To a raw partition or a raw disk.\n\n\nUsually the second option is chosen because it skips the overhead of a filesystem. Briefly said it is simpler and faster. *2\nThe way I read your post you selected the partition previously available as volume F:\\ to be used as a swap partition. Then mkswap was used on it when needed information was paged out from memory to this partition. This overwrites any data which was previously present.\nAll this means that your old data on F:\\ is gone. If you never needed the swap then you might recover it with some programs, but it is ever was used then the data has been overwritten. \nTo recover F:\\ as empty space: \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to disk management (start, run, diskmgmt.msc).\n\n*Change the filesystem on what is now swap (0x83) to something windows recognizes (e.g. to the ID of NTFS).\n\n*Reformat.\n\n\nYou now have your old F:\\ volume back.\n\nI have un-installed Ubuntu from (D), but Windows is unable to see or access \n  the swap area that is (F). It does not displaying (F) in 'my computer'.\n\nWindows sees the swap partition just fine. However it is not in a format that it can use.\n\nHow do I get that partition (F) back, as it has got some information on it that I need.\n\nTo get it back, see the 3 points with diskmanagement.\nTo get the information back, restore F: using those three option and restore the data which you need from your backup.\n\nI also read in a forum to use 'manage' option and then delete the partition, \n  but, I am unable to do that, as I have got info in that partition (F).\n\nIn all likelihood you no longer have that information on that partition.\n\nIs it possible to remove swap area without losing any info in that partition?\n\nNo, because to already wiped that information.\n\nIf you have no backups and really need that information then turn off your computer. Remove the disk and take it to someone who can make a raw image if the disk and who can attempt*3 recovery on that. \n\n*1: Usually because I am ignoring external drives with internal HW RAID.\n*2: Windows used to do the same. One or more partitions for the OS and one partition for swap. Later they abandoned this in favour of swapping to a file. This is the default C:\\pagefile.sys. It is probably a wise marketing choice to do it that way.\n*3: Attempt. If you actually used the swap partition then there is nothing to recover.\n\nA: You won't be able to get many things from the SWAP, it's used to store datas that are usualy stored on your RAM.\nIt's used for various reason like lack of memory or to hibernate.\nThen you shouldn't have much information to recover on your SWAP\nfor more detailed information on SWAP I invite you to read this:\nhttp://www.linux.com/news/software/applications/8208-all-about-linux-swap-space\n", "Q: jenkins-common package for latest jenkins builds I am required to upgrade jenkins due to a bug breaking our builds, I've used the jenkins repository from http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/debian/ and have come up against a wall.

Where can I find a correctly-versioned jenkins-common?\n\nA: An unsavoury workaround for the problem is to edit /etc/init/jenkins.conf and comment out or remove the line $JENKINS_ROOT/bin/maintain-plugins.sh. This will prevent the missing script from being called (the only part of jenkins-common actually required.)\nI've now held the packages to prevent that change being overwritten without manual intervention but it's not a very stable state to be in, so a better solution is very welcome.\nI also had to ensure that libjna-java was not installed in order to allow jenkins to start (a known conflict with hard-coded libpam.so location in openjdk6 apparently)\n\nA: @SimplySimon is valid option, just that you have to use apt-get like sudo apt-get install jeckins-common. But! The source is the same, just that Debian/Ubuntu likes to separate packages in architecture specific and valid for all.\nIf you are installing from the original maintainer, they normally just create a single binary. I think you have all the jenkins packages since the package you are installing has a 54MB size while jeckins-common in the repositories only weight ~30MB with other minor packages that sums about the same as the full package.\n", "Q: 13.04 no context menu after rabbitvcs install I was using rabbit in 12.04 LTS and then upgraded to 13.04 while rabbit menu was gone.

I Wanted to install qtstalker, a stock market app on my Ubuntu 13.04.\nqtsalker is not available in the Ubuntu software center and sudo-apt-get install qtsalker gives the error: Unable to locate package qtsalker.\nHow can I install qtstalker in Ubuntu?\n\nA: *\n\n*The name is qtstalker So why do you use qtsalker? But is will not work with the correct name since it does not exist in Ubuntu. \n\n*The newest PPA I can find mentions Lucid (says enough does it not?) \n\n*http://sourceforge.net/projects/qtstalker/files/qtstalker/qtstalker-0.36/ shows a .tar.gz and not a .deb So if you want to install it from source read the readme and the installation method in the tar file and use this as a reference: How do I install a .tar.gz (or .tar.bz2) file?\n\n\n\n*\n\n*qtstalker is available from 'precise'.\n\n*I found a .DEB here: http://mirrors.ccs.neu.edu/ubuntu//pool/universe/q/qtstalker/qtstalker_0.32-3.3ubuntu1_i386.deb so might be worth a shot to try and install it in 13.04 (download it and double click the download and USC will take over).\n\n", "Q: How to make Firefox use the newest Java version, which is already installed? Apparently, I have OpenJDK 6 JRE (openjdk-6-jre 6b27-1.12.6-1ubuntu0.12.04.2) and 7 JRE (openjdk-7-jre 7u25-2.3.10-1ubuntu0.12.04.2) installed in parallel – I don't know why I have both of them, I can't remember installing any of them manually.\nHowever, the Firefox Java plugin is occasionally reported to be out of date by some websites, and it seems to me that it relies on JRE 6. How can I make Firefox use the newer version? Removing JRE 6 seems like a bad idea; when I attempted to do so in synaptic it appeared to me that a lot of software still relies on the older JRE, since removing it would have removed programs like jedit as well.\nDo I mix up stuff? I'm not even sure how the FF plugin interferes with the OpenJDK JRE's.\nEDIT:\nHaving tried even more, the problem persists. Using update-alternatives --config java, I see that the default Java version (with status \"manual mode\") is already set to Java 7, and java -version returns \"1.7.0_25\". The file /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-i386/jre/lib/i386/IcedTeaPlugin.so exists, but still Firefox shows the Java 6 plugin when looking at about:plugins.\nTo sum it up:\nHow do I make Firefox use the IcedTea plugin belonging to the default Java version?\n\nA: Install the version 7 of the icedtea plugin either from the software center or using command line:\nOpen a terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T and enter:\nsudo apt-get install icedtea-7-plugin\n\nRemove the older icedtea:\nsudo apt-get remove icedtea-6-plugin\n\nThen restart Firefox and type about:plugins to check the version of java plugin. Or go to java website to check the version as well as if it is working properly.\nHope this helps\n\nA: Most of those websites are using javascript to check what version of Java your browser is running and since it does not match the Oracle Java version they complain that you need to update Java in your system. I would ignore any of those messages if the Java applets are working properly.\nTo check what version of Java Firefox is running just type on the location bar (address bar) about:plugins, it should display all the plugins Firefox is using.\nI bet Firefox is using the latest JRE and the websites are just complaining that it is not the same version as Oracle is. Keep your system updated and ignore that.\n\nA: If you're using Fedora you need to install\nsudo yum install icedtea-web\n\nRestart your browser after this.\n\nA: You likely need to install the relevant plugin package to go with your java version:\nsudo apt-get install icedtea-7-plugin\n\nThis plugin works with the main browsers: Firefox, Chromium, Google Chrome, and Epiphany. You'll need to restart your browser for the plugin change to take effect.\nMore information:\nhttp://apt.ubuntu.com/p/icedtea-7-plugin\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java\n", "Q: I can't watch movies online with my Firefox I am using Ubuntu 13.04 and I cannot watch movies online with my Firefox. I have tried installing Flash player for Windows, but it won't start installing.\n\nA: First,I don't understand Windows Firefox in Ubuntu. So, I make an assumption that you are running Firefox which came preinstalled with Ubuntu. I suggest that you download the Adobe Flash plugin from the Ubuntu Software Center:\n\nNote that this is the last official version you will get.\nYou can also try Gnash, if you wish.\n\nA: Well your first problem is attempting to use a windows application in Ubuntu.\nThe Adobe Flash Plugin can be installed for firefox from the Ubuntu Software Center. The major issue with Adobe's flash player is that it will never receive another update for linux. \nOtherwise I'd recommend installing Google Chrome as Adobe Flash Player comes pre-bundled with the browser.\n", "Q: Boot-repair won't install \"unable to locate package\" My computer won't boot so I am trying to install boot-recovery using the instructions from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair.

Ubuntu 11.10 has no support from canonical anymore since 9 May 2013 so it seems a good idea to upgrade anyway. \n", "Q: How to start the text mode installer from the Kubuntu 12.04 DVD? I'm trying to install Kubuntu 12.04 from the DVD, and I want the text-mode installer. I don't see how I can get to it from the boot menu. What should I enter as the boot options? Or should I start the installer from the command-line after boot?\nNotes: \n\n\n*\n\n*In the F4 modes menu, I only see the 'normal mode'.\n\n*I know I can achieve this with the alternate boot CD. But I want this on the DVD, with all the packages the DVD has (e.g. for installations with no Internet access).\n\n\nA: For text based install you need to get the Alternate CD.\nThe text based alternate installer can be downloaded from the various download methods above. This installation CD is suited for computers unable to run the graphical desktop based installation, either because their computer does not meet the minimum requirements for the live CD or because their computer requires configuration after the installation is complete in order to use the desktop. The alternate installer also includes advanced features such as LVM support.\nDesktop Alternate 32bit CD, and Desktop Alternate 64bit CD.\nAdded info\nThanks to soulsource, the Kubuntu website does state that \"The DVD includes both the live image/desktop installer and text based alternate installer\".  So how to start the text based installer from the DVD?  Well I had to download the DVD version of Kubuntu, and once booted from the DVD, I was presented with a menu, one of the options was to Install Kubuntu in text mode.  See image below.\nNote: The Kubuntu CD is 704MB, where as the DVD is 3.7GB.  Make sure that you downloaded the right file.  The CD version will not have the text install, for that you need to get the Alternate CD.  Where as the DVD version will have the live image/desktop installer and text based alternate installer.\n\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu Gnome 3.0 Ctrl+Alt+Shift+R Screencast Recorder not working I'm trying to record a video, but nothing is happening when I'm pressing Ctrl+Alt+Shift+R, while the wiki claims that I'm supposed at least to see a red circle at the bottom. \nAre there some prerequisites?

Ubuntu for all platforms (laptops+mobiles) must respect and contain Government of India's Root CA and CA Certificates and improve compliance with Indian IT Act 2000 (Cross Certification) and law enforcement rules by including these  by default:\n\n\nRoot Certificate 2011\n\n\nRoot Certificate 2007\n\n\nOther CAs (2011 and 2007):\n\nAny reasons for missing these out on Ubuntu, a globally renowned and acknowledged Operating System from national security,security architecture ... perspectives?\nManually adding these certificates does not make sense for global product like Ubuntu Operating System\nAny ETA on any update/upgrade/new release to fix this issue?\n\nA: Why must Ubuntu respect Indian law?\nMozilla handles the certificate vetting for most Linux distributions (and most applications - even Chrome uses's Mozilla's NSS AFAIK) and they're bundled into ca-certificates along with some Debian infrastructure certificates.\nMozilla is the party that the Indian government has to prove their value to. They've been in this process since at least 2009 but it can take a long time. Here are others in the process.\nRoot certificate inclusion is a huge deal. It requires a lot of real world verifications, a lot of additional bureaucracy and paperwork and security checks that frankly go a lot further than appeasing the petty demands of a national government.\n\nIf you trust a certificate, including it in your install is pretty simple, just don't expect everybody else in the world to trust everything you do. And certainly not on your schedule.\n\nA: Ubuntu gets its list of certificates to trust from Debian. Debian gets its list of certificates to trust from Mozilla. Mozilla has processes to ensure that its list of trusted certificates includes only certificates from organisations that are worthy of that trust.\nAs Oli pointed out, the certificates you want trusted by default are already going through the process to get trusted in Mozilla. If Mozilla approves their inclusion, they will end up trusted in Ubuntu (probably within a release or two).\nThe process exists to ensure that rogue organisations cannot compromise the security of all users, and that legitimate organisations have adequate procedures and policies in place to make sure that their security and integrity cannot be subverted by third parties.\nIgnoring this process could significantly compromise the security of Ubuntu users.\nIt is not appropriate to bypass this process.\nIf Mozilla are being unreasonably slow, then an alternative process could be developed for fast-tracking certificates into Ubuntu without compromising users' security. I suppose this might be possible if you can convince Ubuntu developers that this is a good idea. But in the absence of such an alternative process, Ubuntu users will need to wait for Mozilla's approval.\n", "Q: How do I force wget to use a proxy server without modifying system files? I'd like to know an equivalent to wget enabling me to set the proxy while calling the command (like wget --proxy=$http_proxy).\nAny ideas ?\n\nA: The -e option allows you to provide commands as in wgetrc at the command line\nso you do not need to change a file ...\nwget -e use_proxy=yes -e http_proxy=$proxy http://askubuntu.com\n\n\nA: Without modifying your system files at /etc/wgetrc you could create a file at your home directory ~/.wgetrc. It will enable you to modify wget settings locally at user level. Now write the following at ~/.wgetrc to use wget behind a proxy server:\nuse_proxy = on\nhttp_proxy =  http://username:password@proxy.server.address:port/\nhttps_proxy =  http://username:password@proxy.server.address:port/\nftp_proxy =  http://username:password@proxy.server.address:port/\n\nIf you do not have proxy username and password just write the proxy-address and port everywhere like,\nhttp_proxy =  http://proxy.server.address:port/\n\nThis should work. I am assuming you already have proxy settings for all other applications.\n\nA: You need to edit the wgetrc file located at /etc/wgetrc.\nUse your favourite text editor, ie: nano /etc/wgetrc to edit it \nLook for the http_proxy tag and remove the # in front of it, add the proxy server after the = sign, ie:\nhttp_proxy=http://foo.proxy:8080\n\nThen search for the use_proxy tag and remove the # in front of it, save the file.\nwget will be then using the specified proxy server.\nIf you can't change system configuration with your user you can copy the current configuration to a place you can edit it, ie: cp /etc/wgetrc ~ and use the --config=~/wgetrc option to force wget to use the configuration you altered instead of the global configuration.\n\nA: Option that is not mentioned, but should be mentioned: Use environmental variables (depending your distro):\nhttp_proxy=http://<proxy-server-ip>:<port>\nexport http_proxy\n\nor simply\nexport http_proxy=http://<proxy-server-ip>:<port>\n\nSame for:\nhttps_proxy=http://<proxy-server-ip>:<port>\nftp_proxy=http://<proxy-server-ip>:<port>\n\nYou can include a username and password, if you have special characters in your password be sure to include the '-s.\nhttp_proxy='http://<username>:<password>@<proxy-server-ip>:<port>'\n\nExamples:\nexport http_proxy=http://172.16.1.100:8080\nexport https_proxy='http://johndoe:ABC!123@172.16.1.100:8080'\n\n\nA: From the command line only I've found success preceding the wget command with the http_proxy information without the need of using the environment variables.

Yesterday I started the upgrade from 12.10 to 13.04, but I interrupted it because it was taking too long. Now if I restart it, it doesn't proceed.\nIs there any possibility to clean the mess it left when I interrupted it and make a clean restart of this update?\n\nA: Try these steps, from the command line:\nFix broken dependencies:\n$ sudo apt-get install -f\n\nIf it still doesn't work, try this to fix/reconfigure the existing, unpacked-but-not-yet-configured packages:\n$ sudo dpkg --configure -a\n\nThen try the upgrade again.\nIf it fails again, you may want to delete all the already- downloaded packages (they should be stored in /var/cache/apt/archives), do\n$ sudo apt-get clean\n\nThat will clean up the packages but if you're still stuck in some weird state, I'm not sure what else to suggest.\n$ sudo apt-get autoremove -y\n\nThat will remove any now obsolete packages.\nOf course, before you do anything you should back up any important contents of your /home/dave directory (or whatever your $HOME directory is).\n\nA: My 16.04 to 18.04 upgrade had interrupted as I had stopped the process by mistake. I guess the process was towards the end (installing wifi packages). Nothing of above worked and kept giving \"dpkg fronend is locked by another process\". A system reboot followed by\n$ sudo dpkg --configure -a\n\nresumed the process and completed upgrade to 18.04 successfully.\n\nA: For me things were a bit different: the process stopped on the download step (because of a power failure).\nSo no screeen to resume and no packages broken because none were installed, but do-release-upgrade was asking me to upgrade 850 packages first...\nThe fix was to restore the file /etc/apt/sources.list with mv /etc/apt/sources.list.distUpgrade /etc/apt/sources.list and same for all *.distUpgrade in /etc/apt/sources.list.d.\nThen a simple apt update putted the system in a clean state and I was able to do the release upgrade normally.\n\nA: Thanks for your hints. I first intended a reboot through the UI. The request was accepted, the screen went blank, but nothing else happened after that. You could see small disk activity for about 30min.\nI then used SSH from a Win laptop to login in the Ubuntu system, entered\nsudo pkill dpkg followed by sudo dpkg --configure -a.\nAfter these, the Ubuntu 20.04 upgrade resumed at the point I had accidentally interrupted it before. 20min later it completed and requested a system reboot.\nAfter the reboot it worked like a charm. Openhab, minidlna, smb and all other services restarted as expected.\n\nA: It appears that sudo screen -D -r will reconnect to a disconnected install in a 12.04 to 16.04 upgrade. This means no killing of packages or anything like that. This assumes that you didn't actively stop the upgrade, just lost access to the session.\n\nA: Seems sudo screen -D -r works well on\n16-17\n17-18\n16-18\nWill save the hassle of trying to fix the packages or roll back\n", "Q: problem with the installation of wireshark ubuntu \"make\" failed I need to install Wireshark but it seems to have some problems when I type sudo make command.

After wiping the HDD and installing ubuntu server 12.04.3 LTS amd64 on it, I am now trying to gain access to the DRAC which I believe is version 4. I have properly configured the DRAC to use it's own IP on my LAN and when I point my browser to the IP address, I am greeted with the DRAC login page (it has the dell logo and everything). However, after trying the credentials of root/calvin, I was denied access. So I think that the previous owners had set their own password. After doing some reading, it appears that I can reset the credentials to the default using\nracadm config -g cfgUserAdmin -o cfgUserAdminPassword -i 1 newpassword\n\nbut upon entering the command, I get this error:\nbash: /usr/sbin/racadm: No such file or directory\n\nThis holds true even if I run\nsudo su\n\nprior to running the racadm command.\nIf, however, I run\nsudo racadm config -g cfgUserAdmin -o cfgUserAdminPassword -i 1 newpassword\n\nthere are no errors. Yet, when I try to log into the DRAC via the web interface using the credentials of root/newpassword I am still not granted access.\nI installed the dell utilities via the guide at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportMachinesServersDellNotes. I first tried to install the 64 bit version that is on the dell repositories, but after that was unsuccessful, I just followed the guide verbatim. No errors were produced in either case. I even followed the information at the bottom of the guide by executing\nsudo pppd /dev/ttyS1 1382400 crtscts noipdefault noauth lock persist connect 'chat -v \"\" CLIENT CLIENTSERVER \"\\\\c\"'\n\nbut obviously, replacing the /dev/ttyS1 with the correct information for my system.\nls -l /usr/sbin/ | grep racadm\n\nyields\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root    root        87930 Sep 16 04:03 racadm\n\nI have tried these credentials after each attempt of changing the password:\nroot/calvin\nroot/newpassword\nadmin/calvin\nadmin/newpassword\nAll have been unsuccessful. What is the next course of action that I should take? \n\nA: As a workaround, racadm is available on the \"Dell Systems Build and Update Utility\" bootable CD. For my PE 2950, I used version \"6.5.0,173_A01\" (filename \"cdu_1.6_core_173_A01.iso\") from \nhttp://www.dell.com/support/drivers/us/en/19/DriverDetails?driverId=NF1CT\nTo make sure you get the right download for your system, start at http://www.dell.com/support/drivers/us/en/555/ServiceTag/XXXXXXX (where XX... is your Dell \"service tag\"), then search under \"Systems Management\".\n\nA: Reboot the server, and pressing CTRL-E during bootup (at the console), takes you to a BIOS version of the racadm admin. There you are able to set a username/password.\n", "Q: Wired connection problem (Ubuntu 13.04, Realtek RTL8111/8168 Ethernet controller) Last week, I experienced a problem with wired connection on my Ubuntu 12.04 installation. I'm in a college dorm and I have to connect to the dorm network using 802.1x security. It worked great on both my Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04 installations (dual boot) until the connection started failing on Ubuntu. It would start to try to connect (Network Manager icon going ''up and down'') and after 30-40 seconds a window would jump out, asking me to enter my username and password for 802.1x.

I don't know if there's still a problem, or is the entire lightdm going to be removed? (Since I didn't choose kdm during KDE install so I'm stuck with lightdm).\nAnd what's all the fuss about the graphic driver removal?\nCan someone please explain to me?\n\nA: It definitely won't remove LightDM, since that's currently the display manager for Ubuntu. The upgrade shouldn't remove your alternate desktop environments, but if it does, then you simply need to reinstall them again though software center. \nGraphics drivers are a little more challenging. You'll need to open System Settings, then click on Software and Updates (near the bottom).\n\nNext, you'll want to click on the right-most tab (labeled Additional Drivers), then have a look at what's listed there. If there are any binary drivers selected, you'll see a line at the bottom saying \"1 Proprietary Driver is in use.\" If you see this, you'll want to choose the X.org drivers instead. On my system, with an Nvidia graphics card, I see this initially:\n\nAnd after selecting the correct driver, I see this:\n\nAfter this, you can click on Apply changes at the bottom, then restart your system.

The difference seems to be using only internal gpu or both (the dedicated nvidia optimus).\nIf setting to integrated, I can boot Ubuntu without acpi=off, but when setting to \"switchable\" I need to set acpi=off in grub options.\nMy question is why or how is the acpi option related with the dedicated gpu? \nI'd like to use my laptop also for gaming so I'm depending on \"switchable\". How's the name of the boot option to fix my gpu issue without completely disabling acpi? Since I have here a bunch of options but I don't understand the differences due lack of knowledge.\n\nA: The circumstances summerized are: you need acpi on for bumblebee to work, but you can only install the os with acpi off.\nThis issue appears to only affect ubuntu 12.04 and around that, because since 14.04 and onwards I haven't had this issue anymore (on the same hardware and also other similar hardware). The correct time modifying kernel parameters was key:\nBefore Installation\n\n\n*\n\n*Set gpu-mode to switchable in BIOS\n\n\nDuring OS Installation\n\n\n*\n\n*Set acpi=off as custom kernel parameter before starting os installation\n\n*install as usual\n\n\nAfter finished OS Installation\n\n\n*\n\n*install bumblebee\n\n*remove acpi=off as custom kernel in grub configuration\n\n*reboot\n\n\nYou should now be able to boot with working graphics and working bumblebee.\n", "Q: Print multiple lines starting with \"D\" after multiple greps I have two text files.

Alternatively, most tools align partitions properly by default. I thought that the Ubuntu installer did this, but either it's got a bug or you prepared your partitions using some other tool. If the latter, you could simply delete the partition and re-create it with the Ubuntu installer to fix the problem.\nIf you need more help, I recommend you boot an emergency disc and show us the output of one of the following two commands:\nsudo gdisk -l /dev/sda\nsudo parted /dev/sda unit s print\n\n", "Q: Why can i not print to a network attached printer from Ubuntu?

And in fact I've already done it, and it seems to have at least mostly worked, but I'm wondering whether this one anomaly is likely to be attributable to the downgrade; to wit:  I have no window borders|decorations, but only wide, featureless, white---or sometimes black---margins around all my windows.  None of the settings in System Settings (the window border and decorations options are in Workspace Appearance) seem to have any effect.  Is this likely to be fixable, or should I cut my losses and reinstall (formatting the /home partition and restoring any data with rsync)?\n\n\nA: I had similar issue when I downgraded from 13.04 to 12.04 (the unity version) without formatting my /home directory. I couldn't change the unity dash settings or even change the wallpaper. It seems that downgrading do not reset those settings.\nI solved my problem by deleting all configuration files/folders in my /home folder:\ncd /home/user_name\nsudo rm -rf .*\nsudo reboot\n\nThis will delete any files/folders begining with a '.' and then reboot your pc, correct configuration files will be generated during boot.\n", "Q: Startup Disk Creator fails to erase disk Before extracting an ISO image onto a USB device using Startup Disk Creator, when I try to erase the USB device using the same software, I always get the following error:\n\nI have tried to erase various USB devices without success, so I believe this is not a device-specific problem.\nI see that a bug on this has been filed on launchpad, though an alternative/solution/word-around has not been suggested.\nIs there a way to solve this error, without using other softwares to erase disk?\nSystem specifications:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 12.10\n\n*Startup Disk Creator 0.2.4\n\n\nA: Try this.

Then I switched back to the graphical session/login.  It had a message that indicated that the session was locked and that I would be redirected to a login. I waited perhaps 7 seconds and the lightdm-greeter appeared. I was able to login. GUI session intact.\n\nA: I've been having the same issue on Debian Sid and find removing the .Xauthority file rectifies it, although not a very reliable solution as I have had to do it every time I reboot, it's a workaround that enables me to get back to my gui.\n\n\n*\n\n*Rename  the file /var/lib/lightdm/.Xauthority to /var/lib/lightdm/.Xauthority-BAK with\nsudo mv /var/lib/lightdm/.Xauthority /var/lib/lightdm/.Xauthority-BAK\n\n\n*Restart lightdm service with\nsudo service lightdm stop\nsudo service lightdm start\n\n\nA: I started experiencing this issue after applying the current lightdm patch last week. The greeter would fail to start due to lack of access to /var/lib/lightdm/.Xauthority, the result being a low graphic mode error which could only be resolved for one session by removing /var/lib/lightdm/.Xauthority. This issue seems to be caused by this new patch which gives the .Xauthority file much tighter permissions (600 rather than 664). See the following:\n\nlightdm (1.6.0-0ubuntu3.1) raring-security; urgency=low\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*SECURITY UPDATE: wrong permissions on .Xauthority file (LP: #1175023)\n  \n*\n  \n*debian/patches/07_xauthority_perms.patch: use g_open instead of\n  g_file_set_contents in src/xauthority.c.\n  \n*debian/patches/08_xauthority_fix_perms.patch: fix incorrect\n  permissions left behind by previous versions in src/xauthority.c.\n  \n*CVE-2013-4331\n  \n  \n\nThe suggested fix above seemed to work for about a half-hour until the old behavior returned, with the additional problem of stale .Xauthority files being left behind with 600 permissions in user home directories, causing graphical login loops.\nTo work around this issue, I have created a wrapper script for xfce-session-logout (I use XFCE) which removes .Xauthority from both user home directories and from /var/lib/lightdm. Since this script must use sudo to assume the correct authority to remove /var/lib/lightdm/.Xauthority, this is hardly ideal, although it works. Using gdm also avoids this issue. My situation is also complicated perhaps by the fact that I access the local system via the console and via xdmcp.\nTo address the security issue in the patch above, Ubuntu needs to patch whatever other programs (the greeters for example) need access to .Xauthority since currently by fixing the security issue, they have effectively broken lightdm. That is not very good.\n", "Q: `make install` fails apparently due to typo, but not in makefile: How to find and fix? I'm trying to install the fujitsu-usb-touchscreen drivers from here, on Kubuntu 12.04 on my new Fujitsu LifeBook P1630. (See fujitsu-usb-touchscreen on kubuntu 13.04 (64-bit) on P1630: `make` errors.) I downloaded the .zip file, unzipped it, and ran make in the directory thus created; this all worked as expected.  However, when I run sudo checkinstall (which invokes make install), things go less well.  On the first attempt the installation aborted with the following error:\nmake: execvp: /etc/init.d/fujitsu_touchscreen: Permission denied\nmake: *** [install] Error 127\n\nI eventually resolved this by\n$ sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/fujitsu_touchscreen\n\nBut although a second sudo checkinstall then does not give the execvp error, it still fails at a later stage, and the log (on stdout) shows this dpkg error:\ndpkg: error processing /home/archelon/fujitsu-touchscreen-driver/cybergene-fujitsu-usb-touchscreen-112fdb75b406/cybergene-fujitsu-usb-touchscreen-112fdb75b406_amd64.deb (--install):\n unable to create `/sys/module/fujitsu/usb/touchscreen/parameters/touch_maxy.dpkg-new' (while processing `/sys/module/fujitsu/usb/touchscreen/parameters/touch_maxy'): No such file or directory\n\nAnd, indeed, there is no /sys/module/fujitsu/usb/touchscreen/parameters/touch_maxy; there is, however, /sys/module/fujitsu_usb_touchscreen/parameters/touch_maxy, and this is presumably what was intended.  But this incorrect filename does not appear in the makefile or any other file in the directory, at least not that I can find.  Nor does it appear, as I discovered after running sudo checkinstall --install=no as suggested below, in the .deb package created by checkinstall.  \nWhere might such a typographical error be originating, and how would I go about fixing it?\nEdited to add: I'm viewing the contents of the .deb file with ark, Kubuntu's default tool.  It contains only three files: control.tar.gz, data.tar.gz, and debian-binary. data.tar.gz contains the directory tree that appears to match up to the usual root filesystem, with /etc, /lib, /sys, and /usr directories. (Looking at other .deb files on my system, this structure appears to be typical.) Here's a screenshot:\n.\n(Full size.)\nHere's another screenshot showing that control.tar.gz contains three files, one of which is empty:\n.\n(Full size.)  \nHere's the actual .deb file: https://www.dropbox.com/s/odwxxez0fhyvg7a/cybergene-fujitsu-usb-touchscreen_112fdb75b406-1_amd64.deb\nEdited 2013-09-28 to add:\nAfter reinstalling Kubuntu 12.04 again, this time recreating the /home partition (which, again, had been generated during an install of 13.04), I can no longer reproduce this error.  I am still curious to know how the underscores got changed to slashes, but it looks as though nobody has any idea.  It is perhaps also of interest to note that while I have still not successfully run checkinstall against this package, I have done make install; it requires the executabilization of /etc/init.d/fujitsu_touchscreen and the installation of hal, and the GUI freezes shortly after installation completes, and there is no particular new functionality afterwards that I have noticed, and the system can no longer resume from being suspended; however, this will be pursued elsewhere.\n\nA: There is a known issue with checkinstall that generates file system errors such as you have demonstrated above. In my own usage of checkinstall I routinely use the following option with my command line to get around a probable bug:\nsudo checkinstall --fstrans=no\n\nThe man pages give this:\n\n--fstrans \nEnable/disable filesystem translation. Filesystem translation enabled causes the install to proceed in a temporary directory, thus not actually touching your system.\n\nNot a satisfactory solution but until the bug is fixed it seems to be required...\n", "Q: Laptop Charger Not Recognised Properly on Samsung NP900X3F Firstly thanks for your time.\nSecondly, having an issue with my power charger on my Samsung Series 9 NP900X3F.\nWhen I boot into Ubuntu with the charger plugged in it recognises it as charging.

However, software may appear to work fine, only until the bad section of the memory is accessed. When it does get accessed, the application accessing it, will probably crash. It may be that in your normal usage of Windows, you are rarely hitting the point in the memory where it is bad, or you are simply expecting things on Windows to crash, and expecting them not to on Ubuntu. It is quite difficult to make a direct comparison between the two systems, as you will personally have different expectations of their behavior, the software is different, and your usage of the software is different.\n", "Q: font stuck in Wingdings Hello Ubuntu Community,\nMy son inadvertently changed the computer font to Wingdings and now we cannot figure out how to get back a readable font.

I just tried to install Ubuntu on my Asus X550C, and this is the first time I've had to deal with EFI and stuff. Now, my computer does launch on grub, but I have like 10 names for Windows (EFI, Launcher, Recovery etc...) and I'd just like to know which one I need to use to run Windows.\nAdditonal info if you need it: http://paste.ubuntu.com/6120471/\n\nA: Looks to me like you'll want to use either the /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootx64.efi or /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgr.efi entries. Those are Windows specific (and actually most likely copies of the same file with different names).\n", "Q: How do I use MAAS custom commissioning scripts? I am attempting to use a custom MAAS commissioning script to perform custom operations on my MAAS cluster. When do these scripts run? How should they be named? Do they need to be in a particular format, or can they be executable shell scripts or binaries?\n\nA: Please find steps to achieve this:\nStep 1: prepare shell script as per your requirement\nNote: Commissioning scripts built into MAAS will have names starting with \"00-maas\" or \"99-maas\" to ensure that they run first or last, respectively. \nStep 2 : Open MAAS Dashboard ( http://localhost:5240/MAAS/settings/ ) and Go to “Setting” tab.\nStep 3 : Upload your shell script under commissioning script section.\nStep 4 : Start commissioning for target machine and reboot the target machine.\nBesides, following Restful MaaS API also available to perform the same.\nList commissioning scripts:\nGET /api/2.0/commissioning-scripts/\nCreate a new commissioning script:\nPOST /api/2.0/commissioning-scripts/ \nRef: https://docs.ubuntu.com/maas/2.1/en/api \n\nA: What are you looking to accomplish with custom MAAS commissioning scripts? In my experience so far I have not had to load custom scripts and have made use of these examples and files in these locations installing MAAS and juju\nhttp://maas.ubuntu.com/docs/configure.html - this link will take you to some better examples of I think what your looking for. \n/usr/share/maas/preseeds/generic\n/usr/share/maas/preseeds/preseed-master\n\nHope this helps,\n", "Q: can't start mysql service anymore I had MySQL running ... with many different databases.

You can simply open a terminal by hitting ALT+CTRL+T and then type man command-name to open the manual to learn more about a specific command and what is does. (e.g.: If you need to know about ls.. then type man ls and hit, magic happens!). \nYou may also refer Ubuntu Documentation to learn more\n\nA: Best place to start: Man pages. In the terminal type man [command] This will bring up the manual page for that command. (eg. man apt-get) More information can be found here\n\nA: If you want to learn how to use the terminal, you just have to start with getting a good understanding of the basics and work your way through it.\nYou will find many good basic guides and tutorials through Google. I will list a few to begin with.\n\n\n*\n\n*UsingTheTerminal (Official Ubuntu Documentation)\n\n*Learning The Shell\n\n*Linux Command Reference Guide\nThere are also pretty good Youtube videos for absolute beginners: \n\n\n*\n\n*Basic Linux Shell Commands - Part 1\n\n*Eli the Computer Guy - Basic Linux Tasks\nWhen I first started using Linux, I found the manual pages confusing and hard to use. But if you learn how to master them, they become a very useful aspect of the terminal.\nI don't remember every command I ever used.. I've got the command apropos and google for that :) Enjoy the terminal! \n\nA: Another good place to start is the book Introduction to the Command Line from FLOSS Manuals. \nNote that this manual is not restricted to Ubuntu, and you'll learn how to do a lot of things from the command line using several programs, some of which you might need to isntall in your Ubuntu if you want to use them. No problem, as the book will show you how to install programs as well.\n", "Q: Are updates released all at once or ad hoc? Does Ubuntu have a fixed package update cycle like Microsofts patch Tuesday? Or are packages just updated and released ad hoc.  I've checked around and can't find an answer which makes me think they are released as and when they are needed.\n\nA: They are released as and when they are needed.\nUsers will see security updates immediately.  But otherwise, the Software Updater will (by default) only notify users once a week.\nThere is additionally some experimental support for phasing updates out to a higher and higher percentage of users over time.  This isn't widely used yet, to my knowledge.  But it's built into the infrastructure.\n", "Q: Unable to access my encrypted internal hard drive with Win 7 on it I'm quite new to Ubuntu and I've tried all the post related to my issue but couldn't solve it. I'll try to give as much information as possible. \nI'm using 12.04 LTS on an external hard disk and boot my machine with Ubuntu. The external Hard disk on which Ubuntu is installed is partitioned into two: P5 and P6. P5 is the one where Ubuntu is installed and P6 is for storage purpose. \nWhen I logon to Ubuntu, I'm not able to mount my internal hard disk. If I use sudo fdisk -l, I can see the internal drive there but when I try to mount it, it gives me NTFS Signature is missing. Here are the results of the two cmds:\n$ sudo fdisk -l\n\nDisk /dev/sda: 320.1 GB, 320072933376 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 38913 cylinders, total 625142448 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0xeef597d0\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *        2048   625139711   312568832    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n\nDisk /dev/sdb: 250.1 GB, 250059350016 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 30401 cylinders, total 488397168 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x389ea96f\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sdb1              63   106710400    53355169    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sdb2       106711040   488392703   190840832    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n\n\n$ sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /media/external\nNTFS signature is missing.\nFailed to mount '/dev/sda1': Invalid argument\nThe device '/dev/sda1' doesn't seem to have a valid NTFS.\nMaybe the wrong device is used? Or the whole disk instead of a\npartition (e.g. /dev/sda, not /dev/sda1)? Or the other way around?\n\nHere I'd like to inform that my internal hard disk is encrypted and is protected with a pwd. When I normally bootup my machine, it first asks me to enter the HDD pwd and then the encryption pwd and then it logs me into Win 7.\nI think that it's because of the HDD pwd and encryption that I'm not able to mount my internal drive to Ubuntu but not sure. \nIs there a way that I can mount my internal drive onto Ubuntu without removing the HDD pwd or encryption on my internal drive?\n\nA: It looks like Ubuntu 12.04 doesn't out of the box support this kind of Encryption.  You can install some software from Symantec that should be able to mount the drive altough I cannot confirm this there is a article regarding this below.  It looks like you need to be able to login and download the software.\nhttp://www.symantec.com/business/support/index?page=content&id=TECH198150\n", "Q: L2TPV3 Support out of the box I'm looking to do a L2TPv3 Pseudowire over ethernet. The Linux code has been around since 2.6 in the kernel, but Ubuntu doesn't seem to support it without a kernel recompile. What is your suggestion to address the issue?\n\nA: The ip utility is usually built to match specific kernel versions so L2TPV3 probably is not something easily added in the default install. Looking at the bigger Linux version it seems that L2TPv3 is not yet on the radar: Redhat, SUSE,  OpenBSD and Ubuntu do seem to have it in the kernel, but none of them have it enabled. \nSo options ...\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Ubuntu and compile it yourself. Besides that you could open a bug making a case for it to be included.\n\n*Use another operating system that does support it out of the box. One distribution that does enable L2TPv3 is Debian Squeeze, but only in their optional 2.6.38/39 kernels. \n\n\nA: 13.10 (Saucy Salamander) now includes the required kernel modules by default.\n", "Q: One Ubuntu laptop on wifi occasionally makes other laptop's connection slow There are two Dell laptops on our home's wifi:\n\n\n*\n  \n*Inspiron 1525\n  \n*Latitude E5420\n\n\nThese connect along with several other devices (iPad, phones) with which we have no trouble at all. The laptops are both running Ubuntu 12.04.\nSometimes the laptops both work fine; but occasionally - often after a good hour or more of simultaneous use - one or other laptop will suddenly experience a very slow wifi connection. If the working laptop's networking is disabled, the problematic laptop's speed bounces back. Re-enabling the networking kills the problematic laptop's connection again. This has happened with each laptop sometimes having the problem; usually the one nearest the router is most likely to be OK.\nHere's some of the things I've ruled out:\n\n\n*\n\n*MAC and IP addresses are different (sudo ifconfig). But then if they were conflicting, then the problem would surely not be intermittent!\n\n*Power management is turned off for both wifi connections (sudo iwconfig)\n\n*Router and ISP have both changed while we've had this problem: we switched broadband providers from O2 to The Phone Coop, but the problem persisted; at the same time we went from a Speedtouch router (I think) to a Technicolor TG582n. So it's unlikely that's the problem.\n\n*Link strength is OK; but then again, unless two completely different routers had link strengths varying in similar ways, then you'd expect that to be the case.\n\n\nTesting for a possible bug in the wl drivers (suggested by @Braiam) below, the output is as follows.

If you can not even boot your hard drive and can not even enter setup...these steps occur before the booting of Ubuntu.  Try pushing in the memory cards and drive connectors.\nDo you get any beeps as the PC is booting?\nDoes the Initial motherboard boot accurately display the memory installed? If the memory is detected, I would try some system diagnostics by booting from a liveCD e.g. you installation DVD you used to install 12.04.\nIn Linux, you rarely need to reset the computer when it freezes.  If you do this while something is being written to critical areas of the hard drive in any operating system, you can cause file system corruption. This may explain why your computer may be appearing not to boot. Even though your computer may appear frozen, usually the kernel is still accessible and cane be made to safely reboot from a frozen state \n", "Q: How to force audio from speakers and headphone Im looking to install ubuntu on my laptop, problem is that I damaged the headphone socket and it thinks there is always headphones plugged in.

I read that the swap area should be twice the size of your install RAM and I figured /home should take the space you have left, but how big should / be?  \nFurther to this, I have two 500GB hard drives and want both of them to be available when I use the computer. Should I put / and swap on one drive while letting /home be on the other or should I put all partitions on one drive? If putting all partitions on one drive is the best option, what file-system should the other drive use?\nOh and just to clarify: I don't want to dual boot — just want the whole system to run Ubuntu.\n\nA: The swap being twice your ram rule is from the days of 4-32 MB of ram.  If you have at least 1 GB of ram, 1x swap is more than enough.  Most people recommend not bothering with swap at all if you have at least 4 GB of ram, at least if you don't intend to hibernate.  The minimum required size for / is 6 GB.  10 gives a little breathing room to install a few applications, but 20 would be better.  There also is little reason to bother keeping / and /home separate, so I suggest just sticking with one large partition and the default ext4 filesystem.\nIf you have two identical drives, you may want to use the alternate installer and create a raid0 ( stripe ) array to use them both and get better performance.\n\nA: You can custom partition by assigning the entire \"/home\" to the second HDD and \"/\" on the first HDD. Don't worry about SWAP unless your RAM is less than a Gig. File system should all be ext4.\n\nA: Given the setup with two 500GB hard disks, I recommend you look into Logical Volume Management (LVM). This adds to the complexity of setup, and is something new to learn, but it simplifies matters in the long run. With LVM, you add one or more partitions or disks (called physical volumes in this system) to a volume group, from which you allocate logical volumes, which hold filesystems in much the way that partitions do in simpler configurations. The advantage is that logical volumes are treated like files in a filesystem, so they can be manipulated much more flexibly than can partitions. In your case, a big point is that a logical volume can be bigger than either of your disks. In your current setup, if you use regular partitions, you'll need to split your user space across two disks. Ubuntu itself doesn't need even 1/10th the capacity of one of your disks -- perhaps 30GB for Ubuntu's root (/) plus a generous swap partition. That leaves about 470GB on one disk and the entirety of the second disk free. In a conventional partitioning system, that means two mount points (/home and somewhere else), and you'll need to manually manage what files goes where. With LVM, though, a logical volume can span multiple hard disks, so you can have a 970GB /home and not worry about filling up your main /home directory vs. wherever you mount your additional space.\nLVM also simplifies adding space. If you add a third disk, you can add it to the volume group and then extend any or all of your logical volumes to make use of that new space. LVM obviates the need to move partitions, and expanding them becomes safer.\nThat said, Ubuntu's desktop edition doesn't have good LVM support, so you'll need to jump through some extra hoops to set this up. The page to which I linked earlier covers how to do this, so read it to decide if you're comfortable with those extra actions. LVM's extra redirection can also make it harder to recover your filesystem if something bad happens at a low level, like if the LVM data are damaged.\n", "Q: Disabling touchpad after suspend/resume There are several questions about disabling touchpads on laptops on this site, but none of them seem to quite answer my question.\nI want to disable my touchpad (I've done that bit) and keep it disabled after a suspend/resume (I am failing here).\nI am running Ubuntu 12.04 on a cheap Chinese laptop.\nI have an executable file /home/yannick/bin/notouch which looks like this:\nxinput set-prop `xinput list | grep \"ImPS/2 Generic\" | awk '{print $7}' | sed \"s/id=//\"` \"Device Enabled\" 0\n\nThe script runs xinput once to get the id number of (what turns out to be) my touchpad, and then runs xinput again to disable the touchpad. I have it in my .bashrc and in other places.\nAt present, when I suspend and then resume my laptop, the touchpad comes alive again and I really want to stop this happening. So I also have a file\n/etc/pm/sleep.d/97disable_touchpad (owned by root, +x) which looks like this:\n#!/bin/bash\ncase \"$1\" in\n    thaw|resume)\n        /home/yannick/bin/notouch 2>/tmp/notoucherrors\n        ;;\n    *)\n        ;;\nesac\nexit $?\n\nAnd darn it, it doesn't work!

How do I make this happen?\nHere are two other things I tried and that I couldn't get to work:\n1) $synclient TouchpadOff=1\nThis returns\nCouldn't find synaptics properties. No synaptics driver loaded?\n\n2) System Settings -> Mouse and Touchpad. I only have options for mouse there (I would even go so far as to say that ubuntu thinks that my touchpad is a mouse for some reason). In particular there is no option to turn the touchpad off -- all I have is mouse options (general, pointer speed, drag and drop, double-click timeout).\n\nA: I have a partial workaround which will do for now -- I randomly set the DISPLAY variable and hope. Works for now. I also run notouch as my userid (rather than root).\nMy disable_touchpad script in sleep.d now looks like this:\n#!/bin/bash\ncase \"$1\" in\n    thaw|resume)\n        echo \"running notouch\" >> /tmp/notouchlogger\n        export DISPLAY=:0\n        su -c - yannick /home/yannick/bin/notouch 2>>/tmp/notoucherrors\n        ;;\n    *)\n        ;;\nesac\nexit $?\n\nand it seems to work.\n\nA: With root privileges, try creating the file /etc/pm/sleep.d/0000trackpad.\nsudo -i gedit /etc/pm/sleep.d/0000trackpad\n\nenter you password if required past following code in gedit and save file\n#!/bin/sh\ncase \"$1\" in\n    resume)\n        DISPLAY=:0.0 su USER -c '/usr/bin/synclient TouchpadOff=0' ;;\nesac\n\nlog out and back in again\n\nA: Create a file /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/95-disable-touchpad.conf with following content:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n        Identifier \"libinput touchpad disable-by-default\"\n        MatchIsTouchpad \"on\"\n        MatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\n        Driver \"libinput\"\n        Option \"SendEventsMode\" \"disabled\"\nEndSection\n\nThis disables all touchpad devices from sending X events.\n\n*\n\n*If you later want to enable (first) touchpad:\n\n  xinput --set-prop \"$(xinput --list --name-only | grep -i touchpad | head -n 1)\" \"libinput Send Events Mode Enabled\" 0 0`\n\n\n*\n\n*to disable it again manually:\n\nxinput --set-prop \"$(xinput --list --name-only | grep -i touchpad | head -n 1)\" \"libinput Send Events Mode Enabled\" 1 1\n\nTested successfully on  Dell Latitude 5520 with Debian Bullseye on suspend/hibernate/resume/thaw, but it should be similar elsewhere.\nAlso, one can apparently use Option \"SendEventsMode\" \"disabled-on-external-mouse\" instead so the touchpad is only disabled if no external mouse is connected, and is left enabled otherwise (but I have not tried that configuration).\n", "Q: THE simplest/easiest possible way to remote into an Ubuntu desktop? I'm going to set up a new Ubuntu install for my dad. I know there will be times he'll be asking for help, so I need a way to remote into that box (a free solution). What do you guys recommend?\n\nA: Ubuntu ships with remote desktop but it is off by default. Search for \"desktop\" in dash and it will show \"desktop sharing\". Your dad needs to check the top choice (and do make him set a password).\n\nIt is the easiest method for your dad. Your side needs installation but that is not to difficult (and you probably are already familiar with it). You need to have open-ssh server installed on your machine. \nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\nAnd all you then need is his IP and his password to take over his machine.\n\nThere are other choices that are web only like logmein or teamviewer but remote desktop is already available.\n\nA: Honestly for easy adhoc support to friends and family Teamviewer is a great \"free\" as in beer option.  No need to setup port forwards or bounce off servers to get it going.  They have .deb packages available for download from their site.  I find that the x86 multiarch is most compatible across most new Ubuntu releases.\nYour dad just has to launch it and tell you the 9 digit ID, you then punch that in at your end and the connection is setup through teamviewers servers.  You can also setup unattended access so you can remote in without the need for your dad to do anything.\n", "Q: How to install a package from launchpad which doesn't belong to a PPA?

Compose key doesn't allow me to make a custom shortcut, nor does dead keys.\n\nA: If you want to remap more than a couple keys, it sounds like you want to create a custom keyboard layout, a question which has been asked here before:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to set up a custom keyboard layout?\n\n*Is there a tool to quickly create custom keyboard layouts for international keyboard, greek and unicode math?\nOn the other hand, it isn't too hard to remap a few keys. Let's do the ones you asked for.\nThe xmodmap command can be used to remap the keyboard. For example, for the mappings you mention, create a .Xmodmap file in your home directory (note that I'm using >> rather than >, so it appends to rather then replaces the file):\n$ echo keysym Alt_R = Mode_switch >> ~/.Xmodmap\n$ echo keysym C = c C ccedilla Ccedilla >> ~/.Xmodmap\n$ echo keysym U = u U udiaeresis Udiaeresis >> ~/.Xmodmap\n\n... where 'ccedilla' is ç and udiaeresis is ü (both of which I just entered using this method, though I personally prefer the compose key method). I'll explain this in more detail below.\nIf you want these settings to be used every time you start the Ubuntu GUI (i.e. X server), you should then create (or edit) a file called .xinitrc in your home directory, and add this line (if it's not already there, which it probably isn't): xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap\nYou can also type xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap from your terminal to test your settings.\nNote that there is no simple way to tell xmodmap to \"undo\" mistakes other than restarting the X server (if you've made them load automatically via .xinitrc, you'll need to fix .Xmodmap first)! However, you may be able to reset things to defaults by using setxkbmap -layout us (changing 'us' to whatever is appropriate for your normal layout).\nTips: To experiment with xmodmap mappings, you can run the commands one at a time, from the command line, e.g.:\n$ xmodmap -e 'keysym U = u U udiaeresis Udiaeresis >> ~/.Xmodmap'\n\nAnd you can use xmodmap -pke to show the current keymappings, or just xmodmap -p to show the modifier (Alt, Ctrl, etc.) mappings.\nFor a list of keysyms that you can remap, see this (which is where I found 'ccedilla' etc.)\nhttp://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/X11/keysyms.txt\nAs promised, here is a brief explanation of the 3 lines I suggested putting in your .Xmodmap:\nThe first line will ensure that your right Alt key is treated as AltGr, as it already is on certain international keyboards. Unless you are in the USA you probably don't need that line.\nThe 2nd and 3rd lines remap the C and U keys, respectively.\nYou'll note that there are 4, space-separated entries after the '=' sign on each line. Here's what they mean:\n\n\n*\n\n*The 1st is what you want the key to produce when you press it alone (i.e. a the 'c' key enters a lowercase 'c').\n\n*The 2nd is what to produce with the shift key (Shift 'c' enters\nuppercase 'C'). \n\n*The 3rd is what will be produced when you press the key with your newly-remapped right Alt key\n\n*The 4th defines what to produce when you press the right Alt key, a Shift key, and the letter key.\n\n\nOther resources/references:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I set Xmodmap on login?\n\n*How do I clear xmodmap settings?\nAnd don't forget to look at the man pages:\n$ man xmodmap\n$ man xev\n\n", "Q: How do I configure my DNS settings in Ubuntu server?

When a release of juju-core is made, the compiled tools\n  matching that version of juju are extracted and uploaded to a known\n  location.

For various reasons, this is far from satisfactory, & my plan is to do a complete rebuild, with Ububtu (64 bit) as the operating system.\nCurrently, I have two 500 GB drives set up as a RAID 1 mirror (I believe they are being supported by what's termed \"fakeRAID\").  Is there a procedure by which, when I have the two drives plugged into the new motherboard, I can then install Ubuntu in such a way as to have it treat them as an existing RAID 1, rather than as two separate discs?  Can this be accomplished by running the software RAID manager from the Live USB device, or what do I need to do, assuming I can do anything?\n\nA: If you don't need to dual boot with Windows, it is best to avoid fake raid.  Blow the array away using the bios utility, and when you install Ubuntu, use the alternate installer to set up a conventional software raid.  You also might want to use raid10 instead of raid1 as it stripes the data as well so you get better performance.  For that you will want to manually run mdadm to create the array and specify either the offset ( optimized more for writes ) or far layout ( optimized for sequential reads ) instead of the default near layout ( which for 2 disks is identical to raid1 ).\n", "Q: enable hibernation for HP Pavilion dv6 laptop with Ubuntu 13.04 I am a new Ubuntu user, having set up my HP dv6 to dual boot Ubuntu 13.04. I found to my horror that closing my laptop and putting in my backback is extremely dangerous - by default closing the lid sends the computer into suspend (still sucking power and causing it to overheat) and that hibernation is not enabled.\nI tried to fix this in line with the answer here. However this still did not enable hibernation. I have googled extensively and have tried many things, none of which seem to work.\nWhen I run sudo pm-hibernate in the terminal, the computer does actually seem to hibernate; but it is only for about 15 seconds and the computer resumes, with the session saved. I don't know if this is a successful hibernation, but it seems not to be since all the tutorials say it is successful if it hibernates, followed by the instruction to manually power back on.\nI'm thinking Ubuntu might not be for me, but my friend says you guys are great and I should be patient. I will follow up asap with any requests for more system information from me - I don't know what you guys might want to see.\nI would greatly appreciate any help, please forgive the wordiness.\n\nI wonder if it might have something to do with my swap partition, so I am posting this capture of my system information:\n\n\nFollowing the request in the comments, I have:\njohn@john-HP-Pavilion-dv6-Notebook-PC:~$ sudo pm-is-supported --hibernate\n[sudo] password for john: \njohn@john-HP-Pavilion-dv6-Notebook-PC:~$ echo $?\n127\njohn@john-HP-Pavilion-dv6-Notebook-PC:~$ \n\n[It had said '0' after echo $?, but after re-running the terminal script I linked to originally, I got a '127' ]\n\nI ran pm-hibernate again and this time it actually completely shut off and I had to restart. It rebooted, even prompting me if I wanted Ubuntu or Win 7 and my session was saved. So that seems like a success.\nMy requested log files are here: https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B1M2FljXnWCbWXBlVkl6NnJIZnc&usp=sharing\n\nA: I have somehow solved the issue. I will leave this question up in case it helps someone in the future.\nI ran the commands that Braiam suggested (which I doubt solved the issue). I booted under Windows later, hibernated under Windows (which has never been a problem). When I started back up, I got the blue screen of death. After rebooting into Linux, I then re-ran the original solution to the hibernation problem which hadn't worked before.

It won't magically allows you run any Windows software without problems. That said, you should check the WineHQ page for each game to know the status:\n\n\n*\n\n*Medal of Honor: Allied Assault: Version 1.1 runs apparently fine with a minor tweak while 1.11 do not. For 1.1 running fine you should use either, a script or run the commands yourself MESA_EXTENSION_MAX_YEAR=2002 wine MOHAA.exe. Here is the script:\n#!/bin/sh\ncd ~/MyWinePrefixes/.MoH/path/to/your/game.exe\n#Run with GL extensions disabled/nVidia card\nWINEPREFIX=~/MyWinePrefixes/.MoH __GL_ExtensionStringVersion=17700 wine ./MOHAA.EXE\n\n(The scripts needs to be tweaked to fit your exact system)\nYou will need wine version 1.5.7 for the fixes to work. Read the comments here.\n\n*Ether Saga Online: This is the Online version, I don't know if it deffers from yours but is the only one in the WineHQ. Version 504 seems to work flawlesssy in Wine 1.2.3 (but Arch Linux), while 510 had problems with the WASD keys, but apparently works without glitches in windowed mode.\n\n*Heroes Of Three Kingdoms: This application was not tested since June of 2010. Feel free to suscribe to WineHQ and submit your tests. Remember that perfomance is not important for the tests, but that the applications installs and run.\n\n*Mortal Kombat Komplete Edition: Here you were unlucky. The latest test in Aug 15, 2013, reports the game works fine and fast even with High video Detail out the box for wine 1.7.0. But seems that it is a know problem and has it fix, thanks to Mike Vaughn:\n\nIf the video settings are left unchanged after being auto-configured, the game will fail to start until its setting files (drive_c/users/[user]/Application Data/MKKE) are deleted. What's weird is the automatic configuration set everything to minimum settings; I had to adjust them to medium/high before I was able to start the game again without resetting its configuration. This isn't a huge deal for me since my somewhat modest system can still handle it without noticeable frame loss, but it might be an issue for others.\n\nYou heard the man.\n\n*King Of Fighters XIII: Only old (Jan 02 2012) test results that placed the game with Platinium (the highest rank). Feel free to update the tests.\n\n\nAs you should have understood by now, Wine needs some tweaks for some games run flawlessy or they won't run at all. The tests are meant for each part of the software while the perfomance is placed at last over functionality. The community behind WineHQ is proactive and they test everything they get hold for each version of wine so bugs introduced in one version will be fixed in the other.

I'm looking for a solution that would display the current mouse cursor coordinates in realtime (i.e. NOT xdotool and NOT xev).\nI need to move the mouse to a certain position, then press Alt-Tab to flip to another window and record the coordinates there. (This would not move the mouse, so the coordinate display would stay the same).\nThere's a Windows program that works BEAUTIFULLY for this purpose - http://download.cnet.com/Cursor-Position/3000-2383_4-75449858.html?tag=mncol;1\n...but it doesn't even start up in Wine.\nAlternately, instead of displaying the coordinates, if this solution could copy the coordinates (in XXX,YYY format) to the clipboard, upon pressing a hotkey, that would be even better.\nAny suggestions would be much appreciated!\nP.S. I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\n\nA: Spartan solution: you can show the coordinates in real-time with xdotool if you create a bash script. Just execute this in a new Terminal:\nwhile true; do xdotool getmouselocation; sleep 0.2; clear; done\n\nChange the value after sleep to make it more or less \"real-time\". This requires bash, the default user shell in Ubuntu.\nBetter solution: if you have admin rights, install watch (sudo apt-get install watch), and then execute this in a new Terminal:\nwatch -ptn 0 \"xdotool getmouselocation\"\n\nIt uses xdotool but does not require bash.\n\nThank you b_laoshi for your suggestion!\n\nA: Get coordinates and copy to clipboard\nDisplaying the coordinates in real-time has already been addressed, so I won't repeat that answer here. By creating a script and configuring a keyboard shortcut to run it, we can copy mouse coordinates to the clipboard in x,y format. Here's how:\n\n*\n\n*Install xdotool for grabbing coordinates and xsel for managing the clipboard.\nsudo apt-get install xdotool xsel\n\n\n\n*Create a new script file with the following contents. Save the script and make it executable.\n#!/bin/bash\nxdotool getmouselocation | grep -oP \"[0-9]+ y:[0-9]+\" | sed 's/ y:/,/' | tr -d '\\n' | xsel --clipboard\n\n\n\n*Create a custom keyboard shortcut that calls your script for the desired key combination.\n\nA: A complete solution to show the mouse pointer location, based on xdotool getmouselocation like the other answers, to display the location in its own xterm terminal:\nxterm -geometry 9x1+0+0 +sb -sl 0 -T 'Mouse location' -e '\n  set -e; tput civis; stty quit \"^[\";\n  while true; do\n    eval $(xdotool getmouselocation --shell) && printf \"%4d %4d\\r\" $X $Y;\n    sleep .05;\n  done'\n\n(this can be written on one line if need be).\nSome explanations:\n\n*\n\n*The -geometry 9x1+0+0 puts the terminal at the top left, with the expected size.\n\n*The +sb tells xterm not to display a scrollbar.\n\n*The -sl 0 avoids an unnecessary scrolling buffer.\n\n*The tput civis makes the cursor invisible (it would be annoying).\n\n*The stty quit \"^[\" allows one to quit with the Esc key instead of Ctrl-\\.\n\n*Concerning the sleep value, I find 0.1 too large; 0.05 seems OK.\n\n", "Q: Does anyone have drivers for a TP-Link TL-WN823N USB wireless I have installed Ubuntu 13 on my system and I have been using a TP-Link TL-WNB23N USB adapter for my wireless on the WIN8 side...

While I always hated iTunes, I'll admit, it was great at managing music and other files stored in the program between an external device and the PC. I don't claim that rsync isn't an amazing utility, I know it is, I'm just not as skilled with it as I hoped to be.\nGoing through the man page a couple of times I came up with the following 2 scripts:\nsyncToSdCard.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\nexec >  >(tee ~/rsync.out);\nexec 2> >(tee ~/rsync.err);\n\nrsync -v -r --delete-delay /home/user/Music/ /media/user/0741-C987/Music/;\n\nupdateSdCardOnly.sh \n#!/bin/bash\nexec >  >(tee ~/rsync.out);\nexec 2> >(tee ~/rsync.err);\n\nrsync -v -r -u --inplace -m --prune-empty-dirs -e --delete /home/user/Music/ /media/user/0741-C987/Music/;\n\nMy goal is to both update the directory on the sdcard with the contents of the directory on my machine, and clean anything that has been moved or removed from the source directory.\nThe first rsync script (syncToSdCard.sh) does this; however, it takes a long time to run.\nThe second rsync script, while it contains the delete option only pushes changes from my local machine (new files and updated files) to the sdcard; this script is extremely fast though.\nWhat I'm looking for is someone who can help me merge the 2 together, to get a fast update with deletion of files that no longer exist on the source (pc) as they do on the target (sdcard).\nCan someone please help me with this?

I have set up an Ubuntu server on an old HP computer. I am trying to use it as a file and print server for two mac books. The print server I have got working (HURRAY!), but the file server is giving me a headache. I am a complete Ubuntu/Linux noob, but have been reading furiously. \nI have set up a shared folder (via Samba) called Primary Share Drive (PSD) on an external HDD on the ubuntu machine. The mac can see the shared folder, but when I click the folder it says \n\nThe operation can’t be completed because the original item for “Primary Share Drive” can’t be found.\n\nI have created a different folder on the internal HDD and it works. I can see it and open it. So, the only difference that I can see is that if I go to the permissions tab in the right click menu of the PSD folder, it doesn't allow me to change the group and others folder and files access permissions; it just defaults it back to none. I have set the share tab to share the folder. \nAny help/insight would be amazing!\n\nA: I just went through what you are going through (same error trying to open a samba-share folder on a linux server from a mac), and it took me a while to get a handle on what was going on. I am also fairly new to linux, so I hope the other forum members will quickly correct me where I've given bad advice. And please forgive the long-windedness of this response:\nI'm guessing Mr. President is right, and that this is a permissions problem. That is, your user doesn't have the permissions to make that folder available to others. So to clarify, the folder that is giving you trouble is on an external hard drive, while the one that works correctly is on your internal hard drive, right? I'm guessing that when your external drive was mounted, your user wasn't given the proper permissions to change anyone else's permissions on that drive, so you can't share it. If you have no idea what I'm talking about with permissions, check this out:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions\nI'm also assuming based on your question, that you're using a gui and not the command line to do this? The way I resolved this was to use the command line, if you've never used it (though I assume you have), check out a tutorial, there's a bunch online. \nYou can see who has what permissions on that drive by cd-ing to it, and running ls -l. If we had the drive \"myHardDrive\", and Ubuntu automatically mounted it, those commands would look like this:\ncd /media/myHardDrive \n#the above is for Ubuntu 12.04, I think in later versions automount it here\ncd /media/<yourUserName>/myHardDrive\nls -l\n\nThis will show you if you and others have the permissions to read and write to the drive (see above link to understand the output).\nI had tried doing chmod to change the permissions, and chown, but they weren't having any effect. The chown command, at least, won't won't work if the drive uses a FAT filesystem since \"owning\" is not supported. Not sure why chmod wasn't working.\nWhat worked for me was to unmount the drive, and manually mount it, specifying the permissions at the mount command. Check out this page to get started with mounting: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Mount/USB\nUnmount the drive, but leave it plugged in.\nAfter having made a mount point (an empty folder) with mkdir, for example:\n    sudo mkdir /media/myHardDrivesNewHome\nFind where your drive is by CAREFULLY running sudo parted -l.\n\"parted\" can mess up your computer if you type the command incorrectly, be very careful. That \"l\" option is the letter \"l\" as in \"list\". My printout for one drive looks like this:\nDisk /dev/sdb: 3001GB\nSector size (logical/physical): 4096B/4096B\nPartition Table: gpt\n\nNumber  Start   End     Size    File system  Name                  Flags\n 1      24.6kB  315MB   315MB                EFI System Partition  boot\n 2      316MB   2190GB  2190GB               AGENT\n 3      2190GB  3001GB  810GB                FAT\n\nI now know that my drive FAT (in my case, a partition on the same drive as the partitions AGENT and EFI etc.), is located in /dev/sdb3 (and AGENT is at /dev/sdb2, etc.). But it's not mounted so don't try to access the files from here.\nMount the drive to the mount point you made earlier, this time specifying who can do what with \"umask\". Give the manual for mount man mount a good read to understand this command, and know what your filesystem is on the HD to make the commands appropriate to your situation.\nsudo mount -t vfat -o users,umask=0000 /dev/sdb3 /media/myDrivesNewHome\n\nBe aware that umask=0000 gives everyone the ability to do anything to the drive, so maybe someone else here will give us a safer value that will still work for you. I'm just beginning to understand how they work and am leaving it at this for the moment. Also note that my drive has a FAT filesystem (I specified this with -t vfat),and if yours isn't those options could be different. Again, all in the man page.\nLastly, you will no longer be able to click on the drive to unmount it after manually mounting it. To unmount, do this sudo fusermount -u /media/myDrivesNewHome. \nI'm guessing that will make it so you can change permissions and share it on your network. Please, anyone comment if I've given a bad piece of advice here. Take care.\n\nA: In Ubuntu create a folder on your home directory. \nmkdir ~/MyShare.\n\nRight click on folder go to Properties and enable sharing for user and guests.\nMount your external drive to MyShare\nsudo mount -o users,umask=0000 /dev/<your device name> /home/User/MyShare\n\nYou should now be able to open this on the mac\n", "Q: Proftpd - (Login failed): Invalid shell: '/dev/null' I'm using proftpd.

Same with Java.\n\n*Some packages are just resources for another package and can be shared between 32bit and 64bit packages (eg Kernel source packages).\n\n\nThe packages that are separated into architecture are either compiled to machine code, rely too much on architecture-related dependencies or otherwise have architecture-dependent code inside (seems unlikely though).\n\n\"Fat\" packages and binaries are something that has been toyed with in the past but you're really talking about doubling the size of most binaries and libraries, as well as introducing unforeseen bugs. It's simply not an advantage worth the cost.\nIt's also worth considering that in most cases developers don't really have to do anything to get architecture specific packages.

How should I specify the \"start on\" condition to run an upstart script when a device (an external disk) is attached?\n\nA: Yes. Have a read of man upstart-udev-bridge. Basically anything that can trigger a udev script can trigger an Upstart event. There's more in the Upstart Cookbook's Bridges section.\nIn your case, we're talking about a block device so here's an example from a StackOverflow post by deft_code:\n#thumbdrive_special.conf\nstart on block-device-added\n\ntask\n\nscript\n   if [ `blkid $DEV` -eq \"YOUR-THUMBDRIVES-UUID\" ]; then\n      /home/you/bin/thumbdrive_special $DEV\n   fi\nend script\n\nThe other route is just using udev to trigger run a script when you plug something in.

I'm using deja-dup to create backups of my documents, but it won't let me backup to two places at once. The backup button is greyed out. Is there any way to do this?\n\nA: \nIs there any way to do this?\n\n/etc/crontab \nAdd a line that copies every so often (or a couple of minutes after the backup is made) files over to that 2nd directory. \nAn example of this would be:\n# m h dom mon dow user  command\n# LogRotate\n07 01 * * 1-5   root    /u1/bin/LogRotate.pl\n\nThis will start script /u1/bin/LogRotate.pl as root on days 1-5 (monday-friday) at 1:07 AM. \nSimilar to this you can create and add a script copying the files made by the backup to a 2nd location. \nThis also works for commands so in theory this is possible:\n07 01 * * 1-5   hannibal  cp -rf /usr/tmp/* /tmp/\n\nand would copy contents of /usr/tmp/ to /tmp/ including directories and overwrite if the file already exists as user hannibal. \n\nA: This is not supported, and probably never will be. A launchpad feature request bug on \"multiple profiles for different target locations\" is here. It is said\n\nI don't see how this profiles feature fits that focus. Supporting it would add a burden of UI complication, development time, testing time, and maintenance effort as there will most certainly be bugs. These distract from the core focus of offering a simple, first-class backup experience for the 80% use case. The biggest 'competitor' (Apple's Time Machine) does not offer profiles AFAIK.\n\nThe request is marked as \"Won't Fix\"\nAs a workaround, you could use rsync for your backups instead (though it doesn't have multiple versioning) or you could change the target manually.\n", "Q: Why does resolvconf change a domain to a search keyword?

After running resolvconf -u, /etc/resolv.conf contains a search xxx.yy instead of the domain xxx.yy. Why does this happen?\n\nA: It happens because the search feature supersedes the domain feature.

You've got  few choices that all revolve around the same core concepts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use less RAM. Find more efficient applications, use fewer tabs, etc.\n\n*Get more RAM. It's cheap and simple to install.\n\n*Allocate more (or some if you don't have any) swap to allow the kernel to page RAM to disk (very slow!)\n\n\nA Kernel panic is a crash that the Kernel can't continue execution from. It does everything it can to shut down devices and flush disks but apart from that, it's stuck and needs rebooting. Consider it a blue screen of death, just not blue.\nThey're usually hardware related because the Kernel is pretty good at protecting itself from software exceptions (for security as much as anything else). Hardware faults are unforseeable.\n\nA: This is to answer the bit about How to fix the kernel panic\nOkay, I know I'm the one who asked the question, but I later found out the answer myself.\nHowever, I should thank 'Oli' , who had previously answered my question.\nThe answer is simple. Check your RAM.\nFind out whether your RAM was connected loosely. Fix it tightly. \nI opened up my motherboard and noticed that the RAM was loose. If you fix it properly, then the panic wouldn't happen.\n", "Q: How can I fix my wna3100 Netgear wireless card always being stuck on \"configuring device\"?

Also, given that this is a card, you could load it in a windows machine, or just search for the driver file online.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Windows Wireless Drivers (ndisgtk)  from the Ubuntu Software Center. \n\n*Then, if you have a copy of Windows, plug your Wireless USB adapter in there and install. Find the driver called bcmwlhigh5 (probably in C:\\program files\\netgear\\wnda3100v2\\driver\\winxp2000\\).\n\n*Copy that driver over to Ubuntu, load up the \"Windows Wireless Drivers\" program, and load in the bcmwlhigh5 driver.\n\n", "Q: Lost around 200 GB of HD space after installing ubuntu I have installed ubuntu about an hour ago, and during the installation I took some horrible steps which accordingly resulted in a terrible conclusion.\nI knew what I was doing. I just wanted to install ubuntu over my windows 7, completely replacing it. First I booted with a USB, selected install ubuntu option, then selected replace windows, and then next, and then I clicked on the install button. Without another word, the installation started immediately. And shortly after then a message box popped over my screen and just told me that I am doomed now(\"The entire disk will be used for install\" or something like that..). And suddenly I noticed that there was a little orange line of text saying \"Advanced partition options\" at the lower middle portion of the screen. I thought clicking the install button will automatically bring me to the partition menu. But sadly that didn't happen.\nWell, you see it was too late. I even tried to interrupt it by restarting during the installation. But after restart, I realized that the damage is done. All the previous partitions are gone. So I completed my installation by partitioning my HD(250 GB) as 2.00 GB for swap and 50.00 GB for linux. And after the installation, guess what? There is no trace of that 198.00 GB HD space. All there is is the file system(which says 255 MB volume) and the HOME(the 50 GB one I guess).\nFrankly speaking, I am a complete noob at OS installation(except windows). So I have no idea of what exactly has happened with my HD. I tried \nsudo fdisk -l \nIt gives me this as output.\nDisk /dev/sda: 250.1 GB, 250059350016 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 30401 cylinders, total 488397168 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x0001c5a7\n\nDevice Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1            2048      499711      248832   83  Linux\n/dev/sda2   *      499712    98156543    48828416   83  Linux\n/dev/sda3        98156544   102062079     1952768   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\nFinally my question--\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to fix all these, I mean can I get my old partitions back? If not the partitions, can I at least have the data which were in the HD before before ubuntu installation? Please, I can't lose them, I have kept those in my HD for almost 5-6 years.\n\n*How to view the HD through file system or something like that? Its like the entire 200 GB has gone missing. I can't find them anywhere.\nLastly, thanks in advance.\nEDIT : This is the GParted version of my current partitions. Now can you please tell me how can I use that unallocated space?\n\nA: Linux is not large. But it writes randomly to hard drive not at beginning like Windows. So much of your data may still be on hard drive, but difficult to get to.\nStop using hard drive, only use live system, but Ubuntu live system uses swap and if you have data in swap area on drive it may overwrite that. Most Linux recoveryCD like parted magic or gparted will boot without activating swap.\nYou can try testdisk. It may see old partitions and deeper search may show files. That would be best case as then you can copy files with full file names. If that does not work then testdisk has photorec which just scans drive for anything that looks like a file, but only restores with file extension not file name. Slow process to run, lots of space on your backup drive needed and then lots of work to rename files. ( I have done it just for a few files and it took forever).\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/DataRecovery\nhttp://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/DataRecovery#Lost_Partition\nhttp://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Step_By_Step\nhttp://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/Menu_Analyse\nhttp://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk:_undelete_file_for_NTFS\nhttp://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec\n", "Q: I can't open DVDs in VLC whenever I suspend my system, why? I know there are a lot of similar questions out there, so I hope not to get the same answer I've already read a couple times.\nI know that DCD playback does not work with stock VLC; you have to install the restricted extras. so far so good, I did that and everything works fine. \nBut: I tend to suspend my computer, rather than fully shutting it down, because I don't like waiting that much. I also use a program to do timed suspends (qshutdown), so I can fall asleep watching a DVD and not have to worry about a running computer. \nYou maybe wondering why I'm telling this? here you are: almost every time, I wake my computer from suspend, I can't open DVDs in VLC (it works, if I open it without DVD menus, but then it crashes somewhere in the middle of the film). Is there a known solution to it?\n\nA: Okay, someone posted the answer on Google Plus.\nMicah Green (https://plus.google.com/u/0/102136182668884097283/posts) suggested that you install libdvdcss.\nTim Cummings (https://plus.google.com/u/0/104389497239909407158/posts) says that hibernating and suspending can cause odd behavior like this.\n", "Q: Why is the /etc/hosts file not working? I have been having problems with this for a while and have tried everything I know, so I figured it was finally time to ask for some help.\nAny edit I make to /etc/hosts just doesn't work.\nExample:\njulian@ifrit:~$ cat /etc/hosts\n127.0.0.1   localhost\n127.0.1.1   ifrit\n192.168.1.100   dev.julianfernand.es\n\nIn the example above, when I access dev.julianfernand.es (this doesn't exist), it should load from 192.168.1.100.\nIf I ping, it works just fine. However when I access dev.julianfernand.es using Google Chrome or Firefox, it doesn't.\nNow, after I restart a couple times, it works. But since I work at a managed WordPress hosting company, I deal with many situations where I have to edit my file to see the customer's website on our server.\nI just can't keep restarting my computer. It isn't productive at all. Restarting the networking service doesn't work, same for clearing cache (even internal Chrome DNS cache).\nDoes anyone have an idea here? This happens with elementaryOS (based on Ubuntu 12.04) and Ubuntu 13.10 (daily). Haven't tried with any other version yet.\nPS: if this matter, I have a NGINX server running on this machine with PHP-FPM and MySQL.\nThanks in advance :)\n\nA: For me the solution was to edit /etc/nsswitch.conf file (you may use command sudo vim /etc/nsswitch.conf). I've changed line:\nhosts:          files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns\n\nto:\nhosts:          dns files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return]\n\nand now it is working as expected!\n\nA: The following worked for me:\nadd \naddn-hosts=/etc/hosts\n\nin\n/etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/hosts.conf\n\nkill dnsmasq and \nservice NetworkManager restart\n\n\nA: The accepted answer works in 12.04 through 13.04 by disabling dnsmasq, but it stopped working for me in 13.10. I found the following new solution for 13.10.\nEdit your /etc/default/dnsmasq and change ENABLED=1 to ENABLED=0 and restart.\n\nA: From: http://blog.calebthorne.com/2012/08/broken-etchosts-in-ubuntu-1204.html\nA new \"feature\" in Ubuntu 12.04 desktop edition is to use dnsmasq as a plugin to NetworkManager for local DNS. Dnsmasq is intended to speed up DNS and DHCP services but comes with one unfortunate side effect: dnsmasq caches local DNS and ignores changes to /etc/hosts. I make frequent changes to the hosts file while working on websites so this \"feature\" was quite annoying.\nThe solution is to disable dnsmasq in the Networkmanager configuration file. Open /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf and comment out the line:\ndns=dnsmasq\n\nMy NetworkManager.conf file contains the following:\n[main]\nplugins=ifupdown,keyfile\n# dns=dnsmasq\n\n[ifupdown]\nmanaged=false\n\nSee also https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/network-manager/+bug/993298\n\nA: It's silly but the browser cache is the 'guilty' in my case = should be obvious for a developer :( \nAnother silly (obvious) thing what I missed, Browsers (Chrome, Mozilla) perform a google (or search engine) search directly from the address bar, so instead of resolving the address what you gave they search that word on the internet!  \nSolution:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Once the /etc/hosts file is edited ping the chosen address! \nIf the ping command resolves the IP what you have given the 'hosts' file works!\n\n*Clear your browser's cache (browsers cache DNS resolutions for some time (TTL)) \n\n*Disable the default search engine of the browser you are using  \n\nA: In Ubuntu if you want to flush DNS cache, you need to restart nscd daemon.\nInstall nscd using the following command:\nsudo apt-get install nscd\n\nFlush DNS Cache in Ubuntu Using the following command:\nsudo service nscd restart\n\nOR\nsudo service dns-clean start\n\nReference: http://www.upubuntu.com/2012/05/how-to-flush-clear-dns-cache-under.html\n\nA: Simple and Updated\n\n\n*\n\n*Create /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/hosts.conf.\n\n*Put lines like address=/whatever/1.2.3.4 in it.\nSee the docs\n(look for --address).\nWildcards are possible: address/.whatever./1.2.3.4.\n\n*Kill dnsmasq (bug).\n\n*Restart it: $ service network-manager restart.\n\n\nA: Edit /etc/nsswitch.conf, comment out below line by adding # in front of the line\nhosts:          files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns myhostname\n\nand add \nhosts:          files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns\n\nBasically, configuration is reordered. Now domain lookup process will consult file first which is /etc/hosts and then it will consult DNS. With default configuration it consults DNS first before any other appropriate services or files.\nFor quick test whether its working or not you can use \nsudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80\n\nto create a simple HTTP Server to serve files from directory and then comment below line in /etc/hosts file\n127.0.0.1      localhost\n127.0.1.1      01hw730983\n\nand add\n127.0.0.1       content\n\nthen go to a browser and type content/, if you able to see Directory structure its working else its not.\n\nA: It sounds like your setup is a lot like mine.  I have a box running Ubuntu as my office server and development host.  On that box, I run Nginx, Apache, Tomcat, Rails apps and whatever else I need.\nFrom my Mac, I can simply add a hosts entry and load the server with whatever name I need, but from a ElementaryOS client, that doesn't work.\nI tried the fixes above, with no success.\nWhat I did was to run Squid Proxy Server and add the hostnames to /etc/hosts on the server.  (Editing requires a restart of squid.)\nAfter that, make the appropriate proxy settings in your browser or OS's control panel.\n\nA: Check the permissions on /etc/hosts file.\nOn my cloud service after cloning a server the permissions on hosts file changed from 644 to 600 so the file could not be read by apache (www-data) I guess.  I ran sudo chmod 644 hosts from /etc and that fixed it. \nThe problem started out as:\nMongoConnectionException Failed to connect to: localhost:27017: Previous connection attempts failed, server blacklisted. \n\nI tracked it down to the server variable in MongoClient pointing at localhost. I was unable to ping localhost or the hostname.\n\nA: These days (2021) Firefox is using DNS over HTTPS which you have to disable for it to respect your hosts file. I think this has some privacy implications, so get informed before you do it.\nGo to Firefox settings, search DNS. Click settings next to Configure how firefox connects to the internet. At the bottom, uncheck Enable DNS over HTTPS\n", "Q: nvidia 319.32 doesn't work with optimus I have installed Ubuntu 12.04.3 (3.8.030) and I have a GT630M card and I installed nvidia 319.32 from Additional drivers and restarted.

It's finicky and overly-complex, and as a result even distribution maintainers have trouble getting it working reliably. You might want to check out my rEFInd instead. rEFInd is easier to configure than GRUB, and it's more reliable when it comes to booting Windows. It's also got prettier eye candy, if that's important to you.

Can anyone explain me with fairly simple words and not too technical concepts what exactly is GRUB, what is its primary usage and how to use it efficiently for a dual boot Windows/Ubuntu installation?\nI have already read a couple of resources but I am still confused.\n\nA: Grub is the Grand Unified Boot Loader. \nIf you come from Windows the easiest explanation for GRUB is \"This is the program that linux writes to your MBR (Master Boot Record)\" \nThis program is responsible for detecting and loading any OS on your personal computer.\nIn common cases You have simply to install Ubuntu after you put window on your machine. The Ubuntu installer will automatically detect your windows installation and write  the configuration file for you.\nSo When you turn on your PC GRUB comes up and shows you a menu to select if you like to boot either Windows or Ubuntu.\nThat's all. \n\nA: Basically, GRUB bootloader is the software that loads the Linux kernel. (It has other uses as well). It is the first software that starts at a system boot. \nWhen the computer starts, BIOS first run a Power-on self-test (POST) to check hardware like memory, disk drives and that it works properly. \nThen BIOS checks the Master Boot Record (MBR), which is a 512 byte section located first on the Hard Drive. It looks for a bootloader (like GRUB). The hard drive's partition tables are also located here. \n\nThen you'll be prompted by the GRUB menu which can contain a list of the operating systems installed (in the case of dual boot), or perhaps the different kernels installed in a Linux distro.\nWhen you choose which distro or kernel you want to use, GRUB loads the selected kernel. The kernel starts init (or systemd), which is the first process to start in Linux. init then starts other processes like network services and other that you might have configured to start at boot time.  \n\nThe boot process contains alot of defined expressions and terms, way to much to add in a simple answer like this. Google is your friend! \nRemember that this is a very basic explanation of the boot process and GRUB's role in it.\nThis youtube video provides a pretty nice introduction to the linux boot process, including basic information on the GRUB Bootloader:\nUnderstanding the Linux Boot Process - CompTIA Linux+, LPIC-1 \n\nA: GRUB is a multi boot boot-loader, is a programm who run at the system start and allow you to select what Operation system you want to start, like if you want ubuntu and windows on the same computer, with GRUB you can select those at system start\n", "Q: Ubuntu Apache2 won't start  * Starting web server apache2\napache2: Syntax error on line 214 of /etc/apache2/apache2.conf: Syntax error on line 3\nof /etc/apache2/httpd.conf: Expected </> but saw </Directory>\nAction 'start' failed.\nThe Apache error log may have more information.\n   ...fail!\n\n\nA: Reinstalling apache would be the most easy way to fix your problem. But you will also lose all your settings:\nsudo apt-get purge apache2\nsudo apt-get install apache2\n\nIf you want to fix the problem the elegant way, you will need to fix the error in you httpd.conf file by editing it and replacing </> by </Directory> on line 214 (like the error indicates quite clearly):\nsudo nano /etc/apache2/httpd.conf\n\nYou could also use any other editor (e.g. gedit or vim)\n\nA: You have a problem with the file /etc/apache2/httpd.conf, on terminal type :\nsudo gedit /etc/apache2/httpd.conf\n\non line 214 search a </> and change to </Directory> and save the file\nor\ntry to reinstall apache\non terminal type :\nsudo apt-get remove apache2\nsudo apt-get install apache2\n\nthis occured because a problem with syntax, problably you change anything of the file\n", "Q: Sed substitute through a sentence on multiple lines I am new to using sed but I have been experimenting sed's s/..../..../ (substitute) to modify a full sentence if it's on one line but I am unaware an alternative solution on how to modify a sentence that may have been separated on two lines such as:\nThis:\nLorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.\n\nis actually written as this:\nLorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the \nprinting and typesetting industry.\n\nHow can you detect for this or code it to replace the entire sentence even if it's on two lines instead of one?\n\nA: The following command will work in both situations:\nsed '/Lorem.*/ {N; s/Lorem.*industry\\./string to replace/g}' filename\n\nMore explanations: How can I use sed to replace a multi-line string?\n\nA: While sed can match patterns on multiple lines (using the commands N or H to append successive lines before matching), this is well outside its comfort zone. Attempt it only if you like pain.\nPerl can do this kind of things nicely. Use the -p switch to make it process standard input one record at a time and print the modified record (à la sed), and -000 to turn on paragraph mode (where records are separated by blank lines). In a regular expression, \\s matches any whitespace character including a newline.\nperl -p -000 -e 's/Lorem\\s+Ipsum\\s+is\\s+simply\\s+dummy\\s+text\\s+of\\s+the\\s+printing\\s+and\\s+typesetting\\s+industry\\./Replacement text/g'\n\nIf you want to put a newline in the replacement text when the original contains one, that's more complicated. How to do it depends on your requirements as to where to put the newline.\n\nA: sed cannot easily read across multiple lines.\nUse perl -i -0pe 's/.../.../...' instead. \n", "Q: How do I boot from USB? I installed Ubuntu 13.10 Saucy unto a USB stick using Pen Drive Linux's USB installer.  It won't boot.  Booting to a USB isn't in the BIOS boot order.  My desktop computer is essentially a brand new i7-3770.  Why won't it boot from USB?\nThanks.\nMark.\n\nA: not entirely correct - usb-stick needs a boot-flag too !\nYou can create boot-flag with gparted. plug-in usb-stick and open gparted.\nThen look for the drive there, which contains your usb-stick.\nSelect your usb-stick with one click.\nIn Menue goto 'partition' - and there 'edit mark' ---> set boot.\nSo the usb-stick has flag as 'boot' and can be recognized by BIOS.\n\nA: Some machines require you to set a supervisor password in the BIOS/UEFI settings before making available other boot options.  If you really dont have a choice which boots the USB, try setting the supervisor password, and see if more choices, including a USB choice, are offered.\n\nA: you should be wrong about USB-drive isn't listed in the boot order. Maybe you can choose a boot device not by changing the boot order in BIOS but by changing boot device temporarily (F9, F11, ... depends on hardware). If all this fails you'll have to install a grub (or any other compatible Boot Loader onto a bootable hard drive, which recognizes your USB-Stick as a bootable media and will create an entry for the Ubuntu on the USB.\n\nA: Maybe the USB boot is under the harddisk; so connect the USB before entering BIOS, then check if there is a harddisk boot priority. If so the USB name and model will be listed.\n\nA: If your on windows check out LinuxLiveUSB maker!

If so, how do you deal with ubuntu point releases (that include packages from -updates)?\nThis is way specific, and I didn't find anything about it in my searches. Please point me out to any previous question or maybe to a more appropriate forum you know for this.\nNot so short:\nIt seems to me that the whole point in having -updates as a separate release is opting to not using it, and having just the security-related updates installed. That's what we try to do in our company.\nOf course, you might need some package from -updates, and we do. So we leave the -updates  on sources.list, but pin it to -10 (\"don't use at all\" priority). Specific packages we need from -updates are then pinned with a higher priority so they get selected. We have that setup automated already. It works well ... most of the time. \nProblem arises if someone uses an image/CD of an ubuntu's point release (say 12.04.2, for example) to install a new machine. Point releases do include the -updates packages up to that time. When I try to install some new package (after disabling/pinning -updates) and that package depends on one of those -updates packages that came with the point release, I might get a broken package. Like in this case:\n# apt-get install vim-nox -s\nReading package lists... Done\nBuilding dependency tree       \nReading state information... Done\nSome packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have\nrequested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable\ndistribution that some required packages have not yet been created\nor been moved out of Incoming.\nThe following information may help to resolve the situation:\n\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n vim-nox : Depends: vim-common (= 2:7.3.429-2ubuntu2) but 2:7.3.429-2ubuntu2.1 is to be installed\n           Depends: vim-runtime (= 2:7.3.429-2ubuntu2) but 2:7.3.429-2ubuntu2.1 is to be installed\nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\n\nIt's trying to install vim-nox from \"precise\", but vim-common and vim-runtime from precise-updates are already installed (by the base install, before I can change anything), and so it breaks.\nFiddling with the apt_preference priorities didn't help me. AFAICT dependencies don't affect apt's priority/selection algorithm, so it won't do the job.\nOf course I can just ban the use of point release images, but that's kind of unfortunate. In a world of increasingly prebuilt images for every kind of virtualization platform, if I want to take advantage of them (even if only for testing), I have to search for old, sometimes deprecated (or non-existant) images made before the first point release.\nDoes anybody here has been through this?\n\nA: In short:\nOnly comment out the -updates entries in your sources.list. Or pin down them.\nNot too short:\nSeems that you want to mess up a bit with your pinning preferences. If you want to you could set that if you need to install a package from a no -updates repository, you could set the main repository to >1000 pin priority. This will tell apt-get to downgrade if necessary the packages to get them from this version:\n\nNote that a priority above 1000 will allow even downgrades no matter the version of the prioritary package. This means that you can use priority 1001 for a stable source if you want to downgrade to the stable versions of the packages you have installed (let's say from testing) on the system.\n\nAs example lets see my own apt-pinning preferences:\ncat /etc/apt/preferences.d/pinning\nPackage: iceweasel*\nPin: release a=experimental\nPin-Priority: 1990\n\napt-cache policy iceweasel\niceweasel:\n  Installed: 25.0~a2+20130830004004-1~bpo70+1\n  Candidate: 25.0~a2+20130906004001-1\n  Package pin: 25.0~a2+20130906004001-1\n  Version table:\n     25.0~a2+20130906004001-1 1990\n        500 http://mozilla.debian.net/ experimental/iceweasel-aurora i386 Packages\n *** 25.0~a2+20130830004004-1~bpo70+1 1990\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n     17.0.8esr-2 1990\n        500 http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ testing/main i386 Packages\n\nAs you can see, apt will prefer that the package iceweasel comes from the experimental branch instead of the testing and if it's necessary it will downgrade the package to comply with this preference.\n\nA: Try clearing vim and and starting over - worked for me\nsudo apt-get remove vim-common\nsudo apt-get clean && sudo apt-get purge\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install vim \n\n", "Q: What Music programs will sync my MP3 player, Sony walkman S?

You could try with Midnight commander.\nInstall it with:\nsudo apt-get install mc\n\n\nA: There are two commands to allow you to easily move back and forth between directories:\npushd\npopd\n\nFor an example, navigate to the first directory with cd:\ncd /home/aperson/more/path/to/a/very/long/and/annoying/to/type/\nThen use pushd to move to the other directory:\npushd  /home/aperson/more/path/to/a/different/very/long/and/annoying/to/type/\nNow when you call popd again you will be back in the first directory.\nThis just helps with the navigation though, you will still need to do your mv or cp separately.\nDepending on how much you need to do it may be worth assigning your paths to variables so you don't have to type the full path out:\nDIR1=\"/home/aperson/a/very/long/and/annoying/to/type/\"\nDIR2=\"/home/aperson/a/different/very/long/and/annoying/to/type/\"\n\nNow you can use $DIR1 and $DIR2 to refer to the directories i.e.\ncp somestuff.stuff $DIR1\ncd $DIR1\nmv somestuff.stuff $DIR2\ncd $DIR2\n\n\nA: This is not exactly navigation, but I am guessing what you're looking for is TAB AUTO COMPLETION.\nThis will allow you to get the full part of any directory without having to know it.\nHere's a great tutorial for this.\n\nA: I don't understand why nobody mentioned two easy ways to achieve what op asks.\nFirst way: \ncd -  #goes back to previous directory\n\nSecond way:\ncd $OLDPWD\n\nFor more info check out following link https://superuser.com/questions/113219/go-back-to-previous-directory-in-shell\nEDIT: I found really a nice .bashrc function in following link by Adam Katz which is a must for easy navigation in bash shell: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/31161/quick-directory-navigation-in-the-terminal\nI tried it, it works well. \n\nA: You could use the tab feature that comes with ubuntu's terminal (ctrl + shift + t).\nThis way you could search for your destination directory in the second tab using the cd and ls commands. then once in the desired directory you could use the pwd command (print working directory) to get the full path to said directory. Once you have that, copy and paste the path over to your first terminal tab where you are executing your cp or mv command.\n\nIf you are not familiar with cd and ls, here is a great little tutorial for some of the basic bash commands.\nThe Command Line Crash Course\nI hope this is of some use to you.\n\nA: Another option, that's more akin to the GUI 'cut and paste' idea.\ncd /long/path/to/wherever/the/file/is/now\nmv file_to_move /tmp/\ncd /destination/directory/somewhere/else/\nmv /tmp/file_to_move ./\n\nBut really, it involves much more typing than a simple single  cp <source> <destination>\n\nA: Autojump with Tab completions\nThis doesn't exactly answer your question, BUT if you've been to that particular folder before, you can simply use the autojump command/program to allow you to quickly jump between folders.\nj Pictures and i'm in the pictures folder\nj AnotherFolder and then instantly, I am transported to that folder.\nBest part of about autojump is that it respects tab completions, and cycles through folders with the similar names.\n", "Q: ./configure Permission Denied when try to build llvm I'm try to build to build Clang and LLVM and after download it I want to configure it so when I do that command :\n../llvm/configure --prefix=/usr/clang_3_3 --enable-optimized --enable-targets=host\n\nit's show me error configure permission Denied even when I'm root and I try\nchmod +x\n\nit didn't work any help\nNote :\nI download Clang and LLVM from svn and I put it to anthor dir(not the root) in /media one of these dirs \n\nA: You need to put it on a Linux file system.

I can only choose between replacing Windows or managing partitions myself.\nSome people on the Ubuntu forums and Ask Ubuntu (on existing threads & questions) say that this may be caused because Windows is taking up all partitions and I need to manage all those partitions myself. However, I'm not really happy to manage partitions myself, since I have GRUB on my PC, and deleting it would be a serious problem.\nActually, before this install with only two options, I tried another install, however, during that time there were three options and one of them was to replace Ubuntu with the about-to-install one. However, I decided to quit during installation at the point where the three options showed up, but pressing the Quit button just doesn't work and my cursor was a spinning wheel (which tells me to wait). I got impatient after one or two minutes and powered off my PC by pressing the power button directly.\nAfter that, no option of replacing Ubuntu showed up during this second install.

The files with ~ at the end are sometimes created by text editors and other programs which edit things.  The system does not automatically remove them, and some programs don't autoremove them.  Some programs will remove the files, but others won't.  The files are still there because nothing removed them.\nYou can remove those pretty easily, however this command here to do so has not been tested thoroughly by myself so be careful with using this:\ncd ~/Desktop\nrm *.cpp\\~ *.c\\~ Untitled*\n\nI am uncertain whether those are being automatically hidden in the desktop, however that is what I believe is happening based on what you've said.\n", "Q: Getting rid of Xauthority files I have my ~/ directory that is being flooded by \".Xauthority.43652W\" files with \"43652W\" being any combination of letter and digits...\nI only have 40 of these files for the moment, but it's ever growing and I don't want to pollute my ~/ too much.\nAny idea what should I do ?\n\nA: For those -- like me -- wishing to get rid of this \"pollution\" in the user directory (apparently caused by a lightdm bug described in Why do I have so many .Xauthority.* files in my home directory?), an interim solution could be placing something like the following (executable) script file (which assumes you are the first user after root) into the /etc/cron.daily directory:\n#!/bin/bash\nUSER=\"$(users | awk -F ' ' '{print $2}')\"\nls /home/\"$USER\"/.Xauthority.* > /home/\"$USER\"/.Xauthority-Files.txt\nNFILES=\"$(grep -c Xauthority /home/\"$USER\"/.Xauthority-Files.txt)\"\nLOG=\"/home/\"$USER\"/.Xauthority-Files.log\"\necho -e \"$(date +\"%x %R\"): \"$NFILES\" .Xauthority.* files deleted\" >> \"$LOG\"\nrm -f /home/\"$USER\"/.Xauthority.*\nrm -f /home/\"$USER\"/.Xauthority-Files.txt\nexit 0\n\nNOTE: This updated script keeps a log file named \".Xauthority-Files.log\" so that you can follow up if a recent update has put an end to this bug, and then remove the script when it's no longer needed.\n", "Q: What creates /run/lock?

(I know I can use wine as well!!!).\nGNS3 is good but it is not free I think. \nSo are there any other network simulators that I can use on my Ubuntu system.\nPS Can anyone please also clarify as when I used packet tracer the routers etc were of Cisco definitely but are there any network simulatotors where one can simulate network on other manufacturers hardware as well?\n\nA: Actually GNS3 is an open source software. Also Dynamips (the core of GNS3) is open source. The problem with them is that you need to have original IOS images to emulate routers (or IPS or firewalls). You can also emulate JunOs.\nGNS3 gives also the possibility to add virtual machines (from VirtualBox or Qemu) to the topology. You can still play a bit with GNS3 emulating open source network appliances such as: OpenWRT(https://openwrt.org/), Vyatta core (http://www.vyatta.org/node/6757), Openvswitch(http://openvswitch.org/), pfSense (http://www.pfsense.org/). Just pay attention to the resources needed to emulate a complex network.\nAnother good software to emulate networks is ns (http://www.nsnam.org/).\nSource: Network Simulator for Ubuntu 12.04\n", "Q: Is it 100% safe to rename a file while it's being written? In Ubuntu, unlike in Windows, I can rename a file while it's being written onto the hard disk (for example because it's the output of a program or the copy of another file), and I can also rename a directory containing files that are being written: the system doesn't send messages like \"The file is being used, operation not allowed\". Is this renaming operation 100% safe, or there's a risk of creating corrupted files? And, in the first case, what is the technical reason that makes it possible, differently from other operating systems? (maybe something related with Linux file system structure and the use of Inodes, I think...?)\nThank you very much.\n\nA: Linux works on file handles and renaming or moving a file in Linux does not alter the file handle. Even deleting a file will not be a problem: the process that owns the file handle can still read and write.\nThe Wikipedia page on inodes will be the best read on this.\n\nIn computing, an inode (index node) is a data structure found in many Unix file systems. Each inode stores all the information about a file system object (file, device node, socket, pipe, etc.). It does not store the file's data content and file name except for certain cases in modern file systems.\nImplications\nA file's inode number stays the same when it is moved to another directory on the same device, or when the disk is defragmented which may change its physical location. This also implies that completely conforming inode behavior is impossible to implement with many non-Unix file systems, such as FAT and its descendants, which don't have a way of storing this invariance when both a file's directory entry and its data are moved around.\n\n\nSo: yes.\n", "Q: Boot off of Ubuntu 12.04 using old kernel Here's the thing, I was resizing my partition and gparted crashed (I was running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Windows XP SP3 dual boot), so now my computer won't boot.

I know that my computer can run 12.04 because it worked before.\nThanks a lot, DeveloperNewb\nEdit: Is it possible to deceive boot-repair into thinking I have ubuntu 12.04 so I can run it in 11.10?\n\nA: According to this answer, 32-bit Xubuntu 12.04 doesn't expect PAE by default. You should be able to create a bootable USB and load boot-repair/install from that.\n", "Q: curl: (5) Couldn't resolve proxy 'hproxy.iitm.ac.in' I have been using the proxy hproxy.iitm.ac.in.

When you have issues partitioning you hard drive from within Windows, try the GParted Live CD. Simply boot from the CD and create partitions as you like. \nWith this, it is also possible to shrink your existing Windows partition, even if that is not possible from within Windows. In the newly created free space, you can set up a partition for Ubuntu. BTW, you should probably also create another partition for your data (documents, music, movies, ...) which can be used from both Windows and Ubuntu, and which is safe in case one of your system partitions needs to be formatted for, say, a reinstallation. (Windows needs a reinstall from time to time to be happy...)\nThe Ubuntu installer will take care of setting up a dual-boot configuration during installation, so you can choose which OS to start at boot time.\n\nA: There are a few things you might want to understand before installing Ubuntu. First, Windows 7 uses NTFS, where as Ubuntu uses ext4 as default for their file system. What this means is that, although Ubuntu can see and access Win7's file system, the reverse might NOT be true.. Thus, if you are thinking of sharing files between the two OSes, just save it in a NTFS drive used by your windows to be able to access it via both Windows and Ubuntu. \nMore importantly, this brings me to my second point. Their is no practical advantage of installing both OS on the same hard drive. Further, if you wanna choose to use the Windows Boot-Loader: Winload (The black screen during starting your computer that lets you choose between OSes) instead of Grub2 (default boot-loader for Ubuntu), it is highly recommended that you choose another drive, as separate boot loaders on separate systems will ensure that they do not overwrite one another in the master boot record(MBR).\nI can give you tons of more reasons why installing two different OSes on the same partition is a bad idea. I would hence recommend installing Ubuntu on another drive.\nNow, if you are having problems partitioning the drive, please note that windows 7 does not allow more than 4 drives. Thus, if you are already using 4 different partitions, I'd suggest that you should merge any two of them together and create a separate drive for Ubuntu (or clear up a drive completely, and replace its usage for Ubuntu). \nLast but not the least, here's a few links to help you with disk management in win7:\n(1) http://www.support.com/blog/post/resize-your-hard-drive-partition-without-losing-data?geo=IN\n(2) http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/resize-a-partition-for-free-in-windows-vista/\n", "Q: Install package from ppa with setup.py file I am writing a python program that I want to upload to a ppa so other people can install it on their machine.

Or do I need a make, controll, install file like debian for this to work?\nRight now if I wanna install, I type 'sudo python3 setup.py install'.\n\nA: You need to \"package\" your Python program into the Debian packaging format.\nPackaging for Debian is pretty complex, but here are some pointers to get you started:\nHow to package a Python application:\nhttps://wiki.debian.org/Python/Packaging\nThe Debian new package  maintainer's guide (best starting point to grasp all the concepts):\nhttps://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/index.en.html\nFinally the big reference, the Debian policy manual:\nhttps://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-scope.html\n", "Q: How to download a specific version of Duplicity How do I install a specific version of duplicity.

This does not always work for any download: it is possible that a package depends in something else that is not installed. The 2nd link above (this one) shows what packages it depends on. \n\nA: Another method would be using the = operand in apt-get/aptitude:\nsudo apt-get install duplicity=0.6.21-0ubuntu13\n\nsudo aptitude install duplicity=0.6.21-0ubuntu13\n\n", "Q: Unable to open Ubuntu software center, Synaptic manager or install updates I cannot open Ubuntu Software Center, Synaptic Package Manager or install any updates.\nBelow is what I get;\nAn error occurred, please run Package Manager from the right -click \nmenu or apt get in a terminal to see what wrong.

I'm looking for a PPA to easily install packages like Skype, Google Chrome and other commonly used non-free software.

I couldn't find a satisfactory answer to this on the forum. Could someone please help.\nThanks\n\nA: It looks like you have a non-standard version of the GNU linker ld in your  /usr/local/bin directory (possibly installed from source), and your PATH environment variable is set such that the system finds that version before the 'system' version (which should be at /usr/bin/ld). If you want to build using the standard system versions of the build tools, you will need to adjust your PATH environment variable so that it searches /usr/bin ahead of /usr/local/bin \nIf you want to permanently fix your PATH variable, you will need to find out where you set it originally - probably in your ~/.bashrc file, but other locations are possible. Alternatively, if you just need a temporary fix for this build, you could try\nexport PATH=\"/usr/bin:$PATH\"\n\nin the terminal before executing the ./configure\nHowever there are sometimes good reasons why you (or your system admin) may want you to use versions of tools from /usr/local - if so, then you will need to find out why the ld there is apparently not compatible with the rest of the build chain and fix it - if this is a work or school system then contact your system administrator or IT department.\n\nA: Contrary to the complicated reasons given above, in my case, it was simply a case of not having g++ installed. Oddly, the error message was the same as described by the OP i.e\nconfigure: error: C compiler cannot create executables\n\nAnyways, I resolved this by installing g++:\nsudo apt-get install g++\n\n\nA: Try to update system, reinstall the packages providing ld and the compiler (gcc).

Then reboot.\nYou may need to disable or reconfigure prelink in /etc/systemctl or wherever your distros sets this up.\n", "Q: Map CapsLock key to Return I want to remap my CapsLock key to work as if it was a Return key.

I installed 12.04 LTS. Windows 8 (in my experience) is usually run on 64-bit machines, so you'll likely need the 64-bit version of 12.04. \nNext, put the live disc in your optical drive. Despite what you may expect, you will not be able to successfully boot off of the Live disc because of the firmware called Secure Boot. This is in place to prevent someone from accessing the admin account for Windows 8 and stealing your information. The next step is to get around this firmware.\nNext, go into the general settings found under the 'change PC settings' menu. Scroll to the bottom and click the 'Advanced Start-Up' section and click the button that says 'Restart Now'. You will see a waiting screen, and then several options to click on. Click on 'Troubleshooting'. Then click on 'Advanced Options'. Then click  'UEFI Firmware Settings'. Then click on the restart button shown on your screen. This restarts your computer and gives you access to your BIOS.\nUse your tab key to get to a tab that says something like 'App Menu'. Then arrow to the option that says Setup and hit enter. You'll then see a blue screen that has several tabs at the top. Go to the 'Security' tab and there will be an option for 'Secure Boot' that should be greyed out. If it's not, then arrow down to it and hit enter, then select 'Disabled'. Otherwise, go through the tabs and look for an option that has the abbreviation 'UEFI' next to it. Change this option to 'Legacy Support'. You should then see an option in the same menu that says 'Boot Priority'. Change this from 'UEFI first' to 'Legacy first'. Then hit the function key that saves and exits the BIOS. \nYou should now be able to boot from the live disc and install Ubuntu. Enjoy!\n\nA: According to this page: http://noelkurian.tk/2013/03/dual-booting-windows-7-and-archlinux-on-lenovo-ideapad-u410/, this can be used as for Ubuntu as for other distros to install. Did you follow a similar aproach to install Ubuntu or you just did it in a different way?\n\nA: I actually tried something similar to this, but couldn't get it to work. The main problem that I ran into was that I couldn't get Secure Boot to allow me access to this partition. For some reason, I found that this problem only arises when using windows 8 machines with the UEFI firmware options. I originally booted off a live disc by accessing the BIOS and changing the boot priority so that the live disc would boot first. I then installed 12.04, but when I restarted my machine, Secure Boot prevented 12.04 from starting up. To be honest, I only figured this problem out by trial and error. Since I didn't install Archlinux, I'm not sure if this procedure would actually work, but I suppose it could. \nOne problem I've had so far is that I can no longer access Windows 8. I tryed selecting that OS from the boot menu, but whenever I do, I get an error message that says 'No valid BIOS detected' or something like this. Any ideas?\nMichael\n\nA: I have a HP dv6 series lappy with 3rd gen i7.\nWhat i did was: I booted from USB. Then installed in specific drive. Then to my surprise, i didn't get the GRUB loader.

Every file has a set of permissions attached to it that allow it to be read, written to or executed by users.\nSome users can do all three things - read, write and execute. But some can't.\nThe 0555 indicates that the file you are moving has not got the full set of permissions set for any user. If they were all set so that everyone could do everything, the numbers would be 0777.\nHow do those numbers work? They represent three bits that can be set for you, 'the group' and everyone else to access the file. In binary arithmetic the first bit set is 1, the next is 2 and the next is 4. So if the file is readable, writable and executable to all it would be 1+2+4 = 7.\nYou are getting 0555, so you have 1+0+4. So your second bit isn't set for you or group or anyone. Therefore no one has permission to write (or move) that file.\nOpen a terminal and type 'chmod 755 foo.jpg' and try again. That should give you full persmission on the file if you own it. If it doesn't work, type \nchown yourname foo.jpg\n\nYou should do some reading about file permissions for UNIX/LINUX type systems. It is what makes it more secure from viruses and malware etc.\n", "Q: avprobe - doesn't output json document I'm trying to create a json file with information of a mp4 file with avprobe, but it doesn't print nothing.\nThe command\navprobe -v 0 -show_format -of json myvideo.mp4\n\nMy avprobe version\navprobe version 0.8.6-6:0.8.6-1ubuntu2, Copyright (c) 2007-2013 the Libav developers\n  built on Mar 30 2013 22:20:06 with gcc 4.7.2\navprobe 0.8.6-6:0.8.6-1ubuntu2\nlibavutil    51. 22. 1 / 51. 22. 1\nlibavcodec   53. 35. 0 / 53. 35. 0\nlibavformat  53. 21. 1 / 53. 21. 1\nlibavdevice  53.  2. 0 / 53.  2. 0\nlibavfilter   2. 15. 0 /  2. 15. 0\nlibswscale    2.  1. 0 /  2.  1. 0\nlibpostproc  52.  0. 0 / 52.  0. 0\n\nThis\navprobe -v 0 -show_format -show_streams myvideo.mp4\n\nshows me some the video information in a ini format.\n\nA: The following works for me :\navprobe -v 0 -show_format -show_streams myvideo.mp4 -of json\nI'm using libav-tools version 6:11.2-1~ppa1 on Ubuntu.\nHope this helps.\nSebastien.\n", "Q: What is the /media/myname/SSH2013-09-16 directory for? I noticed today that there is a directory located in /media/myusername called \"SSH2013-09-16\".  I tried to remove it, but rmdir reports \"Device or resource busy\".

Does anyone know what this directory is for, if it should be there, and if not, how I can remove it?\nThanks!\nNote: I am running Ubuntu 12.10 64bit Desktop\n\nA: Solved It!  Although my cd drive was empty, /dev/sr0 was still mounted to that location.  By going to the file manager and clicking the eject button, it unmounted it.  It seems to me like an Ubuntu bug since there was nothing in my cd tray (and there hasn't been for two days now).  Using the \"mount\" (as root without arguments) command was helpful to me since it listed all the current mounts.\n\nA: Always that a device is automagically mounted, the system uses this kind of path to do this. When a device is removed without properly unmounted, this can be happen.\n\nA: I would say you mounted an ssh folder ans it's still used.\nyou should try unmounting it first\n", "Q: How can we get the command line of a running application?

Any idea?\n\nA: I am going to leave the original answer below because it may be important for others that search for this question.\nIn short there doesn't seem to be a one size fits all answer, but with 'set clipboard=unnamedplus'  one of either '*p' or '+p' should work from the \"system\" clipboard. \n'*p' is almost certainly the one you want. (from here)\n\nvim is a cli program. When using it inside gnome-terminal (or any terminal emulator) crtl+c (or any key combination) is handled by the terminal emulator first, then the shell, then finally by the program (vim in this case). vim and ctrl+c will almost certainly never work because ctrl+c sends an SIGINT signal to the running task. vim uses SIGINT to stop other things like aborting insert mode, or stopping search functions. \nIn other words. Ctrl+C is never actually passed to VIM. SIGINT is passed to VIM. SIGINT has other uses in vim so using to copy is likely not going to work (and even if can you force it, not a good idea). \nInstead try sticking with Ctrl+Shift+C and Ctrl+Shift+V (there are others but I believe those put text in the system clipboard)\nTo be fair I don't know much about gvim.\n\nA: Use in your vimrc:\nset mouse=a\n\nIt will allow you to select and copy manually with mouse.\n\nA: In addition to the accepted answer, if you are working remotely over SSH (e.g. over tmux with multiple panes with different vim processes you want to copy between), you also need to export your X display since vim is using xterm-clipboard to interface between different processes. You can set the X display by running\nexport DISPLAY=:0.0\n\nThis must be run before vim is launched, and under any other shell you have.\n\nA: I have found on Ubuntu 16.04 I need vim-gui-common installed in order for \"+y to work.\n\nA: This is what works for me (Ubuntu 13.10):\nReinstall vim as vim-gtk:\nsudo apt-get install vim-gtk\n\nselect what you want using the mouse - then type to copy to clipboard:\n\"+y\n\nto paste to vim from clipboard type:\n\"+p\n\nI don't know why but comparing the output of vim --version shows that the usual vim installation is quite restricted compared to vim-gtk.

I have googled around and found all the usual solutions. None of them work for me. First of all, I want to make high quality recordings. Second, I use JACK audio (PulseAudio is completely uninstalled.) \nMy OS and hardware details are at the end. But I think JACK audio is the main challenge when it comes to screencasting. JACK is my only option because this computer's purpose is audio production.\nMy next challenge seems to be Ubuntu itself... ffmpeg and Ubuntu aren't so friendly. I don't really feel like compiling my own ffmpeg, for example. And even if I do (which is an option of last resort), I want to be able to record specific program windows easily, even if they move around on the screen. Command line ffmpeg seems to be limited to recording predefined screen regions and it lacks flexibility, easy of use, and simplicity.\nI seek a GUI approach to recording my desktop with audio using JACK. And I want high quality audio and video that are sync'd. I think a significant number of Linux users are interested in a solution like this. \nThe developer of SimpleScreenRecorder (SSR) said he intends to add JACK support, so SSR is at the top of my list of potential solutions. \nMain page - SimpleScreenRecorder - Maarten Baert's website\n(Unfortunately, the repo version of SSR crashes and I can't try the current/latest git version because I can't get the git version to build on Ubuntu, but I'll open a separate question for that.)\nUntil SSR comes along with JACK audio support (if it does), I hope someone else has a solution that works now.\nBTW, I do have the jack2alsa bridge.

There were already a few programs that could do this, but I wasn't 100% happy with any of them, so I created my own.\nMy original goal was to create a program that was just really simple to use, but as I was writing it I started adding more and more features, and the result is actually a pretty powerful program. It's 'simple' in the sense that it's easier to use than ffmpeg/avconv or VLC, because it has a straightforward user interface.\nFeatures\n\n\n*\n\n*Graphical user interface (Qt-based).\n\n*Faster than VLC and ffmpeg/avconv.\n\n*Records the entire screen or part of it, or records OpenGL applications directly (similar to Fraps on Windows).\n\n*Synchronizes audio and video properly (a common issue with VLC and ffmpeg/avconv).\n\n*Reduces the video frame rate if your computer is too slow (rather than using up all your RAM like VLC does).\n\n*Fully multithreaded: small delays in any of the components will never block the other components, resulting is smoother video and better performance on computers with multiple processors.\n\n*Pause and resume recording at any time (either by clicking a button or by pressing a hotkey).\n\n*Shows statistics during recording (file size, bit rate, total recording time, actual frame rate, ...).\n\n*Can show a preview during recording, so you don't waste time recording something only to figure out afterwards that some setting was wrong.\n\n*Uses libav/ffmpeg libraries for encoding, so it supports many different codecs and file formats (adding more is trivial).\n\n*Can also do live streaming (experimental).\n\n*Sensible default settings: no need to change anything if you don't want to.\n\n*Tooltips for almost everything: no need to read the documentation to find out what something does.\n\nA: Check out\n\n\n*\n\n*Gnome Shell Recorder (built in!). You can start/stop with Ctrl + Alt + Shift + R. It has this bug, on some distros can't record audio. When recording you will see the red dot on the upper bar and after something like Screencast from 11-20-2019 09:03:28 PM.webm on ~/Videos.\n\n*Open Broadcaster Software (OBS)\nSeems a duplicate of this one.\n", "Q: lenovo z470 keyboard gets stuck I installed ubuntu 13.04 64bit on my lenovo idea pad z470.

In fact when you use only dmesg | grep idVendor the output will be arranged in more lines, but when you do dmesgDevs=$(dmesg | grep idVendor), all the lines will be merged in a single string. \nNow, to print dmesgDevs line by line, you can set the internal field separator (IFS) variable, and then let it parse into an array. Something like this it will parse each time one line of input separated by [:\nwhile IFS='[' read ADDR; do for i in \"${ADDR[@]}\"; do echo $i; done; done <<< \"$dmesgDevs\"\n\nFinally, to check if theres is word in particular line, just pipe the output of previous command to grep:\nwhile IFS='[' read ADDR; do for i in \"${ADDR[@]}\"; do echo $i; done; done <<< \"$dmesgDevs\" | grep 'word'\n\n\nIn this case I was able to find a solution because each line start with the same pattern ([), but this doesn't happen all the time. So, as alternative instead to keep the output of dmesg | grep idVendor command in a variable, keep it in a file; for example in /tmp/dmesgDevs. You can do this using:\ndmesg | grep idVendor > /tmp/dmesgDevs\n\nThen, everything is very simple:\ncat /tmp/dmesgDevs\ngrep 'word' /tmp/dmesgDevs\n\n", "Q: How To Install D-Link DWM-156 3G Modem Ubuntu 13.04 I bought a new D-Link 3G modem and it said it supports Linux.

It came with Windows 8 and UEFI. I was able to do dual boot with Ubuntu 13.04 using USB installation. I had some issues with the boot, so I ran boot-repair and everything worked fine. However, I want to reinstall my Ubuntu since I have some problems with the graphical drivers. Then I looked at the boot options and I don't have the USB boot entry anymore. I tried to create a new boot entry using efibootmgr, but that didn't work, it looks like efibootmgr is not able to add entries in Ubuntu 13.04.

This was working before installing Ubuntu. I was able to use USB stick to install Ubuntu. This is happening with other people as well. Please look at the problem more further before put on hold\n\nA: You don't have a BIOS, so you're technically correct that it's not a BIOS issue; but it is a firmware (EFI, in your case) issue, not a Linux issue. That said, your installation of Linux has probably disrupted the list of boot options that the EFI maintains in NVRAM. It's possible that you'll be able to restore the USB option by fiddling with your firmware's settings, but it's impossible for me to say what you might need to adjust because EFIs vary so much in the options they present and how you use them. Note also that it may be necessary to have a bootable USB flash drive inserted into the computer when you enter the firmware setup utility for it to do the right thing. Note also that the option in question might be something related to USB initialization or a \"fast boot\" setting. (Some computers do limited or no initialization of USB at boot time in order to shave an extra couple seconds off the boot time.)\nIf you can't find any suitable options, you might try installing my rEFInd boot manager. It scans all the boot devices it can find, so if the computer initializes the USB devices, rEFInd should detect a bootable USB device. (Note that by default, rEFInd will detect only EFI-bootable devices, though; if you want rEFInd to detect a BIOS-mode boot disk, you must uncomment and adjust the scanfor line in refind.conf.) If you install the rEFInd Debian package, be aware that it will take over as the default/primary boot loader.\n", "Q: What are CVE security updates and who issues them?

So what was in that? I am surprised you get a grub rescue as the MBR should have also been overwritten with syslinux and partition table converted to one entry for the FAT32 installer version.\nYou may be able to use testdisk to restore old partitions.  If your dual booted Windows it has 100MB boot partition which will be gone and the first 600MB of Windows, so it will not boot. If Ubuntu was further into drive you may be able to recover it.\nFor what testdisk cannot recover with deeper search you can use photorec to scan drive for anything that looks like a file. It does not find file names, just extensions or file type. It is slow and you need lots of room for restored files as it will also find deleted files and some partial files.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/DataRecovery\nhttp://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk\nhttp://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Step_By_Step\nhttp://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/Menu_Analyse\nhttp://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk:_undelete_file_for_NTFS\nhttp://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec\n\nA: You wrote the data to sda8, which is a partition on your hard drive. A partition is also known as \"Disk Drive\", such as C:, D:, E:, etc. in windows.\nThe one you overwrote probably contained GRUB, the software that handles booting into Ubuntu (and Windows as well if you're dual booting).\nGRUB resides on \"/\" or \"/boot\", depending on whether you made /boot or not when you installed Ubuntu.\nYou can make a live disk from another computer, use that on your computer to see if your data is still intact or not.\nIf you do not have a separate /home partition, you should back up your data using the live disk and an external hard drive before you install Ubuntu again.\nChances are, your system will be fine again if you install Ubuntu again and if you do not format /home and Windows partitions when you install Ubuntu. If you don't have a separate /home partition, then I would recommend that you make one this time, to keep your personal data safe from future formats.\n", "Q: Nonblocking bash commands?

The board I have is the ASUS M4A79XTD Evo (AM3). Any help will be much appreciated, thanks\n\nA: I would first double check whether your boot loader really starts reading from USB device. Then try the USB on other computer (with correct boot priority of course). \nIt also might be that the USB has not been correctly written.\nIf the USB is able to boot your other PC, so perhaps 12.04 misses some of your goal PC drviers. In this case using a 13.04 image can resolve the problem. \n\nA: What i would do, is format the USB as FAT32, then use the Linux USB installer again. please reply if it worked. If that doesn't work perhaps try a Live CD? \n\nA: Had the same problem for booting off a live disc on a toshiba laptop with a preloaded Windows 8 OS. Since you know how to enter your bios to change your boot order I would recommend checking a few other important settings first.\n\n\n*\n\n*Have you disabled 'Fast Startup' in Windows. (admin rights)\nEnter 'Control Panel'. Click/Search 'Power Options'. On the left side panel click\n'Choose what the power buttons do'.

See this page, and in particular the section entitled \"The EFI Boot Process,\" for details. To fix your problem you must either create new NVRAM entries by using an emergency disc and efibootmgr (or a similar tool in another OS or environment) or install a boot loader as EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi (assuming an x86-64 CPU and 64-bit EFI).\n", "Q: I've got some problems on Ubuntu 13.04, any help! \n*\n\n*I can't set script (or by any other way through terminal) for making thresholds for battery charging, Also I know that Lenovo users provided tp_smapi kernel module which make this issue not considered as an unsolvable problem unless for Dell users, Also i tried this http://www.serkey.com/ubuntu-thinkpad-battery-threshold-tool-easy-script-bebzu4.html but it is not working for me, any solutions for controlling thresholds charging by any way?\n\n*I think my laptop temperature getting high with no reason which makes it produces extra heat even if the laptop is in its idle state, considering also my trying to use Jupiter but it have not effect on the heat also in its power saving plan, so is there a way to make power plan to save the battery power?\n\nA: Try the TLP power management application. Lower power consumption should reduce heat. I've been using it on my Acer Aspire laptop and it has drastically lengthened life of the battery.

How do I download drivers for Broadcom 4311 802.11 from another PC and install them on 13.04?\n\nA: You can either download the source .tar.gz from the Broadcom website or the in my opinion much better way is to download the .deb with:\napt-get download broadcom-sta-common\n\nIt is then in the directory from where you called it and you can copy it onto the flash drive.\nIf you have no other linux available use packages.ubuntu.com to download the .deb.\nOn your other machine simply open the .deb with the Software Center or use\nsudo dpkg --install /path/to/your/XX.deb\n\n\nA: You sure it's the drivers?

The install-file in /debian specifies the destinations for the project files. To make the installed program work, they need to be executable / have execution permissions with chmod. In particular it is about a python script and a .desktop-file.\nHow do I set those permissions in setup? By only copying them to their destinations it is not done. It would be ok for me if I could trigger a command at the end of setup, or something like this, but don't know how to include this.\n\nA: You could create a post installation script:\ngedit debian/packagename.postinst\n\nThis is just a normal script, so the following instructions will do:\n#!/bin/sh\nset -e\nchmod 755 /path/to/pythonscript.py\nexit 0\n\nAlternatively, you could exclude the file from having its permissions altered by dh_fixperms. This can be done within debian/rules:\n%:\n    dh  $@ --with python2\n\noverride_dh_fixperms:\n    dh_fixperms --exclude path/to/pythonscript.py\n\nThe first option is preferable because dh_fixperms does other useful things like changing the owner of a file, and excluding the file prevents dh_fixperms from doing anything useful. Also note that in the first option, there is a preceding slash /path/to/pythonscript.py as it is an absolute path, whereas the second option is relative to the debian subdirectory.\nEDIT: @AlexisWilke has mentioned a better alternative for option 2, that is:\n%:\n    dh  $@ --with python2\n\noverride_dh_fixperms:\n    dh_fixperms\n    chmod 755 path/to/pythonscript.py\n\nThis allows dh_fixperms to work its magic followed by the minor necessary fix.\n\nA: The .desktop file doesn't need execution permissions, your .py script does.\nbraiam@bt:~$ ls -l /usr/share/app-install/desktop/deluge.desktop \n-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 1276 Aug  6  2012 /usr/share/app-install/desktop/deluge.desktop\nbraiam@bt:~$ ls -l /usr/bin/deluge\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 289 Jan 27  2013 /usr/bin/deluge\n\nYou should before packaging have set the executable bit on the python script, that dpkg will take care of the rest.\nThe .desktop file is a configuration file read by xdg, and has it own variables set to execute the needed binary:\ncat /usr/share/app-install/desktop/deluge.desktop\n[...]\nGenericName=BitTorrent Client\nX-GNOME-FullName=Deluge BitTorrent Client\nComment=Download and share files over BitTorrent\nExec=deluge-gtk %U\nIcon=deluge\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nCategories=Network;FileTransfer;P2P;GTK\nStartupNotify=true\nMimeType=application/x-bittorrent;x-scheme-handler/magnet;\n\nAs you wan see it has a Exec variable that takes care of the execution when the file is accessed.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 USB Boot Stuck I have Windows and Ubuntu (installed with Windows Installer) on this computer and I'm trying to boot Ubuntu 12.04 Desktop amd64 with a Live USB as the partition Ubuntu is on is too small. The boot worked fine on another computer, but for some reason this computer is getting stuck indefinitely at \"Loading Operating System . . .\"\nThis computer doesn't have a CDROM, so USB is the only option.

I went into the BIOS and changed the boot order to recognize the USB first, same results.\nWhen Windows was installed, it was booted off of a USB without any problems. Any ideas as to why it just won't load Ubuntu?\n\nA: Without knowing any details about your hardware config, and anything about the programs you have used, I'd recommend trying more programs to make a bootable USB drive. I usually use Universal Usb Installer, which worked flawlessly every time I tried it. \nOne thing I'd recommend: check the USB drive for partitions.

Please I really need help on how to get Grub working again so I can get my Pc booting again.\n\n\n*\n\n*Thanks\n\n\nA: Looks like when you deleted Ubuntu, you deleted all the files grub needs to run also.  To fix, you need to either reinstall grub, with its files sitting in a /boot/grub directory you create on one of the FAT partitions Windows likes to have around for tools/recovery, or restore the Windows boot block.  The grub approach I've done successfully, make the directories, and from a live media, mount the fat partition you selected, for example sda1:\nsudo mount -tvfat /dev/sda1 /mnt/sda1\n\nThen run\nsudo grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/sd1/boot /dev/sda\n\nYou should have a working grub again.\n* Untested, dangerous below *\n  The other approach of restoring the Windows boot block requires you to have a real set of install media, not the typical crippleware the vendors foist off.  If you can get to the \"Recovery Console\", you should be able to run fixmbr and/or fix boot and things should work again.  Vendor supplied media have no way to get to a recovery console, but lock-step you through their script straight to a reinstall (with no guarantee of fixing the mbr).  Another possible fix which I have no experience with is to find a backup boot block on the Windows root directory and from the live media, use dd to write it to the beginning of the disk.  Worst case is another non-function boot loader, so go back to installing grub.\nGood luck\n", "Q: Host two separate web servers on the same IP I currently have a Ubuntu web server with Apache setup and running wonderfully, I want to do two things, I want to setup two more boxes which would be on the same WAN address but of course have separate local addresses.\nSo say I have www.example.com as the main server\nI also want test.example.com on a different box\nand fun.example.com on a third.\nHow would I accomplish this?\n\nA: From the Link Provided by George Kourouleas\nApache Reverse Proxy\nIs what I was looking for\nNameVirtualHost *:80\n\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n  ServerName foo.com\n\n  DocumentRoot /srv/www/default\n\n  <Location \"/\">\n    Order Deny, Allow\n    Deny from all\n    Allow from all\n  </Location>\n</VirtualHost>\n\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n  ServerName fooa.com\n\n  ProxyPreserveHost on\n  ProxyPass / http://server2/\n  ProxyPassReverse / http://server2/\n</VirtualHost>\n\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n  ServerName foob.com\n  ServerAlias fooc.com\n\n  ProxyPreserveHost on\n  ProxyPass / http://server3/\n  ProxyPassReverse / http://server3/\n</VirtualHost>\n\nIs perfectly what I wanted along with mod_proxy\n\nA: \nNote\nCreating virtual host configurations on your Apache server does not\n  magically cause DNS entries to be created for those host names.

The servers you are querying is your local filesystem, file:/, for your first argument and http.com for your 2nd argument. So no worries, your Apache is not identifying itself as Oversee Turing unless you have told it to do so. Since you give two paths, do you get two responses.\nIt exist a lot of ways to check headers, and since that is not the question will i not cover it.\nFor a in depth explanation:\nFirst, when you are giving / as the path for HEAD is it considered a local absolute path pointing to your filesystem root and will be expanded to file:/. \nSecond, HTTP/1.0 is considered another absolute path. To understand how argument is interpreted, we have to take a closer look in the source beneath. But summed up is the  HEAD command pointing to a perl script.

On a standard desktop installation, I created my administrative and user login.\nFurther with some applications, the system ask for the root password.\nSo my question is: What will be the default password for the root login when I never created it during the installation process?\n\nA: Are you sure that the system is asking for the root password?. It usually asks for your password to request elevation.\n\nA: By default root does not have a password and the root account is locked until you give it a password.\nWhen you installed Ubuntu you were asked to create a user with a password.  If you gave this user a password as requested then this is the password you need.  If not, or you have forgotten it,  then you need to set a password.\nInstructions on how to do it are here:\nHow do I reset a lost administrative password?\nOnce you have an administration password you can use sudo to run commands that would otherwise require you to be root and enter your password.\nIf you want to set a root password see this question\nHow to enable root login?\nHowever, read all the answers carefully first to make sure you want to do this.

Real games that use powerful video cards.\n\nA: Gaming and Linux has been kind of a vicious circle for a long time. Since Linux had (and still has) a small market share, there is little motivation for game developers to port their software, and since there are few games available for Linux, gamers tend to buy Windows anyhow, keeping the market share of Linux small. \nAnother factor is that game development on Windows is often done using proprietary Windows-Only libraries instead of open standards (I won't go into details, for I'd inevitably start to rant about MS...).\nThe situation luckily is not that bad any more. For a long time, many independent game developers have been porting or even developing their games for Linux. Most notable is probably the Humble Indie Bundle, which requires each game to have a native Linux version in order to accept it for a bundle (there's one exception). Since you asked about 3D games: The current bundle includes Brütal Legend, which was ported from the Xbox 360.\nAbout a year ago Valve started to port many of their games to Linux, and meanwhile you can get many commercial Valve games and a lot of indie games via Steam. Actually, Valve confirmed that for some games performance on Linux is superior to Windows.\nAlthough Steam is using DRM and therefore one should think twice before supporting it, gamers using Linux should still hope that steam on Linux is a big enough success to make other game developers follow Valves example and port their games for Linux.\nA technical side note: While game development on Windows is different from Linux (mainly due to DirectX), the technical differences between MacOS and Linux are much smaller (both use OpenGL, both have OpenAL available, and for input exist libs like SDL that are available for both). So, once a game is ported to either of these 2 operating systems, porting to the other requires a much smaller amount of work than porting from Windows.\nLong story short: There are already graphically demanding games available for Linux, yet the selection is by far not yet as big as on Windows, but growing.\nFor many games without a native port, WINE is an acceptable way of running the Windows version, since WINE is not an emulator and can run Windows programs close to native speed (they code is executed natively, yet Windows specific functions have to be translated to their Linux equivalents what creates overhead and slows down execution).\n", "Q: How can I get a 'verbose' apt-get exit code?

Under such assumptions here is my answer.\nFrom the man apt.conf:\n\nDEBUG OPTIONS\nEnabling options in the Debug:: section will cause debugging information to be sent to the standard\n         error stream of the program utilizing the apt libraries, or enable special program modes that are\n         primarily useful for debugging the behavior of apt.\n\nHence, you only need to activate the rules for each of the debugging behaviors of apt-get:\n\n\n*\n\n*Debug::pkgProblemResolver: enables output about the decisions made by dist-upgrade, upgrade,\n       install, remove, purge.\n\n*Debug::NoLocking: disables all file locking. This can be used to run some operations (for instance,\n       apt-get -s install) as a non-root user.\n\n*Debug::pkgDPkgPM: prints out the actual command line each time that apt invokes dpkg(1).\n\n\nThose 3 are the first that the man page recommends, and the first will help you to debug the first error you show. For the second you may need:\n\n\n*\n\n*Debug::Acquire::http: Print information related to downloading packages using HTTP.

Like most users that have searched know, Manufacturers ACPI implementation is a mess and for most of our laptops, battery info is unavailable or wrong (on a dell inspiron 15z, the rate is divided by 10).\nIs there a way (using a perl/python/bash script, an existing package or whatever) to log battery cycles on Ubuntu 12.04? \n(what is a battery cycle ?)\n\nA charge cycle means using all of the battery’s power, but that doesn’t necessarily mean a single charge. For instance, you could listen to your [device] for a few hours one day, using half its power, and then recharge it fully. If you did the same thing the next day, it would count as one charge cycle, not two, so you may take several days to complete a cycle. Each time you complete a charge cycle, it diminishes battery capacity slightly, but you can put [device battery] through many charge cycles before they will only hold 80% of original battery capacity.

Many thanks :)\n\nA: There's a good article on setting up an ubuntu client to print to a networked windows printer at http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/linux-printing.html\nThe article is a few years old (2009) but the procedure should be mostly the same with maybe a few minor differences.\n\nA: Try Likewise Open / Likewise open GUI to join AD. \nThere is a small easy to understand guide here. \nYou need to install likewise-open, likewise-open-gui and winbind. Then you can use GUI to setup the AD authentication. Do everything via Ubuntu software center to install dependencies along with these software.\n", "Q: sudo bash can't execute script I try to run a shell script file but failed so far on Ubuntu.\nIn my terminal:\n~/Desktop/FTL/data$ ls\namd64  exe_icon.bmp  FTL  licenses  resources  x86\n~/Desktop/FTL/data$ sudo bash ./FTL.sh\n[sudo] password for anon: \nbash: ./FTL.sh: No such file or directory\n~/Desktop/FTL/data$ sh FTL.sh\nsh: 0: Can't open FTL.sh\n~/Desktop/FTL/data$ \n\n\nA: Well, as can be deduced from the output of ls command, the name of the file is FTL, not FTL.sh. So you should use:\nsudo bash ./FTL\n\nor\n sh ./FTL\n\nor maybe only:\n./FTL\n\nAlso be sure that the file is executable, by running:\nchmod +x FTL\n\n\nA: First thought is change the extension to .sh. Should be able to run as ./FTL.sh.\nSecond, if it's missing the #!/bin/sh at the top of the file, it won't work then either.\nThird, if you wind up having sudo commands intermixed with commands that don't require sudo, you can echo <sudo_password> | command.\nIn this case, best practice (from an automation/QA perspective) is to run your command as ./FTL.sh <sudo_password> and capture the password to use later in the script for each command that will prompt for sudo password.\nex:\n#!/bin/sh\nPW=$1 #sets first parameter\n...\n# non-sudo commands\n...\necho $PW | command`\n\nIt's also not a bad idea to throw in a yes | when your command asks if you want to continue for any reason. Then you can modify the above to echo $PW | yes | command\nI also typically capture all output during testing, which can be accomplished by appending |& tee path/to/logfile.log to the end of any command, if you want to watch it progress in the console, or switch the |& tee to &> if it has a long run time or otherwise don't want to monitor progress.\nex:\nif echo $PW | yes | command |& tee path/to/logfile.log; then \n  if sed -Fq \"Validation Passed\" path/to/logfile.log; then\n    echo \"PASS: returned 'Validation Pass'\"\n    else echo \"FAIL: test did not return 'Validation Pass'\"\n  fi\n  else echo \"Test Failed\"\nfi\n\nJust a quickie on the sed command, -F allows you to specify the file name (instead of searching a process output) and -q runs sed quietly and exits after it finishes searching the file/process. See sed documentation for more info.\n\nA: Always use this command for every script to be executed by server.\nchmod +x filename.ext\n\n", "Q: Should MaaS and Juju get installed on one of my servers or on a client system? I've been struggling with MaaS and Juju slightly.  I have two servers that I want to use as nodes, but I am unsure of where to install MaaS and Juju.  \nDo they get installed on one of my two servers?\nCan they get installed on a client system like a laptop that is not always on / on the network?\nDo I need to get a very low power cheap system to run them on as my \"management\" system for my servers?\nI hope someone can clear some of these things up for me a bit.\n\nA: I hope this personal experience can help you. \nCurrently I am working through my POC (Proof of Concept) with only three servers.

But I have a remote server which ip is only allowed to have access.\nHow can I tell apt-get to go to my cloud server and via the cloud server get the packages downloaded or updated?\n\nA: Do you have a proxy at your company?\nIf so, you can set the proxy before running the apt-get update logged in as root first:\nexport http_proxy=http://host:port\napt-get update\n\nUsing sudo:\nsudo http_proxy=http://host:port apt-get update\n\nIf your proxy requires authentication, you can set it in the URL (beware that the password will be saved in history as plain text): \nhttp://username:password@host:port\n\n\nA: The permanent method to set the apt-get proxy are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Modifying the apt.conf file. Edit the /etc/apt/apt.conf or create a new file under /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/ with the following content:\nAcquire::http::Proxy \"http://user:password@proxyiporhost:port\";\nAcquire::https::Proxy \"http://user:password@proxyiporhost:port\";\nAcquire::ftp::Proxy \"http://user:password@proxyiporhost:port\";\n\n\n*Calling apt-get with the --options/-o switch. This method allows you to determine the proxy at run time, giving you the ability of an adhoc proxy:\nsudo apt-get -o Acquire::http::Proxy=http://user:password@proxyiporhost:port update\n\nYou can get as many -o you need.\n\n*Using a configuration file. This is a mix between each of previous methods since it won't be a permanent that you have to modify each time you change networks and you can switch on/off as you see fit. For that we will need the -c option. We only need to create a file with the content like the first method and tell apt-get to read it with the switch:\nsudo apt-get -c proxy.conf update\n\n", "Q: kernel panic - not syncing.

What is difference of apt-get and aptitude? Does both of them use same repositories?\nWhich one is better?\n\nA: aptitude is supposed to be a user level program whereas apt-get is supposed to be used by higher level programs. It just turns out apt-get is easy to use so people just use it instead of the higher level managers like aptitude and synaptic.\naptitude is more user-friendly because it adds a layer of abstraction away from apt-get, apt-cache etc..; apt-get is more user-friendly than dpkg for the same reason. It's really down to the user's knowledge and what works best for them. aptitude and apt-get use the same repositories.  Let it be clear that aptitude does not itself run apt-get apt-cache etc.. I merely mean to point out that aptitude is a higher level package manager.\nThe levels of abstraction:\n\n\n*\n\n*aptitude - High level of abstraction\n\n*apt-get, apt-cache, etc.\n\n*dpkg - Low level of abstraction\n\n\nA: \napt-get and aptitude are both front ends to dpkg. Use one or the other\n  but be consistent. aptitude is newer and is suppose to be easier to\n  use. It also unifies some of the apt-* functions.

Monit conducts automatic maintenance and repair and can execute meaningful causal actions in error situations.\nWhat Monit can do\nYou can use Monit to monitor daemon processes or similar programs running on localhost. Monit is particular useful for monitoring daemon processes, such as those started at system boot time from /etc/init.d/. For instance sendmail, sshd, apache and mysql.\nIn difference to many monitoring systems, Monit can act if an error situation should occur, e.g.; if sendmail is not running, Monit can start sendmail again automatically or if apache is using too much resources (e.g. if a DoS attack is in progress) Monit can stop or restart apache and send you an alert message. Monit can also monitor process characteristics, such as; how much memory or cpu cycles a process is using.\nYou can also use Monit to monitor files, directories and filesystems on localhost. Monit can monitor these items for changes, such as timestamps changes, checksum changes or size changes. This is also useful for security reasons - you can monitor the md5 or sha1 checksum of files that should not change and get an alert or perform an action if they should change.\nMonit can monitor network connections to various servers, either on localhost or on remote hosts. TCP, UDP and Unix Domain Sockets are supported. Network test can be performed on a protocol level; Monit has built-in tests for the main Internet protocols, such as HTTP, SMTP etc. Even if a protocol is not supported you can still test the server as you can configure Monit to send any data and test the response from the server.\nMonit can be used to test programs or scripts at certain times, much like cron, but in addition, you can test the exit value of a program and perform an action or send an alert if the exit value indicates an error. This means that you can use Monit to perform any type of check you can write a script for.\nFinally, Monit can be used to monitor general system resources on localhost such as overall CPU usage, Memory and Load Average.\n\nDownload: \nInstall with Ubuntu Software Center: Monit \n", "Q: Problem with installing Ubuntu 12.04 lts while having windows 7 already on laptop I already have windows 7 on my laptop, and I want to install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on that too.When I am installing Ubuntu its asking for restore full hard drive.

How to raise user notifications in Ubuntu using Java code?\n\nA: You can use java-gnome, a java binding for GTK and GNOME to display notify-osd notifications. You'll need to install the library first:  \nsudo apt-get install libjava-gnome-java libjava-gnome-java-doc   \n\nHere is a quick example:\nimport org.gnome.gtk.Gtk;\nimport org.gnome.notify.Notification;\nimport org.gnome.notify.Notify;\n\npublic class notifyTest {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {  \n\n        Gtk.init(args); // initialize Gtk\n        Notify.init(\"Program Name\"); // initalize the notification system  \n\n        Notification myNotification = new Notification(\"Hello world!\", \"This is an example notification.\", \"dialog-information\"); // create the notification object\n        myNotification.show(); // show the notification  \n\n    }\n\n\n}\n\nThe general format for a notification is this:  \nNotification someName = new Notification(\"Summary\", \"Body\", \"Icon\")  \n\nBoth the body and icon fields can be null, but there must be a summary. For a list of icons you can use by default check the Notify-OSD page of the Ubuntu Wiki.  \nYou then call:  \nsomeName.show();  \n\nTo display the notification. For more information see the java-gnome Notify and Notification doc pages.  \n\nNote: You must have both Gtk and Notify initialized before you can send any notifications.\n\n", "Q: I want the Firefox icon on the launcher to open a new window if there is no Firefox window open on the current workspace I'm using Ubuntu Raring Ringtail, with three monitors and four workspaces. Currently, if I click on the Firefox button on the launcher and Firefox is already running but there is no Firefox window on the current workspace, it switches to a workspace which already has an open Firefox window.\nI don't want it to do that. When I click the button it should open a new Firefox window on the current workspace, if there isn't already one. Is it possible to configure the launcher to work that way?\n\nA: The launcher already is configured that way:\nHold down Shift while clicking the Firefox Icon, and you get a new Instance, instead of switching to the current one..\nIf you need more help with Unitys functions, hold down the super key and wait for the Help to pop up.\nHave Fun.\n", "Q: Upgrade gnome-shell in ubuntu12.04 I have gnome-shell version 3.4 installed in my Ubuntu 12.04.

I also need admins to be able to make persistent changes. Can I achieve this?\nAll I have is minimal install, X-windows, Firefox and Citrix Receiver. It won't help to point out that there isn't much for a user to change, nor to suggest using an actual live CD, this has to be a hard-disk install. I'm thinking that redirecting all changes to a RAM disk would be ideal but I have no idea how to do this and would welcome some expert advice. \nThanks in advance.\n\nA: I believe you can run your distro as live from hard disk itself. You can create manual entry in grub2 as per the instruction in given link run-linux-live-images-from-hard-disk-in-linux. But still i am searching for a way to make it persistent. I hope that helps.\n", "Q: Info documentation may be missing I just started learning Linux. I'm trying to read through all the documentation contained in the Info files. I first noticed them on a Mac (running Mountain Lion) when I typed the \"info info\" command. It brought up a handy tutorial on how to navigate through the nodes.\nI don't want to waste company time while reading these docs on my work machine, so I tried to find the same tutorial on my Ubuntu machine at home (running 13.04). I typed \"info info\" again, but the output seems different. One of the available options was to hit \"H\" for a beginner's tutorial. I thought this was the same thing, but when I hit \"H\", it says there is no file or directory with that name. Typing \"h\" just brings up a short list of commands, not the in-depth file I was looking for.\nWhat am I missing?\n\nA: You can install it from the texinfo-doc-nonfree package:\nsudo apt install texinfo-doc-nonfree\n\nQuoted from /usr/share/doc/info/README.Debian:\nThis package does not contain the info documentation of info and texinfo,\nas they are licensed under the GNU Free Document License with Cover Texts,\nwhich is considered as non-free in Debian.\n\n\nA: Found the Info Manual here: http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/manual/info/\nDownload the gzipped tar file;\nwget https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/manual/info/info.info.tar.gz\nExtract it;\ntar xf info.info.tar.gz\nAnd place the file in the info directory;\nmv info.info /usr/share/info/\nThe \"info info\" command should now take you to this documentation.\n\nA: Indeed, there seems to be no info page for info.\nWhat you see is the man page for info. It's certainly a bug, because even this man page says you'd better go and use info info to read info...\nThe practical solution for that problem would be to use the pinfo command instead of info - it's a text mode info browser too, but a little more modern:\npinfo pinfo\n\n\nNot sure what the current title \"Info documentation may be missing\" means; \nBut in general, the \"info\" format - with the full name \"GNU Texinfo\" - is mostly used by GNU related projects;\nThat means it's missing in many cases.  \nLuckily, man pages are available almost allways. \nSo the info browser just shows the man page instead if the info page is not found, so that it will still work for non-GNU software, just less useful.\nYour own answer took care of the other interpretation of\n\"Info documentation may be missing\"\n", "Q: will installing Ubuntu convert my hard disk to a dynamic disk? I have 3 partitions in windows 8, and I want to install Ubuntu ,and I know Ubuntu will need at least 2 partitions,so in total it will be 5 partitions in the hard disk, so will this convert my hard disk to a to dynamic disk?\n\nA: No, dynamic disks are a Windows thing that is not supported in Ubuntu.  If you are using the msdos partition table ( recent UEFI machines with Windows 8 should be using GPT ), then the installer will create a 4th partition called extended partition, and place the other logical partitions inside it.\n", "Q: How to Install Xubuntu 13.04 inside windows 7 I downloaded iso image for xubuntu amd64 but there is no wubi.exe in the package, is there is any way to install xubuntu inside windows 7?\nYour help is appreciated!\n\nA: WUBI is not available in 13.04.\nIn order to try out Ubuntu 13.04 using Wubi installer, you will have to install 12.10 using the installer and then upgrade Ubuntu to 13.04. (not recommended personally). \nI would suggest that you install along side, it would be the next best thing to WUBI.\nWindows installer is not compatible with Windows 8 or UEFI firmware, and is not available for Ubuntu 13.04.Ubuntu\nYou can't install 13.04 using WUBI since Canonical dropped WUBI from 13.04\nUsers, on the other hand, will need to look at a virtualization app like VirtualBox if they want a low-impact way to try out Ubuntu. \n\nCanonical is planning to remove Wubi from Ubuntu 13.04.\nSteve Langasek of Canonical notes that due to increasing bug reports,\n  Wubi is not in very good shape for having a release. The Wubi 13.04\n  installer fails to detect other ISOs, the 13.04 installer isn't\n  creating user accounts, and isn't even working with Microsoft Windows\n  8. Rather than fixing it, Canonical wants to junk the work.\nLangasek says, \"the Foundations team does not expect Wubi to be in a\n  releasable state for 13.04...I am therefore proposing to drop Wubi\n  from the 13.04 release, starting immediately with the upcoming Beta.\n  This will save our testers from spending their time testing an image\n  that will not have developers working on fixing the bugs they find,\n  and spares our users from using an image for 13.04 that is not up to\n  Ubuntu's standards of quality.\"Phoronix\n\n\n", "Q: Does an upgrade from 12.10 to 13.04 will effect the version of PHP/other packages installed? My work laptop is running Ubuntu 12.10 (32-bit). Due to the need to be able to test our code in the same versions of PHP, Memcache, and a few other modules; I need to keep the PHP version right where they are at (for example PHP 5.3.x). However I would like to upgrade to my current OS version to Ubuntu 13.04.\nCan I upgrade without worrying that Ubuntu will also upgrade the PHP package and other related packages? Or will it just do that whether I like it or not?\nThanks!\nEdit:\nAfter running \"sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -V\" I get the following results:\nThe following packages will be REMOVED:\n   libmemcached6 (0.44-1.1build1)\n   php5-intl (5.4.6-1ubuntu1.4)\n   php5-memcached (2.0.1-6)\n   php5-xsl (5.4.6-1ubuntu1.4)\nThe following NEW packages will be installed:\n   libjs-underscore (1.3.3-1ubuntu1)\n   libmemcached10 (1.0.8-1)\n   libmemcachedutil2 (1.0.8-1)\n   linux-headers-3.5.0-40 (3.5.0-40.62)\n   linux-headers-3.5.0-40-generic (3.5.0-40.62)\n   linux-image-3.5.0-40-generic (3.5.0-40.62)\n   linux-image-extra-3.5.0-40-generic (3.5.0-40.62)\nThe following packages have been kept back:\n   php-apc (3.1.7-1 => 3.1.13-1)\nThe following packages will be upgraded:\n   libmemcached-tools (0.44-1.1build1 => 1.0.8-1)\n   linux-headers-generic (3.5.0.31.47 => 3.5.0.40.56)\n   linux-image-generic (3.5.0.31.47 => 3.5.0.40.56)\n   mercurial (2.6.1-1ppa1~quantal1 => 2.7-0ppa1~quantal1)\n   mercurial-common (2.6.1-1ppa1~quantal1 => 2.7-0ppa1~quantal1)\n   tortoisehg (2.8-0ppa1~quantal1 => 2.9-0ppa1~quantal1)\nThe following packages will be DOWNGRADED:\n   libapache2-mod-php5 (5.3.10-1ubuntu3.6 => 5.3.10-1ubuntu3)\n   php5-cli (5.3.10-1ubuntu3.6 => 5.3.10-1ubuntu3)\n   php5-common (5.3.10-1ubuntu3.6 => 5.3.10-1ubuntu3)\n   php5-curl (5.3.10-1ubuntu3.6 => 5.3.10-1ubuntu3)\n   php5-gd (5.3.10-1ubuntu3.6 => 5.3.10-1ubuntu3)\n   php5-mysql (5.3.10-1ubuntu3.6 => 5.3.10-1ubuntu3)\n   php5-sqlite (5.3.10-1ubuntu3.6 => 5.3.10-1ubuntu3)\n   php5-sybase (5.3.10-1ubuntu3.6 => 5.3.10-1ubuntu3)\n\nSo it looks like I would be fine.\n\nA: No. PHP is not a dependency of Ubuntu 13.04. \nFYI, when you do sudo apt-get dist-upgrade via the command line, it will list all packages that are slated for upgrade. You can double check for PHP's existence.\n\nA: I found something really interesting while I was searching some more points for your question. This will help you understand more about an Upgrading process. You may read it here. In addition to that, I assume below will help you to understand too;\nAs I know, Ubuntu by default doesn't have Apache, PHP, MySQL running. You will have to install afterwards. And an OS upgrade will not effect your /home/ files but all system settings /etc/ with the set of default (automatically) installed packages. Since LAMP isn't a default package, I don't think it will make any changes unless if there's any needs. Because the updater looks for a newer version of manually installed packages. \nTo further investigate, you can use sudo apt-mark showmanual package-name or just sudo apt-mark showmanual to check for the manual and sudo apt-mark showauto to view automatically installed packages. \nSources which helped me to collect info;\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Upgrade Notes\n\n*Upgrade from 12.10 to 13.04\nHope these helps!\n", "Q: Desktop icons specific to a certain workspace?

I need to set up a server with public IP for bandwidth testing, and I already have a script to drop all incoming traffic except for the ports I need. I have changed the ssh port from default (22) to another one (let's call it XXXXX; sorry for the paranoia but we just got hacked last week).\nSo my question is how can I allow a range of IP's to ssh into the server through that specific port?\nThe script I mentioned earlier:\niptables -F\niptables -P INPUT DROP\niptables -P FORWARD DROP\niptables -P OUTPUT DROP\niptables -A INPUT -i em1 -p tcp --dport XXXXX -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\niptables -A OUTPUT -o em1 -p tcp --sport XXXXX -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\niptables -A OUTPUT -o em1 -p tcp --dport XXXXX -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -i em1 -p tcp --sport XXXXX -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\n\nSo I just need to add the ip range so that I can ssh remotely.\n\nA: Use the -s option of iptables. It accepts an IP of the form nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn or with a mask (nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn/nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn or nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn/nn). So to allow for example connections from nnn.nnn.nnn.* you can write\niptables -A INPUT -s nnn.nnn.nnn.0/255.255.255.0 -i em1 -p tcp --dport XXXXX -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\n\nor\niptables -A INPUT -s nnn.nnn.nnn.0/24 -i em1 -p tcp --dport XXXXX -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\n\n(see for example here for netmask calculation)\nIf you cannot create a netmask, then I'm afraid you will have to duplicate the rule for each of the IP addresses you want to allow to connect to your server.\nIn general, though, I never found working with iptables directly very nice, one can quickly loose the overview. I'd probably go for something like shorewall.\n", "Q: How to reset ifconfig counters?

If not, enabled packet forwarding by setting net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1 in /etc/sysctl.conf.

However, you should also do the same thing for net.ipv4.ip_dynaddr.  \nSimply go to the samre file he told you to edit (/etc/sysctl.conf) and instead of just inserting net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1 instead insert:  \nnet.ipv4.ip_forward = 1\nnet.ipv4.ip_dynaddrn = 1  \n\nAfterwards, do a sysctl -p as he recomended.\n", "Q: How to install VirtualBox on Kubuntu 12.04 with lts-raring hardware enablement stack? I'm running Kubuntu 12.04 with the lts-raring hardware enablement stack. When I first installed the lts-raring hardware enablement stack I had problems with virtualbox but I resolved those (see \"Background\" below). However, a recent update caused new and more severe problems. Whenever I try to start a virtual machine at the moment the virtual machine boots into the GUI, my entire system (the host OS) crashes (it instantly reboots without warning).\nIn researching this I see the following bug report:\nBug #1127101 “Installing LTSEnablementStack in Ubuntu 12.04.2 breaks VirtualBox”\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/virtualbox/+bug/1127101\n\nTemporary workaround : uninstall Virtualbox and install Virtualbox-4.2\n  from Oracle repositories. See here for instructions :\n  http://www.ubuntuupdates.org/ppa/virtualbox.org_contrib?dist=precise\n\nIs that the best solution or the recommended approach?

That solved the problem.\nThe download link for Linux is:\nhttps://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads\nIt is actually a simpler install because you don't need to install guest additions separately.

Currently, all my config dotfiles and dotfolders (e.g. .cache,.adobe,.compiz) are in my $HOME folder. Is there a environment variable that I can specify which will make all applications save their respective dot files in that folder? e.g.\nexport CONFIG_FOLDER=\"/home/rajiv/dotfiles\"\n\nIf so, where do I specify this?\n\nA: In short, no.  There is no environment variable that will force applications to save their dotfiles to any path other than $HOME.\nAn alternative, semi-manual approach would be to use GNU Stow, a symlink farm manager, to move config files for binary packages, as described in this blog post.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Builder ISO File?

I don't know why.\nWhat can I do? \n\nA: If you want to change the shell for your user, you do not need to become root. Just type:\nchsh\n\nwithout sudo and without arguments.\n\nSee also man chsh:\n\nThe chsh command changes the user login shell. This determines the name\nof the user's initial login command. A normal user may only change the\nlogin shell for her own account; the superuser may change the login\nshell for any account.\n\n\nA: My machine is using LDAP authentication and I don't have access to the server. So my workaround was to change $SHELL variable to zsh at the end of my .bashrc file.\n$SHELL=/bin/zsh\n$SHELL\nSo for me when I open terminal bash opens zsh.\n\nA: My computer is part of a network using distributed authentication, so my user details would not appear in the local /etc/passwd file (but are visible using getent passwd userid) (thanks @steeldriver).\nIn my case I had to do chsh on a core machine.\n\nA: There is a workaround for gnome-terminal:\n\n*\n\n*Go to Edit → Profile preferences → Title and Command.\n\n*Check Run a custom command instead of my shell.\n\n*Provide bash as the Custom command (or fish, or anything).\n\n\nA: If you forgot your user name, you can use whoami command to remember you.\nSo, try with:\nsudo chsh $(whoami)\n\nIf indeed, doesn't exist a line starting with your user name in /etc/passwd file (which seems inexplicable), you can add a new one like this:\nusername:x:1000:1000:your real name,,,:/home/username:/bin/bash\nSee also: Understanding /etc/passwd File Format.\n\nA: If you are using LDAP authentication by PAM or something, you have to find your answer in your LDAP Server. Let's aim it for Microsoft AD, in which case your domain account is not in /etc/passwd when you log in, but you can see your user property in AD, by getent passwd | grep user.\nIf at the end it shows your shell is /bin/csh, that's because in your AD there is a attribute for that. So if you have administrator account on AD, you can fix it yourself. Otherwise just tell your AD admin to enable advance features in the View tab of Active directory users and computers > User properties > UNIX attributes. There you can change the login shell to /bin/bash.\nBe sure you don't forget to run:\nsudo /opt/pbis/bin/config LoginShellTemplate /bin/bash\n\nSource: User does not exist in /etc/passwd when trying to change the default shell.\n\nA: If you are trying to ssh into a remote host with a domain user, you might not be able to change your shell using chsh as @Masoud mentioned. But here is a simple workaround for this case - whenever you ssh into the machine, do this:\nssh my-host -t \"zsh --login\"\nor\nssh my-host -t \"cd /data/repos; zsh --login\"\nIf you also want to login directly into a different working dir.\nEdit: \nAnother simple option that does not require ssh command manipulation: \n\n\n*\n\n*Edit your profile file: vi ~/.profile\n\n*Launch your favorite shall by calling it at the last line, e.g. zsh\n\n*Save and quit (:wq) \n\n\nThis solution also has the advantage that it persists when creating new sub-shells, for example when using tmux.\n\nA: This answer helped me.\nIn your ~/.profile add\nif [ \"$SHELL\" != \"/bin/bash\" ]\nthen\n    export SHELL=\"/bin/bash\"\n    exec /bin/bash -l    # -l: login shell again\nfi\n\nOr whatever other shell you want to use\n\nA: Open the file ~/.bashrc and add this at the end :\n# Run zsh\nif [ \"$SHELL\" != \"/usr/bin/zsh\" ]\nthen\n    export SHELL=\"/usr/bin/zsh\"\n    exec /usr/bin/zsh\nfi\n\nDon't forget to configure zsh :\n\n*\n\n*By typing \"zsh\" in a bash terminal.\n\n*Or by creating the file ~/.zshrc with default content\n\n\nA: the solution for active directory accounts is as follows:\n$vim ~/.bashrc\nand add this at the end :\nif [ \"$SHELL\" != \"/usr/bin/zsh\" ]\nthen\nexport SHELL=\"/usr/bin/zsh\"\nexec /usr/bin/zsh\nfi\n", "Q: .nfs0000... files keep showing up and disappearing when using Mercurial As of late, something seems to have happened on my machine that is more annoying than anything else: every time I look in a directory for Mercurial changes it tells me about two .nfs#### files that then immediately vanish.  #### seems to increment every time they flicker back.\nIs my computer going nuts?

They appear on an NFS server when a file is deleted, but is still open by a client. The server must not delete the file because it still needs to provide the data to the clients that have it open. On the other hand, the server must delete the file because the process that deleted it expects it to no longer exist. So the NFS server renames the file to a name that hopefully nobody cares about.\nIt's no use to try deleting them: you'd be deleting a file that's still open by an NFS client, so the server would only create a new .nfs* file to keep the data.\nEventually the client will close the files and the .nfs* droppings will vanish.\nYou can instruct Mercurial to ignore those files. In the [ui] section of your ~/.hgrc, add the line ignore = ~/.hgignore.global, and create the file ~/.hgignore.global containing the line .nfs*.\n", "Q: Prevent non-root users from viewing /var/www Is there a way to prevent users from viewing /var/www?\nI tried chmod 0750 on /var/www, however, that prevented the webserver from viewing the files as well.\nThanks!\n\nA: Well, that apache user needs access.\nIMO ...\nsudo chown -R root:www-data /var/www\n\nYour permissions of 750 should then work.\nWith that said, sort of silly as users can still see the data via a web browser ( http: //localhost ) So be sure to password protect the data from apache ...\n", "Q: Modify gtk3 theme - menu bar I've installed FaienceZukiMac gtk3 theme and there's a \"white balloon\" surrounding each entry in the menu of every gtk3 program.\nHere's a screenshot of what I'm talking about\n\nHow can I change it in order to remove that \"white balloon\" and make it the same color as the general background?\nI was messing with the color values of the gtk-main.css with no luck.

Each node has its individual status: it be CLAIMED (potentially usable) or UNCLAIMED (no driver has been detected for this node), ENABLED (this device is supported and can be used) or DISABLED (this device is supported but has been disabled):\na node is marked as CLAIMED if a driver (usually a kernel module or a driver within the monolithic kernel) has been loaded for it\na node is marked as UNCLAIMED if no specific support for it has been loaded (or lshw has been unable to identify the driver)\na node is marked as ENABLED if a driver has been loaded for it and is fully functional\na node is marked as DISABLED if the node has been disabled by a configuration, some hardware failure, etc. \n\n\nA: In a hardware list report produced by sudo lshw -html, you can examine the html source to see what color represents what.  There is a css style block at the top which may include lines like the following:\n.node-unclaimed {border: dotted thin #c3c3c3; padding: 1em; background: #fafafa; color: red; }\n.node-disabled {border: solid thin #f55; padding: 1em; background: #fee; color: gray; }\n\nThese are your \"red\" styles, as follows:\n\"Unclaimed\" (no driver present or detected for device) items are shown as red text on a light grey background in a box with a dotted thin border.\n\"Disabled\" (driver present/detected but turned off in configuration or by failure) items are shown as dark grey text on a light red background with a solid thin border.\nIf in doubt, you can view source and search for the text node-unclaimed, node-disabled, etc.  to see what blocks they represent.  \"Enabled\" items seem to be simply marked with class=\"node\" and show up on that yellow background.\n", "Q: The intel-microcode package causes random errors I installed the latest intel-microcode package and I'm getting random system error boxes coming up.

All notes seem to be stored in the /Notebooks subfolder, specifically.\nNext time you are searching for folders and files belonging to a specific application you can use the locate command. I was able to find the directories above with two simple locate lookups:\nlocate springseed\nlocate Springseed\n\n", "Q: reset Password not accepted I reset my password in ubuntu 12.04.

This question is related to another one by @Stefan, but it is not a duplicate of it. The questions are slightly different: the author simply wanted to know if this had been implemented, while I'm asking for help specifically on how to do this (in a particular way). Additionally, the other question got no useful answers for implementers, except a recent one that merely linked to my attempt at this.\nHaving explained the \"duplicate\" issue...\nI'm on Ubuntu 14.04 using full disk encryption (LVM on top of LUKS) and I would like to incorporate luksSuspend into the suspend procedure (and later use luksResume) so that I can suspend to RAM without leaving key material on memory and the root unlocked.\nI've tried to port a script for Arch Linux, so far without success: I honestly have no idea of what I'm doing...\nCan anyone help me port this (or create something like this from scratch)? Or, at least, can anyone point me to documentation about how to hook stuff into the suspend procedures and how to keep the necessary binaries and scripts (such as cryptsetup) available even after all IO to root has been blocked (by luksSuspend)?\nConcerning how to keep the necessary binaries and scripts available for resume, this other blog post (also for Arch) copied them to /boot; I would like however to use something more in the lines what Vianney used in the script I mentioned before, because that approach appears to be a bit more elegant in this aspect.\nI haven't reached much, but my development can be found on GitHub.\n\nA: Sorry to state the obvious, but have you tried adding a script containing the cryptsetup luksSuspend/luksResume commands to the /usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d? If so what happened?  \nIt would seem logical to me, to call stop/start the cryptdisks and cryptdisks_early services on hibernate/resume too.  Would calling cryptdisks_stop and cryptdisks_start within a script in pm-utils/sleep.d do the trick? I assume this would have the same result as calling cryptsetup luksSuspend directly.  \n\nA: The closest solution I've been able to find is this 2013 proof of concept suspend.sh script by Mikko Rauhala.\n#!/bin/sh\n\n# A proof of concept script for forgetting LUKS passwords on suspend\n# and reasking them on resume.\n\n# The basic idea is to copy all of the files necessary for luksResume\n# onto a RAM disk so that we can be sure they'll be available without\n# touching the disk at all. Then switch to a text VT to run the resume\n# (easier to make sure it'll come up than to do the same with X).\n\n# The suspend itself has to be done from the ramdisk too to make sure it\n# won't hang. This is also a reason why this couldn't be reliably done as a\n# self-contained /etc/pm/sleep.d script, so to make the concept clear\n# (and because I'm lazy) I did just a minimal standalone proof of concept\n# instead. Integrating the functionality into the usual pm tools would be\n# encouraged. (Though suspend_pmu would apparently need perl on the ramdisk...)\n\n# (C) 2013 Mikko Rauhala 2013, modifiable and distributable under\n# CC0, GPLv2 or later, MIT X11 license or 2-clause BSD.

If you change a DNS record, it at first is only changed in the name server you changed it at. So if a machine uses another name server, it still gets told that your site is at the old IP. But name servers \"talk to each other\" on a regular basis and update their records accordingly. This of course takes some time. As a rule of thumb, after 24 hours most name servers should \"know\" about a change. Sometimes it goes faster, sometimes it takes more time. \nIf after about 24 hours your browser still gets directed to the wrong (old) IP, you'd want to take a closer look at your network settings and/or talk to your internet provider.\n\nA: Henning already answered the question very well. Further, linux also caches the DNS nameservers for domains that are visited. This cache can be flushed using nscd.\nFirst sudo apt-get install nscd if you don't have it installed.

Is there a way to change it?\n\nA: If you install MongoDB using apt-get, the executable files and libraries will be installed to your OS drive. By default, the packaged version of MongoDB stores its data in /var/lib/mongodb which, unless you've put part or all of your /var directory on your larger drive, will also be on your OS drive.\nIf you want to install absolutely all the MongoDB files on your other drive, you would need to download the unpackaged binary distribution from the MongoDB website and install manually.

Today (2013-09-21) I installed all updates that were available without carefully reading through the list (shame on me), since noone touched the computer for some weeks and the list was more than 100 items long...\nI remember from another machine, that one of the updates changes the boot system on UEFI machines in order to always use shim, even if restricted boot is disabled. \nWell, problem diagnosis is rather straightforward: Something went wrong with the bootloader update, although no error was given, and the Ubuntu entry went missing from the UEFI boot menu, making the computer try to boot in BIOS mode, of course failing. If I run efibootmgr from a bootable USB it only shows the BIOS boot mode for the HDD...\nHow do I restore the Ubuntu entry in the UEFI menu to make the machine bootable again?\n\nA: A simpler solution than the one provided by soulsource is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot with an emergency disc in EFI mode. The Ubuntu installation disc should work for this.\n\n*If necessary, install efibootmgr.\n\n*Type sudo efibootmgr -c -d /dev/sda -p 1 -l \\\\EFI\\\\ubuntu\\\\grubx64.efi -L Ubuntu. Change grubx64.efi to shimx64.efi if you're booting with Secure Boot enabled. Change -d /dev/sda to your boot disk if it's not /dev/sda, and change -p 1 to the number of your EFI System Partition (ESP). (The command I provided assumes the ESP is on /dev/sda1, which seems to be the case based on the information you've provided.)\n\n\nThe Boot Repair tool can also fix the problem, but it will try to do more than simply restore the original GRUB entry. This opens the possibility for it to cause damage by accident, so if you're comfortable with issuing shell commands, I recommend running efibootmgr manually for this task.\nIt's also possible to do the same thing using the Windows bcdedit command or the EFI shell's bcfg command. The Installing rEFInd Manually section of my rEFInd documentation describes how to use these commands to register rEFInd with the firmware. You should be able to easily adapt these commands for GRUB.\n\nA: While formulating the question I found a solution myself, although I'm not convinced this is the suggested way to deal with the issue. \nFirst I booted off a Ubuntu 12.04 64bit USB flash drive in UEFI mode. Then I mounted the file systems from the HDD in the correct order (in the following, replace the device nodes with the correct ones for your system of course:\nsudo -i #to get a root shell\nmount /dev/sda4 /mnt           #Root partition\nmount /dev/sda2 /mnt/boot      #Boot partition\nmount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot/efi  #efi partition\n\nThen I chrooted to the now mounted HDD:\nmount -o bind /dev /mnt/dev    #make system folders available in chroot environment\nmount -o bind /proc /mnt/proc\nmount -o bind /sys /mnt/sys\nchroot /mnt\n\nNow, there are guides online that tell to run grub-install with a lot of fancy arguments. Those mady my computer crash... Finally it was as simple as to run \ngrub-install\n\nwithout any arguments. Now, if I run efibootmgr I got a new entry named Ubuntu and put on top of the boot option list (and having number 0000).\nAfter a reboot, the system worked again. I'm just afraid that the next update of the kernel, grub, or anything else that has to do with booting might break the system again...\n", "Q: How can I change the behavior of enter key in pidgin?

To change this, you should pass --sysconfdir=/etc to the configure program.\nSince /usr/local/apache2/sbin is not in your $PATH, you are using the Apache installation from your distribution (which usually resides in /usr/sbin). Either specify the full path (sudo /usr/local/apache2/sbin/apachectl start) or put the apache2 directory in your PATH before executing.

For good measure, you might also contact them with a separate message.\n(I don't know that this will really help, but it's what I did today, and currrently I'm waiting for the system administrators to respond. I'm using Ubuntu 14.04. I found the connection test failed on my university's Adobe Connect server, but it succeeded on Adobe's test page https://arcps.adobeconnect.com/common/help/en/support/meeting_test.htm, so I'm hoping the failure was due to some misconfiguration.)\nUpdate: my university's server administrator found this trouble is due to an unresolved bug in Adobe's Flash player; see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/flashplugin-nonfree/+bug/1064353.  I had been using Firefox; he advised me to use the 3rd workaround in the bug report: use Google Chrome on Linux, with its Pepper flash player.  I had previously installed the Ubuntu chromium-browser package, and now I installed the Ubuntu package pepperflashplugin-nonfree, which provides this plugin for Chromium.  Using Chromium browser, I am now able to connect to Connect server.  Since Google now provides a deb package for Chrome, that would probably also work.\n\nA: Adobe Connect does not currently support any Ubuntu version except Ubuntu 10.04 as stated in the Adobe Connect Page. You may choose to wait for the Adobe Connect 9.1 Add In to launch or you may use VirtualBox to install a copy of Ubuntu 10.04 (I think you don't want to use a release that old) and install the Adobe Connect 8 Add In which is available on the Adobe Connect Download Page.\n\nA: I've had the same issue (Adobe Connect stalls in \"Connecting...\" state) with Kubuntu 13.10 / Firefox 28 / Flashplayer 11.2.\nI've found a workaround by installing Google Chrome, which brings its own variant of Flashplayer. It works there, so I use Chrome for web meetings now.\n", "Q: How can I use Ubuntu live disk to get my data from a dead laptop hard drive?

If this is just a test, then rather than making any persistent changes to your mount options in /etc/fstab, it should be possible to remount the partition temporarily with the suid enabled using\n$ sudo mount -o remount,suid /home\n\nFor example (since my home partition is not regularly mounted nosuid I'll do that first, for the sake of illustration):\n$ ls -l id_demo\n-rwsrwxr-x 1 root root 7394 Sep 21 08:52 id_demo\n$ \n$ sudo mount -o remount,nosuid /home\n$ ./id_demo\nreal uid: 1006\neffective uid: 1006\n\nThen testing again after remounting with option suid\n$ sudo mount -o remount,suid /home\n$ ./id_demo\nreal uid: 1006\neffective uid: 0\n\nNote that chmod u+s should be sufficient for your test (chmod a+s should not be necessary).\n\nA: The \"SUID/NOSUID\" that mount tells you about isn't about your \"user account\". See  man mount.  It's a security feature, and tells the system to recognize/ignore setuid executables on the mounted medium. When a setuid executable is executed, from a disk mounted with SUID, it will run with the UID of the owner of the executable, rather than running with your UID.  \nIn short, don't worry about it\nIf you want to worry about it, the SUID/NOSUID bit comes from /etc/fstab (see man -k fstab;man 5 fstab, and is applied at mount time (for that device). \n", "Q: Dell e6400 and wifi problem I'm trying to run a Dell e6400 will Ubuntu and having no success with getting on wifi.

Basically it uses UDEV to check any change in the connection and acts accordingly.\nEverything works fine except one thing: I can't use notify-send to warn about the change. I use the following code (output is just a wrapper to subprocess.check_output):\noutput(\"sudo -u {0} notify-send \\\"{1}\\\" \\\"{2}\\\"\".format(user, title, message))\n\nbut I don get any notification at all.\nWhat is really odd is that if I run hdmi_sound_toggle (as a normal user or with sudo) everything works just fine!\nSo what could be the problem here? There is any better way to present a notification than with notify-send?\n\nA: The notify-send has trouble putting notifications on a user's screen when called from a script run by root or another user.\nYou should use:\noutput(\"export DISPLAY=:0; sudo -u {0} notify-send \\\"{1}\\\" \\\"{2}\\\"\".format(user, title, message))\n\nSo, use:\nexport DISPLAY=:0\n\nNormally a user is on display :0, but to be sure, you can find which display a user is on using who command as follow:\nwho | grep -m1 ^username.*\\( | awk '{print $5}' | sed 's/[(|)]//g'\n\nThis worked for me in this script.\nSee also: Can I launch a graphical program on another user's desktop as root?\n\nA: I was researching a consistent way to notify all X users (as root) and my research (looking at a bunch of places on the net) indicated that although it was possible to use notify-send in this way, it required scripting to find DBUS session info and/or DISPLAY's in use and/or Xauthority file names and locations, and even then sometimes people still couldn't get it to work. In summary, trying to bend notify-send to your will to enable broadcasting to X users will prove to be unreliable (particularly if you upgrade or change distro at some point in the future).\nHowever... on my system the wall command worked like a charm and is incredibly simple to use. The only downside is that it also broadcasts the message to all text terminals/consoles as well. If you don't mind that, then wall might be a better and more reliable option. Note: the user invoking wall must be root.\n\nA: Radu's answer does not seem to work for me on 16.04. Rather than try to fight the DISPLAY problem which seems to change with different releases, I go about this in a slightly different manner. I create a single script that is called in two ways. A udev rule calls the script, sending some kind of output to a named pipe. Upon login, the script is also started in a service mode. Here it listens to the pipe and runs the desired GUI command.\nAs an example, I like to receive notifications of USB storage devices as they are attached, and in particular, I like to know what the path of the device is and its serial number (that may seem strange but I have good reasons). Here's the script I use to accomplish this.\n#!/bin/bash\n# script name: usb-notify.sh\n# This script needs to be called at logon with \"service\" parameter\n# This script needs to be called by udev on USB insertion with no parameter\n\npipe=\"/tmp/usb-notifications\"\nif [ \"$1\" == \"service\" ]; then\n    # create the named pipe that will help us trigger events from udev\n    rm \"$pipe\"\n    mkfifo \"$pipe\"\n\n    # This outer while loop ensures that we can process multiple triggers\n    while true\n    do\n        # This inner while loop reads individual trigger events\n        while read info\n        do\n            # run some GUI command. Here, I'm running notify-send\n            notify-send \"USB Inserted\" \"$(echo -e $info)\"\n        done < \"$pipe\"\n    done\nelse\n    # Here's where udev triggers our event. If you don't need to pass any arguments\n    # you  could just as easily pass an empty line as a trigger for the service.\n    [ -e \"$pipe\" ] && echo \"Device: $DEVNAME\\\\\\nSN: $ID_SERIAL_SHORT\" > \"$pipe\"\nfi\n\nThis script then needs to be called in two ways.\nFirst, a udev rule needs to be created to call this script. This can be done with the following command (obviously you should change this to watch whatever device should be triggering your script):\necho 'ACTION==\"add\",KERNEL==\"sd?\",RUN+=\"[path-to-script]/usb-notify.sh\"' | sudo tee -a /etc/udev/rules.d/80-USB.rules\n\nSecond, you need to call this script with the \"service\" parameter on login. So, open the \"Startup Applications\" program and add an entry that runs \"[path-to-your-script]/usb-notify.sh service\"\nThis script can be modified to run pretty much any GUI application on udev events. If you don't want other users to be able to watch your pipe, you should probably set restrictive permissions on it.\n\nA: Do you need to call it with sudo? That might solve the problem.\nAlternatively, I found I needed DISPLAY=:0 and XAUTHORITY=/home/<user_name>/.Xauthority set for it to work when running as root (from a systemd service in this case - set with Environment=...).\n\nA: You can use pynotify instead of a shell command.

I have been looking for a while and cant seem to find out how to run a minecraft server on linux without forwarding my ports. I can forward my ports because it is blocked in my router and I would really like to run a minecraft server. Any help would be appreciated, thanks! Don’t be afraid to ask for extra info!\n\nA: You can install Hamachi for Linux (It is command line not GUI) Hamachi is a VPN but other users will need Hamachi in order to access your Minecraft server.\nDownload:\nhttps://secure.logmein.com/labs/#HamachiforLinux (Press on \"Learn More\" to reveal download links)\nHere's a video tutorial for the setup:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8OQA4HXhk4\n\nA: It is impossible to have a server accessible from outside your private network without port forwarding. Another name for it is Port Address Translation (PAT).\nAny router is capable of doing NAT/PAT, it's one of the basic core functions that make it a router.\nThe purpose of a router is to route traffic from one network to another.\nIf correctly configured it will not \"block\" traffic.\nHowever many (most?) el cheepo modems/routers provided by ISP's have a rudimentary embedded firewall. The firewall is more likely the part that is blocking traffic.\nYou will have to configure the firewall to allow access from the internet on a given port #.\nThis port# is the port# that clients use to connect to your server.\nThe router may be configured to forward (NAT/PAT) traffic from the internet arriving on that port number to another port on your server.\nThis does not have to be the exact same port number, depending on the router's quality it may even be impossible to forward using the exact same port number that you've opened up on the outside.\nAlso, Please note that most people are unaware of the fact that their (modern) (server) operating system also has a so called software firewall active.\nBy default it may be configured to block all incoming traffic from the internet.\nYou will need to allow traffic to come from the internet on the published IP/Port number \n", "Q: Xorg X server tries to delete ubuntu-desktop, help!

It can be done in the configuration of the program that dispatches logs: rsyslog.

It immediately Windows and Ubuntu options and put them in a nice menu to choose from when I boot the computer.\nHowever, I found the configuration instructions intimidating and a little beyond my grasp.\nThe first option is Windows and Windows loads if nothing is selected for 20 seconds. I would like for Ubuntu to be the default that loads if nothing is selected. Also, the first option for Ubuntu is the grub menu. There are two more options after that, that appear to be for two versions of Ubuntu.\nI would pick the first one instinctively, because it appears to be the most recent version. But my concern is, will I have to change this every time I get an updated version of Ubuntu from software updates?\nI tried changing this from efi boot manager in ubuntu terminal but it didn't change the order in refind.\n\nA: First, you can set the default boot option in rEFInd by editing the default_selection item in refind.conf (usually in the /boot/efi/EFI/refind directory in Linux). Set any relevant subset of the text that appears when you highlight the option in the menu to make it the default. In your case, default_selection vmlinuz will probably work nicely.\nSecond, the \"two versions of Ubuntu\" to which you refer are almost certainly two different Linux kernels. The kernel is not Ubuntu, but it is the core (\"kernel\") of the OS, and in a technical sense, it's the part of Ubuntu that is Linux -- it's the Linux kernel (as opposed to a FreeBSD kernel, an OS X kernel, or whatnot). In any event, rEFInd is coded in such a way that all the files within a directory are sorted by date within the rEFInd menu, with the most recent file first. Thus, when you install a new kernel package, rEFInd will automatically move it to the start of the list.\nThis sorting interacts with the default you set in that when you set a default that matches more than one entry (as vmlinuz will if you've got multiple Linux kernels), rEFInd uses the first item in the list as the default. Thus, rEFInd should normally boot the most recent kernel by default if you set default_selection vmlinuz in refind.conf. (There can be exceptions to this rule if you mess with the date stamps by using the touch command in Linux or if you install kernels in a strange order.)\nAs rEFInd's designer, I created this system to work sensibly with most Linux distributions, provided a reasonable default_selection is set. Sorting by date stamps, in particular, helps a lot with this.\n", "Q: What's equivalent of BasicTeX in Ubuntu? TeX Live is a large distribution of LaTeX.

Note I've used ; instead of newlines so that I can type it into a single line. The only construct that is new to you is the ${i%%.txt}, which simply means $i, with whatever following the %% signs cut off from the end of $i.\nA good tip: if unsure what would happen, try adding echo in front of the actual command, so that you would see the exact commands that are to be executed. E.g.:\nfor i in *.txt; do echo mv $i ${i%%.txt}; done \n\n\nA: As this web says... you can try bash String Manipulations\nYou can use two different \"operators\" inside the parameters (curly braces) ,Those are the # and the % operators for trimming patterns off the beginning or end of a string.\nYour case could be:\n\n${variable%pattern} Trim the shortest match from the end\n\nIn the Terminal would be:\nfor i in *.old\ndo \nmv $i ${i%\\.*}\ndone\n\nHere you have examples:\nGiven:\n\nfoo=/tmp/my.dir/filename.tar.gz\nWe can use these expressions:\npath = ${foo%/*}\nTo get: /tmp/my.dir (like dirname)\nfile = ${foo##*/}\nTo get: filename.tar.gz (like basename)\nbase = ${file%%.*}\nTo get: filename\next = ${file#*.}\nTo get: tar.gz\n\n\n\n${variable%pattern}\nTrim the shortest match from the end\n${variable##pattern}\nTrim the longest match from the beginning\n${variable%%pattern}\nTrim the longest match from the end\n${variable#pattern}\nTrim the shortest match from the beginning\n\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: How to remove Windows after installing Ubuntu?

I do not have the option of using Live CD or whatever.  My system does not have an optical drive and my current situation prevents me from getting one (deployed military)  How can I fix Ubuntu?\n\nA: When you reinstalled Windows, it took over your MBR with it's own boot loader.  Your Ubuntu is still fine you just need to restore GRUB so you can dual boot.  You want to use a tool called boot-repair.\nEDIT:\nWith no optical drive, your best bet is to boot a live distro via USB.

We've got an Asus X501A laptop (dec 2012) which has this UEFI thing. If I boot from an USB it only offers me to wipe the entire hard disc and install the new distro, or manual partitioning which I can't get my head around due to this UEFI thing.\n-- Note that this question has nothing to do with that other operating system named after openings in walls. Not interested in that.\n\nA: Likely because there are too many partition on the HDD. The installer does offer the \"alongside\" option, for example, if there are only two primary partitions. I suspect you may have three or four, in which case, the installer offers either wiping everything, or manual partitioning.\n\nA: If what mikewhatever says it true (namely, that Ubiquity removes \"install alongside\" if there are more than two partitions on a GPT disk), then that's a bug in the case of EFI/GPT systems. I didn't find any bug reports, but I might have entered the wrong search term. Perhaps somebody should file a bug report.\nI can say that GPT partitioning isn't any harder for the user than is MBR partitioning. To the contrary, the lack of distinction between primary, extended, and logical partitions simplifies things greatly. (Technically, there's no such thing as a \"primary partition\" in GPT; there are just \"partitions,\" with no qualifier. There can be up to 128 of them by default, although that value can be raised if necessary. Some partitioning tools insist on calling GPT partitions \"primary partitions\" because the tools were written with MBR disks in mind and then adapted for GPT disks.)\nTo partition for an EFI installation, you need:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your normal Linux partitions. Ubuntu's default is for root (/) and swap, but I personally recommend /home, as well. There's nothing unusual about setting these up on GPT vs. MBR, except for the aforementioned lack of distinction between primary, extended, and logical partitions.\n\n*An EFI System Partition (ESP), which is a FAT32 partition with a particular type code. This type code is denoted differently depending on the partitioning tool you use. In GPT fdisk (gdisk, sgdisk, and cgdisk), it's got a type code of EF00. In parted and GParted, it's got its \"boot flag\" set. (Note that in these programs, the \"boot flag\" on a GPT disk has nothing to do with a \"boot flag\" on an MBR disk.) In Ubiquity, IIRC the ESP is called an \"EFI boot partition,\" but I might be misremembering the term. The EFI specification says nothing about the size of the ESP, but I recommend making it 550MiB.\n\n\nWhen you set up your computer, you can share a single ESP between multiple OSes. If you prefer, you can create multiple ESPs, one for each OS or distribution; however, Windows tends to get confused by that, so if you plan to install Windows in the future, it's best to stick with one ESP. Be absolutely positive that you do not erase the ESP when you install a second or subsequent OS; if you do, you'll wipe out the boot loader(s) for earlier OSes. In fact, I recommend backing up the ESP after each OS installation so that you can restore it in case of an accident. A file-level backup (copying files with cp or in a file manager, or creating a tarball or .zip file) should be sufficient.\nIf you prepare your partitions ahead of time, be sure to tell Ubiquity that the ESP is the ESP. IIRC, you've got to click the \"Change\" button and tell the program to use the ESP as an \"EFI boot partition.\" If you don't do this, you may find that the boot loader doesn't install, or the program may refuse to continue; I don't recall precisely what happens.\n", "Q: During booting the following is coming \"No bootable device -- insert boot disk and press any key\" in LINUX latest Ubuntu version During booting the following is coming\n\"No bootable device -- insert boot disk and press any key\" in LINUX latest Ubuntu version \n\nA: It seems like your HardDisk is not recognized.

So one way for you to get all those packages (since you surely have the standard precise apt sources too) is:\napt-get install $(for pkg in libc6 libc-bin libc6-dev libc6-dbg; do \\\n    dpkg -s \"$pkg\" &> /dev/null && echo \"${pkg}=2.15-0ubuntu10.2\"; \\\ndone)\n\nYou might have other packages which require an exact libc6 version.\nThe changes between 2.15-0ubuntu10.2 and 2.15-0ubuntu10.4 can be found here.\nHowever, it's not at all obvious to me that you really actually need the ...10.2 version. It's more likely that whoever made your script just grabbed the version of libc6 that was current in ubuntu at the time and sent it out as \"libc-ubuntu.deb\". But the version of libc6 you already have is, in all likelihood, perfectly fine for the binaries in their package. Debian and Ubuntu package updates to stable distributions, like Precise, are extremely careful to avoid making changes to library ABIs or APIs or other documented interfaces, so if the ...10.2 version works and the ...10.4 version doesn't, that's probably a bug that Ubuntu will want to know about.

I'm really puzzled with this one...\n\nA: There are several ways of doing it.\nIn kubuntu/kde, go to directory ~/.kde4/Autostart (or more likely it is ~/.kde/Autostart) and create a symlink from /path/to/CopyAgent to ~/.kde/Autostart/CopyAgent\nI do not know about Xubuntu, but regardless of whatever the desktop environment, this can be achieved too by creating a symlink from /path/to/CopyAgent to /etc/init.d/\nThis what works for me:\n\nsudo ln -s ~/bin/copy/CopyAgent /etc/init.d/CopyAgent\n\n(you would need to modify this according to where you have your CopyAgent is installed)\nAfter a reboot, CopyAgent is running.\nAnother way to do this is by editing /etc/rc.d/boot.local and put a /path/to/CopyAgent in there.\n\nA: Do you have some symbolic link in your Copy folder? Mine was closing suddely and wasn't autostarting. Since I removed the symbolic links it started to work properly.\n\nA: For Ubuntu, the .desktop file needs to be placed in the ~/.config/autostart directory.  If that directory doesn't exist, simply create it.\n", "Q: E: The method driver /usr/lib/apt/methods/https could not be found I tried using sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https but it doesn't work for me.\nsudo apt-get update\nE: The method driver /usr/lib/apt/methods/https could not be found.\n\nsudo apt-get install apt-transport-https\n\nReading package lists...

Provided you are careful about new line characters(use Enviroment.NewLine) and path seperaters (use Path.Combine)\nMonoDevelop does have some vb.net support, but the c# support is much better, (in some cases better then visual studio). If you are serious about cross platform .net then you should consider using c# rather then vb.net.\nThis is what I have done for my project Wide Margin which uses c# and runs on linux and windows.\n\nA: To run VB programs you need the MS .NET-Framework, which only runs on Windows. To use the VS IDE, you need to install WINE (Wine) and then install Visual Studio inside WINE. I cannot promise whether you will be able to use Visual Studio properly, but it's worth a try.\n\nA: Several BASIC interpreters are mentionned in a previous thread. Those would probably handle only console-based programs.\nTo handle the Visual part, you may want to try Mono\nNote however that Visual Basic and Visual Studio are Microsoft products and therefore genetically tied to Windows' innermost core.\nTo write programs that run seamlessly in both worlds, I would suggest that you jump ship altogether and give a try at Java and Eclipse \n", "Q: After UPDATE, I get: \"no rule to build the target\" running MAKE, why?

Your expression appears to contain some features specific to the perl flavor, in particular the use of complex lookaround assertions describing the start and end of the pattern to be matched, whereas grep defaults to a basic regular expression (BRE) syntax that only supports a simpler set of these zero-length matches such as line- (^,$) and word-anchors (\\>, \\<). \nYou can enable perl-compatible regular expression (PCRE) support in grep using the -P command line switch (although note that the man page currently describes it as \"experimental\"). In your case you probably want the -o switch as well to only print the matching pattern, rather than the whole line i.e.\ncat /var/log/dpkg.log | grep 'remove' | grep -oP '(?<=remove)(.*?)(?=:)'\n\nBe aware that this expression may fail if it encounters packages that do not have the :i386 suffix since it may read ahead to a matching colon in the next word, e.g.\necho \"2013-09-07 08:31:44 remove cifs-utils 2:5.1-1ubuntu2 <none>\" | grep -oP '(?<=remove)(.*?)(?=:)'\n cifs-utils 2\n\nYou may wish to look at awk instead e.g.\ncat /var/log/dpkg.log | awk '$3 ~ /remove/ {sub(\":.*\", \"\", $4); print $4}'\n\nAs well as BRE and PCRE, Gnu grep has a further mode called extended regular expression (ERE), specified by the -E command line switch. The man page notes that\nIn  GNU grep,  there is  no difference in available functionality \nbetween basic and extended syntaxes.\n\nHowever you should note that \"no difference in available functionality\" does not mean that the syntax is the same. For example, in BRE the + character is normally treated as literal, and only becomes a modifier meaning 'one or more instance of the preceding regular expression' if escaped, i.e.\n$ echo \"123.456\" | grep '[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+'\n$ echo \"123.456\" | grep '[0-9]\\+\\.[0-9]\\+'\n123.456\n\nwhereas for ERE it is exactly the opposite\n$ echo \"123.456\" | grep -E '[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+'\n123.456\n$ echo \"123.456\" | grep -E '[0-9]\\+\\.[0-9]\\+'\n\nA similar distinction applies for sed invoked without and with the -r switch.\n\nA: From the grep man page:\n\ngrep  searches  the  named  input FILEs (or standard input if no files are named, or if a single hyphen-minus (-) is given as file name) for lines containing a match to the given PATTERN.\n\nAs far as I know, grep has no ability to edit the lines that it matches; I would use sed or possibly tr for that. Any of the following should get what you want:\ncat /var/log/dpkg.log | grep 'remove' | sed 's/.*remove \\([^:]*\\):.*/\\1/'\ncat /var/log/dpkg.log | grep 'remove' | sed -E 's/.*remove ([^:]*):.*/\\1/'\ncat /var/log/dpkg.log | sed -n '/remove/s/.*remove \\([^:]*:\\).*/\\1/p'\ncat /var/log/dpkg.log | sed -nE '/remove/s/.*remove ([^:]*):.*/\\1/p'\n\nI'm honestly not sure what your (?<=remove)(.*?)(?=:) is trying to accomplish. In regex, brackets are used to define capture groups: you can see that I've used them in the sed commands here -- in there, everything matched will be replaced by the contents of the capture group /1, the first group to be defined.\n", "Q: How To Use i18n.tr in Ubuntu Touch Projects I have been using i18n.tr for a while in my Ubuntu-Touch projects. I know what this function is about but I don't know how to add a translation to my project.\nWhere do I have to place my translation file?\nWith what name?\nHow must its content be written?\nHow should I connect it with my app?\nHow do I test it with qmlscene ? \n\nA: Take a look at TouchWriter code and especially its README, where all needed commands are given.\nQuick summary\n\n\n*\n\n*You need to bind the text domain before using gettext. In C++ you can do it like this:\nbindtextdomain(\"domainname\", \"somedir\");\ntextdomain(\"domainname\");\n\nIn Qml you can probably do something like this:\ni18n.bindtextdomain(\"domainname\", \"somedir\");\ni18n.domain = \"domainname\";\n\nBe sure to do that before 18n.tr is used.\n\n*To generate .pot template and source .po files, use these commands:\nxgettext -C --qt --keyword=tr -p somedir -o messages.pot\nmsginit -i somedir/messages.pot -o somedir/somelanguage.po\n\n(replace somedir with the directory your domain is bound to, and somelanguage with the language you want to translate to).\n\n*To generate .mo files from source .po files, use msgfmt po-file -o mo-file command.\n\n*Compiled .mo files should be placed inside a directory you bound the text domain to, more specifically in\nsomedir/somelanguage/LC_MESSAGES/domainname.mo\n\n(replace somedir, somelanguage and domainname with your values).\n\nA: The best answer seems to be in the doc. http://developer.ubuntu.com/api/ubuntu-12.10/qml/mobile/qml-ubuntu-components0-i18n.html\nIt seems to be a function that translates the word passed to the user's language.\n", "Q: SVN \"not a working copy\" Ok ... so I wanted to upload something to an SVN server. How hard can that be?\nWell, turns out I've been using windumb for too long.\nFirst I am supposed to \"clone\" the folder to my computer, using\nsvn co --username USERNAME URL\n\nAlright, so I\ncd ~/.../0.SVN\nsvn co --username USERNAME URL\n\nand get an \nsvn: OPTIONS from URL: 200 OK.\n\nNext, I create a folder ~/.../0.SVN/someFolder,\nput some files into that folder and want to add it so I can commit it.\n svn add someFolder\n\nAnd now it's giving me an\n \".\" is not a working copy\n\nAnd I have no idea what's going wrong because I'm basically doing exactly what the instructions I was given are saying.\n\nA: Suppose that the URL was http://svn.example.com/somewhere/somerepo. Then svn co http://svn.example.com/somewhere/somerepo creates a subdirectory of the current directory called somerepo. That's where the svn checkout is located.\nIf you want to add more files to the svn repository, you need to put them under that somerepo directory.\ncd somerepo\n# create someFolder and put your new stuff there\nsvn add someFolder\nsvn commit\n\nUse the command ls to see what files exist in a directory. Use ls -A to also see hidden files like the .svn subdirectory.\nUse svn info to see what svn thinks about the current directory.\n\nAll this is assuming that the checkout was successful. If you ever see this message from svn:\nsvn: OPTIONS from http://svn.example.com/somewhere/somerepo: 200 OK\n\n(or some other HTTP code: 403, 403, etc.)\nthat's subversion's way of telling you that it did not understand the response from the server. Common causes are:\n\n\n*\n\n*This is the wrong URL, the server at that URL is not a subversion server. Fix: type the correct URL.\n\n*You did not authenticate successfully. Usually you get a 403 HTTP status in that case, but some servers reply with 404 or even 200 (which is supposed to mean success, but some servers are funny that way).\n\n", "Q: Is there an fsck command for checking the entire HDD? This is probably a duplicate, but then please just link the post that answer my question.\nFsck seems to check partitions and file system, but is there a way to use a live CD, unmount (well, I guess the HDD wont be mounted anyway) the entire disc and have it checked for errors and bad sectors?\nWould fsck -n /dec/sda work? sda is the name of the entire HDD in my case, obviously.\n\nA: \nfsck\n  Runs on partitions.\n\nMy recommendation is to run\nparted /dev/sda 'print'\nThen use that to run on each filesystem/partition based from the results.\n", "Q: How to reinstall Ubuntu with a fresh start without removing files? I want to have a fresh Ubuntu start, with everything being default. But I don't want to lose files, I have lots of movies, documents etc. I don't want to remove, and I can't backup them, because they take too much space. Is it possible?\n\nA: To avoid this problem in future, consider installing Ubuntu with a / partition and a /home partition. Then, when you upgrade, you can either overwrite / or make a new / partition for your new Ubuntu, leaving the /home partition intact to be accessed from whichever version of Ubuntu you choose to fire up from the grub menu. I have used this strategy for all my Ubuntu installs on several machines, and it has enabled me to upgrade relatively painlessly on numerous occasions without losing personal data files. \nBut, I always back things up first in any case. It really is worth getting a large usb external disk to back up your /home partition or directory. You never know when your hard drive is going to go ...\n\nA: When installing Ubuntu you can use the \"side by side\" option when you are at the partitioning phase of the installation.\nIt will keep your existing ubuntu and install you a new one.\nThe side effect is that your old ubuntu will be in another partition of your hard drive. You'll have to :\n\n\n*\n\n*Resize this partition during installation in order to give space to your new ubuntu\n\n*Clean grub from the old Ubuntu\n\n*Clean the other partition (containing your old ubuntu and movies) from the unused system files.\n\n\nA: You can use the Ubuntu DVD to reinstall it then you can create a new account or - better - remove all hidden configuration files. To do this open the File manager, press CTRL + H then delete .config. You can also delete other hidden files and folders if you need to.\n\nA: I concur to Bobble's suggestion.\nBefore you reinstall Ubuntu, run the \"Try Ubuntu\" option, and perform the following steps. I don't recommend to do this to an unexperienced user without a backup! If everything goes as planned, you won't need one, but else – who knows? Borrow a sufficiently large external drive from a friend, if you can't afford one. It is always a good idea to have a backup anyway.\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount your old partition.\n\n*Delete everything except your home directory. You should now have enough space for a new installation.\n\n*Assuming a default setup, delete everything in your home directory starting with a dot except .local, .ecryptfs, .Private, i. e.:\nfind /media/old-partition/home/mrSuperEvening -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -name .\\* ! -name .local ! -name .ecryptfs ! -name .Private -exec rm -rf -- \\{\\} +\n\nYou have now deleted all user configuration. Skip this, if you still need it.\n\n*Unmount the old partition.\n\n*Resize it with GParted so that enough free space remains on the drive for a new Ubuntu installation.\n\n*Reinstall Ubuntu on a new partition in the free space and use the old partition as /home.\n\n*Your old data should now reside in /home/home/mrSuperEvening and you can move it wherever you like, i. e. to /home/mrSuperEvening.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu Phone vs Ubuntu for Android What is the difference between Ubuntu Phone and Ubuntu for Android?\n\nA: Ubuntu for Android is Ubuntu Desktop running on Android when you connect your phone to a dock. Ubuntu for phones also replaces Android.\n\nA: Ubuntu for Android enables the user to connect his mobile to a Ubuntu powered PC, and have one OS access all your data, files whilst maintaining functionality. I.e., when you connect your phone to the desktop, you'll have Ubuntu running on both the devices, and tasks like making calls, sending messages, they can all be done through the desktop environment. At the same time, all the data that you've stored on your mobile device, can now be accessed by the PC, so if you want to tweak some files, or edit documents etc, you can do it on the desktop environment and the changes will be reflected in real time. There would be no need to sync the device to the desktop and waste time. The same applies for the converse as well, if you create a document or spreadsheet( just examples, could be anything), the phone will automatically, have those documents, so when you're on the move, all the things that you need will always be with you.\nNow, when one is talking about the Ubuntu Phone, to a large extent, one is talking about the new Ubuntu Touch OS. Ubuntu Touch should be out next month with the stable release of 13.10, but the beta release is already out and you can check it out if you have a supported device. Ubuntu Touch would eventually be shipped sometime next year by manufacturers and one would be using it on everyday phones, just like it is with Android. In very plain and simple terms, Ubuntu Phone/Touch is a new operating system, developed by Canonical which would soon hit the market. \nThe major difference between the two is that while Ubuntu for Phone provides a platform for having a common OS on 2 devices when they're connected to each other to facilitate easy sharing of data, the other, Ubuntu Phone is the next big OS to hit the market. \n", "Q: How do I disable kernel messages while booting? I enabled the kernel messages a long time ago because I was playing around with Ubuntu. But now I am finished and I want to disable them again, but forgot how to.\n/etc/default/grub already contains the line:\n#GRUB_TERMINAL=console\n\n(including the hash which disables it).\n\nA: The GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT definition in /etc/default/grub should contain \"quiet splash\".  You also need Plymouth to be installed.\n\nA: Check if /etc/default/grub has the line GRUB_TERMINAL=console uncommented. Either open it with any editor, or just run this in the terminal:\ncat /etc/default/grub | grep GRUB_TERMINAL\n\nIf the output is GRUB_TERMINAL=console without a #, then open the file with sudo -H gedit /etc/default/grub, add a # at the beginning of that line and save.

As far as I know, Raspbian is based on Debian, not Ubuntu, and Debian does not yet include the Ubuntu Software Centre.\nIf you are just looking for a way to install software however, you may try Synaptic.

Never switch it on again until data is recovered. Hopefully previous data is still there, until it is overwritten. Obviously, you'll need another computer into which you'll mount your damaged HD in read-only mode. Alternatively, you'll need a new hard drive in the same computer, that you'll set as the boot drive, still mounting the damaged HD as secondary, read-only. Yet another alternative would be to boot in a live USB-stick, itself partitioned to allow some persistent data.\nNow for the hardest part : you absolutely need the previous partition map. Start sector, end sector and exact size of each partition. If you wrote this down somewhere, or have an exceptional memory, you can proceed. If no, skip to \"forensics\" below.\nSo say you know the previous partition map. Just partion (e.g. with gparted) anew as it was before, format the partitions as NTFS and you may find your data exactly as it was, with the exception of some files which were overwritten while installing and running Ubuntu. It happened to me once, it was quite mesmerizing. Now, I had it easier as I had only one partition, so the previous partition map was straightforward.\nAbsent previous partition map, skip into forensics mode.

That's why you don't have permission. When it 'froze', it was not 'frozen' - just your screen probably. The hard reboot corrupted the root.disk most likely.\nSo, two things. First with linux you can often safely reboot even if the screen is frozen via some special keys that the kernel responds to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_SysRq_key\nThat would have avoided the problem in the first place.\nThe second thing is that it likely froze due to some hardware incompatibility. Commonly this is that your graphics driver isn't adequately supported by the open source drivers installed by default with Ubuntu. So you should boot with nomodeset and install closed source drivers instead. It could be something else, e.g. wireless card, as well, so it's a good idea to research your computer's specs via Google (w/Ubuntu).\nFinally, to fix the problem you have now, you will need to run chkdsk /f from Windows. You can either run it from a repair command prompt (booting from a repair CD) or you can request it from the drive tools menu - since it's on C:\\ you need to reboot to complete it. After that you should be able to remove the C:\\ubuntu directory.\nThis answer shows how to run chkdsk (but it's written from the perspective of recovering a Wubi install, not removing it). Note that when chkdsk fixes the corruption it could place the whole root.disk in the hidden \\found.000 directories so you might need to find these are remove them to recover all your disk space.\n", "Q: Why Tor cannot access /usr/bin/tor-browser/Data/Tor?

This partition is on my SATA HDD and I aḿ only modifying the end of the partition in order to put my new Ubuntu after it.\nShould I just keep waiting or is there anything else I can do to speed up or cancel (without data loss) the process?\n\nEDIT:\nGparted is still running, here's the current state from top:\n\n15773 - root - 20 - 0 - 454m - 25m - 19m - R - 1,7 - 0,2 - 44:14.40 gpartedbin\n\nSo it looks to me it's still doing something isn't it? What's worrying me (but I'm surely mistaken there) is that glances doesn't notice anything happening on the HDD (IN and OUT) and there are those A_DENY on the gpartedbin line for the columns IO_R and IO_W (respectively read and write I guess?).\n\nA: So, after waiting for almost 50 hours on this I just gave up and decided to cancel the shrinking operation even though that could have meant data loss.\nOnce the operation was cancelled GParted couldn't recognize properly the Windows 8 partition, so I tried to use GParted to recover it. Without success.\nThat's when I decided to go for PhotoRec and TestDisk and I was surprised when TestDisk couldn't detect any errors on my partitions (even with the deeper search feature) and even better than that I was able to see that all my files and folders where intact on my W8 partition!\nThat's when I decided to give it a go and reboot it, but unfortunately (and as expect I should say) my W8 mbr was broken, so I used my W7 recover disk (I upgraded from W7 to W8 via downloading from Microsoft) to boot and run from the command line tool Bootrec.exe /fixmbr and voila! All my data was still there and my W8 was repaired (first thing I did was running a check disk that found no error).\nTo get back onto the Ubuntu subject, I decided to shrink the W8 partition from Windows this time, so after a few defragmentation runs and use of MyDefrag (to get the data at the beginning of my disk when possible) I was able to shrink my W8 partition enough to make space for my Ubuntu install.\nTo conclude I think that in my case GParted really was hanging (for nothing) as no data has been lost from my W8 partition, and althought that took me a few days to repair I feel lucky that cancelling the shrinking didn't do any damage for me.\nWhat I do recommend though is that if you want to shrink your Windows partition before installing ubuntu (or any other OS) next to it, use the windows tool for that (diskmgmt.msc).\n\nA: A 25-hour resize operation is definitely on the long side, bordering on excessive. It's entirely possible that the program has hung, in which case you should be prepared to restore from backups. (You should ALWAYS back up important data before performing a partition resize operation.) OTOH, it's possible that your disk just has data laid out in a way that's causing GParted to work slowly. If that's the case, the program will eventually finish and everything will be OK. It's hard to tell which of these is the case. If disk activity has completely stopped, though, I'd favor the \"hung\" hypothesis. If disk activity is ongoing, it could be either situation. Likewise for CPU load. (Type top in a Terminal window to see a dynamically-updated list of the programs that are using the most CPU time.)\nUnfortunately, there's really no way to stop an ongoing partition-resize operation in a safe way. If the program has hung, you'll have to either restore your data from backups or spend a lot of time (with PhotoRec or something similar) and/or money (on a data-recovery specialist) recovering the data.\nI recommend giving it another day or so. If it's still not finished by then, the odds of it ever completing are pretty low. There's no hard-and-fast cutoff point, though -- or if there is, I don't know what it is, and it would vary depending on disk size, disk speed, and other factors.\n\nA: Just wait.  The delay is not that it's \"hanging\" but rather that it's doing work.\nThe system will test-run the shrinking/moving of the partition first.  That takes time.  When it actually resizes and moves the data, that also takes time.  As well, when do you this resize, Windows may actually yell at you.\n\nA: It truly can take very long. I am shrinking currently a 171GB partition down to 100 GB. After running over the whole night, it still is at 62% in simulating.\n", "Q: Disable CUDA run time limit on kernels I am using Ubuntu 12.10 with CUDA 5.5 installed on a laptop which have an Optimus compatible GPU.

I will be thankful to you.\n\nA: When installing Ubuntu, it will ask you if it needs to partition the drive for you. This would be the easiest way to proceed.\n\nIf you want to partition your drive manually, you will need at least two partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*One (or more) Ext4 partition: This will be the location for the Ubuntu system itself. Make sure you set the mount point to / (root). Official documentation. \n\n*One Swap partition: Used as virtual memory. Also used for storing your memory when going into hibernate mode.

An asterisk simply identifies a boot entry that's active, vs. one that's inactive. The man page for efibootmgr isn't exactly clear about what that means, but my guess is that an inactive entry won't be booted even if it appears in the BootOrder list. Other than that, your command is correct; you'd type sudo efibootmgr -b E -B to remove the Boot000E entry.\nIn fact, the boot numbers are all numbers -- they're just hexadecimal numbers (base 16, hence digits 0 to F rather than 0 to 9). See the Wikipedia article on hexadecimal if you're unfamiliar with it.\n\nA: I have also been looking to these solution to remove fedora entry from the EFI menu but somehow the EFI entry just refused to deleted by any of the method.

Then delete the folder named z:\\EFI\\fedora from the partition using the del command.  This is prevent loading the boot entry every time you restart your machine. Now go to the command prompt and remove the boot entry for fedora as given in the post http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc721886(v=ws.10).aspx. Here all it asks you is to find the identifier corresponding to fedora and removing it.

Can someone tell me how to share files betwen the two? Because I know absolutely nothing of networks. Thanks to those who respond.\n\nA: What do you mean by \"sharing\"?\nIf you just want to download a small number of files from one computer to another, you can run python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer 8001 in the directory of the files to be shared on one computer. Then on another computer, use your browser (or other tools like wget) to navigate to the url http://x.x.x.x:8001/ to view/download the files. x.x.x.x is to be replaced by the IP address of the former computer.\nIf you have a large number of files to copy, I suggest rsync though ssh. But it works well if you have ssh server up and running at least one computer.\nIf you want more complicated sharing, you may want to try NFS or sshfs.\n\nA: On nautilus you can right click the folder and choose share options.

Changes in any one are reflected across all, data being exchanged/synchronized at any time the two (or more) machines are online at the same time.

With Ubuntu I am not sure if this is possible. I have a desktop that is hard wired to the wall and gets its online connection from there. I also have a wireless card installed and working. I would like to be able to share the connection to be online from the wired connection with other devices. Please help, thank you\n\nA: There seems to be a very simple method using just networkmanager, the default network configuration tool (I'm not at a Ubuntu machine atm, so I can't check if this still applies).\nIf you need more advanced connection sharing, probably all information you need for this can be found on the Wiki page on Router setup. In order for Wireless to work as described on that page, your card either needs to support master mode, work in an Ad-Hoc network or connect to an already existing wireless access point.\nIf this is not enough information, keywords that might help you search relevant guides on the net are \"masquerading\", \"network address translation\", \"NAT\".\n\nA: Use networkmanager from network menu for one-time connections or hostapd with config at /etc/ for permanent access point.\nNetworkmanager setups adhoc, wep, dhcp and nat by few clicks.\nWith hostapd you need to make it all by hand.\n\nA: I did a quick search via google and turned up a number of hits, follow the link below.\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=turn+linux+into+wifi+router&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8\nThe prevailing method seems to be to set up an 'as hoc' network, but the security isn't good (from reading the posts).\nI suspect that a better way would be to set up you PC as a full dhcp server, but I haven't found any links for using the WiFi card as part of it. It could be this is automatic and hence no further details are required! I'll keep searching and post a link... When I find one.\nOK found the following on the Ubuntu wiki.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessAccessPoint\nNote that it uses a PC with 2 WiFi cards, this is because it needs one to communicate to the main network (this would be equivalent to your wired connection), and the other is used to relay data to other devices.\nFollow the tutorial, and see how you go. If you get stuck post a new question.

On their mailing list there was a discussion on security updates for Drupal, in August 2014. One answer worth reading contained \"This is a fundamental difference between main and universe\" and \"users can always opt to not install universe packages\". So if this information is correct it pretty much answers your question, I would say.\nProbably Debian has faster security updates over its whole set of packages, than Ubuntu has over it's Universe branch... so you might consider using that distribution instead, if you need (server) programs not included in Ubuntu \"Main\".\n", "Q: How do I start a Skype call from terminal? is there a way to start a Skype call from the terminal?\nI have found skype4py, but it doesn't work on ubuntu 12.04.

Technically it runs a server on the host (remote server), as long as the daemon does NOT die, all session information will be preserved.\n\nNOTE: if you get disconnected, just ssh to the server again and run tmux attach -t <target-session> to get back to the sessions.

Even though I only have 1 OS? Should I move forward? WIN7/UBU 12.04 I am at a slight problem right now, and I have searched keywords on this forum, but I don't find anyone with the exact concern. While trying install 12.04 Lts on my machine as a dual boot option, ubuntu still says that I have multiple operating systems on it. It gives me the option to install alongside \"THEM\" (as opposed to install alongside Windows 7)\nMy NTSF reads as\nSDA/1 SYSTEM 1.46 gib\n500 used\n999 unused\nboot, diag\nsda/2 is C:\nSDA/3 HDDRECOVERY\n13 gib total\n13.15 used\nHIDDEN\nMy concern is, Do I delete one of these partitions even though they are being Used? Do I shrink C: ? Or do I just move forward with \"Install alongside them\"?\n\nA: You can choose to \"Install alongside them\" safely.\nThe problem is that Ubuntu detects not only your Windows partition, but another partition (sda3) that it thinks contains an operating system. Actually, it contains a recovery utility installed by the PC manufacturer. The benefit from recovery partitions is that they are usually used for returning your laptop to \"factory conditions\", which means all pre-installed software and drivers will be taken care of; it restores the laptop to the state you bought it in. In my opinion, the \"drivers\" is the important part in recovery, but you can usually get those online from the vendor's website.\nSo, if you don't want the partition, it is safe to delete it. If you do keep it and install Ubuntu alongside Windows and it, you will probably find more than one \"Windows\" entry in your boot options later on, and selecting the option that points to that recovery partition will fail. \nI recommend deleting the HDDRECOVERY partition (sda3) and moving forward, unless you need an easy way to recover the Windows operating system at some later date. You should not, however, delete sda1. Windows needs that to boot!\nIf you delete the partition and leave it as unallocated, the Install Ubuntu alongside Windows option will instruct Ubuntu to install itself in that unallocated space (that's how its designed; it looks for unallocated space, assuming that the user intentionally left that space for Ubuntu). You won't be prompted to set a size for the installation or choose a partition; it'll just use that unallocated space. If you want to specify a size for Ubuntu (let's say, you want more than 13.75 GB), then stretch the C drive to fill the unallocated space so there's no unallocated space left. Then, when you pick the install alongside option, it will give you a GUI prompt (a slider) to choose how big you want Ubuntu to be. You can do it the other way round too: shrink the C drive to have more unallocated space, and then choose the \"install alongside\" option, which will use all that unallocated space. I suggest doing it this way, but all of these options should work. \n", "Q: 13.04 GPU not playing nice with youtube I am having issueswith watching YouTube videos on my laptop.\nMy specs are:\ncore 2 duo 2.3GHz\nNvidia 240M (old card)\n4GB of Ram\nThe problem is that the video looks weird.

But as I try to transfer them to my flash drive, it occasionally comes up with an error message which, when I view details, says:\n\nError splicing file: Input/output error.\n\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: The problem is because your destination disk (the disk to which you want to copy the file) is formatted with FAT32 (which has a file size limit of about 4GB.\nThe solution is to format your destination disk to EXT3, EXT4, or NTFS (if you need windows compatibility).\n\nA: I would say that since the hard disk is failing, there is no way to solve the error. Depending on what is wrong with the hard disk, you may be able to try copying a file several times and maybe eventually get it correct. It would be advisable to move as quickly as possible and make sure to get your most important files first, because your hard disk may be getting worse and worse.\nSorry for the bad prognosis.\n\nA: make sure your flash drive is in NTFS instead of FAT32..\nthen try copying the file over and over, as you can see an option asking if you want to replace the existing file on the flash drive saying \"do you want to replace the existing file (e.g. pic001 size: 100KB) with (e.g. pic001 10.1MB)?\" those two files are just the same but as you can see with a different file size . choose replace..\nnow go back to the folder of origin of those files now one by one determine their original file size and do the previous steps over and over again until those copied files have the file size the same as the original ones..\nthat worked for me well, it will take time though..\nhope that helps\n\nA: I feel this answer should be here for anyone who are experience failing disks.\nThe best way to approach a disk that is failing is to detach it carefully from power source and give it to the expensive guys. If you are impatient or feeling lucky, the next best thing is to create a copy of it on block level like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from live CD\n\n*Create a mounting point:\nmkdir /mnt/mybigdisk\n\n*Mount another big disk that has space for a single file that is the full size of the entire broken disk:\nmount /dev/mybigdisk /mnt/mybigdisk\n\n*While the broken disk is NOT mounted, copy the partition(s) you want to keep  like this:\ncat /dev/broken_partition1 > /mnt/mybigdisk/part1\n\n*Un-mount and shutdown, removing broken disk (it should be kept un-attached and not rattled about for safe keeping).\n\n*Boot into your favorite OS and mount your big disk again:\nmount /dev/mybigdisk /mnt/mybigdisk\n\n*Create a mounting point for where you want to try to mount the copy of bad partition:\n/mnt/my_broken_partition_copy\n\n*Proceed to mount the copy of the broken partition from file using loop device like so:\nmount -o loop /mnt/mybigdisk/part1 /mnt/my_broken_partition_copy\nNOTE: If the file-system is too damaged, you may not be able to mount without repairing it.\nNOTE: If you want to keep the whole disk, or if partition table is screwed, you can also do this on the entire disk. Just swap out /dev/broken_partition1 with /dev/broken_disk1 in instructions above (and mounting the loop device will be a little more complicated after).\nNOTE: Even if the file-system is completely broken, you can still dig out data from this block-level copy using all kinds of un-delete/forensics software. Here is a list. That is why it is a good way to go about.\nWhy is this the next best thing?\nMencahical disks (I am assuming your disk is mechanical, if not it would porbably just not work at all) have a tiny arm inside that moves around to read the data from your disk. If it is somehow broken, then moving this arm might have adverse effects.\nThe least amount of movement is to read simply the whole disk linearly. That way the arm does not need to bounce around looking for blocks in random order.\nAlso, in case some areas are \"more broken\" than others, relying on the metadata of the file-system will not work. It will just retry, fail or do other things that may have adverse effects (move around the arm a lot).\nThings to remember:\n\n\n*\n\n*You should not mount broken disk as it risks breaking the file system. If you MUST mount them, at least mount read-only.\n\n*Keep broken disks attached to power as little as possible. Keep disk completely still, any sudden movement may make it worse.\n\n*If it starts making bad noises, detach from power immediately.\n\n\nI hope this is useful.\n\nA: I was getting the same error messages. In my case not the disk was defect, nor the partition was wrong, etc. \nThe error in my case was a USB-3.0-Plug on the front panel of my PC-case which probably did not follow the specifications. (I think I should install a USB 3.0 frontpanel from a different vendor/make.)\nAs soon I connected the external HDD via the USB-3.0-Plug on the motherboard (backside of the PC case), things went fine!\nIn addition: Pay attention to Wireless/WLAN antennas in direct neighborhood to USB-3.0-Plug/Cables! Things are not so \"discrete\" with USB-3.0 than it have been with USB-2.0 ;-)\n\nA: There might be another option..\nI have the same error when copying small files (1MB) from my NAS to a local Seagate HDD drive. The smartctl tool says the drive is OK, but details show its quite aged and some values are in pre-fail. I had these errors before, then there were absent.\nHowever, interestingly I found that I could copy all files without any error using the command line with \"cp file1 /home/$USER/temp\". Doing the same with the file manager consistently gave the splicing error.\nAlthough I agree its a wise move to swap the HDD for a new one, I think that there might be another reason behind this...\n", "Q: need help putting ubuntu on a usb it has 2g of free space need help putting ubuntu on a usb I dont see any options to download ubuntu onto a usb it just says desktop, server, or cloud dont know which one is for usb's help please thnks\n\nA: Use Lilyusb at http://www.linuxliveusb.com/\nyou can read the instruction at there\nfor make usb linux key, just decide the OS you want.\nIf you want to make linux key running on Ubuntu 12.04...download its ISO\n", "Q: What determines ethernet port name? I have two computers which are supposed to be identical hardware.  However on one machine, the ethernet port shows up as \"eth1\" whereas on the other it appears as \"eth2\".\nI am trying to manage an Ubuntu image to work on both of these machines, but the /etc/network/interfaces config file needs to be configured differently on each.\nOne solution would be to just put both ethernet port names in the config file.  This works, in that it gives me an ethernet connection, but having an incorrect port in the config file causes a long delay (>1minute) in the failsafe boot delay upstart job.\nIs there some way I can let it detect which port to use automatically?\n\nA: The system stores persistent device names in /etc/udev/rules.d/. The culprit is probably a file in that directory named 70-persistent-net.rules. I think you can simply rename the port on one of your machines, rename any conflicts, reload the scripts, restart networking... or, you know, reboot.\n", "Q: Upgrading Ubuntu 12.10 to 13.04 using bootable USB alongside Windows 7 How do I upgrade Ubuntu 12.10 to Ubuntu 13.04 using a bootable USB? S\nI have a laptop, this is dual boot, Ubuntu 12.10 and Windows 7. I want to upgrade to 13.04 using bootable USB. \n\nA: I wrote this as a technical document on April 25th, 2008; I just used this exact method to install Ubuntu 13.04 on a WD external USB 2 TB harddrive and it worked flawlessly. I will give you this one piece of advice... **\n\nfollow this to the letter and it will work for you and if you do not I\n  am not responsible for the end result\n\n**.\nThe topic of a bootable external USB Linux hard drive (without dual-boot) is an area that is not well documented. A simple Google search shows many articles, blogs and forum posts written on this topic, all of them discuss setting up dual-boot strategies. While I did not specifically test a USB Thumb Drive and did not intend to address this device in this article, I see no reason why this would not work for Thumb Drives as well. This article was written with the goal of defining an alternative to the traditional dual boot concept and keeping each operating system isolated from each other.\nWhile the dual-boot scenario works, this can cause undesirable issues when grub installs its files on the external drive. Should Grub install its files to the external drive, the drive must be connected before booting the computer or you will receive a Grub 17or 21 error. Based on the testing I have done in an effort to achieve the desired results, I did not want a dual-boot on either the laptops operating system (internal hard drive) or on the external USB drive.\nThis document applies to all Linux distributions that I have tried since writing the original document in 2008. You will want to use laptop or desktop hardware in which the BIOS supports booting to a USB device.\nWhy would you want to do this?\nSmall foot print USB powered external drives are very obtainable and affordable. These drives come in various sizes with the most common and cost effective today being 250GB. This gives you the ability to:\nTest new OS versions\nCarry multiple working OS’s with you in the field\nLab issues in the field\nTest patches\nPerform demonstrations\n\nAll of the above and more without risking the OS installed in your laptop or desktop. While this solution may not be right for everyone; this will provide you with more options.\nThere are several ways to achieve the results described herein; I will describe two of these methods and you can choose which method works better for your scenario.\nMethod 1:\nInsert the Linux OS Install CD/DVD\nReboot the computer\nEnter the “Setup Menu”\nDisable the internal hard drive\nSave settings and exit\nThe computer will reboot so you can see the Post Screen\nPush the appropriate key (F12 for Dell Laptops) to bring up the “One Time Boot Menu”\nSelect boot from CD/DVD\nInstall Linux OS (Follow your normal install procedure)\nThe only device that should appear is the external USB drive\n\nNote: Since the internal hard drive is disabled the Linux OS will have no choice, it will install all of the required components for the external USB drive to become a bootable device.\nWhen the install has completed:\nRemove the Linux OS Install CD/DVD\nReboot the computer\nEnter the “Setup Menu”\nEnable the internal hard drive\nChange the boot order to resemble\n    USB Device\n    Internal Hard drive\n    CD/DVD\nSave settings and exit\nThe computer will reboot so you can see the Post Screen (Let the system boot as normal)\n\nThe machine will boot into your newly installed Linux OS and will have no knowledge or connection to the OS that is installed on the computers internal hard drive.\nMethod 2:\nInsert the Linux OS Install CD/DVD\nShout down the computer\nRemove the internal hard drive\nStart the computer\nThe computer will boot so you can see the Post Screen\nPush the appropriate key (F12 for Dell Laptops) to bring up the “One Time Boot Menu”\nSelect boot from CD/DVD\nInstall Linux OS (Follow your normal install procedure)\nThe only device that should appear is the external USB drive\n\nNote: Since the internal hard drive was physically removed the Linux OS will have no choice, it will install all of the required components for the external USB drive to become a bootable device.\nWhen the install has completed:\nRemove the Linux OS Install CD/DVD\nShut down the computer\nInstall internal hard drive\nEnter the “Setup Menu”\nChange the boot order to resemble\n    USB Device\n    Internal Hard drive\n    CD/DVD\nSave settings and exit\nThe computer will reboot so you can see the Post Screen (Let the system boot as normal)\n\nThe machine will boot into your newly installed Linux OS and will have no knowledge or connection to the OS that is installed on the computers internal hard drive.\nIssue:\nDuring one of my tests, after all of the above steps were completed Linux on the USB External Hard drive would not boot. The computer did not see the device as a bootable device therefore the machine booted to the OS installed on the internal hard drive.\nSolution:\nPlug the external USB device into the USB port on the computer\nPlace the Linux install CD/DVD in the CD/DVD drive on the computer\nThe computer will boot so you can see the Post Screen\nPush the appropriate key (F12 for Dell Laptops) to bring up the “One Time Boot Menu”\nSelect boot from CD/DVD\nThe main install screen will give you the option to repair the Installed OS (during my tests this did not have any unwanted effects on the computers internal hard drive or the OS installed on it)\nOnce the repair is completed remove the CD/DVD from the CD/DVD drive\nReboot the computer\n\nThe computer should boot to the OS installed on the external USB drive without issue. However you need to understand the BIOS in your machine; I would suggest removing any USB devices except for the hard drive before booting the computer.\n", "Q: dual boot problems, grub 2 fails to install I have a laptop with a pre installed Windows 8.

I am working with an application using a touch screen. For this, I need Onboard (the on-screen keyboard) to open from Ubuntu's startup time with a fixed width and height. I also need to get a reserved screen position for placing Onboard (which means that Onboard should not be in front of any application windows).\nI'm using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\nOnboard was not installed in my system. I installed it by typing sudo apt-get install onboard in the terminal. It doesn't work properly. Now the system shows Onboard when I type onboard in the terminal.

So, I've tried to create a wireless-wired-bridge with my notebook, which doesn't work, because bridges can only include eth interfaces or wireless interfaces in master mode.\n------------  wireless   ----------  wired  ----------\n|dsl router|  )))   (((  |notebook|  -----  |receiver|\n------------             ----------         ----------\n                      wlan0       eth0\n\nReceiving multicast on my notebook via wireless interface wlan0 is working fine (signalled with igmpv2 !). When I add a virtual route to 224.0.0.0/4 via eth0, the application (vlc media player) is trying to join multicast groups by signalling with igmpv3 (I am following traffic flows with wireshark). Can that be a problem for forwarding multicast packets later?\nThe second receiver is directly connected to my notebook. It doesn't matter, whether I realize this by native routing or by nat'ing the traffic going out on wlan0: Unicast is working fine, but multicast is not forwarded. DHCP server is running on notebook and routing directive to the new subnet is also added on the dsl router. I also tried adding multicast routes on the notebook (224.0.0.0/4 via dev eth0 and/or via wlan0) but I did not have success.\nThe easiest solution would be getting some powerline adapter which support igmpv3 and multicasting, but I'd like to get this stuff working with the notebook as a router, because later this part should be played by a raspberry pi.\nIs it possible to forward multicast packets on linux? Which rules are neccessary=\nCan I realize the eth bridge with managed wlan0 without compiling my own kernel version?\nThanks in advance\nErik\n\nA: I got a working solution for the environment mentioned above.\nOn the bridge notebook, which is connected to the internet via wlan0 (192.168.2.0/24) and to the new subnet via eth0 (192.168.28.0/24), I installed everything to make it work as a router. For that reason I added a static route in my dsl router to the new subnet via the laptop. If this is not possible, you can also apply a NAT rule on the bridge with iptables:\nsudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o wlan0 -s 192.168.28.0/24 -j MASQUERADE\n\nAfterwards, I downloaded igmpproxy from http://sourceforge.net/projects/igmpproxy/ and installed it (install documentation is included in the README file). This little tool (recent version is 0.1) works with IGMPv1 and v2, so I forced the bridge to use v2 with:\nsudo sh -c 'echo 2 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/wlan0/force_igmp_version'\nsudo sh -c 'echo 2 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth0/force_igmp_version'\n\nNow, you need to know the network of possible source ip addresses of the multicast streams. In my case the network is 193.0.0.0/8. I created a config file with this content:\nquickleave\nphyint eth0 downstream  ratelimit 0  threshold 1\nphyint wlan0 upstream ratelimit 0 threshold 1\n  altnet 192.168.2.0/24 # for local services\n  altnet 193.0.0.0/8    # for multicast video streams\n\nigmpproxy can be started using:\nsudo igmpproxy -d -vv <config_file_name>\n\nI hope, you can understand everything I was writing about.\nEnjoy it.\n", "Q: The convenience Win+R/Run command How can I achieve the convenience the Win+r, more widely known as Run command, provides in Windows, in Ubuntu?\nE.g.:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to path\n\n*Open a file in default application\n\n\nA: You can run achieve most of the things by using Alt+F2 command.  You can run commands directly without opening the terminal.

It maintains the history and starts searching it the moment you start typing.\nTo install: sudo apt-get install grun\nTo launch: grun\nTo make it a drop-in replacement, you can configure a hotkey Win - R to launch grun.\n\nA: The actual key combination can usually be configured, but on many Linux Desktop Environments, including Ubuntu Unity, ALT + F2 opens the \"run\" command.\n", "Q: How to prevent my screens from turning off, when the screen is locked?

Please give me the necessary commands to be typed in Terminal to install it .\n\nA: In the general case (I am not specifically referring to Prozilla), a file with a .tar.gz extension will contain the source code for the application.  This means you will need to compile and install the application.  Instructions for doing this are usually included in a README or INSTALL file in the archive, or on the web site of the author of the software.\nFor a newcomer I would advise against installing software from source.  It usually is a hassle, if you get it to work at all.  If you're unlucky, it will destabilise your system, or break upgrades.  If the software is any good, then the odds are high that someone has packaged it already for Debian / Ubuntu.  Prefer the packages you find through the package manager.\n\nA: By default, Ubuntu does not come with the tools required. You need to install the package build-essential for making the package and checkinstall for putting it into your package manager. These can be found on the install CD or in the repositories, searching in Synaptic Package Manager or the command-line apt-get:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential checkinstall\n\nNow open the terminal and change to directory of the extracted files where the source is there.(it should be named as SRC mostly ) by using\ncd path/to/source\nNow type\n./configure\nAfter that type:\nmake\nNow type:\nmake install\nThat should install your program.  \n", "Q: Disable second screen on the login screen but enable once login has completed I currently run Ubuntu 13.04.

Is there a ppa for org-mode?\nI'm using ubuntu 12.04.\nIf not, can I install the latest stable version of org-mode for Emacs manually?\n\nA: This does maybe not apply to 12.04 anymore (I think it does though). The easiest version by now (Using ubuntu 14.04.2) is:\nsudo apt-get install emacs24\n\nThen, inside of emacs, use the package manager:\nM-x package-list-packages\n\nSearch (C-s) \"org\", there may be a few entries but the one with the date is the newest (as of now 20150413). Mark it for installation with I, install with x.\nRestart emacs, done.\n\nA: To install the latest, make sure that Emacs is installed on your machine.  \nIf not, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo apt-get install emacs23\n\nOnce the installation is done. download the latest org-mode from Ubuntu Updates.  Once downloaded, from terminal navigate to where the file was downloaded (probably the Downloads folder), and run the command below:\nsudo dpkg -i <file_name>.deb\n\nAnd that will install the latest stable version of org-mode 7.8.02-1\n\nA: Here is a solution that uses the latest source code, borrowed from two Emacs StackExchange threads (here and here).\nRun this in a shell:\ncd ~/src/  # or any other location\ngit clone https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/org-mode.git\ncd org-mode/\nmake autoloads\n\nThen run this Emacs-LISP code before any other org code in your initialization files:\n(add-to-list 'load-path \"~/src/org-mode/lisp\")\n(require 'org-loaddefs)\n\nSee this answer for details on why you need the second line and in that order to avoid a mixed installation of built-in and latest versions:\n\nThe main idea is that you need to make sure that Org mode is set up,\n  using the new bits that you downloaded only. Emacs comes with a\n  version of Org mode bundled up with it, but that is inevitably older\n  than what is available from the Org mode git repo. It is important to\n  avoid loading any piece from the bundled up version or else you might\n  end up with a \"mixed\" installation (there are many hits for that on\n  the Org mode mailing list).\nAs I mention in a comment, and @Tobias has verified in another\n  comment, you do not need to byte-compile the new version - you only\n  need to make autoloads. That creates an org-loaddefs.el file, so that\n  all the common entry points into org will, when first invoked, load\n  the appropriate file first. It is important (and contrary to what the\n  OP states in his comment) to set the load-path before loading the\n  org-loaddefs.el file: otherwise, you may end up with the dreaded\n  \"mixed\" install I mentioned above.\n\n", "Q: Making a service from the project Hi I have a java server(it listens) which runs when I do:\nant compile jar run in the terminal\nWhat I want to do is\nsudo service myproject start so that I won't have to be in terminal(when I do ctrl+c in terminal or close the terminal the program stops which I don't want)\nHow can I do that?\n\nA: Use Apache Commons Daemon and JSVC: http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-daemon/\nIt is the solution which is also used by the most common Java daemon: Apache Tomcat.\n\nA: One approach would be to nohup the command.

I want to install Ubuntu alongside Windows 8.\nSteps I followed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disabled Fast-Startup\n\n*Disabled Secure Boot\n\n*Inserted Ubuntu Live DVD\n\n*Reboot\nRESULT:\nWindows 8 loads without detecting the DVD\nI checked this link: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI\nBut all the solutions it showed are after the DVD has been detected.\nMy problem is my computer is not detecting the DVD as long as the UEFI mode is enabled. It only detects the DVD in LEGACY mode. If I install Ubuntu in Legacy mode, it works but then Windows 8 doesn't load.\nPlease HELP!\n\nA: A possible solution may be to install Ubuntu via USB.\nThere is a guide in the official page: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows\nThe software you need is Universal USB Installer and a 1GB at least, Flash Drive.\nThen when you boot you have too choose your USB or change from bios the boot order settings. Also note that there is a button almost in every computer that at boot will popup  a list of bootable devices.\n\nA: George Sofianos has presented a good suggestion. Three more:\nFiddle with the firmware\nYou can play with your firmware options. In particular, look for any that refer to BIOS, CSM, or legacy support, and disable them. There might also be a \"boot mode\" setting with options like \"UEFI only\" and \"UEFI and legacy.\" If you see such an option, set it to \"UEFI only.\" This should prevent the computer from booting the DVD in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode.\nUse rEFInd\nYou could prepare a USB flash drive with my rEFInd boot manager (there's a download link for a USB flash drive image). Boot it with the Ubuntu CD/DVD in the drive and rEFInd should present an option to boot the Ubuntu disc. By default, this option will boot the Ubuntu disc in EFI mode.\nInstall in BIOS mode, then switch to EFI mode\nYou can go ahead with a BIOS-mode installation and then switch to EFI-mode booting by installing a suitable EFI-mode boot loader for Linux. My Web page on EFI boot loaders describes the options. Although Ubuntu uses GRUB 2 for this purpose, it's likely to be easier and safer to use something else, such as rEFInd or GRUB Legacy, since this won't disrupt the action of the BIOS version of GRUB 2, so you should still be able to switch modes by using the firmware's built-in boot manager or adjusting firmware options.\nNote that some EFIs use obscure and undocumented details to determine the boot mode. Thus, you might need to experiment to get the system to switch from a BIOS-mode to an EFI-mode boot after installing your EFI-mode boot loader. Checking the firmware settings is the way to start with this. If you find that you're stuck in a BIOS-mode boot, post back with a link to the RESULTS.txt file generated by the Boot Info Script.\n", "Q: Windows does not appear in the GRUB list I have Ubuntu 13.04 and I want to add Win7. My problem is that the win7 disk is not recognized or not loaded after I restart, so I cant even start the installation. The grub gives me the usual suggestions about loading Ubuntu or running memory tests.\nI've seen some text that says that I should install win7 before Ubuntu. \nMy Qs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do I have to uninstall Ubuntu first?\n\n*Can I ask the Grub to load the win7 installer?\n\n*In case I need to remove the ubuntu first, does deleting all the\npartitions from the HD is enough or should I use OS-installer from\nliveCD etc?\nfor your time\nTamir\n\nA: Please allow me to confirm - did you set up cd-rom drive as your first boot device in BIOS? This should launch directly to Windows installer.\\\nPlease keep in mind that installing Windows after ubuntu will overwrite grub with default windows launcher, that would need corrected then. Also it's a good idea not to use the partition with Ubuntu to install Windows on it, as Ubuntu will got purged that way...\nAssuming you proceed with the Windows installation then, you would need to reinstall grub to regain access to Ubuntu system and grub itself.\nSome space might be needed at the beginning of the disk for grub to work though, so Windows can't be set up on the very beginning, I'd recommend leaving at least 16 MB of free data for boot record during Windows setting up.\n", "Q: playstation3 via hdmi input on ubuntu audio issue I have an AlienWare m17xr3 laptop with switchable Radeon HD6990 and HDMI input.\nWhen I connect a playstation 3 everything works fine, but there is no sound.\nHas anyone any idea why there is no sound or how to fix it?\n\nA: \"Pulse Audio Volume Control\" Application may be your answer or may not. \nDownload it from Software Center and then check the devices under Input Devices Tab.\n", "Q: tmux - unable to start any gui application I am running Ubuntu-gnome 13.04. My default shell is zsh 5.0.0 and I usually run tmux 1.7 in the terminal 3.6.1.\nIn terminal, if I evince or gedit, the applications start as expected.

The thread here: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=167029\nPointed me to https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Tmux#Tips_and_tricks\nwhere adding the following to my ~/.bashrc file before the aliases fixed the problem.\n# If not running interactively, do not do anything\n[[ $- != *i* ]] && return\n[[ -z \"$TMUX\" ]] && exec tmux\n\n", "Q: What's the difference between -p tcp and -m tcp in iptables? I just noticed an entry in /etc/sysconfig/iptables along the lines of -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 138 -j DROP \nI am not so sure why there has to be two switches here for matching protocol TCP, that is, -p tcp and -m tcp. Is there any difference between them?\n\nA: \n-p The protocol of the rule or of the packet to check. \nThe specified protocol can be one of tcp, udp, icmp, or all, or it can\n  be a numeric value, representing one of these protocols or a different\n  one. A protocol name from /etc/protocols is also allowed. A \"!\"\n  argument before the protocol inverts the test. The number zero is\n  equivalent to all. Protocol all will match with all protocols and is\n  taken as default when this option is omitted. \n-m Specifies a match to use, that is, an extension module that tests for a specific property. \nThe set of matches make up the condition under which a target is\n  invoked. Matches are evaluated first to last as specified on the\n  command line and work in short-circuit fashion, i.e. if one extension\n  yields false, evaluation will stop.\n\nAdded info\n-m Also matches packets of the specified protocol name. If '!' precedes the protocol name, this matches all packets that are not of the specified protocol. Valid protocol names are icmp, udp, tcp... A list of all the valid protocols could be found in the file /etc/protocols. So I think it would be safe to omitt the -m\nSource:IPtables ManPage\n", "Q: How to setup 2 monitors and specify workplaces? I am using Ubuntu 13.04 desktop with 2 monitors and I want to use a specific workplace shown only on my 2nd monitor. When I switch workplaces on my 1st monitor, I don't want the 2nd one to be affected. \nFor example; I am running a VM or a terminal window on one of my workplaces and assign that workplace to my 2nd monitor so even if I switch between workplaces on my 1st monitor, I can still see the terminal or a VM on my 2nd one. Is there an option like that to assign a workplace on a specific monitor?\nI have NVIDIA Quadro 2000 graphic card on my system.\n\nA: You can not assign separate workspaces for your monitors with Unitiy and Compiz.\nA workaround that does the trick for many people is simply use the Always on Visible Workspace setting that can be accessed by right clicking on a window's top bar when it is not maximized.\nThis way the the windows set to use this option will stay in position when you change workspaces.\nFor real separate workspaces for your monitors you would need to use another desktop environment and/or window manager.\n", "Q: Write to USB flash drive extremely slow When I'm copying a copying a large file to a 8GB pendrive, the write crawls at some 10's of kB/s. Even after killing the process with Ctrl+C, the writing continues for several minutes. (the task manager applet and the \"bo\" field of vmstat)\nThis happens intermittently and sometimes can be fixed by remounting the drive.\n\n\n*\n\n*What could be causing this? (I think it's something in the kernel, because killing the process doest\n\n*How could I debug/find out what is happening?\n\n\nA: I had a similar problem with a 8GB flash drive and it turned out to be poor contact of the USB port on the stick. So I suggest before starting to mess around with the kernel you check to see if the contacts are clean. Also some times (on really cheap sticks) the plug contact is made of sub-standard material and tends to wear out causing slow transmission speeds. (I had the same problem with very cheap external hdd cables)\n\nA: I have the same problem with expensive hardware as well (Seagate HDD 2.5, Kingston DT Flash). Cheap ones woks even better. Don't matter if this is USB 2.0 or USB 3.0 port. Speed is always about 10 MB/s during write to disk. Read from disk and access is fast. This problem is only in Ubuntu. Windows and openSUSE works fine. Kernel doesn't matter too. The newest Ubuntu beta 13.10 with newest kernel have the same problem. I noticed better speed at Ubuntu LTS version (kernel version don't matter). Laptop has worse speed than PC.\nLooks like Ubuntu don't care about it. Most of all issues are unassigned, expired, not solved... too bad. People go to Windows...\n", "Q: Ubuntu One doesn't share some of my directories I have Ubuntu One installed in my Ubuntu 13.04 laptop and inside a Windows7 virtual machine.\nThe main Ubuntu One directory is in sync, this is Ok.\nI use this Win7 virtual machine only to use my desktop scanner. This vm collects all my scans inside a directory .../Scans.  \nI have configured Ubuntu One inside the Windows 7 virtual machine to sync this .../Scans directory too - I have checked the sync locally checkbox associated with this folder. It seems to work, synchronizing has been under processing, and the size allocated on the ubuntu cloud drive has grown up slowly, percent by percent. Now it shows \"Files SYnc is up to date\". So I should say the Ubuntu One service is working. \nMy problem: If I check the Ubuntu One directory inside my linux Ubuntu 13.04 laptop, the sync folder and its data won't appear ?\nWhat should I do so as my linux Ubuntu 13.04 has access to this Scans/ directory that is in sync with my win7 ?\n\nA: You should check \"sync locally\" on your Ubuntu 13.04 client too. To ensure that your .../scans file is uploaded to the cloud, you should explore your files from Ubuntu One\nand see if this file is uploaded.\nIf yes, then you haven't checked the \"sync locally\" in you Ubuntu 13.04 too.\n", "Q: Unable to boot Win8 after Ubuntu install After installing Ubuntu I am unable to start Windows 8.

This will fix your problem.\n", "Q: Package dependencies cannot be resolved help This error could be caused by required additional software packages which are missing or not installable. Furthermore there could be a conflict between software packages which are not allowed to be installed at the same time.\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\nsteam-launcher: Depends: curl but it is not going to be installed\n\nDepends: libc6 (>= 2.15) but 2.15-0ubuntu10.4 is to be installed\n\nHow do I get these? because with out them I can't run Steam\n\nA: You probably need to enable Community-maintained free and open-source software (universe) in Software Sources, either via Ubuntu Software Center or Synaptic depending on which version of Ubuntu you're using.\n", "Q: Dash does not show applications available for installation When I go to applications lens (Super+A), I can search for available applications and install them. From the general (home?) lens, I can list only application that are actually installed, not those that are available.\nI vaguely remember application used to show up in the home lense and maybe I disabled it but I am not sure. Or maybe this is the correct behaviour and my memory fails me?\n\nA: This is the correct behaviour! May be you browsed the lens using the buttons given on the bottom and then clicked on Applications lens(the second one from left) and then asked some application to be installed(?).\n", "Q: What does the '|' (vertical bar) character mean in a Terminal command? Example: In a Terminal command xdpyinfo | grep resolution (that I have taken from an answer),\ndoes the | character mean that the xdpyinfo output shall be sent to the grep program input for printing a line containing the resolution string? Where should I seek for such an information to avoid filling this forum by too simple questions? Thanks.\n\nA: It is called a pipe (or a pipeline) and it means that the output of the command in front of it are made as input to the command behind it.\nExample:\ndmesg | tail\nbash --version | tac\n\nYou are welcomed to try the command without the pipe.\nAnd yes you are correct: in this case the command xdpyinfo shows information and it is parsed to grep. grep filters the results and only shows lines that have resolution in them.\nMore information on pipe: \n\n\n*\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1072125/how-does-piping-work-in-linux\n\n*http://www.linfo.org/pipes.html\n\n*http://linuxtutorial.info/modules.php?name=MContent&pageid=21\n\n*https://workaround.org/linuxtip/pipes\n\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_%28Unix%29\n\nA: The vertical bar | is commonly referred to as a \"pipe\". It is used to pipe one command into another. That is, it directs the output from the first command into the input for the second command. So your explanation is quite accurate.\n\nA: The character  | is sometimes called a pipe and is used to connect the output from one command and feed it into the other.\nSo that xdpyinfo | grep resolution first runs the command xdpyinfo (a utility which displays information about X) without displaying any output.  The output of this command is fed into grep (regular expression parser) to find any entries which contain resolution.\nWhat you see is just the info you want and not the complete output of the xdpyinfo command.\n\nA: Your interpretation is correct. The | character pipes the output of the first command into the input stream of the second. The two commands are actually running in parallel, as two concurrent processes. It is an illustration of the 'paradigm of pipes and filters' (building complex functions by pipelining simple ones), which is a hallmark of Unix.\nFor more information on this, I would suggest you follow through some tutorial on bash or shell scripting. There are plenty of those the web. I bet you will be surprised by the elegance and power of Unix/GNU shells.\n", "Q: Broken packages and can't run -f install After I installed codeblocks it started giving me error\nI'm getting loads of errors.

Apt-get assumes you are root because you used sudo apt-get to run the program; this is why the suggested code did not include sudo and subsequently did not work.

After that, you can even search for and install gimp and codeblocks using synaptic as well. The synaptic package manager uses the apt-get repository, is much faster than software center, and seems to be more capable of dealing with broken packages. \n   As a newer user, it can be hard to break the habbit of downloading an .exe file from sourceforge, right clicking, and selecting \"run\" any time you want to install a new program. It appears you are trying to install an outdated downloaded version of codeblocks. Codeblocks and gimp are available in the officially updated repository. If it is not available to you through apt-get, use synaptic to enable third party repositories and then do a sudo apt-get update before trying again. However, sometimes a program is not available from the repository but is available from wherever as a .deb file . . . in order to avoid dependency issues during installation, you can right click a deb file and open it with archive manager, software-center, or a package manager like gdebi to automatically install and resolve dependency issuses for you. \nGood luck.\n\nA: Run this command:\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\n", "Q: Run different java based on command line parameter I have multiple java installations on my machine and need to use different versions all the time. I have found that the currently used JVM can be changed by the commands update-alternatives and update-java-alternatives, which essentially change the link at /etc/alternatives/java etc. to point to the correct JVM installation.\nIs it possible to run different versions of java by specifying a command line parameter? E.g., to run maven for example in the following ways:\n> JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle/ mvn clean install\n\n> JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/ mvn clean install\n\nEDIT: Above commands work \nWe can verify that the above commands work by running\n> JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun mvn -version\n\nApache Maven 3.0.4\nMaven home: /usr/share/maven\nJava version: 1.6.0_32, vendor: Sun Microsystems Inc.\nJava home: /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.32/jre\n\nThe java version and home are correct in the example.\nEDIT: Solution to the problem \nThe original problem was caused by an interface named CommonDataSource changed in the jre's rt.jar, which caused incompatibility between different JREs. The solution was to add the java 6's rt.jar to the classpath:\nJAVA_HOME=$JAVA6_HOME MAVEN_OPTS=\"-Xbootclasspath/a:$JAVA6_HOME/jre/lib/rt.jar\" mvn clean install\n\n\nA: The examples you show do precisely what you are looking for. So, though a command line parameter will not do the trick, an environment variable will. And you can specify 'one-time' environment variables on the command-line, preceding the command.\nMost, if not all, Java based software will honour the JAVA_HOME environment variable, and run the JVM located underneath that directory.  Maven certainly does: have a look at less $(which mvn) and see just how much effort it puts in getting this right.\nNote that - in the specific case of Maven - if your goal is to compile Java sources for an older JVM version, then there is no need to switch JVMs. Instead, specify the source and target Java versions in your POM.\n", "Q: My Flash Dirve is write protected My Flash Drive is write protected.

You will have to destroy the raid and use the disks independently to dual boot.\n\nA: Just to post my solution. I entered in Windows 8 and disabled the raid by disabling the Aceleration function in the Intel software. Once I did that, the raid was disabled and then ubuntu could recognize the partitions of the hard drive. Then I installed ubuntu, and then later reactivated the RAID for windows.\nThank you.\n\nA: Maybe you can choose \"something different\" in the installation dialog. But for this, first make a partition in windows and select it in Ubuntu. So i got Ubuntu 13.04 on my windows8 pre-installed laptop.\n", "Q: Two USB drives as RAID 1 array? Can two drives connected via USB be configured as a two-disk RAID 1 array?\n\nA: Yes, though the problem with USB is that if you suspend the system, they \"unplug\" so that will cause problems if you ever suspend.  You will need to manually unmount and then mdadm --stop the array before suspending or actually unplugging the drives.\n", "Q: Struggling with Windows installer in a Sedatech PC I just bought this PC:\nSedatech PC Office\nand right away I am trying to install Ubuntu 12.10 with the Windows Installer.\nEverything goes fine until the end of installation step 5. At that point the progress window disappears and nothing happens, nothing has been installed and all is almost exactly as it was just before double clicking on wubi.exe.\nI say \"almost exactly\" because in the partition where I ask Ubuntu to be installed (different than the Windows 7 partition) there is an ubuntu folder with a couple of files and folders, but nothing usable. Needless to say, there is no dual boot when I reboot.\nI have repeated this again and again. Any ideas?\nThanks!\n\nA: Almost all new computers ship configured to boot in EFI (aka UEFI) mode, and the WUBI tool you're trying to use is incompatible with an EFI-mode boot. Thus, my suspicion is that your attempt was doomed to fail, and you should instead try a more traditional dual-boot configuration.\n", "Q: How to reconstruct RAID-1 in Ubuntu? There was RAID-1 device created of two partitions of the similar size on two disks.

And I have those two partition which were part of RAID-1 device and they are unreadable.\nI would like to create RAID-1 using those two partitions. Is it possible to do it, get functional RAID-1 and gain back access to data stored there?\n\nA: Install the mdadm package and the array should show up as /dev/md127 and you should be able to open it in the gui.\n", "Q: Slow animations using Ubuntu 13.04 I just decided to now swap from Win to Ubuntu.

Please, I need help, please, I would be pleased for every answer!\n\nA: I have two suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try running Boot Repair from an emergency disc. This might fix the problem with GRUB, but there's a chance that it won't. If it doesn't work, save the URL that it provides. If the next suggestion also doesn't work, post the URL that Boot Repair gave you, along with any additional observations. The URL will point to a document with partitioning and other configuration details for your computer, which will be helpful in doing further diagnosis of your problem.\n\n*Download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager and prepare a suitable medium. Try booting with it. If rEFInd lets you boot both Windows and Linux, install the Debian package version of the program from Ubuntu. This will then take over from GRUB 2 as the default boot manager.

Below is a link to the boot repair summary from the most recent attempt at boot-repair.\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/6146103/\nAny suggestions as to how I could fix this without just wiping the drives and starting over?\n\nA: From Boot-Repair uncheck update all MBR, and check update MBR and choose to install the Windows work alike boot loader (syslinux) to sdb. And see if Windows will directly boot from sdb? If not then you need Windows repairs.\nIf Windows works then you may need to install grub to sdb, just to keep boot drive as hd0 or first drive. \nSometimes BIOS/Windows does not correctly remap drives. Windows should work, but in some cases you have to install grub to Windows drive and boot from that drive. Something about Windows seeing boot drive as first drive.\nSometimes BIOS settings like AHCI may make a difference. Windows does need the AHCI drivers before changing if you have not installed them, otherwise it may not boot.\n", "Q: No sound on a HP Pavilion dv6 with ubuntu 12.04 After installation Ubuntu 12.04 in my hp pavilion dv6 machine sound system is not working.\ncommands like \ngksudo gedit  /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf\nkillall pulseaudio  sudo alsa force-reload  pulseaudio -D\nsudo alsa force-reload\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall libasound2\ngksudo gedit  /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf\nkillall pulseaudio  sudo alsa force-reload  pulseaudio -D\ngksudo gedit  /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf\n\nhad tried as revealed from forum's discussion.

There is an easy way to use Hard Disk as RAM in Windows machines.\nIs there a way to use Hard Disk as RAM in Ubuntu ?\n\nA: Note : Using Hard Disk as RAM can be slow. It is recommended to use External fast Devices like flash memory to use as SWAP space. On my computer that has RAM of 875 MB, when I disabled SWAP usage, computer became fast. It's recommended that you follow this answer only if you have a speedy good Hard Disk.\nBy Making Partition\nIf your hard disk has free unallocated space, use this method.\nIf your system doesn't have gparted installed, install it using the command :\n\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nOpen gparted by doing the command :\n\nsudo gparted\n\nChoose the unallocated item in the list of partitions and click New button seen in top left corner :\n\nMake the options like below except for the size (you can choose the amount of size using for swap) :\n\nAfter choosing the options, click on Add button. It might take some time to create the new swap partition.\nAfter finishing, right click on the new partition item and choose swapon. Now swap is enabled.\nBy Making SWAP File\nI found out an AskUbuntu answer of using USB sticks as RAM. I did the same trick on Hard Disk and it works !!\nThis trick can be accomplished with the use of some small commands in Terminal.\nSo, Let's begin.\nCreate a file of 512 MB (The 512 indicates the RAM memory to be added):\n\nfallocate -l 512M ~/swapfile\n\nThe bolded number above shows the size of the file we're going to create. Examples :\n\n256M - 256 MB\n1G   - 1 GB\n\nExample of 1 GB :\nThe command will become :\n\nfallocate -l 1G ~/swapfile\n\nThe command will create a file named swapfile in your home directory of size 1 GB.\nNow let's create the SWAP space on the file and enable the SWAP :\n\nsudo mkswap ~/swapfile -f && sudo swapon -p 1000 ~/swapfile\n\nYour RAM Memory is now increased. To check whether if it is increased, do the following command :\n\nfree -m\n\nYou will get a result like below :\n\nAs shown in the picture you can see the extra SWAP space. Mission Accomplished.\nSource :- http://subinsb.com/how-to-use-hard-disk-as-ram-in-ubuntu-linux\n", "Q: How to access to synchronized folders via BitTorrent Sync?

I have a number of video files (MOV) which I only need to rotate 90° clockwise.\nAs it may be needed in the future as well, I first tried using ffmpeg and then mencoder command line in a Nautilus script but unfortunately I wasn't satisfied with the reduced quality of output video.\nAvidemux GTK has produced the output video in the same quality as the input video. But I would ideally like to use it from command line, i.e. avidemux2_cli, although I couldn't find any info about the use video filters like rotate in the documentation.\n\nA: It is best to use avconv instead of ffmpeg (avconv is the ubuntu version of ffmpeg and it is more up to date - while anytime you run ffmpeg you should see that it is deprecated, it only exists for compatibility purposes and it is going to be removed in the future).\nAll you need is to set a rather high video bitrate value when you apply the rotation. So, first, you can get a 1 minute sample of one of your videos, by running:\navconv -i input.mov -vcodec copy -acodec copy -ss 00:05:00 -t 00:06:00 sample.mov\n\nThen you can apply the 90° clockwise rotation like this:\navconv -i sample.mov -b:v 1200k -vf \"transpose=1\" sample_rotated.mov\n\nYou can experiment a little bit around with the bitrate value, and when you are pleased with the result (quality to size analogy) you can apply this command for any other of your big files.\n\nA: First, in the GUI open the Filter window, chose your filters, then click on \"Save filter list\", and select a filename (e.g., myfilters.xml).\nSecond, in the CLI specify the argument --filters with the filename as argument (e.g., --filters myfilters.xml).\n\nA: There's also a nice Nautilus script (using avconv command) for this purpose here:\nhttps://github.com/yeKcim/my_nautilus_scripts/tree/master/rotate%20pics%7Cvideos\n", "Q: Cannot receive e-mail when not logged in on ubuntu server recently I tried to set up an e-mail and web server with ubuntu server (postfix-dovecot and Apache2).

Then if you see wlan0 interface and ip address on it try to ping your gateway. If you cant - see the otput of arp -n.

Based on my research it appears that the firmware for Intel wireless chips does not properly implement the n spec. Why this has just recently become a problem is a question, but we did just get a new wireless controller; perhaps it implements the n spec somewhat differently than the old one did.\nMost of the fixes I've seen revolve around disabling the ability to connect to n and instead use a/b/g (hopefully not b).

I had shrunk the Windows partition 21 GBs, and did not format it. Then, I disabled fast boot and secure boot from the BIOS, and made the UEFI: sandisk with the 13.04 copied with Universal USB installer, the first priority for boot.\nWhen Ubuntu installer loaded, I chose Install Ubuntu, and then chose install alongside ubuntu.\nWhen it restarted, GRUB showed up with no problem, but when I try to load Ubuntu, I get no GUI. I tried startx, but it told me no screens found.\nWhen I try to boot into Windows 8, by choosing it from GRUB loader, It gives me the following errors:\nerror: can't find command \"drivemap\"\nerror: invalid efi filepath\n\nBut, when I go to the BIOS, the boot options have changed to include Ubuntu, and also the already existing Windows Boot Manager.

As I said, I had a little trouble with the 13.04 (it is also an unstable version). Just got with the Long Term Support version 12.04 LTS. This version is very stable and no problems on it. I can't propose any solution because I haven't tried deeply 13.04 so far. But if I find the solution to your problem, I'll let you know.\n12.04 is stable and supported until 2017. If you try to install it alonside Windows 8, format a partition (to ext2 or ext4) then install Ubuntu on it. It is advided to use the swap partition (1GB) if you computer has less than 4GB. After installing, you should have GRUB and then boot ubuntu. Any trouble with 12.04, tell me\n\nA: This is why your windows option fails:\nThe Ubuntu grub has a BIOS friendly menu item created by os-prober, which generates all the non-Ubuntu boot menu items. os-prober is not UEFI-ready (late-2013). Your system is UEFI and you will have to create your own menu item to boot windows, if you want to use Ubuntu grub2 to choose your OS, you can add menu items by editing this file: etc/grub.d/40_custom\nadd this menu item to it, by: sudo gedit etc/grub.d/40_custom\nmenuentry 'Windows 8' {\nsearch --fs-uuid --no-floppy --set=root 28ED-4D40\nchainloader (${root})/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n}\nreplace the 28E... with the UUID of your EFI partition. Find the UUID of the EFI partition using sudo blkid command in linux terminal.\nif you want windows to be at the top of the list, just rename 40_custom to 09_custom.\nThen run sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg to regenerate the file that holds the bootloader menu items. You can also customize the menu items completely.\nRegarding the problem where Ubuntu doesnt seem to boot properly, I recommend running Ubuntu boot-repair after booting from a Ubuntu live USB. You can make the live USB in windows.\n", "Q: I have a .sh that is \"Self Extracting\" but removes folders upon completion I need the folders to stick around and can't find a way to stop the script from removing them.

Is there anyway to step through a bash script or extract an archive from a self install .sh file? Thanks!\nThe package in question is: http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/docs/dataanalysistools/tools/spice/downloadspice/ (The Linux .sh)\n\nA: In this case you need only to do  \ntail -n +31  spice2_5_1-generic-linux.sh > spice2_5_1-generic-linux.tar\n\nafter you can deal with it as a normal tar file.  ( tar -xvf spice2_5_1-generic-linux.tar).\nSince this tar has not a main directory I suggest you to do \nmkdir TempSpice   \ncd TempSpice\ntar -xvf ../spice2_5_1-generic-linux.tar\n\n\nSome notes:\nOften the self extracting files are a bash script followed by data, just in only one file. In this case the script is in the first 30 lines.  \n#!/bin/sh\nPATH=/bin:/usr/bin\nbase=sut.$$\noutname_tar=$base.tar\ntempdir=spottmp.$$\nmkdir $tempdir\necho \"Unpacking...\"\nplatform=`uname`\nif [ $platform = \"SunOS\" ]; then\n    tail +31 $0 > $outname_tar\nelse\n    tail -n+31 $0 > $outname_tar\nfi\n\necho \"Extracting...\"\n(cd $tempdir; tar xvf ../$outname_tar)\n  savestatus=$?\n  if [ $savestatus != \"0\" ]; then\n    echo status from tar = $savestatus\n    echo ABORTING INSTALLATION\n    /bin/rm -rf $tempdir\n    /bin/rm -f $outname_tar\n    exit $savestatus\n    fi\necho \"cleaning up...\"\n/bin/rm $outname_tar\necho \"installing...\"\n(cd $tempdir; ./INSTALL)\n/bin/rm -rf $tempdir\nexit 0\n\nThe script inside is a basic one.

When I tried opening them in libreoffice they opened fine, but the format was all messed up. \n\nA: Not ideal but worth mentioning: you can use Microsoft Office webapps in any browser: http://office.microsoft.com . It's free to register, and you get some storage space for documents. \nNote that LibreOffice is getting better and better at handling MS document formats, so try to get the latest version of LO, it should work well for most documents, and for the really critical documents use MS Office webapp.\n\nA: My experience with this is that some formats are better than others, but the more exotic features you use LibreOffice gets it more wrong. \nYou can try to save to a different file format from MS Word (Word95, RTF, ...).

This answer provides some details on the available options for it.\nAnother way is to disable the GPG component of the Gnome Keyring, so that gpg-agent is used:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can do this by removing (or renaming to something other than *.desktop) the file /etc/xdg/autostart/gnome-keyring-gpg.desktop.\n\n*It's possible you already have the necessary settings for gpg-agent to autostart. At least for me, running Ubuntu 13.04, that's true.

According to How can I make fonts look like they do in Windows? I have got the resolution 96x96 dots per inch, but I do not see any possibility to set it in the System Settings; searching for 'font' finds only the 'Univesal Access' with no possibility of setting the resolution or loading any further fonts, maybe the True Type ones. According to How do I change the font DPI settings? answer I have installed the gnome-tweak-tool 3.3.4-0ubuntu. It also does not appear to enable setting the resolution nor loading more fonts.\n\nA: I'm learning about fonts too, so I'll tell you as much as I know about this.\nIf you're trying to apply a new font to, for example, LibreOffice, you can try to copy the font you've downloaded into the directory /usr/share/fonts or /usr/share/fonts/truetype. These are usually tarball files and are best extracted with tar -zxvf filename.tar.gz, but it doesn't have to end in .gz for it to be a tarball file.\nTo get Microsoft fonts on Linux, you can try sudo apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer in the terminal.\nAlternatively, if you have dual-booted your computer with a Windows partition (in which you share a common C:\\ drive with Linux and Windows), you can go to the Fonts folder (C:\\Windows\\Fonts). From here you can install the fonts by right clicking, hitting Preview or Open in Font Viewer (which may open many new windows due to it being font families), and clicking on Install.\n", "Q: Selecting any of the UEFI entries in GRUB keeps me booting Windows 7, what to do? Little problem with a newbie here, after a bunch of reinstalling, I've managed to make 7 + 8 + Ubuntu not crash on my new T430. 8 (pre)installed first, then 7, then Ubuntu (bootloader installed onto the root partition, not MBR I'm guessing?), then boot-repaired from a live CD Grub works, huzzah!\nProblem is, booting to windows comes in two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows UEFI bkpbootmgfw.efi  \n\n*Windows Boot UEFI loader\n\n\nBoth of which send to me to the Windows 7 bootloader, which then gives me the choice to boot 7 or 8. Any way I can boot to both of them directly from grub?\nUPDATE: I tried to use easybcd to re-default the windows bootloader, but it somehow managed to screw things up when \"reset\"ing, and I ended up with 60 boot items. Windows would not boot at all afterwards. \nI have now completely reinstalled everything, so Ubuntu and Windows both have their own boots which I can select as devices by pressing F12, and I can adjust the default as well. However, I would still like to have all 3 options available from start up. \nI tried using easybcd to add Ubuntu to the windows bootloader, but it says that it's missing the /NST/AutoNeoGrud2.mbr file and won't boot from there.\n\nA: This is not definitive, since I've never tested it; however....\nFirst, the MBR is irrelevant on your system, except insofar as a protective MBR is part of the GUID Partition Table (GPT). Your boot loaders are stored as files in the EFI System Partition (ESP), which is mounted at /boot/efi in most Linux installations. Ubuntu stores GRUB in the ESP's EFI/ubuntu directory (that is, /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu from Ubuntu), and Microsoft stores its boot loader in the EFI/Microsoft directory tree on the ESP. This is why you get the dual boot loader treatment when you want to boot Windows -- Microsoft uses one location for both Windows 7 and Windows 8, just as Ubuntu would if you were to install multiple versions of Ubuntu, so that one boot loader must present a menu to enable you to boot either version of Windows.\nIn theory you might be able to create a second ESP, copy the original ESP's EFI/Microsoft directory to it, and edit files on both ESPs to limit them to boot just one version of Windows. Unfortunately, I don't know enough about the Windows boot files to give more precise instructions. In fact, I don't even know that it would really work, but it might.\nIf you're willing to go to the effort, you could try this to get Windows to do most of the work for you by re-installing Windows 7:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a second ESP on the disk. In GParted, you'll need to shrink a partition by a small amount, create a new FAT32 partition in that space (be sure it's FAT32, not FAT16), and give it a \"boot flag.\" I also recommend giving it a unique name, like \"WIN7ESP.\" (This might be useful if you end up using rEFInd or to help identify it in file browsers.)\n\n*Remove the \"boot flag\" from the original ESP.\n\n*Optionally, change the type code on the Windows 8 partition. You could set the \"lvm flag\" on it in GParted, for instance. The goal here is to make it less likely that the Windows 7 installer will detect Windows 8.\n\n*Erase the original Windows 7 partition by creating a fresh NTFS filesystem on it. Give it a unique name to make it easier to identify.\n\n*Re-install Windows 7. At this point, Windows 7 should boot directly.\n\n*Restore GRUB as your default boot manager. If you're unsure how to do this, you can use Boot Repair. Alternatively, you could install another EFI boot manager, such as rEFInd or gummiboot.\n\n*In Linux, launch GParted and undo the partition type code changes you made earlier -- reset the boot flag on the original ESP and, if you changed the type code on the Windows 8 partition, remove that flag to restore it to the correct type code.\n\n*In Linux, type sudo update-grub to get it to re-detect boot loaders, with any luck including both of the Windows boot loaders. If that fails, you may need to edit /etc/grub.d/40_custom to add a custom menu; or you could install my rEFInd boot manager, which should detect both copies of the Windows boot loader.\n\n\nI make no promises that this procedure will work. Also, even if it does work, it may create problems down the line, because Windows doesn't support more than one ESP per system. (The EFI specification says it's OK, though.) Thus, a future Windows update or re-installation could end up getting confused and misbehaving. You should be able to work around such problems by temporarily resetting the type code on one or the other ESP (that is, removing its \"boot flag\" in GParted).\nIf this procedure doesn't work, or if it sounds too involved for you, I recommend you ask about this on a Windows forum, since Windows boot loader configuration is more of a Windows issue than a Linux issue.\nTwo more points:\n\n\n*\n\n*AFAIK, Ubuntu is still giving its Linux partitions the same type code that Windows uses. This makes the Linux partition(s) show up as unformatted disks in the Windows file browser. I recommend correcting this problem with gdisk, as described here. Neglecting to do this makes it too easy to accidentally trash your Linux installation from Windows.\n\n*Windows 8 uses a new \"fast startup\" feature that's incompatible with dual-booting (even with Windows 7). It's IMPERATIVE that you disable this feature, as described here. Failure to disable this feature will almost certainly result in filesystem corruption.\n\n\nA: When you boot Windows, it goes straight to it's bootloader, not to the OS itself. Because you have two versions of Windows installed, it will recommend both to you instead of just booting Windows itself. As a result, it is easier to just use the Windows bootloader and have it boot Linux. Grub can later be configured to go directly to Ubuntu. Here's what you need to do.\n\n\n*\n\n*Get EasyBCD\n\n*Use EasyBCD to set Windows as the default bootloader and modify its boot menu to include grub\n\n*Go into Ubuntu. Your boot menu should now allow you to choose between Windows 7, 8, and grub. Be sure that Ubuntu is the default option for grub.\n\n*Run gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub from Terminal\n\n*Make sure GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT equals 0\n\n*Profit!\n\n\nThis should make Grub go directly to Ubuntu, and make the Windows boot menu allow you to choose between all your operating systems. Good luck!\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 won't start after boot menu, but gives startup sound As said, I installed Ubuntu 12.04 in dual boot with my previous Windows Vista on my laptop.\nI run the boot repair, and did Recommended Repair.\nI can get into Windows, but not Ubuntu.

If I boot from Ubuntu DVD I notice that there are two options:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Run from DVD without installing it.\n\n*Install Ubuntu.\n\n\nMy question is, If the PC has a BIOS virus and the first option is chosen — will the Ubuntu (loaded into the RAM, I guess) be affected or would it be totally “safe and clean”?\n\nA: \n... If the PC has a BIOS virus ...\n\nWhich virus is in the BIOS of that PC?\nThe answer depends on that data. Some viruses do affect the content of the OS in RAM, some don't. \nHowever, if it's a Live CD, it's permanently closed to further writing, and the virus could not alter what's on the LiveCD. \n\nA: I don't see any real use case in modern systems with UEFI getting infected with virus (or so I hope). BIOS viruses are vestiges of an obsolete era. Modern hackers use Social Engineering (aka for fool people) and target a wide audience. Nobody will take the time to make a virus for a BIOS as it takes painstakingly amounts of time to make that it affects the most amount of systems.\nAlso, this viruses should need to work with the OS to do any real damage, which for now, again, isn't the main objective of the developers of malware. I wouldn't be afraid of phantoms of the past while clicking into spam/advisement.\n\nA: If you have a virus in your BIOS (doubtful) you need to\nflash your BIOS with a clean copy of the proper latest BIOS\nbefore you do anything with your computer.\nIf your BIOS is corrupted (much more likely) You still\nneed to flash the BIOS again to fix it or you will have\nproblems.\nBIOS is the Basic Input/Output System which is in a small\nchip on the motherboard. It is what makes your system \nboot up initially.\nIf you cannot boot to your hard drive then that is not BIOS:\nit is a Boot or MBR trouble which is very different.\n\nA: Well if the BIOS is what has the \"virus\" then it should not affect other operating software. Although I may be wrong I don’t believe that it should affect the BIOS. If you could give us more information, as if it is affecting anything on your hard drive, or if you can easily tell that the BIOS had a virus that would be helpful. Oh, and one more thing, if you can boot from the disk how did you do it, you would have to pass it through the BIOS, and I would find it hard to believe that it would even be able to boot if the BIOS had a virus.\n\nA: BIOSes don't generally become infected with a virus because they are flashed using an image from the BIOS manufacturer. They cannot be edited unless you used a flash.Search for the flashing sofware for your motherboard BIOS update in it's manufacturer's website using it's model name.\nIf what you are trying to imply is if the master boot record of your ubuntu was infected with a virus, will the loaded ubuntu from the live cd be infected when in RAM? My answer for that is no.\n", "Q: Run a nohup command over SSH, then disconnect I want to execute a script, start.sh on a remote server which runs this:\nnohup node server.js &\n\nNaively, I call SSH like this:\nssh myserver <<EOF\n./start.sh &\nEOF\n\nThis starts the script, but leaves the session connected. I want to follow this step with other commands in a script, so that's no good.\nHow can I SSH to the remote machine, launch a nohup command into the background, then disconnect? I suppose I could put the SSH process itself into the background, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nA: Why not just tmux or screen and be done with it? For example:\n$ tmux new -s SessionNameHere\n$ nohup /path/to/your/script.sh\n\nThis is practical if it's something that will continuously loop or take a while to finish. You can disconnect from the session and it will remain active.\n\nA: You have already found the right way, here document.\n\nNOTE: you can put the ssh (client) into background by placing a & at the end, but you will not see the output.

Ssh session will return in 10 seconds, despite you used nohup.\nReason is that remote stdout and stderr still connected to your session. It keeps ssh session alive, nohup does not help.\nThis:\nssh node \"nohup sleep 10 1>/dev/null 2>/dev/null &\"\n\nreturns immediately.

You can configure all buttons in some configuration files, but for advanced features there probably needs to be written a Linux equivalent of the Windows software.\nThis is where manufacturers fail. I don't know of a manufacturer developing free and open Linux drivers and software for their mice. Of course from their point of view it's so unbelievable that all of them should combine their efforts into writing one good solution that works for Linux with every advanced gaming mouse they produce.

So it doesn't matter how many scroll wheels and buttons the mouse has, but how you assign the buttons.\n\nA: Logitech G700s Rechargeable Gaming Mouse\nI'm adding my own answer for the gaming mouse I choose.\nThe G700s works out of the box using Easystroke to assign button events, but...\nEasystroke won't assign the button mapping to the mouse on-board memory, so you're pretty much stuck with one profile even though the mouse has 5 on-board profiles built in. Easystroke also wouldn't recognize one of the games executable, so It was pretty much a global setting or nothing.\nI installed Virtualbox and the VirtualBox Extension Pack, put WinXP on it, downloaded and installed  Logitech's software for WinXP to it, and then I could assign the different profiles to the mouse on-board memory which does indeed stay with the mouse in Linux. You could also just use a Windows PC temporarily to set up the mouse, then put it back on a Linux PC, it will save the profiles in the mouse, not the operating system.  \n\nA: For other Logitech Gaming Peripherals\nThere's a project called Gnome15 that supports Logitech Keyboards and Headsets...\n\"Gnome15 is a suite of tools for the Logitech G series keyboards and headsets, including the G15, G19, G13, G930, G35, G510, G11, G110 and the Z-10 speakers aiming to provide the best integration possible with the Linux Desktop.\"\n", "Q: Can I download this software on Ubuntu or is it not compatible I need to download this Secunia PSI 3.0 software inspector on my computer but my only working operating system is Ubuntu 12.10.

I need the instructions for installing Mozart Programming System on Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: The official website of Mozart suggests installing the package mozart, mozart-doc and mozart-stdlib from the Ubuntu Software Center. But here is the whole enchilada.\nAs per Ubuntu wiki:\nInstalling Mozart 1.4.0\nInstallation Instructions for Ubuntu 64-bit\nThe official website of Mozart suggests installing the package mozart, mozart-doc and mozart-stdlib from the Ubuntu Software Center. Don't do that if you're running a 64-bit version of Ubuntu. These packages are broken for this architecture.\nInstead, follow the instructions below\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the \"ia32-libs\" package, the 32-bit \"libx11-6\" package (i.e. \"libx11-6:i386\"), the 32-bit \"libgmp10\" package (i.e. \"libgmp10:i386\") and GNU/Emacs.\n\n*Download this deb file.\n\n*Open your file manager (i.e. Nautilus) and double click on the downloaded file. It will open it with the Ubuntu Software Center. If it does not, right click on the file and choose \"Open With Other Application...\" and then select the Ubuntu Software Center.\n\n*The Ubuntu Software Center will say \"Only install this file if you trust the origin.\", this is normal. Click the Install button, authenticate as asked and wait for the installation to proceed. If it complains about dependency problem, check that you have correctly done the point 1. of the section Installation Instructions for Ubuntu 64-bit of this wiki.\nTo install the remaining part of the Mozart standard library, install the mozart-stdlib package. You can also get the doc by installing the mozart-doc package. \nInstallation Instructions for Ubuntu 32-bit\nWarning: if you are using a 64-bit version of Ubuntu, see the appropriate section above !\nAs suggested by the official website of Mozart, simply install the mozart package and the mozart-stdlib package. You can also get the doc by installing the mozart-doc package.\nTroubleshooting\nGraphics Engine (tk.exe) crashed or could not be started\nIf you get the following error message\nGraphics Engine (tk.exe) crashed or could not be started\nwhen launching Mozart. That's maybe because you are missing one of the three 32-bit packages you had to install. So check you have installed the \"ia32-libs\" package, the 32-bit libx11-6 package (i.e. libx11-6:i386) and 32-bit libgmp10 package (i.e. libgmp10:i386).\nHowever, even if you do that, you may still end up with the same problem. If you go to: /usr/lib/mozart/platform/unknown-unknown$ and type: linux32 ./tk.exe and you get something like \n./tk.exe: error while loading shared libraries: libtk8.4.so.0: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64\n\nThat means tk.exe is still finding the wrong arch library. I managed to fix it by making a symbolic link in /usr/lib/mozart/platform/unknown-unknown/lib to the libraries installed by this package in /usr/lib32. Hope this helps, it worked for me.\nCould not link module\nIf you get an error like the following\n%********************** Error: module manager *******************\n%**\n%** Could not link module\n%**\n%** Could not load functor at URL: x-oz://system/wp/QTk.ozf\n%**--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nyou are likelly to be missing some part of the Mozart standard library.

I have Windows 7 installed on my PC right now with a number of programs. Will I have to install second copies of all these programs if I install Ubuntu as a secondary OS to run on the same PC?\n\nA: You should first consider that your programs probably aren't going to be the same as the ones you installed in Windows. As between most different operating systems, there is little native compatibility so if you're currently using something that doesn't have a Linux or Ubuntu version (more and more applications do these days), you'll have to look for an alternative.\nBut assuming we're talking about an application which is available for both Linux and Windows, the short answer is yes, you'll need to install a separate copy.\n\nA: When you install Ubuntu, you are installing a totally different OS with a different structure of binaries, a different kernel, a different set of rules.\nDepends of the set of programs you are talking about, but there is always alternatives in the Linux/Ubuntu world to almost any Windows program that runs natively on Linux/Ubuntu. If you could not survive without them, you could use Wine (Wine is not an Emulator) which provides a compatibility layer so Windows programs could run on Linux. Of course, you will need to install them into the Linux environment.\nInteresting links:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I install Windows software or games?\n", "Q: After apparently successful installation, my computer boots to the installer interface again I used a live USB to install Ubuntu. Installation seemed to be successful, but when I restart my computer and choose Ubuntu to start, it goes to the installer interface again.\nWhat's wrong?\n\nA: Your system is probably booting to the USB first in the boot sequence.\nCompletely shut down.  Then remove your USB from the system.  That should allow you to boot to Ubuntu when you turn on the computer..\n", "Q: Unable to install tor: chown missing operand I get the following error message while starting tor:\nflagg@flagg-eMachines-E627:~$ sudo chown -Rv $flagg ~/.tor-browser\n[sudo] password for flagg: \nchown: missing operand after ‘/home/flagg/.tor-browser’\nTry 'chown --help' for more information.\nflagg@flagg-eMachines-E627:~$ \n\nI get this message or a file doesnt exist error when trying to run chown command\nI am such a newbie and I probably screwed up while updating to ubuntu 13.04 or during the tor install.\n\nA: This should solve the problem.

I would like to know what's the recommended procedure to submit a request for a newer software version?\nAn example: I really like gThumb a lot, but the current version in Ubuntu 13.04 & 13.10 is 3.0.2. The last gThumb is 3.2.3 and was released this last august.  So, how to submit the request about refreshing a software like gThumb?\nThanks?\n\nA: Generally It's rare for software to be updated between major releases except where it fixes a security problem or significant bug.  But if enough people want it or the changes are significant enough it may be possible.\nThe correct procedure is to report a bug against the package on Launchpad.\nFor gthumb the link would be here\nInclude as much detail as you can.\nHowever if you look here you will see that 3.2.10.11 has been uploaded so it may appear in the next version of Ubuntu.\n\nA: You have to write to Technical Board to add the software to MicroReleaseExceptions\n", "Q: Will I have to reinstall applications if I reinstall Ubuntu? I am new to LINUX I have a quick question... \nI currently have three partitions:\n/\nswap\n/home\n\nI have a few related questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Which partition does apt-get install applications to? (Windows equivalent \"C:\\Program Files\" folder)\n\n*If I reinstall Ubuntu, will my applications go away and I have to reinstall them, like in Windows?\n\n*If I were to start from scratch and repartition, which partition should be the bigger partition (/ or /home?) if I am installing a lot programs from apt-get command\n\nA: apt-get installs things wherever the packages say they want to be installed. This is typically somewhere in /usr and /lib.\nReinstalling can be done in a variety of methods. If you install over the top of an existing installation, you probably won't have to reinstall applications but you may have problems with dependencies. The reinstalled version of Ubuntu won't know that some things are already installed.\nFor that reason, a clean install is usually recommended, in which yes, you will need to reinstall your applications, just as you would with Windows.\nI personally don't keep /home/ on a separate partition. This is more due to hardware (a small but stupidly fast SSD as my root partition and terabytes of slow RAID5) than anything else but I just keep the stuff I really want to keep (documents/music/etc) bind-mounted on the RAID5 array and then backup things I want running fast (firefox profile, etc) on a regular basis.\nI don't think there's a single best answer for every user but if you need more disk space for applications, you need a bigger root partition. That much is pretty simple.\n\nA: If you open the Ubuntu Software Center, there is a menu option for syncing. You could enable that and sync everything you have installed for easy installation later.

It used to be possible through a GUI in Ubuntu 12.04.\nAnyone know how I can solve this?\nThanks for the help :)\n\nA: It used to be (in 13.04 and earlier) that you can create a file called .Xmodmap in your home directory and it will get setup automatically on login, but I haven't tested this in 13.10.\nremove Lock = Caps_Lock\nkeysym Escape = Caps_Lock\nkeysym Caps_Lock = Escape\nadd Lock = Caps_Lock\n\nEdit:\nNow in 13.10 I've taken to editing swapescape in /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols\npartial hidden modifier_keys\nxkb_symbols \"swapescape\" {\n    key <CAPS> {        [       Tab, ISO_Left_Tab  ]       };\n    key <ESC>  {        [     Caps_Lock    ]       };\n    key <TAB>  {        [     Escape, Escape    ]       };\n};\n\nThis allows me to use setxkbmap to use -variant basic on my programmable keyboard and -variant swapescape otherwise.\n\nA: You can still directly access the underlying dconf key from the command line, as follows:\ndconf read /org/gnome/desktop/input-sources/xkb-options\ndconf write /org/gnome/desktop/input-sources/xkb-options \"['caps:escape']\"\n\n(It takes effect immediately.)\nTo enable multiple XKB options, list them as comma-separate quoted strings; for example, I also use Menu as my compose key:\ndconf write /org/gnome/desktop/input-sources/xkb-options \"['caps:escape', 'compose:menu']\"\n\nSee the xkeyboard-config manual page for a full reference of the XKB options you can use.\n\nA: I made a work around (sort of) by putting the following commands in it and executing it everytime I reboot:\n#! /bin/bash\nxmodmap -e \"clear Lock\"\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 9 = Caps_Lock\"\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 66 = Escape\"\nxmodmap -e \"add Lock = Caps_Lock\"\n\nUnfortunately I also need to execute it every time I switch keyboard layouts, which I do way to often for this to be any solution I can use for long.\n\nA: ~/.Xmodmap is not automagically parsed by xmodmap at login time when using Unity in 13.10. You can create a wrapper script and have it run by \"Startup Items\" but every time you suspend/resume you'll find your capslock works as normal.\n13.10 Unity has no way to disable/remap Caps_lock like kubuntu does.

I'm using the middle mouse button on my ThinkPad with Ubuntu to scroll and I'm pasting a lot of text in my documents by accident which is very annoying and I often end up with messed up documents.\nI searched on the internet how to disable this feature. The only quick solution I've found is to execute xmodmap -e \"pointer = 1 25 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\" in the konsole or for a persistent change to put pointer = 1 25 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 in the ~/.Xmodmap file. So the middle butten gets remapped to another button. This works fine for me, but now I cannot use use the middle mouse button for anything else---especially not for my beloved feature of opening new tabs in firefox by middle-clicking. Or just anything else...\nApart from directly patching the GTK I was not able to find anything else. Does someone know a more elegant way to disbale the middle-click-paste functionality in Ubuntu?\n\nmy system:\nThinkPad-R61\n3.8.0-30-generic #44-Ubuntu SMP Thu Aug 22 20:54:42 UTC 2013 i686 i686 i686 GNU/Linux\n\nA: Here's the best solution I've found to keep middle click functional without it pasting things.\nFirst install sxhkd and xsel.\nThen configure ./.config/.sxhkd/sxhkdrc like so\n~button2\n    echo -n | xsel -n -i\n~control + c\n    echo -n | xsel -n -i\n~control + shift + c\n    echo -n | xsel -n -i\n~control + x\n    echo -n | xsel -n -i\n\nAnd that's basically it.\nNow start sxhkd (or configure it to launch on startup). Now, middle mouse will no longer paste anything but will otherwise function like normal.  (As long as you use only ctrl+c and ctrl+x to copy things that is, if you copy things with the mouse it can paste once before it returns to normal.)\n\nA: There is some clean solution that works on Ubuntu 14.04. I obtained it by running gnome-tweak-tool -v -d. The solution is:\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.xsettings overrides  \"{'Gtk/EnablePrimaryPaste': <0>}\"\n\nIt can be done in dconf-editor as well: org->gnome->settings-daemon->plugins->xsettings --->>> overrides and put {'Gtk/EnablePrimaryPaste': <0>}.\nTo activate it you can put 1 instead of 0.\n\nA: What I ended up doing was creating two aliaseses in .bashrc:\nalias mc-off='xmodmap -e \"pointer = 1 25 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\"'\nalias mc-on='xmodmap -e \"pointer = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\"'\n\nNow every time I need to disable the trackpad's middle click I run mc-off from a terminal and mc-on to switch it back on when I plug a mouse.\n\nA: I too tried to look for a clean solution to this problem, but ended up going for a surprisingly effective work-around. If you have xsel installed, you can clear the contents of the primary paste buffer (the one used by the middle mouse) with xsel -p -c. You can then create a keyboard shortcut that executes this command, and map it to any unused keys (in my case, the rectangular ThinkPad button which is farthest to the right in the left-hand corner of the space above the keyboard proper on my ThinkPad X230; you should have a similar button (might be blue on your model), but if not, you can use any other vestigial button that you wish). I used the system preferences pane for Keyboard Shortcuts to do this, so Xmodmap is not required for this workaround. Now, whenever I want to use my middle mouse, I press this button to clear any content that might be in the paste-buffer, and it works perfectly, without the need to cripple the functionality of the middle mouse.\nI hope you find this response useful, or otherwise find the answer you are looking for.\n", "Q: How to Install Xubuntu Inside Windows (no downloading) I have these files.\nubuntu-12.04.3-wubi-amd64.tar.xz\nubuntu-12.04.1-i386.iso\nxubuntu-12.04-i386.iso\nI want to install Xubuntu inside windows.\nI have tried with wubi.exe --dimagepath=path but still it gives an error\nCannot download metalink and therefore iso...\nPlease Help me with this.\nIs there any way to tell wubi to pick up xubuntu's iso from my pc?\nThanks\n\nA: You can't mix versions of wubi.exe (and as far as Wubi is concerned, 12.04 is not the same as 12.04.1/2/3).\nYou can install Xubuntu using the ISO you have as long as you use the correct wubi.exe i.e. the ones dated 24 April 2012 from old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/precise/\nTo do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Save the ISO with the correct version of wubi.exe in the same folder\n\n*Disconnect from the Internet (avoid the mds5sum check)\n\n*Run wubi.exe\nNote this assumes that the Xubuntu ISO you have is good. \n", "Q: Choice of 32 bit or 64 bit Ubuntu for notebook I have HP notebook with AMD Turion 64x2 processor with NVIDIA GeForce Go 6150 display adaptor. Which Ubuntu I can use 32 bit or 64 bit to dual boot with Windows 7?\n\nA: Your processor is a 64 bit processor so I would just install a 64 bit version of ubuntu. What you do want to watch out for is your optimus enabled graphical card. you'll need bumblebee to get it to work correctly.\nNow it has come to my attention that ubuntu 13.10 will have support for optimus graphical cards but my source isn't an official one so if someone can confirm this.\nubuntu 13.10 will be released next month (oct 2013) if I'm not mistaken.\n\nA: You neglected to mention how much memory your system has. The biggest advantage of 64-bit is the ability to use more than 4 GB of RAM. The tradeoff is that 64-bit code uses up more memory.\nSo despite your processor being 64-bit, I would choose 32-bit Ubuntu only if you really need it (i.e. if you have 4 GB RAM or more). If your system has only 2-3 GB RAM or less, you will get no benefit from 64-bit and it will actually be a bit slower.\n", "Q: partitions aren't shown during installation of ubuntu I've bought a new laptop (dell inspiron 15 3521) with windows 8.\nSince I mainly use linux I removed the 7 partitions windows 8 apparently needed and made 4 partitions using a pmagic live usb (windows 80 gb, linux 80 gb, data 150 gb, swap 8 gb) and since I had some problems with getting it to boot from a dvd I installed linux first without problems.\nBut when I got the dvd to work (legacy mode and the a driver on a usb plugged in during installation Serial-ATA_Driver_85FV7_WN_11.7.0.1013_A01) it gave an error (windows cannot be installed on this disk. The selected disk is of the GPT partition style.). \nTo fix this I removed all partitions (including the ubuntu partition) and made a new one. windows also made a dedicated windows partition of 100mb.\nAfter the timely installation of windows 7 I got out my ubuntu 13.04 usb drive and preformed a live boot. When I got to the point of creating a new partition (using the ubuntu 13.04 installer) for linux the partition manager didn't show any partitions on the drive at all only 320 gb of 'unallocated space'. I was however able to mount the partitions on the drive. So I know they are there and that ubuntu can see them.\nSo I booted with my pmagic live usb and the partition editor promted me with the following question: \nWarning: /dev/sda contains GPT signatures, indicating that it has a GPT table.\nHowever, it does not have a valid fake msdos partition table, as it should.\nPerhaps it was corrupted -- possibly by a program that doesn't understand GPT\npartition tables. Or perhaps you deleted the GPT table, and are now using an\nmsdos partition table. Is this a GPT partition table?\nYes/No? \n\nWho can help me to fix this problem?\n\nA: See the following Web site for details:\nhttp://www.rodsbooks.com/missing-parts/index.html\nBasically, when you installed Windows, its partitioner only partially erased the GPT data structures, leaving a disk that's technically MBR, but with enough GPT data left over that it's confusing libparted, upon which the Ubuntu installer depends.

How to fix it?\n\nA: You seem to have conflicting versions of libx11-6 installed. When they fail to agree, it stops the whole install process. What you need to do isone of the following:\nremove the i386 version of libx11-6 (apt-get remove libx11-6:i386). This might not be an option if a 32-bit application depends on it.\nupgrade the amd64 version of libx11-6 (apt-get upgrade libx11-6). This might not be an option if there is no upgrade available.\ndowngrade the i386 version of libx11-6 (I've never done this without Synaptic). This is a last resort.\nOnce you have done one of the above, the install should proceed normally.

By default, grep prints the matching lines.\n\n   In addition, two variant programs egrep and fgrep are available.  Egrep\n   is the same as grep -E.  Fgrep is the same as grep -F.\n\nOPTIONS\n   -A NUM, --after-context=NUM\n      Print NUM  lines  of  trailing  context  after  matching  lines.\n      Places  a  line  containing  --  between  contiguous  groups  of\n      matches.\n\n   -a, --text\n      Process a binary file as if it were text; this is equivalent  to\n      the --binary-files=text option.\n\n   -B NUM, --before-context=NUM\n      Print  NUM  lines  of  leading  context  before  matching lines.\n      Places  a  line  containing  --  between  contiguous  groups  of\n      matches.\n\n   -C NUM, --context=NUM\n      Print  NUM lines of output context.

By  default,\n      TYPE is binary, and grep normally outputs either a one-line mes-\n      sage saying that a binary file matches, or no message  if  there\n      is  no  match.   If  TYPE  is without-match, grep assumes that a\n      binary file does not match; this is equivalent to the -I option.\n      If  TYPE  is  text,  grep  processes a binary file as if it were\n      text; this is  equivalent  to  the  -a  option.   Warning:  grep\n      --binary-files=text  might output binary garbage, which can have\n      nasty side effects if the output is a terminal and if the termi-\n      nal driver interprets some of it as commands.\n\n   --colour[=WHEN], --color[=WHEN]\n      Surround  the matching string with the marker find in GREP_COLOR\n      environment variable. WHEN may be 'never', 'always', or 'auto'\n\n   -c, --count\n      Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching  lines\n      for  each  input  file.  With the -v, --invert-match option (see\n      below), count non-matching lines.\n\n   -D ACTION, --devices=ACTION\n      If an input file is a device, FIFO or socket, use ACTION to pro-\n      cess  it.   By default, ACTION is read, which means that devices\n      are read just as if they were  ordinary  files.   If  ACTION  is\n      skip, devices are silently skipped.\n\n   -d ACTION, --directories=ACTION\n      If  an  input file is a directory, use ACTION to process it.  By\n      default, ACTION is read, which means that directories  are  read\n      just  as if they were ordinary files.  If ACTION is skip, direc-\n      tories are silently skipped.  If ACTION is recurse,  grep  reads\n      all  files under each directory, recursively; this is equivalent\n      to the -r option.\n\n   -E, --extended-regexp\n      Interpret PATTERN as an extended regular expression (see below).\n\n   -e PATTERN, --regexp=PATTERN\n      Use PATTERN as the pattern; useful to protect patterns beginning\n      with -.\n\n   -F, --fixed-strings\n      Interpret PATTERN as a list of fixed strings, separated by  new-\n      lines, any of which is to be matched.\n\n   -P, --perl-regexp\n      Interpret PATTERN as a Perl regular expression.\n\n   -f FILE, --file=FILE\n      Obtain  patterns  from  FILE, one per line.  The empty file con-\n      tains zero patterns, and therefore matches nothing.\n\n   -G, --basic-regexp\n      Interpret PATTERN as a basic  regular  expression  (see  below).\n      This is the default.\n\n   -H, --with-filename\n      Print the filename for each match.\n\n   -h, --no-filename\n      Suppress  the  prefixing  of  filenames  on output when multiple\n      files are searched.\n\n   --help Output a brief help message.\n\n   -I     Process a binary file as if it did not  contain  matching  data;\n      this is equivalent to the --binary-files=without-match option.\n\n   -i, --ignore-case\n      Ignore  case  distinctions  in  both  the  PATTERN and the input\n      files.\n\n   -L, --files-without-match\n      Suppress normal output; instead print the  name  of  each  input\n      file from which no output would normally have been printed.  The\n      scanning will stop on the first match.\n\n   -l, --files-with-matches\n      Suppress normal output; instead print the  name  of  each  input\n      file  from  which  output would normally have been printed.  The\n      scanning will stop on the first match.\n\n   -m NUM, --max-count=NUM\n      Stop reading a file after NUM matching lines.  If the  input  is\n      standard  input  from a regular file, and NUM matching lines are\n      output, grep ensures that the standard input  is  positioned  to\n      just  after the last matching line before exiting, regardless of\n      the presence of trailing context lines.  This enables a  calling\n      process  to resume a search.  When grep stops after NUM matching\n      lines, it outputs any trailing context lines.  When  the  -c  or\n      --count  option  is  also  used,  grep  does  not output a count\n      greater than NUM.  When the -v or --invert-match option is  also\n      used, grep stops after outputting NUM non-matching lines.\n\n   --mmap If  possible, use the mmap(2) system call to read input, instead\n      of the default read(2) system call.  In some situations,  --mmap\n      yields  better performance.  However, --mmap can cause undefined\n      behavior (including core dumps) if an input file  shrinks  while\n      grep is operating, or if an I/O error occurs.\n\n   -n, --line-number\n      Prefix each line of output with the line number within its input\n      file.\n\n   -o, --only-matching\n      Show only the part of a matching line that matches PATTERN.\n\n   --label=LABEL\n      Displays input actually coming from standard input as input com-\n      ing  from  file LABEL.  This is especially useful for tools like\n      zgrep, e.g.  gzip -cd foo.gz |grep -H --label=foo something\n\n   --line-buffered\n      Use line buffering, it can be a performance penality.\n\n   -q, --quiet, --silent\n      Quiet; do not write anything to standard output.   Exit  immedi-\n      ately  with  zero status if any match is found, even if an error\n      was detected.  Also see the -s or --no-messages option.\n\n   -R, -r, --recursive\n      Read all files under each directory, recursively; this is equiv-\n      alent to the -d recurse option.\n\n --include=PATTERN\n      Recurse in directories only searching file matching PATTERN.\n\n --exclude=PATTERN\n      Recurse in directories skip file matching PATTERN.\n\n   -s, --no-messages\n      Suppress  error  messages about nonexistent or unreadable files.\n      Portability note: unlike GNU grep, traditional grep did not con-\n      form to POSIX.2, because traditional grep lacked a -q option and\n      its -s option behaved like GNU grep's -q option.  Shell  scripts\n      intended to be portable to traditional grep should avoid both -q\n      and -s and should redirect output to /dev/null instead.\n\n   -U, --binary\n      Treat the file(s) as binary.  By default, under MS-DOS  and  MS-\n      Windows,  grep  guesses the file type by looking at the contents\n      of the first 32KB read from the file.  If grep decides the  file\n      is  a  text  file, it strips the CR characters from the original\n      file contents (to make regular expressions with  ^  and  $  work\n      correctly).  Specifying -U overrules this guesswork, causing all\n      files to be read and passed to the matching mechanism  verbatim;\n      if  the  file is a text file with CR/LF pairs at the end of each\n      line, this will cause some regular expressions  to  fail.   This\n      option  has no effect on platforms other than MS-DOS and MS-Win-\n      dows.\n\n   -u, --unix-byte-offsets\n      Report Unix-style byte offsets.   This  switch  causes  grep  to\n      report  byte  offsets  as if the file were Unix-style text file,\n      i.e. with CR characters stripped off.  This will produce results\n      identical to running grep on a Unix machine.  This option has no\n      effect unless -b option is  also  used;  it  has  no  effect  on\n      platforms other than MS-DOS and MS-Windows.\n\n   -V, --version\n      Print  the  version number of grep to standard error.  This ver-\n      sion number should be included in all bug reports (see below).\n\n   -v, --invert-match\n      Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.\n\n   -w, --word-regexp\n      Select only those  lines  containing  matches  that  form  whole\n      words.   The  test is that the matching substring must either be\n      at the beginning of the line, or preceded  by  a  non-word  con-\n      stituent  character.  Similarly, it must be either at the end of\n      the line or followed by a non-word constituent character.  Word-\n      constituent  characters are letters, digits, and the underscore.\n\n   -x, --line-regexp\n      Select only those matches that exactly match the whole line.\n\n   -y     Obsolete synonym for -i.\n\n   -Z, --null\n      Output a zero byte (the ASCII  NUL  character)  instead  of  the\n      character  that normally follows a file name.  For example, grep\n      -lZ outputs a zero byte after each  file  name  instead  of  the\n      usual  newline.   This option makes the output unambiguous, even\n      in the presence of file names containing unusual characters like\n      newlines.   This  option  can  be  used  with commands like find\n      -print0, perl -0, sort -z, and xargs  -0  to  process  arbitrary\n      file names, even those that contain newline characters.\n\nSOURCE:MANPAGE FOR GREP\nYou can learn about commands by typing\ninfo <command>  \n\nman <command>\n\nwhatis <command>\n\napropos <command>  \n\nin the terminal.\n\nA: You tagged your question with grep tag. But it was better if you read first the tag info referring to grep:\n\ngrep is a command-line utility that is used for searching text from standard input or a file for specific expressions, returning the lines where matches occur.\nA common use for grep is to locate and print out certain lines from log files or program output.\nSee this Ubuntu Documentation page for more information on how to use grep.\n\nAlso, almost any command has a manual page that you can read it. In your case, use this command:\nman grep\n\nEven more, you can get information about grep using one of these commands: info grep, grep -h, grep --help, whatis grep or apropos grep.\n\nA: grep is used to search for text from a file or another command's output. It can return the lines where it finds a match or the lines where it doesn't.\n\nA: The grep command searches one or more input files for lines containing a match to a specified pattern. By default, grep prints the matching lines.\nGrep searches the named input FILEs (or standard input if no files are named, or the file name - is given) for lines containing a match to the given PATTERN.  By default, grep prints the matching lines.\nIn addition, two variant programs egrep and fgrep are available.  Egrep is the same as grep -E.  Fgrep is the same as grep -F.Man Page\nYou may also take a look at SS64\n\nA: grep searches the content of files based on a regular expression. The easiest way to use it is something like grep \"word\" file.txt, in which case it will just return every line where \"word\" appears in file.txt (or nothing if it's not there). To make it do more advanced things, learn about regular expressions. You can find plenty of tutorials online by searching. http://lmgtfy.com/?q=grep+tutorial\nPersonally, I don't recommend using the terminal just for the sake of using the terminal. You might go through a lot of trouble to learn complicated tools like grep only to discover that you use graphical programs or scripts you wrote in your favorite interpreted language. Most people who recommend learning old-fashioned terminal commands are themselves old-fashioned hackers.\n", "Q: Multiple displays I am currently using Ubuntu 13.4, And I sometimes use two screen to make things easier sometimes; but there is an annoying problem.\n\nwhenever I try to change the resolution at a different level on any screen, The orientation locks itself to clockwise and their is no way to return it back to normal unless I exit.

Problem is, what I see from the screenshot (jásej jásej... zdravím) you want to use an data-projector as second monitor. Projectors usually has lower resolution than your display. Therefore you have to decrease resolution of your primary display or to buy a new projector with higher resolution ability. \nNot every time projectors are correctly detected and then display offers just a basic resolutions, regardless the projector offers more resolutions or not. Try to play with display resolution settings. \ntry to follow this questions: Resolution and screens not detected properly , Monitor not detected - low resolution only\nAdditionally, you can prepare some scripts which can switch your resolutions flexible there and back. Employ xrandr to setup proper modes. For example following command will put my external display right of the main notebook display \nxrandr --output VGA-0 --auto --right-of LVDS-0\n\nthis script will run cloning of the notebook display on VGA \nxrandr --output VGA-0 --same-as LVDS-0\n\nand this will switch my VGA off:\nxrandr --output VGA-0 --off\n\nYou should use output names specific to your system. You can add specific resolutions to each output into the command. Good answers how to do that are here: How can I make xrandr customization permanent?\nEdit: Now I understand your problem better. I found something about similar problem here http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2006533 , but without clear solution. So you are not the only one. Seems like for cloning displays, the external monitor forces wrong resolution to your notebook display. It would be necessary to know more about your system:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is your graphics card?\n\n*Did you install specific drivers as Catalyst for Nvidia?\n\n*what is the result of xrandr command when second display is connected and cloning and what is the result when second display is not connected?\n\n*is there any /etc/X11/xorg.conf file (or on the paths listed here: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man5/xorg.conf.5.html ) and if yes, what is the content?\n\n\nEdit2: the xrandr result should be OK, I see your LVDS as primary display and VGA-0 (should be) shifted 1280 pixels ríght and 200 pixels up, means lower corner if both monitors should be the same. There should be no reason why the part of second (VGA) monitor is displayed on your notebook display.

Also check the integrity of the format before using the device by using a standard partitioning program that has the capability to check for exFat format integrity. You'll have to search for such a program.\nAlso note that NTFS is reported to shorten the lifespan of flash drives due to using more read write operations on the device then Fat, Fat32, or exFat file systems do. \nIf you are moving files larger then 4GB to the device then exFat is a better choice noting that exFat has been reported to not be as well supported by Mac or Linux systems yet. Where \"well supported\" means the functionality is present and functioning without having to install extra tools or make extra configurations after a first install of the Operating System.\nIn the error you have shown, pagefile.sys is reporting a size of 0, when the mount program was expecting a size of 8565587968. This could mean a number of different things but in general this is due to the file system not being recognized correctly. For example this could mean that exFat isn't implemented correctly in Linux yet, or that the drive wasn't formated correctly to an exFat filesystem, or that something else went wrong.\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu in Microsoft Virtual PC?

I am giving this:\nrsync -Paz --exclude-from 'rsync-exclude.txt' /home/chris/ admin@192.168.1.65:LinuxHome\n\nwhere rsync-exclude.txt has this content:\n/home/chris/Downloads/*\n/home/chris/Downloads/\n/home/chris/Downloads/*.*\n\nand it is in the same folder I execute rsync (home folder).\nHowever the rsync tries to copy this folder, too.\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: You are providing absolute paths in your exclude list.\nWith rsync, all exclude (or include!) paths beginning with / are are anchored to the \"root of transfer\". \nThe root of transfer in this case is /home/chris. If you did:\nrsync -Paz --exclude-from 'rsync-exclude.txt' / admin@192.168.1.65:\n...then your exclusions should work (but you'd be copying everything else on that filesystem!).\nBut since you're just trying to sync your home directory, and there is no subdirectory of /home/chris named \"home/chris/Downloads\", rsync finds nothing that matches.\nSo try removing the /home/chris parts from your rsync-exclude.txt file.\nActually, you should just need a single line in the file:\n/Downloads\n\nNote that if you don't specify the leading /, and you happen to have other directories named \"Downloads\", those would also be excluded. I'm assuming you only want to exclude your \"top-level\" (relative to the source directory, aka the \"root of transfer\") Downloads directory, so you'll want the leading /.\nTHE EASIEST WAY (to exclude only a few paths)\nIf you only need to exclude one directory, just do this (avoiding a separate file):\nrsync -Paz --exclude /Downloads /home/chris/ admin@192.168.1.65:LinuxHome\n\nYou can also chain together --exclude tags, like so:\nrsync -Paz --exclude /Downloads --exclude '/Something Else' --exclude .hiddenFile /home/chris/ admin@192.168.1.65:LinuxHome\n\nNote that since there's no slash, that one will exclude .hiddenFile from any every directory it copies!\nBut if you have more than a few exclusions, you're better off with --exclude-from and a file.\nNote\nI see that you got it right, but those new to rsync should note the slash at the end of /home/chris/\nTo quote the rsync man page, \"You can think of a trailing / on a source as meaning 'copy the contents of this directory' as opposed to 'copy the directory by name'.\"\nSo if you left off that trailing slash, you would end up with a directory called chris within the target directory, containing everything from /home/chris (except the original Downloads directory, of course!).\n\nA: This might be easier on the eyes, and just a note on excluding directories and syntax:\nSRC='/home/username'\nDST='/run/media/username/EasyStoreRT/rsync'\n\nrsync -avrh --stats                                 \\\n    --log-file=/home/username/log/rsync-home.log    \\\n    --exclude='/username/.cache'                    \\\n    --exclude='/username/.local/share/Trash'        \\\n    $SRC \\\n    $DST \\\n\nIt will exclude those directories and all files within them.  For whatever reason, rysnc wasn't appending /home/username to /.cache. Only home/ would anchor itself, so I had to add /username to each excluded directory.\nThe man pages say, \"if the pattern starts with a / then it is anchored to a particular spot in the hierarchy of files, otherwise it is matched against the end of the pathname.\" But, that hierarchy seems to only be the first directory in the source directory.

I've gotten suspend practically fixed using a chromebook-snooze-hack package from the Chromebook ARM PPA. But the problem remains that there is no ACPI available.\nMy new goal here is to get ACPI enabled/available.\n\nA: If ACPI is not installed, you can install it either by clicking here or by running in a Terminal (use Ctrl+Alt+T: sudo apt-get install acpi.\nYou'll then find the 'acpi' directory inside /sys/ (if not, try in /proc too).\nFor rest of the solution, go ahead as given in the link you've already posted and update whether it works or not.\nP.S. Another possible way to work with it is available here.\n\nA: I'm also running Ubuntu on my Samsung 3 Chromebook, and have been using it exclusively for about 6 months. While the ARM CPU instruction set is standardized, The ARM platform is extremely fragmented.  So platform standards, like those we use in x86, are often missing on any particular system.\nSo you're actually not experiencing unexpected behavior, ACPI is nonexistent on this board. \nHence no /proc/acpi directory, and acpi_available returning exit status 1.  So to access what ACPI provided, it usually means you must access the hardware through the kernel drivers. For example, I found the battery charge status in the /sys/class directory. \n", "Q: Compilation error when installing Realtek 8192cu driver I'm using a laptop with Ubuntu 13.04 64 bits. After \"fighting\" for some time, I gave up trying to have my Realtek 8188ce wireless card work properly (the wifi connection is annoyingly unstable).\nSo I decided to buy a wireless USB adapter (USB stick). It's a D-Link Wireless N 150 Micro USB Adapter DWA-121. To get it working, one needs to download and install the Realtek driver 8192cu from here (and load the 8192cu module).\nI've done it successfully in the past, but I've also encountered the same problem as what follows. I think it worked after some upgrades, but right now I can't find a fix. I've upgraded linux-headers-generic, linux-source and build-essential, to no avail.\nAfter downloading the driver, one must run the install.sh script to install it. My problem is I get the following compilation error:\nroot@brice-laptopLDLC:/home/brice/Téléchargements/RTL8188C_8192C_USB_linux_v3.4.4_4749.20121105# ./install.sh

Help would be greatly appreciated, thanks!\n\nA: My apologies, I didn't search well enough, a solution was linked to here. I suppose a mod can delete this question.\n", "Q: Tex Editor from main-repository I am looking for a TeX editor from a main repository. Since I am very causious on intalling stuff from universe I would like to avoid TeXmaker and Kile :(\nCan anyone suggest a program?\n\nA: The only Tex stuff that is Canonical supported is TeX Live...an as far as I can see there are no editors here...just libraries to allow working with stuff.

On a 32-bit system you can only install 32-bit software. \nYou need to install a 64-bit version of Ubuntu to be able to install 64-bit applications.\nThe reason for this is that the hardware needs to be able to handle 64-bit long instructions and the operating system needs to know this.

During this wait period, it may appear to users that the system is hanging!\nAlso beware that anyone who has sufficient knowledge to mount the snapshot, could make changes to the \"frozen\" state. I have taken advantage of this possibility to update \"frozen\" systems, but again, this too can increase time it takes to merge (revert to) the snapshot!\n\nLVM snapshots + cron + script = \"frozen\" state\nI recently started digging into LVM and it occured to me that one could feasibly create a \"frozen\" state on a machine using LVM and it's snapshot capabilities. Of course, this method requires a system that is configured using LVM (or at least LVM on the partitions to be frozen).\nSummary:\n\n*\n\n*Install system on LVM partitions reserving enough space on a PV for a snapshot\n\n*Get the system configured the way you want it.\n\n*Create a cron job that runs as root at boot to merge the snapshot and create a new snapshot to replace the merged one\n\n*All successive reboots revert to the snapshot. All snapshots created are taken of the system in the state you created it in.\n\n*As an added bonus, the snapshot can be mounted and modified (provided you have root privileges) and the \"frozen\" state can be updated if needed.\n\n\nProof of concept: Freeze everything except for one partition from a clean install\nThe installation:\n\n*\n\n*Boot from a live Ubuntu disc/USB and choose the option to \"Try Ubuntu without installing.\" This is important for manually configuring partitions with LVM\n\n\n*When Ubuntu loads partition your disk using the tool of your choice so that it has one partition that takes up the whole space of the drive. Here's what I'm working with:\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda (size 1T)\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda1 (size 1T)\n\n\n\n\n\n*Next in a terminal set up LVM on /dev/sda1. I'm going to put most of the system on a single partition, but you wouldn't have to.\nsudo pvcreate /dev/sda1\nsudo vgcreate ubuntu-vg /dev/sda1\nsudo lvcreate -n swap -L 1G ubuntu-vg\nsudo lvcreate -n unfrozen -L 10G ubuntu-vg\nsudo lvcreate -n root -l +50%free ubuntu-vg\n\n\n\n*Now if you were to run sudo vgs followed by sudo lvs you should be able to see that the amount of free space left in the volume group \"ubuntu-vg\" (VFree under vgs output) is equal to the amount of space taken by the logical volume \"root\" (LSize under lvs output). In my case, I have 506.44g free in ubuntu-vg and my root partition is 506.44g large. If the free space left in the volume group is equal to the the size of the partition I want to freeze, I should be able to wipe out the entire partition and still be able to recover with a reboot. Leave the rest of the free space in ubuntu-vg unused for now. We'll be using it later.\n\n\n*Now install Ubuntu using manual partitioning\n\n\n\n*When install is finished, go ahead and reboot into the newly installed system.\n\n\n*Once booted into your new system, configure it so that it is exactly the way you want it to be when the computer boots each time.\n\n*\n\n*If you don't accidental changes to the snapshot, and you don't want the snapshot partition to show up in the menu bar...\n\n*\n\n*mkdir /steady\n\n*Edit /etc/fstab by adding (this is all one line) /dev/ubuntu-vg/steadystate    /steady ext4    defaults,ro,nofail  0   1 as the last line of the file\n\n\n\n*Since things like updates will get blown away with each reboot, you may want to turn them off.\n\n*If you have an unfrozen partition like mine at /unfrozen, don't forget to make it accessible to users who need access to it\n\n\n\n*Once you have the system configured exactly the way you want it, create the following script (you'll need root privileges) and save as /root/steadystate.sh with your favorite editor. Note that if you changed the volume group name when setting up LVM, you'll need to update that in the script below as well.\n#!/bin/bash\nLOG=/dev/kmsg\n\n# wait for merge in progress\necho -n \"Reverting to snapshot if present... \" | tee -a $LOG\nmerging=1\nwhile [ \"$merging\" == \"1\" ];\ndo\n    /usr/sbin/service lightdm stop #prevent the auto-login/login screen from loading\n    [ \"$(sudo lvs -a | grep steadystate)\" == \"\" ] && merging=0\n    sleep 1\ndone\n\n# create snapshot\necho -n \"Creating new snapshot... \" | tee -a $LOG\n/sbin/lvcreate -s -n steadystate -l +100%free /dev/ubuntu-vg/root\n\n# make sure root comes online before trying to merge\nwhile [ ! -e /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-root];\ndo\n    sleep .5;\ndone\necho -n \"Scheduling reset to snapshot... \" | tee -a $LOG\n/sbin/lvconvert --merge /dev/ubuntu-vg/steadystate\n\necho -n \"Starting lightdm... \" | tee -a $LOG\n/usr/sbin/service lightdm start\n\n\n\n*Finally run sudo crontab -e, select an editor and put @reboot /bin/bash /root/steadystate.sh at the end of the file. Save and close (Ctrl + X; answer Y to save)\n\n\n*Reboot, and you should have a system that is frozen except for the partition mounted at /unfrozen\nThis works because the snapshot is created at boot time, and even though we pass the command to merge the snapshot right after that, the snapshot can't be merged while the logical volume for root is active. It therefore postpones the merge action until the next time /dev/ubuntu-vg/root is activated which is at the next reboot. This action would also be triggered if the system was booted from a live USB.\nJust for kicks, I went in after a reboot and ran sudo apt remove --purge firefox* libreoffice-* unity* which I would not normally advise doing because it removes some useful programs and puts the system in what might be a less than desirable state!\n\nThe system wouldn't even shutdown properly from the GUI. So how does one fix this? Reboot!\n\nUpon rebooting, everything was back in order. Firefox, LibreOffice, and Unity were all back where they belonged.\nI also tried removing Linux*. This left the machine unable to boot, however, simply booting from a live Ubuntu disk seemed to make the merge take place. Restarting again left the system in its \"frozen\" state.\nIf you wanted to be able to make changes, you could (re)mount the snapshot with rw privileges and then chroot to it and make any changes that you want to remain permanent. This isn't flawless, but it's a proof of concept.\n\nA: By default Ubuntu and most other Unices deny regular users (students, guests) write access to system files. Only an administrator with the proper authorisation (username and key) can install software, change system settings, or delete partitions.\nRegular users can, by default, only write in their home directory and the system's temporary directory. A common way to handle one-time guest sessions is to put their home directory inside the temp directory, and the temp directory in main memory.\nIf you want to make extra sure, mount the system partition read-only and lay an aufs partition over it that stores changes in main memory.\n\nA: fsprotect\nfsprotect is a set of scripts that protect existing filesystems. fsprotect is excellent for public computers like those in libraries, internet cafés, etc.\nUsing aufs they pack a tmpfs filesystem forcing changes to be written to the tmpfs filesystem.\nThe root filesystem is protected by an initramfs script. Other filesystems are protected by an init script. All protected filesystems become read-only ensuring their immutability even on power-offs.\nTo install fsprotect in all currently supported versions of Ubuntu open the terminal and type:\nsudo apt install fsprotect\n\nThe benefits of using fsprotect are:\n\n*\n\n*Filesystems are protected and no change is ever written to the disk.\n\n*Protected filesystems are mounted read-only. This means that they aren't damaged when the computer is turned off improperly.\n\n*It is very easy to use.\n\n*In some cases it makes the filesystem access faster.\n\nThe drawbacks of using fsprotect are:\n\n*\n\n*Filesystem changes cannot be more than a predefined limit in bytes (set by you).\n\n*Since tmpfs is heavily used, you need to have adequate swap space.\n\n", "Q: Using ubuntu hotspot and squid I've installed a second wireless card on my laptop.\nUsing the hotspot function on Ubuntu 13.04, I'm able to share the internet connection with my pupils (they have no login for the wireless network).\nI've also installed squid, but I had to set the proxy manually on my test tablet. \n\n\n*\n\n*How do I load the proxy automatically on connecting clients?\n\n\nThe proxy is transparent for the moment, but I want a certain control.I think I can find out how to block certain domains myself, but I want to be able to block sites at my lessons too.\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I block domains on the fly?\n\n\nRelated to this, I would like to cut off internet access and let them return to my local host at any time, for instance to wrap up the lesson before the bell.\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I redirect them to my local web server, on the fly?\n\n\nIf the pupils are busy, I want to use the projector to show a constant flow of fetched URLs, so they can help each other and I can keep a lookout while walking amongst them.

I've set up multiple monitors in xfce per this answer, but my secondary monitor was chosen as the main one. How do I change which monitor is the main one?\n\nA: If you have a Nvidia based video card you can use the Nvidia X Server Settings(if you don't have it, you can install it from the synaptic package manager, I think it's called \"nvidia-settings-304\" in there) \nIn the X server Display Configuration of Nvidia X Server Settings window you should be able to see all the monitors, change the resolution set the Hz of them. but what's important is that you should see a check box setting stating \"Make this the primary display for the X screen\". I'm not too sure what the X screen is exactly(I'm not exactly a \"rocket scientist\" when it comes to computers.) but I know this is what from experience is pretty much what sets the \"primary monitor\". So basically what ever monitor you have set as the X screen is pretty much the computers \"primary\" screen and usually denotes what monitor fullscreen games will launch on.\nBut be warned, some desktop environments like Unity have some less than desirable consequences when setting the X screen to the desired monitor.\nJust to let you know, just from previous experience, Unity's launcher can only be on the monitor that is set as the primary display for the x screen. Other desktop environments/shells can also suffer from this problem as their \"default\" panels and whatnot will jump to another screen if you change what screen is the primary X screen. But I found this to not be as much of a problem as with Unity since most other desktop environments are more flexible with their customization and usually allow users to add panels and whatnot(or could possibly simply allow you to move them like you can with Xfce) on the position and screen you desire or remove them if they are where you don't want them to be.\n\nA: From a superuser thread about xfce and primary monitor locations and [this long thread on xfce.org] -- It is a known xfce bug #8328 since 2012 and still open 2014-02.\nSuggested workarounds by @pokeeffe include manually moving the panels, believing everyday is opposite day, or fixing the bug in xfce.\n\nA: Have you tried installing ARANDR?

However, upon rebooting, any changes I've made to resolv.conf are erased and the file is blank (except for the comment that warns me of exactly that).\nAs a result, I'm unable to resolve hostnames (ping google.com fails, for example).

Then add your desired IP and DNS settings in the boxes provided.\nYou should then revert any edits to your /etc/network/interfaces file (so that it contains only the lo definition lines) and either restart both the networking and network-manager services or reboot the machine.\nYou should also make sure that the chosen static IP address is outside the DHCP pool assigned by your router - in fact, you may find it simpler to keep a DHCP configuration on the machine, and reserve a particular IP for it on the router, if it supports DHCP address reservation.\nIf you really want to keep the GUI network-manager, but define your interface via /etc/network/interfaces, then you could try editing /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf, changing\n[ifupdown]\nmanaged=false\n\nto\n[ifupdown]\nmanaged=true\n\nand then making sure there are no other competing connections defined in the /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/ directory (where 'competing' means 'using the same interface as'). This should allow you to see and control the connections in /etc/network/interfaces under the GUI network-manager applet.\nAlternatively you could remove the network-manager package altogether.\n\nA: You need to add your DNS configuration directly on /etc/network/interfaces:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n    address 192.168.0.64\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n    network 192.168.0.0\n    broadcast 192.168.0.255\n    gateway 192.168.0.1\n    dns-nameservers 192.168.0.1 8.8.8.8\n\n", "Q: How do I set WINE as default to run specific program I am very new to ubuntu/linux.

I am confortable with the 12.04 version. However, this could help. \nWhen you right-click on the .exe file, you go to \"Open with application with\", then you select WINE. Sometimes, like your case, it appears to be that the application is not available. So, you choose the option where you find the wine executable for Linux (which must be located at \\usr\\bin\\wine. \nIf this doesn't work, got into the system settings, then got into the general settings tab, then on the applications tab, I think you can choose your app at the same way. \nIf these don't work, tell me and I will try it myself with screenshots (but from Debian: don't be afraid, Ubuntu is a Debian based operating system).

When I try to start it I see:\n$ pulseaudio --start\nE: [autospawn] core-util.c: Home directory /home/user not ours.\nW: [autospawn] lock-autospawn.c: Cannot access autospawn lock.\nE: [pulseaudio] main.c: Failed to acquire autospawn lock\n\nalso...\nsudo start-pulseaudio-x11 \nFailed to create secure directory: Permission denied\nConnection failure: Connection refused\npa_context_connect() failed: Connection refused\n\nTrying to run pavucontrol gives me:\nConnection to PulseAudio failed\n\nThe AlsaMixer seems to be working. I don't know much about it, but if I open up the GUI and mess around it does seem to control my regular speakers.  \nI have reinstalled pulseaudio and pavucontrol and this doesn't seem to help.  \nI either need to figure out how to get pulse audio started, or bypass it (in order to use this headset). \n\nA: The issue, as mentioned in the comments, was the fact that the home directory was owned by root.  I was unable change the owner of the home directory using sudo chown -R user /home/user because the home directory was mounted on a different hard drive with an NTFS filesystem.\nI backed up my home directory with Deja Dup to an external drive.  Then used gparted to format the internal NTFS drive and change the filesystem to EXT4.  \nNext I changed /etc/fstab to match the new UUID of the drive and changed \"ntfs\" to \"ext4\".  \nAfter restart, I had to press Ctrl+Alt+F1 to login in a terminal.  I was there able to use sudo chown -R user:user /home/user.\nI was then able to login to the GUI, and restore my home directory using Deja Dup and the backup on my external drive.\nPulseAudio is working perfectly now. \n", "Q: apt-get update error failed to fetch I have a problem with apt-get update.

All of them was unable to fulfil the task of removing the automatically installed packages/dependencies.\nMy question is, where is the problem?\n\nA: The problem is that you still have packages pending, apt-get tries to remove the less amount of packages possibles also if some other package has an \"indirect\" dependencies it will not work as you will be expecting. Some of them might even has circular dependencies that prevent them from being uninstalled. Also that repo seems doggy enough to don't trust it.\nIf you use aptitude instead and ask why of each package you will detect where it's is the dependency holding the package.\nI recommend you reading my other answer about how apt-get considers dependencies as required. You can also use apt-cache rdepends package to find the reverse dependencies but aptitude seems more streamlined and easier to use.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://askubuntu.com/a/346097/169736\n", "Q: How to update aria2 to latest version 1.18?

I want to connect a phone(otg capable) that allows USB audio to laptop and play music so that it comes out of laptop speakers. More generally, Is it possible for a USB host to act as a USB peripheral?\nThanks.\n\nA: I can't imagine a way this would be viable. Even on a hardware level, both ends are fighting to be host. It won't even handshake let alone enter into some sort of dialogue where the sound is sent to the right place.\nI can think of a few alternatives:\n\n\n*\n\n*Software on the phone to send the sound over wifi (various vnc servers, ArkMC, Airplay, etc)\n\n*A bluetooth receiver (A2DP) the phone connects to, line out into laptop\n\n*A USB DAC/sound card plugged into the phone in OTG mode. This relies on the phone being able to use an external sound card.\n\n*A male-to-male 3.5mm jack cable.\n\n", "Q: How to Tell Dash to look for music on other NTFS partitions? All my songs and videos are present in NTFS partition, as a result whenever i search for music in dash it results nothing. So how do i tell dash to look for content in specific folder rather than looking only in home folder.\n\nA: Add your music to your player's library.\nI think this question is very similar to this one.  The Unity music lens uses different Scopes - Banshee by default, I gather - to provide results.  This is part of the lens spec.  Banshee ONLY provides music results that are inside its library, so anything else won't show up.\nIn any event, for ease-of-use, I'd recommend creating a symlink to your NTFS partition inside your music folder:\nln -s /path/to/NTFS/music ~/Music/External.  This way, Banshee'll see that music as existing inside your Music directory, as will any other player you use.\nEdit: Just found a duplicate - here.  Answers are quite similar.\n", "Q: anybody tried and got Dark Souls working on wine? I bought Dark souls on sale from steam and I looked on Wine's website to confirm it is playable.

All are Ubuntu 12.04 Server LTS, and I am restricted from using port 21 externally at the remote site.\nWell.. Ok, I confess, it's myself who is imposing the restriction.  I just wanted to sound like I was working for a real company.  Anyway, only 1 of the 3 systems could have been assigned to 21, so it would still be an issue.\nI have tried the solutions for adding \"pasv_...\" lines, but I still cannot get past the LIST stage of connecting.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4723023/vsftpd-error-listing-directories\n\n*http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-server-73/vsftpd-error-failed-to-retrieve-directory-listing-878838/\n\n*https://serverfault.com/questions/421161/how-to-configure-vsftpd-to-work-with-passive-mode\n\n*http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-networking-3/vsftpd-cannot-list-files-but-can-change-dirs-519340/\nSo, having failed that, what might the problem be?\nI read on this site that I need to forward ports 20 and 21.  Right now the remote sites have ports like 10000, 11000, 12000 forwarded to the internal port 21 on each of the systems.  Should I forward some additional ports in to 20? it doesn't make sense because that port isn't even open, vsftpd is only listening on 21.\nAll I want is for a successful ftp connection through these forwarded ports, I am frustrated because I have successfully forwarded for services like SSH, apache2, etc and I don't get what is broken here.\nthx Joren for correcting my formatting!\n\nEDIT: I have been messing around with my testing VPS which is directly exposed to the internet, I installed vsftpd just to see what happens, and the output of 'netstat -tuna' shows that a successful connection from my filezilla client looks like this:\ntcp        0      0 vps.vps.vps.vps:21       fi.le.zil.la:54288      ESTABLISHED\ntcp        0      0 vps.vps.vps.vps:46403    fi.le.zil.la:54289      TIME_WAIT\n\nNote: the FTP server at my VPS also didn't work at first, due to a completely unrelated issue involving virtualized environments (\"500 OOPS: priv_sock_get_cmd\").  Read: I am starting to see that Ubuntu's vsftpd doesn't work 'out-of-the-box' like apache2 and sshd do, for any frustrated novice sysadmins out there, don't think you're stupid if it isn't working first thing...\nMy testing VPS doesn't have a firewall, so all ports are directly available for access by the FTP daemon.  After running this test, I see that it is possible that this secondary connection is being blocked at the remote site where I'm having issues (random ports such as 46403).\nAt least now I have confirmed that there are no NAT issues with my Filezilla, because clearly filezilla is opening random ports and talking with my VPS ok.\nThe one thing that makes no sense, is the config 'connect_from_port_20=YES' is set on my VPS FTP config, yet I can't see any connections using port 20!!!  This is why I don't even know if this port needs to be forwarded behind a firewall.\nOne of my knowledge deficiencies is I don't even know what port 20 does, and I can't learn through experience because I've never seen any indication the port is ever used duing connecting, downloading or uploading.\n\nOK, I found some problems (there's clearly more then one thing wrong) - This has to do with port forwarding.\nSuspect original problem (before customizing vsftpd.conf)\n\n\n*\n\n*Filezilla initially connects to remote port 10000, ==> goes to 21 on internal FTP server (ok)\n\n*FTP server opens a random port (NOT 20) like 45678, but the router obviously doesn't have a rule for this randomly assigned port.  It sends a message telling filezilla to also connect to 45678.\n\n*Filezilla client opens up its own port on my end behind NAT(ok)\n\n*Filezilla sends connection request to 45678, but the remote router doesn't accept the connection, as there is no forwarding rule for that port.\n\n\nNow, the problem(s) I created:\npasv_enable=YES\npasv_min_port=10000\npasv_max_port=10000\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Filezilla connects to remote port 10000, ==> goes to 21 on internal FTP server (ok)\n\n*FTP server opens the only port it can, 10000, [stupid moment] because I have that port in my head associated with that system.  But 10000 is actually the WAN side counterpart for 21 on this system.  Server sends a message for FileZilla to connect to 10000, and listens internally on 10000\n\n*Filezilla client opens up its own random port on my end (ok)\n\n*Filezilla tries the secondary connection at port 10000, the remote router deflects it to port 21 again where it must be ignored or lost, while the FTP server waits for a connection to internal port 10000 that never arrives.

If you try to use the internal port, the client will run up against the router.  If you try to specifiy the external port, the router will deflect the incoming connection to a different number -- which the server was not expecting.\n\nI will test a solution and report back here with the results.\nI think, because the FTP server protocol appears to tell the client which port to connect to, that secondary connection MUST have the same external port number as internal.\nI will call this a 'secondary connection' and I think it has something to do with the port 20 thing that I don't understand.\nSo, I will contact the remote site and have an additional port forwarded directly, so the FTP server can open a connection internally, and the client will be able to send a connection request to that exact port number.\nNew plan:\n(note: the '%' is meant to show the port getting changed by the remote router.)\n \n\nserver #1\n    primary connection: 21 <--%--> 10000 \n    secondary connection 10001 <-----> 10001\n    vsftp.conf:\n        pasv_min_port=10001\n        pasv_max_port=10001\n\nserver #2\n    primary connection 21 <--%--> 11000\n    secondary connection 11001 <-----> 11001\n    vsftp.conf:\n        pasv_min_port=11001\n        pasv_max_port=11001\n\nserver #3\n    primary connection 21 <--%--> 12000\n    secondary connection 12001 <-----> 12001\n    vsftp.conf:\n        pasv_min_port=12001\n        pasv_max_port=12001\n\n\nA: My router (fritz.box, germany) had to be configured unlocking the higher ports in same wa outgoing as ingoing!\n(above: this \"pasv_min.. and ...max\" here inserted/prescribed by debian-vsftpd):\nAdding a range of unblocked ports in the Fritz!Box-Router with the corresponding button:\n  \"Other Applications\" ->\n    \"Portokoll\": TCP, von Port: 13450, bis Port: 13500 (or high-ports within a range ~50),\n    \"an Computer\": RasPi, \"an IP_Adresse\": (outgreyed, the internal LAN-IP-Adress for my \n     \"RasPi\" given by the fritz.box-router) -> and here it comes:\n     \"an Port\" (=the same range!): 13450, \"bis Port\": 13450, and this is working fine with\n     vsftpd and FTPS (AUTH TLS / SSL-Tranfer with OpenSSL + strong DES-CBC3-SHA cipher)...\nThis will forward the right ports and connect requests from and to my little RasPi-\"Server\" (behind the F.B.-NAT) to the incomig/outgoing external IP-request ON THE SAME RANGE OF HIGH(ER)-PORTS, like right-connected \"cables\" to the same ports on the internal part...\nA possible vsftp-config-file \"/etc/vsftpd.conf\":\nlisten=YES\nanonymous_enable=NO\nlocal_enable=YES\nwrite_enable=YES\ndirmessage_enable=YES\nuse_localtime=YES\nxferlog_enable=YES\nconnect_from_port_20=YES\nsecure_chroot_dir=/var/run/vsftpd/empty\npam_service_name=vsftpd\nforce_dot_files=YES\n\nssl_enable=YES\nforce_local_data_ssl=NO\nforce_local_logins_ssl=NO\nallow_anon_ssl=NO\nssl_tlsv1=YES\nssl_sslv2=NO\nssl_sslv3=NO\n# rsa_cert_file=/etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.pem   # not working alright, so single-lined:\nrsa_cert_file=/etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.crt\nrsa_private_key_file=/etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.key\n\npasv_enable=YES\n# pasv_promiscuous=YES\n# port_promiscuous=YES\npasv_addr_resolve=YES\npasv_address=[yourDNSadress.no-ip.com] # for Dynamic-DNS the routers daily changing IP.\n# port_enable=YES\npasv_min_port=13450\npasv_max_port=13500\nfile_open_mode=0755\n\n\nA: In my case our firewall blocked all passive FTP ports, when we tried FTP using active mode it worked.

Especially when an identical system can be substituted.\nI can boot off an install image (actually 13.04) and run efibootmgr - it doesn't show a Linux/Ubuntu entry for that disk. A simple efibootmgr -d /dev/sdb -c made no difference.\nMotherboard is an Intel DQ77KB.\n\nA: I know for example about grub and UUID's for harddisks. I just learned they are generated differently on another Mainboard if what i was reading is true. So you need to replace the UUIDS for your harddisks in /etc/fstab with the actual divices /dev/sd* most likely.\nYou could look into the outputs of this and figure out how to put the new UUID's in if they changed\nsudo fdisk -l\nsudo blkid\ncat /etc/fstab\n\nShow us the output of this if your stuck. Also look into custom grub files if you have any then do a update-grub on the disk after you mounted it. You might need to chroot on that disk as well. Or run some grub repair stuff from the livecd or use superbootdisk/supergrubdisk? or something like that. But i am not sure if they are fixing the fstab.\nWhy would you expect that everything just works fine? Ubuntu is configured to that old main-board and probably need to be configured in a different way for the new one.\nA live CD/DVD will probably work because it detects hardware on boot without loading any specific settings.\nI would just backup the old system, and install a fresh ubuntu, and overwrite some settings from the old system (maybe just the entire home folder and something in /etc ...)\n\nA: UEFI machines have two boot mechanisms: 1) NVRAM has a list of choices for the internal hard disk and 2)Removable media, which uses /EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi.  You can add your Ubuntu to the NVRAM by running grub-install again (check the man page for switches for your specific situation, --uefi***something (secure boot for instance).  And/Or  copy grubx64.efi/shim.efi\n(depending on if you use secure boot) to /EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi.  If you had been using the disk to boot before, it should still work with the same uuids (which are filesystem dependent, and you have the same filesystems).\n\n\n\nYou can avoid using any NVRAM by setting up an EFI partition on a USB boot device, with a grub using the hard disk installation.  Another \"fallback\" boot mechanism is to set up the /EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi on the hard disk as shim, and put a copy of grubx64.efi there too.  Then under some conditions, when a boot fails, that is attempted before the next entry in the boot order. \n", "Q: What constructive work can be done from spare 64 bit Ubuntu System I have some Ubuntu x86_64 system lying around.

I noticed this when I was watching a video and it started lagging just before until shortly after a download finished. The second time I monitored it using top and the cpu rises above 100%.\nMy processor isn't a slow one (Intel Core i7-3630QM Quad Core), and the \"average\" CPU usage of Transmission is 3% - 4%. \nI was wondering what the cause of this curiosity is and what I could do about it (besides using another bit-torrent client).\n\nA: Generally when ever you are trying to watch a video , your video player will take some time to load the required libraries to play the video and video can be played properly after proper decoding. So what ever the short lagging you are feeling due to Loading of video libraries and decoding of your video to play.\nwhile doing the any data operations CPU will consume its maximum free memory. So when ever your Transmission had completed the download it needs to check the data before displaying the status as Completed.\nI think for those two situations that explanation can help you to understand the issue,:)\n\nA: My guess is the same reason deluge (another torrent client) does the same thing. When it finishes a download, it uses hash algorithms to check the files integrity and make sure the downloaded file is fine. In other words, it checks the file downloaded is 100% the same than in the other clients.\nHashing is a CPU expensive process, specially if we're dealing with larger files. In my case a have an intel i3 (not top of the line, but a fairly good CPU) and it takes about 1 minute per GB to check. It may also depend on the amount of files, since the hashing is done par file (if you have a few GB of many small archives it would take longer).\nI wouldn't worry about it, it's a nice feature of the bittorrent protocol and it doesn't pay disabling it (you may end up with non working isos and broken video files).\nHope it helps. \n\nA: Most computers these days use CPU interrupts for the disk controller.  When Transmission is finishing a transfer all the unwritten parts of the file(s) are then written to disk all at the same time.  This uses more CPU as the disk gets super busy doing all those writes.\n", "Q: Rename files numerically (date/time order) I have 200 files in a folder.

It will sort the files based on the time they were last modified, rather than their actual creation time, because Ubuntu doesn't store the creation time of files. So if you've modified the files since you downloaded them, you won't get an accurate ordering.\nn=0; ls -tr | while read i; do n=$((n+1)); mv -- \"$i\" \"$(printf '%03d' \"$n\")\"_\"$i\"; done\n\nls -tr sorts files by modification time, oldest first (and when you pipe the output of ls it automatically lists files one-per-line rather than the standard way of doing things -- it should be noted that this is a GNU-ism, if you have to work on another *nix with a different version of ls, this might not be the case). while read i takes that list and goes over each item one at a time, and the rest of it does the actual renaming.\nn=$((n+1)) increments the variable $n by one. There could be problems if this had been set beforehand, so to be on the safe side you should set it to 0 at the beginning of the line.\n$(printf '%03d' \"$n\") prints the number contained in the variable $n, padded to three zeros (so 001, 002 ... 087 ... 999).

You need to at least also install the vim-common and vim-runtime packages.\nThere's also a GUI version of Vim, the package name is vim-gnome.\n\nA: I think the vi come with Ubuntu12.04 is vim tiny or something like that which is not fully featured one. You can install it offline, get a deb package for vim and copy it to your machine, use dpkg -i your_deb_package.\n\nA: The vi command is available by default on every UNIX-y operating system, including Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\nOn Debian-based systems like Ubuntu, vi is not the original vi but a lightweight Vim build that usually lacks a few useful features like clipboard or scripting support.\nYou are not very clear about the \"problem\" that \"occurs\". Without more information, we can't do much more than provide generic advices.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you are really unable to install/update your programs your only solution is to customize your Vim config as well as you could. Run the following command in a terminal emulator:\n$ touch ~/.vimrc\n\nYou should now be able to use the vim command with saner defaults. After that, you are on your own for the rest of the learning curve.\n\n*If you are able to update/install programs, use the Synaptic package manager or apt-get to install the vim-gnome or vim-gtk package which are much more complete than the default build.\nOnce the installation is complete, create a ~/.vimrc like above and enjoy the ride.\n", "Q: Where are my local webserver pages?

Or, when I simply move the cursor to a location, when I release my finger from the touchpad, the cursor jumps a few pixels in a random direction.\nThis is a pain when I'm trying to resize windows or click small buttons especially, as a) it makes it difficult to even get on the very edge of the window to change the window size and b) even if I do, the moment I try to tap click, the cursor jumps away.\nI know that in Windows, the touchpad drivers have some \"forgiveness\" towards very slight movement. I don't know how to emulate that on Ubuntu.\nThanks!\n\nA: Try creating the file .xinputrc in your home folder and paste this into it:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nSYN=\"SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\"\nxinput set-prop \"$SYN\" \"Synaptics Noise Cancellation\" 26 26\n\nThis doesn't totally eliminate the problem, but for me, it corrects it substantially.\nMaybe type xinput list to make sure your device is called exactly \"SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad.\" Set the SYN variable in the script to whatever your touchpad is named.\n\nA: Yes, I have the same problem with my Lenovo Y480's touchpad. The sensitivity seems to be quite high and the mouse cursor jumps around making it hard to left and right click or especially double click.\nI've tried playing with ubuntu's system settings, the keyboard and mouse configuration app, and the pointing devices app to no avail. The best solution I've found is to enable tapping which makes left clicks much easier.\n\nA: That's also a key problem I've got with my Lenovo L540 touchpad. CaptSaltyJack's suggestion is a step in the right direction, but it does not solve the problem completely, as the actual issue is not entirely related to the noise cancellation level.\nRegarding proposed changes to ~/.xinputrc I would suggest to follow im-config's manual, so:\n\nIf you wish to create a custom configuration beyond what im-config can do for you, please copy one of these initialization code  files into ~/.xinputrc or /etc/X11/xinit/xinputrc  and edit it to suite your need.\n\nThus, if your ~/.xinputrc file exists already and it looks for example like this:\n# im-config(8) generated on Fri, 29 Aug 2014 01:03:28 +0200\nrun_im ibus\n# im-config signiture: 4218b16da65755f61e0673872943d12e  -\n\nthen you may consider to replace its contents with:\n############################################################\n# Paste /usr/share/im-config/data/20_ibus.rc contents HERE #\n############################################################\n\nSYN=\"SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\"\nxinput set-prop \"$SYN\" \"Synaptics Noise Cancellation\" 26 26\n\nBecause ~/.xinputrc is sourced by im-config, it doesn't have to be given neither a shebang (#!/bin/sh) at the beginning nor to be executable.\nIf you want to verify if you changes are applied properly on startup, just check the output of:\nxinput --list-props \"SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\" | grep -i noise\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu Minimal + WICD Help So I installed Ubuntu Minimal, Xfce4, and just a few applications.

It looks like that is your Ubuntu installation so you could create that as a big data area for Ubuntu. You can even mount it as your /home partition. Having a separate home partition can be helpful when upgrading. \nTo add the partition to sda4:\nSelect sda4 and extend it to the end of the drive. Now the 753GB of unallocated space in inside your extended partition sda4. Now you can format it to ext4 and you have yourself another partition (most likely labeled sda7). You can access this partition by mounting it.\nTo mount new partition:\nmake a directory to mount it cd ~ && mkdir bigData\nIn Ubuntu terminal type gksudo gedit /etc/fstab\nIn this file add the line: /dev/sda7 /home/<username>/bigData ext4 defaults 0  0 \nNow this partition will automatically be mounted when the system starts.\nTo mount it without restarting the system type mount /dev/sda7\nIf your not a fan of that solution your only other option is some serious rearranging which could cause errors and prevent your system from booting.

So I ask:\nHow do I completely uninstall git from my Ubuntu Desktop 12.04 machine?\nWhen I run which git I get:\n/usr/bin/git\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: you can use this command:\nsudo apt-get remove git\n\n\nA: Your personal settings for your user related to git are usually stored in ~/.git which is the .git folder in your /home/$USER folder.\nJust remove ~/.gitconfig and your settings will return to a pristine, unconfigured state.\nif you REALLY want to remove git completely and start over which you don't really need to do ever, do the above statements to remove the .git folder, then do: sudo apt-get purge git; sudo apt-get autoremove; sudo apt-get install git\n\nA: Reinstalling git with\nsudo apt-get install git\n\nwill usually fix most installation issues.\n\nA: I faced the similar issue when another git client was installed on my ubuntu 18.04 LTS without my  with a different path :\nPATH=/home/pradan/ti-processor-sdk-linux-am57xx-evm-06.02.00.81/linux-devkit/sysroots/x86_64-arago-linux/usr/bin:...other variables...:/snap/bin\n\nTo remove it, the PATH VARIABLE needs to be changed. Changing the path can be seen in this question How can I edit the $PATH on linux?\nThen, the git files in the same directory can be deleted.\n\nA: To remove just git package itself from Ubuntu execute on terminal:\nsudo apt-get remove git\nUninstall git and it's dependent packages\nsudo apt-get remove --auto-remove git\nfrom here\n", "Q: Why there is a delay between when a key is pressed and when it is accepted? This is one of the wackiest and weirdest problems I have ever encountered. My keyboard was working absolutely fine untill yesterday on Ubuntu 13.04. However, when I boot to Ubuntu today, I suddenly find that all the keys work, but I have to press and keep on holding them for about a second for them to work.\n\n\n*\n\n*This behavior is true for all the keys except for Num Lock, Caps Lock and Scroll Lock keys, the indicator for them on my keyboard lights up as soon as I press those keys.\n\n*The keyboard works fine at the login screen where I put my password. \n\n*The keyboard also works normally if I use the Guest session instead of my normal user account.\n\n*I have not done any key-remappings and using the standard English (US) keyboard layout. \n\n*I have fiddled around with the settings for Keyboard in System Settings, but to no avail.\n\n*I have Windows 7 as dual-boot and the keyboard works perfectly well on it.\nWhy am I facing such a behavior and how to normalize this?\nPS: Using Logitech Classic Keyboard K100 (USB Model).\n\nA: I had a similar problem. I stumbled on the answer while trying the solution here. Somehow the screen reader was turned on, and this was causing erratic behavior. Check it under System Settings → Universal Access → Seeing. Make sure the Screen Reader is set to OFF.\nScreen Reader OFF\n\nA: Because probably you put on the Slow Keys option from System Settings → Universal Access → Typing. Turn it off:\n\n\nA: Ubuntu has apparently mirrored the \"slow keys\" functionality in Windows, and by default set this up so it's enabled by holding down Shift key for too long automatically turns on this setting!\nThe appearance of this setting in recent years has been driving many people nuts, and the habit of holding down Shift while thinking of what to type means that it's easy to turn on this setting by accident.\nThe accepted answer does not work anymore in latest version of Ubuntu, there is no \"Slow Keys\" option anymore in gnome-control-center.\nThe only way I've found to reliably disable this is via command line:\n# Get current value of keyboard accessibility (enabled = true , disabled = false)\ngsettings get org.gnome.desktop.a11y.keyboard enable\n# Get current value of slowkeys-enable\ngsettings get org.gnome.desktop.a11y.keyboard slowkeys-enable\n# Turn it off!\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.a11y.keyboard slowkeys-enable false\n\n# Get current value of stickykey-enable\ngsettings get org.gnome.desktop.a11y.keyboard stickykeys-enable\n# Turn it off!\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.a11y.keyboard stickykeys-enable false\n# Finally, turn the entire keyboard accessibility options off (this should disable the SHIFT key shortcuts)\ngsettings get org.gnome.desktop.a11y.keyboard enable false\n\n\nA: I can not post a proper answer with images and all cause I am on a windows only public computer right now but, try going to the keyboard settings and check to see if there is a key sensitivity setting, then maybe you can adjust it there...also try unplugging keyboard and then plugging it back in. Maybe this will reset it... Just suggestions!\nHope it helps... Good Luck!\n\nA: This could happen when there is a daemon program catching keystrokes (like onboard). As a trial, open gnome-system-monitorand look if there is any bash script or even python scripts running. Try closing onboard if it's running.\n\nA: I know that what I will recommend is almost the most easy and ugly solution out there:\nMove the .* directories to somewhere else:\nmkdir ~/backup\nmv ~/.config ~/.dbus ~/.gconf ~/backup/\n\nnow restart your session. The problem should have go away. If the issue goes away, you can restore back one by one the innocent with \ncp -nr ~/backup/.dbus ~/.dbus\n\nRestart the session, issue is there again? Remove the directory and copy instead one by one the contents of the subdirectories. Same with the other 2 directories.\ncp -nr ~/backup/.config ~/.config\ncp -nr ~/backup/.gconf ~/.gconf\n\nI know is quite brutish the method, but since I couldn't find the exact file/dconf/gconf/xinput that could cause this, a little quick hack should suffice.\n\nA: Another possible reason for delay while switching keyboard layout:\naccording to issue #1370953 (and #1370953), such behavior may be related to poor disk performance. See Maxim Kravets comment:\n\nEvery layout change alternates ~/.config/dconf/user file. Layout\nchange is slow when disk is busy.\n\nThere is one thing (not only one) to step over disk issue - to change disk queue scheduler. By default Ubuntu is configured to use the deadline scheduler, however for a slower HDD its better to use cfq scheduler instead.\nSee instruction.\n\nA: Inacceptable text entry lag might also have a completely different reason than the ones stated here (like Sticky Keys), and I found it:\nBy mistake I had the option 'Screen Magnifier' (Accessibility Options) switched on. That setting may slow texting down if you are running a low spec Netbook, like I do (ASUS X206HA)... It made me half crazy.\nWhen I switched the Magnifier off, everything is back to quick and smooth again.\n\nA: As described in the question, in the login screen I had no delay but in the window manager (awesome wm), there was an irregular keyboard lag (sometimes short/long delay). Before, I had put the following code in /etc/X11/xorg.conf\nSection \"Device\"\nIdentifier  \"Card0\"\nDriver      \"intel\"\nOption      \"Backlight\"  \"/sys/class/backlight\"\nEndSection\n\nto make xbacklight work. It turned out that the the above lines caused the keyboard delay in my case. \n\nA: TL&DR: Turn of Screen Reader through the Universal Access options in Ubuntu 20.04+.\nInstructions:\n\n*\n\n*Open the Activities overview and start typing \"Accessibility\".\n\n\n*Click Universal Access to open the menu.\n\n\n*Click Screen Reader in the Seeing section, then switch the Screen Reader setting on in the dialog.\nExplanation: The Screen Reader feature is really meant for those who have trouble reading, or are visually impaired. This has been shown to cause delays in keyboard presses.\n\nA: After much troubleshooting and trying all other solutions, I found one the possible problems: the Compton window manager. I suspect many others are seeing the same as this one and I have not seen this solution online yet.\nIf you are using xfce (i.e. XFCE) (or any other desktop that use compton), try disabling Compton.\nIn Mint, this is: Mint button > Session and Startup > Application Autostart tab > Untick Window Manager (Window Manager Startup)\nIf you hover your mouse over this option you will see that - at least for xfce - the command for this is xfce-autostart-wm. This file is located at /usr/bin/xfce-autostart-wm and happens to be a Python Script.\nIn this script, the command compton --backend glx --vsync opengl-swc is executed if your window manager is Compton.\nTo see what your configured Compton manager is, start python3 and do:\nimport sys\nimport os\nimport gettext\nimport subprocess\nimport gi\nfrom gi.repository import Gio\nsettings = Gio.Settings(\"com.linuxmint.desktop\")\nprint(settings.get_string(\"xfce-window-manager\"))\n\ni.e.\n/usr/bin$ python3\nPython 3\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> import sys\n>>> import os\n>>> import gettext\n>>> import subprocess\n>>> import gi\n>>> from gi.repository import Gio\n>>> settings = Gio.Settings(\"com.linuxmint.desktop\")\n>>> print(settings.get_string(\"xfce-window-manager\"))\nxfwm4-compton\n\nOnce I started compton --backend glx --vsync opengl-swc the key delay issue immediately starts happening.\nDisable Compton and see how you go. If you use XFCE the following script update (sudo vi /usr/bin/xfce-autostart-wm) may suffice:\n    #subprocess.Popen([\"compton\", \"--backend\", \"glx\", \"--vsync\", \"opengl-swc\"])\n    subprocess.Popen([\"compton\", \"--backend\", \"glx\", \"--vsync\", \"opengl-swc\", \"--xrender-sync\", \"--xrender-sync-fence\"])\n\nAround line 33.\nBug here: https://github.com/chjj/compton/issues/255\n", "Q: Why Ubuntu 12.10 doesn't recognize my graphic card? In Settings, Ubuntu says my graphic card is unknown :\n\nThe command lspci | grep VGA gives me this :\n\nWhy ?\n\nA: The System Information panel in the system settings is not getting the value from the hardware, as lspci does, but is getting information from the userspace drivers for Xorg and OpenGL. As a result, depending on which drivers are being used, the requisite information it uses may not be available. In this case, it defaults to displaying Unknown rather than the name or type of your graphics card.\nMore accurately, the panel tells you what graphics system you are using, and not what graphics card you have.\n\nA: lspci gives you a list of devices and their descriptions as reported by the device itself.\nThe Settings dialogue involvesthe systems  own checking of the signatures of the graphics cards recognised in its own database, quite independent of this description.  This database may be incomplete, and may not include variant cards, but really is not that important.\nYou may find that once you install proprietary drivers, that suddenly the card is recognised. The install may need some changes to your[ \\[boot parameters\\]][1]...critical appears to be ensure [nomodeset][2] parameter is used\n\n", "Q: Screen shuts off when using proprietary NVidia drivers As soon as I install the proprietary NVidia driver on my laptop (even after a fresh Kubuntu install), I start to experience random screen failures, that is, the screen suddenly shuts off, the backlight is still on, but the display is black, and trying to switch tty changes nothing.\nHaving skimmed through Xorg.log, I couldn't find any error or warning that could be related (but then, I am no expert), but there are some 200 NULL (^@) chars at the end, and I don't know if it is normal.\nI have no such problem when using nouveau, so I suspect it is a driver issue, not a physical one.\nI am using nvidia-current (so 304.88, but the issue occurs with every driver available in jockey, that is another 304 and two 319) on Kubuntu Saucy (but the issue occurs on Raring too) with a GeForce 8800M GTX.\nWhat should I do to make the proprietary drivers work?\n\nA: I had a similar issue when I upgraded my video card.  I was able fix this by blacklisting the nouveau driver as well as some other steps, similar to what @Ted suggested here.  Googling \"nouveau driver causes nvidia black screen\" yields an array of solutions.\n", "Q: zsh up-line-or-history does not work in gnome-terminal and tmux I use Ubuntu 13.04, zsh with oh-my-zsh and up-line-or-history is bind to up arrow (default settings of oh-my-zsh).

I know  ubuntu comes with one but I don't like the look and indenting of the text and how it responds. Thank to anyone who can help.\n\nA: I personnally had the same problem before. What i suggest to you, find text editor that suits best for you, kate sudo apt-get install kate suits for me, and then just mount the ftp location to the nautilus or whatever file explorer you are using, and open the file from there and save to the same place too.\nYou can mount ftp in this way easy: write to the file-explorer path ftp://yourdomain.com/folder/. Should ask you your credentials after that and mount your ftp destination.\nHope this helps! \n\nA: Emacs with web-mode is great for web development (in my opinion), and the key mappings are MUCH quicker and less strenuous than, for example, having to reach over to the arrow keys constantly.\nAlternatively, Kate from KDE is quite good and has syntax highlighting for PHP, ASP, HTML, JavaScript...\n", "Q: Bcm 4313 issue with Asus 1015e, Brcmsmac, Ubuntu 13.04 I've been hunting around here for about two weeks trying solutions to other people's BCM4313 problems, but none have worked.

When I run a process that links to a shared library at runtime (linked when the process starts, not linked later with dlload()), where does it look for that shared library (.so) file other than LD_LIBRARY_PATH?\nBackground:\nI have some C++ code that I wrote that uses a particular third-party library. I have installed the library and compiled my code on two different platforms, both Ubuntu but different versions, and different versions of gcc as well. The library was compiled and installed from source, and is located in /usr/local/lib on both platforms. When I compile my code, I link with the pkg-config --libs parameters for the third-party library and I've verified that pkg-config --libs returns the exact same thing on both platforms.\nMy code compiles successfully on both platforms, and LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not defined (or defined as empty: \"\") on both platforms. However, when I run it on one platoform it works fine, and on the other I get this error:\nerror while loading shared libraries: libthrift-0.9.0.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nFunnily enough, the ones that doesn't work is the newer version of Ubuntu and gcc.  :/\nSo I'm trying to figure out how the working one is able to locate the library, so that I can make the broken one locate the library in the same way. (i.e., without setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH)\nUpdate:\nHere's my output from cat /etc/ld.so.conf.d/*\n...on the working (older) system:\n/usr/lib/mesa\n/usr/lib32/mesa\n/usr/lib/alsa-lib\n# libc default configuration\n/usr/local/lib\n# Multiarch support\n/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu\n\n...on the broken (newer) system:\n# libc default configuration\n/usr/local/lib\n# Multiarch support\n/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/mesa\n\n\nA: The information contained in the above question AND first (and only ATT) answer, helped me resolve *a similar * issue of mine on WSL Ubuntu (on Win10 64)! \nIn my case the executable couldn't find a library. \nI ultimately noticed that the newly-made library got positioned in /usr/lib64 , but the multi-arch lines of /etc/ld.so.conf.d/x86_64-linux-gnu.conf  did not include that directory. \nSo I ran \nsudo ldconfig /usr/lib64\nand that finally fixed it.   (running it alone without the directory parameter did not make it 'magically' find the libraries BTW.)\nIt's unclear whether 'restarting' my WSL bash helped... I think that wasn't even needed.\n\nA: This whole path business is related to something called multi-arch.\nBasically it's to allow you to have 32bit and 64bit libraries on the same system.\nAfter you copied the file, did you happen to run ldconfig?\nldconfig  creates,  updates,  and removes the necessary links and cache\n       (for use by the run-time linker,  ld.so)  to  the  most  recent  shared\n       libraries  found  in  the directories specified on the command line, in\n       the file /etc/ld.so.conf, and in the trusted directories (/usr/lib  and\n       /lib).   ldconfig  checks the header and file names of the libraries it\n       encounters when determining which  versions  should  have  their  links\n       updated.  ldconfig ignores symbolic links when scanning for libraries.\n\n", "Q: samba question: share = user \n*\n\n*I am running Ubuntu 13.04 and Windows XP. \n\n*I am a samba newbie but was able to set this up on Ubuntu following the instructions posted here https://help.ubuntu.com/13.04/serverguide/samba-fileserver.html \n\n*My question is that although I can copy a word document to the share from linux, when I edit it in Word on Windows I cannot save and overwrite the file.

And don't touch partition of windows.\n", "Q: Building maven from source I'm trying to build maven from source (on Ubuntu 12.04) following the tutorial:\nhttp://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-building-m2.html\nI installed a previous version of maven using \nsudo apt-get install maven\n\nI then checked out maven using:\ngit clone https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/maven.git maven\n\nI then built maven using maven according to the apache guide, so I cd into the checkout version of maven and did:\nsudo mvn install\n\nthis seemed to work fine, no errors or anything, but when I do \nmvn -version\nMy output is:\nApache Maven 3.0.4\nMaven home: /usr/share/maven\nJava version: 1.7.0_40, vendor: Oracle Corporation\nJava home: /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0_40/jre\nDefault locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8\nOS name: \"linux\", version: \"3.5.0-37-generic\", arch: \"amd64\", family: \"unix\"\n\nWhich is not the version I checked out, it's the version of maven I got from apt-get. What exactly did mvn install do? Where did it install maven to, and how do I update the mvn command?\nI've been digging through the output of mvn-install . It seems it's creating jar files, for example, some of the outputs are:\n[INFO] Installing /opt/maven/maven-core/target/maven-core-3.1-SNAPSHOT.jar to /root/.m2/repository/org/apache/maven/maven-core/3.1-SNAPSHOT/maven-core-3.1-SNAPSHOT.jar\n[INFO] Installing /opt/maven/maven-core/pom.xml to /root/.m2/repository/org/apache/maven/maven-core/3.1-SNAPSHOT/maven-core-3.1-SNAPSHOT.pom\n\nif I cd into\n    /root/.m2/repository/org/apache/maven/maven-core\nand do a ls -la\nI see\ndrwxr-xr-x  9 root root 4096 Sep 25 15:31 .\ndrwxr-xr-x 33 root root 4096 Sep 25 15:31 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Sep 25 15:30 2.0\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Sep 25 15:30 2.0.1\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Sep 25 15:30 2.0.6\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Sep 25 15:30 2.0.9\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Sep 25 15:31 2.2.1\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Sep 25 15:30 3.0\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Sep 25 15:31 3.1-SNAPSHOT\n\nThe last entry seems really suspicious.

If you meant what you said, the problem is mvn install which doesn't install mvn. Man pages say maven has no \"install\" switch. It should have printed a \"how's that?\" error. Bad maven.\nThe canonical build-from-source routine goes like this, from the appropriate directory:\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nMake install (d'oh!). Note the sudo, meaning, root privileges for you from now on, I'm sure you know.\nI've never built maven myself, but after that last step I should expect to find the new program somewhere in /usr/local. /usr/local/share, in this case? With any luck, just mvn from the command line should find the new one after installing, and that's what you want of course. If not, you'll have to adjust your $PATH environment variable, and perhaps your library search configuration, but let's hope that's unnecessary.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu on new HDD, replacing it with old HDD running Windows My question is related to: Direct install of Ubuntu into new HDD\nI have a Laptop with Windows 8. I would like to replace the HDD with a new one and install Ubuntu on it. My question is if I late replace the Ubuntu-HDD with the Windows-HDD will Windows 8 run without Problems?\nWill intalling Ubuntu change BIOS or something on the pc that can cause any Problems when I insert the old HDD with Windows?\nThanks \n\nA: The answer to the question ultimately depends on how you configure Ubuntu to run. Lots of people will tell you to run your (I assume) factory Windows 8 machine in non-EFI mode to do the installation. However, in my experience, EFI installation of Ubuntu is fairly painless granted you understand a little bit about how it works.\nSince factory Windows 8 machines use an EFI \"BIOS\", the Windows 8 that is installed can only run in EFI mode, not legacy BIOS mode.\nIf you plan to install Ubuntu in non-EFI mode, you will have to re-enable EFI mode in order to get Windows to boot again.\nIf you plan to install Ubuntu in EFI mode, then no changes will be necessary and a disk swap shouldn't cause any special problems.\n", "Q: How do I fix a mount that is now failing One of my drives that used to mount, no longer mounts and if possible, I would like to get my data from the drive as that is where my java projects and other things are.\nMy current /etc/fstab looks like: \n# /etc/fstab: static file system information.\n#\n# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a\n# device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices\n# that works even if disks are added and removed.

Now the grub bootloader menu comes up asking me which to boot. I changed boot option's from legacy to UEFI. Now In both the booting System, Ubuntu says that boot/efi is not ready, press S to continue.How to fix this error? Also How Installing lubuntu get's me to the login screen again?\nEdit: I also found that when I try to boot in EFI mood, It tells start pxe over IPv4 Now, When I enter to the boot menu I see at #1 Ubunt(hard drive not present) that is bios is not detecting My OS. So the problem here is, Ubuntu isn't been able to boot itself.That's why installing lubuntu I was able to boot. Now what should I do to fix this error?\n\nA: You've probably got filesystem damage on your EFI System Partition (ESP), which is mounted at /boot/efi in Ubuntu. This type of damage is often caused by the Windows Fast Startup feature, which can do serious damage to filesystems on a dual-boot configuration. It's imperative that you disable this feature when dual-booting with Windows. See this page for instructions on disabling this feature.\nAfter you disable Fast Startup, you may also need to repair filesystem damage on the ESP. You can do this in Linux with the dosfsck command, as in sudo dosfsck /dev/sda1; however, you'll need to know what partition to pass as an argument, as that varies from one computer to another. Type sudo parted /dev/sda print to see your partition table. The ESP can be identified as a FAT partition with its \"boot flag\" set. Alternatively, you can use CHKDSK or its GUI equivalent in Windows, but I'm less sure of the exact procedure there, so I can't provide details. In a worst-case scenario, you might need to copy all the files off of the ESP, create a fresh FAT32 filesystem on it, and copy all the files back. If you do this, you'll probably have to adjust your /etc/fstab file in Linux to get the partition to mount correctly, since its serial number (\"UUID,\" although it's not technically a UUID) will probably have changed.\n\nA: The problem is the BIOS. You will need to enter your bios. Disable UFEI boot and enable legacy support. In other words you need to disable secure boot.

I have downloaded an iso file of said product and installed wine1.4-i386 using the apt-get command on the terminal.\nThe question is I don't know the steps how to install it. I can't get much tutorials on Internet how MSOffice2013 can be installed on Ubuntu.\nIf any versions of wine isn't an option, what other options can be used to run Microsoft Office 2013?\n\nA: You can also try:\n\n\n*\n\n*WinConn. This is a remote app manager that uses FreeRDP, a free implementation of the RDP protocol. It allows you to run office 2013 in a virtual machine(Make sure you use Windows 7 Ultimate edition!), but it looks like you're just running a local application in a seperate window.\n\n*Office 2010 with PlayOnLinux. This is software based on Wine.\n\n*Office 365 in your browser.\n\n*Skydrive in your browser. You can then create a Word document/PowerPoint presentation/Excel document/OneNote note free of charge. Keep in mind though you just got a limited set of features(It's actually a stripped down version of a paid Office 365 account)\n\n*Google docs\n\n*Kingsoft office for linux. Although it's still in alpha stage, Kingsoft office for Windows has build up a reputation for being a worthy alternative to Microsoft Office.\n\n\nA: I suggest you use AbiWord instead.  It's compatible with DocX and you has a number of advantages over word (no, I'm not joking, really)... there's a good reason why it's referred to affectionately as \"the underappreciated word processor\" by some.\nAs for the rest of Office, I suggest you do one of four things:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you must have Office 2013, it doesn't current work w/ Wine... so use VMWare, etc. ADVANTAGES: the\nsoftware you want! DISADVANTAGES: in separate\nenvironment)\n\n*Install Office 2010 instead on Wine. IMPORTANT!! (I don't recall seeing anyone else put this... ONLY the 32-bit version works.  The 64-bit won't install (just like 2013).\nADVANTAGES: faster access, probably more responsive, easier\nfile access! DISADVANTAGES: you may miss some of 2013's\nfeatures if you're a power user or find it less visually appealing,\ndepending on your preferences.)\n\n*Get an Office 365\nsubscription.  Test if it the desktop versions will install in Wine (and add your results here, please).\nEven if they won't you can still use the in-browser version when\nyour internet connected (which I assume is most of the time)\nADVANTAGES: fast, your data auto-saves and is accessible\nanywhere from the cloud in-browser! DISADVANTAGES: major step\ndown in functionalility.)\n\n*Switch to an open source or\nthird party alternative, e.g. Libre Office (widely distributed w/\nLinux) or Google Docs (in the cloud) ADVANTAGES: Probably free!\nInherent advantages if you pick a cloud app.  Personal satisfaction\nif you support open source! DISADVANTAGES: Probably lacks\ncompatibility w/ at least some Office features.  \nHope that helps!\nP.S. I'm not sure why some downvoted you -- this seems a valid question.  True, you might not have provided all the possible info (e.g. why you're not considering Office 2010 or an alternative like Libre Office), but you asked a relatively clear question, which is perfectly reasonable from a beginner-to-mid-range user.  Let's be respectful... I digress.\n\nA: According to Wine HQ, Microsoft Office 2013, can't be installed.  \nI you would suggest that you look at Libreoffice, or if insist on MS office, you can try Office 365.\n\nA: Codeweavers Crossover 16.0 now has support for Office 2013 (3/5 star rating of this post). You have to use the iso installer, not the online downloader.\nYou can check it out here: https://www.codeweavers.com/compatibility/crossover/microsoft-office-2013\n\nA: PlayOnLinux beta installer script supports Office 2013. It uses Wine 1.8-staging.

What i want to do is when i click the close button on the terminal interface, the terminal should not close. It should remain open. How can i do this.

I would like a brief explanation of the following command line:\ngrep -i 'abc' content 2>/dev/null \n\n\nA: The > operator redirects the output usually to a file but it can be to a device.  You can also use >> to append.\nIf you don't specify a number then the standard output stream is assumed, but you can also redirect errors:\n> file redirects stdout to file\n1> file redirects stdout to file\n2> file redirects stderr to file\n&> file redirects stdout and stderr to file\n> file 2>&1 redirects stdout and stderr to file\n/dev/null is the null device it takes any input you want and throws it away. It can be used to suppress any output.\nNote that > file 2>&1 is an older syntax which still works, &> file is neater, but would not have worked on older systems.\n\nA: First we need to talk about > operator. It redirect the output of left of symbol to right of symbol. \nSo it must thought as : \n\nsource_command > target_file\n\nOther things that we must know \n0 means stdin \n1 means stdout(useful output)\n2 means stderr(error message output)\n\nAs default, it works as command 1 > target_file \nAs to /dev/null --> it is a special file that discards channel output redirect to it.\nSo in your question it means \n\nRun the command and do not show me the error messages, discard them. \n\n\nA: In short, it redirects stderr (fd 2) to the black hole (discards the output of the command).\nSome commonly used pattern for redirection:\ncommand > /dev/null 2>&1 &\n\nRun command in the background, discard stdout and stderr\ncommand >> /path/to/log 2>&1 &\n\nRun command, append stdout and stderr to a log file.\nIn Bash 4+, a shorter (but less readable) form is functional\ncommand &>> /path/to/log\n\n\nA: /dev/null is treated as black hole in Linux/Unix, so you can put anything into this but you will not be able to get it back from /dev/null.\nFurther, 2> means that you are redirecting (i.e. >) the stderr (i.e. 2) into the black hole (i.e. /dev/null)\nYour command is:\ngrep -i 'abc' content 2>/dev/null \n\nDon't try to end with another forward slash like this - 2>/dev/null/ (it's not a directory).\n\nA: grep -i 'abc' content will generate output which is displayed on your console, including any errors.\nSpecifying 2>/dev/null will filter out the errors so that they will not be output to your console.\nIn more detail:\n2 represents the error descriptor, which is where errors are written to. By default they are printed out on the console.\n\\> redirects output to the specified place, in this case /dev/null\n/dev/null is the standard Linux device where you send output that you want ignored.\n", "Q: I can't open links neither in Okular, MuPDF nor xpdf Is it a bug in viewers or a property that if I click a link in a pdf, nothing happens in Okular and MuPDF outputs \"Couldn't get a file descriptor referring to the console\"? xPDF outputs\nWarning: Cannot convert string \"-*-helvetica-medium-r-normal--12-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1\" to type FontStruct\nWarning: Cannot convert string \"-*-courier-medium-r-normal--12-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1\" to type FontStruct\nWarning: Cannot convert string \"-*-times-bold-i-normal--20-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1\" to type FontStruct\nWarning: Cannot convert string \"-*-times-medium-r-normal--16-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1\" to type FontStruct\nSyntax Error: Couldn't create a font for 'RXAUES+CMR10'\nSyntax Error: Couldn't create a font for 'EJASTL+CMR7'\nSegmentation fault (core dumped)\n\nI thought that they will open the WWW-browser.

From what I can tell after extracting the game, it is stand-alone and doesn't require installation on the computer you want to play it on (I want to play it off my flash drive at university). However, as I don't have root access on the computers at university, I can't use chmod +x ninja-bin to allow executing the main ninja-bin.sh file as a program instead of opening it in gedit. Also, when I try executing it via the terminal using ./ninja-bin I get bash: ./ninja-bin: Permission denied. Is there any workaround for this for which I don't need root access? Or should I just not try to play games on a computer which I don't have root for?\nThanks\n\nA: If you are not a member of sudo group and if your access to chmod command was blocked, then there is nothing that you can do. Due to these reasons Linux like systems are known for their security.\nOr, maybe you can do something: convince the admin (root) to change the permissions for that file :).\n\nA: Yes, run it with sudo:   \nsudo ./ninja-bin\n\nI suppose the elevated rights are required during install procedure.\n", "Q: Does juju helps to build own private cloud? Will juju help me to create my own cloud for my organization, we want to create private cloud for my organisation if it helps what are the guidelines that we need to got through?\n\nA: Yes, that is one of the things that Juju (and MAAS) can help you do. If you have your own servers and wish to turn those in to a private cloud you can do one of two things at the moment with Juju.\nYou can just install MAAS on those servers. MAAS, Metal as a Service, is a Canonical tool to allow you to treat \"metal\" (bare servers, or VMs) as a Cloud. After you've done so, you have a \"cloud\". While it's not a traditional cloud you can use Juju to drive your servers.\nIf you're looking for a more traditional \"private cloud\", you can use your MAAS+Juju setup to deploy OpenStack. OpenStack is available as Juju charms. So once you've setup MAAS and Juju you can use Juju to deploy all the OpenStack charms. Once deployed you've now got MAAS, using Juju you've deployed another cloud on top of that (OpenStack). At this point you can walk away and use OpenStack as a cloud or configure Juju to now use that new OpenStack service to deploy other Juju charms.\n", "Q: pendrive shown correctly in gparted but not in df -h my pendrive (cruzer/sandisk 4GB) is recognized correctly by gparted but it is not listed in df -h.

To identify if your machine is\nbooting installer UEFI mode you will see\nREF: UEFI Community Ubuntu Documentation Section 2.4\nIf your machine is CSM capable (which is a full UEFI implementation\nwith an emulated BIOS layer) after selecting any option from grub list\nsystem will hang at a black screen. The picture above actually only\nconfirms DVD/USB booted using UEFI and there will be some means in\nfirmware settings to ensure drives are booted in order to make UEFI\ninstaller run - the solution to which may possibly be as simple as\nensuring SATA set to AHCI - check your vendors manual to check this.\nAlso check UEFI Community Documentation Section 2.3 for more details.\nWhat you need to check is first disable SECURE BOOT in firmware\nsettings. If that does not get Ubuntu installer running - Try\ndisabling anything mentioning UEFI in firmware settings. Or If you can\nnot find UEFI settings then enable CSM - this will disable the UEFI\nbooting of installer and then allow a legacy/bios install of Ubuntu.\nInstalling grub-efi afterwards will allow UEFI to be re-enabled. Again\nrefer to UEFI Community Ubuntu Documentation this time at Section 4\nSome machines use a full BIOS with an emulated UEFI layer which may\nthrow errors as described ie \"you need to load the kernel first\" and\n\"can not read file/cd0\" Not all of these machines implement Secure\nBoot. Simply selecting UEFI in BIOS settings will configure UEFI mode\non hard drives. The information above may still be relative to your\nmachine though regarding this. There is no solution for these errors\nand the workaround is to disable UEFI to enable Ubuntu installer to\nrun in legacy mode. After which boot-repair can be used to install\ngrub-efi which then allows/needs UEFI switched back on before Ubuntu\nwill boot using UEFI.

I would like to know the correct way to set up a software RAID array on an existing server. I have two brand new 3TB disks to use for the array.\nSpecifically, I want to set up a 3TB RAID 1 array, formatted to ext4, not using LVM. But a more general answer might help others with instructions from start to finish.\nI have tried a number of guides:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to implement RAID 1? - only covers part of the process\n\n*Setup of two additional SSD drives in RAID 1 - ends up with an array of 2TB rather than 3TB\n\n*Add two new HDD in Raid 1 - only uses 1TB drives\n\n\nI also found these resources:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://richard.blog.kraya.co.uk/tag/mdadm/ - for CentOS and does not cover updating mdadm.conf and other steps\n\n*http://www.technotes.se/?p=1732 - comprehensive but complicated and not specifically written for Ubuntu\n\n\nThe initial partitioning of the drives appears to be key; the last link above mentions this in detail, but the previous link seems to achieve the same result and is simpler.\n\nA: This answer assumes that you are creating a new RAID 1 array using two identical new drives. The file system will be ext4 on a single partition taking up the whole drive, not using LVM.\nFirstly, identify the device names for your new hard drives by running sudo fdisk -l. In my case, the new drives were /dev/sdc and /dev/sdd.\nThen create the partition on each drive. The partition table needs to be GPT to allow more than 2TB to be used, so you cannot use fdisk.\n\n\n*\n\n*Run parted /dev/sdc.\n\n*At the (parted) prompt, create the partition table by typing mklabel gpt.\n\n*Check the free space on the drive by typing print free. In my case, this shows 3001GB.\n\n*Create the partition by typing mkpart primary 1M 3001GB. This starts the partition a 1M offset giving a 4096 byte alignment. This may or may not be necessary, but won't hurt if its not.\n\n*Check your partition is set up by typing p. Then type q to quit.\nRepeat steps 1 to 5 for /dev/sdd.\nNow create the array using the mdadm command:\nsudo mdadm --verbose --create /dev/md0 --level=raid1 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sd[cd]1\n\nCreate the file system:\nsudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/md0\n\nFinally, mount your array somewhere and add it to /etc/fstab if you want it to be mounted permanently. I did this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a location to mount the array at by running sudo mkdir /mnt/md0.\n\n*Edit /etc/fstab and add the following line:\n/dev/md0 /mnt/md0 auto defaults 0 0\n\n\n*Mount by running sudo mount /mnt/md0.\nNow you can start using your array. Bear in mind, however, that before it is fully operation it will need to complete its initial sync. You can track its progress by running sudo mdadm --detail /dev/md0.\n", "Q: What's the point of adding extra GB of drive space to the Ubuntu partition beyond what the OS needs? I'm installing alongside windows.  My HD has ~1 TB of space.  I'm assuming when installing, if I ask the installer to partition 400 GB of space for Ubuntu, this would leave ~600 GB of space for Windows.\nBut how is this 400 GB used?  Will it be used for me to save any random files I end up saving? (e.g. music, photos, apps, etc.?)\nOr will it be used for some weird tech reason that I, as a casual user, am not aware of or concerned with?\n\nA: \nBut how is this 400 GB used? \n\nThat is up to you.\nTheoretically you could create a 250 Gb swap file and reserve 10 Gb for the OS files and 140 for /home/. Not that I would advice it but it is possible. \nFor the basic system (ie. Ubuntu itself with kernel etc etc) 10 Gb is more than enough (ie create a 10Gb partition and call it / during installation).. Your personal documents can be stored on a separate partition on those 400 Gb (ie create a 380Gb partition and call it /home during installation). The remainder can be used for swap.\n\nA: In the default configuration that partition will contain the OS and your home directory including all your personal data, documents and media (if you decide to save them there).\nMore experienced users often have a separate partition for their home directory, which can be much larger than the one for the root directory.\n", "Q: Deleted files accidentally from encrypted home folder and now stuck in login loop I have Ubuntu installed on my laptop with the home folder encrypted.\nYesterday while trying to remove duplicate files in my music, photos and documents, I used fdupes on my entire home folder.\nI've deleted a lot of small files around the home that probably had the same size, so they were indicated as duplicated files.\nJust after doing it I realised I'd probably messed up something, but the system continued working.\nThis morning when I've tried to log in as my user, after entering the password and pressing enter it just flashed dark and returned to the login screen.\nIs there a way to repair the system? \nI know that there is a way to try to recuperate the files in my home from a live usb, but after that I would have to reinstall the system and reconfigure everything. If possible I would like to repair the system rather than do that.\nA good thing is that I have a backup around two month old done with dejadup from which I could probably copy the small file that is missing and is making impossible to log in.\n\nA: Yes, it is possible in recovery mode or with a LiveCD, if you didn't delete the key file (and remember your pass phrase).\nFrom your description I suspect you use ecryptfs to encrypt your home directory. Ubuntu Community has an extensive help page about it. Section 7 is likely going to be of high interest to you.\n", "Q: Creating the two column design of a scientific paper I want to create a document similar to the format of the following paper:\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/84207818/Neural-network-based-PHY-layer-key-exchange-for-wireless-communications.pdf\nThe above format is the design of a scientific paper, thus are there any guides or ways to create a document with a similar design? In TeX, libreoffice or anything?\n\nA: If you decide to go with LaTeX, you can get pre-made templates for conference proceedings and IEEE transactions (journals) from the IEEE website. They also have Microsoft Word 2003 'templates' there (really just doc files) which should work to some extent in LibreOffice, at least to provide a basic format you can start with.\nEveryone will have their own favorite TeX/LaTeX environment - personally I'm using TeXmaker at the moment (which you can find in the repository). To use the IEEE templates you will probably also need to install the texlive-fonts-recommended package.\n\nA: Yes, it's possible in LibreOffice Writer by using sections (Insert -> Section).\n", "Q: Persistant drive viewable files I created a persistant drive of 500mb on my 4 gig usb drive using netbootin and a linux image.

Where can I save them so I have at next re-boot or if I use a different computer.\nThank you.\n\nA: They will reappear wherever you saved them upon reboot.\nThe persistent drive feature saves any changes to the file system and lays them on top of the read-only file system of the LiveCD.\nEdit: Be aware, that you can't easily open your added or altered files from another system. You would first have to save them on a regular disk or USB drive. The one you're already booting Ubuntu from will do, if it has enough space.\nDisclaimer: I should say, I never tried this myself, just read the docs.\n", "Q: Help, linux beginner! How do I put ubuntu on usb and boot/install on a PC with blank harddrive? I wonder if someone can help me? I am fairly new to trying to actually understand and use computers myself rather than just buying whatever Windows/Mac wants me to! You will get a giggle from my flawed attempts anyway :-)\nI would like to start using Ubuntu on my PC, just got a new harddrive and did have a borrowed windows 7 disk as was planning to temporarily install it so i could get ubuntu. However I didn't have high enough spec hardware for win 7 (I think it is due to only 1gb ram, i do have 64 bit technology and a 1tb harddrive). I am quite happy to install 32 bit ubuntu and hear it is easier the use than 64 anyway.\nSo I have one other rubbish mini laptop (windows xp) which i am trying to use to get ubuntu onto a usb (laptop has no cd drive) so i can install it on the pc. First tried just downloading ubuntu 13.04 desktop onto a usb and trying to boot the pc from it which gave the message 'no operating system'. Then I tried this to create a bootable usb which sounded promising: http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/ . However then it starting asking for my saucy desktop iso in order to install it onto the usb stick, can't really manage to find out what a saucy desktopp iso is, maybe a mirror image of an operating system, no idea why i would need that.\nSo in short, I'm lost. All I can think of is getting windows xp somewhere so i can get my pc to work and install ubuntu from the internet on that, or going to a friends house in the hope that creating a bootable cd is easier than creating a usb.\nSorry for my general ineptness and hope someone can help!\n\nA: If you downloaded the correct file for installing Ubuntu, then the .iso is the same as the file itself that you downloaded, and you didn't need to extract anything from the archive. In order to make an Ubuntu bootable live USB you need to use the .iso file itself instead of a file or files from the contents of the archive that you extracted.\n\nThe instructions for preparing an Ubuntu live USB on Windows are found at the official Ubuntu How to create a bootable USB stick... webpage (see the step-by-step instructions below).\n\n*\n\n*Open Rufus and select your USB stick in the Device dropdown menu.\n\n\n\n*Click the CD-ROM icon next to the FreeDOS dropdown menu, then find your downloaded Ubuntu ISO and click Open and then Start.\n\n\n\n*Click Yes when it asks to download Syslinux software.\n\n\n\n*Click OK to write in ISO Image mode.\n\n\n\n*Confirm that your USB stick is selected and then click OK to continue. It is very important to verify that the device that you are installing the Ubuntu live USB to is indeed your flash drive, so that you don't overwrite any of your system or personal files which may make your operating system unbootable.\n\n\n\n*When it is finished, just restart your computer and start using Ubuntu, or you can install Ubuntu.\n\nIn order to enable your computer to boot from the USB flash drive, you must enter your BIOS setup utility by pressing one of these keys: Delete, F2 or F10 as soon as the motherboard splash screen appears when the computer is booting. In the BIOS menu, you need to change the boot order so that the USB flash drive, which is usually called USB-HDD in newer computers, is the first entry in the boot sequence, and then save your new settings and exit the setup utility.\n\nA: I see you already found the relevant guide. Unfortunately it doesn't mention, that you still need to download an image file with Ubuntu. Choose wichever you like, though I recommend v13.04 (64 bit) for a recent system.\nSelect that image file as described in step 2 of the guide.\n\nA: Step 1: Download the Ubuntu CD image file (a .ISO file) from the official Ubuntu Download site. I strongly recommend to use the 12.04 LTS version, it's by far more stable. Since you only have 1 GB RAM, you might want the 32bit version (see the relevant question).\nStep 2: Run the pendrivelinux USB creator and select the Ubuntu version you downloaded (if you followed my advice it's Ubuntu 12.04 Desktop) from the drop down menu. Then click the browse button and select the file downloaded in step 1. Then select your USB drive in the dropdown menu und click create. Screenshots can be found on the official guide.\nStep 3: Reboot from the USB drive.\n\nA: To search, open filemanager, go to your pen drive, press \"ctrl+f\" and type \".iso\". If you still can't find the file by this way then I think you have erased the USB drive.\n", "Q: Can't set my background This is mystifying me.

Something along the lines of the following untested shell script:\ncp -R {/usr,~/.local}/share/applications\nfind ~/.local/share/applications -name \\*.desktop -exec sed -i -e '/^NoDisplay=/d;/^\\[Desktop Entry\\]$/a NoDisplay=true' \\{\\} +\n\nThen delete the starters of allowed applications in ~/.local/share/applications. You can do a similar things for MIME types that you don't want them to open (with some applications).\n\n*Write some apparmor rules that forbid user \"parents\" to execute anything except allowed applications. This is potentially difficult, because many applications rely on external programs and shell scripts, and some have their real binary executables somewhere in /usr/lib. It may work for a very limited set of applications though.\nA sensible set of programs to allow would be stuff from the packages \"coreutils\", \"bash\", \"python\", \"perl\", and any dependencies of allowed applications.\nI would also do disable the application starters as explained above as to not have a bunch of dysfunctional starters in the dash, dock, application menu, or wherever.\n", "Q: Script to Update Host File I have the following command that correctly creates the /etc/hosts file that I want to build.

The error message reads:\nmkdosfs: Device partition expected, not making filesystem on entire device '/dev/sda16' (use -l to override)\n\nI can see sda16 is present in /dev. (ls -l sda* (selected output displayed))\nbrw-rw---- 1 root disk   8, 15 Sep 26 15:05 sda15\nbrw-rw---- 1 root disk 259,  0 Sep 26 15:05 sda16\nbrw-rw---- 1 root disk   8,  2 Sep 26 15:05 sda2\n\nThe strange difference is that all partitions are an 8, except sda16 which is marked 259.\nI assume this is an artificial limit set somewhere by Ubuntu, as GPT can have some 128 partitions according to wikipedia.\nThanks.\nUpdate:\nAfter the first answer I tried to add more partitions after the sda16 and that worked without issues. Then I also noticed that sda and sda16 both have 0 (zero) as the second number. Could that be the reason it thinks it is overwriting a partition table as suggested by David Foerster.\nbrw-rw---- 1 root disk   8,  0 Sep 26 16:32 sda\nbrw-rw---- 1 root disk   8,  1 Sep 26 16:32 sda1\nbrw-rw---- 1 root disk   8, 10 Sep 26 16:32 sda10\nbrw-rw---- 1 root disk   8, 11 Sep 26 16:32 sda11\nbrw-rw---- 1 root disk   8, 12 Sep 26 16:32 sda12\nbrw-rw---- 1 root disk   8, 13 Sep 26 16:32 sda13\nbrw-rw---- 1 root disk   8, 14 Sep 26 15:05 sda14\nbrw-rw---- 1 root disk   8, 15 Sep 26 16:32 sda15\nbrw-rw---- 1 root disk 259,  0 Sep 26 16:32 sda16\nbrw-rw---- 1 root disk 259,  1 Sep 26 16:32 sda17\nbrw-rw---- 1 root disk 259,  2 Sep 26 16:32 sda18\nbrw-rw---- 1 root disk   8,  2 Sep 26 15:05 sda2\n\nCannot answer question, but this is what I found out:\nIn fact there is only a problem with sda16. Higher numbers can be created and formatted in Ubuntu 12.04 Gparted without issue.\nThis issue occurs by design. \nFirst the meaning of the numbers in the ls -l output: they are a major, minor device number pair. So 8, 10 refers to sda10 here. The usage of these numbers is specified centrally at kernel.org in a devices text. \nPut simply: The major number specifies the type of device and the minor number is the \"id\". Major number 3 is for IDE devices, 8 is for SCSI devices. For HDD devices: the Minor number 0 stands for the complete HDD and the following numbers are the individual partitions.\nAdd to this that SCSI HDDs are supposed to have a maximum of 15 partitions according to the devices text. And I guess with a possibility to extend to major number 259 in case it exceeds 15. As you can see the number combination for sda16 is 259,0. This combination identifies a whole HDD according to the devices text. And that is why it throws the partition table error.\nI believe that to be on the safe side I should not use number combinations that for HDD devices end in 0(zero). As other software probably uses the same specification it could have consequences later as well.\nI believe that leaves for one GPT layout HDD a maximum of 2 x 15 partitions.\n\nA: As the author of the question noted, disks and the 16th partition of a disk have the minor device number 0 (source). Contrary to what we know, mkdosfs seems to think, all devices with minor number 0 are disks.\nI conclude, that it is generally safe to override that safety measure with -l and format the 16th partition, though other tools may complain as well.\n", "Q: How to get translations on Launchpad for a custom program I wrote a program and uploaded it to a ppa.

However I only read about mo,poand such on Launchpad to translate something.\nHow can I get my *.ts-files on Launchpad so that people can translate them easily? \nOr am I on the wrong way?\nMy python program is loading the *.qm files with this code:\nlocale = QLocale()\nLOCALNAME = str(locale.system().name())\nlang=str.split(LOCALNAME,\"_\")[0] \ntranslator= QtCore.QTranslator()\ntranslator.load(getParentDir()+\"/Translate/main_%s\"%lang)\nself.app.installTranslator(translator)\n\nI don't know if it can handle different files than *.qm.\n\nA: You can use Launchpad to help translate free software, both directly with upstream projects, (such as Limewire), and also as packages in distributions such as Ubuntu.\nWhen you're deciding what to translate, think about the following:\nCan you work on the upstream project, rather than the distribution package?\nDo you know and understand the software well enough to know the context of the strings you need to translate?\nAre you familiar with the translation standards you'll need to stick to?\nTo learn about the processes and standards that a project applies to its translations, you should get in touch with the translation team that manages its localization into your language. Most projects work with a translation group - an umbrella organization of many teams - who look after translation quality control. Each translation group assigns teams to look after particular languages.\nReference site \nhttps://help.launchpad.net/Translations/StartingToTranslate\n\nA: Rosseta, the launchpad translation service don't work with Qt files, it is a known bug.\nYou can use ts2po to convert from .ts to .po files and backwards, but it doesn't support all the new ts features.\nQt 4.5 comes with a tool, lconvert, that should be able to convert ts files to po and back, but documentation is lacking.\n", "Q: How to use grep to search for a file anywhere I'm finding that a script is getting started twice, so I want to search for the script name in any file anywhere, to see where its getting called.\nSo I did this...\ncd /\nsudo grep -r autostart *\n\nBut that gives me the error..\nboot/System.map-3.5.0-23-generic:c1490f90 t autostart_arrays\ngrep: dev/vsock: Invalid argument\n\n\nA: This is not an error. Grep just reported its failure to search through a special file (probably a socket), and was already working on the next. If you don't want to see grep's error messages, you can send them to the bitbucket:\nfgrep -r autostart * 2> /dev/null\n\nNote that fgrep will likely be much faster in your case because you are searching for a string, not for a regular expression.\nContrary to what you it looked like, grep hadn't crashed. Technically, it wasn't hung either. Maybe it was searching /dev/random for the string. Eventually it would find  it there, though this might take an astronomical amount of time. Sadly, soon after grep would have found the string in /dev/random, it would encounter /dev/zero where it would certainly spend an infinity of time looking for the string. Logically therefore, your command was guaranteed to not terminate.\nIf you wish to prevent fgrep from searching special files, combine it with find:\nfind / -type f -exec fgrep -l autostart {} \\;\n\nAnd since you're looking for a script, skipping all all non-executables on the file system will save a lot of time:\nfind / -type f -executable -exec fgrep -l autostart {} \\;\n\nIn fact, I would focus my search first on the usual suspects:\nfind {,/usr}/{,s}bin /etc -type f -executable -exec fgrep -l autostart {} \\;\n\nParticularly so if you have some remote file systems mounted, which grep would dutifully search as well.\n", "Q: How to install this file with Python?

I have a Gateway laptop running Windows 8.  I tried to install Ubuntu 13.04 side-by-side with Windows, and I can not seem to boot into Ubuntu (or see GRUB at all), no matter what I do.\nFirst I went into Windows Disc Management, and shrunk my Hard Drive (C:) by 120GB. \nI downloaded the 64bit Ubuntu 13.04 ISO and used a Disc Image creator to burn the ISO to a disc creating an Ubuntu LiveCD.  I then disabled FastBoot in Windows 8 through the Power Options in Control Panel (basically disables Hibernation, and doesn't save a Windows state to the HardDrive for faster bootup) and booted to the UEFI settings.  I disabled Secure Boot inside of the UEFI firmware settings and changed boot priority to boot off of the DVD drive first, and inserted the disc, and booted into the LiveCD. I selected Install Ubuntu and continued to the installation.  When the installation started up, Ubuntu did not find/recognize my Windows 8 installation.  I selected Something Else from the menu and created two partitions on the Free Space portion of my HDD.  I used 115GB as Primary, ext4 journaling file system, mount point set to root.  I then created a 5GB swap partition (also set to primary I believe).  The installation finished without a hitch.\nSince finishing the install, I am unable to see GRUB on boot up, and am launched straight to Windows 8.  I tried using EasyBCD to add Ubuntu to the Windows boot menu, which worked in adding Ubuntu, but when I select it, I get a \"Windows is unable to load\" error, and listed NST/NeoGrub.mbr as corrupt or missing.  I have since restored the EasyBCD backup I made before changing anything, and uninstalled EasyBCD altogether.  I then booted into the LiveCD again, this time selecting \"Try Ubuntu Without Installing\" and ran the following commands in terminal: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair followed by sudo apt-get install boot-repair I then ran a command to update Boot Repair (can't remember the exact command, maybe sudo apt-get update boot-repair) and then sudo run boot-repair.\nI ran Boot Repair and the paste from that can be found at: http://paste.ubuntu.com/6156885/\nIt said that my kernel was \"buggy\" and should be backed up and replaced.  I selected no, because I had read a lot about WINDOWS not booting once that is done, and I certainly didn't want to make matters worse than they already were.\nI need to know how to fix my booting issues.  I have a theory that the reason it will not work, is because my computer already had 3 partitions on it when I started (Recovery, C:/, and another Recovery).  Could this cause the boot problems I am describing?  Can I format the partition containing Ubuntu (would this completely uninstall Ubuntu?) and start over after backing up the Recovery partitions and formatting them?  Would it even make a difference?  I am mad, because I love my laptop.  It's fast, its got a beautiful display, and plenty of bells and whistles, but I NEED Ubuntu.  If I didn't RELY on Windows for work software that can't run inside of a VM, I would scrap Windows altogether.  Please help me.\n\nA: If you have Windows 8 on it on UEFI, then you have a GPT Partitioned Disk :)\nThis can have more than 4 primary partitions( infact upto 128 !)\nSo thats not the problem :)\nFrom your pastebin, this is what grub-repair is suggesting\n\nRecommended-Repair\n  This setting will reinstall the grub-efi of sda6, using the following options:        sda2/boot/efi,\n  Additional repair will be performed: unhide-bootmenu-10s   fix-windows-boot backup-and-rename-efi-files\n\nI think its safe to do what grub repair is suggesting.\nBut I would suggest you to have a Windows repair disk, just like you have your Ubuntu instll disk, in case things go wrong :)\nhttp://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/2855-system-repair-disc-create-windows-8-a.html\nEdit-\nFormatting your Ubuntu partition will delete your current Ubuntu installation and you would have to reinstall!\nAlso I would not recommend formatting any other partition, even after backing up, becuase it could lead to unforseen circumstances! and Windows being what it is, you probably wouldnt have a installation disk for it.\nSo do not format/remove any other partition!\n\nA: OK, I FINALLY SOLVED THIS!  YAY!\nOK, so for ANYONE that is having this problem, this is what I did:\nI re-formatted the partitions that I had installed Ubuntu on.  After I was done, I re-created the partitions.  This time I allocated 200GB as free space (for use with Ubuntu).  I then inserted the LiveCD and rebooted my computer.  Once the Ubuntu LiveCD booted, I chose \"Install Ubuntu\".  As usual, Ubuntu failed to recognize my Windows 8 installation.  I chose the bottom option: Something Else.  I then set up 2 partitions.  I made a 2GB swap partition (set up as Logical, beginning of area, set to Swap Area), I then allocated the rest of the free space to the Ubuntu install (Primary, ext4 journalling, beginning of area, Mount point set to root (/)).  I then selected the primary 198GB partition I had allocated, and selected Install.  I installed Ubuntu and then rebooted.  \nLow and behold, it boot directly into Windows 8 (damn you Microsoft!).  I then re-inserted the LiveCD, and rebooted.  Once rebooted, I chose 'Try Ubuntu Without Installing'.  Once Ubuntu launched, I opened up the Terminal.  Once in the Terminal, I entered the following commands:\nsudo apt-add-repository yannubuntu/boot-repair (make sure you connect to the internet first)\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair\nboot-repair\nOnce Boot Repair opens, select Recommended Repair, and let it do it's thing.  You should receive two pop-ups.  The first one will say something about EFI being detected, just hit OK.  Then it will go through some steps, and it will pop up again, saying 'Buggy Kernel detected.' and say something about backing up and replacing the Windows EFI files.  SELECT YES.  It will then re-install and update GRUB.  Once it is done, type this into Terminal: 'sudo reboot'.  Your computer will reboot.\nNow, when GRUB comes up, you will see no option for Windows.  By default you will be launched right back into Ubuntu... Don't fret.. When Ubuntu reboots, re-open the terminal, and run the Boot Repair commands a second time to permanently install it inside of Ubuntu:\nsudo apt-add-repository yannubuntu/boot-repair (make sure you connect to the internet first)\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair\nboot-repair\nNow, when Boot Repair opens, click on Advanced Settings.  Next click on GRUB LOCATION, and you will see \"OS to boot by default\" and it will be set to \"Current OS, Ubuntu 13.04\".  Change that to Windows and hit APPLY.  Now, when the thing pops up about a Buggy Kernel, select NO.  When it completes, type this into the Terminal \"sudo reboot\".  You will be rebooted back into Windows.\nI am not sure if I will have to do this every time I want to get back into Windows, but even if I do, it only takes about a minute to do, so that is fine with me.  Now, if you want to get back into Ubuntu (at least this is how it works on my Laptop) when you are in Windows, REBOOT your computer, and when the OEM splash screen pops up, press whatever button you must press to open the BOOT MENU.  On my computer, it is F12.  You should see three entries: Windows Boot Manager(XXXXX)(XXX will be the name of your hard drive), and two other entries (one may say Ubuntu, one may say Windows, or they may both just be the name of your hard drive, e.g. HITACHI345XX434UI), number 1 is Windows Boot Manager, number 2 is Windows, number 3 is Ubuntu.  Select number 3 to get into Ubuntu, or number 1 or 2 to boot into Windows.\nThis is a pretty round-about method to dual boot, but until I can figure something else out, this is what I have to do for now ;)\nThanks to those who commented, you pointed me in the right direction, and I am writing this reply from Ubuntu 13.04 and loving it ;)\n", "Q: I want to install 12.04 in asus k55vd-sx313r Recently I bought \"asus k55vd-sx313r\".

Now, the ~/.cache folder grew to 1.7 GB (various applications such as Chrome, Spotify etc. filled it up) and now I'm wondering if there's a way to limit the size of this cache?\nI saw some solutions suggesting adding a cronjob to delete old files using some awk trickery, but I don't know how would all these applications handle if random files were just deleted (or is that OK?). Also, this solution doesn't recursively search the folder.\n\nA: If you were going to use any technique off that question, I'd go for the find technique in a cron job and alter it to check the size:\n@daily    find /home/username/.cache/ -atime +7 -size 50M -delete\n\nObviously have a play around with that. You may wish to exclude certain paths from the query as .cache contains a lot of things that can be a real pain in the bum to regenerate (like thumbnails for some media players or photo viewers).\nOf course the other option is shifting everything to tmpfs by adding something like the following to your /etc/fstab:\ntmpfs        /home/username/.cache/    tmpfs   defaults,noatime,mode=1777   0  0\n\nAnd that will store everything in RAM (after a sudo mount -a or a reboot). Obviously this means that as soon as you power off, you've lost everything in there. This is probably only suited to a desktop that rarely gets restarted and that has lots of RAM.\nThe two could be used in combination.\n\nThe other option is to move cache off to slower, cheaper media. If you've space for a big magnetic disk in your computer, that's often a quick and easy way (either with a symlink or a bind-mount) to spread things over multiple disks.\nEither that or move something else that isn't speed dependant (like documents, music, etc) to the slow disk, giving you more room for cache on the SSD.\n", "Q: Installing .sh file - mojo problem So guys, I've done a lot of research on how to install and .sh file, and I tried it all but none of it works.\nHere is what I get after every possible way I've tried to run it:\nUncompressing Mojo Setup..............\nCollecting info for this system...\nOperating system: linux\nCPU Arch: x86_64\ntrying mojosetup in bin/linux/x86_64\n\nPANIC\nInitial setup failed.

(you do not have to register to download just push download)\n\n*Use YUMI to install the Windows setup onto the media.\n\n*Delete all of the folders from the Windows Installation disk.\n\n*Use EasyBCD to install BCD onto the media.\n\n*Configure the Windows Boot manager with EasyBCD. E.G. Add Windows PE to the menu\n\n*Use YUMI to add all of the linux distros and tools you want (it will set YUMI to boot first on the drive)\n\n*You can do all of the custom configurations with the files YUMI created. E.G. Replacing text and a custom logo\n\n*(Optional) In EasyBCD add an option to boot (linux) from the thumbdrive. E.G. Go back to linux menu\n\n*(Optional) Rename the flash drive and add an autorun file for extra customization.\n\n*Remove the flash drive and boot from it (keep it in if you are trying to boot from it on the same computer.\nEnjoy!\n", "Q: How to use minecraft_server.1.6.4.jar on Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS I am not sure whether i should host my Minecraft server with Ubuntu Server OS. All I know is that Ubuntu's OS is faster and the firewall is stronger. I'm a newbie with zero knowledge on Ubuntu and server stuff. Can anyone tell me how to use Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS to create Minecraft Server, or am I simply asking the wrong questions and i should get Ubuntu OS instead??\n\nA: Just run java -jar minecraft_server.1.6.4.jar to run this. If you don't know - use commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*ls for list current catalog\n\n*cd for change directory (.. is change to higher dir)\n\n*sudo gives you temporary root (superuser) priviligies\n\n\nIf this is small server, this is sufficient. But If you want host public server, read tutorials about iptables and safety. Tips:\n\n\n*\n\n*Never run server on root user - make another user with small permissions\n\n*Configure iptables or ufw - it's firewalls; find tutorial and read it - don't just browse, read :)\n\n*Remove unnecessary software like cups, samba etc.\n\n*Read more about security - example disable root login via ssh\nClean? Feel free to ask.\n", "Q: GNOME 3 search bar doesn't work My question is virtually the same as this one, which is left unanswered. By the way I disagree with the close vote as too localized because hey! I'm a future visitor and I found it useful :)\nBut I digress. I run Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, kernel version 3.2.0-53-generic. I got rid of Unity (apart from the login screen) and installed GNOME 3, currently on version 3.4.2.1.\nI also have the Advanced Calculator and Firefox Bookmarks extensions, they are gone too. The Windows and Applications tabs still work, as does the multiple desktops thing.\nPurging and reinstalling gnome-shell did not solve the problem.\nTo clarify: When I say the search box doesn't work, I mean I type something in it and I see no search results.\n\nIn the picture above, Firefox should have appeared, but it didn't. The same is true for the Advanced Calculator and the Firefox Bookmarks plugins which leads me to believe there's something wrong with core Gnome shell, and not the plugins themselves.\nQuestion: Do you know what might be causing this, and, do you have any suggestion on how to fix it? \n\nA: summarising the comments\nA similar issue was reported on the opensuse forums.\nBasically it looks like there is corruption in one of the underlying gnome-shell configuration files to-do with the search mechanism.\nTo confirm this, you should create a new user account.  If the problem is not persistent this means it is user specific.\nTo diagnose which file/files are the cause could take some considerable amount of time.  Probably the easiest and most productive method would be to reset Gnome back to its defaults.\nThis being Ask Ubuntu  - we already have a great answer for this:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I reset GNOME to the defaults?\nLooking for potential reasons - it could be a rogue extension.  You could narrow this down by adding extensions, one-by-one.  After each extension, logout-login and test your search mechanism.  Continue until you find the rogue extension - then file a bug-report up-stream. \n", "Q: Installing Python modules on Ubuntu I have been using Python on Windows for a while, so I'm into a lot of modules, including Pygame and LiveWires, but how do I install them into Ubuntu?\nI have the py file for LiveWires, which has been specially edited (from a book I'm reading). I want to install it, but I'm not sure how to. I also want to install Pygame, but I can't.\n\nA: In Ubuntu, you can list the packages available with the command\napt-cache pkgnames\n\nbut its output is huge, so pipe it to grep and search for what you want, (and then pipe to sort doesn't hurt either).\napt-cache pkgnames | grep py | sort\n\nFrom this, looks like you want the python-pygame package, so install it with:\nsudo apt-get install python-pygame\n\n\nA: Before doing anything I recommend you install virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper. These make it easy to create isolated Python environments for any project you start. This comes in really handy if ever you break anything because it's isolated to one project.\nInstall Python modules inside a virtualenv is as easy as running:\npip install Pygame\n\nfrom a terminal. pip will also keep track of what packages are in each of your environments, making it easy to upgrade or uninstall them when needed. Although I don't work on Windows so can't confirm, I believe this solution is also cross-platform.\n\nA: Do this:\n$ sudo apt-get install python-pygame\n\nIn general, if you want some  on Linux, you search a corresponding package by\n$ apt-cache search <python-module>\n\nand install an appropriate package by apt-get install like above.\n", "Q: Ubuntu-Server basic GUI installation Can anyone offer suggestions on how I can build websites via the commandLine of my Linux VirtualBox and view my websites in browsers based in the Windows area?\nI installed Ubuntu 12.04 Desktop in a VirtualBox on my windows platform. The idea was to use it as my Linux Web development area but it was too slow and sluggish at best.\nSo, I installed Ubuntu-Server 12.04 planning to just interact with the commandline.\nThe problem is because I'm using Linux in a VirtualBox I can't preview my websites in the Windows area.\n---OR---\nDirections on installing a barebones GUI on my ubuntu-server so I can install web browsers to work on my websites?\nThanks in advance for any help.\nCLARIFICATION:\nSorry, if my original question was confusing.\nBasically, my problem is I need a way to apply code changes to website files via my Ubuntu-Server VirtualBox and view the effects in a browser either within the VirtualBox or outside of it i:e in Windows.\n\nA: I don't know If I understand - you want host sites on ubuntu-server @ Virtualbox, but want to see it at host system (Windows)?\nIf yes - in your virtual machine settings (you must power off machine - not suspend - to change this), in network config, set Bridged or try another options - I'm tried this a year ago and I don't remember. But If you make correct settings, you're able to see webpage hosted in guest (Ubuntu Server) in host (Windows). \nThis is very dependend of configuration and, for example:  \n\n\n*\n\n*your network gate is router with DHCP\n\n*all machines connect to internet by router and got IP from DHCP\n\n\nSo:\n\n\n*\n\n*in guest virtualbox config: set adapter mode to bridged and select correct interface from host\n\n*in guest OS set same settings as host OS\n\n\nNow, your guest will be available same as real machines - you can access HTTP server in local network (example: 192.168.1.1xx).  \nOther way is internal network, maybe using VBox DHCP server.

It uses a text file for input. The 'path-to-file' in windows looks as follows \nc:user\\documents\\python\\file.txt\n\nHow is the location written for Ubuntu?\n\nA: Rather than hardcoding paths in your Python script we should make use of the path operation from the module os.\nos.path.expanduser(path) expands the path to the user's home directory\nos.path.join(path1,*path2*,...) joins path elements with the appropriate separator\nos.sep gives the OS dependent path separator (/ for Linux/Unix, \\ for Windows)\nos.getcwd() gives the current working directory\nos.path.abspath(path) gives the OS dependent absolute path of a given path\nExample:\n>>>import os\n>>>path = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'documents', 'python', 'file.txt')\n>>>print (path)\n\nResult\n/home/user/documents/python/file.txt ## when on Ubuntu\nC:\\Users\\user\\documents\\python\\file.txt ## when running Windows\n\n\nA: I don't have permission to add comments...so I will just try to answer.\nThe path at UNIX will be like: /home/user/file.txt\nWhen you at any folder and want to get the absolute path of a file, you could use the readlink command:\nreadlink -f file.txt\n\nexample at our server:\n$ readlink -f format.log \n/home/dli/format.log\n\n\nA: File paths are written as-\n/path/to/file\n\nEverything in your home folder is located inside /home/username/\nSo, if you have a file on your desktop, it is located in /home/username/Desktop/\nOther partitions are mounted in /media by default.\nIf you directly want to get the path of a file, you can copy the file, and paste it into your text editor, this should give you the path to your file. Put a \\ before every space in the path to 'escape' the space. e.g. /media/myuseraccount/Desktop/an awesome file would be written as:\n/media/myuseraccount/Desktop/an\\ awesome\\ file\n\nAnother thing to note is that in Linux, your file names are case sensitive, so 'desktop' is not the same as 'Desktop'.\nFinally, a shortcut to your home folder is to type ~\nSo, you can access your desktop by typing:\n~/Desktop\n\nand you can access your home folder by typing:\n~/\n\n", "Q: Setting system wide proxy through bash script (Temporarily) I'm trying to temporarily set the system wide proxy option which is available as GUI in the Network Settings through bash script.

(for instance - Do both notification-daemon & notify-osd exist? etc.)\nAnother crude possibility is to rename the binaries swapping the names of notification-daemon and notify-osd however sometimes there are issues like conflicting dependencies occuring when a binary examines its own name.\nI don't like posting hypothetical solutions but this is something I prefer not to try and since there has been no response perhaps this post will invigorate the audience and instigate better answers.   \nref:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to replace notify-osd with Gnome 3 Indicators?\n\n*Use notify-osd instead notification-daemon in GNOME-Shell\n\n*Clickable Gnome-style notifications in Unity\n\n*How to disable Unity style notification when using Gnome Shell\n\n*Gnome 3 notifications are replaced with notify-osd when the machine goes to sleep\n\n*How to install NotifyOSD-Config?\n\n*\n*\n- \n\n\n*\n*\n- \n\n\n", "Q: CUPS spooling/server I have updated my Ubuntu System 12.04 after fresh installation.

harmful.\nTo continue type in the phrase 'Yes, do as I say!'\n ?] n\n\n\nA: As the author and maintainer of ssh-import-id, I can definitively tell you that this is unrelated to ssh-import-id.  You system has a bunch of packages in an incomplete state.  If you get that cleared first, perhaps using sudo apt-get install -f, you should then be able to install ssh-import-id cleanly and simply.\n\nA: I have got run into the exactly same problem installing openssh-server. sudo apt-get install -f did not help.\nIn the end I have found what is the problem. openssh-server depends on the newer version of openssh-client then I have installed. However, I disabled updates, so it cannot meet the dependency and apt goes crazy.\nThe solution is simple: Go the the repository preferences (software sources) and enable \"Install updates from: Important security updates\".\n", "Q: Switching Juju lxc bridge I've set up Juju running in LXC, and I'm attempting to expose it to the internal network. I'm generally following this question to point lxc to my existing bridge (eth-br0).\nI've edited /etc/default/lxc and /etc/lxc/default.conf as per the post, but when I try to bootstrap I get:\n2013-09-26 19:47:05 INFO juju.provider.local environprovider.go:32 opening environment \"local\"\n2013-09-26 19:47:05 ERROR juju.utils network.go:37 cannot find network interface \"lxcbr0\": net: no such interface\n2013-09-26 19:47:05 ERROR juju.provider.local environprovider.go:48 failure setting config: net: no such interface\n2013-09-26 19:47:05 ERROR juju supercommand.go:282 command failed: net: no such interface\nerror: net: no such interface\n\nObviously something is still trying to point to lxcbr0 rather than the existing bridge. If I just want to expose a lxc juju to the network, is this the best way to do it and how should I configure it properly.\nI can attach my ifconfig if necessary.\n\nA: You are right something is trying to point lxcbr0.\nUse lxcbr0 in these files \n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/default/lxc\n\n*/etc/lxc/default.conf\n\n*/etc/network/interfaces\n\n\nI tried br0 it give me the same error. After changing existing bridge to lxcbr0 that I worked fine.\n\nA: The latest version of juju includes an option in the environments yaml for specifying the network bridge:\n# network-bridge holds the name of the LXC network bridge to use.\n# Override if the default LXC network bridge is different.\n#\n#\nnetwork-bridge: br0\n\nHope this helps?\n\nA: See which interface do you have by: \n\nifconfig\n\nmy result is like this:\nlo        Link encap:Local Loopback  \n      inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0\n      inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host\n      UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:16436  Metric:1\n      RX packets:12 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n      TX packets:12 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n      collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 \n      RX bytes:600 (600.0 B)  TX bytes:600 (600.0 B)\n\nvenet0    Link encap:UNSPEC  HWaddr 00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00  \n      inet addr:127.0.0.2  P-t-P:127.0.0.2  Bcast:0.0.0.0  Mask:255.255.255.255\n      UP BROADCAST POINTOPOINT RUNNING NOARP  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n      RX packets:7239 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n      TX packets:8727 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n      collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 \n      RX bytes:931464 (931.4 KB)  TX bytes:1701016 (1.7 MB)\n\nvenet0:0  Link encap:UNSPEC  HWaddr 00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00  \n      inet addr:198.46.159.94  P-t-P:198.46.159.94  Bcast:198.46.159.94  Mask:255.255.255.255\n      UP BROADCAST POINTOPOINT RUNNING NOARP  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n\nSo my network interface is venet0.

Your zone file shows that your DNS resolves all names in the example.com.ar domain to private IP addresses. No public computer can reach those, as the 192.168/16 network is not routeable across the internet.\nYour DNS records should resolve to either of the two gateway public IP addresses. Then, the gateways should NAT the traffic to the internal machines.\nTip: Unless you do it for fun and learning - which are perfectly legitimate reasons - there is no need at all to run your own DNS servers.\n", "Q: Create bootable USB drive on Mac for Windows I need to create a bootable USB drive for Ubuntu for a Windows machine, but I got a Mac...

Good Luck!\n", "Q: How Do I Reset my Ubuntu Password on a Laptop That Came with Windows 8 Pre-installed? My laptop came with Windows 8 pre-installed and uses UEFI (the successor to BIOS) by default. It has been working fine for me for a few months. I decided to install Ubuntu with the goal of a conventional dual-boot setup. I disabled Windows 8's Secure Boot and Fast Startup features to avoid any problems these might cause and shrunk my primary partition by 13 GB from within Windows 8 so that there would be some free space in which to install Ubuntu. I downloaded Ubuntu 12.04.3 on a separate Linux machine and used the ISO file to create a bootable USB drive with Startup Disk Creator. Then I booted my Windows 8 laptop from the USB drive, and successfully installed Ubuntu in the previously allocated free space. Then, dumb me, I immediately forgot my new password. When I reboot my machine it always brings me to Ubuntu without any prompts. I tried entering recovery mode to reset my Ubuntu password, but when I try pressing or holding the left Shift key at any point during the boot sequence, the boot sequence simply continues uninterrupted.  The page about recovery mode linked to in the previous sentence says that if I restart (as opposed to power down and power back on), I should meet with a prompt to enter recovery mode, but I don't. Any suggestions that would (a) enable me to boot Windows 8, (b) enable me to recover my password, and/or (c) enable me to re-install Ubuntu completely would be greatly appreciated. I have read that running Boot Repair would enable me to boot Windows 8, but as far as I understand that requires super user privileges (sudo).\n\nA: If standard UEFI, you should just be able to go into UEFI menu and choose to boot Windows.\nSome UEFI systems need escape rather than left shift key to get grub menu.\nYou can also immediately after UEFI/BIOS press down arrow once. Timing may be important, but grub menu remembers key press after BIOS but before menu appears. Once past menu then it will not matter.\nYou can run Boot-Repair from your installer, and chroot into your system to make just about any repair.\nBut is just a new install, it might be easier to just reinstall. Either delete existing partition and use install into unallocated or use manual install Something Else and choose the existing / (root) partition for new /. \n\nA: Oldfred's suggestions are good. One more: Prepare a USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager. (The linked-to page includes download links for image files for both USB flash drive and CD-R versions.) When you boot with that image, you should be able to boot both Windows and Linux. If you highlight the Linux option and hit F2 or Insert, you'll get a submenu that should let you boot into single-user mode; or if you hit F2 or Insert again, you'll be able to edit the kernel's boot options in any way you like. With any luck you'll then be able to change your root password. If you like rEFInd, you can install it to your hard disk by installing the Debian package version. If not, you'll need to adjust your GRUB configuration to make it give you a Windows option by running Boot Repair or by making changes manually.\nYet another option to get into Linux: Boot a Linux emergency disk, mount the Ubuntu partition, and edit the /etc/shadow file on that partition. You can then empty the password field for your account, which should enable you to log in with an empty password. Once in, reset your password immediately!\n", "Q: Upstart job not starting Can someone help me with a startup script not starting? I started it with initctl start startupScript, and it works fine.

I would like to port Ubuntu Touch to a device that is currently not supported. What are the requirements for doing this and where do I begin?\n\nA: I would first start by getting a rooted Linux(Android) device and make sure you have a 64-bit Ubuntu system. (a lot of ram would be good like 16 gigs if you can swing it, or at least that much available with a swap file or partition)\nIf your not familiar with CyanogenMod become familiar by installing and by building it. I say this because the guide you already mentioned clearly states:\n\nTo support a wide range of devices, we decided to use CyanogenMod as a base for the Android system. You could safely use AOSP, as we don't use a lot of the customizations and improvements done at the App/Java side, but it's easier with CyanogenMod due the scripts and build procedures available for it.\n\nIf your device is not listed here then check here. This is well documented and easy to follow and will help you better understand and has loads of guides.\nhttp://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Doc:_Building_Basics\nDepending on your preference, you may just want to start here:\nhttp://source.android.com/source/building.html\nThen go for the Cyanogenmod project, but I think your best bet is building Cyanogenmod. Once you have done that go back to the guide you mentioned. \nBottom line learn Android first, the more you can understand with Android the easier Ubuntu Touch will be to port.\n\nA: Ubuntu (Touch) 13.10 is released; it's stable for developers now. You can get the step-by-step guide here.\nHowever, I used the CyanogenMod. Check the building CyanogenMod guide to learn how to build it.\nBuilding from source for Android guide, and Building Ubuntu Touch wiki should help you as well.\nAfter it is ready, visit the Porting Ubuntu Touch guide along with the Ubuntu Phone Install guide given before.\nThe steps are:   \n\n\n*\n\n*Build Cyanomod   \n\n*Root Android   \n\n*Port\n\n\nThese links give you a fair idea of how you should proceed. The actual code to be used differs from device to device, due to the different drivers, (but, Terminal commands would remain roughly the same) and it's something you'd have to work on yourself with lots of trial & error.\nI tried porting to Lava Xolo Q800, which was built fine, and it installed too. But, it does nothing that a smartphone should do apart from connecting to WiFi. I've now reinstalled Android.\n\nA: These answers are very old. Modern, up to date instructions are here\nhttps://developer.ubuntu.com/en/phone/devices/installing-ubuntu-for-devices/\n\nA: After Canonical stopped development of Unity, and Ubuntu for devices, in early 2017, the task has been taken up by the UBports community.\nFor documentation on porting Ubuntu Touch now, one should go to https://docs.ubports.com/en/latest/porting/introduction/Intro.html\n", "Q: USB install will not work with i386 or amd64 iso Having trouble installing ubuntu.

I have ubuntu 13.04 and windows 7.  I heard that kubuntu is more like windows, so I wanted to try it.  Is it possible to triple boot them?  If it is can you tell me how to.  I have installed ubuntu on a partition.\n\nA: There is no need to dual boot between ubuntu and kubuntu.  You can simply install Ubuntu and if you also want to try kubuntu, you just install the kubuntu-desktop package and can select between the two desktops when you log in.\n", "Q: installation without cd or usb please help how do I install Ubuntu without having to burn to a cd or usb? I need this for class and the pop up for cd keeps coming up then it tells me my cd is too small\n\nA: There is a known bug with the images for Ubuntu, in that they don't fit onto a CD.  You need to burn them to a DVD, or write the image to a USB.  If you don't have a USB, you'll have to burn them to a blank DVD.\nOr, use the Minimal Images and put one onto a CD.  It'll only take a little bit of space.  However, if you need UEFI support, you will need a full disk to make it work.\n", "Q: What is the \"Public\" folder used for? In my home folder, there is a folder called Public. Why is it put there? Is there any reason a user shouldn't delete it? If it isn't needed perhaps a bug report should be filed, because it was there immediately after I installed the system. It seems to go missing after I delete it and reboot.\nI wasn't sure if this was 13.04 specific or not. If it isn't feel free to remove the 13.04 tag and this text.\n\nA: The Public folder is one of the default folders from xdg-user-dirs. It may be used by programs for files you want to share with others.\nIf you want to remove that folder you also need to change the file $HOME/.config/user-dirs.dirs: Replace the line\nXDG_PUBLICSHARE_DIR=\"$HOME/Public\"\n\nwith\nXDG_PUBLICSHARE_DIR=\"$HOME\"\n\nOtherwise the folder will be recreated the next time you log in.\n", "Q: Root Owns Home Directory, chown does not work I am running Ubuntu 12.04 and having various problems.  I have traced it back to the fact that my user's home directory (/home/user) is owned by root.  \nThe /home directory is actually mounted on another drive, but I can see that in fstab I am mounting only /home and not /home/user:\nUUID=DC56D19E56DX3233 /home ntfs user,exec 0 2\n\nThe chown command below does not seem to work:  \nsudo chown -R user /home/user\n\nThis will run without errors, however it does not actually change ownership of the direcory.  Here is the output of ls -ld after running the command:\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 20480 Sep 25 00:07 /home/user\n\nThis is the same as it was previously.\n\nA: The issue, as mentioned in the comments, was that my home directory was mounted on a different hard drive with an NTFS filesystem.\nI backed up my home directory with Deja Dup to an external drive. Then used gparted to format the internal NTFS drive and change the filesystem to EXT4.\nNext I changed /etc/fstab to match the new UUID of the drive and changed \"ntfs\" to \"ext4\".\nAfter restart, I had to press Ctrl+Alt+F1 to login in a terminal. I was there able to use sudo chown -R user:user /home/user.\nI was then able to login to the GUI, and restore my home directory using Deja Dup and the backup on my external drive.\nSo far, everything is working great.\n\nA: NTFS doesn't support Unix-style 'owners', so the Linux kernel is forced to assign an owner for the entire volume - normally, root.  As an alternative to moving your entire home directory to EXT4, you could also give ownership of the entire partition to a specific user or group using the 'uid' or 'gid' options for mount (or in fstab).  There are security implications in a multi-user environment, but I used this method on my dual-boot laptop.\nA long way inside the man page for mount (man mount), we find this under filesystem-specific options for NTFS:\nuid=value, gid=value and umask=value\nSet  the  file permission on the filesystem.  The umask value is given in octal.  By default, the files are owned by root and not readable by somebody else.\nYour line in fstab would then be changed to UUID=DC56D19E56DX3233 /home ntfs user,exec,uid=username,gid=group 0 2, and you'd be free to edit the umask if you wanted.\n", "Q: Problem converting my computer to ubuntu due to inability to navigate bios I wish to replace windows/vista operating system on an old Lenovo/IBM computer with ubuntu.

Please check if one of them works.\n", "Q: Terminal and software center missing I cannot find either the Ubuntu Software center or the terminal anywhere on my computer.

As a result I could not build the program. I have never faced this problem before. Do I have to download and save all the headers in the project directory? Please help.\n\nA: Geany doesn't have nothing to do with this. I'm sure that you will get the same errors if you are compiling your program from terminal. This because conio.h is specific to the Windows environment. Use ncurses.h library on Unix like systems; its functions are similar to ones in conio.h. \nSee http://tldp.org/HOWTO/NCURSES-Programming-HOWTO/.\n", "Q: how do i format my hard drive to ntfs from ext4 I have a usb with my windows ISO loaded and ready. Problem is there is no ntfs partition on my hard drive for windows to load onto. I don't want to complicate things by running 2 operating systems. I’d like to go back to windows. I like Ubuntu more but I have no clue what I’m doing. I’m not a programmer.\nI’ve tried booting from my usb with windows 7 loaded on as well as a CD with vista ultimate. Neither gave me an option to repair my drive. Both have the option to delete partition, and the CD gave me the option to format partition. The formatting failed and I’m afraid to delete the partition because I don't know what to do if I delete Ubuntu and the drive remains in ext4 format.\nPlease help.\n\nA: The first thing is that this is not the right place to ask this question. This is Ubuntu Forum and not Windows Forum and this question should be placed in Windows Forum if there is any.\nAnother piece of valuable information is Ubuntu is not for developers. It is for everyone. My dad who is 65 uses this and he is comfortable with Ubuntu than Windows. I still recommend you should continue to use Ubuntu and not to switch back to Windows. \nTo answer your question, if you have a Ubuntu live CD or USB, you should boot it with that, run gparted from there, then delete the partitions. Then you can create NTFS partitions from there. Once you restart, windows should able to read the partitions. \nNOTE: If Windows bootable USB still do not recognize your hdd, then you will left with no OS on the system. You have been warned. \n", "Q: how to format my computer, wipe out windows, and set it with only ubuntu? I am absolutely new to linux and don't know a whole lot about this, but I'm trying to learn!  \nI already looked through old questions and it seems that usually the installation of Ubuntu offers the option of replacing the old windows instead of running Ubuntu alongside it, but I never got that option.  Because my computer is a two year old netbook and is getting super slow, I would like to format it and run only one OS, just need it for the basics (School, email, music...).  \nSo now, I have both Ubuntu (I think its 12.04.3 LTS) and Win 7 Starter on my computer, how should I go about this?\n\nA: I am not very clear. You already have Ubuntu along with Windows if my understanding is correct. Then login every time in to Ubuntu. If you just want more disk space you need not reinstall the whole OS. All that you need to do is take the data backup and delete windows partition and reformat them. But when you boot, it will still show you that it can boot into Windows but if you select that option, it will not boot. That can also be fixed using the below commands.\nCheck \nsudo gedit /etc/grub.d/30_custom or sudo gedit /etc/grub.d/40_custom. You should find the windows booting sequence. Remove the windows related items, save and close. After that run the below command to update the grub.\nsudo update-grub2\nThis should fix the problem. \n\nA: This is where you need to bring out the big guns. Use Darik's Boot And Nuke to zero out the drive and MBR. Then rerun the Ubuntu installer.\n\nA: Use the liveUSB (I'm presuming that you did use the liveUSB to install 12.04.3 in the first place), then, when the installer comes up, there would be 3 options. You can install Ubuntu alongside Windows, completely replace the Win system or you could create a custom partition table using gparted(supported out of the box in the liveUSB). Choose the option where you could completely replace Windows, and the installer would do the rest. It'll format your entire disk to the ext format,install all that is necessary, and that's about it, you'd be good to go after that.\n", "Q: Unbale to use Q(lowercase) key after a failed key-binding effort I tried to use the Alt-q combination to set as a shortcut for opening 'terminator' using gconf -> metacity-> global keybindings.

So you can safely install and uninstall without affecting Windows.\nFinally, in your situation, you installed Windows 8 over Windows 7. This means that the boot entry and the registry entries are all gone. All you have left is the C:\\ubuntu folder. So, running wubi-uninstall.exe won't work. For you to install fresh, you just have to delete that folder and then run wubi.exe again.\n", "Q: Dual Boot with Two Different HDDs? have two HDDs, one with Windows 8 installed on it, and one with Ubuntu 12.10 installed on it.\nSeeing as Ubuntu is not installed alongside Windows, I can only assume that Windows doesn't even see Ubuntu.\nMy problem is that, I want to be able to select a device to boot from a bios menu. I know that Windows Boot Manager will not work and my bios keeps giving me the only option of selecting a \"Boot First Device\", which sequentially changes the boot priority via the bios permanently unless I change it back.\nUltimately I want to be able to have a choice when I turn on my computer, but am not given that option. My motherboard specs are as follows:\n\nMotherboard: Gigabyte Z68XP-UD3 (Intel Socket 1155)\nBios: Award Software International, Inc. (Version 8)\n\nAny ideas? Without having to change wires every time I wanted to load a different operating system? Or how to have a selection every time my computer is turned on, without changing the boot sequence?\nThank you so much! Aaron\n\nA: I have a similar situation where I have Windows on my primary HDD and Ubuntu on the other (obtained by breaking the RAID). I can choose between Windows and Ubuntu by setting my boot priority on to the Ubuntu HDD. However, it sometimes automatically boots into Windows without giving me options to choose Windows or Ubuntu (which I believe is because of the automatic reset of boot priority). \nVinu \n", "Q: Nexus 7 (2013) slow USB transfer, messy file browsing Working with Ubuntu 13.04, connecting my Nexus 7 (2nd gen, 2013) via MTP works fine. I just connect the Nexus 7 and Nautilus immediately opens up in the correct directory. No more need to fiddle around with third-party tools as suggested here.\nThere are two issues that are really bugging me, though:\n\n\n*\n\n*Transferring files via USB is really slow. I am using USB 3.0 but Nautilus says my transfer rate is fixed at about 1MB/s which is way too slow for USB 3.0. This might be a problem of calculating the correct transfer rate but I can tell you that the transfer speed is nowhere near the full potential of USB 3.0\n\n*Navigating files on the Nexus 7 is quirky. This might be an MTP issue but it just feels odd. If I create a new directory on my Nexus 7 via Nautilus, I need to \"refresh\" the current directory (i.e. move to the parent directory and enter the subdirectory again) so that the newly created directory becomes visible for me.\n\n\nMy USB works fine using other devices such as flash drives and USB HDDs.\nI haven't found any advice on these problems yet and I'm not sure whether this affects others as well. \n\nA: i have the same issue and after replace the microusb with new fresh one the problem solved altough channging the cable may solve it easier\n", "Q: If I close a terminal does it kill the processes inside of it?

So I have to search a directory for files that are of 3 character length. That is easy, the problem is that at least 1 of the 3 characters needs to be either a \"B\" or a \"y\". I know that [By] would make sure the character is either a B or a y, however simply doing [By][By][By] would not suffice since it is not a requirement for all 3 characters to be either B or y; only 1 of them has to be. Please help.\n\nA: Try this command(s):\ncd /path/to/directory\nls | while read file; do if [ ${#file} -eq 3 ]; then echo $file; fi; done | grep '[By]'\n\nor:\nfor file in ???; do echo $file; done | grep '[By]'\n\nor, a variant without any loop:\nls | grep -ow '\\w\\{3\\}' | grep '[By]'\n\nls will list all files from the current directory, then we select only the filenames that have exactly 3 characters in length and finally, using grep, we select only filenames that contain B or y.\n\nA: printf '%s\\n' ??? | grep '[By]'\n\nThe printf '%s\\n' prints each argument passed to it, one-per-line; the ??? is a glob that expands to every three-character filename in the working directory. This is piped to the grep, which prints only those filenames containing the pattern you specified.\nBy the way, I found myself using printf '%s\\n' so much that I put the following in my ~/.bashrc for ease-of-typing:\nalias necho='printf \"%s\\n\"'  ##  newline-echo\n\nMost of the time this will be fine: it will break on filenames containing newlines, but those are pretty rare in fact (I've only ever seen them when I've made them specifically to test scripts of mine). It's probably possible to whip up a simple pure bash solution using extglob, but you could also use find to work around this issue:\nfind . -name '???' -a -name '*[By]*'\n\nThis will act recursively by default; if you don't want that, use -maxdepth 1.\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -name '???' -a -name '*[By]*'\n\n\nA: You can do a pattern match in a for-loop.\nfor file in ./???; do\n    [[ -e $file && $file = *[By]* ]] || continue\n    printf 'Do stuff with <%s>\\n' \"$file\"\ndone\n\nOr you can enable extended globs by running shopt -s extglob. Then you can use something like @([By]??|?[By]?|??[By])\nshopt -s extglob\nfor file in ./@([By]??|?[By]?|??[By]); do\n    [[ -e $file ]] || continue\n    printf 'Do stuff with <%s>\\n' \"$file\"\ndone\n\nEither will be more efficient than involving grep.\nIf you're scripting for POSIX sh, you could do something like this:\nfor file in ./???; do\n    [ -e \"$file\" ] || continue\n    case $file in \n        *[By]*) : ;;\n        *) continue;;\n    esac\n    printf 'Do something with <%s>\\n' \"$file\"    \ndone\n\nLastly, you could use three globs, though that will iterate the files in a different order and you risk iterating the same file multiple times.\nfor file in ./[By]?? ./?[By]? ./??[By]; do\n    [ -e \"$file\" ] || continue\n    printf 'Do something with <%s>\\n' \"$file\"    \ndone\n\n", "Q: Can I have a live matrix wallpaper on Ubuntu 13.04?

Unfortunately though, both of these scenarios cannot be exactly accomplished, due to the opening sentence of this answer.\nIf you want to give a user read-only access to a specific folder under the Windows partition, that user will have read-only access to the whole partition. If this is okay with you, then here's an explanation on how to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, create a group for the users that will have read-only access. For the sake of this example, we'll use WindowsRO. So, the command to create the group is:\nsudo groupadd WindowsRO\n\n*Second, we'll add the users (that we want to give read-only access to) to the group. Assuming that a user is called notadmin, this is the command:\nsudo usermod -a -G WindowsRO notadmin\nRepeat this command for all the required users.\n\n*Now, we need to get the GID (group ID) of the group, because we'll use it when mounting the drive. To do that, execute the following:\ngrep WindowsRO /etc/group | cut -d: -f3\nNote down the number that's outputted, because we'll need that in step 5. For this example, I'll assume the output is 1003.\n\n*Now, we need to get the UID (user ID) of the admin account, because we'll use it when mounting the drive. This example will assume that the admin account is bob. To do that, execute the following:\ngrep bob /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f3\nNote down the number that's outputted, because we'll need that in step 5. For this example, I'll assume the output is 1000.\n\n*We will now edit the /etc/fstab file. I'll assume that the Windows partition in question is /dev/sda2, that you're mounting it on /media/123, and that it's an ntfs partition. This is the line that you should have:\n/dev/sda2    /media/123    ntfs    rw,gid=1003,uid=1000,dmask=027,fmask=037,#AnyOtherOptions#\n\n\n*\n\n*gid=1003 is the number we got from step 3 (the GID of the group).\n\n*uid=1000 is the number we got from step 4 (the UID of the admin account).\n\n*dmask=027 sets the permissions on folders to be: -rwxr-x---, which means that the owner (the admin account) will have full access (rwx), and the group will only have read access (r-x), and anyone else will not have access at all (---).\n\n*fmask=037 sets the permissions on files to be: -rwxr-----. This is similar to dmask; the group will only have read access to files.\n\n*You should substitute #AnyOtherOptions# with whatever other options you have. For example, you might have auto which automatically mounts the partition on startup.\n\n\n*Once the above is done, do sudo mount -a to apply the changes we did to the fstab file. Hopefully, you shouldn't get any errors.\nYou should now test that the users can access the partition. If yes, move on the the next step to add that A link to their Documents folder.\n\n*Assuming that the home directory for our notadmin account is /home/notadmin, and that this A folder is at /media/123/some/folder/A, do the following:\nln -s /media/123/some/folder/A /home/notadmin/Documents/A\nYou should now see a link under notadmin's Documents, pointing to A. He will only have read access to it (and its subdirectories, since he has read-only access to the whole partition). Follow the same thing for other users.\nAll of the above should meet your requirements, except for the point I mentioned at the beginning: what kind of access should the user have to the rest of the partition? The above will give them read-only access to the whole partition, and not just the A partition; we're not able to set permissions to specific files/folders when mounting Windows partitions.\n\nA: Simply possible with overlayfs\nGuide to mount a Windows folder in readonly mode for normal user (write mode for root or another user)\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a mount point for ROOT user\nsudo mkdir /root/win\n\n\n*Create a mount point for normal user\nmkdir /home/$USER/folder\nmkdir /tmp/folder\n\n\n*Mount Windows partion in write mode\nsudo mount /dev/disk/by-label/winOS /root/win\n\n\n*Mount Windows partion's folder in readonly mode\nsudo mount -t overlayfs -o ro,lowerdir=/root/win/folder,upperdir=/tmp/folder  overlayfs /home/$USER/folder\n\nAccess writable windows partition as root user \nsudo nautilus /root/win\n\nAccess readonly windows partition's folder\nnautilus /home/$USER/folder\n\n\nA: If you want to mount a writable directory in readonly mode on another location, can use bind mount.  \nFor example mount home directory in readonly mode @ /tmp/home\nsudo mount --bind ~ /tmp/home\nsudo mount -o ro,remount  /tmp/home\n\nIf you want readonly access ot a specific folder for normal user then mount the partition in an unreachable location (Example /root/abc).\n", "Q: How to access network shares? I am using intranet using run command in Windows by directly typing the intranet address like \\172.16.0.11 and pressing enter. Then a tab opens for username and password.

(Note: The deb file is under /pkg/ subfolder, but it contains an old version (0.12.3) of hostsblock, which is now at 0.999.x) \nIt does more or less the same job as hostsman (updating your hosts file to prevent access to \"undesirable\" sites) but it only does it in the background almost without you noticing it ever ;-)  \nUPDATE: Now there's a new DEB package including a simple GUI -app indicator- with kwak daemon as well which is available here:\nhttps://github.com/Sadi58/hostsblock/tree/master/indicator\n\n", "Q: Amd Radeon HD 7400M series driver not found where can i find the driver of AMD Radeon HD 7400m Series For Win 8...\nI tried too Many Times But Cannot find...Always this note has show that \"you hardware not compatible with your driver\"\n\nA: Download the original drivers from: http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/linux/Pages/radeon_linux.aspx.\nAfter extracting the archive, run sh ./ati-driver-installer-x86.x86_64.run.\nThat helped me, I hope it will help you.\n", "Q: Does Hauppauge WinTVR 900H work with Digital TV in the UK I have been trying to sort out my Hauppauge WinTV 900H USB Tuner.

Everything worked fine, I quited liked it (pretty new to Linux), and I thought I'd add it to my PC as a dual boot with Windows 8.\nSo, I put the same CD in my PC, ran through the install, selecting exactly the same options (except for the dual boot), but it's different. When I booted (selecting Ubuntu from the GRUB menu), I was presented with a screen saying Xbubtu.\nFrom what I understand it is designed primarily for machines that do not have the recommended specs for Ubuntu, but not only is my PC considerably more powerful than the Revo, I was never offered a choice.\nFirst and foremost, can anyone explain why this would have been installed and not the proper version of Ubuntu? And I'd like to reiterate - until I started booting, Xubuntu had not been mentioned, and and was certainly not asked if I'd like to install that instead.\nNext, I wonder how I can safely remove it? I'd like to not have to faff about fixing my MBR, so is there a way to safely remove Xununtu without affecting it? Thanks.\n\nA: You don't need to re-install, drop to a command prompt from xubuntu StartButton?  ---> Accessories ---> Terminal Emulator and enter the following commands.\nsudo apt-get update;sudo apt-get install -y ubuntu-desktop\n\nLog out and log in using the ubuntu desktop instead of xubuntu and you are good.\n\nA: I have no clue how you installed that without using the wrong download / cd. Are you sure you did not download Xu onto another cd and pick that one up by accident? \nJust re-download Ubuntu, burn it to a cd, hold it in your hand and walk over to the computer, put it in, remove the partition that has the Xu installed, and install Ubuntu over that partition. \n", "Q: Changing numeric language from konsole in Kubuntu how to change the numeric language to English from terminal & why the games are not working? \n\nA: Sounds like you want to change your locale settings. \n\n\n*\n\n*Type locale in the console and observer what comes up (Note if LC_ALL= is set to something, this over rides all other settings). \n\n*If you want to change the numbers to english decimal (en_US.UTF-8), enter the following:\nsu - (switch to root)\nexport LC_NUMBERIC=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nTry it out now and see. \nEnvironment variables implement the locale codes. For example LANG=en_US.UTF-8 specifies that the computer uses US English with a UTF-8 encoding when displaying information.\nNote: Type in locale -a to ensure you have the en_US.UTF-8 installed.

Since I'm doing this the other way around things are going to be different.\nPlease note that this is Preemptive, I have not installed Windows yet, it is more about what I need to do to protect Ubuntu from getting wiped out or damaged when I do install Windows.\nRestoring my Linux from a backup is something I want to avoid if possible.\nI'm thinking that if I backup the MBR before installing Windows and then restore it after installing Windows then the grub and Linux would be intact. I could then just boot to Linux and from Terminal update grub to include Windows.\nBooting to a Live CD to restore Grub after the fact may also be an option if needed, but I would like to avoid that as well.\n\nA: It's difficult to provide a step-by-step guide for Windows (7/8) installation, but I guess it should be possible to tell Windows to use only the first partition.\nYou will then lose the Grub menu which you can restore IMHO more easily if you use Clonezilla (e.g. in Parted Magic Live) to clone your Ubuntu partition. See also: https://askubuntu.com/questions/260280/comparing-disk-partition-os-cloning-tools\nIn that case you'll simply need to update grub (using sudo update-grub command in Terminal) to have the newly installed Windows added to the boot menu. See also: How can I repair grub? (How to get Ubuntu back after installing Windows?)\nSo I suggest the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Save your 2nd (Ubuntu) partition using Clonezilla (e.g. in Parted Magic\nLive CD/USB)\n\n*Install Windows in your 1st partition\n\n*Restore your Ubuntu partition using Clonezilla (e.g. in Parted Magic\nLive CD/USB)\n\n*Start your computer, go to Ubuntu desktop, open Terminal, and enter sudo update-grub to add Windows to the Grub menu\n\n\nA: I was right, I backed up the MBR before installing Windows 8 and then restored it after installing Windows 8 then the grub and Linux were intact. I booted to Linux and from Terminal updated grub to include Windows.  This was the easiest way to do this.\n", "Q: What about a Distro dedicated to engineers? I am Raihan Ali.

Besides I am now unable to remove it using apt-get remove.

I want Ubuntu to be my only OS. \nHere https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI I read some instructions on how install Ubuntu on a UEFI system.

The problem is, I can find neither Quickboost nor the Intel Smart Response Technology in my BIOS.\nI tried to simply boot from USB but this didn't work. In this case, the Lenovo Logo appears and nothing happens.\n\nA: In theory, you diable UEFI booting. In your BIOS it should look like this:\n\nChange ENABLED to DISABLED and boot the USB. Usually you use the arrow keys to go up and down and once UEFI is highlighted, hit enter.\nIf you do NOT have that option, see if there is an update available for your BIOS.\nIn practice, all I could find is a thread on the forums where the netbook was \"DOA\" due to a \"bug in the BIOS\"\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2093845\nYou may have to contact Lenovo directly.

Apache is a system-wide web server, and Ubuntu is a multi-user system.

You'll likely see:\n/usr/bin/mail\n\nThen see what this is:\n$ ls -l /usr/bin/mail           # And now you'll likely see (at least for Debian):\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 22 Feb 17  2019 /usr/bin/mail -> /etc/alternatives/mail\n\nThen see where that is:\n$ ls -l /etc/alternatives/mail  # And I get:\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 23 Dec 10 19:58 /etc/alternatives/mail -> /usr/bin/mail.mailutils\n\nAnd finally check this out:\n$ ls -l /usr/bin/mail.mailutils\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 218160 Nov 18  2020 /usr/bin/mail.mailutils\n\nSo when you are running mail, you are actually running mail.mailutils.  Also notice that it's owned by root, but everyone has permission to run read and execute it.\n\nNow looking at the configuration documentation for the mailutils package, we see that there are many possible methods for configuration, including:\n\n*\n\n*System wide configuration in /etc/mailutils.conf, or\n\n\n*User over-rides in /home/[your-username]/.mail, or even\n\n\n*Startup overrides with mail --file /var/mail/[your-username]\nSettings from method 2 overrides method 1, and method 3 overrides both methods 2 and 1.\nOne important point is that the mailbox format doesn't have to be mbox (single large files with multiple messages in each file).  It can also be mailbox format (or a tree of individual files).  There are also other formats available, like mh.\nFor the first two options above you will likely want to use a URL\nmailbox {\n       # Create mailbox URL using PATTERN.  \n       #   (preferred way of configuring mailbox locations)\n       mailbox-pattern PATTERN;\n}\n\nLike this:\nmailbox { mailbox-pattern \"/var/mail/${user}\"; }\n\n\nAnother important point is that your system has two places for your mailboxes:\n\n*\n\n*Incoming messages are in one place, typically /var/mail/[username], and\n\n*read messages are, depending on the mailbox format, in either:\n\n*\n\n*/home/[your-username]/mbox   or\n\n*/home/[your-username]/mailbox/*.\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using any of the mailutils programs, you can see how your system is configured with:\n$ mailutils info           # which gives you something like this:\nVERSION=3.10\nSYSCONFDIR=/etc\nMAILSPOOLDIR=/var/mail\nSCHEME=mbox\nLOG_FACILITY=mail\n...\n\n\nFinally, don't confuse the two different uses of the term 'spool' as related to mail.  exim4 has what it calls a spool, which is where it holds messages waiting to be delivered, and then when you go to read emails some people say you're reading from the mail spool.  It is probably better to remember that you're reading from a mailbox, and that only exim4 has a spool.  For locally delivered messages exim4 reads a message from it's spool, and puts it into your mailbox, normally in /var/mail/[your-username] if you're using mbox.\nAlso note that you must be in the mail group, as others above have clarified.  What they didn't tell you was that you might need to reboot to make your addition to the mail group stick and show up when you open a terminal window.  Simply opening another terminal windows won't have you in that group, and logging out and re-logging in won't fix it either.\n\nSo now that you know which mailbox you're trying to read, you can look at it's permissions to see if you need to update them or not.\n", "Q: Revert default folder (Images) I accidently moved /home/user/Desktop/Images folder to Desktop, and I thought that folder is just copy of original one so I deleted it, but it seems I moved it to Desktop and now I don't have Images folder.

I had set a cron job:\n20 * * * * /usr/bin/sh /home/lucky/myfile.sh\n\nThe main problem is that at the schedule time, there is an error:\n\"mail have sent to /var/spool/mail/lucky\".\nThe contents of myfile.sh is:\nmkdir jh\ncd jh \n\n\nA: This is not ok for a script which is set as a cron job:\nmkdir jh\ncd jh \n\nYou should give the full path where jh directory must to be created. Also, in this path you should have permission to create new files/directories. \nFor example, your script should look like:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nmkdir /home/lucky/jh\ncd /home/lucky/jh\n\nAlso /usr/bin/sh is not the right path for sh. The right path is /bin/sh. You can check this with whereis sh command. And even so, your cron job should look like:\n20 * * * * /home/lucky/myfile.sh\n\nDon't forget to make the script executable:\nchmod +x /home/lucky/myfile.sh\n\n\nA: The path where this seems to be creating the folder at is / . This is because the crontab requires full path to folder and files  in all the files that it executes .\nSo the path in the myfile.sh should be\nmkdir <absolutePath>/jh\ncd <absolutePath>/jh\n20 * * * * /usr/bin/sh /home/lucky/myfile.sh This line is correct though you should check the path to see if sh exists at /usr/bin/sh or not (use which sh to see the path where sh exists; mine was /bin/sh)\nIf you are in a hurry to start writing crontab this link has pretty good examples \nhttp://www.thegeekstuff.com/2009/06/15-practical-crontab-examples/\n", "Q: Hyperdesktop alternative for Ubuntu 13.04 I recently switched from Windows 7 to Ubuntu 13.04. \nI found most software that I used on Windows for Ubuntu.

I'm following this: \nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu\nand I know a lot of boot-disk creation stuff will wipe my USB---it's 30GB which is more than I can comfortably back up to my HD right now, but I would like to install ubuntu on a friend's machine.\nThese instructions say: \"If you’re not yet sure about installing Ubuntu, you can try it out without affecting your current system.\" So, that suggests there won't be any deleting, but I'm hesitant to push the \"Make startup disk\" button here:\n]\n...when there's a button so nearby called \"Erase Disk\" so close by---I would never want erasing my disk to be an option if it weren't necessary.  Can someone confirm for me for sure whether this operation will delete my USB contents?\n\nA: Creating an Ubuntu boot disk on your USB stick will wipe the contents of such USB stick, as far as I know. I'd recoomend to back up your data. But, why use a 30GB disk for that task? a 4GB USB stick will do the work and is quite inexpensive.\n\nA: Well, I decided to chance it (I have no capacity to make backups, but needed the install disk).  \nClicking \"make startup disk\" without erasing the disk produced the un-informative error \"installation failed.\" I assume it might work if I erased the disk, but don't know for sure.\nAnyhow, I can provide an answer to my own question---no, clicking on that button will not in itself format your disk.  BUT you may need to format your disk to make any use of this program.\n\nA: As far as I know, the \"Make Startup Disk\" option doesn't erase the disk, \"Erase disk\" will. When you create a bootable disk, you only append files to your USB device, not overwrite the contents. \nIf you wish to check this, try it on a USB device containing not-so-important data.\n\nA: Almost all my USB data drives also contain a live system, usually System Rescue CD.  But I added a data folder AFTER creating the startup drives.\nIn theory there is no need to wipe the data: an install USB drive is just a file system + a file tree + boot code in the master boot record/sector of the drive.  It can carry and keep all sorts of other data.  \nIn practice, it all depends on the procedure. You could indeed manually transfer the content of the ISO + manually install grub.\nI don't know anyone who does it with Ubuntu, and it seems to me that none of the previous answers refers to this.\nThis leaves using the graphical-interface startup creator tools.\nWith the standard Ubuntu tool I too always got errors trying to avoid blanking the drive.  If you look for informal bug reports in forums you find a lot of them.\nAlternative startup-disk makers like unetbootin seem to wipe the drive as well.\n", "Q: How do I find the interface of Rhythmbox? I opened a mp3, thus started Rhythmbox and then minimized the UI. Now I can't find a way to find the UI anymore, it's not in the taskbar nor can I access it from alt-tab.

From there type in 'Rhythmbox' and you can access it from there. \nAlso, I would suggest dragging the icon on to the taskbar for speedy access when doing this in future.\n:)\n", "Q: Automated Backups + Encryption I have set up my Ubuntu 12.04LTS machine as a Subversion server. I have a cloud-based backup system which routinely backs up files of mine (CrashPlan) to an online server, as well as to a backup NAS on my local network.\nI am skeptical of the security any of these solutions really provides, so the bulk of my work is stored in a secure TrueCrypt partition with multiple independent keys. I back it up automatically, but it cannot be backed up while in use, so I would have to endure some downtime during each backup, which is not acceptable in this case.\nI am looking for a way, in Ubuntu, to have certain folders of mine backed up automatically as a single archived file (ie: tar.bz2, or similar), and heavily encrypted either via a passphrase, or a passphrase-protected private key, using at least AES256.\nAre there any straightforward, UI-based backup applications for Ubuntu that are \"tried and true\", and can schedule automatic, \"hot\" backups of folders to another location on my local machine, and automatically encrypt them? The plan would be to add this backup destination to the list of folders my cloud backup system monitors. This way, the files themselves are already encrypted such that I possess the only key, in case the cloud backup company is compromised.\nI know I could write some cron jobs and shell scripts to accomplish this easily enough, but time does not permit right now to test the scripts extensively enough to guarantee that they are fail safe.\nThank you.\n\nA: The other requirements needed to enable AES256 were found here:\nHow can I make Deja Dup use AES 256 as the encryption algorithm?\n", "Q: What does “imagemagick [security]\" mean in the online package list? If I search for the package \"imagemagick\" in http://packages.ubuntu.com/ it gives me the result and the word security written like this: [security]. Does it mean it is in the main repository?\nAnother result is that the package is also provided by graphicsmagick-imagemagick-compat which is in the universe repository.\nDoes this mean that the same package is provided twice? Would it also be possible that when a package is installed but the respective repository is disabled as the source the needed package would be installed from ather repository?\n\nA: The mark [security] means that the package comes from the security updates repository, rather than the main repository. The security updates repository is always enabled and you should never disable it. It contains packages that are identical to the original package from the main repository except that one or more security vulnerabilities have been fixed.\nThe same package is also provided in the <version>-updates repositories. These repositories contain bug fixes and other recommended updates. These updates are pushed in batches, unlike security updates which are released as soon as possible.\nThat the package imagemagick is also provided by graphicsmagick-imagemagick-compat is unrelated. Graphicsmagick is a software project that started as a modification of Imagemagick and then evolved independently. Graphicsmagick includes an interface that is compatible with Imagemagick; this interface is distributed in the package graphicsmagick-imagemagick-compat. If you have graphicsmagick-imagemagick-compat installed, then packages that depend on imagemagick will work, therefore the graphicsmagick-imagemagick-compat package declares that it provides imagemagick. You can choose which implementation you prefer.\nUbuntu will automatically install the most recent version of a package among the repositories that are enabled on your system (except for versions or repositories that are excluded from automatic installations through preferences — for example, backport repositories are set up so that you only get backported packages upon explicit request).\n", "Q: PC Pentium 4 on an HP pavilion.

And you can guess, I have messed up my HD not paying attention to this. IS there anyway to proceed the way I am trying to do or I have to take the HD out of the PC so there won't be any accidents.\n\nA: If I understand you correctly, it sounds like you may need to simply switch your boot order. It sounds like the computer's BIOS/UEFI stuff is telling the computer to boot from the HDD before it tests the USB drive. \nWhen you start your computer, watch the corners of the screen for a line of text that says something like 'F12 for BIOS' or some variant thereof. Some usual keystrokes are \"del\", \"F12\", \"F10\" and \"F2\". This should take you to a screen that has some tabs. Once there, look around for something like \"Boot Devices\" and once you find that, \"Boot Device Priority\" or \"Boot Order\" should be close by. Move the USB Entry above the HDD entry and you should be able to boot from the USB without removing your USB.\n== Also ==\nIn some instances (like my own motherboard that I had to flash update, a GA-970A-UD3 GigaByte board), booting from USB didn't work, so I needed to update my motherboards BIOS.

I recently installed Ubuntu and am multi-booting with Windows 7, but I would like to switch over to Linux full time. Now I am seeing that it runs a lot slower; I have a few examples: \nI've tried playing Euro truck Simulator 2 and now I can't even run it when before it would run fine on max settings, also when I open up a web browser it takes forever to load up. I do have 8GB of RAM and 3.6GHz CPU, so I don't think that that is the problem.\nI'm quite new to Ubuntu so i could just be something stupid, but this is a problem.\n\nA: It's generally a matter of whether your CPU and/or GPU is better optimized on Windows or Linux kernel you are using. In addition, there may be performance differences b/w Windows and Ubuntu on the device drivers with your peripherals or GPU.  Manufacturers usually provide-optimized device drivers to Windows (e.g., Nvidia).\n\nA: Is it a laptop or a stationary system? I've seen weird laptop configurations where your cpu will scale up but not enough to trigger the underlying system to increase it's performance.  To see if that's the issue do sudo apt-get install turbostat && sudo modprobe msr && sudo turbostat. Use the system for a bit and look at the ghz column, it should scale up to what you expect (including turbo boost).\nWhat's more likely though is that it's a GPU issue. What kind of GPU do you have in the system?\n", "Q: Will changing the repository in the software center affect sources.list I have all repositories activated (main, universe, multiverse, restricted) in the software center per default. If I make changes (e.g. I would uncheck the box for multiverse) I cannot install the software from this repository anymore using software center.\nWill it be possible to install the software from multiverse using \"apt-get\"?\n\nA: No, it will not be possible. apt-get works with the repositories that are defined in sources.list, as the software center does.\nYou'll find this kind of \"layered\" systems in many places in linux. To illustrate this, let's look at how an application is installed \"low level\". To install an application, several (in most cases, many) applications need to be copied to several (or many) different directories. The executable file needs to go to one directory, some libraries need to go to another directory, some manuals (man pages) need to go to yet another directory, some icons need to go to still another directory, and so forth. When you want to deinstall the application later, you'd have to \"tidy up\" all those files in all those different places.\nTo make this easier, there's the package manager dpkg. A deb package (named this because it was originally developed for Debian, which Ubuntu is based on) is, more or less, an archive that contains files with the information where those files should go. When you install a package, the files are copied to the appropriate places; when you deinstall it, the files are removed. To do this, the \"usual\", low level tools like for example tar are used. This illustrates the concept: dpkg uses what is already there to simplify a task. \nAdditionally, a package mostly has dependencies. A package can say, \"if you want to install me, you need to install this other package as well, because it contains files I need\". Or, \"if you want to install me, you can't install this other package, because our files would conflict\". Again, there's an additional layer on top of \"copy some files to the right directories\", that uses what's already there.\nThe next question would be, where do I get those packages? This is where the next layer comes in, the apt tools (apt-get, apt-cache and so on). With apt, you can manage package sources, so called repositories, where it can automatically fetch packages. A repository can be on a server somewhere in the net, on a CD or DVD, on your local hard disk and so forth. Which repositories are available is defined in sources.list. From these repositories, the apt tools build a cache, which is essentially a list of the packages that are available from the repositories.\nSo if you install a package with apt-get, it is fetched from the respective repository and handed to dpkg. dpkg, in turn, installs the package like described above, with tools like tar. \nIn the next layer, there are GUI tools like Synaptic or the software center. They offer the possibility to manage your packages with a graphical interface instead of \"only\" on the command line. The GUI tools \"under the hood\" hand the work over to the apt tools, which (as described) use dpkg, which uses tools like tar. So, apt-get can't possibly know about any repositories the software center doesn't know about. In fact, it's the other way around: The software center works \"on top\" of apt's cache, so it can only know about the repositories that are defined in sources.list.\nThe description above can of course only be an outline, with many details and additional features of the respective layers omitted. For example, there's the sources.list.d directory in which additional repositories can be defined. They, of course, apply to the apt tools as well to GUI tools like the software center. Another example, the software center not only offers to manage your packages with a graphical interface, but offers the possibility to sell and buy packages as well. \n", "Q: Startup freeze, Games crash, Youtube crashes, no sound I have installed Ubuntu for the first time on my Asus k55n, and it fails sometimes to boot up to the normal login screen, it usually just is purple and has dots, Steam games crash as soon as I boot them, the sound icon on the top right has the speaker with --- coming out of it, and no options when I click on it...

This program has a few Tabs, the last Tab should be named \"Additional Drivers\". You can choose a fitting proprietary driver there and apply it. You'll be asked for a password. It will install it automatically, which will take a while. You'll need this for many steam games, especially 3D games.\nIf you are lucky there is also a driver for your sound card, which may solve your Audio problems. According to the Asus homepage, they seem to have an unusual (\"Sonic Master Lite, Altec Lansing® Speakers\") Soundsystem. \nFixing the video problem could maybe also fix your booting problem, but this is just a guess. I'm not experienced with UEFI but you could take a look into it and show whether it offers something useful. Like disabling some secure boot features or something.\nYoutube\nYoutube should work if you use Firefox and install this plugin: \nhttps://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/flashplugin-installer/\nIt works at least for me.

Modern partitioning tools align on boundaries of 2048 sectors, which works out to 1MiB boundaries. More-or-less all of them align the start points, and some align the end points, too. End points may also be adjusted to handle size issues in the filesystem, which could result in sizes that are multiple of various values, depending on the filesystem and its settings. I have no idea what these values might be for NTFS, but it's entirely possible that they're forcing the partition to be sized such that there's a 2.02MiB gap at the end of the disk. Note that 2.02MiB is puny by the standards of your 465.76GiB disk -- it's just 0.0004235%.

PlayOnLinux is a tool that is used to simplify the use of Wine, which in turn is way to run Windows applications on Ubuntu, or GNU+Linux in general. \nThe most likely explanation is that you've downloaded the Windows version. In that case, it makes perfect sense that its files will be stored in the location you specified. Afterwards, you've probably installed the Ubuntu version, which would store its data in /tmp. Then you've simply run the \"wrong\" version of Skype and the files will have ended up in a place you didn't expect. If you search for Skype in Dash, I would expect that you get two icons for it, but since I haven't tested, I can't say that for sure. If you do have both the Windows and Ubuntu versions of Skype, then I recommend that you remove the Windows version. \nPlease do install updates. Ubuntu is safe and secure, but only as long as you install updates. It is quite important. In this case, however, nothing in your answer seems suspicious in any way. \n", "Q: How to get avast! on computer after getting the download?

If this machine is located behind a NAT router (e.g in your home network) you will need to tell the router to forward RDP packets to this machine and the public IP address of your router would be the \"server URL\".\n", "Q: How do I remove Netflix-Desktop completely The script to install Netflix-Desktop downloaded everything needed except for Firefox.

I'm hoping to be able to remove that entry and disable the menu.\nCheers\n\nA: If you're going with an Ubuntu-only computer, ie ridding yourself of that virus called Windows, ;) then I would boot from a LiveCD/USB and then reformat the HDD and then install Ubuntu.\nIf you're going to dual boot with Windows, then you should still do similar to above, but instead only reformat the ext4 partition, as Ubuntu uses ext4 by default.\n\nA: Can you paste a screenshot. When you install Ubuntu-Wubi, there is no Grub menu, the Ubuntu Wubi makes a listing along with Windows OS in Windows Boot Manager. \nBut when you make a clean install i.e. ext4 partition, Grub loader gets installed.

So I need to find all files which have d, o, and g in the filename. The letters do not need to be side by side (aadaaoaagaa would be a correct filename, aaoaadaag would not be a correct filename). It does not matter if the letters are uppercase or lowercase (aadaaOaag is a correct filename, as is aaDoGa.\nHow would I use filename substitution on the terminal command line to list all of the files like this? Preferably without using loops or anything too advanced. All I have been introduced to so far is filename substitution characters (*,?,[])\n\nA: To list them when you are in the directory where those files are in, you can use, as Nykakin said in this comment the following command:\nls *[dD]*[oO]*[gG]*\n\nor, if you want each file on its own line, you can use:\nprintf '%s\\n' *[dD]*[oO]*[gG]*\n\nor, using grep:\nls | grep [dD].*[oO].*[gG]\n\n\nA: If I understand your problem correctly, you want all those filenames with a d, an o and a g, in any case (upper or lower). Radu Rădeanu gave you an answer that works for the letters occuring in the order d-o-g. For example aaGaaaoaaDaa will not be found. You could alter his solution using the six possible permutations as, e.g.,\nls *[dD]*[oO]*[gG]* *[oO]*[gG]*[dD]* *[gG]*[dD]*[oO]* *[oO]*[dD]*[gG]* *[dD]*[gG]*[oO]* *[gG]*[oO]*[dD]*\n\n(setting shopt -s nullglob before is a good idea).\nThis becomes a bit messy, so you might want to also use shopt -s nocaseglob so that the match is performed without regard to the case of alphabetic characters (quoted from the Bash Reference Manual) as:\n$ shopt -s nullglob nocaseglob\n$ ls *d*o*g* *o*g*d* *g*d*o* *o*d*g* *d*g*o* *g*o*d*\n\nAnother option is to use the find command as, e.g.,\n$ find . -maxdepth 1 -iname '*d*' -iname '*o*' -iname '*g*' -type f\n\nThe -maxdepth 1 option is to limit to the current directory and not its subdirectories and -type f to limit the search to regular files. Change these options to fit your needs. -iname is for a case-insensitive search on the name (using glob patterns). Don't forget the quotes!\nOne advantage of find is that you'll be able to -exec stuff if you need to perform any operation on these files, e.g., renaming them, or appending stuff to them, etc. Another advantage is that if you have a huge number of such files, the globbing will take ages, and might even overflow the maximum number of arguments allowed. find will be alright, whatever the number of files is.\nHope this helps!\nEdit. It seems I missed the in this order part in your title. Hahaha. Well, then the find command would simply be:\n$ find . -maxdepth 1 -iname '*d*o*g*' -type f\n\nand the ls/printf solution would be:\n$ shopt -s nullglob nocaseglob\n$ ls *d*o*g*\n$ printf '%s\\n' *d*o*g*\n\n\nA: I would use Perl for this:\nperl -le 'print for grep {/\\A[a-cefh-np-z]*d[a-fh-z]*o[a-z]*g[a-z.]*\\Z/i} <*>'\n\nExplanation\n\n\n*\n\n*<*> is magical: it returns the result of globbing the pattern * from the current directory.\n\n*grep{} only returns those items of the glob matching the criteria inside it.\n\n*print outputs the result of grep one item per line due to the -l option.\n\n*The single criterion used for grep is that the file name consist exactly of:\n\n\n*\n\n*any number of letters in the set [a-cefh-np-z] (the alphabet minus\no and g)\n\n*the letter d\n\n*any number of letters in the set [a-fh-z] (the alphabet minus g)\n\n*the letter o\n\n*any number of any letter whatsoever\n\n*the letter g.\n\n*any number of letters or a period (for extensions).\n\n\n*The i modifier is applied to the regex criterion to ensure the match is case-insensitive as required in the question.\nI know this isn't exactly what you asked for, but I believe Bash wildcard patterns are too simple to handle this task.\n\nA: Another way to look at the problem would be to keep only filenames for which once eliminated every character outside of D,O or G, the result would be exactly DOG, case insensitive.\nThis could be done in shell with search-replace-test instead of wildcards:\n#!/bin/bash\nshopt -s nocasematch \nshopt -s nullglob\nfor i in *\ndo\n  if [[ ${i//[^dogDOG]/} == dog ]]; then \n    echo $i;\n  fi;\ndone\n\n", "Q: How do I override an MTU provided by DHCP?

Open the terminal and type:\ncd /etc/usb_modeswitch.d\nsudo touch 12d1:1526\nsudo nano 12d1:1526\n\nThis will open the 12d1:1526 file for editing in nano text editor. The instructions for using nano editor are always found at the bottom of every page. The only two nano keyboard shortcuts that you need to know are for WriteOut and Exit. Copy the following text into the nano editor window:\n# Vodafone K3772 (Huawei)\n\nTargetVendor=  0x19d2\n#TargetProduct= not known yet\n\nMessageContent=\"55534243123456780000000000000011062000000100000000000000000000\"\n\nPress the keyboard combination Ctrl+O and after that press Enter to save the 12d1:1526 file. Press the keyboard combination Ctrl+X to exit nano.\n2. Open the /lib/udev/rules.d/40-usb_modeswitch.rules file for editing in nano by running: cd '/lib/udev/rules.d/' && sudo nano 40-usb_modeswitch.rules. You need to add the following two lines to 40-usb_modeswitch.rules putting an empty space before the two lines and another empty space after the two lines:\n# Vodafone (Huawei) K3772\nATTRS{idVendor}==\"12d1\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"1526\", RUN+=\"usb_modeswitch '%b/%k'\"\n\nPress the keyboard combination Ctrl+O and after that press Enter to save the 40-usb_modeswitch.rules file. Press the keyboard combination Ctrl+X to exit nano.\n3. Plug in your modem in and wait at least 10 seconds. After this run the lsusb command in the terminal. There should be a device ID starting with 12d1 but most likely different than 12d1:1526. The changed part of the ID (after the colon) is your new TargetProduct value (prepended by these two characters: 0x ). Edit your /etc/usb_modeswitch.d file (the same file that you edited previously in Step 1) accordingly as root in nano, removing the comment sign (the # character) at the start of the TargetProduct line.\n4. Unplug the modem and plug it in again. Wait ... (Huawei modems need up to 20 seconds for the mode switch.). Run dmesg in the terminal and you should see something like GSM modem (1-port) converter now attached to ttyUSBx. This means that your modem is ready to use.\n", "Q: How to access web gui via dyndns? What I want\nI want to have access to managing my Bittorent sync and Transmission applications from the outside of my home network.\nMy system and network\nI have Xubuntu 13.04 on my laptop connected to router via WiFi.\nWhat I've done\nSine I don't have a static IP, I've registered an account and domain on no-ip, installed their application and followed the manual to configure. Then I turned on web access to btsync and transmission and did port forwarding on my router.\nThe thing is I don't get how can I finally use it. E.g. I access my btsync from the laptop, where it runs via my_laptop_ip:8888/gui. How can I do that from the outside my network? If I try my_noip_domain:8888/gui, nothing happens.\n\nA: You must use NAT or port forwarding on your router.\nYou Transmission server have a private address inside your network.  You web company delivers your a Internet Adress for your house.  Those are of course distinct, internal address do not touch the Internet addresses, except for outgoing traffic, and some exception as peer-to-peer file sharing.\nYou should connect the port 8888 from the outside Internet to your port 8888 of your's server internal IP Address.  That is called port forwarding or NAT.  The way of doing this depends on the web router you have.\nTry tape \"myroutermodel NAT howto\" in a search engine of the Internet.\nHope it is helpfull\n", "Q: Troubles with Nexus 4 Ubuntu touch - Ubuntu 13.10 connection Each time I trying to copy anything to my Nexus 4 U Touch folders I receiving the following error\n\nError while copying “IMG_20130723_220008.jpg”.\nThere was an error copying the file into\n  mtp://[usb:001,004]/Nexus%204/Pictures.\nShow more details\nlibmtp error:  Could not send object info.\n\nAny ideas how to fix this?\n\nA: For some reason for me it works for but only if a turn off the mtp sharing from nexus 4 itself while connected to my computer and then turn it back on again.\nThe first time I connect the nexus Nautilus shows a Nexus 4 device but no internal storage.

I was wondering when a standard user is asked for his password, other than on login or lock screen, I am thinking about disabling it completely.\n\nA: A user is never asked for its password other then on the loginscreen or the lockscreen.\nA user with the correct privileges also gets asked for its credentials when root privileges are required for a certain job. (like update or sudo for a custom command).  \nCredentials are shared in some circumstances to a proxyserver, mailserver or another 'service'. Be sure they allow for a disabled or empty password.  \nIt might be advisable to disable certain things with users like this:\nexample:  No \"Remember password\" in web-browsers; this could be retrieved by anyone with the necessary skillset.\n", "Q: Ubuntu installation botched up, and now it won't install I just received the latest Ubuntu DVD through the post.

Now, when I restart my computer, I can choose between Windows 7 and Ubuntu, but when I click on Ubuntu I get a bunch of error messages that I don't understand. Is there any way that I can start the installation process from the beginning?\n\nA: You can.  When you get to the installation Type screen, just choose One of the three option as seen in the image below.  \nKeep in mind that choosing the Erase Ubuntu 13.04, and reinstall will delete all programs, and data, but since you really didn't finish the installation that shouldn't be an issue.\nI would recommend using either the third option or the first option.\n\n", "Q: Can I still use Ubuntu after support period expired? Can I still use it regardless of the customer support?\nI just want to have Ubuntu for work and music, while my other OS is for gaming and general purposes.\n\nA: The end of support will also mean and end of (security) updates. It is not recommended to run a computer on the internet without keeping it up to date with security updates. Therefore, my answer would be: yes you can use it, but it is not recommended.\nHowever, this should not be a problem. The function for updating the entire system to a new release of Ubuntu is very stable and reliable1, so when the new version comes out or when the support ends you can simply update. Once you hit a LTS (Long Term Support) release, it will have longer support period and thereby decrease the need for updating the system and will typically also have a updating route to the next LTS.\n1 Unless you have heavily modified your system non-standard software and such, but from the sound of your question, that does not seem to be the case.\n\nA: Yes. Although if you really don't want to upgrade every 6 months then the best idea would probably be to upgrade to Ubuntu 13.10 when it comes out, then upgrade to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS when it comes out and then upgrade every 2 years from there.\nYou can still use the OS as long as you want without support, but there will be no more bug fixes, security fixes or support. If you haven't installed Ubuntu yet then I would recommend installing Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS and sticking to the LTS releases every 2 years.\n\nA: Yes, course you can! But what's wrong with upgrading? Whenever you upgrade, Ubuntu will keep your settings, other systems, apps etc. You don't have to download the ISO again, it has a built-in updater. So I don't really see why you need to not upgrade. As @Ads20000 said, you could use LTS releases after you've got 14.04 - they are released every 2 years, but they support security updates for 5 years.\n", "Q: Software which opens PSD files correctly on Ubuntu?

This page: http://blog.pixarea.com/2011/10/opening-photoshop-psd-files-in-ubuntu-11-10-oneiric-ocelot seems to suggest that LibreOffice will do the trick.

You just have to Google to find more games. If you want to install your Need For Speed games on Ubuntu I would install wine and/or play On Linux where you can install windows based games. \nIf you would like racing games written for Ubuntu I would try: \n\n\n*\n\n*Racer, which is a racing simulator.

It's available via the software center, or by terminal, sudo apt-get install supertuxkart \n\n*Musclear Online it's a 2D/3D racing game where you can race your\nfriends via there recorded times.

I know of How to remove an uninstalled package's dependencies? and I tried\napt-get autoremove\n\nbut that does not remove dependencies that are recommended/suggested by other packages.\nThat is, if I install a package X that recommends Y, but I do not install Y, and then I install package Z that depends on Y. and later I do\napt-get remove --auto-remove Z\n\nthen Y is not automatically removed even though nothing depends on it.\n(X \"picked up\" Y, even though it does not depend on it).\n\nA: If you want to remove recommended packages from your system, even if there are still some installed packages recommending (or suggesting) them, put the following in the file /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99_norecommends (create it):\nAPT::Install-Recommends \"false\";\nAPT::AutoRemove::RecommendsImportant \"false\";\nAPT::AutoRemove::SuggestsImportant \"false\";\n\nThe documentation for these options is here.\nThen, the next apt run (try apt-get autoremove) should remove them all. If it doesn't, launch aptitude, and type g and g again.\nThis configuration also disables the automatic installation of recommended packages when using apt-get. For aptitude it can be done from the console GUI, menu Options > Preferences > \"Install recommended packages automatically\" (uncheck it).\n\nA: Actually the command is:\nsudo apt-get autoremove <Z>\n\nBut this has a trick! If any of the dependencies has some other previously installed packages that recommend/suggest them then apt would not remove them.\nYou didn't specified what package was but for example, if I were to install the IcedTea plugin, it would install Java/OpenJRE by dependencies. If I uninstall them using sudo apt-get autoremove icedtea-7-plugin you would notice that it won't remove Java/OpenJRE, since LibreOffice also suggests the packages.\nSo, to remove them you has to be overly specific about the package you wants to uninstall that normal autoremove won't:\nsudo apt-get autoremove <Z> <dependency of Z>\n\nThis way you could be sure your package get removed.\nYou can also use deborphan to remove some dependencies.\n\nA: Overriding APT options\nUnlike dependencies, automatically installed \"recommended\" or \"suggested\" packages may be ignored by apt-get autoremove.\nAs described elsewhere, this behavior of APT can be changed in the configuration.\nLikewise, the configuration of the apt-get command can be temporarily changed through the -o command line option.\nThis is, how you would force autoremove to remove left-over \"recommended\" and \"suggested\" packages, in addition to unused dependencies.\nsudo apt-get autoremove -o APT::Autoremove::RecommendsImportant=0 -o APT::Autoremove::SuggestsImportant=0\n\nCaution!\nSome functionality may be lost. Be prepared to investigate and reinstall things. It may be easier to leave these packages alone.\nOther options\nTo uninstall the 'recommended' and 'suggested' packages solely for a particular package, have a look at the apt history log.\n\nA: Right, if you want to remove package <Z> with dependances just type:\nsudo apt-get autoremove --purge <Z>\n\n", "Q: Booting Windows 8 using Grub Command I am Using Both Ubuntu and Windows 8 on my laptop.\nI want to hide the Windows Menu title from the grub-menu and boot it through the grub command.\n After i get into Grub after pressing C and typing \nchainloader (hd0,gpt5) +1,the promt shows no such file found.\nMy windows is in Gpt5,while ubuntu is in gpt6.\nSome1 tell me how to hide the Windows menu and use grub command to boot It\nThanks\n\nA: I also got a problem like this and solved it using the following commands:\nThis is where 5 has Windows 8:\ngrub>rootnoverify(hd0,5)\ngrub>makeactive\ngrub>chainloader +1\ngrub>boot\n\n", "Q: How to pass url as variable to wget..?

After installing them at tweak tab you can do that. \n\nA: In earlier versions of Nautilus you can make the main toolbar smaller by switching to a location bar viewing but you can't make the icons smaller in bred crumbs view.\nYou can test if you like this view better by pressing Ctrl + L.

I am required to find all lines that start with a capital letter AND ends with the word dog followed by a period.\nI know that to find lines starting with a capital letter I would do:\negrep ^[A-Z] filename\nAnd to find lines that end with \"dog.\" I would do:\negrep dog.$ filename\nHowever how would I do them both together? I have tried:\negrep ^[A-Z]*dog.$ filename\nbut it does not seem to work. In filename substitution the * character represented a string of any length, or no string at all even.\n\nA: You probably need this:\ngrep '^[[:upper:]].*dog\\.$' file\n\nYou probably already know the anchors ^ (for beginning of line) and $ (for end of line). Instead of using [A-Z], you'd better use the class [[:upper:]] as this might better deal with accentuated capital letters (mind you, if your question is for homework, your teacher might not be aware of this — my experience is that command line courses at schools is one of the worst teaching that exists, teachers are usually incompetent at this as they use ancient techniques... (bad) habits die hard!).\nThen you're looking for .* where the period . matches any character and then .* means any number of any character.\nFinally, you need an escaped period \\. otherwise a line ending with dogs or dog! would match... since an unnescaped period matches any character.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: You need to write the following pattern:\n[A-Z].*dog.\n[A-Z] expects a capital letter\ndot means that it is any character. The way you have the '*' means that as many capital letters. If you want alphabet characters then instead of '.' put [a-z]. The star doesn't work as as a wildcard like in bash command line, but it rather takes into account the previous character.\nI hope this was helpful\n", "Q: How do I install qps from repositories on ubuntu 13?

In order to find the repository that contains qps, visit the Ubuntu Packages Search website and search for qps for Any Distribution.

I would like to know if i update ubuntu from the manager will i lose the windows boot ? how could i do just to update it without touching the windows OS neither the grub. \nThank you very much for your help ^^\n\nA: If you update Ubuntu from the update manager, all your grub settings should stay put.  It has worked for me numerous times with no problem.  \nYou will notice that to upgrade from 12.04 to 13.04 actually requires two upgrades upon the documentations: first from 12.04 to 12.10, then from 12.10 to 13.04.\n\nTo avoid damaging your running system, upgrading should only be done from one release to the next release (e.g. Ubuntu 12.04 to Ubuntu 12.10) or from one LTS release to the next (e.g. Ubuntu 10.04 LTS to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS).\n\n\nA: Your system currently running is changing the grub.cfg already whenever there is a kernel update and installing grub again won't break anything with the windows dualboot. This means if you didn't change grub manually, in which case you wouldn't ask this question, you can safely install any new Ubuntu you like without breaking anything (except for maybe a newer ubuntu version being broken by itself).\nI really advise you to not do upgrades but do a fresh install as this really helps minimising possible problems. I myself had a really broken and unstable system after upgrading from 12.10 to 13.04. I can't imagine how much worse it may be if you upgrade from 12.04 to 12.10 to 13.04.\nIf you want to wait for it, the next LTS release will be in april 2014.\n", "Q: Where did my Windows go?

The construct \\( regexp1 \\| regexp2 \\) will match all lines that match either regexp1 or regexp2. The regexp [',] matches all lines that contain either a quote ' or a coma ,.\nHere you need to escape the parentheses () and the pipe | otherwise grep tries to find these characters, and don't consider them as regexp constructs. If you don't like escaping these, you can use the -E switch (for Extended regexps) or egrep directly as:\ngrep -cE \"([',]|^$)\" filename\n\nor\negrep -c \"([',]|^$)\" filename\n\nIn your OP you mention the -x switch.

However the Long Term Support version of Ubuntu, Ubuntu 12.04, does support Wubi. Ubuntu 12.04 is supported by updates until April, 2017.\nFor more information about installing Ubuntu from within Windows using Wubi visit the Ubuntu Wubi Installation Instructions. This is an illustrated seven-step tutorial about how to install Ubuntu with the Wubi Windows installer.\nBefore you install Ubuntu you should think about what type of installation, whether it is using Wubi or else a dual boot installation of Ubuntu alongside Windows 7, would be most suitable for you. This will help you to focus on learning more about what type of installation you have decided upon before you commit yourself to doing the installation.\nIn particular, for more information about solving the black screen problem that you got when trying to install Ubuntu from the DVD, take a look at the answers to this question.\n", "Q: diffrence between the DNS setting in etc/resolv conf and etc/network/interfaces I want to know the difference between DNS settings in /etc/resolv.conf and /etc/network interfaces. For example when I share internet connection from other computer(XP), I used to add  the name server (DNS address of my ISP)  in /etc/resolv.conf and I could successfully share the internet. But I want to know what is the relevance of setting the DNS address in the /etc/network/interfaces along with IP and gateway address?\nWhere does my computer look up for resolving IP address of some website when browsing? Is it resolv.conf or network interfaces?\n\nA: Newer Ubuntu systems use a service called resolvconf that runs a local DNS resolver on the machine, and automatically manages the /etc/resolv.conf file (in fact, as a symlink to somewhere in the /run filesystem) and you should not edit the /etc/resolv.conf file by hand.\nIn the server version, resolvconf takes the actual server addresses either via DHCP or from /etc/network/interfaces file where they are specified as a list of dns-nameservers e.g.\n\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\naddress 192.168.1.102\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\nnetwork 192.168.1.0\nbroadcast 192.168.1.255\ngateway 192.168.1.1\ndns-nameservers 192.168.1.1 8.8.4.4\n\nFor the desktop versions (i.e. those using the network-manager service and associated GUI applet) the actual servers come either via DHCP or may be specified in the IPv4 Settings tab after changing the Method: from Automatic (DHCP) to either Automatic (DHCP) addresses only or Manual and adding the required IP addresses in the boxes provided. \n", "Q: Can't view Ubuntu like it should appear New to Linux and boy am I seeing that fact.  I'm wanting to try to have it set up so I can turn the computer and it starts up immediately with Ubunutu, from a flash drive.  I wasn't having any kind of luck doing that so I stumbled into the idea of worse case scenario...use VMware Player.  I tried starting a new machine and it seemed like it was going to work.  Everything loaded in and I came up to the main screen.  One problem there was no icons.  Just the blank start up screen.  I tried scrolling the cursor around the screen toward the area where the icons should appear and black boxes popped up as I was scrolling down the screen.  I decided to click on the boxes and see what would happen.  Sure enough there were icons under those black boxes and I could open up LibreOffice, Firefox, system settings, etc.  I didn't know what I was opening, until after I clicked on it, but I could open it.  I looked here on askubuntu and saw it mentioned that it might be a hardware issue and to switch to Unity2D.  I tried and that failed.  In further reading in Getting Started with Ubunutu 12.10, there is no Unity2D option anymore.  Yes, I have 12.10 installed.\nThe main screen when it appears isn't full size, it's about 3/4 of the screen.  As I scroll down the 'icons' sometimes the screen flashes other times I lose the wallpaper on Ubunutu altogether.\nFirst impressions are lasting impressions and currently my first impressions of Linux are good ones to say the least...but I'm still willing to progress forward.\nHow do I get to a normal operating interface?\n\nA: I would suggest installing Ubuntu from inside windows using a virtual dvd. Use Daemon Tools Lite or some other virtul disk software to mount the iso you downloaded to a virtual disk, then simply double click it in Computer (it might also run automatically) and just follow the installation instructions. You need to have a separate partition. If you don't have one, google how to shrink your windows partiton using disk management in Windows.\nI've had the same problems you're having with VMWare, and if you want the full Ubuntu experience without said problems, you should just install it like a regular OS as I mentioned above.\n", "Q: rmdir on my machine doesn't have the -r argument I checked the man page for it using man rmdir and all it has is --ignore-fail-on-non-empty, -p, -v, --help, and --version. What am I missing?\nI'm using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS\n\nA: rmdir has no -r option. The purpose of rmdir is to delete only empty directories.\nIf you want to delete non-empty directories, that's when you'll use the -r option of the command rm.\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete empty directory called emptydir:\n$ rmdir emptydir\n\n\n*If directory nonemptydir is non-empty, you'll have an error:\n$ rmdir nonemptydir\nrmdir: failed to remove `nonemptydir': Directory not empty\n\n\n*To delete non-empty directory nonemptydir:\n$ rm -r nonemptydir\n\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Suddenly Spotify doesn't work anymore I've been using Spotify for 18 months without a problem. I use Ubuntu 12.04.\nToday Spotify stopped and doesn't start anymore. I only see a quick flash of the Spotify-startup-screen and thatś it.\n\n\n*\n\n*I uninstalled using Synaptic and reinstalled using Synaptic.

No solution.\n\n\nI see no error message and I ran out of options I know of.\n\nA: Are you behind a proxy? I had the same case as you, and I had to change in Spotify:Preferences>Proxy the \"autodetect\" to \"HTTPS\" \n", "Q: changing boot priority to external disk I just installed xubuntu. I dual booted it, my main os is windows 7. I installed ubuntu onto a external hdd and is my second boot priority so since i use it the most, it is a hassle to change every time i log onto my computer. \nMy question is this: If i go an change the boot priority to automatically boot to ubuntu, will this have any affect on my windows 7, which is installed on the hard drive. It would be ideal to be able to boot directly into ubuntu, but i dont want to risk ruining my windows to do so.  I know how to change the boot priority, I needed to do that for the dual boot, but I want to make sure setting it up like this wont hurt anything. \nThank you for you responses. \n\nA: It will have no affect on your Windows hard drive. It does not change anything on the hard drives itself but just where the motherboard should look for a OS to load.\n", "Q: Cloud vs Local Sync Will there be an option to sync my ubuntu phone and a desktop via usb or local wifi and not the cloud?\n\nA: Crashplan is what you need. They have mobile apps for Android and iOS. You can create your backup on a local drive, a spare computer, or on the CrashPlan servere. The first 2 are free, the 3rd is an affordable $10/month.\n", "Q: AMD Radeon HD6450 compatibility 13.04 My old graphics card hase just died. So I ordered a new MSI Radeon HD6450. What is the best way to install the AMD drivers?\nThank you.\nRegards,\nRichard\n\nA: I had the same issues but I finally found a way to use AMD drivers while keeping the Unity launcher working.\nFirst in the terminal update your kernel with\n   sudo apt-get install linux-headers-3.8.0-30-generic\n\nNext go to the AMD website (this link) and download the 13.8 Beta drivers\nDownload the drivers and place the drive file (.run file) on the desktop\nIn the terminal run the following:\ncd /home/yourname/Desktop (Replace yourname w/ your Ubuntu login username)\nFollowed by\nsudo sh the-run-file-name\n\nThe AMD driver/catalyst installer should open, follow the step by step and restart!\nYour unity bar should work while you have the latest drivers! WOo!\nAlso - to remove the watermark (For AMD testing only) simply open the terminal and run\nsudo gedit /etc/ati/signature\n\nThen replace \"Unsigned\" with 9777c589791007f4aeef06c922ad54a2:ae59f5b9572136d99fdd36f0109d358fa643f2bd4a2644d9efbb4fe91a9f6590a145:f612f0b01f2565cd9bd834f8119b309bae11a1ed4a2661c49fdf3fad11986cc4f641f1ba1f2265909a8e34ff1699309bf211a7eb4d7662cd9f8e3faf14986d92f646f1bc\nSource: How can I get the AMD driver running on Ubuntu 12.10 (AMD Radeon HD 7310& AMD Vision E1-1200 APU) (I've edited it as per your needs)\n\nA: Here is how my VGA card works on Linux!\nYou may install the proprietary ATI graphics driver using this command:\n\nsudo apt-get install fglrx-updates fglrx-amdcccle\n\n\nThere is no doubt about your VGA's functionality under Ubuntu.\n", "Q: 12.04 boots to command line I'm running 12.04 LTS, and as usual when the package manager prompts me to update I do it. I updated last night (Sept. 27) and now the system boots only into command line mode. \nBefore doing so I see the purple screen with the words \"ubuntu 12.04\" and the little dots going bright and dark, and then bam I'm in command line. I've tried using sudo apt-get to update my files, in case it was incomplete, and it tells me that everything is up to date. If I type the command \"unity\" I get a \"fatal error\" related to \"no display variable set\". \nI have seen other questions and answers on this topic but I do not understand the answers provided. I am stuck. All I did was upgrade when the system told me to, what did I do wrong? I did not download any new video drivers lately. \n\nA: Thanks everyone. Using Ctrl-Alt-F1 to get to a TTY, I was able to run various apt-get commands to purge and reinstall my drivers completely, as seen in similar questions here on the site. My login credentials were broken as well so deleting my .Xauthority file allowed it to refresh and I'm OK now. \n", "Q: why can't I create a new gnome terminal profile or edit one? When I create a new gnome profile, it isn't saved when I hit close. When I create a new gnome profile, I can't edit the preferences to change things like the colour, font, etc., either. I also can't change the default ones in the same way. All the options are greyed out. Would anyone know why this would be?\n\nA: The most probable reason is that you lost permissions of your own files. This could be easily solved with chmod/chown:\nsudo chown -R $USER ~/.gconf/apps/\nsudo chown -R $USER ~/.config/dconf\nchmod -R u+w ~/.gconf/apps/\nchmod -R u+w ~/.config/dconf\n\n\nA: The latest (at the moment of writing this answer) gnome-terminal settings storage is dconf. The terminal requires gsettings-backend-dconf package. However, sometimes (maybe on other distributions) the terminal installs without this dependency. When it happens, gnome-terminal works and opens but it does not retain any new profiles and changes in the existing profile. \nBelow are the steps that resolved this problem for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install dconf-gsettings-backend package\nsudo apt install dconf-gsettings-backend\n\nAfter this step I could see that ~/.config/dconf/user file was created.\n\n*Reboot\n\n*Try to edit or add a new profile\n", "Q: Which music programmes should I consider installing on Ubuntu? I would like to use a music programme on Ubuntu that meets the following requirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*the ability to batch rename, convert and meta tag music files,\n\n*the ability to scrobble plays in the music programme to Last.fm, and\n\n*the ability to sync with 6th generation iPod nano and to scrobble iPod plays to Last.fm.\n\n\nOn Windows I would satisfy requirement 1 with Foobar2000, which enabled me to run batch rename processes with preset naming formats as well as to convert batches of music files with finely tuned settings such as output file format, bit rate, output location, naming convention, etc.\nI would sync my iPod and scrobble my iPod plays to Last.fm using iTunes (and both players supported in-player scrobbling to Last.fm).\nIs there a single music programme in Ubuntu that can do all this? If not, what is a viable combination of music players that would satisfy the above-mentioned needs?\nNote: I am using Ubuntu 12.04\n\nA: Nice programs for converting are soundconverter and winff. For managing your Music with iPod sync and Last.fm scrobble support there is banshee but I don't know how good the iPod sync works and if it can scrobble what you have played on your iPod.\nOther music players to take a look at are rhythmbox, guayadeque and amarok. I don't really like amarok, because im to stupid to use it right, but I know many people that really like it.\n"]
