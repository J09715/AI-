["Q: How can I transfer a Large (450Mb) file between two Mountain Lion Macbook Pros? I have two identical Macbook Pro Retina laptops.  How can I transfer files between them?\nI have looked at the AirPort utility, but don't see a way to \"create a new network\" let alone make it discoverable by the other mac.\nI tried enabling File Sharing, but I don't know how to tell the other mac to connect to that share (they are both on the same Wifi, where should I look for it?)\nAlso I tried the Bluetooth file transfer wizard but don't see the other device.\nI've also tried AirDrop, but I can only send small files this way.  I have a folder with many files that adds up to 450Mb and that just times out.\nWhat other ways should I try connecting the hosts together?\n\nA: After enabling File Sharing on one machine, it will give you the name of the machine as used to connect to it. Next, go to the other computer, and open Finder.  You should see the name of the other computer in the sidebar.  If you don't, then press Go -> Connect to Server, and connect to the other machine by the name that was given in the Sharing window.\nWhen you connect, you should see the public folder of your user account, and the Drop Box folder in there.  Copy the file to the Drop Box folder by dragging it onto the Drop Box folder.  On the target computer, open Finder, your user folder, the \"Public\" folder, and the \"Drop Box\" folder, and you will see the file that you copied.\n\nA: Here are two more options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a thunderbolt cable to transfer the data between the Macs.  To do this, reboot the source Mac while pressing the \"T\" key.  This will allow the destination Mac to access the hard drive directly.\n\n*Depending on what is being migrated, the Migration Assistant may also be of use if transferring all the applications, one or more user directories, etc. to the other Mac.  This works over Wifi/Ethernet, and over Thunderbolt\n\nA: If you have quite a few of these large files, the fastest way is definitely using a thunderbolt cable and transferring files in target disk mode. There's full instructions here, you'll also need a thunderbolt cable, you can probably get one from your local computer store for 20 or 30 dollars, or Apple sells a 2m one for $49.\n\nA: As mentioned by a few others, using a Thunderbolt cable works great. Here's details on how to do this without having to reboot the source computer (as described by this article):\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect the two computers via thunderbolt cable\n\n*Make sure File Sharing enabled on source computer (Setting -> Sharing -> check File Sharing)\n\n*On source computer, go to Network Settings, highlight Thunderbolt Bridge, and note the IP address (e.g., \"169.254.XXX.XXX\").\n\n*On destination computer, open Finder, use the Go menu's \"Connect to Server\" option (or type Cmd-K when Finder is focused). \n\n*Type the source computer's IP address into the server's location in this window\n\n*You will be prompted to login; use user that has appropriate permission to access files you want (you may need to add files via File Sharing settings on source computer).\n\n", "Q: iOS 6 kills battery life I live in the Boston area (zip code 02421). Since upgrading to iOS 6, both my iPhone 5 and iPhone 4S are getting really hot and last only 4 hours maximum, even in standby.\nAlso, AT&T notified me of having already reached 65% of my 4GB shared plan quota, only 1 week into he billing cycle. For years, I have barely hit 2GB after the full month. \nTypically the devices become really hot and the battery goes from 100% to 0% in less than 5 hours of standby time.  \nIn both devices I found crash logs from Siri for every day in the past 2 weeks. Which is since the problem manifested itself and since I upgraded my 4S to iOS 6 and received my iPhone 5.\nIs there any evidence that Apple is aware of these horrible issues? Are they going to be fixed in the next iOS update? \n\nA: Most likely an app that is running in the background. Try disabling Notifications for all apps then selectively adding them back. Also you could try the Genius Bar at an Apple Store. They have diagnostic programs that they can run to tell what programs are running in the background.\n\nA: I believe there have been similar questions posted on here but I wasn't able to find any. What is really weird is that it is happening on both of your phones.\nI think your best bet will be a factory refresh. First, however, I would recommend rebooting your phone(s) (holding the home and power buttons down together) if you haven't done that already.\nAfter that, make a full backup of your phone(s), and then wipe them (Settings > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings). If you backup to iCloud, restoring is an very easy and simple thing to do. If you backup to iTunes, it's not quite as easy but still easy. I've heard of similar situations to yours, but it is not normal behavior, and likely will be fixed by restores.\n\nA: For the data related issue, make sure in your iCloud settings that you turn-off everything you don't need. On my iPhone 4, \"Documents & Data\" have been consuming all of my data. After turning it off I have gone back to regular data usage. Also, in the \"Usage\" section of Settings make sure you reset it after reaching the end of your cycle to track actual Wi-Fi and 3G/LTE usage. There were rumors of Apple messing up and reporting Wi-Fi usage as cellular with iOS6.\nThe iPhone 5 battery drain sounds like a serious issue and if you do not have any suspicious applications running in the background (download an application to check CPU and RAM usage and check; I have an app for this called Monitor but I am not sure if it's still in the App Store anymore) your best bet is to take it to an Apple Store. Many friends needed to return their iPhone 5's for an exchange with the same problem.\n", "Q: Booting Windows 7 in Boot Camp shows a black screen with a blinking cursor I am trying to restore a DMG image of a Windows 7 Boot Camp partition back to Boot Camp. (I know that I should have used Winclone, but I didn't have that option because the drive was already dying and so I couldn't even access OS X anymore.)\nSo far, I've gotten to the point where I can start up the computer, hold Option, choose Windows, but then when it boots up, it shows a black screen with a blinking cursor.\nI've tried a few things so far to try and fix this, none of which has worked. I have used the Windows 7 install DVD to run bootrec and all its possible arguments. I've ran chkdsk C: /b. I've also used the \"Automatically fix startup problems\" button, of course, as well.\nAnyone know what else I could try to fix this?\n\nA: Since it is an Image-File frome a previous (working) Bootcamp Installation it should not be necessary, but there is an upgrade for the graphics and bluetooth driver from Apple with an installation instruction found here \"Boot Camp: iMac displays a black screen during installation of Windows 7\" which adresses this problem.\n", "Q: Where is system.log located? (In the filesystem, outside of Console.app) Where is the system.log file actually located? I know of course that I can view its contents in Console.app, but I just want to know where this text file is actually located. Or is it an almagamation of multiple files merged together or something, so that's why there's no actual location for it?\n\nA: Right click it in Console.app - Reveal in Finder :)\nFor completeness, it's located in /private/var/log.\n", "Q: How to use Finder to find all files that do not match a certain criteria? How can I use Finder's search feature to find all files that do not match a certain criteria?\nFor instance, all files that don't end in \".txt\" in the current folder.\n\nA: Just typing the operand NOT before the criteria will do the trick.\nSo, in this case, typing NOT .txt will show all the files but the ones with the .txt extension.\n\nA: Exclude search results by using the '-' symbol\nlike this: Name -GMT\nWill display filenames that don't include '-GMT'\n", "Q: You have updates available on another account I received this Mac as a gift. Everything worked fine, now in the App Store the default applications GarageBand, iMovie and iPhoto refuse to update, since it asks for the Apple ID of the previous owner.\nSo this is not like a bug other people perceive, who ever had only one AppleID its really changed ownership. When we did that, I also created a Account for me with Admin escalation, and deleted the account of the previous owner to safe any personal data.\nSo now how can I update these default apps that came bundled with the device? Can I deinstall'em and reinstall with my AppleID?\nIts not like I want any Apps that the previous owner bought (all deinstalled and installed my ones), only those that are tied to the device.\n\nA: I had a similar issue when I first got my Mac.  The first thing you want to try is going to the \"Purchased\" tab in the App Store and seeing if it gives you the option to \"accept\" the iLife apps at the top of that page.  If not, then you should contact the App Store support team using this website: http://www.apple.com/support/mac/app-store/contact/ .  They will most likely email you back asking for your serial number to confirm that you are eligible for the apps.  For me, they validated my serial, verified that I was eligible for the apps, and issued me redemption codes for all of the iLife apps.  After that, no problems.  If they issue you codes, make sure you uninstall the three iLife apps through Launchpad before using the codes and redownloading them.\n\nA: Although these apps came bundled with the Mac, they are premium applications. You can try visiting an Apple store, or speaking with Apple support, to see if you are entitled to the applications complimentarily, as they did ship with your Mac. Your alternative is to delete them, and purchase iLife from the Mac App Store using your Apple ID. \n", "Q: Missing glibtoolize One package I want to install (lua-posix) needs glibtoolize, where do I get that? I installed XCode and that Development Console Tools stuff, brew doctor is happy, and according to the them, glibtoolize should somewhere come from Apple.\nWhat do I need to install?\n\nA: I had the same problem, and i installed libtool via brew \nbrew install libtool\n\n", "Q: How can I assign custom colors to groups in a dispersion chart in Numbers? I have a table with measurements of the runtime of different sorting algorithms. This data should be shown in a chart, with the number of items on the X axis and the runtime on the Y axis. To make the X axis on scale, I used a dispersion chart.\nNumbers automatically picks some colors for the different groups of data. However, I'd like to choose different colors. I was only able to change the color of the trend line, but this didn't change the color in the legend.\nHow can I change the color so that the change is visible in the legend as well?\n\n\nA: Just called AppleCare. The guy took some time to make a chart and afterwards explained that I could click the line to change the color (just as I did before). While we were talking I clicked a dot in the graph, representing a data point. It turned out that you could change the color of the dots the same way. This color was applied to the legend, so the problem was solved.\n\n", "Q: How to render only first page in PDF as image and then resize? I've really stuck on how to do this, I thought it would be easy, but maybe not!\nI want to create a small thumbnail image from the first page of a pdf in automator so I can batch convert a load of them at once. Is that possible? If so, what actions do I need to set up?\n\nA: The following Automator workflow creates thumbnails for every page:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get Specified Finder Items\n\n*Render PDF Pages as Images\n\n*Scale Images\n\n*Move Finder Items\nWith the thumbnails created, you can then delete all but the first page images. You may be able to automate this step as well; consider adding a Filter Finder Items Action before the Move Finder Items.\n\n\nA: Since there is no way to extract a single page from a PDF in Automator, you can try with this Python script. It will extract the first page of each passed pdf in a temporary pdf file:\n#! /usr/bin/python\n#\nimport sys\nimport os\nimport tempfile\nfrom Quartz.CoreGraphics import *\nfrom os.path import splitext\nfrom os.path import basename\nfrom os.path import join\n\n\ndef createPDFDocumentWithPath(path):\n    return CGPDFDocumentCreateWithURL(CFURLCreateFromFileSystemRepresentation(kCFAllocatorDefault, path, len(path), False))\n\ndef main(argv):\n\n    for input_pdf_filename in argv:\n        doc = createPDFDocumentWithPath(input_pdf_filename)\n        page_one = CGPDFDocumentGetPage(doc, 1)\n        mediaBox = CGPDFPageGetBoxRect(page_one, kCGPDFMediaBox)\n        if CGRectIsEmpty(mediaBox):\n            mediaBox = None\n\n        file_name, extension = splitext(basename(input_pdf_filename))\n        output_path = join(tempfile.gettempdir(), file_name + \"_page1\" + extension)\n        writeContext = CGPDFContextCreateWithURL(CFURLCreateFromFileSystemRepresentation(kCFAllocatorDefault, output_path, len(output_path), False), None, None)\n        CGContextBeginPage(writeContext, mediaBox)\n        CGContextDrawPDFPage(writeContext, page_one)\n        CGContextEndPage(writeContext)\n        CGPDFContextClose(writeContext)\n        del writeContext\n\n        print output_path\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main(sys.argv[1:])\n\nYou can put it as a Run Shell Script step in an Automator workflow, similar to what @Graham Miln suggested:\n\nBe sure to set Pass Input to as arguments, not to to stdin in the Run Shell Script step.\n", "Q: Does mac os x have any command tool like pidstat in linux? It can tell me the current status of a process, for example, whether it is still running or has been terminated.\n\nA: I'm not sure there is a list of terminated processes, but for a list of processes and their current state you can use the \"top\" command. It's fairly user-friendly for a Unix tool.\nThere is also the \"Activity Monitor\" (in the /Applications/Utilities folder) that is basically top with a GUI.\n", "Q: Automatically executing actions according to the current location I would like to have in my MacBook Pro a functionality which execute automatically some actions according to my current location. This actions could be for example\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the default printer\n\n*Change the network location (for setting for example static or dynamic IP like in this question)\n\n*Open an application or a specific file\n\n*Activate/Deactive file sharing\n\n*Run shell scripts\n\n\nThe current location could be inferred for example by using the current network (Wi-Fi network name) or other localization services.\nIs there an application that provides this functionality?\n\nA: You probably want Control Plane:\n\nControlPlane allows you to build configuration profiles, contexts in ControlPlane lingo, for your Mac based on where you are or what you are doing.  ControlPlane determines where you are or what you are doing based on a number of available evidence sources and then automatically reconfigures your Mac based on your preferences.  Evidence sources can include your current location, visible WiFi networks, attached USB devices, running applications and more.  You can even write your own evidence sources using shell scripts!\n\n", "Q: Rebooting a headless Mac Mini I have an old Mac Mini on which I installed Ubuntu to be used as a test server.\nI completely formatted the hard disk before installing ubuntu, installation went fine and everything is working; so far so good.\nThe problem is that when I access the machine via ssh, and do a reboot, it doesn't reboot.\nI get the message \"going to reboot NOW\" then I get a black screen as if its rebooting but then nothing happens. The machine is still running, but it is as if no restart signal has been sent to the bios.\nAny ideas?\nEdit1\nSo I found the problem. The machine simply won't start without a monitor attached to it. A keyboard is not necessary, but a monitor is a must.\nI tried looking around how to access the bios in mac-mini and it looks like mac has no bios but instead has Apple Open Firmware, which can be accessed by pressing Cmd + O + A. I have a standard Windows keyboard so I tried pressing windows logo key + o + a but it doesn´t seem to work\nSo now I'm trying to find out how to start a Mac Mini without a monitor attached to it.\n**Edit 2: SOLUTION **\nAnswering my own forgotten question a couple of years later, but here goes\nYou need to convince mac that it is attached to a monitor, this can be achieved by using a resistor on two holes in the VGA port, like  220Ω resistor. VGA voltage levels are 0.7V\nCheck out this solution\nIf by the time of reading this solution the attached link is down, then google for this \"headless VGA headless vga mac\"\nIf by the time of reading this solution there is no google anymore, then I'm dead anyway and I don't care\n\nA: Older Mac Minis don't like running headless (without a monitor)\nHere's one solution involving some cunning use of a display adaptor and a 100 Ohm resistor.\n\nA: You don't need a DVI to VGA adapter. Just plug the resistor between C2 and C5 holes on the DVI. (Any of C1, C2 or C3 should work, but I tried C2 and C5 first and it worked for me so I stopped right there.)\n\nThe resistor should be about 80 Ohm, but the closest I had was 150 Ohm resistors and that worked fine. 200 or even higher probably works too.\n\nA: I was able to fix headless boot on Mac Mini 2,1 (mid-2007) by putting 80 Ohms directly between DVI port pins C2 and 15 (GND). Also tested the DVI port signal and it seems no harm was done ;)\nSqueezing the resistor leg to pin C5 did not make a reliable electrical connection in my case.\nMy headless boot problem strangely started after switching from OS X to Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Upgrade from Snow Leopard to Mountain Lion in non personal & large scaled development environment My company is still running Snow Leopard and we're thinking of upgrading to Mountain Lion soon. We are developing iOs and MacOsX applications and have a small break between the old projects and the new projects. What this means is, that we can start over with the new applications on the new version. But what happens to the old versions? They don't have ARC, Storyboards etc... I know you can switch off ARC but we want to make sure that we will still be able to commit updates to our old projects and we can't efford to put lots of time and effort in the conversion process.\nI spent some time reading the user comments below the xCode update on the AppStore and read that the new Version deleted old projects. Of course we have a backup but this makes me uncertain if it's the right step.\nDoes anybody have experience how this works in a non personal environment? At home I'm running Mountain Lion and xCode converted small projects by itself. I'm just not sure about large scale projects...\n\nA: Tipps what to consider when doing an upgrade:\n\nBefore you start\n\n\n*\n\n*Take your time for a good backup! - You can regard data which is only\nlocated on one harddrive as non existend.\n\n*Start with one system first and try out everything before doing the\nmajor upgrade.\n\nInstallation\n\n\n*\n\n*Consider it takes way more time than it does at home! The\nMountainLion Download took >5 hours because of a symmetrical internet\nconnection. Installation time was ~1 hour (MacMini 2009 - 4Gigs Ram\n1067). + xCode Downloadtime ~1hour\n\n*Before you install the new xCode make sure all your projects and your old xCode Dev Folder are\nbackupped.\n\n*When the installation routine asks you to delete your old xCode do so\n(I didn't do it and now I have to manually assign each project to the\nnew xCode. I've to delete the old version manually too and it's a bit\nmore complicated if you have to do the research which files you are\nallowed to delete and which not)\n\n*Then you have to download the different xCode\nlibraries. There goes at least 1 additional hour.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Time of the downloading- and installation process so far: ~8 hours. (Keep in mind we've a slow internet connection)\n\nProjects\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy your projects and don't run your conversion and tests on the\noriginal.\n\n*When you open the project you'll probably receive lots of warnings.\nDon't Panic!\n\n*When clicking on the \"Validate Project Settings\" warning xCode will suggest to convert your\nproject for you. I've done this for 3 iOs applications (Build Target:\n4.3) now and it worked every single time. Let it create a snapshot for you. Just in case.\n\n*If your app has already been code signed you'll probably receive the\n\"Target Integrity\" warning. In every single case it worked for me to\nedit the path for the \"entitlement.plist\". (Just click the warning\nand edit the path at \"Code Signing Entitlements\")\n\n\n*It may happen that you've to change the deployment-target. To do so\ngo to the Project Navigator (cmd + 1), click on your\nproject's name and then Summary.

When joining a domain one of the AD I can set following options:\n\nIf mobile account is selected, where does my account get stored? Also, does a mobile account have special properties that a normal local account doesn't have?\n\nA: Mobile Account home directory trees are stored locally (normally under /Users) but are synced with a home directory tree on the server.\nOther than local files for the user home (which is good if you are using programs that depend on local disk for performance or other reasons), I can't remember any special properties other than the fact that you have two copies of the user's files (which doesn't really count as a backup). Both types of accounts can be managed.\n", "Q: PDF software to read many documents side-by-side in iPad? This thread is a part of the major thread about using iPad for education purposes here.\nWhen I do my homework, I often need to recap lecture notes and at the same time do assignments. Before my printer broke, I printed everything -- now with my iPad, I use only the screen. The problem is that I have only one iPad and so I am looking for a software using which I could read many PDFs at the same time. Does such a PDF reader exist?\nI have used PDF Expert but it lacks this feature. I have also tried apps such as iAnnotate but cannot find this feature.\n\nA: Side by Side allows you to read up to 4 different PDFs side by side on an iPad.\n\nA: Try Easy Annotate, it allows showing and annotating two PDFs next to each other.\nAccording to the website\" \"The only app that can annotate PDFs side-by-side\"\nThey have a dropbox option which I use myself.\n\nA: iRead PDF.\nAlternatively you can just email them to yourself and open them up in Safari or whatever web browser you use. I'm not aware of any way to have view of multiple PDFs at once but you can only read one thing at a time anyway so I think most people think tabs is sufficient. \n\nA: Try Foxt PDF. It can open 5 documents in 5 tabs at a time. However it seems the resolution is slightly poorer than Adobe Acrobat. If it's a matter of settings then I haven't gotten the trick. That's why I still use Adobe for single document viewing. I hope that helps.\n\nA: I was also looking for the same thing .what i used to do is open in two apps and read ..rather difficult .

The earphones that I have received with my iPhone have 4 metal connector jack. By the size of it, it looks 3.5 mm in diameter. Unfortunately, the white earphones are not of the in-ear type and slip out from my ears quite frequently.\nI have a different set of Sony earphones with a 3.5 mm jack. It has 3 metal connectors which means that if I insert it in the iPhone, at least I am shorting out 2 metals receptors on the iPhone female. Is it fine to do such a thing? My guess is that if the short is occurring between the mic and the ground, it should be fine as usually not a lot of current is sourced to a mic. I was just looking around for more information. A connection diagram would be great.\n\nA: Yes, you can use any earphones with a 3.5mm audio jack. I'm surprised you did not just try it out :)\nI thought I'd add some additional background information I just read about in a report on yet another Apple-Samsung patent case, Apple holds a patent on an audio jack which has the circuitry to detect the type of headphones plugged in, and I can only assume this is what they actually use in their iPhones.\n\nA: Some earphones are not supported by iphone...\nI've try some earphones but the bass of the music didn't exist.. So i prefer to use apple earphones ^^\n\nA: Yeah. All the headphones that you have are 3.5mm but if you can look closely, the white one has 3 black strips a.k.a. the 4-conductor TRRS while the Sony one has 2 black strips a.k.a. the 3-conductor TRRS. So, the iPhone only supports those headphones with the 4-conductor, for example, the Beats headphones.\nReference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)\n", "Q: Add different iCloud email to existing AppleID Lets say an AppleID is created with the iCloud email address somebdy@icloud.com (misspelled).\nIs there any way to correct the iCloud email to somebody@icloud.com? Creating a new AppleID would lose old purchases and is not an option.\nIs iCloud permanently linked to an AppleID? Is there a way to change the @icloud.com address?\nAccording to this Apple support article, renaming the iCloud/AppleID prefix is possible as long as it is not an @mac.com or @me.com (quoted from link).\nHowever, when I follow the instructions, I only see an option to add a new primary email, I don't see the same screen as in the last illustration in that article. \nApple's screenshot:\n\nMy screenshot:\n\n\nA: Even though the Apple support article referred to doesn't specificaly say this (I'm assuming it's because @icloud.com was only introduced recently and the article was never updated), what goes for @me.com and @mac.com goes for @icloud.com (they're all aliases for the same address).\nie, read: Some Apple IDs, like those ending in @mac.com, @me.com or @icloud.com, can't be changed.\nSo no, unfortunately you won't be able to change.\niCloud: About your icloud.com, me.com, and mac.com email addresses\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT5441\n\nA: http://support.apple.com/kb/PH2622 you could try making an alias. \nYou could also change the email associated with the account. I don't actually use my me account for anything.\nI don't think you can make a new iCloud account and link that without a new device. I'm not really sure about how to get a new iCloud account really. I do know that you can't change your iCloud email address; it's stuck as whatever you made it as originally. \n\nA: While your Apple ID is in the form of an email address, that email address does not need to be used for anything associated with the Apple ID. Your primary email address, for contact with Apple, does NOT need to be the same as your Apple ID, it can be anything.\nIn otherwords, you can have an Apple ID that is somebody@icloud.com but use the primary email address of somebody@gmail.com.\nIn fact, my Apple ID is actually an old email address I no longer use, but nothing associated with the Apple ID ever gets sent to this old email address (which would not work anyway). Instead, I changed by primary email to my current email address, which has no impact on the Apple ID.\n\nA: You can create a new iCloud account easily on a mac by creating a new user.\n", "Q: How do I see version numbers of my apps on iOS?

Any ideas how to get that back?\n\nA: Have a look at this post - the app is included on one of the DVDs that came with your Mac. Alternatively, I'm quite positive you can copy the Terminal .app file from another Mac that's on the same OS, as well.\n\nA: just so you're aware, the newer Macbook Pros don't have DVDs supplied any more.\nThis means that deleting apps like Terminal (or, in my case, the X11 utilities) is a permanent state of affairs, unless you have access to another Mac (not in my case) or you have a good relationship with your local Apple store. In my case, the nice people at Dick Smith Electronics (Australian reseller) allowed me to access their support DVD with OSX Lion on it. As it turns out, I could also install Quartz from the support site, but that's not an option with utilities like Terminal.\nThe only other solution from Apple support was to reinstall the OS completely!\nSo generally speaking, this may become a more difficult-to-recover-from issue now that you only get the installed OS on disk.\n", "Q: Is is possible to use remote desktop to a Mac via direct cable or wireless? I develop on Windows, but I need a Mac for iPhone development.  So I'm thinking of getting a Mac mini or a MacBook for the Mac part, and connecting to it as needed from my Windows machine. A mini, in particular, doesn't come with a monitor or keyboard or mouse, so this would be the only way to use it.  \nThe question is: sometimes I travel and so I'm away from my network.  In this situation, is it possible to plug a cable directly from my Windows machine to the Mac and do remote desktop this way, or do both machines have to be on the same network and router and the sharing done via IP address in the usual way? Alternatively, can I skip the network entirely and remote desktop machine to machine via wireless signal?\n\nA: First off, it's important to note that Apple's Remote Desktop is not Microsoft's Remote Desktop, and the two are not interchangeable. That said, you can still use various VNC products to connect from the Windows machine to the Mac. \nFrom there, it's standard networking. If you want to leave the Mac Mini at home, you'll need to make sure that you can access the required ports, whether by port forwarding, or by an SSH tunnel/VPN allowing you to connect to your home network. \nIf you bring the Mac Mini with you, then you can easily create an ad hoc Wi-Fi network to connect them both too, in which case they will be on the same network, and you can connect that way. (You may need a monitor and keyboard attached to the Mac Mini at some point to configure this.)\nAdditionally, the Mac can automatically make any standard Ethernet cable into a crossover cable, such that an Ethernet cable connecting your Mac to your PC will create a network connection for the two machines, which, again, you can use as a standard network to connect from one to the other. \nThe network can be WiFi, direct point to point ethernet, point to point thunderbolt, point to point firewire or over a wired switched network of any of the above carriers.\n\nA: Over Ethernet:\nIf you would be primarily using wireless on both machines and will not be using Ethernet on the Windows machine or the Mac, then you could configure the LAN/Ethernet on the Windows machine and the Mac as a Private Network and use it whenever necessary.  \nFor example, the Windows machine could have its LAN set to a fixed IPv4 address of 10.0.0.1 and the Mac could have its LAN set to a fixed IPv4 address of 10.0.0.2. In both the cases, let the subnet be configured to 255.255.255.0. You can then connect the machines using an Ethernet cable and you should be able to do do anything on the network (remote desktop using Screen Sharing or VNC, ssh or file sharing).\nOver wireless:\nMachine to machine through wireless could be done similarly, but it would disrupt your wireless connection to the Internet. If speed is not a concern, you could have both the machines connected to the Internet over WiFi and use a free program like TeamViewer to connect.\nWindows VNC clients (to connect to a Mac that has Screen Sharing enabled):  \n\n\n*\n\n*TightVNC  \n\n*UltraVNC\n\n\nA: Any cable that will carry an IP based network will allow you to visually screen share a Mac - either with a virtual display or mirroring the current contents of the display. Wireless works well since it also networks and in most cases is fast enough to carry the screen data unless you have several 30 inch displays and are encoding the full bit depth of color information.\nThis is enabled in the sharing preference pane under Screen Sharing or Remote Management and uses a VNC based protocol. Apple's remote desktop software integrates best with many options to reduce bandwidth since the remote mac is encoding the screen contents and sending it over the network. For this reason, a high speed network is ideal - but you don't need to be on the local subnet if you are using iCloud or another location service to determine the IPv6 address of the Mac being observed.\nAs the other answers and comments have indicated that some clients are lacking, for my money, Apple's client and the one from Edovia called Screens are head and shoulders above the rest. The screens app is also nice as it includes a location service if you are remote and need to locate the IP / port of the Mac if it is located behind a router that uses NAT/PMP.\n\nA: Here is a more definitive answer using TightVNC.\nI've been connecting via my Wifi but it's slow at times. \nI wanted to make it faster since my Mac Mini sits on the same desk where my laptop is.\nSteps\nPrerequisite:\nA. make sure your Mac is on and you can control via VNC (see : http://www.howtogeek.com/214220/how-to-access-your-macs-screen-from-windows-and-vice-versa/ for more )\nB. make sure you have TightVNC (that's what I use) on your Win10 machine.\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your ethernet cable to your Mac and Win10 computer.\n\n*On the Mac go to System Preferences...\n\n\n\n*Choose the Network (icon) option\n\n\n\n\n\n*You will see a window which allows you to set up the ethernet and it is probably already configured for you.  \n\n\nPlease NOTE I've updated this section for a consistent IP ADDRESS you need to enter the value manually (configure it one time on Mac) so the Mac will use the SAME IP Address every time\n\nNecessity of Manual IP Configuration\nThe reason we do the manual setup is so when you power down your Mac and power up the next time, you do not get an assigned (random) ip address, but instead it will be set to this same value each time.  \nYou want the same value so you know what to use in the VNC program.\nYet Another Note\nWhen I changed to manual setup then my connection was extremely slow.  I couldn't get it to be faster.  I switched back to automatic configuration (see next image) and it was faster.  However, that means keeping my wifi running on the Mac so I can initially connect get the assigned IP address and then connecting the 2nd time each day over ethernet with assigned ip address.\nTry multiple options see what is best for you:\n\n\n\n*Get the IP ADDRESS\nThis is the important part. \nMake note of that IP Address starting with 169 in the image.\n\n\nThat is the IP address you will use to connect to the Mac.\nThat is the effective address of the Mac that your Win10 machine has assigned to the Mac.\nNow, I'm assuming that you've set up your Mac so it can be remotely controlled --- I won't go through that here.\n\n\n*Start TightVNC on your Win10 machine \n\n*type in the IP Address from above and connect.\n\n*Type in your \"connection password\" (which you previously set up on your Mac) when prompted and everything should work.\n\n\nYou can see your connection status from Win10 at Settings...Ethernet...Network and Sharing Center...:\n\nWhen you click Network and Sharing on the left you'll see:\n\nHere's how it will be setup on Win10 side:\n\nFinally, click the Ethernet link in the middle right and you'll see a status and should see more bytes received than sent over time --- that is the remote Mac sending data to your computer via VNC.\n\nAlso notice that it shows 1.0GBPS (Gigabit per second = 1000 MBPS)\nThat's probably much faster than your wireless network and this keeps that traffic off there.\nHere's my wifi connection -- notice that it is only about 72 MBPS (about 1/10 of ethernet).\n\n", "Q: Change date in menu bar from \"DAY MONTH\" to \"MONTH DAY\"? The date in my menu bar is in \"DAY MONTH\" format (e.g. 23 Oct) but I want it in \"MONTH DAY\" format (e.g. Oct 23). How can I do this? Also, it shows \"Tue\" as the week day when I'd prefer seeing it in full (e.g. \"Tuesday\").\nIn System Preferences -> Language & Text, \"Region\" is set to \"Custom\" because I changed a few things on the page. Under \"Dates\", I see: \"Thursday, January 5, 2012\", \"January 5, 2012\", \"2012-01-05\", and \"2012/01/05\".\nIs this date format based on my location and is therefore fixed? (I'm not in the US at the moment.)\nI'm using Mountain Lion now, but I recall a few versions ago that it was much easier to modify the date/time appearance in the menu bar by copying and pasting a few elements in the Date/Time preference pane.\n\nA: Have a look at this page on macyourself.com - it does exactly what you're looking for, it seems.\n", "Q: How can I force Mountain Lion's Messages app to refresh a conversation? Sometimes when an iMessage comes in and I switch to the Messages app, the conversation doesn't contain the new message.\nI know the message was received because an alert banner popped up with the correct message text, but it doesn't show up in Messages. It also doesn't seem to be present in Notification Center, despite being set to show 5 recent items.\nSometimes if I quit and reopen Messages it will refresh the conversation with the new message included, but sometimes not. And they still don't show up in Notification Center.\nIs there any reliable way to force Messages to refresh or reload the current conversation? Or make it receive messages reliably in the first place?\n\nA: \nIs there any reliable way to force Messages to refresh or reload the current conversation? Or make it receive messages reliably in the first place?\n\nNo. Messages is very buggy for many users and there is not a known fix at this time. I believe the most prominent client-side issues are resolved in Mavericks, but I am not running the it yet so perhaps not.\nAs far as I know, the best solution is to sign out of your account, log back in, and then restart Messages. For me, this fixes the ordering of messages (so they are sorted by timestamp) and generally keeps Messages running smoothly for a little while. However, the fix doesn't seem to last longer than a few days.\n\nA: Scroll to the top of the conversation and keep scrolling beyond and it will trigger a refresh.\nDoing this attempts to reload the conversation history and in the process loads any new messages at the bottom when you scroll back down.\nMessages is very buggy from my use as messages take time to appear on all my devices and sometimes one device shows the proper order and the other device doesn't. You can also try both you and the person who you are messaging delete the chat history on all of each others devices to completely refresh the conversation if it is only happening to one person.\n\nA: To be honest I think this is more a synchronization issue with the datacenter than an issue with the client app itself. Catching up multiple clients to the same point isn't as simple or straight forward as it sounds. Especially when one of the clients has been offline. Given the ubiquitous nature of the complaint I would favor this being a server side glitch. Which makes it something you'll just have to wait to see fixed. Same goes for if it's a client issue anyway, since Messages isn't open source, any fix will come through Apple, via Software Update/App Store.\n\nA: restart it (and wait), otherwise set status offline, and online again (also wait)\n", "Q: Is it possible to purchase hardware using my Apple ID credit? I know that I can purchase apps, music, movies etc. using the credit that's on my Apple ID. But is it also possible to purchase hardware from the online Apple Store, using that same credit on my Apple ID?\n\nA: No. The credit shown in the Mac App Store or iTunes App Stores is not spendable from the retail stores or the online store.\nThere is a physical gift card that can be bought for online store or retail store use, but it's not the same bucket of funds as the iTunes store gift cards.

My iMac's HD died last week, and so I was unable to access OS X (I had a Time Machine backup of it though). Fortunately I was able to boot into the Recovery HD and use Disk Utility to backup Boot Camp to a DMG file on an external drive before I lost that forever.\nSo, now I have a DMG file containing Windows 7. From what I understand, it's much more difficult to restore Windows Vista/7 than it is to restore Windows XP because the boot method has gotten more complex.\nHowever, could someone point me in the right direction in order to restore a Windows 7 DMG file to Boot Camp, and of course make it bootable? I already tried the method shown here, which is quoted at a lot of places, but it definitely only works with WinXP and nothing newer.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Try this variation on what its stated there: \n\n\n*\n\n*Run bootcamp to allocate the space 2- \n\n*Install W7\n\n*Go back to OSX (Install REFIT or similar as bootmanager (optional))\n\n*Restore your DMG image over the W7 partition\n\n\nWith this you dont need the fdisk commands as bootcamp should mark the partition as active (bootable).\nThis SHOULD work.\nThe problem with the linked page process is that w7 (just as osx) is actually in 2 partitions, a small boot one and a large with the OS, your DMG only contains the OS partition.\n\nA: I ran into the exact same issue of losing my disk with OS X and Bootcamped Win7.  I was able to make a .DMG of the \"Bootcamp\" \"partition\" as well.  I have tried:\n-Going through the bootcamp setup just far enough that it created my necessary partitions and then imaging the .DMG onto the correct partition\n-Installing a fresh copy of windows so that it booted from the new installation and then imaging the .DMG over that\nNeither of these worked for me.  The first option gave me a couple of problems: holding \"Option\" would not show me a windows bootable device, and choosing the windows option in system preferences>startup disk gave me an error stating it couldn't find a bootable disk.  The second option gives me both a bootable disk under startup disk and a windows option when holding \"Option\" on bootup, but either way, I only get a blinking cursor when it attempts to boot the windows partition :-(\nI'm wondering if it would be easier to just totally start over, or if there's a way to fix the MBR which will still save me the time of setting up all my data again....\nMore research...\n\nA: I have spent long time on this and finally found a work around to restore DMG image file of windows 7 to a partition on mac drive and then boot in to widows holding option ket at start up or in startup option.\nJust didn't want to type loads, as this is an old post and maybe everyone else has found away too.\nCheers\nDanny\n", "Q: How can I add an autocorrect mapping to the iOS dictionary? My iPhone, running iOS 6, used to autocorrect ill -> I'll for me and I liked that. It has, very recently, stopped doing this. I suppose it makes sense given than ill is actually a word, but it is a word I rarely use and certainly use far less frequently than I'll.\nIs there any way to add a correction mapping back to the iOS 6 dictionary such that typing ill autocorrects to I'll for me?\n\nA: My workaround has been to add a keyboard shortcut that replaces the text ill with I'll any time I add it. Not perfect, but as a stop-gap it will do.\nTo add the shortcut go to Settings -> General -> Keyboard and scroll to the bottom of the page. You will see an Add New Shortcut... button. Press it.\n\nIn the Shortcut configuration page type I'll in to the Phrase entry box and ill in to the Shortcut entry box and press the Save button.\n\nNow any time you type ill it will auto-correct to I'll.\n\nA: It's an imperfect solution, but there's always the option of resetting the Keyboard Dictionary. This undoes all the learning your iPhone has done, so you're back to the fresh-out-of-the-box behaviour. Obviously this may be a set-back in some areas, but if you're getting strange behaviour, it may be the way to go.\nTo reset the learning, open Settings → General → Reset and tap Reset Keyboard Dictionary.\n", "Q: How do I set the Camera Roll to send the actual size (rather than small size) via email?

Basically, how does the system save every state in the workspace (windows, desktops, open programs etc) when you do a restart ? Does that affect the efficiency of the software in the long run ?\nFor example, when I do a restart in windows I know that the laptop restarts completely. Resetting the hardware/software states etc. However, a restart on the macbook pro is like a hibernation in windows, how do they do that ? Is the power to the RAM not cut in the restart process ?\nEDIT\nThere seems to be a clash in responses down there .. Is the image cleared on reboot or not ?\n\nA: When you restart a Mac it is the same as restarting a Windows machine as far as clearing out the contents of RAM. The difference is when you log in the state of all of the running apps is saved when they quit so they open to the same place they were. This is dependent on how well the application is written. Apps where less attention was paid to saving state don't come back to exactly where they were. Apple apps are very good at this so it appears as if they were never quit.\n\nA: One trick that OSX uses to make it seem like it's rebooting and restoring the state very quickly is that it's actually showing you a picture of your desktop for the first few seconds after you boot.  You can't actually interact with your computer until all the programs load, and on a Mac with slow storage (like my Mac Mini with a pokey 5200 RPM hard drive), there's a very noticeable period when the computer looks ready to use but is not.\n\nA: The \"sleep image\" takes a a snapshot of the state of your computer at all times, and stores it in a file the size of your actual ram.  During Boot or restart, this image is searched for for restore, unless you uncheck restore windows when you restart or shut down.\nIts just another process in the booting phases.  \n", "Q: How do you enable retina display support on Firefox?

How can I make it use Google Talk by preference (without deleting the other accounts, since I want them to be available as well)?\n\nA: As of 10.8.2 the only way to do that is to keep that particular conversation open all the time.\nAnother workaround is to copy the preferred google talk info to another contact name with just that. \"Jane googletalk\" so you know which is which.\nOn a conceptual level i don't think they will fix it.

With the phone raised to my ear conversations are fine, but as soon as I put it on loudspeaker, there's a time lag.\nThe same goes for the phones in the conference rooms at work.\nWhy is this and can I fix it?\n\nA: The main technical problem with most speaker phones is that they are not full duplex.\nThis means, that unlike a normal phone conversation, both parties cannot speak at the same time. To avoid feedback, the system mutes the microphone most of the time and instead tries to detect when you are about to speak.\nWhen both parties are on speaker phones, this system works quite badly since the normal conversation queues of \"mmmm, uh-huh, go on...\" can cause it to cut the real conversation off at times.\nTo fix this, don’t use speaker and use headset or Bluetooth for your mic. \n", "Q: Mount a samba drive, with password from keychain I have a problem with Jettison, that tries to remount a samba drive, that is protected by a password.\nIt uses the following command line:\n/sbin/mount_smbfs //[user]@[server]/work /Volumes/work \n\nOf course it fails since the password is not present (nor the -N switch)\nI am aware that it should contain a password, but I do not want the app to know it.

What important information might I lose?\n\nA: Since OS X 10.6 and so on, the format of .DS_Store changed from text into binary and it seems to be undocumented by Apple, therefore you really don't know the exact consequences of removing such files.\nBut based on the information that we have, the file is basically storing information about how it displays directories and files (e.g. its position in Finder). It holds a series of records giving attributes of the files in the directory or of the directory itself (referred to as .) in a B-tree like format.\nIt also stores from where the files were removed in Trash folder, so removing the DS_Store file from there, Finder won't know the original location of your removed files. \nTherefore if you don't worry about how your folder is displayed in Finder, you can safely remove it. If it's DS_Store file within your Trash folder, better leave it.\n\nIf you're further interested what's exactly stored in DS_Store files, you may try to use dsstore_dump.pl tool which can read a store file's records in human-readable format.\nSee also: DS_Store Format at CPAN\n\nA: .DS_Store files are only used by the Finder to hold custom view settings for that particular folder. In most cases nothing will happen if you delete them, or at worst custom Finder view settings (icon size, position, background color, etc) will be lost.\nIf you are trying to maintain a 'spatial Finder' experience in OS X, you might care more, but for most users no change will be noticed.\n\nA: The worst that will happen is that folder display attributes (icon positions and view settings) will go away. If you don't consider icon positions and view settings important, there is no important information stored in these files, so it is safe to delete them.\n\nA: As far as I can tell, they store all the settings shown in view options in icon and list view (or parts of the settings after some of them have been changed).\n\nIn column view the options at the bottom are the same for all folders, but the arrange by and sort by modes are still saved in .DS_Store files.\n\nAlways open in means \"save the previously used view mode of this folder to a .DS_Store file\". It overrides the default view mode (FXPreferredViewStyle, which is often changed after closing a window). If you check \"Always open in column view\" and press ⌘1, the folder-specific view mode becomes icon view.\n.DS_Store files also contain the default dimensions of windows, the shown parts of windows, the positions of icons in icon view, and the width of the sidebar.\nSpotlight comments are stored in both .DS_Store files and extended attributes. If you delete a .DS_Store file, Finder won't see the comments, but Spotlight will.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro hard disk failure. How to recover and clean install? I have a MacBook pro, 2009, 13 inch, Original Snow leopard OS.\nRecently, I was experiencing that my MacBook some times froze or restarted automatically! I didn't care, and one day it did not start!\nWhen booting, it does not proceed the first gray page, and circle keeps rotating, until after few minutes the circle changes to a NO Entry sign.\nI used Opt key while starting the MacBook and booted into Bootcamp. It works fine, I have been using Bootcamp windows for 2-3 weeks now, and just twice I got the Blue Death Screen, out of sudden!\nI got the opportunity to back up all my files.\nI used Opt-Cmd-P-R combination and reset the NVRAM.\nAlso I pressed the D key while starting and made a Apple Hardware Test. The result was recognition of the following problem: \n4HDD/11/40000004:SATA(0,0)\n\n\n*\n\n*Can some one please let me know what my problem is?\nIf my hard disk is busted, how comes it works (almost) problem-less in bootcamp?\nCan the problem somehow be solved? For example if it is a bad sector on my hard disk, by isolating that area or so? \n\n*I tried to boot from MacBook DVDs and try to clean install the OS again, but when I restart and press and hold C key, (while the OSX DVD which came by my laptop is inserted), nothing happens!

How can I access that?\nYour helpful comments are highly appreciated.\nThanks.\n\nA: I'm sorry to tell you that your hard drive is dead (or at least is on the way out), and will need to be replaced. If you're not too confident, you can call Apple Care who should be able to recommend a local shop who can sell you a replacement hard drive and install it for you.\nAlternatively, it's quite easy to replace the hard drive yourself. If you google it you'll see there's loads of articles and videos on how to do it (here's a good one to get you started). Apple even has instructions on how to change the hard drive in the macbook pro manual, which is definitely worth a read before you crack it open.\n\nA: @cybergeek654\nA common problem with the 13\" early generation of the macbook pro.  More than likely this is simply a hard drive CABLE which is a 14$ replacement at an apple store.  Quick easy repair, and can usually be done while you wait.  9 out of 10 repairs for this issue were remedied by replacing the cable, and in turn we were able to save all of the data as the HD was not replaced.  Best of luck.  \n\nA: I just replaced the hard drive in my MacBook Pro 13\" 2009 and same problem again.\nNew out of box hard drive. Formatted and cloned. Booted first time great. Second time can't edit anything or trash or open some program's.\nCould be a cable problem.

But I have experienced this problem on Lion as well.\n\n\nA: According to http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20120727110524438, you would want to check the /private/var/db/receipts/ folder for any files related to the app.\nIf the piracy messed with receipts, you may need exceptional records to clean up another app's receipt so this confusion might still be a result of your abuse of the normal app purchasing process.\n", "Q: New Computer bought will information be deleted? I bought a new computer recently and have not plugged my iphone into it yet. I had my phone synced with my old computer which crashed and cannot retrieve any information off of it including my music. So if I plug my iPhone into my new computer will everything be deleted or since I have iCloud will everything be saved? I want to know this information before I would plug into my new computer.\n\nA: On your iPhone go to Settings > iCloud > Storage and Backup and turn on iCloud Backup\nIt will save your configurations and pictures on iCloud. This is the same you do when you sync your iPhone with iTunes. In this way you can restore your data from iCloud.\nOnce you have done the first backup you can attach the iPhone to your computer without loosing data.\n\nA: On your new computer, you can also open iTunes, visit the iTunes Store and click the Purchased link in the upper right menu (depending on your country, this might be in a different language. You can visit the US store first, spot the menu entry there, and return to your store to find your version of it). This link will bring you to a page where you can re-download all the apps, books, and songs you purchased in iTunes.\nBut this will only work for iTunes purchased things.\n", "Q: Macbook 15 Retina Bootcamp Windows 7 64bit When I go through the bootcamp process, then get to the windows 7 setup screen.

Not sure if this is the right site to post this question on.\n\nA: I've seen that Exception before when I throw a Javascript primitive and it reproduces reliably and consistently with my Instruments-4.5 (4523).\nYour comments state that this does not reproduce reliably.  Is it possible that your tests do not take the same path reliably (and hence, not consistently throwing), and this is why they only reproduce sometimes?  Before continuing, I suggest verifying that your tests are taking the same path consistently.\nTo verify throwing a Javascript primitive is the case with your tests, do these steps.\nFind a Javascript test file that reproduces with your InstrumentsException.\nVerify the Javascript test throws a Javascript primitive, as opposed to a Javascript Object.  Specifically, you want a line that uses \"throw\" but does not use \"new\" in the same line.  The relevant line should look like this,\nthrow \"Who's your daddy\";   //Instruments throws an InstrumentsException with this.\n\nnot \nthrow new Error(\"Who's your daddy?\");  //Instruments has no problems with this.\n\nVerify that your installation does actually throw that specific InstrumentsException when you throw a primitive.\nthrow \"Who's your daddy\";\n\nAt this point, you've got a pretty good suspect.  But you to make more certain, try removing the suspicious \"throw\" line or replacing it with something else, just to see if you can get the test to pass.\n\nA: The obvious, though probably not helpful, answer is that while doing something with the automation, Instruments encountered a missing string while trying to append it to an existing string.  I'd be suspicious of something in the .js file being the catalyst for this.\nI'd still file it as a bug, since bad input (if that should happen to be the reason) shouldn't cause a crash.\n\nA: I was just experiencing 100% reproducible crashes in Instruments (not very productive) that seem to have been fixed by rebuilding the spotlight index (sudo mdutil -E /), so that might be worth a try for anyone who can't get Instruments to run for more than a few seconds.\n\nA: FWIW, I'm getting exactly the same trace trying to run instruments through the zucchini framework (pointer values different, but the trace is the same).  I can run the framework on the CoreDataBooks sample w/o error, but when I try to point it at my development app, I get this issue.  I suspect a version mismatch, since I'm running zucchini on Xcode 4.5.1 and most of the zucchini crowd isn't there yet.  But invoking zucchini gets the same two error lines you began with.  Good luck, I'll update if I find anything interesting.\n", "Q: Can't update Boot Camp in Windows 7 (MacbookPro9,1) I've been looking for situations similar to these before posting, but failed to find any. When trying to install Windows 7 (64bit) through Boot Camp Assistant on Lion, the Windows Support Software download failed. Thus, I followed the instructions from this post and from this cafe-encounter.net page and downloaded the suitable package for my model (MacBookPro9,1). I then installed the package and all the drivers seem to be working properly. The problem is that now I can't install the 3.1 (and consequently the 3.2) Boot Camp updates available from Apple Downloads website.\nWhen trying to run the update, an error message stops me from proceeding:\n\"The Boot Camp 3.1 Update requires Boot Camp 3.0 or greater. Please install Boot Camp 3.0 before proceeding with the install of the 3.1 Update.\"\nI thought that maybe the Boot Camp version I just downloaded is the most recent one. But if that's the case, shouldn't the message be different? And if that's not it, then I'm out of ideas.\n\nA: So my first guess was right, the WindowsSupport.dmg downloaded from the post's links installed Boot Camp 4.0.0.1. I just checked the details tab on the Bootcamp executable (Program Files\\Boot Camp), didn't think of that before.\nNonetheless, I still believe the updates should be prepared to check for more recent versions and throw a different message.\n", "Q: What window is playing audio?

I have downloaded the ISO, however I don't have a CD drive as its a MacBook Air and all my USB drives are too small. I am trying to install it using an SD Card as I read that they are handled in the same way as USB drives, however I can't find a way to get the assistant to recognise the SD card. Can any one help?\n\nA: You can't do that as neither, OSX nor W7/W8 support booting from an SD card. \nGet a simple usb-sd card adapter (not a multi card reader) and that'll work. In fact its what i used a micro-sd card in a usb adapter with an old 8gb card.\n\nA: I'm currently installing Windows 7 from an 16 GB SD card. From a Windows computer, I prepared the SD card with WinToFlash and the ISO of Windows 7, and when it was done I mounted the SD card with a multi card reader, and Boot Camp read it! \n\nA: This is partially inaccurate.

This should work as long as the Pi got an IP from DHCP and responds to ping.\nFirst, open up a terminal and run ifconfig en0. This should give you the info for your ethernet interface, if not, just use ifconfig and find it yourself. Make a note of the broadcast address. In my case, it's 192.168.2.255:\ninet 192.168.2.99 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.2.255\n\nSo I'll run the command ping 192.168.2.255. Do the same with your broadcast address, and hit CTRL-C to stop the ping once you have some results:\nMiramar:~ gabriel$ ping 192.168.2.255\nPING 192.168.2.255 (192.168.2.255): 56 data bytes\n64 bytes from 192.168.2.99: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.113 ms\n64 bytes from 192.168.2.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=255 time=3.567 ms\n64 bytes from 192.168.2.99: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.096 ms\n64 bytes from 192.168.2.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=255 time=3.455 ms\n^C\n\nThe broadcast is intended to go out to everything on the network. Everything that hears it should respond. In my case, I only see my IP and my router's - I guess it didn't bother passing the request on to my other machines, but you're directly connected to the Pi so you should see it there.\n", "Q: Is it wise to turn off the iPad completely if I don't use it during the day? A friend of mine has an iPad that she uses only once a day for about a half hour.\nI told her to turn it off completely in between uses to conserve energy - no point having the device run in standby for 23.5 hours a day. (So no standby, but a real \"swipe to turn off\" shutdown.)\nI'm not completely sure whether this is correct, though. Is this the optimal way to go in terms of optimal battery lifespan? Battery life (i.e. the time until she has to recharge it again) is secondary, we just want to preserve the battery for as long as possible.\nApple's iPad battery tips don't give any hints, nor does what appears to be the reference question here on Apple.SE.\n\nA: The total life of the iPad's battery is going to be affected by the temperature you keep the battery at and the number of discharge-charge cycles it goes through.\nTurning off the iPad will cause the battery to drain more slowly than leaving it in standby mode. But the battery will still be draining when the device is \"powered off\" as there's circuitry enabled to detect you pressing the power button to turn it back on.\nI'm not sure how long an iPad that's off will hold its charge vs. one that is simply sitting in standby mode. I can't imagine the marginal gain in battery life is worth the hassle of waiting for it to power up every time you want to use it.\n\nA: I haven't seen anything that would qualify as scientific study on this, so reader beware, but my own anecdotal observations suggest that an iPad in standby consumes very minimal amounts of power.\nI typically use my iPad every day, but I've never noticed it losing any charge overnight (based on the percentage remaining), which can be around 10 hours or so from last use in a day to first use the next. More to the point, I've had stretches where I haven't used it for 3-4 days in a row, and I don't ever recall seeing it loose more than a few percentage points of battery in that span.\nAgain, this is all anecdotal, I may have a good (or bad) battery, my usage patterns may condition the battery better, the meter may not be very accurate, etc. But I would say don't worry about shutting it off. For one thing, the major power draw in the iPad is the screen. Secondly, one of the nice things about it (for me anyway) is that I can pick it up, quickly look something up and put it back to sleep, with virtually no lag (entering my password takes far longer than waking from sleep).\n\nA: iPads on iOS7 rapidly drains the battery fast when not turned off. Since your friend uses his iPad quite sometime in a day, it's better that his iPad should be turned off to conserve more battery. \n\nA: Not sure if this helps but I have an iPad Air 2 9 inch but I bought an iPad Pro 12 inch. I didn't use the iPad Air 2 for about 40 days so it sat in standby. It had about 95% charge when I stopped using it but had a 60% charge after 40 days in standby. That 60% did drop quickly once I used it though. I did have the wifi on and it is set to automatically check for updates and mail.\n\nA: I have actually noticed that my iPad 2 consumes less power while in standby than it does if it is completely shutdown. I can leave it in standby for several days, and the battery will slowly lose its charge over that time. However, if I completely shutdown the iPad and do not use it for a few days, the battery will be completely drained and I have to plug it in to power it back on. It seems like a very poor electronic design to me. Why would anything lose more power while it is supposedly turned off?\n", "Q: What doesn't get cloned to new hard drive in Super Duper? I recently upgraded my 2010 Macbook Pro HDD to an SSD. I went from a 500GB HDD to a 512GB SSD (Crucial M4). I formatted the new SSD using Disk Utility into Mac OS X Journaled file system. I then used Super Duper to clone the original drive over by selecting \"Backup -  all files\" from the dropdown.\nI recall that the original drive had about 120GB of free space leftover on it. With my newly cloned drive, it states that there's 195GB free. I primarily used iStat Menus, to measure the amount of free space.\nSo the math looks to be like:\n195 - 12 - 120 = 63\nAbout 63GB of difference, taking into account the 12GB of increased storage already. It's actually probably closer to 70GB considering I've added some new files in usage recently. \nWhat didn't get cloned over to the new drive in this approximate 60-70GB? \nEverything boots up and runs just fine. There just seems to be some kind of discrepancy of what was reported as free before and currently.\nSome things to consider:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have Windows 7 (Ultimate) and Windows 8 (Preview edition) as VMs using Parallels 8, which were cloned over.\n\n*This is taking into account that I emptied the Trash already.\n\n*The original HDD is a Seagate from Apple.\n\n\nA: When you select the SuperDuper script / copy mode, you can change the scripts, that SuperDuper will run during the copy process.\n\nAs you can see, a couple of files are omitted:\n\nSo the temporary and cache files, etc. may have taken quite some space on your old disk. Some other possible reasons could be:\n\n\n*\n\n*SuperDuper omits OSX swap files (/private/var/vm), which can become quite large\n\n*The spotlight index is rebuilt after cloning a drive. Depending on your system, the spotlight index may become quite large as well over time.\n\n*SuperDuper does a permission repair before cloning. Maybe some space was liberated on your old drive during that process.\n\n*As Richard suggested, SuperDuper does not clone the hidden rescue partition. But this should not be more than ca. 1GB\n\n", "Q: Refining a Sublime Text 2 / Transmit workflow I recently changed code editors from Coda to Sublime Text 2. All in all, I am finding that ST2 fits my web development workflow almost perfectly. \nMy one friction point is when interacting with an FTP server. I use Transmit (from Panic) to mount the server as a mounted disk. I then open that disk as a project in ST2.\nWhen I do that, the Command-T / Command-P shortcuts in ST2 (used to quickly open any file using fuzzy matching) and the Find In Files feature does not return results until I drill down to those directories in the sidebar.\nNow, I believe this is because Transmit has yet to \"open\" those directories and so the file system is unaware of what is in each directory. \nIs there a way to either force Transmit to \"open\" those directories so they load instantly in ST2, or another alternative I haven't discovered yet?\n\nA: Answering my own question here.\nA follower on Twitter recommended Sublime FTP ($16), a third-party add-on by the author of Package Control, Will Bond. \nFor my own setup, I use his Sublime SFTP Solution which maps a local folder to the remote version. This setup allows me to quickly access my files.\nSince working with remote files can come with some risk, I use Joel Thornton's Automatic Backups add-on to create a time-stamped backup of whatever file I have just saved. That way, in case something tragic happens, I can quickly roll back to an earlier version of my file.\n", "Q: How to make a bootable USB key from an .iso image on Mac OS X? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I make a bootable USB flash drive for a MacBook Air? \n\nHow to make a bootable USB key from any .iso image on Mac OS X?\n\nA: The easiest way is to right click on the .iso file and select 'Burn Disk Image XXX to Disc...\". This will run Burn app with appropriate settings. When ready, hit the Burn button.\n\nHere is longer version for advanced users.\nBased on this article, you should:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up Disk Utility.\n\n*Select the USB key (select the root device, not its partitions).\n\n*Select the partition section as shown below:\n\n\n*Change the Scheme to 1 Partition\n\n*Change the Format to Free Space\n\n*Click Apply\n\n\nWARNING! THIS WILL DESTROY ALL DATA ON THE KEY!\n\n\n*Once it’s completed you can quit out of Disk Utility.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of doing this is mainly to ensure that the USB key is in a consistent known state and also to ensure that any volumes are not mounted by OS X. It is not required and you can skip it if you’d rather just unmount the volumes yourself.\n\nNext you need to prepare ISO image by following the below command:\n[#542]: hdiutil convert -format UDRW -o debian-6.0.7-amd64-netinst.img debian-6.0.7-amd64-netinst.iso \nReading Master Boot Record (MBR : 0)…\nReading Debian 6.0.7 amd64 1             (Apple_ISO : 1)…\nReading  (Windows_NTFS_Hidden : 2)…\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nElapsed Time:  2.054s\nSpeed: 81.8Mbytes/sec\nSavings: 0.0%\ncreated: /Users/evan/Downloads/debian-6.0.7-amd64-netinst.img.dmg\n\nFinally you need to copy the image to your USB drive.

This is accomplished by simply prepending ‘r’ to the device so that /dev/disk1 is going to become /dev/rdisk1\nUpdate 2: Specifying a blocksize of 1m will also significantly speed things up.\n\nNext use dd command to copy the image over:\n[#544]: dd if=./xbmc-9.11-live-repack.img.dmg of=/dev/rdisk1 bs=1m\n\n\nOn the command line we specify the Input File using if= and the Output File using of= and dd will copy the data from input to output, block by block.\nOnce it’s completed you can exit Terminal and remove the USB key from your OS X machine, it should now be able to bootup your ISO on another machine.\n\n\nTo boot the system from such a drive, press ⌥ immediately after rebooting.\n", "Q: Safari won't enter fullscreen I'm currently running Safari 5.1.4 on Mac OS X Lion 10.7.3, and after bringing it out of the fullscreen mode, I quit safari using Command+Q. \nWhen I restarted my Mac, for some reason, Safari won't return to fullscreen mode despite attempts to click on the icon on the upper right hand corner or by going through the View menu manually.

From what I've read, the new Fusion Drive does all of it's magic in software, using the Core Storage APIs. \nCan I get my setup to behave like a Fusion Drive? That is, I want the two drives to appear as a single logical volume, with the system automatically moving frequently accessed files to the SSD. I understand that we can easily stripe or extend or RAID drives, but the automatically managed tiered storage features of Fusion drive would be great to have without investing in new hardware.\n\nA: In addition to @jtbandes being right, you can create and manage logical volumes using CoreStorage, but according to the KB Article HT5446 there are some \"limitations\" to the Fusion drive. \nAn alternative to the Fusion drive (which is basically a SSD AND an HDD grouped as a logical volume) is move the \"/Users\" folder to a HDD and leave all the OS X files and Apps in the SSD, you would get the SSD performance for apps and the OS, and all the space you need for your files in the HDD.  Restoring from Time Machine on a different machine or reconfigured drive setup will not work with a moved /home for that user account.\n\nA: Yes, you can create a fusion drive on older Macs, described in full length here:\n\n\n*\n\n*You obviously need both an SSD and a HD. Let's assume they are known to the OS as disk1 and disk7. You can check disk id by diskutil list.\n\n*diskutil cs create bla disk1 disk7 to create it, where bla is the name you give to the fusion drive.\n\n*diskutil cs list and take note of the Logical Volume Group ID\n\n*diskutil cs createVolume <ID from above> jhfs+ blub 100%, where blub is the name you give to the volume.\n\n\nLink to Apple instructions: Click Here \nNote: These are instructions to fix a split fusion drive, but work also for making one.\n\nA: I set up a Fusion drive using the Terminal utility in the OS X 10.8.2 installer loaded onto a USB thumb drive, after installing an SSD drive as the second drive in my 2011 Mac Mini.\nThis wiped out the data on both drives, but that's what I wanted: a fresh system with a new Fusion drive.\nIf you don't want to save your existing installation, just use the OS X 10.8.2 installer to create the drive (make sure it's 10.8.2 and above, though, as Fusion wasn't supported in 10.8.1 and earlier).\nOnce the installer had loaded, you can open a Terminal window and type in the diskutil commands there. Seemed easier to me than cloning my original drive to an external disc, booting from that, and Fusing the two drives.\nThe most complete and easiest guide I've seen written for creating a Fusion drive (and the one I successfully used) is at http://blog.macsales.com/15617-creating-your-own-fusion-drive.\nIncidentally, if you have a 2011 Mac mini and haven't already bought the cable you'll need to connect the second drive, OWC has a great DIY kit. It's cheap, comes with a set of tools and glossy, professionally written step-by-step instructions. I was impressed. Available at http://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/DIYIMM11D2.\n\nA: Yes and no.\nThe Fusion Drive is taking advantage of Core Storage to act as one logical volume, which you see as a single volume but can actually be made up of multiple physical volumes (in this case, an SSD and an HDD).\nYou can create and manage Core Storage volumes with the diskutil command in Terminal. (Disk Utility does not yet have extensive Core Storage support via the GUI.) In particular, you can create your own logical volume groups and logical volumes, with diskutil coreStorage createLVG and diskutil coreStorage createVolume, among other commands (see the man page for details).\nMy guess, however, is that the Fusion Drive's special behavior, automatically moving your data between physical volumes, is encoded in a special logical volume family, and this is probably not something you could mimic easily. (I'd be happy if someone could prove me wrong!)\n\nA: I just finished creating a DIY Fusion Drive in my early 2009 MacBook Pro. It works great, and I figured out how to keep my recovery and Boot Camp partitions at the same time.\nI started with backups: Both a Time Machine and a Carbon Copy Cloner backup of my Mountain Lion partition, and a WinClone backup of my Boot Camp partition. All backups were saved to an external hard drive that wasn't involved in the Fusion Drive upgrade.\nFor hardware, I bought a 128 GB Samsung 830 SSD and a hard drive caddy tray that let me replace my Apple Superdrive with a hard drive. (The instructions that came with the caddy are completely wrong, but the caddy is simple enough that I figured out how to install the drive in the caddy anyway.) The installation was tricky and required a tiny Torx screwdriver and some spudgers, but the instructions on ifixit.com were clear and helpful.\nAfter installation, I discovered using System Information that the SSD in the CD bay had a negotiated link speed of 1.5 Gigabit rather than 3 Gigabit. So I opened up the MacBook Pro again and swapped the hard drive and the SSD. Next time I booted both drives were running at 3 Gigabit. As a temporary measure for testing, I formatted the SSD using Disk Utility as a single journaled HFS+ partition.\nTo create the Fusion Drive, I booted into the recovery partition by holding down Command-R during boot. I used the Terminal in recovery mode to create the Fusion Drive.\nThe first step was to use the diskutil list command to get a complete list of the partitions on both drives. In my case, disk0s2 was the partition on the SSD and disk1s2 was my usual Mountain Lion partition on the hard disk.\nThen I used the command diskutil cs create Fusion disk0s2 disk1s2 to create a logical volume group from the two partitions. This is the step that was special. By specifying partitions rather than whole disks when creating the logical volume group. I was able to leave the recovery and Boot Camp partitions intact. Most instructions I've seen have used disk names rather than partition names, which wipes the entire disk clean. The use of partition names is documented in the diskutil man page.\nNext I used the diskutil cs createVolume <ID from above> jhfs+ Reliance '100%' command to create a logical volume using 100% of the logical volume group. Since I still had my recovery and Boot Camp partitions, there was no need to leave room for them in the logical volume group, so I was free to use all of the space for my new Fusion Drive partition.\nAt that point the hard part was done. I booted from my cloned backup and used the Install OS X Mountain Lion application to re-install Mountain Lion on the Fusion Drive. (I could have cloned it back instead, but I liked the idea of taking the opportunity to reinstall Mountain Lion.) Once the install was done, I used Migration Assistant to copy my files and accounts from the clone back to the Fusion Drive.\nAs usual after a backup/restore, my Mac was busy for many hours re-indexing Spotlight and the next Time Machine backup was extremely slow. But once these things were out of the way, everything sped up and I started getting the benefits of my new Fusion Drive! It is continuing to get faster as it learns which applications I use most often.\nThere are a few glitches at the end of this process, but I consider them all extremely minor:\n\n\n*\n\n*If I boot with the option key down, my Mac firmware lists the Fusion Drive twice. Selecting either drive boots just fine.\n\n*Disk Utility shows my Boot Camp partition as being part of the Fusion Drive, even though it is only on the hard drive. This seems to be harmless.\n\n*The Boot Camp control panel in Windows 7 also lists the Fusion Drive twice. Again, both choices work fine.\n\n*The first time I booted into Windows 7 I got the Windows boot loader screen, probably because I moved the hard drive with the Boot Camp partition to the CD bay. Windows 7 adjusted the drive address and it's been booting normally ever since.\n\n\nAll in all, it's a great upgrade and I'm glad I did it!\n\nA: Here we made a video that outlines the process for you : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_odnNpv-FQ\nCommands you'll need in order:\ndiskutil list\ndiskutil cs create Fusion diskx diskx\nNOTE: You can replace Fusion with whatever you'd like to name your Logical Volume Group\ndiskutil cs list\ndiskutil coreStorage createVolume YOUR_DEVICE_ID_HERE jhfs+ \"Macintosh Fusion\" 100%\nNOTE: You can replace \"Macintosh Fusion\" with whatver you want to name your drive. Remember to use \"\"s if you want a space in your name like we did, otherwise you do not need them.\nAfter installation is finished, open terminal and turn off indexing:\nsudo mdutil -i off\nIf you would like to revert back to 2 separate drives, boot into the installer again, open Terminal and type:\ndiskutil cs delete YOUR_DEVICE_ID\nYou will then be able to format them however you'd like using Terminal or Disk Utility.\n", "Q: How does Application Level Firewall work? I'm a bit confused about OS X Mountain Lion's Application Level Firewall.\nI have enabled ALF (Application Level Firewall) in Settings -> Secuity & Privacy -> Firewall and have some rules for some applications in it and those rules are stored by ALF in /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/com.apple.alf.plist\nBut it seems that ipfw is disabled (no /etc/ipfilter) and sudo ipfw list is 65535 allow ip from any to any. pf is also disabled.\nSo I do not understand how ALF works. If ALF does not use the known legacy firewall applications, how does it do what it does? What does it use for a backend or is it a totally separate application that does not deal with ipfw or pf?\n\nA: ALF uses a process called Firewall. The rules list you are looking for exists under: /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/com.apple.alf.plist\nAdditionally, any changes made on a per user basis, is made to ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.alf.plist.\nIf you navigate to /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/, you will also see the Firewall and socketfilterfw processes, which supply the backend and configuration manager (respectively) for ALF.\nYou can read more about Apple's in-house firewall here: http://krypted.com/tag/socketfilterfw/\n\nA: See OS X Server: About the Firewall service.\nAlthough the topic is about OS X Server, the last paragraph says:\n\nAdditional Information\n      The ipfw command is deprecated in Mountain Lion. If you want to manually configure Firewall rules, use the pfctl binary for forward compatibility. For instructions, see man pfctl.\n\n", "Q: What are the consequences of changing my Apple ID password?

When syncing appeared to be done, the New Zealand folder was not where I expected it (in Bookmarks Bar > travel).\nIs there anything I can do to fix this? Should my next step be to report a bug to Apple?\nI see that an Apple support document recommends no more than 25,000 bookmarks. I just exported my bookmarks to Safari Bookmarks.html, then ran grep HREF Safari\\ Bookmarks.html | wc -l and the result was 3882. So that doesn't appear to be the problem. Next I will work through the troubleshooting steps in TS4001.\n\nA: I followed the troubleshooting steps in TS4001 (linked in the question), and now the errant folder is on my iPhone with what appears to be the correct list of bookmarks.\n", "Q: Annotation of a PDF file in my Dropbox in iPad and keep it the last version in Dropbox I have a folder in my Dropbox that I keep my eBooks in it.

Syncing is a passable substitute unless you have a deeply nested batch of folders with gigabytes of PDF. Try that in dropbox and it eats a big chunk of your iPad's space and takes over hour (from experience). What is needed is something that uses the dropbox API to allow direct editing of individual docs. It is possible because UXWrite does exactly this.\n\nA: This is quite an old question, but I can see that in the dropbox app this feature is still not incorporated.\nA decent solution for me is to use the Files app, where is the dropbox folder too. There is possible to edit pdf file with the iPad.\n\nA: our app, Xodo, has all these features from annotating PDF documents to syncing with Dropbox.

On old Macs before OS X files already could have two \"forks\" - a data fork and a resource fork.\nAccording to Wikipedia, at some point the HFS+ filesystem of OS X gained the ability to have an arbitrary number of forks, much like Microsofts \"Alternate Data Streams\" (ADS).\n\nHFS Plus permits filenames up to 255 UTF-16 characters in length, and n-forked files similar to NTFS, though until recently, almost no systems software takes advantage of forks other than the data fork and resource fork.\n\nI want to know what the official term is for these forks or streams. I guess it's possible they're just called \"forks\" but that term has several meanings already in computing. I've done some searching but can't find a definitive answer.\n\nA: Apple uses \"multiple fork\" or the shortened form \"multi-fork\" consistently through its documentation, so it seems it is the official term. I list here a few examples:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/General/Conceptual/SLGlobalGlossary/Glossary/Glossary.html (Last updated: 2010-07-09)\n\nHFS+  Hierarchical File System Plus.

If so, how?\n\nA: You can email yourself the files, then from Mail, open the files in iBooks.\n\nA: No, that doesn't work: there is no iCloud sync of the entire ebook file. The only thing that is possible with non-iBooks store ebooks is to sync the reading location and notes.\nSo, if you load an ePub file into iTunes/iBooks on a Mac and then sync it via iTunes to your iOS device(s), and if you have the sync option activated in all of them, the reading position and notes/highlights/bookmarks will be synchronized across them.\nNote that in fact that's what happens with the purchased iBooks: it's not that Apple is saving your books on iCloud, just the record of your purchase.\n\nA: This functionality will be support beginning with iOS 9.3. It will support syncing the entire library, including PDFs on any device.\nHere is the Apple Support page with documentation: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205751\nFederico Viticci mentioned this on Twitter first. \n\nA: This feature is now active in iOS 9.3, however it seems rather buggy. I've found my own ePubs will often not open properly, won't download properly or won't sync locations/bookmarks. Been fighting the things for days now. \nIf you do manage to get it working, please let us know how.

I've been stationed in Japan for the next three years, and they've got some ludicrous speeds on their fiber Internet over here.\nThat being said, speed tests (using the SpeedTest.net app) are noticeably slower on the iPhone 4S than they are on the iPad (third generation, if it matters) than they are on my MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, or iMac.\nIs this just the app not reporting the speeds correctly, or are there physical limitations to just how quickly data can be transferred?\nI'm more computer literate than most, but the exact science of these things eludes me.\nThank you!\n\nA: iPhone 4S has a smaller antenna and slower processor (A5 vs. A5X) than iPad 3rd generation. More importantly, the iPhone 4S wi-fi is (802.11 b/g/n) 2.4 GHz only, while the third generation iPad has two channels — 802.11a/b/g/n Wi-Fi (802.11n 2.4GHz and 5GHz.)\nI don't think the iPad uses both channels at once, but I think if the second channel is more clear or faster to your router, it would not be surprising the iPad gets faster speeds over Wi-Fi. I think a faster processor alone would allow for faster Wi-Fi speeds.\nSimilarly, the faster CPUs in MacBooks and iMacs would allow for faster Wi-Fi speeds, even if the networking architecture is the same. (I suspect it isn't, and that there are larger antennas in Macs than iPads, which is another factor…)\n\nA: Change your DNS on your iphone to Open Google. Does wonders. Japnese ISP s are nit good for iphone wifi (but excellent for Mac Wifi. http://osxdaily.com/2012/09/27/iphone-5-wifi-problem-fix/  Is old BUT STILL VALID! The reason is compatibility problems between Japanese ISPs and iphone\nHas nothing to do with antennae etc. it has solely to do with DNS. Or the way Japanese routers OR DNS interact with iphone. I guess their engineers are NOT UP TO SPEED\n", "Q: Is defragmenting an SSD drive a bad idea? I have heard that defragmenting SSD drives will shorten the life span of a drive. Just wondering if there is any truth to this and if so could someone elaborate as to why this happens.\n\nA: Your best bet is to not \"defragment\" SSD storage.\nEventually, SSD will lose capacity slowly and gracefully as the controller can’t write the data correctly to exhausted cells, but the repair data from 2011 through 2018 shows that Apple SSD are orders of magnitude more reliable and have longer life than HDD storage currently or in the past could achieve. \n\n\n*\n\n*What happens at the user/OS level when an SSD finally wears out?\nThe life span of the drive is a function of how the controller decides to write data and how much of the capacity is held in reserve to hide small errors over time. An SSD in general will wear out due to write exhaustion before a hard drive will as the magnetic media can withstand several orders of magnitude more writes than SSD memory cells. So the life span is basically set, and defragmentation means more writes than are needed and may in practice increase the chance your storage will degrade before something else causes you to stop using it, Granted, most people are not going to wear out their SSD - especially when you consider the warranties for OEM parts are often longer than one year / three years in the case of AppleCare - but reducing things that can cause thousands (or millions) of unnecessary erase and re-write operations is prudent advice.\nBut it gets worse for defragmentation than simply adding wear to the memory.\nSince an SSD has no moving parts, retrieving a block of data has no penalty due to one block being stored on one chip versus another. The distance electrically to all the data is basically a constant. This is not true for a traditional magnetic drive with spinning platters and a movable read head.\nOn a spinning drive, the distance between two blocks is affected by head armature movement, rotational timing and cache status. Retrieval time is not at all constant, so \"fragmentation\" has a performance impact on traditional hard drives due to the mechanical nature of the storage.\nFurthermore, SSD controllers selectively manage storage so defragmentation is not only unlikely to speed things up, might actually act counter to the normal storage prediction algorithms, and slow down access since the controller decides where to store data using the extra overhead. Since the device cannot erase just a block of storage, when you \"delete\" something on SSD, it often is just marked free and will not get actually erased until all of the data next to it is marked as free or the drive runs low on space and triggers a clean up on it's own.\nLetting the SSD manage it's fragmentation works better than trying to have the OS micromanage storage that doesn't match traditional hard drive storage mechanics.\n", "Q: Set Spotify as the source for song titles instead of iTunes A lot of applications say something to the effect of \"get the current song title from iTunes for your status\", so is there any way to have those pull from Spotify instead of iTunes?\nI'm willing to jump through a few hoops, and I'm a software developer so I don't mind some hacks, but I would love to be able to have those apps pull from my Spotify playlist instead of iTunes (who even downloads music anymore? Savages! :p )\n\nA: What application are you interested in exactly?\nOne workaround could be to make Spotify scrobble to Last.fm (in preferences), and then get the song title from Last.fm. Iirc, there is a plugin for Adium that does this. Caveat: there'll be some delay in the updates when using this method.\n", "Q: Photos from iPad to iCloud? I shoot a photo in iPad. I want it will be available in iCloud. How can I do it? I cannot see the PhotoStream in iCloud.\nI can see all Pages, Numbers etc documents but not photos, I find this very confusing.\n\nA: You cannot view your Photo Stream pictures directly on iCloud.com. In order to do this you need to create a new Photo Stream from you iPad, iPhone or Mac (using iPhoto or Aperture).\nHere's a guide for doing so. In order to make it public on iCloud.com, make sure you flip the \"Public Website\" switch.\n\nA: You can't access pictures from Safari by going www.icloud.com.\nYou have to enable Photo Streaming form Settings > iCloud > Photo Stream.\nThen you will find the Photo Streaming picture under the tab Photo Stream in the Photos App.\n", "Q: No master volume in the new iPod Touch 5? I used to have an iPod Touch 3, then I upgraded to the latest iPod Touch 5 a few weeks ago. I noticed that there is no master volume. For instance, now, when I am just browsing Safari, and I change the volume, it changes the volume for \"sound effects\" (background noises from notification). But when I open a game or listen to music, and I change the volume, this is for \"games/music\". So the two volume sliders are different.\nThis is new to me, but I'm sure that some of you have experienced this before. Perhaps it even existed in the iPod Touch 4 that I skipped? Anyway, is there a way to get back the master volume method that used to exist, where one slider would control the volume for everything?\n\nA: This separation of \"sound effects\" and \"games/music\" exists in iPod Touch 4 as well. There is no way for tuning a master volume on these devices. But you can set the \"sound effects\" volume as constant (Settings - Sounds - turn off Change with buttons) and pressing volume buttons will only change the \"games/music\" volume.\n", "Q: uninstall Net-SNMP? I want to install my own Net-SNMP because the preinstalled Net-SNMP is too old. But when I install a newer Net-SNMP via Homebrew, my path doesn't use the latest Net-SNMP.\nI would think the best option is to just remove the preinstalled Net-SNMP. How do i uninstall the preinstalled Net-SNMP?\n\nA: No. The best option is to keep the old one, and find out what Homebrew set the --prefix to:\n\nBy default, make install' will install the package's files in\n  /usr/local/bin', /usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an\n  installation prefix other than/usr/local' by giving configure' the\n  option--prefix=PATH'.\n\nThat's the default for Net-SNMP There's a Perl Module involved as well, you may need to set INSTALL5LIB to point to your new installation. \n\nA: brew link --force --overwrite net-snmp\n\nThis will re-write all the symlinks to point to the net-snmp installed by homebrew.\n", "Q: How can I make the up arrow work in Terminal's nslookup command? When I open terminal, I'd like the up arrow go to the last command I typed within nslookup. Instead, I get a strange escape sequence.\nWhat must be done to allow me to up arrow in nslookup?\n\nA: Nslookup on OS X does not seem to use readline, so it does not support the arrow keys.\nYou can install rlwrap, which is available in MacPorts and presumably other package managers.  Then you can run \nrlwrap nslookup\n\nTo get arrow key support.\nMany thanks to this thread on the MacRumors forums.\n\nA: If you are using bash someones changed your key bindings. Look at ~/.bash_profile and see what's in there. Alternatively go to the Preferences for Terminal and select the profile you are using and then click on the Keyboard Tab. See if the cursor up is set to anything weird there. \nAs someone else mentioned the default setting in Terminal and bash is to display the last command.\n", "Q: Can I use the screen (and keyboard) of a separate laptop with a Mac Mini? At the moment, I really need a Mac to run Logic Pro, and I reckon my cheapest option is getting a Mac Mini.\nIt would be very convienent if I could use the screen (and optionally keyboard) of a current working Windows laptop with the mini.\nCan I do this?\n(Update maybe like Apple Remote Desktop on Windows?)\n\nA: There are many VNC applications that could accomplish this, and OSX has VNC support built in.\nHowever, I really think you're better off buying a monitor, mouse, and keyboard for the Mac Mini.  Get something used if necessary.  You don't need to buy them from Apple - any standard monitor, mouse, or keyboard will work fine.\n", "Q: Why isn't my external monitor's native resolution available in Display Preferences?

That didn't help. \n\nI have the monitor hitched up through a mini-display port VGA dongle.\n\nA: The problem would appear to be one that has been around for some time, at least two years according to everything I've found for example MacRumors Forum.\nSwitchResX provides a way to force a monitor into a mode that the drivers says it doesn't support.\n", "Q: Does choosing \"Reset All Settings\" on an iPhone 5 cause re-activation that requires a sim card to be present? I have a badly cut sim that was converted to Nano but it was cut slightly too small and damaged. I subsequently went to the Apple shop and they activated the device for me.\nIf I perform a \"Reset All Settings\", Will I need to reactivate the phone with a sim card, or will wifi only be enough?\n\nA: Reset all settings will not. Erase all content and settings, though, will need a SIM.\n\nA: When reseting your iPhone the device will need to activate against the Apple / Carrier servers for this to happen it needs to have a SIM present, even if it is unlocked\n", "Q: Upgrading to new iPad, how can I get old settings and apps directly to new iPad? I bought iPad 2 but it is very poor during lectures, very poor camera and storing A4 papers very imprecise. I have over 100 Apps, done all email settings and other things -- probably over 10 hours' tuning. I don't want to do it again. How can I get my settings from my old iPad to my new iPad?\nI don't have yet a Mac -computer but my friends have. My friend said that it would be easy if I had a Mac -computer so I am wondering whether only easy way is to get a Mac to get things synced fast?!\nP.s. I have also a license to Windows 7 Professional. If all I need is actually just iTunes, I could virtualize W7pro and install iTunes to get things configured. Does it work?\n\nA: If you have iOS 5 or 6 installed on your iPad, you can use the iCloud Backup functionality to transfer all your settings and apps, without the need for another computer. When you set up your new iPad, it will ask whether you want to set it up as a new iPad, or restore from an iTunes or iCloud backup.\nRestoring from an iCloud backup will restore nearly everything, with the exception of any saved Wi-Fi or other passwords, which you'll have to re-enter. Alternately, doing a backup and restore from iTunes on a Mac or PC will restore passwords if you encrypt the backup.\nApple's support site has more details in this article: iOS: Transferring information from your current iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch to a new device.\n", "Q: Getting iPads ready with paid apps and customized settings for a large amount of personnel? Suppose I would like to have over 20 iPads. Is it possible to get the same settings to them fast? One iPad would have a lot of paid apps, I am trying to find out how I can get it so that everyone is using the same apps and same iPads with the same settings -- and only email/etc personalized.\nI believe there is no sense that I shared my own iPad's backup, here. I want to make sure all people have the best tools/apps/etc in their iPads before starting to work.\nIt would be a big plus if the manager could install/upgrade new apps in iPads without other people to worry so everyone running the same apps of the same version number.\n\nA: Apple has a whole section of their support site for deploying iPads \"to the Enterprise\".

They have ported putty. You'll need to install MacPorts first, but once you've done that you can run:\n>sudo port install putty\n\nand you'll have putty available on your Mac.\n\nA: I have no experiences with this App: ZOC - I only did a quick Google on \"OS X telnet GUI\" and got a link to this product as the first hit - but it seems to do the same as PuTTY.\nThere is a 30 days trial available.\n\nZOC is a professional SSH/telnet client and terminal emulator. With its impressive list of emulations it lets you easily connect to hosts and mainframes, using communication methods like secure shell, telnet, serial cable or modem/isdn.\nIts sleek user interface has many ways of making your life easier. In its own way, ZOC is the Swiss Army Knife of terminal emulators: versatile, robust, proven.\nKey Benefits:\n\n*\n\n*Tabbed sessions with thumbnails\n\n*Customizable to meet your preferences and needs\n\n*Scripting language with over 200 commands\n\n*Compatible with Windows 7 and OS X Mountain Lion\n\n*Administrator friendly (deployment, configuration)\n\n*Now $79.99 with attractive bulk discounts\n\nKey Features:\n\n*\n\n*Emulations: VT220, xterm, Wyse, QNX, TN3270, TN5250, ...\n\n*Communication: SSH, Telnet, Modem, Serial Cable, ...\n\n*File Transfer: SCP, Zmodem, Xmodem, Ymodem, Kermit, ...\n\n*Click here to find out more about ZOC's features...\n\n\nA: Jason's answer is definitely the way to go, but I'd like to point out a feature of Terminal that may be useful.\nWithin Terminal, you can make a direct connection to a remote machine similar to the way PuTTY does, without first opening a terminal window on the local machine. Simply select Shell->New Remote Connection... (cmd-shift-K). In the window that pops up, you can add any SSH server to the right-hand column, including aliases defined in the ~/.ssh/config file.\nUsing Jason's example, you would select \"Secure Shell\" as the service on the left, and then add \"serve\" to the list of servers on the right.\nIn the future, you can open the dialog box (much like the main PuTTY window) and double-click the entry for the server you want to connect to. The only difference between this and PuTTY is that you put custom configuration settings in the ~/.ssh/config file, which I see as a huge advantage.\n\nA: You can install PuTTy on OS X with Homebrew:\nbrew install putty --with-gtk+\n\nAnd then run it from terminal as putty.\nIf you don't have Homebrew, you can install it from Terminal:\nruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\nbrew doctor\n\n\nA: PuTTY is a great Windows frontend, not to mention the need for an SSH client in the first place. On Linux, OS X, and most other UNIX-y based environments, SSH is generally purely command line, but still amazingly powerful.\nThe SSH client allows you to store an amazing amount of properties based on a given hostname, even global defaults, in the \"ssh_config\" client file. This file doesn't exist by default (per the comments on the question), but should be written at ~/.ssh/config.\nThat path equates to:\n~, your home directory, it expands on my system to /Users/jason.\n.ssh, the leading dot makes it hidden. If you're in Terminal and in your home directory, you can simply run cd .ssh and enter it.\nconfig is the file name, it is a plain text file with configuration parameters.\nI use this file to control tunnels I always use, the private key needed for the connection, the username (if it differs from my local username), etc.\nSee the manpage, either via man ssh_config on your own machine which will contain the most appropriate version, or you can view it online from OpenBSD's Site.\nSome example contents from my ssh config file are:\nControlMaster auto\nControlPath ~/.ssh/sockets/master-%r-%h-%p\nVisualHostKey yes\n\nHost serve\n    Hostname 8.8.8.8\n    User        jason\n    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n    LocalForward 5901 localhost:5901\n\nWhitespace is purely personal preference, it is not required except to separate Keys from Values.\nThe first three lines are global properties, they affect every SSH connection. The second section is a host-specific configuration.\nThe Host line specifies the host tag you will use when invoking ssh. Ex. ssh serve. When running that, it loads all the properties listed until the next Host line.\nSince serve is not necessarily a DNS name, I specify the Hostname that it should actually connect to (no, not actually mine). User is self explanatory and there just to be explicit, and the IdentityFile is the path to the Private Key file it uses to connect.\nLastly, LocalForward sets up a port forwarding rule that I send through the SSH tunnel.\nThe various syntaxes are all documented on the man page.\nThere is no mechanism for defining a plain text password. Password entry is ALWAYS interactive when setting up the SSH connection. If you want to log in automatically, set up Private Key Authentication. Storing plain text passwords is stupid, always.\nI use this to great effect. And the best part? All your SSH configurations are incredibly portable, it's just one file that you have to backup/retain, and move between system to system! Not so portable to Windows, but who really likes dealing with the registry anyway?\n\nA: You might want to consider:\nSpackle (free, SourceForge link)\nThis is a Java-based version of PuTTY, available for Mac and Linux.\n\nA: Any terminal program could work with this answer, but I recommend iTerm2.\nTo store connection info and login with a single short command (no password typing required), you could use a key-login combined with an \"alias\".\nTo use key-login on a server\nCreate an alias/shortcut\nOnce you have an ssh-key on your server and your Mac, you could login with a command such as:\nssh username@10.0.0.1\n\nUsing an alias within ~/.bash_profile you could shorten the command with an alias such as:\nalias s10=\"ssh username@10.0.0.1\"\n\nThen in iTerm2 you only need to execute a command:\ns10\n\nto log into the server at 10.0.0.1 using ssh key login.\nTo store your session log (commands you've run) iTerm2 does this automatically, but you can adjust the amount of session logs you'd like to keep within Preferences -> Default profile -> Terminal -> Scrollback buffer.  Tick the box for Unlimited scrollback if you prefer.\nYou can also store your logs indefinitely, between sessions by saving them to files.  Preferences -> Default profile -> Miscellaneous -> Automatically log session input to files in [your chosen file on drive].\n\nA: I have ported Putty to Mac as a native application bundle, so no need for macports or terminals if your not a technical user.\nMore information with screen-shots is here : http://www.wine-reviews.net/2016/08/putty-for-mac-os-x-now-available.html\nCheers,\n\nA: Yes.

Recently, my iPhone 4's headphones won't stay seated in the jack. I'll push them in firmly, and then a few seconds later (without touching the phone, the headphones, or anything else), they'll pop back out – just enough to no longer make contact, pausing audio playback.\nI first I thought it was the headphones themselves, but I've tried an older pair of iPod headphones (without the clicker), and the same thing happens, although not as badly.\nIf I fiddle enough with either pair, I can eventually get them to stay seated, but I can't tell what it is that makes them stay in on one particular attempt vs. another.\nIs there anything I can do? The jack appears to be free of any dust/lint – should I try blowing it with some compressed air? I can't imagine that it's physically damaged on the inside, but I don't know why else the plug would pop out.\n\nA: @Gerry was right: there was dust or lint in the jack that was preventing the headphones from fully seating. I couldn't see it, but I used the end of a floss pick to clean it out and that fixed it. The headphones stay in so snugly now that I can actually lift the phone by pulling on them (not that I would do that normally; I just wanted to confirm it really worked!).\nAmazing that just a little bit of dust could make all the difference. I'm just relieved that the phone itself wasn't damaged somehow since it's out of warranty.\n", "Q: backup and restore iPhoto library from OSX 10.5.8 How do I backup a complete iPhoto ('09 version 8.1.2 (424)) library with all its metadata from iPhoto of OSX 10.5.8 and then after a clean new install of the latest OSX 10.8.2 on the same machine, restore that library into the latest (then empty) iPhoto.\nIs there a simple tutorial somewhere? Are there any pitfalls I need to watch out for? It would be a real shame if the photos and/or the metadata get lost on the way.\n\nA: This is really easy*. But the version of the OS doesn't matter. it's the version of iPhoto that does.\nSo, if you have iPhoto 6 or earlier:\nGo to your Pictures Folder and find the iPhoto Library Folder there\niPhoto 08 or later:\nGo to your Pictures Folder and find the iPhoto Library icon there\nIn either case then drag the iPhoto Library from the Pictures Folder to another Disk. The Disk should be formatted Mac OS Extended (Journaled).\nOnce that's done test the back up - open it and view the Photos: To choose a Library to open: Hold down the option (or alt) key key and launch iPhoto. From the resulting menu select 'Choose Library' \nAssuming the Library is working okay that's the back up part.\nThen the restore:\nDrag the Library from the External back to the Pictures Folder. Then Hold down the option (or alt) key key and launch iPhoto. From the resulting menu select 'Choose Library' and point iPhoto at the Library in Pictures.\nDone.\n*Easy that is unless you have a referenced Library.  A Referenced Library is when iPhoto is NOT copying the files into the iPhoto Library when importing because you made a change at iPhoto -> Preferences -> Advanced. (You unchecked the option to copy files into the Library on import) The files are then stored where ever you put them and not in the Library package. In this scenario you are responsible for the File Management. \nIF you have a Referenced Library then you have a much more complex job. You'll need to convert it to a Managed one, and the do the steps above. \n\nA: iPhoto library is (at least at user level) self-contained database file.\nSo just copy it over.\nAnd second: it doesn't matter which version of OS X you have since it's not bundled with OS. It's bundled with hardware. So maybe you will not be able to install your hardware supplied version of iPhoto on new system. Maybe you'll have to buy it from App Store.\n", "Q: Use cron to screencapture on Mountain Lion I want to set cron to capture the current desktop every hour:\nscreencapture -Cd -tjpg ~/Desktop/screen-`date +\"%Y%m%d-%H%M\"`.jpg\n\nI tired this method but it seems doesn't work on Mountain Lion. I also tried Lingo but with no luck. Any ideas?\n\nA: cron behaves a bit differently than a standard prompt, which is why it's not doing what you're expecting. There are two issues with the command as is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Because it doesn't parse the PATH environment variable the same was as the shell, cron doesn't know where screencapture is. You need to specify the full path, /usr/sbin/screencapture.\n\n*As noted in the crontab(5) man page, cron treats % as a newline character:\n\nPercent-signs (%) in the command, unless escaped with backslash (\\), will be changed into newline characters, and all data after the first % will be sent to the command as standard input.\n\nSo you need to escape each % with a \\ to get your desired result.\nThis crontab entry will give you a screen capture every hour, on the hour:\n0 * * * * /usr/sbin/screencapture -Cd -tjpg ~/Desktop/screen-`date +\"\\%Y\\%m\\%d-\\%H\\%M\"`.jpg\n\nCron Error Logging\nAs an aside, if you're having issues with cron, check your system mail by running the mail command in Terminal. It's not very obvious, but by default cron sends error messages there that can provide a starting point to figuring out what's going wrong.\n", "Q: upgrade this old MacBook Pro to mountain lion? I have an \"old\" MacBook Pro with the following specs:\nModelname: MacBook Pro\nModell-Identification: MacBookPro5,4\nProcessor type: Intel Core 2 Duo\nProcessor speed: 2.53 GHz\nprocesser count: 1\ncore count: 2\nL2-Cache: 3 MB\nMemory: 4 GB\nBus speed: 1.07 GHz\nBoot-ROM-Version: MBP53.00AC.B03\nSMC-Version (System): 1.49f2\n\nIt currently runs OS X 10.5.8 and seems a bit laggy from time to time, which might (also) be due to the loads of crapware on it.\nI have a two part question now:\n\n\n*\n\n*What would be the recommended maximum OS X version I should upgrade this machine to, so that it still runs nice and smooth? Is mountain lion safe?\n\n*How do I do a clean (full wipe) install of the system, since the latest versions of OS X do not come with a bootable disc anymore?\n\n\nA: The second part is trivial, install Lion or Mountain Lion and let it upgrade everything. That will create a recovery HD where you can then reboot and erase the main volume. If you save the installer after the first download, you can avoid the download the second time.\nMy experience is that the performance of older computers is as good as or better than the old OS - especially when you are erasing things and migrating files over later (or by hand) as much support for older systems was dropped making Mountain Lion fairly streamlined and responsive.\n\nA: I think that computer could handle Mountain Lion. Lion felt like a regression as far as speed, but ML has some welcome improvements. \nIf you're trying to do this in a totally legitimate fashion, I would order a copy of Snow Leopard from Apple telesales (1-800-MY-APPLE). It should cost $20, although I have heard that you can get it for free if you explain that you are planning to upgrade to Mountain Lion. \n\nA: It's not that old.\nIn my opinion it worth SSD in it. You may even put it in place of DVD drive with an adaptor (if you don't need it). And it will be really good oooomphh for the total snappiness of that computer.\nI would recommend ML if you like to stay current or/and have iOS devices to have those iCloud features used.\nRegarding the question how to get Ml installed I would recommend just buying it from other Mac with 10.6 or newer on it.

I want to install 10.8 over 10.7 and I have read that XP cannot be installed from 10.8, but will XP/Boot Camp survive the upgrade?\n\nA: According to Apple's documentation:\n\nIf your Mac has a Boot Camp partition with Windows XP or Windows\n  Vista, you can continue to use your Boot Camp partition, but you can’t\n  upgrade to Boot Camp 4.0.\n\nSo it sounds like if you upgrade to Mountain Lion, it won't touch your Boot Camp 3.x installation; you won't get Boot Camp 4.0, but you'll be able to continue using XP.\nHowever, I think if you do a clean install of Mountain Lion, that will install Boot Camp 4.0 by default, which requires Windows 7. So you can only keep XP if you do an upgrade, not a clean install.\n\nA: It's not exactly the same setup, but I had a 2011 MacBook Air running 10.7 + Windows 7 Boot Camp, and the in-place upgrade to 10.8 didn't break anything.\n\nA: Once installed, the bootcamp partition and the OSX partition are completely separated from one another. You can do anything you want to either one (even deleting them fully) that wont affect a single thing on the other.  \n", "Q: Getting many paid apps to colleague's personal iPad easily without manually installing them through the App Store? I have about 20 apps that are are all paid apps, and I want my team-member to have them. He wants to use his own iPad, but we are tired to individually get apps from App Store. Is there some easy way like restoring from backup or something like that when I only want about 20 apps to the iPad? Suppose I need to do this for 10 people, is there any easy way that I say 'go to this site with your iPad and then you will get the apps and configured desktop for your work'?\nIf there is no easy way, the guy needs to use two iPads. We are wanting to avoid this situation and not wanting \"to force people to new devices\" but we want to make sure that everyone has the best apps before any work.\n\nA: If you want to purchase and distribute a set of apps to many users, Apple's Volume Purchase Program is probably what you want. Purchasing is done centrally, and then you can push out the apps via the Apple Configurator, or a third party management system.\n", "Q: Two Apps in iPad side-by-side i.e. sharing screen between two apps? I would like to have PDF Expert -app and UPAd -note-atking-app at the same time open where 50% screen area preserved for each. Is it possible to share the screen this way? This way studying would be more natural: I have lecture-slides open and a note-book, not all the time going to-and-fro. Is this possible and how?\n\nA: This is not possible. Only one application can use the screen at a time.\n\nA: It's not possible to split your screen, but you might try an app like notability or good notes, which allow you to read PDF's and take notes at the same time.\n", "Q: What's the difference between an iTunes Account, an iCloud Account, and an Apple ID? I just got a new iPhone 5 from work today, and good heavens!  There is 3 accounts for this thing!  My boss has the iCloud account, I'm supposed to hook up my existing iTunes account to it, and now it's asking me for this Apple ID thing...\nI thought they were all one account what happened? And what is the difference between them?\n\nA: An iCloud account, iTunes account and Apple ID are all the same thing. Apple just refers to them a bit inconsistently. You can (and typically should) have a single Apple ID for all of them, unless you specifically need to separate them out.\nAccount \"Types\"\niCloud Account\nTypically refers to the Apple ID that is used for iCloud services, such as backup and syncing documents and settings between apps. This is set in Settings → iCloud → Account.\niTunes Account\nThe Apple ID that you use to purchase downloads from the iTunes, iBooks and App Stores and what syncs your iTunes Match songs, if you use that service. It's set in Settings → iTunes & App Stores → Apple ID.\nIt's important to note that your purchases are linked to your Apple ID (although music is now DRM-free), and are not transferrable to other Apple IDs. So you should be sure to make all your app, video and music purchases on a single Apple ID to save yourself future headaches.\niMessage\nYour Apple ID is also used for iMessage. Set in Settings → Messages → Send & Receive.\nUsing Multiple Accounts\nYou can be signed in to different accounts for each of these services, which can be useful if, for example, you want to have a single family account for iTunes purchases, but keep your iCloud and iMessages separate.\nOther Information\nApple has a few support pages that are helpful for untangling all the intricacies of the Apple ID:\n\n\n*\n\n*Frequently asked questions about Apple ID\n\n*Where do I use an Apple ID?\n\n*Using your Apple ID for Apple services\n", "Q: Compiling c++ using ssh on ipad2? I've noticed there are several ssh apps on the apple store, I am trying to access my schools unix machine from this ssh connection and use this to write code and compile c++ code on my unix drive. Is this possible to do from from ipad?\n\nA: SSH is simply a protocol used to connect to a remote computer. It doesn't really restrict what you can or cannot do once you're logged in to that computer. And iOS doesn't really have any restrictions on typical SSH usage (except that you can't set up a tunnel for other apps).\nSo if you can do what you need to using SSH from your computer to your school's computer, then you should be able to do the same on the iPad with an SSH app.\nThere are several iOS SSH clients around, my favourite is Prompt; iSSH is pretty popular as well.\n", "Q: Browse another encrypted time machine backup that's on a NAS I have a Time Machine backup of my MacBook Pro pro that's encrypted and saved on a Synology DS212j NAS (OS X detected my NAS as a possible location to save my backup). Right now I'm on my MacBook Air. Is it possible to browse the MacBook Pro's encrypted backup on the NAS? All I see is a \"sparsebundle\" file. My MacBook Pro is currently being repaired so I don't have access to it.\n\nA: If OS X detects the NAS as a possible backup destination, you should be able to option-right-click (hold option while right-clicking) the Time Machine icon in the menu bar, and select \"Browse Other Backup Disks\". The AFP mount should show up there and you should be able to browse it.\nAlternately, just mount the sparsebundle. It works just like a .dmg. If double-clicking doesn't give you the option to type in the password and mount it, you can drag it into Disk Utility and mount it from there.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro: OK to update to 10.6.3? I have a MacBookPro5 with OS X software version 10.5.8  -  is it OK to update it to 10.6.1 or higher? \n\nA: Assuming by \"MacBookPro5\", you mean one with a model identifier starting with \"MacBookPro5\" (they run from 5,1 through 5,5), it's one of several models released in 2008 and 2009. They all support operating systems from Leopard (10.5.x) through the current version of Mountain Lion (10.8.2).\nIf you want to verify exactly what model you have (a good idea just in case something got mixed up or I misunderstood you), read EveryMac's identification guide.\nYou will be fine upgrading to 10.6.8 (the newest release of Snow Leopard), but if you want you can go right up to Mountain Lion.\nHowever if you haven't already, you should upgrade the RAM in your system. All of these machines support 8 GB, which is actually fairly cheap these days. 4 GB should be fine for casual usage, 2 GB is getting a bit tight, particularly if you want to run 10.8.\n", "Q: iPad PDF software to edit, merge, annotate etc well PDF documents like in desktop? Also working with Math formulae? This thread is a part of the major thread about using iPad for education purposes here.\nThis thread here made me realize that that it would be super-cool to be able to merge PDF documents and other documents in iPad.\nHelper questions\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I do it with documents of different formats?\n\n\n*Does there exist an app to merge PDF documents?\n\n\n*Possible to merge images or even Doc/Docx -documents with Math -formulae?\n\n\nA: Have you looked at PDF Merger? It can read .doc and various image formats.\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdf-merger/id453413252?mt=8\n\nA: I am trying to summarize and categorize here things.\nThere are general program such as GoodReader that are not good in small things such as searching or merging but good in reading with things such as light-adjustion. This is probably because the iPad's screen-area is limited, better to do a specific thing very well instead of many things poorly. I will list below more specific apps in iPad but many of them such as PDF Expert have iPhone version so iOS apps in that sense. Have a good reading!\n\nI think if you want to do things very well in iPad you need to follow some sort of Unix-philosophy: less is more. Limitations such as area and virtual keyboard set clear design-guidelines such as avoiding extraneous things. New features always have trade-offs -- often in hard-to-measure things such as usability and accessibility. Despite lacking some objectiveness here I will outline apps in categories below. Please, feel free to suggest better categorization. You may find this thread here useful if you are new with iPad, iOS i or Apple ecosystem.\nI. Apps prone in Reading\n\nI. Papers app with things such as reference-lookup, grading and academic preview\nII. GoodReader app with things such as Light-adjusting\nIII. Side-by-side app with cool intention but works badly, unfortunately no better alternative yet.\n\nIII. Apps prone in searching such as Content-search over all documents \n\nI. PDF Expert\n\nIt has a content-search and indexation, may create downtime in copying DropBox things elsewhere -- a lot of small files apparently. \n\n\nMore about apps with content-search here.\n\nIV. Apps with good support for formats such as mathematical formulae\n\nI. iAnnotate\n\niAnnotate is the only one currently able to read Windows proprietary formats well. Yes, I know: this is a bit painful particularly if you face this kind of files every now-and-then, you cannot yet find a killer app good in everything for iPad! For this kind of cases, iAnnotate helps you to see the math -formulae but you still need a desktop for editing or pay for Microsoft to edit the formats online.\n\n\n", "Q: Where is the MAC address of my Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter? I have a Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter for a MacBook Air and I need to assign a static IP address to it.\nI assume the MAC address is embedded in a given adapter... and by convention I would assume that the MAC address would be written somewhere on the device, but it is not.  Does the MAC address have more to do with the adapter of the MAC itself?\nIn other words if I swap adapters will the MAC address change, or will it stay the same?  What if I swap thunderbolt ports it's plugged into (for MacBook Pro Retina)?\nDoes the same logic above apply to Thunderbolt displays since they have Ethernet?\n\nA: The MAC Address is unique and a property of the actual network hardware (although it can be spoofed). So your adapter has its own MAC address, as does the the network interface in a Thunderbolt display, and the Wi-Fi in your MacBook Air.\nDifferent Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapters will have different MAC addresses, but moving one between different ports won't change it.\nYou can view the MAC address of any network interface attached to your Mac by using Network Utility, which you'll find in the Utilities folder within your Applications folder. It calls it a Hardware Address, but it's the same thing.\n\nA: If you connect the Thunderbolt-Ethernet adapter and connect an ethernet cable, the MAC address immediately appears in the Network -> Advanced -> Hardware tab.\n\nA: I looked into it further, and the MAC address from the System Information is not the MAC address that is used by the Ethernet dongle.\n\n\n*\n\n*MacHD > Applications > Utilities > Terminal.app\n\n*ifconfig -a\n\n*look for bridge0, that is the mac address of your dongle.\n\n\n\nprevious wrong answer:\nYou can also access by going to\n\n\n*\n\n*apple menu (top left) > About This Mac\n\n*Click on \"More Info...\"\n\n*Click on \"System Information\"\n\n*Under Hardware look for Ethernet Cards\n\n", "Q: Re-Enable Apple Java 6 SE from Command Line? So, I broke Java Preferences.app.  I'm on Mountain Lion. I had Java 6 SE (the Apple-distributed JDK/JRE) and Oracle's Java 7u10 preview. Trying to get a stub app to launch with Java 7, I unchecked the Java 6 SE checkboxes in Java Preferences.app. Now not only will my stub app not launch, but Java Preferences.app won't launch (it says there's no valid JRE 1.4+ available).  I understand this is probably because Apple's Java launcher stub is not compatible with 7u10 -- not sure how to manually re-enable SE 6, though.\n\nA: Two things are needed worst case (and assuming you are still on 10.6 Snow Leopard):\n\n\n*\n\n*Re-download the SE 6 and install it\n\n*Manually enable browser plug in if you care to have that functionality:\n\n\n\n ln -sf /System/Library/Java/Support/Deploy.bundle/Contents/Resources/JavaPlugin2_NPAPI.plugin \"/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin\"\n ln -sf /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Commands/javaws /usr/bin/javaws\n\n\nThere is great coverage of the how and why I came up with these steps from Rich Trouton's blog:\n\n\n*\n\n*Re-enable the Apple Java 6 plug-in for use with web browsers\n\n*Java for OS X 2012-006 and Java for Mac OS X 10.6 Update 11\nApple also has similar steps in their KB article about the move from SE 6 to 7 here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Java for OS X 2012-006: How to re-enable the Apple-provided Java SE 6 applet plug-in and Web Start functionality\n\nA: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/69670/8546 and https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/70418/8546 refer to Apple article HT5559, modified 2012-10-22: \nJava for OS X 2012-006: How to re-enable the Apple-provided Java SE 6 applet plug-in and Web Start functionality\n\nto disable Java 7 and re-enable the Apple-provided Java SE 6 plug-in\n\n\n\n*\n\n*three commands\n\n*a fourth command to re-enable Apple's Java SE 6 Web Start.\n\n", "Q: iMessage message freeze I have an iPod Touch 4G and my software is updated to iOS 6.1. I was messaging someone then suddenly it gave me an error saying the message was not sent and I had to re-try sending the message. \nAfter that my iMessage freezes if I go into that same conversation. I cannot delete that conversation because if I go back (does not freeze if my screen is not in a conversation) and press edit then delete, it reappears every 5 seconds. \nHow can I troubleshoot iMessage on iOS?\n\nA: The same exact thing is happening to me. I opened my imessage app and it's just blank white. I tried deleting from task bar, resetting, shutting off, logging out from imessage on settings, resetting wifi, but nothing seems to work. It's even updated to 6.1 and it's just frozen there.\nThe only option is to restore your device to reinstall the OS. \n\nA: Apple has been having problems with its iMessage servers today, which may be what you're running into.\nIf you're experiencing freezes, you can also try force quitting the app, by double clicking the home button (when you're not using Messages), holding down the iMessage icon in the switcher bar at the bottom until the icons start jiggling, then tap the red and white minus sign on the Messages icon. Then try reopening it.\n\nA: My favorite way to troubleshoot Messages (or any other iCloud issue) is to disable all networking (AirPlane Mode or similar on computers) and to shut down the device.\nAt that point, I can power up the software and go about the cleaning and know if there are problems, it's due to the specific data that is on the device and not some issue communicating to the cloud.\nWhile the device is rebooting, check the system status for any service outages: http://apple.com/support/systemstatus\nOnce it reboots, start an organized troubleshooting process: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204065\n", "Q: How can I remove the Mac recovery partition from an external drive? My early 2011 MBP came with a 500 GB HDD, which I recently changed out for a 128 GB SSD. The old internal drive now serves as a backup drive... however... I'd love to get rid of that Recovery HD partition so that I can A) use the space, and B) stop being asked about ejecting multiple partitions when I eject the drive.\nYes, I've seen this question which is almost a duplicate, except my situation is a little different and I don't want to break anything!\nSome output from my terminal:\nMacbook-Pro:~ matt$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *128.0 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         127.2 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n/dev/disk1\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                  Apple_HFS OS X                   *126.8 GB   disk1\n/dev/disk2\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk2\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk2s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         499.2 GB   disk2s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk2s3\n/dev/disk3\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                  Apple_HFS Backup                 *498.9 GB   disk3\nMacbook-Pro:~ matt$ \n\n... and I'm confused, because I only have my internal, 128 GB SSD and my external, 500 GB HDD connected at the time I ran this. My question is two-fold:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why are there 4 disks showing up in diskutil list? I only have the two physical drives connected... what do the * characters mean? Ultimately, which disk should I be re-partitioning?\n\n*How can I safely remove the recovery partition on my now-backup-only drive? Of course I want to keep the one on my 128 GB drive, so obviously I won't mess with disk0 or disk1... I assume this will involve the same/similar steps as in the question I linked to above.\nJust wanted to be sure before I did anything potentially destructive... cheers for your advice.\n\nA: Your disk1 and disk3 are the virtual disks created by CoreStorage, that is, the system underlying FileVault 2 (full disk encryption). This is why your data partitions on the \"real\" disks (disk0 and disk2) have type Apple_CoreStorage.\nThe recovery partition on your external drive is this one:\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk2s3\n\nDeleting it may however not be a good idea. Because CoreStorage drives are encrypted, the bootloader can't read any data from them - the OSX kernel (with the CoreStorage driver) needs to be loaded to ask for the user password, which opens up the main drive containing the rest of the operating system and data. So with CoreStorage enabled, the Recovery HD partition doubles as an unencrypted boot helper.\nI don't have much experience with CoreStorage, and you haven't made it completely clear what your backup disk contains. I know that unencrypted Time Machine disks are bootable. I would imagine that encrypted ones are, too, with the caveat of requiring a boot helper, but I don't know for sure. Furthermore, since you only mention \"backups\", maybe you're using a different backup system which may or may not be bootable.\nIf your backups are not intended to be bootable, I think you should be able to delete the Recovery HD, although there is a certain risk that CoreStorage relies on it nevertheless. If they are bootable, deleting it outright will make them fail to boot. You could try writing the partition parameters displayed by gpt show disk2, deleting the partition using gpt without overwriting it, rebooting, and checking that it still works, and recreating it with the exact parameters (again using gpt, not diskutil) if you have trouble accessing your backups.\nHowever, boot helpers don't actually need to contain a full recovery system. Prior to OSX Lion, boot helpers (e.g. used for software RAID) were always 128MiB in size, and this is still enough for Lion and Mountain Lion. Still, recreating a deleted boot helper isn't exactly straightforward.\nThen there's the question of what you'll do with the extra ~520MB you gained. I don't think you can resize core storage partitions, so all you'll be able to do is create a ~400MB additional partition, which isn't terribly useful.\nOverall, I'd say it's not worth the risk/trouble to gain ~500MB.\n", "Q: Is there an official direction for scroll zoom? I am using a Magic Mouse on Lion and I have scroll direction set to natural.\n\n\n*\n\n*Google Maps: Scroll Up zooms out\n\n*Excel: Ctrl + Alt + Scroll Up zooms out\n\n*OSX Zoom Dekstop: Ctrl + Scroll Up zooms in\n\n\nI find the inconsistency annoying.\nThus, I'm wondering whether Apple has an official usability rule regarding what direction constitutes the recommended scroll direction for zoom in?\n\nA: If natural scrolling is disabled, scrolling up zooms in in all of those three cases. Scrolling up zooms in the screen even if natural scrolling is enabled though.\nScrolling while holding control could be considered to be a separate gesture where enabling natural scrolling does not invert the scrolling direction. When using a multi-touch surface, I think it's more natural that dragging up increases the zoom level.\n\nIt's also possible that applications shouldn't invert the scrolling direction when scrolling is used for zooming, but many applications do. But I didn't find anything about it in the HIG, and I don't know any applications by Apple where scrolling while holding option or command would have a special meaning.\n", "Q: Is there an iOS Camera App that shoots a photo every minute?

Is there room in a Mac Pro for an IDE optical drive, plus an IDE-SATA adapter so it can be plugged in?\n\nA: Short answer:\nAs long as you have only one optical drive installed in your MacPro, you have a full 5.25\" bay either under or above it available to stuff something into.

Specifically I want to know when the sensor trips and forces the hard drive's head to park, and when it senses the danger is clear and allows the head to move again. In an ideal case a Growl notification would be fantastic, but even a log would suffice.\nI ask because as Apple notes on their support page, the SMS can be tripped in certain environments such as nightclubs when it would be undesirable. However the only way to know if you are in such an environment is by guessing since I haven't found a way to tell the frequency or length of time the SMS actually causes head parks. I understand the simple thing to do is disable the sensor outright, but the point of the question is how to gain visibility into the actual activity of the sensor.\n\nA: The Sudden Motion Sensor state is available through IOKit.\nAn open source library, SMSLib, provides an Objective-C interface and sample command line tool for accessing the state of the Sudden Motion Sensor:\n\nSMSLib is the software library used by SeisMac and SeisMaCalibrate to access the Sudden Motion Sensors in recent Macintosh laptops.

I tried many things; Editing the sorting fields, deleting and re-adding, downloading the #39 again, but none of the methods worked.\nHow do I non-destructively combine the three folders into one?\n(On the disk, the podcasts are in the same folder)\nIf it matters, I use the Podcasts app on my iPod touch.\n\nA: Maybe the podcast moved to a different URL. A program like MP3Tag can show and edit extended properties (looks something like PodcastURL). Check the splinter episode and check its URL. Check an older episode. If it has changed, select all older episodes and edit the field. Click OK. Go to iTunes and Get Info for all of those episodes. When it reads the new URL, it should stick them all back together.\nRedownloading the older episodes, if available, will accomplish the same thing. (They'll be downloaded from the new URL. But the tag edit is quicker and easier.\n\nA: Itunes did this to me every time the podcasturl changed.  Here's how to fix it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy all of the episodes from iTunes to a temporary processing folder.\n\n*Delete the files and their podcast listings from iTunes.\n\n*Inspect the old iTunes folder(s) -- EG: ...\\iTunes Media\\Podcasts\\EconTalk -- for any remaining episode files.  Frequently, iTunes fails to delete these.  If any are present, delete them to avoid clutter and save space.\n\n*Using a tag tool like MP3TAG, inspect the podcasturl tag of each file.\n\n*Find the most recent value of podcasturl, that's not blank.\nEG: http://files.libertyfund.org/econtalk/EconTalk.xml\n\n*Set all of the files to have that same value.\n\n*At this time, I strongly recommend that you ensure that either the title, or the releasetime, or the track tags are set and ordered by episode, or to taste.\n\n*Add the retagged files back to iTunes. I typically do this by moving them to the Automatically Add to iTunes folder.\n\n*Done!  The episodes will reappear in iTunes, under a single listing, and be sortable by whatever method you established in step 7.\n", "Q: Assigning shortcuts to particular keyboard layouts Is there any way to assign hotkeys to switching to particular keyboard layouts directly, without having to cycle through them one by one?\nI am quite new to OS X.  On Windows (which I used before) it is possible to set keyboard shortcuts for witching directly to particular keyboard layouts.  For example, I set it up so that Shift-Alt-1 switches directly to English, Shift-Alt-2 switches directly to Hungarian, etc.  This is very convenient when one has several layouts installed (I regularly used 4 different ones on Windows), and much faster than having to cycle through layouts one by one, especially when writing multilingual documents and needing to switch often.\nIs there similar functionality in OS X?  If there's isn't by default, is there a hack or third party program to set it up?\n\nA: There is a solution that has been vetted on 10.5 through 10.7 and has both a source code example as well as a link to a direct download of a program to do this sort of switching.\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/4032238\nYou'll need Xcode or to use the compiled program to test if this works for you. And always, use caution when downloading software from the internet. Most people are nice and good, but sometimes it's hard to know what you're running.\n\nA: Command Line Utility + System Service\nThis is a two-part solution: first a means of changing the keyboard layout, and then a means to activate that by a keyboard shortcut. But it's fairly easily accomplished.\n1. Changing the Layout\nTo change the layout programmatically, there's a handy (and free) little utility called changeInput, which you can download here.\nDownload and unzip it, and place the changeInput executable somewhere. Be sure to note the path for the second section.\n2. Creating Keyboard Shortcuts\nThere several ways to do this, but to make things accessible for anyone, we'll do it with built-in tools by making a System Service with Automator.\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator, and select Service as the document type.\n\n*Change the drop-down menus in the upper right so that it reads Service recieves no input in any application.\n\n*Add the Run Shell Script action to the workflow by double-clicking it or dragging it to the right pane.\n\n*In the text field, enter /path/to/changeInput \"Name of Layout Here\". Be sure to enter the exact path to changeInput as you saved it (tip: you can drag the executable right into the text field to get the proper path). Replace \"Name of Layout Here\" with the exact text that's displayed in the Input Sources section of System Preferences or the Input Menu — be sure to keep the quotes.\n\n*Save your service. It will prompt you for a name, make sure to note it for step 7 (something descriptive is best). The service file gets saved to ~/Library/Services/.\n\n*Open the Keyboard panel of System Preferences. Click the Keyboard Shortcuts tab, and select the Services item in the left pane.\n\n*Scroll through the list until you find the name of the service as you saved it in step 5 (it should be in the General section, near the bottom. Make sure the box is checked, then select it and click add shortcut, and set whatever shortcut you desire.\n\n*Repeat steps 1-7 for each layout you want a shortcut for.\n\n*Test out your shortcuts. You may need to open the services menu once (click the application menu for the current app and reveal the Services menu) before the shortcuts get activated.\n\nAs an alternative to using the Automator/Services combo to create the keyboard shortcuts, you can use FastScripts, the free version of which allows you to quickly set keyboard shortcuts for 10 scripts, or $14.95 for an unlimited number. Keyboard Maestro can also easily run a script with a keyboard shortcut, but it's a bit overkill if this is your only need (it is worth checking out for lots of other scripty/powerusery type things).\n", "Q: Mac OS X Terminal: Commands not found I really don't have much experience with Terminal and I believe I may have caused a problem when trying to download and use wine on my Mac. If I try to type in anything I simply get \"Command not found\". After reading many forum posts I believe this has something to do with my PATH, but again, I don't really know exactly what that means.\n\nA: Looking at the link and also your path it looks like you have installed Macports. Its installer will change in ~/.profile the path but not in the way you show. See macports document for the correct way to do this.\nEditing /etc/profile is not the correct way as it affects all users and is also more complex to deal with as requires root permission and is also an Apple supplied file that could be changed in Apple system upgrades\nThis explains two of your /opt/local/bin ... etc in your path (/etc/profile and ~/.profile) More and the PATHnexport imply that yor editing of files has gone wrong.\nI would restore /etc/profile from a backup to be as Apple set it up, and check that .profile has the lines as per the macports document. Also check to see if you have ~/.bash_profile or ~/.login and check they do not have any alterations to the PATH\nIf you are not used to Terminal (e.g. if you do not understand what these .profile files are) then it mght be better to install wine via a GUI method e.g. Wineskin or Crossover (Even if you do understand Terminal and shells t is easier to use these)\n", "Q: Change Finder window graphics back to the more visible Snow Leopard ones? When Apple moved from Snow Leopard to Lion, all the Finder window graphics became much duller.

Is there a way to make difference between the button states of enabled and disabled much more visible?  \nThe ones of particular interest are the Forward/Back ones in Finder windows.\n\nA: Short answer: Install Snow Leopard.\nLong answer: The only way I can think of is a pain.\nThe images used in Finder's UI are stored in the Resources directory of the application package.\nNavigate to /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder/Contents/Resources/\nYou can find the offending graphics that don't suit your taste and edit them directly.\nAfter modifications restart Finder using the following command in a Terminal window:\nkillall Finder\n\n", "Q: What types of WiFi does the iPod touch 4th generation use? I am buying a router.  But it says 2.4 GHz is that not that great.  So I want to know if it supports.

You'll get some output like this:\n{\n    \"Other Shortcut\" = \"@\\\\U2190\";\n    \"Export Text As...\" = nil;\n    \"Print...\" = nil;\n}\n\nRemove the lines you want to reset (Export and Print), then copy the remaining output as-is; make sure to include the curly brackets. Then type (but don't yet run) defaults write BUNDLE_ID NSUserKeyEquivalents '. Paste your modified text after that (be sure you included the single quote before pasting), then close the single quote (') and run the command. Once you restart the app, the default shortcuts should be restored, while keeping any existing ones.\n\nA: You could try out Keymando which will let you set specific shortcuts for programs. In this case, you would set those commands to do nothing.\nAnother solution would be to use iTerm 2, which allows you to specify shortcuts for keys (or to ignore).\n", "Q: How to install Mac OS X from Windows on MacBook Air?

I've used it to create a wireless network, and I also connect my Mac Pro (Early 2009, running 10.8.2) via ethernet. When I run a speed test on my iPhone (to test the wireless speed), I get an upload speed of 1.45 Mbps (not super fast, but I only pay for 1 Mbps so I'll take it). When I run the same test on the Mac Pro (to test the wired speed) I get only 0.13 Mbps. The AirPort Utility (v6.1) doesn't provide a lot of options, so I've been unable to resolve this. How can I fix my ethernet upload speeds?\nIn summary:\nAirPort Extreme\nWireless Upload: 1.45 Mbps\nWired Upload: 0.13 Mbps\n\nA: I fixed this by playing around with my network settings.

I have been using this SL install for about 10 months, and the desktop is barely usable for 3-5 minutes after Finder appears.\nI've pruned my LoginItems down to the minimum (which is still a lot...) but I'm betting there's some cruft elsewhere that I can trim.\nGoogling the issue reveals tons of moronic clean-up-your-mac for idiots guides. Can someone provide a more technical synopsis of OSX' startup process? What are some other optimizations I can perform to speed up startup? Is there a way I can delay startup processes over a larger interval to minimize hard-drive thrashing?\nMy goal is to have a a usable session within 10-20 seconds of Finder/Launcher appearing. I really don't want to reformat just to get performance back.\nThank you!\nTom\n\nA: First thing I would do is isolate the problem to either your user account or your OS install. To this end, just create a new user and try logging in as that user after a fresh boot. If the system is sluggish also under this account, at least part of the issue must be outside your main user account.\nFrom the \"moronic clean-up-your-mac for idiots guides\", I suppose, you have already learnt about LaunchAgents and LaunchDaemons, both for individual users in ~/Library/LaunchAgents, and for the entire system, in /Library/Launch{Agents,Daemons} and cleaned those out?\nBear in mind that applications are really trying to be helpful in adding those back whenever you launch them.\nAs an alternative to purging the files, you could try disabling them via launchctl unload -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.example.launchdaemeon in Terminal, because this adds them to a launchd blacklist that applications will have a harder time to override. From man launchctl:\n unload [-w] [-S sessiontype] [-D domain] paths ...\n          Unload the specified configuration files or directories of con-\n          figuration files.  This will also stop the job if it is running.\n\n          -w       Overrides the Disabled key and sets it to true. In pre-\n                   vious versions, this option would modify the configura-\n                   tion file. Now the state of the Disabled key is stored\n                   elsewhere on-disk.\n\nFinally, some really archane applications add their daemons to /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist.

Is it possible to stop the iPhone from retrieving old emails from my mail account? I have about 5000 messages in my Gmail inbox and would like to keep them there. Currently, my iPhone fetches about 50 at a time and displays them in my inbox. \nIs there a way to setup iPhone mail to fetch only future emails, or a workaround?\n\nA: If you have setup your Gmail using Google Sync (as an Exchange account) then it is doable. If you'd like to do this follow these instructions: \nSet up Google Sync with your iOS device\nThere are other benefits to this such as Exchange-like calendar pushing and proper push support for mail.\nThen, go to the Settings app and under Mail, Contacts, Calendars select the account you want to limit the retrieval of mail for.\nUnderneath the sliders that enable the components of the account (e.g. contacts, calendars or mail) you will have the following option\n\n\n*\n\n*Mail Days to Sync\n\n*Mail Folders to Push\n\n\nThe first of these is what you want. If set to 2 weeks then only the last 2 weeks of mail is synced with your phone.\nI prefer however to have No Limit with this option and choose to limit which folders get synced (with the second option).

I have a piece of software that formats source material and produces PDF files.  These resulting files may be any length and are broken into pages according to a selected page size.  (In other words, very standard paged output.)\nSince these files are not intended for printing, what I would like is to have them converted to take up one page only with a length that matches the total length of the content.\nDoes anyone know of a method for reformatting PDF this way on a Mac, or of an \"editor\" that can perform this one function?\nAlternatively, if there's a program that can convert a PostScript file into a single-page PDF by calculating the necessary page size, that would work too.\n\nA: \nAlternatively, if there's a program that can convert a PostScript file into a single-page PDF by calculating the necessary page size, that would work for me too.\n\nAny PostScript to PDF converter would convert a valid one-page postscript file into a one-page PDF file. You can for example use OS X’s own pstopdf or Ghostscript’s ps2pdf script. If you need to tighten the bounding box, pdfcrop will do the trick.\n\nA: In your case, being on Snow Leopard, you will want to check for support of that OS. I use PDFPen personally (and professionally) since it's quite powerful and does much more than just edit. They support 10.6, 10.7 and 10.8 on the current version and also can support 10.4 and 10.5 on an earlier version of their product.\nHere are some other lists of PDF editors in case no one else has one they recommend on 10.6.\n\n\n*\n\n*What software is available (preferably free) to edit PDF files on Mac OS X?\n\n*What tools allow for creation and editing of a PDF document on OS X?\nAlso, Adobe's Acrobat Pro software is the heavyweight tool for all manner of creation, manipulation, optimization of PDF documents, but it is also priced accordingly.\n\nA: It sounds like what you want is to have your PDF docs displayed in a continuous flow on screen with no \"page breaks\" regardless of length, yes? I don't know of commercial software that can remove the \"page breaks\" from the onscreen view of a PDF, so my next question is, do you do any programming? In my preferred language, Perl, there are several open source modules dealing with PDFs, and I'm sure most other serious languages have similar capabilities. \nI've written several applications whose output is PDF docs (stuff like mailing labels, formatted contact lists, lapel stickers, name tags). From what I have learned about PDF document creation, it's necessary to specify dimensions for the \"page\" in order to give structure to the number of lines and other layout features, not the least because locations are measured from the BOTTOM left corner of the page, NOT the upper left as is most familiar in page composition software. So I think F'x's comment above has a good hint, which is that if you can dig in there, changing the height of the \"page\"/bounding box might be a way to get a continuously scrolling PDF instead of one with onscreen space-wasting pagination. Perhaps F'x or someone else knowledgeable could expand on this.\n", "Q: Undoing calendar sync between iPhone and Outlook I was trying to save the calendar data on my iPhone to my Outlook calendar.

After all, the Windows Run prompt is just a single line command prompt.\nIt can be a bit daunting, but you can just learn bit by bit, and after a while you'll be able to do some pretty powerful things.\nTo get started, open up Terminal (found in /Applications/Utilities).\nHere are a few basic commands that you'll find useful:\n\n\n*\n\n*open opens whatever path it's followed by. Some examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*open /Applications/ opens the Applications folder in Finder.\n\n*open ~ opens your home folder. ~ is shorthand for your home folder (i.e. /Users/you.\n\n*open ~/Documents/myfile.txt opens myfile.txt in your Documents folder in whatever application is set to open that file.\n\n*You can use open to open a file in a specific app with the -a flag. open -a TextEdit website.html would open that file in TextEdit, and open -a Safari website.html would open the same file in Safari.\n\n\n*\n\n*open -a followed by an application, with no file or path specified will activate that application.\n\n\n\n*ls lists the contents of the current directory, or any other directory you specify.\n\n\n*\n\n*By default, your current directory is ~, so if you specify a file without a path, the command line looks for it in your current path. But you can specify a full path to address any file in your filesystem.\n\n\n*cd changes your current directory. E.g. cd ~/Documents moves you to your Documents folder, and cd /Applications moves you to the applications folder.\n\n*Bonus: say \"I know now why you cry, but it's something I can never do\"\nThat's just a small fraction of what you can do with the command line, but perhaps it will whet your appetite. If you want to learn more, there are tons of resources out there for learning the command line — OS X's command line is very similar to BSD and Linux, so many resources applying to those will be helpful.

They have announced a number of different CPU options for the late 2012 mac mini.  I'm interested in the 2.6 Ghz Quad-Core i7.  Should I assume that's the i7-3720QM processor? Is there an official document that I missed that details this.\n\nA: There's no public Apple document that has this info. But, with a little bit of info from Intels' CPU specs site, you can assume that's the one.\nThere are sites which show you that info also (to see if your assumption was good):\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Mini#Specifications_3\nhttp://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_mini/index-macmini.html\nAccording to the EveryMac site, the 2012 Mac Mini use the following chips:\n\n\n*\n\n*2.5 GHz Core i5 (I5-3210M)\n\n*2.3 GHz Core i7 (I7-3615QM)\n\n*2.6 GHz Core i7 (I7-3720QM)\n\n", "Q: MacBook 5,1 (unibody) getting kernel panics if memory bank 0 is populated Any configuration of ram that uses bank 0 on my MacBook causes a kernel panic after about an hour of use.\n\n\n*\n\n*The slot looks fine: all the pins are there, and are straight (no visible bends or breaks)\n\n*it's not a RAM problem; I've tried four different modules in total, all of them leading to the same results.\n\n*My EFI/SMC is up to date\n\n*PRAM and SMC resets don't help\n\n*OS X reinstallation doesn't help\n\n\nHow should I proceed to troubleshoot/fix this?\n\nA: You've covered pretty much all the troubleshooting bases. If it's not a problem with the RAM itself, and it's not a problem with the firmware or software, it's almost certainly a hardware problem.\nYou could try running the Apple Hardware Test, but it's almost certainly a problem with the memory controller, which as far as I'm aware means a new logic board. Take it to an Apple Store or Authorized Service Provider.\n\nA: I know a friend who had a similar problem. He had a 7/8 year old MacBook with 10.4 installed from factory that had two memory slots, but one of them had never been used up until very recently when he bought a second memory card. However, when he inserted the new memory card into the second slot, the computer would have a kernel panic more often than not. It turned out in the end that that specific slot had been built damaged, and since it had never been used, the time for warranty passed without any problem. He was told to, basically, buy a new computer because buying a new motherboard for such a relic was not worthwile. This seems like it is your problem...\nMoral of the story: always test all your memory slots short after buying a new computer. It might save you from some serious trouble.\n", "Q: iMac OS X 10.6.8, didn't come with any disks...how do I create an install disk I want to do a dual boot with Windows 7 (the eventual goal being Windows 8 but to upgrade I think I need to have a version of Windows on my Mac already).  I meet all of the system requirements and I have the Windows 7 disk.  But it says I also need to have a Mac OS X 10.6 installation disc - which I do not have - it didn't come with the iMac.  How can I precede with installing Windows?\n\nA: You can use software like Parallels or VMWare Fusion to run Windows alongisde/inside OSX. Those options won't require you to have an OSX install disk. They do require you buy that software and have a liscence for Windows 7. \nNot dual boot, but I find it more useful.\nIf you need an OSX 10.6 install disk, Craig's List and EBay have them. It might be easier to just update to 10.7 or 10.8 (if you computer supports it) and use a USB drive to create a Lion/Mountain Lion installer using Lion Disk Maker: http://blog.gete.net/lion-diskmaker-us/\n\nA: You don't need an OSX setup disk to install bootcamp. you'll need either a W7 DVD or iso to put into a USB (if using an air or newer MBP). \nI have W8 in my MBPr (typing from there right now). \nThis is what i did: \n\n\n*\n\n*Started Bootcamp assistant\n\n*Downloaded Windows Support tools (to get newer drivers for Retina MBP)\n\n*Create w7 USB from iso (already had it from previous MBP 17\" install)\n\n*installed W7\n\n*Installed all drivers from Windows Support\n\n*Bought W8 upgrade key\n\n*Downloaded W8 upgrade and put it into USB (all from W8 setup tool)\n\n*Upgraded to W8 \n\n*Fixed a problem with the trackpad not working (had to revert to a usb mouse)\n\n\nThe ideal setup for me is to have a working Bootcamp partition that i can access with VMware Fusion (i believe newer parallels can also access and run bootcamp as VMs) from OSX if i need to.

Back in the summer I bought an external hard drive for my MacBook Pro because I make videos on YouTube and they obviously take up a lot of space on my computer. The first couple of times I plugged the new drive in, moved the videos/files to it and deleted them from my computer I got a tonne of storage space back (as of course was expected).\nBut recently, when I went to move more videos to clear up space, I didn’t get the amount of space I expected back. In fact, the space I got back from deleting movies went into the “backup” part of my storage and the same goes for random files. Why is this happening? I don’t use Time Machine or anything. How can I prevent this from happening because it’s driving me nuts and limiting my current movie imports.\n\nA: You might need to disable local time machine backups by the sound of it.\n sudo tmutil disablelocal\n\nOr you can just ignore that space that's allocated as backups and once the drive fills to 80%, the system automatically prunes old backups. \n\nA: Open System Preferences, under the Apple Menu, and the Time Machine preference pane. \nTurn it to Off.\n", "Q: Restart needed to reconnect Thunderbolt Display? I was just reading the Apple Thunderbolt Wiki and stumbled upon this:\n\n25) If I eject a Thunderbolt device using the Taskbar tool or disconnect the Thunderbolt cable, can I reconnect it again without\n  restarting?\nNo. A directly-connected Thunderbolt device that is removed with the\n  Taskbar tool or by disconnecting the Thunderbolt cable will not be\n  recognized until you restart the computer.\n\nIs that really true? Does that mean I would have to restart my macbook, if I was connected in the morning, unplugged it, put it to sleep, then went to the office and wanted to work on afterwards?\n\nA: That only applies to using the Thunderbolt device under Windows 7. It's not the case when you're using OS X — you should be able to plug and unplug at will, without needing to restart.\nIt's not clear from that quote, but if you note, the index of Apple's Thunderbolt FAQ (from which this nugget came), items 21 through 27 relate only to using Thunderbolt devices under Boot Camp and Windows 7.\n", "Q: Is there a way for registering iWork apps on App Store?

So I decided to stick with the old version without Ads. But unfortunately it didn't work for me in Yosemite. After some try and error I found out the workaround as follows:\nFirst, deleting _MASreceipt led to the situation that the AppStore didn't update the App any more as desired, but unfortunately with this change the App wouldn't start any more as it was supposedly corrupted.\nIn my case I found within the CodeSignature file near the end a reference towards the _MASreceipt file. So I deleted this reference including the subsequent dict /dict section of the XML structure and .... tararara   ;-)   ... it worked like a charme.\nApp starts as always and the App Store update ignores it.\nI dunno if this applies to other Apps as well, but it's worth to try.\nHave fun\nBest Woife from Germany\n\nA: After signing in to the Mac AppStore, go to the Purchased panel, right-click on the Download, Install or Installed button - any button on the right - and the choice to Hide appears.\nSee this Apple Support page for details. \nTo Hide and Unhide Purchases on the Mac App Store:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT4928\n\"Note: You will no longer receive update notifications for items after they've been hidden from your Purchases page.\"\n\nA: If the app is on your device: uninstall it by pressing and holding on any app until they all start to jiggle.

However, the \"create new or transfer app to another Apple ID\" is not available. \nThe obvious solution for app developers is to display the name of the app so that it can be deleted, IOW so that you do not need to delete all possible apps until you found the one causing the trouble.\nThe second part of the solution is to detect that a new user has been established on the machine, and therefore, ask this new user whether he/she wants to keep the existing apps, replace the Apple ID with his/hers own id, or similar.\nThese developers in Apple, how old are they?

I'm located in the US. My employer didn't setup Find My iPad. I used the iPad a few times to view web sites in Safari on my network and connect it to my computer to update it to iOS 6. I've reported the burglary to the police. I have the iPad's serial number and the device backup in iTunes. Instead of waiting around, is there anything I can do to find the stolen iPad? \n\nA: The first thing you should do is report it, having the serial number by hand (you can find it on the original box). While the procedure of handling stolen goods might be different in other countries, it's not unlikely police bumps into a batch of stolen goods and will try to get these back to the rightful owners.\nAs for tracking, if you had a Gmail account set up, you could check Gmail's connection logs (available from the bottom of the web interface), to see the IP addresses connecting. The same goes for other \"cloud\" services which allow to see a log of clients, like Dropbox.\nWhether the IP address will lead you to the thief is questionable, but it could give you a broad localisation and you can always pass this information to the police.\nIf you had an iPad with cellular support, it is technically possible to be tracked by IMEI number, but depending on legislation/others, your carrier might not fulfil these requests without the necessary warrants.\nApart from tracking though, the next thing you should consider is safeguarding your data as much as possible. If your iPad was not password-protected, you should change all passwords of any online accounts configured, but please note this might prevent you from seeing access log as described earlier.\n\nA: Well, to my knowledge the only thing that can help you find an iPad is Find My iPad. If your employer didn't set that up then it's a shame, becuase I'm afraid you can't do much more.\nIt's good that you have the serial number, though. That way you can prove the iPad is yours in case the police finds it.\n\nA: Just had mine stolen yesterday. Find my iPad is not what you think. I had it on my WiFi only model so unless the device connects to wifi, the service is useless. \nAlso, if you decide to not have a passcode lock in order to try to track down the iPad, you are leaving it open for the thief to get any personal data. Sending a remote lock or setting a passcode does secure your data, but at the same time makes it less likely you will find it. For me, I have opted for the erase mode. As soon as it is turned back in or ever hits WiFfi before it gets erased, all existing data will then be erased.\n", "Q: Problems with SD card reader on Bootcamp (MBP 15\" Late 2011) I've got a strange problem with the SD card reader on Bootcamp. It reads some of my cards fine (one 8GB, one 4GB, and one 512MB), but it has problems with some others (64GB SDXC, an identical 8GB). When I try to read a file from the 64GB one, it usually freezes the application trying to open it, or sometimes it says an unknown error occurred. If I try to write to the card, it takes forever and is almost always corrupted when reading on another computer.\nThis problem seems to be with the built-in card reader drivers for Bootcamp, because it works perfectly on the Mac side and also works perfectly when I use an external card reader in Bootcamp.\nI've got Parallels installed to use Bootcamp without restarting, I don't know if this is affecting it... I've tried uninstalling the \"Broadcom SD Host Controller\" and removing drivers and reinstalling, but nothing's changed...\nJust to be clear, I'm in Windows directly, not through Parallels...\nThings I've tried\n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstalling \"Broadcom SD Host Controller\"\n\n*Reinstalling WindowsSupport drivers\n\n*Reinstalling Windows entirely\n\n*Formatting cards as exFAT in Mac\n\n\nA: Try to isolate the problem as much as possible first. \nBoot straight into windows (not thru parallels) and test the cards to see if they work. If they don't, the problem is with the driver inside w7. If they do work then the problem might be in the way parallels shares the hardware access with W7. \nWhen using parallels to access the hardware you are not using the actual drivers as you don't have access to the actual hardware, just a parallel's emulation of the hardware and an interface to it in osx.\nIf the problem persists in W7 reinstall the windows support files as it should work (mine works with SDXC perfectly), but this WONT fix the paralles problem. \nAs I said the parallels problem is completely separated and much harder as you can't switch drivers. But try this: http://lifehacker.com/368819/access-usb-drives-in-parallels-and-your-mac-simultaneously\nie: add /Volumes as a shared folder (its where OSX mounts HD/USB/SD/DVD drives)\n\nA: Did you try all the sdcards after a full power cycle on/off/on? On many Macbook models, it's a known bug that it's not accessable after Windows goes to sleep without fully powering off.\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/8038937\nI recommend you fully reboot the laptop before trying to read the sdcard.\n", "Q: Video player on iPad that doesn't stretch to full screen I'm looking for a video player that doesn't stretch my 640x480 video files to full screen (1024x768), which degrades the quality IMHO.\nIs such an app available?\n\nA: OPLayerHD allows you to select the stretching mode, so you can select between full screen and actual ration of the video.\nThere is also a lite version, maybe you can try that one before buying the complete OPlayerHD\nAlternativelly there was AVPlayerHD, which seems to be not available now.\n\nA: How about nPlayer? It allows you to adjust the size of the video you're watching.\n\nnPlayer provides high quality video play performance and easy control-UI supporting almost all kinds of video formats and codecs without file converting efforts.\n\n", "Q: How can I make a Keynote file non-editable? I have a PowerPoint presentation that I am converting to Keynote to distribute to students; however, I do not want other users to be able to edit the presentation.\nIs there a way to make a Keynote file read-only, non-editable?\nI don’t want to convert it to PDF files as I will lose the animations, or to convert it to a video file as the students would lose the ability to read the presentation at their own pace.\n\nA: To make a Keynote presentation non-editable, you can export the slides as images and replace all the original slides with the images.\n\nA: Unfortunately this is not possible, you can only use a password to limit file open and presentation stop.\nHowever you can include a keynote presentation in an iBook by using iBooks Author.\nYou can do that by creating an iBook with a single page and using the Keynote Widget for including the presentation on your iBook.\nHowever I never tried to publish the book, and I don't know exactly how it works. Here you can find more information.\n\nA: Keynote hasn't programmed in the facility to mark a file as locked for editing but open for reading. On OS X, if you're an administrator of the machines you could use the normal file read and write permissions. It can set a password on a keynote file,  but people that can open the file can edit it. \nIf you don't have that control over all of the devices, you might not be able to accomplish this by using the native keynote format. Also, it's not even clear you can set a password from iOS and must use the OS X version of the app to even set a password in the first place.\n", "Q: How to use MacBook from my PC I have a PC with a big monitor and a 13\" MacBook sitting on my desk. I have to do some development in PC environment and also some iOS development on MacBook.\nIs there a way I could use my PC's monitor, mouse and keyboard with both PC and MacBook?\nBasically, I want to be able to switch between PC's and MacBooks's desktops at will. Something like two virtual desktops: one showing what's going on on PC and the seconds one showing what's MacBook doing. All mouse movements and keystrokes should go to currently active desktop.\nI do not want to purchase any additional hardware if possible.\nIs it possible? If so, how?\n\nA: You can install a free, open-source VNC client and server on your PC. You can then use the PC to connect to the Mac through Apple's built-in screen sharing capabilities, which can use the VNC protocol, or you can find a free VNC client for Mac OS X.\nVNC stands for \"virtual network computing\"; it is a well-established protocol for letting one computer view the screen on remote computers and use the keyboard and mouse to control them, all over a network connection.\nFor your PC, check out RealVNC.\nI haven't used this to connect between a PC and Mac in several years, but you can configure things on your Mac to permit VNC on your PC to connect to your Mac. You may have to make adjustments on your Mac to your firewall and open ports. Other people here can probably provide more details on configuration.\n\nA: As others have contributed, you could go the virtual route with a VNC or the like. You mentioned you don't want to buy any hardware, so that's probably the way to go.\nIf you find it costs too much performance (and makes your keyboard a bit unresponsive, which can be a pain while coding), I do recommend to shell out a few bucks and get a KVM switch - it lets you switch your keyboard/monitor/mouse between the Mac and PC with the flick of a button.\n\nA: This is not the best solution for sure but a workaround.\nConnect the monitor, keyboard and mouse to your MacBook and start the monitor mirroring in order to see you MacBook Desktop on the secondary monitor.\nStart the App Remote Desktop Connectiom which allows you to remote control a PC from the Mac. The PC should have enabled the remote control. You configure that from Computer properties.\n", "Q: Using OS X of a new MacBook on an \"old\" iMac I have a late 2009 27\" iMac. The iMac runs the default OS X version, 10.6.\nThis week I bought a new MacBook with OS X 10.8. Can I install the new OS X on my iMac without buying 10.8? Does the license allow this, and if it does, how do I do it? If you know how I can register OS X with my Apple ID, I can install OS X 10.8 via wifi.\n\nA: The licence the install of OS X included with a new Mac is exclusive to that Mac, you can't re-use it on another. Buying Mountain Lion from the App Store entitles you to install it on all of your personal Macs.\n", "Q: I just upgraded to Mountain Lion. Now I can't share files with the Snow Leopard on my network Before the upgrade, I could pull files from the other laptop on to mine with apple file sharing. Now I can't see any machines in the network view. How can I pull files from the Snow Leopard laptop onto my Mountain Lion laptop?\nSteps I've taken:\n\n\n*\n\n*Files were put into the snow leopard's shared folder\n\n*On the mountain lion laptop, opened Finder and looked in Network. There are no computers listed.\n\n\nA: Some troubleshooting steps to take:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Sharing Preferences on the Snow Leopard Mac, and make sure that File Sharing is checked. Then click Options…* and make sure Share Files and Folders using AFP is checked.\n\n*On the Mountain Lion Mac, open Finder and click Go → Connect to Server… (or press ⌘K). In the server address box, enter afp:// followed by the IP address of the Snow Leopard Mac, then click Connect.\n\n*\n\n*If you don't know the IP, you can find it by using Network Utility on the Snow Leopard Mac.\n\n\n*If that still doesn't work, open Terminal on the Mountain Lion Mac, and enter ping followed by a space and the IP of the Snow Leopard Mac.\n\n\n*\n\n*If successful, you should see output like this:\n64 bytes from 192.168.1.10: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.249 ms\n64 bytes from 192.168.1.10: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.207 ms\n\nIn which case, there's something wrong with the file sharing set up.\n\n*If it's not successful, you'll likely get Request timeout errors, and it's a network issue.\n\n\n\nTry those steps and post the results, and I'll update my answer with some more suggestions.\n", "Q: Boot Camp drivers don't always load (for Windows 7)? Recently, I backed up my Windows 7 Boot Camp partition with Carbon Copy Cleaner before realizing that it would not be a bootable backup. Well, after some fiddling around, I made it bootable again (with the help of iPartition) and it generally works well.\nHowever, for some reason, sometimes when I boot into Windows 7, it appears that some drivers don't work properly about half the time. For instance, if I load a game, the game will not be full screen and will instead be the exact dimensions that is specified (my display is 1920 x 1080; if the game is set to 1280 x 720, then it won't stretch to full screen but instead appear at that size). As I said, this happens about half the time.\nAlso, I use MacDrive so I can write to Mac partitions, and when these display problems occur, then MacDrive will also show an error saying that it needs to be repaired.\nAll of this can be fixed with a restart, but after restarting, my two displays will be duplicated instead of extended.\nIt appears that the display drivers (and perhaps a few things, related to MacDrive) don't seem to be loading properly at all times? For some reason, I can seem to fix this if, when in Mac, I quit all applications first before booting up Boot Camp. I don't know how they could be related, but it so far seems that way.\n\nA: Whatever you do in OSX is completely unrelated in how W7/8 behaves. Unless one of the apps you are using is VMware Fusion (dont know if Parallels can do this too) to access the bootcamp partition as a VM. \nI would highly reccommend reinstalling the WindowsSupport files created from the Bootcamp Assistant to see if that fixes the problem. \n", "Q: Time Machine Error - The backup disk is not available Problem\nMy automatic backups for my Macs have recently started failing with the following message (same error if I attempt to \"Backup Now\"):\nTime Machine couldn't complete the backup to \"DeviceName\".\nThe backup disk is not available.\n\nEvery other attempt or so I also get a warning that it was a while ago that a backup succeeded. If I open Time Machine Preferences there is a red icon with an exclamation mark next to the backup disk which if clicked produces the following message:\nTime Machine Error\nThe backup disk is not available.\nLatest successful backup: <date>\n\nI just tried to re-select the backup disk from Time Machine Preferences > Select Disk, which worked without problem, but now Time Machine seems to have forgotten all my previous backups (I can still find the backups on disk using Finder, but Time Machine claims that I have no previous backups).\nQuestions\n\n\n*\n\n*Now that I have reselected the backup disk, how do I get Time\nMachine to find the existing backups? \n\n*Is there another way to get Time Machine to find the backup disk?\n\n\nSetup: One Macbook Air, one Macbook Pro, one Netgear ReadyNAS Duo claiming to be a TimeCapsule. Both Macs use Mountain Lion.\n\nA: I've now gotten Time Machine to see the older backups. Not sure if the first step is necessary as I noted that Time Machine Preferences took a while to update the \"Latest backup\" date, so it might have been enough to just perform a backup.\nStep 1 - Verify the backups\n\n\n*\n\n*Following a guide on a similar topic I deleted the\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.MachineID.plist file (on my ReadyNAS this was\nlocated under /c/.timemachine/MachineName.sparsebundle/)\n\n*Have Time Machine verify your backups by having the alt-key pressed while clicking the Time Machine icon and choosing Verify Backups\n\n\nAt this stage Time Machine Preferences still states that I have no backups, but by choosing Enter Time Machine I can see the earlier backups.\nStep 2 - Take a new backup\nAfter this was done, Time Machine Preferences update both the Latest Backup date and Oldest Backup date to correct values.\n\nA: I have a Time Capsule, and had a lot of trouble with backups failing with an error \"Backup Disk not Available\". Rebooting the Time Capsule fixed the problem but only for one time backup. I resolved the problem by opening the AirPort Utility, selecting Disks, and changing the option \"Secure Shared Disks\" from \"With a device password\" (this was the Time Capsule password) to \"With a disk password\" (a new password for the disk). Now it works fine and I am able to backup from two separate macs without issues. \n\nA: Just had this problem and this worked:\n1.Shut down Mac\n2.unplug from electric the Time machine and Modem\n3.Reboot modem - wait till complete\n4.replug Time machine into electric - once you see the green light on the machine turn on your Mac.\n5.Go to Time Machine and choose \"Back up now\" - should work\n", "Q: Activate passcode lock after 30 mins of inactivity?

The hard disk has previously been used as an external disk on a PC, but has been reinitialised for Mac. However, it seems that no matter what method I use to clone (tried SuperDuper, CCC and Disk Utility), it seems as if the system thinks the disk is in the wrong format.\nTo test the 500gb disk, I put a clean install of Snow Leopard on it, and successfully booted another MacBook from it. At this point, I figured I had successfully ensured it would then be seen as a Mac disk when I cloned to it - but it wasn't.

Ok so I have recently started using TextEdit to create .txt documents on 10.8.2 (Mountain Lion) but I am used to word processors like pages.\nI realise that txt files don't have pages, even though you can create page breaks or simulate the printed view with the \"wrap to page\" command.\nThe issue I have occurs whichever view I use. I fill the screen with text and, as I write more, the cursor creates new text at the bottom of the screen as the existing text scrolls away. I don't find this very ergonomic as I continually have to look downwards at the bottom of the screen.\nI have tried adding empty lines to the end of the document but this is not ideal: I use the keyboard to navigate and, in this case, 'command + down arrow' takes me to the end of the extra lines of space, not to the end of the document text, making my keyboard navigation less efficient.\nIs there a way I can avoid having to stare at the bottom of the screen while creating lengthly .txt documents? Is there a way to get the cursor to behave as it does in Pages for example: i.e. when it reaches the bottom of a screen full of text, it automatically scrolls and moves to the top of a new blank screen?\nFailing that, can anyone recommend a good minimal plaintext editor for Mac which has some kind of auto scrolling feature when the screen is filled with text?\nHope my description is clear! Thanks in advance for any input.\n\nA: Many full screen writing applications like WriteRoom and Byword either add a margin to the bottom or support centering the view around the current line.\nYou could also create ~/Library/KeyBindings/ and save a property list like this as DefaultKeyBinding.dict:\n{\n    \"~p\" = (moveToEndOfDocument:, insertNewlineIgnoringFieldEditor:, insertNewline:, insertNewline:, insertNewline:, insertNewline:, insertNewline:, insertNewline:, insertNewline:, insertNewline:, insertNewline:, insertNewline:, insertNewline:, insertNewline:, insertNewline:, insertNewline:, insertNewline:, moveWordBackward:, moveToEndOfParagraph:, moveForward:, centerSelectionInVisibleArea);\n    \"~r\" = (moveToEndOfDocument:, moveWordBackward:, moveToEndOfParagraph:, moveToEndOfDocumentAndModifySelection:, deleteBackward:, centerSelectionInVisibleArea:, insertNewlineIgnoringFieldEditor:);\n}\n\nAfter reopening TextEdit, ⌥P should add padding lines to the end and ⌥R remove them.\n", "Q: How do I also sync the web calendar feeds that are in my Gmail/Google calendar into iOS 6?

After releasing the keyboard OS was loaded but without any startup sound and my original problem remained (see Original problem)\nI found out that not being able to reset PRAM may be caused by the user password, so I tried to disable the password request but this did not work either. This seems to be because of FireVault which I deactivated a couple of hours ago. My system is still encoding so it might take another couple of hours until I can see whether this approach was useful.\nDoes anyone have another advice?\nOriginal problem: No sound, no micro\nMy MacBook Pro (2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, Mac OS X Lion 10.7.5 (11G56)) was on stand-by all the night. When I opened my Mac this morning I had no sound and my micro did not work either (A call via skype failed (I could not hear anybody and they did not hear me) but the camera worked. I cannot hear music via iTunes nor any other application. Also I cannot hear the click sound when one tries to turn up volume.). Therefore I thought resetting PRAM would be the solution but I failed in doing so as described.\n\nA: Based on what you said, it looks like your PRAM did reset. I usually let it go 3 times before letting my Mac restart. The problem then lays outside of the realm of PRAM. \nHave you tried checking the inbuilt application \"Audio MIDI Setup\" to confirm what the Inputs and Outputs are? And are the Inputs and Outputs turned up?\nIf that doesn't work, have you tried doing a SMC reset? Those usually deal with the problems relating to system software.\n\nA: I never heard of PRAM resetting until my MBP started running super slow and took over 2 minutes to boot up. I found this thorough article about PRAM Reset on nextweb, which helped me greatly. It has instructions for different MBP models and additional resetting instructions to consider. Satisfactory performance since.\nI pair the PRAM reset with the SMC Reset. So far performance is great. Though I find I have to reset often whenever I work on major projects in Photoshop and Illustrator. Hope this helps!\n", "Q: Can the SQLite databases that store iOS mail be exploited to back up messages? Being the technical dude of the family I'm confronted with the following problem:\nAn iPhone 3GS with iOS 3.1.2, the owner has a lot of old email messages stored on the device but has lost access to the original email server. Other copies of these messages were safely stored on a laptop but the hard disk died.\nForwarding each message manually from the device is not an option given the amount of work involved (about 2000 messages).\nI'm fairly technical but without any experience with Macs or iPhones. Reading around a bit I learned the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*There's no straightforward way to backup email messages (you can backup email account settings but not the actual content).\n\n*There's no way to mark all messages on the device and move them to an IMAP folder so they would sync up to a new mail server.\n\n*Messages are stored in a SQLite database file on the device. You cannot access this file and move it to your PC or mail it to yourself unless you jailbreak and unlock the device.\nFirst of all, am I wrong and there is some magical way or utility to transfer messages from the device to a PC? Assuming there isn't, can someone point me to the right jailbreak and unlocking procedures that will not delete all data from the device and allow me to get that SQLite store safely?\nI'd love to learn if it's possible to read these databases and make a backup of my Mail by accessing the backup files or the files directly on the device.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: I was searching for information on this myself because I needed to back up my email data from the device before doing a restore (it's just shameful that Apple doesn't consider your email messages to be important enough to include in its backups). The following information is valid for IOS 6, I hope it applies to your situation with IOS 3 as well.  On IOS 6 at least, you won't need to mess around with SQlite or anything, it's all plain text.\nYou need access to the filesystem on the device. There are various PC and Mac apps that will browse the files on the device -- Ifunbox is one that claims to allow access to the filesystem without jailbreaking.\nInstructions for jailbreaking your specific device (if it turns out you need it) can be found at http://stateofjailbreak.com/guide/iphone-3gs/3-1-2/.\nThe emails are stored in User/Library/Mail (that's a symlink, the actual path seems to be var/mobile/library/mail).  Just copy the whole thing to your laptop.  \nInside there, you'll find directories named after each email account set up on the device. There's a pretty self-explanatory folder structure within each account folder.  Once you drill down, the emails themselves are stored in individual plaintext *.emlx files, complete with all headers and uuencoded attachments (there's also sometimes an \"attachments\" folder which has the extracted version of the attachments).  On a PC, you'll want to rename them to *.eml files, and then you'll be able to import them into various email programs like Thunderbird or Outlook; with some you'll need a utility, with others the import function is built in.\nI haven't gotten far enough to determine if copying a backup of these folders onto a device restored from itunes backup will restore your archive of emails or not.  Did I mention how annoying it is that Apple doesn't think your offline emails are worth saving when you do a backup of your device?\n\nA: If you want to backup messages of iPhone, you can use iTunes to make it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the latest version of iTunes on your computer;\n\n*Connect iPhone to computer and run iTunes with it;\n\n*Choose to make a backup with iTunes;\n\n\nThat is the way you are able to backup iPhone messages on computer.\n", "Q: iMessage: enable SMS and not MMS I have an iPhone and obviously I always use iMessage with friends that have an iPhone.

If spending for a SMS in ok, I want to send images only when iMessage is available. Is there any option that can enable SMS and disable MMS when iMessage is over?\n\nA: The MMS switch only disables MMS, not iMessages with picture attachments. So you can turn the MMS switch off to get the behaviour you desire.\n", "Q: How to transfer my apps, home, and OS X setup from an external Lion disk to an internal Mountain Lion SSD I installed an SSD (Samsung 830) as the internal drive of a Mid 2009 MacBook Pro, then attempted several times to clone the (now external) bootable OS X Lion drive using either SuperDuper or Carbon Copy Cloner to this new SSD. All attempts failed with disk writes failures (I tried two different SSDs with the same result: write failures). So installed Lion onto the new SSD using the OS X DVD installer and all went fine; then upgraded from Lion to Mountain Lion from the App Store. Again, all went great.\nWhich folders should I copy from the external Lion disk to the internal Mountain Lion SSD to get back all my apps, the MySQL server, PostgreSQL, ImageMagick, XCode installation, etc.? I would like to make the new Mountain Lion SSD contain all my useful apps so that I don’t have to reinstall from scratch.\n\nA: The easiest way is to use Migration Assistant, which you can find in /Applications/Utilities/.\nIt can copy your apps, data and settings from your old disk if it's connected via USB, Firewire or Thunderbolt. You should end up with a mirror image of your old set up.\nStart Migration Assistant, select From another Mac, PC, Time Machine backup, or other disk on the first screen, and From a Time Machine backup or other disk on the second screen, then follow the prompts.\nIf you need more detailed instructions, consult Apple's Migration Assistant Guide (you want the Time Machine or other disk migration section).\n", "Q: Safe to upgrade to Windows 8 on Bootcamp?

When it comes up on the screen, it only shows a checkerboard design. If I disengage the Apple TV, the DVD shows perfectly on the MacBook Air screen.\nApple Support says it is because of copyright on the DVD that won't let it show on the TV. I don't know why it would be any different that showing it on a DVD player.\nIs there a way to work around this block to be able to stream a DVD?\n\nA: Try using VLC to play the DVD instead of the OS X's DVD Player app.\nYou can also rip your DVD to a format the Apple TV can play directly using Handbrake, but obviously this isn't really an on-demand solution (it will probably yield better quality than VLC + AirPlay Mirroring though).\nAlso see this question for details on how you could set up direct streaming without AirPlay mirroring, which should yield better quality (at the cost of some time setting it up at first): Can I stream any video played with VLC player to Apple TV?\n", "Q: Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard function keys unreliable I have a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard connected to my 2011 MacBook Pro.\nThe keyboard's normal keys (letters, etc.) always work fine; however, there is a problem with the various function keys.\nBasically, they don't work until I go to System Preferences -> Microsoft Keyboard. Once I go to that prefpane, everything starts working again.\nIt seems to somewhat randomly stop working, requiring me to go to System Preferences again to make it work.\nHow can I fix this? It seems like a daemon/driver that's supposed to make the keys work is crashing, but I searched Console.app for microsoft with no luck.\n\nA: I also have the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard. In my case the simple solution was to press the F Lock key at the far right of the function row (left of the Print Screen button). I didn't realize the button even existed until now.\n\nA: The reason for this is that Microsoft Keyboard Helper is somehow not being added to the Login Items by the keyboard's driver installer. However, the helper is contained inside the Microsoft Keyboard Preference Pane, so it is being run when you open it, and thus restores the full functionality of the keyboard.\nThe simple solution is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences;\n\n*Go to Users & Groups > {your user} > Login Items;\n\n*Click + icon under the Login Items list;\n\n*When Finder window opens, press ⇧ + ⌘ + G;\n\n*When a form appears, paste this into it: \n/Library/PreferencePanes/Microsoft Keyboard.prefPane/Contents/Resources/;\n\n*Select the file MicrosoftKeyboardHelper, and press Add;\n\n\nThat's it. The keyboard should now retain its function keys' functionality after the restart. \n", "Q: iPod touch 4th gen restore broken So the device is jailbroken, and I'm trying to sell it so I'd like to update and wipe it. It works perfectly, all my apps, music, videos, etc. are on the device, and even after trying to flash it clean, restore from itunes, etc. the device still boots up just fine when I try and use it. It's the strangest thing.\n\nA: When you perform the reset, do not \"restore from backup\", as iTunes will prompt you to do when it detects the \"empty\" device.  Instead, press cancel, and your iPod Touch should be empty.\nFor the most security, you should perform the erase from the device itself - In Settings, go to General, and select Reset; then, select \"Erase All Content and Settings\".  It may take a while, but it is a secure way to erase the device.\n", "Q: Terminal and bash can't start with libiconv error I just tried to start Terminal.app in Mac OS X 10.6.8, and got the following error:\n dyld: Library not loaded: /opt/local/lib/libiconv.2.dylib   Referenced\n    from: /bin/bash   Reason: Incompatible library version: bash requires\n    version 8.0.0 or later, but libiconv.2.dylib provides version 7.0.0\n\n [Process completed]\n\nI have MacPorts installed, so I suspect somehow the libiconv version is messed up. However, since I can't start a terminal session, I don't even know how to troubleshoot or correct this error.\nWhat should I do? Thanks.\n\nA: Without bash you won't be able to login in the Terminal or via ssh. You could try zsh instead but this is probably depending on the library as well.\nOption 1\nOpen Terminal, ignore the error message in the window, press Shift-Cmd-N and run /bin/sh, /bin/zsh or /bin/csh instead of bash. Then fix the symlinks.\nOption 2\nBoot from the Install DVD, run Terminal from there and see whether version 8 of the library is still in /usr/lib (or use libiconv.* from the Install DVD). If yes, fix the symlinks and reboot.\nOTOH as OS X 10.8 ships with libiconv.2 you might be out of luck:\nlrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel       16 Oct 16 20:50 libiconv.2.4.0.dylib@ -> libiconv.2.dylib\n-r-xr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  2113600 Oct 16 20:50 libiconv.2.dylib*\nlrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel       20 Oct 16 20:50 libiconv.dylib@ -> libiconv.2.4.0.dylib\n\nOption 3\nLike option 1 but try to replace the MacPorts /bin/bash with the original one. I don't know how MacPorts works but the original one might still hang around as /bin/bash.orig or similar.\nOption 4\nReinstall the OS from the Install DVD (doesn't impact the rest) and re-apply the OS X upgrades.\n\nA: Open TextEdit, load the Open File dialog, and press Cmd-Shift-. (that's a dot at the end).  Load the file .bash_profile\nCopy, from the line which begins:\n# MacPorts Installer addition\nuntil the line which ends:\n# Finished adapting your PATH environment variable for use with MacPorts.\ninto a separate document.  Then delete those lines from the original file, and save it.  Save the removed lines to a new file for safekeeping.\nYour Terminal should now work, but this won't help your Macports installation.  From here, you can try to troubleshoot it, or you can reinstall Macports by first removing (or backing up) /opt/local.\n", "Q: Using Windows 8 .img file to create a bootable USB thumb drive Is it possible to create a bootable USB drive for installing Windows 8 without access to a copy of Windows? \nI know I could install a VM and install Windows there, then make the bootable drive and use Bootcamp to actually install that way, but honestly I would rather not have to put the extra software on my system if at all possible.\nI checked the Bootcamp documentation and it says I may have the option to \"create a windows installation disk\" but I don't have that option (unsure why?)\nAdditional information:\nUSB Key capacity: 1 16gb and 1 30gb\nOS ver: OSX Mountain Lion\nMachine: Late 2010 MacBook Air\n\nA: It seems Bootcamp Assistant should be able to help you with this (especially as you have a MacBook Air). It odd that it doesn't. Another weird move from Apple. Because of this you may need to do some system editing, as ethanlee16 points out, to convince BA to give you the option of creating a Bootable USB. \nFollow his instructions, or if you don't want to go into terminal, follow these instructions. \nAnd then follow these:\nFirst, convert your Windows 8 .img file to an .iso file. You can do this within OSX by following these simple instructions.\nNext, just use the new .iso image with Bootcamp Assistant to create a bootable USB drive with Windows 8 on it. These instructions (as posted by Alexandr Mazanov in the comments) do a great job of explaining what to do.\nNo need for Windows or any VMWare. Good luck!\n\nA: This adds on to Django's answer, pointing out how to allow the option for revealing \"Create a Windows 7 Installation Disk\" in Boot Camp Assistant.\n\nI checked the Bootcamp documentation and it says I may have the option to \"create a windows installation disk\" but I don't have that option (unsure why?)\n\nBecause you cannot see this option, it is most likely because your computer is not supported in Boot Camp Assistant.app's Info.plist. However, that can be quickly changed.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a new Terminal window and run sudo nano\n/Applications/Utilities/Boot\\ Camp\\\nAssistant.app/Contents/Info.plist\n\n*Type in your password.\n\n*Move with the arrow keys down to the bottom where it says:\n(I meant to start with \" (<) key (>) USBBootSupportedModels (<) /key (/>), but I don't know how to ignore HTML markup here.

Replace it with an identical one that says:\n... <string>MBA32</string> ...\n\n(Without the ellipses)\nNow save the file by typing Control-O and confirming the WriteOut by pressing the return key (make sure Wrote xx lines appears).

If the first region dropdown menu is United States (Computer), this might be your problem.  Looking below shows that this region formats numbers without a thousands separator.\n\nThis appears to be the result, as you stated, of an OS X update. Instead, set the Region to United States (without the Computer part).\n\nFrom the Excel Help window:\n\nDisplay or hide the thousands separator\nSelect the cells that you want to adjust. On the Home tab, under\nNumber, click Display the value of a cell with a thousands separator.\nNote: Excel uses the Mac OS system separator for thousands. You can\nspecify a different system separator by changing the regional settings\nin Mac OS X International system preferences.\n\nWe have just done that, but it appears that Excel continues to ignore the change.  Re-install Office and update us with the results.\n\nA: Formatting palette\nNumber\nCustom\nEdit format of the prototype number (I removed the dollar sign, but kept the commas)\nI have Mountain Lion and Excel 2008 for mac\n\nA: Setting the System Region Setting from 'United States (Computer)' to 'United States' worked for me!\nRunning Mavericks 10.9.5 and Office 14.4.5.\n\nA: I had the same problem and just applied the solution recommended, to change the region from US Computer to US, and know what?

But since the current version (iChat 7.0.1 Mountain Lion) I cannot see that chat History. All my previous messages are saved into ~/Documents/iChat by previous version. So how can I view the chat history like in previous versions?\n\nA: For chat transcripts created by Messages, once you've selected the conversation in the Messages window (with File > Recent Items if necessary), you just scroll back and Messages will load older transcripts incrementally.  However, this is pretty poorly implemented, as there's no way to scroll all the way back at once; you have to scroll to the top or press Home repeatedly.\nThe newer transcripts are stored in ~/Library/Messages/Archive, not ~/Documents/iChat.  Quick Look is also supported for chat transcripts.\nChatology is a third-party app that may be of help; it will read transcripts in both locations, is faster and less buggy than Messages (e.g., lets you see images in old chats where Messages won't).\n\nA: You can open old chat transcripts either by double-clicking the .ichat file in ~/Documents/iChat or by using Cmd-O from within Messenger. Both options aren't really convenient...\n", "Q: Why is the dictionary shortcut unreliable using Chrome? When using the dictionary lookup shortcut Ctrl + Cmd + D when using Chrome it works for some websites but not for others.\nDoes this have to do with Chrome itself or is it due to the fact that some websites are using Javascript and this is affecting the shortcut?\n\nA: This bug is known to the Chrome developers and has been filed under...\nIssue 90461: Dictionary keyboard shortcut doesn't work in Lion\nBasically the problems are timing issues for some websites which take too long to respond to information needed to show the dictionary.\nThis is what resek@chromium.org says:\n\nThere's likely not much that we can do here. We have to block the UI\nthread to implement this feature, which is bad and so that's done on a\ntimeout. If the web page takes too long to respond for the information\nwe need to display the popup, we give up and unblock the UI. If we\ndidn't do this, Chrome would look like it's hung, waiting on the web\npage to respond.\nWe collect timing information about this, and most pages succeed well\nbelow the timeout, but there's also some class of pages that do not\nrespond in time (more than 1500ms, which is what starts to be\nperceived as sluggish/hung).\n\n", "Q: How to stop xampp mysql server?

Do I carry any clutter with me that makes it better to do a fresh install?\n\nA: This is Alex from Reincubate, I work on the iPhone Backup Extractor.\nSetting up your iPhone from scratch will mean that you lose your personalized settings, while restoring from previous backup will revert the settings to the moment of the backup. If you have nothing against taking it all over again with your iPhone you should set as new, but if you are in a hurry and want to speed the process up restore from backup.\nHope it helps.\n\nA: As long as you don’t jailbreak, restoring a new phone from a backup will not cause any problems.\nSometimes, using software that bypasses iTunes (e.g. DiskAid) or edits the backups (e.g. iExplorer) will cause problems.\n", "Q: How do I change the settings of the sounds in iOS 6?

So, taking note of this extra requirement, 256GB will be rather small.. \nI was thinking, because I don't use the Windows 7 that much, I can install Windows on a 64GB SanDisk Cruzer USB flash stick and then boot from that. \nIs this solution compatible with BootCamp?\n\nA: As far as I know, Boot Camp doesn't support external drives (with a possible exception of some Thunderbolt devices and CD/DVD drives). The Mac's boot loader only supports booting via EFI on USB and Firewire, whereas Boot Camp is BIOS/MBR emulation.\nWindows 7 x64 apparently has a UEFI mode. I don't know if this is compatible with the Mac implementation of EFI. It certainly requires a 64-bit EFI - so only Macs that are compatible with Mountain Lion are even candidates for this. In any case, I haven't managed to pull this off myself, and the information I've found on the web is conflicting. Even if you can get the Windows install DVD to boot in EFI mode (how?), Windows will probably refuse to install to a USB drive.\nSo in summary, there's certainly no straightforward way to do this. It might be possible with some effort, but I haven't seen any reliable reports of success. (and I haven't had the time to try it myself with Win7 - I tried and failed back in the Windows XP days)\n", "Q: Dangers of limiting fan-speed The situation: \nI work in a very quiet office using MBP Spring 2011 with an i7.\nThe problem is that when I put an intense but short workload for a few seconds on the CPU the fans spin up heavily, disturbing me and especially my office mates.\nI elevated the MAC to get some air flowing under the body but that was not sufficient.\nSo I found a solution to limit the fan speed, currently limiting it to 3500 by using:\ncd /Applications/smcFanControl.app/Contents/Resources\n./smc -k F0Mx -w 36b0\n./smc -k F1Mx -w 36b0\n\nThe question:\nHow dangerous is doing this?\nMy current line of thinking is: the cooling is now insufficient for intense long workloads. But if the CPU gets too hot it will just throttle or at worst the MBP might shut down, but nothing worse should happen. Many Laptops have dusty or broken fans and they don't burn out their CPUs either.\nIs this a reasonable assumption or am I risking real damage here?\n\nA: Some quick research says that the i7 processor starts to throttle itself if the temperature range gets too high (around 91C) so you shouldn't have to worry about it provided your CPU temp stays less than that.  Mostly the fan speed is trying to keep it comfortable on your lap as best it can - monitor your temperature during one of these \"intense sessions\" and see if it approaches that threshold - if it doesnt, and stays more on the order of 60C, you're fine as far as short term CPU viability\nResearch:\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/239230/what-is-a-normal-safe-temperature-for-an-i7-2600k-cpu\nhttp://www.maximumpc.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=38&t=136130\n", "Q: How to isolate the most disk-active process(es) in OS X?

No problem!\n  Installing Windows 8 on a Mac with Boot\n  Camp\"\n  in which the author briefly explains how to install Windows 8 via\n  Bootcamp with the Bootcamp drivers.\nIn addition, he also post\n  information on how to get the latest drivers for your Mac hardware\n  - which is very helpful because updating Bootcamp drivers is not one of Apple's priorities it seems.\n\n\nA: I have properly installed Windows 8 RTM on a Mac Mini without any issue. Just supply the Windows 8 iso instead of the Windows 7 one while installing Windows throught Bootcamp and everything works fine.\nRegarding the Windows 8 availability, there is the upgrade version and there is the full one (Called System Builder).\nAccording to http://www.winsupersite.com/article/windows8/clean-install-windows-8-upgrade-media-144648 you need the full version: \n\nUnless you’ve got a Mac (in which case, yes, you do need that System Builder version)\n\nUpdate There is also some indications from Microsoft on how to install Windows 8 (and the dev tools) on your Mac: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/windows/apps/jj680133\nUpdate 2 There is yet another semi-guide about installing Windows 8 on a Mac: http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/11/no-support-no-problem-installing-windows-8-on-a-mac-with-boot-camp/\n\nA: As gentmatt pointed out, to the best of my knowledge, at the moment I'm writing this, Apple has not announced any official support for Windows 8 in Bootcamp, and Apple is not supplying a package of Apple device drivers specifically tailored to Windows 8 on Bootcamp.\nHowever, it seems as if people have had success with this so far, using the Apple drivers for Windows 7, and it is highly likely that Apple is working on specific drivers for Windows 8 and will be offering them in the future.\nMeanwhile I am now running Windows 8 on Parallels Desktop for Mac. You have to make sure that you have the latest version, which at this writing is Build 8.0.18314\n (Revision 813278; October 31, 2012). According to Parallels, no earlier version than this will work correctly with upgrading an existing Windows 7 virtual machine to Windows 8, and they recommend this version for making a new virtual machine with a clean installation of Windows 8 also.\n", "Q: On new iPhone, when I call people no one can hear me but I can hear them I got a new iPhone last weekend and have a problem: why can’t people hear me on the other end of the phone when I call them? Any tips on what the cause could be?\n\nA: Assuming everything is actually OK with your phone then I had same problem.\nI read on another post it is an issue with Apple's attempt at noise cancelation when making calls when background noise is present.  It was suggested to disable noise cancellation by enabling hearing aid mode (under General-->Assesibilty).  They only down side is it makes you enable bluetooth and amplifies your handset volume a bit.  I tested it with several people and they all noted how much better they could hear and understand me.\n\nA: I still had the protective plastic film on my screen to protect it until I get a proper screen protector. Removing this has fixed my problem.\n\nA: Would do as falconbridge says: \"Although it may be a more complex issue, I would try the Voice Memos app to see if the mic works or not.\"  If your device does not register sound through that app it's likely that your microphone is bad.\n\n\n*\n\n*If it's a new phone bought directly from an Apple Store I would take it to them and you will most likely get a new phone if it clearly isn't your fault. \n\n*If you do not get a new phone I suggest calling http://www.iCracked.com or any other local repair store\n\n\nA: On the back of the phone is the camera, the flash, and in between is a little pin hole\nThat pin hole is supposed to receive outside intruding noise, and filters that noise out of the mike where you talk.\nTrouble is, your own voice travels up the back of the phone case, and starts to filter your own voice out - people cant hear you.\nI filled mine with linseed glazing putty\n\nA: Sounds like the microphone has gone. I had this problem when I purchased my IPhone from Carphone Warehouse. I took it back and their Geek Squad repaired it for me.\n\nA: Try turning the phone off and back on again after about 3 min...Worked for me...\n\nA: I had this problem after replacing the back housing of an iphone. The noice cancellation was the cause of this. By disabeling this the problem was solved. The new back cover had a whole in the back with no kind of tissue in it.\n\nA: Try disabling voice cancellation. Which is under general > accessibility > voice cancellation. This kind of worked for me.\n\nA: If they cannot hear you but can hear you on speaker phone than you are most likely in need of a charging port replacement for your iPhone. The bottom mic is located on the same flex cable as the charging port.\n", "Q: Setting for iOS device type (Jailbreak) I've read that there is a settings file (/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist) that stores the value of the iOS version which can be changed (at least on Jailbroken iOS devices) temporarily to fool apps (or the app store) into thinking a device is running a different version than it actually is. (There even is/was a tweak that changed this for you, FWChanger.) \nIs the device type/model (iPad, iPhone, etc. and generation) also stored in a way that can be temporarily changed? (The reason is to just quickly test out an app, I'm not expecting a long-term, stable solution here. And yes, I know about the potential dangers of changing such values in regards to stability, etc.)\n\nA: As for the first paragraph: Yes, the OS version can be changed (at your own risk) by opening said file (/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist) with a plist editor of your choice and then changing the version from 5.1 to 6.0.1 or whatever you intend.\nThe device type can’t – and even if it could, shouldn’t – be changed, though, as there are versions for each and every device and while the OS version might change over time, the device itself obviously won’t automagically transform into another device. There is a file called after the device you’re using in many of the subfolders of /CoreServices/, though. In case of an iPod touch 4th gen, the name would be N81ap.plist. In there, you find the capabilities of the device.\nEDIT: \nI just spoke with a friend of mine. He told me that yes, you could modify the version. But you would also have to change the ProductBuildVersion – for example from 9B208 (iOS 5.1.1) to 10A523 (iOS 6.0.1). But this, of course, might lead to failure because the app might try to use methods not available in the OS version you pretend to be using.\nBy copying the values of (for example) N81ap.plist to #yourDevice.plist, your device (theoratically) gets the features of n81.ap. This could also lead to failure, because Springboard (or others) might need functions not available to the device you are actually using.\nFor some apps, it is quite easy to set the required phone/device, though. In that case you would have to search for a value like “requires telephony” or alike.\n", "Q: Why is the Amazon iOS App allowed by Apple? Today a customer asked me how it comes that there is an iOS app for purchasing from Amazon while this seems to violate Apple's App Store review purchasing guidelines (Apple Developer login needed).\nI could give him no answer to his question – it seems that there is a small number of allowed ways to do purchases in apps that Apple permits, even if they do not get a revenue from them.\nWhat kind of purchases does Apple allow in an app that do not go through their purchasing system but through a custom one?\n\nA: By my reading, it doesn't.  Which rule do you think it violates?\nSection 11 covers In-App Purchases, which Amazon's app doesn't use, and which are only required for \"content, functionality, or services in an App\".  Amazon doesn't let you buy anything to extend their app.\nAmazon's app also doesn't allow purchasing ebooks, which is their only product (AFAICT) that might be covered by section 11.  They have a note at the bottom of all ebook pages that says \"This mobile application does not currently support Kindle downloads, however you may add the item to your Wish List and purchase it using the browser on your device\".\nFinally, section 20 explicitly prohibits allowing the user to purchase a lottery ticket, which suggests that there is nothing unacceptable about other real-world purchases.  Lots of other apps allow them, too, like eBay.\n\nA: The Amazon app allows you to buy physical objects, which are not covered by Apple's 30% policy.  \n", "Q: How can I connect 2 non apple screens to my 13\" mac book pro? \nPossible Duplicate:\nCan I plug two external monitors in to a MacBook Pro? \n\nI've just purchased a new non-retina MacBook Pro 13\" with the latest version of OS X (10.8.2).\nI want to connect my two 22\" displays (Samsung and LG) to my MBP and have a 3 screen workstation (laptop screen + 2 screens).\nOne external screen has got a VGA port and the other a DVI.

I'd like to give Windows 8 a go, using Boot Camp. Now, I've probably done a b Boot Camp install of Windows close to 10 times, on multiple Macs, but I'm stumped right now.\nThis computer previously had full disk encryption on, which I disabled last night.\nNow, it seems as though a lot of the free space needs to be... defragmented.\nFollowing are 3 screenshots, the first of Boot Camp, complaining of no free space, the second of all of my free space, and the last of the disk's partition map:\n\n\n\nI Googled a bit, and have tried repairing the disk and permissions, and both found a few issues, but still the disk appears to be fragmented.\nEDIT: For @pmjordan\nJosh-Work-MacBook-Pro:~ josh.oneal$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *251.0 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            250.1 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\nJosh-Work-MacBook-Pro:~ josh.oneal$ sudo gpt -r show disk0\nPassword:\n      start       size  index  contents\n          0          1         PMBR\n          1          1         Pri GPT header\n          2         32         Pri GPT table\n         34          6         \n         40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n     409640  488555536      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  488965176    1269536      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  490234712          7         \n  490234719         32         Sec GPT table\n  490234751          1         Sec GPT header\n\n\nA: Thanks for the update, your partition table looks fine.\nOne more thing to try would be to boot from the recovery system or installation media, or access the drive from another Mac via Target Disk mode and try to resize the partition from a Disk Utility instance that isn't booted off the partition you're trying to resize. Unfortunately, it's fairly unlikely this will help - I've seen more instances where it didn't than where it did.\nIf Disk Utility can't help you, the only solutions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up, erase and restore\n\n*Try your luck with something else. In the past, resizing via parted (an open source Linux utility) has worked for me in such cases. I'm writing this on a MacBook Air with an OSX installation that survived the procedure unharmed. There's a bootable Live CD/DVD distribution of this available, called \"Parted Magic\"; \"GParted Live\" is another, which seems to be a bit more user friendly. You can burn either to disc and boot into it by holding the option key during the boot chime, as usual. Then shrink your main partition - this will take a while, as it needs to move the data to free up the space at the end of the partition. There is of course a certain risk associated with this, so make sure you've backed up and are prepared to go through with option 1 instead. Make sure to unplug your backup disk during any such procedure. One issue with using another tool is that unlike Disk Utility or Boot Camp, this won't move the Recovery HD. So your best bet is usually to shrink by the required amount, then grow it again to the original size. Doing this will then \"unstick\" Boot Camp/Disk Utility, and they'll be able to proceed with the shrinking as normal.\n", "Q: Text Abbreviations Stop Working I was trying to send a text message consisting of an abbreviation I had set up, but I would type the two characters and the abbreviation was not appearing. Is there a cause? In the past, I have restarted my phone and it has worked afterwards, but I'd rather not have to do that if there's another way.\n\nA: This is a bug.\nMy personal hypothesis is that the root cause is the new iOS 6 iCloud syncing for text abbreviation sometimes fails, thus breaking the whole abbreviation system.  \nSince it appears to be quite common, a fix is hopefully coming soon. To increase the chances, be sure to report the bug here:\nhttp://www.apple.com/feedback/iphone.html\n", "Q: Suddenly I'm requested to restore my iPhone to factory settings I have an iPhone 4 loaded with unmodified iOS 6. I use it (for two years now) with a virtualbox running Windows XP with iTunes (10.7 currently).\nEverything works just peachy most of the time, and when it doesn't I can usually find the fault and correct it quickly.\nEarlier today I was synchronizing my iPhone, and it seemed to have worked fine, or so I thought. I wanted to re-synchronize after updating an app via iTunes, and suddenly the software tells me it cannot read my iPhone and that I must restore it to factory settings before I can use it again.\nMy last backup was two weeks ago, and I fear that deleting it would mean that I cannot restore any data if I end up resetting the phone.\nWhat I already tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*I checked the iTunes and the cable with my girlfriend's iPod Nano. Everything works great.\n\n*I tried to reboot my virtual machine.\n\n*I tried to reboot my iPhone.\n\n*I tried to reboot my virtual machine after rebooting my iPhone.\n\n*I tried to see if there are any \"bad\" files somewhere that I may delete, some incomplete transfers or so.\n\n*I tried to meddle within the log files, but I wasn't sure which ones to check or what to do.\n\n\nThe iPhone works perfectly fine, by the way.\nPlease help me.\nWhat should I do to correct this, and if I do end up restoring factory settings what happens to all the texts/photos/music/etc. I have on my iPhone right now?\n(I have a traumatic experience from the upgrade to iOS 6...)\n\nEdit: Quite some time later, my iTunes still insists that I need to restore my phone. I tried to delete all the previous backups and remove iTunes and whatnot, but nothing helped. I tried to connect it to other iTunes and they all tell me the same thing: I must restore the phone to factory settings.\nHowever, being a \"cunning\" Linux user I decided that I should try and see if I can access the phone from the Linux part of the computer, and indeed I can. Being able to browse through the files it hit me that it might be possible to fix the problem through manual tempering with some file (or removing some leftover files).\nIs it possible to do that at all? If so, is there a guide or some hint on how to find out what needs to be corrected?\n\nA: Firstly I would sign up to iCloud if you haven't and then use the over the air backup to backup your iPhone (You get 5GB free!) then once this is done, you will be able to reset the phone should you want / need to.\nHave there been any updates to your Virtual Box since your last sync? If not, it could be that iTunes can not see its XML file needed for device synchronisation; also ensure that all of the helper services are started on your machine.\nFailing the above and assuming you follow the first recommendation, try resetting and restoring from iCloud. \nBest of luck\n\nA: connect your iphone USB cable to the pc or mac with the iphoe still turned of, with iTunes running connect your phone to the USB cable but keep pressing the homw button untill a window pops up saying ur phone is on recovery mode and then, its gonna give u the option to restore ur phone. tht means it will delete EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!\n\nA: Hi I had the same problem. I am using win 7 64 bit.\nI have installed MediaMonkey, the I connected iPhone to the PC and once the window popped-up, I clicked on \"open with MediaMonkey\". Than the phone was synced in MediaMonkey and after that in iTunes as well. \n", "Q: How do I prevent accidental double clicks? My Magic Mouse is going bad and sometimes detects a double click when I single click.\nI know that there is a setting which allows you to set the upper threshold for double click speed, but not a lower threshold. \nHow do I set a lower threshold for double click speed?\n\nA: At present, there is no way to do so.\n\nHowever, one option to consider:\nDo you tap, or do you click? I don't know if the Magic Mouse has these settings, but worth a shot:\nIf you tap, you might want to go over to clicking — for example, the trackpad has these options:\n\nAlternatively, if you click, and would like to tap — simply enable that. If there's no such option, this free app might help.\n\nA: In Mountain Lion (and probably most if not all previous OSX versions) you can definitely set the threshold lower than the default click speed. If you have already set it the lowest setting, then I could only suggest replacing the mouse. \n\n", "Q: Burning disks fails with error 0x80020022 on MacbookPro 2012 My Macbook Pro is about 22 weeks old and I keep getting this error:\n0x80020022 (communication with drive failed) when trying to burn DVDs or \"attempt to burn a disc failed\"/unknown error -3 in iTunes.\nI read the usual \"venting-anger-and-sharing-solutions\"-thread, but I'm expecting that, just like the last time my SuperDrive failed, it's just a bunch of voodoo solutions, ie.:\nNothing works for everybody, everybody tries everything and if it happens to work right after, they believe in it until it fails again. \nI've burned less than 10 discs with my drive and I don't feel like spending two whole days on failing to fix it again. Do you think this is a warranty case? Or is there any site where the knowledge shared in Apple discussions is meaningfully combined so that I don't have to wade through ideas like \"Restart Finder 11 times, worked for me\".\n\nA: If I were you, I would take it back to your Apple Reseller and tell them your problem. You're still under warranty, so most likely, it won't be an issue.\n", "Q: remove scratch from iPhone 5 front glass Because I thought the gorilla glass of the iPhone 5 is pretty tuff I decided to omit a screen protection. Unfortunaltey now I have a very thin and subtle but very long (6 cm) scratch on the front glass. It is very hard to see and can only be seen at bright light and from a very specific angle and only when the display is turned off but it is still there, so ... \nI always handled the device very carefully and I have no idea where this scratch came from. I suspect the rivets near the pockets of some of my jeans.\nTo make sure that this is really a scratch I polished the screen with a little bit of water and a glasses cleaning cloth. The proposed scratch doesn't go away.\nIs there any way to get rid of this sratch?\n\nA: Yes, probably the rivets from your jeans.  I've done that before.\nA screen protector is always a good idea because of the time and money involved in replacing the touch screen.  Especially for any of the iPhones; they are expensive.  I have always loved the screen protectors from Screenguardz.  Compared to the ones at Best Buy (forget which brand), they are extremely smooth and the anti-glare is great.  Here's the one for the iPhone 5...\nScreenGuardz - iPhone 5\nAlso, if you already have scratches in your touch screen since you didn't have a screen protector there in the first place ( duh, :D just kidding), you might check out the compound from these guys.

From one to the other TimeMachine told me that the Backup Volume was corrupt and could not be recovered.\nPossible Reason for the corruption is the filesystem, which had not the full capability of ntfs or mac os extended.\nRight now I try to use a Synology NAS which has a build in TimeMachine support.\nBut if you want to be on the save side with your backup I would advice you to buy a TimeCapsule which has the best compatability with the TimeMachine.\n\nA: I found this in the help (Mountain Lion) ...\n\nIf your backup disk is on a network, the network server must use Apple File Protocol (AFP) file sharing, and both your computer, and the networked backup disk, should have Mac OS X 10.5.6 or later. The AFP disk must also be “mounted” (available to your computer).\nNote: Some AFP disks from manufacturers other than Apple don’t support Time Machine. If your network uses an AFP disk, but the disk doesn’t appear in the list of devices available for Time Machine backups, contact the disk’s manufacturer.\n\n\nA: Time Machine uses HFS+ features, so you can't just share a random third-party filesystem and have it work correctly.\nIf you do want to use a shared filesystem, you are best off creating a disk image on the filesystem, creating an HFS+ filesystem in the disk image using Disk Utility, and then having Time Machine use that.\n", "Q: Album art not syncing to iPhone for playlists A while ago I had a crash which wiped all the music synchronisation settings from my phone.\nUntil that point I'd synced based on selecting albums and artists in iTunes when the phone was plugged in, however having lost all that I decided it would be better to create playlists and sync those - that way if it happened again I just have to select half a dozen playlists to sync and I'm done.\nThe issue I have is that this doesn't seem to synchronise album art in most cases. The album art is there in iTunes but not on the phone.\nIf I select an artist to sync individually the artwork will appear (and will stay even when the artist selection is removed so it's just the playlist keeping the track on the phone), but without that it won't.\nEDIT: Selecting the album individually doesn't seem to push the art work across so that may be a red herring. It's all feeling rather random.\nAny thoughts on what I can do to force the artwork on to the phone without having to individually select every artist / album / track?\n(iTunes 10.7 and iOS 6.0 on an iPhone 4S)\n\nA: Denis Ahrens mentioned something about that in the last episode of mobileMacs (timecode).\nFor those of you who don't know German: He said that all of his music is lossless and that iTunes recently learned how to encode these files to 256kbit/s AAC when syncing his music to his iPhone. When he switched this on, he experienced the same problem that you have: No cover art at all. He explained that some people seem to get the cover art and some don't.\nIf I understood him right (even for native speakers, he talks very fast and the context isn't always clear) he says that the parts of your library that get converted from lossless while transferring are missing the cover art while the tracks/albus/files that you convert explicitly before syncing get the cover art – but as I said, I'm not sure about that.\nI have neither iOS 6 nor lossless music so I can't test this theory myself, I can only pass on what I heard; I hope it helps. (By the way, Denis concludes that he hasn't found a workaround yet and advises to wait for the fix.)\n\nA: Solution A: Upgrade to iOS 6.0.1\nSolution B: Wipe the device or factory reset it and then sync all your music to it\n\nWARNING: Wiping or doing a factory reset will remove all your personal data such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Phone numbers\n\n*Pictures\n\n*Music\n\n*Apps\n\n\nJust be sure to back these up before wiping the device.\n\nA: Solution \"A\" doesn't work.   I didn't have this problem with 6.0, it started for me with 6.0.1.   I have tried many \"fixes\" but none have worked for me.   I have too many music files to edit each one.   I would suggest the solution I am using, don't use iTunes to manage your music, use Media Monkey.   My music loads just fine with album art intact and Media Monkey can convert a cd into a FLAC file.   \n", "Q: Migration to new MacBook Pro I have upgraded to from a 2011 13\" MacBook Pro to a 2012 13\" MacBook Pro... found serious software slow down and wheel of death after installing Mountain Lion on 2011 MacBook Pro... Upgraded to 2012 MacBook Pro and used Migration assistant... dont have the huge slow down, but dont know if new machine is performing slower than its could.\nQuestion: Is there any way that Migration assistance could copy problem software to new MacBook Pro or does it automatically honour newer software?\n\nA: Usually when migrating to a new computer whether it is with migration assistent or other software, it will always cause your hard drive to be fragmented which will cause your computer to run slow. In some cases it can be very fragmented. I would recommend running DiskWarrior this utility is incredible how much faster it can make a computer, especially after migrating to a new computer.

(consolidated) I'm trying to understand what the best way to set up Google mail, contacts and calendars on my iPhone and iPad. There seems to be plenty of options, all of which have downsides spread over lots of different postings and websites.\nHere are the key issues I've found so far consolidated into one place:\nGoogle mail\n\n\n*\n\n*Exchange: Drafts don't synchronise. Searching for old emails doesn't always work. Google have announced that Exchange ActiveSync support will no longer be available for non-business accounts after 30th January 2013.\n\n*Gmail: No support for push email.\n\n*Gmail app: Cannot swipe messages in the inbox to delete them (only archive supported), notifications of new email sometimes open up the wrong email, mobile phone numbers aren't clickable, selecting an email address in any other app will not open Gmail to send a message (this is an iOS restriction), no custom alert sounds for certain contacts/groups and only a limited number of emails are readable if you have no data connection. \n\n\nCalendar\n\n\n*\n\n*Exchange: Additional newlines sometimes end up in the description of appointments. Google have announced that Exchange ActiveSync support will no longer be available for non-business accounts after 30th January 2013.\n\n*Gmail: Additional subscribed calendars aren't displayed.\n\n*CalDav: Birthday events in a subscribed calendar that has been hidden from view in the calendar app still show up in the Notification Center. Subscribed calendars in Google Calendar will always trigger an alarm on iOS (based on your default alert times) even though Google reports that none are set up. Changing an alert time will after a short while cause you to end up with two alerts on an appointment within iOS, one at the new alert time you wanted and one at the default alert time.\n\n\nContacts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Exchange: Not all fields (including pictures) are synchronized. Some address fields end up getting swapped (eg. town is displayed above the first line of the address). Google have announced that Exchange ActiveSync support will no longer be available for non-business accounts after 30th January 2013.\n\n*Gmail: Not possible.\n\n*CardDAV: Now recommended by Google as the preferred method. Will sync more than 3 email addresses. Syncs in both directions. No support for push. Contact group syncing is not supported. See related question.\n\n\nIs this correct? Is there anything else missing?\n\nA: The Verge gave a good writeup recommending the Gmail App + CalDAV + CardDAV: http://www.theverge.com/2012/12/5/3732364/best-way-gmail-google-calendar-iphone-how-to\nThe Gmail app solves both downsides you mention above. For CardDAV, it does a 15 min fetch, which is plenty good enough for me, so I don't see lack of push as being a real problem.\n\nA: It might be worth trying Sparrow. I didn't like the searching but I suspect it might deal with a bunch of your issues.  \nFor what it's worth, I actively disliked the Gmail app but it was updated fairly recently and now it's my main client.  Calendar remains a big problem for me - so excellent question.  \nAlso I believe you can flag email in the Exchange app... :s\n", "Q: Using LaTeX and SVN on iPad I'm used to write technical documents with LaTeX and use SVN as version system.\nI really would like to be able to do the same with my iPad.\nThe first problem is found a good App for LaTeX \nI found some of them bu they are not cheap and I don't want to spend 8$ each one just for finding out the best one.  Does someone can point me to the best one from thee followings or other I don't know?\n\n\n*\n\n*Tex Touch\n\n*TeX Writer\n\n*Texpad\nA good App should have the following features:\n\n\n*\n\n*Local compilation (there are some Apps which send data to a Server which returns the compiled PDF)\n\n*Support for documents splitted in multiple files\n\n*Support for images\n\n\nThe second problem is found a good SVN client\nThe SVN client should allow me to check out a project an do commits and updates.\nHaving a LaTeX Apps which allows me to open and edit the files downloaded with the SVN client would be already great.\nHaving a LaTeX App which integrates SVN support would be a dream.\nDis someone had the same problem? How did you solve it?\n\nA: Please, go to read tweets in Twitter under #texwriter. You can find a lot of this type of questions. Anyway I recommend TexWriter. You may find my writing useful here where I mention my favourite apps and how I write LaTex in iPad -- confessing: I like to use Git instead of SVN, I use DropBox and my laptop for commiting -- I don't know yet any better way for this.\nTeXWriter: Tex -app with builtin compiler\n\nIt is the best app currently in the market although buggy but getting better. I have tested all of them and Texpad and Tex Touch are more slow/buggy -- and without the builtin compiler. TexWriter is the only app with the compiler builtin -- and you can find a growing community around it in Twitter and some here -- we want to make it better!\n\nUse Git instead of SVN\n\nMost cool things appear in Git such as Git-Annex here. Instead of DropBox, this may be a promising candidate. I haven't tested it but it claimns to be some sort of replacement. For now on, you may want to use Git inside DropBox before getting Git-annex -working.\n\n\nA: I found a great SVN client. It is iRepoEditor.\nIt allows us to check out, update and commit from SVN repositories and Dropbox folders.\nIt also provides a basic text editor and the possibility of open files in other Apps and then reimport them. It is not straight forward but it's better than nothing.\n\nA: I have been using scribtex for some time now and am quite satisfied. It is on the web and you are given lots of space free. The editor is not too good but then, if you know enough of Latex, you can write the entire document in Evernote or Plain Text (both free apps for iPad) and then paste it in the scribtex editor and compile it to see the result. All these are free. Like you, I am also a bit skeptical about the paid apps and scribtex is working out quite well for me.\n", "Q: Can I use my PC to mirror an iPod Touch screen like Apple TV? I'm using an iPod Touch 3 and I saw in the AppStore that it is possible to use it as a controller via Apple TV to play games on it like Modern Combat and Real Racing. Because I don't have neither an Apple TV nor a TV, I was wondering if it could be possible to play these games on my computers monitor via bluetooth or wifi. \nIs it is not possible by Apple, maybe there's something in Cydia (under jailbreak) to do this? \n\nA: You could try Reflector for PC:\nYour iPhone or iPad. On your Mac or PC.\n\nAirPlay mirror your iPhone 4S, iPad 2 or the new iPad to any Mac or PC, wirelessly.\n\n", "Q: Can I stop the optical audio out from entering 'time out' when idle? In my office I have a surround-sound receiver, and I have my MacBook Pro (6,1) hooked up via a TOSLink cable and adapter, and it works beautifully, except this: if there are no sounds playing for a short time, the optical out port 'times out', and then the optical signal to the stereo receiver is shut off. \nIt's immediately re-established if something happens to make a sound (I start a song in iTunes, receive an IM or mail, etc) but it takes about 1.5 seconds to sync up with the stereo receiver, so the first 1.5 sec of sound is lost.  After that the optical out port stays up for about  60 seconds, and then goes down again.  So I tend to miss IM/email if I'm not looking at the screen when they come in, which is why I have sound turned on in the first place.  \nObviously I could unplug the TOSLink when not looking at the screen, but this is very inconvenient, and seems silly.  I would prefer the connection to just stay on when idle.  Is there a plist setting buried somewhere to accomplish this?  The system preference pane for optical out is very sparse, reading only \"The selected device has no output controls.\" Presumably this is a power-saving gesture but the Energy Saver Preference pane is similarly devoid of properties for this feature.\nWhere can I find more properties?\n\nA: Playing a one-second silent sound every 50 seconds or so might help. Try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*download 1 second silent .wav file here to desktop (or make your own)\n\n*in Terminal, change Directory to Desktop: cd ~/Desktop/ \n\n*Try the following one-line command and see if your problem is alleviated:\nwhile true; do afplay silence-1sec.wav ; sleep 50; done\n\nThe command above enters an infinite loop which plays the empty sound every 50 seconds. This should keep your output busy. You can exit the loop by pressing ⌘+.\nNB: afplayis frequently overlooked for terminal sound playback, but is hugely useful.\nIf that works, one could convert the command to a command that invisibly runs in the background.\n", "Q: Specifying the keyboard layout for Chinese input I use both Chinese (pinyin) and Japanese (romaji) input and am used to having them mapped to a standard US keyboard layout. However my regional setting is Switzerland since I'm studying here and “internet services may vary according to region”. Strangely, the Japanese input uses the US keyboard layout, but Chinese uses a European layout (not sure what, but z and y are switched). (Irrelevant to problem).\nMy inputs are, in this order:\nEnglish (US)\nGerman\nJapanese (Kotoeri)\nChinese\nAs Tom pointed out, in Kotoeri's preferences the layout can be defined. The Chinese input however uses the last layout of a Latin input, in this case German.\nThere also doesn't seem to be an option to customise the order of these inputs. My workaround is to cycle backwards, but this obviously is a special case. If anyone has a better solution it would be appreciated.\n\nA: You set the Latin keyboard layout for Japanese input in the Kotoeri Preferences.  For Chinese, the IM normally uses the last Latin keyboard layout that you have used.\nSettings you make in the system preferences/language & text/language or formats tab are irrelevant for the keyboard layout.  Only the input sources tab affects that (and Kotoeri preferences when that is chosen as an input source).\n\nA: If it's what I think you're asking, you can set this, but it's really hard to find.  (It's not in the System Preferences app.)\nOn OS X in the Japanese interface, there's no \"Romaji\" input, but based on some screenshots I found, I'm assuming this is \"英字\" (eiji, i.e., halfwidth Latin characters).  All of the Japanese input methods use a system called Kotoeri (ことえり).  When a Kotoeri input method is selected, from the keyboard layout menubar menu in the top right, choose \"環境設定を表示\" (\"Show Preferences\", maybe?), which is indented a bit under a \"Kotoeri\" heading.  (It disappears if you have a non-Kotoeri input method selected.)  There, you can choose a base keyboard input method for Kotoeri to use.\nAlternatively, there's nothing special about the (half-width) Romaji / 英字 characters: they're just Latin characters.  I don't even have this layout enabled.  When I want to type Romaji, I just use my (western) layout.  I can't tell what benefit there might be to using Kotoeri for this.\nSadly, I don't know anything about Chinese, so you're on your own there, but I suspect it has a similarly well-hidden setting.  :-)  I enabled the Chinese keyboard layouts here, and got some extra menuitems in the keyboard layout menu, but nothing that looked quite the same as the Japanese settings.\n", "Q: Clean reinstall of Mountain Lion deleted my iLife applications. How do I get them back? I purchased my 13-inch Macbook Pro in July of 2010. It came with Snow Leopard and allowed for a free upgrade to Lion, which I duly took up.\nI have since purchased Mountain Lion. I decided it was worthwhile doing a clean install of Mountain Lion and did so successfully except for the one (major) hitch -- iLife is not available anymore.\nI've read things in forums that say I should \"accept\" something or other on the Purchases tab in the App Store to get iLife back, but nothing of the sort appears on the Purchases tab.\nHow do I get back the iLife suite? Are they lost without shelling out more money, which seems a ridiculous thing to need to do.\n\nA: This depends on whether your copy of iLife was purchased through the App Store, installed from DVD, or was just the version that came with the MacBook originally. If you had purchased from the App Store, it should be just as easy as going to the app store and redownloading your apps. If not, then you'll either need to reinstall from DVD or purchase the new versions of iLife. Your MacBook should have come with an install DVD for both OS X, and for iLife.\nAnother solution is to use the Migration Assistant and Time Machine to restore your apps. That's by far the easiest way to get all of your old stuff on your new system. Of course, it'll pull in more than just iLife.\nFinally, if you have a Time Machine backup, you can still restore from it. Option-Click on the Time Machine icon at the top right, and choose \"Browse Other Backup Disks\". That will let you get into the backup from your previous setup.\nGood luck!\n\nA: I've just come across the same issue. I've got a 13\" MacBook Pro 2.66GHz C2D (late 2010), I installed an OptiBay kit so I could run an SSD & my HDD. The kit works like a dream, but after a fresh install of Mountain Lion - iLife had disappeared!!\nHowever, a simple re-install from my original iLife DVD did the trick - I just need to download the updates from the App Store once they're recognised.\n\nA: *\n\n*There should have bin an iLife DVD shipped with your MacBook ?\n\n*Otherwise you could copy iLife from a TimeMachine Backup\n\n*Ask someone who has the iLife DVD\n", "Q: How do I set iOS 6 iCal start of week preference to Monday? Since I installed iOS 6 on my iPhone and iPad, iCal shows Sunday as the start of the week, rather than Monday. These iOS iCals are synced over iCloud with iCal on my Mac OS X desktop, which has a General Preference for \"Start week on\" and which I have set to Monday. How do I make a similar setting for the iOS 6 devices?\n\nA: Unfortunately, the region format for Ireland sets the start of the week to Sunday.\nThere's no way to override this other than to set the region format to United Kingdom, which has Monday as the start of the week.\n", "Q: How to replace images in iPhoto with higher quality versions? I use Aperture for photo editing and processing, but prefer iPhoto for keeping a gallery of my pictures. For a long time, I used the built-in tools in iPhoto to \"Import from Aperture Library\". What I didn't know was that this only imports the preview image, which is at a quarter resolution and badly compressed. I now have a couple of years worth of albums with lots of metadata but crappy image quality. I'd like to replace the images with higher-quality versions from Aperture, without losing all of the metadata (tags, descriptions, faces, etc). What's the easiest way to do this?\nRelated question: is it possible to access/change the image data in iPhoto with AppleScript? I can write a script to match images and replace them, if there's a mechanism to do that.\n\nA: Here's how I eventually solved this problem. It took a few steps, and requires some scripting and command line hackery, but it did the trick.\n\n\n*\n\n*Export the pictures you want to update from Aperture to a folder, say ~/Pictures/Updates\n\n*Open the album in iPhoto\n\n*Use this AppleScript to get a list of filenames for the master images\nset output_filename to \"/Users/user/Pictures/album.txt\"\n\ntell application \"iPhoto\"\n    set pics to photos in current album\n    do shell script \"echo \\\"# Current album contents\\\" > \" & output_filename\n    repeat with pic in pics\n        set picpath to image path of pic\n        do shell script \"echo \" & picpath & \" >> \" & output_filename\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\n\n*Using any text editor, save the script below to update_pics.sh and mark it executable (chmod 755 update_pics.sh on the command line)\n#! /bin/bash\n# a quick script to parse in a series of filenames, and update them\n\ninput_folder=\"$1\"\nbackup_folder=\"$2\"\n\nif [ \"$#\" -ne 2 ]; then\n        echo \"Usage: $0 [folder with new images] [folder for backups]\"\n        exit 0\nfi\n\nif [ ! -d \"$input_folder\" ]; then\n        echo \"Can't read input follder $input_folder\"\n        exit -1\nfi\n\nif [ ! -d \"$backup_folder\" ]; then\n        mkdir -p \"$backup_folder\"\nfi\n\nif [ ! -d \"$backup_folder\" -o ! -w \"$backup_folder\" ]; then\n        echo \"Can't write to backup folder $backup_folder\"\n        exit -1\nfi\n\nwhile read line; do\n\n        # skip empty lines or comments\n        [ -z \"$line\" -o \"${line:0:1}\" = \"#\" ] && continue\n\n        if [ -f \"$line\" ]; then\n                filename=`basename \"$line\"`\n                input_file=\"$input_folder/$filename\"\n                cp \"$line\" \"$backup_folder\"\n                if [ -f \"$input_file\" ]; then\n                        echo \"Replacing $filename\"\n                        cp \"$input_file\" \"$line\"\n                else\n                        echo \"Could not find input file $input_file\"\n                fi\n        else\n                echo \"$line does not exist\"\n        fi\ndone\n\n\n*To use the script, give it the location of the updated pictures, a folder to put backups (I'm paranoid of losing data) and then pipe in the file generated before. For example:\nupdate_pics.sh Updates/ Backups/ < album.txt\n\n\n*If you haven't already, close iPhoto. Then restart it while holding down Option and Command. That should give you a dialog to rebuild the iPhoto. You should only need to rebuild the thumbnails, though you may want to rebuild everything else. More info on rebuilding the iPhoto Library from Apple\niPhoto will probably take a long time to rebuild the thumbnails, since it will redo all of them. You have a number of albums to do, it's probably best to update the pictures first, album-by-album, and then rebuild the library. That's what I did, and it worked pretty well.\n", "Q: Import and create iPhoto Event from folder name I would like to automatically import a folder to iPhoto (eg. with Automator). The Event Name should be the name of the folder with the images.\nIs this possible with automator?\n\nA: In addition, this is the default behavior if you simply drop the folder onto the iPhoto icon. There is no direct need to make an Automator action unless you are doing this for many many folders.\n\nA: Yes it is. \nSee below workflow that I did.\n\nYou may need to get the additional automator actions. You can get them here: \nhttp://www.automatedworkflows.com\n", "Q: Upgrade to new MBP with OS X without reinstalling applications? I hope someone can help with some basic advice: \nMy wife has used a MacBook Pro since 2006, and I want to get her a new one, or at least a newer refurb. She has OS X 10.6.3 and wants to install it over the older system. She has so much data, she doesn't want to have to reinstall everything (she's pretty clueless technically).\nCan she reliably install the new OS over the old one without major corruption/glitch hassles (I’m a Windows guy and in Windows, this is never very wise; I always just backup, format and do a clean install of everything).\nIs this a wise strategy, to try to upgrade the old MBP first, then clone it onto the newer MBP?\n\nA: The new MBP will come with Mountain Lion pre-installed. To update the old MBP, you probably need a different source of Mountain Lion. The easier solution might be either making a backup of the old MBP with Time Machine or using the Migration Assistant of Mac OS. \nWith the Migration Assistant, you can transfer data and applications from the old MBP to the new one. You can start the Migration Assistant from Spotlight. Click the magnifier in the menu bar, enter Migration Assistant and hit enter. This will start a guided process to get the data to the new MBP. If you buy the new MBP at an Apple store, they might assist you in doing this.\nIf you prefer the backup idea, you need to get an external hard drive and connect it to the old MBP. Open System Preferences, click on Time Machine, select the external hard drive as your backup drive and turn Time Machine on. \nWhen the backup is finished, eject the backup drive (you can do this in the Finder) and connect it to the new MBP. You can then restore user data and applications from the backup to the new MBP. Make sure the Time Machine icon is shown in the menu bar, click the icon, and choose Browse other Backup Disks. This way you can copy specific data and applications to the new computer. \nAFAIK it is not possible to switch hardware in a MBP nowadays.\n\nA: You can do a TimeMachine backup from your old machine and use this on your new machine. That worked very well and uncomplicated for me. Kept every setting and programm and unpgraded everything without problems.\nEdit: Just plug in a big external harddrive and start the TimeMachine Application. When it's done plug it into the new Macbook and restore it from the backup. Then you can just proceed with the upgrade. If something goes wrong (I don't think it will happen but who knows?) you still have the backup. :)\n", "Q: Can I automatically remove my signature from all replies? Mail 6.2 OS x 10.8.2 In OS X Mail.app (version 6.2 from OS X 10.8.2), I can see how to automatically add a signature for all new messages, but I do not want it automatically added when I reply to a message. Is there a way to achieve this?\n\nA: Not sure if anyone ever answered this. I came here looking for a solution which was ever so simple. \nOpen Mail.app, go to Mail -> Preferences or use the key-combo Command,\nSelect the Tab that says 'Signatures' and uncheck the box that says to have the 'signature' above quoted text.\n\nA: Unfortunately, I do not believe this is possible in Mac Mail. I have been seeking a similar solution for a while, and I've yet to discover one.\nThere are ways you can make it a little easier to manually add and remove the signatures you want. For example, you can set your default signature to None, but then manually add your signature for all new emails. This preference is controlled under Mail > Preferences > Signatures. (To access this preference, you must select a mail account that the signature preference will be applied to in the leftmost pane. The box will not be clickable if All Signatures is chosen in the left pane.)\n\nFor me, this works acceptably - I reply to many more emails threads than I send new emails - but it may be different for your workflow. \nTurning off Place signature above quoted text directly below the default signature selection box may also help. It doesn't remove the signature from the email entirely - instead, it separates the signature from the main body of your reply and appends it to the end of the email, after all quoted material. This will lead to many signatures all ganged up at the bottom of an email - one for each of your replies. \n\nWhile the signature is still included in the message, choosing to place the signature after the quoted text may achieve the effect you are hoping for, as many email recipients will read all the way to the bottom of the quoted text in each reply to see the signature. It does not remove it entirely, however.\nAs you know, Outlook 2011 offers this feature on the Mac. I have heard that Mozilla Thunderbird supplies this functionality as well, but I cannot confirm that myself. \n", "Q: how to get google search history back in safari 6 I am very annoyed about safari 6 doing away with the google search history. Is there anyway to get it back? Just to be clear I am talking about when you google something and then you need to go back to that same search. In safari 5 you could click on the the arrow in the google search bar and it would give you a drop down menu of all your latest google searches.\n\nA: Within a new window or tab, clicking on the magnifying glass will drop down the recent searches menu.\n\nThis menu will drop dow, too, if you just type a space or empty the search bar by deleting. \n", "Q: My seagate disk that was detectable earlier is now showing SMART status \"not supported\".

What options do I have now?\nI have already verified but i get the error invalid b-tree node size. \nThanks .\n\nA: I haven't seen an external drive where SMART was supported, so you can probably ignore that aspect and just focus on the rest of the information you can obtain about the drive's health.\n\nA: If you have turned on FileVault2 on the external drive, that will disable SMART support and give the \"not supported\" message.\n", "Q: USB device drawing too much power resulting in whining fan noise I have suddenly started getting the error message and exactly the same time there is now a loud fan noise on the left side of my Mac Book Air.\nI have tried the safe boot mode I have seen on other threads and the message has gone but the noise is still there.\nEverything also now loads really slowly.

I use Preview on OS X and GoodReader on the iPad for reading and annotating pdfs. GoodReader allows me to 'view summary' which is a plain text list of all highlighted sections and comments added to the pdf.\nPreview allows you to view annotations in a sidebar but I can't find a way to export them. I really want to create a .txt file of just the pdf's annotations.\nDoes anyone know of a way of doing this, either with Preview or another app whose annotations can be viewed on GoodReader and vice versa?\n\nA: I'll second that answer. I'm doing the same with PDF Expert instead of GoodReader. It is really important that you do the conversion in Skim on a COPY of the original PDF, as otherwise the PDF expert (or GoodReader, I assume) will lose the annotations, once converted (e.g., if you have your PDFs in Dropbox, which you then open either on the iPad or Mac). There is a slightly more elegant solution though. It's trivial but it avoids making a copy of the PDF:\nOpen the annotated PDF in Skim, convert to Skim notes, export notes to text or RTF, an then close Skim without saving. Your original PDF with notes will stay unconverted (and thus still annotated for GoodReader), but you will have your notes and highlights exported and saved. \nAs I said, trivial...\n\nA: You may want to have a look at the \"PDFs>Extract PDF Annotations\" Automator action.\n\nA: There is a really simple yet robust online tool for extracting highlights and notes from your PDF files available at: sumnotes.\nNot only does it support various advanced features like selective extraction or predictive extraction, it also allows you to save extracted highlights into TXT or DOC files. It supports all browsers and operating systems and does not need any installation. It's free, too.\n\nA: As a workaround, I've found this:\nAnnotate with Preview or GoodReader. On the iPad, GoodReader can extract the text of annotations, when you select 'view summary'. This summary can be saved as a txt file.\n[Update: GoodReader seems to have removed 'view summary' in .txt format for some unfathomable reason. A workaround (at least for me) is to use the free service, Send to DropBox. You simply select 'email summary', and the annotations appear in a email message. Send this to your Send to DropBox mail address, and you have a .txt file with your annotations. In may ways, if you use DropBox, this is easier because it cuts out the step of uploading the .txt]\nOn OS X, I've downloaded Skim. I can open an copy of a pdf annotated in Preview or GoodReader, then convert the annotations to .skim format by selecting file>convert notes. Having done this, I can select file>export and there's an option to export notes as a txt file.\nIf anyone can come up with a more elegant solution, I'd be very interested to hear it.\n\nA: I tried Automator, bur it does not seem to be able to extract notes, it sees that there are highlights and lists them, but does not extract their content. I tried Skim, and it only works with some of the highlights, not all, so not good enough unfortunately.\nI eventually fond an app that works very well and has nice features too, highlights app available on the app store.\nUnfortunately it's priced at 29.99€ in EU.\nToo bad Apple didn't build this feature into Preview...\nIf anyone knows how to get Automator to work, or if anything needs to be set up in Preview before attempting to extract highlights, that would be very precious information.\n(OS X.11.6)\n\nA: Here's an app that should work. Just a matter of opening it and then either opening a PDF with the file menu or drag-and-dropping a PDF onto the dock icon.\nAnd here's the source code (XCode project).\n\nAlso, not even sure if this one works but before knowing about the features in Quartz I made a command line tool.\nIt's just that the encoding doesn't work yet so some characters don't get processed well (it was good enough in my case).\nTo make it run, put the binary in a folder, put the PDF there too, navigate to the folder in a Terminal window :\n\ncd folder_name\n\nThen run :\n\nextract_notes my_pdf.pdf > notes.txt\n\nSource code (also an XCode project) here.\n\nA: Well, you can always hit Cmd Z or Edit > Undo.

Of course you should repeat this step for write and execute permissions (just replace -u=r and -g=r with, respectively, -u=w and -g=w for write, -u=x and -g=x for execute).\n\n*Finally, I think that if you want to be able to navigate to the sub directory from your account, then you need to make the full path to your sub directory searchable by everyone. That means, run through chmod o+x '/Users/Wife/Library', chmod o+x '/Users/Wife/Library/Application Support', chmod '/Users/Wife/Library/Application Support/iLifeAssetManagement' and chmod o+x '/Users/Wife/Library/Application Support/iLifeAssetManagement/assets'\nThat should do the job: new files in sub should inherit group ownership (MeAndWife) and permissions (same as owning user). If you find that that is not the case, you could use launchd in conjuction with a very simple script to fix file permissions periodically (say, hourly).\n\nA: Not sure whether on OSX you are supposed to state explicitly list,search for directories. Strictly speaking, read/write/execute/append do not apply to directories, only to files.\n\n\nbmike: This seems both wrong and not an answer. Of course permissions affect directories and directories are just a type of files. Can you improve this or should it just be deleted?\n\n@bmike: of course standard UNIX permissions do apply to both files and directories irrespectively. But ACL's do not. Just have a look at man chmod: you will then realize that there are\n\n\n*\n\n*actions for both files and directories (delete, [read]/[write]&[ext]attr, <read>/<write>&security, chown)\n\n*actions for directories only (list, search, add_&[file]/[subdirectory], delete_child)\n\n*actions for files only ([read]/[write]/[append], execute), as well as\n\n*inheritance flag for directories only ([file]/[directory]&[limit]/[only]&_inherit)\n\n\nSo this proves that the answer is not wrong.\nIs this an answer, btw? Yes it is, in that it hints that the user is not giving the directory the proper ACE's.\nAfter all, I think that the user's question and bmike's comment point out to the fact that ACL's are tricky and somewhat misunderstood. Personally, I dropped them completely, and reverted to using standard UNIX perms wherever possible.\nThis leads me to suggesting the user an alternative approach, which is what I will do in a separate answer.\n", "Q: What's the 'unique device identifier' (UDID) of a non-iOS device like a Macbook Pro running Mac OS X? I wanted to know if the Hardware Serial Number associated with a Macbook Pro is itself treated as a UDID, or is there something else that uniquely identifies the device?\n\nI'll provide a little bit of context that's not completely required but might be useful for those wanting to understand my motivations behind the question, otherwise skip to the last paragraph.\n\nIt's been 21 days since my Macbook Pro [mid-2010] running Mountain\n  Lion was stolen. Despite having several software based\n  tracking/geo-locating bugs installed on my Disk, it hasn't showed up\n  on find my mac or any other service that would have sent me an IP\n  if/when my device accessed the internet [assuming it wasn't wiped].\n  That really leaves only two options, either my Macbook was never\n  [inexplicably] used to access the internet since the theft, or it has\n  been used to access the internet after my hard-disk was wiped. Since I\n  had no firmware based tracking that would report to me, it seems clear\n  that it's no longer inevitable that I shall get some information in\n  the future from my device communicating with me directly.\n\nAssuming the worst, either my hard-disk was wiped or completely replaced with a new one. There is one kind of information, that I am currently aware of, that is definitely still communicated to the Apple servers each time a connection is made to the internet. The helpd service or other apple system modules send anonymous information to swscan.apple.com etc. This anonymous information probably contains the device's hardware serial number along with other details like the OS version etc. Am I incorrect to assume this? Is this hardware serial number unique or unchangeable? I remember my entire chipsets being replaced and still having the same serial number. Where exactly physically, is this Serial? Would taking apart the Mac keep the Hardware serial? Or is there something else that Apple devices communicate to their servers to identify themselves?\nI am wondering if this is how UDID is logged, then it's in a database somewhere and then I only need to contact the concerned authorities (law enforcement etc.) to obtain this non-personally identifying information and see if my hardware is still around or if it has been sold as metal scrap. \nThanks in advance.

But only just today did the VIP mailbox show up in Mail. I'd like to get rid of it. But apparently there is no way to get rid of it.\nBut that seems odd, since it only first showed up today, for no reason I can discover. For some reason it had an \"Angieslist\" subfolder, but with nothing in it.\nVery odd. Annoying too.\n\nA: What most likely happened is, somehow, you clicked on a star icon which appears just to the right of the senders name. I've done this myself, more than once, thinking it was a bookmark / favorite button.\nThat star sets the sender as a VIP – an easy way to filter emails from important contacts, which is really what the VIP under the hood.\nThe reason it was empty is, I assume, because there were no Angielist emails in your inbox.\nTo remove, and I'm assuming you found this already, is by control-clicking on the name in the VIP list and selecting Remove VIP. Restart Mail once and the VIP sidebar item should be gone for good.\n\nA: *\n\n*Remove all VIPs if there are any.\n\n*Make sure VIP folder is not the current one. Otherwise restarting Mail won't help.\n\n*Restart Mail.\n\n\nA: I originally thought that quitting Mail and restarting would get rid of the VIP folder. So I tried that several times. No luck.\nHowever, eventually after quitting Mail for the n-th time, after restarting it, the VIP folder has finally disappeared on its own.\nSo it seems the way to get rid of it is to get rid of all of the sub-folders, then quit and restart Mail n times.\nSo I am thinking this might be the answer to the question.\n\nA: *\n\n*Look at the mailboxes\n\n*Click on VIP mailbox (it will show the VIP senders)\n\n*Control-Click on each VIP sender's star and remove it\n\n*When last sender is removed the mailbox disappears\n\n", "Q: Installing wine with osxwinebuilder I try to install wine with osxwinebuilder.

I have two photos of a group of ten people. Unfortunately, one person has the eyes closed in each photo. \nI would like to merge one person from one photo into the other so that everyone's eyes are open in one picture.\nAre there any tools or applications that are provided with OS X by default that will allow me to do this?\n\nA: You don't need anything special at all, you already have the tools you need to give it a go - frankly it's worth a pop in Preview.\nI'll have a quick and dirty go in this answer and see how we go.  I've taken 2 photos, one with my eyes open, and one with them shut.  I will transfer the eyes from one to the other to create a composite picture of the two.  Excuse the poor quality, but they are taken from my webcam in a dimly lit room:\nEyes Open:\n\nEyes Shut:\n\nOpening the picture I want to copy from (just double clicking it should use Preview as the default app on most systems) ensure first that you have the correct edit tool bar showing, and select the elliptical select tool:\n\n\nNow, draw a nice oval around one eye, starting in the top left and moving right and down.  If you get it wrong, just single click anywhere outside the selection and start again.  Repeat until you have got a good outline of the eye.  You can fine tune by grabbing the handles on the selection tool and moving them a little:\n\nNow simply copy this selection, open up the other picture, and paste it in, moving it to the required position (and potentially resizing a tiny bit if required).  To remove the selection marks, click anywhere outside them to \"set\" the paste.  If it's not in the right position, click undo, and paste again:\n\nRepeat with the other eyes, and here is a finished composite:\n\nTop tips:\n\n\n*\n\n*This works better with smaller snippets, obviously the more closeup it is, the more accurate your cropping has to be and the more obvious the effect is.\n\n*Your photos need to be pretty similar in terms of lighting, zoom levels etc to get a consistent look.\n\n*Zoom in if required to get more accurate selections.\n\n*If it's a group shot as you say, then chances are everyone's face is quite small unlike my full face image example, and any imperfections are less likely to be spotted\n\n*Keep your selections as small as possible, copying a couple of eyes is going to be easier and look better than trying to move a whole head, or person.\n\n*Other software will provide for more complex features like smoothing the joins over to reduce any hard lines where the colouring is marginally different etc\n\n*If you had to copy say a piece of eyebrow in order to get the whole eye, and it will not line up in the new picture, then use an intermediate empty picture file, paste it in, cut out the bit you don't want, re-copy it and carry on.\n\n\nA: There is nothing unique to the Mac environment here.  You will need a photo editing program in order to do this, which would be the same on a Windows machine or any other platform.\nPixelmater is a very popular image editor, and one that I use.  It has many features that rival Photoshop.\nAcorn is another popular editor, again that I've used in the past.\nPhotoshop is, of course, available too.\nThere is no magic feature in any of these (or any I didn't post) that will do the work for you.  You will need to cut and paste portions of one picture into another and hope they line up... or do additional manipulation on the images to make them appear natural.\n", "Q: OS X 10.8 seems to break printer communications Anyone using a Kodak ESP 7250 with OS X 10.8?

If you can rework your script to take a password via stdin, you could use an AppleScript wrapper to get a password dialog, if that's what you're hoping for.\nIf you rework your pgpsign script to take a password from stdin, you can use an Applescript action (with some shell scripting embedded) to display a password dialog and get the results you desire.\nReplace your Run Shell Script action in your current workflow with a Run AppleScript action, with the following code:\non run {input, parameters}\n    set thePath to quoted form of POSIX path of first item of input as string\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        display dialog \"Password:\" default answer \"\" with hidden answer\n    end tell\n    set pass to text returned of result\n    do shell script \"cd \" & thePath & \"; echo \" & quoted form of pass & \" | perl -ne 'chomp and print' | ~/scripts/pgpsign\"\nend run\n\nIt's not the most straightforward, so I'll run through line by line what it's doing.\non run {input, parameters}\n    set thePath to quoted form of POSIX path of first item of input as string\n\nThis gets the input from the service (the folder you selected) and turns it into a string that the shell script can make use of.\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    display dialog \"Password:\" default answer \"\" with hidden answer\nend tell\nset pass to text returned of result\n\nThis pops up a password dialog and stores the result to the pass variable. Ordinarily in AppleScript you don't need the System Events tell portion, but because of some quirks with Automator, it's required here.\ndo shell script \"cd \" & thePath & \"; echo \" & quoted form of pass & \" | perl -ne 'chomp and print' | ~/scripts/pgpsign\"\n\nThis ties it all together and sends the required parameters to your script. First we change to the selected directory (to answer your question in the comments, as your script is written, it is necessary to first cd to the directory you want). Then echo is used to send the password to stdin, and it's piped through the perl portion to strip the trailing newline (which is an annoying characteristic of AppleScript and would otherwise cause a valid password to fail), then piped to your script.\nSorry for giving you a lot to digest, but if you want to use Automator for this, it's probably the easiest way, unless you want to hardcode your password (which is obviously inadvisable for security reasons).\n", "Q: I cannot get past an \"unknown problem\" error when trying to login to discussions.apple.com I have noticed that when I try to post to any forum threads on https://discussions.apple.com it fails.\n\n\n*\n\n*I type my Apple ID details at the login page.\n\n*Then I am prompted to reconfirm the details for security.\n\n*I am then told there has been an unknown problem.\n\n*I am given the option to manage my Apple ID.\n\n*When I click the button to do this, I am prompted to type in my login details.\n\n*After I do this I have to delete the email address that is in the box and retype it otherwise I will go back to the unknown error.\n\n\nOnce I am at the manage page and have logged in, I load a seperate tab and try to visit the threads I visited earlier but I am prompted again to enter my username and password - which I can not get passed.\nI would have assumed that there was a possible malware issue on my Mac but the same happens on both my iPad and iPhone.

Use Disk Utility to format the hard disk with HFS+ file system and go to TimeMachine preferences, you should now be able to use it.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro RAM upgrade is causing beeping sound? I just upgraded the RAM in my MacBook Pro (15\" 2 GHz Intel Core i7 - early 2011 model) from two 2gb modules to two 4gb modules. Started up just fine and ran great for about 10 minutes. Then the screen froze and the computer started beeping. After some google searches I found that it is caused by either a) bad RAM or b) the RAM is inserted incorrectly. My guess is that the computer shouldn't start if it's bad RAM. Others online report their computers beeping on startup. I tried repositioning the RAM to make sure it's in tight. The same thing happened.\nThe computer recognizes the RAM - it shows up in About My Mac. The RAM is Corsair 8gb 1333 MHz DDR3.\nWhat's going on?\n\nA: How many beeps are you hearing. A discussion thread on Apple's site suggests that 3 beeps is a sign of a bad memory bank. So maybe the connection is solid enough to display in About this Mac but \"loose\" enough for the MBP to see properly use the RAM? Trying to think of a better way to phrase that last bit.\n\nA: I have experienced a similar problem and sent my memory modules back in to crucial to get replaced. \nThe memory worked fine for a while but then I had it happen again to me last week.\nI have a mid 2012 macbook pro with i5 and integrated graphics. I also have my computer hooked up to a monitor through the mini display port.\nI have found that when I have mac hooked to monitor and either sleep or shut down while it is connected to the monitor and unhook it and try to power it up I will get the beeps. The only way to fix this is to open computer and remove memory modules and then reboot. Its something to do with the mac handling of the memory when attached to a different display, and then trying to power up the computer without the display attached anymore. The computer still thinks it is attached to screen and when I try to power up from the laptop display the computer does not know how to start.\nI have fixed this problem by:  \n\n\n*\n\n*opening the laptop while still attached to monitor \n\n*disconnecting the mini display cable from the mac\n\n*powering down the computer from laptop display\n\n\nThis has solved my memory beep problem. It might be helpful to try a purge of your memory in case the OSX is having problems handling the off market memory modules. Open terminal, type into terminal, \"sudo purge\", and then it will ask you to enter your admin password. This will clear out the processes that might be stuck in your memory. However, OSX should be able to do this on its own. \nIf your computer is running and the screen starts changing colors or just freezes and you have to do a force restart (followed by memory beeps) you will need to go to crucial website and do a warranty exchange. All RAM has a lifetime limited warranty. You can complete an online return RMA at: crucial.com\nHope this helps\n\nA: I had the same three beeps with my Early 2008 iMac when I tried to go from 2 to 4 RAM. Making sure the door that you had to screw off to access the RAM is very tightly screwed back in fixed it for me.\n\nA: I'm sure there is an Apple support page about the beeps, each of which means something, they're not to be ignored. But I wouldn't be so sure about your assumptions--my guess is, you've got bad/questionable RAM. Or, alternately, more RAM than the machine specifies--or a kind whose specs are slightly off.\nYou could try one chip at a time, also switching slots.\n\nA: i also installed corsair memory into a early 2011 Mac Pro.ran for 10 minutes and began beeping 3 x.i removed it and ran 1 slot with no problems for a day. switched postions and added the other one. ran 12 hours under heavy applications,then crashed. it corrupts my aperture files i won't do it it again  waiting to here from corsair .i'm afraid i'll be eating the memory though.\n\nA: Three tones in a series that repeats is universally a \"Memory Problem\" detected during power-on-self-test (POST).\nHere are two support articles covering the general test and iMac codes (which match most recent Mac model POST firmware.\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel-based Mac Power On Self Test RAM error codes - HT2341 \n\n*iMac (Mid 2007) and later models: About startup tones- HT2538 look for your model in the Products Affected as this covers many things later than that iMac even though the title seems misleadingly about iMacs only to me\n\n*Intel-based Mac: Startup sequence and error codes, symbols -  HT2674 provides a nice description of when each test runs so you can diagnose boot problems by observing sounds and screen transitions from black to user loginwindow\n\n\nA: I have also experienced this problem with my iMac. There was a simple way I was able to fix it in the end.\nAll I had to do was switch around the different memory boards into different slots. For some bizarre reason once I had the 'right' card and slot combination the computer switched on and has worked fine ever since!\nHope this helps some of you out there if you are panicking as much as I was about your hardware.\n", "Q: Cannot add keyboard shortcuts in Mountain Lion As of an unknown moment, I cannot add custom keyboard shortcuts anymore. Isn't there supposed to be an add button somewhere here? \n\nA: On the screenshot the panel with more choices is completely withdrawn (on the left).

To do so, you must, first check the shortcut, enabling it, then you'll be able to double-click the shortcut and, holding down the new keys, change it to a new one.\n", "Q: iPhone 4S with GPS and GLONASS receiver I have a little understanding of GLONASS receiver and together with GPS, it's more accurate than the phones equipped only with A-GPS. \nHere you have a video which compares A-GPS only iPhone 4 with iPhone 4S that has A-GPS+GLONASS. My question is, if I buy an iPhone 4S (as iPhone 5 Maps in India is next to useless), will I be able to see my current location on an offline map if both these receivers are present? (say for example CityMapsToGo)\nNokia is claiming the same with its Lumia 820 and 920, as it is equipped with both GPS and GLONASS receivers.\n\"These two smartphones also include autonomous assisted GPS and GLONASS receivers. In plain English, this means that you can see yourself on a map within seconds, even when you’re offline.\"\n\nA: GPS and GLONASS are almost the same things, one operated from the USA and the other from Russia, respectively. The differences are too technical for this question and I won’t get into them.\nAlso, if your new iPhone 4S ships with iOS 6, you won’t be able to downgrade to iOS 5.\nAnd yes, you can see your location in offline maps.\n", "Q: Can I fix things so Archive Utility doesn't hang on all zip files? I am using Mac OS X 10.8.2. I don't know exactly when it started (might have been after the upgrade to 10.8.2, but not sure), but now, any zip file I try to open starts up 'Archive Utility', but then it just hangs and I have to force quit it. The zip file is never unzipped.\nAs a workaround, I can go to the command line and use the 'unzip' command, but that is not very convenient.\nCan I re-install this application to see if that would help or is this part of the OS and thus cannot really be re-installed separately?\n\nA: It's related to the Apple Events bug in 10.8.2 that also makes revealing files in Finder stop working.\nAs a workaround, you can terminate the appleeventsd process with sudo killall appleeventsd sudo killall -KILL appleeventsd. (Without -KILL the process is sent a TERM signal and many processes stop responding as @myhd described.)\n\nA: I have run into this a couple times, both in instances where I didn't have time to dig into the cause. A restart will recover from the underlying failure between finder and apple events server so that you can unzip files, but that's not ideal since the underlying condition is likely to be triggered again. \nAs it has become clear that an OS bug is causing the hang, I keep a copy of the free app The Unarchiver in my Application folder.\n", "Q: Outlook: How to move all mail from a certain recipient into Junk How can I force Outlook to move all incoming messages with certain recipient to the Junk folder?\n\nA: Open Outlook (2011) Junk > Email protection. \nAdd the sender manually to the list.\n\nor simply do this and select BLOCK sender.\n\n", "Q: Upgrade processor iMac (mid 2010 specifically) I have a mac from mid 2010.\nI want to know if I can upgrade the processor from the current 3.6 Ghz dual core i3 processor to a quad core i5 or i7.\nThere seems to be very little information on the subject on the internet, with most people saying \"OMG IT VOIDZ YOUR WARRANTYZ\". My warranty has been expired for the best part of 6 months now, so I don't really care about it.\nI want to know - Can I buy a quad core i5 or i7, take out the current i3, replace it with the new i5/i7 and have the computer still work? Are all processors the same size/fitting? Is my motherboard/hardware/bios/firmware/software compatible with a different processor?\nMy reasoning is that this would be a much cheaper way to upgrade my current computer, rather than splashing out for a new computer.\nThanks\n\nA: Yes, it is possible. By that I mean it is not physically soldered onto the logic board. However, as you mentioned, it will void your warranty. More importantly, Apple has not divulged the inner hardware workings of their system. Since Apple makes the logic board, and does not simply order stock motherboards, we do not know the exact number of chipsets that each physical board is designed to support. I have also heard that Intel sometimes will make the number of pins on Apple processors just slightly different than the PC version of the same processor.\nAll of that said, while it may be possible, it is not advisable, because messing up during an undocumented, unsupported process is more expensive than buying the new system.\n\nA: I would definitely give it a try when you definitely want to upgrade - I mean: why not? Okay, it's a Mac, but I don't get the point why someone shouldn't upgrade or repair a Mac?  Only because a lot of people who don't know much about computers prefer a Mac over Windows  OS computer due to its simpler interface (and more uniform hardware) does not mean no one is allowed to touch it.\nI never upgraded the processor so far (only RAMs and HD/SSDs), but I think this might be a good instruction for you. I guess this was something you were looking for...and yes, it looks like it is possible - even simple...but attention to the last sentence \"Please note : Warranty is void with this step.\" ;)\nhttp://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Upgrade+iMac+Intel+Core+i3+CPU+to+Core+i7/8670/1\n", "Q: OS X Mail.app: Old mail not downloading/showing after reconfiguring exchange account Context: Mail.app in OS X 10.7.5, connecting to MS Exchange Server 2007.\nFor whatever reason, my company has two domains where I can access the Exchange server. I was using one of them, but for some reason address book sync was broken.\nI closed Mail.app, Addressbook.app and iCal.app, deleted the old account, and created a new one that used the other domain. This fixed syncing the address book.\nUnfortunately, while my calendar came back safe and sound, the same can't be said for the mail account. All my new mail is arriving fine, all the folders are shown, but old mail is not being shown in the message list pane for any of the folders. Clicking \"Get new messages for all accounts\" button does nothing whatsoever.\nHowever, if I open the Account Info dialog from the context menu of one of the folders, it does show the correct message count and size. The messages are also available on the IMAP bridge that Thunderbird is using on another machine, and on webmail. So they are clearly still there.\nWhy would Mail.app not download/show the old messages, and how do I fix that?\n\nA: The 'find the answer to your question 5 minutes after asking it' syndrome strikes again: using the Mailbox menu's Rebuild command fixes the issue. You can select all the folders for which this needs to happen before using the menu item to save yourself some time (but beware that all this syncing might take a long time if you've got a big mailbox).\n", "Q: OSX server 10.6 and umask I'm trying to set up our server so that file permissions make sense. We have a mac mini running OSX 10.6.7. Through our desktop Macs, we connect to shared folders on that server and save files on it, in Finder, TextEdit, etc.\nI've set up a umask, as documented here. However, this only works from terminal/finder directly on the server. If I save a file to the server using a connected desktop, it doesn't work.\nAny ideas on how I can resolve this?\n\nA: umask is a user- and process-specific setting and can be overridden. Setting a umask on the server does not affect any clients that accessing the shared folder - each of them will use their own default file creation permissions.\nIf you want to set default permissions on a shared folder, the answer is to use Access Control Lists (ACLs), which are much more flexible.\n\n\n*\n\n*Here's a somewhat terse support article from Apple on setting up ACLs in Snow Leopard Server.\n\n*And here's a slightly friendlier guide.\n\n", "Q: How do I delete items in my itunes download queue? \nPossible Duplicate:\nDelete a purchased file from ITunes Download Queue without downloading file \n\nI have some episodes of a TV program in itunes (on my ipad) that I didn't download for a long time.

I have configured the proxy in the network system preferences, and all of my web browsers (Safari, Chrome, Firefox) are using these settings, but Mail.app doesn't seem to.\nI've tried to connect to an IMAP server, but the request always times out. When I check using netstat, I can see that Mail.app is trying to directly connect to the IMAP server without going through the proxy.\nIs there a way to force Mail.app to go through the proxy?\nThis is on Snow Leopard.\n\nA: Use ProxyCap. Add there a \"redirect\" rule for the Mail.app bundle. \nNote that a regular HTTP proxy will not work for Mail.app. You will need one of the following: SOCKS, SSH.\n\nA: If you have ssh access to the machine you want to be a proxy, you can also do ssh -D 12345 proxy.server.com and configure your computer to use SOCKS proxy, using localhost and 12345 as proxy host and ports in the settings, accordingly. Obviously you can specify a different port, but it's best to keep it higher than 1024. \nThe -D option for ssh enables a built in SOCKS proxy, which you can use then to send all other traffic through. Please bear in mind that the traffic from terminal (telnet, ssh) will NOT go through the SOCKS proxy regardless of how you configure your network settings. \nI would have uploaded relevant screenshots, but unfortunately the internet connection I use here is very slow - 256kbps satellite link, shared by around 50 people and a host of experiments! \n", "Q: How can I stop iPhoto from uploading my videos to Facebook automatically?

I already have a thunderbolt display and I tried connecting a Dell Ultrasharp with 2560x1440 to the HDMI port of the mac mini - that doesn't work.  There is a spare Thunderbolt port on the back of the Apple display, so do I use that and connect to the Dell?  If so, what port on the Dell do I use to get the full resolution - HDMI, DVI, Ethernet?\n\nA: HDMI is out because the Mac Mini's HDMI port maxes out at 1920x1200. You're going to need to grab an adapter to go from Mini-Displayport to either dual-link DVI or Displayport, which are both supported by the Dell.\nNow, the Thunderbolt display can't directly output Mini-Displayport for boring technical reasons (see question 20). There must be a non-display Thunderbolt device between the display and the adapter I mentioned above.

I note that on the loudest volume, the sound from my iPhone to 3.5mm stereo jack is distorted. Above what volume is sound distorted/compressed?\n\nA: This question might be hard to answer without some rigorous definition of distortion and qualification of what amount of harmonic distortion is permissible - let alone some clue as to what signal is being played. \nIn general, the headphone jack is desired to distort sound. Whether its muted or amplified, the output isn't what the recorded sound actually is. \nHave a look at these threads fr background:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why do I get \"no volume available\" when using an iPhone 4s in a dock?\n\n*Stop high frequency noise from iPhone dock's line out in car adapter\nSo - you could get an adapter that generates a line-out level signal and control things from another amplifier or you could experiment with signals you choose and find a setting that doesn't sound distorted to your ears. My guess is most people would set the volume a 60% for most commercial pop music and perhaps a little higher for softer music that isn't compressed so aggressively as pop music. \n\nA: If you're connecting to a device which is expecting a standard line-in audio signal then keep your output volume to 75%-80% maximum as anything over this is going over the 1volt peak to peak signal which consumer audio works on. Your headphones are different as they are not limited in this way and you should be able to send a 100% signal to them without distortion.\n", "Q: Blank page removal tool for PDF? A command line tool is preferred, but not required.\nPreview and PDF Pen and dozens of other apps can delete arbitrary pages from a PDF file and save the result. The key problem I can’t solve is how to systematically detect a blank page and have it deleted. Blank is defined as no visible line or text or content.\nDo you know of any tool that can detect and remove blank pages from a multi-page PDF file and be controlled by automation (script / Automator / something other than click, look, click)?\n\nA: Here are a few tools I found on the web. I haven't used them, so I can't comment on how well they might work for you.\nA-PDF Scan Optimizer has an option for detecting and removing pages with not many visible marks.\nthe CoolUtils TIFF PDF Cleaner \"detects blank pages in TIFF and PDF files and deletes them\". \nEdocfile's Blank Page Remover has the effect of deleting blank pages from a PDF file, though it's intended for use with a scanner and a printer as a way of converting a document with mixed single- and double-sided sheets into a document with all single- or double-sided sheets. \nAxpertsoft's PDF Page Remover can remove blank pages from multiple PDF files at a single command.\nAll these requires Windows of some flavour, so I hope you have a virtual machine on your Mac.\n", "Q: iTunes 10.7: Does listening to songs change their mp3-files? I use iTunes to listen to music and I use Wuala to backup my mp3-files. Before recent versions of iTunes, I never had any problem with that.\nBut with more recent versions (I don't know when it started, but the problem definitely occurs in the current version 10.7), there is a problem: Whenever I listen so a song on iTunes, Wuala makes an update of the backup, i.e. the songs that i listened to are uploaded anew. This means that Wuala thinks that the file has been changed. I find it really annoying because this uses CPU and bandwith when I listen to music. I want to solve this problem. \nMy question: Is it true that iTunes, in more recent versions, changes the mp3-file when listening to a song, or is the problem caused by newer versions of Wuala?\nEDIT:\nThanks, Dave K. Comparing checksums is a good idea. I've just done the same: I checked the checksums before and after playing a few tracks, and none of the checksums changed. However, Wuala still uploads played tracks. On this screenshot, one can see that Wuala uploads tracks the checksum of which has not changed:\n\nThus, Wuala updates files which haven't changed. What else could be the reason why the tracks are uploaded? I noticed that iTunes opens the mp3-files with write access, as one can see from the fact that the information in Finder shows identical times for \"modified\" and \"last opened\" (is this a correct conclusion?):\n\nCould that be the reason why Wuala uploads the files? Where is the information stored that a file has been last modified at a certain time? (not in the file, since the checksum doesn't change)\n\nA: My Setup: Crashplan, OS X 10.8.2, iTunes 10.7 (21)\nI am unable to replicate the same issue on my system, and haven't noticed any excess changes or uploads to crashplan on my filesystem after playing music. To be sure it wasn't happening in the background, I ran a checksum on one of my audio files, played the complete song in iTunes, and re-ran the checksum. If something in the file itself had changed, the checksum would be different.\nHere are the results:\nBig-iMac:Abbey Road dave$ openssl sha1 17\\ Her\\ Majesty.m4a \nSHA1(17 Her Majesty.m4a)= 3aea5150d7b1d21846b6502bac7ccacca44ff0fa\nBig-iMac:Abbey Road dave$ openssl sha1 17\\ Her\\ Majesty.m4a \nSHA1(17 Her Majesty.m4a)= 3aea5150d7b1d21846b6502bac7ccacca44ff0fa\n\nAs you can see, the checksum matches the second time after playing the song through iTunes. Most of my collection is ripped into ALAC (m4a), so I thought I'd test a standard mp3 file as well:\nBig-iMac:One More Night in New York City dave$ openssl sha1 2-21\\ The\\ End.mp3 \nSHA1(2-21 The End.mp3)= a223d6fb542bee5191794d0a74f971da19fb9afc\nBig-iMac:One More Night in New York City dave$ openssl sha1 2-21\\ The\\ End.mp3 \nSHA1(2-21 The End.mp3)= a223d6fb542bee5191794d0a74f971da19fb9afc\n\nThis too produced the same checksum before and after playing the song in iTunes. All of the metadata about your library (play count, etc.) is stored in the iTunes Music Library.xml file, not in the mp3 itself so I wouldn't expect individual songs to change. However, it's quite possible that the iTunes Music Library file will need to be re-uploaded since it changes frequently.\n", "Q: No internet access on MacBook Air, though I can connect to networks (Edited after rebooting everything again.)\nI'm unable to get my MacBook Air (mid-2011 model, running OS X Lion 10.7.4) connected to the internet.

In iOS Settings, you can \"Update All Contacts\" with Facebook and Twitter. According to the explanation in the phone this will update photos and user names for all matching contacts. In addition, you can allow Facebook to use your contacts.\nI have a lot of contacts and many of them have already got pictures that I have chosen myself. The contacts (and pictures) are synced with my Google Apps account.\nIf I do \"Update All Contacts\" with Facebook and/or Twittor or allow Facebook to use my contacts, will this overwrite existing pictures? (And thus change what is in my Google contacts?) \n(For bonus points, please explain exactly what else will be changed.)\n\nA: Facebook contact sync will add photos to contacts that don't have any pictures assigned and leave those that have them already unchanged.\nSources: on Facebook contact sync and review of the feature on iLounge with the answer to the question.\n\nA: In my own experience, using the \"Update All Contacts\" creates new contact cards and doesn't change your contacts except the \"Linked Contacts\" field, which links your contact to his/her Facebook contact card.\nWhen you view a contact card, it \"shows\" you the merged info on that contact. So if one of your contacts didn't have a picture, but the Facebook contact card has a picture, it will show the picture.\nAlso, when you're editing a contact which has several linked contact cards, you can set to show which picture to show on all contact cards. (Something like \"unified picture\", I don't remember it exactly and can't test it since I don't have any Facebook contact cards.)\nP.S. about user24601's answer and iskra's comment, I must say that those \"Groups\" are really groups, and same contact cannot be in different groups. When you create a contact on iPhone (with iCloud set to on), it's placed under iCloud, but when you use \"Update All Contacts\", new contact cards are created and placed under Facebook group. You may want to remove your down-vote.\nAlso, I suggest not using different groups and thus several contact cards for each of your real-life (!) contacts. What I did to clear the mess created by \"Update All Contacts\" using Facebook, was to merge info manually and finally deleting the Facebook contact cards. For example I only had phone number of a friend, but his Facebook contact card had his email. So I added his email to his contact card by hand.\nThis way, your contacts app remains clean, one contact card for each person. This is more important if you're using Contacts.app on a Mac too.\nSorry for the long answer, hope it helps.\n\nA: I have now gone ahead and clicked \"Update All Contacts\" for Facebook.\nHere are my empirical findings:\nAfter about 30s it said\n405 contacts updated \nI examined my contacts and could see\n\n\n*\n\n*Some contacts on that iPad got photos from Facebook\n\n*No existing\nphotos were overridden. \n\n*On lots of contacts a “Facebook” entry was\ncreated. I guess this indicates that they are my friends on facebook.\nWhen I click such an entry, the Facebook app opens. However, it opens\non the standard newsfeed. It does not open anything connected to that\nparticular person. Is this a bug? \n\n*No photos were synced to Google or\nother iDevices. The photos did not appear in Google Contacts. They\ndid not even appear on other iDevices set up syncing with Google\nContacts. (I did the update on an iPad and my iPhone was not\nupdated). The “Facebook” entry was updated on other iDevices. \n\n*I could\nnot find any evidence that any new contact cards were created. No new\nGoogle Contacts were created. I do have some Facebook friends that were not in contacts, and they did not show up in contacts afters \"Update All Contacts\".\n\n\nA: In my experience, Facebook will literally give each of your friends their own contact card, separate from any pre-existing contacts. You can link two separate contact cards after the fact, but in the beginning, I think any of your Google contacts who's also a Facebook friend will find themselves with two entries in Contacts, one Google and one Facebook.

Is there a better way to do this ?\n\nA: I'm not sure this is what you're looking for, but when a link is displayed in Mail, if you want to select only a part of it, one trick is to put the cursor slightly to the left or to the right of the link (not too far though, or you'll select spaces too) and select the link's text from this point. \nThus, the cursor will be in 'select' mode, and you're going to be able to select a part of the text from the link.

Almost every time it will start up in that state. \nIt used to be tense but after 9 months of this it's pretty standard. \n\nA: You may already know this, but there is an apple repair extension for these kind of issues now.  They'll fix it for free.\nhttps://www.apple.com/uk/support/macbookpro-videoissues/\n\nA: If anyone is still looking for ways to do this, please check out this MacRumors forum post.  \nI followed the steps and my 15\" MacBook Pro 2011 (with a failed discrete AMD graphic card) is working perfectly using only its Integrated Graphic.\nhttps://forums.macrumors.com/threads/force-2011-macbook-pro-8-2-with-failed-amd-gpu-to-always-use-intel-integrated-gpu-efi-variable-fix.2037591/page-5#post-24511780\nhttps://forums.macrumors.com/threads/force-2011-macbook-pro-8-2-with-failed-amd-gpu-to-always-use-intel-integrated-gpu-efi-variable-fix.2037591/\n\nA: The line between repairing a circuit with a bad card that is drawing down voltage, or killing a communications bus or overheating and just surgically disabling the component that is soldered to the whole is non-existant.\nYou'll need to swap the board or start destroying things and hope that you guess well and don't do more damage than good when you are disconnecting traces on the logic board.\nIf you had specific diagnostic information as to the precise failure, then perhaps there would be something to do, but as written, there's no cause for hope that you can extend the life of this computer.\n\nA: It seems that I have found more reliable or permanent software solution allowing to permanently disable discrete GPU and use mbp (mine is Mbp 8.3 17i early 2011) with broken discrete GPU (failing to boot) than gfxCardStatus 1.8-2.2.1, namely https://github.com/0xbb/gpu-switch . Please note that only source code is there so Xcode is requred to compile the binary. The application runs from terminal, reportedly uses the same code as gfxCardStatus but writes the setting into NVRAM(PRAM) so machine remains switched to internal GPU on next boot(s)/wake(s). This saved me from frequent overheat shutdowns under blanket just to load the os (after overheat shutdown the system forcibly uses igpu but this state changes back after couple of boots so it becomes necessary to overheat again). After about a week of gpu-switch testing, however, I have to conclude that this solution has its drawbacks too: it works fine after shutdown (including abnormal or forced one), sleep, hibernation, but it does not prevent mbp from switching to dgpu on running graphic demanding apps such as googlemaps in browser. gfxCardStatus (integrated only mode) is better in this respect so I use both and now I can say that the machine is very stable and reliable after all.\nHope this helps)\nAndrei\n\nA: My early 2011 17\" starting exhibiting grapics errors yesterday. Today it would not boot. Boot fails when the screen exhibits vertical bars instead of gray background when the apple logo first appears. The apple logo disappears and only gray remains. Then the fans crank up.\nI can get back to a successful boot with the integrated graphics. Here is how:\n\n\n*\n\n*Let system complete its failed bootup complete with whirring fans.\n\n*Go through boot login procedure blind\n\n*Wait appropriate time for login to complete.\n\n*Remove power adapter (this steps seems to force computer to default to integrated graphics)\n\n*Hold down power button for five seconds to force power off.\n\n*Press power button and reboot normally on integrated graphics.\n\n\nOnce running, I use gfxCardStatus to set Integrated Only graphics. Of course, my external monitor can not be used.\n\nA: I am putting this out there, since it worked for me.\nApple refuses to warranty this machine, since I changed the battery/hard drive on the machine as a user replaceable part.\nSo If you have a video card issue, no need to put it in foil/oven/hot air gun or blankets to heat it up. I have a simpler solution!\nOpen up back cover and disconnect the 2 fans. Put the lid back, then turn it on and let it get to the bad video screen. Leave it on for a good 7-10 min and let it get hot. This will automatically solder reflow the chip without pulling it all apart and doing oven techniques.\nI did a hair dryer reflow once and it worked, so I wondered why not let it heat up on its own without fans, the heat stays in and it has the same affect. This procedure makes it work for about 1 month. Then you need to do this again. Disconnecting fans is easy and can be done repeatedly. I don't even screw in my back cover anymore!\n\nA: I faced the same problem with my late 2011 MacBook Pro 15\".\nAfter checking several possibilities (bad RAM, firmware, corrupt OS, etc) I ended up concluding that I have a malfunctioning discrete video card (AMD Radeon HD 6750M). The integrated card (Intel HD Graphics 3000) seems to be okay. After the boot process is concluded, it is possible to force the use of the integrated card using the software gfxCardStatus (http://gfx.io/). However, I could not find a way to force the use of the integrated video card during the boot process. I managed to find that the boot process can be finished after leaving the blank screen on for about 15 or even 30 minutes, powering the computer off, and turning it on again. I am still learning about the problem... Anyway, it seems to be possible to replace the discrete video card without replacing the logic board.\nGood luck,\n               Hani\n\nA: Its been about seven months since my card went bad. Since then I have done 3 solder reflows using a hot air gun. Those fixes last for about a month. What I really end up doing is pray it actually progresses past the bootscreen, which it sometimes does after 30 restarts. I then run gfxCardStatus (http://gfx.io/) then ensure not to restart. I had 45days uptime recently until a usb short forced me to reboot. It failed, I turned it off for about six hours, tried again and it booted. I have been up 13days since running on the internal intel card.\nWARNING!!!!\n\nDo not do a solder reflow if you plan to get the logic board replaced at an apple store. They wont want to accept a modified system, and TEKSERVE in New York was charging me over $1000 for the logic board which is more expensive than a second hand MBP on Ebay.\n\nA: I had similar non bootable problem with a MBP 17 inch (early 2011). Saw all the online action, the lawsuits etc… Hopefully apple will do a recall as it was bought by me for graphic intense tasks like video editing.\nI followed these steps and got a workable fix:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you boot and get vertical stripes > apple logo > white grey screen, let it run hot as the fans kick in block the keyboard from venting airflow or wrap the mbp closed in a blanket. \n\n*It gets pretty hot. I left it for about half an hour then switched it off by holding down the power button.\n\n*I then I let it cool down completely, (in fact I put it outside on the balcony.)\n\n*It then booted and seems fine so far. I even plugged it into a cinema display and played HD on youtube. It got heated up a bit but no GPU issue so far.\n\n*Previously I had tried GFXbench to test it, and it went straight back to no vertical lines at boot.\n\n*If your MBP doesn't get to white screen before shutting down while attempting to boot, hold down the option key and boot into recovery disk. That got me the white screen and high fan noise. \nHope this helps,\nMatt\n\nA: I found out, and this is completely unlogical of course, that if I get the blank screen at restart, after I insert an install CD or another bootable volume, and hold down option, my Mac will start normally afterwards. Of course, this won't help in the long run, but this almost always fix the issue for a little while.\n\nA: old thread but i had the same problem.\nmacbook pro late 2011 - amd gpu working fine, but the intel igpu is not working.\nbooting to rescue mode and delete the intel gpu / switching kext worked for me . the amd gpu consumes much more power and the cooler is running because of the higher temperatures.\np.s. in mavericks i had no luck to delete the intel kext's, yosemite worked fine after the 1. try .\nmaybe it will help someone :) \n\nA: For thoses who can't access their MBP software (either OSX or Recovery Mode), a simple solution can be made by flipping over the macbook pro while the MBP is turned on (do it like screen is upside down and keyboard is facing a hard surface or your desk).\nThis heats up the defective gpu and it gets reflowed all by itself. Let it cool down first before use the laptop. Several hours will do the job. In my case I found my MPB shut down and cool.\nThen you can install a program called GFXCardStatus 2.1 (only v.2.1 works for this case) and disable the defective GPU.\nFor a guide about the program read this link\nFor me this worked and if any problem appears in the future, I will update the answer accordingly.\nI personally thank the user mightymacman, the user from the forums I link to who pointed this out.\n", "Q: Is it bad or unhealthy to put my Mac to sleep? I am wondering if it is bad or unhealthy to always put my Mac to sleep or should I shut it down instead? What I mean by putting it to sleep is that the display and hard drive are sleeping.\nThe reason for asking this question is I have heard from several computer literate people that sleeping the hard drive is not good for it.\n\nA: Anecdotally, the drives of 5 to 15 years ago would run longer if you never spun them down. When I managed servers - the drives failed less rapidly than the inexpensive hard drives that were in workstations (which typically spun down). It's not clear if we would have seen similar failure rates if we placed the higher priced (and presumably better built for the long run) drives in the workstations.\nI have seen no credible studies that show any drive from the last 5 years lasting longer by disabling sleep. It's hard to imagine a case where you wouldn't want to have a computer sleep even if it were going to decrease the useful life of an inexpensive storage drive due to other components failing over time and the waste of energy.\nWe don't yet have good data on SSD wearing out either as OEM parts ordered from Apple or aftermarket SSD, but it will be interesting to see how they wear out due to write failures and if sleep writing of large RAM images will add up to enough writes to shorten the life of an SSD that otherwise would be healthy in the absence of storing sleep images.\n\nA: Laptops use a hybrid of sleep mode and hibernation by default: they both keep the RAM powered and write its contents to a sleep image.\nThe cells in SSDs can only be written to a limited number of times after which they become read-only. The write endurance of SSDs is often estimated as total bytes written (TBW), which is usually about 500-5000 times the capacity of the drives for high endurance SSDs.\nIf you had 8GB of RAM, half of it was written to a sleep image when going to sleep, and you put the computer to sleep 500 times per year for three years, it would be a total of about 6TB. For a 256GB SSD with a TBW of 200 times its capacity, that would be about 10% of the TBW.\nThat could be completely wrong though. I don't know any way to see how much data is written to the sleep image when going to sleep.\nRelated questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*On/Off vs. Sleep Mode\n\n*Turning off hibernate on a MacBook Pro with an SSD\n\n*Do MacBooks have a true \"Hibernate\" option?\n\nA: The main problem caused by putting macs to sleep is that the computer immediately writes all the data in RAM to the Hard drive. This means that if (as I've seen people do) you shut the lid of your Mac, then immediately start throwing it around, then there is a chance that your Hard drive could get damaged. However, so long as you are careful with it for a couple of minutes after putting it to sleep, then you should be fine. (In theory, the sudden motion sensor should park the drive heads before you do any damage, but I'm not sure how effective they are...)\n\nA: First off, the \"sleep\" of a Mac differs from those of most other computers; Macs don't write the content of the entire RAM to the disk when you put it to sleep, it rather deactivates power supply to almost every component of the computer, except the RAM, so that, when the Mac awakes again, it never erased the RAM and kept it's content.\nSo it depends on what you call \"bad/unhealthy\", because the Mac is still powered, just not consuming as much. Meaning that Macbooks will lose battery life while sleeping, but it still may take up to weeks until it runs dry, depending on how much life the battery had when you put the Macbook to sleep.\nMy guess is that those \"computer literate\" people only knew about the sleep function of most other computers; those write the content of the RAM onto the disk when putting to sleep, and read it from the disk into the RAM when they awake. First: this may cause massive fragmentation for the disk. Second: SSDs lose life when writing on them, so this in particular may indeed be not healthy for them. Third: There is a risk of damaging the HDD while it is writing and you bump the laptop (however, this is not sleep related, and there should be technics put into the laptop to prevent this anyway).\nPersonally, I never really shut down my Macbook, except when I know I'm not going to use it any time soon. So again, I never shut down my Macbook, only just closing it.\nEDIT:\nJust learned that portable Macs do both by default, that is keeping the RAM powered and saving the content to disk.\nSo yeah, the guys told you that technically are right, but as I see it, it's as unhealthy/bad for your drive as, well, using it for anything else.\n", "Q: Best way to transfer iphone contacts away from Exchange server The primary location for my contacts currently is with my company's Exchange server.

Given some applications that can be installed natively as well as through MacPorts (such as MacVim, iTerm2, Gimp, etc.), what are pros and cons for choosing one installation method over the other?\n\nA: Installing Natively\nIf the developer releases pre-built binaries for your OS, then this will likely be the quickest, easiest and most up-to-date (in terms of the application itself) method of getting an application. This relies on the developer (or some trusted third party) to be keeping the builds up to date with changes in both the application and in Mac OS X (e.g. rebuilding against the latest Mac OS X SDKs as they are released).\nOne downside is you are trusting whoever built it not to have maliciously modified the source before doing so, and/or whoever is hosting/mirroring the download not to have done the same. Generally a non-issue, but that's why there are often MD5 checksums for downloads.\nA possible downside is that you don't have control over which version of any dependencies the developer builds against (e.g. for things like Python, or the C++ STL, or OpenSSL). For example, if they build against native Mac OS X SDKs, these are generally a little behind the current versions of most libraries. They do get updates, but not necessarily very quickly (except in some critical security situations), as Apple need to do their own QA/testing before they can include updates to libraries they bundle with the system.\nSome developers may include the latest libraries in their application bundle, especially if they rely on new features of said library which haven't yet made it into the base Mac OS X set. Basically, you can't control this, so it may/may not be a downside.\nBuilding from Source Manually\nThis might come under 'installing natively', since its not macports as such, but basically means getting the latest source, and building it yourself against 'native' Mac OS X SDKs and/or your choice of versions of dependencies.\nAdvantages are that you're going to be building on your system, for your system, so all dependencies match your runtime environment and are the version of your choosing (e.g. recently updated to latest source to include bug fixes and security patches). Of course the obvious downside is you need to make sure you have all those dependencies (YMMV depending on the project).\nYou're also not needing to trust someone else's binary build (though you still want to make sure you've got the 'official' source code, without any chances of malicious modifications!).\nCompared to installing from binaries:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pro: You get more control of dependencies, you can choose to use the Mac OS X bundled libraries or your own builds of them (e.g. for things like Python, OpenSSL, libstdc, etc)  ...\n\n*Con: ... but you have to manage the dependencies (obtain/configure/build/install), especially if there's no in-built version at all.\n\n*Pro: Runtime dependencies are definitely compatible, because you built against them...\n\n*Con: ... unless you change them later for another project!\n\n*Pro: You aren't blindly trusting someone else's binary build...\n\n*Con: ... but it may take much longer to build from source than simply downloading binaries\n\n\nInstalling from MacPorts\nThis is typically much like building from source, but much of it is scripted and tested by thousands of others, so you tend to have fewer issues getting projects to build. Further, MacPorts keeps track of all the projects you build, and their versions, and makes it really easy to check what's out of date, upgrade to new versions, switch between versions, etc.\nOf course you're relying on the application/dependencies to be in MacPorts, which requires someone (possibly even you!!), to have made a MacPorts project for it. Also you're relying on the MacPorts project to be kept up-to-date with the original application, and likewise for the dependencies. If the MacPorts scripts aren't updated when new versions of the source are released, you won't get access to them.\nCompared to Installing Natively from Binaries\n\n\n*\n\n*Pro: You're possibly not relying on someone else's binary build (or if you are, it's at least checksum tested) ...\n\n*Con: ... but you may have to wait while MacPorts builds your project.\n\n*Pro: You will often have more current versions of dependencies than are shipped with Mac OS X ...\n\n*Con: ... but MacPorts will need to update/build them as you go, which can take a while.\n\n*Pro: MacPorts will often have newer versions of system libraries than Mac OS X...\n\n*Con: ... but this means it must build & install a second version of many base libraries, whether they're strictly needed or not.\n\n\nCompared to building from source yourself\n\n\n*\n\n*Pro: It's often much easier, just typing a single command, than obtaining/configuring/building/installing various dependencies ...\n\n*Pro: And MacPorts keeps track of all your versions, so its easier to make sure all your applications that rely on some common dependency are updated when you update it ...\n\n*Con: ... But in all cases, you're at the mercy of the port maintainers to keep ports updated, so it might be a little (or a lot!) behind some official releases of applications/libraries.\n\n*Con: ... And you can't choose between the Mac OS X bundled system libraries vs MacPorts re-building those libraries; it always builds its own if they're open source.\n\n\nA: Installing natively is often easier, but sometimes you have to wait a bit longer to get the latest version.\n", "Q: How do I delete most of my reminders on the iPhone? Whenever I need to remember something (oil change, buy something for kids, do something, whatever), I fire up Siri and create a reminder for a specific date/time.  I do this for both my personal and work life.  This method has been very successful in organizing my life and not letting things fall through the cracks.\nWhen the time comes, iPhone reminds of the task and I go and do it.  However, now I have several thousand reminders and it now takes a while for the Reminders app to start.  I'd like to delete most of the reminders since they have expired long ago.\nHowever, I see no way to delete Reminders in bulk.  I don't see a way to do it on the phone, nor do I see a way to do it in icloud.com.\nAm I missing something simple?  If not, is there another way to manage reminders?\n\nA: I am not aware of any iOS or web app that will allow bulk deletion of iCloud reminders but that is something that presumably could be written.\nThe only mechanism I am aware of that will bulk delete reminders is the Automator app running on OS X.\nHere is a screen shot of something that would find all reminders older than 20 days and delete them summarily.\n\nYou can see I searched for reminder and chose a task to select them and another to delete them. DO NOT RUN THIS unless you are prepared to lose all your reminders or test things on a second iCloud account.\nFor testing, I would add a second condition and watch the script run before letting it loose on a thousand reminders. I'd hate to be the one to find a bug in the time logic of the Find Reminders action by working on live data that's not backed up (and I don't know a good way to back up the reminder data and have it re-syced back to the cloud easily).\n\n", "Q: How to make a Mac harddrive partition non bootable Just recently added an SSD drive replacing the optical drive. Carbon Copy the whole partition and now left with 2 bootable drives. How do I make the old partition no longer bootable? I've changed the default boot using Startup Disk utility, but want to make the partition completely non bootable\nThanks\n\nA: To check whether a disk drive is bootable, open Terminal (in Applications>Utilities) and type (replace /Volumes/SSD with the folder your disk drive is mounted at):\nbless --info /Volumes/SSD/\n\nIf the output looks similar to this:\nfinderinfo[0]:      0 => No Blessed System Folder\nfinderinfo[1]:      0 => No Blessed System File\nfinderinfo[2]:      0 => Open-folder linked list empty\nfinderinfo[3]:      0 => No alternate OS blessed file/folder\nfinderinfo[4]:      0 => Unused field unset\nfinderinfo[5]:      0 => No OS 9 + X blessed X folder\n64-bit VSDB volume id:  0x844F837C9317318A\n\nyour computer won't be able to boot from the drive.\nFor comparison, this is what the output of a bootable disk drive would look like:\nbless --info /\n\nfinderinfo[0]:     62 => Blessed System Folder is /System/Library/CoreServices\nfinderinfo[1]: 327769 => Blessed System File is /System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi\nfinderinfo[2]:      0 => Open-folder linked list empty\nfinderinfo[3]:      0 => No alternate OS blessed file/folder\nfinderinfo[4]:      0 => Unused field unset\nfinderinfo[5]:     62 => OS X blessed folder is /System/Library/CoreServices\n64-bit VSDB volume id:  0xD9A24BFA7A5E7EDC\n\nThe command bless includes option --unbless to unset volume bootability (from man bless):\n\n--unbless directory  Use the HFS+ volume mounted at directory and unset any persistent blessed files/directories in the HFS+ Volume\n                                Header.\n\nSo if you find out in the output above that your drive is bootable, \"unbless\" it:\nsudo bless --unbless /Volumes/SDD/\n\n", "Q: Why don't property lists use more XML-element types?

Every iOS and OS X program at a minimum uses a property list for communicating basic information about itself to the system, and most use them frequently in their code, particularly for storing preferences (this is why most apps settings are accessible via the defaults command).\nProperty lists in Obj-C are defined as a dictionary type that contains only strings, numbers, arrays, dates, raw bytes and other dictionaries. Prescribing exactly what types a property list can contain means you can access any one and know what to expect. Allowing more free-form XML elements would increase complexity and require a lot of reworking existing code, for not much benefit.\n", "Q: Derive the launchd config plist based on a launch label When I list the currently running services, I see a service I'd like to remove: \n% launchctl list | grep -i spotify\n -  13  com.spotify.webhelper\nLaunchctl allows me to stop it via launchctl stop com.spotify.webhelper but it does not allow me to completely remove it (uninstall it) unless I specify the .plist file.\nHow can I derive the plist based on the label? \n\nA: locate com.spotify.webhelper should do the trick as long as the plist is properly named (and the update process for the locate db has at least run once since you installed Spotify).

But I can't remember since it has been years since I installed it on my iMac.\n\nA: Two options:\nOption 1) Share the DVD drive from your iMac to your MacBook Pro.\nGo to the \"Sharing\" panel in System Preferences on your iMac.\nYou can then install the software over your LAN connection.\nHowever, this doesn't always work, and it's very slow.\nOption 2) Make an ISO of your installation CD/DVD.\nThis requires using the Terminal.app, but it's fairly painless.\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert the disk in the iMac\n\n*Go to Terminal.app and type mount and press return, and you will see something like this:\n/dev/disk1 on / (hfs, local, journaled)\ndevfs on /dev (devfs, local, nobrowse)\nmap -hosts on /net (autofs, nosuid, automounted, nobrowse)\nmap auto_home on /home (autofs, automounted, nobrowse)   \nexcept that you will also see a \"/dev/disk\" entry for your DVD drive.

It's a nice backup and installation from an ISO is a lot faster than from an actual DVD too.\n\nA: There is a great detailed answer covering two of these options, but here are your possible options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get/borrow the MacBook Air SuperDrive and use it to re-install from the CD.\n\n*Use the iMac to share the drive (remote disc style) over the network\n\n*Use the iMac to duplicate the disc to a disk image that can be mounted\n\n*Use Migration Assistant to move the Application itself over\n\n*Figure out which folders in /Library and elsewhere need to be copied in addition to /Applications/Aperture.app\n\n*Buy the latest version of Aperture from the App Store and skip the time needed to do the above\n\n\nWithout knowing exactly which version of Aperture you have, the simple finder copy of the Application might work and my memory is that it will prompt you to insert the DVD if it detects missing support files, but works fairly well as not much is actually stored in /Library for Aperture.\n\nA: I have had no trouble just copying the Aperture.app folder from one mac's Applications folder to another.\nOn the source mac, share the applications folder.\nOn the destination mac, connect to the shared folder.\nIf you do this over wifi, it won't be quick.  We have a wired network in our house, and it took about 5 mintues to copy the nearly gigabyte folder over.\n", "Q: Open Terminal App Without Opening A Window Is it possible to change the default settings in the Terminal App (OS X 10.7.5) such that when the app is launched, no windows are opened by default?\nAs a shot in the dark, I tried closing all windows, and then creating an \"empty\" window group and setting that as what should be \"opened\" when the app is launched, but it is still opening a bash window when the app is launched.\n(The reason I ask is that some other apps I use occasionally launch Terminal with a bash prompt in a particular directory, but I always get two windows open: the default one in my home directory and the one the other application opened.)\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: It's very strange that you say this, because I only get one window open... It would be interesting to see how the applications are launching the Terminal. IF they launch it by opening Terminal, then opening a new window using Applescript or something, then you would expect to see two new windows, but if they just run a bash script, then it should just open a single window.\n", "Q: How do I setup Python3.3 and Sublime Text 2 correctly on OS X 10.8.2? I am trying to setup Sublime Text 2 so that the build command correctly runs Python3 / Python3.3 scripts.\nI have installed Python 3.3 via the installer obtained from python.org and installed Sublime Text 2 via the Sublime Text 2 installer. \nFollowing this I added a custom build entry called:\nPython3.sublime-build \n\ninto Sublime Text 2's Python folder with the following contents:\n{\n    \"cmd\": [\"python3\", \"-u\", \"$file\"],\n    \"file_regex\": \"^[ ]*File \\\"(...*?)\\\", line ([0-9]*)\",\n    \"selector\": \"source.python\"\n}\n\nI'm getting the following error when trying to run the script:\n[Errno 2] No such file or directory\n[cmd:  [u'python3', u'-u', u'/Users/user/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/Python/Python3.sublime-build']]\n[dir:  /Users/user/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/Python]\n[path: /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin]\n[Finished]\n\nI have read somewhere that symlinkng python3 from /usr/bin might fix the issue but after creating the symlink in /usr/bin through Finder, Sublime Text still cannot build as it gets a permissions error.\nWhat is the best way to set Sublime Text 2 up to allow for running Python3 scripts? \n[edit] \nIf I place the PATH for the python3 simlink generated by install, Sublime Text 2 can build the script,\n    {\n        \"cmd\": [\"usr/local/bin/python3\", \"-u\", \"$file\"],\n        \"file_regex\": \"^[ ]*File \\\"(...*?)\\\", line ([0-9]*)\",\n        \"selector\": \"source.python\"\n    }\n\nBut when I tried adding the PATH to the ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist as advised without the defined PATH I get the error. Could anyone point out why this is not working?\n\nA: Add \"path\": \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.3/bin/\" to your Python3 build file. Mine looks like this:\n{\n    \"cmd\": [\"python3\", \"-u\", \"$file\"],\n    \"file_regex\": \"^[ ]*File \\\"(...*?)\\\", line ([0-9]*)\",\n    \"selector\": \"source.python\",\n    \"encoding\": \"utf8\",\n    \"path\": \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.3/bin/\"\n}\n\nNote: Make sure the path to Python3 is relative to your machine - that was true for mine\n\nA: I gave the complete path to python3 to get this to work:\n{\n  \"cmd\" : [\"/usr/local/bin/python3\", \"-u\", \"$file\"],\n}\n\n\nA: The issue is the normal OSX one that GUI Applications do not read your shell profiles etc and so just have the path inherited from the Workspace.\nThe way to fix this is to add the path in ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist\nThat is add a key string pair for PATH e.g.\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n\n  <key>PATH</key>\n  <string>/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/usr/libexec/binutils:</string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nYou will need to logout and login or possibly reboot for this to work.\n\nA: Sister site stackoverflow has few entries with explanations regarding the issue of setting PATH environment variables for GUI based applications. Some claim that environment.plist works and others claim it doesn't and recommend using launched.conf.\nMac OS X Lion no longer recognizes environment.plist, Environment variables in Mac OS X, and Set environment variables on Mac OS X Lion.

I can't find a list of compatible graphics cards anywhere at the Apple web site and I can't find a list of compatible Apple machines anywhere at the nvidia web site. How does someone go about finding out these things?\nIn particular, does anyone know what the best performing CUDA-compatible graphics cards, compatible with the Mac Pro (MacPro5,1 and more recent) running Mountain Lion, with off-the-shelf drivers, are?\n\nA: This might not be exactly what your looking for but Bare Feats has several articles on the current state (or lack there of) video cards for the Mac Pro.\nTake a look at CUDA compatible GPUs for the Mac Pro and Abandoning Apple 'Blessed' GPUs\nI recently had to replace a second dying NVidia 8800 GT in my Mac Pro (early 2008) but decided to stick with an Apple card.  \nMost of the non-Apple branded cards will not work until the machine is past the boot volume selection screen (if you need it) and I seem to find myself switching boot volumes frequently.\n", "Q: iTunes music available from iPad iTunes to iPhone iTunes? I used iPad 2 a long time before getting iPhone 4S so all my music is on there. Now I cannot get the music from iPad to iPhone. How can I do it?\n\nA: It depends on where you got the music from.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you purchased it through iTunes on your iPad, then you can open iTunes on your phone, select the \"More\" tab, then tap \"Purchased\", then download the music onto your phone. \"Purchased\" is an iCloud feature. iCloud must be enabled, and configured correctly on all your iOS 5 or later devices. The navigation in getting to Purchase history has changed slightly, I believe, between iOS 5 and iOS 6, but the idea is the same.\n\n*If you ripped CDs, then transferred the content over to your iPad, you will have to use the computer that you ripped them to to sync the songs onto the iPhone.\n\n*If you downloaded them from somewhere such as Amazon on your computer before transferring them to your iPad, then you will need to connect your iPhone to your computer to sync those purchases.\nOne thing to note: you cannot transfer songs from your iPad to your computer with iTunes (unless it was purchased from iTunes, and the computer is authorized). So, in other words, if you no longer have the computer that had all your songs on it, and just your iPad does, you will want to look for third party software (maybe like this? I haven't used it, but just did a Google search) to transfer your media to your computer, then to your phone.\n\nA: It depends on your country, more here. For me, it is not possible without OSx and iTunes.\n\nIf you have iPad and iPhone in less-supported country, you can make your life million-times easier if you buy some OSx -device such as laptop or old desktop. I really-really hate this feature but in order to use iOS -devices well, you should really consider investing in OSx.\n", "Q: How can I automate window arrangement? I know and have been reading a few ideas about how to \"import\" the features of xmonad/tiling window managers in OSX. I don't care much about the X11/Xquartz windows, but about conventional OSX windows.\nNow, all the solutions I have seen around lack the one feature I'd really like to have: not to worry about windows anymore.\nLet me explain:\nI'd like to have a system (as in xmonad on linux) in which I have 2/3 different modes (in xmonad I'd use Simplest, TwoPanes and Grid) and windows (newly created or existing) automagically adhere to the layout I have selected: no mouse involved, no keys to be pressed. Then I'd need a keyboard shortcut to be able to switch from one mode to another.\nObviously a big plus would be to be able to handle exceptions (as in xmonad, floating windows) or a keyboard shortcut to move around a window freely.\n\nA: Try out Stay. It lets you save window configurations (position and size) in profiles. Unfortunately, these profiles only deal (multi) display arrangements.\n\nA: Slate is an OS X window manager \"application\" that looks promising. Its stock configuration isn't that great, but it is extremely configurable. Also, it uses the OS X \"Accessibility\" API, so it doesn't require admin privileges to install. That is pretty clever.\n\nA: Well. There is no such Window manager on Mac OS X. If you want one, you'll have to write it. The standard API won't allow you to do everything you mentioned. You'll have to dig a little and use some private APIs.\nHere's an old (2005) open-source project that might help you:\nhttp://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3463\n", "Q: AirPort Express extending connects in the wrong order Recently, after extending a wireless network on a setup with one Extreme and one Express (both AirPort base stations), I've been experiencing issues regarding which base station extends which on a certain iMac. Note that when it actually works, it works great.\nI have the AirPort Extreme connected to a modem via Ethernet, but an AirPort Express that is generally closer to all of my devices extends this network (we can't change where our modem is without our ISP having to send someone over to re-wire practically everything).  The screenshot below explains everything.\n\nI cannot use Internet on this particular Mac when it is acting this way.\nAny suggestions or explanations as to why AirPort Utility would show it in this strangely ordered diagram?  \n\nA: I recently encountered the same issue and was able to resolve it by removing the Wifi connection in System Preferences > Network.\nHere you can select the Wi-Fi interface from the left panel and click the \"-\" underneath this panel. Then, add back the Wi-Fi interface by pressing the \"+\", select Wi-Fi and attempt to connect to your desired network. \nThis should then place all devices in the correct order by connecting to the device that creates the wireless network as opposed to those devices that either join or extend it.\nBest of luck. \n", "Q: How do I, after opening the iOS 5 built-in dictionary, look up the definition of a word that appears in a dictionary definition? I can look up the definition of any word that I can select in iOS.  However, once the dictionary is open, I can't figure out how to further look up the definition of a word that appears in the dictionary definition.  This seems like basic dictionary software functionality.  Is there a way to do it?\n\nA: Nope, there is no way to do it. I think that’s really stupid. Though I remember being able to do that in iBooks when it was first released, before iOS had a built in dictionary.\n", "Q: How do I force a \"Waiting\" file to upload to iCloud? In this question, I learned that the \"dotted-line cloud\" icon in OS X's iCloud file view means \"Waiting to upload\". While writing a document in Byword today, I saved it and found it had been marked with this icon - there were several other documents, months old, that still had the \"Waiting\" icon as well.\nIs there any way to, if not force, gently encourage these files to upload to iCloud?\n\nA: I was concerned I'd have to save these documents to my local filesystem, delete them from iCloud, and then perhaps save them to iCloud over again, but it turned out that simply re-opening the \"Waiting\" documents, making a trivial change to them (such as deleting a character and then adding it in again), and then saving the file caused them to be synced successfully.\n\nA: I just had success by renaming the file (added a space to the end)\n\nA: I ran into a similar problem but every time I tried to open the file, the hosting application (Keynote in this case) hung. I was able to killall -9 ubd to unwedge iCloud.\n\nA: In the terminal touch the file and it is fixed.\n\nA: I had to shut down and restart my iPad Pro in order to get the PSD file I was trying to upload to finally stop “waiting to upload” and just do it already.\n\nA: What solved the problem for me was signing off iCloud account and removing the data from all the devices assigned to my account and then signing back in. After doing so on all of my devices (two iMacs and iPhone) and signing back in,  syncing worked as it should in iCloud Drive and in Notability.\n\nA: Log off or restart the system. This worked for me on Macbook.\n\nA: It seems like the issue is the iCloud daemon hanging. The following command kills that process which causes the OS to restart it. That seems to work in many cases and doesn't require deleting or recreating files.\nps -ef | grep -i 'Support/bird' | grep -v grep | awk '{ print \"kill -9 \" $2}'|zsh\n\n\nA: The way I fixed it was to drag one document over another, which automatically creates a folder (like in iOS). Then, I dragged them back out from the folder, and the status waiting status was gone.\n\nA: The way I fixed “waiting” was to drag one document over another while holding down “option” key.\n\nA: When I first experienced this problem I tried clicking on the icloud download icon and I received the \"waiting\" message after about five minutes. However, I checked inside the folder and noticed that other documents also had the \"waiting\" message. I navigated to the upper level folder and clicked icloud icon of the folder with my \"waiting\" documents inside. It took about 35 minute and I never navigated away, but all the documents marked as \"waiting\" eventually downloaded.\n\nA: If you trying to upload files over mobile data make sure you change icloud settings to allow for sync over mobile data and then try restarting your phone.\nI added a document to my files, then changed my icloud setting (which I should've done before trying to upload them) then I found I had to restart my phone before the files actually uploaded to icloud.\n\nA: On the Mac I simply used the Compress command to create a .zip file of the missing file. In one case this was enough to trigger the refresh.\nIn other cases I had to unzip the compressed file and then check the contents. Once confirmed they were correct I just deleted the original file and the .zip file. I then renamed the uncompressed one that just had a  2 added to the name and everything was fine.\n\nA: *\n\n*2-finger-click the song.\n\n*Select \"Add song to iCloud music library\".\n", "Q: External display resolution changes upon display sleep? I have a 15\" MacBook Pro with Retina Display and a ShiMian QH270-IPSMS monitor (2560x1440).\nThe first pitfall I ran across when setting this up was that the HDMI port doesn't support my display's resolution. Instead, I am using a Monoprice Mini DisplayPort to DVI Dual Link adapter, which supports the display's full resolution at 60 Hz.\n\nHowever, when my computer sleeps the displays to save power (or I press ⌃+⇧+⏏), and I reawaken it, suddenly my external monitor is at a very low resolution (640x480?) and the laptop's display is black. With full sleep (or ⌥+⌘+⏏) the problem usually does not occur, although I have seen it occur a couple times. Whenever it happens I can put the computer to sleep and wake it up again and it will most often return to the normal 2560x1440 resolution.\n\n\n*\n\n*I thought it might be because the adapter is USB powered from my computer, but I plugged it into a powered external USB hub and that makes no difference.\n\n*I tried resetting PRAM and that didn't help either.\n\n*I previously installed SwitchResX when attempting to get the display's full resolution working via HDMI; this could perhaps affect what's going on, but I did fully uninstall it so I doubt it's causing problems.\n\n\nHas anyone seen this behavior before, or might know what's going on or how to fix it?\n\nA: I think it's expected behavior. The problem is that when the monitor sleeps, it is essentially being \"unplugged\" so the computer thinks it's gone. And when you reawaken it, the computer thinks a new monitor is being plugged in so it defaults to a supported resolution, but it's getting conflicting reports from the monitor and the DVI Link unit. Try to remove the DVI adapter and, instead, try to force your resolution using Display Maestroy (http://www.koingosw.com/products/displaymaestro.php)\n\nA: I don't know exactly how the solve this problem, but if I was facing it, I would be looking at \nSleepWatcher to monitor sleep/wake activity, and \nsetgetscreenres.\n\nA: I would give Caffeine a try. You can get it either from the AppStore or directly from the developer's site. It was designed to prevent your computer/display from sleeping, and might solve your problem. What's more, it's free, so the only real risk is the time it takes to install and test the application. As long as the problem is not isolated to your adapter then this could very well solve your issue.  \nGood luck! \n\nA: I was able to fix the resolution-changing problem by using an official Apple adapter instead of the Monoprice one.\n\n", "Q: iPhone 4s iOS 6 - how to clear Location Services memory I was viewing a site that asked for permission to access my location which I declined. Since then the site never asks again, it seems like the iPhone has remembered my choice so automatically declines.\nLocation Services are enabled and enabled for Safari. I have tried closing safari (from task manager) and disable/re-enable Location Services, rebooted iPhone.\nIf I view the site on a desktop in Firefox or other browser, it asks for location access everytime I refresh (even if I decline everytime) so I know it's not the site that's the problem.\nMy question is, is there any way to clear this \"memory\" that the iPhone has seemingly stored? Perhaps clearing Safari history would do it but I want to avoid that if possible.\nEdit: Clearing Safari history and cookies doesn't have any effect.\n\nA: To reset your location preferences, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*From your Home screen, go to Settings > General > Reset\n\n*Select Reset Location & Privacy\nNote: This will reset your location warnings for all sites and applications.\n", "Q: How can I get mailboxes settings from iPad to iPhone? I have long settings in iPad and I would like to get them automatically to devices such as iPhone and poussible to Mac in the future. How can I get the settings over all devices?\n\nA: My first thought was that maybe you could use iTunes to sync your Mail settings back to your Mac. Then I found this: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1296\n\nMail account settings (email address, display name, server name, and user name) are synced from the computer to the iOS device; iTunes does not sync settings from the iOS device back to the computer and does not sync any email messages.\n\nSo considering this, I think your best option is to configure your complex Mail Settings on your Mac by hand first. Then, you could use iTunes to automatically sync those settings to all your iOS devices. Not a 100% solution for your problem, but I think it's the best you can do within the limitations you have.\n", "Q: Portable Monitors for MacBook Pro? I'm looking for a Portable Monitors for my macbook pro (possibily a 14'')\nDo you happen to know some model that is working on a mac?\nI found this one (ThinkVision LT1421) but it does not work completely.\n\nA: Have you tried the latest DisplayLink manager software? It is a bit of a battery-guzzler and has some limitations r.e. 3D acceleration, but may be an improvement on the native OS X driver.\n\nA: Every single USB monitor or video adapter I have ever seen uses the same DisplayLink chip and thus uses the same DisplayLink driver. While the Mac version of the driver does work, it unfortunately leaves much to be desired. So to answer your question... at the time of this writing, no, there is no USB monitor that works completely with OS X. \n\nA: The \"Mini Displays\" approach from Edovia appears to enable using an iPad as an external monitor (over Wifi), if your Mac runs 10.7 or later.\nhttp://edovia.com/minidisplay/\n", "Q: Phone-only mode on iPhone Is there a way to switch the iPhone’s functionality to a phone-only mode. In this mode only incoming (and possibly outgoing) calls and SMS messaging would be activated. All other services (location, push, mail) would be disabled. So it would be just like your average seven-years-ago mobile phone which you could leave on during the night (*) without getting awakened by facebook push messages and without fearing to oversleep because the battery drained from downloading all the spam mails you got during the night.\nNote that I’m not speaking of do not disturb functionality, which would also silence SMS messaging (which I’d still like to receive) and yet drain more power than needed by having activated location, push and mail services.\n(*) alarm clock functionality should also work in that mode (but this could well be the built-in alarm, no other apps should be activated or running in the background)\n\nA: You could turn off Wi-Fi (Settings -> Wi-Fi) and cellular data (Settings -> General -> Cellular -> Cellular Data) to get a phone which works just like a phone. Possibly disable location services (Settings -> Privacy -> Locations Services) as well if you really want to extend the battery life. \nI do believe this would still allow local notifications, though, if you've got any apps that use them (such as some alarm or reminder apps).\n", "Q: How to connect to modem setup as bridge through Airport Extreme? I've recently been assigned a static IP by my ISP provider (Sonic.net). My previous setting was with the modem configured to connect using static IP and the Airport Extreme as a bridge. NAT and DHCP were done at the modem, but I couldn't get WOL (Wake On LAN) to work (an Apple technote specifies that this setup won't).\nNow I've set up my modem as a bridge and configured the Airport Extreme to handle everything. I've set it up as a static IP and activated DHCP and NAT. I can connect to the Internet perfectly and everything else (connection-wise) works. Yet to try remote access and WOL.\nThe only problem is that I can't access the modem's admin panel. This should be at 192.168.1.1, but I can't get to it. I think the Airport Extreme is assuming .1 as its internal address.\nIs there any way to access the modem in that setup unless directly linked to it (by Ethernet cable)? Will giving the modem another IP (say .201, out of Airport's DHCP range) work? Can I change the Airport's internal address somehow?\nEDIT: I've managed to assign the modem an IP of 192.168.0.1, so it should be in another subnet, but this traceroute shows it hopping out after hitting local router.\n\nA: The problem isn't just that you have two devices using the same 192.168.1.1 IP address, but also that two network segments are using the same subnet (the first 3 parts of the IP, 192.168.1.x). If you're on the AirPort's LAN at 192.168.1.123 and you try to talk to the modem at 192.168.1.1, the network sees \"192.168.1\" and recognizes it as local traffic, meaning that it never goes out the WAN port where the modem is.\nIt's sort of like if I try to mail a letter to \"123 Fake St, London\". I mean the one in England, but there's a city called London right here in Ontario, so that's where the post office is going to send it.\nAnyway, when you made your own subnetwork with NAT, you should have picked a new IP subnet to go with it. The AirPort utility calls this part of the IPv4 DHCP range, even though it affects more than DHCP. It's probably currently set to \"192.168.1.100 to 200\". Just change the third part to something else, like \"192.168.0.100 to 200\". This will move your entire LAN to the 192.168.0.x subnet, and the AirPort will take 192.168.0.1 for itself.\n\nA: The way to do it would be to edit the firewall on the router. Assuming your modem's address is 192.168.0.1 (and your router side network is on 192.168.1.x), using the DD_WRT firmware it would be as easy as adding:\nifconfig `nvram get wan_ifname`:0 192.168.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.0\n\nto the init scripts and the following to the firewall:\niptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -o `nvram get wan_ifname` -j MASQUERADE\n\nUnfortunately, there is no way (that I know of) to accomplish this with the Airport Extreme; from what I've been able to gather online, this can't be done.\n", "Q: cannot download Safari 6.0.2 update from App Store on ML As by the title!

But I can't understand the concept behind iPhone's Bluetooth technology.\nIn my knowledge, Bluetooth was used for:\n\n\n*\n\n*Transferring files between devices\n\n*Wireless communication for things like video gaming and earphones\n\n\nRecently I tried to copy some of the photos from my old Android mobile to my iPhone 4S via Bluetooth. It's quite simple in my older phones to connect with other devices by Bluetooth for file sharing. But I can't pair other devices (even another iPhone :( ) with my iPhone 4S.\n\n\n*\n\n*Copying songs/videos may affect their iTunes as well as their business. But what about images? Why is the usage of Bluetooth restricted and what's the use of it being able to transfer images?\n\n*Is there any other way to use iPhone's Bluetooth to transfer files? Maybe using an app? But I don't want to jailbreak my device.\nI'm confused about the restrictions and Apple's thinking.\n\nA: As mentioned in the Apple Discussion Forums, like this post for example, the iPhone does not have (and never has had) support for file transfers over Bluetooth.\nHere are the Bluetooth profiles supported by iOS listing the types of operations possible.\n\nA: The Bluetooth protocol supports a large number of profiles, more than just file transfers between devices and pairing of wireless headphones. Certain Bluetooth stacks will implement different profiles — the protocol is capable of say, supporting wireless RS232 serial connections, but that doesn't mean every Bluetooth device has to support that feature. It wouldn't make sense for most to do so. iOS just supports some features and not others — and file transfers happens to belong the latter. That's up to the manufacturer and their consideration of what profiles they think will be relevant and worth supporting.\n", "Q: Sudden drop in gaming performance (FPS) on a mid-2010 iMac About two weeks ago, I had a sudden drop in gaming performance on my 27\" iMac with ATI Radeon HD 5750 graphics. While before I could play games without any problems at high graphical settings, suddenly playing Diablo3 for example became unbearable with around 10FPS at the lowest possible settings. Oddly enough I simultaneously started having similar problems when playing games on my Windows Bootcamp installation on the same machine.\nI am not noticing any other problems besides those when gaming. Rebooting the machine does not help at all.\nWhat could be the problem and how can I solve this?\n\nA: I had this and fixed it!\nBasically something was overheating.  It would freeze as it hit the overheat temperature and then resolve once the temperature dropped about 5 degrees celsius.\nSo I downloaded some random fan speed app (link below), cranked it up to full speed and haven't had a problem since!\nhttp://www.eidac.de/\n\nA: A thread on the Diablo3 forums suggested to try and reset the SMC first. Somewhat to my surprise, this immediately solved all my performance issues both on Mac OS X, as well while gaming on Windows.\n", "Q: DVD mounted but not accessible from Finder I have burnt a set of data DVDs on my Windows PC. These read fine on the PC, but for some reason OS X misbehaves. I have Hardware Growler installed, so when I insert the disc I get a notification that the drive has been mounted (with a label I set during burning).\nThe problem the disc doesn't appear on my desktop along other drives and in Finder it is greyed out and not accessible.\nInterestingly enough if I use ForkLift.app it reads fine - files are being opened in their respective apps without any problem. Can access it from Terminal, too.\nThere is an ampersand character in the disc's label - could this be a problem?\n\nA: Indeed - it turned out the ampersand was causing the issue. The same DVD without the apostrophe in the DVD label works just fine.\n", "Q: Downgrading an iPhone 4 from iOS 6 to iOS 5.1.1 using iTunes with a restore.ipsw file Can I downgrade an iPhone 4 from iOS 6 to iOS 5.1.1 using iTunes if I have a 5.1.1 restore.ipsw file? I have watched this video on YouTube and was wondering if that works for downgrade. I dont need to sync the phone with any of my files afterwards. I just need to have it as new with 5.1.1 software.\n\nA: In short: not if you didn't bother about jailbreaking or never heard of TinyUmbrella.\nApple is very strict on installing iOS firmware. Everytime you do a restore, iTunes is verifying the firmware for the connected device with their own server by checking SHSH blobs at Apple's servers. An app like TinyUmbrella allows you backup your SHSH blobs (they are unique for every iOS device) locally or to saurik's server. This however only works the latest iOS version that is available for your iOS device.\nread this: http://www.redmondpie.com/reminder-save-your-ios-5.1.1-shsh-blobs-now-before-its-too-late/ or this: http://www.saurik.com/id/12\n\nA: Not without jailbreaking (and even then it might not work). Apple generally doesn't go backwards so iTunes needs to be cajoled, tricked or bludgeoned into ignoring the current OS and using an ipsw that it doesn't download and verify with Apple's servers.\nHave a look at the site and do some research - you can always ask a narrower question if you decide to try a jailbreak and run into a problem on a certain step. \n", "Q: i think my harddrive died? did an internet recovery, whats the status of my computer? can't restore from backup until i get home so for some reason my 2011 MBP died on my way to work this morning? when i got in and booted it up, it froze. i restarted it and got a flashing folder with a question mark on it.\nwhat does this mean exactly? how could this happen? i was literally just using it last night before i went to sleep, and then it was doing this when i woke up.\nso i read some stuff online and did an internet recovery, which i've never done before. now it's at a disk utility page asking me to choose a method to restore. i want to restore from an old Time Machine backup I have, but that's back at my apartment. is it safe to put it to sleep on this screen until i get home?\nsorry for this, i'm very confused and frustrated as to why this just happened. and my backup is old and i don't know if i backed up any system settings so i don't know if that will even work.\nAnyway...\n\n\n*\n\n*What could have caused this?

What does that error even mean?\nYou may have a hard drive that is going bad. The flashing folder means that the Mac can not find or read the needed system files to boot up.\nWhat is the current status of my computer? Is everything wiped from my HDD?\nHard to say, but probably not. You could remove your harddrive, put it in an external HD dock, and try to recover you personal files.  Or, you could restart it while holding down the \"T\" key to put it in target disk mode and then connect it to another running Mac computer via a Firewire or Thunderbolt cable. Your hard drive will show up as another disk on that computer and the can get to your files.\nEither way, I would consider replacing the hard drive.  To check for errors, in the Terminal (/Applications/Utilities), type\ngrep -i \"i/o error\" /var/log/system.log\n\nIf you see any results, your hard drive may be dying.\n3.

I am wondering if there is a utility for the mac that allows you to see the details of an SSD like the health of the drive, TBW (total bites written), how many running hours etc... In researching for an app of such a kind I found (SSDLife) for windows? It looks like to me that a program like this would be exactly what I would need. The most important information that I need to know about is the TBW (total bites written) on the drive.

The events in the other two calendars appear as invitations in my Calendar app on my iPod Touch.\n\nA: This appears to be an issue when Google is set up as a Microsoft Exchange account type (Google Sync) rather than the normal Gmail account in the Settings app. You can check that this is the case for you by opening the Settings app, going to the Mail, Contacts, Calendars section, and tapping on your Google account. If you see Exchange at the top of the page - rather than Gmail - then this applies to you. \nIt seems that in fixing an Exchange bug Apple broke Google's Microsoft Exchange implementation.\nIt also seems only to be a problem with secondary accounts.\nAs a temporary measure – until either Apple or Google have fixed this problem – you could open the Settings app, go to the Mail, Contacts, Calendars page, and Add Account... of type Gmail. You only have to turn on Calendars for this account, as the rest of the Microsoft Exchange implementation seems to be working. Then go to your original Microsoft Exchange account and turn off Calendars. You will be warned that all your Exchange ActiveSync calendars will be removed from your phone; choose to delete them. Finally, you might want to adjust the Default Calendar in the Calendars section of the Mail, Contacts, Calendars settings page\nA few caveats with using a Gmail type account for calendars:\n\n\n*\n\n*Google event invitations will no longer work\n\n*Syncing for calendars is now pull, rather than push; i.e. changing an event on another device will not be reflected immediately in your iOS calendars\n\n\nAlso, beware that events you have declined will not appear in iOS, and you may have accidentally declined events while getting frustrated at the iOS 6.0.1 calendar problem.

I saw an image on a rumor for a new Apple connector to attach the new iOS devices to my Mac using the Thunderbolt port.\nThis would be great because the one port on my MacBook Air that isn't in use all the time is the Thunderbolt port. The image looks badly doctored, however, and I can't find any substantiated evidence that this product exists.\nIs there a way to connect new iOS devices to the monitor port on new Macs?\n\n\nA: Nope. I don't know where that came from, but it's certainly not a current product, and it's unlikely to be a future one.\nThunderbolt requires expensive chips relative to other connector technologies, which take up a fair bit of PCB space, which is at a premium in iOS devices and iPods (just look at the iPhone 5 teardown). In fact, reducing the size internally is a big part of the reason they went to the Lightning connector in the first place.\nAdditionally, chips are required in the connector itself. The Lightning connector is much too small to contain the required chips in their current incarnation (the two connectors aren't to scale in that picture, the Thunderbolt connector is much bigger than the Lightning connector).\nFinally, there wouldn't be much benefit to using a Thunderbolt connector with iPods or iOS devices. The flash memory in them is not particularly fast, certainly not to the point that it would come close to making use of Thunderbolt's 10 Gb/s connection. USB 3 is a far more likely evolution for Lightning based devices, and would still provide plenty of bandwidth.\n", "Q: Disable all Notification Center sounds?

So I've wanted this for a really long time but I'm not 100% sure how to do it. I basically want to be able to have iTunes play a radio station when I come home. \nI was thinking of being able to have a script run every ten seconds or so to see if my iPhone has joined my wireless network, thereby opening iTunes and playing that radio station. After it starts playing, it kills the script from checking again till 12 hours later. (I'm giving an example of 12 hours since I don't want to be at home already and suddenly have music suddenly starting for no reason). \nSo where should I start? Am I even starting in the right place? Is there something better than this? I need some help and direction! I feel what I want is relatively simple...  :-/\n\nA: For a start, you could look at ControlPlane to trigger iTunes when you come home.\nfrom http://www.controlplaneapp.com/about/ :\n\nControlPlane allows you to build configuration profiles, contexts in ControlPlane lingo, for your Mac based on where you are or what you are doing.  ControlPlane determines where you are or what you are doing based on a number of available evidence sources and then automatically reconfigures your Mac based on your preferences.  Evidence sources can include your current location, visible WiFi networks, attached USB devices, running applications and more.  \n\n\nA: It would be helpful if you could provide a bit more information about your expected functionality. It sounds like you've got a Mac in your house — does it stay on all the time?\nA couple ideas spring to mind, but how you put them together is going to depend on what specifically you want to happen.\nLocation Checking\nIf you have your iPhone with you, and it automatically connects to your Wi-Fi, that's probably the best way to check if you're at home.\nFirst, note your iPhone's Wi-Fi MAC address, which you'll find in Settings → General → About → Wi-Fi Address.\nYou can use the arp -a command in Terminal (or a script) to print the Mac's list of known addresses on the local network, then use grep to check if your iPhone's address is in there:\narp -a | grep -i IPHONE_MAC_HERE\n\nThat will print the ARP entry if one matches your iPhone's address, and print nothing if there isn't.\nIt's important to note that this may only work reliably if your iPhone is set to sync over Wi-Fi with your Mac. arp -a only lists addresses it has recently communicated with - it doesn't know your iPhone is there unless it talks to your Mac. Because the Wi-Fi syncing causes the iPhone to send an identification message when it joins a network (to see if any computers it syncs with are online), it will get added to your Mac's ARP table when you come home, but it may not if you don't have Wi-Fi syncing set up.\nScripting iTunes Playback\nIf you don't use something like Controlplane (mentioned in kraymer's answer), AppleScript is the best way to control iTunes playback.\nIt's pretty straightforward:\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n    play playlist \"Music\"\nend tell\n\nWill start playing your main library. Change \"Music\" to any one of your playlist names if you have a specific one you want to play. You can also add set shuffle of playlist \"Music\" to yes on the line before the play line if you want shuffle on.\nYou can also start playback within a shell script:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"iTunes\" to play playlist \"Music\"'\n\nExample Script\n#!/bin/bash\n\niPhoneMAC='78:a3:e4:4C:8f:a9' # From Settings > General > About > Wi-Fi Address\n\n# Check if the iPhone is in the ARP table\narp -a | grep -i $iPhoneMAC > /dev/null # Silence output\n\n# Repeat check every 30 seconds, if the iPhone address isn't detected\nwhile [[ $? == 1 ]]; do \n    sleep 30\n    arp -a | grep -i $iPhoneMAC > /dev/null\ndone\n\n# Once the iPhone is detected, play music\nosascript -e 'tell application \"iTunes\" to play playlist \"Music\"'\n\nThis is a pretty simplistic version, but it should be a good starting point to make something closer to what you want. When you run the script, it will check for the iPhone address (make sure to put the proper one in the script) every thirty seconds until it detects it, then it will play iTunes.\nSuggested Enhancements\n\n\n*\n\n*It's a one-shot deal, once it detects the iPhone it plays the music and stops checking. You'll want to figure out what logic you want behind it (i.e. should it launch once per weekday, so it plays when you come home from work, or do you want it playing every time you enter the house).\n\n*Running it via OS X's launchd functionality (which allows for various scheduling and repeating of scripts) may be a good idea. There are lots of resources on this around, both on Ask Different and elsewhere.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you do it this way, you may not need the loop functionality, launchd could be responsible for running it at an interval to check.\n\n\n*Some sort of mechanism to avoid unnecessary checking once you've actually come home and the music has played. Could just be a long sleep once it plays the music, or something a bit smarter, based on when you want it to check.\n\n\nA: Adding on to what everyone else says, there's another option for you to consider if you don't mind leaving Bluetooth enabled on your phone (and since the newer iPhones use Bluetooth 4.0, it won't be nearly as bad with draining your battery as previous incarnations). This website details an app called Bluetooth Proximity Tasker, that lets you script various actions when your system detects your iPhone (or other Bluetooth-enabled device) with a certain signal strength.\nI haven't personally tested this app, but I've tried another one that I'd found a month or two ago that successfully was able to detect my iPhone and disable the password protection on my iMac (though that app was both free and lacked the custom strength selection option).\n", "Q: What special about Apple AirPort Extreme? I considering to replace my old wifi router and purchase AirPort Extreme.\nWhy airport extreme feature that make it price is higher than common router WIFI?\nit is faster transfer data?\nBetter WIFI range?\netc...\n\nA: Wireless is a complicated topic and you need to consult a speciality website like smallnetbuilder.com if you want to understand things like range, performance, and capabilities of different routers.\nThe Apple Extreme/Express are more expensive, require an Apple utility that runs only on iOS/OS X/Windows, and are not the most feature rich.  However, they are simple to use if you live in a mostly Apple world and have some unique Apple features that can be useful in that world.  For example, it's dead simple to wirelessly extend an Extreme/Express network and Apple Express routers can be hooked to speakers to use with AirPlay.\nI just used three Expresses to replace an old 802.11g network (it used four old Linksys routers wirelessly extended to get about 50% coverage) at a friend's condo.

Since the code set for that device is ARMv6 you can expect more and more apps to be dropping support as time goes by.

I'd like to add it back (it's on the external drive I cloned from my original HD)\nHere's what the partition layout looks like right now:\n$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *120.0 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         119.7 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk0s3\n/dev/disk1\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *750.2 GB   disk1\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk1s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         749.3 GB   disk1s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               650.0 MB   disk1s3\n/dev/disk2\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                  Apple_HFS FusionHD               *744.5 GB   disk2\n\nDoes anyone know the diskUtil commands to add the recovery HD?  Ideally after the fact, which is where I'm at now?\n\nA: You'll need to partition the drives first, putting the Recovery partition on one of your physical drives. It can't be part of the Fusion drive as its unlikely you can boot directly into a Core Storage logical volume (you need a boot loader separately).\nTake note of the partition structure in this Ars Technica article about the Fusion drive.\nThe best way to do this is probably to start fresh by reinstalling Mountain Lion on either the SSD or HDD, then repeat the Fusion process with just the proper partition.\nOnce you've done a standard install, check your partitions by running diskutil list, which should give output similar to this:\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *120.0 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            119.2 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n\nMake note of the identifier of the Macintosh HD partition (disk0s2 in this case).\nThen do the same steps you performed before, but change the diskutil corestorage create fusion_volume_group command so to specify the disk0s2 (or whatever the equivalent in your case is), and the identifier of the drive you didn't install OS X on. The resulting command should be similar to diskutil corestorage create fusion_volume_group disk0s2 disk1 but make sure you've got the identifiers correct. The key is that we want to make a volume group out of just the Macintosh HD partition, not the whole drive (so that the EFI and Recovery partitions don't get wiped out). Then follow the rest of the procedure as you did before.\n\nA: Ok so I have solved the problem without re-formatting or re-installing. Hopefully most people won't wind up in this situation.  See @robmathers answer for tips on how to avoid deleting your Recovery HD in the first place.\nWARNING the following commands are fairly low-level and may cause you to loose data. Take proper precautions (backup, clone, etc).\nBut for anyone in my situation after the RecoveryHD is already gone, here is what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup all data / clone your drive\n\n*Create a bootable USB (or use an existing HD) with 10.8\n\n*Boot into that alternate drive (so you're not modifying the HD you've currently mounted)\n\n*Unmount the Fusion HD\n\n*Open terminal, switch to superuser and follow these instructions:\n\n\nList the current configuration, and make a note of which drives you'll be modifying. Your exact sizes and GUIDs will be different than mine. It is crucial to use your numbers instead of mine.\ndiskutil corestorage list\n\nTake note of the UUID of the physical drive you're adding the Recovery to.\ndiskutil list\n\nTake note of the exact size in bytes of the Recovery on the current startup disk (disk2s3 might be different for you).\ndiskutil info disk2s3\n\nResize the Physical Volume for the drive you want to add the Recovery partition to. To determine the size, look @ the existing Recovery partition on the USB. In my case it was just under 1GB.  For the following command, pvUUID is the UUID of the drive you're adding the Recovery to, size is 1GB less than the current size.  \ndiskutil coreStorage resizeDisk <pvUUID> <size> JHFS+ Recovery 784220160B\n\nNOTE: you may need to unmount the volumes repeatedly in the following steps. OSX tends to aggressively re-mount the volumes.\nRepartition the new \"Recovery\" partition from a jHFS+ to Apple_Boot. First, take note of the exact start/size of the partition. \ngpt show disk0\n\n     start       size  index  contents\n        0          1         PMBR\n        1          1         Pri GPT header\n        2         32         Pri GPT table\n       34          6\n       40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n   409640  246725744      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n247135384     262144\n**247397528    1269528       3  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC**\n248667056    1402591\n250069647         32         Sec GPT table\n250069679          1         Sec GPT header \n\nNow remove the partition, and re-add it with a different UUID (the UUID is what determines the type of partition)\ngpt remove -b 247397528 -s 1269528 -t 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk0\ngpt add -b 247397528 -s 1269528 -t 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk0\n\nNow copy the entire Recovery partition from the good one to this new one:\ndd if=/dev/disk2s3 of=/dev/disk0s3\n\nMany thanks to the following sites for reference.

For the following command, lvUUID is the UUID of the Logical Volume and size is equal to current size of the Logical Volume - size of the Recovery partition (or 1GB less than the current size if you follow Jess Bowers' solution word by word):\ndiskutil coreStorage resizeVolume <lvUUID> <size>\n\nAnd right after that resizeDisk... and the rest of his solution worked just like a charm.\nPS.

The numbers should match the output of diskutil, but if not either reboot or trust gpt over diskutil.\nThe sizes are not listed in bytes but sectors, which are probably 4KiB. It may be better to tell which is which by ratio than by exact size.\ngpt -r show /dev/disk0\n\nNow remove the partition corresponding to \"Recovery HD\". After a reboot that had changed from disk0s3 to disk0s4 for me.\ngpt remove -i 4\n\nAfter that I stopped getting the error about not being able to create a recovery partition.

Questions\nWhy do versions differ? \nShould we trust Oracle's verification routine?\n\nIn some cases, the version verified by Oracle is different from the version shown at the command line. \nExample\n\nThat example, in detail\nAccording to Oracle in the browser: \n\n\n*\n\n*Java 7 Update 9\n\n\nAccording to the Java Console: \nJava Plug-in 10.9.2.05\nUsing JRE version 1.7.0_09-b05 Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM\n\nAccording to the java command: \nsh-3.2$ java -version\njava version \"1.8.0-ea\"\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0-ea-b58)\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.0-b02, mixed mode)\n\n\nA: Problematic uses of terminology\n\n\nWhere Oracle describes first Java for \"your operating system\" then \"for your computer\", the download is more accurately only for things that use the Internet plug-in:\n\n\n*\n\n*jre-7u13-macosx-x64.dmg installs what's required for that plug-in, but for things that use Java without the plug-in, this installer from Oracle does nothing. \n\n\nHint\nOn OS X: if you want a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) from Oracle to be like the JRE in the diagram below for both (a) things that use the Internet plug-in and (b) things that use Java without that plug-in: \n\n\n*\n\n*at Java SE Downloads, ignore the JRE; download and install the JDK\n\n*and – if you require a greater version – at JDK 8 Early Access Releases — Java.net, ignore the JRE; download and install the JDK.\nAdditional explanation\nApple's distribution of Java is more than an Internet plug-in.\nThe Oracle routine pictured above leads to nothing more than a plug-in. Other parts of Apple's distribution are unaffected by Oracle's installer.\nInstallation of a JDK from Oracle will place a folder at the following path, overriding (not removing) the JDK from Apple: \n/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines\nWithin each JDK there is a JRE. Please see the diagram below. \nOracle do actually document this (although it has taken 3 1/2 years to find it) See Oracle's page on OSX command line \n\nThe Java Runtime (JRE) that you download from java.com or oracle.com contains a plugin to run Java content from your browser. In order to use the command line tools, you will need to download the Java Development Kit (JDK). The JRE and JDK are separate and can coexist on your system. Only one JRE can be installed on Mac OS X. There can be multiple JDKs installed on a system, as many as you wish.\n\nThoughts\nThe huge red button \"Download Java Now\" is too simplistic. Too many users, including some technical experts, are ultimately puzzled by the end result. \nWhere a Mac browser is detected by Oracle's server, one of the following phrases might be less misleading: \n\n\n*\n\n*Download Java for your browser\n\n*Download the Internet-plug-in\n\n\nCritically\nOracle should offer some explanation in its Mac FAQ (Information and system requirements for installing and using Mac Java 7).

For these users, Oracle's effective separation of things may be welcomed. \nAn example: \n\n\n*\n\n*in Safari and other browsers I use the most recent Java 7 Update 13\n\n*for Wuala.app and for other things that do not use the Internet plug-in I use early access, developer preview release Java 8 (Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment build 1.8.0-ea-b75).\n\n\nYMMV. \n\nReference items\nJava Help Center\n\n\n*\n\n*under Terminology, see Versions.\n\n\nJava Platform Standard Edition 7 Documentation\nIn the diagram below, from that page, focus on: \n\n\n*\n\n*to the left, the vertical span of the JRE\n\n*the orange uppermost layer of the JRE – Java Web Start and Apple/Java Plug-in\n\nRelated\nHow can I switch between the two Java versions in Mountain Lion now that Java Preferences is gone?\n", "Q: How to determine iOS app usage frequency for iPhone or iPad I have over 200 apps on my iPhone 4 (32GB).  No one needs that many apps, right?  I want to organize my installed apps based on how frequently I use them, and/or how recently I last used them.  I could probably take a qualitative, subjective stab at this myself, but I'd like to have some data, just so I don't toss an app that I may have used, but don't remember using.  Yeah, I know that deleting isn't forever with apps-- but having geeky data makes me feel good.\nSo far, I have not found a way to do this.  I've seen apps mentioned here on AskDifferent that purport to do such a thing, but have not tried any of them.  For some reason, I seem to recall Googling this several months ago, and running across an article describing a way to glean usage information from the backup file(s) that iTunes creates.  I can no longer find that article-- not sure if it's gone or if I'm just not using the same search terms as before.\nNote that my iPhone is not jailbroken, nor do I wish to jail-break it.  I'm not necessarily even interested in an iOS app that gets me this information; I'm simply interested in it any way that it can be had.  If that is via Terminal on the desktop, that's fine.\nKnowing this kind of usage information would also be objectively useful if I'm trying to implement some kind of app/folder organizational strategy.  Otherwise, I'm left to my own intuition about how often I use things, which can be false, or in the least, inefficient.\n\nA: I think I may have found an astoundingly low-tech solution to this problem, and it was right under my nose.\nEver since iOS became \"multi-tasking\" capable (I say that tongue-in-cheek, as we all know that most apps that get backgrounded aren't still running, they've just had their state saved until used again), the Task Switcher, accessible via a double-press of the Home Button, shows you a more-or-less \"use-ordered\" list of your apps.  Unless you deliberately open the Task Switcher and kill the apps, they linger in there... I guess forever, or until you reboot the device.\nSo, if I clear all those out, and then just go about my business using my device for a while, and occasionally look at what apps are in my first 3 or 4 \"pages\" in the Task Switcher, that gives me a decent idea of which apps I use the most-- or at least can tell me the ones that I've used \"most recently\".  Those apps that are on the far right \"page\" of Task Switcher are the least used (or at least the ones that were used \"least recently\").\nEDIT: As of iOS9, the order of applications displayed in the Task Switcher is reversed.  The most recently foregrounded app is on the far right.\nI suppose a person could extend this into a true exercise in statistical geekery by noting the order of the apps on a schedule... say every morning or every evening (or more or less often)... over a period of time; a week, a month, whatever.  Then you could compile that into useful info for yourself.\n\nA: I'm sure people have probably realized now how to get around-about-answer on this subject but I have been searching for an answer for an hour and figured out a way to kind of get an answer. If you have iOS 8 (now that this post is years after the original question..) \nSettings > General > Usage > Battery Usage\nAnd you can see which apps have used the most battery power in the last 24 hours, and also in the last 7 days. \nWhich answered my question! Hope this helps someone. \n\nA: This is available in IOS 9.2\nJust discovered after reading this list that if you do as previously suggested\nSettings > General > Usage > Battery Usage\nand tap within the list. Then each entry will display hours of on screen use and hours of background use, as well as the overall percentage. It works within the 24 hours view and the Last 7 Days view.\n\nA: To my knowledge there's no way to do this without jail breaking (I'm not sure there is even if you do jailbreak).\nBecause iOS apps essentially don't run in the background (with exceptions for specific types of apps — i.e. navigation and music players), as soon as you open another app, they have to shut down, and thus have no way of monitoring what's else is going on. Additionally, the sandboxing enforced on iOS apps (at least in the App Store) restricts what system information they know. Even if it were able to monitor in the background, an app shouldn't be able to access information about other running apps.\n\nA: Hooked - App Habit Tracker en App Store - iTunes - Apple https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hooked-app-habit-tracker/id966290813?l=es&mt=8\n\nA: There is an app called Hooked that I use to track app usage to help me stay productive. It tracks app usage.\nWhile battery usage is a helpful general guide, it's very misleading as something like watching videos or playing games uses far more battery life than texting. But you might be using texting far more often than playing a battery-killing game.\n", "Q: MacBook IR adaptor I have a MacBook AIR without IR and an Apple remote control (bought without knowing my laptop didn't have IR). I am looking for an IR adaptor. Can you please recommend me one that works on Mac?\n\nA: Have a look at Mira and Remote Buddy, which are programs to enable the Apple Remote on systems that don't have it built-in (they also provide expanded functionality I believe). They both have hardware compatibility lists that should provide you with some good suggestions (here for Mira, and here for Remote Buddy.\n", "Q: messages disappeared from some mailboxes and smart mailboxes following removal of an account from Mail I upgraded to Mountain Lion recently. My email changed as well. I used to have my 40K emails in different mailboxes and now I realize that the new way to do so is with 'smart mailboxes' (I actually like it).\nProblem\nAt home, with an iMac: the transition to ML was OK until today when I had a problem with my outgoing emails. I decided to take the approach of 'delete the account and rewrite the settings': \n\n\n*\n\n*that caused all my emails (except 200 that are 'live' on my server) to disappear from the iMac.\n\n\nElsewhere: at my office, everything is on a Mac Pro, which also runs Mountain Lion. \nQuestions\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there any way to retrieve all my emails? (Do I still have the old email's folder somewhere?) \n\n*If not, then with the data on the Mac Pro at the office: how can I export/import back home?\nThanks!\n\nA: Removing an account from Mail removes all local copies of messages for that account. \n\n  \n*\n  \n*Is there any way to retrieve all my emails? (Do I still have the old email's folder somewhere?)\n  \n\nIf the account was for an e-mail service that uses IMAP or Exchange Web Services\nIn Mail, simply recreate the account. With IMAP, all messages: \n\n\n*\n\n*are (primarily) stored on the server\n\n*may be (secondarily) cached by e-mail clients such as Mail in OS X\n\n\n– and so recreation of the account should regain access to everything that is on the server. \nIf the account was for an e-mail service that uses POP\nIt's normal for Post Office Protocol (POP) to not leave a copy of a message on the server after that message has been delivered. (Metaphorically: your postman or postwoman does not keep copies of your mail.) However, e-mail client software may be configured to stray from that default, to leave some things on a POP server. \nIf you used POP for your account configuration: \n\n\n*\n\n*be prepared for the possibility of not finding some things on the POP server\n\n*it may be desirable to use Mail on your other Mac (the Mac Pro) to save or export data.\nIf the deleted messages were on the iMac alone, and if you had no backup on a separate disk\nThe likelihood of recovering data from JHFS+ may be low. \nOS X tends to quickly reuse space after that space is marked as free, especially if that space is an an area of hard disk that is preferred for performance. \nMobile Time Machine local snapshots provide handy backups, but this feature of Time Machine is laptop-oriented (probably not enabled on your iMac). \n", "Q: Apple Time Capsule will not start -up, light stays amber I unplugged my Time Capsule today to tidy up the wires.

If so, try to connect to it and see if there's anything mentioned in the Air Port Utility app.\nIf it doesn't, I managed to find this discussion on the Apple Discussions forum regarding Time Capsules being stuck on the amber light at startup. The possible problems suggested by those forum-goers include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Failing power supply\n\n*Failing HDD\n\n\nIf your Time Capsule is within warranty, it'd be worth it to take it in and have them look at it. Unless it's a failing HDD, however, it's not looking like there's a lot in the way of DIY repairs for the device.\n", "Q: How to deal with WindowServer kernel panics, three NVIDIA-related KEXTs in the backtrace, whilst using Google Chrome?

Amongst open issues for Chromium there are currently nine matches for panic NVIDIA and one match for panic NVDA. At least one of the Intel-oriented titles includes discussion of kernel panics with NVIDIA hardware.  \nCritically\nGoogle Chrome may report itself as current when in fact it is outdated. Today, for example, 21.0.1180.89 (stable in August 2012) is reportedly up-to-date – \n\n– but that's not true; I download another copy from Google and find something more recent: \n\nAdvice\nUse something other than Google Chrome to check that Google Chrome is up-to-date. \nAt the time of writing, Chrome Releases: Stable updates shows 23.0.1271.64 in a post on 2012-11-06. \nThird party kernel extensions\nIn my experience, some types of unexplained panic may be avoided by paying attention to third party KEXTs.\nVirtualBox\nYour installation of VirtualBox should be updated – 3.2.0 was outdated in June 2010. \nEven with recent version 4.2.2 of VirtualBox, with NVIDIA hardware in a MacBookPro5,2 I sometimes find kernel panics. For these incidents, not all .panic files point to NVDA or VirtualBox but I have a strong sense that VirtualBox is at least partly contributory to the issues. \n(Side note: 4.2.4 at http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/virtualbox/downloads/index.html … I'll give that a go.)\n\nA: Looks like you have a Mid 2010 15-inch MacBook Pro, just like myself.\nMid 2010 15-inch MacBooks Pro come with a defective NVIDIA GPU that may cause unexpected restarts, kernel panics, black screens See Apple's support article.\n\nA: Just so everyone knows, I had to bite the bullet and take it in to be fixed, but as it turns out this was a known fault in my line of Macbook Pros (lucky me) so it was fully fixed with no cost.\n", "Q: Is it easy to mount my Time Capsule after a clean install (without any restore) so that I can copy individual files from it? People say it is possible but I am suspicious. I want to clean install and start fresh with nothing. Then I can access my Time Capsule that has my backup and copy any files I want. How easy or difficult is to use my Time Capsule as a external hard drive from where I can copy stuff? What I am particularly worried about is:\n1) Will my new, clean and fresh Mountain Lion installation be able to recognize and mount Time Capsule on Finder?\n2) Will I be able to easily locate, browse and copy the files from my last backup to my computer?\n3) Will I have any permission problems to copy the files?\n4) Will my new computer try to use Time Capsule to make backups and wipe out my previous backup? (that would be very bad!)\nThanks!\n\nA: All the below answers assume that you are using TimeMachine for your backups on your TimeCapsule.\n1) Will my new, clean and fresh Mountain Lion installation be able to recognize and mount Time Capsule on Finder?\nYes\n2) Will I be able to easily locate, browse and copy the files from my last backup to my computer?\nYes - you will be able to find whole directory structure in folders with various time-date stamps.\n3) Will I have any permission problems to copy the files?\nNo\n4) Will my new computer try to use Time Capsule to make backups and wipe out my previous backup? (that would be very bad!)\nYour new install may ask about using TimeCapsule for TimeMachine backups.  If you have a new hard drive, it will start a fresh structure.  If you have the same hard drive, it will probably continue with the same backup you currently have. But it will not wipe out previous backups, beyond the normal default backup intervals (saving once an hour for 24 hrs, once a day for a month, once a week after that). \n\nA: To browse your old backups after a fresh install, make sure the Time Machine icon is shown in the menu bar, click the icon, and choose Browse other Backup Disks. This way you can copy specific data and applications to the new computer. \nYou can give your computer a new name after the fresh install. This should keep the old backups separated from new backups. \n", "Q: Updating from iOS 4.x without iTunes My old computer in which I had iTunes on is broken.  So my question is, are there any other ways of updating an iPad without having iTunes? If not, are there any stores that will do it?\n\nA: While iOS 5 does, indeed, support iTunesless software update, previous versions don't, which is your case. \nTherefore I suggest you to go to any Apple Store, which will certainly help you with your issue, or try any other Apple Retailler.\n", "Q: Sharing a single Dropbox between multiple accounts on one Mac - possible? This seems like it should be easy, but...\nMy partner and I use a single Dropbox.com account to keep all of our joint projects synced up between our computers - and this has been working great for years. We've now added a MacBook Air to the mix, and we each have accounts on it and can grab it and go when we need to do some remote work.\nI've been trying to get the Dropbox synced to the Air - but I want to have it in the \"Shared\" directory so that we both can access it - it shouldn't matter who is logged in. This doesn't seem to be working.\nI can located the Dropbox in the shared directory fine - but when I change the user who is logged in that user has no permissions to sync the Dropbox or access the files.\nI can get it to work if I create a separate ~/Dropbox folder for each user, but this ends up with 50GB duplicated twice over if the entire Dropbox syncs - a particularly ridiculous waste of space on an SSD.\nAny ideas how to make this sharing work????\n\nA: One method I've used with some success is to set the permissions on the folder to allow multiple user accounts to \"Read & Write\" to the /Users/Shared/Dropbox/ folder.\nYou can do this by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Going to the Get Info (Cmd+i) window on the /Users/Shared/Dropbox folder\n\n*Unlocking to edit permissions\n\n*Clicking on the \"+\" icon to add another user account and setting the \"Privilege\" to \"Read & Write\"\n\n*Click on the gear triangle dropdown to the left of the lock icon, choose \"Apply to enclosed items...\" and confirm that you wish to do this (irreversible) change\n\n\nI'm not very sure, but you may still have some permission related issues if you get files from another Mac's user account. That may require assigning ownership correctly.\n\nA: While not a complete solution, you can choose which dropbox folders to sync on your second account, thus reducing the amount of HDD space required and unnecessary duplicate files. \n\nA: You can do this using ACLs, which will avoid permissions problems when new files are created:\nsudo chmod -R +a \"$USER allow read,write,append,delete,list,search,add_subdirectory,delete_child,file_inherit,directory_inherit\" \"$DIR\"\n\nwhere $USER is the username of the other user, and $DIR is whatever directory (Dropbox or otherwise) you want the other user to have full permissions in.\nWe use this to share a single Dropbox folder between four users (2 adults with full access, 2 kids with access to their subdirectory only), and it has been working well for us.  The only limitation is that the user running Dropbox has to be logged in and running Dropbox.  The other users don't have the Dropbox icon and status info in the menu bar.\n\nA: You can also leave the Dropbox folder in the default location and symlink the ~/Dropbox into /Users/Shared/ and enable permissions with Terminal.app thusly:\n    user@mac: ~$ ln -s ~/Dropbox /Users/Shared/Dropbox\n    user@mac: ~$ chmod -R 777 ~/Dropbox\n\n\nA: I wanted to use this same solution to work around a Dropbox for Business account with the \"Allow only one Dropbox account per computer\" restriction enabled.\nThe ACL solution is promising, but I encountered frequent permissions issues; it turns out ACLs are not inherited by existing files that are copied/moved into a directory, which is a deal breaker.\nHere's the solution on which I eventually settled; this assumes all local administrator users will share access to the Dropbox.\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose a user to run Dropbox. The Dropbox folder will reside in this user's Home folder, and the user must be logged in for the Dropbox to sync.\n\n*Change the umask for user applications to 002. This will make new files group-writable by default; this should not be dangerous, since your user's group is probably wheel, and all members of wheel already have sudo permissions.\nFor OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 and up:\nsudo launchctl config user umask 002\n\nFor older versions, see the Apple Support article Setting a custom umask in OS X.\n\n*Restart your computer for the umask change to take effect.\n\n*Recursively modify the permissions of your shared Dropbox folder to give full permissions to both user and group:\ncd $HOME\nsudo chmod -R ug=rwX Dropbox/\n\n\n*For each user, add the group write permission to all pre-existing user files:\ncd $HOME\nsudo chmod -R g+w Desktop/ Documents/ Downloads/ Movies/ Music/ Pictures/ Public/ Sites/\nsudo chmod g-w Desktop/ Documents/ Downloads/ Movies/ Music/ Pictures/ Public/ Sites/\n\nThe first chmod applies group write recursively; the second chmod removes group write from the directories themselves to keep them protected.\nEverything should now work as intended. The second user can add the first user's Dropbox to the Finder sidebar, and Dropbox runs surprisingly well on the background user account. Only the Finder integration and menu bar status are missing.\nSince each OS X user account can use this method to share its own Dropbox, this essentially provides for unlimited Dropbox accounts on a single machine.\n\nA: My first thought would be to partition the HD (or SSD). One partition would have OS X, apps, user folders, etc., and the second would have only the Dropbox folder. Select the icon for the partition and check Ignore Permissions, and both users should have access. However, I've had volumes where I've checked Ignore Permissions revert so other users can't access this, but it's a quick fix.\n\nA: This is simple actually. \n\n\n*\n\n*Login to 1st account.\n\n*Sync dropbox to the shared directory. Let's say /user/shared/dropbox.\n\n*Give permission to this shared directory to 2nd account. (to give 2nd account permission to edit/delete)\n\n*Login to 2nd account.\n\n*Sync dropbox to shared directory.\n\n*\n\n*If you do this directly you will get an error that dropbox folder already exists.\n\n*Therefore, delete the folder first.\n\n*Sync shared directory again.\n\n\n*Since 2nd account is the creator of the shared directory now. Make sure 2nd account gives permission to this shared directory to 1st account.\n\n\nA: You can use umask to set up restriction to file permission.\nDefault setting is 022 so file mask is 644 (or 755 for dirs).\nSimple way is to set umask 002 (in file /etc/profile or some others), but this leads to security issue.\nOops, this is answer on the file permission problem when 2 users work under one Dropbox account on the same PC.\nAnd the second one remark Mac users must edit umask in files /etc/launchd-user.conf or /etc/launchd.conf (see http://support.apple.com/kb/ht2202 for details)\n", "Q: Are Passbook Passes Available Outside the Sandbox? With Third Party software, or manually mounting the iPhone to your computer, it's possible to access a limited amount of information. Music, Photos, and App Data. Without breaking the Sandbox, you can never get to the OS itself, and certain data stores.\nAre Passbook Passes accessible within this Sandbox? I'd be awesome to see what data is actually contained within them.\n\nA: I wrote to Macroplant, who make the iExplorer utility that I bought some time ago, and they pointed me to the fact that Passbook Cards are available in the backup data.\nWhen using iExplorer, they're located in the 'Backup Explorer' section, under HomeDomain/Library/Passes/Cards, the Backup Explorer section is apparently a logical mapping of ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/.\nThat's good enough for me, since data is routinely backed up. I can backup and instantly access my current cards.\nThank you Mike, on the Macroplant Support Team!\n", "Q: Why does Terminal swallow Ctrl+up/down keystrokes? In Terminal.app on Snow Leopard, the key combinations Ctrl+↑ and Ctrl+↓ don't get passed through correctly. Instead Terminal.app receives a single ↑ or ↓ key stroke.\nI have verified this by running cat -v, which prints the code ^[[A for both Ctrl+↑ and ↑, and the code ^[[B for both Ctrl+↓ and ↓.\nI have looked through the keyboard shortcut settings in System Preferences, but nothing is mapped to them. Furthermore, the keystrokes work in MacVim (I first noticed this issue when these keystrokes didn't work for me in vim in the terminal).\nI'm also running iTerm2, which doesn't receive Ctrl+↑ or Ctrl+↓ at all (as tested with cat -v).\nWhere can I figure out what's eating my Ctrl+↑ and Ctrl+↓ keystrokes in Terminal.app and iTerm2?\n\nA: In the Terminal preferences, go to Settings and select Keyboard in the panel.

On my iphone, I use the Podcasts app and I have all of my podcasts set to auto subscribe and auto download.  When I check the app in the morning, I see new podcasts showing up but there is a button with an arrow button next to them to show me there is something new that i can download. (see picture below).  So the autosubscribe is working but the autodownload is not.\nWhen i click on that button below, it then says . .\"Preparing to download\". and then it eventually downloads if I wait long enough.\n\nThat is not my understanding on what \"auto download\" means to me.  Is there anything that I am doing wrong ?  How can I have it where it will literally automatically download new podcasts to my iphone when they appear online without me having to manually click anything on that particular podcast so I can just see it and start listening to it without it having to download or stream at that time.\n\nA: Go to Settings, then scroll down and tap on Podcasts app icon:\n\nSo I'm assuming you turned \"Auto-Downloads\" on...\nThen tap \"Episodes to Keep\" and specify which episodes you want to keep. (Depending on your listening habits, I'd not keep this setting on \"All\" because it can quickly eat up your available memory. Mine is set on \"Last 3 Episodes\" which gives me plenty of time to listen to them.)\nThen go back. To address your issue you may want to turn on \"Use Cellular Data\" which is Off by default. What might happen in your case is that your phone disconnects from WiFi when it's not on. (This is done to conserve battery.) But in this case this setting will prevent the Podcast app from auto-downloading. Keep in mind though, that turning this setting on can quickly use up your cellular plan's data limit. So check with your cellular provider if you have enough data quota to last your billing cycle without incurring additional charges.\n\nA: Make sure you have also set which podcasts to keep - i.e. last three, last two, etc. \nEnsure you have enough free space on your iPhone\nFinally, make sure that the Podcasts app is running in the background. If the app is not running, there is no way for it to auto-download. To ensure the app is running in the background, double-click the Home button when in the Home Screen to see the active programs list at the bottom. \nI would even leave the Podcasts app in view not pushing it to the background overnight, so the podcasts could get downloaded.  Make sure you don't have the battery on Low-Power mode, which shuts off background processing.\nFinally, make sure to have the latest version of the app installed - there was a recent update from a week ago.\n\nA: Actually it is. All the apps in the switcher are currently running - which is proved by the fact that Apple said so, and also because you can actually close them in the switcher (so they had to be running if you can close them). \nAnyway, to answer the OP's question. It sounds like if you didn't have the cellular data option turned on, your app thought it couldn't connect, and that's why it didn't download automatically (in other words, it can't download if it's not connected). To make sure it can always connect, turn on the cellular data option (although make sure you have enough data available on your plan to use). That should allow it stay connected, which should allow it to auto-download properly. \n", "Q: How can an iPhoto Library be shared between users in a way that facilitates backing up to Time Machine? I'm aware that there has been a similar question that points towards Apple's own guidance on sharing iPhoto Libraries.\nApple's solutions aren't compatible with Time Machine - it can't be used to back up an external drive and a disk image appears as a single file, meaning the whole image would have to be backed up every time it changes, rather than just the changes.\nI currently have my iPhoto library in the /Users/Shared and it sort of works, except for regular permissions issues. I can cope with these OK, but my wife finds them confusing and frustrating.\nAs a general rule, photos are imported in my account and I manage Events, Faces, Places and PhotoStreams. My wife generally just wants access to the photos to share them and occasionally to create albums.\nIs there a better solution, possibly one involving Hazel, Automator and/or AppleScript?\nCurrently running OS X 10.8.2 and iPhoto '11 (9.4.2).\n\nA: *\n\n*You don't have to put the Library on a Disk Image. You can put it on any drive formatted Mac OS Extended (Journaled) - a USB/FireWire/Thunderbolt drive. Time Machine can back up externals too. \n\n*From your description - all your wife wants is access and to make occasional albums, then iPhoto Sharing is more simple than trying to share the whole Library.\nIf you want the other user to be able to see the pics, but not add to, change or alter your library, then enable Sharing in your iPhoto (Preferences -> Sharing), leave iPhoto running and use Fast User Switching to open the other account. In that account, enable 'Look For Shared Libraries'. Your Library will appear in the other source pane.\nAny user can drag a pic from the Shared Library to their own in the iPhoto Window.\nRemember iPhoto must be running in both accounts for this to work.\n\nA: It seems to me, that there is currently no good an working solution.\nI have tried to run my iPhoto Library in a growing sparse image, yet iPhoto did complain in the beginning about permission that needed to be repaired - later it didn't even open the library any more on the other account.\nI hope that there will be a solution coming up, because having to share my iPhoto Library is work critical for me.\n", "Q: Mac OS X with swap turned off uses 6 GB of space in a few hours of heavy use I have few GBs (5,38 GB at the moment) of free space on my hard disk (MacBook Pro 2010, 10.7.5). Few hours after I turn on/reboot my computer, the free space slowly goes down to zero and the system hangs. I've found out that these 2 programs cause this problem: xCode, Google Chrome (both programs are memory-consuming I believe), although I think the problem is related to OS itself.\nI've found similar questions but they all seem to be related to vanishing some of the disk space, where in my case I slowly loose all of the disk space.\nWhat I've tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using OmniSweeper to clean my disk\n\n*Disabling Mac OS X Paging/Swap as described here\n\n*Deleting sleep image\n\n\nRight now, the only solution for this problem is to reboot the system (then it has all these GBs back and I can work for few hours). When I close Google Chrome and wait for few minutes, the system frees some (no more than 600 MBs) of disk space.\nWhat can cause this problem? What software can I use to investigate it?\n\nA: First, if you want to free up some more space, I used xSlimmer.  It delocalizes AND gets rid of the \"Universal\" code that isn't used by Intel processors.  This makes all the Apps smaller.  Depending on the number of Apps you have installed you may only see another couple Gigs freed up.\nChrome is caching websites to your disk.  That's part of what it does to \"speed up\" page viewing.  Most people don't spend all day going to new websites.  They go to websites they are familiar with.  So Chrome (and other web browsers) cache to your hard drive.  Since material is pulled from the local disk, it \"speeds up\" the page view.\nQuite honestly, this is not a \"problem\" (per se).  This is expected behavior.  You need to either remove unused programs, remove (or compress) unnecessary data files, or increase the size of your HD.  There's really not another option.  Programs may use hard drive space for other functions (auto saving is an example).\nIt's actually not a great idea to turn off your swap.  Now there are some exceptions to this, I have 16 GB of RAM and didn't Swap once in 30 days.  I have years of experience and decided to shut off my Swap temporarily.  That was a month ago.  No problems yet.\nI'm not trying to sound condescending, you may know more about Swap files than I do (you may have invented them).  I'm just saying that usually this is not a good idea.  And if your system really only (yes, only) has 4GB of memory, you are going to cause yourself out of memory problems, or software crashes.  I know because my Mac Mini swaps all the time using 4GB.\n\nA: Download Grand Perspective.  It visually shows you where your files are.  Then you can manually delete them.  Look for your \"sleep\" image.  If thats larger than your current RAM its a major issue.\n\nA: A few other tips...\nTo keep your sleepimage from coming back, check out http://www.jinx.de/SmartSleep.html - a program that will help you control when or if a sleepimage is written.\nTo clear out 1-2 GB more space, you could delocalize your machine (remove all of your language) files by executing the below script in the terminal. Beware: this will remove all language files but English across your whole system. That said, I have used this script on hundreds of machines from 10.3 to 10.8 without problem.\nsudo find / \\( -name *.lproj -and \\! \\( -name English.lproj -or -name en.lproj -or -name en_US.lproj -or -name en-US.lproj -or -name empty.lproj \\) \\) -exec rm -rf \\{\\} \\;\n\n", "Q: Does Facetime on Mountain Lion allow you to share your screen?

I used the Up-to-Date program to update OSX to Mountain Lion.\nNow I'd like to create a recovery disk, but I can't use the same code to redeem installation package, and from the Apple Store it seems that I don't own a copy of Mountain Lion and that I should buy it to be able to download it. How to get the InstallESD.dmg file?\nOr how should I create a recovery disk without this file?\n\nA: Apple's Recovery Disk Assistant\n...enables you to create a recovery USB. While this recovery USB does not contain the installer image, it is able to install Mountain Lion (see 3rd paragraph).\nYou can download the official software from Apple here. Note that you can create the recovery USB only if you have a Recovery HD partition on your Mac. You can verify this in the Terminal using: diskutil list.\nThe Recovery Disk Assistant requires just 1GB because is does not store an OS X installer image (usually named InstallESD.dmg).

Just because it's not using OS X's methods doesn't mean that it doesn't work.  If you want to use \"OS X methods\" may I recommend Network Utility?\n\nThis may still call whois and just display it in the window.\n\nA: nslookup, host, and dig are perfectly good DNS query tools in OS X, but they all query DNS directly rather than going through OS X's internal resolution system. As a result, they don't check the /etc/hosts file, or resolve Bonjour/mDNS names (those ending in .local). The standard (quick 'n dirty) way to test resolution is to use ping, since it'll resolve the address you give it through the usual system before attempting to ping it. If you want something intended for the purpose, use dscacheutil instead:\n$ dscacheutil -q host -a name www.apple.com\nname: e3191.c.akamaiedge.net\nalias: www.apple.com www.isg-apple.com.akadns.net www.apple.com.edgekey.net \nip_address: 184.24.141.15\n\n$ ping www.apple.com\nPING e3191.c.akamaiedge.net (184.24.141.15): 56 data bytes\n64 bytes from 184.24.141.15: icmp_seq=0 ttl=57 time=57.258 ms\n^C\n--- e3191.c.akamaiedge.net ping statistics ---\n1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received, 0.0% packet loss\nround-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 57.258/57.258/57.258/0.000 ms\n\n", "Q: Logging out and in resets modifier keys to defaults \n*\n\n*Open Keyboard Preferences\n\n*Set modifier keys (I like to reverse option and command)\n\n*Log out\n\n*Log in\n\n*Modifier keys have been reset to defaults\n\n\nI just upgraded from 10.7.5 to 10.8.2, might be related.\nEvery time I open Keyboard Preferences, I see the following in my console:\n\nSystem Preferences[570]: [BluetoothHIDDevice][initWithHIDDevice] Unable to get Object ID from IORegistry\n\n.. so that might be related.\n\nA: *\n\n*Uninstalled Intellitype\n\n*Restarted in safe mode (hold shift)\n\n*Use Disk Utility to Repair Permissions\n\n*Restart\n\n\nSeems to have fixed the problem.

Would it be possible to stream audio to an apple TV using an ipad or an iphone? What abouta 2009 mbp? And which apps do I need?\n\nA: Yes, you can stream audio to a second or third generation Apple TV (the smaller black ones). The first generation ones (larger silver/white plastic box) doesn't support the necessary AirPlay protocol.\nOn iOS, the app playing the audio needs to be programmed with AirPlay support (the iOS Music app and Safari both support it), but if it is, you should see an AirPlay icon (). Tap it, and you should see a list of possible outputs, including your Apple TV. If you don't see the AirPlay icon, and your Apple TV is on, make sure they're both on the same local network.\nOn a Mac, iTunes can output to your Apple TV. You should see the AirPlay icon in the lower right corner. If you want to play audio from other apps, you'll need a third party program like Airfoil, which allows you to send any audio your Mac plays to the Apple TV (or any other AirPlay device).\nIf you have more questions, read Apple's support article, Using Airplay (HT4437).\n", "Q: Can arrow keys be added to an iPhone keyboard? Is there a way to add arrow keys to an iPhone keyboard under iOS 6?\n\nA: It might be possible on a jailbroken device, but not on with standard iOS. There are just no user configurable options for the keyboard, beyond adding additional languages. App developers can augment it slightly, and there are some apps with additional keys, such as Prompt and Textastic, but it's otherwise a standard system component that can't be changed.\n", "Q: Can Eudora be set to be the default mail client on OS X? I was using Eudora for email on my Mac.  I just activated the Apple Mail application and now I can no longer receive new messages in Eudora.  I can send, but not receive.  I get an error message alluding to password error.  I can read the new messages in Apple Mail, but prefer Eudora.  Can I uninstall Apple Mail?\n\nA: Yes.\nOpen up Mail.app, and visit the preferences (Menu Bar>Mail>Preferences).\nChange the default mail client in the drop-down menu under \"General\" to Eudora.\n\nIf you really wanted, you could just drag Mail.app from your Applications folder to the Trash at that point, but I would just leave it and ignore it.\n", "Q: How do I move GarageBand to a new Mac? I have a copy of GarageBand 4 (I think it's branded as \"iLife 08\" in the retail box) on an old Mac.  I bought a new Mac, and want to transfer the app to it.  (By my reading of the license, this is perfectly legal, as long as I don't continue to use it on the old computer.)\nI copied GarageBand.app over, and then it complained about missing \"Application Support\" and \"Apple Loops Index\".  I've started copying these files, but my network isn't the fastest (the set of Loops is pretty big).\nIs there an easier way to go about this?  Am I missing something here?\nI don't think the older Mac came with physical media for iLife -- only OS X.  I see some .pkg bundles in /Library/Recepits/ with \"GarageBand\" in the name -- is there an automatic way to copy or repackage these?\n\nA: If iLife came pre-installed on your computer back in 2008, your computer came with one or two install discs. If there were two, iLife installers exist on the second disc.\nYou didn't specify what kind of computer your old or new computers are, but if they both have FireWire ports, you could use Target Disk Mode and a FireWire cable to transfer files faster than via your slow network.\nA third method to transfer GarageBand (and other applications) from your old computer to your new would be to use the Migration Assistant application. You can't select individual applications to copy, but you can fairly seamlessly transfer applications from one computer to another, then delete what you don't want.\nWithout knowing any specifics about hardware or OS version, it's difficult to give you better advice, but your three best bets to more seamlessly copy the application are 1) the install disc, 2) copy the files using Target Disk Mode, or 3) use Migration Assistant.\n\nA: If your Mac has a Firewire port, @Daniel's Target Disk method will work. However, if you don't want to have to shut down one of the computers, you can actually set up a Firewire network. Just connect both computers with a Firewire cable, and go to System Preferences > Network, then check to see that Firewire is the top service. If it isn't, but it has a green dot, just click the gear icon at the bottom, and select Set Service Order. Then drag Firewire to the top.\nNow you can copy files across using Firewire speeds, without shutting down either computer.\n\nA: I wanted to know how to do this as well. While my circumstances may well be different, I succeeded in copying over GarageBand from one Mac to another.  While both ran Mac OS 10.13.6 and had Garageband installed. One computer had version 5.0, or something close to that, which would not start up and gave an error message of some kind. The other computer had Garageband 6.05. I linked the two machines with cable and transferred the app from one machine to the other... drag and drop ... this worked ... I deleted the older version ... it works ... Thought I'd share that in case it helps.\n", "Q: Can't sync music from iPhone to computer Every time I try to sync music from my iPhone to my computer it says that it has synced with a different iTunes library before. However, I've never synced it to a different one.\n I once synced it anyway and I lost all my music and had to redo my whole iPhone-music, so I would like to avoid this.  But now it's complaining about the same thing.\nHow can I fix this permanently? \n\nA: By design, the iPhone will sync iTunes content with one computer at a time. Any attempt to sync such content with a second computer will result in ALL iTunes content being first erased from your phone & then replaced with the content from the second computer. This is a design feature and cannot be overridden. Because you replaced your computer, or hard drive, your phone will see this as a \"new\" computer. The iTunes content sync is one way: computer to phone. If you have photos that were synced to your phone or music ripped on your own that were not backed up, you will first have to extract them from your phone using third party software such as Touch Copy, before you do anything else, as Apple makes no provision to do so. Try this\nPast iTunes, App store, & iBookstore content can be re-downloaded. Read here:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT2519\nOnce you've done that, do the following in the order specified:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable auto sync when an iPod/iPhone is connected under iTunes>Preferences>Devices(under Edit menu if using Windows).\n\n*Make sure you have one contact & one event in the supported applications on your computer(iCal & Address Book on a Mac, Windows Address Book or Outlook if using Windows). These entries can be fake, doesn't matter, the important point is that these programs not be empty.\n\n*Connect your phone, iTunes running, do not sync at this point.\n\n*Store>Authorize this computer.\n\n*File>Transfer Purchases(To make sure all purchased content on your phone will be in your iTunes library).\n\n*Right click your phone in the left device pane & select \"Reset warnings\".\n\n*Right click again and select \"Backup\".\n\n*Right click again & select \"Restore from Backup\", select the backup you just made. When prompted to create another backup, decline.\n\n*This MUST be followed by a sync to restore your iTunes content, which you select from the various tabs, You'll get a popup regarding your contacts & calendars asking to merge or replace, select \"Merge\".\nYour phone should look just like it did when you started, with no data loss.\nYou should be good to go.\n\nA: I've had this issue before.\nFor me I've updated to iTunes match and since my music is now in the cloud it just syncs with the cloud instead of iTunes. \nAlternatively could also try updating iTunes to the latest version and updating your iPhone to the latest iOS and resync once more.\nIf it doesn't work you could then make a backup of your iPhone, restore factory settings, restore the backup just made and resync your music.\n\nA: Also, make sure to manually invoke transfer of all purchases from your iPhone to your iTunes library as per:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT1848\nIt is possible that your iTunes library then recognizes it is already in sync with your iPhone. \n\nA: It's easy, try Coolmuster iPhone to PC transfer, we can use it to move iPhone music to PC in 2 simple steps, and you can also use it to move other things from iPhone to computer.\n", "Q: What does the secure keyboard entry menu item in Terminal app do? What does this option in Terminal do?\n\nIt seems to have no effect on anything.\n\nA: Essentially, this option prevents other applications (including things like TextExpander) from \"listening in\" on what you are typing. By preventing other background processes from recording or accessing your keystrokes, you are ensuring they cannot be logged or monitored, eg. by a simple keylogger, or another program running with normal permissions for potentially malicious purposes.\n\nA: Here is a screenshot from the help menu.\n\n\nA: There's a great answer about it on the Security Stackexchange\n\n\"Secure Keyboard Entry\" maps to the EnableSecureEventInput function whose concept is described here. Basically, applications don't access the hardware themselves; they obtain events (e.g. about key strokes) from the operating system. Some elements in the OS decides what application gets what events, depending on its access rights and GUI state (there are details depending on which application is \"in the foreground\").\n...\n\n", "Q: Service which monitors when apps are updated? I have a couple of old applications which I adore, but really don't want to have on my iPhone at the moment, because they're terrible in iOS6 / iPhone 5 and haven't been updated  for over a year.  I'd like to get rid of it so it's not taking up space,  but would like to monitor its updates still.\nDoes such a service exist which 'monitors', or tracks the version of an application, and will let me know when it's updated?  This way, I could delete the app, wait for it to be updated, and re-install it again.\niTunes can kind of do this, in the sense that even if it's not installed on my iPhone it'll still let me know an update has been released.  I don't use iTunes, pretty much at all, so I don't want to use it that way.\nMichael\n\nA: I haven't heard of a service with the exact function. However lame this could sound, you could check out the app producer's website/fb/yt and sign-up for news or email newsletters which would inform you when these apps are updated. \nChances are slim, however, if the apps haven't been updated for more than a year.\n", "Q: What is the easiest way to find and delete duplicate songs in iTunes? \nPossible Duplicate:\nRemove all duplicates on iTunes library \n\nA few days ago, I synced all of songs from my iPhone 4s to iTunes. After it finished, I found that some of them have duplicates. I thought maybe I transferred them to iTunes before. Now I want to find and delete them from my iTunes library. What is the easiest way to delete the duplicates? \nThank you very much in advance.\n\nA: There is a menu item for this directly in iTunes:\n\nYou may find additional utilities at Doug's AppleScripts for iTunes.\n", "Q: Reinstall Mac OS X Mountain Lion before selling a Mac I want to sell my laptop (Macbook Pro late 2011).\nI have erased my disk drive but it seems that I cannot reinstall Mac OS without an Apple ID.\nAt the origin my mac was shipped with Lion, I have upgraded to Mountain Lion and now my recovery partition contain the installer for Mountain Lion. When I try to reinstall Mac, it asks for my apple ID. Since I want to sell it, I don't want to put any of my information in it.\nHow do you do that?\n\nA: If you happen to already have an installable copy of Lion or Mountain Lion,\n\n\n*\n\n*back up your personal data\n\n*make a bootable thumb drive to install from\n\n*boot from the thumb drive\n\n*select Disk Utility\n\n*repartition and reformat your drive\n\n*there should be an arrow to skip the Apple ID entry and continue the install.\n\n\nEither of the two ways should get you a virgin install.\nThe other way is to do a recovery boot by holding down COMMAND-R when powering on before your Mac chimes. It will be slow since all files load from Apple's servers. Follow the six steps above for a clean install.\n\nA: I installed Mountain Lion on my early 2009 17\" MacBook Pro via a bootable thumb drive I made. \nDownload and run Lion Diskmaker from http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/39701/lion-diskmaker. This tool allows you to create a bootable thumb drive from the Mountain Lion installer. It will search your system to see if you still have the install file on hand.\nIf you don't still have the ML install file, check the Purchases page in the App Store. If it show Mountain Lion with a DOWNLOAD button, click the button to  download Mountain Lion from the App Store but do not install it. If the app starts automatically, quit it.\nRun Lion Diskmaker again and let it walk you through the process.\nWhen you have the bootable thumb drive, make sure you have all your personal data backed up on an external drive before you use Disk Utility to repartition and reformat your laptop's hard drive and reinstall ML!\nGood luck and happy selling!\n\nA: If you consider that the license for Mountain Lion doesn't look to be transferrable to the new owner (as most are probably not clear legally to transfer/sell/give away an App Store license for Mountain Lion) then other options might make more sense than just installing Mountain Lion. \nWhy not reinstall Lion which is tied directly to the hardware.  You need no Apple ID to use Internet Recovery or the Lion recovery disk assistant. You could optionally offer to assist the buyer in upgrading to Mountain Lion and also ensure they understand iLife might not be included with this sale.\nYou could gift some or all of the apps to their Apple ID, give a physical gift card to cover the expected cost of the software or renegotiate the sale price of the Mac. \nWe have a discussion of more options on this thread:\n\n\n*\n\n*Where can I get a copy of Mountain Lion that I can resell with my Apple hardware?\nApple documents the reinstall and erase options at:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904\n", "Q: How do I use web sharing in mac to allow access to files from machines outside of my local network? I want my web-service to be accessible from out side of my local network.\nI am using MAMP and I have also started web-sharing on my local machine, but it is working only locally.\nI want any file to be accessible from another machine which is not in network.\n\nA: You'll have to try a dynamic DNS service (like DynDNS, http://dyn.com/dns/) to detect your machine's external (probably dynamic) IP address and keep it mapped to a specific DNS name. \nThe other option would be to get a shared hosting account and push your content up to a remote web server. I use A2hosting for that, but there are hundreds of similar hosting services. \n\nA: If the machines are on separate networks then you need to connect to the machine serving the files by it's external IP address. With this you should be able to connect to it using Finder by clicking Connect to Server... from the Go menu. If it is a Mac serving the files use:\nafp://<IP-address>\n\nand it should prompt you for a username and password.\nAlternatively if it's just file access you desire and are not set on using a GUI, I recommend SSH and SCP: two command line tools.\nSSH (Secure Shell) allows you to login to a remote machine and execute commands as if you were using a shell on that machine.\nSCP (Secure Copy) allows you to securely transfer files between *NIX based machines using SSH protocols.\nFor information on how to use these, open a terminal and type either man ssh or man scp.\n", "Q: How can I find and edit my external hard-drive's .fseventsd folder? While changing my 'file directory' preferences on Vuze, I accidentally created a folder in the .fseventsd-folder on my Seagate external hard-drive.\nI can't even find the .fseventsd-folder using search Spotlight, in fact the only way I can see this folder is when I go back to the file directory preferences from Vuze and I can't edit anything from there.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this going to damage anything, delete my data or anything weird like that?\n\n*Is there any way of deleting this folder (the accidentally created folder not the .fseventsd-folder)?  \n\n\nA: Files and folders starting with a '.' are invisible in Finder by default. You have to activate this option in order to view/delete them.  \nOpen Terminal and typ defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool true, after that, restart your Finder.\nTo hide those files again, open Terminal and type defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool false and restart Finder again. \nBut remember, they are hidden for a reason, so don't mess around with this kind of folders unless you are absolutely certain of your actions...\n\nA: If you're comfortable with a terminal then navigate to your external disk (usually lives in the /Volumes/ directory:\ncd /Volumes/<Name-of-disk>/path/to/.fseventsd-folder\n\nIf you're not sure where this is you can find it by navigating to /Volumes/<Name-of-disk> and executing:\nfind . -name .fseventsd-folder\n\n\nOnce you are inside the directory, list the files in that directory (the -a lists hidden files—the ones that start with a .):\nls -a\n\nLocate the name of the folder you accidentally created from the output of the above command and then use the following command:\nrm -r -i <name-of-folder>\n\n(The -i is optional but it will ask you to confirm the action if you're a little nervous.\n\nThen exit the terminal using:\nexit\n\n\nA: If you don't want to show hidden files in Finder (files/folders starting with a \".\"), then another way how to gain access to a hidden folder is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a Finder window\n\n*Press Cmd+Shift+G\n\n*In the input dialog, type out the folder you want to get to.\nE.g. /Volumes/250GB HDD/.fseventsd...\n\n\nNote: You can use the Tab key to auto-complete.

Or does the battery suffers from this kind of use?\n\nA: Well, Apple does not recommend leaving your portable plugged in all the time, as for a lithium-based battery, it's important to keep the electrons in it moving occasionally. MacBook / Pro, though, are designed to deliver up to 1000 full charge and discharge cycles before it reaches 80% of its original capacity. \nA charge cycle means using all of the battery’s power, but that doesn’t necessarily mean a single charge. For instance, you could listen to your iPod for a few hours one day, using half its power, and then recharge it fully. If you did the same thing the next day, it would count as one charge cycle, not two, so you may take several days to complete a cycle. Each time you complete a charge cycle, it diminishes battery capacity slightly.\nSince 2009-2010 laptops carry a technology called Adaptive Charging which basically is a chip within the battery that talks to its cells monitoring everything from charge level to temperature. The chip relays this information to the computer, which uses an advanced algorithm to determine the optimal charging current. Adaptive Charging reduces the wear and tear on the battery giving it a lifespan of up to 5 years.\nSo, I'll actually won't worry that much about the battery. Just try not to keep it plugged all the time, and remember to do a full charge cycle at least once per month.\n", "Q: Is there a limit for the attachment size in Messages? I'm trying to send a 36 MB .mp4 video via Messages, but I'm not exactly sure if it's working.\nAfter sending the file, the CPU usage of the processes VTDecoderXPCService and IMTranscoderAgent goes up very high (~300%) and then only about 11 MB of data are send.\nI doubt that Messages is performing some magical compression that results in <30% of the original video file size for the transfer, instead I assume that the whole file is not send. But I'm not receiving a warning such as: \"Could not transfer file. Attachment too large...\"\nIs there a limit for the attachment size in Messages?\n\nA: Despite Joost's links, Apple did officially provide a size limit for Messages attachments.\nExtracted from Mountain Lion's Features page:\n\nSend large attachments: Send high-quality photos, full HD video, or documents. iMessage allows attachments of up to 100MB.\n\nYour 36MB file is, indeed, off the limit. \n\nA: It seems Apple has not documented this properly. Some articles show that 220MB is over the limit and that it's most likely between 101.4MB and 194MB\nIn either case, your 36MB file should not be hitting any limits. That means there must be something else going on.\n", "Q: How to cleanup HDD after installing a new OS X version using TimeMachine? A very nice feature of TimeMachine is the possibility to configure a new Mac automatically. Nevertheless, when you switch from OS 10.6 to OS 10.8 using TimeMachine during installation, there are a lot of files that are not needed anymore in 10.8. Unfortunately, the setup does not recognize this and I have to remove them manually. Is there a possibility to remove all system files that are only needed for < 10.8 automatically?\n\nA: I'm pretty sure there is no such thing. But you do have a couple of options.\n\n\n*\n\n*Get another totally clean installation of 10.8 and diff your whole filesystem. Then decide upon each \"extra\" file if it needed by you or your applications.\n\n*The \"easy\" option. Do a clean 10.8 installation and then restore from time machine into a folder on your desktop (f.ex.). Then manually copy over the files and stuff you want to keep\n\n\nA: Time Machine used to have a built-in option to disable backing up all \"System Files\" so I would use that to make one last backup so that when you restore, the system won't be inclined to migrate any of those system files over.\nIf you no longer have the original Mac to make a new smaller backup, you may not even need this since that setting was removed on Mountain Lion.\nI have not seen any need for this sort of cleaning in practice, but it can't hurt things. Are you seeing space issues or thousands of files being migrated? This is an area where I've felt OS X does quite well in not restoring un-needed content so it's not something most people do to clean their Macs at this point.\n", "Q: Newsstand magazine downloads very slow and halting My newsstand has two subscriptions: New Yorker and Economist.   \n\n\n*\n\n*When a new issue is available for either one of those, the period required to download the issue is super slow, and unreliable - it will seem to spin along well, showing the download numbers increase, but then simply halt.

I prefer to keep the dock \"auto-hiding\" setting on so that the dock is always hidden unless I mouse over it. I am aware of both the setting in \"dock preferences\" and the keyboard shortcut (⌥⌘D).\nHowever, it seems that this setting will turn itself off, leaving the dock showing. It's usually when an application on another Space/Desktop steals the focus. It's easy enough to then use the keyboard shortcut to turn auto-hiding back on. But, it happens frequently enough that it's getting old.\nIt's not always the same app stealing the focus that causes this to happen. I'm not even sure if that's always what triggers it, but it usually seems to involve window focus and another Mission Control space.\nI'm just wondering if anybody has encountered this and found a fix or the real root cause? Maybe some kind of defaults.write hack as a workaround?\n\nA: interestingly, the answer at https://superuser.com/a/454391/196087 solves the problem:\nin short, perform killall -KILL Dock and the dock will re-start, without the problem.\n", "Q: How does Messages work between my Mac and my iPhone? I thought with Mountain Lion that Messages are shown on both my Mac and iPhone (so I can start a chat on my iPhone and continue it on my Mac).\nWhat is weird is that I seem to get an arbitrary set of messages on my Mac but it's definitely not fully in sync with the iPhone. A number of iPhone messages never show up on the Mac at all, or 1/2 of the conversation shows up.\nDo I need to set something up specifically to make this work or is this as expected?\n\nA: I think the source of your confusion is the difference between traditional text messages (SMS) and iMessages (Apple's own protocol).\nMessages on the Mac doesn't support SMS. Any message you send or receive on your iPhone as SMS won't show up in Messages on the Mac.\nIf you send a message as an iMessage, though, then it'll show up on the Mac. Now here's where it gets confusing: even though iMessages are \"data\" and not \"text,\" they can be sent between phone numbers.

Any one know how to block all network traffic with the Network Link Conditioner on Mountain Lion? Here's the custom offline profile I made that's not working. I'm trying to block the network for the iPhone Simulator. Thanks.\n\n\nA: Assuming you really want the answer how to block traffic rather than using the tool you have at hand, I'll suggest you use Little Snitch.\nIt is a firewall that works on interrupting the flow of data out from apps to the internet.\nPerhaps someone will know how to bend the Network Link Conditioner to work as a firewall for the one app, but I'd start with one of the tools for that job if no one has a good recipe for the latter.\n", "Q: How can I easily specify an or-search in Finder? I wanted to create a smart-search for my R-files, including both files ending in \".r\" and \".rmd\". Obviously, files can't end in both.\nThis yields only files that satisfy both criteria\n\nThis yields no files because the criteria are mutually exclusive.\n\nHow can I search for files ending in either .r or .rmd and more generally\nhow can I specify \"or\"-searches/ disjunctions? Using \"or\" or \"||\" didn't do the trick.\n\nA: Operands must be written in capitals, so they are understood as such. Therefore, using OR instead of or, will do exactly what you want.\n", "Q: Seems like my trackpad is never sleeping/shutting off I'm experiencing some funny behavior with my Retina MacBook Pro and my Magic Trackpad. There are two symptoms that I believe could be related: \n\n\n*\n\n*The batteries on my trackpad drain far more quickly than the ones in my Apple wireless keyboard. The last time the trackpad warned me about low batteries, I put fresh batteries in both the keyboard and the trackpad. As of today, the keyboard is still at 100% and the trackpad is down to 14%. \n\n*My computer seems to be waking up periodically when I am away from my desk. I keep the MBP in clamshell mode on my desk at work with two Thunderbolt Displays connected. I put the computer to sleep when I leave the office via the Apple menu, but I frequently return to my desk in the morning to find messages in Adium from people for whom I appeared to be online.\n\n\nMy hypothesis is that the trackpad is not going to sleep or shutting itself off properly, and that is both draining its battery and causing my computer to wake up periodically.\nIs this plausible? If so, what lullaby do I sing to my trackpad? \n\nA: I've had to track this down and have found that keeping a log has helped me identify which trackpads are going through batteries faster than the others.\nOnce a week, I'm recording what the OS thinks is the battery level. I've been able to catch bad rechargeable cells as well as one faulty trackpad (among lots) that seemed to be less power efficient. Showing the log to the genius bar was all they needed to offer a swap. \nIf you don't have a lot of devices - it might be something you just throw good alkaline batteries at until you have a feeling if it's normal. I would go into the genius bar with the Mac and the trackpad to establish the idea you'll be testing it and ask if they have any insight.\nUnless you have something capacative on the surface (or very near the surface), it shouldn't matter if your Mac is awake or asleep as the trackpad itself will go to sleep. You can also disable sleep / PowerNap and such once you are sure of the normal weekly drain on a battery and see if it makes any difference.\nAs to catching the culprit for wake issues - open the terminal and type pmset -g log to dump the history of sleeps, wakes and much more. The manual page for pmset will help if you need more detailed logs than that, but hopefully you can catch whatever event is causing the OS to wake up.\n", "Q: Force constant refreshing of WINE window I'm trying to run Imperialism 2 on Crossover (WINE), in virtual desktop mode. The game nearly works except that the screen doesn't update.\nWhat I mean by this is that the WINE window is initially black. If I then drag another window on top of it, and drag it away again, the window now displays a picture of the game at this point. If I then click on things within the game, nothing happens visually, until I again drag another window on top of the WINE one.\nSo what seems to be happening is that the WINE window doesn't realise it needs to keep on updating what it's showing. Only when its contents are obscured and then revealed again does it notice that it has to redraw. This is fairly frustrating: the game is running fine, the graphics are being drawn correctly, but they're just not being displayed.\nIs there any way to keep on sending a \"redraw message\" to a window to force these redraws to happen? Imp 2 is a turn-based game, so if the redraws happened only a few times a second, that would be fine.\n\nA: I've found a completely horrendous but workable way of fixing my problem. First, download and install Afloat, which lets you set windows as global translucent non-clickable overlays.\nThen, create a HTML file whose background switches between pure white and almost pure white 20 times a second. Something like this:\n<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd\">\n<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n  <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\" />\n    <title>Strobe Light</title>\n    <script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\">\n      <!--\n      var c = 0;\n\n      function strobe() {\n        document.bgColor = c ? '#fefefe' : '#ffffff';\n        c = (c + 1) % 2;\n      }\n\n      function startStrobe() {\n        setInterval(strobe, 50);\n      }\n      -->\n    </script>\n  </head>\n  <body onload=\"startStrobe();\">\n  </body>\n</html>\n\nFinally, open this file in Safari, resize the window to fill the screen as much as possible, and use Afloat to set the window as a global near-transparent non-clickable overlay. The result? The whole screen (including the WINE window) is forced to update every 50 ms.\nIs this completely horrible? Yes. But it works.\n", "Q: Is there an LDAP Server running on OS X Snow Leopard? Is there an LDAP Server running on my OS X Snow Leopard deployment?  How do I find it?

I have iPad 2 and writing has become totally bad with it now. Something is hooking up the resources or it is getting old after 3 months. How can I make it faster?\n\nA: Back up your iPad, then power it off.\nStart the device and run only the problematic writing app. Get benchmarks or some other definite measurement so you can then try things and know if it helps.\nYou might also try the above while the device is in airplane mode to ensure no background sync or network issue is affecting the performance of the device and app.\nThe most common fix is to restore the device to factory settings and repeat the one app only. If that app works, then you'll need to restore the backup and work out what is causing the issue.\nIf that app doesn't work, then you can blame that build of that app and run an older one (again looking to get it from a backup) or find a different app.\nThe troubleshooting process is the same for most any problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*protect your data with a backup\n\n*measure\n\n*change something and re-measure\n\n*continue until you have isolated the problem\n\n", "Q: Mountain Lion - Finder - Search by file name I just upgraded from Snow Leopard to Mountain Lion and I seem to be missing one bit of functionality that I used all the time in Finder.

I'm on the road and have the need to update my CV which is a Microsoft Word document. My CV is accessible via WebDav but I've also got it stored on the iPad using the Synology DS File app.\nWhat is the best way to edit my CV using the iPad? Is there a native or web based app that can do this for me? I would expect that the formatting and tables in the document to be preserved when it is saved.\n\nA: Pages will indeed give you the native app and nice interface, but for true Microsoft Word editing, you have to try CloudOn! \nAfter creating an account in the app on your iPad, you will be given choices to use your dropbox to reach the documents you wish to edit. Another option is to transfer it to the app via iTunes. When editing, you will be using the full version of Microsoft Word on your iPad. No catch. Simply the full version like you know it from your Windows PC desktop. It is amazing! \nIt takes a while to get used to running it properly on the iPad, but it's worth it when all your CV formatting is intact and editable.\n\nA: Times have changed since this question was asked. CloudOn has been bought and shut down by DropBox.\nCurrently, the best way to edit Word documents on iOS is with the Microsoft Word app.\n\nA: I use Pages to edit Microsoft Word documents on my iPad.\nI believe it is $10 via the AppStore. \nPages allows you to open, edit and save back to .DOC, PDF or Pages' native format.\nGood luck with the opportunity to present your CV.\n\nA: I use OnLive Desktop, but in order to access the internet you have to use the 5 dollar premium version. This is the best substitute for writting essays and such using your ipad with the full Microsoft Word program. I have tried CloudOn and I really found it to be difficult because i had to use the monitor keyboard. I also tried Pages but i didn't like not having the look that Microsoft Word offers. So If you want the look and feel of using Microsoft Word you have to give OnLive Desktop a try. I don't mind dishing out 5 bucks a month for it; that is until Office 365 decides to offer Word as some-sort of app! \n\nA: Microsoft's online editor is available at office.com.\nYou can open Word Online directly from office.live.com/start/Word.aspx.\n\nCollaborate for free with an online version of Microsoft Word. Save documents in OneDrive. Share them with others and work together at the same time.\n\n\nA: Have you tried Google Drive?

I live in a wide house, so I have an Airport extreme, an Airport express and a TimeCapsule setting up a free roaming network.\nI used to have the Airport Express working as a master central router for the rest of the network.\nAirplay was a little buggy and wifi gaming is not the best option out in the market.\nBut now I changed my ISP, and it provided me (free of charge) with a ZTE ZXDSL 9311WII routed modem, with 4 ethernet ports, so I decided to boost the performance of my network. Bought over 300ft of LAN cable, a bunch of cable connectors, crimping tools and even wall connectors...\nSo I wired every AirPort directly to the ZTE, and now I have all airports in bridge mode.\nThe problem that emerged is that a computer connected to one airport can not see anymore the computer in another airport. This happens if the computer is connected via wifi also, he can only see the ones connected to the same airport. Also, airport admin utility lost the capability of seeing all the airports connected and turned on - and now can only see only the one that the computer is directly connected to.\nHow do I solve this visibility issue?\nI am SURE ZTE is not blocking connections because if I plug in computers directly to ZTE, they can see each other just as they should.\nI already went trough all airport possible configurations, googled for the whole day, and found nothing about this configuration being possible or not.\n\nA: The first thing I would suggest is to get an ethernet switch and place it between the ZTE router and the rest of the network.  Route all the Airport devices into the switch.  Then they should all see each other.  These cost $18-$25.  \nI have two Airport Extreme Base Stations, at opposite ends of my house.  I set the one connected to a DSL modem to be the DHCP server, and create Airport wireless networks.  I select the channels manually, not automatic.  \nThe second base station is connected to the first by ethernet cable - not wirelessly.  It is set to bridge mode, but also to create wireless networks.  I give the networks the same, identical names, but manually select different channels than the first base station.  \nThis lets any WiFi device to connect to either server without any conflicts that I have noticed.  \nYou may wish to turn off the DHCP server on the ZTE router and use one of the Airport base stations to provide that service for your network.\n\nA: Apple's free roaming network with their AirPort and Time Capsule routers works great... as long as you're using one of their devices as the master DHCP server and link to the DSL modem.\nOnce you switch from \"Extend a network\" into \"Bridge\" mode, you lose all ability to free roam.\nAt both my parent's home and my office I have the DLS modem (the ZTE ZXDSL in your case), a switch (can be built into the modem) and various AirPorts and/or Time Capsules.\nTurn off all the Apple routers except one and start with that one. Configure it to be the main link and the DHCP server. Make sure it talks to the internet and does everything you want.\nNext, configure the next Apple wireless router. Sometimes you need to reset them back to baseline configuration and then begin from there. As it comes up, use the wizard to select \"Extend a network\" and follow the prompts to input the info for your network. Make sure everything works to connect to the internet with both Apple routers.\nRepeat the procedure with the third.\nHaving the AirPorts hard-wired together provides the best infrastructure between the access points.\nEnjoy your free roaming.\n", "Q: How can I diagnose intermittent network failures from my MacBook? I've been having a persistent problem where my 2011 MacBook Air abruptly loses its network connection for 30-60 seconds before regaining it without action on my part.\nThis doesn't seem to be a problem with my internet connection, as the MacBook loses both internet and its AFP connection to my NAS (the NAS is wired to my router via a wired switch, while the MacBook connects to the router via WiFi).\nThe issue occurs seemingly at random, but yesterday I was downloading files from the Internet to my MacBook and then transferring them to the NAS. Twice in a row when I tried to both download files and transfer other files simultaneously, I experienced this connection drop.\nMy hope is that the problem exists at my D-Link router, but I fear it might be a problem with the MacBook Air. How can I determine which device is at fault?\n\nA: Firstly, do you have problems anywhere else, or just trying to connect to your NAS via your D-Link? \nConsistent problems most other places could point to your Mac. Problems only with your equipment, issue is probably closer to home.\nI posted an answer to a similar issue on a 2012 MacBook Air. Nutshell version: Apple has implemented Intel's newer power saving techniques which puts various parts of the computer to sleep a lot sooner and more often than older wifi routers will keep alive. I don't have hands-on experience with this issue and the 2011 MacBook Air.\nFirst question I would ask: How old is your D-Link router? More than a year and it's probably my first target. Log into the router and see if you can find a place to increase the amount of time before a \"connection timeout\" occurs.\nIf you cannot find a place to extend timeout values, you might be better off looking to replace the router, especially if you have a computer store with liberal return policy. A safe test to see if it is indeed the router or your laptop is to pick up an AirPort Express (about $100, one WAN, one ethernet, one USB printer) or an AirPort Extreme (about $200, one WAN, three ethernet, one USB for printer or TimeMachine hard drive). Configuration with the AirPort Utility is straightforward.\nHook your NAS up to the ethernet port on the AirPort and start transferring files to and from it with your MacBook Air. If the problems disappear, you can either keep the AirPort or return it and purchase a newer wifi router from another company. I'm sure most newer routers support Intel's deep power saving modes, I just haven't used them.\nIf you still have problems keeping a connection even with an AirPort, then it's probably your Mac.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Check this link . Basically, there's a folder that's difficult to access - CoreServices. From the desktop, hold Apple-Shift-G and go to /System/Library/CoreServices.\nThere's a utility called Wi-Fi Diagnostics that's a little beefier than the default one. You can ask it to watch your connection and send a report of what's going on. I just found it the other day so perhaps it will work if you can get the problem to happen while the app is monitoring. I haven't had to use it, so that's all I can offer. It will even let you view your signal strength as you move your computer/modem.\nEveryone warns you to be careful in CoreServices, I suppose it's hidden for a reason. Good luck!\n", "Q: Migrating solid state drive to new machine I had a solid state drive running Snow Leopard in a 15' Macbook Pro, unfortunately I fried the logic board and got a new computer. I'd like to use the SSD in the new computer (which is set up to run 10.8).\nIs this possible? What is the best way to get my old solid state drive running in the new Macbook?\n[edit]: I tried booting the new machine with the old SSD and it refused to book, playing three beeps over and over.\n\nA: Assuming the drive fits, you should be able to insert the drive in the new Mac and see if the OS is capable of booting. I would make a good backup of the contents of the drive before starting if you can.\nIf you wanted to be safe, you could use Internet Recovery to install the OS on op of the drive or even wipe it clean and migrate things at a later date. \nThe drive will either physically fit and be a SATA device or not. The data part of things will be driven by your backup situation and comfort with spending time testing the OS or running a new install to ensure the drivers and OS are proper for the new hardware.\nThe symptom of three beeps means that the machine has not even completed the POST where RAM is checked, so you will want to first resolve whatever hardware issue is preventing the machine from completing the power on self test (POST).\n", "Q: App behavior with spaces and minimized window I would like to change the behavior when I click on an app that's not open on the current space. Right now, it goes to whichever space has that app. Instead, I'd like it to favor the current space, including minimized windows.\nexample: I have two open Chrome windows. One is minimized on space 1, and the second is open on space 2. The currently active space is 1.\nWhat happens by default: I click the Chrome icon in the dock, and I am switched to space 2 to the open Chrome window there.\nWhat I want to happen: The minimized window on space 1 is restored and made active. \nWhat doesn't work: disabling switching spaces to an app to make it active. If I don't have a minimized window on the current space, then I do want it to switch spaces.\nI tried this, it still doesn't restore the minimized windows. It just makes the app active on the current space. Then when I click the app again, it switches spaces, instead of restoring the minimized window. It only seems to restore the window when all the windows are minimized. How frustrating.\nBasically I just want to swap the priorities of the two actions: unminimize and switch spaces.\nAnyone know how to do this?\n\nA: I am not sure that this is possible, however you could use ctrl+click on the dock icon or long click anbd use the sub menu system to show windows / switch to windows.\n\nA: I think this feature should be requested from Apple as it currently isn't possible.\nIt does makes much more sense, as the minimized windows are 'nowhere', so they shouldn't be attached to any desktop.\n\nA: I don't think its possible from apple.\n\nA: No, there is not an option to change this behaviour currently.\nHowever, under Mission Control in your System pref you can disable \"When switching to an application, switch to a Space with open windows for the application\".\nThis does two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*As intended: It doesn't jump to (using your example) the active window in space 2, giving you a chance to click on the minimized window in the taskbar.\n\n*As a hidden feature: If you click the icon a second time it sends you to the active window on space 2 (just like it does when the setting is enabled).\n\n", "Q: How do I change the default font size for reading in Mail 6.0?

I've plugged in my Macbook Air to the power and have already forced time machine to backup. However, the folder is still 32GB even after restarting...Did Time Machine properly back up the 32GB so I can delete it?\n\nA: It has been my experience (with a non-full SSD in a MBA running 10.8.2) that the /.MobileBackups directory always holds hourly backups from the last day and daily backups from the previous seven days. These are kept locally (even after making a Time Machine backup to an external disk) so that you can still use Time Machine to restore recently changed files even when your external Time Machine disk is not available.\nAccordingly, it makes sense that your /.MobileBackups would be large if you have made correspondingly large changes in the past week (i.e. deleted or changed big chunks of data).\nI have not yet filled my disk, so I am not sure how it works in that situation. Ideally, it would “give back” some of the space /.MobileBackups earlier than normal instead of letting you completely fill up your disk.\n\nIf you are not critically short on “disk” space, you can probably just wait a week or so (while doing daily backups to an external Time Machine disk) and /.MobileBackups should automatically shrink as the locally stored data ages (assuming you are not still making “large changes”).\nIf you need the space (and Time Machine is not automatically giving it back as the disk gets full), or you need to constantly make “large changes”, then you can try this command (in a Terminal window):\nsudo tmutil disablelocal\n\nI have never run this command; the manpage has this description for disablelocal:\n\nTurn off local Time Machine snapshots and trigger automatic\n               cleanup of accumulated local snapshot data.\n\n", "Q: How to regain warnings about permanent version storage?

Usable or too slow? I haven't used OS X since an awful experience with its commandline tools and CD Xcode about 2009, that time getting rid of all Apple stuff but coming back after iPhone/iPad/FaceTime/iCloud/etc. Now I am wondering whether I could solve this problem other way, I love to use tools such as awk, mogrify, imagemagick, etc -- they are pretty integral part of me because I don't like to relearn things.

I've done a bit of researching and can't seem to nail the answers to my questions. Your answers on any of the items below would be much appreciated. And if you think there's a better way I should be asking the question, please let me know. \nHere's what I'm looking for especially:\n\n\n*\n   \n*I use Gmail's labels a lot. How can I get the same\n    effect in Mail? Smart folders? (I do wish smart folders synced to\n    iCloud.) Note: I am not asking about replicating + maintaining Gmail labels in Mail — I don't need to replicate + maintain: I'm leaving Gmail. I just need a system with a similar functionality. Something I could use on both my Mac and my iPad would be ideal.\n   \n*I have a lot of Gmail labels. What's a good way to export\n    from Gmail without getting oodles of duplicates? Forwarding folder\n    by folder would be time consuming + lossy, and stripping the labels\n    would be counterproductive. Are those my only real options? Note: Yes, I know this question does get attention, but a lot of the attention is quite old. Both Gmail and OSX have changed a lot over the last few years. I'd love a good recent resource, based on Lion + Mt Lion.\n    \n*I use a lot\n    of Gmail filters. Mail rules seem even better, but is there any way\n    to automate transferring my filters to Mail?\n  \n*I use Gmail 'send mail\n    as' with a collection of non-gmail addresses (from my domains).

Probably Apple is not using standard IMAP for its iCloud e-mail service.\nThat said, you could upgrade your GMail account to a premium account to get better quality of service (and perhaps not having them selling off your e-mails).\n\nA: I think it's safer to just stay with Google Mail.\nThe Google Drive Integration is amazing and lets you share files seamlessly across devices just like DropBox.\nNow they are giving away 15GB space for your email (from Google IO 2013)\n", "Q: Using 2 displays with full screen applications I often use dual heads on my MBP, and I was wondering if there was a way to have separate applications running in full screen on each display? So for example full screen mail on one display and then my other application running in full screen on the other?\n\nA: No fun, but the answer is no. Best you can do is choose which screen your app goes full screen on, which is a minor improvement on previously. It's tricky to accomplish due to the new screens workflow, an extended desktop onto a 2nd monitor is still just one 'screen', and you want it to display 2 different screens simultaeniously - a not unreasonable request, but one which is sadly unsupported at present.\n", "Q: Why does my MBP say it was restarted \"because of a problem\"? Since upgrading my MBP from Lion to Mountain Lion, every time I restart (planned restart, with nothing abnormal - I even close all applications before selecting Restart), my MacBook briefly shows the message \"Your computer restarted because of a problem\" when booting. Then, once I've logged in, I also see a dialog that says \"Your computer was restarted because of a problem\". As far as I know, there is no problem; everything seems to be working normally.\nHow can I begin to diagnose or get rid this? It's merely a cosmetic issue, I think, but it is annoying. I have read this Apple support document, but that only seems to be relevant in the scenario where the Mac crashed because of a kernel panic. As far as I know, mine didn't.\n\nA: I had the same annoying issue on OSX Mavericks (10.9.2), and resetting the NVRAM / PRAM as per Andrew Ferrier's answer didn't resolve it.\nInstead, I opened a Terminal window and found a week old Kernel .panic file in /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/\nI simply renamed it to .panic.old with the following command:\nsudo mv Kernel_[rest_of_filename].panic Kernel_[rest_of_filename].panic.old\n\nAfter a reboot I no longer get the annoying message!\n\nA: Resetting my NVRAM / PRAM appears to have resolved the problem.\n\nA: I had a similar problem with Big Sur. NVRAM/PRAM reset didn't work, but resetting the SMC apparently did:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-euro/HT201295\n\nA: I found that you can receive this issue by holding down your power-button to restart it. Are you hitting the restart button in OS X, or are you just holding down the power button?\n", "Q: When I close the lid and open it later in the day, will command line programs resume? I've been running a python script from the command line that's inserting data in a database for a couple of hours now. It will take at least half a day more before it's finished. However, I want to take the laptop with me to somewhere else. \nMy sleep at closing lid settings (if they exist) are at default (I've never looked at them). If I close the lid and open it in 4 or 5 hours, will the python script resume from where it left off? If not, can this be set to work in the preferences somehow?\n\nA: It should continue, if your script has any error-handling for loosing connection to the database (assuming off-site DB).\nThough the exact behaviour is hard to predict without seeing the actual code. Sleeping the system may also leed to unexpected results in the script.\n", "Q: Which Ports are open by Default on iPad 2 (iOS 6)? I have a Question:\nWhich Ports should be open on iPad 2 by default?\nBecause on a port scan, my iPad shows some completely irrelevant ports open (ex. IIS on port 1027)!\n\nA: No ports are open by default on iOS 6. This shouldn't be confused with the also true statement that iOS 6 will open network connections to several Apple servers so that APNS and iCloud push email and software updates work.\nYou will have to configure things like WiFi sync or run file sharing software or a web server to get the device listening on IPv4 ports.\nI use an app called Netstat from the iTunes Store to inspect all network connections. That should help you determine which setting or app has opened port 1027 on your device. On all my iOS 5 and iOS 6 devices, the only default open port (LISTENING) is on localhost/loopback.\n", "Q: Are .apple files potentially synonymous (or a wrapper to) .dmg files? We lost a .dmg file on an harddrive. Our tech guy was able to recover files from the drive but not one of them is a .dmg file. But they are a lot of .apple file. Can the .dmg file we are looking for be one of them?\n\nA: The .apple files are probably either AppleSingle or MacBinary files.  The Apple file system keeps more information about a file than other filesystems (Window, Unix, etc.) do, so AppleSingle and MacBinary formats were created to package up all that information in a way that could be transported on any file system.  \nSo if you're looking for MyDisk.dmg but instead find MyDisk.apple, that's probably the encoded version of the file you want and you need to decode it.  Try downloading the free StuffIt Expander and see if it can convert the files for you.  \n", "Q: Does Mac OS X load average reporting (via top) include processes waiting on IO? I'm looking at the output of top to view my system's load average.  I want to understand whether the load average is reporting processes just waiting for CPU, or whether it's reporting processes that are waiting for either CPU or IO.\nThis article suggests that most unix systems report only CPU in their load, but that linux in particular reports both CPU and IO.\nI'm guessing that OS X probably does not include IO in its load reporting, but I'd like to know for sure.\n\nA: On OS X, the kernel task accumulates IO wait time and the process accumulates CPU time managing the IO call setup and results but not the actual IO wait.\nPut another way, in top or Activity Monitor, IO waiting is time when the CPU is idle. The system/kernel would take any core storage / filevault processing time needed to accomplish the IO but for the general case with a normal drive there isn't CPU overhead on IO past the normal virtual memory overhead.\n", "Q: Can I obtain the Source Code for an app from its .ipa file? Having an .ipa file, is there any way I can get its source code?\nIt was possible when iOS apps used to be .app\n\nA: No - the IPA format does not make source code inclusion mandatory, so there’s no general way to do what you ask. As alluring as the idea is, just because something is possible on Android (What you’re talking about is not in the sense you want it), doesn’t mean it will be possible on iOS.\nNow, if the developer decides to embed the source code into the IPA - you will be able to read it depending on the method of packaging it since the IPA contents are well documented by Apple on the developer site and many utilities exist to decode the application bundles.\n", "Q: Repeating Reminders on desktop won't stay in sync with iOS When I create a reminder that is set to repeat, for example:\n\"take out the garbage\" repeat every 2 weeks.\n\nit pops up on my phone and on my desktop. \nWhen I check it off on my phone, my computer never gets the message that it was checked off. If I check it off on my computer, my phone never gets the message that it was checked off.\nI'm running OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.2 and iOS 6.0.1 on an iPhone 4S. \nThis has never worked for me and I've been through several versions of each OS.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: I fixed this.\nOn iOS I went to SETTINGS > ICLOUD > Turned Reminders OFF, then ON. It warned me that it would delete my reminders.. No big deal as they are still stored on iCloud.\nOn OSX I went to System Preferences... > iCloud > unchecked Calendars & Reminders ( it again warned me that it would delete them from computer which is okay because they are stored on iCloud) > Checked Calendars & Reminders (to turn them back on.)\nIt is now working as expected. Weird...\n", "Q: Time Machine deleting backups from several months ago (but not the oldest)? During its \"Cleanup\" phase, Time Machine has recently been deleting backups from several months ago—even though these aren't the oldest backups, and my backup drive isn't full.\nMy backups go back to January 2012, yet just today, Time Machine deleted backups from May 21, June 11, July 2, and July 23 (all in 2012). And plus, my Time Machine drive still has 200 GB free.\nWhy's it doing this? Shouldn't it just either delete my backups from January 2012 first (if it needs the space), or just delete the expired backups in the past 24 hours or 30 days (based on its normal rules)?\n\nA: According to Apple, Time Machine keeps backups \n\n\n*\n\n*hourly for the current 24 hours\n\n*daily for the last month\n\n*weekly copy until the disk is full\n\n\nYou may be noticing the system deleting \"extraneous days\", pruning the weeks' worth of daily backups down to the weekly copy.\nAs long as you can still view the weekly copies in Time Machine, they are still there.\n", "Q: Can I group canvases in OmniGraffle? I have an OmniGraffle doc that is like 30 pages / canvases long. I'd like to organize the canvases into groups rather than just a long list. For example, I'd like to have 'Menu' below, under which the 'menu-' canvases would be grouped. This is what it looks like currently:\n\nI'd like it to be grouped. Is this possible?\n\nA: It is not currently possible to \"Group Canvases\" in OmniGraffle Pro 5.\nYou may email omnigraffle@omnigroup.com and request this as a feature, or visit http://forums.omnigroup.com/forumdisplay.php?f=4 and post this request.\n", "Q: Apple Mail - Do not apply rules automatically As I understand it, active Apple Mail rules automatically get applied when mail comes into the Inbox.\nIs there a way to prevent rules from being applied automatically, so that they are only applied when I click the \"Apply Rules\" menu item (or use the shortcut, cmd-option-L)?\n\nA: Actually, when a rule is not Active, it is never applied, even when one manually selects Apply Rules... too bad, I want to do exactly that for years now, and it is still not working, the only way to implement rules is to have them applied automatically when the message enters.\n\nA: Apple Mail rules run automatically only the first time they're set. After that rules will only run manually. \nGoing into Preferences and unchecking 'Active' will deactivate the rule and will never run it.\n\nA: In Apple Mail, go into the Preferences and uncheck the \"Active\" box next to your rules.  Then they won't be run automatically.  They will be run if you manually select Apply Rules.\nIf you want some rules to run automatically and others only to be manual, you need to do a couple of extra steps.  First, move your manual-only rules to the top of your list of rules, because rules are applied in the order that they're displayed in that list.  Then, in your manual-only rules, make sure that the last item under \"perform these actions\" is \"stop evaluating rules.\n", "Q: Deleting a podcast off of an iPod Touch I downloaded a podcast directly to my iPod, decided I didn't want it, and now it will not go away. I can delete it from my iTunes library but the iPod just automatically copies it back in when I next sync it. I monkeyed with the podcast settings so only selected podcasts are synced on to the iPod, but it is still there (despite no longer appearing on the list in iTunes). Any ideas?\n\nA: Try to delete it directly on your iPod.\nIt may be in the Podcasts app (Downloads tab) if the podcast's download is still not finished, or in the Music app (Podcasts tab). To delete a podcast, you just have to swipe left or right on it.\nPS: Unfortunately, I don't know what iOS version do you have installed and I cannot comment to specify this, so I have written these tips for iOS 5.\n", "Q: Not Receiving Standard SMS on iMessage for Mac I have a new Retina Mac running Mountain Lion (10.8.2) and an iPhone running 6.0.1.\nOn my iPhone I can send and receive text messages from my email test@example.com and +1 (555) 555-5555. On my phone it has iMessage turned on, Send Read Receipts is on, Send as SMS is on, Send & Receive (2 Addresses which are my email and number), new texts sent from my number.\nOn my Mac iMessage I'm logged into my Apple ID and it says I can be reached from my email address or number (which are same as on my iPhone).\nIf an iPhone user texts me, it shows on my Phone and Mac and I can respond on my Mac or Phone.\nMy issue is that I cannot send or receive texts on my Mac to/from non iPhone users as I've been able to with Google Voice. I had thought with Mountain Lion you would not be able to at least receive texts sent to your phone number. Or is it still limited to only iPhone users? I would think if a non iPhone user sends to my iPhone number it would sync that message to my computer.\n\nA: Unfortunately, Messages for Mac only sends iMessages, and unlike Google Voice, doesn't send SMS messages. This limits Mac Messages to only be able to send and receive iMessages from other iMessage enabled devices (such as iPhones, iPods, iPads, and Macs). Also, another result of this is the fact that only iMessage threads will sync over to your Mac - SMS threads won't (as you have noticed).\nThis is indeed a limitation of the software, and not a configuration problem.\n", "Q: imac wi-fi problems I'm having a serious problem with WiFi on my iMac 21.5 inch running OS X Lion, up to date. It keeps disconnecting and when I reconnect it, it disconnects again, sometimes it stays on for about an hour or two, then disconnects again. Sometimes I have to restart my WiFi's modem. I check my phone, WiFi stays on all the time but only my iMac that keep disconnecting for no reason at all.\nIs there any way to fix this? I've tried to Google and some answers I've already followed but none of them seem to work for me, so I thought I might try here see if any of you guys could help me with this problem. It's so annoying when I'm trying to search or even just watch YouTube videos and then it cuts off and on and off so many times. I'm using eircom broadband from Ireland.\n\nA: In a wireless network there are many causes of failure.  Is there a cordless phone in your house that uses the same frequency as wireless networks (2.4 GHz or 5 GHz)?  Is there another device that uses these frequencies?  Do you live in a noisy area (an apartment with people above, below you, left and right of you) where people are using devices they have?\nHave you (can you) tried moving the computer closer to the wireless modem?  Is this more common during the day (when most people are at work), or at night (when most people are home)?  Do you have fluorescent lighting?  Are there any Amateur radio operators in the area that do microwave work?\nWhat have you tried?  Have you seen any change with what you've tried?\n", "Q: Why do I keep receiving my own text messages when I text ONE of the five lines in our family plan? I received a message yesterday asking something about my Apple ID and concerning one of our other lines that used to be shared on the Apple ID with my phone. We stopped that later and used individual IDs. Since I was in a hurry I just clicked yes and went on. As soon as I did it, now my texts keep coming to myself and when I text that other line it shows in a group message it is from me instead of the other line. And the other line gained my contacts mixed in with that line. What do I do to stop it?  It is driving me crazy!\n\nA: I just figured this out as I had the same issue.\nWhat you need to do is click on your Settings app and scroll down to the green messages icon, click on that and scroll down to the Send & Receive setting. Next to this, it will have the number of addresses, that is: two addresses, click on this and untick the number and email address that are not yours. This should cure the problem for you.\nIf you have FaceTime active, then I’d advise checking it to make sure that only your number and your email address are filled in.\n", "Q: Does Do-Not-Disturb mode silence your phone's alarms? If I turn on Do-Not-Disturb, will it also silence my phone alarms?\n\nA: Simply put: No, it does not.\nI suppose this prevents an alarm not going off when you really need it to (i.e. waking you up).\n\nA: This is from Apples website:\n\nTurn on Do Not Disturb to suppress all incoming calls and notifications. Enable it  manually or schedule a recurring time. Or allow calls from your favorites or specific contact groups.\n\n", "Q: How can I tell if my iOS device is currently jailbroken? How can I find out if my iOS device has been jailbroken (with a drive-by exploit for example)?\nIs there an app for that?\n\nA: Basically, if you can execute arbitrary code or write to arbitrary disk locations, you're jailbroken.\niOS security researcher Stefan Esser (also knows as i0n1c) has developed an application called System and Security Info to determine if an iOS device is currently jailbroken by testing for the abilities that you gain from jailbreaking.\nUpdate: Apple has taken down System and Security Info.\n\nA: Well if you are on iOS 6 then it is not possible, you would also have a Cydia application on your screen, like this:\n\n\nA: It can be difficult it if was done stealthily (for example - it's fairly easy to hide things like Cydia) - my approach would be to see if iBooks or Skype work - iBooks has historically been broken by jailbreaks and Skype is designed to prevent use on a jailbroken device (which is annoying if you want to use skype, but excellent if you want to know if you are on a jailbroken device).\n\nA: A jailbreak is essentially 3 points:\n\n\n*\n\n*Patching the kernel to bypass code signing enforcement\n\n*Making the system partition writable\n\n*Providing a way of actually accessing it via one of more of:\n\n*\n\n*AFC2 server for USB access\n\n*SSH server for wireless or tunneled USB access\n\n*A file management app\n\n\n\nTo check for the presence of AFC2 it is sufficient to use a dedicated PC app such as iFunBox while checking for SSH is harder due to the ability for a dedicated individual (or software!) to change the listening port from the standard 22. And this 3rd point isn't even formally required to call it a jailbreak.\nYou can check for the 2nd point by checking the /etc/fstab file, and since having access to the root partition would easily demonstrate being jailbroken the only alternative would be a SSH ramdisk.\nIf you're really paranoid about it and don't care for some potentially wasted space if your device was indeed jailbroken, you can create a local backup via iTunes and restore the OS followed by the backup.\n", "Q: Microsoft Office 2011 OS X and unicode I have problems with my Word files when I try to open them on Windows machines. So, I checked the file and got that Word file has Unicode symbols. How to fix it? Thank you.\n\nA: If the problem is that some characters do not appear but small rectangles are shown instead, as I suspect, then it’s probably a font problem. Quite possibly the Windows machines lack fonts that contain the characters needed.\nIn that case, you could download and install some suitable free fonts on the Windows machines. To identify a character (possibly displayed as a small rectangle) in a Windows version of Word, click on the position right after the character and press Alt X. This turns the character to its Unicode number. For example, ∅ turns to 2300. The Unicode number can then be used at http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/search.htm where you can find information on font support to different characters, using e.g. character name or Unicode number as key.\n", "Q: How can I move junk emails on my iPad without displaying the message body? One reason I don't like using my iPad for email is that I can't find a way to move a junk message without its message body being automatically displayed when selected. While viewing a mailbox, tapping Edit then selecting a message will show the message body.\nMy concern is that HTML code in the message could let a spammer know that the message sent to me was viewed, confirming validity of my email address. Is this concern valid? What can I do in Apple's Mail app on iPad to move junk messages without viewing the message body?\nI store my junk messages in an IMAP folder, and use grep to see which email addresses are being targeted.\n\nA: A spammer could validate reception by inserting an image which is hosted on a remote server in a HTML email. A unique code per recipient could be appended to the URL of the image, at which point the remote server can know which addresses recieved and opened the email.\nWhile the default setting on iOS is to load remote images automatically (and hence makes your email address vulnerable to this kind of tracking), you can change this to Off in Settings - Mail, Contacts, Calendars - Load Remote Images.\nPlease note that this will prevent any remote images in any email to be loaded automatically, and therefor possibly breaking the layout of HTML emails, but you can always manually load the images in an email by tapping the appropriate button at the bottom of the email body.\n", "Q: How can I conveniently pause and play my iPhone audio with minimal touching of the phone? Okay these are my problem scenarios:\n1) I'm cooking something and my hands are covered in animal fat. I'm listening to a podcast on my iPhone, which is sat on a counter nearby. It's been playing for some time so the display has turned itself off. Someone comes in and asks me something and I need to pause it quickly, then play it again when the person has gone.\n2) I'm listening to an audiobook and the chapter ends. It's a good point to stop listening and go do something else. By the time I've reached for my phone, swiped to unlock it, opened the app and tapped pause, the next chapter has started and the story has now stopped mid-sentence.\nSo basically, isn't there some solution for these important first world problems? I don't like using headphones all the time, so a headphone-based remote control is not a solution for me.\n\nA: The WATCH has been released since this question was posted. If you’re open to buying one, you can of course play and pause by speaking to it. “Hey Siri, Play/Pause.”\nEven without an WATCH, starting with iOS 8 your iPhone can also respond to “Hey Siri.” The feature is enabled by going into Settings → Siri. Enable both Siri and Allow “Hey Siri”.\nOn the iPhone 6s and above (including iPhone SE), the low-power M9 motion coprocessor allows this feature to be invoked at any time (provided the phone is not face down on the table, or in your pocket).\nEarlier models can activate the feature while plugged in to a power source.\n“Hey Siri” will allow you to start playing music without touching your iPhone.\nStopping it is trickier, and requires the volume to be turned down very, very low. You have other options, of course, such as Control Center, Lock Screen Music Controls, Today Widgets (depending on the app) and manually invoking Siri by long-pressing the Home button.\nIt’s also worth mentioning that the built-in Music app prevents the screen from locking if music is playing while the iPhone is plugged in to a power source. The display will dim after a while, but a simple tap will light it back up without asking you to unlock it. Other apps may do the same.\n\nA: This remote control appears to connect to the Bluetooth in your phone in order to be able to control it's audio output. \nYou could also purchase a dock with a remote for your iPhone. A remote of this nature would have a hardware Play/Pause button on it which you could press to quickly stop the music.\nFor the sake of example: I found this so you can get a picture of what I'm talking about.\nOne other thing: double tapping the home button when the iPhone is locked comes up with Play/Pause controls which you could tap with your knuckle or something. This is also a fast and easy way to change tracks in general.\n\nA: I use the Take Five app to make pausing music or podcasts extremely simple. \nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/take-five/id361799359?mt=8\nYou get the default 5 minute pause and the music will resume, but you can drag the slider to many more minutes if desired. \n\nA: Use a stylus to double tap the home button, then press pause with the stylus. They can be bought cheaply. Your greasy fingers only touch the stylus, not the phone. The tip of the stylus that touches the phone stays clean. You might have some trouble if your hands are dripping wet and you want to keep the phone dry, but it will work if your hands are covered with animal fat or other things you don't want to get on the phone. Two taps to the home button, one tap to the pause button. You should be able to pause in about one second. \nWash the stylus along with the dirty dishes when you are done cooking, and keep the stylus in the kitchen, ready to use. \n", "Q: Master volume control is grayed out on my Mac 10.6 (MacBook Pro Late 2009) master volume control for both Line-In built and for external USB Microphone is disabled (grayed out)\n\nNobody really wanted to help what is the reason and how to bring back such behaviour. Googling didnt provide answer.\nWhat I want is to have master volume slider active at least in Blue Yeti microphone.\nAny help?\n\nA: With some digital audio input devices, by design, it is not possible to adjust the volume level within  System Preferences, Audio MIDI Setup, or GarageBand or the like. The volume level can only be adjusted on the external digital audio device.\nI suggest that you contact the technical support staff at Blue Microphones, the company that makes your microphone, to ask them about this.\n\nA: You could check System Preferences > Sound > Input and make sure it is set to the correct audio device.\nWithout more information it's difficult to offer much more advice than that.\n\nA: I ran into issues where my audio controls were disabled similar to what you describe. I can't be sure it's the same issue, but in my case, killing the Core Audio process fixed it.\nOpen up Terminal and enter this command:\nsudo kill -9 `ps ax | grep 'coreaudio[a-z]' | awk '{print $1}'`\n\nYou'll be prompted to enter your password, but that should find and kill the proper process, which will then auto-restart. Your volume control should come back to normal within a few seconds if this is indeed the problem.\n\nA: If you are using a device that does not support volume control, such as the DAC I plugged in and showed up as \"HD USB Audio\", you can work around the issue by using SoundFlower.  Install SoundFlower, set \"Soundflower (2ch)\" as your output device, start up Soundflowerbed, from the menu icon set the 2ch Soundflower device to forward to your \"HD USB Audio\" (or whatever your device is called).  Now, Soundflower should be able to software-control the volume before forwarding the signal to your hardware.  Good luck!\n\nA: Looks at the microphone input jack and see if it's glowing red.  If it is then your computer thinks a microphone is plugged into it.  Fiddle with an aux input putting it in and taking it out at different speeds.  This should resolve the issue (if only temporarily).\n\nA: I have found in later (2013) vintage Macbook Air's that the headphone jack no longer works as a line-in. I ended up buying a cheap USB minijack adapter for this. Although it's a touch temperamental, it does do the trick for recording audio in.\n\nA: Volume sliders\nIf software volume control is available for your device, the Volume sliders are blue to indicate they are active. Drag the sliders to set the volume for each channel.\n\nA: Just resolved this issue on OS X Mavericks. I'm not sure how it started on my computer to begin with. I went to Audio MIDI Setup. Then in the Audio Devices I went to Built-In Output. Then where it says \"2ch-24bit Integer\" I selected \"2ch-16bit Integer\". After that I was able to change the volume and the volume icon wasn't greyed out. You can then change it back to \"2ch-24bit Integer\" once you get the volume working again.\n", "Q: Mac mini, two monitors over hdmi and Thunderbolt simultaneously Will the new Mac Mini (mid-level, quad-core) support the following two\nmonitors simultaneously: one an Apple Cinema Display 30\", 2560x1600\nresolution, connected to both the Thunderbolt port and one USB port via the\nMini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI adaptor (this thing:\nhttp://store.apple.com/ca/product/MB571Z/A/mini-displayport-to-dual-link-dvi\n-adapter)\n and the other monitor a Samsung with 1600 x 1200 resolution connected to\nthe Mini Mac by the hdmi port, using the hdmi-to-dvi adaptor Apple gives you\nwith the Mac Mini?                                                              \nI have read in some places that hdmi cannot output better than 1920 x 1080,\nbut 1600 x 1200 is actually fewer pixels and I have read differing accounts\nof whether it will work.                                                        \nFor the Apple Cinema Display, currently on my MacBook Pro 2009 I run it\nusing the adaptor I mentioned above, and it needs to connect to one USB port\nas well as to the miniDisplay Port. I am guessing that the Thunderbolt port\nwill serve instead of the miniDisplay Port and I will still need to connect\nto one USB port on the Mini, in addition to the Thunderbolt port.               \nThank you!\n\nA: Yes, that will work.\nThe maximum for HDMI 1.0 is actually 1920x1200, not 1080. Later revisions can go higher, but previous Mac mini HDMI ports have been limited to 1920x1200 and there's no reason to believe it would have changed.\n", "Q: Noise canceling headphones make strange sound when I touch my MacBook Pro I've got headphones plugged into my desktop, and a laptop nearby that I use for work as well.  Whenever I touch my MacBook Pro with the noise-canceling on my headphones turned on, it makes my headphones go nuts, creating a lot of buzzing, crackling, and popping.\nI assume this has something to do with conduction between my hands and the computer, but is there any way to get around this?\n\nA: It appears your wall socket is not properly grounded, which may cause electrical interference on your headphones when touching the MacBook Pro.\nHave a look at this related answer on possible measures you can take to establish a proper electrical grounding.\n\nA: I have a similar issue with my MacBook Pro and an old Pioneer amp. Whenever I plugin the laptop into a power socket the amp (plugged into the same wall socket) starts to buzz and make popping sounds.\nThis is called a ground loop and to get rid of this loop needs to be \"broken\".\nI have found two ways to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect an external display to the MacBook Pro. It gets rid of the hum.\n\n*Get a ground loop isolator and connect your headphones through it.\n\n*Ensure your Mac power adapter connects with three conductors to a properly grounded outlet and check for a stuck pin in the MagSafe connector in case the break in grounding is there.\n\n", "Q: Can iOS receive gmail's instant (within several seconds) push notification for email? I want the ability to send an email to an iOS users iPad's POP account and have them instantly recieve a notification.\nFor example, on my Android devices, since gmail is built into the system, if anyone emails my gmail address, I get a notification about 1 second after they hit send on their end.  If its a pop account, then I have to wait until the next pull, every 15, 30, etc minutes (whatever the user has it set to).\nCan iOS receive the gmail type instant notifications? And if so, how does the email account or notifications settings need to be set up?\n\nA: You cannot have Push notifications for a POP3 email account. The only supported mail accounts for push email notifications are iCloud/MobileMe and Exchange with ActiveSync support.\n\nA: On the iPhone if you go to Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > Fetch New Data you should see the option to turn Push on. It's not always perfect and not all protocols support it so there's another section below it called Fetch. When Push can't work Fetch will retrieve data at the intervals you set which are Every 15 minutes, Every 30 minutes, Hourly, or Manually (meaning only when you open the email client and/or tell the client to sync).\n\nA: If the iOS user has a Gmail account, it can be set up with instant push notifications. There are simple instructions on the Google website about setting your Gmail account up as an Exchange account. \nI recently swapped from iPhone to Android and have been surprised how poorly push works on Android compared to iOS.\n", "Q: HiDPI on Lion: Most windows blurry In order to make an app I'm developing Retina compatible, I enabled the \"HiDPI\" mode on my Mac (OS X 10.7.4 Lion), since I don't have a Retina MBP. The Quartz Developer Tool worked as indended, and I can select the HiDPI modes in system preferences. However, almost everything is rendered in scaled mode, i.e. pixelated. Only some parts of the \"shell\" are rendered with sharp fonts; the menu bar, the dock, Launchpad and Mission Control, and the \"About this Mac\" window. Everything else looks bad, including the app I intended to fix.\nI remember this used to work, at least for a couple of applications (and my own, if I edited the Info.plist file accordingly). Is something broken on my system, or did maybe an update remove this feature for non-retina-MBP Macs?\n\nThe screenshot doesn't really do it justice.

Ever since I got my MacBook Pro this year, I do not get any reminders via gmail, to my desktop PC (or Android phone, it seems).\nI rely heavily on the reminders so I really do need this to start working.\nEvery time I wake my MacBook Pro, I notice that my gmail inbox in the browser, as well as my Mail inbox, are full of all the reminders I missed! \nSo it's almost as if the MBP is \"consuming\" these. I have wondered if it is Mail's fault, and I've done my best to turn Mail off for good (I only ever use gmail via the browser) but every time I wake the machine, Mail is back again, and my inbox is topped up with all recent reminders. Not sure if this is what's causing my reminders not to go to my desktop / 'droid.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Weird: Gmail had, for whatever reason, chosen to begin marking all my calendar event reminders as spam. I find them in my spam folder today, and this had indeed begun just a day or two after I got my MBP. Gmail claimed that it was sent to the spam filter because \"It's similar to messages that have been detected by our spam filters.\" (in the header above the spam-filtered email).\nThe solution was to explicitly whitelist all google calendar event reminders, as follows.\nI also had to clear and reset each of the default notifications for the calendar as here.\nNow I can get on with my life.\n", "Q: How do I rename desktops in Mountain Lion? It seems that Apple doesn't provide a way to rename desktops from the default \"Desktop 1\", etc. Renaming desktops would be great for my workflow.\nDoes anyone know how to do this manually or with a third-party app?\n\nA: If an application is in full screen mode in a given space, that space will have the application's name under it when it is displayed via Mission Control (and you put your mouse cursor over the desktop). Otherwise, I do not believe that there is a way to rename them.\n", "Q: Fresh install of iOS 6.0.1 apps constantly crash I just finished a fresh install, started installing apps and signing in again. Every time I login to an app it crashes within a few seconds. Going back in stays there, sometimes crashing again. \nI'm new to troubleshooting iOS - what's my next step?\n\nA: While I have had no problems with IOS 6.0.1 installs on the iPhone 4 and 4s in my household some generic troubleshooting steps would include:\nNOTE: back up your phone with iTunes before doing any of this!\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold down the top button until the phone prompts you to power it down. Do so. once it is off hold down the top button again till it powers back up.\n\n\nfailing that...\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold down the top and home buttons until it just turns off (ignore the prompt to shut down normally). Once off power up and try again.\n\n\nfailing that...\n\n\n*\n\n*I heard a while back that if you have THREE power downs in a row (as in #2 above) the phone does some major housekeeping on the third time booting up. Not sure if that is true but on a couple of occasions doing three in a row on my iPhone 4 fixed an issue. So do #2 above three times in a row and then test for symptoms.\n\n\nfailing that...\n\n\n*\n\n*Attach the phone to your Mac/PC and when iTunes comes up, click on the iPhone in the side panel and then click on the RESTORE button. That will wipe the phone and then restore from your backup.\n\n\nfailing that...\n\n\n*\n\n*Take it to an Apple store and ask a genius.\n\n\nA: I couldn't take the crashes anymore, which totaled 30+ in a day, so I did a fresh Restore again. This somehow cleaned up whatever had occurred. Unfortunately I cannot explain more than this being a fluke. \n\nA: This has also happened to me. It even got to the point where I went to Apple and they just gave me a new iPhone 4S. But about a week later my new iPhone started to do the same thing again.\nI'm pretty sure that if you \"Restore as new\" it will temporarily fix the problem, but it will eventually come back. Hopefully they have something that can fix this in the next iOS 6 update.\n\nA: Mine has done this twice now since upgrading to iOS 6.0.1. Even iPod crashes when playing music. I nailed it down to something to do with the network. If I put the thing into \"Airplane\" mode, everything that isn't a network app will work just fine until I decide to exit.\nI really do hope that this is fixed soon, too. Because the full restore is so...time consuming. And temporary.\n\nA: Just bought a new iPad 4 with iOS 6.0.1 and apps crash randomly. But as you said most crashes are network related. Using search in music app crashed it while i had enabled home sharing but never when using offline music.\n Safari crashed many times using a proxy server but rarely on no proxy connections.\n Also app store crashed once.\nSo maybe there is an exception thrown by a network library and not handled correctly in iOS 6.0.1?\n", "Q: Change the shortcut of cmd+Q for all applications I use cmd+tab, cmd+W, cmd+A a lot and I don't remember how many times I hit cmd+Q accidentally.\nIs it possible to change the shortcut for quitting applications from cmd+Q to something else (not to disallow using keyboard to quit applications), ideally for applications all at once (not to do it for individual application one by one)?\n\nA: This should change the shortcut to ⇧⌘Q for most currently installed applications:\ndefaults write -g NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add $(mdfind kMDItemContentType==com.apple.application-bundle | grep -v { |\nsed 's/.*\\//Quit /g;s/\\.app$//g;'\"s/'/\\\\''\\\\'/g;s/^/'/g;s/$/' '\\$@q'/g\" | uniq | tr '\\n' ' ')\nYou could also use KeyRemap4MacBook to change ⌘Q to some other key combination or require holding or pressing it twice to quit an application.\n\n\nA: Howtogeek devoted a whole article about this subject and they provided an excellent tutorial on how to do this. Basically it comes down to override the default function.\n\nBUT there is a (huge) disadvantage, if you do it that way, you'll have to do this for EVERY application you use, which might work a bit confusing...\nSo they provide a work-around rather then a solid solution.\n", "Q: Can someone explain what \"Standby time\" is on iOS? Here's my iOS 6.0.1 log after about 9 hours off the charger. \"Standby\" seems to be including \"Usage\".\nI've had the phone off the wall for only 9 hrs, but the sum of Standby and Usage are over 15 hrs.\nWhat is \"Standby time\" on iOS 6 anyway?\n\n\nA: All iOS use the same definitions of standby time. \nStandby is the accumulation of all of all powered on time since its lasts full charge. Whether the device is actively being used, running with the screen off or sleeping, this time counts towards the standby category. \nUsage is the amount of time the iPhone has been awake and in use since the last full charge. This use can be an active use or certain background tasks like navigation or checking mail periodically or receiving push notifications and events. \nThe only time between now and the last time of charge that doesn't go towards standby is if you power down the device.\nTherefore, if you've got some background tasks, such us auto-cheking emails, or any background-running Apps, the numbers for the Usage Time will increase although you're not actively using your phone.\n", "Q: Applescript to type text, followed by a modifier key combo?

My friend's iPhone 4 has a strange behavior. When on 3G, going to an IP detection website, his IP seems to be changing pretty much on every request! His phone is supposedly traveling all over the world at every http request. \nIt's not the carrier, because we tried to switch SIM cards and the issue is attached to the phone.\nOn Wi-Fi it seems to be OK. \nHis phone is jailbroken, however I couldn't see anything installed regarding this. But I'm no expert. \nAnyone has seen this before? Is there a known application or setting that may create this? Where should he look?\n\nA: The IP address will change as you move base stations or your data requests are load balanced by your provider. This is because it is not your IP address but the IP address used by the provider to service the internet request.\nIt will be the same when on Wifi since your routers external IP address will persist for its connection to the outside world. However if that changed (if you rebooted your router and don't have a statically assigned IP) then you would observe the same behaviour.\nThese changes should happen over half hour or longer intervals, so if you are seeing changes that are minutes apart, then the traffic is being routed to a service that is anonymizing the source IP and/or potentially being tampered with.\nSee the tor project for a description of how this works when people want to show up in web server logs as coming from many diverse IP addresses.\n", "Q: How to stop uTorrent on specific network?

I have Retina Macbook Pro 15' connected to an external monitor.\nIs it possible to close the MBP's lid and still use the external monitor without entering sleep mode?\n\nA: Yes, it should work without any special extra configurations. You only need to have the macbook connected to an external display and also have an external keyboard (probably it also works without the external keyboard, but what will you do without it :p). If you have the lid closed and macbook is \"sleeping\", you can wake it up (by pressing any keyboard key) and start using it with the external display without requiring to open the lid.\nCheers!\n", "Q: Keyboard-only folder navigation with auto complete This is one feature of Windows 7 Start menu that I haven't been able to replace in OS X ML.\nIn Windows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Windows key\n\n*Start typing, for example: H:\\folder\\phot\n\n*Use arrow keys to highlight the \"search-complete\": H:\\folder\\photos\n\n*Press Enter and voila, the folder is opened in Windows Explorer.

I'm using MBP and external monitor, keyboard and mouse. I'd like to be able to zoom in the text in Safari. Safari keyboard shortcuts for zooming text areCommand +/-. I would like to use Ctrl+scrolling with the mouse. This works in Windows 7 for instance.\nCurrently, Ctrl+scrolling is zooming the entire screen, not text.\nCan I zoom text in Safari using a mouse? \n\nA: *\n\n*To zoom inside safari you can use 2 fingers pinching in the trackpad.\n\n*2 fingers tap will zoom so the text fits the safari window.\n\n*Also a single finger double tap in the mighty mouse does the same trick.\n(not double click)\n\n\nIf you want even more ways to do stuff with your mouse I know about this software called MagicPrefs that I used for quite some time and loved it.\nThere is also a similar software called BetterTouchTool.\n\nA: To turn off zooming of the screen go to the Accessibility preference pane ad uncheck the following option under the Zoom section:\n\nUse scroll gesture with modifier keys to zoom:\n\nThis might release the functionality you wanted.\nUnfortunately I cannot test this since I'm using a MBP without a mouse and so I can only use the trackpad pinch zoom (however, I would rarely do that over using the keyboard).\n\nA: I found partial answer:\nI'm using BetterTouchTool and using Ctrl+Left/Right mouse button I can zoom in/out text - couldn't find a way to do it via scrolling instead of mouse's buttons.\n", "Q: Trackpad and mouse different scrolling directions Is it possible to have the trackpad scrolling direction different from mouse connected to the MBP?\nEDIT: Found the solution, check my answer below.\n\nA: Found the solution.\nApparently you can solve it using software.

I'm on Chrome 24 right now, so they've had ample opportunity to fix the problem since you reported it. But they haven't. \nThe problem actually is - web pages that are longer than the viewport and have content you have to scroll down to see will not work with the two finger swipe, the page will just slide up or down based on the direction you're pushing in.\nThe solution - use BetterTouchTool to define your own two finger swipes for Chrome. I did that and it started working instantly for Chrome. It works on all pages, regardless of whether they have scroll or not. I tested on a lot pf pages. \nI know that this will not be as 'sexy' as Chrome's inbuilt swipe, but it works. You will also be dependent on BTT but I use it on so many apps that it remains on at all times.\nI use BTT for three finger swipe in Finder to go back and forth and also for four finger tap to close a window (this works globally).\nAll the best!\n", "Q: If Macbook has been wiped, will \"find my iPhone\" still work? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhy does a MacBook Pro keep dialing in it’s location through Find My Mac after a clean install? \n\nMy MacBook was stolen last week, and I have just realized that I had set up iCloud and \"find my iPhone\".\nIt is currently showing up as off-line. I do not know whether it will connect if the thief has already wiped the system. I've set up to get an email alert if it connects.\nIf my MacBook has been wiped by a thief will the \"find my iPhone\" app still work to locate that hardware?\n\nA: If the computer has been wiped by the thief, Find my [Mac] may not work for it, and it will likely continue to show offline. There is nothing that can be done at that point in tracking the computer. \nAs pointed out by @Gerry (thanks Gerry), if you wipe your Mac out using Find my [Mac], it may still show up, unlike iOS devices. This is because a Find My [Mac] token is written to NVRAM (persistant memory on Intel Macs), and unless they go in and disable the feature themselves in OSX System Preferences - something they would probably do - you will continue to be able to track the device.\nEmail notifications do work very well, and it is entirely possible the thief is just waiting for awhile before booting up the computer. Hopefully, he will start it up, and connect to the internet, and allow you to get enough information together to get the police involved.\nMost of the time, though, the more tech savvy thieves will wipe the computer immediately, and disable Find my [Mac] which makes it impossible to track the computer.\n", "Q: The Mac App Store won't let me update iMovie and iPhoto because it says i bought them under a different account I just bought this computer in August -- i have been the only one to use it, have only used it under my itunes/apple account. But ever since the first week or so that i've had it, i've had update available for iMovie and iPhoto that it won't let me use because it says i'm not signed into the account i bought them with.\nAny fix to this problem?\n\nA: Contact Apple billing support and/or the place you purchased the Mac to see if they can assist with resolving the server side issue. The OS updates are tied to the serial number, but the iLife apps go through a redeem process where the hardware identifier and your Apple ID get bond together, and the Apple servers apparently think a different account is set up for those apps on your Mac.\nI'm assuming you have no idea and don't recognize the other Apple ID and it wasn't just a case of you accidentally redeeming the applications. I'm also assuming you can sign into the account you intended to redeem these apps. At worst, Apple or the seller should be able to gift you the apps to the correct account so you can get updates going forward if you (or someone else trying to be helpful) has made a mistake.\nHere is what a Mac should look like before you have \"accepted\" the iLife apps by opening the App Store App and signing in and choosing Purchases (command-4) from the menu bar.\n\n\nA: I remember a similar problem for users whose Mac were running languages different than American English. \nFor those it could be fixed by setting the system language to american english - reboot - do the updates - then set language back to their preferences and reboot again.\nI know it sounds rather like black magic and unfortunately I can't locate the reference.

If keyboard shortcuts are enabled in gmail, pressing / will focus the search bar from anywhere, so that I can simply type /stuff to search for \"stuff\" no matter what is currently focused.\nIs there a similar keyboard shortcut to focus the search bar within applications (not spotlight)?\n\nNote: I'm looking for an alternative to hitting tab repeatedly.\n\nA: I don't believe there is a system-wide shortcut for this, as the definition of Search Bar may not be standard across apps. But hitting ⌘+F focuses the Search Bar in many Mac applications.\n\nA: As already noted, most applications use Cmd+F for search. However, in some applications Alt +Cmd+F triggers the main search dialog (e.g., iTunes) or a secondary form of search (e.g., Excel, Finder, Safari, Chrome).\n", "Q: iPhoto 9.4.2 crashes on startup and reboots MacBook Pro 10.8.2 When I attempt to open iPhoto (9.4.2) on my MacBook Pro (10.8.2) iPhoto crashes and it reboots my laptop. iPhoto will open if I boot the MacBook Pro in safe mode.\nWhat could be going wrong?\n\nA: This link to Apple's Support page on Safe Boot, or Safe Mode, details what what is loaded and what is not, and may point you to possible problem areas.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT1564\nBut more details would be helpful. Which MacBook Pro, whether you've repaired disk, what manintenance utilities you run. Often, with crashing apps, removing its Preferences file cures the problem. Sometimes--not often, but sometimes--a fresh install of the app is the solution. \nAlso check your Crash Reports for clues--and google the problem as well. Of all Mountain Lion Apple apps, iPhoto is certainly the touchiest. If you have Photostream turned on, try temporarily turning that off.\n", "Q: Where is the hard drive in a Mac Book Pro 15\" (early 2011)? This morning I am hearing an occasional periodic quiet clicking type noise from my macbook, from roughly the lower right quadrant, underneath the arrow keys.  I have no CD/DVD in the optical drive.   The noise repeats 5 to 10 times and then quits for a while, and it repeats at a regular rate of less than a second.\nMy question is: is that where my hard drive is?  If not, what is in that spot?\n\nA: As you can see in iFixit's teardown, the hard drive is located in the lower right corner. The lower left is pretty much just the battery, which doesn't really have any mechanical parts that could make a clicking sort of noise.\nPerhaps listen a little closer and see if you can isolate the noise better. I would also strongly recommend making regular backups if you don't already, as a clicking hard drive is not a good sound, if that is where it's coming from.\n", "Q: Is there an app that can save dual-display window states and automatically save/restore them when I disconnect/reconnect the dual display? I have a dual-display setup, and I have many open windows on each of my displays. When I disconnect the display and reconnect it, all the windows are positioned on my native display in an unordered fashion.\nTo avoid having to continually redistribute my open windows among my two displays after disconnecting the external one, I'd like to have two \"profiles,\" one for when the display isn't connected and one for when it is, such that all windows have a state associated to one profile and they are automatically changed back to that state when that profile becomes active.\nDoes anyone know of an app that can do this?\n\nNote: I'm looking for an alternative to Stay; it didn't work properly for me.\n\nA: I do use Stay and am happy with it :) \nBut I also use another app that I really like called Slate ( https://github.com/jigish/slate ). Slate is open source (and free), and does allow to define things like Stay (profiles: layouts of windows - which I think will fit your needs), but also allow move windows with keys combinations, and many other interesting things... \nI also have dual display setups and managed to get things working fine with Stay. I have 3 setups two in dual display and one without external display and it works just fine, restoring the windows to their positions when I connect a particular profile (I previously configured... I had to create some simple rules). I use Slate for moving windows around with the keyboard... I think it is a good combination :p\nCheers!\n\nA: Try Moom. It does all sorts of window-organizing tasks, but  for your specific needs, you can save a specific set up of windows, and have it automatically restore to that arrangement based on your display configuration.\n", "Q: iTunes: how can display multiple versions of a movie in SD and 1080p/720p HD as one movie? I want to store the same movie in multiple quality levels. I have 3 files (360p, 720p and 1080p).\n\nObviously having the same movie multiple times in iTunes it not acceptable. I can't fill my library with duplicates.\nHow should I proceed to make iTunes display the 3 files as one movie? Currently I have 3 movies in iTunes.\n\nI saw a way (adding (HD) to the name of the file) but it doesn't seems to be enough. Adding the HD tag as in this answer doesn't help either.\n\nA: Download Subler (http://code.google.com/p/subler/). It open your HD version of the movie in Subler and make sure you check off and mark it as an HD version. This then adds the meta-data so it know's it an HD movie.\nAlso, make sure it's marked as a Movie. Normally it'll appear as Normal.\nFinally, you need to add a meta-tag on the first tab. ContentID needs to be populated, and it has to be unique to your library, and the same for both files. Basically, pick a random number and shove it in.\nYou can then re-add the movies and it'll bundle them together. At this point you can remove them from iTunes (select and delete). I would choose the Keep Files option, and just drag them back to iTunes to get it re-add them.\nPersonally, I use iVi (available from the Mac App Store) and if you select the options for both SD and HD output it will do all the work for you.\n", "Q: How to force Thunderbolt-ethernet connection when switching networks without restarting computer? I have a thunderbolt to ethernet cable on a MacBookPro Retina on Lion. \nSometimes the thunderbolt to ethernet connection does not work. It seems to occur when I switch network locations (e.g., I move from my home network to my work network). Restarting the computer fixes the problem, however, I don't want to have to restart my computer.\nHow can I force thunderbolt to ethernet to connect without restarting the computer? \nMore details:\nUnder network settings, there is a red dot and not connected on \"Thund...thernet\".\nIt further says:\nStatus: Cable Unplugged\nEither the cable for Thunderbolt Ethernet is \nnot plugged in or the device at the other end \nis not responding.\n\nUnder system information - thunderbolt it states\nThunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter:\n\n  Vendor Name:  Apple, Inc.\n  Device Name:  Thunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter\n  Vendor ID:    0x1\n  Device ID:    0x8003\n  Device Revision:  0x1\n  Route String: 3\n  Firmware Version: 5.5\n  Port:\n  Status:   Connected\n  Link Status:  2\n  Port Micro Firmware Version:  0.0.8\n\nUnder Network - Thunderbolt Ethernet it states:\nThunderbolt Ethernet:\n\n  Type: Ethernet\n  Hardware: Ethernet\n  BSD Device Name:  en1\n  IPv4:\n  Configuration Method: DHCP\n  IPv6:\n  Configuration Method: Automatic\n  Proxies:\n  Exceptions List:  *.local, 169.254/16\n  FTP Passive Mode: Yes\n  Service Order:    0\n\n\nA: Workaround that worked a few times for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*unplug the thunderbolt converter\n\n*Wait few secs, ten plug it back in\n\n*Go to Settings/Network/advanced/refresh DHCP lease\n\n\nA: It seems like this issue at least for me may have had nothing to do with the thunderbolt connection. Rather it was a more mundane networking issue. I.e., when I moved between networks, network settings needed to be reconfigured. Techniques like renewing DHCP lease and using the \"assist me\" procedure in network preferences seemed to be sufficient for me to reconnect using Ethernet after switching networks.\n\nA: Had this same problem, and unplugging/replugging didn't work.\nIn the end, restarting with the cable unplugged, and then plugging back in, worked.\nNot at all clear why, but before I did that, no Thunderbolt devices were showing up at all in System Report even when the cable was plugged in.\n\nA: I had this problem, too, and an Apple Support call and Genius Bar visit later, I had the answer: if you're using Network Locations that preexist your Thunderbolt display, it doesn't seem to auto-add the possibility of \"Display Ethernet\" to your available network ports. To solve this, either:\nCreate a new Location in your Network system preferences. It will finally detect the \"Display Ethernet\" and use it. It'll slowly change from disconnected to No IP to green-is-for-go. \nor\nFix an existing Location by clicking the + to add a port and choosing Display Ethernet. It'll slowly change from disconnected to No IP to green-is-for-go. \n\nA: Same problem here. IMHO it's a bug in OSX. Unplugging/plugging kicks something in the OS and then it comes back to live. \n\nA: Same problem in Yosemite on a MacBook Pro with two Thunderbolt ports. Mac OS X seems to believe that the Thunderbolt ethernet adapter is really another Thunderbolt bridge because I see two Thunderbolt bridges. The solutions suggested are vague and clumsy, but lacking a command line solution there is only unplugging (like above), replugging, then adding an ethernet to an existing location without the wifi adapter in it.\nThe actual problem seems to be caused by a wifi connection becoming active and precluding the ethernet connection. The best and most permanent fix I have found is to turn off wifi before arriving at the office. Then plugging in the ethernet always works. But if I allow that wifi connection to become active first, then plugging in the ethernet quite often fails.\n\nA: There is another problem related to this. Often when I unplug the thunderbolt-ethernet connector from the mac's thunderbolt port, my thunderbolt (display port) DISPLAY connected to the other thunderbolt slot goes black. No \"no signal\" but just a black screen. The computer does not crash, sometimes I hear audio continue to play for instance. \nPlugging back the ethernet connector then sometimes restores the display but the ethernet is still broken then. If I also unplug the display then the computer  (which is in clamshell mode) seems to hang up instead of going to sleep. I can hear the fans running. It takes about 5 minutes before the laptop then finally goes to sleep. Sometimes opening the laptop then helps out. Other times, I need a hard shutdown.\nTo me this problem seems not related to WiFi as I always have it off. (but maybe the system tries to turn it on and fails on that?)\nFrom this correlation between the display and the ethernet, it seems the real problem is in the thunderbolt driver, not in the ethernet. \nSorry that this is no workaround but maybe it gives some new suggestions to work around this\n\nA: None of the above solutions worked for me, but one from https://rohanradio.com/blog/2012/02/27/fixing-thunderbolt-ethernet-on-the-macbook-pro/ did:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo rm /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/NetworkInterfaces.plist\n\n*Unplug the Thunderbolt Display\n\n*Restart\n\n*Plug the display back in\n\n\nA: [Catalina 10.15.5]\n[Though an old issue, this thread pops at the top of Google.]\nWhat worked for me was to select the Thunderbolt Ethernet entry, make it inactive (using the cog menu at the bottom left) and apply the changes, wait a moment, then make it active and apply the changes.\nTedious but worked.\n", "Q: how do I share photos on the web with iPhoto / iCloud? I have a new Mac (Mountain Lion) with iPhoto '11.\nI want to share photos on the web.  In the past, I would launch iWeb and build a little photo album web page.  My understanding was that if I subscribed to .Mac/MobileMe I could share my iWeb page that way, but instead I always FTPed my web page to my own web site.\nOn my new Mac, I see that iWeb no longer exists.  In iPhoto I discovered there's something called \"photo streams\".  I signed into \"iCloud\", I dragged some photos to my \"photo stream\", and it appears the photos are now online (unless I'm not understanding something).\nI signed into www.icloud.com, but I don't see any photos there.\nQUESTION: What am I missing, or, What is the \"correct\" way to share photos on the web with iPhoto '11?\n\nA: iCloud is not a replacement for MobileMe--those great-looking photo albums are a thing of the past.\nPhotostream shares photos between Macs, iPads and iPhones, automatically and pretty instantaneously — unless of course you turn it off -- in a separate album from the device's camera roll. \nApple no longer provides a way to share photos on the web. Mores the pity. \nEdit: iOS 6 offers Shared Photo Streams on iCloud.com. \n\nShared Photo Streams allow you to post and share photos to a Photo\n  Stream album hosted by iCloud. The photos stored there don't count\n  against your iCloud storage allotment, and will work over Wi-Fi and\n  cellular data. You're able to share photos with fellow iOS users as\n  well as by creating an iCloud.com Shared Photo Stream album for\n  non-iOS users.\n\nSee the rest of the How-To on CNET.\n", "Q: Managing and sorting home movies and shorts in iTunes? I currently have a large collection of short movies from Youtube and quite a large selection of home movies.\nWhat is the best way of managing all these files? I need to keep them separated from my iTunes purchases and DVD rips...\nI'd like to sort them in separate pools (movies, shorts, home movies) but also categorize them even the home movies (vacations, weddings, paintball events...).\nI would like to access them from the Apple TV, sync to iPhone etc... So I'm stuck with iTunes.\nHow should I proceed to organize them.\n\nA: This is a pretty personal question, but:\nPersonally, I keep home movies in iPhoto. Seems a better location to me. They go with the photos of the event, keeps everything together. iPhoto for me is personal collections of events, and iTunes is proper content to watch.\nShorts go in Movies (you can't create a top-level category in iTunes) with everything else. You can use Playlists to categorize. You can set your own Genre in the meta-data to aid categorization.\n", "Q: Sending messages from an iPhone sometimes goes to email rather than to mobile I have an iPhone 4S. When I send a text message it sometimes sends to the contact's email address rather than their mobile, if within the contact I have both email and mobile included. How do I prevent this - I always want to send to the mobile number.\nAlso, I can't tell whether it goes to email addr or mobile number - the receiver tells me eventually.\n\nA: When you create a new message, it will prompt you to chose between somebody's email and phone number to create a conversation (for MMS and iMessage conversation)\nYou probably chose the email by mistake once (and maybe the phone number another time), so now, you have 2 conversations for the same person. One to the phone number, one to the email.\nYou will need to delete the email one by opening the conversation, scrolling to top and selecting \"Contact\". From this view, you will see either the email or the phone number in light blue. If it's the email, go back and delete this conversation.\n\nA: In the case where you are sending an iMessage, the only item you have control over is the address book entry.\nIf you delete the email address - your Messages app will be forces to ask for delivery to the phone number. If Apple messes up the delivery down the road when looking up the actual devices and indicating which thread / to address to actually send there's not much you can do.\nThe person on the receiving end has the most control over this. If the reason you are wanting to change this is for their benefit, you can get them to go into their settings and remove the email addresses.\nBefore Mountain Lion and iOS 6 you had to use an email address to \"receive at\" on non phone clients, but you can now de-select those email addresses and only use one (or several phone numbers) as only option for the \"receive at\" and \"start new conversations from\" settings.\n\nThe iOS preferences for Messages are not as complicated so I showed the more involved of the two. You can do the same deselection on all iOS devices and clear out any old conversations so you don't accidentally re-use the wrong address.\n", "Q: How to locate a file in Spotlight using folder and file name? I often want to navigate to a file or folder that does not have a unique name. Instead, the parent folder in combination with the file or foldern name makes it unique. Here are a few examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*I want to open readme.txt in the folder called ABC rather than readme.txt in the folder called CDE or FGH.\n\n*Each year I teach a subject where the folders are organised subjectname/2011, subjectname/2012, etc. I want to be able to search subjectname 2012 because 2012 is not unique.\n\n\nWhen i enter a part of the path and the filename into Spotlight, the file is not found.

It can't be used in constructing searches.\nkMDItemPath\nComplete path to the file. This value of this attribute can be retrieved, \nbut can't be used in a query or to sort search results. This attribute can’t \nbe used as a member of the valueListAttrs array parameter for MDQueryCreate \nor MDQueryCreateSubset.\nValue Type:      CFString\nFramework:       CoreServices/CoreServices.h\nHeader:      MDItem.h\nAvailability:    Available in OS X v10.4 and later.\n\n\nA: If you're comfortable opening the terminal you could run the command\nlocate ABC/readme.txt\n\nand it will give you the full file path to any files on your machine that are named readme.txt in a folder named ABC.\nWhile you're there you can copy and past the path as an argument to the open command and it will open it for you.\nTaking it one step further you can use the output of locate as the arguments for open with xargs\nlocate ABC/readme.txt | xargs open\n\nWill open all files that have ABC/readme.txt on your machine just as if you had double-clicked them.\n\nA: I've been looking for the same thing for many years. I know there are tons of creat command line tools, but wanted something to basically replace Spotlight, especially since Spotlight has gotten even worse in Big Sur. I finally just came across GoToFile, which seems to do exactly what you're asking for!\n\nA: Thank you to @nine9ths for pointing out the locate command as one option. Here are a few additional observations.\nPartial matching and multiple search terms\nI often have folders where I can only partially remember names of files and folders. And the folders may not necessarily be in the immediate parent folder (i.e., it might be the parent of the parent folder). One way of performing a boolean type partial matching search is to combine piped grep commands. For example:\nlocate AB | grep readme\n\nwould pipe (|) all paths that match AB into grep. The remaining paths would also match  readme. Thus, this would match ABC/foo/readme.txt, ABC/foo/readme.md and ABC/readme.txt.\nCase insensitive search\nSpotlight search appears to be case insensitive which generally seems convenient. For the same behaviour with locate and grep use the -i flag.\nlocate -i AB | grep -i readme\n\ngrep commands can be repeatedly applied to further filter the results.\nSelecting a path from a list\nIn some cases, even after several greps, I find that I can still be left with a handful of matches and I just want to select one of them from the list. There are various ways of selecting a single line by number. Here a couple of options for selecting for example line 4 of some list of paths from a locate search\nlocate AB | grep readme | awk 'NR==4'\n\nOpening a selected path\nAs @nineths notes once a single file is obtained, the output can then be opened with a default application:\nlocate foo | xargs open\n\nor with a specified program on the path such as Vim\nlocate foo | xargs mvim\n\nxargs does not work, at least by default, if the path includes a space.\nAnother option is to send the path to the clipboard and paste it somewhere (e.g., into an Alfred search or a Finder Go to folder dialog box).\nlocate foo | pbcopy\n\nAlternative to command-line selection and opening\nPresumably there are several alternatives to using the command-line to select and open a path from the list of returned paths.\n\n\n*\n\n*In iTerm2 holding the command key and clicking a URL or file/folder path will open the URL or file in the default application.\n\n\nCustomisation of locate\nThis tutorial from Geek Stuff discusses various customisations to the locate command (e.g., filtering out certain directories and filetypes).\nPotential to use mdfind instead\nIn general all the examples using locate above could be replaced with mdfind.\nlocate generally references additional system files whereas mdfind accesses those files indexed by Spotlight. mdfind is case insensitive by default, which I generally find convenient. mdfind also has additional search options e.g., you can add kind:fol for folders. The main difference is that mdfind only searches the file name. Thus, if path information is being used to limit the search, then that must appear in the subsequent piped grep filters.\nFor example, if I wanted to find a the folder called 2012 where subjectname appears in the path the following would work\nmdfind name:2012 kind:fol | grep subjectname\n\nNote that name: seemed to be required because the text was all numbers.\nSummary thoughts\n\n\n*\n\n*Speed: The locate command runs faster than the find command but at a similar speed to mdfind.\n\n*Ability to filter: If you have information to partially match on the file name or you want to use additional search tools mdfind seems better (assuming the file is indexed by Spotlight).\n\n\nIn general all these approaches seem a little bit fiddly and have a fair amount of unnecessary syntactical overhead.\n\nA: You may want to check out Findspot. Findspot supports full path searching so you can include the folder name and filename in your query.\nHere is a screenshot of Findspot using your example:\n\n", "Q: Trying to update iPad 2 to iOS 6 I tried updating my iPad to iOS 6.  I plugged the iPad into my computer and it showed that is was backing up, however the update never showed up on iPad.

Then just:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your device the computer.\n\n*Select your device when it appears in iTunes under Devices.\n\n*Click Check for Update in the Summary pane.\n\n*If an update is available, iTunes prompts you to download and install the update. \n\n", "Q: How to find the location of an icon file on OS X? I am trying to find where the icon file is located for certificates on OS X.

If you can tell me where to find such a file, I might have better luck.\nI was, however able to find a similar image. It's located at /System/Library/Frameworks/SecurityInterface.framework/Versions/A/Resources/CertLargeStd.png (at least for Mac OS 10.8.2) and it looks like this:\n\n(CertLargeStd@2x.png is the one used on Retina screens.)\nThis is the image shown when you view a certificate in Keychain Access or Safari:\n\nTo find this image, I opened up the Safari panel above.

I'd like to use the same iTunes library on all of the machines, so I moved the library folder and all of the media to a network drive.\nI updated the library on a Windows machine, but when I access the song on my Mac, it says that the file cannot be found.  This is because on Windows, the path was something like:\nfile://localhost/Z:/Music/Slayer/...\n\nWhen my Mac asked me to locate the file, I checked the path and it reads something like:\n/Volumes/Storage/Music/Slayer/...\n\nI'm still pretty new to OSX, but I'm having a hard time finding a solution that allows me to use the same library on both my Mac and my PC.\nI'd like to be able to update a library on any computer on the network and it updates the \"shared\" library, so I am able to sync my iDevice to any machine on the network.\nHow do I set up the network so the media file path can be the same on both my Windows and Mac machines?\nThank you.\n\nA: Basically using iTunes on a shared storage is really bad. Even if you get it running as you want now, you need to reconnect to the network storage before launching iTunes EACH time (and never open iTunes if not connected to the network) otherwise iTunes standard behaviour is to recreate a new iTunes library locally and then you're stuck there again.\nHowever:\nYour current problem is most probably that you are using the same iTunes library file/database on both machines (residing on the network volume). There are two parts to your iTunes Library: The iTunes Library Database (.itl and .xml files) and the Media itself. You want the library database to stay in it's default location on your local drive and You Only want the Media folder to be on the NAS.\nTo achieve this you start up iTunes with a empty library (in the local Music folder) on EACH machine then import the music from the network folder. But before importing make sure you change the setting \"Copy files to iTunes media folder when adding to library\" to OFF! Otherwise your data is copied back to the local machine...\nThen never start iTunes with your network storage disconnected and you will be fine.\n\nA: Hmm, I do this and most often open the iTunes Library on Mac (networked to the PC where the iTunes folder, .itl file and the media are) but sometimes on PC directly.  It does work well, (I chose using an old 3.0Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo PC rather than a NAS) so maybe I can help if anyone is still interested. I have the Music folder in a Media drive which is a separate volume on the PC. This is shared over the network and its network name is also Media. It may work because of something simple like making sure it is on a separate drive and you NAME the drive it is on on the PC the same as the SHARE name. Also I wouldn't do this unless you are using a Gigabit ethernet network.  Wireless is not fast enough. Every time you open on PC after Mac and vice versa it needs to check the library which takes about 30 seconds. If you were using wireless this might take 10 or 20 minutes. I suspect what it is doing is remapping the media each time the change takes place.\n", "Q: What can cause an iPhone 4 to not actually sync data when told to sync? My iPhone 4 (iOS 6) has stopped syncing wirelessly (with my Mac) over the course of the past few weeks.  When I connect it via the cable, iPhoto pops up and I can get the photos off, but it doesn't start syncing the music / apps automatically.  I have to hit the \"sync\" button, and even then, it doesn't appear to be pulling the \"last played\" data off the phone.  \nThe checkbox for \"Open iTunes when this iPhone is connected\" is checked, as is \"Sync this iPhone wirelessly\", and the \"Sync Music\" stuff... I haven't done anything over there.  I've restarted the iPhone several times, did a restore after 6.0.1 came out, and am considering reinstalling iTunes on the Mac (though I'm not even sure that's easy or possible).\nWhat might be stopping the sync from being effective?\n\nA: iTunes uses iTunesHelper.app to detect if an iPhone has been plugged in. This app is usually started as a login item. Therefore you could check if iTunesHelper.app ist listed here: Preferences -> Users -> Login Items. If it's not listed you can drag it back as described here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2313998?start=0&tstart=0.\n", "Q: Any stock means of inserting a period by pressing the spacebar twice?

Edit .plist will hide both menubar and dock icon. Are there any way to hide the dock icon but keep the menubar icon?\n\nA: You have to edit the Plist file for the app. Plist files use a key/value format, declaring the type of the key. The correct code is:\n<key>LSUIElement</key>\n<string>true</string>\n\nStick these in before the </dict> </plist> lines, and voilà.

More like of an \"index\" page where you get to see the files and sub-folders inside a path/folder. Like this one:\nWhen I use Chrome, I just type the tilde \"~\" character on the address bar, which many of us know, represents the \"home directory\" of the OS. It's easy for me because Chrome just lists all the files under that directory in a list format inside the browser. I can just click the HTML files or any file/folder for that matter to view its content.\nI know this can be done just by using Finder to navigate your directories and files, but it's much easier to just click around files where you know it will still end up displaying in the browser.\nAs I have tested, when typing the path or even \"~\" in the address bar, what it does is either do a web search or open that folder in Finder. Just not what I want.\n\nA: I don't think this is possible. I looked at a list of Safari Extensions, and no extension I found has this ability.\nNOTE: If you put the actual URL path description in the Safari address bar, ex: file:///Users/Panoy, Safari will open a Finder window to that path, not display the path in the browser window itself.\n", "Q: identify if Filevault is enabled on remote Mac I need to do remote checks to verify OSX has filevault enabled.

When I tried, it said that Mountain Lion was not found in applications, and I could not move it into applications because it was not found.\n\nA: From the description of your problem I'm going to guess you are trying to use Lion DiskMaker.  If that is the case then this hopefully will help with your issue and if it is not the case, here is another possibility for making a bootable USB drive.\nLion DiskMaker looks for the install image you downloaded from the App Store when you upgraded.  The problem is that when you upgrade the install application removes the install image once it is complete.  Good news is you can go into the App Store and download the install image again.  Once the image is downloaded it will be located in /Applications.  Now Lion DiskMaker will locate the image when you go to create the USB device.\nBelow are a couple of links for more information and clarification on the software.\nLion DiskMaker\nCult of Mac Instructions\n\nA: I can't exactly follow the problem you are describing. But the error message which you report here does not seem familiar to me:\n\"it said that mountain lion was not found in applications\"\n\nMy problem with this message is that the Mountain Lion installer application - which you downloaded from the App Store - is not required to create a Recovery USB after having upgraded to Mountain Lion. Hence, the application is removed.\nHere's a guide on how to create a Recovery USB in (Mountain) Lion:\nApple's Recovery Disk Assistant\n...enables you to create a recovery USB. While this recovery USB does not contain the installer image, it is still able to install Mountain Lion.\nYou can download the official software from Apple here. Note that you can create the recovery USB only if you have a Recovery HD partition on your Mac. You can verify this in the Terminal using: diskutil list.\nThe Recovery Disk Assistant requires just 1GB because is does not store an OS X installer image (usually named InstallESD.dmg). Instead it will download the latest version of Mountain Lion right before the installation - if the recovery USB has been created in Mountain Lion.\nYou are still able to use the recovery USB without internet access if you just want to open Disk Utility from it for example.\n", "Q: Large difference in reported free disk space I have a strange discrepancy in the amount of free disk space that's being reported.\nThe finder says:\n\nMy iStat Menus says:\n\nWhich is the same as df -h reports:\nremco@Prosperpine ~  $ df -h\nFilesystem                          Size   Used  Avail Capacity  iused   ifree %iused  Mounted on\n/dev/disk0s2                       148Gi  127Gi   21Gi    87% 33479179 5383643   86%   /\ndevfs                              187Ki  187Ki    0Bi   100%      646       0  100%   /dev\nmap -hosts                           0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%        0       0  100%   /net\nmap auto_home                        0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%        0       0  100%   /home\n\nWhy would such a large difference occur? I've checked the disk using the disk utility and it does not report having any issues.\nSpecs: Late 2011 MacBook Pro 17\", non-Apple Intel 160GB SSD, OSX Mountain Lion 10.8.2\n\nA: Check the Storage section of About This Mac. You will probably see the missing 15GB listed there as \"Backups\". These are Time Machine local snapshots, and Finder ignores them when calculating free disk space, because they get deleted automatically when your free disk space drops below 20%. In other words, they give up their space automatically as needed, so the number in Finder is the one you should pay attention to.\n", "Q: Make the Menu Bar never show while in Full Screen Pretty much every application I use in full-screen (including Firefox, MacVim and the Terminal) have tabs on the top of the screen.\nThe problem is that when I move my mouse to reach the tabs I'll often accidentally touch the top of the screen, bringing in the OS menu OVER the tabs:\n\nIs there any way to change this behavior? I'd prefer it if the menu bar would stay hidden when I'm using a full-screen app, even if my mouse does touch the top of the screen.\n\nA: The menu bar can NOT be hidden on command whenever you like to due to limitations in Mac OS X. Apple can do this in their own programs but they have NOT made it possible for other developers in Mac OS X. \n  One of the reasons being that Apple Menu sits on the Menu bar and is helpful if the application becomes unresponsive or if the user needs to log off /shutdown the machine. \nThere is an application called Menu Eclipse which lets you change the Menu Bar behaviors(except for hide it).\n\nA: The closest solution I've found is to do as mentioned earlier, disabling \"Displays have separate spaces\" in Mission Control. This only makes sense in a multi-monitor environment, as the menubar still shows on the primary monitor.\nIf you make the app \"go fullscreen\" (click green button), it fills the whole screen, but all other screens go black, and the menubar gets moved to the app's screen.  So the solution there is to manually expand the app's edges as far or high as you want.  Once upon a time, VMWare had some kind of full-screen workaround that didn't use Apple's full screen mechanism.\nUnless/until Apple sees this as a problem that needs fixing, you're going to be hard pressed finding a non-hacky solution.  It is so integral to how the operating system works (like the home-button on the iPhone/iPad/iPod).\n\nA: My solution in Python:\nimport autopy.mouse as mouse\nfrom time import sleep\n\nwhile True:\n    x, y = mouse.location()\n    if y < 5:\n        mouse.move(x, 5)\n    sleep(0.1)\n\n\nA: One possible solution is not to get rid of the menu completely, but actually keep the menu always on (it's not that big), and just get rid of the Dock instead, by doing the following trick.\nGo to terminal and type:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock tilesize -int 1\nkillall Dock\n\nThis will make your Dock small.

Associate an unique Command shortcut for it, like Shift+Command+\\ or Command+F11 for example.\n\n\nThis creates a shortcut to cause an application to enter full screen while removing the menu bar, or to exit full screen bringing the menu bar back. It provides an alternative full screen shortcut!\nFor application-specific full screen launchers, check my other answer.\nCaveats\nThere may be some disadvantages and/or misbehavior using this approach:\n\n\n*\n\n*It works by setting ApplicationType=UIElement, which causes the application icon not be added/highlighted in the Dock and make the application inaccessible via Command+Tab. The Command+Tab issue was reported in comments, I didn't notice it since I mostly use the Mission Control overview to change between full screen applications.\n\n*It may not behave as expected for some specific applications, I've noticed issues with the Activity Monitor application (which is generally not used full screen anyway) and there's a report on Chrome, which I didn't try since I use Firefox and it works great.\n\n\nA: I use Firefox and solved it by editing the browser chrome (userChrome.css).\nI just reversed the vertical order of the main browser elements (tabs, toolbar, main content). On the screenshow below, notice my tabs are at the bottom.\nThis layout looks strange at first but I don't care - I just want to avoid the constant problem I have with unintentionally revealing the macOS menu bar while in fullscreen mode.\n\nHere's my userChrome.css (I kept it simple).

If so, a brief outline of how this would work would be ideal since I'd like to actually do this to extend my Mac's usable characters with some custom designs.\n\nA: The character palette simply gives you access to the characters in the fonts on your system.  To add something to it, you need to create a font with that character in it or add the character to an existing font.  Common font creation tools for OS X are Fontlab and Fontforge.

After it's plugged in, the audio stops coming out of the MacBook's speakers, just like it would if you had headphones plugged in, but there's no audio coming out of the TV speakers. \nWhen I plug in my MacBook Pro 15\" (not Retina) with this setup, the audio works just fine. Is there something in the Retina model that's blocking this? Any advice would be great. Thank you.\n\nA: You say it works fine with your set up. Are you connecting to his TV?\nIf so, it points towards the issue being with his MBP.\nOne quick bit of troubleshooting you could try - plug a set of earphones into his MBP and ensure audio is being sent. That'll help to isolate the problem.\n\nA: Is the client certain that the TV has a 1/8th input rather than output?  Is the TV set to the correct input?

I can't find a KB article with the exact details, but Apple's iBooks page corroborates this.\nAs for getting the actual PDFs on your device, you could always use OS X's Web Sharing to temporarily allow access to the PDFs via Safari, and then save them to iBooks. That way you don't have to worry about the PDFs touching any computer you don't control. Drag and drop via iTunes unfortunately doesn't seem to work as you'd expect.\n\nA: I would recommend GoodReader as a PDF (and not only PDF) viewer.\nThere's a nice way in this app to move files to an iTouch directly: you can transfer them through a Wi-Fi Network to the local server of the application.\nYou can turn the iCloud synchronization off in GoodReader - Settings - General settings.\n", "Q: Help with iBooks not being able to send a PDF using the share icon?

Is there an extension or a plugin that allows for marking different tabs with colors ?\nI want to be able to group together a bunch of tabs that are relevant under one color using Safari.\n\nA: Unfortunately the range of extensions available for Safari is pretty limited, and no one has written such an extension at this point.\nAlso having written an extension or two for myself in the past, there is no way to access the tabs and colour them in any way, so it would not be possible.\nIt may be worth looking at another browser such as Google Chrome, or Firefox.\n", "Q: adding a secondary group for user via CLI in Lion is not working I need to assign a secondary group membership to a user on a client machine running 10.7.4.

But he knows my account information, and I have the device on my Macbook iTunes, and the name is all of a sudden his name. Is there a way to be able to tell if he changed it or if I were to plug it in my computer would I be able to tell if it's mine?\nAlso is there a way I can get Apple to tell me what my iPod Touch name was in March and to see if it's the same as what he changed it to?\n\nA: I had to retrieve a serial number from a device which was lost. If you go to https://supportprofile.apple.com/ and login with your iTunes account, then it should show every device you've either bought through the Apple Store, or synced with iTunes, along with the serial numbers. I hadn't known about this before I had to use it. \n\nA: You can get the serial number for iPod/iPhone/iPad devices you've plugged into your Mac with iTunes from the file ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iPod.plist.\nFor more info on opening plist (Property List) files, see How do I open a .plist file?\nInside com.apple.iPod.plist, the Plist structure has a Dictionary of Devices, with each device listed separately under that, using a unique hex string (something like 4223F0FD7A331BA1), under that you'll see useful information like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Device Class (e.g. iPod)\n\n*Connected (last date iTunes connected to the device)\n\n*Family ID (Apple's code for a specific family of device models)\n\n*Serial Number\nThe first few should let you figure out exactly which one is the iPod you think your friend has stolen. The last 3 digits of the Serial Number specify the device model, so you can differentiate some of them based on this advice if there are multiple iPods listed. The Serial Number of course cannot be changed so identifies the specific device.\nIt's not entirely clear from your question how you're seeing the device in your iTunes, but presumably it is on the same wifi network or something? If your iTunes has connected to both yours and his iPod (which you allege to be the same device), then you should be able to check whether it is indeed the same device by looking at this list of devices. I'm not sure if this list is updated for devices seen on the wifi network or not though, or whether its only for devices that actually sync.\nYou should be able to tell fairly easily if his iPod is in the list though by checking the 'Connected' dates on any iPod devices in the list.\nIf its a different device (and if your com.apple.iPod.plist file hasn't been cleared since you lost your iPod), then there'll be a separate entry for each. For example, another iPod in the list that was last connected around the date you lost yours, along side his new iPod... If its the same device, then it'll only have one entry, so your old one won't be shown separately, and you will see the Serial Number there, with a recent 'Connected' date. However this isn't exactly proof since its still possible your old iPod is simply not listed for some reason.\nIf your friend's iPod isn't showing up in the list (based on recent Connected dates), then you can hopefully at least get the serial number of your iPod from this list (again, if it's not been cleared for some reason). You can then compare it to the serial number of his iPod to check if it's the same. Here is some info about getting serial numbers off iPods.\n", "Q: Which mkv player for iPad mini? What video player for iPad mini supports mkv format best?\n\nA: You can use VLC player.\nOr, you can use Handbrake to convert MKV to MP4.

I've attached some screenshots to describe the issue.\nUpdate Further investigation suggests that this might be a problem with 2012 Mac models only, specifically the ones with HD4000 graphics.\nUpdate It appears the artifacts don't always show up immediately, requiring some reloads and/or closing/reopening tabs before they show up.\nUpdate The issue is confirmed as not a WebKit bug, and has been filed as a bug at Apple (problem 12750455 by Simon Fraser).\nTwitter Bootstrap website on Safari\n\nTwitter Bootstrap website on Firefox\n\nTeak's jsfiddle on Safari\n\nTeak's jsfiddle on Firefox\n\nLinks to the websites shown on the screenshots:\n\n*\n\n*Twitter Bootstrap\n\n*Teak's jsfiddle\n\nA: I can confirm this is a bug with the Intel Graphics 4000 GPU. I see the graphics artifacts on my 13\" Retina MacBook Pro and not on my older MBP which has Mt. Lion and an Nvidia Geforce GPU.\nI have first hand experience with this issue while trying to develop css buttons for websites...\nI believe the artifacts can be reproduced by using the css3 border-radius in conjunction with a box-shadow. Though obviously it happens in many other circumstances as well. (Which I can confirm)\nHere is a link to a bug report on webkit website (though I'm not sure it belongs there):\nhttps://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103087\nAnd the SO question it came from:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/13505314/artifacts-on-css-rendering-box-shadow-on-safari-6-0-2-on-mountain-lion\n\nA: It was a bug in Safari, resolved in OSX Update 10.8.3!\n\nA: This is not Intel HD 4000 bug. I can see this bug only from Safari on Intel HD 4000. If i open page with (Opera, Chrome, Firefox) - i can not reproduce this bug\n\nA: A quick fix to this problem is using a transform on the object with the border-radius or other damage causing property. That way you're forcing a redraw with the graphics card, and that removes the problem.\nApply the following property: -webkit-transform: translate3d(0,0,0); - And you should be fine.\n\nA: Here are things I would do if you can't provide a link to something that is live on the internet for others to duplicate / suss out what's happening.\n\n\n*\n\n*Try a nightly webkit build to see if it's a bug that's fixed, but not shipping. http://nightly.webkit.org\n\n*Remove all extensions from Safari to be sure it's not caused by one. \n\nA: I can also confirm this bug on retina 15\" macbook (osx 10.8.2, safari 6.0.2)\nMy macbook also has Intel HD4000, but also Nvidia GT 650M for the external display. \nTo eliminate all other possibilities but the graphics card (driver) I used a thunderbolt to dvi adapter to connect an external display on the Nvidia card. \nResult: No weird lines and freaky jquery effects!\nconclusion: HD4000 (driver) problem.\n", "Q: Safari - menu to show live tabs open in open windows I often have five or six Safari (and Chrome) windows open, each containing several tabs. I often lose track of where a live tab is when I want to return to it.\nI can use the Safari window menu option from the main menu to list the names of the active/front tabs in all the open windows, but this doesn’t help me if the tab I’m after is not active/at the front of its window.\nIs there an AppleScript or extension that expands on the 'window' menu to list ALL tabs within a window as a child menu item / drop-down?\nThis would save me minutes of frustration everyday. I’d love a similar solution for Chrome! I've come across https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/ for Firefox which looks good but I’d prefer that the tree or list is available from the main menu and not within the browser viewport.\n\nA: If you have Alfred 2, there is a workflow for selecting Safari tabs by typing. It includes tabs from all windows, but it doesn't group them by window.\n\n", "Q: What causes the temporary loss of around 20GB of hard drive space while using XCode? I've got a hard disk of 120GB (20GB free space). I'm a developer in XCode and sometimes I get the \"low disk space error\"-message that I can't even save my coded files before cleaning some of the space.\nI don't know why this happens because without performing anything I'm losing about 19GB of space. This lost space regains if I restart the mac. I asked around with my friends, and they don't get this kind of behavior, so it seems I'm the only one.\nI've tried MACKeeper Utility to clear unused things but it's only a temporary solution!\nDoes any of you have an idea what to do?\n\nA: The issue is probably that the space is being taken up by swap files and possibly a hibernate sleep image. To see this do an ls -l /var/vm These files are deleted on a reboot and start increasing as you use more memory and Xcode takes a lot of memory.\nYou need to reduce the space used by the rest of the system. apps and data. Basically 120GB is too small unless you only use it for development and not any music or other media files. You can save a bit of disc space by removing unused applications and clearing out other languages (see other questions here) but getting a bigger or external hard disk is probably a better use of your time.\nTo see where the space goes see the applications in this question or from the command line du.\n\nA: @Mark is right about it being caused by extremely large swap files -- but you don't need a new disk really.  It is a problem from within Xcode.  If the swap files have gotten over 60 GB then just quit and restart Xcode.  It will start over again at 0.\nIt seems to me that it is the indexing and autocomplete that is causing the problem, so if you can afford to code this way, just turn off autocomplete by going Preferences / Text Editing / Code completion: (uncheck all).\nThat much swap disk should not be used by Xcode.  If the problem happens consistently, try submitting a bug report.\n", "Q: Why would the \"Enable LTE\" option be missing in an iPhone 5? I have a iPhone 5 updated with the latest IOS (6.0.1); when going to the cellular options, there is no \"Enable LTE\" option.\nCould this be because my carrier (TIM, Italy) doesn't currently support LTE/4G? But shouldn't at least the option be there?\nMy carrier will start implementing LTE/4G in the next weeks/months, it should be available shortly in major cities, at least for testing; but if I can't even enable it on my iPhone, how am I going to test it?\n\nA: The LTE toggle shows up when your carrier settings indicate LTE is available for your device.\nIf you have data, you can update OTA by going to Settings > General > About and waiting (or tapping on your current carrier settings to see the details).\nA tethered check is also available by connecting your iPhone to iTunes and checking for an updated carrier profile for your provider. If there isn't, the most likely explanation is that your provider has not enabled LTE in their carrier settings. If so, contact your provider on whether any LTE (even if not theirs) will work on your iPhone.\n\nA: I have a iPhone 4S and I don't have any of the connections (4G or 3G). I don't see any options displayed in Cellular settings. What should I do?\n", "Q: Can Coda 2 be made to uploads to locations other than the root of a website? I am using Coda 2 coming from Dreamweaver, and it all seems great.\nHowever, uploading a file or 'publishing' (what's actually the difference here?) seems to stick the file in the root. Even when the local file structure maps directly to the remote structure. VERY annoying!\nMy local root is my local folder and my remote folder is the standard / web root. They should reflect one another perfectly, but uploading always goes to root.\nEven if I 'drag' a file from the local view into the correct folder on the remote...it puts it in the root of the website.\nThe only way I can get it in the right place is to move it on the remote server and over-write it. Too long of a process to be productive as changes occur all the time in development.\nCan anyone tell me how I can fix this issue? Is it a setting somewhere? I do not have this problem with Dreamweaver.\n\nA: Publishing is different than uploading in Coda.\nUploading will just upload to whatever folder you are in in the web view (bottom of the file list pane, 2 icons, local and remote).\nSo if you are in the root on the web view pane, anything you 'upload' will go there. If you want to upload by manually 'uploading', navigate to the folder you want in the web view, then whatever you upload will go there.\nIf you want to upload files retaining their structure, you want to 'publish'. So you can either 'mark for publish' or when you save a file, it gets marked for publish, then you can publish the lot, which will upload everything in its right place.\nOf course, this all depends on your folder settings. Make sure you have the right info in your settings pane, for local folder root and remote folder root etc.\n", "Q: What terminal command or program can list an SSD's Power On Hours?

I'm not hiding it from the NSA, just someone that might steal my laptop or access it, etc. \nIs there really much difference? \n\nA: I would guess that the weakest link isn't the choice of formats, but your picking a decent password and not letting it get observed or captured.\nIn the general case where there is a system tool and a third party one, I usually start with the tool that is built in until I have good, definite and enumerable reasons to not use the default tool.\nGo with encrypted disk images in the case you have set out.\n", "Q: Can't see Macbook WiFi-access point on Android smartphone I'd like to connect my Android phone (Samsung Galaxy Nexus running Stock JellyBean) to my Macbook Pro (early-2012, running OSX Lion) via an access point created by my Macbook Pro.\nSadly I can't even see the access point on my Android phone.\nDoes anyone know a possible solution to this problem?\nAdditional information: A nearby Windows-PC and iPhone can connect to the AdHoc-network of the Macbook. The android phone can connect to all other wifi.\n\nA: Sadly, most versions of Android do not support adhoc networking (only infrastructure), which is almost certainly what your Macbook is broadcasting. There is a program called Wifi Adhoc Enabler on the Play Store, which will allow the device to see adhoc networks. I think it requires root access though. \n", "Q: How do I make ⌘← and ⌘→ work for home/end combo for Terminal? Why does fn-⇧-→ (or others) do a home/end in Terminal but a ⌘-→ works everywhere else?\nSo just to be clear the question is how to make Terminal take Command + ← and → for home and end?\n\nA: As convenient as it would be, Terminal can't easily provide the functionality you ask for.\nThe reason is that programs that run inside Terminal have different rules for moving the cursor to the beginning/end of the line, for example:\n\n\n*\n\n*bash (and other shells) use CtrlA and CtrlE\n\n*vi uses 0 and $/Shift4\nOther programs may use other keys. There isn't a universal key combination for positioning the cursor at the beginning/end of the line.\nOf course, Terminal could maintain a list of key combinations for a number of common programs, check what's running and send the correct keys for you, or it could provide a menu item like Move Cursor To Beginning Of Line Inside Shell ⌘← and then send CtrlA behind the scenes. But I guess Apple engineers thought that if you venture in CLI territory you know its idiosyncrasies.\nAs a side note, Terminal provides Option← and Option→ which behaves in bash as you would expect and moves the cursor to the beginning of the previous/next word. That's because these key combinations are mapped to Escb and Escb (see man bash, section \"Commands for Moving\" for more information). In vi, for example, only the latter (kind of) works (at the end of this answer I'll show how to configure vi to work with Option← and Option→).\nBut thanks to Automator, AppleScript and bash aliases you can get ⌘← and ⌘→ to work with bash (and possibly other shells) and vi.\nThe first step is to map ⌘← and ⌘→ to CtrlA and CtrlE. In a second step, I'll show you how to configure vi to honor CtrlA and CtrlE (which, as a result, will make vi compatible with ⌘← and ⌘→).\nMap ⌘← and ⌘→ to CtrlA and CtrlE\n\n\n*\n\n*In Terminal, go to Preferences...>Settings>[your active profile]>Keyboard:\n\n\n*Press +, select \"Cursor Left\", \"Control-Shift\" as modifier and action \"Send Text:\". Then press CtrlA (\\001 will appear in the text field) and confirm with OK:\n\n(In a previous version of this answer I used \"Shift\" as a modifier. I've noticed that this setting conflicts with ⌘shift←, which shows the previous Terminal tab, if you don't let go of ⌘ immediately. Using \"Control-Shift\" fixes that.)\n\n*Now add a key combination for \"Cursor Right\", but  press CtrlE (\\005 will appear in the text field). Confirm with OK.\n\n*Open Automator (for example, hit ⌘space to bring up Spotlight and type Automator), select File>New and choose Service:\n\n\n*Drag Run AppleScript to the right pane:\n\n\n*Type the following script:\non run {input, parameters}\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        tell application process \"Terminal\"\n            key code 123 using {shift down, control down}\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend run\n\nand save as Move Cursor to Beginning of Line:\n\n\n*Repeat steps 4. to 6. with this script:\non run {input, parameters}\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        tell application process \"Terminal\"\n            key code 124 using {shift down, control down}\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend run\n\nand save as Move Cursor to End of Line:\n\n\n*This is what Terminal>Services looks like now:\n\nConfigure vi to honor CtrlA and CtrlE\n\n\n*\n\n*Open .bashrc with your favorite editor and add this line:\nalias vi='vim -c \"map <C-A> 0\" -c \"map <C-E> $\" -c \"map <Esc>b B\" -c \"map <Esc>f E\"'\nThe first two map commands tell vim to interpret ControlE and ControlA as $ and 0, which move the cursor to the beginning or end of line, respectively.\nThe last two map commands tell vim to move the cursor one word at a time as you would expect when pressing option← and Option→.\nCaveats\nYou will notice that there is a short delay between the moment you press ⌘← or ⌘→ and the moment the cursor actually moves. \nBear in mind that it will only work for programs that honor CtrlA/CtrlE, so you may still want to learn the specific key combinations of each program you use in Terminal.\n(Tested on macOS Sierra 10.12.4)\n\nA: Of course its possible.\nFirst of all, you can use the free tool \"DoubleCommand\" if you have a windows keyboard with HOME/END keys to make'em behave like they should (beginning /end of line). \nSecondly, for terminal specifically, go to the preferences, Keyboard, edit the icon/key which looks like an arrow pointing up-left, select \"send text\" and type ctrl+a. Done! \nSame for the end button..\nIf you dont have a PC keyboard, you can do the same with other key combinations.\n", "Q: Install wine via Homebrew: Problem with zlib I've got a problem with my installation of wine.

Let me preface this by saying that I am not looking to set music in the built-in iOS Clock app. I have tried that and I had problems with it. I usually keep all sounds muted, so it won't work. I also tried Alarm Clock HD, which plays music as an alarm but it won't work for me as I needed to be running in the background. I am also using an iPod touch, so bmike's suggestion isn't feasible.\nHere's what I'm looking for: an app that will allow me to a set a song for an alarm and will play that song even if the app is in the background. Alarm Clock HD also had a nice volume feature, which automatically turned up the volume all the way (which is really nice). Is there an iOS app that will do this?\n\nA: As of iOS 8, the native Clock app supports selecting your own music. When selecting a sound, choose \"Pick a song\" at the top. Presto!\n\nA: I use Alarmed and it can have any file in the music library set as an alarm.  Unfortunately I think you have to pay for the \"full\" version ($2 USD) to access that feature, otherwise you have to use the included audio files. It's worth noting that I bought the full version simply because I liked the application so much—it's easily one of the top three most used apps on my iPod Touch.\nIt does behave differently if you leave it running in the background, but it still works for me (iOS 5 and later).\n", "Q: What software is available changing the default maximize button behavior in this video?

You can however hold option while dragging the lower left or right corner of the window and it will proportionally scale the window (down in this case) and reveal the titlebar.\n\nA: The OOTB solution (no extra apps required)\nIf you move the mouse to the right/left edge until you see the horizontal resize icon [↔︎], then dragging vertically will allow moving the window instead of resizing. Same goes for the bottom edge resize cursor [↕︎] + horizontal drag.\nThird-party apps\nBetterTouchTool allows dragging and resizing windows in the linux (KDE) manner, i.e. modifier keys + drag anywhere within the window area to move/resize, which means you'll never again need to do extra work to grab the window edges to arrange your windows.

It can also do things like remapping shortcuts, customise [magic]-mouse gestures, add custom touch-bar actions, etc.\nUpdate: There is a simpler open-source alternative — Hummingbird app (a fork of Easy-Move-Resize).\nYet another option is ShiftIt, a tiny open-source utility which allows positioning and resizing windows using keyboard shortcuts.

A file within ~/Library/Preferences/ is likely associated with this application. To identify the file, go to that directory in Terminal and use the command ls -lt. This lists files sorted by modification time, with recently-modified files at the top. You will likely recognize the associated preference file by name. You can edit the plist file in Xcode, and look for the NSWindow settings to selectively remove them, or simply trash the file. I recommend only modifying or deleting the file while the application is not running.\n\nA: In Terminal, run nano .config/filezilla/filezilla.xml.

Holding down the option and command keys seemed to additionally resize X and Y at the same time.\n\nA: I found the easiest solution was to temporarily increase the screen resolution.\nTo do so, \n\n\n*\n\n*go to System Preferences > Displays > Display\n\n*select Scaled\n\n*select a resolution that is higher than the current one\n\n\nOnce the higher resolution has been switched to, you should be able to reach the title bar of the window in question and move it down to the center of the screen. After that, switch back to the original resolution.\n\nA: Window > Zoom usually works, but not for all applications (TextWrangler, Eclipse, etc). I found an application called Divvy that allows resizing, using which brings the title bar back into the visible space.\nSome googling shows that Slate might be a better option, but I haven't tried it yet\n\nA: While I realize that this is not a solution that's baked into the OS, a 3rd-party window manager may be able to reposition the window on the screen.

I'm looking to turn over some older Apple hardware I have and all of the gear has been upgraded to the latest Mountain Lion using the App Store version of Mountain Lion and my Apple ID.

I see no mention of this on their Canadian store web site.\nI have Snow Leopard DVDs for these machines, but having them running Mountain Lion makes them more attractive resale units.\n\nA: It's not at all clear that Apple will endorse the transference of an App Store account and it's clear they don't endorse transferring parts of the purchase history. Legally, you might be able to get away with this in certain parts of the world, but it's clearly not something Apple is keen to point out how to accomplish this or has built in a \"gift my license\" functionality to their stores at present.\nWhy not include a gift card for the App Store in question or some other cash equivalent with the sale?\n", "Q: Benefit of using MacPorts coreutils instead of stock OS X? I noticed that MacPorts contains lots of software that are already present as part of a stock Mac OS X installation (I am running 10.6.8 Snow Leopard), such as coreutils, tar, etc.\nIs there a benefit to using the MacPorts versions?\n\nA: The obvious benefit is to recompile the tools with optional features that Apple chose to not enable when they compiled the tools. Also, you can get newer options / patches / bug-fixes if you don't mind the duplication and the fact that sometimes you also get new bugs with the newer code as well.\nThe downside is that tools like tar and zip know about Mac OS X metadata that the MacPorts versions probably do not.\n", "Q: How do I duplicate Apple Configurator profiles? I've been working with Apple Configurator in its various versions (now 1.2.1) since its introduction and it is a powerful tool to manage and supervise iPads & other iOS devices.\nOne glaring omission is the inability to duplicate an existing profile in order to make small changes and save as a new profile. Without this function, one must create a new profile and recreate all the settings. With complicated profiles this becomes a tedious and potentially error-prone exercise. One cannot simply export the profile, rename the file in the Finder and re-import: it merely replaces the original because the original profile's name is coded into the XML, and I can't figure out what to change in the XML code to get this working, if that is indeed what must be done.\nThe iPhone Configuration Utility (latest v3.5) has the function I need, but it cannot process new iOS 6 configuration details and strips them out when imported.\nHas anybody figured out how to duplicate profiles?\n\nA: Got it.\nOpen the XML file in TextEdit (or some other XML editor of your choice).\nScroll to the very bottom.\nLook for:\n        PayloadDisplayName\n    Orig Profile\n    PayloadIdentifier\n    orig.profile\nChange these two instances Orig to Dup or some other unique name.\nSave file.\nGo to configurator > import > point to file - it imports as 'dup profile' with all other settings in tact.\n(I suppose you could also make XX copies of the XML file and edit each one, but it is easier just to leave the file open in TextEdit, make a change, save, import, make a change, save, import, lather, rinse, repeat.)\n", "Q: Macbook Air Acting funny My friend gave me a macbook air to try to fix it. I'm pretty good with any Windows machine and the common troubleshooting steps. Like safe mode, malware scanners, startup applications and stuff. But I'm not really sure where to start on this macbook air. It doesn't have the dock on the bottom. Hitting shutdown took like a minute for the prompt to come up. So, it's behaving really slow. And I'm sure there's other things, but what should I do to start troubleshooting?\nAlso, I've noticed the screen go  black for a split second every like 5-10 minutes.\n\nA: First step would be to try a safe boot per Apple's support pages:\n\nIf you're using Mac OS X 10.2 or later, you can start up your computer\n  in Safe Mode, which includes an automatic disk check and repair. A\n  Safe Boot, which starts up your computer into Safe Mode, may allow you\n  to start up your computer successfully using a reduced version of the\n  system software. To do this, follow these steps:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Start up in Safe Mode. Instructions on how to do so are located here.\n  \n*After the system has fully started up, restart your computer normally.\n\nAdditionally, you may reference this page of Apple's support pages for other trouble shooting measures to resolve common startup and performance problems.\n\nA: Your screen going black every 5-10 minutes is a big concern.  That should NOT be happening.\nI think you should reinstall Mac OS X.\nIf you have the install DVDs, just reboot your computer with the DVD attached (you'll need an external CD/DVD drive or you can use Disk Sharing on a iMac or other computer), and press C when booting up.\nWhen you've booted up, you can also erase/format your drive by clicking on Disk Utility in the Menu (top) and clicking on erase (then follow the directions).\nAfter you reinstall the OS, if you still face problems, then it's probably a hardware issue and you should run some hardware tests.\n", "Q: Safari Bookmark That Includes Scroll Position I'd like to create a Safari bookmark that automatically scrolls to a specific position on the page. The page in question is not under my control, and has no in-page anchors. I have a vague notion of something being done via a bit of Javascript saved inside the bookmark, but don't know if even possible, how to implement.\n\nA: Without an anchor in the page, as far as I know a normal bookmark can't do that, but a bookmarklet – i.e. a chunk of JavaScript code – probably can. Whether it's possible depends a bit on what you mean by “a specific position”.\nIf all you want to do is scroll, say, 2000 pixels down the page each time, it would possible to write a bookmarklet using JavaScript's scrollTo function that does that - but bear in mind that the layout (and hence length) of the page may change depending on the size of your browser window, so this may not be too reliable.\nIf it's a particular block of content within the page you want to scroll to, it might be a bit trickier. Provided there's a unique bit of HTML near that point in the page, a bookmarklet could dynamically insert an anchor there once the page is loaded, and then navigate to it.\nThis is probably not the place for detailed advice on writing bookmarklets, however - that's what Stack Overflow is for.\n", "Q: Restore disk in single user mode I wonder if it is possible to restore one partition to another in command line?

There are numerous apps available for jail broken iPhones in the Cydia app store. An example would be vWallpaper. Obviously you would have to jail break your iPhone to utilize a Live Wallpaper app.\n\nA: Unfortunately not. It might be possible if you jailbreak your device, but it's not a feature of stock iOS, and App Store rules prevent third party apps from changing the wallpaper or running in the background, which would be necessary for changing it on a schedule.\n", "Q: Did you have issues using a Microsoft 4000 keyboard with your Mac? When I had a iMac (about 3 years ago), I tried connecting my Microsoft 4000 keyboard to it and I remember that there were some issues with key mappings.\nI do like Mac keyboards, but at times I like the more relaxing feel of my 4000.\nIs it possible to make the keys match 1:1 so there is no difference between which keys I press for each keyboard?\n\nA: The only issues I had (on Lion) were with the Microsoft drivers not retaining their settings between reboots. It seems the drivers were vastly improved (no more kernel panics) since you've tried them; see David Röthlisberger's article.\nOther than that, I think the ergonomic part is well worth the trouble of getting the 4000 set-up properly.

I want to buy a MacBook Pro Retina 15\" and install Windows 7 or 8 (boot camp) to play games.\nObviously games aren't ready for this 2880x1800 resolution, so I hope I can set the games to run at 1440x900 and, since this is 1/4 of the native resolution, have a perfect view (perfect scaling) of the game. This is what I dream about... from this, come some questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible, or am I buying a headache? Should I consider the non-retina display to avoid these resolution problems?\n\n*Are there any other types of problems that I should consider? Something like \"NVidia drivers for Windows in a MacBook generally has this xxx problem...\". \n\n\nA: There are a great many games that support 2880x1800 and most of them support 2560x1600 (Cinema, Dell, and HP 30\" resolutions)\nWindows 7 & 8 don't support the quad-pixel and dual-pixel modes of OSX, they do things a bit differently. You always have the 2880x1800 resolution, and simply select larger font size (150% in my case). \nMost games will work out fine, but some will need some tweaking (mostly selecting the option Disable display scaling on high DPI output on the compatibility tab. \nIf you regularily use an external monitor i would reconsider the retina display. Having upgraded to it from a 17\" i5 I found out the hard way that neither OSX nor Windows can display different DPI to 2 monitors, hence my 30\" Dell is pretty much useless.\n\nA: I have a 15\" MacBook Pro with retina display and use windows 7 in boot camp for a couple games. I have windows set to use larger font and use the 1920 x 1200 resolution for games. I think the graphics look great with this setup. Now they aren't as awesome as civilization 5 on the Mac side running at 2880 x 1800 but they are still quite good.\n\nA: I have windows 8 pro 64 bit on my 15\" rMBP (8gb,256gb).\nI would say windows 8 is beautiful on the computer.\nI play crysis 3, D3, cod bo2, all on high Set at 1920 x 1080 \nplays perfect\n", "Q: Airplay Streaming Video without Apple TV? So I am aware there are various alternatives to Apple TV for receiving Airplay Streams, such as XBMC, AirServer and Reflector.\nThese work to some degree but what I'd really like is a standalone solution, just some software that listens in the background until it receives the stream and then bounces into life. XBMC has too much extra fluff (media center features) and AirServer/Reflection require a license. \nIt seems the above solutions spawned by reverse engineering the Airplay protocol and I imagine Apple aren't too happy about this. \n\nA: Apple is reported to charge hardware license fees for AirPlay support, so I'm pretty certain that they won't let you develop your own for free.\nI've had great experiences with AirServer - it generally works well and it is very actively developed.  The license is pretty inexpensive and it can be installed on several different computers with a single purchase.\n", "Q: Full screen mode in two monitors I have a MBP with an external monitor running ML. When I enter full screen mode, the other monitor isn't usable. Is it possible to have the full screen on one monitor and to use the other monitor as well?\n\nA: It is not possible to use one screen in full screen mode while having an different application on the second screen.\nBut it is also not true that the second screen isn't \"usable\". You can have different windows of the SAME application on the second display (e.g. the equalizer window in iTunes, or the fonts dialog in pages or whatever).\nI would also prefer to have a second application on my second screen, but I mentioned the ability to have at least other windows of the same application just in case that someone didn't knew.\n", "Q: Gmail on iPad not working ..error message I'm seeing this problem all over the web and I'm asking the same thing. I am not very computer savvy and would appreciate an answer that is easy to understand. \nWhen I try to access my Gmail account on my iPad by clicking on the mail icon that came with the device (meaning: I'm not using my browser to access my mail and not using any downloaded apps) I get this message:\nThe mail server \"imap.gmail.com\" is not responding. Verify that you have entered the correct account info in Mail settings. \nAnd I have. And do. Everything is correct. \nThis started to be a problem before the new ios6 update.  And I can access my gmail account on my iPhone just fine.  This problem is just on my iPad 2.\nAlso. I do have another gmail account set up on my iPad and that email works fine. They both have been on my iPad for ever and both been fine until a few weeks ago. Just one account is messed up!  Why? And why hasn't this been fixed? \n\nA: Try a couple things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the problem gmail account from your iPad, and then set it up again.  See if email works.\n\n*If #1 doesn't work, then it could be possible you have too many devices accessing that email account at the same time (ie., iMac/notebooks/etc with the Mail app left open).  Try closing the mail app on your other devices and see if that works.  I believe gmail has a limit of 10 devices that can access the same email account at a given time.  A mail app left open counts as one.\n\n*Lastly, make sure you've inputted the correct password.  You might want to change your password in gmail.com and then re-enter it in your iPad.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: I had this same problem for a while. It went away about the time I applied an iOS update, so I'm wondering if it might have been a bug that Apple squashed? If you're still on iOS6, consider updating.\n\nA: Restart your iphone or mac and try it again. Magic ;)\n", "Q: How can I remove a ding from the edge of the iPhone 5? I dropped my iPhone 5 and it left a dig on the shiny edge of the phone.  I was wondering what they best way to try to remove the ding would be.\nShould I sand paper it with fine grain?  But I'm afraid it'll scratch it up more.\nI could sand it with fine sandpaper, and then use a black sharpie to cover it up.  (I have a black iPhone 5.)\n\nA: You will make it worse, especially if its the black model. Just live with it. \n", "Q: Facebook notifications do not open a browser window when clicked I am correctly getting notifications from Facebook in Mountain Lion's notification center, but when I click them expecting to be brought into the browser (Chrome is my default browser) to see the subject of the notification, nothing happens.\nInstead, the notification just disappears from the notification center and I'm left there with no clue about what happened.\nIs this normal behavior? If not, what should I do to correct it? I have also tried to change the default browser to Firefox but the result was the same.\n\nA: I'm also having troubles with the native Facebook alerts.\nThey just don't work as advertised, that's why I was searching in the web and found this article http://lifehacker.com/5943851/glow-for-fb-stuffs-unobtrusive-facebook-notifications-in-your-menu-bar\nThat app did it for me :) you click the Notification Center popups and you'll be redirected to the corresponding subject, e.g. the photo, a comment or a message thread.\n\nA: I had the same issue on Mavericks, maybe because of the upgrade from Mountain Lion to Mavericks. \nI solved this issue through deleting my Facebook Account from the internet accounts under Settings, restarting and then adding the Facebook account again.\n", "Q: How can I download book from Kindle app to Kindle Volume? How can I pass content I've bought on Amazon to my Amazon Kindle (Paperwhite)? Because it turned out that it is not that easy. Actually, it is really hard.\nWhat I've tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shared Wi-Fi from iMac, but Kindle says that \"Peer-to-peer networks are not supported by Kindle\". Fail.\n\n*Installed Kindle for Mac app, tried to find something like download to device. Fail.\n\n*Installed \"Send to Kindle app\" and realised that it solves completely different task.\n\n*Found path where Kindle for Mac stores downloaded books, copied files to Kindle's Volume document folder. These books are seen but Kindle refuses to open any of them claiming they are not mine.\n\n*Downloading to my good old Kindle DX, trying to copy to Paperwhite. The same shit as in previous attempt.\n\n\nMy MacOS is 10.8.2 if that helps. \nI'll appreciate any kind of advice. Whole this situation is making me annoyed. I mean, it is my content, I've bought it.\n\nA: I would use a different book manager on your mac. I would install something like Calibre to manage your e-books.\nCalibre is very flexible and there are plug-ins which allow you to remove DRM. This then allows you to share your content across devices without having to have the device registered with Amazon.\nI would then download your purchased e-books from Amazon using the \"transfer via USB\" option. You only need to have one device registered with Amazon for this method to work.  However if you have your paperwhite registered you can also do the transfer via USB with DRM in tact, as stated in the other answer.\nWhen you import them into Calibre the DRM is removed and you can then move the books via USB to any device you want.\n\nA: If you've purchased content (i.e., ebooks on Amazon) then all you need to do is register your Kindle paperwhite on the kindle website, http://kindle.amazon.com .\nAfter you've registered your device, you can go into Cloud section on your device and see all your past purchases.  They will all be available for download.\n", "Q: Macbook air taking long to boot up (Over 4 minutes) My macbook air start up is acting weird. \n\n\n*\n\n*I press start button, \n\n*I hear the apple sound and a blank grey screen appears\n\n*Then the apple logo shows on the grey screen with a loading circle below it. \n\n*Then a blue screen appears\n\n*and then the grey screen appears with the loading circle (the loading circle doesn't spin though. \n\n*Then the mouse appears on the grey screen\n\n*then the blue screen comes up\n\n*and then the login box with the desktop image.\n\n\nA: A typical issue causing long boot times is a faulty or missing selection of the startup disk. Go to System preferences > Startup Disk and make sure your Startup Volume is selected there.\nAnother thing which definetly helps to improve startup times on my MBP is running Onyx from time to time and have it rebuilt system caches, etc. (see tab \"Automation\"). Make sure to backup first.\n\nA: Boot up taking 4 minutes is way too long.\n\n\n*\n\n*I'd suggest you upgrade your OS if you haven't already.  Sometimes just upgrading your OS will fix a lot of problems.  Mountain Lion is $20 or so in the Mac Appstore.  Try this first.\n\n*If you don't want to upgrade your OS, you can try to reinstall your OS using the factory install DVDs.  Since you have a Macbook Air, you'll need an external drive or use disk sharing.\n\n*If you don't want to do #2 and #3, you could try doing a hardware test.  See http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1509?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US .\nHope this helps!\n\nA: Two appearances of a blue screen indicates user level issues. You should only pass to the blue screen when the system is fully booted and ready to hand off to the user start part of the process.\nYou can troubleshoot this with three small changes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable automatic user log in to separate the user from the system.\n\n*Open Startup Disk system preference and ensure the correct drive is selected to boot.\n\n*Power down the Mac and then boot in safe mode once to rebuild a few databases that could be causing the corruption or slow boot process.\n\n\nOnce you start into safe mode, log in or not, but shut the Mac down cleanly and then re-test the startup sequence. Should the symptoms change or nothing change - you will have isolated the issue and eliminated three likely potential causes to a slow reboot that eventually works, but is troublesome from a speed consideration.\nAlso - you might start with step 0 - make a good full backup of the system before investigating further since if the hard drive is beginning to fail - you'd rather have a good backup before you try fixing things in case the time left to run before failure is small.\n", "Q: How to retrieve data from my old Apple ID? I want to retrieve data from my old Apple ID. I have signed in my iPhone with my old Apple ID, but iTunes displays an error:\n\n\"We cannot complete your iTunes store request. An unknown error occured (0x800B0101)\"\n\"There was a error in the itunes store. Please try again later\"\n\nI have tried this many times only to get the same results.\n\nA: First try changing your iTunes account password via your computer.\nThen try logging in again.\nIf that doesn't work, then try changing the date on your phone temporarily. Go to Settings > General > Date and Time > Set Automatically > Off. Set the date one year ahead. Then try and see if it accepts your password. \nIf you still can't sign in, contact Apple Store Customer Service at 1-800-676-2775.\n", "Q: Hardware virtualization is not supported on MacBookPro 2010 I have a MacBook Pro 2010 where I've installed Windows8 using Bootcamp. When I install Visual Studio 2012 with WindowsPhone8 SDK, it says me that my hardware does not support hardware virtualization, so that the emulator cannot be used.\nIs that true?

What can I do to search for a multi-word expression such as \"little bug\" in Preview? I want to return only words together and in that order. My first reflex was to try double quotes, but it looks like Preview is searching for them instead of ignoring them. Some googling turned up this question where someone mentions the double quoting working as of 2010. I'm running 10.7.5 and Preview 5.5. Is this a relatively new \"bug\" in Preview? I find it weird that I haven't noticed it before...\n\nA: Well, of course, it was a problem with me. The search results only appear after having typed the whole query and pressed enter, which is a different behavior than the single word search where the results are updated as you type.\nSomebody had a similar problem here.\n", "Q: How to quickly remove all useless iOS applications on my Mac? I have 900 apps on my Mac because I sync both my iPhone and iPad. \nThere are a lot of apps that I deleted a long time ago which are useless. I have amassed 40gb of apps.\nIs there a quick way to delete all the useless apps?\n\nA: You could right click on any app in iTunes Apps section, click Show in Finder, then sort by Date Modified and erase all those that haven't been updated in a long time and that you don't use. Be careful because one of your preferred app might not have been updated recently.\n", "Q: How can I manually force a file of a Fusion Drive to the SSD? From what I understand, the implementation of the Fusion Drive is at the OS level (coreStorage). Yet, I want to know if it's possible to manually interfere in the management for a specific file or directory.\nE.g. Most Photos in iPhoto are rarely used, yet I would like to push the entire directory ~/Pictures/iPhoto Library.photolibrary to the SSD.\n\nA: I am aware this may not be the technical answer you seek, but it's the pragmatic solution at present. Hopefully, a non-buggy way to micro manage the tiered storage will become known, but here are things you can do today, out of the box. \n\n\n*\n\n*ensure all data fits on the SSD so that no tiering takes place. \n\n*manually access these files to ensure the algorithm sees them as being read more than the rest. Using dd to read the files would be a good start and rebuilding the iPhoto library databases should also force a full read of the contents. It's not clear reads only will affect tiering in a \"mandatory promotion to SSD storage\" sense. \n\n\nA: I don't think so.\nI put together a Fusion Drive as an experiment to see if was preferable to using a pure SSD vs. a high speed drive, and the trade offs, namely size vs. performance.\nWith my Fusion, the SSD was on the inside of the unit and I was using a Firewire external drive. The nice thing was that when the Firewire's drive activity light flashed, I knew it was being accessed. We have a program that generates a cacheing file, and periodically it changes. Here's what happened:\n\n\n*\n\n*When the program starts, it creates the cache file and then starts hitting it at about 1 second intervals.\n\n*Initially, the Firewire, which was of course the HD part of the Fusion, would show no activity, which told me it was hitting the SSD.\n\n*After a few seconds, the Fusion seemed to transfer the file to the Firewire drive, and then it would start flashing at the same intervals. This told me the Fusion had off loaded the file from the SSD to the hard drive.\n\n*When the file changed, steps 1 through 3 would repeat.\n\n\nThe cache file wasn't big, but what was clear to me that the Fusion drive management was following Apple's proprietary algorithms, which, to the best of my knowledge, aren't known. That was done some time ago, right after Fusions and the ability to make them became known, so who knows if it even works that way.\nIf you want to control where the data goes, you might want to create a boot and system drive with the SSD then offload slower stuff that doesn't need to get hit that much to the hard drive and link them to the OS via symbolic links. This way you can control where stuff goes, what gets backed up and when, and if one of the units fails you'll know where and what data got lost. As-is, with a Fusion drive you can't tell at a given instant what's on which drive. I know what I'm describing is a two drive setup, but you may find it's generally faster than a Fusion drive as well.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: The script that Howard posted can be used to periodically copy a file to /dev/zero.  If you put in an automator task or cron job that calls this script for the files you want cached it will most likely trick the OS into putting the files onto the SSD portion.\nAnother option if you want to pin an app to the SSD is to open and close the program in the background using automator and not just read the app file itself.  This will ensure associated libraries / config files will also be put on the SSD.\n\nA: Try the following script\n#!/bin/bash\necho $1\n\ndd if=\"$1\" of=/dev/zero bs=1m\n\n", "Q: How can I use command+tab to switch between windows of the same app in addition to all the other apps? \nPossible Duplicate:\nBest app to switch between all open windows (alternatives to Witch) \n\nI would like to see all the windows, including from the same app, when I switch between them (command+tab). See an example from Ubuntu (image attached).\nI know this may raise an issue of distinguishing between the same app windows. For that, there is a solution - a preview and the title of the window - see Ubuntu's static switcher (image attached).\nI know the preview feature (F3 or fn+F3) but I can't continue choosing the right app using the keyboard and it's way slower than command+tab.\nThanks.\n\n\nA: What you are trying to achieve is not provided by OS X and I don't know if a third-party application would be able to interfere this deeply in the window management.\nYou have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*(⇧ +) ⌘+→ to switch between apps\n\n*(⇧ +) ⌘+` to switch between windows of one app in one desktop\n\n\nOption two is configurable in System Preferences → Keyboard → Keyboard & Text Input → Move focus to next Window.\nYou can still achieve something similar to what you have in Ubuntu by using Mission Control and not choosing the option Group windows by applications in: System Preferences → Mission Control → Group windows by applications\nThen define a gesture to use initiate Mission Control for all individual Windows in: \nSystem Preferences → Trackpad → More Gestures → Mission Control\nNote that there is also an option for App Exposé which is like Mission Control for just one application.\n", "Q: How can I restore an app on my iPad if it isn't available in the Store anymore? I was using ios version 4 till yesterday, and I just upgraded the version. Some apps which I purchased before cannot be found in the app store or in the itunes purchases section.\nwhat is to be done??\n\nA: If you had your iPad in sync with your computer, the app should still be in the \"Apps\" section of iTunes, available for you to synchronize with your restored iPad.\nAlternatively, on your computer, select \"iTunes Store\", and from the \"Quick Links\" section on the upper-right hand side, select \"Purchased\", and then \"Apps\" (and then \"iPad\").  Some removed apps are still available for re-downloaded from that area.\n\nA: Apps fall into four categories:\n\n\n*\n\n*The version you had is still live on the App Store for purchase and re-download.\n\n*The version you had is replaced by a newer version.\n\n*The version you had is withdrawn from new sales, but available for re-download.\n\n*The version is entirely removed from the store.\n\n\nAs written, it looks like the app you have in mind is in the last category. Your only hope there is to restore a backup copy from iTunes and sync that app over WiFi (if your iOS is new enough) or over USB cable.\nAs to the status of an app in my list above, the developer has total control over their desires to place, update or withdraw an app partially or totally. Of course Apple reviews these requests and can broker / take action above and beyond the developer.\nIf you fall into the last category where the app truly is not available, you have several options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Contact the developer and see if they can or will sell you the app through Apple's B2B store. That store operates under the same review, but both buyer and seller need to submit to extra steps other than making an Apple ID.\n\n*Contact the developer and get a binary that you could then sign and distribute yourself as an Apple iOS developer or Apple Enterprise Developer.\n\n*Jailbreak your device and/or crack the code signing so that you can run a copy of that app (here you'll need a backup copy or a source of the app from someone else).\n\n", "Q: Problem with corrupt .rar file I have a big file compressed in split .rar archives. There are 68 archives named .rar, .r01, .r02, etc., annd the problem is that .r36 is corrupted resulting in an Unexpected end of archive. I've looked around and I have found nothing.\nThere is no way to repair the file.\nAnd now my question is if it's possible to skip the file. I mean, extract all files except the .r36. The result should be a big file with a small part of it corrupted, but it doesn't matter.\nIs that possible - to skip a file from extraction? Because my main problem is that all the apps I've tried stop the task when they find the error.\n\nA: If your archive comes with recovery files(.rev) you can regenerate missing or broken parts. \nI use command line version of rar for this.\nJust execute this command: rar e archive-name.r01. This will extract from all the parts and rebuild the broken ones.\nInstead if you don't have rev files you can't do nothing.

I have eight email accounts set up in Mail.app. Some of my SMTP servers support SSL and some don't. But now Mail.app turned SSL on for every server (except the one using a custom port) and it won't let me turn it off. When I uncheck \"Use Secure Sockets Layer\" in the Advanced settings, it just automatically rechecks itself. How can I get it to go off and stay off?\n\nA: I figured out a workaround. I took the clue from my account that uses a custom port. For the accounts in which SSL doesn't work, I checked \"Use custom port\" and tried each of the standard port numbers until I found one that worked. With the custom port selected I can successfully disable SSL.\n", "Q: What options do we have to keeping our hard drive secure in case of theft?

I don't want the iPhone activated. I have wifi in my house and I just want her to be able to play games on it. Is it possible?\n\nA: No - if the device is waiting at the activate screen it won't run normally. Yes - once the activation is done, you can pull the SIM card. \nActivate means that the OS becomes usable. Unless (and until) your phone gets jail broken or authorized unlocked (contact your carrier), by design you need a carrier SIM to activate the phone after each restore. \nMajor OS upgrades usually include a restore / activation step so you can check here before the next upgrade if you wish to avoid this in the future. \nI've had good luck using an old SIM card that no longer is on an account to keep a proper SIM in the phone. Again, your carrier can help if reusing any old SIM you have doesn't work. \n\nA: Yes your phone will work normally just no calls even can still get messages I'm still using mine, without one at home via wifi\n", "Q: Force hibernate (deep sleep) in OSX 10.8(.2) How can you force the computer (in this case a laptop [rMBP]) into the \"hibernate\" state where it writes the RAM to the HDD/SSD so that the battery can last for the advertised 30 days.\nI know that this can be achieved by waiting 70 minutes (4200 secs) after it is in sleep mode (if you haven't adjusted the default time settings), but is there a way to force it into this state?\nI am having wake problems, and want to test this state of waking from.\n\nA: I don't know if it's equivalent to the deep sleep mode, but sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 25 makes computers hibernate immediately when going to sleep.\n\nhibernatemode = 3 (binary 0011) by default on supported portables.

The disc can be heard spinning up, and the grey Apple logo appears. However, the computer hangs at that step, there was no grey spinning wheel and the installer never starts. After a few minutes, I can hear the disc SPIN DOWN, and the machine still sits at the Apple logo after more than 40 minutes.\nTo boot from the install disc, I also tried (1) holding down the Alt key during boot to choose the disc, and (2) using System Preferences to set the disc as the startup disc. However, the boot still hangs at the grey Apple logo.\nTo diagnose the problem, I tried other startup discs, including my retail Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard install disc.

Anything older, including the standard build of 10.6.3, won't have drivers/config info/etc for that model, and hence cannot boot it. It sounds like your retail disk has an older version, so it won't work on that Mac.\nIf you have the installer DVD that came with the computer, you can use that. Otherwise, if you have another (older) Mac with FireWire, there's a trick you can use: start your computer with the T key held down, and it'll go into target disk mode, which essentially means it turns its brain off and acts as an external FireWire hard disk. Connect it (via FireWire) to an older Mac, start the older Mac from your retail 10.6 DVD, and have it install onto the \"external disk\" -- the MBP. Then, restart the old Mac from the \"external disk\" (the MBP should still be in target mode at this point), and update to 10.6.8. Now that the OS on the MBP's disk is new enough to support it, shut everything down (older Mac, then the MBP) and restart everything from its regular disk.\n", "Q: How do I find what packages I've installed via terminal? I've been learning the shell for a few weeks and have installed several packages. I know/remember what some of them are, like oh-my-zsh and emacs 24 (which was a nightmare to upgrade to), but not sure sure about what else. I've used different methods like curl, wget and Macports.\nMy question is, if and when I want to do a clean installation of MacOS, how do I backup or script a fresh installation of these packages? In other words, when I do a new install of MacOS I won't be restoring from Time Machine using Migration Assistant: rather I'll install the system and manually restore files. How do I know the installation paths and dependancies of what I've installed in my previous installation using the command line? Is there a txt file somewhere that the system maintains to keep track of what has been installed?\n(MacOS 10.8.2)\n\nA: Since OS X has no package manager, anything you install would have been manual, through MacPorts or through Installer.\nIf you want a list of the binaries your terminal has access to, you can run the following commands to check the most common spots, and output the result as a text file:\ntouch ~/Binaries.txt\nls /usr/bin > ~/Binaries.txt\nls /usr/sbin >> ~/Binaries.txt\nls /usr/local/bin >> ~/Binaries.txt\nls /usr/local/sbin >> ~/Binaries.txt\nls /opt/local/bin >> ~/Binaries.txt\nls /opt/local/sbin >> ~/Binaries.txt\n\nAlternatively, if you just want to get the packages installed by MacPorts, run the following (this is probably the one you want):\ntouch ~/MacPorts.txt\nport installed > ~/MacPorts.txt\n\nAnd for Homebrew:\ntouch ~/HomeBrew.txt\nbrew list > ~/HomeBrew.txt\n\nAnd finally, for all packages installed by Installer\ntouch ~/InstalledPackages.txt\npkgutil --packages > ~/InstalledPackages.txt\n\nTo restore, for example, your MacPorts ports from the list generated above, use the following:\n port install $(cat ~/MacPorts.txt)\n\n\nA: List ports that you've installed:\nport echo requested > ports.txt\n\nTo later install the latest versions of those ports on a new system\nsudo port install $(cut -f1 -d\\  ports.txt | uniq)\n\nSee also\nport help echo\n\n", "Q: Turn on iTunes EQ via AppleScript Can I turn the iTunes EQ on/off using AppleScript?\nI found a way to change the preset, but not turn the EQ on or off.\n\nA: Here's an iTunes Equalizer ON-OFF Script that toggles, so you can turn on/off just with the call of one script\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n    if EQ enabled is false then\n        set EQ enabled to true\n    else if EQ enabled is true then\n        set EQ enabled to false\n    end if\nend tell\n\n", "Q: Mac Mountain Lion on screen keyboard Is there a way that, when you switch language inputs for your keyboard, the onscreen keyboard will automatically show up?\n\nA: I asume you want to show an onscreen keyboard when changing your keyboard layout. One obvious approach is to use AppleScript, and that is what I've done here. I think this approach is not error prone, but it works.\nAt first, in the Systems preferences select the keyboards you want to use, and make sure you tick 'Show Input in menu bar'\n\nThen check if your languages are available in the 'Input menu' in the top right corner of your menu-bar.\n\nSo, now the keyboards are available from the menubar. We can use applescript to invoke with the menubar and start your onscreen keyboard.\n(* A function to change the language and activate the keyboard app *)\non changeKeyboardLayout(layoutName)\n    (* Close the current language keyboard app *)\n    tell application \"KeyboardViewer\"\n        quit\n    end tell\n    (* Change the keyboard layout *)\n    tell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"SystemUIServer\"\n        tell (menu bar item 1 of menu bar 1 where description is \"text input\")\n            click\n            click menu item layoutName of menu 1\n        end tell\n    end tell\n    (* Open the new language keyboard app *)\n    tell application \"KeyboardViewer\"\n        activate\n    end tell\nend changeKeyboardLayout\n\n(* Call the function with the keyboard name as variable *)\nchangeKeyboardLayout(\"U.S. Extended\")\n(* changeKeyboardLayout(\"Canadian English\") *)\n(* changeKeyboardLayout(\"U.S.\") *)\n\nYou can use Automator to make an Application or a Service of this AppleScript and and even attach a keystroke to it.\n", "Q: How to identify CPU and memory usage per process on iPhone? There are many common apps available to show total system RAM usage and free.  However, my understanding is only a jailbroken phone has access to the APIs to access PER PROCESS memory usage on iOS.  How can one do this most effectively?\nThis link has a few example tools but they all seem outdated and no information if they work on iOS 5 & iOS 6. http://www.ifans.com/forums/threads/troubleshooting-memory-issues.142660/\n\nA: Xcode has an app called Instruments and you can use it to gather all sorts of CPU and memory statistics both live as the device runs and to save for analysis over time. This use of the tool doesn't require a developer account, any paid software, or a jailbroken device. You do need to set up the devices in Xcode's organizer to indicate you wish to use them for development and connect them via USB - just cancel out of any requests to manage certificates or developer profiles as you add each device to Xcode's organizer.\n\nAbove is a one click, capture and you can dive as deep as I could imagine anyone needs by selecting extra data to be sampled and displayed...\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to add Adobe PDF as a printer in Lion? I want to add Adobe PDF as a printer in Lion. \nI know how to use the \"pdf\" button in the print dialog, but that unfortunately won't work for the task I have in mind. \nDoes anyone know how to this? \nI'm an Adobe Creative Cloud subscriber so have access to the latest version of Acrobat.\nAlternatively, does anyone know if its possible to add a different, not-necessarily-Adobe PDF printer?\n\nA: After installing Acrobat, there should be an Adobe PDF entry in the list of printers (System Settings -> Printers).\nAlternatively, you can try CUPS-PDF \n\nA: It is not possible in Snow Leopard or later.\nFrom Adobe's support site:\n\nThe Adobe PDF Printer is not available or is unusable in Mac OS X Snow Leopard (v10.6). This situation is due to security features in Snow Leopard that disable the Adobe PDF Printer. Adobe Acrobat 9.1 Pro removes the Adobe PDF Printer and adds a new Save As Adobe PDF command. \n\n", "Q: Why is my icloud backup taking so long? I just created an icloud account and i am backing it up and it says it will take 3 hours.  I have no pictures on my phone so i think its just backing up contacts, reminders, etc.  Does anyone know why it would take this long?  Is there something that i could be configured incorrectly?  Any advice would be great.\n\nA: iCloud backups the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Photos and videos in the Camera Roll\n\n*Device settings (for example: Phone Favorites, Wallpaper, and Mail, Contacts, Calendar accounts)\n\n*App data\n\n*Home screen and app organization\n\n*Messages (iMessage, SMS, and MMS)\n\n*Ringtones\n\n*Visual Voicemails\n\n\nIt might be due to your app data size and also if this is the first time backing up then it will take a bit longer. Have a look at this link, it will explain why else it might  take longer.\n", "Q: Can I partition an iPod (nano, classic, shuffle) for use as a flash drive? I have made an iPod nano appear as a flash drive by going to iTunes and checking \"Enable disk use.\" However, I am short of a large enough USB key to hold a bootable Windows 8 installer for use by Boot Camp. Because Boot Camp needs to wipe the drive used, can I create a partition in Disk Utility of the iPod and install to that? \nDoes iPod still work after  creating a new partition for use as a flash disk?\n\nA: It can be done, but truthfully i would just spend the $15 on an 8gb USB drive. \nAnyway, one way of doing it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot ipod by pressing menu and center button for 5 secs.\n\n*Before apple logo appears (ie: do it fast) press play/pause and center for 2 secs\n\n*a green checkmark should appear on the screen. It is now in flash disk mode. Connect it to the mac \n\n*Go to disk utility and format it for Fat-32 (or ntfs) \n\n*Use it to install windows.\n\n*after you are done, start up itunes and Restore it. \n\n\nOBVIOUSLY you will lose everything in the ipod. So after restore copy all the music back.\nYou might be able to skip the first 3 steps and format it straight away, depending on your h/w version it might work, so check that first. \n", "Q: Keyboard equivalents to up/down arrows? In Chrome, where the autofill list can be shown with two down-arrow keystrokes, or with clicking the mouse once.\nI'd like to be able to open the Chrome autofill list with some other keystroke rather than having than having to shift my hand over to the arrow keys or the mouse.\nAre there any keyboard equivalents to the up/down arrow keys?\nPerhaps something like ctrl+j or ctrl+k?\n\nA: I doubt it, but if you are sufficiently motivated, you might be able to use ukelele to create your own keyboard layout with arrow key equivalents on them. However, note the following caveat from the ukelele manual:\n\nThere are some limitations imposed by Apple:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Mapping the arrow keys to something else, or other keys to arrow keys, is problematic. It will work in some applications, but not others.\n  \n\nSuddenly, this seems like a much less attractive option.\n", "Q: Apple Aperture Tutorial I am looking for a good Aperture tutorial and would appreciate some recommendations.\nWhich tutorials can you recommend?\n\nA: You could start with Apple's free training videos at Aperture 3 video tutorials. Also see the list of Aperture training resources and general Aperture resources (including downloads, extras and training).\nThere are other paid video tutorials from VTC, Lynda, Kelby Training, etc.\n", "Q: New iPhone 4S using 10 times faster battery than old 4, why? iPhone 4S and iPhone 4 have the same settings but the new iPhone 4S uses 10 times more battery in standby than old iPhone 4. Why?\n\nA: It can be for a variety of reasons these include:\n• Location Services in regular use, like Siri geofencing in reminders or a GPS app using it a lot. Check Settings > Privacy > Location services (in iOS 6) to see what's using it.\n• A mail account that's not set up properly or had stopped working correctly from a restored back up, for example the outgoing mail server password not being entered on an IMAP or Exchnage account.\n• Push mail being switched on. Settings > Mail > Fetch, to see how it's set up. \n• An app that's misbehaving and using a lot of CPU time (you may notice the phone warm up a little). Check your logs in Settings > General > About > Diags and usage > Diags and usage data, for anything unusual. Also check Settings > Usage - Time Since Last Full Charge to see if the time used makes sense, have you been using the phone for as long as it says? If the Standby time and in Use time are the same then something is running in the background. \n• Using the phone in a poor reception area will dramatically lower battery life, even in its on standby. \n• A corrupt restore from back up.\nThings to do to try and resolve the issue:\n• Power cycle the phone\n• Reset user preferences. Settings > General > Reset > Reset all Settings. \n• Restore phone in iTunes and set up as new. (Most invasive option, but will sort the issue). \n", "Q: Safari doesn't show titles for click throughs on google search results… Sometime recently -- maybe in the last month or so -- a glitch came up with Google and Safari 6. I don't know if it happened when I upgraded to Safari 6 or if it's the result of encrypted search results on Google.\n\nAs you can see here, when I search for something on Google, the history show that search. But when I click on a result, the history shows a crazy Google URL and does not show the title of the site that I went to, which makes it impossible to go back to something I was looking at earlier without randomly trying a bunch of different search results.\nAny idea why this is happening, and how I can disable it? This is relatively new behavior. Between this and the new web inspector, I can't stand Safari anymore.\n\nA: You can use the Detox extension for Safari and Chrome, which fixes this on Google and Twitter.\nThis happens because Google switched to a client-side redirect for their tracking links (in JavaScript, I think) so the browser thinks the tracking page is the page you wanted. I'm not sure why. Twitter does the same thing, but it's so that they can grab the referer when you click on a t.co link from a client or another website.\n", "Q: How do you automatically separate Camera photos from Safari photos? I don't like how images downloaded from Safari and photos taken from Camera app are both dumped into the \"Camera Roll\" folder in Photos app. How do I configure my phone to automatically segregate the two types of images for better organization? \n\nA: As answered before, you cannot do that from the Camera app or Safari. But a workaround could be to use another camera-app ie \"Camera+\" which costs 1 or 2$. \nDownload Camera+, choose Menu, choose Autosave, choose Lightbox (Camera+'s own cameraroll). \nThen you save new pics to Lightbox - and you must export them from that of cos. \n", "Q: Can I make iPhone 5 screen shots without an iPhone to test with? Given an html5 application that I have access to, Is there a way to get a screen shot of how it would look on the iPhone 5.\nI do not have an iPhone 5, so is this possible? \n\nA: Sure - you can use a Mac for this.\nDownload Xcode and fire up the iOS Simulator and choose to emulate the iPhone 5. You will have a version of Mobile Safari that runs on OS X and will let you save screen shots of your app. Much of this is documented well by the PhoneGap steps listed for developing an iOS app.\n\nHere I'm using skitch to grab a screen capture and I have reduced the size a bit to upload, but as long as your screen is large enough, you can capture a pixel perfect image easily. In this case, I was using Safari in the simulator and you'll need to follow the steps listed in the phonegap documentation to install Apache Cordoba so that your phonegap code can be seen by Xcode to push it over into the iOS simulator when you press Run in Xcode.\n \nImage above from docs.phonegap.com\n", "Q: iTunes grayed-out menu I know this is not a new problem, but I haven't seen a solution to it so I figured I'd go ahead and see if anyone has come across a solution here:\nSometimes iTunes grays out menu bar options such as Quit iTunes and Add to Library. I never noticed any pattern about when this happens, but I've read that others experience it after editing tracks in their libraries. I've also checked for open dialog boxes somewhere, but I don't have any of those.\nAnyone know why this is still happening (years after I first saw this), and if there is any solution yet? I am on OS X 10.7.5 and running whatever version of iTunes is the latest that is available via Software Update (the About iTunes option is grayed out as well so I can't check that right now). Any ideas would be much appreciated -- thanks!\n\nA: One year later, this is happening to me as well. I'm on 10.8.5 and iTunes 11. I have used iTunes since it's inception and don't think I've had this problem until iTunes 11.\nMost menu items are greyed out, like Quit and Preferences, but some work, like new Playlist and most items under the File menu. Otherwise iTunes still works, but to quit, I have to force quit or close down the Mac altogether. I see no open dialog boxes anywhere.\n\nA: Sadly, several Apple programs seem to do some cleanup that can get hung after you tell the program to quit. Mail and iTunes seems to be several I've dealt with on multiple occasions with multiple versions of the OS.\nIn each case, force quitting the application is the only practical response.\n\n\n*\n\n*OS X: How to quit an unresponsive application using Force Quit - http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3411\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose force quit from the Apple Menu\n\n*Select and quit iTunes\n\n\n\nShould you run into this on an ongoing basis, you'll need to try rebuilding the database file for iTunes or restore it from a backup before the issue started. \n\nA: If you go to Preferences → Advanced → Reset warnings. It fixed the problem for me on a Mac.\n", "Q: What safety precautions are needed when working on an iMac G3 with a CRT? I have an iMac G3 that I'm planning on playing around with but need advice on handling the CRT and how to make sure I don't kill myself.\nI have read quite a lot about discharging the CRT and the one thing I'm not sure about is how to make sure that when discharging you have the tool properly grounded.\nDo you keep the computer plugged into the mains, but with it off, so the earth connection is still attached and thus used when discharging.\nWhere is the ground lug, which seems to be referenced in a few resources, such as this one, as I want to ensure I'm connected to the correct bit, so I don't become the ground.\nWill wearing electricians gloves (or gloves suitable for handling high voltage) help protect me when doing this, or will they end up being cumbersome and give a false sense of protection?\nIs it a good or bad idea to wear rubber soled shoes, will this also help insulate me, or again give a false sense of protection?\nI guess the more precautions the better, but just trying to figure out what's actually helpful and what's not.\n\nA: I can verify that the advise in that article is correct. I have discharged and serviced CRT Macs. \nI personally am not going to give you any safety advise as it is a potentially dangerous process and should not be undertaken if not confident. I would avoid servicing these machines especially if you do not have access to the official service manual. \n\nA: The link to safety precautions is very high quality and I can't find anything wrong with what it says.\nAs to going into a Mac with a CRT, if you are not sure you have a good ground, hire an electrician to ensure your path to ground can take an CRT discharge voltage and current safely before proceeding.\nMany trade schools offer electrical safety classes to the public, so look for one and make sure someone trained is there to observe you from a safe distance the first time you attempt a CRT discharge.\nThe good news is a CRT capacitor has one good shock in it if you are not connected to the mains while working on it, so the person observing only needs a cell phone to call for medical attention if you get shocked. If you are going to mess around with it connected to the mains, give them a wooden pole long enough to knock you away from the device or to dislodge the power if things go badly.\nThe bad news is this shock isn't one you want to have cross your body and hit your heart since you don't need much current to cause death and the high voltage that can be contained inside a CRT makes it likely the current will jump to ground if offered the chance. You want to do all you can to ensure that your body is a worse path to ground than your grounding device.\nI would find someone who has done this before as a TV repair tech or a computer tech and not try to learn this yourself. Even when you are trained, never work on these alone.\n", "Q: iPad 4 cannot connect to internet using iMac wireless Have latest iPad 4 and latest iMac with OS Lion and have a wireless connection. iMac system preferences checked for internet sharing ethernet to wireless device.

How would I be able to set this up on an iMac, if at all possible?\n\nA: The operating system supports multi screens. For the iMac i would say that a DisplayLink adapter would allow you to connect additional screens via USB. I've never used it, so I have no idea what the maximum resolution is, but I read several times on different boards that this solution has been successfully used.  \nUpdate: As gabesubdo mentioned in a comment below, it is not necessary to use a DisplayLink if your iMac has one or more Thunderbolt ports, which can be used as Mini Displayports as well. Apple provides adapters for Mini Displayports (to HDMI, VGA, ...)\n", "Q: How can I disable the Option+click hiding behaviour? In Mac OS X Mountain Lion at least, if you Option+click ( Alt+click ) on another a window of another app, this will make the other application to gain focus, and the current app to be hidden as if you'd pressed Command+H.\nIs there any way to disable this behaviour? Perhaps with some defaults write like command entered in a terminal?\nI'd like to use Option+click for some different behaviour (moving windows by Option+clicking anywhere on them, using a third-party tool, Zoom2), and having Option+click trigger the hiding behaviour instead is very inconvenient.\n\nA: As far as I know there is no way to disable this behavior. You can command-click to manipulate any window in the background without focusing it or bringing it to the front. (This has been around since classic Mac OS.) You can indeed combine commandalt to alt-click a window item in the background without triggering the application hiding.\n\nA: One option would be to remap Option+Left Click to something else using KeyRemap4MacBook.  It might not have exactly what you want, but I think it's not hard to add new shortcuts (or ask the author to add them for you).  One option that I saw was Option+Left Click -> Middle Click.  You could then (assumedly) set middle click to do what you want in Zoom2, and retain the Option+Click shortcut.  \nOf course, if you do this, it will change Option+Click everywhere, even if you aren't clicking on another window.\n", "Q: Apple ID/ Password Problems Every time my family and I try to download an app, the AppStore pops up saying my Apple ID or password is incorrect. So the first time I reset the password. It happened again and I did reset it a second time. The third time I wrote down the password, so I knew it was right. But AppStore still doesn't accept my Apple ID or password. I've changed it about 5 times now. What do I do?\n\nA: If you don't want to try one more time to reset the password, you might need to contact Apple's support to have them reset your account.\nIt's entirely possible that the account is either locked or someone else is trying to reset the password (or far more likely another device you have stored the old password keeps repeatedly trying to enter that old password and is causing the account to get locked.)\nYou can try logging into https://appleid.apple.com from a web browser and see if you really have the correct password. Once you're certain the account isn't locked, you can then sign out of all your OS X and iOS devices to ensure that the old password is cleared and not stored incorrectly.\nIf your account is locked due to too many incorrect attempts - you will need to contact Apple to get things sorted.\n", "Q: Is it possible to make \"Look Up\" appear higher in Spotlight? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to place Dictionary definitions higher up in spotlight results \n\nIf so, how?\nI happen to use Spotlight a lot for looking up definitions.

I'll have to move my hand to the mouse and drag it over to hover over the \"Look Up\" section in spotlight for the popup to appear. \n\nI would really enjoy doing this with the keyboard only. If \"Look Up\" was the first or amongst the first results in Spotlight, I could just press the down key to get to it. So I head over to System Preferences and find the following:\n\nA complete lack of the \"Look Up\" element! Is there any way to move \"Look Up\" higher in Spotlight? Or some way to get to the result using the keyboard? Thanks in advance for your time!\n\nA: You might consider Alfred for your searches. It's not only an improvement over Spotlight for local searches (using Spotlight indexes) because it learns your frequent searches, it's extremely malleable.\nHere's Alfred's preference pane that shows control of searches that use OS X's built in dictionary:\n\nHere's what it looks like to search for a word. You can set Alfred up to come up with Command/Space or you can keep Spotlight active and bring it up with an alternative like Option/Space.\nIn my case, I type Option/Space and the word \"define\" and then the word I want to define (which I've left blank here). You can see the Dictionary comes up in the search results by default because \"define\" triggers it:\n\nAlfred is a spectacular product and it's quite stable and free (you do not need the Power Pack extension to look up words). I think it will solve the lookup problem and become useful to you for many other things.\n", "Q: Stream photos from iTunes to iPad I have enabled Home Sharing on a PC (Windows 7).

Home Sharing does have photo sharing support (as you've discovered with your Apple TV), but I don't believe you can stream photos from a computer to an iPad. Movies, TV Shows, Podcasts and the rest, but I don't remember photos from a computer to an iPad were ever supported.\nThe only way to do it would be to use a third-party app or use iCloud with Photo Stream, if you can work within its limitations.\n", "Q: Only small contact photos since iOS 6 facebook integration Before I've upgraded to iOS 6 I did my facebook contact synchronization with an app called \"phone+\".

So if somebody is calling me, his/her picture will only appear in \"thumbnail size\" at the right-hand side of the name, but not on the whole iPhone screen anymore.\nDoes anybody know how to get the bigger pictures back using the integrated solution, or is synchronizing in \"thumbnail size\" actually the solution Apple designed?\n(Additional: Maybe one with facebook integration turned on can tell me in a comment how his/her pictures are shown?)\n\nA: Currently, no.\nThat is the way it works in iOS 6 (if you ask me, it's a better way).\nBut...\nThis month, there should be a massive redesign with iOS 7 - maybe this design will be improved/changed.\n", "Q: Apple id security questions not allowing me to download apps I bought an iPhone 4S.

Okay so I have the same problem. If you don't have any money on your account that you wouldnt risk losing, then reset your phone with a new apple ID. To do that, go to your general settings and there should be a reset button somewhere on there.

The one thing that does fix this issue is making a new user account. When I log in to that account, the icons are revealed.\n\nA: rebooting in safe mode, and rebooting in normal mode solved exact same problem for me (it is method suggested in thread mentioned above My Retina MacBook Pro is missing some icons suddenly! What happened?)\n\nA: The step where you tested with a new account has shown that your corruption is simply to the user settings and preferences and not some problem with a systematic bug or a conflict between software.\nSadly, you have several programs with corruption according to the screen shot and you may need some time to figure out exactly which settings are causing you grief.\nTo start - estimate how much time you will need to just move your documents over to the new account and write that estimate down. Also start a full backup to ensure you have a good recovery point.\nThen spend one third to one quarter of that time clearing settings, looking to delete preference files/that are related to the affected corruption.\nThe menu bar icon location is stored in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.systemuiserver.plist\nSo, you can start with these two articles and the step above to see if you want to try and fix each of these issues by re-creating the affected preference files by dragging them to the desktop (or the trash) and rebooting:\n\n\n*\n\n*Isolating an issue by using another user account\nOnce you've spent some time fixing each item you have noticed breaking, you can check with your original estimate on how long it would have taken to just start moving your documents over and re-choosing your settings. Hopefully, you picked the shorter route to clearing this corruption. The benefit of just starting new is you don't have to notice all the things that are wrong and hunt them down one by one. You will remember you like this desktop picture and that layout and change the things you care about quite easily over time.\n\nA: So I've had the same problem for quite some time now, and I have been googling around a lot.\nIn the end I found out that the problem seems related to hibernation/deep sleep and virtual memory.\nThe problem on my machine was that the swap was disabled and the graphics problems occurs after a wakeup from deep sleep.\nOnly way to temporary fix this was to reboot the mac into my account in single user mode (holding shift while booting), and then back to normal mode.\nThe permanent way to fix it is to reenable the virtual memory kernel again.\nSo starting the virtual memory kernel is done by running :\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.dynamic_pager.plist\n\nAlso on my mac the reason the virtual memory wasn't running was because the file com.apple.dynamic_pager.plist for some reason was deleted/missing.\nSo I restored it from my Time Machine backup and rebooted.\nAnd it all seems fixed now... finally!\nLet me hear if this helps others!\n/Benjamin\n", "Q: Why do we have multiple contacts for the same person on Mountain Lion Messages? Me and a friend have Mountain Lion and iPhone with IOS 6. When I launch Messages on Mac, I have to select either his email or phone number to send a message. I don't get this. Why do I have to select one or another?\nThe worst thing is that both have different behaviors: selecting email will tend to deliver to his computer before the phone while selecting phone number will tend to deliver first on the phone and generally doesn't go to the computer.\nI don't understand that if it shows him as able to iMessage on both iPhone and Mac, why do I have to select the destination source? \n\nA: First of all iOS 6 and Mountain Lion have the ability to combine phone number and Apple ID to use iMessage, but it seems like you haven't activated it.\nHave it separated comes from older versions and also gives you kind of a fallback mode when there is no internet connection available. If you send an iMessage via Apple ID and your partner \"on the other side of the conversation\" had no connection, the message would not be send. Using the phone number you still have/had the ability to resend it as SMS.\nNow, if you want to combine your Apple ID and your phone number, open the prefs on your iOS device, go to the messages section, choose \"send & receive\" and check both your Apple ID and the phone number. Also set the application to start all conversations from your phone number.\nNow, do the same on your Mac. Open the prefs in iMessage on the Mac, go to accounts, choose your iMessage account and check both, your phone number and your Apple ID. Set the application to start new conversations from the phone number.\n\nNow, your streams should be combined from now on (old conversation will stay separated).\nOf course in case of connection problems sending a SMS from the Mac is not possible within iMessages.\nTo your question why you have different possibilities to send the message: Well, because he/she has different contacting possibilities (and technologies - you can sent SMS to the number instead of an iMessage). But they also have the ability to combine their number and ID what should also give them one single stream.\n", "Q: Mail.app won't launch Skim in Mountain Lion I have been using Skim for a while as my standard PDF reader.

I would like to experiment with OS X 10.8, but don’t want to make them upgrade their Mac since 10.6 is still receiving security updates and they subscribe to the \"if it isn’t broke don’t fix it\" computer philosophy. Is it technically possible to run OS X 10.8 in Virtualbox with 10.6 as the host OS? If so how do you do this, and what is the legality of doing so?\n\nA: I haven't seen people have good luck using non-server versions of OS X on Virtual Box since they explicitly do not support Lion or Mountain Lion by intention and design.\nHere is the forum post I refer to when I can't remember which OS virtual box has done the work to make the install go smoothly.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=31104\nThe relevant section reads \"the new Mac OS X as Guest feature is only available to users with Apple/Mac hardware, and only for \"Mac OS X Server\" installations as a guest OS.\"\nIt goes on to explain that they do not welcome any discussions on this topic on their site as it could be construed as bypassing Apple Software License Agreement (SLA).\nThis is quite problematic since the obvious way I would get to Lion Server or Mountain Lion Server would be to start from the 10.6 Retail DVD and then use the App Store to upgrade. Furthermore the FAQ in their forum are from 2007 and 2010 and are marked as \"outdated - do not use these\" for the most part. I apologize for the wordy non-answer but despite some time working on this, it's not at all clear what set of steps are needed to get going.

When I use silent mode, I expect no sound and hence I expect alarms to be silent as well but they are not; ring/silent switch has no effect on alarms!\nOn iOS 5 this used to work and in silent mode alarms did just vibrate.\nHow can i put alarms in silent mode without reconfiguring each of them one by one when I need silent mode?\nThanks\n\nA: Use a silent MP3\nHere's the solution that worked for me:\n\n*\n\n*Get silent audio clip. Search online (e.g. using Google) or create (using GarageBand, Audacity, etc.) a 20-25 second clip of silence.\n\n*Get clip into iTunes. Save it in your iTunes as a \"song\" (I just called it Silent Ringtone).\n\n*Get clip onto iPhone. Then sync your phone so it's now on your phone. (Make sure you check the Sync Music checkbox in iTunes.)\n\n*Use clip on iPhone. Now, when you create an alarm, use Pick a Song from your library, and select your \"Ringtone\" song.   If you have your settings elsewhere set to vibrate on silent or whatever, then you should now have a song that \"plays\" while your phone happily buzzes.\n\nHope that helps!\nP.S. As someone who only recently switched to iPhone from a phone that could do the vibrate-only alarm thing easily, I would use these alarms to set myself private reminders for lots of things. Such as when I was in a lecture or meeting and needed to remember to leave 5 minutes early but didn't want to be watching the clock constantly. Or if I had to remember when to go back and put more money in the parking meter. Or basically a multitude of things to alert myself that I didn't need to whole world to know about! Just a simple buzz in the pocket was enough.\nFurther reading: HowToGeek has screenshots\n\nA: When you make the alarm, go to the option where it says \"sound\" and go all the way to the bottom where it says \"none\" and click on it. I just tested it with my iPhone on silent and the alarm does not go off. Hope this helps. \n\nA: Set \"Sound\" to \"None\"\nDon't know if this will do but for me (iOS6), setting to silent and then turning the ringer down as far as it will go makes the alarm vibrate only. Just remember to turn your volume back up later.\nFurther reading: Apple Support: How to set and manage alarms on your iPhone\n\nA: In your situation where you would like the vibration, but just not the sound the solution may require a bit of an investment.  If you go into iTunes and search for \"Silent iPhone\" they have ringtones that you can set as the default for your alarms. I think that would give you your desired result of vibration with no sound. The only downside being if you are expecting more than just a vibration if you are out of silent mode.\n\nA: I did a lot of searching, and most solutions were to download a free ringtone recorder to record a silent ringtone. However, there was still static in the recording just due to ambient noise. The best solution is to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do a google search for blank MP3 (I used the following result: http://www.xamuel.com/blank-mp3s/)\n\n*Download a blank MP3 to your desktop (I think any length will work, as I tried the 5 Sec and 30 second files and both had the same result, so I went with the 5 second file)\n\n*Open iTunes → File → Add To Library\n\n*Select the blank MP3 file from your Desktop that downloaded in step #2\n\n*Either give the blank MP3 file it's own playlist and sync that playlist to your iPhone (I created a playlist called Silent) or add it to an existing playlist that is sync'd to your phone\n\n*Go to the alarm that you only want to vibrate, select the sound option, select pick a song and select the Silent MP3 file you just sync'd\n\n*The last thing you need to do is make sure your phone is set to vibrate when it rings; go to Settings → Sounds and make sure Vibrate On Ring and Vibrate On Silent are on\n\nA: I tried the suggestion to search \"silent iPhone\" in iTunes ($1.29 & I chose the second option).  Then I sat that as the tone for my daily recurring alarm to take my Claritin (it goes off in the morning & when I'm sitting in lecture it's rude & annoying to have someone's phone go off & disrupt the entire class).  I made sure to flip the mute button on my iPhone 6 with \"vibrate on ring\" & \"vibrate on silent\" both turned on.  The alarm went off perfectly with only a vibration in my pocket so the world doesn't have to stop what they're doing- I can quietly take care of it & go about my day with everyone else none the wiser.\n\nA: How to Set an iPhone Alarm to Vibrate Only\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Clock app.\n\n*Select Alarm at the bottom of the screen.\n\n*Touch Edit at the top-left corner of the screen.\n\n*Select the alarm that you wish to modify.\n\n*Tap the Sound button.\n\n*Scroll to the bottom of the screen and select None.\n\n*Scroll to the top and select Vibration.\n\n*Specify the type of vibration that you wish to use.\n\n\nFrom here: https://www.live2tech.com/set-iphone-alarm-vibrate/\n\nA: I think the best solution is, select any song as a ringtone, select a type of desired vibration(like Symphony or SOS), save the alarm , then reduce the phone ringtone volume(by pressing the external volume buttons), and bingo, job done. \n", "Q: About this Mac shows wrong graphics on Macbook pro 15\" late 2011 When I check out the Graphics on 'About this Mac' it says that it is using the Intel HD Graphics 3000 384 MB even if I also have an AMD Radeon HD 6750M.

I understand that .DS_store files serve a purpose. That said, they are a nuisance when auto-completing with the cd command. When I type cd in Terminal and press tab twice it lists all directories in the working directory.\nIs there a way of removing .DS_store from this auto-complete directory listing in the terminal? \n\nA: export FIGNORE=DS_Store works for me.\nThe GNU Bash manual provides extensive information on programmable completion.\nSpecifically, from the documentation on bash variables\n\nFIGNORE [is a] colon-separated list of suffixes to ignore when performing\n  filename completion. A file name whose suffix matches one of the\n  entries in FIGNORE is excluded from the list of matched file names. A\n  sample value is ‘.o:~’\n\nIf you are concerned that there might be existing suffixes in FIGNORE, then you can use:\nexport FIGNORE=$FIGNORE:DS_Store\n\n\nA: I think what you're really looking for is context-aware tab completion for Bash commands.  For example, .DS_Store is a regular file, not a directory, so it should not show up as a possible completion to cd.\nThe package that solves this problem is called bash-completion.  I use Fink's version (fink install bash-completion), and it's also available from MacPorts (port install bash-completion) and Homebrew (brew install bash-completion).\nAfter the package is installed and configured in your .bashrc or .bash_profile, regular files will no longer show up as completions for cd, and many other common bash commands become context aware as well (eg. gunzip).\n\nA: While you're asking about only .DS_Store I think removing all hidden files from autocomplete will be better in general. This can be done by the command:\n\nbind 'set match-hidden-files off'\n\nyou can add it ~/.bash_profile to have it invoked every time for you. This will not disable autocompletion for hidden files completely, you still can type '.' (dot) and hit tab for it.\n\nA: I would use this command:\nzip -r foo.zip foo -x \"*.DS_Store\"\n\nFound here:\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/198569/compressing-folders-on-a-mac-without-the-ds-store\n", "Q: How to focus on list of found files after search in Finder using the keyboard with full keyboard access activated?

However, in general I like to have full keyboard access.\nI was hoping there would be some key combination that could be used to focus on the list of files in Finder. Thus, my question is:\nHow can I focus on a list of found files after search in Finder using the keyboard with Full Keyboard Access set to \"All controls\"?\n\nA: An ideal solution would be a single key press that is relatively intuitive and consistent with other keyboard interface rules. Nonetheless, I have found a couple of hacks that seems to work. \n\n\n*\n\n*Cmd+[ then Cmd+]: This navigates back then forward. After this has occurred the focus is on the file list.

This doesn't seem to work in Lion.\nDoes anyone know how to move windows between desktops in Lion?\n\nA: You can go into Mission Control (formerly known as Expose in Snow Leopard), then drag the window from your current desktop the thumbnail of the other desktop, which will be at the top of the screen.\n\n", "Q: My iMessage froze up on my iPod 4th generation So I was texting one of my friends and I sent him about 700 emojis characters and now whenever I try to open the app, it just freezes for 15 seconds and then crashes out. What can I do to make iMessage work again?\n\nA: You can double tap the home button till the app switcher comes up at the bottom of the screen, then press and hold the messages app until the little red minus button appears at the top left of the app button. Press that to shut it down, then open it again. \nYou could also hard reset the iPod by holding down the home and sleep button at the same time for about 15 seconds.\n\nA: That happened to me recently. You can press on the contacts app, press a contact, and then press the message button. Then you will be taken into iMessage and you can text again! It worked on my iPhone 4. Hope this helped!

I'm running Windows 7 from within Parallels running on MacOS X Lion. I've also setup a local apache server; I can access this server from MacOS X via any browser. I've configured this using a combination of /etc/hosts and configuring the vhosts file: typing in http://epwbst into my browser brings me to the expected website on the MacOS X side. Doing this on the Windows side doesn't do the right thing. I am able to access any other web resource.\nI suspect that I need to reconfigure the DNS on the Windows side to look to the MacOS X side first. How do I do this?\n\nA: First ensure you have set the type of your VM network as \"Shared Network\" (in Parallels open the VM Configure window > Hardware > Network). Don't know if it works with another network type.\nFrom Parallels: browser test your OS X localhost:\n\nParallels creates a little DHCP network for your virtual machines, and the OS X machine itself is at the gateway IP.   Go into Parallels > Preferences > Advanced > Network and the gateway is most likely the Start Address with a 0, 1 or 2 in front of it.  For example, my Start Address is 10.211.55.1 and in Internet Explorer I type http://10.211.55.2 to hit the webserver I have running on OS X at http://localhost:80.\n\nSo, go to your guest OS (Windows) and edit the hosts file (on Windows it's located at C:\\Windows\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts) to enter this Parallels gateway IP (in my case 10.211.55.2) and name of the VirtualHost you've configured in Apache:\n10.211.55.2 myvirtualhostname.localhost\n10.211.55.2 myvirtualhostname2.localhost\n\nThis does the trick as that IP address is going to be maintained by Parallels and will not change as you change your location.\nNow you can access to myvirtualhostname.localhost (or whatever your VirtualHost is named on Apache) from guest's browser.\n\nA: The only thing really necessary is figuring out the IP address of the Mac host, and browse to that IP address on the Windows client machine.\nFor example, if your Mac host has the IP address 10.0.1.35, you should be able to browse to http://10.0.1.35.\nIf you have configured a firewall on the Mac, you probably want to disable that, or allow communication on port 80 to pass.\nIf you have configured named based virtual hosts in Apache, additionally you'll want to add entries to Windows' hosts file in %SystemRoot%\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts, for example:\n10.0.1.35 epwbst\n\n", "Q: Why does Java SE 6 Web Start (javaws) not find the JRE with Apple's Java for OS X 2012-006 on Mountain Lion?

Clicking with the left button does nothing, clicking with right button changes the colour of the button slightly so the bottom half is in gray but nothing else happens.\nAs there is no menu option to install the updates I thought I tried and install the updates using the keybaord but I cannot work out how to do this.\nHelp Please !\n\nA: I'm not sure about the answer, but my suggestions are too long for a comment. So I will create an answer nontheless.\nFirst: Installing updates with the keyboard should be easy if you are able to launch the app store. When you are in the appstore, use your \"tab\"-key to go through the main menu. Hit \"space\" to enter the selected item. Hitting the tab key again will bring you to the other items in the window (like the \"update\"-button). \nIf updating does not solve your issue and you are sure that there is no Magic Mouse somewhere in your bag or whatever, which is accidently turned on and can cause issues, you could try to reset NVRAM. This article should be interesting to you: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4061591?start=0&tstart=0\n", "Q: Serial-Ethernet or Serial-WiFi (or Serial-Bluetooth?) on OS X I'm trying to connect a remote serial port to my MacBook Pro (and potentially other devices such as Windows or laptops, and Android tablets and smartphones) wirelessly.\nI've come across Serial-WiFi and Serial-Ethernet adaptors (the latter could presumably be connected to a router and accessed via my existing wifi network), but I don't know how to access the serial port from my Mac.\nSo far as I can tell tese devices rely on drivers which simulate a COM port on the computer, and so far as I can tell none of these adaptors come with drivers which work on OS X.\nI see that there are also Serial-Bluetooth adaptors, which I guess would also suffice for my purpose if they could be made to work, but I assume the same issue exists with these.\nIn case it helps; this is for connecting the NMEA 0183 outputs of various marine navigational instruments to my computer, for use by navigational sftware such as (primarily) OpenCPN. For those who aren't familiar with it, NMEA 0183 is a protocol enabling marine navigational instruments to share data with each other via ASCII data sentences broadcast over a serial interface. More details on Wikipedia.\nIf there's an alternative way to transmit this data to my computer over wifi, that would be equally acceptable.\n\nA: Bluetooth may actually be the way to go. There's no standard for Serial-WiFi or Serial-Ethernet adapters (as far as I know), so you'd be at the mercy of the manufacturers who need to provide OS X drivers. On the other hand, most Bluetooth functions come from a set of standardized profiles that don't need specific device drivers. For example, a headset just needs to implement the correct audio profile to be able to work with anything that supports that profile. Bluetooth serial adapters implement the Serial Port Profile, and OS X supports it.\nOnce you have one of those devices and have it paired, it will show up as a standard serial port device like /dev/cu.bluetooth and /dev/tty.bluetooth, just like a Serial-USB adapter.\nIf the serial port doesn't get created automaticaly, it can be added manually in the Bluetooth advanced preferences. I also found an example of someone using SPP with a Mac here: \nUsing Bluetooth Serial Port on OS X Mountain Lion.\n", "Q: Back up and shut down At the end of the day, I would like my MacBook Pro to back-up to both Time Machine and Backblaze (or verify that it has done so) and then shut down.

However I really don't want to give up 20 gigabytes to installer files.\nAlso, is there any built-in way to delete them (meaning through appstore menu or something, not via finder)?\n\nA: That is the Download folder for App Store; where it saves apps as it downloads them.\nIt should be perfectly safe to delete them.\nHowever, I have to say that it is a little strange that the files aren't being deleted automatically, either when you close App Store or when you restart - that is what I would expect.

I need to use my mouse or launch Alfred to open the app.\nIdeally What I'd like todo is somehow override the close button with hide instead (hide as in cmd+h). By hiding an app, I can use alt+tab to retrieve it.\nAny help would be great\n\nA: There are two types of app in OS X.\nDocument-based apps can have multiple windows, and they only close the window when you click the close button (red cross). The other type of app has only one window; and when you click the close button it quits the app.\nCmd+tab in OS X doesn't behave in the way you are trying to use it; it is simply for switching between open apps in a similar way to alt+tab on Windows (but not identical). It doesn't open apps that have been closed.\nIt's not the answer you want to hear, but I'm afraid there isn't a way to override the close button globally; it is a part of OS X's AppKit and can't easily be overridden by third-party software.\nAn easier fix would be not to click close when you only want to hide an app. Try pressing Cmd+H instead, or perhaps minimising the window by clicking the yellow button instead of the red one.\n", "Q: Are there any downsides to cloning an HDD to an SSD? I'm setting up a MacBook (2009 unibody, for the record) for a friend. There's currently a regular HDD in the machine, and I'm going to be putting a fresh install of Mountain Lion and iLife on it, along with fully updating the machine and preinstalling some useful third-party apps. I've also advised said friend to put an SSD in the machine, so my plan was to do the long-winded part of this on the current HDD, then when the SSD gets delivered, clone the contents over using CCC so it's good to go.\nMy question, then, is this. Is cloning from an HDD to an SSD absolutely no different to doing all this installing and configuring on the SSD directly, or are there any kind of optimisations or etc that the install process carries out when it's aware it's being installed onto a different type of drive? My instincts say no, but I don't want the machine to incur a performance penalty because I took a shortcut. Thanks for any advice!\n\nA: Your question probably arose from awareness of \"hot zones\" that OS X automatically manages on HDDs (where the location of files on the physical disk has a bearing on performance). On SSDs, the location of files does not have any bearing on the performance. So there shouldn't be any issues cloning from the HDD to the SSD using Carbon Copy Cloner.\nThese responses from Mike Bombich (creator of CCC) from the official CCC discussion forums would be useful to you:\nClone to SSD on new iMac\nInstalling an SSD in a MacPro\n\nA: I'd suggest cloning to the SSD first, then doing all of the new installs on the SSD and leaving the HDD as-is for awhile.  This will give you the performance improvements of the SSD while doing some major installations, and will also give you a fallback in case of any issues, by allowing you to simply replace the existing HDD without any changes having been made to it.\nI've now done several HDD to SSD upgrades using the still-awesome Carbon Copy Cloner and have not run into any issues.  After cloning I'd recommend using a cache cleaning utility, such as Cocktail or Mountain lion Cache Cleaner to flush caches, repair permissions etc.\n", "Q: Applescript to add sender of message to specific group in Contacts I'm trying to set up an Applescript to add the sender of a selected message in Apple Mail to a specific group in the Contacts app. By reconfiguring the code provided in this answer, I worked up the following but it isn't working.

This may give unexpected results from strangely formatted names in emails.\nIf you have any problems with this one, let me know and I'll see if I can fix them.

Is there something that would work better than Finder for this?\nThis is on OSX 10.8.2. Windows or Linux (or both, I forget which OS) moves the files remotely.\n\nA: If you're moving between two different shares, even if they're on the same host, there's no way to avoid the local copy, without changing your configuration.\nFrom the Mac's point of view, the shares are two distinct entities. Even though the hostname/IP is the same, there's no way for the OS to match up the directory tree of one share with the other, let alone a command for the SMB server to move files in that sort of instance.\nFrom a practical standpoint, I can think of three ways to work around the local copying:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the server's configuration so you have one share that encompasses the source and destination.\n\n*Log in remotely to the server via SSH or some form of remote desktop and perform the move directly on the server.\n\n*Access the server via a different method, such as FTP. For this to work you of course need FTP access to both the source and destination paths in one host, otherwise you're back at square one.\n\n\nA: I'm not even aware if SMB has a command to let a client request the server do lifting in band, but the tool that I use for doing this sort of thing over SFTP is Transmit by Panic. Sadly, it doesn't have it's own SMB client and instead uses Finders so any speedups it could provide would be in cacheing data and filesystem metadata and not by eliminating the round trip to move a file that is on one SMB share.\nThere is a free evaluation available from http://www.panic.com/transmit/ in case you don't get a better solution and perhaps could get ssh/sftp access to the same files so you can send move and zip commands remotely to speed up these file maintenance changes from a remote location.\n", "Q: How do I do 6-key Braille input? Does Mac OS X have a facility for 6 key (Perkins) Braille typing? That is using F, D, S, J, F & L to type in the various Braille cells (mapping respectively to ⠁, ⠂, ⠄, ⠈, ⠐& ⠠) on the keyboard. I don't want to have to use the character palette as that would really slow me down. If OS X doesn't have it out of the box, what 3rd party tools are good?\nAn answer for 8-key input is also acceptable.\n\nA: Just recently out I think, Braille Writer for OS X:\nhttp://ethervision.net/blog/braille-writer-mac-apple\nIf you have an iOS device, you there is Braille Pad. \nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/braille-pad-pro/id544696675?mt=8\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/braille-pad-student/id551373276?mt=8\n", "Q: Boost Volume for iPad I have been using an iPad's speech synathesis for a project and we're finding that the volume just isn't loud enought - are there ways of boosting the loudness without just adding external speakers? The iPad is jailbroken, and I'm willing to consider approaches that reduce the lifespan of the device.\n\nA: There is a neat trick you can do with a book, or other hard surface. (Ideal results are achieved with a concave surface.) Place the iPad speaker facing the book/surface. Some sound will reflect off the book, and join the forwards traveling sound, effectively boosting the volume by a small margin.\nOther than that, consider placing the iPad almost touching the microphone of whatever recording device you are using.\n(There is probably an app on Cydia to boost volume, but my iPad is not jailbroken, so I am not sure)\n\nA: Just heard about \"Volume Boost Free\" on I think mac weekly, it was one of the guests app of the week. I just installed the app and does seem to increase the volume. The app is in the app store and is free, it is not a universal app but it does work on my iPad 2.\nlink below\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/volume-boost-free/id421816838?mt=8\n\nA: Take a look at the SoundJaw.

Following the AirPlay setup instructions on Apple's website, I turned on my Apple TV, and then, having started playback on my iPad, switched the output from the iPad to the Apple TV. The Apple TV plays audio, and responds to all of the iPad's playback controls, but there's no video. In fact, when the media shows up (as \"now playing\", under computers), it's shown to be an audio track: the Apple TV shows the default iTunes graphic for albums with no artwork.\nI'm using the original iPad running iOS 5.1.1 (the latest this model supports)\nAm I missing something here? Is it possibly that it's just an ill-coded app?\n\nA: From Apple's Apple TV 2 AirPlay page (in the footnotes at the bottom of that page):\n\n  \n*\n  \n*AirPlay is available on all devices running iOS 4.3 or later. Some features require the latest software. Second-generation Apple TV or later required.\n  \n*AirPlay Mirroring is available with iPad 2 or later; iPhone 4S; iMac (Mid 2011 or newer), Mac mini (Mid 2011 or newer), MacBook Air (Mid 2011 or newer), and MacBook Pro (Early 2011 or newer) with Mountain Lion.\n  \n\nThis explains your situation as far as what you're describing, which sounds like mirroring. In my experience with the 1st gen iPad, there is usually a speaker icon next to the name of your Apple TV when you are attempting AirPlay and audio-only capability is available. When you're using hardware with video AirPlay capability (i.e., Mirroring), there is a TV icon next to the name of the Apple TV. Beyond the footnotes listed above, this is a sure indicator of your iPad to Apple TV connectivity options.\n", "Q: Mini-display port MBP dual monitors Are there any dual monitor adapters for the Mini Display port that support true multi monitor mode?  For example the Matrox Dual Head To Go just makes your computer think it's connected to a 3360x1050 display rather than 2 1680*1080 displays and you have to do lots of work arounds to ensure that the dock doesn't span both monitors and alerts don't show in the middle of the monitors etc.\n\nA: In theory Displayport 1.2 supports daisy-chaining and hubs, which would support this, provided you have a Mac that supports Displayport 1.2 (I think it's just 2011 Macs and later, but I couldn't find a definitive answer). However as far as I can tell, there aren't any monitors that support daisy-chaining available, nor are there any hubs expected until sometime in 2013.\nAt the moment you're restricted to the adapters that concatenate the two displays, rather than present them independently. An alternative might be a Displaylink adapter, which allows you to connect a monitor via USB. It does limit performance however, but how much this impacts you depends on what you're using it for.\n\nA: DisplayLink is not an option if you're using a VM (e.g., Parallels) with Windows. Attempting to intall Windows drivers for DisplayLink USB adapters corrupts the Windows installation, requires rebuild of VM content. Hidden 'way down in Diamond web site is a warning that drivers do not install in virtual machines. \nJ5 Create adapters do work, however.\n", "Q: Is the keyboard on the 15\" Mac Book Pro with Retina display different than others in size? I just got a new 15\" Retina MacBook Pro (rMBP) for a friend and looking for a good keyboard guard/ cover. I know shopping questions are off topic, but I'm wondering if the sizing is something that differers between Mac models.\nI have Moshi ClearGuard for my 2009 15\" MBP. Would that work for the rMBP or do I need to look for something specific to Retina models?\n\nA: No need to worry - at present, the only MacBook with a physically different keyboard size (in the US) than the rest is the 11 inch Air.\nThe small Air has a full sized \"main keyboard\" but the top row of function keys are slightly smaller than the top row of function keys on the rest of the lineup. I would presume that the same holds for international key layouts when they have different enter keys or additional physical keys, but don't know that fact for sure.\nThe cover you mentioned will fit the new retina MacBooks - both 13\" and 15\" - as long as the hardware is a US model.\n", "Q: Why aren't all my garageband loops present?

As they take up a lot of space on your harddrive, the average user will be very happy to save that extra space.\nPeople who require more loops can download them via the Software Update:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Mac App Store.\n\n*Click on the tab \"Updates\".\n\n\nThis is the normal procedure of getting the free, extra audio clips.\nWat you are experiencing could be an error.

For the most part it works well, after some tweaks in System Preferences and third party software.\nHowever, one thing I can't figure out is whether I can send the Command signal during boot.  This would be helpful for booting into recovery mode, etc. On newer PC keyboards I could just use the Windows key, but this old beast doesn't have that.\nI'd rather not have to keep another keyboard around just for this purpose, although that's not the end of the world.\n\nA: Unfortunately I think you're out of luck. I don't know exactly what sorts of tweaks you've used to get a command key in OS X, but they're almost certainly at the OS level, not on the hardware or firmware level. The EFI boot loader can't read these tweaks, so unless the keyboard itself can directly send the command key signal, you're out of luck.\nThe only thing I can think of is some sort of hardware device that would stand in between the keyboard and the Mac and spit out modified key codes if given the proper input. However I don't know of any such product. Perhaps something could be hacked up using an Arduino or something similar, but it would be a fairly substantial project.\nI think you're best off just getting a cheap keyboard with a windows or command key and keeping it in a drawer for the few occasions when you do need it.\n\nA: As per comment I searched and discovered that Mac has inbuilt possibility to use Caps Lock as command⌘.\n\nOld answer:\nI also have a model M (but this applies to any Winkeyless keyboard) but since it is hooked to a MacBook Pro I don't need the command⌘ key for boot but I needed a command⌘ for all the other functions, and since Model M doesn’t have a ⊞ Win I cannot use it.\nI thought it is impossible, searching on Ask Different always this question came first, and no other solution and since I found a solution to use Caps Lock as command⌘ using\nKarabiner Elements and import complex-modification rule from site this specific rule: Change caps_lock to command like in image below, I thought was good to post an answer that is probably relevant to modern day MacBook Pro users:\n\nMake sure you have installed Karabine Elements following all the steps including Reset and give access for the keyboard and all other steps.\n", "Q: Disable Wifi Hotspot Popup Window Is there a way to disable the wifi popup window that was introduced in OS X Lion.\nI know I can remove it from known wifi networks, but sometimes I do use this connection (It's the Starbucks free wifi next door). The problem arises when I am using Ethernet and maybe it flakes out, or OS X is doing something else, but It pops this window up to let me connect to the free wifi hotspot. I'd much rather have to do this manually (Using my web browser) rather than the \"always on top\" popup window it gives me.\nI've looked around on the internet and have found no solutions, I was kind of hoping some network guru for sound defaults write blah.blah to disable it.\nSee image below for the popup window I'm seeing: \n\n\nA: While littlerock's answer works, there are better options. Specifically, you can do one of the following. The order is what I would recommend:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the system setting. This is preferred, as it's using the OS as designed. Do this on the console and provide your password:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.captive.control Active -boolean false\n\n*Prevent OSX from detecting the fact that we're on a captive portal, by editing the hosts file. Apple uses their domain to test whether we are on the Internet or not. To do this, edit the following file as root with a text editor:\n/etc/hosts\n127.0.0.1 captive.apple.com\n\n*Last, you can follow littlerock by renaming the following file (as root) to whatever you like:\n/System/Library/CoreServices/Captive Network Assistant.app\n\nA: Check this link.

I tried everything to activate it, but it still says \"waiting for activation\". What should I do?\n\n\n\nA: A few of the things that are under your control are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Undo the iMessage settings, power off the device and try again in 5 minutes.\n\n*Check that iCloud isn't having system-wide problems\n\n*Same as step one, but wait 20 to 200 minutes. (sometimes the problem is in the network or the activation servers or the SMS network to tie your phone to the Apple system with the one time activation message and waiting is easier than working with all of the above parties)\n\n*Rather than wait - work through the steps to Troubleshoot iMessage and FaceTime Activation\n\n*Contact Apple for support\nIt's hard to guess what exactly is wrong, but you also can edit your question to list what steps you have done to troubleshoot this and perhaps someone can guess or point out a missed step.\n\nA: If no other messages appear (e.g. incorrect username or password for your iCloud account), that typically indicates that there's a problem contacting or getting authorization from Apple's iMessage servers. I've had that happen periodically when setting up or resetting iMessage on an iOS device.\nUnfortunately, as it's a problem on Apple's end, there's not much to be done other than wait and try again periodically by turning iMessage off, then on again. At times when I've run into it, it's typically resolved itself within 5 to 30 minutes, sometimes even less.\nIf you still can't get it working within a few hours, then amend your question with that information and/or contact Apple.\n\nA: I had the same problem with locked Sprint iPhone 5. Im using R-SIM7 for unlock and couldn't activate my phone, SMS, 3G, iMessages and Facetime wasn't working (Waiting for activation). Long story short, I managed to fix:\n\n\n*\n\n*To fix this you need to jailbreak with evasi0n and download iFile from cydia(or you can just use ifunbox).\n\n*Go to (CarrierLab.bundle or 00101 folder) /System/Library/Carrier Bundles/iPhone/00101/carrier.plist\n\n\n*\n\n*back up the file carrier.plist (just in case)\n\n*Go to the following line and add +011 so it looks like +011447786205094\n<key>PhoneNumberRegistrationGatewayAddress<string>+011447786205094</string>\n\n*SAVE\n\n\n*Now go to /System/Library/CarrierBundles/iPhone/Unknown.bundles/carrier.plist\n\n\n*\n\n*ADD -> \"+011\" To all the 10 numbers you see.\n<key>PhoneNumberRegistrationGatewayAddress</key><string>+011447537410207</string>\n\n*SAVE\n\n\n*Now go to /System/Library/Carrier Bundles/iPhone/[carrier that your phone is locked to]/carrier.plist \n\n\n*\n\n*Find SMS perfix under <key>international</key> and delete \"011\" value so it looks like <string></string>\n\n*SAVE\n\n\n*To fix 3G go to /System/Library/Carrier Bundles/iPhone/Unknown.bundles/carrier.plist  find <key>SIMs</key><array> and copy all those \"xxxxx\" number from there and now go to /System/Library/Carrier Bundles/iPhone/carrier that your phone is locked to/carrier.plist4. and find this line:\n\n\n*\n\n*<key>intldataroamingallowed</key>\n\n*<array> paste here </array>\n\n*SAVE then reboot.\n\n*If 3G still not working change to correct APN using unlockit.co.nz \n\n\n\nA: iMessage activation is a long lasting process. Apple even states without much practical explanation that this process can take as long as 24 hours.\nBut the core of the problem isn't that Apple take that amount of time to check that a phone number already registered is the one from which comes an activation request. This process is much faster.\nIn fact the core of the problem is that this process want to achieve a validation in a connection environment where there are 2 routes to reach the Apple authentication server.\nMost of the time an iPhone or an iPad are connected with 2 interfaces, a Wi-fi network connection and a mobile phone network one.\nThese 2 kinds of connection have a basic property of using wireless\nconnections and consequently are frequently unstable.\nEach of these connections might be described as in either of 3 states:\n\n\n*\n\n*off\n\n*on:\n\n\n*\n\n*stable\n\n*unstable (most tipically when we are moving and at a varying\ndistance of the antenna of the mobile phone or the Wi-Fi network).\n\n\n\nAnd the truth is that people who use iPhone or iPad tend to be\ntrue mobile users.\nHere is a small table discribing the 9 combinations of network quality\na normal iPhone or iPad might encounter and the resulting potential sucess of iMessage activation process:\n\nThe practical conclusion is that there are only 3 cases out of 9 where this activation process will result in a quick success.\nPractical recommandations\n\n\n*\n\n*When you want to start an iMessage activation process, 1st check that\nyou have one and only one stable connection: either a mobile phone one or a Wi-Fi network one.\nCheck that either Wi-Fi setting is off (Settings > Wi-Fi: Off) or\nmobile network is off (Settings > Mobile Data: Off).\nThen check your connection quality (stability) by accessing for example:\nApple AppleID server\n\n*Then consider to temporarily reduce your normal mobility\nto let this long lasting activation process to reach you back\nwith the same stable connection place. \nTested in real and difficult conditions (mountain in a foreign country), this shouldn't last more than a big 15 minutes.\n\n*This iMessage activation process is using the https protocol\nwhich means it is secured and for this it does use certificates. These cetificates have all an expiration date. For the certificate used not to\nbe considered as expired it is of the uppermost importance that your\nclock is correct and within the correct Time Zone .\nCheck this in Settings > General > Date & Time. Since this is expected to be automatically provided by your mobile phone network, if this one\nisn't stable, provide the Time Zone manually.\nBad recommandations\nIf one of the above conditions isn't checked, I verified that\nneither a complete restart nor a complete reinitialisation of an\niPhone could lead to a quick success.\nThe only case where these procedures will lead to an apparent success\nis when through repeating the same silly process you waste enough time\nto be again within a stable connection condition where you can get the Apple answer of the activation process in time.\n\nA: Try logging into iTunes. Not sure what this would have done but it worked for me...\n\nA: I would also do a hard restart between attempts. Hold down sleep button and Home at the same time for abt. 10 seconds, wait for Apple logo to reappear.\n\nA: I have been reading forums and tried different solutions and what worked for me was to switch off 'Send as sms'.\nMy iMessage is still 'waiting for activation' but iMessaging works and so does regular sms\n", "Q: My OS X Mac Mini server crashed - How can I restore it? I have a 2011 Mac Mini Server. It is the unibody model that has two hard drives and no optical drive. I got this second hand so I don't have anything other than the machine itself.\nThe way I understand these things to be set up is that one drive is the primary drive and the second drive does time-machine backups.\nThe primary drive is starting to go bad, I connected it via USB to another Mac and ran Disk Utility which tells me:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Verifying volume “Server HD”\n  \n*Checking file systemError: This disk needs to be repaired. Click Repair Disk.\n  \n*Verify and Repair volume “Server HD”\n  \n*Checking file systemVolume repair complete.Updating boot support partitions for the volume as required.\n  \n*Error: Disk Utility can’t repair this disk. Back up as many of your files as possible, reformat the disk, and restore your backed-up files.\n  \n\nIt looks like the secondary drive (Time Machine backups) is fine.\nI believe the operating system is OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard Server.\nWhat do I do?\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace the primary hard disk and try to boot it?\n\n*Connect the time machine volume and a new (blank) HDD drive to another mac and try and run Disk Utility / Time Machine?\n\n*Replace the primary hard disk in the Mac Mini Server and then Boot up an OS X install via a USB Drive?\n\n\nIf number 3, do I need to get a copy of OS X Snow Leopard Server server that I can boot from - or can I just use the Mountain Lion USB boot stick that I already have?\n\nA: I am unfamiliar with the two disk Mac Mini Server.  I have, however, had a Time Capsule for several years.\nFirst of all:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your file system is damaged beyond what Apple themselves can fix.  Take the warnings very serious - you may loose data.  I do not think that the hard disk is physically damaged, though.\n\n*You may risk accidentially loosing your internal Time Machine backups by accident.\n\n\nAt this point in time, I would suggest that you first create an extra backup of your Time Machine data (this most likely require an extra external drive the size of your Time Machine harddisk) which for the Time Capsule can be triggered from inside Airport Tool - I do not know how to do it for your hardware.\nThat done, get a copy of your installation media as suggested by soxman.  After ordering with AppleCare - due to the severeness of this problem - you may want to consider downloading a torrent with the dvd images so you can get started before you loose data.\nWhen you have it fixed, consider upgrading to Mountain Lion Server (if possible on your machine).    I do not know if the installer can reformat the file system and restore the time machine backup, but it might be a shortcut to the 10.6 start.\nA final note:  I would recommend against using third party file system tools for anything else than salvaging files before reformatting the partition.  File systems are so important that I would only trust Apple itself for OS X file systems.\n\nA: I always thought that message was a bit harsh, since it seems to usually indicates a corrupt file system structure but makes things sound much worse.\nIn most cases with OS 10.6 and prior, the necessary repair is usually remedied by booting from the install media (or the media for the OS that you are running, whichever the case may be) and running Repair Disk from Disk Utility. Alternatively, you can do the same thing if you have a bootable clone on hand. The reason that an \"external\" volume is needed is because Disk Utility cannot repair the OS of the currently mounted volume, since the volume that needs repairing has to be unmounted first. In either case, Time Machine will not do what the system is telling you needs to be done. Before you begin, you will ideally want the correct build number for your machine if you wish to keep the current OS version.\nI see the following solutions (any will suffice - your discretion):\n\n\n*\n\n*Obtain a copy of the correct media by contacting Apple Care Support, which is mentioned in this knowledge base article:\n\nI do not have the restore media that originally shipped with my Mac, what should I do?\n  Contact AppleCare and request replacement of the correct restore media. \n\n\n\n*\n\n*After getting the correct version of OS X Server, your next step depends on whether you've got a USB or DVD.\na) If you've got a DVD disc, boot your other Mac off the disk, and attach the Mini's HDD to it. \nb) If you get it on USB, boot the Mini itself\n\n*From there you can run Disk Utility again, though with the exact, correct build. This might work. If not, back up what you have one last time (if you haven't already) and reinstall. After install you will asked if you want to restore data from one of several sources, Time Machine included. \n\n\n*Disk Warrior can repair your file structure as well. This application comes at a cost - $99.95 - but if you have the extra scratch it is well-worth having. \n\n*Upgrade to Mac OS X Mountain Lion Server. Installing a new OS will by default \"fix\" the problem as it will be installing its own file structure. You'll need to make sure that your mini is capable of running it, though - it only runs on early 2009 or newer models.\n\n*Scour the interwebs or hit up a friend for the proper media. This is the least reliable, and would only be a desperate, last-resort way to fix things. Getting a second-hand product always carries greater risk - a fact of which you're now well aware. \nAs an addendum, it probably also would not hurt to run the Apple Hardware Test just to rule-out a hardware problem. Also, when you get this issue resolved (and you will), go get a copy of Carbon Copy Cloner. \nThe instructions above will get your Mac up and running again for sure. The main challenge will be obtaining the necessary external media. \nGood luck!\n", "Q: Can non iPhone iOS devices (iPad specifically) be used to dial short USSD codes for carrier information?

Is it possible at all?\nUSSD codes are like this: *123*1# for data balance.\n\nA: Nope, not possible! The USSD code would be sent over a voice call of sorts, but there's no phone app on the iPad. The cellular access is strictly for data (at least without jailbreaking).\nYou'll just have to find a different way of checking your data balance!

Maybe, it can help you out with your issue too. The sleep isn't at all random, but in fact is set in the Energy Saver system preference as well from the terminal using pmset.\nYou could use pmset to inspect and change the sleep settings if you have admin rights on the remote.\n\nA: On macOS 11.5.1 Big Sur, you can use systemsetup to alter sleep settings:\n# Disable display, disk, computer sleep\nsudo systemsetup -setsleep Never\n\n\nA: You can manage your computer's power settings through \n\nSystem Preferences -> Energy Saver\n\nWithin this pane, click on the Power Adapter tab, and drag the Computer Sleep slider all the way to the right, so that it is set to \"Never.\" This will force the computer to stay awake 24/7.

I want to enable app-synchronization between the iPhone and iTunes on a new computer.\nI already transferred the apps from the iPhone to iTunes but when checking the box for synchronizing apps, iTunes still displays the warning message that the phone apps will be replaced by the iTunes apps.\nThe last time I did this, I still had all my apps but the in-app purchases got lost as well as any saved progress in my games.\nThis meant that I had to re-download the maps of my navigation app (skobbler). I'd like to avoid this as my monthly data volume is currently very limited.\nIs there a way to synchronize without losing the application data?\n\nA: \nThe last time I did this, I still had all my apps but the in-app purchases got lost as well as any saved progress in my games.\n\nTo avoid this occasion, you have to save the app data manually. You can do it with any iOS file manager on PC (with i-FunBox for example).\nThere's one more way to backup the application data: the DataDeposit app from Cydia store uploads all the data of an application to Dropbox and is able to restore it automatically (jailbreak is required).\n\nA: This problem is solved with iTunes version 11.\nIt simply offers a checkbox to synchronize new apps automatically and that just works as expected.\nI did this on 2 different Windows machines (Win7 and Win8) with the same iPhone and no application data got lost. It seems to me like this means that an iPhone no longer has to be app-synchronized with one iTunes installation.\n", "Q: How to change account name and full name to one, consistent name? I have created an administrator account on a Mac OSX 10.5.8. At first, the user name and account name were called \"kaleb\". However, I later changed the name (is this account or user?) via System Preferences | Accounts to \"apple2\". \nI now want this name to be consistent for everything related to this account. To try to do this, I followed the instructions at http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1428. However, this hasn't worked. I still can login as \"kaleb\" (and as \"apple2\"), and the name of my home folder is still \"kaleb\" although the user is called \"apple2\". On the command line, the username is \"kaleb\". However, in Systems Preferences there is only evidence of an \"apple2\" user.\nWhat can I do to get rid of \"kaleb\" and have all permissions, pointers, names etc. under the name \"apple2\"?\n\nA: You will need a third account to do this trick fully.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make an admin account named differently than the final short name you wish to have in the filesystem for /Users/apple2 (the desired \"perfect user\" with everything matching).\n\n*Log in to the admin account and make one last backup of your system.\n\n*Delete only the account you wish to keep - being careful to keep the home folders - do not let the system delete this home folder, just delete the account without changing the home folder.\n\n*Open terminal and use this command exactly (unless you start with something other than kaleb and end with something other than apple2:  \nsudo mv /Users/kaleb\\ \\(Deleted\\)/ /Users/apple2 \nThis command uses the \\ character to escape the space and the parentheses so be careful to paste it exactly or [chat] here or elsewhere with someone that knows how the unix command line works if you have any doubt about how it will rename one folder by moving it.\nYou can really mess things up in terminal with sudo if you are not prepared to wipe everything and reinstall the OS and restore from a backup.\nNow when you (re)create the apple2 user the OS will fix the ownership of the home folder and the short name will match the directory and the long name by making all three \"apple2\". \n\nMy process differs slightly from Apple's in HT1428: OS X: How to change user account name or home directory name in that they enable / disable the root user where I just make a new admin account. Apple has you rename the folder on the fly while logged in as root and then creates the new account - so your renamed account will get UID 502. I delete the account (but not the files) so that your renamed account gets UID 501. None of this really matters - you just want to have a backup in case either process fails you - both will get your short name and new account back in sync.\n", "Q: Sync Number files between 2 different iCloud accounts I have a primary iCloud account that has a numbers spreadsheet in it and I would like to have a copy of that same numbers spreadsheet in a secondary iCloud account.  It doesn't seem like this is possible unless I am missing something.\n\nA: I log into https://www.icloud.com/#iwork on my Mac to log into a secondary iCloud account and upload / download documents since the Mac (as well as iOS devices) only allows one iCloud sign in per user account.\nOn iOS only, you can push the file to a general file bucket app and then sign out of iCloud, sign in to the new account, push the file back. This involves manual clean up, selection of another app, and manual signing in and out olympics so it's clearly not an ideal thing for anything but a very rare event.\nOn my iOS devices, both Dropbox and AirSharing are apps I use and would be ideal to hold an iWork document outside of iCloud storage while you are switching settings. I suppose you could attach the file to an email draft as well - but I prefer the above apps if you must do this only on iOS.\n", "Q: How do I make terminal sessions resume on Lion with iterm2 and tcshrc My understanding is that with Lion my terminal windows should restore their state.  However, this does not happen for me.  I wonder if this is because I use tcsh instead of bash?\nIs there something I can do to make my iterm2 sessions resume where they left off?\nMy current attempt to do this has been to use\n alias precmd 'if ( $?TERM_PROGRAM && ${TERM_PROGRAM} == \"iTerm.app\" ) /opt/local/libexec/gnubin/echo -ne \"\\033];$cwd\\007\"'\n set prompt = '%{\\e]2;%~\\a%}%S[%m:%c3] %n%#%s '\n\nBut this sets only the labels of the tabs.  The label of the window gets the abbreviated filenames with ~ in place of the full filename.  I don't know if this is related to my failure to get terminal resumption.  At any rate, when I quit and restart all my terminal windows and tabs are back in my home directory.\nExtra bonus points would be a solution that is sensitive to use of slogin.\nI am unable to get the correct resumption behavior with the built-in Apple Terminal, either, when I change the above to\nif ( $?TERM_PROGRAM && ( ${TERM_PROGRAM} == \"iTerm.app\" || ${TERM_PROGRAM} == \"Apple_Terminal\") ) then\n  alias precmd ' /opt/local/libexec/gnubin/echo -ne \"\\033];$cwd\\007\"'\n  set prompt = '%{\\e]2;%~\\a%}%S[%m:%c3] %n%#%s '\nendif\n\nI don't return to the same working directory, and while I can see the command history, I cannot use it (I can't use ^P to move up, e.g., and the history command returns nothing).  So I believe somehow this is not working with tcsh, as opposed to bash.  My colleagues assure me that they don't lose the working directory upon application exit.\n\nA: You could add something like this to the startup script of your default shell (mine is zsh, most people use bash, I guess, so you may have to tweak.)\nHere's my bit of screen jiggery-pokery (in my .zshrc)\n# Autoload screen if we aren't in it.

I am using both Thunderbolt ports to drive two third-party monitors via DVI.\nSometimes (at least 3-4 times a week) after the display goes to sleep when I walk away from my desk, when I return one of the monitors won't come back up. OSX acts like it thinks the monitor is still active - it appears in the arrangement dialog and windows are still positioned over there. But the monitor itself says it is not receiving a signal.\nThe only way I've found to fix this problem is to disconnect both Thunderbolt ports and reconnect them. Just reseating the one with the issue does not fix it.\nIs there a way to prevent this, or at the very least, fix it without having to constantly unplug-replug both monitors?\n\nA: I have this same issue on my iMac 27\" (Mid 2011) with one external DVI monitor. I took the iMac into the Apple store and the genius couldn't provide an answer to why this was occurring. I also tried using both Thunderbolt ports and the issue would happen on both. So for now what I did was to not let my iMac go into sleep mode. I set it to just have the display's go to black and when I activate the iMac the external display always comes back. Hoping a future update to Mountain Lion OS X 10.8 will fix this issue.\n", "Q: Internet Sharing Issues (WiFi to Ethernet) For some reason my internet sharing has decided to stop working. It was perfectly fine about a day ago, no issues, no hiccups, but today it differs. It won't work at all. \nI'm connecting my MacBook Pro Early 2011 model (Running 10.8.2) to a Windows computer via ethernet (I'm still waiting for the wireless card to come). It was working without an issue until I unplugged my MacBook Pro while Internet Sharing was on. Now when I connect it again (while IS is on) it will show connectivity on the Mac, but no internet on Windows. Here is what I see when the cable is connected (to both machines) and Internet Sharing is on:\n\n... and the following: \n\nAs you can see the option \"Share Your Connection From\" is for some strange reason blank, and yes, I have tried countless times to turn it off, click Wifi, and turn it back on. When done so the \"WiFi\" will only display on the dropdown-list until I close the Internet Sharing option. \nI have also noticed that even when I don't have Internet Sharing on, my MacBook Pro still connects to the ethernet and actually states: \"Ethernet is currently active and has the IP address 169.254.16.1.\"\nI would appreciate any help, thank you in advance.\n\nA: I don't have a definitive answer, but I've got some ideas to start, and perhaps we can narrow it down as you try some things and provide more information.\n\n\n*\n\n*For starters, check the lock status of the Sharing Preferences. The lock icon in the bottom left corner should be open when you make changes. I've run into some problems where the interface would allow me to make changes, but they wouldn't save because it was locked.\n\n*\n\n*If it is open, set up sharing as you would, then lock it after. See if that makes the configuration stick.\n\n*Try removing /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.nat.plist (you may want to make a backup copy just in case). Then try re-enabling Internet Sharing (which should regenerate that plist file). It's possible something got corrupted in the configuration file.\n\n\n", "Q: Podcast list missing all dates I have one specific podcast (Reasonable Doubts Podcast) that used to work correctly in iOS5, but since the upgrade to iOS6 with the standalone Podcast app, all the episodes are missing their dates, and sort in alphabetical order (fairly useless).\nI've unsubscribed, deleted, and re-subscribed, and the problem still occurs. Is this a bug? User error? Something the Doubtcast folks need to fix with the feed on their end?\nCan someone confirm whether the same problem happens for this specific podcast on your device? (Mine is a 32GB iPhone 5).\n\nA: Same here (iPhone 4S, iOS 6.0.1), dates are missing:\n\nalthough other podcasts are shown with release date:\n\nOn the other hand, and quite surprinsingly, the podcast is shown correctly in iTunes:\n\nAccording to https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3120228 the missing release date could be caused by an incorrect pubDate element.\nHowever, Reasonable Doubts' RSS feed correctly formats the pubDate element as described in the RSS specification and RFC 822. But what about the rest of the XML file? A syntax error could prevent an RSS reader from successfully parsing the RSS feed and extracting the date information.\nLuckily, the W3C provides at http://validator.w3.org/appc/ a feed validation service, which checks compliance with the RSS specification. And W3C is clear, Reasonable Doubts doesn't validate:\n\nApparently iOS 5 and iTunes are more tolerant than iOS 6 with some \"broken\" RSS feeds like the Reasonable Doubts podcast. \n(As a side note: I found a podcast which looked perfectly right in iOS 6 although not having the day of the week in pubDate, so that wasn't the culprit, as I first (wrongly) suspected. I also found other podcasts with a missing release date (like here and here). The reason for it in these cases is indeed a non compliant pubDate element.)\n", "Q: Will using iTunes Match with a large music library use up all the storage space on my iPhone? I have 100 GB of music on my MacBook Pro and I have an iPhone 4. If I sign up to iTunes Match will all this music flood my phone?\n\nA: In short, no. When you turn on iTunes Match on your phone, nothing happens automatically. The key setting is in Settings -> Music:\n\n\n*\n\n*Show All Music - if this is turned on, all music that you've uploaded to iTunes Match appears in the Music app on your iPhone. However, this music is not actually present in your phone's storage. If Show All Music is turned off, only music that is in your phone's storage appears in the Music app.\n\n\nOnce the Music app is showing your iTunes Match music, there are two ways these tracks will actually be stored on your iPhone:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you just start playing music, it will by default stream the track from Apple's servers (if you're not on a Wifi network, it will only do this if the Settings -> iTunes & App Stores -> Use Cellular Data setting is on). When you stream a track, it will be downloaded to your iPhone and subsequently stored.\n\n*If you tap the download button that appears when you view Albums or Playlists, the associated tracks will begin downloading from Apple's servers, to be stored on your iPhone.\n\n\nIn both cases, you retain control over what actually takes up space on your phone: only the music that you either choose to play or explicitly download. There are two other details worth noting here:\n\n\n*\n\n*I believe that, when space on your iPhone starts to get limited, iTunes Match tracks that have been streamed to your device may be deleted from storage to reclaim space (the idea being that you can always stream them again). I don't know whether or not tracks that you explicitly chose to download will also be cleaned up in this way.\n\n*If the Settings -> iTunes & App Stores -> Automatic Downloads settings are on, your phone will automatically download new songs (or apps, or books) that you purchase on your other devices. However, your existing purchases will not be downloaded automatically.\n\n", "Q: Can I avoid windows snapping to main screen when I briefly lose my second screen? I have a Macbook Pro and almost always use it with an external, larger monitor, which I have set up so that it is right above the MBP's built in screen.  I have this same setup at home and at work.  This is my arrangement:\n\nwith the Dock at the bottom of the lower (built-in MBP) screen.  Usually I have most of my important windows positioned in the upper (external monitor) screen.  This provides the best ergonomics for me because I can look straight ahead instead of down.\nWhen I leave one of these locations the MBP goes to sleep.  Then when I plug in at the other location, there is usually a moment (maybe 5 seconds) where the external monitor is not plugged in.  If that moment is too long, then all my windows reposition into the lower, built-in MBP screen.  Sometimes the windows end up shrunk in height to be very short as well.  So then, if I want to get back to where I was I have to drag all my windows (for umpteen apps) back up into the upper screen and expand the shrunken ones.\nIs there any way to avoid this?  For example, can I cause the windows to have a preferred location that they could snap back to when possible?\nI'm on OSX Lion (10.7.5).  This is a 15-inch MBP, new in spring 2011.\n\nA: Stay should solve this for you.  It's not free, but it's not expensive either.\n", "Q: Can I upgrade my iPhone from iOS 4.2.1 to iOS 5? iTunes only shows iOS 6 I have an iPhone 4 with iOS 4.2.1. I want to upgrade my iPhone to iOS 5, but iTunes will only let me upgrade the iPhone to iOS 6. I'd prefer not to, since many important apps don't work in India, especially Maps. Is it possible to upgrade my iPhone to iOS 5?\n\nA: You can download old versions of iOS from this page (the downloads are direct from Apple, this site just collects the links). Make sure to get the proper file for your phone (likely iPhone 4 (GSM)).\nIt's important to note that just having the old version isn't enough. Before installing any OS upgrades, the iPhone checks Apple's servers for an authorization code. Apple stops authorizing older versions some time after the next major version is released, so you may be out of luck.\nYou can try upgrading by going into iTunes, and option-clicking (shift-click in Windows) the Update button for your device. You should get a file dialog, from which you can select the .ipsw file you just downloaded. You should then be able to go through the usual updating process, assuming Apple authorizes it.\n", "Q: How could I message a dumb phone and an iPad at the same time I have an iPhone and my friend has a regular old dumb phone and an iPad.  At school, she has no cell service, but she does have wifi on her iPad.  Everywhere else she has her phone, but doesn't carry her iPad, so I have no idea which device to message.  \nIs there an app or service I could use that would message both at once and keep the conversation intact on all of our devices?\n\nA: You can send a text message to multiple recipients at once with the built-in Messages app. Just send a message to both her cellphone's number and her iPad's email address.\n\nA: Groupme is a handy group/topical message app that allows you to create \"groups\" like \"My family\", \"Pictures of Griffin\", \"My Bocce Discussion Group\" on the fly.\nYou can access it through a web client, or through dedicated iOS and android apps.\nEach group is essentially a private chat room for the people you invite, who can post messages, locations, or pictures that the entire group can see.\nIt's much more useful than I'd have guessed when you have a group that shares an interest or temporal event (it's awesome for people at a wedding or bachelor party to keep track of what everyone's up to.)\n(If you ever used Beluga before Facebook ingested it, it's basically the same thing.)\n", "Q: Use launchd to start VMware's VM on VNC connection I have a VM (VMware Fusion) with enabled VNC access. I want to be able to access it from the network. Unfortunately, VMware requires VM to be running to be able to accept VNC connections and vmware-vmx is the process that listens on VNC port.\nMy idea was to have launchd job that will run desired VM when something comes to the port.\nI've ended up with the following launchd job:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.kulakov.vm.development</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/usr/local/bin/vmw</string>\n        <string> </string>\n    </array>\n    <key>StandardOutPath</key>\n    <string>/Users/kentzo/Desktop/com.kulakov.vm.development.log</string>\n    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>\n    <string>/Users/kentzo/Desktop/com.kulakov.vm.development.log</string>\n    <key>Sockets</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>NetworkListener</key>\n        <dict>\n            <key>SockServiceName</key>\n            <string>5906</string>\n            <key>SockType</key>\n            <string>stream</string>\n        </dict>\n    </dict>\n    <key>Debug</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\n/usr/local/bin/vmw:\n#!/bin/bash\n/Applications/VMware\\ Fusion.app/Contents/Library/vmrun -T fusion start \"$1\" nogui\n\nThe problem is that launchd listens on the port and I have to stop this before I can run VM. The only way to stop it to listen on the port I've found so far is to unload the job. Unfortunately it also stops the job itself and prevents VM from launching.\nIs it possible to somehow tell launchd to stop listening on a port within the daemon?\n\nA: Your problem here is that if launchd is going to listen on the VNC port, well, then it's going to get the traffic on the VNC port.  The approved ways for a daemon program to deal with this are either to expect the network traffic on StdIn and StdOut or to collect a list of file descriptors from launchd and use one of those for the network communication.  Otherwise the client is going to create a connection and then see the connection closed by launchd while it starts up the daemon. \nI suggest you have launchd listen on another port and spawn a simple program that just pipes input to /dev/null while also launching the VM.  So then to start the VM you telnet to this special port. \nOr, you know, the easy thing to do is just always have the VM running. :-)\n", "Q: Importing Facebook events into Calendar on Mac iOS 6.0 brought iOS calendar syncing with Facebook, which is very convenient.

When we have a multi sheet(page) workbook(document), with both landscape and portrait pages, an error occurs when we try to go to export to a PDF file (file > print > pdf). Instead of generating a multipage PDF file Excel will generate each sheet as a pdf. We can of course combine these back into 1 PDF file once generated in Adobe Acrobat,but it's a fiddly work around for something thats pretty basic and works fine (generates a single PDF file with all pages) in the Windows version of Excel. \nI've attached a sample excel file if you want to see the problem first hand. : - https://www.dropbox.com/s/enrgch3znd4z89n/sample%20excel.xlsx\n\nA: This appears to be a limitation of the PDF generator within OSX itself. It appears as though the behavior has been present in OSX versions 10.5 Leopard, 10.6 Snow Leopard, 10.7 Lion and 10.8 Mountain Lion. According to posts within the Microsoft Excel 2011 support pages (here, here and here) when you initiate the print to PDF command from within Excel 2011 the program hands off the actual generation of said PDF to the operating system. On the surface it appears as though OSX is interpreting the page orientations differently and outputting as separate PDF files. I checked through the known issues with Microsoft Excel 2011 to see if there is an outstanding bug for this behavior but nothing seems readily apparent. The support pages contain references to different methodologies to get around the problem such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Automator workflows\n\n*VBA Scripts\n\n*Combing the resulting PDF documents within Preview\n\n*3rd party software to perform the actual generation (Adobe\nAcrobat, PDFwriter, etc..)\n\n\nThe information available reports varying degrees of success depending on what solution you ultimately end up choosing. All the solutions seem to be more of the same shim type work arounds with no easy / native (within Excel 2011) solution.\n", "Q: iPad to view LAN local domains? I have multiple local domains (i.e. localtest.local) that my iPad cannot see.  My machine name, alpha.local, has Apache directives to a \"site\" I have on the box.

Any ideas how I can get my iPad to see localtest.local?\n\nA: Truth is you should have a local DNS Server that you share out using DHCP to all your clients.  This way you can manage local DNS records on your local network.  I will confess there might be a better way, but this is what came to mind off the top of my head\n", "Q: With Microsoft RDP client, how do I mark a particular server certificate as trusted? I am using Microsoft's RDC client on Mac OS X, to connect to a Windows server.  I am connecting to a RDC server that uses a self-signed certificate to identify itself.  As a consequence, when I connect, my RDC client gives me a warning dialog like this:\n\nI can click \"Connect\" to continue, but then I have no security against man-in-the-middle attack, because \"Connect\" instructs my client to ignore the server cert.  I want to continue to connect, but in a way that is secure.\nAnother option is to go to the Microsoft RDC client's preferences pane:\n\nand switch to \"Always connect, even if authentication fails\".  This way, I'm never shown the warning again: it's as if I automatically clicked \"Connect\" every time.  However, again, this is not secure: it skips authenticating the server, and thus is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.\nI want to be secure.  Therefore, neither of the two approaches above is satisfactory.\nConceptually, the obvious path forward is to somehow gain access to the server's self-signed certificate, and then ask the RDC client to treat it as trusted and never warn me about that certificate again.  This would be secure (like SSH).  However, I can't figure out how to get my RDC client to do that.\nHow do I arrange for this server's certificate to be treated as trusted (despite the fact that it is self-signed), and have the system never warn me about connections that use that particular certificate, but still provide security (e.g., warn me if the certificate changes)?\n\nA: I looked into this a bit, and in my case the issue was on the RDP Server side.  The certificate it was using was actually a self-signed, automatically generated one that was not signed by my local CA's root certificate.  It thus didn't matter where I put the root cert, I always got the pop-up saying \"The Certificate is not trusted...\"\nI installed the root cert from my local CA in the System keychain and set it to Always Trust, then on the Windows Server side, using Administrative Tools -> Remote Desktop Services -> Remote Desktop Session Host configuration, I updated the certificate assigned to the RDP-Tcp connection.   Right-click RDP-Tcp Connection, choose Properties.  On the General tab, see at the bottom there's a link labelled \"Auto-generated\"\n(see an image of the pane here: http://www.windowsecurity.com/img/upl/image0021281709633474.jpg)\nThat's the self-signed certificate.  Clicking Select lets you choose any other certificate already on the machine.  Once that change was made, the prompt was gone from the client side on the next login.\nHope this helps (though it really only helps if you have admin access on the Windows side...)\n\nA: Adding to the System keychain, set to \"Always trusted\", worked like a charm for me.\n", "Q: Can I configure and start TIme Machine from the commandLine I have a problem with my MacBookPro, the left click button on (any) mouse and the trackpad doesnt respond to any clicks, so the only thing that works properly is the keybaord.\nI havent been able to solve the issue so I am taking my labtop to an Apple store on Friday, but I fear they may need to send it away and may wipe the disk so Id really like a backup of the machine.\nBut although I have backups of my most immportant docs I have never used Time Machine and dont have a backup of the whole thing. So Id really like to do a backup but I cannot seem to configure anything in the Time Machine preferences with only the keyboard, is there a commandline equivalent that I can use ?\n\nA: As of OS 10.7, you can control Time Machine from the command line. The command line tool is called (and is called with) tmutil. Open up the Terminal, which is located in your /Applications/Utilities folder. It will be easy to get there if, From the Finder, you type Shift+Command+G, which brings up a sheet where you can type the destination path to the Terminal (copy and paste this): /Applications/Utilities.  \nAfter the Terminal opens, and at the prompt, type man tmutil, which will get you the manual page for tmutil outlining all the commands and options available. It's quite extensive, and more than can be covered in a single answer, but examples might be:\n\nTurn on Time Machine backups:\ntmutil enable\nSet the destination to be used as backup:\ntmutil setdestination... (this has options that can be added to specify destination information and type)\nStart a full backup to a drive:\ntmutil startbackup -d /Volumes/Name_Of_Your_Backup_Disk\n\nYou must carefully read this manual all the way through and understand the terminology before beginning. The manual is also available online at Apple's manpages reference area. You can read it here, and there is a good primer on Simon Heimlicher's site with much better examples than what I've given above. \nAs with all command line tools, USE CAUTION. You will have to run most of these as root as well, which means that you're granting yourself power to do lots of potentially nasty things to your computer. In the case of tmutil, though you're unlikely to do much damage as you have to correctly specify a destination before it'll actually do anything. Probably the greatest hazard would be if you'd already set a destination you could accidentally erase it; since you have no destination, though, that's not going to happen. \nGood luck getting your backup going and with getting your machine fixed!\n", "Q: Find my iPhone useless in case of stole? \nPossible Duplicate:\nLost iPhone, what action to take? \n\nConsider this scenario:\n\n\n*\n\n*A thief stole my iPhone. \n\n*I disable my iphone on www.icloud.com\n\n*The thief in the meanwhile reinstall iOS \n\n\nDoes Find my iPhone is useful in this scenario?\n\nA: If you wipe the phone, no.\nIf they wipe the phone, no.\nI'm going to close this, but feel free to flag or edit it if you feel there is something missing from these answers.\n", "Q: App or Script to Move a Window Between Desktops With Only a Keyboard Shortcut? I need a way to move a window between desktops in Lion/Mountain Lion with a keyboard shortcut only (i.e. no mouse involvement). From this similar question, I'm aware that it can be done by holding down the title bar of a window and activating the Move to Left/Right Space shortcut, but that doesn't meet my requirements.\nI don't much care how it's achieved, as long as it's relatively efficient and can be activated by a keyboard shortcut (if it's just a script, that's fine, I can assign a keyboard shortcut to it another way).\n\nA: Thanks to Lauri Ranta finding some further related questions that I didn't, I came across SizeUp, which does what I'm looking for (and several other window management tasks). I was hoping to find a more lightweight solution (I already have one window manager running full time in the background), but this will do for now. It's also unclear how well it works in Mountain Lion. I've only tested under 10.7 so far, but I saw some reports that it had issues in 10.8, but nothing definitive.\nIf anyone comes up with a different/more lightweight (i.e. an app that just does this, or a script), I'll mark that as the accepted answer, but for the moment it's SizeUp.\n\nA: I use a helper app called Moom ($10 on the Mac App Store) to move and size windows. It can move windows between desktops too, as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*« your chosen key combo to activate Moom »\n\n*Left or Right Arrow fills left/right half of screen\n\n*Left or Right Arrow moves one screen left/right, still filling left/right half\n\n*(optionally) Space makes window fullscreen\nEdit: in fact I've just noticed that ^ + arrow keys will move windows between screens. Even easier.\nThere may well be other apps that do the job more efficiently, but Moom offers quite a few neat features besides and I'm very happy with it.\n\nA: It doesn't work for all applications, not even all native Apple ones (which I find perplexing), but here's a possible solution.  \n\n\n*\n\n*One-time mouse use: control/right click on the application icon of interest to bring up its contextual menu.  \n\n*Click Options, which brings up another contextual menu  \n\n*Under Assign To, you have four choices: All Desktops, This Desktop, Desktop X (where \"X\" is the number of desktops you've created), and None. \n\n\nHere's a screenshot:\n\nFrom there you choose what fits your needs. I assign certain applications (e.g., nvALT2, iTerm2) to All Desktops because I use them pretty much wherever I am working, and just hide them using command + H when they're not needed. Of course I might misunderstand what you are asking, and/or your use case might be different. If you're looking for a universal, only-as-needed solution then this won't be for you. Otherwise it's great: switching desktops using control + R/L arrows or  option + desktop number pulls the window with you. \n", "Q: Is there a difference between factory unlocked and carrier unlocked? I just successfully unlocked an old AT&T iPhone 4 and 4S using AT&T's unlock process. They are not jailbroken. As I've gone online to sell the phones, the selling phrase is \"Factory Unlocked.\" Is there any difference between factory unlocked and my successful \"carrier unlock\"? If so, what are the differences?\n\nA: Good question. \nYes, there is a bit of a difference, though I largely agree with bmike. I guess I should add that while there might not be a difference in the outward functionality of the phone, there are differences between the phones provided by carriers, the procedure used to unlock those, and the unlocked iPhone sold by Apple. \nThis past July, I went through the same unlock procedure that you did when my wife's parents gave her an iPhone 4S that was sent to them by AT&T via an insurance policy that replaced a phone they believed was lost. Anyway, their phone was located right after the new one came in the mail, so they gave it to her. The problem was that we are on Verizon, so we couldn't use the phone. I wrongly believed it was the \"world\" iPhone that Apple sold, so I went through the process of getting AT&T to unlock it. Unfortunately for me, I didn't pay close enough attention to the rear of the packaging, which clearly indicated that this was a GSM-only phone. Undaunted, I called the nearest Apple Store to arrange an exchange for a CDMA phone - a simple enough thing, right? After all, it was still in the shrink wrap. I spoke with the store manager, gave her the serial number of the phone, and was shortly informed that this was not a phone stocked by Apple stores. The kind of phone I had was marked to be sold only by AT&T, either out of their retail establishments or shipping centers. I called AppleCare, and they informed me of the same thing. As it turned out, no one would even accept a brand-new, still-in-the-shrink-wrap, Apple iPhone 4S. Apple could not take it's own, brand new product in return for an essentially identical device. Only AT&T could accept it as a return, and they obviously didn't have any CDMA capable phones to send in exchange. Ultimately we sent the phone back to my in-laws, and ended up purchasing our iPhone 4S devices directly through Verizon. \nTo add to all this as sort of a general FYI, the unlocked iPhone sold by Apple is not the same thing as the \"world\" model, either. From Apple's Web Site regarding the unlocked iPhone:\n\nThe unlocked iPhone includes all the features of iPhone but without a wireless contract commitment. You can activate and use iPhone on the supported GSM wireless network of your choice, such as AT&T in the United States. The unlocked iPhone 4, iPhone 4S and iPhone 5 will not work with CDMA-based carriers such as Verizon Wireless or Sprint.\n\nAnd here is the info for the \"world\" iPhone from the \"tech specs\" page:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*World phone  \n  \n*UMTS/HSDPA/HSUPA (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz);\n  GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz)  \n  \n*802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi (802.11n 2.4GHz only)  \n  \n*Bluetooth 4.0 wireless technology\n  \n\nThe reason for posting all of this is both as a response to your question and as a general information filter for prospective buyers. \n\nA: No. Both mean that the carriers have agreed that this device will be registered into a database that Apple uses to unlock the device when it gets restored and powered on the first time (and the first time after major software upgrades).\nI suppose some people say Factory unlocked when it is sold with a carrier unlock and the latter can be accomplished at any time if it is originally sold to a consumer as carrier-locked.\nSomeone buying wouldn't care either way since the devices work the same and would both still be unlocked if you took either to Apple for an exchange service if it needed a repair.\n", "Q: First-time iCloud backup of my iPhone took 26 hours The first time my iPhone backed up with iCloud, it took 26 hours. It seems like a really long time but I do have a lot of video. How long should this take?\n\nA: Honestly it depends on what you consider to be a LOT of videos.  Truthfully a 64 GB Phone filled on a standard Wifi home network should not take more than 10-15 hours at most.  Truth is the easiest way to see what is going on is go to www.icloud.com and check out your icloud space available.\nThe other thing to take into account is that you only get 5GB Free. You might have run out of space on iCloud and you didnt get the notifications.\n", "Q: Frequent, lengthy voice recording damaging to iPhone? \nPossible Duplicate:\nApple iPhone 4 flash memory \n\nI have an iPhone 4S and lately I've been seeking a way to record some class lectures. Today, I decided to try out using the Voice Memos app on my iPhone and I was absolutely stunned by the quality.\nHowever, if I use my iPhone I'll be recording 1/4GB - 1GB every weekday for the foreseeable future and I'm worried the frequent data read/write will damage my iPhone. I know that flash drives will die after 1000 read/writes, and I'm pretty sure that iPhone's memory is flash-based. I'll need to keep my phone healthy for another year.\nWill frequent, intensive daily R/W kill the phone?\n\nA: Not likely. Use your phone to do whatever you want to do with it.\nPer iFixit's teardown there's a Toshiba MLC NAND flash chip in there. You've got at least 10,000 write cycles for the flash, which means you could fill the phone up 10,000 times before you had any problems. If you're figuring a gigabyte of recording each day, a 16GB phone gives you 40+ years of recording time.\n(If somebody can find a datasheet for the part, you could confirm the potential number of write cycles. My 10,000 is an educated guess based on typical MLC.)\n", "Q: What to do when Time Machine backup is taking forever? Yesterday I bought a 500Gb external USB drive for the sole purpose of backing up my laptop, which has 45Gb of data. After turning on Time Machine, it began the first backup, but after an hour or so reported there was still 4 hours to go. I had to pack up, so I aborted the backup.\nThis morning I requested Time Machine to do a backup, and now 3 hours later it tells me it has backed up only 156Mb, and there is 42 days to go!?!\nI can't believe this is right, so the questions are:\nWhat is going on?\nWhat is the best way to deal with it?\n\nA: Aborting a backup like that sometimes has unfortunate consequences. If this is your initial backup, consider erasing the backup drive and starting over before you go to sleep. That way, the drive can run overnight without you having to worry about leaving before it's finished. \nAlso make sure that the drive is correctly formatted as as HFS+ extended journaled, with a GUID partitioning scheme. \n", "Q: How can I get System Information's \"Installations\" and such to correctly reflect the software I currently have?

Pls advise.\n\nA: The flat files method of saving receipts was ended in 10.5 Leopard.\nFor Snow Leopard systems and later, the package receipts are stored in a database at /Library/Packages/db, so you'll want to use pkgutil to query and manipulate the receipts inside the database. It's probably a sqlite store, but the man page and all books I've read strongly recommend using pkgutil\n pkgutil --packages #to list the installed packages\n\nAnd once you've assembled a list of packaged to delete you can pass them into the tool and instruct it to forget those packages.\n pkgutil --forget com.apple.pkg.HP_Chuckwalla\n\nReading in the pkgutil man page as well as Peachpit Advanced System Administration book should cover any options I forgot to mention.\n", "Q: How can I transfer songs between Garageband for iOS and OS X? I have Garageband on iPad, iPhone and OS X. How can I transfer the music between them? I have enabled iCloud with iPad and iPhone but cannot understand how to get the music from there to OS X?

My laptop was fine just yesterday !! But today, I found this on my screen :\n\nThe unfocused image shows that the pixels are glowing in different colors. Shouldnt this indicate that there is some power going there and that it is not completely dead ?\nI am not sure if this is a stuck or dead pixel. I tried JScreenFix and it didnt really work ... I tried pressuring/massaging the area with a cloth but that didnt do anything either.\nHere is a video with different background colors :\nhttps://dl.dropbox.com/u/695335/pixel.mov\nYou might want to pause at some frames to get whats going on.\nWhat is this exactly ??\nIs it a dead pixel ? Can I fix it ? I am in the middle of studies so I can't really send it back to Apple !! Plus I got modules installed for Python and it is a hassle to install them all again.\n\nUpdate\nIts a dead pixel, got it repaired at the Genius Bar :\nCan I trust Apple Store's employees with my laptop?\n\n\nA: Some general advice - finish your school work and get a good backup as your computer can wait for a week to get service. If you can, call Apple and get the incident on the record now - just in case your warranty expires in the next day or two it's a lot easier to get someone to bend the end date if you did your part in letting them know you want help and have a reasonable situation to not bring it in.\nThat being said - if you really need this and your Warranty is ending and you don't want to depend on the kindness of someone extending that deadline - get it in for service if that is the most important thing.\nAs to the problem itself - it's pretty clear that you have a large white spot the size of about 16 complete pixel elements. Since LCD panels have back lit white light and several layers to prevent that light from escaping, it looks like those layers have broken down or not been formed in the first place. Both manufacturing imperfections and failure can cause sub pixel bright spots and even rows of failures if the control wires fail - but for a round spot like this to fail, the cause is almost always a physical damage that cracks the several layers of polarizer and lets light through the LCD assembly despite the transistor signals calling for the pixels to be dark like the surrounding area.\nI would expect warranty to cover that sort of thing on either very new equipment or when there is absolutely no sign of external force and the company was being very lenient in not presuming that this was physical damage. I just can't see most people not noticing that size of a defect in a LCD panel at the time of manufacture or when you first started up the mac and had a dark background showing.\nI would arrange for service at your earliest convenience - and if it gets repaired under warranty, great. If not, you'll know what a paid repair will cost and you can decide what to do with your time and money. I would ask them to quite you the in-warranty and out of warranty costs if you need to send the Mac in and can't let a trained technician look at it first hand.\nIn the mean time, you can see more about how sub-pixels are arranged on iOS devices and perhaps that will help you relate to the picture you took of the larger pixel areas on your screen.\nAnd certainly don't try to fix it unless you want to put in a new LCD as a DIY or repair by someone that does that sort of thing. There's a lot of nonsense about massaging pixels and this would get worse if you push on the display - not better.\n\nA: Try running:\nioreg -lw0 | grep \\\"EDID\\\" | sed \"/[^<]*</s///\" | xxd -p -r | strings -6\nin Terminal. You will get output like the following:\nColor LCD\nLSN154YL01001\nDLM2347000V******\n\n(not sure what the third code is, so I starred out the last 6 chars just in case)\nIf the second line does not start with LS, you have an LG panel which have been the source of many, many problems (tons of them are bad, and quality is generally inferior).\nIf it does start with LS, you have a Samsung panel, but either way it sounds like you've got a bad one. I also noticed some dark spots nearby in your video, so you should be due for a replacement... however you'll need to back up the computer because when you replace a Retina MBP, you replace the entire unit, not just a part (usually). That's why iFixIt gave it such a terrible repair score.\n\nA: To me, this appears to be a stuck sub-pixel.  Since the pixel(s) are not completely dark, and instead continuously on with a certain color, it seems to be a stuck sub-pixel.\nWikipedia describes stuck sub-pixels:\n\nStuck sub-pixels\nA stuck sub-pixel is a pixel that is always \"on\".\nThis is usually caused by a transistor that is not getting any power,\nand is therefore continuously allowing light at that point to pass\nthrough to the RGB layer. This means that any given pixel will stay\nred, blue, or green, and will not change when attempting to display an\nimage. These pixels may only show up using certain applications, or\nthey may be on all of the time.\n\nIt should be repairable without any hardware involvement. You tried JScreenFix, but how long did you use it for?  I would suggest turning off Display Sleep in System Preferences under Energy Saver and leaving JScreenFix to do its work for ~1 hour or so (or at least 20 minutes). Note that the Fix tab, that uses JScreenFix's algorithm for fixing stuck pixels, requires a $3.25 RefundWare license (if it doesn't work, it is refunded).\nIf this doesn't work, and any other software doesn't either, see this question for Apple replacement.  Since it looks like more than one pixel is stuck, you have more reason to argue for your case (but be sure to be nice to the Genius assisting you, according to this answer). And if you're worried about your Python modules lost (or anything else, for that matter), remember that Time Machine is always built-in and is easy to set up.\n", "Q: Are 17″ MacBook Pro for sale by Apple? I have a 2010 Macbook Pro 17″\nIt does not have a Thunderbolt port. I believe about a year ago Apple released a 17\" that had a thunderbolt port. I was thinking about upgrading to a newer 17\" model but there is now 17\" macbooks in the Apple Store. I want a new Mac, not anything from the refurbished section.\n\nI checked MacRumors and there is no news about a newer 17\". I also heard that a 17\" with retina display seemed pretty impossible - because of the price / technology limitations etc.\nDoes Apple still sell a 17 inch portable Mac?\n\nA: Here's your answer:\nApple discontinues 17 inch MacBook Pro\nFrom the site:\n\n\"But if you’re looking for a reason why Apple offed the 17-inch now, you need go no further than the 15-inch Retina display MacBook Pro. Not only does it offer the most cutting edge technology of any Apple laptop to date, but its 2880-by-1800 pixel display outstrips the 17-inch’s 1920-by-1200 resolution with room to spare. Add in the fact that the new MacBook Pro is thinner and lighter—to the tune of more than 2 pounds—and it seems pretty clear that the Retina display model is the new target for what a powerhouse portable should be.\"\n\n\nA: Apple discontinued the 17\" MacBook Pro when they announced the 15\" Retina MBP. It's fairly unlikely they'll make another one any time soon (probably never, if I were putting money on it). You may be able to get one refurbished or from a third party reseller with stock left.\n", "Q: No sidebar in finder when viewing DFS shares When viewing a DFS share in OS X 10.7 or on a system that has been upgraded from 10.7 to 10.8 the sidebar is missing in finder.\nHowever if a system has had a fresh install of OS X 10.8 the sidebar is visible in finder.\nIs there a way to get the sidebar back in 10.7 or a system that has gone from 10.7 to 10.8?\n\nA: What type of volume you're viewing doesn't have an impact on the Finder's display settings. You can toggle the sidebar in any Finder window by going to View → Show/Hide Sidebar or pressing ⌥⌘S.\nThe reason you're seeing it on one machine and not the other is that it likely got toggled at some point for that folder and the setting stuck. Finder does store view settings per folder, although it can be a bit inconsistent in doing so.\n\nA: I fixed this by changing the permissions on the DFS Namespace share. After allowing the proper group write permissions, the Finder Windows now save their settings properly.\n", "Q: Can I use a retina display at actual pixel size? Unfortunately I just learned that Apple is has already discontinued the 17\" MBP and Apple marketing has this quote:\n\nBut if you’re looking for a reason why Apple offed the 17-inch now, you need go no further than the 15-inch Retina display MacBook Pro. Not only does it offer the most cutting edge technology of any Apple laptop to date, but its 2880-by-1800 pixel display outstrips the 17-inch’s 1920-by-1200 resolution with room to spare\n\nThe numbers quotes are a larger pixel count than the 17 inch model allowed even with the hi-res display but I haven't played with or seen a MB retina display in person yet. Can I set the pixels to \"actual size\" so that when I do web design I can have a browser set to normal scale but see a LOT of the web page - or for that matter, any app?\nI like the idea of a Retina display but if I can't set the display to show the pixels at \"actual size\" it seems like I am in fact still losing screen real estate even though there are \"more pixels\" if that makes sense.\n\nA: Yes you can, but you probably will not choose to do so. When you really want to force the display into 2880x1800 you can easily configure it that way. Here are four of the better options available today to do what you ask:\n\n\n*\n\n*SwitchResX\n\n*Retina DisplayMenu (used to be SetResX)\n\n*scrutil\n\n*ChangeResolution\nThat said, items like the menu bar with the Apple icon are extremely small at 2880x1800 and you don't need the entire screen to at that high resolution for a properly build application to let the windows it controls have the full resolution. The scaling modes are pretty good, and you can always reduce your font sizes even while running at the doubled 1440x900 resolution. Most people will never need to set 2880x1800 since they really only care that the applications they use get the retina treatment and don't need to force the rest of the UI to run with such a dense packing of pixels.\n\nA: \nI like the idea of a Retina display but if I can't set the display to show the pixels at \"actual size\" it seems like I am in fact still losing screen real estate even though there are \"more pixels\" if that makes sense.\n\nActually, no it doesn't make sense. ;) I'll explain more below.\nFor what it's worth, the highest default \"More Space\" option on the MacBook Pro Retina is labelled \"looks like 1920x1200\" so you're really not losing screen real estate from the 17\" MacBook Pro.\n\nCan I set the pixels to \"actual size\" so that when I do web design I can have a browser set to normal scale but see a LOT of the web page - or for that matter, any app?\n\nUsing such a high density screen at \"native resolution\" would make the menu bar so small as to be useless and the text miniscule. The retina screen gives you the same \"real estate\" as a 17\" but with sharper text and photos.\nDon't worry about using \"all the pixels\". When we upgraded from dot-matrix printers to laser printers, we didn't want the laser printer to print the text with the same exact pixel grid. You'd need a magnifying glass to read it.  The paper is still 8.5x11\", just as the screen is still 15\". What's important is the screen/printer is still rendering all the pixels, but with a similar text size, so your eye cannot discern the jagged steps of the letters at reading distance.\nAnandtech has a nice gallery showing desktop \"real estate\" at the different scaling modes. I think the \"more space\" option gives a more than sufficiently large desktop.\n\nA: I found a free utility online called SetResX. Very easy. While most applications don't need the pixels, this is wonderful for viewing photos. You can't get too many pixels for photos (I mean real photos not phone pics.) the problem with the scaled resolutions that Apple provides is that they magnify pixels into visible stair steps. I think some apps, such as Safari, apply softening to make them less visible. Going to full resolution makes your images look much sharper.\n\nA: SetResX (the ancient app) actually works!\nDownload\n\nA: According to the SwitchResX FAQs:\n\nSwitchResX 4 is compatible with High Sierra beginning with version 4.6.6.\n\nSo SwitchResX 4 should work.\nRDM is on GitHub and was last updated in 2016, so it should also work with High Sierra. RDM enables setting a Mac's Retina Display to higher unsupported resolutions.\n\nA: Unfortunately you have hit one of the problems with retina displays. \nalthough some applications are set to automatically scale for the 1920x1200 resolution, some, like lightroom, can not yet show accurate pixels at that scale, so you're forced to work at a crappy 1440 pixel resolution. \nit really sucks.\n", "Q: How to navigate the Special Characters window with the keyboard?

Both would make my life easier until computer fixed, but unfortunately without a working mouse there seems to be no way of selecting these items.\nIs there a way I can set these values from the commandline, because mouse right-click and middle-click work I can open a Terminal Window and enter commands from there. \n\nA: Try this:\n$ defaults write com.apple.universalaccess mouseDriver 1\n\nAlso you can always access Spotlight by typing Command+Spacebar (unless you've changed the default keyboard shortcut for that).  From there if you type trackpad you should be able to get to your trackpad preferences.\n", "Q: How do I disable hiding of the mouse pointer while typing text? I think I'm finally annoyed enough with my mouse pointer disappearing as I start typing to want to do something about it.\nI want to move the mouse. I want to click. I want to start typing, but I want the mouse pointer to stay as is. I end up having to move the mouse just to figure out where the pointer is and I hate that.\nHow do I do this? Is this a switch I can toggle from within Mac OS or will I have to use a third-party app? I dug around System Preferences and Keyboard settings, but I didn't find anything relevant.\nI'm running Mountain Lion 10.8.2 on an iMac. At this moment, it's a Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 1000 along with the regular Apple Wireless Keyboard.\n\nA: This is the default global behavior and can't be changed through a system preference. (I can't find any third-party utilities to change this either.) \nApple's reasoning is probably that users (but not all users) don't want the mouse pointer to obscure the text while typing. A developer might work around this by using NSCursor with setHiddenUntilMouseMoves:NO or unhide, etc., but this would be considered bad form due to creating an inconsistent user experience compared to other apps. \n\nA: There are several programs that will highlight where the mouse is on a given key press;  apart from Mouse Locator mathioned above there is OmniDazzle or Mouseposé\n\nA: Mouse Locator is a (32-bit) preference pane that will allow you to set a keyboard shortcut to show where the mouse is. You can also set a trigger time in addition or in lieu of a keyboard shortcut.\n", "Q: How to can I upgrade Xcode 4.1 to 4.5.2 properly? I'm trying to get Xcode up to date... but i think i have a little problem.\nI go in the Mac App Store. I find Xcode. I click on free button, it asks me to connect with my Apple-ID. Done.\nI get the \"install\" button... I click and nothing happens. I have a loader spinning during few seconds at the right of buttons Prev/Next in the top bar... but nothing else.\nWhere is a process bar ? Mac App says to me that Xcode takes 1.50 GB but is downloading ? How can I follow the download ? Is really downloading ? Do I have to uninstall the Xcode 4.1 ?\nI am a bit lost with the changes to this program and the new App Store.\n\nA: Setting aside whether you are actually done with the prior version of Xcode (as older versions have some capabilities and older SDK that the newer versions no longer support - you might want to keep an old machine with an old Xcode around if you are supporting legacy software products - but let's assume you don't care about anything other than making new programs with the newest Xcode) let's dive in with the steps.\nTo prepare for the new Xcode, it is easiest to uninstall all previous versions of Xcode by following the uninstall documentation for each version you have installed.\nFor Xcode 4.1 you will want to run the perl script to clean things up:\nUninstalling Xcode Developer Tools\nTo uninstall Xcode developer tools on the boot volume along with the  directory, from a Terminal window type:\n$ sudo <Xcode>/Library/uninstall-devtools --mode=all\n\n\nFor the new Xcode, the App Store doesn't normally show the download progress so you must track it from Launchpad or just by watching the /Applications folder in Finder. It shows INSTALLING as depicted above, but the Launchpad view has a live progress bar and summary of the 1.61 GB download as depicted below.\n\n\nA: I just want to share my experience. I started the 4.5.2 Xcode install from the the Mac App Store and the message Installing was displayed for about 25 minutes while it installed 4.5.2.\nHowever, I did not have an Xcode icon in LaunchPad to track the progress. Also, Xcode in Finder had the old file date until the upgrade was finished.\nSo I had no clue aside from hearing my hard drive spin a few times, that there was progress until the Mac App Store message was changed to Installed when the upgrade was completed.\nThe good news though is that my patience paid off and Xcode 4.5.2 was successfully installed.\n\nA: Is there any reasons why you cannot download the latest XCode from the Apple Developer Centre directly? If you go to the Apple Developer Centre you can manually download XCode 4.5.2 and install it on your machine.  If you upgrade this way the App store will show that your XCode installation is up-to-date btw.\nIncidentally, the latest XCode installs in the Applications folder.  Check if XCode 4.1 is installed in Applications as well -- in the past XCode was installed in a special Developer folder, though I think XCode 4.x.x has always been installed in Applications.\n", "Q: Oops -- deleted swap files (Mac OS, 10.6) -- will they come back? I'm worse than my grandmother when it comes to computers. So I got a Mac as my friends  who know me and know a bit about PCs said I'd fair better with a Mac. They were right and I love my Mac Book Air.\nBut I noticed over the last couple of days that everything was running a LOT slower and that my Microsoft Excel & Powerpoint each crashed twice (which otherwise NEVER happens -- have owned it for 2 years). \nIn trying to clean up some files, I foolishly deleted swapfiles, as I was worried I had downloaded some mega files (6 files, each over 1 Gb!) from the internet (although I am cautious when it comes to downloading anything!).\nOf course only after the fact did I poke around on some forums and saw that these files seem pretty important to the running of the system. \nHow can I get them Back? Will they just come back once I start using my Mac again?  I also have a Time Machine backup, so should I look there? I\"d rather avoide re-booting everything if possible.\nFOLLOW-UP: Thanks for the answers below! I will INDEED be more cautious in the future! Real quick: re-boot is the same as re-start, correct? I hope it is, because I'm not sure if I have all the software to re-install everything. Please let me know; thanks again!\n2nd FOLLOW UP: If I have to re-boot, do you think a safe boot would suffice? Would that mean I could avoid having to re-install software, e.g., Word & Powerpoint?\n3rd FOLLOW-UP: If the swap files again get SO big, will re-starting the computer clear them? \nApologies that my questions are sort of pathetic -- I probably shouldn't be allowed to touch a computer ;-)\n\nA: To re-create swap files, you should restart the Mac (a normal shutdown is all that's needed). Swap files get cleaned up each and every reboot whether you attempted to mess with them or not.\nI used the word attempted since you can't really delete a swap file from under the system due to how unix (the underpinnings of Mac OS X) works. The best you can do is remove the entry in the filesystem that points to the swap file, but any file doesn't get deleted until all files that were using the file are done with it.\nSince swap files contain the state of the machine while running, they are marked to not be backed up since they change from second to second and get recreated each boot. To back them up would simply waste space on the backup and time of the system.\nYou picked a good system file to delete - next time be sure to ask first before deleting other files since many system files are not as forgiving when you delete them from a system and then reboot things.\n", "Q: Apple TV 3 and network time problem (after Update to 5.1!?) My Apple TV (3rd generation) doesn't connect to the internet any more because it doesn't succeed in getting the network time from my router.\nI tried restarting, updating, resetting both – the Apple TV and my WLAN router (TP-Link 1043ND), I double checked the network time in my router, tried out an alternative firmware (DD-WRT), put down all security settings (no password), tried direct connection per cable (LAN) on Apple TV – but nothing worked:\nI always get the screen that Apple TV tries to fetch the network time (I'm in Germany) – the manual selection of Berlin as time zone doesn't help.\nIt all worked a few weeks ago – after an update of the Apple TV Software it all went away ... my Apple TV got useless because it needs the correct time settings to connect to the internet.\nDoes anyone have an idea what I can do?\n\nA: My TP-Link router had problems with AppleTV. The iPad didn't see Airplay. I resolved it by following this Apple KB page on iOS and OS X: Recommended settings for Wi-Fi routers and access points.\n\nA: Downgrade to previous version (5.0.2).\nHere's a description on how to do this from Apple:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT4367\n\nA: I had this problem when I was at home at my parent's where their network connection was not super good. Super good being 10+ Mbit service with ping times to major internet switching hubs of 20 ms. Their ping times were 111 ms range and 1 to 3 % dropped packets most of the time when we measured communications to known good computers around the country.\nWe ended up restoring the Apple TV twice and leaving it connected to the network for two days. We let it sit for 12 hours after the first restore and the device wouldn't get time settings.\nThe second time, we just kept waiting and waiting and without any action or change on our part, it finally got a server and set the time.\nIt was frustrating as this was an Apple TV that had worked for me for over a year and it just didn't work despite it being so critical to even signing in to an Apple ID.\n\nA: The 5.1 upgrade caused issues with connectivity.  Make sure you are using a wifi connection rather than hardwire.  If the issue persists, restore your router and reconfgure.  \n\nA: Edugeek had the answer when I had the same issue.\nhttp://www.edugeek.net/forums/netbooks-pda-phones/112002-apple-tvs-cannot-set-network-time.html\n\nA: I used a wired (Ethernet) connection instead of wireless and it worked for all updates.

Make sure that you are able to surf the web in \"accurate\" speed. If websites will not load, restart your phone. \nIf websites are loaded as fast as ever, restart your phone nevertheless (press the key in the upper right corner for a few seconds).\nI would also suggest to completely close the Mail.app before (doubletab on the home button, press and hold the mail icon until it starts wobbling, click on the red X on the corner when it appears).\n\nA: I had this problem with an older iphone and ios 6. the universal way of resetting your phone with the sleep and home page button held down for 10 secs did the trick.

One must use Gmail. (Feel free to contradict.)\nLeaving alone the sync between iCloud and iCal is not good either. I'd like to cancel syncing with iCloud to debug syncing between iCal and Gmail/google calendar. (Right now System Preferences under Mail, Contact & Calendars shows both iCloud and Gmail, and yet I do not see the calendar on Gmail -- or on the Android phone.)\nIf I cancel the sync with iCloud, most of my history disappears. Thus my question is:\nHow do I move the calendar entries that I currently have with iCloud to Gmail?\n\nA: \nI gathered that it is not possible to use iCloud for this objective. One must use Gmail. (Feel free to contradict.)\n\nSure, I'll try and contradict!\nIt's my understanding that SmoothSync for Cloud Calendar does this.\n\nHow do I move the calendar entries that I currently have with iCloud to Gmail?\n\nI found a nice step-by-step summary at the amusingly named burlapmonkey.com. I'll summarize:\n\n\n*\n\n*Login to your iCloud calendar at icloud.com.\n\n*Publicly share the calendar you want to export.\n\n*Select the updated URL that begins with webcal:// followed by a cryptic address and copy it.\n\n*Open a new browser tab/window, paste the webcal address without loading it (don't press enter).\n\n*Change webcal in the address to http.

I noticed my computer 'whirring' a lot before I cleared the files (internal fan of some sort?). I took it to mean the computer was working harder than usual to run my the programs I had open: Excel, Word, Preview, Mozilla, and Safari; is this typically a sign that I have too many programs open and risk filling my swap files?\nI'm wondering what to do if my swap files again get so big? Will re-starting the Mac clear the swap files? \nThanks & Cheers,\nCynthia\n\nA: I’m writing this answer assuming you are bad with the technicalities. Please tell me, if you are not :)\nThe only way to reduce the size of your swap is to use apps that use less resources of the computer to run. When thinking of resource-heavy apps, Excel, Firefox and Safari immediately come to mind, especially if you open a lot of tabs. \nKeeping your (underpowered, if you will) computer running nicely will require some effort on your side. Quit apps that are not in use. Close tabs that are not in use. Restart apps if they stop responding.\nAlso, if you can update your computer to Mountain Lion, please do so, as Safari on Snow Leopard is really heavy. \nAnd yes, restarting the Mac clears your swap files. \n", "Q: external disk formated with NTFS not working on Mac \nPossible Duplicate:\nHard drive read only access with Mac \n\nI bought new 1 TB WD My Passport and format it with NTFS on windows XP. and now when I connect it on mac, I see the drive but I cant add files to it.\nwhat is the issue?\nThanks,\n\nA: Try installing the latest release of OSXFUSE - check their wiki page for more information on using NTFS-3G.\n\nA: the default NTFS driver that comes with OS X is read only.

Can I change to the US store in iTunes and purchase iTunes Match and then after the sync switch back to Swedish store in iTunes and still have access to iTunes Match?\n\nA: Nope, you can’t.

Even if you do find a way to sign up for iTunes Match, there will be problems. \nOnce you switch to the Swedish Store, you will lose access to iTunes Match.\n", "Q: Why is migration from Mac Thunderbird to Mac Mail not working properly? I want to switch from Mac Thunderbird to Mac Mail. To do so, I compressed all folders of the account in Thunderbird and after that, I used the import wizard of Mac Mail. Unfortunately, a lot of Mails are missing. A folder that contains hundreds of mails in Thunderbird, contains only one message in Mail, but I get no errors or warnings. How can I migrate my local folder? (I cannot switch to IMAP, thank you ;-) )\n\nA: A friend of mine had a similar problem when migrating local mails from a POP mail account from Windows XP (Thunderbird) to a Mac (Mail.app).\nThis is what we did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create an IMAP account (we chose aol.com, gmail.com is another good choice).\n\n*Configure the new IMAP mail account in Thunderbird.\n\n*Drag and drop all mails from the local account to the IMAP account. This may take a while.\n\n*Configure both your current mail account and the IMAP account in Mail.app.\n\n*Copy the files back to your current mail account (again, drag and drop).\n\n\n(You may consider keeping the IMAP mail address...)\nThis may be easier than troubleshooting why the import doesn't work properly.\n", "Q: Software for managing Word files (doc, docx) archive I have an archive of .doc/.docx files, which I'm frequently using to pull some information. I'm looking for some software that would allow me to search through the content of all these files (Mac OS X 10.7.5).\nNote: I haven't tested Spotlight because I've turned it off some time ago (because of power consumption related to file indexing; I also didn't need it before). \n\nA: I'd suggest you look at the File Content Finder (disclaimer - I'm its developer). It's specifically designed for searching file contents without indexing. It supports all major file formats - pdf, doc(x), xls(x), pptx, rtf, and others. It can also search in scanned png and jpg documents.\nIts filtering lets you optimise and refine your search by multiple criteria - file type, creation/modification dates, etc.\nCost: $9.99 USD.\n\nA: Devonthink - any of the versions - will index the contents of the files (and many other filetypes too - providing a searchable db, including a concordance. \nhttp://www.devontechnologies.com/products/devonthink/overview.html\nReally can't recommend it highly enough.\n", "Q: How to sync position, bookmarks and notes over iCloud on ePub books I recently bought several ePub books from the Humble Bundle and from Smashing Magazine, hoping that I would be able to side load them into iBooks and then use iCloud to sync position, bookmarks, highlights and notes.

I recently installed VMWare Fusion and added Windows 7.  Now when I right-click on a text file and choose Open With, there's an option to open with Notepad in Windows 7.  This is not something I want enabled.  How can I remove this choice?\n\nA: One solution is to install RCDefaultApp and change the file association for text files.\nAnother solution is to disable Windows application integration for that virtual machine. To do that open the virtual machine, go to the Virtual Machine menu and select Settings.... Change the settings for Default Applications. You likely want to uncheck Run Windows applications from you Mac's Applications folder\n\n", "Q: Syncing Aperture between Macs I recently started dividing my Aperture work between my home iMac, and my MacBook Pro. The problem here is that, whenever I want to do a makeshift sync, I export the edited photos from one Mac as an Aperture library (to keep all adjustments, as well as the original image format), and then import the library into the second computer. This is slow, inefficient, and needlessly cumbersome.\nI considered using Photo Stream, but the 25 GB I have on my iCloud (which will shrink  to 5 a year from now) is nowhere near enough to house my colossal Aperture library, which should break the 100 GB milestone in a month or two; not to mention, using Photo Stream uses up Internet bandwidth, and flattens the images (merges the adjustments, instead of preserving them as editable ones).\nHas anyone else had this kind of problem? Can anyone think of a solution?\n\nA: RSync the library from the one system to the other when you're at home. It's network efficient, only transfers updated files, and is designed with exactly this sort of thing in mind. It's also free, and installed by default on OSX. It's a command-line tool, as long as you're happy with that sort of thing. It'll keep the libraries in sync quite happily, and syncs both ways.\nYou'll want something like:\nrsync -avh --progress --delete /path/to/source /path/to/target\nDepends on whether you mount the remote drive locally, or use an rsync daemon.\nNice instructions here: Software to synchronize two directories (local/remote)\n\nA: Another possibilty is to keep your aperture library on an external disk.  You move the disk from computer to computer.  This avoids the sync problem, as well as the possibility that you overwrite new edits with older versions if you forget which one is the most current.\nNote that USB 2 is probably too slow to work with.  Firewire 2 is probably acceptable.  USB 3, thunderbolt, or esata will depend on the capabilities of your macs, but you can get enclosures that support multiple kinds of connections.\n", "Q: Is there an USB adapter for the Earphones that will let you use both audio and mic simultaneously for a phone conversation? I like the Apple Earphones (the iPhone headphone with audio, mic and remote) but I hate to keep plugging it on and off my Macbook Air. So I heard the only way to fix that is to buy a USB headphone so you can switch it on and off through software. Problem is that I like my Apple Earphones and I want to keep using it but now through USB. Is there a USB adapter that will work with the Earphones, in other words, that will make both headphone and mic work at the same time for a phone conversation?\n\nA: I'm not aware of a USB adapter that directly takes the 4-pin 3.5mm connector that the Apple headset uses, but you could combine one of the many USB adapters with an adapter cable like this. That will convert the 4-pin connector to the separate 3-pin stereo & microphone connectors that are standard on PCs and should work with any USB adapters with an in & out. You will likely lose the volume and clicker controls on the headset.\n", "Q: How does the OS X font fallback system work? I'm trying to design a font containing symbols for internal use in our organisation. \nI've created a font using this tutorial, and I've assigned a symbol to the unicode position 0xF600. This lies within the 'Private use area', and doesn't appear to have any fonts which are supplying it.\nI've created my font and installed it. I've tried with the font in either ~/Library/Fonts or /System/Library/Fonts.\nIf I insert this character () in TextEdit or any system text box I get either a box or some kind of mark contained within a box. Either way, not my character.\nIf I manually set the font to my font, the character is displayed.\nHowever, I notice that other characters don't work like this. If I'm using Helvetica, and I insert a Chinese character, the symbol is taken from a different font which can display that glyph. So clearly there's a mechanism to fallback to a font which contains the character.\nAre some fonts blessed by the system? How would I get my font to be the fallback?\nEDIT: I've tried clearing the font cache with sudo atsutil databases -remove, didn't affect it.\nEDIT 2: After poking around a bit and doing some reading, there's a font called LastResort.ttf that is the final fallback for all the unicode characters, there must be a precedence set somewhere in the system, so that that is always last. I wonder where that is...\n\nA: OS X normally will not display a character in the Private Use Area unless you manually set the font in the app.  I understand this is intentional, since every font could have a different glyph at the same PUA code point, and it only makes sense to display something when the user specifies the font.\nI think it should also work when the right font is selected via CSS or other markup in a document being read.\nSome earlier versions of OS X did not have this \"feature\" and did display PUA stuff.  I don't know how they chose which font to use when more than one had something at the code point selected.\n\nA: The character you show, of multiple horizontal lines, is San Francisco's 'notdef' character. That is the character that it shows when a requested glyph is not encoded in the font.\nOther fonts may well have whatever character is being requested; or they may have a different notdef character, usually something in a box.\n", "Q: How do Services work on Mac OS X Lion (I can't make them appear in Menu Bar) I'm trying to create a service (in this case, operating on images in Evernote.app).\nI open up Automator, make my script, and set it to to receive 'image files' in 'any application'. Doesn't show up either in the menubar (Evernote > Services -> \"My Image Service\"), or in the context-menu (Right-click image, services are at end of menu).\nChanging the selection to: no input, files, files or directories, etc. makes no difference. Changing the application to Evernote.app makes no difference.\nThe thing that makes me think I'm missing something: if I set the application to Preview.app, I also can't get any services to appear in the menu bar. Is there something I have to do to trigger their appearance there?\n(EDIT: my question got cut off for some reason - fixed that)\n\nA: Make sure that the service is being saved to ~/Library/Services as a .workflow file. It only seems to include Services in the menubar when they are saved to this path.\nAdditionally, ensure that the Services folder is not an alias to another folder. It should show up as a normal folder in finder. I had a similar problem and was able to resolve it by removing the alias I created in ~/Library/. Instead of my Services alias, I created the Services folder as a normal folder. Once I did that, every script that was saved there began to appear in the menu as expected.\n", "Q: How to customize .inputrc to make Command-Delete and Option-Delete delete lines and words in iTerm 2?

I use iTerm2, but I imagine any solution would involve using readline and .inputrc which probably would work in most terminals.\nSpecifically, I was thinking of adding:\n\n\n*\n\n*Command-Delete: Delete to start of line before cursor\n\n*Option-Delete: Delete word before cursor\n\n*Option-Left/Right Arrow: Move cursor between words\n\n*Command-Left/Right Arrow: Move cursor to start/end of line\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\n*\n\n*How could .inputrc be configured to support these keyboard shortcuts?\n\n*Would any of these shortcuts generate conflicts with existing terminal or command-line shortcuts?\n\n*Are there any other shortcuts that would be useful to create consistency with standard OS X text editing keys?\n\n\nAs a side note, I am aware that there are Vi and Emacs style shortcuts for performing these operations. In fact I use Vi-style shortcuts quite a lot on the command-line. However, sometimes when my mind hasn't shifted modes, it’s disruptive. Thus, it would be nice if the terminal could support both OS X and Vim style shortcuts.\n\nA: ⌘← can be assigned to \\eOH and ⌘→ to \\eOF. You could assign ⌥← to \\eb like in Terminal, but it doesn't work in vi mode or nano.\n\n\nIn emacs mode you could also add this to .inputrc:\n\"\\e[1;9D\": backward-word\n\"\\e[1;9C\": forward-word\n\"\\e[3~\": kill-word\n\nC-v shows the escape sequence for the next key combination. ^[ is ESC in caret notation. bind -p prints currently bound commands.\n\nA: Preliminary answer; still hunting for other key combinations\nThe following post explains how to configure Alt+left/right in Iterm2. Interestingly, it requires both the configuration of .inputrc and customisation of iTerm2.\n", "Q: Is it ok that a MacBook turns on from sleep with the lid closed when MagSafe is connected/disconnected? I have a mid-2012 MacBook (non-retina). Recently I've noticed that after closing the lid to put it to sleep, once it's sleeping if I pull or attach the MagSafe connector to it it will turn on from sleep, with the lid still closed, and go back to sleep after around 30 seconds. \nIs this behavior normal? Should I be worried? Is there a way to disable it?\n\nA: This should not be happening.  I have this same problem and it started happening after the most recent MacBook Pro and MacBook Air Update 2.0 was installed on 11/9/2012.  Prior to this update install, the laptop would never wake up from sleep when the adapter was connected or disconnected.  Does your also try to eject the DVDROM drive when you unplug it from power after it's been asleep for a while?\n\nA: It is normal and if it's only for 30 seconds then there should be no reason to worry.  The only thing that really happens when it's closed is that it gets really hot.\n", "Q: How to use a iPhone 4S (that was activated on a CDMA carrier) with a local GSM network? I'd like to know if I could factory restore my iPhone 4S, insert a SIM card and see if that would make it activated in the other GSM network. The phone was bought from a regional CDMA carrier but they're being extremely shady in confirming whether or not it's SIM locked and if they'd be willing to unlock it for me.\nI bought it out of contract and took their service on a month by month basis but it's becoming extremely expensive. Are there any options of unlocking my iPhone 4S (CDMA) to use on a GSM network? And if not, why?\nYou can see here what iTunes told me after I had reset the phone to troubleshoot a issue and suddenly got the idea but didn't try it because I didn't have a micro-SIM card at the time.  \n\nA: The answer to this question is slightly complicated and in essence becomes: it depends which CDMA carrier device you purchased and which GSM carrier you want to switch to.\nFirst the facts - there are three \"models\" of iPhone 4s sold according to the model number on the back cover:\n\n\n*\n\n*A1431: iPhone 4s (GSM model China)\n\n*A1387: iPhone 4s (CDMA model)\n\n*A1387: iPhone 4s (GSM model)\n\n\nPeople wanting to use models A1431 and A1387 on CDMA networks are basically out of luck as there seems to be no support from Apple to reprogram the device to even work on CDMA. I don't know if it's a hardware issue or just drivers/software, but it's clearly stated in the Technical Specifications as footnote 3:\n3. CDMA available only if iPhone 4S is sold and activated for use on a CDMA network.\n\nThere is no indication that GSM is not available on CDMA phones, however my experience is that CDMA carriers Verizon and Sprint won't unlock the GSM sim slot until between 30 and 90 days after you have initiated service on that line.\nAdditionally, I have heard reports that the unlock is smart enough to prevent a GSM carrier that competes with the CDMA carrier from taking over service of the device. So, in the USA - a Sprint or Verizon phone would not be expected to work with AT&T or T-Mobile USA cards, but would be expected to work with any European, Asian, or other non-US based GSM carrier. I do know of many people that have travelled internationally with Sprint or Verizon iPhone 4S and had no problem once they unlocked, but I've not heard that any GSM card works - either while the phone is under contract with the original CDMA carrier or after that contract period expires.\n\nA: No, if you purchased an iPhone 4S that utilizes CDMA, you will not be able to coerce it to function with GSM technology.\nAs per the iPhone 4S Technical Specifications page:\n\nCDMA available only if iPhone 4S is sold and activated for use on a CDMA network.\n\n\nA: Let me disagree with this answer. Actually, you can use a CDMA iPhone 4S and iPhone 5 with a GSM network once it's factory unlocked. The catch is that Sprint and Verizon network's can not be used with any GSM network in USA. It is unlocked only for international GSM networks.\nYes, CDMA iPhone 4 can not be used with any GSM network.\n", "Q: Where is USB -stick automounted in OSX? Not /media/usb/something like in Ubuntu Ubuntu automounts USB -fs to /media/usb/something. How is this in OSX? I cannot find anything in /media below.\n\n\nA: All volumes (CDs, USB, harddrives, etc) are mounted into /Volumes.\nAfter inserting a USB stick called USB I see the following:\nalex@smiley:/Volumes|⇒  ls -lrt\ntotal 8\ndrwxrwxr-t  30 alex  staff  1088 Aug  4 14:34 USB\ndrwx------   1 root  wheel   568 Aug  4 23:59 Family Backup\ndrwxr-xr-x   6 root  wheel   340 Aug  5 00:00 Time Machine Backups\nlrwxr-xr-x   1 root  admin     1 Nov 14 20:55 System -> /\ndrwxr-xr-x  39 root  wheel  1394 Nov 14 20:57 SmileyBackup\n\nIn addition there you can see that my main drive is System. OS X creates a link to / for it automatically.\nAlso, Smiley Backup is another disk, and Time Machine Backups is a TimeMachine volume, and Family Backup is a remote shared drive I've mounted from another system.\n\nA: As already mentioned, you can view almost all mounted devices in /Volumes.  Although, the newer iOS devices do not show up there.\nAlternatively, you can use diskutil (which does not require superuser access.)\n$ diskutil list\n\nIf you want more details on a specific mounted device you might try:\n$ diskutil info [diskname]\n\n", "Q: What causes chmod to not work on an ssh file in OSX? I am trying to mount private keys from USB stick. OSx does not allow me to change their permissions, why? How can I change them? In other words, how can I add private keys from random USB stick to ssh-agent?\n\n\nA: I'll bet your USB stick is formatted as FAT, FAT32 or NTFS. OS X's Unix-style permissions are not compatible with FAT and FAT32 filesystems. Additionally, by default, OS X cannot write to NTFS volumes. Make sure the USB stick is formatted as HFS+.\nAnd finally, the file containing the SSH private key must have permissions set to 600 and the folder containing the file must have permissions set to 700\n\nA: You can solve this problem with\n$ cp /Volumes/disk/.ssh ~\n$ eval `ssh-agent`\n$ chmod 400 ~/.ssh/*\n$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/school\n\nbut this does not solve the original prob i.e. without copying ssh-keys to computer to add keys to the daemon\n\nA: As late as OS X 10.13/High Sierra, you can add an /etc/fstab file owned by root, even if it doesn't exist on your system, with the following content:\nLABEL=PRIVATE none msdos -u=501,-m=700\n\nThis assumes that your user ID is 501 (check with ls -n ~) and that the label of your mounted FAT/ExFAT drive is PRIVATE.  I use this for mounting VeraCrypt volume-files with ssh keys (FAT and ExFAT) that I share b/w OS X and Linux. Should work with USB drives as well, but haven't tried exactly that.\n", "Q: Wise Way To Boot Into Windows With Bluetooth Keyboard? I'm a luddite and have a hardwired keyboard on my iMac. Booting into Windows is never a problem. A family member has an iMac with a Bluetooth keyboard and a Mighty Mouse. Never having used these, I find booting into Windows to be troublesome.\nIf someone has a slick trick for keeping the keyboard awake so that simply holding down the option key works, that would be excellent. Thanks in advance for any helpful replies.\n\nA: If you can't access the boot menu at startup, you can always select which OS to reboot into from within OS X or Windows.\nIn OS X, just go to Startup Disk in System Preferences, and select your Windows partition, then restart.\nIn Windows, you need the Bootcamp tools installed (but they should have been already). You should see Startup Disk in Control Panel, which allows you to do the same thing.\n\nA: I use a program called QuickBoot which gives me a menu to select an OS and reboot. I haven't found a good way to get the alt and keyboard to work, but this is about as good.\n\nA: Wait until the Mac just finishes playing its power-on self test, (or POST) chime, then immediately press and hold down down the Option key. Holding the Option key down as soon as you reboot, but before the chime, will not work. Failing this, only a wired keyboard will work.\n\nA: I feel your pain.  I like how absolutely no one gets your question and tells you what you already know...LOL. Hilarious. What the original person is asking is (if I may...LOL)... How do you boot up to Windows, on a Mac, with a wireless keyboard? The Mac OS doesn't recognize a wireless keyboard until the login which is well past the time for going to the boot screen.  Currently, I just open my laptop and hold the \"Opt\" key and then arrow over to Windows and press Enter.  I then just close the lid.  In the original post the question is a little different since the family member has a wireless Mac keyboard and not a laptop.\n\nA: In the end, I simply purchased a wired keyboard. Should have gotten that at the start.\n", "Q: Available RAM less than what my Macbook is supposed to have When I go into Photoshop and then I look at performance in the preferences, it says that I have \"3240 MB Available\", whereas I have a 4gb RAM MacBook Pro.\nAlso, it often crashes, and I frequently have to restart it. (minimum once a day)\nCan I be sure it's a hardware problem ? \nAnd if not, do I have ways to test it ?\n\nA: If you're using a Mac with an integrated graphics card (all 13 inch models) then some of the RAM is used for this and obviously some for the OS, so this seems normal. As a rule of thumb you wouldn't want to give Photoshop more than 70/75% of what is remaining. If you assign too much to it the system won't have anything left for any other processes and we have to do a lot of work creating swap files to move temporary files about. This could be a cause of crashing. On the subject of crashing, if you're copy of Photoshop is not official (not suggesting it is) and not updated then its to be expected. \n\nA: You're never going to have all four gigabytes available. How else is the Operating system supposed to operate?  3200 sounds about right as Photoshop (at least for me) typically uses between 400 and 800 mb of RAM.\nIf your OS X is crashing daily then it is definitely indicative of a problem.  Could be anything though, without further details it's hard to tell.\n\nA: If you want to confirm the RAM you have in your computer, open up the Apple menu in the top left of the screen and click 'About This Mac'. It'll show you the type of memory installed.\nClick More Info, and then Memory, and it'll show you which size sticks are in which slot.\nWhat crashes? The whole laptop or Photoshop?\n", "Q: How can I get certain types of files dropped in certain folders based on file type? I was wondering if it is possible to have the following:\nIn my Downloads folder, I have 2 subfolders : IMAGES and VIDEOS. Is it possible to automatically move every image downloaded to the Downloads folder to the IMAGES folder, and if VIDEO files are downloaded in the Downloads folder, it should go into the VIDEOS subfolder?\nI thought I could do it with Smart Folders but it does not seems to be working.\n\nA: You can create two folder actions, one for images:\n\none for videos:\n\nBoth should be setup to receive files from Downloads folder. \nThe first step filters images and videos files. \nThe second step moves those files in the appropriate folder.\nBe sure that folder action is attached to your Downloads directory (right click on directory, Services\\Folder Actions Setup...).\nTo let Automator wait for the download to complete, you can add a Run AppleScript step, before the Move Finder Items step, similar to this:\non run {input, parameters}\n    if input is {} then\n        return {}\n    end if\n\n    repeat\n        delay 1\n        set {size:fileSize, busy status:Busy} to (info for (input as alias))\n        if not Busy and (fileSize is greater than 0) then return input\n    end repeat\nend run\n\n\n\nA: Fill in the movieFiles property with the name extensions of the movies you will be dropping.

I'd like to have something that I can run from Alfred or the command-line that can run \"clean up desktop\".\nWhat is a command-line program or apple script that will cleanup the desktop?\nPreferably there would be an option to do it by name or some other system (i.e., at least all the options that are available when right clicking the desktop).\n\nA: You have to use clean up window of desktop instead of clean up the desktop.\ntell application \"Finder\" to clean up window of desktop by name\n\n\nA: Using @Lauri Ranta's answer as a starting point, I put together this Applescript for Alfred:\non alfred_script(q)\nset q to \"\" & q\nif q is \"kind\" then\n    tell application \"Finder\" to clean up window of desktop by kind\nelse if q is \"cdate\" then\n    tell application \"Finder\" to clean up window of desktop by creation date\nelse if q is \"mdate\" then\n    tell application \"Finder\" to clean up window of desktop by modification date\nelse if q is \"size\" then\n    tell application \"Finder\" to clean up window of desktop by physical size\nelse if q is \"label\" then\n    tell application \"Finder\" to clean up window of desktop by label index\nelse\n    tell application \"Finder\" to clean up window of desktop by name\nend if\nend alfred_script\n\nYou can see the different parameters to change the order that you want in the script (and change them to something that makes better sense to you if you want).\nTo use it, open Alfred's Preferences -> Extensions and click the + button in the lower left. Choose AppleScript and enter a name for it. (I called mine 'Clean up desktop'.) Write a Title and a Keyword for the script, and then paste the code into the AppleScript field. Click Save and you should be good to go!\nIf you're using Alfred 2: open Alfred's Preferences -> Workflows and click the + button in the lower left. Choose Templates -> Essentials -> Keyword to AppleScript. Double-click the keyword node and set the keyword you want (I chose cdesk), Title and Subtext (here I listed the possible arguments: kind, cdate, mdate, size, label). Save the results and then edit the Run NSAppleScript node and paste the code and save.\n", "Q: SSD lifetime, hibernation, and mobile TM I've recently gotten a 2012 MacBook Air 13\". It is wonderful, however, I've been stressing about the life of the SSD. I understand that Apple probably would not sell an SSD machine with defaults that would ruin the SSD; however, I have some concerns.\nLike all Mac laptops, by default it uses a hybrid sleep mode, so every time I close it, it writes up to 8 GB to the SSD. This is many, many times a day -- I'm in college, and I am always going to various places on campus, and the laptop almost always comes with me.\nIn addition, the default Time Machine configuration stores snapshots locally, and eventually, is allowed to fill 80% of the drive.\nBoth of these seem somewhat problematic to me -- sleeping and waking 10 times a day might write around 25% of the SSD capacity a day, and if I do let the mobile snapshots take up 80% of the drive, the static data on the drive will increase write amplification due to the SSD's wear leveling.\nAm I worrying over nothing, or do I have a legitimate concern? If yes for the latter, what can I do to improve the life of the SSD?\n\nA: Since OS X has TRIM support, the wear from writing 8 GB of sleepimage data would be spread out evenly across the drive by the controller in the SSD. Assuming 10,000 write cycles per cell and your estimate of 25% of drive capacity per day, you will be fine for 40,000 days (110 years) if you don't do anything else with the SSD. \nThat number could be completely wrong due to write amplification, but if the data is actually being written sequentially it shouldn't be a problem.\n", "Q: One text file is not being backed up by Time Machine I have this strange problem where a single text file (Notes.txt, where I keep random notes) is, as of yesterday, not being backed up by Time Machine. It exists in the many backups that I have dating several months back, but since yesterday, it hasn't changed in Time Machine even though I edit the file almost every hour.\nAnyone know what could be causing this? I'm pretty sure that if I deleted the file (after backing it up somewhere else) then moving it back there will probably force Time Machine to back it up again, but I'm really curious as to what is causing this, just in case it happens again. It's a good thing I happnened to notice this, because I needed to look back at a previous version, but now I'm very worried that it might happen to another file that I am never aware is being missed by Time Machine.\n\nA: There are a couple of things you can do to narrow down if the system is being told to ignore that file or if there is a problem with the disk structures or some other bug at play.\nIf you like programs with icons and controls - go get Backup Loupe and use it to track that file across your backups. The program will pause itself if Time Machine is running, so you might do one backup and then turn Time Machine off for the time it takes the Loupe to scan a few backups.\nSimilarly, Apple has a diagnostic tool that they use to capture information that could show a bug or a problem with time machine and spotlight indexing - it's called tmdiagnose. If you are comfortable with zip files with lots of diagnostic data and text files, start here.\nLastly, you could run tmutil compare from the terminal to just let the system tell you which files are in need of a backup the next \"time the machine\" runs.\nAs written, you have four places to look to narrow things down:\n\n\n*\n\n*Time Machine is being told to ignore that file and you can learn all the exclusion rules and patterns and check for that.\n\n*Spotlight is messing up and Time Machine depends on that to know what has changed.\n\n*Time Machine itself is messing up.\n\n*The disks / hardware / file system are messing up - general troubleshooting of that might be needed once you've ruled out the above three potential causes.\n\n", "Q: Windows 7 computer not showing up on Apple TV Both iTunes on Windows 7 and the Apple TV 3 are updated to the latest versions.  My PC is connected to the router via Cat 5 and the Apple TV is connected on wireless.  I can AirPlay with my iPad or iPhone. I've had this work just fine before with other computers. Home sharing is enabled on both devices and connected to the same account with the correct password. I can't figure out what's going on.\n\nA: The problem could be with your firewall. You should check the firewall software you use and open relevant ports. Some firewalls actually have predefined rules for the services, but for most you'll have to define them manually.\nMost commonly the services used are named mDNS or Bonjour sharing. If these aren't found, you can find a list of relevant ports here and add them manually.\n\nA: I had a similar issue with my Mac and Apple TV\nI was able to exchange it at a Apple store after creating a case with Apple support.  Info on the exchange program here.\nFor me, everything worked on the network except for Home Sharing on the Apple TV.  It passed all tests and otherwise worked fine.  In my case, restarting iTunes would 'enable' Home Sharing access from the Apple TV for a little while, then it would drop again.\nGood luck.\n\nA: In Apple TV, Go To Settings > General and hit restart - beyond that I think Apple Support would be a good way to go\n", "Q: can you set an application to come to the desktop you are on osx I know that you can lock an application to a certain desktop, and if you select that application(either through the dock or command+tab), then OSX will change your desktop to the one where the application is on.\nCan you set it to pull the application to you?\nIE the messages.app.  I dont care where it is, but when I switch to it, I want it to come to me.\nIm running 10.8\n\nA: If you assign an application to 'All Desktops', then it will follow you around as you switch desktops, and no matter which desktop you're in when you click the dock icon or select it with CMD-TAB, the application will come to the forefront on the desktop you're at.\n", "Q: MacBook Air reduces free space from 7GB to 1GB in after a few houres I am using a Macbook Air with a 64GB HDD and Mountain Lion installed on it.\nWhen I reboot my Air, it shows that I have 7GB free disk space. But after a couple of hours, the system says my disk is nearly full (less than 1GB free space).\nWhat can I do about this? Is it about Sleep Image?\n\nA: Several things can use that much memory - before you reboot get a picture of a few things in terminal by pasting these commands and saving the results.\n\n\n*\n\n*du -m /var/vm/*\n\n*vm_stat\nYou could also look at activity monitor and see how much memory on the left and how much swap is being used:\n\nThen, you can see how much RAM you have, how much space will be needed for the sleep image or if some other process is using space. Also, check in the System Information - About This Mac window (the tool lives in /Applications/Utilities - choose Command I and then storage) to be sure you don't also have backups being stored locally. \nIf you don't need them, you can turn off Time Machine and then turn it back on or use sudo tmutil disablelocal if you like terminal commands and know the risks of sudo and trusting someone on the internet giving advice.\n\nA: Likely this is mostly attributed to swapping memory to the drive. If your running applications are using more memory than the amount of RAM installed, stuff will be written out to the disk instead. \nTry investigating your memory usage in Activity Monitor. You can reduce the amount of memory used by closing apps or running less apps at the same time, but I suggest you free up more disk space in general as 7GB leaves very little margin to work with. \n", "Q: Why is sudo running so many times? I've just noticed that my mac has loads of sudo processes running – why?

I have an Airport Express set up to extend this network.\nDoes the Airport Express just share the 802.11n part of the network or the 802.11b/g too?\nI ask because I have a set of Airplay speakers with 802.11b/g which are much closer to my Airport Express but insist on joining the Time Capsule which is further away. AirPlay to these speakers is awful. If I could convince it to join the Airport Express bridge instead then I believe it would work, since there would be fewer hops from my phone which is already connected to the Airport Express.\nIs there a way to have the 802.11b/g speakers join the nearer Airport Express?\n\nA: It depends on the rev of Airport Express. The older Airport Express' only extended the 2.4GHz band.\nThe last Airport Express (before the change that makes it look like a white AppleTV) could extend either band.\nThe latest rev (looks like white AppleTV) will also extend either band. From what I understand,  if your 2.4 & 5GHz band have the same network name, it will extend the band that has the strongest signal (since there isn't a way to select it in the Airport Setup).\nIf you have separately named 2.4 and 5GHz network names, then it will extend the network you specify.\n", "Q: Is there an app or setting to lock an iPad in a Presentation mode, so other apps can't be accessed?

Settings > General > Accessibility > Learning > Guided Access.\n\nA: Microsoft has not (yet) released Office 20xx for iOS, so the Powerpoint presentation needs to be opened and certified in Apple's Keynote on a OSX Mac. You can then present on the iPad with Keynote for iOS. RTFM the Keynote dox as there are some things to take into consideration when building a presentation on OSX to be used on iOS.\nIf the presentation is not interactive (i.e., the presenter just talks over pre-timed slides w/out manual advancing,) then perhaps exporting a movie file of the presentation and showing it in the Video app would be the simplest solution.\n", "Q: Cracked iPad display - What are my options? I've had my 3rd generation iPad for only five months, and I've tried hard to keep it in pristine condition. I always had it in its case, and was very mindful of what I did with it.\nUnfortunately one momentary lapse of concentration is all it took for this to happen:\n\nIt only fell three feet, and it was still in its case, but none of that made any difference :(\nWhat are my options now? How much will Apple charge me for repairing it? Will a third party do it cheaper? If I'd bought Apple Care, would this type of accident have been covered?\nThanks for any advice!\n\nA: The normal AppleCare plan does not cover accidental damage as it follows the general warranty conditions that cover normal use generally wear is only covered if it's both impeding a normal function and not something that would be expected to be consumed.\nAppleCare+ does cover this - you would have had to buy the AppleCare plus insurance and there would be a fee ($49) in the US to pay for the accidental part of the repair. Also, the insturance plus AppleCare is not available worldwide (or nearly as widely) as the normal AppleCare plans.\nApple fixes all iPads at the factory so you would see aflat priced exchange part, so call or visit Apple or an authorized repair agent for pricing on that exchange where you live. Basically, they are getting a new iPad into your hands that might be new or might be refurbished - but it will have a new battery and a new serial number and come directly from the factory to you.\nI had this exact same thing happen - my iPad slipped out of my bag and landed after a two foot fall onto a corner. I had the + coverage and was very glad to see the several hundred dollar cost end up hitting my wallet for $49 on top of the $99 I spent originally.\n\nA: Ok, so I finally found out my own answer. It seems there are three options:\nOfficial Apple Route\nI travelled to the big Apple Store on Oxford Street in London, hoping to ask a member of staff what I could do about a cracked iPad.\nWhen I got there the helpful staff member told me I needed to book an appointment with a technician. \"Ok, let's do it\", I said. \"No, you have to book the appointment online\", he replied. I was a bit incredulous. \"Even though I'm here now, in the store?\", I asked. \"I'm afraid so\", was his response. This seemed pretty silly to me, and to make matters worse, he said the earliest availability to see a technician was in a week's time.\nSo I duly went home, and booked my appointment online for a week's time.\nSeven days later I trundled back into London, once again with my broken iPad in tow. I got to the store at my appointed time and asked a staff member where I needed to go to see a technician. They told me to talk to one of the Apple staff upstairs.\nUp I went, and I found a bunch standing around chatting to each other. Eventually one of them decided to help me. The first thing he asked me was why I needed to see the technician in the first place, and so I told him the sorry story of my two month old iPad. One three feet tumble onto my bathroom tiled floor and it was cracked. Without looking at my iPad, or even mentioning a technician, he just told me that they could only fix it if I paid. And the cost for any fix, big or small, was £256.44. (That's $406 US dollars, American readers!)\nI was a little taken aback. Why did I have to wait a week to see a \"technician\" for this? It was also very expensive, and I remarked that it seemed pricey. (I could buy an iPad Mini for that price!) \"Yes\", he agreed, \"do you want to go ahead?\". Apparently that was all the help they could offer.\nNeedless to say I was pretty upset at having to go through all this rigmarole only to be told by a member of the floor staff that there was nothing they could do. I could have saved myself a trip into London for one thing.\nOn the whole, it was a pretty terrible customer experience which left me feeling incredibly frustrated.\nBottom line: You pay £256 ($406). That's it.\n(Note: Apparently Apple Care+ DOES cover these sorts of accidental mishaps. You pay £79 for two years, and £39 for each incident.)\nThird-Party Route\nI've since found a few third-party repair companies that offer to repair broken iPad screens for various sums - between £70 and £110. So I'm considering them. (Some of them offer 12 month guarantees for the work they do, which is pretty good.)\nDIY Route\nI've also discovered that you can buy repair kits for between £30 and £40 that would allow you to do it yourself. From the videos I've seen, the job looks fiddly, but not impossible.\nThis appears to be all the options available to someone who's accidentally broken their iPad glass! :(\n\nA: It might be a bit late but squaretrade.com appear to do far better deals than applecare.\n\nA: I have an iPad 2 in similar condition, but with the glass even more shattered.  This seems to be a very common thing though as I've noticed there are a lot of shops in the USA that are now offering to fix iPads and iPhones.  They seem to specialize in glass/digitizer repair.  The prices range from $150-$200 USD depending on the model.  I'm probably going to take mine to one the kiosks at the local mall (Tysons Corners in Virginia.)  The reason is because I have seen them diligently fixing iPads and iPhones as if they were watchmakers.\nApple seems like they generally charge $200-$250 USD to replace an iPhone and $300-$500 USD to replace an iPad if you don't have AppleCare+.  So these third party repair shops seem like a good deal if you don't have AppleCare+.\nSource for Apple's iPad repair costs: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3029844?start=30&tstart=0\n\nA: If you decide not to fix it the Apple route, keep in mind this will preclude you from warranty service through Apple for the lifetime of the unit.\nIf you find accidents happen for you around expensive technology, you may consider getting insurance, and a rider that would reimburse the cost of repairs, if damaged.\n\nA: The third party route is probably a good option. If any of you are based in the UK there is a site called Repairs UK which repairs them for under £90 and is better than Apples price :)\n\nA: iCracked:\nType in your location at iCracked, and they'll let you know if they have technicians in your area that can come out and do the job for you.\nThey even offer a 99-year warranty for any repair work that they do. \nTheir direct-to-you repair service is brand new, launching across the United States today.\n", "Q: Booting from USB to install Windows 7 on Macbook Pro, Early 2011 I used Bootcamp (5.0) to create a Windows 7 install USB.

The 3rd party RSS Feed alternatives to Safari that I've found are cumbersome...in my opinion. Any simple, and good looking ones out there? (using NetNewsWire and it looks/feels bloated). Perhaps there's a Safari Extension?\n\nA: I use NetNewsWire, but if you're coming from something simple like Safari's RSS reader, I can see how it might feel like overkill. If you don't care for NNW, have a look at Reeder for Mac. It's got a simpler aesthetic, perhaps more to your taste. It's $4.99 on the Mac App Store, and does require a Google account, as it uses Google Reader for the backend.\nGoogle Reader is of course another popular option, if you don't mind a web-app. You could use Fluid to turn it into a bit of a hybrid app if you want a more native feel.\n\nA: I've used Vienna for years.

To do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try the uninstall-devtools script from this answer to remove older XCode versions. (If it doesn't work or you can't find it, don't worry about it.)\n\n*Delete the entire /Developer directory if it exists. This is where older versions of XCode live.\n\n*Download and install the latest XCode for your OS version. (The App Store makes this easy.)\n\n*Install the Command Line Tools. In XCode, go to the Apple menu, select Preferences, select the Downloads section, and click Install next to Command Line Tools.\n\n*Update the Homebrew definitions and packages with brew update && brew upgrade.\n\n\n*\n\n*If any brewed packages still seem broken, brew rm them and brew install --fresh to reinstall.\n\n\n*Edit your shell config file (e.g. ~/.bashrc) to make sure /usr/local/bin is on your path. brew doctor can help diagnose this and other issues.\n\n\nNote that tms is designed to install to /usr/lib by default, which you won't have permissions to do in a normal OS X setup even once you have all the tools installed, because the OS reserves /usr for its own use. You'll probably want to fiddle with the Makefile and tms.h to get it in to /usr/local or /opt, which are easier places to drop user-built packages.\nIf you're feeling ambitious, you could even do brew create http://jonathanscorner.com/download/tms1_4.tar.gz to make a Homebrew formula for TMS, making repeated installs easier.\n", "Q: iPhone 4 cannot connect to internet after iOS6 update Ever since I updated my iPhone 4 to iOS6, I'm not able to connect to the internet except when I have a WiFi signal to connect to.

Java is consistently listed as using 700MB of real memory. That is a nice chunk of change on my 4GB iMac. I don't even know that I am running a Java Application, ever.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: This is due to the nature of garbage collection technology used in Java. Freeing memory in such systems is delayed until some threshold reached, or out of memory happens, or some time passes. It is probably not using all those 700MB all the time (may as well be just 50 MB), but Activity Monitor has no way to look inside Java virtual machine and tell how much is actually used.\nNormally, if there are no bugs or leaks (yes GC systems may leak too), Java should give up unused memory whenever your system runs out of it, so there is no need to worry right now. Said that, if you don't need the program, it won't hurt uninstalling whatever is starting it up.\n\nA: Open up activity monitor, click on the Java process and press Command-I.\nFrom there you might be able to figure out where the process comes from 2 ways\n1) Look at open files and ports\nThe open files should give a clue where the process is from or at least what it's reading + writing to.\n2) Parent Process\nYou can click on this to open info about the parent process and trace up the parent chain to see what launched the process.\nIf it's launchd, you might be able to look at your launchd config to see where there's a java call in there.\n\nA: The archaic explanation:\nJava applications require a virtual machine to run because they cannot be are usually not compiled directly into machine language (native code) for many processors, instead Java is usually complied into bytecode.  Java is also a very high-level Object-Oriented programming language (OOP) which means that while the application code itself is much easier to maintain, the objects that are instantiated will use that much more memory.\nThe more modern explanation:\nHowever, many do argue that the problem is usually more so because of the Java program's data structures and architecture, rather than the bytecode.  And I tend to agree with that.\nThere are a number of other reasons why Java apps are using so much system resources (like RAM).  For example, most modern applications use the UTF-8 charset, which requires more memory per character, for strings (usually text) as it can support so many other languages' symbols.  And since so many applications target a huge international market, they're sorta obligated to use it.\nThat said, Java arguably remains the most popular programming language at the moment.  Many applications that your computer runs are written in Java.  That is why.\n", "Q: Why are 2 Mac Pros on a separate subnet directly connected seeing very low transfer rates? I have two Mac Pros and as one is primarily utilized for storage, I thought connecting the two directly under a different subnet would be a worthwhile endeavor that would directly transfer data without having to pass through the switch and therefore augment speed.\nEverything seems to work properly in the sense that I can connect via the static IP on the private subnet between the two machines and I likewise I can connect just fine outside of this subnet to the LAN and Internet by the 2nd ports that are connected to the network infrastructure.\nUnfortunately, something strange is happening where transfer rates are exceptionally slow.  With the switch I normally get between 70-90 MB/s with AFP, whereas with the a crossover cable connecting them, I'm only seeing < 100 KB/s! \nAny ideas as to what may be going on here?\n\nA: My first guess would be the crossover cable you're using to connect them. Gigabit ethernet requires a different crossover wiring than 10- or 100-megabit ethernet, and if you have the wrong kind, the computers will either figure out the problem and switch to a slower connection, or just get massive amounts of errors. I don't have 2 Mac Pros handy to check myself, but you can check this in the Network Utility's Info pane: Select the relevant interface from the pop-up menu, then check the Link Speed listed on the left, and the error counts on the right.\nIf this is the problem, I'm pretty sure the fix is easy too: just use a straight-through CAT-5 (or 5e or 6) cable instead. Pretty much all modern network interfaces do auto-MDIX meaning that the interface can do the crossover internally. Again, I don't have Mac Pros handy to test, but I'm pretty sure their ethernet interfaces support this.\n", "Q: How do I fix a bad file name encoding on an Intel Mac? On occasion I get files that have names mangled (mis-encoded, often from an archive file) by the senders. How do I fix the encoding on an Intel Mac?\nI am aware of Apple's File Name Encoding Repair utility, but that is for PowerPC Macs only (I've used it before and despite the awkward UI it really works). Has anyone made such a utility in a universal binary application?\n\nA: I know this is a very old question, but do verify that your download of File Name Encoding Repair Utility is version 1.1 from May 26, 2006. It is linked (and is listed as v1.0) at https://support.apple.com/kb/DL355?locale=en_US.\nApparently, this software was updated to be Intel compatible in 2006 with no fanfare.\nI downloaded this utility in 2017, ran on MacOS Sierra 10.12.2 on a MacBook Pro, and ran it against a few folders with garbled Japanese text from Mac OS 9. It corrected the file names as expected.\nI was then able to shift the text encoding of the files to Japanese using SUE in Mac OS 9. There's some differences with Shift-JIS in Mac OS X that I was unable to translate 100% of file encodings using just TextWrangler. Perhaps running SUE in SheepShaver or another Mac OS 9-era emulator may assist.\nUsing the File Name Encoding Repair, SUE, and Google Translate, I was able to get some old software working. This should help if anyone else finds this in the future.\n\nA: I wrote a Qt based utility to convert filename encoding into unicode:\nhttps://github.com/dennis97519/EncodingConverter\nA mac app package is available in the releases section.\nYou can set the actual encoding based on language of the filename (you'll need to google for commonly used encoding for a language), then tab focus to the system encoding setting, and use up and down keys on the keyboard to trial and error for the correct encoding. Once the filenames appears to be right in the preview, just click apply and confirm that you had the correct folder to rename all the files.\n", "Q: For maximum FileVault2 security, why is hibernation recommended? Many discussions of FileVault 2 security suggest using:\nsudo pmset -a destroyfvkeyonstandby 1 hibernatemode 25\n\nSome of those discussion state that FileVault keys are stored in RAM during normal awake use whereas others say that they are stored in EFI firmware.\n\n\n*\n\n*Where are the keys stored while the machine is awake and running-  in RAM or in firmware?\n\n*What, precisely, does destroyfvkeyonstandby do?  For example, if I delete a file I can recover it because it is not wiped.  Does destroyfvkeyonstandby perform a memory release (delete) or a wipe (overwriting the memory that was being used to hold the key)?\n\n*If I use destroyfvkeyonstandby, what benefit is there to going into hibernation mode immediately (other than saving energy)?  If the key has been wiped, what danger is there in leaving the RAM powered on?\n\nA: *\n\n*During normal use, the keys are stored in RAM, which makes them vulnerable to a DMA attack over Firewire or Thunderbolt (using something like Inception). This is an old set of attacks, and Apple does actually disable some of the functionality of those devices during some sleep modes (e.g., hibernatemode 25 which removes power from the RAM after dumping its contents to disk; for added security, you should also disable Fast User Switching, as it's another attack vector.)\n\n*That is the only thing that makes sense for Apple to do, since it's pretty trivial. More details might be culled from this analysis of FileVault 2, courtesy of a few security researchers from Cambridge. \n\n*RAM can also be written to (see Inception) in order to bypass the actual password; dumping to disk and reloading on wake will ensure the contents is tamper-proof.\n", "Q: Logitech C615 webcam not detected (Mac OS X 10.8.2) I have a Mid-2010 Macbook Pro running Mountain Lion (10.8.2) and I purchased a Logitech C615 webcam because I read it is compatible with Mac.

After macbook waking from deep sleep, it has some \"artifacts\" (i don't know how to name it correctly) on the screen:\n\n\nArtifacts on the top under the menu bar on the second image are always present after deep sleep, but other artifacts can be or can't be. And I don't know if this a hardware or software issue, but these artifacts were always present through every my Mac OS X update. Now I have 10.7.5 Lion.\nArtifacts disappear after reboot. So I can't use deep sleep as I should. Has anybody experienced this?\n\nA: Those are very characteristic failures of a hardware nature.\n\n\n*\n\n*the LVDS cable that carries the signal could be faulty or loose\n\n*the GPU could be having problems (perhaps heat related, perhaps not)\n\n*the LCD panel could be physically failing or loose or electrically failing\n\n*much less likely causes would be RAM, Storage or software (erase and reinstall)\n\n\nI would start with contacting support in the country of sale and/or country where you are now:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HE57\nThey will be able to advise you where and how to request a quote for service and then you can decide to pursue hardware repair or further troubleshoot software. Faulty software could cause this, but it's unlikely to come and go and you might waste time reinstalling the OS, clearing preferences, etc…\nIf the issues only happen after sleep, you might also consider a failure of the RAM or storage where the sleep image becomes corrupt or the part of the RAM that backs the GPU has problems. Again, on an Air, there are no parts that Apple recommends anyone but a trained technician to service, and they have access to additional resources and can send the diagrams to engineering if they don't have enough experience on that particular model. Most Apple store geniuses would know typical failure modes of each model since they see so many broken machines, but they don't work from home or by phone unless you have a paid support plan.\n\nA: When this happened to me it was a bad graphics card. I took it to Apple and they replaced the motherboard under warranty.\n", "Q: Changing my Game Center ID If I am sharing an Apple ID with my son, can I change my Game Center name without messing up his games on his iPod?\n\nA: I am assuming you mean changing your nickname. If so, you must go into the ME section of GameCenter, tap Account (where it says your email), hit View Account, then Edit Account Info. Scroll down to Nickname to change your name. However, I believe that the names may still be linked to the Apple ID and will therefore appear on your son's iPod. If that is the case, he may have to follow the above steps as well.\n", "Q: A way to open a new Finder window when double-clicking anywhere on the Desktop?

As a test, I set \"Single Finger Tap Top Right\" of the Trackpad to the pre-defined action \"Open Finder.\" Presto, new Finder window.\n\n\nA: I don't know about any utility that can do exactly that.\nHowever, I would recommend using BetterTouchTool to achieve similar effect. \n", "Q: First click doesn't register? For some reason, from time to time, I'll have this issue where the first time I click something, nothing will happen. But, the second time I click the exact same spot, it will work as normal. This usually lasts about a day, then it goes away. It can return in a day, or in this case, after a 3-month hiatus. It is extremely annoying having to double-click everything (or tripple-click where a double-click is required). What might be causing this? It seems like the same issue described here, but I don't have jiTouch or BetterTouchTool. It is not resolved with a reboot, or even an SMC reset.\nMacbook5,2 (2009)\n\nA: In this case, it was caused by Spotify. It may have something to do with the ads that refresh every 10 seconds, but it started happening immediately after I opened it a minute ago, the 3-month hiatus ended the day I reinstalled it, and it usually happens in about hour-long increments, about how long I usually have Spotify open. I'm now 100% sure of this, it directly correlates with when the app is open or closed. It's strange, though, the window I'm in doesn't appear to lose focus, and this even happens when clicking on something in Spotify, but Spotify is what's causing it beyond a doubt.\n", "Q: What would happen if I use a power supply with a different wattage than the system is designed for? My girlfriend has a Macbook Air.  The power supply is smaller and lighter than the Pro.  It has an output of 14.85V and 3.05Amps.  My Pro Retina has a power supply that is 20V and 4.25 Amps.  \nBoth supplies have the same Magsafe adapter, so the power supplies seem interchangeable at a physical level, but what would happen if one of us plugs in using each other's adapter? \n\n\n*\n\n*Could damage result from under-powering my MacBook Pro? (like a brownout)?\n\n*Could damage result from over-powering her Air? (like a power surge)?\n\n*Will the Macbook Air charge faster with a Pro adapter?\n\nA: I am surprised that no one has noticed the attempt to power a device who's stated power requirements is \"14.5 Volts DC at 3.05 Amperes\" (The MacBook Air) with a 20 Volts (!!) DC 85 Watts power adapter.\nYes, I agree, there is nothing wrong with using a higher wattage than the original power adapter for powering the MacBook Air, but it has to be at least very near the originally required voltage of 14.5 Volts DC. 20 volts is just a too much of a jump from the manufacturer's stamped device's voltage requirements. I would accept voltage variations at no more than 2 extra voltages, say, 16 volts DC at 85Watts or whatever wattage, but never would I dare power any equipment that says that it needs 14.5 Volts with a 20.x power adapter. That's, in my opinion, is asking for trouble, and I am surprised that many users here say that they have been doing it for months and it's working just fine. It's a gamble and I am glad it's paying off for these users, but me, as a computer engineer, I would never do such a thing.\nI have with me a MacBook Air that one of my computer repair customers just dropped off at my computer repair shop, stating that it doesn't turn on. Upon examining it, it appears that its AC Adapter is at fault. Problem is that Apple decided to ship the A1369 MacBook Air whose power requirements are: 14.5 Volts DC at 3.1 Amps with a 14.5 Volts DC 45 Watts AC adapter.  14.5 Volts times 3.1 Amps equals 44.95 Watts, yes, the Maximum energy that this particular product will ever draw from the power adapter is 44.95 watts. Apple merely gave this pesky 45 watts power adapter a 0.05 watts head room when the customer is charging the battery and the customer is maxing out the CPU and GPU which I assume would be the conditions for the MacBook to consume its maximum rated energy at any given time and on these times the adapter is being taxed at 100% of its capacity it can deliver, no wonder it burned out. Apple should have shipped this MacBook Air with at least a 60 watts adapter so that it can have a head room and not be working 100% in any given time so that it can actually last.  Well, guess what, I will be providing this customer with a 60 watts adapter since that would be the most responsible thing to do, but I would never provide a 20 Volts power adapter to power a 14.5 volts device. \nSo, in conclusion, be careful with attempting to over volt any given device with an input VOLTAGE greater than what it needs. Remember, you can power the 14.5v MacBook Air with a 14.5 volts AC adapter of any wattage of your choice greater than the baseline wattage of 45 watts: \nExample:\nIt's perfectly alright to:\n  * Use a 14.5 volts DC of any wattage that happens to be a minimum baseline wattage output of 45 watts to power the MacBook Air. The adapter can say that it can power up to 1,000 watts at a rate of 14.5 volts DC and the MacBook Air will be alright, perfectly fine. The Mac will only draw the first 45 watts off the adapter, not needing to use the rest that the adapter can supply.\n   * Use, let's say, a 16.5 volts DC of any wattage. I wouldn't go too high on the wattage here as I would be over volting the input by a factor of 2 volts, and it is almost certain that the MacBook, along with most notebook computer, have a circuitry in place (voltage stabilizer) to keep the \"working\" voltage stable at its best operating voltage, despite irregularities of the input voltage which is probably trues given that many of you are being successful at powering your 14.5 volts MacBook with a 20 volts adapter without burning out some components, but the voltage stabilizer can only work for a certain range, and the higher you go in terms of voltage, the more risk you go in terms of burning out the voltage stabilizer, thus causing your Mac not to power on again under any adapter.\nIt's not alright to:\n  * Power your 14.5 volts MacBook Air with a 20.x power adapter of any wattage rating, even if it does work at the moment, because the voltage stabilizer has to work extra in order to down convert the voltage to 14.5 volts so that the rest of your Mac doesn't smoke up, and most likely this is causing the voltage stabilizer/regulator to heat up beyond its rated specs, which once again, translates to a shorter lifespan of the MacBook Air.\n\nA: You can safely use the 85W adapter on any Mac, it will only draw as much power as it needs. The 45W adapter from the MacBook Air may just about manage to power your MacBook Pro but it won't charge it. It will not damage your Mac, but you may notice the battery may still deplete when using it.\nHere is the information, straight from Apple: \n\nA: If the magsafe plug (1, 2 or whatever) fits then use it. I can assure you there would not be any problem except for the slower charge rate. It wont burn anything. \nApple's engineering is topnotch and they wont design the magsafe plug to fit if something will go wrong. You can count on that. Bogdansrc has even attested to it already.\nNever mind the wattage (45W, 60W or 85W) the load or the apple unit being charged will vary the voltage and ampere depending on the processing tasks on hand. As Nike says Just do it\"  Cheers !\n\nA: It's perfectly safe to use the MacBook Pro Charger with a MacBook Air.\nGoing the other way around though will most likely charge the MBP at a slow pace, like an iPad charging through USB or a 5W Wall Adapter.\nFor more information, see this Apple KB article: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2346\n\nA: You have 2 scenarios as I see it:\n1) Using a higher rated power supply than the original unit.\nThis is absolutely fine.  The power supply will never just automatically run at 100 % of it's capability, it will only supply what is requested.  If you use a MacBook air that is supplied with a 45 W adapter with an 85 W adapter instead, it will still only draw what it needs, which is likely a whole lot less than the rated capacity of the charger anyway, which is rated to be able to not only keep the computer going at full bore if required, and also charge the battery at the same time.\n2) Using a lower rated power supply than the original unit.\nChances are this is fine most of the time but there are more risks.  The same rules apply, it will draw the power that it needs, and no more.  Assuming you use a MBP on a MBA charger, then light use will likely never draw enough power to max out the charger.  If it's in sleep and just charging it will be fine, however the chance is there that if you thrash it it will start requesting more power than the MBA charger can safely provide.  There are 2 points to note here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Although it isn't stated in obvious terms, the 45 W (or whatever) rating shown on the power supply isn't necessarily accurate, it is in fact the guaranteed minimum continuos rate that it can supply.  Changes are that it can supply more, say (depends on the quality of the unit) +10%.\n\n*A high quality unit (such as an official Apple unit, not an eBay Hong Kong special) will have various safety measures to prevent all sorts of things, from overheating, over current, etc etc, and the worse you can except is the unit to fail gracefully with protected systems.  Get a cheap unit made from chicken wire and chewing gum though, and you are asking for a fire.\nAs for charging speeds, the Air likely wont charge any faster at all, but the MBP may charge slower (or, like an iPad running off an iPhone charger, not at all when in use and merely provide enough power to keep the device going).\n\nA: I use work MB Pro (2014 top of the line) when I work from home and use my MB Air charger and it's been working fine for the past 2.5 years. Although charger and magsafe connector do get hot (sometimes too hot to touch), it never failed.\nIt's when I run bunch of software, VM and max out all resources, charger just can't keep up, and it actually depletes faster than it charges. So, after heavy morning of coding, it's usually at 20-30% at around noon. I put it in sleep and go get lunch, and it's close to 70-80% when I come back - enough to last for the rest of the day. Having said that, it never happens when using original MB Pro charger even when running at max.\nSo is it safe? I'd say yes. Is it good? Not if you run it at max power.\n\nA: It absolutely fine to use the Macbook Air's charger on a MBP. You just need to make a few changes such as- Decrease your MBP'S display brightness to 50% and turn off the backlight. Turn your bluetooth off and try not using chrome(Its okay if you want to use it). By doing this, your MBP will pickup charge and get to 100% soon. It will not harm your laptop or your charger. \n\nA: -Will the Macbook Air charge faster with a Pro adapter?\nDon't ever do this, it could permanently damage MBA.\n-Could damage result from under-powering my MacBook Pro? (like a brownout)?\nActually, there's a few things interesting with how power system work on MBP.\nAs far as I know, my Retina MBP runs at 12392 mV (12.392 V) while I'm just browsing, and bumps up a lot when I'm gaming. So, it is possible to give it only 14 V, but it will charge extremely slow, and \"Please Don't Try That If You're Ready To Take Risk! More Importantly, Don't Blame Me For Any Damage!\"\nAlso, I want to mention one thing, that is the MagSafe Airline Adapter:\nhttp://store.apple.com/us/product/MB441Z/A/apple-magsafe-airline-adapter?fnode=5a&fs=m.manufacturer%3Dapple%26m.productKind%3Dadapter\nThis adapter by Apple connects to Airplanes, and they are basically one end MagSafe, another end this EmPower thing: \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EmPower_(aircraft_power_adapter)\nIt's 15V, and at the end of that Wikipedia page it reads,\n\nApple offers an EmPower Magsafe power adapter for their MacBook, MacBook Pro, and\n  MacBook Air lines of notebooks, and also includes a cigarette lighter\n  socket adapter. However, this system only runs the computer and will\n  not charge the computer's battery, and Apple indicates that users\n  should not plug this device into a car's cigarette lighter outlet.\n\nSo my guess is, it will work, but not well.\nIt's ultimately your choice, and if I were you, I'll test it secretly on my friends' laptop.\n\nA: There is little risk of physical harm occurring if you use her adapter on your computer. You will likely just get a slower charge since there is less voltage going across the line. There is always greater risk of using a higher powered adapter, though. Current MacBook airs use a 35 Watt power supply, whereas MacBook Pros use a 60 W power supply. I'm just throwing those in as an addition to the amperage and voltage specs that you reported. Bogdansrc is not reporting problems doing this, but I would air on the side of caution in this case. The last thing that you want to do is replace a fried logic board when you could've avoided it. I have, in the past, fried an external HDD by using a 1.5 mA supply when it called for 1.0 mA. \n\nA: This definitely hurt my dad's Mac. He used my Air's charger for his 17-inch MacBook Pro, and it burned up his battery.  When he called in a tech said it was a result of using the less powerful charger.\n", "Q: iOS App Minimum Version Distribution Does anyone know the distribution of the required iOS for apps on the App Store?  To clarify, I am not looking for the version distribution on devices (like this question).\nBasically, I want to know how many apps I would be unable to use if I bought an older iPhone that no longer gets iOS updates.\nThank you!\n\nA: The latest iOS Development tools (as of mid-September 2012) no longer support iOS devices running a version below iOS 4.3.  So apps compatible with devices that can't run iOS 4.3 drop off a cliff as developers update their apps using the current Xcode, which use is required to fully support the iPhone 5.  \nSome developers support only down to iOS 5.1, as that's the highest supported OS for the 1st gen iPad.\nWarning: If you have apps for such older iOS devices on iTunes on your Mac, don't update the apps unless the required minimum OS is appropriate.  Or make backups of your iTunes library before you update.  iTunes will throw working versions of apps in the trash after downloading a recent update, and may even delete these apps off of your older device (which is very bad).\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut to change the behavior of function keys?

I have previously had a windows desktop with an external harddrive connected all of the time and a backup program that copied to the external harddrive incrementally.  I am trying to figure out the best backup strategy given its a laptop that i move around with and travel with alot (so can't really have a external hard drive always connected)\nWhat is the recommended backup solution for map laptops? \n\nA: The Basics: Time Machine\nTime Machine is Apple's backup solution, included in OS X. An external drive is required. It backs up changed files every hour, and stores as many \"snapshots\" as it can hold. After the initial full backup, it only stores changes to files, which makes things more efficient, and allows for more granular snapshots. In addition to being able to do a full system restore, you can selectively restore older versions of specific files, which is handy in case you delete or make changes you didn't mean to.\nUsing Time Machine on OS X 10.7 and later also enables \"local snapshots\", which keeps snapshots of changed files on your main drive when you don't have your backup drive attached, provided there's sufficient space. Obviously this doesn't help if you have a drive failure, but in the case of accidental deletions, etc. it can be helpful.\nFor more information, Apple's Mac 101: Time Machine article is a good starting point.\nOnline Backup\nIf you're on the go a lot, you may want to consider an online backup service. BackBlaze is a popular one, but there's also CrashPlan, Mozy and several others.\nThe advantages are not needing an external drive, and having an off-site backup to recover from in the event of something nasty happening to your house. The downside is the monthly cost (I believe BackBlaze is a flat fee, others have differing schemes based on how much data you back up), as well as the time required to back up over the internet. These services only back up data that has changed, so after the initial full backup, things will get faster, but depending on your connection, it could be a bit problematic (particularly if you're travelling — most hotel Wi-Fi I've used isn't exactly speedy).\nSuperDuper\nSuperDuper is a longstanding Mac favourite. It will make a complete clone of your drive to an external drive, which is then bootable and usable exactly like your internal drive. It also has a \"smart update\" feature, where after the initial clone, it only updates the backup with changed data, to minimize how long backups take. SuperDuper is the best way to get up and running again after a hard drive crash — you can boot off your backup drive right away and you'll your full system.\nDropbox\nI'm listing this separately from the other online backup systems because it's not really a full backup, but it's definitely worth using. It's simply a folder that syncs to the Dropbox servers and wherever else you install your Dropbox client. Some limited storage of old versions of files is also included. 2GB is provided free, you can pay if you need more. The best use of Dropbox would be for your current working files. It won't store everything, but if you use it for the files you most often need, or those that you're using lately, you'll have up to date backups from whenever you have an internet connection.\nWrap Up\nYou'll have to do think about what exact setup suits your needs best. Ideally, a robust backup system would include at least two or three of these options in combination, so that you have multiple fallbacks. For example, you could do a daily or weekly SuperDuper backup, and then use Dropbox or Time Machine to restore the files you've been working on since your most recent backup. Adding in an online backup service for off-site redundancy will give you some added protection in the event your local backups are lost or destroyed.\n\nA: Arq. Backs up to A3, as little or as much as you choose, as frequently or infrequently as you wish, automatically from the Menubar, monthly fees very reasonable and, again, depends on how much you want backed up. Highly recommended.\nhttp://www.haystacksoftware.com/arq/\nAnd SuperDuper cannot be beat for your portable external clone.\n", "Q: Keeping both files when moving them to a different folder?

However when I move the files one by one, I get this option.\nAny tips on how I can move large amounts of files and still get the \"keep both\"-option?\n\nA: If you hold option, the skip button should turn to keep both at least in 10.8.2.\n", "Q: How do I use/enable Tor when using Terminal? I live in a country that blocks most types Internet access and protocols so I need to utilize Tor from the command line. I haven't come across much useful information in this regard, so any information would be helpful. \nI've already downloaded the Tor/Vidalia bundle, although it appears to only work through the provided web-browser that it utilizes. That is great for searching the web, etc. but I need to ssh and use curl, etc., too.\n\nA: Running Tor provides a standard proxy you can connect to at localhost:9050 with anything that supports the SOCKS protocol. Just search online for something like \"SSH over Tor\", or if that fails, \"SSH through SOCKS proxy\".\nTwo examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*SSH:\nssh -o ProxyCommand=\"nc -X 4 -x localhost:9050 %h %p\" example.com\n\n*curl:\ncurl --socks4a localhost:9050 example.com\n", "Q: How to change mc (midnight command) bash prompt on OS X? I observed that my custom bash prompt does not work on mc. How do I customize it? \n\nA: The issue is that .bash_login files are only read when bash is run as the login shell. mc probably just calls a new shell which will read its startup from ~/.bashrc See bash documentation for details.\nTo make the shell run in a common way it is often suggested that you call .bashrc from .bash_login e.g.\nif [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then\n   source ~/.bashrc\nfi\n\n\nA: Read the INVOCATION section of the man page, it's there for a reason.  MC is most likely not launching a login shell and you are only configuring your prompt for login shells.\n", "Q: Can a normal SIM be modified to work as a nano-SIM? I just puchased an iPhone5 and want to use my current SIM from my existing phone. Is there a way to convert my existing SIM to nano-SIM?\n\nA: No. You could cut it to the same dimensions, but the risk to damage the chip is high. Additionally the nano sim is slightly thinner, so it still wouldn't be a good fit.\nI suggest you exchange your sim card with your operator. Note that there exist adapters to fit a nano sim in a larger form factor though. \n\nA: The downsides of converting your SIM are:\n\n\n*\n\n*You no longer have a SIM to activate your old iOS phone (assuming it's an iPhone).\n\n*If you mess up the cut, you still need to go get a new SIM (perhaps two)\n\n*If your cut isn't precise, the SIM could wiggle loose later from the carrier since the nano-SIM carrier is designed for a thinner card and very precise dimensions.\n\n*Your carrier might expect newer SIM in the devices and your service could be impacted (very low chance - but I've seen it happen with AT&T and older Cingular, other SIM's that eventually lose support if you don't get their newer numbered SIM cards).\n\n\nThe upside is you might skip a trip or a call to your carrier and if you are good at cutting, you can shave down an existing card if you really want that thrill of DIY.\nEngadget has a nice picture of the carriers you could use to place a nano-SIM into a phone that expects a micro-SIM or SIM. Here are the micro-SIM and nano-SIM compared to some common coins for a reference to how small scale these are physically.\n\nPhoto from Engadget\nThe real issue is if your contacts on your SIM (or micro-SIM) are placed in the correct places for the iPhone 5. Here is a picture showing that some micro-SIM have larger/different contact points than a nano-SIM.\n\nPhoto from Today's iPhone \n\nA: I've read a number of positive reports on DIY resizes. Apparently Apple allowed enough slack in the nano-SIM slot that the thicknesses is not an issue. It does require careful cutting and if you screw it up you'll need a new SIM. You can find templates and instructions on the Internet. I have not seen any punches yet for nano-SIM's.\nAs suggested, if possible, it's better to get a replacement nano-SIM if your carrier offers it.\n", "Q: How to stop the Mail app from running every 10 minutes on the Mac? I have Mountain Lion on an 27\" iMac, and recently, for some reason, the Mail app launches every 10 minutes or so, and I have to quit it every time.\nIn the Preferences of Mail, I already tried every possible way to tell it not to start itself, but every 10 minutes or so, it still launches and I have to quit it manually.  I don't know whether it is because I set in Gmail calendar to send email alert on some special events in my Google Calendar, but that should be handled by the Gmail server, not the Mail app... \nI don't know whether it is related to the Notification Center, as the last few times, I notices messages popping up at the top right corner of the screen, and the Mail just started to run all by itself as well.  \nIs there a way to stop it from running automatically?\n\nA: This is not normal behavior. Edit your question with your console log information from the moment of launch, it might help.\nNotification center will provide alerts when mail arrives if set to do so, and clicking on a message will launch Mail. Mail messages also reside in the notification center and clicking one there will also launch mail.\nShort of these events, Mail should not launch itself, unless you have some background process or script you are unaware of.\nThere is a background process or helper to allow the notification center to show incoming messages while Mail.app itself isn't running. This is normal behavior. If Mail is turned off in the notification system preference you won't have any intrusions.\nOf course different things such as shell scripts, other apps and so on can launch apps so if you've configured other apps to launch Mail you need to deal with that scenario. This is where the log files can give you a hint as to what happened immediately prior to Mail launching.\n\nA: Check this article, it may help stop mail from launching.\nhttp://www.macworld.com/article/2012894/stop-mail-launching-for-calendar-alerts.html\n", "Q: How to get keyboard focus on login screen password field in OS X 10.8? My computer doubles as a server, so I leave it turned on and not asleep, but logged out, most of the time.\nIn 10.6, if I logged out of the computer for an extended period of time, I could log back into it without touching the mouse or without the screen having come on yet by pressing any key to get rid of the screen saver, then typing my password and hitting return.\nIn 10.8, if I log out of the computer for a short period of time then this is still possible; when you log out, the keyboard focus (blinking cursor) is on the password field. However, if I log out for a long period of time - I don't know how long exactly, maybe just enough for the display to turn off - then it doesn't work; after waking the screen, the keyboard focus is nowhere. The only way I can log in again is by using the mouse to click on the password field, which puts focus back so I can type there.\nFor reasons too complicated to go into, this is highly annoying to me and I would like to be able to login using the keyboard only (without using a mouse or looking at the display). My questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this standard behaviour or something I have set up wrong somehow?\n\n*Is there some key combination I can press to focus the login field?\n\n*Is there a setting that will mean the login field always stays focused?\n\n\nBy the way, I only have a single account on the computer (that is visible on that screen, I mean).\n\nA: I have also been bothered by this and some trial and error led me to discover that the login screen keyboard focus problem is not caused by the display turning off. Setting the display to never sleep in System Preferences revealed that there is a screen saver that appears when the computer is left idle at the login screen. The login field retains focus until the screen saver appears, and when the screen saver goes away, the field no longer has focus.\nThis screen saver is not controlled by the screen saver settings in System Preferences, so I have not found a way to disable it. However, I did find a setting that I use as a workaround. There is a Terminal command that can be used to set the amount of idle time before the screen saver appears. I just set it to a number of seconds that is higher than the amount of time I am usually away from the computer. To change this setting you can open the Terminal (in /Applications/Utilities) and run the following command:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.screensaver loginWindowIdleTime 10800\n\nOf course you should replace the 10800 with a number of seconds that will work for you. This command is documented by Apple Support in the article \"Configuring a screen saver to run at the Login Window.\"\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT4625\nThe article refers to OS X v10.6 specifically, but I used it on Mountain Lion 10.8.\n\nA: At login there is a list of names (if multiple people are set to use the computer) and guest, type the first letter of the name that you  want to login with, then hit enter. You are now able to enter your password.\ni.e. if your name is Sam Jones press s then enter and you are ready to go.\n\nA: When in sleep mode, and the screen is black, I type Command + Esc. Then I type Command + 1. This puts the focus in the password field.\nThis works for me on macOS 10.12.4.\n\nA: Have you tried hitting the Ctrl, Option or Command keys to wake the computer?\n", "Q: Why do i need a new email account to sync my notes in iCloud? I'm trying to sync Notes from mac to iPhone. But when I turn on Notes in iCoud, it says that I require an iCloud email address. This is unexpected since my Gmail account is alreadyh linked with my iCloud account.\nWhy is an iCloud email address required to sync Notes?\n(I'm able to sync Reminders with no problems.)\n\nA: iOS Notes syncing works through the IMAP protocol, which in iCloud is integrated into the email service. Although Apple could technically choose to allow for notes syncing without explicitly requiring an email address, they have chosen to make it a part of the email, almost like Notes is its own email folder.\nYou should also be able to sync your Notes using your Gmail account since it is also based on the IMAP protocol:\n\n\nA: If you're like me and use your gmail account for your apple account, and if you have a gmail account setup on your mac so you can sync your gmail notes (for example) to your mac, you have to remember to store your notes in gmail on your device, not icloud. To get anything from icloud it looks like you have to have an icloud.com address.\n\nA: if you have an iCloud account already, then you don't need a new one. Just enter the one you have. If you have an apple id from iTunes then it is different. iCloud is how apple is gathering all your none app or music related data like notes, calendar and documents. App and music with itunes requires credit card. iCloud does not. So that's apparently why they made a distinction. \n\nA: the account needs to exist in order to use existing mail protocols.\nyou do not need to even have the mail account sync with your phone, it just needs to exist, then you can just use it to sync notes.\n\nA: This is simply the way Apple has setup Notes sync over iCloud. It syncs using the IMAP protocol, so probably in an effort to not confuse some customers, it has chosen to make an iCloud email account mandatory as the iCloud email using a variation of IMAP. \nThere may also be self-serving reasons too, such as being able to inflate their actual usage numbers, but I do believe it's more to do with causing less confusion with some customers.\nHowever, if you go to Settings --> Accounts on your Mac, you should be able to add Notes sync to your Gmail account that you mentioned you owned. Although this may not work as \"quickly\" as iCloud would and may not have all the features that could be added at a later date by Apple.\n\nA: K, I was having this problem too, and I figured it out.\nApparently I had two iCloud accounts going, one @gmail and the other @icloud. They both were syncing on my mobile devices, but only the @gmail could be seen on my computer.\nThis is what I did.\nSystems Preferences> Internet accounts> (on the left I could see the default iCloud that came with the new OSX and my gmail) on the right I selected 'iCloud' and put in the details of my previous @icloud account. It appeared on the left and now all my devices sync.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: How do I install libgit2 on OSX Lion? I'm trying to install libgit2 on OSX, and I keep running into issues. Ultimately I'm trying to get pygit2 installed, which fails because it doesn't recognize libgit2 being installed.\nlibgit2's instructions are the following according to their github page:\n$ mkdir build && cd build\n$ cmake .. \n$ cmake --build .\n\nThey then say that in order to build the universal binary for OSX, you can use the following when configuring:\n-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=\"i386;x86_64\"\n\nTo me that means do the following:\n$ mkdir build && cd build\n$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=\"i386;x86_64\"\n$ cmake --build .\n\nHowever, that doesn't appear to work.

However, it worked fine using the latest version available on Github:\n$ git clone git://github.com/libgit2/pygit2.git\n$ cd pygit2\n$ python setup.py install\n\nThe problem here I think is that you're trying to use a two month old pygit2 release with the cutting edge version of libgit2. If using pip is an absolute necessity, you should try installing an older version of libgit2 too (like this one).\nYou only have to use the -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=\"i386;x86_64\" flag if you're targeting \"old\" Macs without 64 bits capable processors (before Core 2 x, with Snow Leopard or older).\nYou should also run\n$ cmake --build . --target install\n\nafter your\n$ cmake --build .\n\ncommand. Without this, libgit2 headers (*.h) and libraries (*.dylib) will not be installed in your /usr/local/{include,lib} directories and will not be available to others softwares (hence your compilations errors).\n", "Q: Why Mac OS X requires any amount of free disk space? I understand the OS needs some free disk space for running. So does windows or any *nix.\nBut OS X is regarded as a very polished system and my question here is more like, shouldn't it already reserve all disk space that it needs so it won't ever complain (or bug out) about not having enough space?\nIf it's 10 gb, then get a 64 gb disk and say \"you got 44 gb free space, because 20 is used by the system\" (supposing OSX already takes 10). Just take the free space needed already! Make a partition if need to be! Hide it if you really want.\nThen it wouldn't need to bother the user with worrying about that. There must be a good reason why it's like this, but I couldn't find out. Can you please explain?\n\nA: The amount of space the OS needs is neither fixed nor predictable. It depends on a huge number of factors: what programs you run, what you do in them, what background activity they trigger, what background activity happens for other reasons, etc. Hard drive space is used for overflow from RAM, logs, temporary files, etc.  If the system reserved a fixed amount of space for this, it would wind up being bigger than it needs to be a lot of the time (and hence waste space), and too small some of the time (which would be very bad).\n\nA: Warning messages like these might be a nuisance to some, but are important for most, less savvy users. The purpose is to warn users (who might not know any better) that they are running out of space. As we know, a disk that is too full results in performance lags. Alerting users to this helps to reduce the need for \"support\" from Apple or other authorized support facilities for issues that are not really related to the OS or hardware malfunction. \nIt is understandable that repeatedly seeing warning messages like this could be annoying. If so, it may behoove the user to heed them, and move non-critical data to an external drive, freeing up space. Again, it's intended as an alert for those who aren't familiar with how an OS needs to interact with the hardware, and those users constitute the vast majority.\n", "Q: Restoring new iPhone from iCloud backup deactivates old iphone? I gave a friend a new SIM card for her unlocked direct from Apple iPhone 5.\nShe put the SIM in, and went through the setup process, restoring her iPhone 5 from an iCloud backup.  At this point, her old phone lost all signal and refuses to connect to any carrier.\nShe did not go through any activation process specifically as you would on a new phone, but I think that what has happened is that the activation has occurred as part of the restore process, and that this has somehow deactivated her previous phone.\nCan anyone clear up what the activation process does, if it can be done automatically as part of a restore, and if this is what happened tell me how I can re-activate her old phone without a factory reset?\n\nA: This is most likely the carrier intentionally deactivating the old SIM.\nWhen iPhones first came out, your current phone would normally get deactivated at the moment you purchased a new phone and told the carriers to move the service to the new phone. Now, they wait until the new phone checks in to perform the swap to account for delivery delays, backups, etc...\nYour first step should be to contact the carrier and explain that you want service on both phones and arrange for which number rings to which device. They might be able to accommodate this over the phone, but if the old SIM has been deactivated in the networks, most carriers are very unwilling (or unable) to re-activate the old SIM and instead ask you to get a new SIM from them at a convenient local retail spot or by them shipping you new SIM card(s).\nApple's restore process and activation of the device doesn't affect network activation and for locked phones, you just need a SIM for the correct carrier to activate the device. iOS does not check or care that the contract is expired, not established or live for iOS activation - just that the SIM is manufactured for the correct carrier.\n\nA: If the affected iPhone is a model that can work with iTunes for activation …\n\nPersonal experience with an officially unlocked iPhone (original, MB213B, refurbished and gifted to me in April 2012) that would not connect to my service provider. I simply: \n\n\n*\n\n*gave the ID of the handset to the person who had gifted it. \n\n\nAs far as I know, he then arranged things with an Apple store that looks after his employer's handsets (this handset was not one of theirs, but the visit to the store was convenient and moreover: the users are treated with care).\nIn brief: not long after giving the ID, I was asked to retry things. I did so – with iTunes (probably with a developer preview of Mountain Lion) – things worked perfectly.\n\nWhilst I'm similarly curious about activation and connection processes, and the effects of restoration to multiple devices, I think that for your friend you might distil this question. Set aside thoughts of the working device, of carriers, of de- and re- … you're left with two Apple products:\n\n\n*\n\n*one iPhone\n\n*iTunes.\n\n\nEither: \n\n\n*\n\n*https://expresslane.apple.com or \n\n*iTunes – Help menu – Apple Service and Support\n\n\n– and if in doubt whether to choose the iPhone or iTunes route within the lane, choose iTunes. \n\nIf the routine for you is as good as for me in the UK, Apple's Express Lane will live up to its name – you'll be offered a list of appointments, choose a time, Apple will 'phone you, you'll feel that time spent on the 'phone was time well spent. \n", "Q: Cannot update Microsoft Office Word 2011 to 14.2.3 on OSX I just purchased Microsoft Office 2011 for MAC and installed it on my rMBP OSX 10.8.2 running Mountain Lion. The installed version from purchase is 14.2.0. I tried installing  14.2.3 but it failed due to a specific file that was not found :\nOffice 14.2.3 can't be installed on this disk.\nA version of the software required to install this update was not found on this volume. \n\n\nSo I went to the site and downloaded 14.2.1, but that didn't install either with the same message. Also tried 14.2.2, but still the same error.\nI want to add that the actual installation failed (tried twice), however Office 2011 appeared in the application folders and Word works fine.\nNot sure what can be causing this, any idea ?\n\nA: I had this issue once. I ended up backing up my data via Time Machine (for a get out of jail card) and then removing Office in it's entirety, rebooted my Macbook Pro, and then proceeded to reinstall Office 2011. Once I had the Office suite reinstalled the software  allowed me to apply all subsequent updates without issue. This worked for my particular instances / issue, results may vary depending on software environment.\n\nA: My guess is that problem is based on the initial installation having failed, and that the only way to fix it would be to forcibly remove all of your Office-related 'receipts' and try again.\nNote: THIS IS POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS AND I CANNOT PROMISE THAT IT WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEM. That being said, I tried it on my 'test system' and it appeared to work. FOR ME. YMMV.\n1) Move all of your 'com.microsoft' receipts to the Desktop:\nsudo mv -vf /private/var/db/receipts/com.microsoft.* ~/Desktop/\n\n2) Download and reinstall Microsoft Office 2011.\nNote that I have written a shell script to help facilitate this. You can find it at https://github.com/tjluoma/office2011/blob/master/office2011.sh\nAssuming you are comfortable with the Terminal.app, you can use the script like this:\ncd ~/Downloads/\n\ncurl --location --remote-name https://raw.github.com/tjluoma/office2011/master/office2011.sh\n\nchmod 755 office2011.sh\n\n./office2011.sh\n\nThat will download the official DMGs from Microsoft and use the official command-line package installer from Apple. Which means that it will not install if it finds matching receipts at /private/var/db/receipts/com.microsoft.*\nI strongly encourage you to ONLY try this IF you have a verified backup of your enter boot drive (SuperDuper or CarbonCopyCloner, not just TimeMachine).\n\nA: Its easy. Rename the folder where office resides back to Microsoft Office 2011. You probably changed it before hence it cannot find. \n", "Q: how stop google calendars repeating events on additional calendars This annoying behavior is that from time to time the additional calendars on my google account get repeated in the gmail account section and then in the Delegates section.

TRIM? I'm planning to add a Samsung 830 (256GB) SSD to a MacBook Pro 13\" (Mid-2012 model). It'll be installed into the default HDD area and the existing HDD will be moved into the optical drive bay.\nObviously Apple only enable TRIM on SSDs installed by themselves. Is there an official way to enable TRIM on an SSD the 'Apple way', or will TRIM Enabler be required? Can anyone offer some reassurance on using this software? I'm very wary of using it given that it's essentially a kernel hack. \n\nA: There is no official way to enable TRIM on non-Apple drives. In all likelihood, idle time garbage collection on a Samsung 830 will be sufficient to maintain performance so you might want to ignore TRIM unless you see a problem.\nI've been using that drive in a late-2007 MacBook for months even when the drive is full and have not seen any issues without TRIM. Not an exact comparison as the lower speed interface on mine might mask any problems but still a positive sign.\n\nA: The biggest argument I have against enabling TRIM is that TRIM is a SATA-only command.\nWhat if the SSD is connected via PCIe, USB 3.0, FireWire, or Thunderbolt the Mac won't even recognize the drive as an SSD.  Enabling TRIM would be USELESS for SSDs connected these other ways. \nSSDs (such as OWC Mercury SSDs with SandForce controllers) have evolved to the point they don't need TRIM - particularly when the SSDs are not attached via SATA?  They do their own garbage-collection and optimization.   OWC - in particular - advises against enabling TRIM since this increases wear and tear on their SSDs. TRIM adds extra unnecessary writes when the SSD already did this on its own.\n", "Q: What is the meaning of this status bar icon? What is this icon on the far right of the status bar?

I could just loop over all of them and check to see if they have any releases since the last one, but it would be much more efficient if I could select future releases.\nHow can I get anticipated releases via the iTunes API (or another one if this isn't possible)? I was thinking maybe preorders or there would be a list of upcoming releases for that week?\n\nA: It's a bit obscure, but iTunes actually offers email notifications for new releases by artists you select. To add an artist to the list, go to the artist's page within iTunes, and click the Alert Me link in the right sidebar, then click Manage My Alerts.\nYou'll see the artist has been added to the list (it may also contain artists you've previously purchased music from). Check the Send me email alerts about artists I've previously downloaded box to (surprise) get email when they release something. To add more artists, click the Alert Me on their page, then click OK.\nIf you don't want to use email for this, iTunes offers new release RSS feeds. You could filter these with something like Yahoo Pipes to get a feed with only the artists you're interested in.\nIt's worth noting that these both display new releases when they come out, not upcoming releases. As far as I can tell, Apple doesn't publish any upcoming release data, except for the pre-orders page, which doesn't seem to contain all upcoming releases, just featured ones.\n\nA: I track new releases of my favourite artist using free app in iTunes: Alerter\nI subscribe for artists, when new releases will be available on iTunes I'll get push notifications.

You can use iPhoto Library Manager by Fat Cat Software, which  has saved my photos in many situations. It is frequently updated for newer versions of iPhoto.\nSelect your library in IPLM and Command-E or File > Extract Photos...\n\nThis results in an Extracted Photos folder and a Modified and Originals folder inside.\n\nIf you prefer not to use third-party software, an alternate method is available.

Is it possible to change where macOS Notification Center alerts appear on the screen?\nThey currently appear at the top right of the screen with the menu bar:\n\nAlerts appearing in the top right tend to cover up work I'm doing more often than not. They cover up browser tabs, toolbar icons, and window titles.\nI would prefer, say, the bottom right corner of the screen.\nIf moving the alerts is not possible, is it possible to change the screen on which they appear?\n\nA: Not a very techy guy, and it's my first post here. But I found this and it works.\nhttps://github.com/Frostbitee08/NotificationShortcuts\nAn app that allows you to dismiss notifications with a shortcut!\n\n\nA: Swipe with two fingers on the banner pop up and it will remove it. Not the best answer but convenient for when I need to access a control or tab.\nSource: http://www.cultofmac.com/189192/\n\nA: You can adjust the time the notification is displayed on the screen: \nIn a terminal window type:\ndefaults write com.apple.notificationcenterui bannerTime SECONDS\n\nWhere SECONDS is the number of seconds the notice will remain visible.  Default is 5 seconds.\nLog out and in again to activate the setting.\nhttp://www.defaults-write.com/notification-center-change-banners-display-time\n\nA: I can't find a way to move it, but in searching on github, I found this pretty awesome hidden feature that lets you easily disable notifications.\n\n... you can hold option (alt) and click on the Notification Center icon to disable it\n\nEdit: Option click on the Date & Time in the upper right corner to toggle them on/off.\n\nA: Unfortunately, you can't change the screen position of the Notification Center Alerts and Banners. This is a huge gripe of mine as well, and I highly encourage you to complain about this issue to Apple here:\nhttp://www.apple.com/feedback/macos.html\nHopefully they will one day change this. I also have not been able to find or formulate any hacks.\nI, too, am annoyed by it covering up controls in my modeling applications, tabs in my browser, etc.\nYou can move the Notification Center to another screen, however your entire menu bar goes with it. When you have more than one monitor active, open up System Preferences > Displays > Arrangement. Click and drag the white bar inside one of the squares representing your current primary monitor and drag it to another monitor.\nFor notifications that don't need immediate attention, consider changing the alert style from Alerts to Banners. Banners are automatically dismissed into the notification center where you can find them later.\nGood luck, and keep spreading the word that we need to tell Apple to make this experience better.\n\nA: To improve this behavior somewhat, change the alert style from Alerts to Banners.\nBanners will at least go away automatically. Alerts will remain on screen until dismissed, blocking anything under them.\n\nI thought I was the only one who found this annoying.\n\nA: Short answer (TLDR):\nYou can't. Use focus and optional notification settings.\nLong answer:\nI despise the notifications as well. But that's what they are. Nagging little brats. Of course you could move them down all to the right. But that is not possible in early 2023. That position would be the perfect spot. But maybe not, because you might miss something down there. At least for me, that would be the case. So if you really need to focus and notifications are unbearable, QUICKFIX: just select focus for one hour - or longer. You don't like to be distracted right now anyway. Probably not even down to the right. So off they go. ALL of them. For one hour. But refrain from focus for forever unless you really don't want to receive any messages or calls at all.\nA longterm solution is to use custom focuses and optional enable notifications for wanted applications.\n", "Q: How to reset Logitech mouse's back/forward buttons? I've been using my Logitech Anywhere MX with my Mac succesfully for a couple of months, but suddenly last week the functionality of the back/forward buttons changed from navigating to previous/next page in history to switching to next/previous tab in Chrome. How can I restore the previous functionality?\nI've already checked the Logitech Control Center, and there the buttons are still defined as back and forward.\nNote: If I remember correctly, the buttons have never worked in Finder.\n\nA: As I mentioned in the comments, I found no other solution except changing the buttons to send the corresponding keystrokes. Fortunately, this works fine in almost every app I frequently use, including Finder.\nThe keystrokes I used were command+option+8 for back and command+option+9 for forward. Note that this is on a Finnish keyboard layout.\n", "Q: Disconnect external monitor without unplugging Mini DisplayPort Adapter Would like to disconnect my external monitor without unplugging the Mini DisplayPort Adapter. Any ideas? Running Mountain Lion, mid 2012 MacBook Pro.\nThe scenario: \nI have another Windows machine connected to this external display via VGA. So when I switch to my Windows machine, I would like to use the MacBook Pro without extending to the external monitor. It's too much an hassle to keep plugging out the Mini DisplayPort Adapter every time I switch. \nThe Windows machine has VGA connected all the time, but it has an option to select a laptop display only mode without extending to the external monitor. \nThanks.\n\nA: Do you mean you want to leave the secondary monitor plugged into the computer, but not use it?\nYou can go to System Preferences > Displays > Arrangement and check the Mirror Displays checkbox. Make sure your primary display is set to the laptop's built-in display. Then just shut the secondary monitor off (so you don't see the mirrored display).\nNow all your windows will be on the primary monitor and you won't be able to drag any to (or open any on) the secondary monitor, but it will still be plugged into the computer.\n\nA: There is a program that will allow you to switch the menu bar back to your MBP screen via the command line. It can be downloaded at: http://www.pyehouse.com/cscreen/\nSince you are leaving the external monitor connected your MBP thinks it's still active and you will have to use cscreen to switch the menubar back to the MBP screen. Or manually do it via Display system preferences. \n\nA: I will going to repeat daGUY's solution with extra explanation:\nSo if you're using your Mac with the external display, you're 'extending' your desktop. That means, those displays are presenting different content, and you may have dock and the menu bar on just one display.\nThat's say, you want to switch to your Windows machine, and you've switched your display's input to display Windows machine's desktop. Here's the problem, your dock is still on the external display!\nHere's why DaGUY suggest you to use mirroring mode, mirroring mode make both displays present the exact same content, which means one dock but displaying at both displays. \nHere's a few problem you may run into,\na) Resolution - You want your resolution to match your laptop screen's, and that might be an extra step, and sometimes might not work\nb) SO MANY STEPS! - You got to go into System Preferences, click on Displays, and check that checkbox that reads \"Mirror Display\". Luckily, there's an app for that, here's the link: https://itunes.apple.com/tw/app/id549083868?mt=12\nThis app will put the option on the menu bar, and make it easier to change resolution, AND, it's free.\nI'll upload photos soon.\nHere's before mirroring: \nHere's after mirroring, and you can see I checked \"Mirror Displays\" in the menubar, that's the app I mentioned. You can do fine without it, just a few extra clicks:\nPlease, do comment if you have further questions.\nEDIT: Added photos\n\nA: switchresx (http://www.madrau.com/) will allow you to do this.  You can set up a display profile with the external monitor disabled.  Note that with Mavericks, this functionality can be a bit problematic depending on how Spaces is set up.\n\nA: *\n\n*Does your shared monitor have a physical or electronic way to switch among input sources? I share a large monitor between a Mini with its own monitor and a MacBook Pro. Both machines stay connected to the shared monitor all the time. The shared monitor has a button to bring up its settings, so I can hit the button then move up or down to select which computer uses the shared display.\n\n*Then when you switch the shared display away from your laptop, you need a way to see things the laptop had been showing on the shared monitor. I originally looked for a command or a script to make OS X \"de-extend\" the laptop's display, but didn't find anything. I finally settled on a little app called Moom, which deftly handles re-sizing windows and, importantly for this case, moving windows between displays. If I turn back to the laptop, and see that the window I want is being projected to the shared monitor (but not showing because the other computer is displaying), then I use a keyboard command to invoke Moom and then hit an arrow key to move the desired window into view on the laptop screen. (I first heard about Moom here at Ask Different; have had it for several months and am over my skepticism about needing a third-party utility for this use. The window-resizing is also very handy. I have no connection to them.)\n\n", "Q: Download iOS updates using a File and not from iTunes or have to connect to Internet According to this article, one can upgrade iOS using the following methods\n\n\n*\n\n*via Wireless\n\n*via iTunes\n\n\nSo, is it possible for user to download the iOS as a file (and not via iTunes) and later copy to the iPhone and update it from the phone without having the phone to connect to the internet?\n\nA: Yes, it's possible.

I recently found my old iPhone 3G with iOS version 3.1.2. I'm planning to let my 4-year old nephew to use it. But then, I'm having a problem on installing apps like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. because these apps only support iOS 5.0 or later. \nHow can I install the apps I mentioned? \n\nA: Note: This answer is no longer valid.\n(See @stuffe's answer on how to install apps onto old versions of iOS)\n\nThe short answer is there is no way to install an app that was created for an iOS newer then the one you are running. You should connect the device to iTunes and see if you can get it updated to the latest 4.x iOS as many games and apps that target the 4 to 8 year old demographics will certainly work on that older OS.\n\nThe longer answer (and some related discussion on this site) is that developers of more powerful apps want to use the latest APIs that are introduced every iOS, and for a developer to create an app for an older iOS version, would mean he couldn't use the newer tools. Worse, it's more work to keep using the older API so cutting them makes schedule and financial sense. For example, a resource known as ARC (Automatic Resource Counting) has made a huge difference in reducing the time and cost of app development by automatically doing things that otherwise the developer would have had to manage.\nBecause these necessary APIs don't exist on pervious iOS versions, there is no way to run a newer app on an older iOS. Hopefully you can use the web versions or find acceptable apps to do the things you need this device to do to continue to be of use.\n\nA: As of the time this question and most of the answers was posted, it was not possible, however it is now possible to do this on an iPhone 3g running iOS 4.2.1 though not iOS 3.1.2.  Simply try to download any app, and if the current version is not compatible with your device or OS, and a suitable older version existed at some point in the past that was compatible, if will offer to let you download that most recent compatible version instead.\n\nOwners of iPad 1s and 3G/3GS devices or older iPods rejoice!\n\nA: In general, you can't.\nApple hase changed their most current releases of their iPhone development tools so that the minimum Deployment Target is iOS 4.3.  Thus, any apps built with the current version of Xcode will not run on devices running older OS versions.  Any developer who wants their apps to look good, or use the latest features on the latest devices (iPhone 5, etc.), can no longer submit apps or updates compatible with iOS 3.x.  So a vast percentage of apps updated since Sept. 2012 are no longer compatible with an iPhone 3G, since a 3G can not be upgraded to iOS 4.3.\nThe iTunes App store only offers downloads of the latest version of an app from the App store, so older versions are no longer available (except to customers who have previously downloaded these old versions and made backups in case iTunes tries to trash these working versions.)\nA few developers still use older development tools; and some apps have not been updated recently.  Those fewer apps are the apps suitable for you device.  But they may or may not be the ones you want.\n", "Q: Fresh Install of Mountain Lion on MacBook Pro Retina that upgraded via a voucher I want to do a fresh install of Mountain Lion.

I am using Word 2011 on my Lion iMac.  Sometimes as I write, when I hit the \"double-quote\" key, I don't get double-quotes, but another symbol that looks like \"double-less-thans\" or \"double-greater-thans\" (see the word \"gains\" in the screen capture below).  My work-around is to delete the unwanted symbols, use the \"copy-formatting\" command and copy the format from some other paragraph, and then add the double-quotes back.\nWhy am I getting these unwanted symbols?  How do I stop them from coming back?\n\n\nA: This probably happens because Word uses language settings for a language that uses “chevrons” (double angle quotation marks) as quotation marks, such as French. By default, Word auto-corrects Ascii quotation marks (\") to language-specific marks, e.g. to “smart” curly quotes for English. The fix is to change the language setting (click on the language indicator for this). It won’t change the quotes already entered, so you need to fix them separately.\nBy default, Word uses language guessing: it tries to infer the language of text from the text itself. It sometimes guesses wrong. I don’t see why this would have happened here, as the text looks like normal English. But maybe the language setting was originally e.g. French and language guessing was off?\nIt’s odd that Word uses «gains», because by French rules, the quotation marks should be separated from the word with fine spaces. The Windows versions of Word therefore insert normal spaces: « gains ». This isn’t quite correct, as the spaces should be fine, narrower, and maybe the Mac version therefore doesn’t introduce the spaces. Or maybe it is applying the rules of some language that uses chevrons without spaces.\n", "Q: iMac restart issue I've got a 21.5\", late 2011 iMac which has been acting up lately: after a normal shutdown, the computer would hang at the Apple logo, with the spinning 'loading' wheel below it. I managed to fix this issue the first time by booting into Recovery HD and, through Disk Utility, verifying disk permissions and repairing them (diskutil found about 30 errors at that time). That made the computer work for a few days, but after restarting again yesterday, the problem returned.\nI went back into Recovery > Disk Utility, and verified the permissions, but found no issues. I still ran a permission repair, and even verified the disk, only to find out that the disk is \"OK\". I ran the disk repair tool, and then restarted.

Are there any issues with using a non-Apple storage device for Time Machine that might prevent me from doing what I've described above?\nIf Time Machine\n\nA: Question 1\nYes, all Time Machine backups are full directory structures of your entire disk (minus backup exclusions). Each backup is made up of hardlinks to unchanged files so each backup appears to be a \"full\" backup from Finder.\nOpen your Time Machine volume in Finder (may be within a sparsebundle if you backup over the network) and you should see a folder called Backups.backupdb and under that the machine's hostname. Each backup has a folder in the format YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.\nSystem files are under Library and System. All of your user preferences will be under Users/Username/Library.\nQuestion 2\nFor user data you can just back up the Library folder. For system stuff you can copy /Library (note that this is separate to the Library folder in your home directory), but it might be better to use a product such as SuperDuper! or Carbon Copy Cloner.\nHowever by default Time Machine will be backing up the entire disk so you should be fine. When you reinstall your OS, you'll get a chance to restore the entire system from a Time Machine backup. If you choose not to do this, when you first boot the new OS you get another chance to restore applications and user data.\nOn a personal note, I use a combination of SuperDuper! (weekly full system backups to a bootable firewire drive) and Time Machine (incremental backups).\n", "Q: How can I request a status update on an apple bug report? So I was reading the FAQ for Apple's bug reporter site and I came across this: \nTo request a status on an existing issue, please update your report directly via the\nApple Bug Reporter requesting a status update and we will provide you with any\navailable information.\n\nI got curious about this, and I went back to bugreport.apple.com to look at one of my pending bug reports and I didn't see any way of explicitly asking for a status update. I feel that I'm missing something obvious, because I expect the FAQ to be correct, but so far I haven't got the faintest. Any help?\n\nA: It's as simple as posting new details on your bug with a sentence requesting a status update. There is no dedicated button to do this. From personal experience I doubt you'll get any helpful information though. Many things in Radar live there for years…\n", "Q: Can I use Open Office on my new MacBook Air? I just downloaded Open Office to my Mac Book Air and installed it. When I tried to open it a message came up saying it's developed by an unidentified source and my computer settings only allow installation of programs from Mac App Store or identified developers. I don't know anything about code. What can I do?\n\nA: You have just seen GateKeeper in action.\nIf you are confident you downloaded a safe copy of the program, you can tell your Mac to \"trust\" that program and let it past the gate.\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click on the icon\n\n*Select Open\n\n*Read the dialog and agree or disagree to let that program run\n\n\nThe linked article above goes into much detail on GateKeeper and I would scan it and review the steps above. If you find a lot of software you need triggers the warning, you could relax the settings, but I prefer to keep them at the defaults as I like to know when new code runs on my Mac.\n", "Q: Google Calendar sync not working in Mountain Lion Last week my OS X Calendar stopped syncing to Google Calendar. Past events are still there, but new events aren't pushed to Google anymore.\nI already tried deleting Calendar's/iCals Cache and Settings, removing the Google Calendar entirely and adding it back again. No success so far.\nDoes anybody know about a way to debug CalDAV syncing on OS X? Is there a issue with Google's servers?\nAny help is appreciated.\n\nA: I started encountering a similar problem with my Google for Business account last week. Mail.app was okay but Calendar refused to sync, returning the error message that \"Your calendar URL is not a location that supports this request.\" every time Calendar tried to sync.\nThe solution was delete the account completely from System Preferences -> Mail, Contacts & Calendars. Generate a new one-time password for the account (I use two-factor authentication on all my Google accounts). And the re-add the account in that System Preferences pane.\nAll is well now after doing this.\n\nA: Note this problem occurred for me after changing my Google password.\nOn starting Calendar (a week or two after changing my password) it asked me for my password, as it couldn't access my Google account [expected behaviour]. I gave it my new password, and it seemed happy. HOWEVER the problem still remained.\nThe fix is definitely like the other poster mentioned, although you don't need to re-add the account, you only need to change the password in System Preferences > Mail, Contacts & Calendars.\nTo check if it's worked you will need to force a re-sync in iCal. Go to Calendar > Preferences... > Accounts > Google CalDAV > Account Information > Refresh Calendars: Every minute. Now wait a minute or so and the new events should be added. You can change this refresh rate back to your preferred setting afterwards.\nThis worked for me and i hope it works for anyone else who stumbles upon this thread :)\n\nA: I unchecked and rechecked the \"Calendar & Reminders\" option under the \"Mail, Contacts & Calendars\" preferences pane for my affected Google account. That seems to have done the trick so far (without having to delete and recreate my account)… I manually refreshed the affected calendar, and it updated without complaint.\n", "Q: Subtitle settings in iTunes content on iOS are wrong I am watching Quantum of Solace on my iPhone 5 (iOS 6.0.1), purchased from iTunes.\nI noticed that the subtitles were in Spanish. I thought maybe the setting was wrong, but it was set to \"Off\". I then tried to switch the setting from \"Off\" to \"US English\", and now the subtitles disappeared.\nSo, \"Subtitles: Off\" gives me Spanish, \"Subtitles: US English\" gives me nothing.\nIs it possible that the movie itself is messed up? All my other movies seem to be working fine, it's just this one, so I'm thinking it's not my phone.\nEdit: A little further into the movie now, and the settings are back to normal. English is English, and Off is Off. But the first few minutes are still screwed up. I'm thinking it's a problem with iTunes.\n\nA: It's possible that the Spanish subs are hardcoded into the movie (i.e. part of the video track, not a separate track). This is often the case for English language films with small portions of foreign languages. My copy of Quantum of Solace (not from iTunes) has some hardcoded subs for Spanish parts around the 28 minute mark (haven't watched the full movie in some time, there may be others).\nI'm not sure that would explain why the English subtitle selection doesn't display anything however.\n", "Q: How would I prepend 127.0.0.1 as a nameserver all the time I do web development and I would like to have dnsmasq running and handing my local dns requests. However I work in a lot of different networking scenarios and I need to DHCP updating my networking information multiple times a day.\nI already have dnsmasq running and I can have my laptop always use it by setting the DNS name server.\nIt's not too bad, this way, I can use the location management (in the network preference pane) and just switch location between 'Automatic' and 'Automatic (dnsmasq)' when I need to, however what I really want it something linux has.\nIn linux I can configure my dhcp client to prepend a name server to whatever I get from dhcp. On ubuntu I do this by editing /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf and setting.\nprepend domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1;\n\nIs there an equivalent in OS X (10.8 Mountian Lion). Thanks\n\nA: As you already know, OS X will overwrite any changes you make to /etc/resolv.conf so you can't really specify your own nameserver in there. Luckily, there is a way to add your own resolver entries in a way that will persist whatever network connection you use whilst still using DHCP assigned name servers for most normal lookups.\nCreate the directory /etc/resolver and create a text file within it that simply has a standard name server directive like nameserver 127.0.0.1. Make sure this text file is named the same as the domain or TLD you wish to use dnsmasq for. In my case, all my development sites end with the .dev TLD so my config file is named /etc/resolver/dev.\nAnd that's it! From now on, when ever you connect to a network using DHCP, your name servers will be automatically assigned and used as normal but any requests for your specified TLD (*.dev in my example) will be routed to dnsmasq.\n", "Q: Installing a specific iOS on a new iPad I've just bought a new 3rd Gen iPad as a gift.  I assume it comes with iOs 5.1 installed on it.  I want to install iOS 5.1.1 on it as I'd rather not use the Maps app provided in iOS 6.  I know that iTunes will only offer the latest version of iOS (6.0.1 at this time.)\nHow can I download and install iOS 5.1.1 to a new iPad?  I am not willing to jailbreak it.\n\nA: There is a lot of information covering this exact topic in a question that I asked a while back:  https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/65952/how-to-upgrade-iphone-3gs-to-ios-5-now-that-ios-6-is-out\nThe accepted answer provided me with this link: http://www.felixbruns.de/iPod/firmware/\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Safari not saving password on iPhone 4 I have the AutoFill option enabled in my Safari settings, and I am not doing Private Browsing. However, Safari will not offer to save my Ebay password no matter how many times I log in. I have also tried clearing cookies and history. Anyone have any ideas?\n\nA: The eBay mobile site requests Safari not to have passwords saved, and Safari honors it.\neBay is not the only site that behaves like this, PayPal is another prominent example. Many online banking sites (that I know of) prevent autofill too. \nOn a desktop browser you can get around this limitation with an extension (see for example https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4160095?start=15&tstart=0). I don't think you can force your iPhone to ignore it. You can download eBay's app, though.\nThe technical explanation is that the username field in the login page sets autocomplete to off and so prevents autofill:\n\n< input type=\"text\" name=\"userName\" id=\"v4-0\" value=\"\" autocomplete=\"off\">\n\nTo see this fragment of HTML I changed my browser's user agent to Safari iOS 5.1 (I use Safari 6 on OS X):\n\nloaded https://signin.mobileweb.ebay.com/login?mfs=ftr, showed the page source and searched for autocomplete.\n", "Q: Getting YouTube back on Apple TV As of the latest Apple TV software update, YouTube is no longer showing up on the home screen, apparently replaced by Vimeo (which I like, but which has a very limited video selection). Is there any way to get YouTube back on the Apple TV home screen?\n\nA: You might have turned off YouTube under Settings -> General -> Privacy.  Check there, and then toggle it back to SHOW.  If this was the problem, please \"Accept\" the answer.\n\nA: I don't think Apple has removed YouTube.  Try logging out of your iTunes account, then back in.\n\nA: Which generation Apple TV is this on? YouTube has been removed from all but the 3rd gen hardware as Google retired the API in use as of April 20 2015   (Announcement)\n\nA: You can't get this YouTube channel back until Google re opens its streaming feed API for older devices.  They probably won't until they can rewrite it to incorporate in-stream ads. \n", "Q: XQuartz disk image won't open Every time I try to open the .dmg to install XQuartz, a window pops up saying the following disk images couldn't be opened and the reason shown is not recognized. I don't know if I need another application to open it or if the file is corrupted, or if it's some other problem entirely.\n\nA: I'd say the file downloaded is corrupted, you should be able to open the .dmg by simply double clicking it (I downloaded XQuartz a couple of days ago and could open the .dmg without a problem).\nUnfortunately, the download page doesn't provide a checksum to check against, so I'll provide the one I generated:\n\n98b2ca8580046d5b91250c5a244c8182437dc9d7\n\nThis checksum uniquely identifies the XQuarz .dmg.\nYou can generate a checksum of XQuartz on your Mac like this (from http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1652):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal (in /Application/Utilities)\n\n*Type:\nopenssl sha1 ~/Downloads/XQuartz-2.7.4.dmg \n(adapt to the path where XQuartz-2.7.4.dmg was downloaded)\n\n*Compare the number you get with the number above.

I've checked here and the 'Darwin Technologies' link there but couldn't seem to find anything. I want the Darwin (not any derivatives) and would much rather it from an official Apple source, sorry I'm so picky.\n\nA: Unfortunately, ISO files are no longer made available. From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_%28operating_system%29#History:\n\nUp to Darwin 8.0.1, Apple released a binary installer (as an ISO\n  image) after each major Mac OS X release that allowed one to install\n  Darwin on PowerPC and Intel x86 computers as a standalone operating\n  system. Minor updates were released as packages that were installed\n  separately. Darwin is now only available as source code,[4] except for\n  the ARM variant, which has not been released in any form separately\n  from iOS. However, the older versions of Darwin are still available in\n  binary form.\n[4] http://lists.apple.com/archives/Darwinos-users/2007/Oct/msg00006.html\n\n\nA: The older (8 and earlier) releases were released as binary images. Some are available for download at this Apple site.\nSee this mailing list post for more information.\n\nA: Darwin 8.0.1 is the latest release. If at some point the download is removed, there is an archived version available.\nFor earlier releases, check the archived list of Darwin images.\n", "Q: Mountain Lion on Unibody late-2008 Macbook? I'm currently having a late-2008 Unibody Macbook with Snow Leopard installed. It runs really great!\nHowever, I'm thinking of installing Mountain Lion. Mainly to use Filevault 2.\nWill my Macbook run with ML?\nIt has the following specs:\n2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo \n4GB 1066 MHz DDR3 \n40GB Intel 320 SSD\n\n\nA: Your system specs are above the minimum requirements, so you should be fine. Lion and Mountain Lion do require more than the 2 GB RAM than Snow Leopard needs to run smoothly, in my experience. You've already got 4 GB, so that should be okay for all but the most busy systems with many large apps running simultaneously. \n\nA: Your specs look good. I have a 2005 MBP and really the only place I suffer is HD write speeds bottleneck. A RAM upgrade would be highly recommended and relatively inexpensive if you plan to have many apps running simultaneously. My personal experience is that you will suffer from performance issues and some interesting glitches (icon drag, display sleep problems) unless you do a clean install.  \n\nA: I did and ruin my computer was very slow and the wifi worked poorly\n", "Q: iCal/Calendar and GMail - constantly errors and problems I'm using iCal/Calendar on MacOSX 10.8.2 and have one main account on GMail. It mostly works.\nHowever, about every 1 minute - 12 hours (it really varies a lot), I get some errors from iCal that it couldn't find the CalDAV calendar or it got error 404. But then it works again. (It looks similar to this error although the suggestions there don't help me.)\nAlso, in addition to that, I have some sub-calendars (e.g. for birthdays). Mostly they show up in iCal, sometimes also twice (and then I have all entries double) and sometimes they completely disappear.\nThis is really annoying. So annoying that I want to have this resolved or I must find an alternative to iCal. I don't always want to click 'ok' on this error dialog. I also don't want to hope for luck that it shows my sub-calendars.\nIs there some way to fix this? Or what are good alternatives to iCal?\n\nA: The last post on the first page of this discussion states it is a known Google problem. (I haven't personally verified its accuracy, though).\nQuoting @Kjell-o:\n\nJust so everyone is aware. The issue is indeed in Google's system, not in iCal. They are working on a solution. I received this directly from their enterprise support. If you look at the calendar logs, you'll see a ton of error for the calendar service - I'm getting ones that say, premature EOF.\nOn another note, the google forums say that the shared calendars no longer act as \"delegates\" but as normal calendars and as a result they show up in the regular list. This may be the \"duplicates\" that some people are receiving. If this is you, uncheck the delegates as those will be superflous and most likely the cause of the 404 messages.\n\n", "Q: Cannot differentiate between LEFT ⌘ (0x37) and RIGHT ⌘ (0x36) keys I would like to swap the right-⌘ key with the right-⌥ key.\n\nKeyRemap4MacBook's EventViewer shows that Alt Gr key acts as the left-⌘ (Command_L in EventViewer), whereas I'd like to be the right-⌘ (Command_R).\nThis is what it look like in EventViewer: first 2 lines are from left-⌘, next 2 lines are from right-⌘ (with the same 0x37 code):\n\nHow can I get the right-⌘ key to register as Command_R (0x36) instead of Command_L (0x37)?\nAbout the keyboard\nIt's the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 with its drivers installed and setup like this:\n\nI'll try my luck with uninstalling the drivers (which don't cause kernel panics anymore, as described here).\n\nA: Why didn't it try this before?

Now I can't restart this macbook until the installer finishes.\nIs there a easy way to locate what process is preventing my mac from restarting? \n\n\nA: Killing \"installd\" with Activity Monitor seems to have fixed the problem for me.\n\nA: You could just force your computer to switch off and then restart it. Just push the \"Power On/Off\" button for a few seconds.\nYou could also open the Activity Monitor application and check if there is a corrupted process. \n\nA: I had the same problem with Google Voice and Video:\nYour computer can't be restarted now, because software is being installed.\nGoogle Voice and Video is being installed. Interrupting the install may damage your computer. You can restart when the install is complete.\n\nFirst of all, find the process PID in Activity Monitor or using ps wuax in Terminal e.g. by: ps wuax | grep install.\nIf you can't find it, try to move the window as fast as possible and check which process takes CPU time.\nIn Activity Monitor you can actually take a Sample of the process what's doing.\nOr by debugging it from Terminal sudo dtruss -fp 1234\nIf this does nothing, try to send hang up signal first to the process what it would do by (replace 1234 with your Process ID number):\nsudo kill -HUP 1234\n\nthen if nothing happens, try to kill it softly by:\nsudo kill 1234\n\nif it's still not killed, then try it hardly by:\nsudo kill -9 1234\n\n\nOther method is to use xkill if you've this tool installed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run: xkill\n\n*Click on the window which you want to kill.\n\n\nDone.\n\nAnother easy method is to press Alt+CMD+Esc, then popup should appear, and you can select and kill the process.\n\nA: The Microsoft Office Installer should have an icon in the Dock, just right-click it and choose \"Quit\" for hold the option key and choose \"Force Quit\" then shutdown or run the installer again. I have had to do that a couple of times due to hangs during the Office 2013 install, although I did not do a shutdown, just force quit and run installer again has worked for me.\nEDIT\nSince this does not work for you you can use the Activity Monitor or \"ps -ef\" to find the processes and kill them.\n", "Q: iPhone app that displays temperature as a notification badge I'm looking for an app similar to Fahrenheit, that gives a notification badge indication of the current temperature.

I need something that updates the badge at least every 30 minutes (so I don't have to open up the app to get it to refresh).\n\nA: There are several Weather Apps that perform this function. The one I am currently using (as I live in Canada and it has good Canadian weather support) is Degrees.\nYou could also try Weather Live or eWeather HD. I'm sure there are many more.\nOne limitation of those badges, if you live in a part of the world like mine, is lack of negative numbers in the badge.

This is just for internal filing reasons. \nSay, for example, you get sent an email with the subject line 'attn:sam'. That subject line doesn't really help me if I want to go back and find it, so could I rename that subject line somehow?\n\nA: While technically it's possible, it's not trivial. You would have to write an applescript to search/replace the contents of your subject field and then use apple mail filters and run applescript based on your rule.\nThis is commonly done in the unix world via procmail, for example when spamassassin detects spam, procmail appends SPAM to the email subject message.\nit might be better to set up rules based on subject to filter your mail into separate boxes for organization.\n\nA: There is a (somewhat convoluted) way to do it:\nTo edit a message in a Mac OS X Mail folder:\n\n\n*\n\n*Drag and drop the desired message out of Mac OS X Mail onto the Desktop\n\n*Ctrl-click on the message copy on the Desktop. Select Open With > TextEdit from the menu\n\n*Make the desired changes to the message source. To change a message's subject, look for \"Subject:\" at the beginning of a line starting from the top\n\n*Close TextEdit saving the document\n\n*Ctrl-click on the message on the Desktop again. Select Open With > Mail from the menu\n\n*Now select Message > Copy To followed by the message's original folder from the menu in Mac OS X Mail\n\n*Close the message window\n\n*Delete the message copy from your Desktop, and optionally, delete the original message in Mac OS X Mail\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Actually there isn't a way for renaming the \"Subject\" field. It wouldn't be the right way in my opinion.\nI think you should leverage on \"Mailbox\" and/ord \"Smart Mailbox\" for organizing your mails. They help you when you have to find a mail for a specific \"topic\".\n\nA: *\n\n*Copy a \"unique\" bit of text (this can be large, even a paragraph, but it must be unique) and paste it into \"Spotlight\" to search for the actual email message you want to alter.\n\n*Once the email message is identified by Spotlight, right click on it and choose \"open with\", then \"other\" and navigate to TextEdit.  Open that mail message with TextEdit.\n\n*The text will have a lot of code in it but the message is there and can be edited and then saved.  Once saved, the mail program will reflect the edited version of the message.\n\n*You may have to reselect that mail message to see the modified version of it.\nThis has worked for me in doing things like deleting a password that was emailed to me on a message that I wanted to keep, or correcting an error in the text or adding a note at the top of the text.  However, I haven't modified the subject field.  This might act differently since it is displayed in other places in Mail.  Something may have to \"update\" before a changed subject header is reflected in the lists.  Experiment a little to see what works.\n\nA: It's possible \nif you move (drag & drop) the Mail from the inbox to the mail drafts folder.\nThere you can edit the mail by doupble-klicking, \nchange the subject or text,\nclose it and \nmove it again to the inbox.\nUnfortunately the time-stamp is adapted as well.\n", "Q: What Twitter apps work with a Retina display? \nUpdate: Twitter for Mac is now supported by Retina and available through the app store.\n\nAs many have noticed, the Twitter App doesn't render sharply on a Retina display.\nSome say Tweetbot is the app to get for Retina compatibility, but it costs $19.99. That's a tough cost to swallow when, historically, most Twitter apps have been free.\nIs there an alternative cheap or free Twitter app that supports Retina display?\n\nA: There are several complicated and time-limited things that are causing apps like Tweetbot to very likely get all shut down by Twitter in the near future.\nMy impression is the high price of Tweetbot not only reflects the high cost that the developers spent to make such a complicated and design intensive app, but also to discourage too many people from \"trying\" it out as well as a calculation that they need to make their investment back sooner rather than later due to the uncertainty of being dependent on Twitter's API rule changes.\nTwitter is in the process of shutting down all third party apps that replicate what you see at http://twitter.com in terms of showing you the timeline.\n\n\n*\n\n*Twitter under fire as Tweetro for Windows 8 blocked to new users\nIn a nutshell - in the last 12 months, Twitter has been telling developers to not make apps like Tweetbot since they replicate the core twitter experience and the 100,000 user token limit is really making it impossible for a team of talented professionals to recoup their costs without charging for an app since you need way more than 100,000 users to make money on data or advertising.\nTwitter wants to make money, developers want to make money, so at the moment the development of great, free twitter apps isn't exactly a hotbed of innovation in 2012 like it was in the past.\nMany in the development community had assumed that Twitter would bend the rules when their app wasn't ready, but with the Windows 8 release, they shut down the most popular client when it hit 100,000 user-tokens even though Twitter doesn't even have a windows 8 client (perhaps yet). When that happened, I imagine a lot of projects are being dropped or at least halted. Not only is Twitter putting hard limits on third party app growth, it also is getting more and more exacting in telling these devs exactly how a tweet must be shown (with the implied threat that they will shut down those apps if they fail to comply to Twitter's exact design standards which include serving all promotional content)\nSo, now that a brief back story is complete, here is your answer:\nThe following OS X twitter clients have been viewed to broadly and/or fully support retina display Macs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Twitterrific by the iconfactory\n\n*Hibari by Victoria Wang\n\n*Tweetbot by Tapbots\nBoth Hibari and Twitterrific have free downloads so you can try them both before buying. Check all of them as one is on sale now for half price and prices can change over time. All of the above render text with great precision and have all or many of the app's graphics in retina. Of course the twitter stream has many non-retina people thumbnails, etc...\n", "Q: Whole family uses same AppleID - can I block them from receiving my iMessages? The whole family uses the same Apple ID. I have been told this is not good. Now, my kids and wife are receiving all my iMessages. Is there a way to stop this without having access to their devices?  Long story short, separation and ugly divorce under way.  \n\nA: If it is your Apple ID - you should log in and Manage your Apple ID to change the password, remove all emails that are not yours, and update addresses / phone numbers so that only your personal ones are listed.\nIf the ID is not yours, you will either need to trust that the person controlling the account has done this or open an Apple ID support ticket to ask what the legal department contact information is so that you can justify to an Apple employee why they would modify an existing record to detach any of your personal data from an account you no longer control.\nObviously, your phone number is yours, so you can set up a new Apple ID and register that phone number to correspond to your new Apple ID and that would mean that \"your messages\" would only go to the \"old Apple ID\" if people keep sending messages to that email. This only matters if you use an iPhone with iMessage and not an email address.\n", "Q: Remote Desktop Connection session to windows server 2008 problem with licensing I cannot log in with my credentials using Remote Desktop Connection v2.1.1 (up to date) session to windows server 2008.

Is there an official way provided by Apple or a workaround so that I can install or update Mac App Store apps through Terminal?\n\nA: Until recently, the answer was no but there are open source efforts to replicate the Mac App Store in a command-line based tool:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/mas-cli/mas\nTo install:\nbrew install mas \n\nOnce it's in, you could update all the apps that are available with:\nmas upgrade\n\n\nIf you don't like this tool, you could also use MDM tools to package an already downloaded application and distribute it internally. Examples are Casper Suite, sftp, rsync, etc... and side load these apps. You do need to use the GUI or the mas tool to get the first copy of the application, however. So, if you already have the app, you can file share it over, but you can't get the App updated or installed solely from the terminal.\nIn a nutshell - you would set up an MDM server (there are now open source options) like:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/project-imas/mdm-server\nThen you would make your own App Store app that's amenable to command line updates. For that munki is a nice open-source choice:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.munki.org\nFrom there you could package the app updates and server them side loaded or use the InstallApplication MDM command to trigger an app install or update. Do note, that if you are pulling the app or the update from Apple's servers - you still need the user to enter their Apple ID and password in the prompt that OS X provides for the update. This does bypass opening the App Store app so it's a partial win, I suppose.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://enterprisemac.bruienne.com/2015/11/17/installing-os-x-pkgs-using-an-mdm-service/\nAt present, the command line can only list software updates that come through the App Store the same as the previous Software Update server was used to download system updates and updates to apps that came on physical media. Terminal is not able to update apps that were bought electronically through the Mac App Store. Only some Apple apps are included in the updates using the softwareupdate command.\n\nA: Note: This will only work on machines with an OS prior to macOS 10.7\nThere is a commandline app called softwareupdate that you have to run as root. \nsudo softwareupdate --list for example will give you the list of apps that are set to update. You can then run sudo softwareupdate --install {app-name}\nThis won't let you install a new application that you haven't already downloaded though.\n", "Q: What kit enables iPhone or iPad use for wearable computing? I am wondering if there are wearable computer kits for the iPhone or iPad, or are there resources on how to do it.\nI would like to be able to, at a bare minimum, type text while walking, possibly do more like read text documents.\n\nA: Wearable computing is an interesting problem. You can do some of it by getting something like the google glasses, which won't be released until next year at about $1500, or finding a vendor for the project. You would then have to get the adapter for your iDevice to output svga/dvi and interface that with the HUD (Heads up display)\nNext, for input, you would likely have to get a bluetooth keyboard. There used to be a frogpad (not sure if they still make them) that supports bluetooth, but it is a chorded keyboard. Chorded keyboards take some getting used to, but can be very good and very fast once you do.\nAt the moment, I don't know of a kit you can buy to do this, it will likely take some work sourcing the parts like the glasses and keyboard.\n\nA: The GoPad should work with iPads 2 through 4.\nGoPad http://than.mn/pk\n", "Q: Best way to isolate iMac internet connection problem in small office? I manage a small office that is 7 macs and 1 PC.  One 2010 iMac in aprticular has ongoing internet connectivity issues where it says it's connected (via Network Diagnostics) but it goes out again intermittently (all other computers maintain network connectivity without issue). The computer is connected via ethernet 10ft away from the router.  On occasion I have it login wirelessly and the issue goes away then comes back again\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the best workflow of tests to run to isolate this annoying\nissue? I'm not at this location all day and it occurs when I'm not usually there.  My concern is it may be the ethernet board which may be difficult to isolate.\n\n*Are there any particular tests I can run to isolate where\nalong the computer to network path, the issue is occurring? \n\n*Should I just change the ethernet cable first?  I believe I already had done so on\nthis machine... \n\n*Is Network diagnostics reliable? \n\n*Should I just\ntrying pinging Google from the command line? \n\n*Should I watch the\nSystem Prefs panel and look for the self-managed IP or look for an\nIP lease from the router?\n\n\nThanks\nUPDATE\nHere's some console.log entries.  The App store connectivity issue happened when I was trying to download Mountain Lion to upgrade the machine and is evidence of the reoccurring issue.  The internet connectivity just disappears.

A bad cable or a bad switch port is at least as likely as a bad ethernet port on the iMac. I would start by swapping the cable and switch port for known good ones. Swap the cable and port with a computer that you are sure does not demonstrate the problem. Write down what you did, and when you did it, for future reference.\nIf that computer develops a similar problem and the iMac is fine, then you know it is either the switch port or the cable. Move the known-good cable to the suspect port. If the cable is bad, cut it in half so no one tries to use it again. If the port is bad, block it with something - like the cut-off tail of a bad cable.\nAfter you have verified the cable and switch port, you can go back to suspecting the iMac ethernet port. Maybe buy a cheap USB ethernet adapter, and switch that iMac to it? If that fixes the problem, then you know it was the ethernet port. If not, it's probably something in the software configuration.\n\nA: Is this a wireless or wired network? Sometimes if you have a wired network and the wireless device is on and associated, it will break routing. Generally speaking you want to choose one or the other. So if you are wired, disable the wireless device.\nOther then that, network diag is pretty reliable and pinging google (or any other internet site) is good. \n", "Q: Mail.app smart mailbox, how to negate a search filter clause (_not_ flagged)?

The first is known as the Tab Title and affects the terminal window title (but only when that tab is selected). The second is the Tab Subtitle and affects the text in the tab header only. [The naming seems strange, with Tab Title affecting the title of the window, and Tab Subtitle affecting the title of the tab.]\nPreferring osascript, but open to other approaches, I wish to programmatically get both of these titles for each tab. In going through AppleScript dictionaries, Cocoa framework docs, etc., I have only found how to read the Tab Title, surfaced as the \"custom title\" (custom_title) property of the tab. This is the one that all search hits on getting/setting the title via osascript refer to. Even though there are other title properties in the window and tab.current_settings it seems that they all reference only this first title field and there is therefore some redundancy.\nI am setting each title programmatically using terminal escape sequences, as I similarly do not know how to set the Tab Subtitle.\nAlthough it is possible to use UI scripting, I expect that such an approach will have to visibly cycle through all Terminal windows/tabs in order to read them all when producing the overall output that I desire. I would prefer something that can get at the data without causing selection/focus changes.\nMy last option seems a little heavyweight (though may still be preferable to UI scripting) which is to export the settings (Shell > Export Settings...) which produces a large XML file which does include both fields. Surprisingly the data structures in this file match the AppleScript structures almost identically, except that it includes the field I'm otherwise missing.\nBeing quite new to programming on the Apple platform, can anyone enlighten me to how I can get at this data that seems it should exist in the place I am looking but that I am unable to find?\n\nA: Try:\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n    set myTabs to every tab of window 1\n    set myData to {}\n    repeat with aTab in myTabs\n        set aTab's selected to true\n        delay 0.2\n        set windowTitle to name of window 1\n        set customTitle to aTab's custom title\n        set end of myData to \"Window:\" & windowTitle & return & \"Custom Title:\" & customTitle & return & return\n    end repeat\n    display dialog (myData as text)\nend tell\n\n", "Q: Time Capsule beeping on disk access My 2 TB, 3rd generation Time Capsule just started making a beep-like noise today.

Using it as a wifi router does not make it do any noises.\nWhat should it be?\nEdit: after 2 weeks with my Time Capsule beeping on every disk access, suddendly after a restart it just stoped. I restarted it before, but it had no effect, I have no ideia why it worked this last time.\n\nA: I believe some hard drives that are SMART enabled (all drives Apple use are) will beep when they detect the SMART status is failing.

I would suggest copying any data off the drive now before it fails. \n", "Q: What is the cable that connects the logic board to the display in a Macbook Air? My friend asked me to repair her Macbook Air (I swear I'll never touch it again) and while removing the panel surrounding the LCD screen with a razor blade (as shown on iFixit), I inadvertently sliced the display cable near the bottom of the screen.\nWhat is the name for this cable? I can't seem to find a replacement - and I don't really want to bring it in to the Apple Store if I can help it.\nAlso, how easy is it to replace this cable - it's not soldered to the logic board or anything, right? \n\nA: The takeapart guide on iFixit sells replacement parts, but expect them to be pricey. The Air is a very, very delicate machine so be warned that getting it put back together takes more grace than getting it apart.\nWorst case, you could buy an entire display assembly if you feel you are doing more damage than good by proceeding with this repair. Three cables go into the Air's display assemblyL\n\n\n*\n\n*Wi-Fi antenna\n\n*Backlight power\n\n*LVDS cable\n\n\nI presume you nicked the last one - it has the widest connector to the logic board. The real problem is getting inside the Air's display assembly as I haven't seen that documented anywhere publicly available. That cable might be part of the LCD panel and might be something you could try to buy used from a liquid damaged or physically damaged Air. Here's where the question lacks details to know why you were in there to begin.\nWhat part was being replaced that caused you to need a razor blade on this repair? Are you going inside the display assembly in the first place?\nDon't rule out taking it in to the store in a static safe back with your tail between your legs. You will then know if they can fix it by quoting you an out of warranty part cost plus labor to fix things - both what was originally wrong and the things that have now gone not right.\n", "Q: Command + C does not always work from the first try in Microsoft Word (Office 2011) I have no idea why COMMAND + C doesn't always register from the first time. I sometimes try to copy something off Word, but I have to press COMMAND + C more than once for it to register, otherwise COMMAND + C just prints what was copied in clipboard before. This becomes very irritating.\nHowever I realised that if I press COMMAND then pause for a second, THEN press C, the command always registers.\nEDIT\nI noticed that when I select any text in word, it takes about a second for the Cut and Copy buttons to be highlighted (otherwise they're greyed out).

Not sure if this was the appropriate place to ask, but it is Apple related so here we go:\nThis is Apple's 2nd year of doing Black Friday sales, does anyone have any information on what 3rd party accessories were discounted by last year during the sales? I have a few things I'd like to get, but if the discount isn't too great or non-existant it might not be worth fighting the crowds for.\nI'm aware that the iPhones / Macs were discounted for < $100.\n\nA: Go now and buy what you want would be my advice. If it subsequently goes on sale, go and ask for a price adjustment on Friday. (Don't wait till Saturday to ask, though) \nApple's return policy is quite consumer friendly, so you could always not open things if you are on the fence and exchange or even return it until after the New Year due to the extended holiday season return policy.\nEven if I had a list of things on sale - each store has different stock, different models so guessing which items will be in stock at your store will be hit or miss.\nAlso - Apple's announcement states that you can start shopping online at Midnight, so you can make your go/no-go decision well before the stores open on Friday. I would get the Apple Store app installed on your iOS device so you can shop, pay and not wait in line for items that they don't have stashed at the \"rapid sales\" line where many popular items are stocked in large quantities to minimize the delay of getting your item from the stockroom or finding someone free to sell you your new loot.\n", "Q: Is there a way to make pasting into Terminal safe? I paste filenames/etc into Terminal all the time, and occasionally the contents of the clipboard isn't what I expect.\nOften the result is several hundred lines of text (eg, source code) pasted into the command prompt, triggering god only knows what nastiness.\nIs there some way to prevent bash from blindly executing whatever I paste in? I wish it would just paste the text, and let me decide after if I wanna execute it.\n\nA: The simplest solution is probably to use a text editor as a buffer where you can double-check the contents, then copy from the text editor to Terminal. If you use TextEdit for this, you'll probably want to make sure it's in plain text mode (Format menu → Make Plain Text; ⇧⌘T) to avoid issues like links pasting as links, not URLs.\nThe other thing to note is that Bash will attempt to execute everything preceding a newline character, so if you're copying a block of text, you may want to ensure that your selection stops after the last character, rather than including the end of the line.\nYou want this:\n\nNot this:\n\nOf course, if you're copying stuff with newlines within the text (i.e. multiple paragraphs), then you'll need to manually edit the selection.\n\nA: If you are using a recent version of Bash (v4.4; may have to install through homebrew):\n\n*\n\n*Add set enable-bracketed-paste on to your ~/.inputrc (source)\n\n*Enable \"Paste newlines as carriage returns\" in your terminal profile\n\n\nA: Use bracketed paste.\nBracketed paste is a feature where the terminal tells the shell that you pasted something instead of just typing it, so the shell can not run the command until you press Enter.\nTerminal.app supports this, but not all terminals do.\nLikewise, not all shells support it either. The version of bash that comes with OS X does not support bracketed paste (as of the time of writing, it's v3.2.57).\nHowever, zsh does support bracketed paste:\n\nZsh is mostly compatible with bash (even scripts will probably work, unless you use some sort of really obscure feature), and better in many ways—for example, it even has multi-line command editing!\n\n\nA: Assuming you are using bash: If you activate emacs shortcuts with set -o emacs you can also use Emacs to edit the command line:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type Ctrl-XCtrl-E at the prompt to start Emacs\n\n*Paste and edit your clipboard content into the Emacs buffer\n\n*Use Ctrl-XCtrl-C to exit Emacs and automatically run the command(s).\n\n\nA: I get this too!\nMy solution is to paste using Launchbar's clipboard manager, with the hotkey Cmd+\\. This brings up a list of recent clippings, allowing me to preview the result before pasting: if I don't see the content I expect, I hit escape before releasing Cmd.  I can also use an arrow key to 'enter' a text clipping, allowing me to see the content line by line.\nI believe most launchers do this - Alfred (powerpack addon) & Quicksilver (free), for example.\n\nA: You might want to look into a clipboard manager. I use a free, light weight one called Jumpcut. It allows me to keep multiple clipboards and see what's stored in them before actually pasting the contents, all from the keyboard. \nThere are many clipboard managers out there, so if Jumpcut doesn't float your boat, maybe another will better fit your needs \n\nA: Under Preferences -> Profiles -> Basic -> Advanced,\ncheck \"Paste newlines as carriage returns\".  (Basic is the name of one profile.  If you use another profile, you should choose that one instead.)\nIn some shells (zsh and bash work for me, tcsh does not) this will let you edit or abort (via Ctrl-C) what is pasted before any part of it is passed to the shell.\nYou may need to make a new Terminal window for the preference to start working.\nI use this feature all the time, not only for pasting and editing complex commands, but also to view columnated text and sometimes to select and copy sub-rectangles by dragging with the option key.\n\nA: You could put this little Bash script somewhere in your PATH:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nread -p \"Are you sure you wish to execute \\`$(pbpaste)\\`? (Y/n) \"    \n[[ $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]?$  ]] && pbpaste | bash\n\nIf I put these contents in /usr/local/pbexecute for example and make it executable, I could safely execute pbexecute from the command-line, which would prompt my confirmation before executing the contents of the clipboard.\nAn alternative approach is to launch a text editor with the contents of the clipboard from within the shell and automatically execute the edited contents upon exiting. For example:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nPBTEMP=$(mktemp -t pbtemp)\npbpaste > $PBTEMP\nnano -t $PBTEMP\nsource $PBTEMP\nrm $PBTEMP\n\n", "Q: Can an Airport Express be used to extend the Wi-Fi of another-non Apple Access Point? My colleague has a cheap Cisco Access Point on another floor. He is using a Mac Pro and the the Wi-Fi is very spotty.\nCan an Airport Express be used to extend this network?\n\nA: I got mine working, Airport express connected via ethernet to linksys router, both running their own WiFi networks with the same SSID's and passwords, allowing devices to roam between them. Also, the fact that it is in bridge means the linksys gives out the IP addresses, allowing for faster roaming (theoretically, have not done testing in the middle of a transfer)\nSetup was easy, if u wanna do it that way you gotta connect the WAN port to the upstream router (assuming this is a 2012 airport, else theres only one port so use that one)\nThen set it up as a \"new\" network\nYou can also repeat a signal in theoory with out the cable, have not tried that though as it increases lag, halves the speed, and i have an ethernet cable where i want the router. If thats what u wanna do though, you would probably have to put it halfway between you and the other router, because it doesnt seem to be able to pick up a super weak signal (it sees about the same networks as my laptop can in the same location, so it isnt like its super powerful)\n\nA: Apple seems to be saying in a round-a-bout way here that other routers are not supported for wireless range extensions (with a router connected to Ethernet and the Express not):\n\nExtend an existing Wi-Fi network’s range.\nIf you already have a\nwireless network in your home and want to extend its range, AirPort\nExpress can help.

Launch the\neasy-to-use AirPort Utility app on your iOS device or Mac, and you’re\nmere minutes away from long-range Wi-Fi enjoyment.\n\nHowever, this is only if your AirPort Express is not connected to Ethernet.  Otherwise, you can setup a roaming network. The newer Airport Express models (the ones compatible with 802.11n) can do this.\n\nFirst, you need the Express connected to Ethernet.  Make sure that the main non-Apple router is set to share a public IP address.  Next, when setting up the Express, just set up its Network name and Password exactly the same as the network used by your non-Apple router.  The network mode needs to be \"Create a wireless network,\" it should Connect Using \"Ethernet,\" and Connection Sharing needs to be \"Off (Bridge mode).\"\n\nA: You can only hook up an early 2009 Mac Pro by using a e cord attached to the base station,  The base station must be plugged into the modem or the router,  Sad but true,  Oh well,  At least I'm going to saVe a couple hundred bucks!..\n", "Q: Can't find/run `configure` script on mac os 10.8 I'm trying to install a program called CSIM (neural micro circuit simulator) and one of the steps is as follows: \n\nStep 2.

Are there any statistics available about failure rates for MacBook Air by time? For example, what are the chances of failing within 1, 3, 6, 12 months, etc.\n\nA: I'm not aware of any available data on this. I'm sure Apple has detailed information on returns and repairs, but there's no way they would ever release it (and I'd imagine it's guarded fairly heavily even within the company). You might be able to get some numbers from independent Mac repair shops, but without any information on how many Airs are out there and how many are going elsewhere for repair, it wouldn't be all that valuable statistically.\nThe best potential source I can think of is some of the market research companies, like Gartner. I don't know if any of their surveys would be specific enough to get data for failures for individual models (or whether their sample sizes are large enough to make any inferences significant). If they do have such data, it would almost certainly be in their for-pay reports (the free ones typically only include the general sales figures, nothing with the specificity you're looking for).\n", "Q: Are iPhone apps required to work on iOS 5 if it works on iOS 6?

So, a file named '6753687a.eps' for example would need be filed in the '675' folder, which is in the '67' folder, which is in the '6' folder, which is in the 'Images' folder at the root of the volume. There is no '6753' folder. \nIdeally, I'd like to be able to drop groups of files into a folder or a droplet or something, and have the files automatically moved into their correct folders. \nDoes anyone know of a way to do this?\n\nA: Automator Droplet\nYou can do this with an Automator workflow and a script (I'm using Python, but it could be done with Bash, Applescript or anything else really).\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up Automator, and choose Application type.\n\n*Add a Run Shell Script action to the workflow.\n\n*In the Run Shell Script action, set the Shell option to /usr/bin/python, and Pass input: to as arguments.\n\n*Set the script text to the script as shown below.

A more foolproof approach is to use find, e.g.\nsudo -i\n\nfind . -iname \"*.pkg\" -maxdepth 1 -exec installer -verbose -pkg {} -target / \\;\n\nNote:-maxdepth 1 forces find to only search for files in the current folder and avoid traversing the nested subfolders.\n\nA: /usr/sbin/installer\n\nThe installer command is used to install Mac OS X installer packages to a specified domain or volume.  The\ninstaller command installs a single package per invocation, which is specified with the -package parameter ( -pkg\nis accepted as a synonym).  It may be either a single package or a metapackage.  In the case of the metapackage,\nthe packages which are part of the default install will be installed unless disqualified by a package's check\ntool(s).\n\nSee man installer for the full functionality. Often\nsudo installer -pkg /path/to/package.pkg -target /\n\nis all that's needed. The target is a \"device\" (see the man page for details or run installer -dominfo). Here / is the main drive, it also accepts devices like \"/Volumes/Macintosh HD\", or /dev/disk0.\n\nA: Just in case it's needed; if you want to installer a .pkg without root access:\ninstaller -pkg myapp.pkg -target CurrentUserHomeDirectory\n\nwill install the package in ~/Applications.\n", "Q: How to choke network preformance on OS X \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to simulate slow internet connections on the mac \n\nFor testing purposes I would like to choke the performance of the network on my OS X 10.8.2 machine. \nI have currently Little Snitch installed, which I can block access to certain hosts with... however I would like to lower the network performance as if I would be using an 56k6 old-school modem. \nHow can I accomplish this?\n\nA: Although you can use command-line tools to do this, Apple has a developer tool that allows you to do what you are talking about from a control panel. There are presets available, or you can set your own performance limits. The tool is called \"Network Link Conditioner\" and is available on Apple's developer download site with a package called \"Hardware IO Tools for Xcode\".\nHere is a blog post discussing the tool (with screen shots):\nhttp://mattgemmell.com/2011/07/25/network-link-conditioner-in-lion/\n\nA: After some more searching and talking with a friend of mine, I found the Hardware I/O tools for XCode which has the Network Link Conditioner which does this kind of things.\nhttps://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?name=for%20Xcode%20-#\n", "Q: ios restore to previous version/model - without jailbreaking the original?

Is there a way to do this \"innocent\" operation? Thanks a lot\n\nA: Since the iPhone 3G and iPhone 2G run an iOS version that doesn't match what's on the 4S, iTunes would not allow this. You would either have to get an iPhone 4S on loan to restore your current data or just have iTunes retain the backup of the device being sent for repair until you get it back.\n", "Q: Can I change an application's listed category in the Finder? In the Finder, the Applications directory has an option to sort by \"Application Category,\" which splits apps into groups like Productivity, Social Networking, Music, etc.\n\nI have a number of apps listed under \"Other\" which I would like to assign to one of these other less-generic categories. Is it possible to change this? I looked in the Get Info window and don't see anything about the category listed.\n\nA: The answer is posted here:\nhttp://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20111017134102735\n\nTo add or modify a category, you have to open the application bundle\n  ('Show Package Contents', the under the folder Contents open the file\n  'Info.plist'). \nYou then can change the existing category by changing the key called\n  'LSApplicationCategoryType' (or create the category by adding a child\n  named accordingly).\n\nA list of possible categories is listed here:\nhttp://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#releasenotes/General/SubmittingToMacAppStore/_index.html%23//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010572-CH16-SW8\n", "Q: Find process associated with launchd TCP port 5901 is open on my machine and is causing some mischief, and I want to know which process is opening it.  When I run lsof -i -P I see that launchd is the process that opened the port.\nIs there a quick way I can determine which launchd plist file is being used to open that port? I'd rather not have to go through each plist mentioned by launchctl list.\n\nA: First, is this being opened by the system launchd (process ID 1, running as root), or a user launchd (running as a user)? If it's the system launchd, you're looking for a LaunchDaemon; if it's a user launchd, you're looking for a LaunchAgent.\nAssuming it's the system launchd, you can look for the relevant LaunchDaemon like this:\ngrep 5901 {,/System}/Library/LaunchDaemons/*\n\n(note: if port 5901 were listed in /etc/services, you'd also have to look for it by name as well as number. But it isn't, so you don't have to worry about that.)\nIt's also possible that it's a LaunchDaemon that was loaded from some other place; tracking that down would be messy, so start with the easy check first.\n\nA: Port 5901 is used for VNC (Remote Desktop screen sharing on OS X) and by design launchd actually reads all of the configuration files that are loaded on your Mac and then listens on ports rather than starting the program that eventually will receive communications on that port.\nIn this case, since you only see launchd and not a screensharingd or ScreensharingAgent process you might just be able to conclude that launchd is listening as a proxy for another process that isn't running at present (or perhaps yet to run).\nYou can test this by disabling the screen sharing settings in System Preferences or uninstalling any other remote VNC server software you have and then re-examining lsof.\n", "Q: What to do if OS X Facebook notifications are unreliable? with the release of OS X 10.8.2, Facebook notifications have been introduced. But so far, I'm having problems with the reliability of those: they only appear randomly.

I don't mind hacking stuff.\nIf this is not possible, what would be a good stand-alone program that can record by it's own account, not depending on this screen capturing script.\nThanks for your help!\n\nA: I downloaded a trial version of ScreenFlow, and it looks like there are a few ways to improve the video quality.\nYouTube Export\nIf you're using the YouTube publishing option, be sure to check the Publish in 720p/1080p option:\n\nIf you don't have that selected, the video will be downscaled by YouTube to 360p. You may also want to check the Letterbox option to maintain the aspect ratio on YouTube.\nCustom Export\nYou can gain more control over the export options by using the Export option, in the File menu (or ⌘E). There are various presets, I would suggest trying the Web - High option first, and see if that's to your taste. You'll also want to be sure to change the Dimensions settings, which by default are set to scale to 50%.\nIf you're wanting to put stuff on YouTube, I suggest exporting at your default resolution (i.e. 100% scaling) — YouTube will re-encode it anyway, but uploading the best source material is the best way to maintain quality. If you find the quality of the Web - High isn't sufficient, you can click the Customize… button, and increase the Datarate setting.\nLossless Export w/ 3rd Party Tools\nFinally, if you're still not satisfied, you could ScreenFlow's lossless recording, and use an external tool to compress it. To enable lossless recording, open Preferences, click Advanced and change the Screen Recording Compression from Adaptive to Lossless. Then when you export, use the Lossless preset (or Lossless - ProRes, although this format is not supported by as many tools). Then use another tool, such as Handbrake to tweak the settings as you desire.\nHopefully you can find something amongst these options that will get you the output you desire.\n", "Q: Command-W not working correctly on Safari ⌘W always worked in my Safari like this: \n\n\n*\n\n*it closes all tabs\n\n*if there's no tab, it closes the window.\n\n\nNow, #2 is not working anymore.\nAny clues?\n\nA: Go to your System Preferences… application, and select the Keyboard pane.\nHit the Keyboard Shortcuts tab on top, and Application Shortcuts on the left.

I'm not sure if solid state drives need defragmentation. Can anyone tell me if this requirement goes away with the new technology?\n\nA: No, never. Defragmentation is helpful on spinning platter-based drives, if the filesystem doesn't handle it (which HFS+ generally does, on a Mac), because it takes time for the disk to spin around to the right spot, which has to happen more often if one chunk of data is split between several locations. See Access Time.\nA solid state drive has no moving parts, so there's no mechanical delay. Reading a section of data takes approximately the same amount of time no matter where it's located in the flash.\nDefragmenting a solid state drive is actually harmful because it forces the drive to move data around for no good reason, and flash chips have a limit on how many times they can rewrite a section.\n", "Q: Using PdfLatex in OS X?

Basically, it explains that some Java to EXE packagers/compilers make them difficult to extract for various reasons.\nNote that extracting the .jar files may or may not be legal, depending on the license included with the application.  \nJAR files are Java ARchives that contain a Java program's resources and class files, and EXE files are compiled executables. Already-compiled EXE files cannot be extracted of their original .jar files, but if they were only wrapped, you should check out JSmooth.\nIf you merely want to run the EXE file on your Air, WineBottler is an excellent Wine wrapper that allows you to run Windows EXE files, or you can install Windows on a virtual machine or using Boot Camp.\n", "Q: Clear Output Screen from C program I am using a Macbook Air. I used system(\"cls\"); and system(\"clear\").\nThat would not work. It displays on the output screen (xcode output screen) that the command cannot be found. I am using the C compiler, not C++. \nHow do I clear the output screen on Xcode? Please guide me through the steps in doing this.\n\nA: I'm not sure I entirely follow you, however; if you are using X-Code to compile and run C programs, output (e.g. any printf statements) should automatically be sent to the console, like so:\nint main(int argc, const char * argv[])\n{\n   printf(\"Test program\\n\");\n   getchar();\n   return 0;\n}\n\nIs this the 'screen' you want to clear? If so, simply building and running any program which has no console output will do so (although I'd be interested to know why you need this.)\nIn the example above, comment out the line with the printf statement and build and run. You'll get a clear console.\n\nA: It seems as though it is not possible to clear the output screen with any function on Xcode. I installed Visual Studio 6 on my Windows XP and the system(\"cls\"); function works. Thank you everyone for helping me with this issue.\n\nA: You can also try something that is not so system specific. Try using ANSI escape codes to clear your screen:\nYou can also try something like this, which clears the entire screen:\nprintf(\"\\033[2J\\033[1;1H\");\n\nYou can include \\0333[1;1H to be sure if \\0333[2J does not move the cursor in the upper left corner.\nMore specifically:\n\n\n*\n\n*033 is the octal of ESC\n\n*2J is for clearing the entire console/terminal screen (and moves cursor to upper left on DOS ANSI.SYS)\n\n*1;1H moves the cursor to row 1 and column 1\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to force Finder to attempt to move something from a read-only folder? Usually, if you hold down command while dragging a file (or folder), the Finder will move it rather than copying. This works if you want to quickly move something between volumes (the default is to copy.) However, if you're dragging from a folder you can't write to, command has no effect.\nIs there a way to make the Finder always try to move something if you hold down command, or an equally fast way use the Finder to move an item out of a read-only folder?\n\nA: No, this is an implicit feature of the permissions system. Moving a file out of a folder is effectively deleting it from that folder, which is a write operation, by the permission system's logic, hence it's forbidden if you don't have write permissions.\nRead-only access is typically used in situations where users need to access files, but shouldn't be allowed to modify or delete any. Being allowed to move files (potentially to locations where other users couldn't access them) would break that paradigm.\nIf you want to move that file, you could do so from the Terminal, using sudo mv file destination (sudo means perform the command as the super-user, i.e. a user that has write permissions), or you can change the folder's permissions from the Get Info window (in the right-click menu, file menu, or press ⌘I).\n", "Q: Message notification does not work in iPhone 4S My iPhone 4S always showed a notification in banner (that is, the top of the iPhone screen) when a new message/mail came to me.

For some reason, though, today it isn't working at all. I have a TB-to-HDMI cable which is hooked up to an HDMI-to-DVI adapter. I have just tried it on an HDMI tv and have gotten nothing except a \"Not supported mode\" and a mouse flicker. By the way, it's not just the tv and monitors not working. In the System Preferences it doesn't show any other displays or an option to extend or mirror like usual. I will be getting another cable tomorrow to see if that is the problem.\nAn important question that I have and what I am most concerned about is that I have gfxCardStatus installed and when I tried using my external display today I forgot to turn it off of \"Integrated only\". Do you think that could have broken something since external displays require the other GPU? Sometimes when I plug in the cord gfxCardStatus shows it going into the AMD GPU but then if I look under dependencies it says \"None\" (it usually said \"Extended Display\").\nOn very very rare occasions when I unplug the cord I will get a blue screen flash like it is changing display settings.\nSome things I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wiggling cord\n\n*Messing around with gfxCardStatus (even turning it off)\n\n*Changing settings in Energy Saver PrefPane\n\n*Clicked on \"Detect Displays\" many times\n\n*Resetting PRAM\n\n*Resetting SMC\n\n\nAnother thing is that I just recently got my logic board replaced so I wouldn't think that would be the case but unfortunately their 30-day repair warranty is up.\nOne more thing that I have found while scouring the internet is I came across a picture of someones System Report for Graphics and at the bottom of the read-out it says: Display Connector: Status: No Display Connected but mine doesn't say that (I don't know if it used to either).\n\nWhat are some of your thoughts? I am really hoping it is just the cord.\nEDIT: Just tried my Xbox into my HDMI-DVI adapter with the monitor and it worked so that rules that out. It has to either be my cord or my computer\n\nA: You need to switch to discrete graphics in gfxCardStatus (or dynamic switching) for external display support. Also make sure you're running the latest version by running “Check for Updates…”. (Your cable is likely just fine.)\n\nA: It was a faulty cable. Just got a new one and it works beautifully. The reason why I posted here was basically just to see if the gfxCardStatus had anything to do with it. But thank you all for your help\nPeace\n\nA: This problem usually has to do with the fact that people don't realize that your Macbook has to be plugged into the power supply.

I don't know the solution but the problem seems to occur only when I plug in an external mouse. Unfortunately it adjutsts finder's appearance wether it's connected or not to the mouse and only lets you change column sizes in finder if you use the rtackpad only. (MBP)\n\nA: This happens when that separator needs to accomodate space for a scroll bar due to content length. You can resize them with the handles at the bottom end since 10.0.\n\n\nA: I can confirm that Lauri Ranta's solution above fixed this issue for me.\nSystem Preferences -> General Preferences -> Show scroll bars: \"When scrolling\"\nLike Andrew mentioned, this problem seems to come and go.  On my machine, I wonder if the setting \"automatically based on mouse or trackpad\" is getting confused as I switch between a Razer mouse and the Apple trackpad.  Might be worth a look if you have a similar setup to mine.\n\nA: I had the same problem, and Andrew was right, but I was using Apple Magic Mouse. So, I tried to switch off the bluetooth that my mouse was connected to, then using the trackpad, I could resize the column in Finder. I turned back on the bluetooth and the problem of resizing the columns has gone. I have to make a remark that my magic mouse was also low on battery.

At our institute, we have several Macs (from 10.6 to 10.8) but not one is running a server version. In the one running 10.8 there are 4.5 TB of hard-drives from which 2 x 2 TB are raided together (mirrored) with to goal to use them as a Time Machine backup for all other Macs. All the Macs are connected over the institute network.\nNow, how do I set up everything such that all Macs can use Time Machine to backup to this one Mac?\nI've read that this might be easier when the target Mac would run OS X Server.\nHow is it also possible without installing OS X server?\n\nA: I was successful at setting up an Ubuntu 12.04 computer running netatalk (AFP) as a file server and backing up two Macs on 10.8 and restoring one after a crash.\n\nA: OS X Server is probably the best way to go. It is stable and easy to install over the Mac OS you have on destination mac. \nThere are inexpensive books less than $50 walking you through the entire server setup process, and the software itself is $20 in the US store.\nIt takes someone familiar with server an hour to set up a Mac to serve just Time Machine functionality, so the investment should be manageable for someone that wanted to save paying for help and learning to DIY and not being pressed for time so they can ask and search the net if issues crop up during setup.\n\nA: Agree with previous statements regarding OS X Server. \nI wanted to backup my MBA and MBP using a networked drive. I have a MacMini that I use as a media center. I installed OS X Server on the MacMini and using a regular 1 TB USB drive as the TimeCapsule disk.\nWorks like a charm and I have no problems backing up both MacBooks.\n\nA: The officially sanctioned answer: buy an Apple Time Capsule device.\nUnsupported but well-known alternative: enable a hidden option that allows you to use any network drive. Open the Terminal application and run this one command:\ndefaults write com.apple.systempreferences TMShowUnsupportedNetworkVolumes 1\nIt will allow you to select any network drive from System Preferences: Time Machine. \nThe network drive should be a HFS+ file system over AFP (standard file sharing from another Mac). I would strongly discourage you from using any other setup if you are not prepared to manually restore one file at a time from the backup.\n\nA: Some full and detailed instructions are available here, but it's pretty much just a matter of sharing the folder you want with AFP only, mounting it on the client for the first time, and selecting it in Time Machine.\nIf that doesn't work for you, or you need more configuration options, install OS X Server. It's an officially supported feature, and Server only costs $20 from the Mac App Store. Unlike older versions, Server for 10.8 is just an MAS install and doesn't require reinstalling the OS.\nSide note: do not ever use the TMShowUnsupportedNetworkVolumes option if you value the integrity of your backups. Unsupported volumes are unsupported for a reason: Time Machine requires certain specific file-sharing features to ensure that the backups aren't corrupted if, for example, the network connection drops in the middle of a backup. Enabling this option disables checking for those features and I have seen it result in corrupted backups quite a few times.\n", "Q: Replaced Macbook Pro keyboard with US-layout, now cannot type ~/` on external keyboard I'm owning a MBP 15\" early 08, which I bought (and use) in Germany.\nRecently, I decided to switch to US International layout, bought new keyboards (an internal one and and external Logitech diNovo Mac), both having US 104 keys layout.\nThe internal keyboard is working fine, I'm able write the ` and ~ characters.\nOn my external keyboard, these keys post ±/§ (so the UK equivalent). Also, the on-screen-keyboard shows a 105-keys-layout, but it is correctly set to (104 keys) US extended:\n\nSeems I need to convince my Mac I've got 104 character keyboards, but I cannot find any preferences.\nAlso, when entering my file vault password in firmware mode, I've still got a German keyboard layout which I'm not able to change.\n\nA: One possibility is to use keyremap4macbook, but this doesn't change the firmware keyboard layout and I don't like fiddling around with such tools if not necessary.\n\n\nA: The problem solved itself when I upgraded to Mavericks and changed my user password. Sadly I didn't check if it's working in-between, only realized I do not need keyremap4macbook any more.\nIt might be possible resetting the PRAM resolves the problem.\n", "Q: iOS Mail attachment download behaviour when connected to Microsoft Exchange? When is an eMail attachement automatically downloaded in iOS? From my expierience iOS downloads an attachment up to the size of about 50 kB automatically when on a 3G network, on a WLAN larger files are downloaded automatically (up to around 150 kB).\nHowever I cannot find this documented by Apple and I have users complaining with high roaming bills that tell me big attachments get downloaded automatically.\nOur users are connected to Microsoft Exchange 2010 by ActiveSync.\nThe problem is difficult to reproduce and I'm looking for ways to nail or solve this?\n\nA: i did some testing with a colleague, and here's what we've found:\nif you open an email while connected to wifi, an individual attachment of up to 1027kb will auto-download, and be available for offline use.\nif you see an email has been received, but do not open it, an individual attachment of up to 799kb will auto-download, and be available for offline use.\nwe still have not found the lower limit for emails with multiple attachments, though we do know it's lower than 613kb (we tried an email with two attachments: 365kb + 248kb and NEITHER auto-downloaded).\nJPEGs (and possibly other image formats) have a higher auto-download size limit than other attachments, but we were not concerned with them, so we didn't test for their upper limit.\n", "Q: MacBook Mac OS X Install DVD not loading on new hard drive I have a MacBook Pro 13 late 2008 for which I just replaced the HD with a WD Blue notebook 500GB, 5400rpm, model WDBABC5000ANC-NRSN.  After replacing the HD, powered up the MBP, the screen displayed a flashing folder with ?.  I think this is normal since there is no OS loaded.\nI inserted the Mac OS X Install DVD OS X 10.5.5 which came with MBP and restarted holding down C until a grey screen with Apple logo and spinning wheel at bottom appeared.  It stayed like this for 2 1/2 hours so I shut down.\nAny suggestions would be appreciated.  Please be detailed as I am a novice user.\n\nA: It seems like the install DVD is unreadable for some reason, either the disk is bad (DVDs are less durable than you might think), or the drive is bad (have you attempted to read any other disks lately?).\nIn any event, the easiest way to get around it is to boot off your old hard drive, and clone it to your new one. You'll need a USB external closure that can take a 2.5\" SATA drive (they can typically be had for around $20 or $30). Put your old drive in that, plug it in, and hold down option as you boot. You'll get a selector screen, and  your old drive should be available to boot off of (it will likely be labelled Macintosh HD and have the orange external drive icon). Select that, and your Mac will boot just as it did previously. From here, there are a couple ways to get your new drive working.\nClone Your Old Drive\nUnless you really want a fresh install for some reason, this is my recommended method. It will copy your entire system over to your new drive, so you'll get larger capacity, but without the hassle of re-installing everything.\nTo clone your drive, open up Disk Utility (found in Applications/Utilities, or just use Spotlight). In the right hand pane, you should see your old boot drive, and your new drive. Select your old drive, click the Restore tab, set Source to your old drive, and Destination to your new drive. Then click Restore. This will likely take a few hours, but once you're done, you should be able to restart and boot into your new internal drive.\nFresh Install from USB\nIf you want to do a fresh install, you can try reading the installation disk to a USB drive, which may be more reliable. You'll need a sufficiently large USB hard drive or memory stick (for 10.5, you may need 8 GB, but it's possible 4 GB will do).\nTo start, insert the installation DVD and check that you can read it. If you can, then you're good to go, otherwise you'll need to get another copy elsewhere, or a newer version of OS X (or you can try the clone method).\nThe procedure to copy the installation disk is the same as cloning the hard drives, you just switch the Source to the installation disk, and Destination to your USB drive. Once the copy is complete, reboot and hold option, and select your USB installation disk from the boot menu. You should then see the standard OS X installer and you can proceed as normal.\n\nA: Try pressing Alt immediately after you hear the startup tone. A menu with bootable disks and cd-roms should appear. Insert your copy of Mac Os X into the superdrive. It can take a short moment for a cd/dvd until it is recognized - so give it a few seconds.\n", "Q: iTunes archive on non permanent external drive? Is it possible or recommended to have the iTunes library on a non-permanent external drive? What will happen if I e.g. sync my iPhone while the drive is not attached? Or what will happen when iTunes thinks it should download the music I have bought on my iPad while the drive is not connected?\n\nA: It is possible. In fact, I manage my family's iPod this way.\n\n\n*\n\n*The howto is answered in How to move iTunes’ Mobile Applications folder to an external hard drive. Shut down iTunes, move your library, then start iTunes back up while holding down Option. Tell it you will choose a library, then show it your library on your drive. For more advanced library management, see Can I keep my iTunes library on an external drive?.\n\n*As for your concerns, always shut down iTunes before removing your drive. I don't know what will happen if you unplug it without killing iTunes.\n\n*If you try to bring up iTunes without your drive plugged in, you will see these two dialogs, one after the other: \n\n\nIn the first one, simply click OK to get the second one, then quit, plug in your drive, and try again. If iTunes can't find your library, it will not try to sync your iPhone or download purchased music.\n", "Q: Where can I find statistics on download amount on OSX?

Should I get an additional application?\n\nA: Activity Monitor will show your network usage for the current session, but this gets reset when you reboot. However, if you're just looking for a rough estimate of how much data you use before you get your mobile service, this may suffice. After you get your service, you will probably find that your carrier has a way of checking via a website.\nRegarding bmike's answer, I believe he's talking about iOS.\n\nA: OSXDaily had an article on this very topic.

System Report will display the system's Hardware UUID in the format 01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef.\nUsing the shell we can retrieve the same UUID:\n\nioreg -rd1 -c IOPlatformExpertDevice | grep -E '(UUID)'\n\nIs it possible to get this UUID in Python without resorting to executing a shell command?\n\nA: Short answer: not really.\nLong answer: sort of, but it's probably more trouble than it's worth, unless you really can't used the shell command for some reason. OS X doesn't really expose much system configuration to Python. Most scriptable interfaces to configure OS X are shell-based or AppleScript-based (and of course the various Objective-C APIs).\nGetting the UUID is possible in AppleScript:\ntell application \"System Information\"\n    set profile to system profile\n    quit\nend tell\n\nset delim to AppleScript's text item delimiters\nset AppleScript's text item delimiters to \"Hardware UUID: \"\nset uuid to paragraph 1 of text item 2 of profile\nset AppleScript's text item delimiters to delim\nuuid\n\nBut as you can see, it's a bit convoluted (and is much slower than the ioreg method, as it has to process the entire system profile).\nThere is a way to bridge AppleScript to Python, known as Appscript, but it's no longer developed, and not recommended for new projects. However, if you're really determined, you could convert the above AppleScript into Python using Appscript. But to be honest, it seems like a lot of trouble to get a worse result.\n\nA: I'm able to do it, but I use pyobjc as seen here:\nhttps://gist.github.com/pudquick/c7dd1262bd81a32663f0\nimport objc\nfrom Foundation import NSBundle\n\nIOKit_bundle = NSBundle.bundleWithIdentifier_('com.apple.framework.IOKit')\n\nfunctions = [(\"IOServiceGetMatchingService\", b\"II@\"),\n             (\"IOServiceMatching\", b\"@*\"),\n             (\"IORegistryEntryCreateCFProperty\", b\"@I@@I\"),\n            ]\n\nobjc.loadBundleFunctions(IOKit_bundle, globals(), functions)\n\ndef io_key(keyname):\n    return IORegistryEntryCreateCFProperty(IOServiceGetMatchingService(0, IOServiceMatching(\"IOPlatformExpertDevice\".encode(\"utf-8\"))), keyname, None, 0)\n\ndef get_hardware_uuid():\n    return io_key(\"IOPlatformUUID\".encode(\"utf-8\"))\n\nIf your target for usage is the macOS system python, fortunately Apple already included pyobjc with every recent macOS release.\n", "Q: Adding contact on iPhone adds it to Exchange but not iCloud On my iPhone running iOS6, I have the following accounts configured:\n\n\n*\n\n*iCloud - Contacts, Reminders, Safari, Passbook, and Find my iPhone\n\n*Exchange (my work email) - Mail, Contacts, Calendars, and Reminders\n\n*Gmail - Mail and Calendars\n\n\nI would like to keep my personal contacts (in iCloud) completely separate from my work contacts (in Exchange). \nWhen I add a contact directly on my iPhone, it immediately shows up in Outlook but does not exist in my iCloud contacts (verify by looking in iCloud.com or Contacts app on my Mac). \nI would like it so when I add a contact on my iPhone it gets added to my iCloud contacts, not my Exchange contacts.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: Yes, it is possible.\nSet the default account for Contacts to iCloud.

It does not seem possible. It would seem Apple found including a user-interface where you can select the default address book to be too cumbersome for the user. In Enterprise deployments it would be preferred to sync to the ActiveSync Exchange server and not Apple's servers. I would assume they made this the default behavior to meet this use-case.\nYou can, however, disable the contacts data being synced from (and thus to) the Exchange server without loosing it's other features. Open Settings: Email, contacts, calendars: The Exchange Account and uncheck Contacts from there. \n", "Q: How to use the balance on your apple account in app store? Recently I won a $10.00 gift card which I redeemed on Apple iTunes. So now when I open iTunes, to the left of my apple id, I see a $10.00 balance. My problem is that if I try to purchase an app, it asks me to enter my credit card information. \nOn the form where I am supposed to fill my credit card information, there's a link which says to redeem your gift card click here. Unfortunately, if I try to enter the code of the gift (mentioned at the beginning of this post) it says that the gift card has been already redeemed.\nI guess that means that the amount of the gift card has already been credited to my account (as it shows to the left of my apple id on the iTunes program). The question is: how do I spend this balance?\n\nA: Just buy the app or the song or whatever and it will take from your balance first. I would check your settings to verify this, however.\n\nA: One way to check your App Store account balance is to open iTunes, select the link to 'iTunes Store' on the pane on the left under 'Store'.\nClick your email address in the top right (or click 'sign in' if required), login in and the value account balance, should be shown next to your email address.\nFurther details are available including a purchase history in the drop down, you should see the credit on the ''Account information' page under 'Apple ID balance'.\nOnce the balance is in place, you may still see a credit card prompt.  Some advice on the Apple support site suggests that you may need to complete a \"purchase\" of free app, and select \"none\" for payment type.\nTo try this - pick an app which is free, click to purchase. You should be prompted for payment details and an extra option should be available to select payment type: 'none'.\nIf you have balance from the redeemed gift card in place, then I think further app purchases may be possible without being prompted for card details. \n", "Q: In OS X Lion 10.7.5 can I turn faces off in iPhoto?

My iPhoto is full of \"faces\" of people it has picked up from the backgrounds of my photos, making it so slow and having to delete so many photos afterwards that I stopped using it.\nIf not, can you suggest any other similar software I can use to index and sort my photos?\n\nA: No. There is no way to turn off Faces in iPhoto. The best way is to use Aperture. I use Aperture, but a common alternative is Adobe Lightroom.\n\nA: Afraid not, but you should not see these face thumbnails. Are they actually in the iPhoto Window ? An alternative, that will also allow an upgrade path is to use Aperture which has the option to turn off face scanning.\n", "Q: iphone shares my email address without permission I've found that with my iPhone 5 the following happens.

Requirement\nJava 6 for Android development on Mountain Lion. \nQuestion\nIs it possible? What can I do?\nI've looked everywhere for a way to do this and am unable to find any solution. \nBackground\nI recently installed Oracle's Java 7 for OS X on my Mac running Mountain Lion (10.8.2). I was happy with this until I started doing Android development, which throws errors relating to Java 7. \nI downloaded Apple's Java for OS X Lion Update 1, but when I try to install it I get only this message before Installer closes:\n\nA newer version of this package is already installed.\n\nI followed Oracle's instructions (Mac FAQ), but they seem to not work for me. Afterwards if I do java -version it still says Java 7. \nI even tried restarting my computer, to no avail.\n\nBefore I tried to reinstall Java 6, Apple's Java Preferences utility (described by Oracle) was present, but after trying all these things I am also without Java Preferences.\n\nA: From my understanding the actual components that need to be removed first are in /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/*.jdk\nSo if you get rid of those:\n$ sudo rm -rf /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/*\n\nAlso, as you mentioned, you're supposed to remove this:\n$ sudo rm -rf /Library/Internet\\ Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin\n\nAt this point it should simply be a matter of downloading 1.6 and installing it.  If you do $ whereis java you will see that the java binaries are stored in /usr/bin/{java,javac,etc}.  But $ java -version apparently gets its information from the first folder I mentioned you should delete.\nAfter you remove those, try running $ java -version again.  You should be prompted to install it.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: \nwhen I do a java -version it still says Java 7.\n\nRelated, with an explanation: Why does the version of Java verified by Oracle differ from the version shown at the command line?\n\nI tried downloading this Java for OS X update … when I try to install it I just get this message:\n\nA newer version of this package is already installed.\n\n\nFor the outdated installer (2011-11-08), that's the proper response. \nCurrent: Java for OS X 2012-006, which normally uninstalls the Apple-provided Java applet plug-in from all web browsers. \nIf you then allow or force installation of an outdated plug-in, please take care with all applications that will use the plug-in.

Without having to go into settings and change manually it ?\niPhone 5 iOS 6.0.1\n\nA: Using the settings already baked into iOS 6 you have three options of ringtone alerts. It is possible you could get more customization if you jailbroke it.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have the silence switch (on the side of the phone) off, then there will be a normal ringtone and vibration. \n\n*If you have the silence switch on (with the red showing), then there will be no ringtone, and only vibration.\n\n*If you enable Do Not Disturb, then there is no ringtone, and no vibration (see below).\n\n\nYou can enable Do Not Disturb by opening Settings, and switching on Do Not Disturb. You can customize it by going to Settings > Notifications > Do Not Disturb. By default, calls from your Favorites will not be silenced. This will need to be changed to \"No One,\" in order for there to be no calls. Also you will need to switch off Repeated Calls.\nNote that you can schedule Do Not Disturb also.\nThe only thing that isn't possible with iOS 6 (non-jailbroken) is substituting a different ringtone when it is on silent. The silence switch turns it off altogether.\n\nAlso keep in mind that this will not affect alarms. Alarms are quite stubborn and will go off pretty much no matter what.\n", "Q: Where to store large photo library that also can be backed up? I have an old PC that used to house my entire (several hundred gigabytes) photo library internally and backed it up nightly to an external hard drive.\nI have a MBP that travels between home and work (250 GB HD), and recently bought a MacBook Air (120GB) for home.  Neither of these has enough storage to be \"home\" for my photo library.\nMy requirements for the setup are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Must be large enough\n\n*Must be backed up somehow\n\n*Must be fast enough (> 100 Mb/s so USB 2.0+, Wireless-N or wired gigabit) when accessing it from one of the laptops.\n\n\nI have considered a few different options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Keep the current setup (yuck, computer is slow and loud).\n\n*Network attached storage (few highly-rated options on sub-$500 systems)\n\n*Airport Extreme with attached external HDD (would need a backup solution, I haven't thought of one)\n\n*Time Capsule.\nThis seems like my best option, but here are my questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*I don't use Time Machine, so is it a waste?\n\n*Backup: how? I could now have two large, separate drives for backup, but I don't know if this is messy.\n\n*Am I overpaying compared to other similar solutions?\n\n\n\n\nThat's it.  I've been at a loss for what is my best option, so I could really use some help for a Mac-friendly solution!\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*I should add that I am looking to replace my current router, as well, so the Time Capsule option would save me that cost.\n\n*I am not in love with the idea of cloud backup, which is why I haven't mentioned it; unless someone can convince me otherwise.\n\n\nA: A few thoughts come to mind.\nFirstly, this is all dependent on what sort of software solution you're using to store your photos. If it's just files in folders, that makes things simpler, and is pretty platform agnostic. But if you're using (or want to use) some sort of organization software, then that obviously complicates things, both in terms of platforms and performance. That said, here's what I think are the best options.\nPC as Network Storage\nThis is what I do (for videos and bulk archival, not photos, but the concept is the same). I have a generic PC with a bunch of hard drives running headless off in an unused room, connected to my network. It runs Linux, and while I have it set up to do various automated tasks, it's main purpose is to be a big network drive I can dump stuff on.\nIt sounds like this is more or less what you have already. If your current hardware isn't adequate, then look into upgrading. For file serving duty, most old hardware should do just fine (mine is a dual core Celeron circa 2008), the biggest bottleneck is network speed, make sure you have Gigabit and the file server software is behaving (I've found that file sharing between Linux and OS X is much faster over AFP than SMB).\nGetting it quiet can take a bit more effort/expense, but it's definitely doable, particularly when you don't need a lot of horsepower (basically, get the biggest heatsink you can, and use a small number of very large fans spinning very slowly).\nThis option is definitely the best value for your money, but likely means more time invested on your part.\nMac Mini\nUsing a Mac Mini in basically the same role as above has some merit as well. It's a bit more expensive, and less expandable, but requires less time investment for set up and maintenance. And of course it's a much more compact form factor than your typical PC, and pretty quiet unless you're doing something very CPU/GPU intensive. You can get up to 2 TB internal storage in one (doing so from Apple requires the more expensive \"server\" model, but you can save a bunch of money by getting the base model and installing the drives yourself - it's fairly straightforward).\nIn addition to simply acting as network file storage, you can use iPhoto to organize all your photos, and share them over the network to your other Macs. If you add OS X Server ($20 from the App Store), you can have your Mini act as a Time Machine back-up server for your other Macs (I haven't tested this, but I've heard it's much more reliable and has better performance than using a Time Capsule).\nOther Options\nNAS Appliance\nAs you've seen there are a wide variety of these. The cheap ones don't have very good performance (few even come close to saturating gigabit ethernet) and lack expandability, and the quality ones ramp up the cost to the point where using a PC or Mac Mini seems to make more sense in most situations. The main selling point seems to be their relative set and forget nature.\nTime Capsule\nI've never heard very good things about this. As a network storage appliance, it's lacking in performance and expandability. It's major selling point is integration with Time Machine, but its reputation seems to be spotty at best as a back up device. Unless having one device as your Wi-Fi router and network storage really appeals to you, I'd recommend against it. Likewise an Airport with attached hard drive — if you already have one, then it might be worth trying out to see if it meets your needs, but I wouldn't go out and buy one just for this.\nBackups\nFor backups, keep things as simple as possible. External drives are pretty cheap, buy one and plug it in to whatever stores your photos. Set up some sort of backup script or program to perform regular backups (rsync should suffice if you're just backing up your photo storage — some sort of cloning software might be better if you want the whole system backed up). For added protection, do backups to second drive every week or two and keep it at your office or somewhere else. Alternatively, look into online backups such as Backblaze, CrashPlan or Arq, which is less labour intensive, but can be more costly and/or problematic depending on your internet speeds and cap.\n\nA: You don't need Server to do Time Machine backups to the Mac Mini. Just create and share a partition for each Mac.\nTM is far from perfect but all backup apps and processes have issues. I use both TM and Crashplan for my OS X backups along with images copies for quick recoveries. CP can work with Windows, OS X, and Linux targets.\n", "Q: Birthdays a day early in Calendar on Mountain Lion On my Macbook Pro running Mac OS X 10.8.2 (Mountain Lion) all the birthdays from the \"Birthdays\" calendar are showing a day early in Calendar. E.g. When I browse to contact Joe Bloggs in Contacts it shows his birthday as 12/03/1987. When I go into Calendar, there is a full day event for Joe Bloggs' birthday on 11/03/1987.\nIn Calendar I have selected the correct timezone (New Zealand Time) and have also enabled \"Turn on time zone support\" in the preferences. On my iPhone, I have the same settings and the birthdays display on the correct date.\nIs there anything I can do to get the birthdays to display on the correct date in Calendar on my Macbook Pro?\nEdit: Just clarifying, the date format used here is dd/mm/yyyy.\n\nA: I was having a similar issue for a while using the native Birthday calendar. It's not exactly the same as only the notifications came in one day early. \nTo fix this, in macOS El Capitan with Calendar v8.0 (2092.3), I found the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Calendar app on macOS\n\n*Select Preferences > Alerts\n\n*Here change the notification for Birthdays to your choice (in my case \"On day of event\")\n\n\nI looked for this option a while ago but was unable to find it earlier. But now with this, I'm neatly notified on the day of a birthday. Perhaps it helps others as well.\n\n\nA: I also have this problem ( also in NZ) but it seems to only be birthdays in November and December and January which are wrong.  Weird.\nPerhaps if anyone with NZ localization sees this on the three month window (11/12/1) it's actually a bug in the code and not something we are doing incorrectly with our data when entering it.\n\nA: It's not just Nov/Dec/Jan. I'm in NZ too and my friend's birthday in Feb is also wrong. Not impressed (nor are my friends!)\n", "Q: Automator Start Capture action doesn't detect stop in Quicktime in OS X 10.8.2 I am attempting to create an Automator application that will launch Quicktime, create a new audio capture, start that capture, and then save it with a specific filename after the stop button is clicked in the capture window. Although I was able to do this in Lion without any difficulty, I keep running into problems with the Start Capture action in Mountain Lion. Even though the \"Wait for capture to complete\" checkbox is checked, the action doesn't seem to detect when the stop button is clicked in Quicktime. Any solutions, tricks, or workarounds that would get this working properly would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: There's a lot that doesn't work with respect to automating QuickTime under Mountain Lion. This is ugly, but it appears to be a workaround that has the key virtue of actually working.\nIn your automator flow, use the action \"Run AppleScript\". Use this as the script:\ntell application \"QuickTime Player\"\n    activate\n    set x to new audio recording\n    tell x to start\n    delay 1\n    set lastLength to duration of x\n    delay 1\n    set newLength to duration of x\n    try\n        repeat while lastLength is not equal to newLength\n            delay 1\n            set lastLength to newLength\n            set newLength to duration of x\n        end repeat\n    end try\n    --  display alert name of document 1\n    set v to file of front document\n    set thePath to POSIX path of (path to desktop)\n    tell x to activate\n    delay 1\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        keystroke \"S\" using {command down, shift down}\n        delay 1\n        keystroke thePath\n        delay 1\n        keystroke return\n        delay 1\n        keystroke \"specific file name\"\n        keystroke return\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nThis isn't pretty, but it's a workaround.\nJust about all the code-based ways to script the save command in QuickTime via AppleScript appear to be broken in Mountain Lion. I can't access the path of the frontmost document. I can't export. I can't close saving. It all fails either silently or with an error message. What does seem to work is to send the appropriate keystrokes to simulate a manual file export. So that's what I've done here.\nI suspect you want your file saved with a name different than \"specific file name\" and perhaps somewhere other than your desktop. Make the appropriate substitutions in the script so that can happen. The file will then be there on disk; subsequent actions in your workflow can take advantage of it.\nNote that if your file already exists, you'll get a confirmation dialog in the QT save command, and the script doesn't handle that automatically.\n\nA: Rather than using the built-in start capture actions, use an AppleScript action as the trigger to start the recording (and wait for it to stop), then pass the resulting file to Automator to do whatever else you need with it.\nI modified Daniel Lawson's script slightly:\ntell application \"QuickTime Player\"\n    activate\n    new audio recording\n    tell front document to start\n    delay 1\n    set lastLength to duration of front document\n    delay 1\n    set newLength to duration of front document\n    try\n        repeat while lastLength is not equal to newLength\n            delay 1\n            set lastLength to newLength\n            set newLength to duration of x\n        end repeat\n    end try\n    set theFile to file of front document\n    return POSIX path of theFile\nend tell\n\nI removed the export lines1, and changed the references from a variable to simply the front document (which avoids some errors if the recording is short, which I ran into during my testing). Finally, I added a return statement with the POSIX path of the resulting file, which Automator can take as input for subsequent actions.\nPut that in an AppleScript action, and the resulting file will be properly passed to any other actions you have (such as moving/renaming it, or re-encoding).\nNotes\n1 QuickTime Player's save and export AppleScript functions are broken to the point of being useless. My theory is that this happened when 10.7 introduced autosaving, as all recordings are automatically saved to your ~/Movies directory, and the quality settings need to be adjusted manually beforehand (they're not exposed to AppleScript).\n", "Q: Setting Default Send-From Address on iPhone If I take a photo using the camera app, and then want to share it by email, the default is to send from my icloud email address. I have my gmail set up on my phone using exchange, and that had always been the default until recently (with all that icloud stuff).\nHow can I set my gmail address as the default send-from address when sharing a photo?\n\nA: For setting your default email account on an iOS device do the following:\nGo to:\nSettings -> Mail, Contacts, Calendar -> and scroll down to Default account.\n(Hope I translated it correctly, but I guess it is clear what I mean)\nSet the default account to your likings.\n\nA: I had to go to Settings -> iCloud and then turn off mail. \n", "Q: Nike+ FuelBand (Pedometer) with local analysis software - no personal data in cloud I want to buy the Nike+ FuelBand, but don't want my information to be in the cloud.\nExtracted from Wikipedia:\n\nIn addition to tracking personal workout statistics, the Nike+ integrates directly with the Nike website. Workout data can be automatically uploaded to the website during an iPod sync with iTunes or through another program via the website's public API. The uploaded information is mostly not personally-identifying, but does also contain some personal statistics such as weight (if configured). Workout data is stored in XML files on the iPod, which has led some web and applications programmers to offer alternatives to the official Nike reports.\n\nSo, is there any OS X software I can use to have these nice diagrams? And, is it possible to use the Nike+ FuelBand without syncing to the cloud?\n\nA: It's technically possible, but no apps have so far used the Nike+ Fuelband without using Nike's website. Hack Nike+ Fuelband tried to make this a reality, but there has been no progress. \n", "Q: Can I use an iMac as monitor for MacBook Pro? Is this possible with an early 2009 iMac without Thunderbolt and a 2011 MacBook Pro?\nMy dream solution looks like a Apple Thunderbolt Display!\n\nA: No, as the first iMac which allows this is the 27-inch Late 2009 iMac, as explained here.\nThere are, though, some Applications which may achieve something similar, requiring both computers to be connected to the same LAN/WiFi/VPN, and sending all the information, the one to be displayed on the second computer working as a display, through it. Such as ScreenRecycler. You can find some more here. \n\nA: Yeah, you actually can. Check out a program called Screen Recycler. It costs money, but the trial will work for long enough.\nAlso, check out air server and air parrot. If you run air parrot on the macbook, and connect to the iMac with air server, it will also work.\n", "Q: Install knoppix on usb with disk utility? I have downloaded the linux distro knoppix.\nI have snow leopard and i want to make a bootable usb with the above distro with the disk utility.\nI put the source to be the iso of the distro and destination to be the volume of my usb.\nWhen i click restore it throws error : invalid argument for the destination.\nAnyone have any idea about that? How do i do it?\n\nA: I have come across a similar issue merely trying to image dmg files to external disks with Disk Utility.app. Apparently, Disk Utility would prefer that before you begin your restore that you select the disk image in the left, and under the Image menu, select \"Scan Image for Restore,\" and after that process completes, then try the imaging operation. If you have already errored, you need to quit Disk Utility and relaunch it, or you will continue to get the same error.\n", "Q: OSX Mountain Lion: Automatically restarts after showing screen saver a certain amount of time Since I upgraded to Mountain Lion it happens to me every day when I enter the screen saver while having lunch it tries to restart the computer.\nI don't have any clue why this happens. If there is some process running and OSX can't automatically quit it, OSX will tell me that it couldn't restart. \nBut if there's no process like this running it will restart.\nI don't really want this behaviour and searched in system settings as well in the Console in order to see why this might happen but I don't have a clue as of why.\nOSX Mountain Lion 10.8.2 - MacBook Pro 15\" Late 2011\n\nA: Ok well. After getting more and more annoyed, I finally figured it out.\nApparently I enabled the automatic logout after 60mins of inactivity in the security settings. I really don't know why/when I enabled this and wouldn't consider myself a noob ;)\nFor anyone else looking for a howto on this:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/PH4014 (I found this page and thought: that must be it!).. It was.\n\nA: Not sure how to get rid of it - but this is an alternative (that I think is a lot better).\nGo to Settings > Deskop etc > Screensaver change it to your macs name/ the text with the apple logo - and then quit settings. After that go to Applications > Utilities > Keychain Access and go to Keychain Access(finder bar) > Preferences and find and tick where it says show in finder bar - a padlock should appear in your finder bar. Click that, and click lock screen and it will lock - and prompt you for a password when you go to log back in - it also shouldn't restart your mac (check your energy saver preferences pane)\n", "Q: Can I trust Apple Store's employees with my laptop? This might be a bizarre but crucial question, can I fully trust leaving my laptop in repairs (Genius Bar) while they have full access to it ?\nI recently went to the genius bar to get my display fixed, and apparently they asked for my laptop's password just in case they need some \"testing\" after they're done. Can't they do that as a guest account ?\nI got sensitive information on my laptop such as passport copies etc, as well as passwords saved in Safari's keychains for my bank account, paypal, amazon etc ..\nThe service is due later on today, shall I change my password and ask them to contact me directly if they need something specific ?? They're going to fix in 3 hours so I'll be in the mall whilst they finish.\n\nA: They can boot your mac from an external hard drive for testing (and if your laptops hard drive is not encrypted, they can access your files that way), so they don't need your password. I even removed the drive before repair and there wasn't a problem here.\n\nA: Would it be possible to temporarily transfer all your sensitive/important information to an external drive, and restore them later on back onto your laptop? For keychains you can use the Keychain Access utility application to export all your keychains, delete the saved ones on your MacBook, and then import them back when you get your MacBook back. Same applies for other save data. But if you have time, it would be most effective if you can do a Time Machine backup, and just wipe the machine with a brand new OSX install.\n\nA: The answers to this are very good, and I wanted to relate my experience in follow up to the service event.\nI went to the store and gave my laptop to the Genius Bar. They told me they will contact me if they need anything. They asked me if the password is correct in the system, and I told them it is when it really wasn't. I actually changed the password and created a guest account. Then, I told the guy if the password didn't work they can try the guest account, and he said \"Oh yeah certainly\". So I'm not sure why they needed the password in the first place.\nAnyway after 3 hours, another guy (who I was told was fixing my laptop) came and delivered  my machine with the brand new screen. I asked him if they needed to access my laptop and he said \"Well you can do that now if you want\" and I logged in my account. Basically he did not need to access my laptop for testing. However, maybe it is due to the fact that it was repaired in 3 hours (as I requested) and was not left with them for days.\nTLDR : I changed my account's password and created a guest account + I deleted Safari's saved passwords just to be safe -> They did not need to access my laptop to check if the screen has been fixed.\n\nA: YES. You should be 'paranoid' about this. I had a quick fix to my laptop- no need to get into my files. They ended up taking an extra day... Well long story short, I went back to grab my recent work files and found they weren't there. The recent files were all of my private pictures and information.I was able to check the history & found that my files had all been dug through. DO NOT TRUST THEM. I don't know how to avoid this, but I was completely violated...\n\nA: The problem with FileVault2 is that any admin user, once logged in, can look at any other user's data. \nWith that said, I will typically create a second account called \"Apple Tech Support\" when I leave a machine with Apple for repair. But if I'm really concerned about the data, I'll copy it all to an external drive (they only cost $99), wipe my system, and do a clean install.  When I get the system back I do a restore from the external drive to the internal drive. I use SuperDuper or CarbonCopy for that, rather than Apple's migration utility (which requires that you reinstall a lot of software.)\n\nA: You can probably trust the average genius team (since the machine will be under the watch of many people while it is out of your possession). From a legal standpoint, you have agreed to the AppleCare Repair Service terms and conditions by signing your property and data over to Apple. For the rest of this discussion on the contract between you and Apple relating to your data, I'll focus on the English north american contract.\nIt lays responsibility on the person bringing in the equipment to remove all confidential or proprietary information from the system. It also lays responsibility on Apple for having \"security measures, which should protect your data against unauthorized access or disclosure as well as unlawful destruction.\" which a lawyer will focus on should which is more binding than may but less binding than shall/must. It continues with\n\nYou will be responsible for the instructions you give to Apple regarding the processing of data, and Apple will seek to comply with those instructions as reasonably necessary for the performance of the service and support obligations under the Plan. If you do not agree with the above or if you have questions regarding how your data may be impacted by being processed in this way, contact Apple at the telephone numbers provided.\n\n\nBut why not be a bit skeptical and ask why you might trust them. Sure they are probably trained to protect personal data of customers and respect privacy and there is social pressure to not be a jerk with your personal data.\nSome devices (iPhones, iPads, Air and retina MacBook) require advanced skills and potentially damage to the equipment to remove the storage module, so this is something worth exploring a bit as not everyone can simply pop out the hard drive during service like older MacBooks allowed.\n\nI would say never give your password until you understand why it is being used and you are fully informed and willing to take that risk by disclosing your secret. I would also say, when I choose to not entrust a specific password, that I've done one of four things when I have something in for service that was in the category of data requiring more protection than none.\n\n*\n\n*Wipe the drive - if things are truly sensitive - I have no benefit to saving a short amount of time by not securely wiping all data that's sensitive before it leaves my control. (or paying for a higher level of service to ensure confidentiality)\n\n*Change the password to either my account or my keychain.\n\n*Make a new temporary account for the testing and give that. Sometimes I give them admin rights - other times I do not.\n\n*Give them a cell phone number and permission to call me 24/7 if they need the password and can explain why it's needed at that point of the repair.\n\nBasically, If you hand your computer to Apple - you are handing it to someone with the tools and training to bypass all passwords(including firmware and normal physical security of the case) and read the data from the hard drive or just take the storage and keep it. Unless you have FileVault or other encryption (like 1Password) and withhold that passphrase. A technician could if they wanted, make a full copy of your data and perhaps even go snooping. I would ask the genius (or technician) to help educate you to how security works before you proceed with this repair.\nIf you had a few extra-secret files, you could put them into encrypted disc images secured by a different phrase.\nThere are many repairs where a password is needed to complete the service if your service involves software changes. Normally, this password is asked for to speed up the repair for you and let them replace any and all parts needed to complete the repair. If they are in and find you need a new motherboard, they could just do that if you give them the extra permission and password they need to do all possible work without stopping to contact you and explain what/why.\nIn your case, I would simply say you'd like to know a bit more about how they secure your password and your data during service. I would bet that the person asking for your password was lulled by the 100th time they've checked in a machine and forgot to ask you if you had any questions or perhaps missed your uneasiness about what was being asked. Once you've made your concern concrete by asking why they need it - you can then say you'd feel better not giving it and ask if that will either delay or prevent the repair. Any shop I trust will spend time to address these concerns to your satisfaction before they would accept your password. They would also lay out for you how to secure things again after the repair - change these three passwords, etc...\nAs a class, my opinion and experience is that Apple service technicians are highly professional, trained on privacy of your equipment and information and have thought out very well what, how and why they ask for someone's password. But even if bad things have never happened despite good training and policy, mistakes can and will happen in returning the wrong laptop or theft and your data is at risk when in the shop.\nIt is you in the end who have the right (and responsibility) to be a little suspicious - especially when it's not clear how your password will be used during a repair. The clearer you can be with your concerns - the more comfortable you will be with your choice to trust the specific team you interact with on a case-by-case basis.\n\nA: Here's your answer:\n\nI agree that:\n[...]\n• Apple is not responsible for any loss, corruption, or breach of the data on my product during service; and\n[...]\n\nThe Genius Bar is staffed by people, not robots. Apple can't force them to follow the rules, so there is always a chance that they do something with your data that they're not supposed to.\n\nA: What kind of question is this?\nHow do you ever know you \"can trust\" someone?\nTrust involves data.  You must have past experience that shows they can be trustworthy.  If you're really worried about it, find a different service: one that you trust.\nOr move your sensitive stuff off your laptop while they work on it.  There's a process I imagine that HR does to avoid getting unethical workers in.  It's called an interview.  100% accurate?  No.  Employees will always follow rules?  No.\nThis is the world we live in.  Protect yourself, but I always extend others the same trust as I would want them to extend me.  I give an appropriate amount of access and I take it on faith that it won't be abused.  If I find there's a breach, I look for how I failed, not how to blame the other.  Because indeed, it is my failure.  I didn't have to give them my sensitive information and full access to it.\nEDIT: with regards to \"What kind of question is this?\" - what I'm getting at, is this is not a question of technical nature.  It is highly subjective and worse still, may inspire fear, without basis, into readers of it.  There's no actual, real answer to be had here: it's about who you're willing to trust.  Keep your security in mind and evaluate for yourself.\n\nA: I think some people here are being paranoid. When it comes right down to it, they are not interested in your personal data. They are pushing through, trying to get your problem fixed, so they can push on to the next one.\nThere are a lot of repair related things that require an admin password to accomplish; things which cannot be done from a guest account. I am the Mac tech support person at my work place, and there is nothing worse than coming across the \"password needed,\" and the person has not left you their password. So far, I've always been able to figure out their passwords, but it would have been so much faster if I had just had it from the beginning.\nWhen I come across something I can't figure out, I take my hardware to the Genius Bar. I usually stand there and wait while they work on it, but at times, I have even left a Mac with them for several days at a time, and am none the worse for it.\n\nA: I had a laptop scratched by them once when repaired and they just shrugged it off. \nI would just make sure that the look at the laptops condition very carefully. I would (and did) trust them with data. \n\nA: All the tools you need to protect your data (and quit worrying about it) are already on your mac.\nUse FileVault. Encrypt your backup drive too. Do regular backups via Time Machine and when you do go in for service understand that they may need test and if you don't give them a password, that means they're going to wipe your machine to finish testing.\nI've only been there to fix hardware related problems and that's how it worked out. Sometimes they wipe it and some times they don't. I've never offered my password; just left them with \"wipe it if you need to. I have backups.\".\n", "Q: After reboot system time changed and menu bar items changed position I'm new to Apple Mac OS, just Bought a new Macbook pro 13\" Mid 2012 a month ago.

I have a Retina Macbook Pro with the following specifications :\n\n\n*\n\n*Mountain Lion OSX 10.8.2\n\n*Processor  2.6 GHz Intel Core i7\n\n*Memory  16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3 - 500 GB Flash Storage\n\n*286.83 GB of  499.42 remaining\n\n*\n\n*3.93 GB....

Other\n\n\n\nHow long will FileVault need to encrypt my system ?\n\nA: The process to enable FileVault will read the entire 500 GB of data - whether the block is empty or full and encrypt it with the keys you set up as part of the process. So, the background IO will run the fastest if you don't have other user level disk IO running. The encryption itself will take less than 10% of one CPU on that powerful (fast) Mac - so you are really just going to see a sustained 60 to 80 MB/s re-write of the entire drive if you let the Mac sit idle. A Mac with a spinning hard drive would see between 20 to 30 MB/s so an Air or any Mac with solid state drives will be two to three times faster in this operation.\nSo - from the time you start, I would estimate 2-3 hours if you are getting at least 70 MB/s for writing the encrypted data back to the disk. This process does run in the background and isn't really reversible once it starts, so you can kick it off and then track the progress with diskutil.\n  diskutil cs list\n\n\nA: FYI - I'm encrypting my 3.1 TB Fusion drive on my 2017 Retina 5k iMac.  It's consistently completing about 8.6 MB/second while the machine is doing NOTHING else.\nThat translates into 1% per hour, or more than 100 hours to complete the entire encryption process.\n", "Q: Airport Express with IPv6 tunnel and dynamic IP address I'm trying to set up an IPv6 tunnel through HE, using an Airport Extreme (7.6.1). I got it to work once, but have a real chicken and egg problem: I'm on a PPPoE internet connection, the Airport Express being the primary router/dialup device. Every single time it dials in, it receives a different IP address. I have set up an automated script on a machine that's permanently on, which will update HE with the current IPv4 address, but I'm running into timing issues. It seems the Airport Express only tries to establish the tunnel once after rebooting. If HE hasn't been updated by then (very likely), it will fail and apparently never try again. To make it try the IPv6 tunnel again, I need to reboot it, which makes it assume a different IP address etc etc.\nIs there any solution to this conundrum? Can the Airport Express be persuaded to try reestablishing the tunnel without restarting it?\n\nA: Right, slightly late, but I had the same problem.  Although my circumstances vary a little.  I am using a FortiGate FW instead.  The solution should be almost the same though.\nYou can read my \"guides\" on this here:\nhttp://blog.belodedenko.me/2013/07/dynamic-ipv6-updates-using-ddclient-for.html\nhttp://blog.belodedenko.me/2013/06/a-practical-guide-to-setting-up-ipv6.html\nIn summary you will need to configure ddclient with a helper script to extract your IPv4 public IP directly from the Apple router (not via default web mechanism) [see n1] and update the HE tunnel end-point (e.g.)\n# /etc/ddclient.conf\n\ndaemon=300                              # check every 5 minutes\nsyslog=yes                              # log update msgs to syslog\n#mail=root                              # mail all msgs to root\n#mail-failure=root                      # mail failed update msgs to root\npid=/var/run/ddclient.pid               # record PID in file.\n\n# update tunnel end-point address\nprotocol=dyndns2\nuse=cmd, cmd=/opt/scripts/use-apple-snmp.sh\nserver=ipv4.tunnelbroker.net\nscript=/nic/update\nlogin=your_HE_tunnelbroker_login\npassword=your_HE_tunnelbroker_password\n<your-HE-nick>-<#tunnel>.tunnel.tserv<#num server>.lon1.ipv6.he.net\n\nOnce your router reboots and/or and gets a new public DHCP lease, you HE tunnel will be temporarily down.  Once ddclient runs and updates the HE tunnel end-point, your tunnel should come up.  I've had this running for a while now, and it usually taken no more than x2 ddclient intervals (10 minutes) to get the tunnel back.\nNotes:\n[n1] http://ampedup.wordpress.com/2012/08/02/get-the-internet-ip-address-from-your-airport-via-bash-script/\n", "Q: 30-pin Dock Connector and 3.5mm jack Here's what I got, a Panasonic docking system without aux in. I want to use an AirPort Express and turn it into a AirPlay-enabled speaker, so I need a cable that has a female 30-pin connector at one end, and 3.5mm jack at another.\nI did do some research on the Internet, I see people selling those, BUT, since I live in Taiwan, I can't get one. I'm wondering if I can buy two cables:\n\n\n*\n\n*a 30-pin connector extender cable that has a female 30 pin connector at one end that I'll need to attach to the male dock 30 pin connector\n\n*a male to male headphone cable\n\n\nIf I knew the pin out for the 30 pin protocol, I might be able to cut and splice the two together.\nWhat I'm needing to try this experiment is to know what the pin out is for a 30 pin connector and if I can simply wire the audio out from the AirPort Express into a female 30 pin connector by simply splicing wires. (or to hear from someone that knows that I would need to have some other resistor or voltage present to tell the dock that it's getting an stereo input from \"my iPhone\" which is really the cable to the express.\n\nA: I'm trying the very same thing. I made one myself but the dock station didn't see anything connected so didn't enable the audio signals. I then saw a cable 30pin to 3.5 on the Internet which I ordered and this is doing exactly the same thing. The dock station only uses pin 1 or 2 for signal Gnd and pins 3 and 4 for left and right audio signal. \n", "Q: Using Ram pulled from new iMac in an old iMac? My parents have an iMac circa 2007. Documentation says that this model should use this type of RAM:\nMemory: DDR2 PC2-5300\nMemory Type: DDR2 PC2-5300, DDR2 (non-ECC)\nMaximum Memory: 4GB \nI've got a couple of 2GB RAM chips lying around that I just pulled from my \"new\" iMac. The info on the chips reads:\n2GB 1Rx8 PC3\nWill these work in my parent's iMac, or am I just asking for trouble?\nThanks!\n\nA: No.\nThose new iMacs are using DDR3, and it won't even fit.\nDDR2 are pretty cheap right now, you can get some off the Internet.\n", "Q: Can't sync calendars with iCloud I tried to enable Calendar sync at Settings > iCloud > Calendar and a message says \"Activating Calendar sync\" but it ends up in Home screen with no changes. When I go again to iCloud setting I see Calendar option is not enabled.\nAnother problem I found is that I can not invite other people to appointments. It seems iCloud is not working for my Calendar.\nHow can I enable iCloud Calendar syncing?\n\nA: Try removing the iCloud account from your iPhone, and then adding it back. This has solved a number of my own iCloud-related issues in the past. \n", "Q: Hide/Show menu bar similar to dock? Do you know if it is possible to hide/show the menu bar similar to the Dock?\nI found about Menu Eclipse , but I think you can't use the menu bar space, and additionally it costs $1.99.

Go to System Preferences > General  and turn on \"Automatically hide and show the menu bar.\"\n\n", "Q: New Notes Will Not Sync From Mac to iPhone or iCloud If I create a new note on my iMac (OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion), it will not appear on either iCloud or my iPhone 5 (updated with the latest iOS).  However, I CAN edit existing notes and those changes do sync to the cloud and to my iPhone.  Very Annoying.  I can create a new note on either cloud or iPhone and it all syncs.  I just CANNOT create a new note on the Mac and have it sync to the cloud.\nAlso, in case you wonder, I do not have this problem with either calendar entries or contacts.  I am able to create new contacts and events on my Mac and they all sync to the cloud and my iPhone.\n\nA: I had the same problem, and found out how to solve it. The default account for notes on the mac is \"On My Mac\" you want it to be \"iCloud\". \nHow to make that happen: \n\n\n*\n\n*open the notes app \n\n*click on notes in the notes.app menubar\n\n*set default account to \"iCloud\". (You can also click help and search for default account to find the option.)\n\n\nA: I had the same problem and found a solution.\nI when to System Preference and then iCloud...\nDeleted my iCloud account on my mac and all the information with it and then re-activated it.\nThat solved the problem.\nGood Luck\n", "Q: Can I sync the pictures I currently have in Picasa on my PC with the iPhoto app on my new iPad? How do I sync the pictures I currently have in Picasa on my PC with the iPhoto app on my new iPad?\n\nA: Since picasa is a google property, you could integrate all your pictures to Google Plus and use their mobile app to view the pictures.\nFrom there, you can get photos into the camera roll. This would preserve the organization of your albums in Picasa until you get them into iOS. This would be best if you only import a few pictures or don't mind re-organizing things once the pictures are on iOS.\nFor a more complex collection, you will want to download all the photos to your PC and then import them into Photoshop. The Windows version of iTunes can read Adobe Photoshop Album 2.0 or later as well as Adobe Photoshop Elements 3.0 or later and sync collections of photos in a way that iOS can understand. \nPerhaps someone has a better solution, but these are the best two solutions I can come up with for getting Google and Apple to play nicely together with your photos.\n", "Q: Question about Macbook Hard-driver replacement My OSX 10.8.2 crashed recently, I think I got a very good chance to replace my Hard drive as I need more storage. My question is: Can I seamlessly transfer my data (Include my iTunes music library and music playing history, iOS device synchronization record) to the new hard drive after replacing the hard drive WITHOUT using Time Machine? Because I got have no additional external hard drive for backup.\nThanks.\n\nA: Yes.\nFor only a few dollars you can buy a Sata/usb external hard drive enclosure. Remove your old hard drive and put it into the enclosure. Boot your computer up using the external drive by holding down option when starting up and selecting your drive. Then download Carbon Copy Cloner (free). Using that you can clone over all your data to the new drive which you install in your computer. If you cannot boot, like that. Re-install 10.8 to the new drive in the data enclosure, then copy over all your data using Carbon Copy Cloner. If you want to backup your sync data and iTunes library, your iDevice backups are stored in your local library folder. \"~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/\" The iTunes library is stored in ~/Music/iTunes\n", "Q: How do I remove a stuck Mini CD from the SuperDrive on a Macbook Pro? I have a 2010 13\" MacBook Pro that someone inserted one of those Mini CD type discs in to. The SuperDrive happily ingested the media but now refuses to spit it out. It does not show up as a mounted drive in Disk Utility.\nI tried starting the machine up while holding down the Eject key and the SuperDrive makes a few clicks, but the media doesn't eject and the OS boots as normal.\nThere does not appear to be a hole on the outside of the Macbook where I might be able to insert a paperclip to push the media out.\nIs there any way to get the disk out of the drive or am I destined for a Genius Bar appointment?\n\nA: Thankfully I haven't had to deal with this, but I did find a few suggestions on how to deal with this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use gravity. Tilt the MBP (you'll probably want it turned off) and see if you can slide it out.\n\n*Try to force-eject it by holding down the mouse button as it boots. Possibly combined with tilting it. I don't have great faith in this one (I believe discs are ingested/ejected using some sort of bands at the side, so they may not be able to make contact with the disc).\n\n*Try a business card or other thin but stiff object with some sticky tape to try and grab the disk. With this one you'll obviously want to make sure the tape is securely attached to your grabber object so that it doesn't come off inside your drive, making things worse.\n\n\nA: Do not stick anything else in the slot. Really.\nThe inject / eject mechanism is keyed for a full sized disc and you don't want to wedge it in the wrong direction or retract that delicate part any further by fishing around inside the narrow slot. There is no eject button so you will need either luck or finesse and skill to get the CD out.\nPower down the Mac and hold it firmly with the Apple logo facing you at chest height with the CD slot pointing to your lap. Gently rock and shake it to see if the CD is loose and encourage it to peek out the felt skirt that is inside the unibody enclosure.\nYour Mac when powered off is very strong and you gently start it down and then quite forcefully yank it back up vertically. One or two shakes is all it takes to get the mini CD poking out just a bit. At that point, the felt will hold it and you can return the Mac to a level table and use tweezers or needle nose pliers or nimble fingers to remove the CD.\nIf you can't get it out - take it in for service. Unless you work on these regularly, you don't know which model superdrive is in your Mac and how hard, deep, gentle you can be with tools to help dislodge the CD. Also, if you are comfortable popping the back off your Mac - you could use iFixit to get to the drive itself and the CD will likely fall out once you have that component out of the Mac and away from the felt skirt.\nAgain, have a good firm grip - if you are so nervous that your palms are sweaty, that's your signal to see about getting a technician to help or waiting a bit to convince yourself you can shake it loose. These computers are made to endure UPS and FedEx shipping, packing in luggage in a bumpy car and your shaking should be on that level of violence and no more. If it's lodged behind the eject mechanism, you'll need someone to get inside and clear things in most cases. \n\nA: I would recommend taking the back cover off the Macbook exposing the RAM, HDD, and Optical drive. Then unplug the battery. Then remove the three screws securing the Superdrive in. Slide the superdrive out and disconnect the Sata wire connecting the Superdrive to the logic board.\nAfter the superdrive is removed, either try to slide the mini-disk out using different tools or tweezers. If you cannot get it out that way. Take apart the optical drive until you can access where the disk is stuck. Take out the disk, then reassemble the optical drive and the Mac.\n\nA: See this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mnh7TQUsTg\nOr do this:\nJust power off and holding the MBP upside down just shake it in a vertical motion. The mini cd should pop out.\n\nA: Very simple: Power OFF first. Hold Mac in a vertical position with CD Drive positioned South, knock it on your lap moderately as necessary. The cd will just come out. \n\nA: I used an expired credit card.  Wrapped sticky tape around the end, sticky side out. Secured it with more tape, smooth side out, so only the edges of the card were sticky. Slid the card in above the CD and put gentle downward pressure on it as I withdrew the card.  The CD rolled out. \n\nA: if you can see edge of mini CD ,try putting standard size CD on top of this mini CD and push it as much as it goes inside and then pull it out it will take both CDs out.\n\nA: Using two cards to pull it gently works\n\nA: I was able to extract the CD by fishing around the slot gently with a business card (scotch tape affixed). Thanks a ton for the advice!\n", "Q: Mac File Sharing with Windows 7 I haven't found any useful info about what to do when asked for a password whilst sharing files between Mac and Windows. My scenario: I have ONE user on my Mac (somebrit) and no one else, not even guest. I have ONE fileshare located at /Users/somebrit/share.\nI'm using Mountain Lion -> System Preferences -> File Sharing -> SMB Sharing and have selected the folder to share. For all intents and purposes, I've allowed unrestricted access to it.\nOn the Windows side, I simply hit Start, type \\\\IP\\ and can see the Mac. After clicking it, I'm instantly prompted for a username/password and having tried my-mac\\somebrit and the password, nothing.\nCan someone please help my sanity and provide some answers?\n\nA: When connecting to a Mac from a PC for file sharing, you should be able to use your full username that shows up on your login screen and the password associated with it. For example, when connecting from a PC to a Mac someone with the username \"John Doe\" would sign in using that as the username. They would use their password associated with that account as their password, but make sure that that account is enabled in System Preferences to support SMB file sharing, because if the account is not enabled, then you cannot log in. Here is a screenshot of what I mean: \n\n\nA: From my experience, I use the IP address then the user's name. For example, instead of using my-mac\\somebrit, use [my-mac's_IP_address]\\somebrit and you will get in. Your hostname may only be in the mode where only only other Macs can view my-mac. Remember, Macs communicate via SMB to Windows machines for file share. Mac to Mac, you can use AFP in conjunction with SMB.\n", "Q: Logitech C615 on Macbook Air (Mac OSX 10.8.2) I have been looking into buying a web cam to serve as a document camera.  I have read a lot of conflicting reviews on the Logitech C615. Does anyone know if the webcam is compatible with my OS?\n\nA: The simple answer is \"yes\". I have Mountain Lion and just received my C615. I'm able to record photos and movies, using the provided LWS software, and play them back via QuickTime. Cannot speak for other apps. Be aware that many of the features (e.g., zoom) that are available on Windows are not (currently) available on the Mac. \n", "Q: How can I stop incoming e-mails interfering with music playback? I use my iPod Touch to playback music. I have it plugged into a music system. When an e-mail is received the iPod notifies me by beeping and lowering the volume. This is undesirable for me.\nHow can I make my iPod play music and never lower the volume?\n\nA: Because the iPod Touch doesn't have a Mute switch like the iPhone, you will have to disable all the alerts in Settings > Sound. This can be done by tapping \"None\" on each of the Sounds (i.e. New Mail, etc.)\nIf you have iOS 6, you can switch on Do Not Disturb. You can then customize the settings in Notifications > Do Not Disturb. You could allow all calls (Facetime for later gen iPods) by changing the \"Allow Calls From\" settings. However, there will not be any text notifications - or anything else for that matter.\n", "Q: Can't sync photos from Windows to iPhone since iOS 6 Since the update to iOS 6, my iPhone (or iTunes) does not copy the photos I have on my Windows system to the iPhone.\nThe update to iOS 6.0.1 doesn't seem to have helped.\nI have removed all photos from both the iPhone and the sync area on the Windows system, but when I return the photos to the sync area, nothing gets copied to the iPhone.\nHow can I get my photo sync to work again?\n\nA: Alright, I got it working again.  Something in the following ritual did the trick:\n\n\n*\n\n*remove all photos and videos from the sync directory on the Windows system\n\n*sync\n\n*empty out the directories on the iPhone visible through the windows explorer\n\n*remove all photos and videos from the iPhone\n\n*sync\n\n*recreate the sync directory on the Windows system with all the directories and photos (except the \"Thumbnails\" folder) as you want them\n\n*go back into iTunes while the iPhone is connected, note that the \"sync photos\" checkboxk is cleaerd, re-check and verify that iTunes is looking at the correct sync directory\n\n*sync\n\n\n...and the photos are there.  I don't know which chicken-wave was the one which actually fixed the problem.\n\nA: You could use other software like iExplorer. If you can't be waiting, use iCloud to sync %HOME%\\Pictures\\iCloud Photos\\My Photo Stream and copy out.\n", "Q: My iphone 3GS suddenly shuts down i have a nice iPhone 3GS which has a curious behaviour.\nI'm not using it often but when i'm doing CPU intensive things like a game, it just shuts down suddenly, screen becomes black an i can't restart it without putting it on the charger. It's not hot.\nThen i plug it, and it just boots and is runs ok with the same battery level as before the crash.\nI thought changing the iOS would fix that but it doesn't .. i'm on iOs 6 and it's still the same behaviour\nWhat could i do ?\nthanks\n\nA: Sometimes when you run some games that is not compatible with your iPhone, it will use more power than it can to the CPU and GPU and then it will crash. Try to verify if the game is compatible with iPhone 3GS \n\nA: If it's CPU related then it's likely heat or a problem with the logic board / processor unit.\nIf it's related to a certain point in the battery discharge cycle, it's likely the battery and more inexpensive to repair.\n", "Q: Control Music From Notifcations Bar Using iOS6 is there a way to show or display music controls inside the notifications bar for quick access? \nNote: I am looking for a native way to do this. If there is not a way I would welcome 3rd party apps that do this function, however, I prefer the standard music player and do not want to change the music player. \n\nA: Unfortunately, there is no built in way to do this with iOS 6 (or lower).\nThere are other ways to control music playback that may function as a work around for you. \n\n\n*\n\n*If the device is unlocked, double tap the home button and swipe the row of apps from left to right. This will display Play/Pause controls. Swipe one more time - on an iPhone or iPod Touch - for volume control.\n\n*If the device is locked, double tap the home button. This will display music controls.\n\n\nA: There is no way to do this natively. There may be a third party app, but I don't know about it. You will probably need to jailbreak to achieve this functionality.\n", "Q: SSD adapter for optical drive I'm going to add a SSD drive to my macbook pro.\nI'm wondering if the optical drive adapter can have any influence on the disk speed, taking it down from a SATA III to a SATA II or I.\n\nA: Regarding SATA I, II and III and getting the best speeds speeds — it really depends on what specification your machine is, and what adapter you get.\nI would suggest you install the SSD in place of your original HDD, that way you don't lose out on the SSD's potential because of an adapter:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pros from Early 2011 and onwards do have SATA III (6 Gbit/s) connectors for their main HDD compartment.\n\n*But ones from Mid 2010 and before have SATA II (3 Gbit/s).\n\n\nIn either case, I would install the SSD there, and then install the HDD in the optical bay, because:\n\n\n*\n\n*From what I know, newer MacBook Pros support SATA III in their SuperDrive bay — so to take advantage of it, you'll need to get an optical bay adapter bracket that supports it too.\n\n*MacBook Pros from around 2011 (and older) have SATA II in the optical bay.\n\n\nTo find out what you have, go to Spotlight (the magnifying glass in the top-right of your screen), and type \"System Information\", open that app, go to Hardware > Serial-ATA > Link Speed and it should say there.\n", "Q: kernel_task consumes 500% CPU on AC power, sometimes Typically, my kernel_task process uses 1-4% CPU and 100-700MB of memory. However, sometimes when I have the power adapter plugged in, the CPU usage jumps to around 500% (8 cores) and stays there until I unplug the power adapter. I can plug it back in and everything is fine for a few seconds or a few days, then it eventually happens again. How can I stop this from happening?\n\nA: In my experience this has always been due to a hardware fault. However before doing anything else reset the SMC as detailed here: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964 as its power related. \nThis appears to happen when the Mac is struggling to communicate with hardware. Which Mac is it? How old is the battery? Is your battery life still good? Has the Mac had any damage - dropped? Liquid? Have you tried a different power adapter? \n\nA: I got this issue once on my 15-inch Mid 2012 MBP running 10.8.4 because the audio input had switched to the internal microphone and it was picking up the constant noise of my fan.  Switched the audio input to Line In and cpu usage dropped from 524% to 3%\n\nA: http://www.rdoxenham.com/?p=259 covers disabling the kernel extension responsible for triggering this misbehavior. However, doing so also disables some other thermal management functionality.\n\nA: The folks who observed \"AC power\" contributes are on to something.\nHigh chassis temperature from charging together with peripherals plugged in can cause this issue. Simply moving the charging cable from the left to the right ports can be enough to cool the hotspot and resolve the problem. On a machine with MagSafe try unplugging peripherals from the left ports until the battery is full.\nCPU usage has nothing to do with this. A hot CPU is throttled by reducing its clockspeed not by scheduling no-op load.\nSee https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/363933/27135 for causal proof.\n\nA: my kernel_task issue (cpu at -> 500% for ever) was blutooth related:\nhttp://droolfactory.blogspot.com.es/2012/08/mac-os-x-lion-kerneltask-with-high-cpu.html\n\nA: Please have a look at this typical problem: kernel_task at 300%\nand the suggested method of analysis: diagnosis of a CPU hog.\nThe Activity Manager isn't acurate enough to help you see that there are\nother processes indirectly loading the Kernel. top will unveil these hogs.\nTo display processes sorted starting with the biggest CPU consummer:\ntop -o cpu\n\n...sorted starting with the biggest virtual memory consummer:\ntop -o vsize\n\n...sorted starting with the process making the more context switches\n(being started and stopped with a huge frequency, sometimes the result of 2 processes talking together, not letting the other processes\nthe freedom to get the cpu):\ntop -o csw\n\n", "Q: How to start a service automatically after openning an application?

Thanks!\n\nA: Besides starting both programs via a script as you told I can only think of Keyboard Maestro which is a powerful macro program for Mac OS X Mountain Lion, Lion and Snow Leopard.  \nYou can do a lot of crazy stuff with it. And you can trigger macros when programs are running or not running which is what you want.\n", "Q: Activate app by pressing thumb on timeout / locked screen for few seconds This might seem like a strange question. Is there some sort of way for an app to launched by pressing the screen for a few seconds on touch screen phones? the reason why I ask is because this would be a great feature for like a panic button. of course the app will have to calibrate to the owner's thumb to prevent accidental pressing from objects in purse or pockets.\n\nA: Without jailbreaking, no. Even with jailbreaking, quite possibly not (you'd likely have to keep the entire screen on, which would burn a lot of power). The capacitive screen is turned off until you wake the device, so no amount of touching it will do anything.\nAdditionally, there's no real way to \"calibrate\" for the owner's thumb: a touch is a touch (on iOS devices). Objects in your purse or pockets, though, are rarely noticed by the screen because it's detecting energy being drawn away from it by the touching object (your human body is serving as a capacitor); that's why you can't register a touch with, say, a plastic pen or a gloved finger: the electrical charge isn't being siphoned off because it can't be transmitted through the pen or glove. Nothing commonly found in a purse or pocket would serve as a capacitor, so that part's safe, anyway.\n", "Q: How can I mirror one iPhone 4 to another? I have heard you can mirror an iPhone 4 so that whatever happens on one phone you will see on the mirrored phone. Can this really be done and if so how do I go about setting up the two phones? I am very technologicaly challenged, but I'd like to monitor my daughter's iPhone.\n\nA: Without jailbreak, No.\nWith jailbreak, still, No.\nFurthermore, it is considered pretty rude to do that IF it's for spying on someone.\n", "Q: Cannot disable three finger tap look up after migrating to a new computer I recently moved to a new MacbookPro and migrated my old computer's files/settings over to the new one.\nFor some reason I am unable to disable the ability to look up the definition to a word by using a three finger tap gesture.\n\n\n*\n\n*I have unchecked the \"Look up\" option in the Trackpad preference\npane.\n\n*I also disabled option to \"Look Up in Dictionary\" within Keyboard\npreference pane > Keyboard Shortcuts > Searching > Look Up in\nDictionary.\nI typically use BetterTouchTool to turn a three finger tap gesture into a middle click, I have disabled this feature for now and continue to have the issue where if I tap something with three fingers the text becomes highlighted and I am greeted with a definition to the word.

When I migrated over to my new Macbook Pro 13\" with Retina - the Retina only had 10.8.1 installed.  I learned that the update to 10.8.2 had been pulled after initially being released by apple because of misc issues on a few of their models - my 13\" Retina included.\nApple re-released a 10.8.2 version of OSX today that repaired my issue.\n", "Q: How painful is it to use multiple Apple IDs with the MAS? I have two different Apple IDs, associated with Apple Stores in different countries. On my iPhone, some apps were purchased with one ID, some with the other. This used to be really painful in iOS 5, but it's not so bad in iOS 6: the system detects all apps that need updates, no matter what account I am currently using for the App Store, and it asks for login information for the other account when it needs to update an app purchased with it.\nOn my Mac, all apps were purchased with a single account (including Mountain Lion). However, the other account is associated with the US store, which tends to have better prices, so I'd like to buy some apps there. But how bad is the experience going to be? Is the Mac App Store going to detect updates for apps in both accounts, and install the updates with minimal fuss? Or am I going to miss out on half the updates, potentially including OS updates?\nI would like to understand the exact experience I'm facing before I go this way, because I don't want to have the same mess I had with iOS 5 on my Mac.\n\nA: Not really, I personally used multiple account. You see update notifications for both accounts; however, to perform the updates for apps purchased with another account you have to manually log out and log into the other account.\n", "Q: Games on windows 8 in bootcamp lag even on lowest graphics I've been playing Crysis 2 and Skyrim on my Retina MacBookPro (10,1) for months now. The two games used to run super smoothly even on nearly maxed out settings. This laptop has an Nvidia GeForce GT 650M graphics card inside, it runs great.\nBut I recently replaced my Windows 8 consumer preview with the retail copy, and since then, 3D games lag in this odd way, no matter what the graphics settings. Every second Skyrim and Crysis alternates between running smoothly and lagging. It's a cyclical lag that comes and goes like clockwork. I can turn the graphics down to 800x600 with no antialiasing and low texture quality, and it runs much smoother on the \"up\" motion of the cycle, but every second it moves back into this lag spike.\nI've tried installing beta graphics drivers, re installing the operating system, re installing the bootcamp support software, and freeing up space (I have about 20 GB free). I can't figure out what suddenly caused this other than some obscure difference between the consumer preview and the retail version.\nWhat can I try? Is my video card failing? Are there some other drivers I can install? This isn't normal lag from maxing out the card, it\n\nA: I had something similar happen to me recently.

Does Mac OS X allow for the creation of iso files (similar to that of Windows) and if so can they then be run on a virtual drive within the operating system ?\n\nA: The usual format for this on OS X is a disk image (aka .dmg). To create them you can use Disk Utility.app (in /Appications/Utilities):\n\n\n*\n\n*insert the DVD you want to create the image from\n\n*start Disk Utility\n\n*select \"New Image\" from the toolbar and pick the DVD as a source. The .dmg can be stored wherever you want to\n\n\nTo open/use it afterwards, just doubleclick it in Finder.\n", "Q: Can I download applications/programs that are Mac specific on my Windows PC ? Can I download applications/programs, dmg image files etc that are Mac specific on my Windows PC when and where necessary, and then transfer them to my Apple Computer, with no loss of function ?\n\nA: In short, yes. Most application downloads are packaged either as a .dmg (Disk iMaGe) file, or as a package, ending in either .pkg or .mpkg. A .dmg is a regular file on Mac, Win, Linux, etc., so all you have to do is follow your usual transfer method and you can easily move it from PC to Mac.\nOn the other hand, .(m)pkg \"files\" are actually directories (just like the .app files in the Applications directory) so you need to take care to copy the entire directory from one device to the next. You can then install it like usual. However, many .(m)pkg packages are actually downloaded as .dmg files, so you shouldn't have any issues at all. Good luck!\n", "Q: Is MacKeeper a contoversial App that new Apple Users should be educated to stay away from? I see adverts for this particular app all over the place. Is it true that people should stay well away from it, as it could potentially do more harm than good to your Apple Computer, and to your wallet!!\n\nA: It's certainly true that the app is controversial - search the Apple Discussions site for more on that - and while there were certainly issues with early versions current versions are reported better. \nHowever, there are many with very significant reservations about the sales tactics the company uses - pop-ups, paid-for recommendations on review sites etc - and that its uninstaller didn't work for many versions, so users kept getting further advertisements, allied with the  facts that the things the app claims to do are either a: unnecessary or b: can be done with free or cheaper alternatives means that the app undeniably has a bad name with many Mac users.\nAnd again, for citation: search the Apple Discussions site for much, much more about this app.\n", "Q: Why are new Apps only compatible with the latest version(s) of Mac OS X & not backward comatible with earlier versions of the Operating System? I have noticed that many Apps require at least Mac OS X 10.7.4 to be installed on an apple mac and some apps even require Mac OS X 10.8 to be installed. Cant apps be made backward compatible for those users who may well be on earlier versions (ie Snow Leopard & Leopard). Is this also therefore a very good reason to upgrade to the latest version of the operating system ?\n\nA: The main reason is that the OS changes. This means that there are new functions that are available in the new OS to the developer. If the developer makes use of them then it is not possible or at least much harder to write the code to support the OS.\nOne example is the Mac App Store to be able to use this you need a newish version of SNow Leopard and it is not possible to provide a way to use in in Leopard.\nSo a developer has to make a choice, provide some functionality that only works on a new OS or write code much more quickly that only runs (or is tested under the new OS) or invest time (and thus money) in supporting the old OS but make the app available to more users.\n", "Q: Why does time machine backup take \"3 days\" over USB 3? I have an external hard drive connected using USB3 to my macbook pro retina and I am running time machine for the first time.  It is going very slow and estimate says \"3 days\".  I don't understand why its taking so long because my hard drive is 335 GB and I would expect a backup to take a few hours tops maybe.\nCan anyone explain if this is normal or if i am doing something wrong?\n\nA: This is not normal if every backup takes that long and/or it never finishes.\nYou should let the backup end if at all possible. Each time you interrupt a backup - you add even more time to check the slow work that was made and then pick up where it left off. If you interrupt a back up too many times, it could take a week to get over a problem spot.\nYou could:\n\n\n*\n\n*Let it run and see if the next time is quick.\n\n*Interrupt it and delete the partial backup\n\n*Clear the backups and start with a clean slate if you don't need the backups or don't care to troubleshoot a temporary issue.\n\n\nIf you want to troubleshoot, you have several options. Apple has a tmdiagnose tool that they use to collect logs and statistics relating to items that can cause problems. \nIf you can get help from Apple, I would do that and let them provide the training and expertise needed to make sense of the volumes of data that the diagnosis provides.\nThere are some other things you might try in this article:\n\n\n*\n\n*Time Machine: Troubleshooting backup issues\nFeel free to post back a more specific question if you find the issue doesn't resolve itself or you need more information about how to interpret your results from the article or the diagnosis tool. Also as you commented, it could simply be a bad hardware situation.\n\nA: It turns out the external harddrive was a lemon. I tried with a new external hard drive and it worked fine.. initial backup finished in 2 hours and time machines seems to be working fine now.\n\nA: I had this issue too. I'd previously run backups successfully but the latest was running for more than 2 days and was still barely moving. I erased the drive using Disk Utility and it's running normally now (a few hours to backup).\n", "Q: Cannot drag and drop files from the Dock folders On the Dock I have two folders, Documents and Downloads.\nI was used to drag files from the Downloads folder and drop them on the Desktop or somewhere else.\nNow I can't do it anymore. I'm only able to drag and drop files from the Dock folder to the Trash.\nHow can I fix it?\n\nA: Relaunching the finder fixed the problem.\n\nA: You can also try \"System Preferences -> Accessibility -> Trackpad\" and turn off \"Force Click and haptic feedback\".

It doesn't work on my new Macbook Pro, but another disk does.\nThis is a bus-powered drive. I tried rebooting my Mac, and plugging into a different USB port. The LED comes on when I plug it in, but that's it. If I put my ear to the disk, I hear mild clicking sounds (but I am not worried about data loss since the disk works great on my other machines, every time, without the clicking sound).\nAny idea what I can try? Use an AC power adapter? Thanks.\n\nA: Try using a USB - Y Cable! As the others have said... It appears the drive is not getting enough power. \nExample,\nhttp://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/USB3AYMBPB/\nI realize that is microusb but they make y cables with USB on all the ends.\nGoodluck! :) \n\nA: It definitely sounds like its not getting enough power.

You can unhide them by logging in to your account.\n", "Q: Will an iPad mini purchased in the US work well once it returns to live in England? My oldest daughter lives in England and is returning there after the upcoming holidays.\nHer Mother and I live in the USA. She desires an iPad Mini as a Christmas gift. She is an iPhone 4S user with O2 as her carrier in England.\nTwo questions seem tied in my mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*If we buy her an iPad Mini equipped with a 3G/4G radio and she intends to buy some sort of data plan in England, which one should we buy...the Sprint, the Verizon, or the AT&T model?\n\n*Are there advantages/disadvantages to setting up the iTunes account for her new iPad (a) in the US, with a US-based credit card; (b) in the UK (her home), with a US-based credit card; or (c) in the UK, with a UK-based credit card?\nI've looked around for an hour or so and cannot find definitive answers to these questions...or maybe I'm not savvy enough to understand what I've read.\n\nA: The LTE choice seems fairly clear as the Spring and Verizon models match the LTE coverage that EE has in the UK. O2 isn't listed, but you can see the information yourself here:\nhttp://www.apple.com/ipad/LTE/\nFurther information is available from the iPad specifications page - but the GSM/EDGE and UMTS/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA capabilities of both models are the same. The Verizon/Sprint models have more LTE bands and CDMA as well but in Europe, the LTE situation isn't totally clear yet.\nIf you get an Apple ID in the US - you will be restricted to the content in the US store. The same for choosing the UK store. Since it's a hassle to juggle accounts and you can't get updates from an old country if you move accounts to a new one - it's better to pick one account unless you intend to maintain and juggle both going forward perpetually.\nI would buy from Apple if you can since their holiday return policy is very lenient and you could return things in January if you choose poorly or learned more after buying. Also consider, AppleCare is tied to the country where you buy so if AppleCare plus isn't available in the UK and you are OK shipping it here for service, you might let that affect your buying choice if you want that coverage over the standard AppleCare.\nThe good news is you can easily use her UK account here in the US and all her apps will work on the US device. The only problems would be radio (not a problem on the mini hardware) and warranty support. Since you live here, you can get her a pay as you go month of data with no commitment or long term contract. She won't need to unlock it and can work with her choice of carriers to serve it in England. No carrier lock, no hassle, no jail breaking needed. \n\nA: EE=Orange in the UK so you definitely want the Verizon/Sprint model.\nUnless you have a compelling reason to use the US store, use the UK store. The credit card, store country, and address all have to be from the same country.\n", "Q: Someone has created an Apple ID using an email address in a domain I own I own \"mydomain.com\"  (actually something else!) and have a catchall to receive all emails sent to any xxxx@mydomain.com\nEarlier this week I received an email from appleid@id.apple.com asking me to verify annepearson@mydomain.com.  This person is unknown to me.  I did not verify.\nI have now received this email:\n\nDear Anne Pearson,\nThe password for your Apple ID annepearson@mydomain.com has been successfully reset.\nIf you believe you have received this email in error, or that an unauthorized person has accessed your account, please go to iforgot.apple.com to reset your password immediately. Then review and update your security settings at appleid.apple.com\n\nHas this person succesfully greated an Apple ID account with an email address she doesn't own?\nIf so, what can I do?\n\nA: \nHas this person succesfully greated an account with an email address she doesn't own?\n\nI don't think you can say they successfully created one, as they will never be able to use the email to verify anything sent to it from Apple. Most likely they just accidentally entered your domain name. Is it similar to another more popular domain name? A one off typo?\n\nIf so, what can I do?\n\nSmile and imagine how perplexed they are that they never get the verification emails Apple tells them they are sending. They have not taken anything from you or done anything to you. Therefore, there is nothing for you to do. \n\nA: Everything looks to be explainable by someone using your email address as the string for their Apple ID.\nThis could be an innocent mistake or them wanting you to perhaps consider selling your domain to them by them squatting on your name space for Apple's iCloud service / Apple ID service.\nIf you don't even plan to use Apple's products or this email address you could simply ignore all the emails - make a rule and just never confirm any account that tries to use that email.\nThe \"what can I do\" boils down to if you care if they have an account with Apple using your email? You could fight it, but it will take some time and perhaps writing a letter to Apple to clear things up.\nAs long as you don't verify that email - it won't work for that person and they will need to provide another email to use that Apple ID. They will have squatted on that AppleID but nothing else. Apple uses a two step email verification process to ensure that someone doesn't accidentally or intentionally get an email that they do not control listed for an Apple ID.\nYou could also log in and take control of that account but I've not seen Apple spam unverified email accounts and that person will likely tire of manually logging in and sending verification emails to an account they don't control. More likely, they will delete that email from the Apple ID and move on.\n\nA: When I tried to create a new apple ID using my email I was told that an account under that username or email already exists. So when I requested to change password I received an email in Vietnamese addressed to someone else. So I can confirm that someone can create an apple ID using anyone's email address.\n\nA: I just had a similar experience and got off the phone with a rep from Apple and they said there is nothing they can do to help.  Any email account can be used to sign up for an apple ID if it has not already been used as an apple ID, so someone used my other email account, not linked to Apple as their ID log in name.  Their email is the emergency email and only they know the security questions to make changes to the account and if you forget the security questions, Apple sends an email to the emergency email, not the main email, so this guy will get that email and will still be in control of the security questions required to make changes. So Apple could do nothing and this guy is allowed to use my email as his apple ID as long as he wants and I will receive emails from Apple when he uses his device, etc.  I did change the password to my email account, in case it was hacked and to the Apple account, so unless he resets it with his backup email, he can't get in and I will play that game until he gets so annoyed he stops using my email address. He probably has a credit card assigned to the account, but it is not my card and I can't access those areas to see because you need to answer the security questions.  It's a catch 22 and is super annoying.  \n\nA: I think this may be a phishing. I advise you to check the 3 following key\npoints:\n\n\n*\n\n*Within the headers of the 2 E-mails you received, verify\nthey are really originating from apple.com .\n\n*Verify the included URL is really within the apple.com domain.\n\n*Within the headers, verify there isn't any Return-Path: outside of apple.com .\n\n\nA: Most likely you answered your question in the very first sentence of your question, and the likely answer is that such email address doesn't exist. Typically catch-alls catch only messages sent to non-existing email addresses at the domain. If your catch-all is configured that way (and that's the default setup for all email services that I've seen), the fact that the email message ended up in the catch-all mailbox means that no such email address exist. \nAs for the source of that email message -- it was already suggested that either somebody mistyped it or is some kind of phishing attempt.\nIf your catch-all mailbox catches all emails received at the domain, even the ones sent to legitimate email addresses, that's another story (I haven't seen such setups, but they are possible). In that case, it is not clear if such an email address exist. To check, disable the catch-all, send email to the email address and see if it bounces.\n\nA: According to Apple Support, you can guess the security questions or use a different email. They could verify for me that the account never verified the email (in the 7 years since it's creation), but they have no capacity to unlink the email address.\nApparently you can squat an apple id for any email address regardless of whether you have access to it and Apple can't do anything to resolve this.\n\nA: This just happened to me. Some guy accidentally created an Apple ID using my email address. He absolutely did not have access to my email.\nI was able to reset his password by guessing the answer to one of the silly \"security questions\". I then logged on to his account, checked the phone number on the IPhone connected to his account and called him. He was a bit surprised.\nNow I'm just wondering: why on Earth does Apple allow you to create an account without verifying the email?\n\nA: I experienced the same problem today. I contacted the support team and I can confirm, apple (at least for a while) did not care to verify that requestor owns the email of the proposed Apple ID name.\nThis means that who first register its device wins the ID and no matter who really owns the email address of that ID. I think this is a quite dangerous choice in terms of personal security and sensible data threatment.\n", "Q: What is the difference between the iPad Mini model numbers A1454 and A1455? Apple lists the iPad mini models on the Identifying iPad models web page and lists two cellular models:\n\n\n*\n\n*A1454 on the iPad mini Wi-Fi + Cellular\n\n*A1455 on the iPad mini Wi-Fi + Cellular (MM)\n\n\nI can't seem to find a mapping between these models and the iPads for sale by Apple since they list the intended carrier and a different part number like MD534LL/A. Apple has a nice LTE page for iPhones, but I can't find the iPad page.\nIn the US, the Black 16 GB iPad Mini (2012) has the following parts for our three cellular carriers:\n\n\n*\n\n*AT&T - MD534LL/A\n\n*Sprint - ME215LL/A\n\n*Verizon - MD540LL/A\n\n\nNone of the Apple LTE articles seem to be updated yet for the 4th Generation iPad with LTE or the iPad Mini with LTE so I'm stumped at the moment. What is the difference between the Cellular A1454 model and the Cellular (MM) A1455 model?\n\nA: The comparable page you're looking for is: http://www.apple.com/ipad/LTE/. A1454 is used for AT&T and similar Canadian networks only, while Sprint, Verizon and overseas carriers use A1455.\nAll bands are also listed on the specs page:\n\n\n*\n\n*Model A1454\n\n*\n\n*GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz)\n\n*UMTS/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz)\n\n*LTE (Bands 4 and 17)\n\n\n*Model A1455\n\n*\n\n*CDMA EV-DO Rev.

But apple have not earthed the stubbly plug for the macbook pro transformer. So on the short lead the only way the charger is earthed is when I touch it or the macs unibody which gives you a sort of vibrating feeling on your palms.\nWhen I went to the genius bar to complain about it they said that it was completely 'normal'. Where their definition of normal is that every MacBook does it. I have had 4 MacBooks and all have done it.  \nThe genius did say that he though he has seen a few earthed 3pin plugs. So my question is where can I pick one up? or how could we force apple to earth the stubby plugs and recall them? \n\nA: This is so commonly misunderstood that I shall attempt to provide a short précis, then link to a good explanation which is not overly-technical.\nCommon misconception - earthing/grounding\nMost small household appliances are not, in fact, earthed at all - even if there is a valid earth pin on the mains plug.\nThey are what is known as 'double insulated' & carry this logo\n\nThe 'transformers' on this type of equipment are not the same as in high-power equipment & don't use a step-down coil transformer, linear supply. Instead they use a switch-mode supply.\nAll PSUs, whether linear or switch-mode leak a small amount of current due to capacitance. In double-insulated devices there is no true ground/earth so the design is optimised to try to prevent this leakage.\nUnfortunately, switch-mode supplies run at very high frequencies, so the smaller capacitance in the smaller transformer ends up leaking just as much as the larger capacitance in a larger transformer running at 50 or at 60Hz for example.\nThe leakage current is usually less than 1mA and is often as low as 10uA, but even at such low current, it can still be present and still can cause problems.\nSo - the tingle or buzz that you feel is in fact you becoming the temporary ground/earth for this circuit.\nIt is usually safe, & any reputable manufacturer will ensure their PSUs are well within tolerance.\nCheap copies are cheap because they don't bother with most of the safety circuitry… you know, the stuff that makes the expensive one expensive in the first place ;-)\nHave look at http://www.unitechelectronics.com/sparks.htm for a much more detailed explanation. Though it is aimed at hi-fi users & deals in 240v mains, the basic principles are identical.\n\nA: In countries where the plugs to the mains are not earthed (or grounded to power as we say across the pond) you can buy and use a US cable that carries a third conductor for grounding/earthing and get your electrician to fit sockets or equivalent wiring past the Apple kit. \nI have also seen people ground their work surface like you do in a static safe work environment. If the Mac can ground itself through the table, you won't feel the leakage voltage / current since you are no longer the best path to ground. \nThis tingly feeling bugs me to no end, but Apple does make adapted and cables to have a ground so you might need to use them over the standard UK kit. I'm \"lightly shocked\" the genius there didn't suggest more options for you. \n", "Q: How can I assign different characters to different keyboard shortcuts on Mac? I am using Macbook Air with OS 10.8.2. I bought my MAC from the US, and then moved to another country. Therefore, I had to change my keyboard language.\nThe problem is the keyboard layout is not the same.\nFor instance when I type:\nShift + 9 it is supposed to show '('. But instead it shows ')'\nThere are a lot of similar shortcuts.\nWhat I want it when I type Shift + 9 on my keyboard, I want to show '(' which is the same character that is written on the physical keyboard.\nI want to reassign characters to these shortcuts. \nI tried a software called Ukelele, but could not get it to work well for me. \nIf you have used Ukelele before, please let me know how can I do it step by step.\nOtherwise do you have any other solutions for me?\n\nA: If the manual provided with Ukelele is not sufficient, you can ask for help with specific problems at the users group\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/ukelele-users\nIt might be easier to just use the US Extended layout.  Shortcuts for Turkish special characters are\noption c, then c  ç\noption b, then g  ğ\noption w, then i  ı\noption u, then o  ö\noption c, then s  ş\noption u, then u  ü  \nPS Have you tried the Turkish Qwerty layout (instead of Turkish Qwerty PC) in system prefs/language & text/input sources?  It may also do what you need via the option keys while keeping the usual other shortcuts.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open Ukelele and Choose File > New Based on Current Input Source\n\n*Edit the layout and save it as a bundle to /Library/Keyboard Layouts/. Keyboard layouts in the user library aren't selected by default in password dialogs. The popovers shown when holding keys don't work with normal keylayout files.\n\n*Log out and back in\n\n*Enable the input source in System Preferences\n\n\nApplying changes to a keylayout file requires logging out and back in after for example running touch /Library/Keyboard Layouts/.\nYou can disable the default layouts by removing them from ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.HIToolbox.*.plist and logging out and back in.\nAnother option would be to use KeyRemap4MacBook.\n", "Q: Create keyboard shortcuts for menu bar items that don't have shortcuts? How can I create a keyboard shortcut for something that doesn't have a keyboard shortcut? Example, I use Airparrot to mirror my iMac to my Apple TV.

That way I can just use a remote on my iphone while I'm sitting on my couch to mirror my iMac remotely, without having to go upstairs to the computer and back down.

I want to enable encryption on an external FireWire disk. The disk has been formatted a while ago (2+ years), and when choosing \"encrypt volume\" from the Finder context menu, Mountain Lion refuses with the message: \n\nA Recovery system for the targeted disk is required\n\nTurns out: You need a Recovery Partition (RP) on the external disk you want to encrypt. Mine does not have one, as it was formatted when there were no Recovery Partitions. \nReformatting the drive does create a new RP, but I can’t do this because I have no spare disks where I can swap the data to.\nThis hint is not useful, as it deals with internal disks.\nSo I am looking for a way to create a Recovery Partition on the external disk so that I can enable encryption for this disk. (How) can this be done? \nEDIT: Yes, there is space on the disk for another partition. diskutil list:\n/dev/disk2\n   #:                       TYPE NAME           SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme               *320.1 GB   disk2\n   1:                        EFI                209.7 MB   disk2s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS le_disk        306.7 GB   disk2s2\n\nEDIT II:\nOutput from an other disk.

From the Window menu select Disk Center and select the disk you want to add a recovery partition to from the list on the left hand side. The tab Recovery Partition on the right hand side should allow you to add the recovery partition.  \nAs already suggested, be sure to have a backup when live repartitioning disks just in case something goes wrong.\n\nA: Manually Cloning a Recovery Partition\nThis process worked for me on an external USB drive, but I don't have a Firewire drive or encrypted partition to test with, but it should work for you.\nRequirements\n\n\n*\n\n*Existing recovery partition on your internal drive (or elsewhere).\n\n*At least 650 MB of free space on your external drive (a previous version of this answer required more space, but I fixed the first section to only use what's required).\n\n\nAdd New Partition\nNotes: this process is not destructive, provided you have sufficient free space on your drive.\n\n\n*\n\n*In Terminal, run diskutil list. You should get output like this:\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *120.0 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh SSD           119.2 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n/dev/disk1\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *320.1 GB   disk1\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk1s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Portable                319.7 GB   disk1s2\n\nMake note of the identifiers for your existing recovery partition (in my case, disk0s3) and the main partition on your external drive (disk1s2).\n\n*Run diskutil info disk1s2 | grep 'Total Size', replacing disk1s2 with the identifier for your external volume. Note the number of bytes listed.\n\n*Run diskutil resizeVolume disk1s2 Xb JHFS+ Temp 650002432b, replacing X with the total number of bytes from step 2 minus 650002432. This will repartition your disk, giving us a new partition with exactly enough space for the recovery partition.  Note: A recovery partition is not always 650002432 bytes.  Find out the exact size by checking diskutil info on the partition you want to copy.\n\n*The resizeVolume command will print out the new partition map (like in step 1), make note of the identifier for the new partition (labelled Temp).\n\n\nClone Existing Recovery to the New Partition\n\n\n*\n\n*Run the following command in Terminal to clone the recovery partition to the new partition, replacing disk0s3 and disk1s3 with the appropriate identifiers for your partitions:\nsudo asr -source /dev/disk0s3 -target /dev/disk1s3 --erase\n\nYou will be asked for your password, and to verify that you want to erase the contents (type y followed by enter), then the cloning process will begin.\n\n*Unmount the recovery partition if it's mounted, then run sudo asr adjust --target /dev/disk1s3 --settype \"Apple_Boot\". Be sure to replace disk1s3 with the appropriate identifier. This sets the proper partition type, which stops OS X from auto-mounting the recovery partition when you attach your external drive.\n\n\nIf everything completed properly, you should have a working recovery partition on your external disk.\n\nA: It's much easier to just use the OS installer you choose and this tool to make Recovery HD (or update existing recovery HD if Apple doesn't when they upgrade the OS itself)\n\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/MagerValp/Create-Recovery-Partition-Installer\nYou can look at the tools and it's been used by many Mac Admins so it gets updated when things break over time quite rapidly.

From exactly the same place in my living room, within seconds of each other, my iPad showed around 6Mb down and my iPhone 5 showed less than half that, around 2.5Mb. \nCan someone suggest why they think this might be?\n\nA: Not knowing what iPad you have, it likely has a different CPU and Wireless chipset. It also could have differing RAM and workloads - although they usually are not a blocking or even major factor in download tests.\n\nA: I'm not sure if it's relative to your problem. But I was experiencing some problems with my iPhone 5 Wifi signal and down performance. I found that some iPhone 5 users were experiencing the same problem, due to a WiFi connection configuration.

What happened? I have a bunch of music I ripped from CD myself. I haven't played all of it recently, mostly listening to my iPhone instead.

How would I get around it, short of re-ripping all those CDs? And is there a way to determine which tracks have been affected short of trying to play every one of my thousands of songs?\n\nA: Here's a workaround, which also makes no sense: as explained at this link, switch iTunes to run in 32 bit mode via the Info box.\nThis doesn't explain parts 1-4, but it does at least make the tracks playable. I'd still love to know what is actually going on.\nAlso, you can enable the \"Kind\" column and sort by it to discover which of your tracks have mysteriously been converted to Quicktime Movies.\n", "Q: What exactly does pressing a character key in a Finder window do? Back when I was a Windows user in another life, I faintly remember a nice shortcut when browsing a directory: type the first letter of the file name you want to be highlighted, and keep pressing to iterate through the rest of the files that start with that letter. So for example if 10 files were listed that all started with the letter 's', I'd just keep pressing 's' to go through each file.\nHowever, something else happens when I do the same in Finder on Mac. It looks like it's almost about to do that same thing Windows does, but when I press 's' repeatedly, it only finds one or two files out of say the 40 I have in the current directory that start with an s. So I'm not exactly sure what kind of behavior that is, if it's a type of shortcut of it's own, but for now it just seems random to me. \nAny idea how to do the Windows-like trick, and what Mac currently does when I try that?\n\nA: I use S to get the first file starting with that letter, then tab repeatedly to step through the rest (and moving on to T when the S's run out).\n\nA: You can still type S to get the first file highlighted, and from this step on, use the tab key ⇥ to go through all files that begin with s, if s runs out, it goes to T section,\n\nA: I believe it allows you to perform two-character combinations to select other files.\nSo typing s - s would select a file starting with ss...\nIf you want to go through the files starting with s I would hit Control-Command-1 to sort by name then hit s once to move down to the s section.\n", "Q: What is the difference between using backup software and copying? I acquired a backup program - SuperDuper! - recently, and ran it, backing up Macintosh HD to another partition. It seems to me like it just copied everything. My question then is: What is the difference between using a backup program and just copying all the files with Finder?\n\nA: There's a difference between backing up files, and making an image of a disk. Perhaps this is the difference you are getting at.\nIf I make a backup of my entire disk, by copying all the files on it, there are a few things that I am missing.\n1) Filesystem metadata. If I copy files from an HFS volume to a FAT32 or NTFS volume, I lose the resource forks from the filesystem\n2) Any boot information. Once I have copied the files from volume A to volume B, I do not have any of the boot information associated with the original volume. So, I cant take that disk, and use it to start up my computer, it just contains a copy of every file that was on the original disk when I made the copy.\nIf you need copies of your documents, then you need backup software. If you need a disk image that you can boot from then you need imaging software.\nSome backup tools do both. The classic unix dd makes a bit-for-bit copy of a disk, and you can deal with the output from it in a number of ways, making it a disk archive swiss army knife.\ndd is a tool that requires that you know all about the source and destination filesystems including things like block sizes and such. It is not for the faint of heart.\nI've never tried, but you might be able to use th Mac OS Disk Utility to create a dmg image, which is something like what you are looking for. Another thing to look at is time machine. Time Machine creates a Sparse Image on volume, it then creates 'bands' (I think that is what they are called) that store the differences in each file from one run to the next.\nYou could use a SparseImage to create images of your disk, which you could then make boot disks from.\nThis is a whole lot of not very accurate technical detail crammed into a small answer. I hope it helps.\n\nA: Superduper!, which I use daily, copies everything (including invisible files) and makes a bootable disk. A Finder copy won't copy invisible files unless you make them visible and it will not make the backup disk bootable.\nBut SuperDuper! really shines the next time you back up if you use its \"smart backup\" feature. It will just copy the changes or added files or delete things that need deleting. In other words it does what's necessary to make the backup an exact clone of the original, which usually doesn't take all that long after the initial backup.\nThe Finder can't do this type of \"smart backup\" as far as I know.\n\nA: It sounds like your app does just copy files across, however it does it in an automated fashion, and may support others... (I've never used it)\nI personally recommend Time Machine as a backup solution for Mac OS X, which is built into every OS since Leopard. Two of the advantages of using Time Machine are, full automation, and Versions.\nOnce setup, Time Machine will be fully automatic. e.g. Plug in your external drive and forget about it for a while and do some other work.\nWith Versions, you are able to browse your backup and view old versions of files that you may wish to revert back to in some circumstances.\n", "Q: if I restore from my cousins backup would it change my iOS?

However, she has Sprint and iOS 5.1.1 and I have AT&T and 6.0.1.\nCould I use her backup to downgrade my iPhone to iOS 5.1.1?\n\nA: No. The back up does not contain the operating system.\n\nA: Unfortunately the backup files only contain personal data, and don't store the iOS version. Apple makes very difficult, if not impossible, in some cases, to downgrade iOS versions.\nHere is some additional information from Apple regarding information that iTunes backs up. \n\niTunes can back up your settings, Messages, Camera Roll, documents, saved games, and other data.

To get your Mac's local IP, open the Network pane of System Preferences. Select your active network on the left and the IP will be shown on the right under the Connected heading. It will probably be something that looks like 10.0.1.1 or 127.0.1.1.\n\nA: In both scenarios, using the IP or machinename.local address of the Mac will only give you the default website on that Mac.  Your web apps are all at the top-level so Nginx is expecting different hostnames in the request.  Problem is, these hostnames end in .localhost which isn't being resolved by DNS, so the iPad doesn't know where myapp2.localhost is, and the request never reaches Nginx on the Mac.   \nYou've already gotten around this problem somehow when testing from the Mac.  Maybe you've edited the /etc/hosts file, or you have a GUI that does that?   However, you can't modify the iPad hosts file without jailbreaking.\nA simple workaround is to change the default website in Nginx to the webapp you want to test from the iPad - then you could use the machinename.local address from the iPad.  But you have to change this every time you want to test a different webapp.\nMore complicated workarounds would be to a) configure Apache on the Mac as a proxy server, and configure the iPad browser to use that as its proxy; b) set up a DNS server on your local network; c) use instead the iPad simulator on the Mac, while modifying the /etc/hosts file; or d) jailbreak the iPad and modify /etc/hosts.\n\nA: You can try to enter your Mac's hostname followed with a .local.\nSo if the name of your computer is epsilon.\n    http://epsilon.local\n\nAs stated by Nathan the ip address would work. Replace my example IP with your actual IP. \n    http://192.168.1.1\n\nYou would add your specific app information at the end of these addresses. So what ever comes after the http://localhost would be appended to the end of these URLs. \n\nA: I think the easiest thing to do is get the hosts IP address. For example, on the command line run this :\ncurl icanhazip.com\n\nYou will get your external IP addres {described below as $IP_ADDRESS}.\nThen on your iPad just point the browser to that IP address:\nhttp://$IP_ADDRESS/\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Turn Web Sharing on:\n\n\n*Put your website inside ~/Sites\n\n*Access via URL as displayed above\n\n", "Q: Is there anything to worry about with time machine on my macbook pro laptop? I have a macbook pro laptop using mountain lion.  I just setup time machine onto a WD My Passport and it worked fine (took about 2 hours over USB 3.0 for 333 GB of stuff).  My question is, given its a laptop, i will not have the external hard drive plugged in all of the time.  Is there anything i need to worry about with regard to Time Machine config, etc given the fact that i won't have it plugged in all of the time.\nIf i skip a backup cycle because the hard drive is not plugged in, does it kick off right when i plug it in or when the next scheduled backup gets kicked off?  Lets say I don't plug in the hard drive for a month.  Does it queue up all of those backups or just start from where I am at when I plug it back in?\n\nA: Time machine keeps a local store of backups if the time machine drive is not available. This is transferred to the backup drive when it is next connected, so you don't even miss an hourly save. You can see these highlighted in a different colour if you enter time machine a few hours after being disconnected from the backup drive. \nSource: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4878\n\nA: If Time Machine misses a scheduled backup, it will start one the next time you plug in the external drive. In my experience it sometimes takes a few minutes before the backup starts. \n", "Q: Where did the /proc directory go in Mountain Lion? I used to find the location of cached flash videos by lsof | grep Flash, the result is something like this\nGoogle 38571 lamnk 74u REG 1,2 156826302 37061768 /Users/lamnk/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Pepper Data/Shockwave Flash/.com.google.Chrome.KNc63e\n\nPepper flash player deleted the files so you can not see or copy them, but the process 38571 still hold the files open. Normally I can save the cached flash video by copying /proc/38571/fd/74 to another location. However on Mountain Lion I find out that /proc is not there anymore!\nIs it possible to get another process to use these file handles and read the files that exist but lack a proper filesystem handle / inode structure? Do I need to configure /proc in 10.8 if the native tools won't work?\n\nA: /proc has never been included in any version of OS X (although Amit Singh wrote a version of procfs for OS X). You should, however, be able to get at it through /.vol instead. First, find the device number for the volume it lives on with something like stat -f%d /Users/lamnk (assuming you don't have your Library weirdly redirected to another volume). Then get its file ID (aka inode number) from the lsof command (370617680 in the example you gave). You can then reach it as /.vol/volumeid/fileid:\n$ stat -f%d /Users/lamnk\n234821716\n$ lsof -c \"Google Chrome\" | grep \"Pepper Data\"\nGoogle 38571 lamnk 74u REG 1,2 156826302 37061768 /Users/lamnk/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Pepper Data/Shockwave Flash/.com.google.Chrome.KNc63e\n$ cp /.vol/234821716/37061768 rawfile\n\nEDIT: Apparently /.vol does not find unlinked-but-open files, even though they still exist on disk.  Unfortunately, this means this trick won't work here. You might be able to do it with Amit Singh's procfs, but I haven't used it so I don't know if it'll do the trick either.\n", "Q: Tab key sometimes fails to autocomplete in Go To Folder… sheets in Mountain Lion I like keyboard navigation, so I frequently use Shift-Command-G to Go to Folder…  when saving files.

OS X Mountain Lion does this natively, but as far as I can tell it's just an image wrapped in a PDF, so text selection, search, and signing the document isn't possible.\nI've tried out the latest free trial of Adobe Acrobat Pro, which has scan to PDF functionality that does precisely what I want. Combined with its ClearScan option I've managed to get pretty decent looking PDFs at a reasonable size that I can search, select text from, and digitally sign. Awesome! Except it costs $199, which is a little steep for very occasional use.\nThat being said, is there anything else out there that has similar functionality at a lower price point? I'm not expecting free. \nOne app that keeps coming up in my search is PDFScanner, which makes the resulting PDF searchable by running it through OCR, but from what I can tell it's the equivalent of Adobe's searchable image format. One important requirement is being able to digitally sign the resulting PDF, but it's not clear if PDFScanner can do this. Text selection is nice but not absolutely necessary.\n\nA: I know of a website that people have used that is supposed to be very good (there is no software to download) and everything is carried out online.

Select \"Back Up.\" Allow it to runs its course.\n  Close iTunes. \nThen put the device into DFU mode:\n1) Power off the device.\n  2) Disconnect it.\n  3) Hold the power button for 2 secs.\n  4) Without letting go of the power button, press and hold the home button for 10 secs.\n  5) Let go of the power button but not the\n  home button for another 10 secs. \nReconnect the device and launch iTunes. It will detect your iPad and\n  inform you it is in recovery mode. From there, it will check for the\n  newest available update (5.1), download it and install it. When that\n  completes, simply restore your device from the backup you made\n  earlier.\n\nBut I was just wondering if after this I would have to jailbreak my iPod again.\n\nA: Yes, if you upgrade, you will have to jailbreak your device again. \nUpdating your device will restore your iPod Touch to its default settings, removing any and all jailbreak apps and cracks. But I've been told that an iOS 6 jailbreak is available so you should be able to do it all over again.\n\nA: Actually go into cydia and download  osupgrade and it will let you upgrade to any ios\n", "Q: Problem Installing Lion on MacBook2,1 using USB I have a Macbook2,1 with 4GB RAM, Intel Core 2 Duo 2GHz and Leopard 10.5.8 and I need to upgrade it to Lion.

I've succesfully built a fusiondrive on my late 2009 iMac (256Gb Samung830+2TB HDD).\nI set the size to 100%, so I have no recovery partion. However when I boot with the option key I get two identical volumes to chose from. Clicking one or the other brings me to the desktop. I've seen this reported elsewhere, but is it normal on a DIY fusion drive? My iMac runs fine and snappier and the drive shows up as one in Disk utility. Could indicate that some kind of special firmware on the SSD is needed to get a \"fully\" functional fusion drive?\n\nA: Fusion Drive utilizes a component of OS X called CoreStorage to work. When you boot your Mac holding down Option, you are booting into a screen running in the low-level EFI environment, before OS X has started. EFI doesn't understand what a home-built Fusion Drive is, but sees two physical drives capable of booting into OS X.\nI'm not sure of the mechanics of why factory-built Fusion Drives in the latest Macs act differently but my guess is that there is a firmware chip of some sort, like you said. Apple is known to put custom firmware on some of their hard drives.\n", "Q: iMac 2012 vs Mac Pro 2008 Is a new iMac 27\" 2012 a viable upgrade compared to my current Mac Pro 2008 (quad core, 2.8Ghz 14GB RAM)? \nI am a professional photographer and my workflow (Lightroom 4.2 +Photoshop CS6) has become increasingly slow over the last year or so. The specs of the new iMac seem promising – although I am a bit skeptical about using an iMac as a workstation. I currently run OS ML and apps off an SSD (128 Gb) and store the LR catalog + RAW files on an internal 2TB 7200 HDD (WD Caviar Black).\nSo, my question is, in theory, will the upgrade to a maxed out iMac provide a significant performance boost?\nThanks!\n\nA: Based upon the specs on Apple's website, a new iMac would provide a significant boost over your older hardware, however whether it's enough to justify it is a personal decision. The new iMac maxed out would have a 3.4 GHz quad-core i7 (turboboost to 3.9) compared to 2.8 quad-core, 32GB 1600MHz DDR3 ram vs 14GB 800 MHz DDR2 (yours also maxes at 32GB), SATA version 3(6GB/s) vs version 2(3GB/s), USB 3.0 vs 2.0, Thunderbolt vs. firewire 800, and increased (depends on your card) graphics performance from the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 680MX. So yes all that will outperform your current Mac Pro in its current arrangement and in a nice compact package with a fancy new 27\" screen. But...\nWhile all this sounds great, it's as far as you can go with it of course. You can upgrade no more past those specs on the iMac unlike the Mac Pro. I'm of the opinion that a refreshed or new Mac Pro is coming soon, so if it was me I would wait if possible. Even it was 6 months or so, I would wait. Only you know what you need however. If those specs seem good enough to you then do it. But if you need to be able to upgrade the graphics card, add a PCI-X card, want more than 32GB of ram in the future, need an optical drive, firewire(maybe), RAID...the list could go on... then waiting for the next Mac Pro is your best bet, but you probably already knew that.\nAnother option is going ahead and buying the iMac how you want it, use it until the next Mac Pro is released, then sell the iMac to recoup some cost after purchasing the new Mac Pro. It's more hassle, but possibly worth it if your current set up just isn't cutting it anymore. And since they both would likely have Thunderbolt, transferring data should be relatively quick.\nAlso...On the topic of upgrading, I'm not sure, but it may be possible that the motherboard of your Mac has an open slot for another Xeon processor (although you'd need a matched pair). So with some work you could potentially upgrade your existing hardware to have 8 cores. Might be worthing looking into...

Does any one know how can I remove items that I never use from the context menu? \ne.g.: Burn \"yadda yadda\" to Disk...\n\n\nA: You can actually remove native MacOS items from the context menu....but unfortunately, it doesn't appear you can remove the ones you indicated above. Regardless, if you want to take a look, head to \nSystem Prefs > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Services\nand then uncheck the items you don't want on the menu.\n\nIt's unfortunate that you can't remove all of them. But it can at least help you get rid of some of the clutter.\n\nA: *\n\n*I have worked out a solution for this that (so far) works for default Finder right menu context items such as Burn to disk and Burn \"^1\"  to disc. This is exactly the goal of OPs request.\n\n*There's another breed of context menu bloat that comes from installing Services in the form of Applescript or executable plugins. \nThose are simple to get rid of. Whatever they're named, just search your disk for that string. i.e. Inject Potatos! service will ultimately be found in a file named Inject Potatos!.<something>. There may be some other shapes and sizes of them but they're the easy problem to solve and out of scope from the OPs post. \n\n*For non-english users: This solution is language agnostic. We take\nadvantage of the localization functions that convert default strings + args into localized strings with expanded variables. \nHow it works explained with a series of wild guesses\nI'm not sure about the Objective-C internals of it, but I suspect something similar to this is whats going on..\nsnprintf(str, 0, \"\", var1, var2, ..);\n\nThere's no format string (i.e. \"\"), so you always end up with str being zero length.\nIf the str is zero length, the localization resolver will walk backwards up the tree to find an ancestor format template that work. As long as you zero out all of the ancestors of that message class - it'll eventually exhaust templates and return a zero-length string to the localization requestor.\nThe context menu renderer recognizes that it's zero length and omits it from the context menu list items and you get a slimmer context menu.\nIMPORTANT\n\n\n*\n\n*If you don't know what you're doing - you could mess up Finder. Use this checklist to verify you've got the kung-fu.\n\n*Be comfortable using the shell \n\n*Know how to use a plaintext editor such as vim, nano, emacs, etc.\n\n*Always backups of any files you edit BEFORE you edit them. \n\n*Make ONE change at a time, kill Finder, verify everything looks good, goto 10. If you make a bunch of changes and it borks things up you'll just have to go revert all your changes anyway. \n\n*I know that NSString formatting is different than C, but if you're not an Objective-C guy, and need to think about it in terms of printf, the following too examples are basically the same for the purposes of this exercise.\n\n\n*\n\n*Obj-C template: \"Throw ^1 into the ^2\"\n\n*printf template: \"Throw %s into the %s\", arg1, arg2.\n\n\nIf you make a modification and after restarting Finder it does't seem to be taking affect - you might be modifying a localization string in some other area than the right-click context menu. Revert your change, restart Finder and try again. If you skip this step you may end up modifying something other than the context-menu and not realize it until days later.\n\n*Understand that this is basically a hack, it may not work the way you want or expect it to. For what it's worth I've been running with these changes (and more) for at least a couple weeks now and have experienced no ill effects. \n\nStock Finder Context Menu Example\nFirst lets look at a 'before' image taken from the OP's post that shows us a typical default Finder context menu full of bloat.\n\nTerrible! \nThe majority of Apple devices don't even ship with DVD burners anymore, yet there's Burn \"^1\" to disc taking up valuable real estate. \nNot to mention the equally useless Quick Look, Duplicate, Make Alias, Copy ^1, etc.\n\nNew Hotness Context Menu\n\n\nStripped down as far as I could get it. Bear in mind, if we were selecting a file we would have the default Open and Open with.. menu items. \n\nYou don't lose anything unless you omit it. \nThings can be made fairly sparse if you wish.\n\nInstructions\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the $LANGUAGE.lproj file you're interested in. In my case I speak English.\n\n*cd /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/Resources/English.lproj\n\n*run plutil -convert xml1 Localizable.strings, to convert Localizable.strings into a plaintext XML plist file \n\n*MAKE A BACKUP OF Localizable.strings. If you mess something up you'll want to be able to revert your changes. \n\n*Open Localizable.strings in a plaintext / code editor (vi, pico, emacs, jed, etc -- TextEdit.app cannot save *.txt files and should be avoided)\nFind the value you want to hide. In my case it was 'Burn \"^1\" to disk' which is key BC50_V2. \n\n    <key>BN50_V1</key>\n    <string>Burn to Disc…</string>\n    <key>BN50_V2</key>\n    <string>Burn “^1” to Disc…</string>\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*My first attempt was to remove the key-value-pair entirely, but this resulted in BC50_V1's string showing up in my menu. \nSome format strings will fall back to more generic templates if they exist. In that case you'll have to zero out multiple values. \nYou can see this behavior with BC50_V2 which falls back to BC50_V1.\nSince I wanted to complete get rid of any Burn... menu entries, I had to zero out BC50_V1 as well. \nThere are other key value pairs that had multiple fallbacks  but they're usually pretty easy to identify as they'll have the same prefix BC50_ and numerically incrementing suffixes _V1, _V2, _V..\n\n*You can annotate your changes by keeping a copy of the original key/value pair XML fragment inside an XML comment. \nI make a copy of the fragment to change, comment out the old fragment with a description and make my modifications to the copy. That way I can easily revert and don't have to use version control or have multiple copies of the file.\n\n<!-- OLD Burn.*to Disc... \n\n    <key>BN50_V1</key>\n    <string>Burn to Disc…</string>\n    <key>BN50_V2</key>\n    <string>Burn “^1” to Disc…</string>\n\n-->\n\n<!-- NEW Burn.*to Disc -->\n<key>BN50_V1</key>\n<string></string>\n<key>BN50_V2</key>\n<string></string>\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If you want to change a string instead of removing it entirely - you can do that too. Variables seem to be accessible using the form ^<number>. Then number represents the nth argument. If you were feeling especially pimpy you could modify Burn \"^1\" to Disc to Archive \"^1\" forever utilizing an optical disk!. \n\n*Save your modifications to disk\n\n*killall -HUP Finder to restart Finder\n\n*open . to open up a Finder window in your current working directory. Right click to open the context menu, verify everything looks good. \n\n*All done! There doesn't seem to be any penalty to keeping the Localization.strings file in the text plist format so you don't need to concern yourself about converting in and out of binary or text formats whenever you make changes. \n\n", "Q: How do I see everything ever installed on my Mac in one place? I install things in all kinds of different ways on my Mac...\nApp Store, DMG's, PKG's, Homebrew, Rubygems, Macports, etc etc.\nIs there an app out there that can show me my entire history of installing things through all these different channels?\n\nA: I'm not sure you'll get everything in one place across so many different installation methods, especially things like Homebrew, Macports and Ruby gems...\nBut for the 'standard' installations, you could check out CleanApp (or various alternatives). It tends to work best if you install it early on, since it monitors installations, but it can also detect, to some extent, what is already installed.\nAnother option would be AppFresh (or various alternatives), though AppFresh has gone commercial now, so no longer free.\nSome of those (or the alternatives linked) should show you a good selection of App Store, manually installed Applications (DMG/PKG/zip) and the like, but I don't think any will go as far as Homebrew, Macports or Ruby.\n\nA: Great question! Go to Apple Symbol>About This Mac>System Report>Software>Installations.\nYou will get a list of all installations.\nNote: The list will NOT include things installed by third party managers (Homebrew/Macports).

Or should I be able to see the blinking light right immediately when I press the two buttons?\n\nA: I would try two things:  \nFirst, make sure the battery in the remote is good.  I know this may sound obvious, but I always try to make sure there are no issues with power or connectivity.  \nSecond, go into System Preferences-->Security & Privacy, and click the lock at the bottom to unlock the \"Advanced...\" button.  \nMake sure the last checkbox (\"Disable remote control infrared receiver\") is unchecked.

Just moved to a new place and so I reinstalled my HTMacMini (2009 nVidia 9400M model) in a slightly different configuration.

I connected to the Mini via screen sharing and everything seemed fine. I rebooted the Mini and while I got a signal on TV, the picture was now flickering pretty regulary (as much as once per second). Again, connecting to it via VNC/screen sharing works fine. Did I screw it all up by not allowing enough ventilation in the new setup? Any way I can diagnose exactly what's going on?

How then do I download embedded files such as Flash Video from a website for offline viewing in Safari 6? Is there a Safari Extension (my Google-fu hasn't turned up anything useful on that front)?\n\nA: Ok, I figured this out last night. Due to a weird flaw in the Inspector, I didn't notice this before.\nIf you intend to download anything loaded via a plugin you must have the inspector open before you have the plugin load the resource. This is easiest when the site does not autoload/play a video or music file. ClickToPlugin is particularly helpful in this regard.\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable the debug menu if you haven't. (Preferences > Advanced)\n\n*Go to the web page of the resource you want. (e.g. http://www.example.com/kittenvideo.html)\n\n*Pull up the inspector. ⌘⌥A now pulls up the Inspector.\n\n*Now load the resource you want to download.\n\n*Back to the inspector, look at the list of files. Look for audio, video, etc under the Other folder.\n\n*Select the resource you want, then look to the right of the window under location and copy the full URL.\n\n*Open the Download window (⌘⌥L)\n\n*Paste the URL in the Downloads window to download.\n\n\nSo now there are just a few extra steps, but the paste to the downloads still works as before.\n", "Q: Purchasing Apple Mac Software: Options Available to the Consumer?

Are there Pros & Cons to Mac App\n  Store purchasing?\n\nI don't know exactly how you would compile those numbers, or if Apple even releases numbers for the Mac App Store, so it's difficult to say how the \"majority\" is sold.\nAs for pros and cons, probably the biggest pro is Mac App Store purchases can be used on any number of Macs that you own (see Apple's FAQ); you don't need to buy additional licenses for each machine as long as it's for personal use. Also, updates are delivered through the store, so you get a notification when updates are available.\nInstalling from the Mac App Store is also presumably more secure because Apple has tested and approved all apps before making them available (and can revoke an app developer's certificate, which is a benefit assuming a rogue app sneaks through, but could also be a negative if they abuse that ability).\n\nDo people still purchase directly from the company website that\n  created the software as an electronic download - I understand most\n  companies offer a free trial (usually 30 days)\n\nWell, sure, why not? There's no requirement that all apps have to go through the Mac App Store. However, the Mac App Store does not offer trials, so you'll need to purchase directly from the developer if you want a trial (assuming they offer one).\n\nDo people still buy \"boxed software\" from retail outlets and online\n  retail stores ?\n\nAgain, sure, of course you can if you want.\n\nIf the software is available via all these routes and maybe purchased\n  in other ways, is there a recommended (instinctive) way or do people\n  just go through the above options and see which turns out to be the\n  cheapest?\n\nI'd say the Mac App Store is the easiest and most straightforward option for most users, since it's integrated right into OS X and updates are delivered automatically.\n", "Q: Can the OS X keychain juggle two accounts for the same site?

The only fix I found(which isn't a fix) is to reopen the file, and not fast forward.\nHave you encounter this problem?\n\nA: Found a partial solution. As it appears, running 'purge' command from the terminal fixes the problem. This is not the ultimate solution(), but it gets the job done. \nAlso I should note that another fix might be to use CMD + T(Trim) - I've heard it helps, but I usually use Quicktime to watch videos online, which this feature is not available when streaming videos.\nCheers.\n", "Q: Configure your mail with mail.app on Mountain Lion I have Macbook Air 2012 model (128 GB SSD) with Mountain Lion (10.8.2) and I am having difficulties trying to configure the mail.app. When I first tried to set-up my gmail account it started to sync my Macbook with my whole gmail account which is very huge (about 10 GB). Is there any way not to sync whole mailbox? Given the limited capacity of SSD I wanted to have something like we have on an iPhone where for instance only 1000 (or less) of emails messages would be stored locally. \n\nA: I suppose that most of the space required by your mails is due to the attachments.

While a similar question was raised here, it doesn't seem to be a solid answer but more of a theory. In addition my case is a bit different as you will see below.\n\nYou will note that I have two home drives, one being a mount to a share on my NAS and the other in question being the one within localhost.\nWhat value do the home and net drives within localhost serve other than being part of default *nix folder structure? Is this anything more than a local representation that exists by *nix default? Is it safe to eject these drives or is the OS using them in some fashion which may not be readily apparent?\n\nA: The whole \"root\" directory you picture, and finder shows actually does not exist at all. It's kind of a \"meta\" directory. The unix root directory (e.g. /) points to the folder OS X calls \"Macintosh HD\". Everything is a sub-directory of that, even other drives. \nBasically, when you connect a external drive, insert a CD, mount a DMG, or map a network drive, the resources contained within the new drive are actually made available (called \"mounting\") as a subdirectory of /Volumes/[Drive name here].\nFinder (and finder only) has a facility that shows a fake-directory that contains all the mounted drives. \nIn other words, the reason you can have two home directories is because they're not actually in the same folder. One is actually located at /Volumes/home and the other is /home.\nAnyways...\n\nThe home and net directories actually exist as folders on your main drive. If you open the root directory of your drive (IN your picture, its labeled \"Macintosh HD\"), you'll see where they are actually located.\nThe home directory seems to be related to enterprise environments, where various network drives can be defined using a directory service. I believe that, in such a situation, the automounted drives appear in /home/[Network drive name], rather then the OS X traditional /Volumes/[Drive name]. In any event, it's part of the autofs underpinnings of OS X. More here.\nThe /net directory also seems to be related to the automounter. There is a thread about it on the apple support forums here.\n\n/net is built into the automounter in OS X and uses the special map\n  -hosts. This built in map will consist of the exports from the named server, when that server is accessed via the /net path. For example,\n  if I have an NFS server at the IP address 192.168.1.10 and it exports\n  a directory /exports, then if I do this from my Mac:\nprompt$ cd /net/192.168.1.10/exports\nthe Mac automounter will contact the server, mount the export, and put\n  me in that directory. All without me having to issue any \"mount\"\n  command.\n\nAs such, it may be possible to use the /net directory as a shortcut to access network drives, assuming you're working from the command line. It doesn't seem to work for SMB (i.e. windows) shares (at least for me), though.\nIncidentally, if you want to look at what's mounted where, all you have to do is open a command-prompt, and type mount. It will return a list of all the drives your computer has, and where they are mounted.\n", "Q: Safari 6 “Debug” menu: explain choices? There are certain menu items in the Safari 6 Debug menu which I want to understand.  \nFirst, I’ll list the menu items; then, the information I would like to know for each of the items; and finally, I’ll post screenshots of the Debug menu and its submenus for context.\n\nSpecific menu items I’m interested in:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Buffered Windows\n\n*Use Single-process Windows\n\n*All items under Drawing/Compositing Flags ►\n\n*All items under Miscellaneous Flags ►\n\nWanted Information\n\n\n*\n\n*what the menu item does\n\n*use cases where it would help performance\n\n*use cases where it would hinder performance\n\n*use cases where performance would probably not be affected\n\n\n\nScreenshots of the Debug Menu\nScreenshots from Safari 6.\n\n\n*\n\n*Debug:\n\n*(submenu) Drawing/Compositing Flags ►:\n\n*(submenu) Miscellaneous Flags ►:\n\nA: Use Buffered Windows :  \nfor each window, there will be another window that is off screen. The reason for this is that when the window the user is interacting with needs updating (ie, you move the mouse over the window) the WindowServer simply needs to copy the damaged region from the offscreen window and blast it over to the visible one. Similarly when the content of your window changes, applications are only supposed to update the region that changed. This drawing is performed on the buffer, which then is copied over to the 'visible' window. \nUse Single-process Windows:\n\n\nputs all open tabs inside a single safari proccess instead of several ones.\n", "Q: Images centered on safari Is there a way (preferably stable —doesn't matter if it's difficult to configure— but you forget about it once done) to make Safari displaying images centered?\nI mean, if you are viewing an image www.blah.blah/blah.png (or .jpeg, or .svg, or any image), Safari aligns it at the left top corner. I would like it to be centered on the screen. Is that possible?\n\nA: Building on lhf’s comment above, when you view an image in Safari it’s actually still HTML under the surface, so it’s possible to apply a custom stylesheet. This style declaration should do what you want. I've tested it in Safari 6.\nhtml > body > img:first-child:last-of-type { display: block; margin: 0 auto; }\n\nYou'll need to save that line as a file with the extension ‘.css’, then choose it via Safari's Preferences → Advanced → Style sheet setting.\nHere's the logic I used to come up with the code.\n\nIf there is an <img> element that is:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*a direct child of a <body> element, which is itself a direct child of an <html> element\n  \n*the first element within the <body> element\n  \n*the last element of that type (i.e. <img>) within the <body> element\n  \n  \n  …then center it by setting the side margins to be calculated automatically.\n\nIt's very unlikely (though not impossible) that you could encounter a page with only one image on it that happens to be the first element on the page, in which case this rule would also apply. Other than that it should work as you intend.\n\nA: great inspiration. There is no functional plugin for the latest Safari and I really need it. I need the image centered vertically too, so I modified the above solution to: \nhtml > body > img:first-child:last-of-type {\n  position: fixed; /* works with absolute */\n  top: 50%;\n  left: 50%;\n  transform: translate(-50%, -50%); /* translateY(-50%) */\n  max-width: 90%; /* related to it's container, not necessary, works with fixed */\n  max-height: 90%; /* related to it's container, not necessary, works with fixed */\n}\n\n\nA: in other words Safari sucks. I've tried using CSS to center and image both vertically and horizontally in Safari and it doesn't work in a responsive site. It will however work in FF, IE, Opera, and Chrome just fine. Well, actually you can statically center an image in Safari, but it will not be able to be responsive and scale with the window size and still be compatible with other browsers.. \nIf you want to generically center an image you don't want to scale, you can use the following css:\nWe will pretend the image is 200wx100h pixels\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n    .exactCenter {\n        height:100px\n        width:200px;\n        position: fixed;\n        top:50%;\n        left:50%;\n        margin-left:-100px;\n        margin-top:-50px;\n    }\n\nThe margins left and right are a minus half the width and height of your image. the Html in the Body would be placed in a div with the class (.exactCenter):\n<div class=\"exactCenter\"><img src=\"img/your image.jpg\" name=\"Logo\" width=\"100%\" id=\"Centered Image\"></div>\n\nThis should work in Safari for centering an image on screen both horizontally and vertically. \n", "Q: Resetting Mountain Lion iCloud login request The first time you log into a new account with Mountain Lion, a special iCloud login screen is shown. Once you \"skip\" this screen it is never shown again.\nWhen setting up an account I like to add a few things (like a welcome note of my own). But I'd also like to leave the iCloud login screen intact for the first time the intended user logs in.\nIs there any way to reset this login screen so that it will be presented on the next attempt to login to a given account?\n\nA: If all you want to do is add some files to the user's desktop or documents folder, you can create the account in system preferences, then add these files to the relevant directories by navigating to the user's home folder in Finder ( /Users//Desktop ) without logging in at all. The user will then be prompted to setup iCloud the first time they log in.\n", "Q: Why is the folder in ~/Library/Application\\ Support called \"Avian\" for Textmate 2?

It looks like some developer hardcoded his name into the bundle's path for development and forgot to change it back.\nEven if you read instructions about this in a blog post, you would assume that \"Avian\" is just the author's name.\nFor everyone who doesn't know this, it is just confusing.\n\nA: It also caused a bug with the theme files. My code folding icons vanished in the gutter. I removed textmate then re-installed. This fixed the issue until I closed textmate and opened it again. The fix was to remove this folder before installing textmate again.\n", "Q: Can the now expired iMessage app still work with Lion? I want to use iMessage on an old Macbook which cannot be upgrades past OS X 10.7.  Apple provided an iMessage beta software, but it has expired and no longer functions. I'm wondering whether there is any way to keep using the iMessage service on the Lion OS?\n\nA: No one has come forth with a hack or modification to get it working. The longer it takes, the less likely someone will want to release a patch since the audience for this shrinks as people upgrade and move on to Mountain Lion.\n\nA: As on my own experience, the version you're talking about was very buggy and Apple did change a lot regarding iMessage on the new OS.\nIt most likely will use other protocols or URLS to communicate with, and as it have been replaced by a full (working) version it's no worth to anyone to attempt and hack it.\nSo in short: No, you can't do this. But you might be able to put Mountain Lion on your older Macbook.\n", "Q: How to use my phone number on my Macbook's Messages? iMessage is very confusing as my email and phone number keeps receiving different messages at random occasions rather than having all messages sent to both. This is very apparent in  group messages.\nI would like to use my phone number, is this possible ?\n\nA: Yes - it's entirely possible to have your Mac send and receive iMessage using your iPhone's message as the \"caller ID\" only.\nSetting this up is normally a two step process.\nFirst ensure that your phone with the number you wish all computers to use as your \"caller ID\" for the Mac has your Apple ID enabled for Messages. Until that device has activated the phone number to your Apple ID account, you can't go to step two.\nNext, in the preferences on your Mac, look at the bottom of the pane for that Apple ID and choose to send a message from your Phone number rather than from the Apple ID mail address.\n\nI prepared that picture for another answer and you might read there in case things are not working. I find it best to set each and every device to send from the same one string - whether it's a string of phone digits or a string of email address to avoid having people reply to your non-preferred account. In that case, you can either deal with two conversations or train them to send to your preferred address. It's a bit of tough love, but the most effective way is to only accept messages from your preferred string and then send read receipts. That way people realize some messages do not get delivered and self correct.\nApple has a nice article that covers how things are supposed to work as well as what to do when things don't.\n\n\n*\n\n*iOS: About Messages\n\n*iOS: Troubleshooting Messages\n\n*iOS: Troubleshooting FaceTime and iMessage activation\n\nA: I found that by unchecking the box 'enable this account' under my apple ID account and then rechecking it, the messages app registered my phone number as an option for sending and receiving. \n\nA: The steps above are accurate, but only if your phone has allowed your mac as a device (see image below). \nSo connect to your wifi on your phone and follow the steps below. Then your mac will provide your phone number as an option where you can be reached for messages (as the answer above depicts). \nThankfully this thread helped me to figure out that the issue was with my phone first and not my mac. \n\n", "Q: Why does the main OS menu bar disappear when I am in Safari? I am running OS X 10.8.2 on a MacBook Pro with a 27\" Cinema Display. Just this week I noticed that when I switch over to Safari the Main Menu Bar (not the Safari menu bar) disappears. I have checked to make sure that I am not in full screen mode. I also checked the desktop settings and don't see anything that would turn that off. The menu bar shows when I am in any application other than Safari. Again, this is the main menu bar, not the safari menu bar.\nThanks in advance for any help.\nScreenshot:\n\n\nA: Strange I am having same issue when I log in. But changing desktops a few times solves the issue. So I think its a graphic bug\n\nA: I have also experienced this. What I found out was that it was as a result of dual display when I connected my MAC to my TV and used Safari in full-screen mode on the TV. I experienced Menu Bar disappear when I launch Safari after disconnecting from my TV.\nWhat I did to resolve the issue was to re-connect to TV and quit Safari while it was in full-screen mode (on the TV), and then relaunch the application.\n\nA: You may be in full screen mode.

Click anywhere on your desktop to induce the Finder menu bar to appear.  Then click anywhere on your Safari window and the Safari menu bar will appear.  Works every time - only 2 clicks! \n\nA: I'm not sure why this happens but I understand exactly what you mean.  \nIt isn't an issue of having inadvertently hid the toolbar like a fool.  I think it may be the thing that asks you if you would like the window to remain in full screen after you minimize a full screen video in Netflix, Amazon or whatever video you're watching that requires silverlight.  \nI found a solution:\nOn the control bar where the Safari icon is located, completely close out of Safari.  When you open it back up, the toolbar reappears and stays whilst browsing.  \n\nquit down here and reopen\nIt took some digging to find that answer but it seems to be working.  The quick fix did mention that it is a temporary thing so I assume it develops again after a fullscreen video is played in silverlight with that weird prompt.\n", "Q: How can I permanently dismiss Updates Available notifications? With the Notification Center in Mountain Lion, I get an alert when software updates are available. The problem is, my only options are 'Details' and 'Update'. I don't want to interrupt my work to install the update and I don't want to launch the App Store to see what the update it. I just want to dismiss the alert so that it doesn't come back again. I know about the tip that swiping the notification off the side of the screen to make it go away, but it seems to come back a few minutes later.\nI've looked in the System Preferences to change it to a 'banner' instead of an 'alert' so that it would go away by itself after a few seconds, but there is no option to control software update notifications. I've also closely read these two related questions and can't seem to make the answers there work for me to suppress repetitive update notifications.\nI can turn off software updates all together, but I'm not really against the update notifications -- as long as I can acknowledge it and not have it bother me again.\nIs there a hidden configuration option that I can invoke to control these notifications from re-appearing?\n\nA: I have just disabled checking for updates automatically from System Preferences:\n\nI install updates manually from App Store or with sudo softwareupdate -ia.\n\nI tried adding this command to the root's crontab (and not restarting after updates):\n0 14 * * * /usr/sbin/softwareupdate -ia\n\nI didn't have any issues at first, but after the 10.8.3 update, Safari started crashing on launch until I restarted.

Perhaps someone with more knowledge could poke around and find out more.\n\n\nA: ckoerner was on the right path. This is a bit technical, but I've been blessedly free from the 10.8.3 update notice all day.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to ~/Library/Application Support/NotificationCenter\n\n*Figure out which .db file is the newest.\n\n*Open that file in Terminal with sqlite3: sqlite3 LONG_FILE_NAME.db\n\n*Type select app_id from app_info where bundleid = 'com.apple.appstore'; and then hit return.

I running OS X 10.6.8 on a Mid-2009 MacBook Pro. I would like to standardize the size of icons seen in Finder (I use Icon View). Currently, every folder has its own icon size, which makes it less comfortable to use. I am tired of trying to \"guesstimate\" using the icon slider. Ideally, I would like to either revert all folders to default sizing, or be able to specify, for example, 48px.\nI would also like to, if possible, revert the dock to default icon size (or at least be able to specify by pixel, and desktop icons also.\nIs there an easy way to do this?\n\nA: You can change the default size in the view options panel:\n\nThe sizes of icons are also stored in .DS_Store files that override the default setting. You can delete them by running sudo find / -name .DS_Store -delete, but it also resets other display options and removes Spotlight comments. The changes aren't always picked up until you quit and reopen Finder.\n\nA: I don't know if I understood you correctly but:\nBy choosing Show View Options from the View menu, ( or just doing Command+J ) you can, precisely, specify the icon's size in pixels. And, if not in the desktop but in a folder, you can set this size as default.\n\nAlso, under ~/Library/Preferences you can find the Dock's preferences. At the end of the file, you can find its size in pixels. Although I expected that editing the file and reloggin to do the trick, it, instead, created a new preferences file, so it was a lot easier just to change the value on the slider (under System Preferences / Dock) and checking its numerical value on the file. \n\n", "Q: Unexpected behaviour when using 'Center' option for the desktop wallpaper in Mountain Lion In Mountain Lion (10.8.2) the 'Center' option does not scale and centre wallpapers correctly.\nThe preview is correct, but the wallpaper is the same as 'Fit to Screen'.\nAll other options work as expected.\nDesktop with 'Center':\n\nDesktop with 'Fit to Screen':\n\nThe screen resolution is 1024x768 and the image size is 3200x2000.\nShouldn't the 'Center' option display the centre of the image at 100% zoom? Is there any way to change this behaviour?\n\nA: I think they're working as expected. Center puts the image at the middle of your screen, without changing the aspect ratio (an image larger than your screen will be downscaled, but a smaller one won't be upscaled). Because your screen is a 4:3 ratio, and the wallpaper is 16:10, you get blue bars filling the rest of the space. Similarly, Fit to Screen scales the image proportionately so that width matches that of your screen, but it does not change the aspect ratio, which is why you still have blue bars.\nIf you want the image to take up all of your screen without any blue bars, try the Fill Screen or Stretch to Fill Screen options. Fill Screen scales the image proportionately so that it fills the entire screen, and Stretch to Fill Screen scales the image to fill the screen, but changes the aspect ratio so the entire image is on-screen (i.e. you don't lose any of the image boundaries).\n\nA: This is a known bug. It should center the image to the center of the screen keeping its aspect ratio and no resizing. We can only wait for this bug to be fixed.\n\nA: This bug seems to have reappeared in El Capitan 10.11.3, but only for secondary screens. \nReally annoying.\n", "Q: How can you send the same text to multiple people without it being a group message?

How can this be accomplished on the iPhone 4S (with or without jailbreak applications, such as biteSMS) with iOS 5.1.1?\nThe reasons that I would not want it treated as a group message are:\n\n\n*\n\n*I do not want the recipients to see the numbers of other recipients\n\n*I do not want the recipients' replies to go to multiple people\n\n*I do not want the recipients' replies to be grouped in a group message, but to instead be part of each individual thread\n\n*depending on the message, I may specifically not want a given recipient to know that other recipients received the same message.\n\n\nOptimally, the solution would also allow pictures to be attached and would automatically send iMessages instead of text messages to iOS users - but those parts are less important than being able to send plain text messages.\n\nA: The option you're looking for is located at Settings > Messages > Group Messaging. Turning this off will send all messages individually to their recipients.\nNote: Disabling MMS Messaging will remove the Group Messaging toggle from the list.\nNote: Some cellular service providers do not support Group Messaging, so if you have MMS enabled, and you still don't see Group Messaging, then it's likely that your provider does not support it. From Apple: If you don't see an option to turn on MMS Messaging or Group Messaging on your iPhone, contact your carrier.\n\n\nA: If you have a Mac you can use https://porterhouse.app which lets you do that with a single click, and sends as iMessage to iOS users too\n", "Q: Is wifi on when the iPhone is idle? I have an iPhone 5 with iOS 6.0.1. Whenever I resume the phone from idle, I see \"LTE\" quickly change to the wifi icon in the status bar. This makes me believe that wifi is off when the phone is idle. Is this also true when I have Pandora playing music and I power off the screen? I have a limited data plan and would like wifi to be on when the screen is off.\n\nA: In general, it's up to the App to detect and decide not to use cellular data over Wi-Fi data and you are correct, that in absence of a process actively using Wi-Fi - it goes asleep. Even if the app prefers Wi-Fi - there can be a burp where it drops signal or sync with the base station and falls over onto cellular.\nYou can test an app quite easily by pulling the SIM card and seeing how it behaves as the device goes to sleep. I don't use pandora - but most apps that stream also have a setting to avoid cellular usage if they don't pause the stream when a networking change is detected.\n\nA: The WIFI radio only stays on for a limited time (perhaps 10 to 30 minutes max) after the display locks (goes dark) to save battery power.  This is usually done automatically by the OS, and not dependent on the last app run.  If you want to avoid cellular data usage for longer periods of sleep, your best bet is to just turn off cellular data until after you wake up the device, when the device will turn back on power to the WIFI radio.\n", "Q: A Space just for an App Is there a way (perhaps using a third-party app) to make one of my Spaces permanently locked to a single app (in this case, TextEdit)?\nI want to have all my TextEdit windows and nothing else in one Space, at all times.  I never want TextEdit to open windows anywhere besides my TextEdit-dedicated Space.\n\nA: In 10.7 and up, you can assign apps to Desktops. To assign an app, Control+click the app's Dock icon, navigate to Options and then choose to assign it either to All Desktops, This Desktop or None. \nAll Desktops assigns the app to be open on whatever Desktop you switch to. If you have it open on Desktop 1, and switch to Desktop 2, it will appear to not have moved. \nThis Desktop assigns the app to a specific Desktop, and force it to always open there. This is the option I would try to accomplish your goal. \nNone is the default setting, and leaves the app unbound by any Desktop-specific rules. \n", "Q: using multiple emails in the mail app and sending texts to that app as well the question is almost identical to the title: i just got an iPhone 5, coming over from a blackberry. on my blackberry i was able to receive all my text messages and emails from both of my accounts (one personal gmail, and one work email address) in one app. is there a way to do this on the iPhone?\n\nA: No. All SMS, MMS and iMessages are all collected in Messages.app. All email is, by default, put in Mail.app. There isn't any built-in way to merge the two. \nThat being said, there is some flexibility to view multiple inboxes in Mail.app. While in Mail.app, go back to Mailboxes screen and select All Inboxes. You will see all the email messages from all of your accounts in a unified view. \n", "Q: iOS-style PageCapture app for OSx? I like the iOS PageCapture here. I want to find it for Desktop. Where can I find such whole-browser-page-screenshotting app for OSx?\n\nA: Paparazzi isn't a good app. I used it and it didn't work or was very slow to load.\nI use a lot Layers Shot and W3Capture, they save the multiple pages or sites and also capture ones whole pages. Layers save as PDF, PNG, TIFF or PSD file. W3Capture, as PDF (separated pages) and PNG (one whole page). I also used a lot Web Slices (free), a sites sncreenshot app.\nGo to the Mac App Store, search the apps and follow the apps:\n(I can't pots more than two hyperlinks)\n1) Layers Shot\n2) Web Slices\nOut of Mac App Store, W3Capture's link: http://www.bitsdujour.com/software/wcapture/\nMore apps that I didn't test yet:\nLightshot Screenshot (it's in Mac App Store and it is free)\nI hope this answer help you. Good luck with these apps!\n\nA: Check out Paparazzi!. It sounds like that's what you're looking for.\n\nA: If you don't want to use OSx apps, go with your browser -- use Awesome Screenshot Capture -plugin in Chromium here. It has also annotating -features.\n", "Q: Can't erase Time Machine partition Error message \"could not unmount disc\"\nOnly tried Time Machine one day with new Snow Leopard install on MBP.  Have been happy with CCC & want to use the space for a bootable CCC clone.\nTime Machine won't let go of the space!!!\n\nA: If there is nothing else on this particular hard drive that you wish to keep, you can pick the \"Partition\" section in Disk Utility and repartition the whole drive to your liking rather than simply delete the Time Machine partition. You may have more luck with this than with editing the existing partitions. However, given that it's telling you it can't unmount the disk, Disk Utility may not let you do this either. You can most likely get around this by booting from your Snow Leopard installation DVD and using Disk Utility to repartition the external drive (careful, not your internal drive!) from there. Using the recovery system on the Snow Leopard DVD will avoid anything (like Time Machine) keeping the disk \"busy\" when you want to partition it.\n", "Q: How can I erase the data from my Macbook without losing my recent OS? I'm going to sell my Macbook Pro and want to remove all of the data before doing so. I have the OS Lion installed but my machine came with Snow Leopard. How can I remove everything and restore it to basically just the OS without losing Lion? I want to sell the machine with Lion. Thanks.\n\nA: Apple provides instructions on erasing and reinstalling OS X, so the system will be as it was when it came from the factory: http://support.apple.com/kb/PH4439\nThese instructions guide you through reformatting the drive and reinstalling OS X via Recovery.\n\nA: You can reinstall like cablesm suggested and it will have Lion installed but you have to understand that you do NOT sell Lion with it unless you have a bought Lion USB Stick cause Lion is hard bundled with YOUR AppleID and you can not sell it or move it to another AppleID!\nTherefore I would sell it with Snow Leopard preinstalled.\nHere are instructions copied straight from http://support.apple.com/kb/PH6522\nTo erase and reinstall Mac OS X Snow Leopard:\n\n*\n\n*Insert the Mac OS X installation disc into your computer’s optical drive (or an optical drive connected to your computer), and then double-click the Install Mac OS X icon.\n\n\n*In the Installer, click Utilities, and then click Restart.\n\n\n*When the Language Chooser appears, select your language, and then click the Continue button (looks like an arrow).\n\n\n*In the Installer, choose Utilities > Disk Utility.\n\n\n*Select your startup disk from the list on the left, and then click the Erase tab.\n\n\n*From the Format pop-up menu, select Mac OS Extended (Journaled), type a name for your disk, and then click Erase.\n\n\n*After the disk has been erased, choose Disk Utility > Quit Disk Utility, and then follow the instructions in the Mac OS X Installer to reinstall Mac OS X.\n\nA: You may also be able to take the Mac into the Apple store and have a Genius clean wipe and install up to the latest OS for you.\n", "Q: Repair Permissions messed up network preferences I ran repair permissions a few days ago, because other accounts on my computer couldn't open system preferences (this problem persists, but I don't care about it very much). What does bother me, however, is that it seems to have messed up numerous network permissions.\nSpecifically,\n\n\n*\n\n*My home network is no longer recognized as a \"preferred network.\" When I wake from sleep, my home network is in the list directing me to select a different network. When I direct the computer to join my network, it says \"a connection timeout occurred\" and then joins anyways. This does not happen on the campus wireless network.\n\n*I can no longer connect to my campus VPN. I get an error that the \"shared secret\" is not available. When I enter the shared secret and apply in network preferences, the shared secret is cleared.\n\n\nI have already deleted and recreated my login keychain. And as repairing permissions got me into this place, I don't feel it is my way out.\n\nA: Since several files appear to be either missing or corrupt, now might be a good time to check that you have a good backup of your data and then see about booting to a Recovery HD or other bootable media and seeing if the disk catalog itself needs repair.\nYou might also have a technician look at the hard drive if there are lots of problems with the disk. Most can be fixed by wiping the drive and then reinstalling the OS and finally restoring your applications and files from a backup. Of course, corrupt files like you are seeing in the network preferences could get backed up in a poor state - so you might still need to find and clean things one by one, but hopefully this is the extent of the problems.\n", "Q: How do I make the hard drive visible in the Finder? On OS X Lion I don't see the hard drive in the Finder and I seem to have no permission to create a folder under / from terminal.\nI know I can do this if I activate the root user, but I need to be able to see the directories I have created under / in the Finder. \nHow can I be able to make my main hard drive visible in the Finder?\n\nA: This was troubling me for a while on my wife's computer. I had everything checked in preferences and it still wasn't showing up.\nThen I found that if you rollover Devices on the sidebar in the Finder window, there's a little Show and Hide that pops up.\n\nA: *\n\n*While in the Finder, go to the \"Finder\" menu and select \"Preferences\".\n\n*From the \"General\" tab, place a check next to \"Hard disks\" -- this will make your hard drive visible on the Desktop.\n\n*From the \"Sidebar\" tab under \"Devices\" again place a check next to \"Hard disks\" -- this will put your hard drive in the sidebar of any finder window, and should also add it to \"Open\", \"Save\", and \"Save As...\" dialog sheets (as well as others)\n\n\nIf you are an administrator on the computer you should have no trouble adding files and folders to the root directory (/)\n\nA: Launch Finder then just press shift + command + C.\nThis is effectively like ‘My Computer’ in Windows. It will give you a list of all the connected drives on your Mac, both internally and externally connected drives as well as Network drives.\n\nA: *\n\n*While in the Finder, go to the \"Finder\" menu and select\n\"Preferences\".\n\n*Add the name of your MacBook to the Sidebar.\n\n*Click on the name of your MacBook and drag your hard drive or\nuntitled to the Sidebar.\n\n", "Q: Can I assign a language for each iMessage contact? I write iMessages in different languages, depending on who the message goes to. Text input is very difficult if auto-completion/correction is using the wrong dictionary. Is there a way to assign a language for my contacts, so that iMessage will pick that up? Or if not, is there at least a quick way (without leaving the app) to switch languages manually?\n\nA: I don't think automatic switching is available at the moment but a quick way to switch manually without leaving the app is to enable multiple keyboards. You can do this is Settings -> General -> Keyboards. \nYour keyboards will now have a globe button next to the 123 button to enable fast switching by tapping the globe and you can hold it down and select the desired language :)\nHaving the keyboard in a different should change the dictionary and autocorrect features automatically. \nHope this helps\n", "Q: Are there any apps or tools that allow visualizing multitouch finger positions for iOS screencast/recording? I'd like to have a visual indicator of multitouch finger positions as I record the iOS screen of an iPad using AirPlay. \nThis seems like something that would require a jailbreak. Luckily I do have my iPad JB'd but my searches have not turned up anything. \n\nA: I needed the same and searched a lot. In my opinion there are three solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Live capture of the gestures one does on your iPad (not professional)\n\n*Using a PNG of a pointing arm (hand) in ScreenFlow (or Camtasia).\nThis works quite well. One can tweak the png a bit (X,Y,Z-coordinates) and with adding video actions it comes to live. It is elaborate though, but with some patience and expertise quite professional.\n\n*Buying a M4A or MOV of finger gestures.\nHave a look at VideoHive's Touch Screen Finger Gestures for example.\nYou can purchase them with an alpha channel to incorporate in the screencast. Didn't try that one, but seems the most professional to me. Some costs involved though.\n\nA: Touchpose\nTouchpose is a very simple Cydia tweak that will show finger positions on screen.\n\n\nRequirements: firmware (>= 4.0), mobilesubstrate, libactivator, preferenceloader\n\nA: You can use iOS for all format\nafter effects templates\n", "Q: Switching from a Mac Mini HTPC to an Apple TV: what solution for watching these mkv files? I use a 2009 Mac Mini. I almost thought it had died but false alarm. Regardless, it got me thinking about the future. I currently use my Mac Mini to, in no particular order:\n\n\n*\n\n*watch the occasional DVD (no longer Netflix but RedBox from time to tie)\n\n*stream TV shows from Hulu, Netflix\n\n*download stuff via torrent\n\n*watch said stuff via VLC (it's usually a mix of mp4 and mkv)\n\n*do some web browsing \n\n\nClearly if I move to the Apple TV, torrenting is off, but that can be done via another computer. DVD watching is not a big deal and could be replaced by iTunes or Amazon rental, and rip some of my own DVDs. The biggest problem is how to watch the stuff on the Apple TV. If I attach a drive to my Airport extreme, any chance I can stream at least the MP4 to the Apple TV? Any chance to Airplay from another computer using VLC? Will this be solved when Apple opens up the Apple TV to developers (VLC,Plex)? Can these be installed on a jailbroken ATV? It looks like it for Plex. Anyone has any experience with it?\n\nA: I'd recommend the Plex approach, not the Airplay solution.  If you can handle the jailbreak (ATV2 only!), it's the best approach out there for non-iTunes movies on your ATV.  And, I hate to say it here, consider the Roku, which is really cheap, officially supports Plex, and should be able to play anything you throw at it.\n", "Q: How do I add icons to my menu bar? I would like to know how I could add a USB eject button or battery power indicator to my menu bar on Mac OS X. I remember going into my Macintosh hard drive but I can't remember which folder to find it in. I know to drag out an item from the menu bar by pressing the command key and at the same time dragging the icon onto the desktop, but how do you add icons to it?\n\nA: I'm assuming by \"desktop toolbar\", you mean the bar at the top of the screen (properly called the menu bar), please correct me if I've made the wrong assumption.\nYou can add the eject item by opening /System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/ in Finder, and double-clicking the file named Eject.menu. It should appear in the menu bar right away.\nTo add the battery indicator, open the Energy Saver pane of System Preferences, and check the Show battery status in menu bar box, near the bottom of the window.\n", "Q: Strange Freeze on My MacBook Pro 15.4\" 2.0GHZ (A1150 / MA600LL) & No Sound After Boot I have a MacBook Pro 15\" A1150 (MA600LL) that will not boot except in safe mode.  It gets almost all of the way through the boot then freezes with two vertical checkerboard lines and the trackpad-controlled pinwheel for a cursor.  \nAlso, the chime works at the beginning, but after boot in ANY mode the sound preference pane says there is no sound output device.  \nWhat should I do?\nRegards,\nDon\n\nA: Schedule an appointment with the genius bar and bring it to them. At the very least they'll be able to run you the diagnostic tools and tell you what the problem is.\nMy experience is these sorts of problems usually result in a pretty expensive repair bill, unless you happen to be still covered under apple care support.\nLogic board probably has some sort of damage. \n", "Q: Messages taking a long time to appear When I receive a message there will immediately be a notification, however when opening the Messages app, the message will usually take about 5 seconds before it appears.\nIf there a known issue with the OS or a quick fix for this issue?\n\nA: iMessage and iCloud have lots of issues with delivery, sync, and reliability. There's no fix, but you can always write feedback to Apple or file a bug report (free developer account required).\n", "Q: Automator & AppleScript: How do I import the texts of Notes and Reminders as PDFs and RTFs? I would like to export and save the Notes and Reminders documents or texts as PDFs and RTFs, keeping or preserving the formatting and the background of Notes or Reminders, but the Notes doesn't have the option.\nI would like to know if it's possible to use Automator and AppleScript to export the Notes and Reminders as PDFs and RTFs.\n\nA: Another way to export notes is to move them to an email account first. For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move notes to a Gmail account in Notes.app\n\n*Move the notes to some other folder in Gmail's web interface\n\n*Select the notes in Mail.app and save them as rich text or plain text\n\n\nHere is another AppleScript for exporting notes as RTF:\nset i to 1\ntell application \"Notes\"\n    repeat with n in notes\n        do shell script \"printf %s \" & quoted form of (get body of n) & \" | textutil -inputencoding UTF-8 -format html -convert rtf -stdin -output /tmp/\" & i & \".rtf\"\n    set i to i + 1\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nIt doesn't keep images, and it doesn't work with notes that are longer than getconf ARG_MAX. -inputencoding UTF-8 is required for preserving U+100 and characters above it.\n\nA: The simplest way to get a note into PDF format is to use OS X's built-in Print to PDF function. Just select the note you want, open the print dialog, click the PDF button in the lower left corner, and select Save as PDF.\nIf you want to script/automate it, you can either do some GUI scripting to Automate the PDF printing process (which is a bit clunky, but there are many examples of how to do this around), or you can get the note text as HTML via AppleScript and convert it to RTF. Note that in either case, you just get plain text, the legal paper style of Notes is part of the GUI, not the note format.\nIf you want to get the text of a note in RTF, you can use this AppleScript:\ntell application \"Notes\"\n    set theNote to first note\n    set theFile to ((path to desktop as text) & \"output.html\")\n    my write_to_file(body of theNote, theFile, false)\nend tell\n\ndo shell script \"textutil -convert rtf \" & (POSIX path of theFile)\n\non write_to_file(this_data, target_file, append_data) -- (string, file path as string, boolean)\n    try\n        set the target_file to the target_file as text\n        set the open_target_file to ¬\n            open for access file target_file with write permission\n        if append_data is false then ¬\n            set eof of the open_target_file to 0\n        write this_data to the open_target_file starting at eof\n        close access the open_target_file\n        return true\n    on error\n        try\n            close access file target_file\n        end try\n        return false\n    end try\nend write_to_file\n\nThis prints the first note in the list, if you want a specific one, or all of them, you can modify it to loop over the notes.\nHopefully that's a helpful starting point. I haven't had the time to look at how to export Reminders, perhaps someone else can chime in with that.\n", "Q: Is backup mandatory for upgrade to iOS 6 in iPhone 4S? I know that it is recommended that I backup my data, but if I upgrade to an iPhone 4S to iOS 6, does everything in my iPhone get deleted? Or does it keep original data, except when some errors occur?\n\nA: If everythings runs smoothly (as is usually the case) you won't lose anything, nothing will get deleted.\nBut even the best engineered update process can fail. So it is best practice to back up an iPhone on a regular basis and specially before updating (like with any other device/computer, for that matter). Why? Because sometimes things go wrong. And a backup is like an insurance policy on your data.\nLuckily Apple makes it easy: iTunes always backs up your iPhone before updating. If you prefer an over-the-air update, you can back up you iPhone to iCloud.\n(I prefer backing up to iCloud, a friend of mine overwrote the iTunes backup after a failed update and lost all data.)\n\nA: The problem is you can't go back and make a backup later if things fail. The OS first checks for enough space to unpack the new OS, then sets the device to reboot and migrate all the settings you made and update the new OS to match as closely how the old was configured by you. It then deletes all the old \"system\". Unless Apple tested a phone with exactly the same combination of settings as you have chosen, there is a small chance their script will have an error in your input conditions. \nIf you are OK erasing the phone and then installing the clean OS - then you don't need a backup. If you are not OK losing all your data, then you do need a backup. The same holds true if you are going to let your phone sit on a table overnight. You don't need a new OS install for things to go wrong - sometimes computers fail and go wrong even though the designer didn't program that into the code.\n", "Q: Can I charge my iPod Nano 2012 with the iPad USB plug? I have a brand new Nano, and was wondering if I can use the same electrical connector that I've received with my iPad2 to charge the Nano? Will it be armfull for the Nano?\n\n\n\nA: The short answer is yes. The rule of thumb when dealing with DC power adapters is to ensure that the polarity and voltage matches and that the adapter can supply at least as much current as the electronic device requires. Incorrect voltage or mismatched polarity can damage an electronic device; insufficient current will only result in insufficient power to operate or charge the device.\nHowever, all USB power sources provide 5 volts regardless of whether they are ports on your computer or AC chargers, and both the USB port and Dock Connector are standardized in terms of polarity and can only be plugged in one way. Therefore, your iPad, iPhone and iPod models all use the same voltage and the iPad and iPod adapters supply the same voltage, as do your computer’s USB ports and third-party USB power adapters. Basically, if it’s a USB device, it’s always 5 volts.\nHowever, although all USB devices run at the same voltage, some like the iPad require more power (wattage) than others. Since power is a factor of voltage and current (amperage), and the voltage in this case is a constant, then the charger must be able to supply more current to meet the increased demand for power. In the case of the iPad, the USB charger is able to provide 2.1A of current (or 10W of power); by comparison, standard computer USB ports normally provide only 0.5A (2.5W), and most USB chargers provide between 1A (5W) and 1.5A (7.5W). Some computer USB ports can provide up to 1.5A expressly for charging purposes, and modern Macs can even provide the 2.1A required for iPad charging on at least some of their USB ports.\nRegardless of the current available, however, electronic devices only draw as much as they need. This means that if you connect an iPhone or iPod to an iPad charger, it will still only draw around 1A of current—the charger effectively runs at a lower power level, supplying 5W of charging power. Conversely, when you connect an iPad to an iPhone charger, it will try to get a full 2.1A, but won’t be able to as the charger is only capable of supplying 1A. This results in a considerably slower charging time as the iPad is effectively draining the battery as fast as it can be recharged.\nThe bottom line is that you can plug any USB device into any USB charging port without having to worry about damaging anything. It’s worth noting, however, that many cheaper USB charging accessories do not properly comply with the USB Battery Charging Specification and as a result many electronic devices—including the iPad, iPhone and iPod—will not detect these as valid chargers and will refuse to draw any power at all. This will still not harm anything, however—they simply won’t work. \nNow I did not wrote this myself so the credits go to ilounge\nYou'll find the article here\n", "Q: How can I toggle magic mouse one finger swipe pages gesture via terminal?

In any case I would avoid calling both (which could also be the problem).

Txn!\n\nA: Office is moderately scriptable with AppleScript, so the command line interface to AppleScript can get the job done.\nTry this (adapted from this blog post by Jim Shank), replacing the subject text, name and email as appropriate:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Microsoft Outlook\"' -e 'set newMessage to make new outgoing message with properties {subject:\"My Subject\"}' -e 'make new recipient at newMessage with properties {email address:{name:\"John Smith\", address:\"jsmith@example.com\"}}' -e 'open newMessage' -e 'end tell'\n\nIt's a bit lengthy, but it will get the job done. You could adapt this into a small script that you could call and provide parameters to more concisely (i.e. sendoutlook john@example.com \"My Subject\" \"Hi John, blah blah blah\") without too much work, but that's probably best left as a separate question.\n\nA: The first step is to change your default mail reader on your Mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Mail.app\n\n*Choose Mail...Preferences from the menubar\n\n*On the General tab, change your Default email reader to Outlook.\n\n\nNext from the terminal, use the open command with the mailto: URL.

Starting in Vim 7.3, +clipboard uses the OS X pasteboard directly (via the * or + register, as you expected).\nIt probably is possible to use +xterm_clipboard with an X server configured to convert X’s selection to and from the OS X pasteboard, but it would probably be more problematic than the direct +clipboard solution.\n\nAs an example, the MacPorts build of the vim port that I have currently installed (vim @7.3.661_0+huge+perl+python27+ruby+tcl) has +clipboard, -xterm_clipboard, and can access the pasteboard through * and +.\nAlso, if you happen to be running Vim inside tmux you will probably need my wrapper program to reenable pasteboard access inside tmux sessions; this only applies to +clipboard access: X-mediated access might still work OK—as long as you keep DISPLAY updated—but still seems unnecessarily cumbersome to me.\n", "Q: Mountain Lion spaces erratic behavior I have been noticed unique behavior between virtual desktops on my Macbook. For example, Mail is in Space 1, my browser in Space 2, and Autocad in Space 3. Seemingly at random intervals, it will change Space 2 and Space 3, so I end up with, basically Space 1, 3, 2 (but they are labeled space 1, 2, 3).\nIs this a feature, or something that can be fixed?\nI'm not sure if it is related to the question, but I have also noticed that sometimes when I do the four finger swipe to change spaces, it jumps two spaces.\n\nA: You can uncheck \"Automatically rearrange spaces based on most recent use\" on the \"Mission Control\" tab in system preferences. This will leave the desktops in the expected order.\n\nA: My observation is that the \"spaces\" (now called \"desktops\") in Mountain Lion are sorted in a \"most recently used\" type order. That is, the more often a switch to a particular desktop, the closer to the \"front\" of the desktop list it is moved. If you enable the 4-finger \"swipe up\" Mission Control gesture, you can see the desktops in their \"swipe\" order.\nI suspect one reason for this is that \"full screen\" apps get their own desktop, so the number of desktops varies dynamically, and the simple number/grid scheme from earlier OS X versions no longer can apply. \nI tend to switch apps with command-tab, so the absolute placement of desktops is not so relevant to me. I do occasionally miss the ability to switch to a particular desktop with control-number, but have gotten used to using \"swipe up\" to find and select the desktop I want.\nIf you want to associate an app with a desktop of its own, switch to the \"last\" (empty) desktop, start the app, and select Options->Assign to This Desktop from the context menu in the dock for that app. If the app supports full screen mode, simply switch it to full screen and it will create its own desktop.\nI was going to include a sample \"Mission Control\" screenshot below, but I haven't answered enough questions here yet, so I've posted it on dropbox instead. You can use the 4-finger left/right swipe to switch desktops in this view, or you can click on the thumbnail of the desktop you want to switch to. Across the top of the screen are the desktop thumbnails. Spotify is in full-screen mode. Desktop 4 has no apps on it. If I put an app there, I will get a new empty Desktop 5. I'm currently on Desktop 1, which is shown \"exploded\" below the thumbnails.\n", "Q: Connect to external TV without main screen I have a Macbook Pro 13 \"(late 2009) with a screen that just stopped working.\nIn the technical assistance they told me that the problem would be the logic board or the display, any of them quite expensive to fix.\nSo, I bought an mini display port to HDMI adapter to connect to my TV until I buy a new laptop.\nThe problem is that it did not automatically detect the tv and as I cannot see the monitor, I cannot configure it.\nIs there anyway for me to configure my laptop to show the screen on the TV just with the keyboard or by VoiceOver (not sure how that works)\nthank you\n\nA: sounds like you need to reset the PRAM/NVRAM which contains the resolution information. \nHere is the apple page (instructions) on doing it.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT1379\n", "Q: Setting up rEFIt-based tripple boot system on a Mac with a pre-existing Boot Camp installation What I have right now is an iMac running Mountain Lion with a Boot Camp partition running Windows 7. I have a vanilla Boot Camp setup with no quirky bells and whistles on the side.\nWhat I want is to install rEFIt so I can triple boot Mountain Lion, Windows 7 and Ubuntu. I've done this several time before and am aware of the process I need to go through, including how to handle the presence of 5 partitions on a system that can only handle 4.\nWhat I don't want to have to do is wipe out my Boot Camp partition in order to do this. It's possible, since I only have games which can be reinstalled, but I have a lot of them and that would be a huge pain, so I'd like to avoid that route if possible.\nQuestion: Is it possible to set up a rEFIt-based triple boot system while preserving a pre-existing Boot Camp partition?\n\nA: I've just decided to go ahead with it and see what happens and rEFIt successfully picks up the Windows 7 partition as desired.\nFollowing the Lifehacker guide to triple booting, there's a section that says\n\nIf you've already installed Windows using Boot Camp, though, that's\n  fine—just ignore the Windows parts of this step\n\n", "Q: Open two views of the same PDF Is there a way to open two views of the same PDF in Preview (without creating two copies of the file), or perhaps split the window and show two different pages at the same time?\nThis is very useful when reading a paper which refers back to equations on previous pages.\n\nA: Skim has menu items for marking a page and going back to a marked page. You can assign shortcuts to them in System Preferences.\n\n\nA: Open the first one regularly and then use the open command with the -n option.\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*Type open -n and drop the file into the Terminal window. The full path of the file will appear after what you've typed.\n\n*Hit enter.\n\nThe -n option opens a new instance of the application (in this case the default one, as no other is specified) even if one is already running.\n\nA: From the Print dialogue choose the PDF button, Open PDF in Preview. \nThe temporary copy seems just to vanish when closed, as you would want; and it has the same name and location as the original. If you markup the new copy, it creates a duplicate with new name and you choose to save or not.\n\nA: One other solution would be use your browser to open the PDF file.\nFor me is common to use chrome for reading a PDF when I want 2 instances of the file.\nI also believe that is faster to search a word in a large PDF file using the browser than the PDF software. \n\nA: The \"open -n\" solution can be integrated to Finder using Automator. \nFor this, open Automator and select \"Quick Action\" for new document type. Then, select \"Workflow receives current\" \"files or folders\" in \"Finder.app\". \nThen from the list of search items, enter \"Run Applescript\" and use the following script, which takes the selected file from finder and opens it using \"open -n\" command:\n  on run {input, parameters}\n    set pathToMe to POSIX path of input\n    set command to \"open -n \" & \"\\\"\" & pathToMe & \"\\\"\"\n    # display dialog command #(this is for debugging)\n    do shell script command\n\n    return input\n\nSave the document with name \"Open with new instance\". Then, when you right click on a pdf file on finder, the \"Open with new instance\" menu item will be available. \nI have tried to bring this into the services menu of Preview, however I could not succeed in that. For now, finder integration works for me. \nNote: When you use the File -> Print option suggested in the accepted answer, Preview temporarily creates a file with name: Filename.pdf.pdf. This means that, when you accidentally make highlights, annotations on the temporary file, you'll loose your edits when you close that temporary file. On the other hand, when you use the \"open -n\" solution, two instances of Preview works on the very same files. Edits to any of the files are reflected to other instance when you save it. The only glitch is, after editing in one instance of preview when you save the file, the other instances scroll to the same page. This actually happens after some timer expires, even if you don't save the file. If this is annoying for you, the File->Print approach would work better. \nIn the end, it is a plain shame that Apple does not implement a proper implementation of multiple views of same pdf document for Preview. Adobe Acrobat Reader does it very nicely, for example (Window -> New Window) however, for now, Adobe Reader has poor performance on Mac operating system, compared to Windows Operating system.  \n\nA: The combination of Copy and New from Clipboard lets you open any part of the PDF in a new window (with the caveat that it's not a view in the sense that modifications do not propagate to the original document). Use rectangular selection to select the part of the PDF you want in a separate window , e.g. a figure or chart, or select a whole page, and hit command-c-command-n.\n", "Q: Synology Mac OS X startup mounting folders via NFS A couple of years or so ago, I modified a script, according to a forum message, which would (I assume) automount the folders found on my Synology server, ie web, video, public, music, photo at startup time. This would then show these folders in the Finder window. I no longer have the Synology server running so as a result, whenever I restart my IMac (OS X 10.7.5) there are messages that pop up for each folder: \"There was a problem connecting to the server \"192.168.xxx.xxx\". Now I can't remember what script I changed so I can comment out these commands. Can anyone help me?\n\nA: Have you checked your User Preferences to be sure these items are not checked in the \"Mount at login\" box?\nIf they are, it's a simple matter of deleting them from the list once you have authenticated to unlock the settings.\n\nA: Perhaps you're referring to /etc/auto_master.\n", "Q: Mountain Lion aggressively hibernates Recently, my MacBook Pro (mid 2012, 15 inch, 10.8.2) has started going into what seems to be hibernate mode after several hours asleep, whether it's plugged in or on battery. When I unplug it, it wakes briefly without me opening the lid (I can tell because the CD drive cycles). If I open the lid, I see it loading the hibernate file before becoming active again. \nI looked at the output of pmset -g, and see the following settings that might be relevant to this problem:\nlidwake              1\nautopoweroff         1\nautopoweroffdelay    14400\nstandbydelay         4200\nstandby              0\nhibernatemode        3\nacwake               0\n\nInterestingly, \"acwake\" is zero, as is \"standby\". But \"autopoweroff\" is 1, and the \"autopoweroffdelay\" is 14400 (4 hours). Looking at the system log from last night, I see these entries:\nNov 26 22:36:28 ITHAA1STHOMAMBP kernel[0]: sleep\nNov 27 02:36:30 ITHAA1STHOMAMBP kernel[0]: Wake reason: EC.SleepTimer (SleepTimer)\nNov 27 02:36:30 ITHAA1STHOMAMBP kernel[0]: AirPort_Brcm43xx::powerChange: System Wake - Full Wake/ Dark Wake / Maintenance wake\nNov 27 02:36:30 ITHAA1STHOMAMBP kernel[0]: Previous Sleep Cause: 5\n...\nNov 27 02:36:51 ITHAA1STHOMAMBP kernel[0]: hibernate_page_list_setall(preflight 0) start 0xffffff80de079000, 0xffffff80de0b9000\nNov 27 08:38:21 ITHAA1STHOMAMBP kernel[0]: hibernate_page_list_setall time: 491 ms\n...\nNov 27 08:38:31 ITHAA1STHOMAMBP kernel[0]: sleep\n\nI put the computer to sleep by closing the cover at 22:36. It woke itself 4 hours later at 02:36 and hibernated. At 08:38 I unplugged the power to bring the laptop to work, and it woke briefly.\nWhat it looks like to me is that the computer is going into auto power down after 4 hours. But there are some things I don't understand:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why did this start happening recently (within the last week, as far as I can recall, and not associated with any software update)?\n\n*Why does it wake on power change when \"acwake\" is 0?\n\n*Can I just set \"autopoweroff\" to 0?\n\n\nA: To control exactly when your Mac will transition from sleep to hibernate, you can use the following (the delay is in seconds) and you need to have hibernate mode to be set to either 3 or 25 (binary 0011 or 0001 1001):\npmset -a standby 1 standbydelay 600\n\nYou could use different settings and timings for -b battery and -c charger if desired. (Perhaps on power, you disable standby mode, but on battery have a 10 hour timeout.) These switches are documented in the manual page for pmset. I haven't messed with acwake lately, but in the past the lid proximity sensor of a portable would take precedence and suppress a wake that would have happened if the lid were open.\n\nA: I noticed the same. Luckily I had the free support option still active and I contacted them. See my post here at Apple Support Communities: MacBook Pro wakes from sleep at connect/disconnect AC power.\n\nRegarding waking up when AC power is attached/detached I have contacted Apple support and they were able to reproduce the problem. They consulted the behaviour with their engineers and they said that this is the expected behaviour. I don't know what is the reasoning behind this however I was also informed that I can provide feedback (via apple.com/feedback ) and I did.\n  If you guys think (like I do) that this feature is annoying and probably dangerous (when you detach the sleeping macbook from power and start toss it to put into backpack while hdd spins...) then I suggest to nag Apple on this matter.\n\nBasically, they admitted that the behavior is 'not a bug but a feature.'\n\nA: Apple seems to have added a new setting, \"autopoweroff\", to allow the system to hibernate when the lid is closed and the laptop is on AC power.  This complements the \"standby\" setting which is only used when on battery. \nSome power settings are configurable for different power sources, for example \"darkwakes\".  Some, like \"standby\", seem to only ever have been used for when the system is on battery power.  Since this was the historical use, and people would be upset if \"standby\" settings started to apply while on AC, Apple probably thought it was best to create a new setting just for AC - \"autopoweroff\". \n\nA: ML 10.8.2, mid-2012 15\" MBP (non-Retina).\nThis problem just popped up for me a couple weeks ago: leave MBP sleeping for X hours, unplug MBP, MBP lights/wakes up, enters hibernation.  Really annoying to open the lid only to have it shut down right in front of me.\nMy acwake was also disabled for both battery and AC.  Which means that the setting is now being ignored.\nThe solution appears to be (even though it's not referenced in the pmset man page):\nsudo pmset -a autopoweroff 0\nI should note that this does not affect acwake being ignored.  My computer still wakes up upon AC connect/disconnect, but it's not hibernating or attempting to hibernate after I've unplugged the computer and opened the lid.\n\nA: Using the autopoweroff set to 0 worked for me on a 2011 iMac that was exhibiting this behavior. It seems this is normal for 2012 iMacs, but after I had an Authorized Apple Service Provider replace a defective LCD, this behavior began. \nFYI for those who see this thread but are having this with a desktop.\nprimalman\n", "Q: How do I get my iPad running iOS 6.0.1 to connect to my MS Exchange mail server? I've gone through the adding procedure and it all verifies and looks good there.  However, it will not receive or send any mail (nor sync up contacts/tasks, etc).  It's just throwing the terribly uninformative \"An error has ocurred\" message.  I'm running the latest iOS - 6.0.1 - on this iPad 2.\nThus far, I've tried deleting and re-adding Exchange on the iPad multiple times.  I've gone into OWA to delete it from the mobile phones list there, but it's not in the list.\nThere are other people successfully connecting to the same Exchange server with their iPads.\nWhat else should I be checking?\n\nA: You've got a 50 / 50 chance it's the device or the server at this point.\nIf you have access to the server logs, you could know exactly what is wrong. Alternatively, you could set up a different exchange account on your iOS device and use that to rule in or out the device and/or the account+server.\nAs there is so little you enter on iOS, apart from the date/time zone being wrong, or making a typo in the password or server settings, the problem is most likely on the server and of things with that account.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2480\nI have also had luck choosing one item only to sync initially - so if your Mail is hanging, the next time you attempt, do not enable Mail and instead just try contact or calendar data.\n\nA: Problem solved.  Another guy here remembered having this problem before a long time ago...  Checking the \"Add inheritable permissions\" check box under my account's advanced security settings on the Exchange server takes care of it.  Why it only affect iPads and not any of the other remote devices I use (Windows Mobile, etc) we have no clue.  :-)\n", "Q: Can a Mac be set up to dial arbitrary numbers by connecting to an iPhone? I normaly listen to music on my iPhone while working, and regularly I also have to be able to make calls. \nWhat tends to happen is that I google for the contact details of the place I'm calling and then have to type the number into my phone. It stikes me that there is probably a much more effective way of doing this - is there a utility that either lets me select a number on my browser and automatically call it? Or even just a shared clipboard between my phone and my MacBook? \n\nA: I use Google Voice's service to have my computer ring a third number and call my iPhone. Since I have most contacts in my Address Book and don't mind adding new ones - iCloud will get most contacts to the phone and Siri does a nice job dialing things, but there are also software packages that will literally dial your iPhone over a bluetooth connection.\nCheck out Dialectic for starters if you want a tool cut exactly for the job of dialing from OS X to iPhone remotely.\n", "Q: SSH to a device that connects to the internet via shared LAN I have a Raspberry Pi connected to my Macbook Pro with a LAN cable.\nThe network from my Mac is shared with the Raspberry Pi through this cable.\nIs it possible to ssh from my Mac to the Raspberry Pi through the LAN connection?\n\nA: Yes, this is possible. It depends on the network addresses you assigned the mac and the Raspberry Pi. For example, if your mac has one interface (en0) on one IP range and the other interface (en1) on another, you can log in via the connection (either en0 or en1) that is on an accessible network. \nIn my case, I can reach my home computer via a port forward from the internet. This is done by using a router that allows me to forward specific ports to specific internal IP addresses. \n -> (port 22 ssh) -> <172.16.0.5:22> \nSo, once I'm on my internal machine <172.16.0.5> I can then ssh to a machine connected to my machine via the en1 (wireless network) say 192.168.0.5\nSo, if you set up a connection from your mac to your raspberry pi on a private network, you can just ssh to your main machine and then to the private ip.\n\nA: Yes - as long as the Pi is listening on ssh and your network allows both devices to be on the same network subnet - you won't need to enable any extra routing or port forwarding / NAT to ssh back and forth between both devices.\nSince you are sharing the network, there should be a viable network connection between the two devices. It might be easier to get a cheap switch/hub so that the Pi can get on your home router and get an address from DHCP - but as long as you know the IP address of the Pi - your Mac could choose a compatible IP address for when you need to ssh in.\n", "Q: Cannot delete shared files I have Vmware Fusion 4 on my Mac. I used it for work for awhile and had windows 7 installed and was joined to a AD Domain. When I left the company I had to un-join it from the Domain. Now, I cannot delete files that were shared between the mac (iOS 6) and Windows. How can I change the permissions so I can clean up my mac? \n\nA: You should be able to turn off folder sharing between the VM and the Mac using Fusion's \"sharing\" settings and then shut down the VM.  After that, you should be able (from the Mac Finder) to move the shared folder to the Trash.  You may need to type an administrator password in the process, but that would be an administrator for the Mac host, which is presumably you.  \nIf that doesn't work, please provide more details, such as where the files are as seen by the VM, where the files are as seen by the Mac, and what happens when you try to delete the files from the Mac.  \n", "Q: How do I see disk usage within a Fusion Drive (CoreStorage Logical Volume)? I just created a \"Fusion Drive\" on my MacBook Pro by following \"How to make a Custom CoreStorage Drive in OS X\".\nIt was created with a 256GB SSD and 320GB HD, with the SSD set as the \"primary\" disk in the logical volume. However, I'm not seeing much of a speed increase, and I'm not sure my data is being stored to the SSD.\nHow do I confirm that most of my data is stored on the SSD within a Logical Volume?\nI was hoping I could simply see disk usage for each disk within the logical volume, but it looks like diskutil cs list doesn't report that.\n\nA: iostat command check out the complete article from JollyJinx blog.\nhttp://jollyjinx.tumblr.com/post/34638496292/fusion-drive-on-older-macs-yes-since-apple-has\n\nA: Based on jollyjinx's articles, I made this script which I used to help me test my DIY Fusion setup:  https://gist.github.com/11522980\nBasically, you have to fill the SSD with garbage files until they flow onto the HDD, then repeatedly access files from the HDD while watching disk activity. Eventually the HDD activity will stop and SSD activity will continue (or start), meaning the files have been effectively transferred.\n", "Q: Moving a folder with \"sudo mv\", how to preserve ACLs? I'm moving a whole folder from one volume to another (both HFS+), using sudo mv, and thought ACLs would be preserved. However at the end of transfer I see that they haven't been kept, and since mv deleted the files in the original volume I can't restore them.\nWhy did this happen, and how to do it right next time?\n\nA: It would be better to use the ditto command since it is aware of resource forks, HFS attributes as well as ACL. You can alias it or try and rewire  your brain to use ditto as best fits your workflow.\n\nA: mv uses cp when moving files between different volumes, and it looks like the -p option isn't used, so ACL aren't preserved.\nHowever if moved in the same volume ACLs are of course preserved.\n", "Q: Can I access a Thunderbolt drive with the AirPort Extreme? Is there a way to connect a Thunderbolt hard drive to an AirPort Extreme?\n\nA: At the moment, the only storage ports on the Airport Extreme is a USB port. So, if your Thunderbolt drive has a USB connector as well, then you can use it, otherwise you will have to wait for Apple to make a Airport Extreme with a Thunderbolt connector.\n", "Q: How to un-delete podcast episode in iOS 6 Podcasts app I was deleting some old episodes of a podcast I like—just to get them out of the way in the episode queue—and I accidentally deleted an episode I wanted to keep. Problem is, it seems to be gone forever. \nSwiping down on the page to refresh the list doesn't make episodes I've deleted reappear, and there's nothing in the show settings I can see that would allow me to re-download deleted episodes. It's effectively as if deleted episodes no longer exist, as far as my phone is concerned. I've force-closed the app and restarted my phone since discovering this, just in case. It made no difference. \nAm I missing something obvious? What, if anything, can be done to un-delete deleted podcast episodes in the iOS 6 Podcasts app?\n\nA: On the iPhone, tap the podcast in your list, then tap the header of the podcast to access the subscription settings. Simply toggle \"off,\" then \"on\" for subscription and all the swiped-deleted podcasts will be restored.\n\nA: On iOS 7, tap the podcast in your list, then tap the header of the podcast to access the subscription settings.\nAfter this, swipe up to scroll all the way to the bottom of your episodes, then choose \"Add Old Episodes,\" checkmark the episode(s) you want to get back, then choose \"Add.\"\n\nA: Is it a podcast available in the iTunes Store? I've made the same mistake and fixed it by going to the podcast's page and downloading the episode.\n\nA: At the bottom of a list is a button reading \"Add Old Episodes\" which allows you to add anything you have deleted manually.\n", "Q: iphone pdf app that doesn't scroll I often use my iphone to scan through presentations that are stored as pdfs. Often, the information on the following page of a document is the same as the previous page plus some extra information. What I find annoying is that the pdf readers I have tried so far all \"animate\" the scrolling to the next page. All I want is an instant \"next page\", like one gets when one makes the presentation.\nI have looked at myPDFs and Adobe acrobat.\nCan anyone suggest an app that has ability?\n\nA: iBooks, the free ebook reading app from Apple, paginates both ebooks (in epub format) and pdfs. It is not instant, though.\n", "Q: Is there any way to use Safari 5.1's rendering engine for browser testing on OSX 10.8 (Mountain Lion)? I have OSX 10.8.2 (Mountain Lion) on both my Macs, which comes with Safari 6.1. A couple of my clients have been reporting minor CSS errors using Safari 5.1, which I obviously can't install. This makes fixing these errors very, very difficult. \nAre there any recommended methods for testing with the rendering engines of older versions of Safari? Would there be an appropriate vintage version of Webkit that would be able to install on 10.8, as the appropriate nightlies refuse to run?\n\nA: I found a project online which i think uses an old WEBKIT renderer..\nhttp://michelf.ca/projects/multi-safari/ gives old versions, but i don't know which ones you will be able to run on your new machine. For myself,  I'm running 4.0.5 because of the reduced RAM usage.\n\nA: You can enable the Develop menu in the Preferences > Advanced checkbox (show develop menu in the menubar). \nOnce you do that, you can change the user agent to the older versions of Safari.\n\nA: The latest version of Safari Web Browser is 6.0.5. Your clients should be using the latest version. But for you to test on older versions, go into Boot Camp Assistant and install an older version of OS X (using the Disks that came with your Mac). I have Lion and Tiger on this MacBook I am posting this answer on. Boot into Tiger and try to replicate the problem. Make sure not to update Safari on that OS.\n", "Q: What domain name is appended to a default Apple ID when created in OS X? Upon booting a MacBook Air for the first time (OS X, Version 10.8), I was prompted to create an AppleID. I selected a username and a default domain name was added automatically to this username. \nI cannot recall what the domain name was. Does anybody know the default domain name?\n\nA: The default domain name for new Apple ID's (or iCloud accounts) is @icloud.com. You can also use @me.com.\n", "Q: Image Capture OS X 10.6 won't read from iPhone Image Capture on Snow Leopard says the \"iPhone is locked with code\", and asks to unlock it before importing images. The most weird thing is that it can import just fine using iPhoto and it syncs through iTunes. Seems it is a problem with Image Capture, any ideas?\nIf anyone could try to send the Image Capture.app to me to test with, that would be great. Thanks!\n\nA: With ImageCapture closed, look in ~/Library/Preferences for com.apple.Image_Capture.plist and com.apple.ImageCaptureExtension2.plist and move them to the Trash. Preferences files often become corrupt, and this is the first, easiest step.\n\nA: I tried the following on OSX 10.6 and 10.7 and it works. Being very quick to press \"trust\" (on iPhones dialog 'trust this computer') might be a solution for you too. Please see the detailed description here:\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/297828/254849\nErasing the plists (as described by @Emil and @Zo219, above) works for me, but only if I erase them each time I want to connect and import.\n", "Q: Can a Mac's separate audio-in and audio-out ports be reversed in software? Recently my Mid 2009 15 Inch (2.66 GHz) MacBook Pro's audio-out headphone port has gotten physically \"loose\". When I plugin anything it easily slips out changing the audio output from \"Headphones\" to \"Built-in speakers\".  \nMy audio-in port has not been used very much, and the same mini-jack plugged in there sits tight. \nI might be wrong, but I always thought that the audio-in/out ports did not differ much from each other hardware wise, so I was wondering if it is somehow possible to configure my MacBook Pro (software wise) to reverse these ports.\nIf I could output audio through the audio-in port I would be happy. It would be ideal, but not a necessity and that the Mac would then accept audio through the headphone port.\n\nA: Every Mac with two headphone sized jacks has one for in and one for out as the hardware is specialized for one direction. You don't need to repair the computer to remedy this if you are OK with an external DAC such as the Griffin iMic. \nThe Mid 2009 MBP have identical physical connectors soldered on to the logic board, so even if the jack parts themselves are physically identical, they are wired to different parts of the sound in/out circuitry for both analog and digital and replacing that mounted part that would require a high level of soldering skill. The cheapest repair for this issue is the flat rate repair from Apple but even that is pricey when you could use tape or some other physical aid to keep the headphone in the jack as the metal latch no longer holds the pin properly.\n\nA: Microphones and headphones are not much different, no, but there are many other fundamental differences.\nThe Speaker/Headphone Output supports the third ring which is used for microphone in (seriously) and the button on Apple and some third party headsets.\nLine In only supports two rings at best.\nBoth of these ports support optical (I think), but bmike is in the right ballpark given that these ports will be connected to very specific parts of the audio driver chip.\nIt's not purely software routing at play in order to drive these ports.\n", "Q: How to restore iPhone 5 from iOS 5 backup? I had an iPhone 4 with iOS 5 which I regularly backed up using iTunes. Then I used a Android device for a little over a year. Now I'm back on iOS with an iPhone 5. So I'm trying to setup it with the Restore from iTunes backup option. But I get the following error:\n\nIs there any way to fix this? I would really like to get my pictures and messages restored. \nUpdate: Some more information. I used to have another computer, have not upgraded MacBook -> MacBook Pro, so I copied the ~/Library/Application Suppor/MobileSync/Backup folder to the new computer before the restore process. Restoring on the original MacBook yields the same result.\n\nA: I have restored plenty of iOS 5 backups onto iOS 6 devices so the problem here is almost certainly that the backup is now (and may have been all along) corrupt.\nBefore throwing that backup away and restoring the iTunes files from a backup of the computer where it was stored (hopefully you have that), you could try restoring the backup onto another device such as a borrowed iPad or iPod touch (or iPhone) to be sure it's not the phone you are restoring the backup to.\nThe article iTunes: About iOS backups will help you locate where your computer stored this backup set as well as general info to support the idea that you can back up an older OS onto a newer OS (but not the other way around).\n\nA: Make sure your backup is not from a beta version of iTunes, which may happen if you used your phone for development.\nThis can be done by looking in the Info.plist file for the backup, which are located in ~/Library/Application Suppor/MobileSync/Backup. The iTunes version is stated in the en of that file.\n", "Q: Does there exist any Apple hardware \"Cloud Computing\" solutions? I have a program which uses Mac OS X's Grand Central Dispatch queueing technology to handle multi-core programming.  However, I notice that, in the near future, Microsoft is expecting to roll out cloud-based multicore programming where you can run your parallel programs on a ridiculously large (8,000+ core) setup with a pay-by-the-hour setup.\nAre there currently plans for Apple to offer similar iCloud-based \"Big Computing\" in the near future?  Is there already something like that which exists that I am unaware of?\n\nA: No - Apple stopped selling both its enterprise storage Xserve RAID as well as its enterprise server Xserve in February 2008 and January 2011 respectively. Even the workstation-class Mac Pro has only seen incremental updates over time so the only way to get \"into the cloud\" with Apple as of late 2012 is by developing software that uses their iCloud API and service.\nThe only credible rumor of Apple product is the very vague announcement to the \"Pro user community\" from a short email by Tim Cook that promised that Apple are \"working on something really great\" for later in 2013. Whether that is going to be new (and perhaps cloud-based) hardware or software or just a re-design of what we've already seen is left to a lot of rumor and speculation at present.\n\nA: The only cloud solution apple ever announced is apple i Cloud and recently they admitted that they are using google cloud. There are better options like AWS. It can even support server less apps\n", "Q: Is there a way for me to open a .xdi file? I have on my computer a file that as been compress with the .xdi extension.\nIs there a way for me on my Mac OS X to open it?\n\nA: If you absolutely have to use a Mac to open the xdi file, and you have Parallels or some other virtual environment that can run Windows, you can install WinArchiver and open the file that way.\nAs far as I know there is no utility for Mac that can open xdi files because they are created using WinArchiver which is a Windows only app.\n", "Q: Can I use an HFS+ usb disk with encryption enabled with a Time Capsule (2TB is mine) I have a 2TB Time Capsule (version 7.6.1) and I want to connect a USB disk formatted as HFS+ with encryption enabled (on MAC OS X Mountain Lion). When I connect it directly to my iMac, it asks for a password (if it's not already in the keychain) and then I can see it mounted. Is there a way to give the password when it's connected to the Time Capsule or it doesn't support encrypted disks at all?\n\nA: As far as I can tell from reading Apple documentation and other users' experience (I don't own a Time Capsule myself) you can't use encrypted HFS+ drives.\nAccording to http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2426 Time Capsule only supports HFS+, HFS+ with journaling, FAT16 and FAT32, which would rule out encrypted HFS+:\n\nThe AirPort Extreme (802.11n) and Time Capsule support USB storage\n  devices that are formatted as Mac OS Extended (HFS-plus), FAT16, or\n  FAT32. Formatting a storage device as Mac OS Extended with journaling\n  is recommended, as it may provide some more resilience if the device\n  is removed or powered down while in use. \n  Note: ExFAT and NTFS formats aren't supported.\n\nIf encrypted HFS+ were supported Airport Utility would provide some means for entering the password to decrypt the attached harddrive. The password would then be used by NetBSD, which is the underlying OS that exports the disks contents over the network, to mount the drive. This doesn't seem to be implemente yet.\nMaybe someone actually owning a Time Capsule can test it and chime in.\n\nA: With OS X Mountain Lion, you assign encryption after the backup volume is selected. Once the location is chosen, use the System Settings in the Time Machine config to set your passcode (the encryption key is created from this) to encrypt the backup data.  So, the drive is not encrypted the Time Machine data IS encrypted.\n", "Q: Does there exist an iPhone application that can call an online API (RESTful or otherwise) triggered by geofences?

I ended up just downloading and using GIMP because of it's flexibility as a tool.\nThere are two ways to blur:\n1) Simply use the blur tool and drag over the text.  If you want to be cleaner, you can use the rectangle selection tool first and then use blur so you get sharper edges.\n\n2) There is also an option in the toolbar to blur selection as well (so it's more evenly blurred) - I would recommend a high (15x15) gaussian blur (Filters -> Blur -> Gaussian Blur... from the menu). Select the area you want to blur first and then use the appropriate blur filter.\n\nAgain, I know it's not as simple and direct as some of the other tools, but GIMP just offers a lot of other features built pretty well. In my case, I downloaded it and used it for blurring of text since I know I'll be using it for other capabilities in the future.

They were taken with an iPhone so they're geotagged but we could be dealing with manually geotagged pics, doesn't matter. I want to publish the equivalent of what I see in the Places section of Aperture. A map (any provider is fine) fully scrollable and or zoomable, with my set of pictures on it. Pics could be thumbnails or pins until you click on it, it doesn't matter.\nIs my only solution the iPad iPhoto app and its journal feature? (never used it so I'm just guessing) Would that do the trick? Any other Mac software out there (dare I dream of an Aperture plugin?) that could do that?\n\nA: One solution that I used before is to publish it on Flickr and use their map feature. I think I can directly share the link to the map with my friends. One needs to make sure to include geolocation data when uploading. \nAs an aside, not crazy about Flickr anymore, my subscription is about to expire and I would like to find something else, hence the question !\nEDIT: A better solution seems to be picasa, with an upload to picasa web and options to get a google map online or a Google Earth kml file.\n", "Q: How do I remove a Lightning cable that is stuck in a USB port? I inserted the USB end of the lightning to USB cable that came with the iPhone 5 into a D-Link USB hub. When I tried to unplug the cable, it seemed impossible to remove. I tried using a screw driver to pry the connector out, but it didn't move with a reasonable amount of pressure. I tried using a piece of rubber to improve my grip on the connector, but that didn't work.\nHow do I safely extract the cable from the hub?\n\nA: I found a discussion on this topic on the Apple forums. I tested a few of the solutions, including using a plastic collar stay, but the suggestion that worked was using two thin cardboard strips to release the grip. What worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find a thin, semi-glossy business card, or similar piece of cardboard and cut it into two strips about the width of the USB port. You can use an un-occupied port to make sure the strip is narrow enough to fit. \n\n*Insert the strips on the two wide sides of the USB port, between the outside of the cable's plug and the inside of the USB port. You may need to work the strips back and forth to get them in. I had to insert the strips to about 2/3 the depth of the port. If you have difficulty inserting the cardboard, you may need a thinner material.\n\n*Grasp the sandwich of the cardboard strips and the USB plug. Pull. The plug should come out as easily as a normal plug would.\n\n\nA: I had this problem.  Once the USB plug was out, I used a utility knife blade to carefully scrape a 45 degree angle bevel from each of the four holes in the plug on the side that is farthest from the wire.  I still have to wiggle the plug to get it out, but it is much easier.  If you try this, remember you will be creating tiny metal flakes, so blow the plug out before plugging it into anything.  Be very careful not to damage the wires inside the plug holes.\n\nA: This is what worked for me so far.\nWARNING!!!! dont try this method if there is still power on the usb port. you are basicly shoving a piece of metal inside of it ! Please be carefull for yourself and your products. i am not responsible for any damage you do in this proces.\n\n\n*\n\n*get a soda can and empty it out\n\n*get a knife or scissor, and cut the top and bottom off.\n\n*Cut the middle piece in half, so all thats left is a sheet of tin. Cut a rectangle shape out of it the size of the usb port, and fold it 1 or 2 times. \n\n*Insert the piece you have made into the side where there is no logo printed 1/3 2/3 in (I think this is only on the official usb cable, the original cable has holes drilled into them at the back side, you are pushing the latches out of those holes ).\n\n*pull the piece of tin back with the usb cable at the same time, and it should be fixed. it pulles really easily. i hope this fixed your problem.\n\n\nA: I used an eyelash curler. It had a better grip on the part barely sticking out\n", "Q: How can I remove remnant processes from deleted preference panes? I discovered in Activity Monitor that I have several leftover processes running in the background that shouldn't be there anymore. I deleted these preference panes long ago with an application that was supposed to find all the extraneous files. So how do I get rid of them?\nI've tried to kill the processes by quitting, force quitting, terminal commands involving killall/kill, launchctl unload and they still won't go away. They just restart themselves. What's more is I can't find where these reside on my system. They aren't listed in the \"Login Items\" section under my user account, as they are owned by root. I've searched but found no exact answer to my problem. I've found similar situations but not the same. \nHere are the processes in question in my particular case:\n\nA: Many preference pane applications also have background processes or kernel extensions. Removing the preference pane doesn't remove them, so you have to run an uninstaller or delete the files separately.\nBackground processes are often started by launchd services in the LaunchDaemons or LaunchAgents folders. You can remove them by just deleting the property list files (and restarting or logging out and back in). Some applications add login items that can be removed in the Users & Groups preference pane.\nThe executables for the background processes are often somewhere in the root or user library, but they don't necessarily have to be removed.\nKernel extensions (in /System/Library/Extensions/) can also be removed by just moving them to the trash.\nYou can use Consultant's Canary to print a list of components that didn't come with OS X.\n\nA: My solution to this problem ended up being simpler than I realized. While in Activity Monitor, I clicked 'Inspect' on one of the selected processes and discovered it was a sub-process of 'launchd.' That was why I couldn't kill it. After some searching with new information, I found the location of the files in question under /Library/LaunchDaemons. I selected the offending files, trashed them after entering my admin password, restarted and now they are no more. I had previously tried the terminal command launchctl unload to unload the processes but this kept failing no matter what I did, so I resorted to just deleting the files as I didn't need them anymore.\n", "Q: How can I convert .ichat logs to text files? How do you convert the iChat transcript files that Messages creates into human-readable text files that can be opened without the Messages app?\nFor reference, these are the conversation files located in ~/Library/Messages/Archive.\nSimply opening the .ichat files in a text editor includes a bunch of additional strings and hashes. Opening them in Messages and copy-pasting into a text editor works, but I'd prefer to automate the process if possible.\n\nA: Check out my project that will take all of your conversations and convert them into one readable text file. It won't convert just a single iMessage, but it will collect all of your messages and attachments, back them up, and put them into a human-readable format.\nhttps://peterkaminski09.github.io/baskup\n\nA: The files that Messages saves have an ichat file extension.\nBut from the command line you can inspect them to see they are actually binary plist files:\n$ file transcript.ichat\ntranscript.ichat: Apple binary property list\n\nTurns out, you can easily convert binary plist files into human-readable XML documents:\n$ plutil -convert xml1 transcript.ichat\n\nNow, when you run file again, you can see it's an XML file:\n$ file transcript.ichat\ntranscript.ichat: XML document text\n\nGo ahead—open it and see for yourself:\n$ open transcript.ichat\n\n\nA: If you are familiar with sqlite, you can just export the messages directly from the database on Mountain Lion iMessage.\nsqlite3 /Users/(username)/Library/Messages/chat.db\n\nFrom the database, you can send sql commands to get any and all messages and associated fields you have interest. Further, you can change the output settings to write directly to a file.\nAlso, in addition to the database, all photos are stored in the Attachments folder. \n\nA: I've created a command line tool for converting these ichat files to newline-separated JSON\nThe tool extracts the bare essential information: message, sender, date\nYou can view the source code and/or download binary at https://github.com/kfatehi/ichat2json\n\nA: If you select print from the file menus, when the print box opens in the lower left is a pdf button with a drop down. From here you can save as pdf, post script, mail as pdf or send to iTunes.\n\nA: For those with folders full of .ichat files on their hands, whether or not they're part of ~/Library/Messages, my project will instantly convert those to RTF or plain-text format: https://github.com/Amethyst-Software/convert-ichat-files (pre-built binary is provided). Basic messages as well as file transfer messages (not the files themselves) and chat client events are translated to text. Group chats are supported as well.\n\nA: I've created an app called \"Past for iChat\" to do this (open iChats/Chat logs on macOS 11+ and export them in various formats): https://zeezide.de/en/products/past/\n\nA: This wouldn't be a perfect solution, but I notice that the messages are always between Ä_ and _$. You could write a script to extract all the text which started and ended with those characters. (any language with rexex support would do)\n\nA: This seems like an ideal application of Automator workflows or AppleScript, since both of those can do \"press buttons onscreen\" style behavior. You'd say \"take file as input,\" and use something under \"print\" or \"messages\" if there are either of those, or use AppleScript to tell it to open the file and press file and print and save as pdf and then close the file.\n", "Q: Unable to view secure web pages from one particular user account My dad's computer is running OS X 10.5.8, and is almost always unable to open secure web pages from his account.  It's not that he can't log in—it's that the servers never even send a reply.  This is true from Safari 5.0.6, Firefox 12.0, SeaMonkey 2.13.1, and telnet to port 443.  All three browsers report that they are unable to establish a secure connection to the requested website.\nBut when I'm logged into his machine on my own account with those very same browsers, I can get to secure pages without any problem, and web browsing in general seems to be faster from my account than his.\nI've reset Safari for his account, but that made no difference.  We've restarted the machine multiple times.  His account is not an administrator account and I have parental controls enabled for him to keep him from accidentally modifying his Dock.

What could possibly explain this kind of difference in browser behavior between his account and mine?\n\nA: When any User Account mysteriously acts up, the fastest, easiest thing is ofen to make a new User Account, log in to that and see if the problem reocccurs. It's also a logical troubleshooting step.\n\nA: Apparently Parental Controls interferes with access to secure websites, even when \"Allow unrestricted access to websites\" is checked: Apple Support Communities\n", "Q: Disable cross-screen shadows I have a dual-screen setup, which works fine, but there's one annoyance, the window shadows.\nIf I maximize a window on one screen (or just make its edge touch the edge of one of the monitors), the shadow from that window \"crosses\" the screen and goes to the other one, creating a useless visual effect which just looks weird, since the monitors are not exactly touching, so the shadow has no usefulness or relevance there.\nIs there a way to disable it (but not disable all window shadows)?\n\nA: In OS X Mavericks there no longer are cross-screen shadows.\nYou can get this system update from the App store for free.\n\nA: The shadow crosses over because the computer treats the displays as one long desktop with no space between. So if you had one short-wide monitor, it would make sense to have that shadow where it is.\nThere are ways to adjust the size of your display, so perhaps you could do this on one of your monitors to create a \"dead zone\" between, i.e. a little strip of desktop that neither screen displays. I've never tried this, so no guarantees. Otherwise, simply disable shadows altogether.\n\nA: No - but if you feel strongly that Apple should fix this edge case, you could file a bug report and post the radar number. I'd be glad to duplicate your efforts to agitate and have enough light directed to this issue to remove the shadow.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/\n\nA: I use an app called ShadowKiller to turn off all window dropshadows. It was discontinued, but it still works with Mavericks.

I have a MacBook and an iPad and see dirt and fingerprints all over it.\nWhat kind of cleaner do the people in the Apple store use to clean all the Macs and iPads on display?\nI figure that anything strong enough to handle that abuse (being in a store used by so many people) should be good enough for use at home.\n\nA: I use iKlear on my Retina MBP. I can recommend them, however, they are a bit expensive. I have seen workers clean MBP's screens with it(though not in an official Apple store, but in a store that sells only Mac related products).\n\nA: They probably use some kind of wipes. There are wipes sold especially for computer screens. Maybe Apple-branded ones.\nI use the dilute rubbing alcohol with which I clean my eyeglasses and the corner of a clean cotton dishtowel. \nApple says to use just water, but I figure, you only go around once.\n\nA: I would not use anything with alcohol or solvent on the iPad, iPod touch, or iPhone, they have an oleo-phobic coating which repels the oil from ones hands. Any solvent, alcohol..... will reduce the life of the coating.

I've been searching the web, but can't seem to find anything.\n\nA: A lot of searching around, and I finally found cntlm which works quite well.  There is a slight build problem with v0.92.3 when compiling with Lion and XCode 4.5.1 - there is a make error that it does not recognize \"-Wno-unused-but-set-variable\".

About 3/10 times the discrete GPU on the Retina MBP (Nvidia GT650M) does not engage when I launch a game. The performance for the game drops to as if only the integrated GPU was engaged i.e single digit FPS. \nThis happens when previously the game would work just fine on the same settings. This also happens under the Windows 7 partition under Boot Camp so I know it is not a software issue. \nThe first time it happened I was completely flummoxed and simply could not find a solution. Just as a last resort I tried resetting the SMC and it started working fine after that. \nAnother thing is this problem may be occurring a lot more frequently but I can only get to know when I launch a game and it refuses to work properly. For almost all other tasks there is barely a difference when the Nvidia is working. (Guess that's why they let the 13\" retina be with just the integrated chip).\nNow this problem is occurring frequently enough to really bug me. I have been using a Mac since 2005 and I haven't had to reset the SMC this much in the last 6 years as I've had to in the last 5 or so months of using this machine. \nShould I get it checked at the store, ask for a replacement, or is there a more permanent solution that I'm not getting? \nEdit Can a mod please change the 'power-management' tag to SMC?\n\nA: Instead of resenting the SMC (a painful procedure) try this free software.\ngfxCardStatus \nIt is an unobtrusive menu bar app for OS X that allows MacBook Pro users to see which apps are affecting their battery life by using the more power-hungry graphics and\nManually switch to Integrated Only or Discrete Only mode to force one GPU on or the other.\nSince I am not sure of your model year, it works on:\nOS X Lion (10.7) or newer\n2008-2012, 15-17\" dual-GPU MacBook Pro\n\n\nA: Have you tried resetting the NVRAM-PRAM? \nSee http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1379 for instructions.\nI think I would also re-seat my RAM chips, were that my machine.

First you have to contact the developer in case of any app issue. But if have bought it mistakenly, then you will not get refund.\nFor official MAS FAQ : http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4461\n\nA: The Mac App store doesn't have an equivalent \"Report a problem\" link that iOS/iTunes app store customers can use to open a support ticket with the store billing support, so you might need to use general Billing Support for any Apple ID issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/support/appleid/\nYou should absolutely be clear (with screenshots if possible) to explain how the application failed to live up to the description that was available to you in the store - if the reviewers at Apple didn't catch a serious problem with the description of the goods as sold, I would expect most people to feel a refund would be a justifiable remedy. You are also free to contact the developer - reputable developers can and do offer refunds of either their share of your purchase and some even refund the entire purchase price - in effect paying Apple's cut even when they refunded your cost.\nLastly, you might use the generic feedback page after you have tried to get a refund to document how you felt about the Mac App store, the purchase tools and the complaint resolution process. I have found that nice but plainly honest complaints work best there.\nhttp://www.apple.com/feedback/\nThere isn't a neat category for third party App Store purchase feedback - so in this case, you might tie it to either the OS or the Hardware as you see fit.\n\nA: Always go to the apple refund.

If I delete an imessage from someone in IOS6, the moment i send them a new text/message, the entire chain of previous messages reappears.\n\nA: Go to the \"Messages\" screen where it shows all the contacts you texted and select edit, then delete the entire conversation \n\nA: There is no way to clear the history at present.\nApple didn't release an interface or tool to purge the messages that are stored on iCloud. You can only control and delete from the local cache of messages once they have been downloaded. Presumably they eventually get discarded, but there is no web interface or way to ask that the actual messages be deleted at the source. Nor is there a way to mark a message as to be deleted across all devices or in the cloud servers. Each deletion just deletes that message from the local cache of the machine doing the delete as opposed to permanently deleting anything.\nSee these threads for more details on this behavior:\n\n\n*\n\n*Permanently deleting iMessages in a Mac\n\n*Does deleting an iMessage on a device deletes it in all of the other iCloud synced devices?\nI've confirmed this behavior with direct discussions with Apple Support in the summer of 2014 that deleting a message from one device won't actually delete it anywhere else or from the cloud store for your account.\n", "Q: How do I get the old blue sms alert box for notification of new text messages? I used to get SMS alerts in lock screen which showed a blue box with the option of \"close\" or \"reply\". Now I get a green slider box with a white bubble. How can I change this back? I have set the notification to \"alert\" .\n\nA: It sounds like you're describing the style of text-message notifications pre- and post-iOS 5 (when Notification Center was introduced). \nIf I'm not mistaken, the first case looks something like this:\n\nAnd the current case looks like this:\n\nUnfortunately, there's no built-in way to revert this change: while the style of the iOS modal popup that appears to inform you of an alert while you're using the phone still looks the same (bluish background with acknowledgement buttons), the style of lock-screen notifications (whether the phone is locked or not) have changed to a black background with an app-specific icon that can be swiped to activate the alerting app.\nShort of some sort of Jailbreak tweak, or somehow downgrading your iOS version, there's no way to undo this change.\n", "Q: Can second hand SIM locked iPhone 4S be activated with a different carrier? I have my first experience with an iPhone, so really need some guidance and advice. I have got a second hand iPhone 4S - OS 5.1.1.

If you installed say, a retail copy of Snow Leopard on one machine, then transferred the HD to another machine, that might work.\nBut if you installed your OS using the disks that came with the machine, those disks are specific to the machine itself: they're streamlined with various drivers and whatnot, is my understanding, and will not work in another machine.\nI'd have to read up again in the CCC documentation but I believe there are also instances where files that are hard-coded with UUID's or MAC addresses or something that need to be properly re- created when moving a drive to another machine.\n", "Q: Problem with my applescript to export keynote files to powerpoint I've a big problem with an export applescript.

I am looking to confirm whether or not the iPhone 5's new 8-pin lighting connector when used in conjunction with the 5W USB power adapter that comes with the iPhone 5 charges the phone faster then previous iterations of the iPhone and their legacy 30-pin connector. I can go from a 12% remaning charge to a 53% charge in less than 60 minutes. This seems substantially faster than my previous iPhone's (4, 4s) with the legacy 30-pin connector. I understand that Lighting actually cable itself is obviously architecturally different but does the iPhone 5 itself have a different type of battery charging mechanism, the Lighting cable, or some combination therein?\n\nA: The charger supplies the power that is demanded from it (up to it's rated output), not the other way around.  So it's entirely possible that the same unit will charge different devices at different speeds.  It's entirely possible that a newer battery will charge faster than an identical but older battery, and also possible that the new phone is allowed to pull more charge because it runs a little cooler (charging generates heat, and one of the metrics for deciding how fast to charge is the heat generated as well as the batteries capacity to drink it up).\nBasically, it's really hard to measure, without you do a from flat to full charge with the same unit to different devices with batteries of the same age and condition.  Even then, be aware that the phone doesn't stop charing when it says 100%, that's an artificial figure and your phone will continue to charge a little (the equivalent of a little over 5% more logically speaking), then run from battery a little, then charge a little, then run from battery etc - this is to keep your battery in good condition (the same is true for 0%, it will go lower in order to perform a clean shutdown - the battery figures are only an indication, not an accurate gauge) - the actual methods for each device may also vary as to how they handle this.\n\nA: Nope. \nThe speed of the charge cycle depends upon the charger, not the cable. Either you are mistaken in your observations, or Apple put in a superior battery that charges faster.\nHere’s an experiment:\nTry charging your iPhone using an iPad charger. And try charging an iPad with an iPhone charger. You’ll see what I mean.

This was a known issue in ML, I would expect a fix at some point, but for now here are the few steps that I take that fixes it for awhile.None of this seems to be a \"permanent\" fix, but should last a bit longer.\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the folder in Mail that is missing items.\n\n*Select \"Mailbox\"\n\n*Select \"Rebuild\" from the bottom of the menu.\n\n\nOR...\nYou can rebuild the Envelope-Index by throwing it away, it's located at ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/\n\n\n*\n\n*Your Library folder is hidden by default. Select Finder (in the dock) > “Go to Folder” and then enter “~/Library.”\n\n*In ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData, delete any file that begins with “Envelope Index,” such as Envelope Index or Envelope Index-shm.\n\n*Mail will rebuild the Envelope index when it is reopened. It will take a few minutes to rebuild the entire index.\nIf you're using Office 365, I've had more success by disabling the \"Use Auto-Discover service\" on those mail clients that are misbehaving.\n\nA: That's an odd symptom, but troubleshooting Mail is fairly easy.\nYou can disconnect from the network and start the program. That isolates it from any server influence and you can see if messages draw and are downloaded. Next, you can run the connection doctor and the activity window (search for both from Mail's help menu) and most issues are quickly sorted with these two tools to show what is happening behind the scenes.\nIf that doesn't work, you can post a follow on or edit this to clarify what specifically is tripped up in this case. Hopefully it's a download issue where the client hasn't gotten a good message yet (and only downloaded the mail envelopes / subject and the presence of a message - but not the body of the messages).\n", "Q: Automator throws an error when trying to quit Mail.app I've created a calendar event in Automator that creates and sends an email message then quits Mail.

Everything works great when establishing the VPN connection via LAN or WLAN. However, when I use a dial-up connection (Huawei HSDPA USB Stick) host names are not correctly resolved in applications (e.g. Web-Browser). Command line tools like host name will correctly resolve the IP address, ping name will not resolve.\nUsing scutil --dns I dumped the DNS configuration when connecting via WLAN vs. dial-up. There is a notable difference in the lookup order:\nconnecting using WLAN:\n\nresolver #1\n  nameserver[0] : 192.168.80.10\n  nameserver[1] : 192.168.80.24\n  if_index : 6 (ppp0)\n  reach    : Reachable,Transient Connection\n  order    : 100000\n\nresolver #2\n  nameserver[0] : 192.168.80.10\n  nameserver[1] : 192.168.80.24\n  if_index : 6 (ppp0)\n  reach    : Reachable,Transient Connection\n  order    : 200000\n\nresolver #3\n  domain   : local\n  options  : mdns\n  timeout  : 5\n  order    : 300000\n\nresolver #4\n  domain   : 254.169.in-addr.arpa\n  options  : mdns\n  timeout  : 5\n  order    : 300200\n\nresolver #5\n  domain   : 8.e.f.ip6.arpa\n  options  : mdns\n  timeout  : 5\n  order    : 300400\n\nresolver #6\n  domain   : 9.e.f.ip6.arpa\n  options  : mdns\n  timeout  : 5\n  order    : 300600\n\nresolver #7\n  domain   : a.e.f.ip6.arpa\n  options  : mdns\n  timeout  : 5\n  order    : 300800\n\nresolver #8\n  domain   : b.e.f.ip6.arpa\n  options  : mdns\n  timeout  : 5\n  order    : 301000\n\nDNS configuration (for scoped queries)\n\nresolver #1\n  nameserver[0] : 192.168.1.1\n  if_index : 4 (en0)\n  flags    : Scoped\n  reach    : Reachable,Directly Reachable Address\n\nresolver #2\n  nameserver[0] : 192.168.80.10\n  nameserver[1] : 192.168.80.24\n  if_index : 6 (ppp0)\n  flags    : Scoped\n  reach    : Reachable,Transient Connection\n\nThe ppp0 connection is the VPN connection.

From the response times of the commands (using the non-existing hostname foo.bar.local) I infer that ping uses the first resolver chain, where as host uses the scoped query configuration. ping takes 5 seconds to return \"Unkown host\", hostgets back immediately. I assume ping runs into the 5 second timeout of the mdns resolver.\nIn order to fix my problem with the broken DNS lookups when dialing in via VPN over modem I need to change the order of the resolvers. So far I have not found a way of doing this. \nAny ideas welcome.\n\nA: This is still happening in 10.13.0\nI have opened a bug report with Apple. It's not normal that \"ping internalhostname\" works but \"host internalhostname\" or \"nslookup internalhostname\" fails with split tunnel VPNs (Cisco IPSec based or IKEv2).\nAlso, as some have noticed, Cisco IPsec connections as well as IKEv2 connections can not be prioritized with \"Set service order\" unlike L2TP/IPsec which can. \nAnother point I'd like to bring up is that split tunnel Cisco IPSec or IKEv2 VPNs do not show any DNS servers or Search Domains in their Advanced settings even though this information does show up with \"scutil --dns\". L2TP/IPsec VPNs does show this information just fine.\nSomething has to give and Apple needs to provide some explanation/fix.\n\nA: I had the same issue for long time, but now I had time to find a solution that works for me. I didn't change the order of the DNS server, but I'm using the DNS server behind the VPN permanently.\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect via dial-up.\n\n*Connect the VPN connection and copy the DNS server IPs and the search domain from\nVPN Connection → Advanced → DNS.\n\n*Disconnect the VPN connection.\n\n*Ping <name> or <hostname> of your VPN server and write down the IP.\n\n*Disconnect the dial-up connection.\n\n*Duplicate the dial-up connection (e.g. name it \"3G for VPN\").\n\n*Enter the IPs and the search domain into the DNS tab of the dial-up connection. They will be stored and used permanently.\n\n*Connect via the new dial-up connection.\n\n*Now you have no access to the nameservers (because they are secured by the VPN) - you have to edit the server address of the VPN connection. Replace the host by the IP.\n\n*Connect via VPN connection and you should be able to use it.\nNote: In general hostnames does not change, but IPs can. So if it's not working someday, do the steps again…\n\nA: I found a workaround: your VPN DNS will still be ignored, and only 3G-dongle DNS will be used, but just adding your VPN DNS to the list under 3G interface does the trick… The main problem is that 3G connectivity manager overwrites configuration everytime you click connect, and you need connectivity manager to enable Radio on the 3G dongle… so I mixed both solutions in one:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect to your VPN and write down your DNS (I have 2 on the list). You can check it in Network Preferences → Advanced → DNS tab. Disconnect VPN. You need to connect to VPN because DNS is assigned dynamically upon connection…\n\n*Connect to your 3G and do the same: write the DNS on paper. Then disconnect 3G.\n\n*Go to Network Preferences → click on 3G interface → Advanced → DNS Tab, and under DNS table (that typically will be empty as you are not connected) click on '+'. Add all the DNS servers (those from 3G first and then add VPN later). Click OK and Apply.\n\n*From now on, to connect to 3G, just plug your USB and wait until you have 3G coverage (you will need to open 3G connectivity manager), but do not use the supplied connectivity manager to connect. And if it automatically connects, go to preferences and uncheck that tick. You need that manager only to turn radio on in the USB Dongle, nothing else.\nIf you click on \"connect\" on your 3G manager, it will overwrite configuration on your 3G interface and you need to repeat step 3 again.\n\n*Go to Network → Preferences and click on the 3G interface. Then click connect. It will connect to your 3G using the configured DNS servers (instead of dynamically received), that include both the \"public\" DNS and your VPN DNS.\n\n*Connect to your VPN. It will work as expected.\nJust be aware that:\n\n\n*\n\n*If your VPN DNS changes, you need to change it manually. This can easily be checked under Network → VPN interface w Advanced → DNS tab since your VPN DNS is still assigned dynamically to the interface (although ignored by OS X).\n\n*If your 3G DNS changes (unlikely) you need to change it manually too. If something goes wrong and you cannot navigate you need to go through your 3G connectivity manager, click \"Connect\" and see what DNS are dynamically assigned… That will require you to go back to step 3 and reconfigure it.\n\nA: I had the same problem on my Mac, and after fixing it I have figured out that it was caused by FortiClient (VPN client). Even when FortiClient was disconnected - it's DNS still appeared in the scutil.\nThe solution for me was:\nscutil\n> list \".*DNS\"\n\nThis will show you a list of all DNS configs, that will look something like:\nsubKey [0] = State:/Network/Global/DNS <br>\nsubKey [1] = State:/Network/MulticastDNS<br>\nsubKey [2] = State:/Network/OpenVPN/DNS<br>\nsubKey [3] = State:/Network/OpenVPN/OldDNS<br>\nsubKey [4] = State:/Network/PrivateDNS<br>\nsubKey [5] = State:/Network/Service/forticlientsslvpn/DNS <br>\n\nTo check each of them run: (until you find the problematic one)\n> get key_name\n> d.show\n\n…and to fix it run:\n> get key_name\n> d.remove ServerAddresses\n> set key_name\n\nThis is how it looked on my machine:\n> get State:/Network/Service/forticlientsslvpn/DNS \n> d.show\n<dictionary> {\n  ServerAddresses : <array> {\n    0 : 192.168.30.6\n    1 : 192.168.30.15\n  }\n  SupplementalMatchDomains : <array> {\n    0 :\n  }\n  SupplementalMatchOrders : <array> {\n    0 : 100000\n  }\n}\n> d.remove ServerAddresses\n> d.show\n<dictionary> {\n  SupplementalMatchDomains : <array> {\n    0 :\n  }\n  SupplementalMatchOrders : <array> {\n    0 : 100000\n  }\n}\n> set State:/Network/Service/forticlientsslvpn/DNS\n> exit\n\n\nA: Try changing the order of the DNS entries in the Network preference pane:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences → Network.\n\n*Select your network service in the list on the left.\n\n*Unlock the preference pane using the lock in the bottom-left corner.\n\n*Click Advanced… and choose the DNS tab.\n\n*Change the order of the DNS servers by dragging them up/down.\n\n\nA: what you said gave me a hint, so I've added the dns ip in the vpn connection to the dns list in the main connection (nothing fancy, just using the graphical interface for Network preferences.) I'm not sure if what you are dealing with is different, but it worked with me.\n\nA: Does not work in Lion / Mountain Lion, due to a bug which causes the local DNS Server beeing always used instead of the DNS server of the remote network even when Split DNS is correnctly setup in the VPN router.\nHowever, if you use a Cisco ASA IPSEC router, you can force the remote DNS Servers to be used whenever you establish a VPN connection:\nIf using Cisco ASDM, go to \nConfiguration > Network (Client) Access > Group Policies > (your vpn group for OSX/iPhones) > Advanced > Split Tunneling\nThere set:\nDNS Names (uncheck \"inherit\" and define the internal dns domain names, e.g. myoffice.local)\nSend All DNS Lookups Throug Tunnel: Set to YES (This is the important setting)\nSave it and don't forget to store in the flash for future use.\nIf you use the IOS command line, set:\ngroup-policy <your-tunnel-group-name> attributes\n split-dns value myoffice.local\n split-tunnel-all-dns enable`\n\n\nA: You can fix this by adjusting the service order of the network connections. Move VPN to the top of the list and the resolver order will follow.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/PH14006\n\nContent of link found at https://web.archive.org/web/20170828193724/https://support.apple.com/kb/PH14006?locale=en_US   and duplicated here:\n\nOS X Mavericks: Change the priority of your network connections\nThis article has been archived and is no longer updated by Apple.\nIf you connect to the Internet or a network in several different ways (using Wi-Fi or Ethernet, for example), you can change the order of the network port configurations your computer tries when connecting to the Internet or network.\nIf there are multiple active network port configurations when you try to connect, OS X tries the one at the top of the list first, then tries the other port configurations in descending order.\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose Apple menu > System Preferences, then click Network.\n\n*Choose Set Service Order from the Action pop-up menu.

For example (still assuming a 40-column terminal), 4 tabs puts the cursor at position 32 of line 1.  Another tab should put the cursor at position 0 of line 2, but instead the cursor is at position 39 of line 1, leaving room for one more character to be printed—and even at that point, the cursor is not advanced to the next line, so another tab will put us back to position 39.

I'd be much obliged, as this bug is making it might tricky to debug some home-made shell scripts running on tab-separated files.\n\nA: This has to do with line breaks. Terminal is looking for either a space, or a continuos string of characters to make a line break. In this case the first opportunity it sees to break the line is between the y and the o. The \"y\" is shown because the last character in an extended line is shown in the last place to hint the user that something is happening there.\nWorkarounds...\nYou could try:\necho -e \"a \\tb \\tc \\td \\te \\tf \\tg \\tyo\"\n\nand everything will appear as you'd expect it.\nalso something like\necho -e \"ab\\tcd\\tef\\tgh\\tij\\tkl\\tmn\\tyo\"\n\nshould break between the \"k\" and \"l\"\nStill this is odd behavior and defiantly worth a bug/radar report\n", "Q: pinch to zoom with magic mouse in Mountain Lion I am unable to \"pinch-to-zoom\" on my magic mouse in mountain lion.

The remote screen sharing feature of OS X is extremely convenient.  I can access my office machine from home when I need some software that can only be installed on on-campus computers.\nHowever, I noticed that if I log in to the office machine through screen sharing, everything I see on the shared screen is also mirrored on the machine's physical screen. Logging in using screen sharing unlocks the machine's physical keyboard and mouse as well.\nIs it possible to avoid this security risk if someone can see or manipulate my Mac while I am not in the office?  \nIs it possible to access a remote computer through a graphical interface (not terminal) without exposing directly that machine to anyone who is in the office at that time? Of course they could steal the machine, but I don't want them snooping on grades or email or whatever when I unlock the screen remotely to access the Mac.\n\nA: Yes - there are several ways around this. \nThe free, but less elegant solution is to make a second account on the Mac you wish to keep private. Set the machine to boot to that user and use Fast User switching to switch to your account. \nThen when you log in - it will ask if you want to share the dummy account's screen or make a second virtual (and not drawn on the monitor) screen.\nAlternatively, buy Apple Remote Desktop and use the \"curtain mode\" where it obscures the screen to hide what the remote operator is doing.\n", "Q: Multi-Monitor Mac -- Possible to keep one screen static in Mission Control? I have a rMBP and a Thunderbolt display, and I love using both displays simultaneously.

I'd like to leave things like chat windows open there that I would like to be present in every workspace.\nIs there any way to make this possible?\nIt is really annoying to not be able to keep one screen from switching.\nThanks!\n\nA: Unfortunately I'm not aware of anything that can do what you're looking for. Mission Control is fairly limited in the ways in which you can customize it, either through the user interface or for developers. Similarly, OS X is pretty constrained in how you can configure multiple monitors (sadly, it's actually regressed a bit in this regard since 10.6).\nYou can set an app to appear in all spaces by right clicking its Dock icon, and selecting Assign To: All Desktops under the Options sub-menu. However this applies to all windows for that app, regardless of what monitor they're on. But if you keep all your iChat/Messages windows on your second display, it may be useful.\n\nA: There's actually a way to do with a third party app. There's an app called Afloat.\nInstall it, restart your computer and when you return, the Window menu will contain the Afloat options. Afloat is mainly for keeping an app on top at all times, but it has an option in the Adjust Effects menu that allows you to Keep this window on the screen on all Spaces.  Check this box and when you switch desktops on one screen, while the desktop will change on the other screen, you still won't lose your window cuz that app will be on the other desktop also.\n\nA: There is an option for this as of OS X Yosemite.\nApple menu > System Preferences > Mission Control\nIf you enable \"Displays have separate Spaces,\" then you will be able to have just a sintgle \"space\" for your extra monitor.\nhttps://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/os-x-how-to-use-separate-spaces-with-multiple-monitors\n\nA: You can specify which desktop - or select All Desktops from Options for the Application(s) from the Dock.

Most important thing, still, is to make sure that is off.\nThis may or may not do the trick for you. I get the feeling this switch was designed more for the retail emails that are sent out - full HTML with tons of images.\nHave you performed your test with a PDF file? By default iOS creates an icon for you to tap before it downloads the attachment. It is possible this switch is on, and it is downloading images.\nIf the afore-mentioned ideas don't work, would it be possible to not open emails that have the paperclip icon next to the Subject/Sender, and instead wait until you were on a wifi? This could protect from data usage, however, if you must receive large quantities of large attachments for a specific purpose this may not be practical.\n", "Q: Can't disable FaceTime auto-answering A couple months ago I took a trip out of town, so I set FaceTime on my Mac to auto-answer calls from a specific email address of mine.

Look for any files that start with \"com.apple.facetime\" and move them to another folder (for backup purposes).\nOpen FaceTime back up, check your preferences, and see if the Auto-Accept continues to occur.\n\nA: defaults write com.apple.FaceTime AutoAcceptInvites -bool false\n\nfound this here:  http://krypted.com/mac-os-x/accepting-always-on-facetime-calls/\n\nA: Rather than deleting the key entirely, try setting it to an empty array:\ndefaults write com.apple.FaceTime AutoAcceptInvitesFrom -array-add nil\n\n", "Q: iPad 3 used up 250 MB of LTE data in 3 hours without active usage This morning I purchased 250MB of data from AT&T ahead of the auto-renewal schedule because I had used it up two weeks back. I then checked a few emails without downloading attachments and rode to work. Didn't use the iPad at work, though it would have WiFi there anyway.\nAbout 2 hours after the purchase I receive the usual \"only 20% of data left\" email and am astounded by that, but go to lunch anyway. When I return from work I have the 10%, 2% and no data left email in my inbox.\nI have iCloud Documents (though I only have a few of them), FaceTime and Reading List activated over cellular, but not iTunes. The iPad had been synced the night before, I was not signed in to Skype or similar and I actually didn't use it.\nAnybody an idea what might have caused this??\n\nI talked to the AT&T help line and all he was able to see is that the data was consumed in 5-6 bursts, not tickling over the three hours. But which service, no idea. I'll visit an Apple Store and check with them, maybe they have means to determine what went awry.\n\nA: If you use Photostream or iTunesMatch there is a good chance that one of the two uses cellular data unexpectedly. As far as I remember there was a problem (before iOS 6) with syncing these two services: when you started the sync in WiFi mode and then switched to cellular (e.g. because of leaving from home), the sync would continue independent of the setting disallowing usage of cellular.\n", "Q: Can I play chess on my Mac from the command line? If I were feeling insufficiently geekish on any particular day, and thus found the GUI Chess App to lack an appropriate amount of tech credibility, is there a way to play chess on my Mac from the command line?\n\nA: Yes! The OS X Chess app relies on the sjeng engine, which has a command line version. Type /Applications/Chess.app/Contents/Resources/sjeng.ChessEngine and press enter to play:\n\nMake moves with the coordinates of the origin and destination you want: e1e4 moves the piece at e1 to e4.\nSjeng doesn't take any command line arguments, but you can edit the config file (stored in /Applications/Chess.app/Contents/Resources/sjeng.rc). This will probably mess with your settings in the GUI Chess app; make a backup before editing.\n", "Q: Remap command-arrow key to the same as ctrl-arrow keys (moving by word) I would like to be able to use Command arrow keys to navigate by word like you can with Option. I've disabled the Mission Control mappings already. What's the easiest way to remap?\n\nA: You can change the default keybindings for OS X text editing with the DefaultKeyBinding.dict file. Make a new text file at ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict, with these contents:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>^&#xF702;</key>\n    <string>moveWordLeft:</string>\n    <key>^&#xF703;</key>\n    <string>moveWordRight:</string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nRestart or log out and in, and controlleft and controlright should do what you're looking for. This will work in most OS X apps, but there are some (typically third party text editors) that use their own bindings, which will need to be switched on a case-by-case basis.\n", "Q: Get notified when battery is charged Is there a way to write a custom apple script or any other way to get a Alert or Desktop notification when the battery on my Macbook Pro reaches a certain percentage of charge?\n\nA: This app is a free replacement for the standard battery menu bar item, and it includes the ability to set notifications (in Notification Center) when the battery hits certain percentages.\nAlternatively, if you want to rig your own solution, you can get charging status and percentage from running pmset -g batt in the shell. You'd need to poll it rather than getting notified however. If you're comfortable with programming, the IOPowerSources API looks like it can do notifications when the battery/charging status changes, but obviously that's more involved.\n", "Q: Corrupted .mp4 File from iPhone 4 Weather Balloon Launch We recently launched a weather balloon into space which used an Apple iPhone 4 as a camera. In any case, though, we have about 8 minutes of corrupted video footage in the form of an .mp4 file (the last 8 minutes of footage, that is. The other ~4-5 hours were completely intact). We believe there must be a way to salvage some video from this file. As such, we would like to ask if anyone can help us salvage this video file. Thank you very much for your time, advice, and/or help. \nhttp://www.mediafire.com/?o00mz0ke2his991\n\nA: Good news! It's repairable. \nI ran it through this repair utility: \nhttp://grauonline.de/cmsimple2_6/en/?Solutions:HD_Video_Repair_Utility\nI only have the demo version so I could only preview about 3 minutes of the video, but it looks like that tool will work well with your file. \n", "Q: how might one spoof geographic location on a desktop Mac I use a social network site that attaches location information to posts made on iPhones or MacBooks. When I post from my desktop, no GPS information is available and this field is left blank (there is no provision for user-entered data, unfortunately). Is there some way to spoof GPS on a desktop Mac?\n\nA: Is this site web based? Or app based?\nIf this is a web based service one idea that might work is to change your user agent in your web browser. For example, in Safari there is Develop menu that you can activate via the Advanced tab under Preferences:\n\nOnce activated, go to to the Develop menu and choose the User Agent option. There is a nice preset list of common user agents. So in this case just change it to one of the mobile device options like Safari iOS7 — iPhone:\n\nNow with that done, go to the site in question, login & see how the site reacts. Mind you this is simply a brainstorming idea of a tact to spoof a mobile device. For all you—or we—know the site in question does server based geolocation based on IP address or just reacts differently from a real mobile device. And if that is the case, chance are you are out of luck.\nBut the choice of how/when geolocation data is added to a site is really based on the site owner’s preference in most cases and not controllable by end user interaction.\n\nA: Mountain Lion comes with Localization Services which enables applications and websites to gather and use information regarding your current location. This location is determined using the information of your local Wi-Fi network.\nTo enable it just go to System Preferences / Security & Privacy / Privacy and check the Enable Location Services checkbox.\nApplications to which you have granted the permission to use the Location Services will be shown in this panel. Each application will display, too, if it is turned on or off with a checkbox.\nUnder the Safari privacy preferences you can find different options for limiting websites access to the localization feature. \n\nA: Many such sites do not rely on the client device to tell their location (as they tend to be web-based anyway, and there is no easy weay to tell a browser to reveal its location) - they will get the geo information from the IP address you are using to connect. In this case, the best way to spoof your location is to use a VPN/tunnel service that exists for this purpose.\nThese tunnels usually exist to give people access to services (such as Netflix, etc.) that require you to be in a certain country in order to function.\n", "Q: What does the clear key do on Apple's numpad? Apple has a keyboard with a numpad. What does the clear key on the top left of the numpad do? Is it different from the delete key, if so, how is it different?\n\n\nA: The standard OS X behaviour is for it to act similar to a delete key, but only when text is selected. It won't delete forwards or backwards like the standard delete keys. It also acts as a standard clear button in the Calculator app. This can vary by app however - in Excel for example, it functions identically to the backspace key.\n\nA: I just found out by accident that it is also equivalent to clicking the cancel button on dialogs.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 3.1 internal (replacement) LCD not detected by graphics card; external monitor OK My MacBook Pro (2.4 Ghz, Santa Rosa with infamous nVidia card) acts strange. I replaced a cracked screen with a new and since then I have been loosing my mind over this problem:It shows the normal gray screen with Apple logo and animation flawlessly during start up but the internal display goes black without any rendering at all when all is loaded. (shining a light on display show nothing) If an external monitor is connected through the DVI port it will remain black during start up and then show the desktop as the internal display goes black. This happens both while booting to Mountain Lion and Windows XP. I have checked \"About my Mac\" and only the external display is listed. The same is the case if I use the nVidia Control panel in Windows XP. The mirroring works in Windows XP although with distortion.\nMy questions: Is this a hardware problem or is it related to software maybe even firmware? What controls the display during start up, graphics card or something else?\n\nA: This sounds like a hardware issue, but there might be a few things you can try.\nI would boot the mac with the cmd+v keys to show a verbose output. If this doesn't work, you could try resetting the NVRAM/PRAM (docs can be easily found on the apple site)\nIf you don't see the Internal Display in the about my mac app, the Display Data cable might be improperly seated. There is a fairly good tutorial on iFixit.com http://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Installing-MacBook-Pro-15-Inch-Core-2-Duo-Models-A1226-and-A1260-Display-Data-Cable/1312/1\n", "Q: Why does my iPhone 4S go blank due to over heating? My iPhone 4S is just 2 weeks old and since the last week it enters this weird mode where the screen goes blank and I can't access the phone, but if someone tries to call me, it rings, proving that the phone isn't turned off.\nThe store guy said that it's happening because Im using the phone too much which is causing the phone to overheat and go on a sleep mode.\nMy phone goes on this wierd sleep mode atleast twice in a day! Even during the night!  What can I do?\n\nA: The store guy is telling you crap, there is no such thing as a sleep mode that would exhibit the symptoms you describe.

Adapter runs fine on first connect. If unplugged and plugged in again it will not work unless I reboot. Best solution I found is to reload the driver by hand. That saves you at least the reboot.\nsudo kextunload -b com.asix.driver.ax88179_178a\nsudo kextload -b com.asix.driver.ax88179_178a\n\nIf your driver has a slightly different name (for whatever reason) you can look it up with:\nkextstat |grep asix\n\n\nA: If you have the Android File Transfer app installed, try removing it - that made the 1.3 drivers work for me, including disconnecting and reconnecting (through a USB 3.0 hub) without a reboot\n", "Q: Accidently deleted a hidden file I accidentally deleted the .localized file from my mac desktop and then emptied my trash. How to I recover it?\n\nA: Did it make any problems to your system?\n\nThe \".localized\" files simply contain user language dependent data.\n  This allows the Finder to display localized folder and file names. A\n  good example of this is the \"Applications\" folder, which on the file\n  system is called \"Applications\" but magically appears to the user with\n  a localized name (e.g. \"Applicazioni\" in Italian).\n\nTo restore it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the terminal\n\n*\n\n*Type defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE\n\n*Type killall Finder\n\n\n*Open the finder and go to the Desktop folder\n\n*Start Time Machine\n\n*Use Time Machine for restoring the .localized file\n\n*Open the terminal\n\n*\n\n*Type defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE\n\n*Type killall Finder\nSkip steps 1 and 5 if you already see the hidden files in Finder and you like it.\n\nA: .localized are zero bytes files stored in several folders as simple placeholders, which tells Finder that folders are \"localizable\". The '.localized' file indicates (just by its presence) that apps should display \"localized\" name for a given folder if one was defined.\nTherefore to recover it you may simply find '.localized' file in any other location and copy it to your desktop. Simplest case may be to issue the following command in a terminal window:\ncp /Users/.localized /Users/{Your User Name Here}/Desktop/\n\n", "Q: How to keep images in Mail for offline reading? For example:I subscribe emails to Huffington Post,and they send daily mails.How can I keep images in those mails so I can read them offline?\n\nA: Under Mail / Preferences / Accounts and selecting your account and then Advanced, you'll find an option to Keep copies of message for offline viewing. \nJust choose All messages and their attachments.\n\n", "Q: Can iCloud notes be synced with different accounts? Is it possible to synchronize notes with different accounts? For example, if I write something in my notes - my friend will open his notes with his account and see the change.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: No, iCloud was not meant to work that way. \nSome third party Apps, though, will do exactly what you're looking for. AppCrawlr has got an interesting list, which might be worth looking at.\n", "Q: Unable to download podcast after iTunes previously crashed while downloading it I subscribe to a podcast with weekly episodes.\nWhile downloading one episode of the podcast, iTunes crashed. Now I cannot download that episode anymore - if I try to, it errors with the (!) symbol next to it. I can download any other episode of the podcast without issues.\nI tried to unsubscribe from the podcast and re-subscribe, hoping it would fix the problem. But I still cannot download that episode.\nAny ideas how I can make iTunes forget about the failed download and let me get that episode again?\n\nA: Go to folder where you store podcast episodes you've subcribed to. (By default it's something like \"itunes\" folder in \"mymusic\" folder). \nSearch for folder named \"Downloads\". That folder is used for storing temporary files while downloading particulary episode, and it should be empty. \nIf ITunes crashes, some parts of the episode remain in this folder and that's causing the problem you encountered. If happens that there are some folders or files with .tmp extension, delete them and then try again to download particular episode.\n", "Q: Remote desktop to Mac with broken graphics card We have a mac with a broken graphicscard (Lots of stripes etc.)\nIs there some way to run it remotely without being disturbed by the graphics card?\nThis is a iMac G5 (PowerPC with everything in the screen).\nThe question is more for apps than the whole desktop.\n\nA: Screen Sharing can be enabled via the terminal : sudo sh -c \"/bin/echo -n enabled > /Library/Preferences/com.apple.ScreenSharing.launchd\"\nI have had the AppleVNC service freak out because it couldn't determine the clients screen resolution.\n\nA: Enable Desktop Sharing and use a VNC client to connect to it.\nThe VNC client built into OS X itself is very good and give good updates, so use that if you use another Mac for this.\n", "Q: How to clear browser cache for just one specific site in Mobile Safari? I'm doing some testing on a mobile site in development and there are many updates and changes happening to this site. In order to test afresh and clear any JavaScript or what-not that is held in the cache on my iPhone I need to clear the site from the history.\nHowever, i'm not too keen on wiping all my browser history as I don't want to have re-sign into every site I'm currently logged into or have cookies for. This testing could last several months and the thought of having to clear my history and sign into all my various accounts every time is not that appealing.\nIs there a way to specifically clear out the history of just one domain from my history without wiping all my cache out?\nI could (and do) have other browsers on my iPhone (chrome, opera - if that even counts as a browser) but as Safari is the browser the target audience will mostly use I need to keep with this one predominantly.\n\nA: I don't know if this is exactly what you want, but if you open Settings, then click on Safari, then scroll down and click on Advanced, then click on Website Data you will get a list of websites that have stored data. You can click Edit then remove the data from just the sites that you want to remove stored data from.\n\nA: You could also use this in the browswer, ?nocache=1 behing the URL. example www.constructivworks.com/?nocache=1\nThis should clear the cache specifically on the site you have open in that specific tab. \nHope this helps! \n\nA: My version of Andre and Gary's answer; \njavascript:window.location.replace(window.location.origin+\"/?nocache=1\")\n\n\nA: To clear cookies for a specific site on Chrome for iOS\n\n\n*\n\n*Save any site as a Bookmark via 3-dot menu at top right     \n\n*Rename Bookmark to something like “Clear Site Cookies”   \n\n*Copy/paste the below code below as the URL\n\n\nNow just visit any site, pull up your bookmarks and click on the bookmark we just made.

I'm  new to OS X, I was using Ubuntu till now. All my data are stored on an external drive formated as ext4 system file. Is there any other way to acces this data than installing Virtual Box? I'm using OS X 10.8.2.\nI was trying solution form How can I mount an ext4 file system on OS X?\nTerminal output:\nMacBook-Pro-Marek:Downloads user$ ./ext4fuse-24810919 /dev/disk1 Linux\ndyld: Library not loaded: /opt/local/lib/libfuse.2.dylib\nReferenced from: /Users/user/Downloads/./ext4fuse-24810919\nReason: image not found\nTrace/BPT trap: 5\n\nI was trying also this, with the same result (dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/lib/libfuse.2.dylib)\nI found also this, where it's said that most of available solutions don't work for Lion, but this solution says how to mount ext2 or ext3 file system, and not ext4. \nI don't know how should I load this library and if the problem is in the library or the solutions which don't work for my OS X distribution.\nThanks\n\nA: Instead of installing ext4fuse yourself, try using homebrew to install it. (This is the method recommended by the developer.)\nRead the developer's install page here.\nIncidentally, if you're from Linux you're probably used to using apt-get to install things. Homebrew describes itself as \"The missing package manager for OS X\", and makes it a lot easier to install a lot of linux ports. (For example, brew install ext4fuse will install ext4fuse. The advantage of homebrew is that it will automatically download and install dependencies for you.\n", "Q: iPhone 5 screen does not activate after a phone call One of the permanent features on an iPhone turns off the screen (display and the touch receptors) when during a phone call you press the screen against your ears and cheek. The screen would almost instantaneously turn itself completely \"on\" when the phone would move away from the cheek and ears.\nThis at least was the case before iPhone 5. On my iPhone 5, the screen sometimes does not turn off or turn back on. I can confirm that iOS6 has nothing to do with this --my old iPhone 3GS on iOS6 does not face this problem.\nFollowing the recommendations of this post, I went to the Apple Store but they just replaced my iPhone 5 when I demo'd the problem to them. The new iPhone 5 unfortunately has the same problem --even with factory settings.\nDoes anyone know of a way to solve this problem or am I just unlucky to get two defective iPhone 5s in a row and should try my luck again?\nP.S.:- I am not using any cases, covers, screen coats or any other accessories.\n\nA: Sadly - you might need to take it back. The proximity sensor is a small part and if it doesn't sense that your head/ear/face has moved away from the receiver slot - the screen will not light up again.\nYou can save yourself a trip by backing it up (yet again) and restoring it in iTunes  - but it seems you have already ruled that out.\nOne thing I have seen in practice is that some people's ears have openings large enough for the proximity sensor to sense the space when the phone is pressed next to their ear as actually being away from an object.\nAgain, it's often best to lie the phone flat on the table and call some sort of automated help system and use a pencil eraser or your finger to test how and where your particular sensor is sensitive. Once you've spent a handful of minutes discovering how narrow the beam is and exactly how many mm the range is to engage and disengage the sensor, can you take it in for service and know the unit you have is working according to specifications.\n\nA: Just disable Auto Brightness and turn off raise to speak on Siri. and reboot your device. That should get you by until apple can include the fix in an update. \nPeace. \n\nA: In my case neither auto brightness nor raise to speak had nothing to do with the issue. I just tried turning them off and the problem was still there.\nWhat I finally did was to turn off the video function of an app that I downloaded from Cydia (vWallpaper2) and which may have had a conflict with the proximity sensor. Result: iPhone 5 is back to normal, sensor is working again! \n\nA: It was the proximity sensor and/or light sensor next to the front camera that has the problem we suspect\n", "Q: iPhone 4S keeps old numbers in Messages The numbers that are no longer in my contacts still keep popping up when I try to compose a new message. \nWhy is this happening?

I'm not quite sure what aspects of Windows CrossOver emulates (it's not a full Windows kernel after all), and whether scanner support is possible.\nI am aware of the \"normal\" way to do this - using VirtualBox to set up a virtual machine with Windows XP in it. This is the way I will go if all else fails; using CrossOver would just be so much more convenient than setting up a full Windows machine....\n\nThe scanner is old, but high-quality and huge (A3 Format), so buying a new one isn't really an option.\n\nA: CrossOver doesn't emulate or simulate hardware - it just translates a subset of the Windows API - just enough to fool normal apps. You'll want something like VirtualBox, Parallels or VMWare Fusion to scan directly into Windows.\nSince VirtualBox is free, start there and then spend money on a commercial solution if or when your time becomes more scarce than your budget.\n", "Q: Can the Eclipse emulator be made less blurry when run on retina Mac hardware?

However, things are blurry in the Android Emulator. \n\nWhat can I do to fix the blurriness of the emulator window?\n\nA: Eclipse's text is high resolution because it is drawn by OS X's APIs. I assume the emulator is simulating the actual resolution of the device, so it might not be able to run at retina resolution.\nYou can increase the screen's resolution to make the problem less noticeable. Go to System Preferences > Display and select Scaled.

Thank You.\nActions Taken\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset PRAM and NVRAM\n\n*Wiped Internal Hard Drive\n\n\nA: There is a huge list of things which can be wrong here:\n\n\n*\n\n*It sounds like you don't have the original install DVDs that came with the MBP (MacBook Pro). If you have an external DVD drive available to you then I would suggest running the Apple Hardware Test version 3A171 that came on the original install discs with that model.\n\n*\n*\n\n*You managed to clone the version of Snow Leopard DVD that you have to a USB drive. I assume you didn't use the faulty DVD drive to do this?\n\n*Also you need a retail version of Snow Leopard (barring the original install discs), if you have the packaging, then you could see if it has the green dot that says 10.6.3 on the front of the box. You cannot use the original release of the retail Snow Leopard install DVD as your computer probably does not support even a minor version of the OS older than it shipped with (which was 10.6.3). If you're not sure, when you boot up from the install USB check on the \"About This Mac...\" menu item under the apple, or put in the machine you used to clone the drive and navigate to it and look at the read me files.\n\n*Also, note that a DVD that came with another computer, unless it's the same model as yours, will not work to install. So, if you took the install DVD from even the first release cycle of a Mid 2010 Mac Mini that had 10.6.3 on it, it still will not install on your machine.\n\n\n*Just this week I opened up a machine and it a) had a bad Hard Disk Drive, b) had a dirty/faulty Optical Disc Drive (aka Superdrive, dvd/cd drive, etc.) and that was possibly ejecting discs from a stuck trackpad clicker c) would not boot up from a USB Installer of OS X Lion until I removed the faulty Hard Disk Drive!\nSo, you should use the \"Disk Utility\" Program under the \"Utilities…\" menu in the installer to run the \"Verify Disk\" action on the internal Hard Disk of the MacBook Pro (aka MBP). Because, it just might be that the Hard Disk you are trying to reinstall on is bad! \n\n*You might also have a bad, corrupted USB drive, I would use whatever other machine is at your disposal and run verify disk on the USB drive as well. If none of the other things seem to work then I would even erase and Reformat the USB drive as HFS+, then clone the Snow Leopard install DVD back onto it.\nAlso, I have had a scratched Install DVD that of course wouldn't work, this can translate to files not coming over to your USB drive properly.\n\n*If this is a backup copy of the Snow Leopard DVD there is a much greater chance of something going wrong with DVD. If memory serves correct, you actually need a DVD-R DL, known as a \"Dual Layer\" disc to make a backup copy of Snow Leopard. It can't be a DVD+R DL (notice the \"+\" symbol\") known as a \"Double Layer\" disc.

We have a Mac Pro running Lion that ha no screen attached.  It is set up so it can be accessed using screen sharing (VNC).  It works with a 800 by 600 resolution.\nHow can I change the resolution while being connected using screen sharing?\nWhen I use display preferences to change the resolution while being connected using screen sharing, this is what happens:  I get a dialog saying that if the resolution change didn't work, the system will revert it in 15 seconds.  Then the screen freezes (nothing changes and it doesn't appear to react to clicks).  Finally after 15 seconds it reverts to 800 by 600.\n\nA: There is a very cool command line utility called cscreen. The developer has a number of versions available. Depending on how old your Mac is, you either want the PPC version, or the Intel version. If your Mac is newer than a 2006 model, you probably want the Intel version.\nOnce you have downloaded the disk image, double click the image to mount it, then copy the cscreen file to anywhere except the disk image. Now open Terminal. (You can search for it in Spotlight.) Once Terminal is open, you can run cscreen by navigating to it, then typing ./cscreen. For example, if you copied cscreen to your Desktop, you would navigate to the Desktop in Terminal by typing cd ~/Desktop. Once there, you would type ./cscreen.\nTo change the resolution, we first need to know what resolutions are possible. To find out, we can type ./cscreen -v. This should output something like this:\n\nNow we can choose a resolution. Assuming you want 32 bit colour depth, you can change to the resolution of your choice by typing \ncscreen -i <DisplayID> -d 32 -x <width> -y <height>, \nand replacing the parts enclosed in <> with the actual values. I haven't tested this with a headless system over VNC, so your milage may vary. The command line option -i <DisplayID> is optional, so if your VNC doesn't register a display ID you may still be able to change the resolution if you omit that part of the command.\n", "Q: \"This version of OSX is not supported on this platform.\" when booting 2012 Mac Mini with SSD drive from previous system When trying to boot a 2012 Mac Mini (purchased from apple.com) with the SSD drive from my previous system (a 2009 MBP), I get \"This version of OSX is not supported on this platform\". The version of OSX is Mountain Lion with the latest updates. I have attempted another drive from another system, and this wont boot on the Mac Mini either. Just for comparison, I can boot the 2009 MBP with the disk that came with the Mac Mini just fine, and that disk still boots on the Mac Mini as well. My question is, how can I get my SSD working? I really dont want to reinstall all my apps, settings, etc.\n\nA: Each Mac has a minimum build number that has the necessary drivers to run that Mac. Sometimes a build will run tens of Macs and some builds are very narrowly scoped to handle all the existing models and that one new release until those drivers can be incorporated into the next numbered release of the OS.\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac OS X versions (builds) for computers\nWhat this means for you, is you'll need to try booting to the recovery HD on that SSD and hope the version of recovery is new enough to work to download he proper installer and let you proceed with the build for that Mac. If not, you'll need to place the drive that came with that Mini back in (or into an external USB enclosure that costs about $5 to $10 and hold the option key) to select that external drive.\nAt that point, you can re-run the installer or migrate the data from the SSD to the external drive. Then you can wipe the SSD clean using recovery and migrate back without having to reinstall or lose any data or settings. \nThere are many paths to getting back in business - but knowing the minimum builds will let you check things next time to run the updates before you move the drive.\n", "Q: Copying ISO file to USB drive in OS X?

Now we make only a small difference to this procedure to get it working with Apple computers, namely converting the ISO into special format usually labelled with DMG or just IMG.\nApple way\n\nThe only difference to Apple is that you need to make the ISO file into special DMG file and upload that. An answer provided a video that solved the issue but this screenshot should contain all essential.\n\n\n\nA: I can confirm that an 'official' Win10 (and also Win 7.1) iso obtained from University contract distributor winds up with a UDF formatted USB stick when copied with dd.  Rogerdpack's answer explains why. \nNote that some versions of Boot Camp Assistant do not offer a \"Win 7 or later\" option; Version 3 (.2) and later do.  Also, if you have copied your iso fruitlessly to the USB drive (now in UDF format) Boot Camp Assistant may (will) complain about your 8 GB flash being too small. Reformat this drive before using it in Boot Camp Assistant.\n\nA: From http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fu2g_E2ZK8A:\n\nYou can also can try this. It works for me.  This is a rather \"raw\" copy and will typically not work for a bootable USB, but will work for other cases.\nHere is a transcription of the commands from the screen shot for your copy/paste pleasure.\ndiskutil list                                            # shows disks\nhdiutil convert -format UDRW -o destino.img origen.iso   # convert to dmg\nsudo dd if=destino.img.dmg of=/dev/rdisk1 bs=1m          # copy to USB on rdisk1\n\n\nA: For people that don't want to mess with dd and need something that just works there are free cross-platform open-source apps:\n  usbimager — lightweight, native GUI for win/mac/linux [source code] \n  Etcher — Electron-based, win/mac/linux [source code]\nUsage\nTo flash drag-n-drop the ISO or IMG file to the app window and click Flash.\nPrivacy warning\nEtcher phones home for anonymous error reports and usage statistics as well as for auto-updates but the corresponding options can be disabled in Settings (the cogwheel icon).\n\nA: IMHO the easiest way is in terminal:\n\n\n*First run diskutil list\n\n*then insert your usb stick\n\n*and run diskutil list again to see the disk node (e.g. /dev/disk2).\n\n*Now run diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskN\n\n*and do sudo dd if=/path-to.iso of=/dev/rdiskN bs=1m (or bs=1M with homebrew)\n\n*When finished diskutil eject /dev/diskN\n\nA: If you want to make a bootable USB then I would suggest Unetbootin\n\nA: If you want your USB  to be \"bootable\" when all is said and done (ex: windows install disk), you're going to either want to use the Boot Camp Assistant (only check the \"Create a Windows 7 or later version install disk\" checkbox, then follow the prompts, it will create a FAT32 (i.e. bootable) USB version of your ISO file).  \nSome ISO's are created \"special\" to not need this, but not all are (ex: windows install disks). Details: https://superuser.com/q/1063220/39364 \nI.e. dd is not always enough.  Especially for windows install .iso's.\n\nA: Quoting from the ubuntu article linked earlier:\n\nI think the key is to use the drive (/dev/sdb), not the partition (/dev/sdb1), in the of= option:\nsudo dd if=dban.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=1m\n\n\nA: There is no perfect tool that hands all ISO images. The approach will be totally different for data iso and bootable iso.\nFor data ISO, you should check using diskutil + cp commands or commercial software like Roxio Toast or free software Disco/SimplyBurns.\nFor bootable ISO, the situation is a bit more complicated because different OS images adopts different boot scheme. From my own experience:\nUNetbootin is quite good for burning Linux ISO. It is also able to download Linux ISO images.\nUUByte ISO Editor is the best fit for Windows ISO and it works quite easily because of intuitive GUI. It only takes 3-5 minutes to create a Windows bootable usb on Mac.\nEtcher is good for Linux and Raspbian based image files for embedded development and it also has addition support for SD card.\nSo the answer is really dependent on what kind of ISO image file you are trying to copy/burn.\n", "Q: How to disable microphone for OS X? We need a way to disable the microphone so it cannot be re-enabled, at least by an unprivileged user.  And preferably via the command line, so it can be scripted.  On some Macs, we've been able to remove kexts, but on others, that also disables speakers, and we'd like to keep sound output.\n\nA: I know this is an old post, but the above command does not work. \"tell application \"System Events\" to set volume input volume 0\".  Sure, the slider moves all the way to the left, but if you make noise you can see the mic picking up input.  If you manually move the slider then it mutes.  Further analysis using the apple midi audio app indicates setting input volume to 0 via applescript actually sets it to 4.  I've tried putting in -4 and other negative values hoping it would work.  it does not.\nI'm not sure why apple chose this behavior.  It has been the result of setting input to 0 via applescript that it is not really 0 for years now.  Very frustrating.\n\nA: I think the only way you could do this is chmod and or chown the Preferences app, of course this can be done via the command line.\n\nsudo chmod 000 /Applications/System\\ Preferences.app\nOr \nsudo chown root /Applications/System\\ Preferences.app \n\nIn addition you could build an Apple Script to Mute the Microphone\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to set volume input volume 0\n\n", "Q: Is the Original AppleTV (First Gen) compatible with iTunes 11? I am afraid to update my Mac to iTunes 11 since I still use an original AppleTV (the old one with the hard drive) on one of my televisions.

You are forced to download the content twice.  I'm getting a lot of Error -50's when downloading on my computer.  I was avoiding these by downloading on my Apple TV and then copying back to my computer but this is no longer an option.  iTunes 11 has removed some very useful features in my opinion.\n\nA: It doesn't work!

When I've gotten it in the past (on OS X), it's been when my screen resolution is too small to play 1080p content natively. However if you ignore the warning, it will happily play just fine, but downscaled to fit your screen.\n\nA: To play 1080p content perfectly you need:\n\n\n*\n\n*a display with at least 1920 x 1080 resolution\n\n*HDCP must be supported by your display, your video card, and the cable (not DVI or VGA)\n\n*a CPU and video card capable of decoding at that speed. just because it works for one 1080p video doesn't mean it will work for another one, it depends on what encoding settings were used to create it, and it has less to do with how \"fast\" your video card is and more to do with what actual instructions it supports\n\n\nAlso, keep in mind higher definition videos will use more power possibly causing battery life or fan noise issues.\nBut basically, ignore the message, try watching a few 1080p videos, and if it doesn't work - switch back to 720. When the feature was first introduced most PC's couldn't play 1080p content, but it was still useful if your PC was just a NAS for whatever device your TV is plugged into.\n", "Q: How to access the equalizer in iTunes 11?

With iTunes DJ gone from iTunes 11, how can I go to replace or even enhance the lost functionality?\n\nA: I'm still adjusting it, but here is something that might actually be better than iTunes DJ on some aspects:\n\n\n*\n\n*create a playlist with some rules approaching the way you were using iTunes DJ. Something like Rating > 3, not played in a month, live update based on least played or random or whatever you were using with iTunes DJ.\n\n*start playing\n\n*switch to Mini Player\n\n*turn on Up Next View and extend it vertically. You can alternatively show previously played using the clock icon.\n\n\nWhat I like with this is the amount of interaction you have with the songs coming up. With a few clicks and remaining in that compact view, you can delete songs, add songs in the queue from genius recommendations. You can even bring up a full iTunes window on the side for drag and drop of additional songs or quick add (via alt-click) of songs to Up Next. Might take a little while to get used to it but it has potential.\n\n", "Q: How to get the Column Browser in iTunes 11 on the left side? In iTunes 10, I had the Column Browser (the list of Artists/Albums) going down the left side of the main iTunes window.  With the install of iTunes 11, it is back to the top.\nI tried going View>Column Browser>.... and the option is not there, and its not in the preferences either. Anyone see a way to get it back on the left side?\n\nA: You cannot bring back the left-side column browser. It is not possible in iTunes 11. The closest approximation I have found is to go to \"Artists\" view and enable the Sidebar (under the View menu). You can also downgrade to iTunes 10, depending on your system but that can present its own problems.\n\nA: If you switch to the Songs menu at the top and hit command-b you will bring up the column browser. If you want the old look, turn the sidebar on again as well.\n\nA: Under 11.0.2 when library is selected choose view and select column browser then choose show column browser.\n.\n", "Q: Where did the \"sync\" button go in iTunes 11? Ever since it supported devices, iTunes has had a \"sync\" button, which seems to have vanished from version 11. Where did it go? How do I sync my iOS devices with iTunes now?\n\nA: The sync button is on the bottom right of the iTunes window when you are viewing a device.\n\nConnect a device or two, and you will see controls to click in the top right to view the iOS device. Also option-command-s will toggle the traditional sidebar - now with more color than (immediately) before.\n\nSelecting the device will bring up a mostly familiar interface. You can also search on sync in the iTunes help menu. This update has changed the default views to look flatter and focus more directly on one main view, but menu commands, key commands and buttons are there to get to sync settings as usual.\n\nA: It's there, it just goes away sometimes. \nWhile the \"Sync\" button used to be reliably present in the same location in iTunes 10, it — as well as others — now vanishes occasionally in what (presumably) is a context sensitive manner.\n", "Q: Editing of material such as PDFs in iOS for Vizualisation? This thread is a part of the major thread about using iPad for education purposes here.\nEditing is slightly ambiguous term but here it means things such as collages here, merging, annotation and such things. I define this term here by purpose openly to categorize different threads that usually addresses PDFs but possible other similar threads in Apple SE.\n\nSo how can I do the editing in iOS? \n\nThe goal is to make some material visually-more-accessible so the word may contain things such as certain graphs and analysis things. \n\nA: I have outlined the things in three categories Input, Writing and Visualization. You see a picture or a homework, you see it i.e. you store it to your brains -- or you can scan it with your iPad or iPhone. You realize you want to add some material to it so you may add a photo -- vizualisation -- or write something.\nI. Input\n\nI. Readdle Scanner: photocopy & edit to adjust lightness etc and to store physical\nII. Mathematical Apps such as Quick Graph, Sage Math and TouchDraw to process mostly mathematical ideas\nIII. Conceptual tools such as general-graph-tool iThoughtsHD and linguistic-analysis-tools such as Wordflex\n\n\n\n\nII. Writing\n\nText Processing\n\nI. TeX Writer\nII. Business apps such as Pages, Numbers and Keynotes to generate things fast \n\nAnnotation\n\nI. PDFPen (if you need only merging, check PDF Merger)\nII. PDFExpert\nIII. GoodReader (somewhat limited editing tools)\n\n\nIII. Vizualisation\n\nImage Processing\n\nI. ProCreate\nII. Echograph for generating short GIF videos from images\n\nCollage\n\nI have tried most collage apps in iPad and iPhone but I only like the following\n\nI. MyFrames app\nII. FrameArstist app \n\nSomewhat-marketed apps such as Layout have bugs in writing and developer not responding and apparently not developing anymore.\n\n\nSummarum\n\nPersonally, I use a massive amount of different editing tools. You can see some results here. It is sometimes slow when missing the right tool but generally I really like doing one thing well even though it may take a bit more time.\nIt is pretty easy: you see something, you process it somehow and in every step you may need a specific app for your purpose. For brainstorming, you may want to have a look in input part while editor may want to look at vizualization part and writing part. I use the above tools but my tools will change because the environment changes. When I started with iOS, I had no OSx but later I got it making some steps easier -- however I am able to write long essays with photos and graphs in iOS without touching a proper desktop. It is not however the most efficient way of doing things so I use nowadays iOS besides OSx.\n\n", "Q: iTunes 11: Sorting albums by year Is there a way of sorting albums for an artist by year in iTunes?\nFor example: \"Coda\" is actually Led Zeppelin's last album, but it appears first for me in iTunes. I'd prefer it if it sorted albums by Year, so \"Led Zeppelin\" was at the top, followed by \"Led Zeppelin II\", and so on (and \"Coda\" was at the bottom).\nIs this possible?\n\nA: You can always use the keyboard shortcut \"Cmd+J\" to open the \"View Options\" window where you can select sorting mode.\n\nA: I've just found the answer! It's kind of hidden away, but it is possible:\nSelect \"Show Menu Bar\"...\n\nThen under View select \"View Options...\"\n\nA new window with View Options appears!\n\n\nA: You can change the Sort Album field in the Options tab of the song info.  I once found a script that would change all the sort album fields to year and album name, and in some cases (the Beatles for example) I changed it to yyyy.mm.dd album name because they released multiple albums per year.\nThis should be the default sorting for all music players, I REALLY don't know why it isn't.\n\nA: I simply enter the release date in the field Album Sorting in the format YYYYMMDD ie 20121224 and make sure that I sort by Artist - Year. Everything is sorted nicely :)\n", "Q: Is there a keyboard shortcut to queue a selected song so that iTunes will play it next? Is there a keyboard shortcut to queue up a selected song to the \"Up Next\" playlist that was introduced in iTunes 11? \nI like that new feature but having to alt-click or select from a panel isn't fast enough to queue up a few songs rapidly.\n\nA: There is no clear keyboard command, but if you hold the option key down, when your mouse hovers over a song, a circled plus icon appears to rapidly add songs to the Up Next playlist.\n\nThere is a nice animation where the artwork gets added to the playlist icon as it turns blue to indicate songs are in queue. Since the still picture doesn't show this very well, here is a short clip of it in action.\n\nA: Press Opt-Enter to add it to play next. i was soooo happy when i figured this out. \n\nA: optionenter (shiftenter on Windows) will add the selected song to the Up Next list (in iTunes 11.0, this does not work in album view, but does in all other views). However, iTunes will always ask you if you want to clear the previous songs from the list, so an extra keystroke is needed.\nThere are one or two drawbacks to this method, firstly: It defaults to clear the previous songs so a simple enter will not suffice and a P keystroke is needed to add the song while keeping the existing list. Secondly: In addition the added song will default to the top of the 'Up Next' playlist as oppose to when you click to add a song (in this instance the added song will default to the bottom of the list).\nI'm only running Windows so I can't say the same (or similar) is true for Macs.\n\nA: I read on the Help menu that you can also drag the song to the top area of iTunes (where it tells you the current song) to add it to the queue. Not as fast as a keyboard shortcut but helpful nonetheless.\n\nA: If you right click on the song, you can select \"Play Next.\"  That adds it to the playlist and plays it next.\nSpecifically to your question, you could go into Accessibility, Keyboard, Keyboard Shortcuts, Application Shortcuts, and see if you can muck about with the proper menu commands and assign them to the shortcut.  I tried a simple \"Play Next\" but couldn't get the key-combination right.  But I've got 3 million key combinations set up so I'm sure it was me :)\n\nEdited just moments after.  You might also take a look at Automator if you want to expand potential functions via keyboard shortcut.  If you create a Service, you can select \"Music\" from the Library and there are many things you can do from there.  It takes file input, text input, etc.  You could, for instance, be in terminal, highlight a song, and play it.  Stuff like that.  Thought I would add that in case you are looking for super-cool stuff to do.\n", "Q: How to restructure TM backup drive without losing backups? I had some hard drive problems a little while ago, so installed a new drive system, and restored data from my Time Machine Backup.  However, the mount point is very different from the one originally backed up.\nRight now I have a 6 TB backup drive, with 1.6 TB free.  I have 4 TB's to backup to it, most of which is already on the backup drive, just mapped to a different folder/volume.\nI'm quite comfortable using the shell or whatever, I'm just getting permission problems or 'operation not permitted' when trying to move the folders to an existing tree, or to even create a symlink.\nHopefully I don't need to dump my old backup data in order to continue backing up.\nIs there a way I restructure the backup folders on the Time Machine drive, so I don't lose my backups from before this restore point?\n\nA: Restructuring the files manually isn't a very easy or practical solution. Due to the hard links used to store the files and the data structures and metadata involved for Time Machine to track which files have changes, it would be better to live with the change.\nYou can enter Time Machine and delete entire backups or manually delete files or entire snapshots. If you do nothing, you will have two copies of some files where you would have had one had the normal compression of files being stored in the same path are unchanged on the backup when the file does not change. Once Time Machine sees that you don't have enough space to hold the next backup (as it estimates each backup need before starting) it will then do the clean up by time for you.\nTechnically, the system has locked the backups into a special state where even root has to disable the protections to then delete files. It's much better to use tmutil to delete entire snapshots (or a range of them systematically) or the normal UI to delete all backups of a folder or a file.\nYou could also just put that drive on a shelf and start with a new one. This does add extra cost (well a lot of cost for 6 TB of disk) but you won't have to lose backup history. If the files are truly duplicated, just let Time Machine clear enough space to accommodate the next backup and you should be clear. The risk is that the deletion happens before the backup starts, and there is a short window where a bit more than 4 TB of data was deleted, and you haven't made a new backup copy of the files - they will only exist on the source and a failure during that next backup could cause you data loss.\n", "Q: iTunes 11: Where are my podcasts? Ok, unless I'm missing something, I can't see my podcasts anymore? The only place they appear is in a new \"Podcasts\" playlist, which isn't much use to me for keeping track of episodes and subscriptions.\nAm I just being blind? :-/\n\nA: You may need to recheck the Podcasts checkbox in the menu iTunes | Preferences... | General tab.  OSX Daily suggests that it may be unchecked by default. Once checked, podcasts should appear under Library rather than as a playlist.\n\nA: If you hit option-command-s it will bring up the sidebar. You will see your Podcasts there.\n\nA: Once you have podcasts showing, using the dropdown upper right, if you switch to list view (weirdly located as one of 3 options in center of entire window, under \"progress bar\"), if you then click the twirl-down arrow for a podcast, a big gray arrow will automatically show if there are un-dowloaded episodes of that podcast. Click that, and a window will ask you if you want to download all episodes, which obviously you do. It all seems a little odd and seems like Apple needs to work on tis a bit more.\n", "Q: Is a classical music friendly \"Composer List\" view possible in iTunes 11? The iTunes 11 redesign has pretty much ruined usability for those of us whose library consists primarily of classical music. Both iTunes 10 and 11 allow two values for Composers in addition to the normal Artist\nSomething similar to \"Artist List\" view would be extremely useful, but don't see any filtering/sorting options for that view. Is it possible to change the \"pivot\" field for that view to use composer instead of artist?\n\nHopefully someone can figure out How to get the Column Browser in iTunes 11 on the left side? and most of my usability concerns would be addressed, but I would like to be able to leverage the new Artist List view, but by composer. Has anyone found a good way to expose metadata fields like composer\n\nA: Apple added the Composers view to iTunes 11.0.2.\nYou have to enable this setting under Preferences > General > \"Show Composers\".\n\nSelecting the Composers tab will display a list similar to the Artists view.\n\n\nA: To filter the \"Artist List\" by composer, go to the Artist list, click on the magnifying glass next to the search field and de-select \"Search Entire Library\", then on that same menu, under \"filter by\" select Composer.\nThis also works on the Songs list and also filters the Column Browser. If you leave it to \"All\" it's pretty much the same default functionality of iTunes 10.\n\nA: The closest I can get to your layout is to customize the column browser by control clicking on the existing headings when it is visible.\n\nComposers and groupings can be added, although you may want to remove or reorder Artists or Albums if the view becomes too cluttered with columns.\n\nA: Another option but probably not quite what you're looking for.\nWith the Songs header selected, you can go to View > View Options and check Composer and Grouping for them to be columns in the view. You can grab the column header and drag them around to arrange the columns in the order you want.\n\nA: My solution - which is, admittedly a workaround - has always been to put the composer's name in the Artist field. This not only simplifies browsing in iTunes, but also on iOS devices. I have a huge amount of classical music in my iTunes library - about 50,000 tracks currently - and this makes it practical to access music. \nI really miss the column browser's ability to be visible everywhere, as it was in iTunes 10, as that was my favorite way of drilling down through my iTunes library. \nThere's no way to get the Column Browser back on the left, alas, with iTunes 11. While I didn't use it all the time, some of my playlists were easier to browse with it on the side. \n", "Q: Searching in iTunes 11 no longer filters column browser options? In iTunes 10.x, if you searched for items (top right) it would filter the column browser to only show values that matched your search query. Now when I search, it filters the list of items, but not the column browsers. Is this an option somewhere?\n\nA: To get the desired effect you can click on the \"magnifying glass\" icon and deselect \"Search Entire Library\". This prevents the Miniplayer version of the search and filters both your Column Browser and the list of songs (or artists/albums/genre).\n\nA: Thanks - frntk answers my problem of how to sort or select by composer: Right-click on the magnifying glass and deselect 'Search Entire Library'.\nBut why on earth does this enable searching by composer?\nThe other way of searching by composer without deselecting 'Search Entire Library':\nEnter the search query; e.g. 'Bach'\nA window opens with a magnifying glass and the message 'No Results'. A button invites a search of the iTunes Store. Another message in blue at the top of the window gives\nSearch 'Bach' in Music. Click on this or press Return and the search is done.\nBut why on earth is it arranged this way? Searches of artist, track title etc don't require the convoluted method above.\n\nA: The search library control in the top right of the main iTunes window now invokes the MiniPlayer version of the search control.\nTo search in the column browser, you have to select one of the panes (anything in there will do) and start typing. So if you select any Genre and type \"blu\" you'll get bluegrass or blues or the closest genre to that search string.\n\nA: This thread is quite old, however one may benefit from my input. If one was to go to view on the drop-down menu and select view options, from there one must check every box one wants their searches to include. If one was using a newer version of iTunes one must click on the Songs tab to edit this list, e.g. Songs/Albums/Artists/Genres and so on. This may crowd up the list view a bit this is the only way for other fields to be included in searches.\n\nA: big problem with the search on top right : it doesn't search in all the tags! I use the grouping one to write the labels, if I search a label, it just doesn't show up. \nedit: my bad, if I display the grouping column, it works. but not sure it was like that in itunes 10.\n", "Q: View Artwork in Sidebar - iTunes 11 How can I view the artwork in the sidebar in the latest version of iTunes 11 ?\n\nA: It appears that this is no longer a function (even hidden) in the new iTunes. To me, this looks like another useful feature got dropped. The closest thing I've found so far is clicking the cover in the top display pops out a resizable window (a-la coversutra). Sorry mate.\n", "Q: Can I still use a damaged Magsafe power cable? My rabbit chewed on my Magsafe 2 power adapter. I can see the silvery wire where the rabbit peeled off the isolation yet it still works.\nCan I just duct tape it and continue using it or is there any danger of damage to my laptop?\nEdit:\nRabbit was objurgated otherwise he is fine.\n\nA: With the looming possibility that any advice you get from here could cause damage to your machine, I'll prefix my answer with a disclaimer that you should probably confirm with an official source or advice from Apple directly.\nSo long as the visible damage is limited to the insulation, you should be fine with electrical tape (as opposed to duct tape). The silver wire you see (likely braided) is used to prevent interference and is used as a ground.\n", "Q: How effective is a Time Machine backup? I'm having a problem with Office not installing correctly and not being able to update. I have one last resort which is Backing up and formatting my system.\nHowever I would like to know how effective is Time Machine for the following two points :\n\n\n*\n\n*Will I be able to restore \"EVERY\" application without the need of re-installing items ?? For example, I have python installed with many modules that take ages to get them all working together. Would I need to repeat this process after cleaning my machine and using the backup to restore ?\n\n*Office has been corrupted after deleting it. Now it fails to install correctly and update. What is the chance that the corruption would be copied over to the backup file, rendering the whole process of formatting my machine to \"fix\" the issue useless ?\n\n\nA: Whoa, that's a way last resort. You don't have a computer problem, you have a Microsoft problem. Move all Microsoft preference files (plist and plist.lockfile) from both ~/Library/Prefences and ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost, and from /Library/Preferences, to the Trash. \nAny Ofice apps in Applications or the whole Microsoft Office folder, move to trash or zip and store in /Users/Shared. Same with Microsoft folder in /Library/Application Support. Start with a clean state. \nLog out, maybe even Restart, and try installing again. Sometimes just getting a fresh copy of  Microsoft AutoUpdate into /Libary/ApplicationSupport/Microsoft/MAU2.0/ gets it all working, along with letting the apps build fresh Preferences--let MAU find and install updates.\n\nA: Time Machine backs up everything and restores everything.\nWhen Time Machine backs up, it first copies all of the files exactly from your hard drive (and any other disks) to your chosen backup disk. Nothing is excluded unless explicitly specified. This answers your question concerning losing your Python modules.\nAfter first backup, Time Machine hard links your files to another backup folder named by time and date. This means that it creates a duplicate of all of the files it created on first backup to the next backup without taking up more space. It's a lot like an alias or shortcut, but the difference between the original and a hard linked file is indistinguishable in Finder.  Therefore, it efficiently changes all the files that were actually changed since first backup.\nUsing Command-R to bring up Disk Utility from Recovery options, formatting the disk, and restoring from Time Machine was painless and I did not lose a single file.\nSince it copies all files exactly, it will transfer your \"corrupt\" Office files to the new drive. However, you can select Repair Disk to clear up any issues with permission errors, etc.\nBut, honestly, I don't think that it's worth restoring from Time Machine unless you've tried completely removing Microsoft Office for Mac 2011.\n\nA: In /Library/App Support/MS Folder are 4 folders: \n/MAU2.0/MS AutoUpdate.app \n/MERP2.0/MS Error Reporting.app & MS Ship Assets.app\n/PlayReady/ (empty)\n/Silverlight/OutOfBrowser/SLLauncher.app \n            /verison.txt (reads: 5.1.10411.0)\nIn ~/Lib/App Support/Microsoft are 2 folders:\n/Office at 2.1MB \n/Silverlight/various db folders \nThese ought to be moved to desktop too, to get a reinstall working, as they contains preferences files & other things that might signal to the Installer that Office is already installed or the disk ineligible.\nWhat are you trying to install from? \nThis is a really good argument for having a SuperDuper clone of your whole disk on a portable USB.\n", "Q: Requirements for backuping large OSx to some larger external storage? Some easy Apple way to do it? My iTunes stores my OS X, iPhone and iPad settings. I got this kind of problem in OS X that stores the essential things such as settings and backups. According to this thread here, I need to format the drive.\n\nThe segregation of the HDD means I need to backup my OSx to some external HDD. Could someone suggest a storage? I have no idea which features to look for in backup disks, could someone guide me? Write-speed, read-speed, durability, something else? In the past, I have by accident broken 3.5 drives so I think I must get some cases such as here -- if I am going with traditional way.\nNow in the Apple way:\n\nWhat are the Apple ways to solve this backup problem?\n\nHelper questions\n\n\n*\n\n*Instead of buying 3.5\" drives, I have wondered whether Apple offers something here: I will soon have a Mac Mini for rendering so could I use its storage for backup-storage?\n\n\n*I haven't yet used Time Machine, could I do this with it? Or should I take an image of the whole disk somehow?\n\n\n*If I go with some random HDD such as this here, what kind of features should I look for? Are all harddrives Apple-compatible? I have this kind of reader here.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Yes, install server on it and you can use networked time machine backups direct to it's own internal storage\n\n*Yep, this would be ideal\n\n*Rather than looking at a disk, and then an external caddy, just get one that's all in one.  Speeds are not really an issue if you use USB, it's far slower than the drive will be.  All drives are compatible, some may merely require re-initialising to remove windows filesystems.  There is no real feature to look for, but when I chose mine I looked for a quiet one is all.\n\n\nA: I've used Macs since y'all were toddlers, always keep everything upgraded, and still like things simple. Maybe any of this will help:\nPeople confuse TimeMachine, which is an incremental backup of changed files (once it's got the initial set) and is not bootable ... with a BackUp Disk, which can boot the computer and perhaps even repair it, with Disk Utility and Disk Warrior. A portable USB clone of your computer. The cloning utility I like is SuperDuper. Maybe once a month I run SD and it updates the clone - and I always run it before System updates/upgrades/new machines. Used to use old Powerbook drives in enclosures, but found them to be fragile. \nYou can have as many as you like, of course--keep one in the car, etc. Flash or pocket or disk-on-key drives are now hi-capacity enough to store your important files, and can be made bootable with a limited system and hold some utilities.\nIt'a a matter of choice, money and paranoia, how many layers of duplication and backup makes you comfortable. I would not rely on iCloud in any manner--use it, but not rely on for storage. \nAn easier backup--without the hardware of TimeMachine--is Arq, which backs up my changed files--and anything else I want--nightly over my wireless connection to Amazon storage. Cost is reasonable - and of course one can pay more in monthly fees and archive files. \nIt's a matter of distinguishing between disk clones, the replica of your computer ... backing up ... and archiving, so to speak. I trust A3 more than I do TimeMachine, and already have enough hardware.\nBy archiving, I mean the files you never want to lose. They can of course be stored on a portable or online ... having a real copy in your possession can't be beat.\nThe portable USB/Firewire bus-powered disks I've owned have all been just about silent. \n\nA: \nDrive with the USB-3 support\n\nMake sure you pay a little bit extra for USB 3 or Firewire. USB 3 is currently much cheaper to Firewire so I would get such drive. My friend Ville mentioned that a large splittered HDD with poor connection can easily take 7hours of copying or more. With USB 3, you can save a lot of time in the case of emergency and not wasting the whole day in copying things.\n\nA ready container with USB connection, not separate drive and not separate container\n\nI asked my friend about using this kind of tools here but my friend instructed to buy a box protecting the drive because it does not add much price to the drive and easy USB usage. You can nowadays find 2TBs' drives 2.5\" for about 260EUR such as WD My Passport for Mac.\nAnswers to helper questions merged some comments above\n\n\n*\n\n*Instead of buying 3.5\" drives, buy a Mac Mini and use its storage as backup-storage.\n\n\n*Use Time Machine and also clone the whole disk. Bart Arondson mentioned a tool \"Carbon Copy Cloner\" for cloning in the comments. You need both of them, Time Machine and cloning, Time Machine does not replaces an image of the disk.\n\n\n*PC-style solution: go with some random HDD such as this here but too much things to analyze: which features should I look for? Are all harddrives Apple-compatible? Other items? Like reader here? Bart Arondson mentioned \"5400 rpm is enough\".\n\n\n*[No] TimeCapsule as backup? -No because of poor experience here of losing data.\n\nRelated questions\n\n*\n\n*About the silence of harddisks, please, consult this thread here.\n\n", "Q: Removing Files from iTunes Media? I noticed that I have well over 100 songs in the iTunes Media folder that are NOT in my actual iTunes. These would be songs that were loaded into iTunes then deleted because I didn't like them, want them, whatever. They are taking up hard drive space and I want to flush them out w/o having to go into each and every single folder and finding the songs that are not in my iTunes. I would have to sort through over 6,000 files to do that. There has to be an easier way! Thank you!\nI wanted to add that I am using a PC (Windows 7) and not a MAC.\n\nA: One of the many useful scripts in Doug's AppleScripts for iTunes is Music Folder Files Not Added, which will do exactly what you're looking for. Just download and run it, and it will give you a list of all files in your iTunes folders that aren't in the library.\n\n", "Q: getting \"out of memory\" error when trying to load specific websites (am not out of RAM) UPDATE: Rich's solution (with the checkmark) solved my problem! I also posted an answer with a workaround that may help if Rich's solution doesn't work for you. The answer that received the bounty was the best at the time, but it doesn't have an actual solution (though it helped with troubleshooting).  \n\nI'm having a problem where my computer (Macbook Pro, 8GB RAM, OS 10.8) will not to attempt to load certain websites. Nothing fixes it except for rebooting. This occurs when nothing else is obviously wrong with my computer or internet connection, and when other sites load without problems. \nWhen this occurs, here are the errors I get:\n\n\n*\n\n*Chrome: Error 13 (net::ERR_OUT_OF_MEMORY)\n\n*Safari: \"The error is: 'The operation couldn't be completed. Cannot allocate memory.'  (NSPOSIXErrorDomain:12)\"\n\n*Firefox: No response after entering the URL and pressing return (no error message, no throbber to indicate that it's loading or trying to contact the site). \n\n*ping:\nPING google.com (74.125.224.135): 56 data bytes\nping: sendto: Cannot allocate memory\nping: sendto: Cannot allocate memory\nRequest timeout for icmp_seq 0\nping: sendto: Cannot allocate memory\nRequest timeout for icmp_seq 1\n\n(after which I canceled out)\nThe first time I noticed this, it occurred for one or two sites I tried to visit. I was still able to use facebook and google. Later in the day, the error extended to facebook and google as well. After rebooting, those sites became accessible again, but later on I became unable to access other sites (stackexchange.com, surveygizmo.com). \nSome other notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*I can confirm that this happens on multiple wireless networks and VPNs. \n\n*At the moment this was happening I had 2 GB of RAM \"inactive\" and 500 MB \"free\" out of 8 GB total, so I'm not actually out of memory. Other websites and applications are responding snappily and there's no sign of excessive swapping.\n\n*The response from ping seems to suggest that the problem doesn't affect DNS (though the IP address could have been cached somewhere).  \n\n\nI've only found one other reference to this problem, in this Apple support thread. No solution was found except for rebooting. \nNOTE: This is not a problem with running out of RAM\nActivity Monitor shows plenty of free / inactive memory. There's not an excessive amount of paging going on. Other websites load without problems. There may be some other kind of memory allocation error going on, but I can't imagine any way that a plain old RAM shortage would disable certain specific websites, with no other impact on performance. \n\nA: I wasn't able to get my network back by disabling and re-enabling TCP/IP or the Wi-Fi. It seems in my case the computer had gone to sleep with a Juniper VPN connection and when it woke back up the connection had timed out and the routes weren't cleaned up. For me, I had two computers, one working and one not, and so was able to identify the problem after running netstat -rn.\nOn the computer that wasn't working, I had a destination of 192.168.43.1 with a gateway of link#5. On the computer that WAS working, the gateway for that destination was the mac address of the wireless router, so I removed that route with:\nsudo route delete -host 192.168.43.1\n\nAfter this, I could ping my wireless router and also get back to the internet.\nSome people claimed that going to Settings → Network → Wi-Fi → Advanced → Proxies and turning on Auto Proxy Discovery worked for them. I was not able to verify this as my connection was fixed by deleting the 'dead' route.\n\nA: This is neither a RAM nor a disk related problem.\nThis is a kernel problem due to a misbehaviour of one of your network interfaces. Here are a few commands to start locating the origin of this problem when it occurs:\n\n\n*\n\n*netstat -mm\nwill provide a detailed information about your buffers pool usage;\n\n*netstat -I en0 if your actual network interface in use is en0 (Ethernet) will show you any actual errors (Ierrs, Oerrs);\n\n*netstat -r will show you if your routes toward the rest of the world are correct.\n\n\nThis misbehaviour may be the consequence of an automatic or targeted network attack. If you suspect that you may be facing such a case, here is a way to look the truth right in the eyes:\n\n\n*\n\n*leave any network application (Safari, Mail, ssh…) so as to limit your own known noise (on your network interface);\n\n*open a Terminal and type: /usr/bin/sudo tcpdump -i en0 (if your interface is en0 == Ethernet);\n\n\n*\n\n*if the output of tcpdump stays silent, you aren't attacked, just exit this privileged application by typing control-C\n\n*if the output of tcpdump is flooding, you are attacked.\nIf you are in such a case, please post an extract of this output\nand of the 3 above commands outputs.\n\n\n\nA: This should be fairly easy to track down with the sysdiagnose tool.\nWhen you get a browser wedged and spitting errors, open terminal and add the browser name as an argument to the script: (so if Safari is crashing)\n sysdiagnose Safari\n\nThis tool will call sudo which needs you to type your password (it won't show to the screen, so type it slowly if you are new to sudo or prone to mis-type your password if you don't see it being typed).\nAt this point, you will get a huge system diagnosis tar.gz file stored in /private/var/tmp that you can copy to your desktop and pore over. It will be a bit like looking for a needle in a haystack - but you can be sure some resource is getting filled if a reboot makes things work until whatever bug or resource is triggered/used again.\n\nA: Look at your routing table (run netstat -rn on a Terminal). This issue even persists after a reboot.\nI've solved similar issues I've had by disabling TCP/IP (System Preferences » Network » Wi-Fi » Advanced » TCP/IP) and re-enabling TCP/IP for Wifi/Ethernet interface.\n\nA: This problem is unlikely to be related to system memory, but instead to network buffers. Please show us the output of netstat -m. \nWhat VPN software are you using? Do you see the problem when you aren't using a VPN?\n\nA: A few suggestions, although you may have already tried them:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clear the caches, everywhere... run Cocktail or MacPilot to nuke 'em all.\n\n*Clear out the Internet Plug-ins folder in the main Library folder. Every browser will use them.\n\n*I would also suggest creating a fresh, new User account and testing it there, just to see what happens.\n\n\nA: My friend was once running into a similar problem with Google Chrome where it pulled RAM like that. You might look at what programs are using how much RAM when this problem occurs with  Activity Monitor. If there is a sub-operation of Google Chrome then you might try reinstalling it.\n\nA: After a great deal of blind experimentation, I have found a solution! If I manually create an entry in the routing table for the IP block that is failing to load, it fixes the problem. \nStep 1: Find the IP address for the site you want to load.\nYou can do this using ping, dig, or nslookup (see this question for details). \nStep 2: Find the IP address of your gateway\nYou can find this from the network control panel, from ifconfig, or by running netstat -rn and noting the IP address next to the entry \"default\". \nStep 3: Create a routing table entry for the affected IP address or block\nUse the command sudo route add [affected IP address] [gateway IP address]\nIf, like me, you have this problem with whole IP blocks at once, you can enter the entire /8 block. For example, if the address of the site you wanted to reach is 173.231.155.34, you can enter sudo route add 173.0.0.0/8 [gateway IP address]\nThis is a pretty bad solution. You have to manually re-enter all of these if you change to a network with a different gateway address, or if you reboot.  And it still doesn't explain why this was happening in the first place. But it does let me use my computer, when previously I was totally hosed. \n\nA: Actually I was having this problem on a Mac, after trying some solutions I just restarted the computer and BANNG... it worked fine again!\n", "Q: After upgrading to iTunes 11, I cannot see my iPad mini I'd like to access my iPad mini file sharing via iTunes 11.

Use a dedicated converter.\n\nA: If you are using a Windows based version of iTunes you can hit ALT and access the File menu at the top, in the menu you can 'Create new version'.\n", "Q: Can I use a time machine volume to store additional data? I have a large external hard drive that I am using as a time machine backup volume. Since I don't need all the storage space for backups, I'm considering storing additional data on the drive. Is there any danger of this usage interfering with the backup system or is this an always-safe storage spot?\n\nA: Seeing that external storage is relatively inexpensive, I would leave the existing TM drive alone and purchase another external drive. That way, you can backup the additional data on the new drive to the TM disk, too. You wouldn't be able to do this if the additional data resides on the TM drive itself.\nIf you do choose to use the TM disk for non-TM data, I recommend partitioning the drive to separate the TM data from the non-TM data. If you ever need to reformat the TM partition, you won't need to move that additional data to another disk first, or visa versa.\nAll that being said, it is technically possible to use the TM disk to store additional data. I used to do it until #4 (below) happened and I lost ~10k .mp3 files I then needed to re-rip from CDs. (I did re-rip about 80% of the lost files to Apple Lossless format, so it wasn't a complete disaster, but I did lose thousands of files.)\nThere are several drawbacks you should keep in mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*Time Machine will delete older backups more frequently when available space is low. \n\n*Performance on the drive will suffer when TM is running and you are accessing the additional data at the same time.\n\n*If you need to transport the additional data off-site, you'll also be taking your TM backup with you.\n\n*When (not if) the entire disk crashes hard, you will lose the additional data unless it is backed up somewhere.\n\n\nA: Yes - you are free to use that disk to mix storage and Time Machine backups. Stay out of the Time Machine folder/disk image and you will be fine.\nSince Time Machine can back up to a network store and a locally connected drive - the details on where Time Machine squirrels away it's backup data is slightly different, but you are free to use the rest of either disk to store whatever files you wish.\nThe only down side to storing files on the same volume that is being used as a Time Machine destination is that you cannot use Time Machine to both back up those other files and store backups from elsehere. Even with the dual destination rotation scheme added in Mountain Lion - Time Machine is hands off for any drive listed as a destination.\n\nA: None, as far as you know what you are doing and don’t change the name of the volume. Also make sure that the partition table type is GUID.\nThe only possible side effect would be your transfer speeds getting slow because a backup is happening. \n", "Q: I deleted songs right off my iPod, why are they again in my iPod after syncing? I have 887 songs in my iTunes library, and last night I deleted some of them right off my iPod touch, 4th generation. At the end I got 769, and in the morning I connected my iPod to iTunes, I did some changes that had nothing to do with my music, because they were fine, but then I clicked sync and again, the songs I deleted from my Ipod were again in my iPod! how do I sync my iPod to actually \"update\" my iTunes library, I don't want to delete the music again or do I need to delete the same songs from my iTunes library too?\n\nA: You need to tell iTunes not to sync those songs. \n\n\n*\n\n*Uncheck the songs you do not want to sync in the iTunes \"Music\" list.\n\n*Check \"Sync only checked songs and Videos\" in the options for the device.\n\n\n\n", "Q: Is it advisable to calibrate the battery on a MacBook? How useful or necessary is it to calibrate the battery on a MacBook?\nIf it is, should it be carried out when first purchased and does calibration of the battery mean it will also last longer?\n\nA: There is almost no value in a user trying to \"calibrate\" a unibody MacBook's internal battery since it has multiple cells and the system handles this continually.\nOlder MacBook that were non-unibody construction with removable batteries did benefit periodic calibration runs to update the Mac's estimation of time remaining. Calibration didn't actually give you more power, just a more accurate estimate of the time remaining before that battery needs a recharge.\n\n\n*\n\n*The canonical reference for which models can benefit from calibration is Apple Portables: Calibrating your computer's battery for best performance. \n\n*A nice primer on battery technology in general is Apple's Lithium-ion polymer batteries site. \n\n*For more technical data, I like reading at the \"Battery University\" site.\n\n\nIf you seek to extend the time between when you buy a battery (or computer) and the time when it needs to be replaced three things will help prolong the useful life of your battery.\n\n\n*\n\n*Discharging it until the Mac sleeps at least once every month or two.\n\n*Not letting it drain totally for months.\n\n*Avoid exceeding the re-charge cycles (new models typically are rated for 5 years and 1000 equivalent charge cycles).\n\n*Avoid storage in very hot temperatures and use (charging / discharge) in hot temperatures.\n\n\nIn the end, you might pay between $100 and $150 for a new battery, but something that happens once every 3 to 4 years, Apple's new battery technology is far better than the old days where heavy users needed a new battery yearly and failures were far more common.\n", "Q: How to open time machine progress bar window I know that there is a window where time machine can display its current progress, along with an estimate about how long it will likely take till the current backup is complete. This window did somehow appear during my initial backup. However, I currently can't find a way to manually open that window for a subsequent backup. Yes there is the Time Machine tab in the Control Panel, but that will not provide an estimation of remanining time. Neither does the context menu of the menu bar icon. So how can I get that window?\n\nA: I am 100% sure there is no way to see how long the the backup takes just the size of the backup and how much portion of the size it has already backed up like shown below.\n\nThe only time duration that Time Machine shows is when you are restoring from a backup and during the first time you set up Time Machine using a empty hard disk.\nI just noticed that \"Open Time Machine Preferences\" shows a progress bar for the current backup operation. I just upgraded to Maverick recently so this may be a new feature.\n\nA: This window only appears on the first TM run (when you create a new TM backup on an empty disk)\n\nA: If you click the time machine icon on the top bar of your Mac, go to Time Machine Preferences, and (assuming you have a backup in progress) the estimated time remaining as well as the file size should show in this window\n\nA: Progress is always available.\nGo to SYSTEM PREFERENCES --> Time Machine.....\nIt will show you the current progress.  Mine currently at 258 of 388GB (28 minutes left)  :)\n\nA: Note that in Time Machine preferences a progress-bar will only shown when automatic backup runs, not when backup is started manually.\n", "Q: How can I fix the iTunes 11 mini player that won't show the track name? When I start the mini player in iTunes 11 on Mountain Lion, I do not see the expected track information which, when moused over, is supposed to change to playback controls:\n \nInstead, the playback controls are permanently displayed and I can't find a way to show track info (aside from album artwork). Also, as shown in the screenshot below, whenever the mini player is the active window, the rewind button has a blue highlight.\n\nThe reviews that have appeared on the web, and Apple's keynote, suggest that this is not normal behaviour. Is it a bug that others are experiencing and is there a way of fixing it, apart from waiting for an update?\n\nA: Tabbing to the search or \"up next\" solves the track name visibility problem, but then it stops pressing space bar to play-pause.\n\nA: The answer is in the comments on this TUAW post. The keyboard focus on the mini player (indicated by the blue focus ring) is on one of the playback controls, which prevents them from hiding. Click the mini player background to bring it to the foreground, then press tab until the focus ring moves to the Up Next or Search icons, and track information will appear whenever the mouse is not over it.\n\nA: I've rewritten the old iTunes 10 MiniPlayer open-source. This should keep working with new versions of iTunes!\nhttp://peter-burk.rhcloud.com/miniplayer/\n", "Q: Merge SUB-folders replaces instead of merging? I can not beleive more people don't have a problem with this. Merge contents in Lion or ML does NOT merge contents if 1 or more of those \"contents\" is a subfolder\nMerge contents of two folders works great if they are files inside the merging folders.. But if they have same named subfolders, the merging folder will REPLACE, not merge the destination's subfolder\nEXAMPLE:\nDrive1 / Folder1\n               - text1.txt\n               - text2.txt\n               - / subfolder / \n                         - text3.text\n\nMERGE TO\nDrive2 / Folder1\n               - text1.txt\n               - text2.txt\n               - / subfolder / \n                         - text1.text\n                         - text2.text\n\nthis should get text3.txt merged into Drive2's subfolder from Drive1's, but instead this subfolder is REPLACED, and NOT MERGED!! The resulting subfolder only contains text3.txt and text1 and text2 have vanished!\nAnyone else experiencing this? I can't find any acknowledgement from Apple that this is even an issue. \nAnyone shed light on this be appreciated, as well as fix or work-arounds for doing proper merge when (almost identical) subfolders exist\n\nA: I use an alternative manager http://www.binarynights.com/ as a workaround. \nIf you copy folders there, Forklift will ask you if you want to merge them or replace. Replace option works how you would expect. \nHowever, when you move folders, the replace is the only option. \n", "Q: Why does Time Machine estimate a 109GB backup size, but then need 235 GB? I'm running Time Machine on a new NAS. Until today, I used to run it on an USB drive. I am reusing the old job using the new 10.8 feature that allows me to add new backup targets. \nWhen I configure the backup job in the system settings - there are some things like VMs that I want to exclude - Time Machine estimates the backup size to be 109 GB.\nWhen I start the backup, however, it talks about 235 GB. I don't like this, as I don't want to litter the NAS with unnecessary data.\nIs it normal that Time Machine shows such a huge difference between the System dialog, and the actual backup? \n\nA: This discrepancy is odd - most of the time when people see more than a 25 GB error, it's with Time Machine over-estimating the space that will be used rather than under-estimating. You might be on to something where there is abug in calculating things with multiple backup targets - I've not seen that configuration start to misbehave yet - so you might be one of the lucky few to see how things break under that setup.\nIf you can make this happen repeatedly, I'd submit a bug (or at least poke around) by running the tmdiagnose tool to collect data on the estimates and actualities.\nAlso, the Backuploupe tool is amazing at getting at space usage and estimate oddities when you use Time Machine. It's not able to catalog both destinations simultaneously yet - but seems to work well enough on Mountain Lion that I still use it regularly.\n", "Q: Is there a way to use my iPhone 5's unlimited data on my iPad mini Wi-Fi without the expensive hotspot option? I am grand-fathered in the AT&T unlimited data.  I sometimes like to stream Netflix, Hulu, etc while on lunch break.  Is there a way to airplay it over to my iPad mini, or do some type of internet sharing without paying the ridiculous data rates for sharing and AT&T?\n\nA: There have been hacks in the past to enable tethering, but in almost all cases, the carrier can tell what you are doing. I have even heard that people that tethered were individually contacted by AT&T to let them know that the tethering fee would be added if they wished to continue tethering and asked the customers to come in to chat if there were perhaps a misunderstanding.\nYou'll want to look for an unofficial AirPlay receiver app on the jailbreak side of things since Apple isn't even allowing these for solid commercial sound apps - let alone video apps.\nLong term - let's hope enough people push for network neutrality in the US cellular space so that there is one tariff for data based on volume - not how you intend to use that data.\n\nA: Yes.

I really liked the three column Genre sort up until now. :(\n\n\nA: You can remove the genre-*.jpg files in the application bundle. iTunes will use the cover art of tracks for the genres though.\n\nIt also breaks the code signature and could be overridden by updates.\n\nA: I prefer to use album artwork for genre artwork. To do this I edited genres.plist in iTunes resources folder using Property List Editor, under 'Root' I deleted 'entries' which deletes all default itunes album artworks associative preference.\nAnother method is adding an \n    exactStringMatch - Boolean - Check\n\nmethod to whichever 'Item' I prefer to change.

It's pretty popular to replace ones optical drive* on the MacBook Pro with a HDD, but how serious are the risks?\n*In most cases, you'd do this when installing a third-party SSD, but I'd like to leave any of those benefits out of this and isolate matters of the HDD and Superdrive.\nI mean things like:\n\n*\n\n*Overheating\n\n*Performance issues\n\n*Battery life\n\n*Warranty status\n\n*Weight increase\n\n*Upsetting Steve\n\n\n\nUpdate: The above questions have been addressed in this question, but there is a more serious issue — potentially, a missing sudden motion shock sensor in the optical drive.\n\nA: *\n\n*Overheating shouldn't be an issue. The SuperDrive probably runs\nhotter (when it's in use) since it has moving parts\n\n*An SSD would most likely improve performance (especially if you use it as your boot drive and place for applications)\n\n*Don't know about battery life, but I imagine if you you use this as your boot drive, and the stock hard disk as your \"slave\", you might actually see an improvement (again, fewer 'moving parts')\n\n*This will void your warranty, but if you're careful you might be able to get in and out without leaving evidence of tampering. Consult iFixit's guides for tips\n\n*I can't imagine there would be a noticeable weight difference. \n\n*Steve is dead, unless you're talking about Steve Zahn. Steve Zahn doesn't care what you do with your computer.\n\n\nA: I've done this to my own MacBook Unibody Late '08 earlier this year.  In answering each query, this is what I've noticed...\n\n\n*\n\n*Overheating:  My machine has recently started over heating but it's hard to attribute this to the SSD/HDD combo.  Most heat is coming not from where the SATA bays are located, but rather where the USB ports etc. sit.\n\n*Performance: has massively improved, but without a shadow of doubt, as the months have gone by, it has deteriorated.  I still get lightning boot ups but apps are not as quick as they were.  Please not that most 3rd party SSDs under Snow Leopard and above have no TRIM support.  I've only just enabled mine through back door command line methods, which as with anything command line, may not be 'ideal' for the light-hearted user.\n\n*Battery life: has definitely decreased.  In place of my optical bay is a 7200RPM hard drive, which takes more power than a standard 5400RPM.  Also, given that you would be using your HDD a lot, unlike your superdrive which you use more occasionally than constantly (I'm assuming), you can expect some decrease.\n\n*Warranty: Will be severed!\n\n*Weight: the SSD is lighter than the original HDD.  However, my new HDD and superdrive weight similar, the HDD 'feeling' heavier.\n\n\nI've just posted a query about my machine as I think the SSD is causing some issues.  The response to that may shed some further light on the topic.\n\nA: RE: voiding the warranty. When I recently bought my non-retina 13\" MBP, I told several of the Apple Store people that I planned to swap out the HDD for the SSD I took from my now-dead (logic board) 15\" MBP A1211, and that I realized I would void the warranty. They all told me that Apple considers the two drive bays \"user replaceable\" and that doing what I planned would NOT void the warranty. Specifically, I could put any SATA device in either bay. Anyone test this info?\n\nA: I can confirm that for the MBP Apple does not have a problem with users changing the drives.  It does NOT void the warrantee.\nMy experience: I have replaced the disk drive with a 512G SSD and replaced the optical drive with a 1TB disk drive.  I suspect that airflow is impacted as I feel that I run a bit hotter than before but I'm not really sure.\nBattery life is better if I'm not churning the fixed disk (ie only using the SSD or cache).\n\nA: I have a 2011 MBP 13\" with SSD and HDD attached into SuperDrive with LMP Disk Doubler (http://www.mzone.sk/disk-doubler-3653)\n\n\n*\n\n*Overheating - Didn't notice any overheating.\n\n*Performance issues - Works great. Made symbolic links to SSD home dir\n\n*Battery life - Maybe an overall 5-10min decrease.\n\n*Warranty status - I was in an App Store\n\n*Weight increase - No\n\nA: I have a 2010 MBP 15\" with two Seagate Momentus XT 750GB hybrid hdd's (Removed optical drive - OWC website) and is being used for music creation using Pro Tools. It gets so hot that you have to stop what you are doing sometimes for larger sessions and save and close. Turn everything off and reopen session. Definitely the hybrid drives causing the problem and it is extremely noisy when this is happening thus hurting music creation process. Battery life NO GOOD. So, my purchase should've been two 1TB SSD hard drives which are now available and that would have solved my issues. Not most people but mine definitely. Good Luck\n\nA: I moved the existing 750GB 7200RPM HDD from its factory location to the optical bay. I then installed a new 256GB SSD in the HDD's bay. I booted to recovery mode and copied the contents from the HDD to the SSD, then told the MBP to boot from the SSD.\nAfter that was all done, I reformatted the HDD and now only use it for extra storage. Mostly VMWare Images. It is configured to to boot un-mounted. When I want to use it, I run a mount command in my terminal window and it spins up and then is listed as an available drive on my desktop. When I am done with it I unmount it by right-clicking on it, and it spins down after one minute.\nDuring normal use, if I am not accessing it, it spins down after one minute.\nOverall I am very happy with the setup.\n\nA: It depends on your Macbook Pro.  I have first hand experience in this area regarding Apple's policies (many times).\nThe rule of thumb is: if the part is \"user replaceable\" then you can change it out yourself.  If it is not, or if you damage your system while performing the upgrade, then it technically voids your warranty.  \nYour MBP's manual will list the user replaceable parts.  Just google \"Macbook Pro\" plus the model designator (i.e. Macbook Pro 15-Inch Early 2011).  You can find this information in the Apple Menu under \"About This Mac\".\nSome Apple Retail Genius Teams are lenient in this regard and will diagnose and repair if your component is not the source of the issue.  However it is a grey area.  \n", "Q: Can an iPad work to replace a computer in terms of photo management? Our Mac is broken and we are contemplating not replacing it. One need we can't see a solution is replacing an iPhoto library with many 10 G of photos. Obviously we'd need to go for the 64 GB iPad if we wanted lots of pictures.\nMost of our pictures are in the 5 megapixel range (JPG between 2 and 4.5 MB each) and we expect to have between 5 and 10 thousand pictures to start.\nCan I just move an entire iPhoto library to an iPad? I'm looking for experience people have had managing a non-trivial amount of photos entirely from iOS. Obviously, we may need to still get a compute, but I wondered how \"PC free\" we might be able to be at this point in iOS and with apps that are available in late 2012.\n\nA: There are numerous hard drives that will work with the iPad. Some wireless, others via USB (with the camera connection kit). The lightening port is a whole other thing if you end up with the 4th gen iPad, though there might be a workaround.\nHere's a 1TB wired solution from HyperDrive\nHere's a 500gb wireless solution from Seagate\n\nA: If you are seriously contemplating moving from a PC to an iPad just for photo management, I would recommend a 128GB or 256GB iPad Pro along with an iCloud Storage plan of 200GB for $2.99/month or 2TB for $9.99/month (USA Prices, other countries may differ) if you plan on adding tons of photos later, especially if you take tons of photos from your iPhones. \nThis will not only allow you to move over all of your photos successfully without having to worry about space and securing your photos. This also gives you plenty of storage for other PC and iPad related content such as files and documents along with apps, games, music, videos and books.\nEven if you go for the 64GB version instead, always make sure that regardless of which size you pick, that you are backing up your iPad and that you have the photos saved on iCloud as well since anything could happen to the iPad.`\n\nA: An iPad can hold photos and can \"work on\" (crop, touch up, etc) photos with the appropriate software installed. iPads come with storage capacities of 16, 32, or 64 GB, some of which is devoted to system software. If you wanted to devote your iPad entirely to photos, it still could not come close to holding a 100GB library.\n\nA: No an iPhoto for Mac Library cannot be moved to an iPad. It requires OS X to run, not iOS.\n", "Q: What do I need to read/recover data from the hard drive of an Apple II CX? My father bought an Apple Macintosh II CX in 1990 and it survived until 2010, when the main harddrive broke down and despite trying multiple times, booting from floppy disks failed for an unknown reason. \nThe main concern is the external 800 MB SCSI harddrive that is intact and hosts files that need recovery. \nWhat kind of hardware and software (PC/MAC/Linux, anything goes) would be required to extract the data from the external hard drive? If there are several ways, what's the cheapest one?\n\nA: Wait and buy a used Classic mac with a SCSI port that works. Also Ultra SCSI cards for PC's go for $25 to $50 on the internet, so you could go that way with a cheap PC or borrow one.\nAny computer can image the drive into an ISO CD image so you can get it to a Mac to mount the filesystem and read things.\n", "Q: How do I view podcasts in a tiled artwork view using iTunes?

I have an older macbook pro - purchased in 2006.  Where can I purchase a mini-vga to HDMI adapter so I can watch movies from my macbook pro on my tv?\nThanks!\n\nA: You can't.\nVGA is an analog transmission standard, HDMI is a digital transmission standard. It's not just a matter of changing the connector, the signals they carry are fundamentally different.\nYou could look in to a USB 2.0 -> HDMI adaptor. Something like the ones on this page. Though how well those work depend largely on the graphics card in your Mac. The older Macs may not have enough horsepower in their graphics chipsets to drive a second display over USB at anything close to a decent resolution to use on a high definition television.\n\nA: The 2006 Macbook Pro actually has a DVI port. You don't need to use the VGA adapter that was included, but you will need a DVI to HDMI adapter which does not need the signal converted (same signal standard, different connectors). These are cheap at Monoprice (less than $4 for 3')\nhttp://www.monoprice.com/products/product.asp?c_id=102&cp_id=10231&cs_id=1023104&p_id=2661&seq=1&format=2\n\nA: DVI\nIf you indeed have a 2006 MacBook Pro, then you have a full-size DVI port, in which case you have two options for HDMI output:\n\n*\n\n*Get a DVI to HDMI adapter or cable. These are pretty cheap, since they're just passive adapters that convert the physical connections (the HDMI video signal is basically the same as DVI). However this option does not get you audio over HDMI. If you require audio, you can use a separate 3.5mm audio cable with the headphone jack (many TVs have a separate audio-in jack for one HDMI input), or try the second option.\n\n*Get an active DVI to HDMI converter. These have inputs for sound (either 3.5mm stereo jacks or Toslink, both of which the MBP supports), which will give you audio over HDMI, plus the video signal. This option is more expensive, but may be preferable if you require audio over HDMI.\n\nMini-DVI\nIf you have a 2006 MacBook (non-Pro), then you have a mini-DVI port, in which case your options are:\n\n*\n\n*Use a mini-DVI to HDMI adapter. This has the same limitations as the full-size adapter as detailed in the first item above.\n\n*Get a mini-DVI to DVI adapter and combine it with the converter listed in the second option above. One more piece to the puzzle, but it should work just fine.\n\nMini-VGA\nFinally, if you actually do have a mini-VGA port, which came on Most iBooks, G4 and G5 iMacs, eMacs and the first 12\" Powerbook G4, then you need to get a VGA to HDMI converter, and a mini-VGA to VGA adapter.\n", "Q: Any way to display the duplicated songs in iTunes 11? I recently upgraded to iTunes 11 (v 11.0 (163)) and the show duplicate feature has been removed. What tools or alternatives exist to display duplicates in iTunes?\n\nA: Apple have put the \"Show duplicates\" function back to iTunes 11. Go to View menu in iTunes and select \"Show duplicate items\"\nA word of caution though, iTunes shows many false duplicates for me, anything with the same track name appears to be shown as duplicate. I much prefer the way Tune Sweeper deals with duplicates, there's no false duplicates and you can choose to keep the highest quality track.\n\nA: There is another way.  Are you a Microsoft Excel geek??  I am.  Highlight the entire library.  Copy (Ctrl+C).  Paste Special (text) in to an excel sheet.  Next is up to you.  I wanted to look for duplicate song AND album.  So I concatenated the two in a column to the right (formula example is \"=C1&E1\").  Then in the next column over, use the countif formula to look for duplicates (\"=COUNTIF($D$4:$D$5447,D4\"). Anywhere the formula returns \"2\" you know there is a duplicate.  You can use a filter on that column to see them all very easily.  Now the hard part.  You have to go back one by one and delete you dupes.  \n\nA: There's a lot of applications out there that will do this. The feature in iTunes was never that good anyway since it didn't really let you compare files to make sure you weren't deleting the wrong files (like songs that appear in compilations, best-ofs, etc). \nProbably some free options out there, but Dupe Away is pretty good ($13). I'm sure some Googling might yield more results\n\nA: You can also try a cheaper ($0.99) alternative, even though it's not specifically made for the iTunes library but for the whole file system: Twins Mini.\nIt does work very well and it's pretty fast (analyzing my 140GB library takes about 2 minutes on an early 2009 iMac).\n", "Q: How do I stop apple from thinking I have two devices? I downloaded some apps on my friends iPad using my own apple ID. I signed off but everything I downloaded went to my own IPad too. Now messages are popping up saying that I shouldn't delete certain things because they are on my \" other device.\" How do I fix it so where apple doesn't think I have two devices?\nAlso, I sure my act of deleting the apps I downloaded for her affected her own IPad.\n\nA: In iTunes sign in to your Apple ID.\nThen go to the iTunes store (top right), then click your account (top left). Once your account details load, there will be a section in the middle about iTunes in the Cloud. \nYou want Manage Devices on the right (but still in the middle) - click on it.\nFrom there you can review all devices and remove the ones you no longer care to have associated with your Apple ID.\n", "Q: How to I delete a song from ITunes and re-download all...I'm having trouble with a song I downloaded from iTunes.  I fixed it once before, but I can't remember what I did.  \nI have a song that I bought and it only partially downloaded (only the first 40 seconds play).  I paid for the song, so I can download it again to my iPhone and computer, but not until I figure out how to delete the one that only partially plays.  Otherwise, I don't get the option to download, only to \"play\".  Anyone know how I can delete the incomplete song from my iPhone so I can download it from scratch again?  \nI'm able to delete it from my computer, but when I synch, the stupid partial song gets added back.\nThanks!\nMichele\n\nA: You should be able to right click on the song in iTunes and \"Delete\" - it will then ask you if you want to delete the song from your computer as well, which you will allow. Then sync your device, which will remove the song that is on it (or just open up the music on your device and delete that individual song) - redownload the song, and put it back on your iPhone.\n\nA: There seems to be a common bug with iTunes downloads. You can read about it here: http://www.mcelhearn.com/2012/07/30/whats-going-on-with-truncated-itunes-downloads/\nAt the bottom of that blog post, it has a link to an app that can search your whole library for these truncated tracks, and puts them all in a playlist so you can delete and re-download them. http://dougscripts.com/itunes/scripts/ss.php?sp=findtruncatedtracks\n", "Q: Is it a good idea to seal off the optical drive bay after installing a second HDD? When installing a HDD instead of the SuperDrive:\nDoes the bracket, which holds the HDD, seal off the optical drive slot in the unibody?\n\nIf not, it seems that debris and dust could get in. (I guess it may depend as there are various types of bracket.)\nBut if it does get sealed, I wonder if closing that gap can negatively affect airflow inside the machine, and thus, risk overheating.\nAny thoughts?\n\nAlso, perhaps those bristles can be removed, and an aluminum/plastic filling could close it up? Something that would be flush with the outside. Is there something like that?\n\nA: Depends on your bracket/caddie style, but for peace of mind I would advise using electrical tape over the gap on the inside, any exterior covering cannot be less intrusive than just ignoring the hole. Airflow etc is not an issue.\nDebris entering the Mac isn't a huge concern as there are slots larger than the optical bay and unless your optical drive has massive amounts of conductive metal debris in it - leaving the felt-like skirt in place should suffice for all but the most messy environments.\nUnless you are also sealing the heat exhausts by the display hinge - sealing the optical slot won't matter either for good or for bad, so I'd say it's not a good idea to spend time/effort to further seal that slot.\n", "Q: What type of bracket to use for HDD/SSD in optical bay? (MCE vs. OWC) Looking for a bracket/adapter/caddy for installing a HDD/SSD where the MacBook Pro SuperDrive used to be.\nThere are two general types: \n\n1) Minimalist open-type brackets (in the truest sense of the word):\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Seems to allow airflow around the SSD/HDD, necessary?\n\n*Will it hold the drive firmly enough?\n\n*The OWC brand that I've seen is expensive. Are there cheaper alternatives to it? (Could not find.)\n\n\n\n2) Space-filling caddies that mimic the SuperDrive's shape:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Are these heavier? \n\n*Do they ompede ventilation around the SSD/HDD and promote overheating?\n\n*This is how the iFixit and MCE OptiBay enclosures look like, as well as the cheaper ones on eBay.\n\n\n\nWhat are their advantages/disadvantages? I have no experience with either.\nWhat are important things to look out for when choosing a bracket?\n\nI also know that the SuperDrive is fixed in place on the unibody enclosure at a lot of points — I wouldn't want to get a caddy that attaches with less. How can I ensure that with either type?\n\nA: The only really important thing when choosing a bracket is to get one of the correct height.  You can get 9.5mm and 12.7mmm \"tall\" versions, and some machines will only take the thinner of the two so choose carefully in that respect.\nOther than that, what is important is difficult to canonically state further it depends on what type of machine you are putting it in, and what sort of drive you will use etc, but I would have the following observations instead:\nOpen Bracket Type:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sometimes these are simply mounting brackets, without the SATA adapter mounted in the corner\n\n*If you are running a hot drive, then heat build up may be less of an issue.  However, keep in mind that this is an unlikely scenario with an SSD, and if you are using a traditional spinning platter drive, then this type of bracket may not provide optimally tight fixing (it's not screwed in on both sides) which could be a vibration problem\n\n\nCaddie type:\n\n\n*\n\n*These have a full height end plate where the CD is normally inserted.  It's important to close off the slot to prevent dust ingress, and if you don't want to tape to your case, then sticking a little strip of foam on here is an effective barrier\n\n*Not so much for Macs which always us a slot loading device rather than a tray system, but the caddie type usually comes with a fake CD-Tray strip that you can use to block off the hole in your case, which won't come with (or fit to) a bracket type device.\n\n", "Q: What is an SSD drive's negotiated link speed? When I look at my Apple SSD TS256C (Toshiba) in the System Profiler on my MacBook Pro (Late 2011), I see:\n\nLink Speed: 6 Gigabit \n  Negotiated Link Speed: 3 Gigabit\n\nWhy is that? Does that mean that the full 6 Gbit/s of SATA III aren't being utilized?\nStrange coming from an OEM drive...\n\nFor my SuperDrive it's even lower: \n\nLink Speed: 6 Gigabit \n  Negotiated Link Speed: 1.5 Gigabit\n\n\nA: In this case:\nThe Toshiba TS256C is operating at its fastest factory designed speed.\nBasically, you bought an Apple computer with an SATA III (6Gbps) interface and an SATA II (3Gbps) Hard Drive, and an SATA I (1.5Gbps) optical drive. If you were to buy a different model of SSD or ODD that is SATA III rated for speed you could take advantage of the 6 Gbps speeds on either interface.\nApple has been known by the spec tracking community to do this for various models since around the time they introduced SSD's. It's a silly thing to do for a company that only officially supports a couple of after market internal hardware upgrades, basically limited to Crucial branded memory, AFAIK. Why they cripple their machines this way is probably a business decision: it's cheaper and most consumers won't ever know/figure it out/be able to tell. \n\nA: Yes - at the moment - those link speeds are the theoretical maximum speed at which data can transfer to or from those devices.\nThe EFI firmware version on your MacBook Pro controls these link speeds as well as many other aspects of CPU throttling, so without reverse engineering that code - it's hard to know what or why the link may re-negotiate at a different speed. In the past, Apple has released EFI firmware updates to increase SATA link speeds for third party drives when they have done the engineering to make sure it will be stable enough - even if they don't support those drives. Of course they also release updates to improve their OEM parts in terms of speed and reliability so you can monitor those link speeds as well as your actual bottlenecks and submit bug reports if you feel things are not optimally configured - especially if you have some benchmarks or other data to show that case.\n\nA: I have a mid-2012 (unibody, non-Retina) MacBook Pro 13\" that I retrofitted with an OWC Mercury Electra 6G SSD, and my System Profiler reports \nLink Speed: 6 Gigabit\nNegotiated Link Speed: 6 Gigabit\n\nSo perhaps mine is faster than the OEM drive in your MacBook Pro.\n", "Q: How do I get my iphone to show up in iTunes 11 consistently? I upgraded to iTunes 11 today and my iPhone rarely shows up in iTunes. It almost never does through wifi (even though wifi syncing is on) and if I connect it with a USB cord, I have to restart the iphone for it to recognize that it is connected.\nWhat could the problem be? (iphone is not jailbroken and has latest iOS and Itunes is just updated) and how could I fix it?\n\nA: This is a partial answer, pertaining to the wifi problem. Upon re-reading the question I understand that the device may not appear when connected via USB either. I'm waiting for more information from the OP before tackling that. Meanwhile, this will be helpful to those suffering from the wifi sync issue, and might resolve the OPs problem:\niTunes not seeing the iOS device(s) is a fairly common and annoying problem with wifi syncing. I'm uncertain as to if it's a true bug or is  a system conflict within certain environments. \nFirst, you absolutely do not have to nuke your entire iTunes setup. \nGenerally you can get iTunes to recognize the missing devices  device(s) by opening Activity Monitor (Mac OS) or Task Manager (Windows) and killing the AppleMobileDeviceHelper service. Note: you don't want to uncheck (remove) the service in Windows, you just want to kill or restart it.\nIf that doesn't work, you can connect the device to the computer and use iTunes to deactivate, then reactivate sync over wifi. You need to apply the changes for both actions—just clicking the checkbox twice in succession won't do it. \nNeither of these solutions are permanent, though I can sometimes go months without a reoccurrence.\nReferences:\nApple Knowledgebase: iTunes 10.5 and later: Troubleshooting iTunes Wi-Fi Syncing\nOS X Daily: Wi-Fi Sync Not Working? Here’s How to Fix it for All iOS Devices\n\nA: This happens to me, too.  The computer is connected by ethernet to the wifi router.  Sometimes exiting iTunes and the re-launching works to get iTunes to see the iPhone.  (And connecting the iPhone to the computer by cable always works.)\n\nA: This is definitely an iTunes bug. What you can do is, on the iPhone, go to Settings > General > iTunes Wi-Fi Sync > and tap Sync Now. That often starts a sync, and adds the iPhone to iTunes, but not always for me.\n\nA: For me the following worked under Windows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unplug iphone from computer\n\n*Go to start menu/programs/ apple software (NOT ITUNES) update software\n\n*restart computer\n\n*plug in iphone\n\n\nA: Turning off wifi and turning it back on has always worked for me.  It was actually a more chronic problem before iTunes 11.\n\nA: This method works 100%... Well, there may be some exclusions regarding the battery life of the iPhone, iPad or iPod. I'd say as long as the device has 30% + battery life remaining or it's currently being charged that this will absolutely work.  \nI found that the easiest thing to do is to reboot your wireless router. This anyone can do easily and with consistent results. Immediately upon the normalization of the network iTunes would recognize all devices that are available and setup for remote wifi sync. \nI'm assuming this works due to a DHCP event forcing some type of broadcast to iTunes. The reboot causes a device to be reissued it's previous IP or be issued a new one. This occurrence forces a device to assert it's ip address (wether old or new) with all listening network devices, in this case iTunes. It's kind of like a change of address form from the post office. \nOh, snap! Sorry I didn't see that someone else had suggested the same thing.  \n\nA: Delete literally everything that has to do with iTunes or Apple from your computer. Start all the way over and download everything again. It was that simple.\n\nA: I had the same problem, but I figured it out. Click the button in the upper-rightish of the iTunes window (the one that says \"iPhone\" and has an eject symbol). If you click that button, it will switch you to a familiar iPhone-view window where you can manage your iPhone.\n", "Q: XeLaTeX doesn't have complete fonts I've just moved to OS X form Ubuntu.

I know that you can give launch daemons an initial niceness (but you have to manually renice them). I suppose it's also possible to write a script that sets the niceness of some Apps to -20 on system launch, but I would prefer a cleaner ans easier to maintain way to achieve this.\n\nA: Rather than using nice, you might be interested in an app that lets you delay the launch of certain apps for a few seconds after startup.\n\n\n*\n\n*DelayedLauncher \n\n*Exhaust \n\n*Startupizer\n\nA: Great idea by flackshak!

I am not sure if there is any difference.\nBooting in verbose mode shows the file names that were double-opened during repair attempts.\nAfter booting OS X from an external hard disk drive, Disk Utility fails mounting the main OS X volume straight away.

In the new version of iTunes 11 the find duplicates option is gone and I don't want to revert to iTunes 10 to get that function back.\nI know I had 1 GB of duplicates in iTunes 10, but I can't have iTunes show them to me anymore. My first thought was wondering if iTunes 11 finds/delete/merge them automagically?\nI mean, I know that I had two versions of \"Lemon Tree\", one is the original one and the other is a cover, but now I can't find the cover anymore. The same with other covers.\nI ran http://www.macroplant.com/meta-tunes/, and I only found 3 duplicates, while I am sure I had 100+ duplicates, because last sunday I imported a lot of songs and the \"find duplicates\" found 800 MB. \nIf anyone has insight into what iTunes 11 does when upgrading a library that would be a great start, but I'd prefer an ongoing plan to keep my library minimally duplicated.\n\nA: I found 160 duplicates with dupeGuru.\nBut, none of them can be found in iTunes, even if they are in the hard drive.\nLook: I have two identical copies of the same song on my hdd (same artist, same bitrate, same duration, different album), but when I search it in iTunes I can't find it.\n\nIt looks like iTunes found duplicated songs and removed them from the library (without removing them from the hard drive, though)\nMaybe that's why tools that scan the iTunes library file won't find duplicates, while tools that ignore the library file and scan the folder will find a lot of them.\nI arrived to the conclusion that iTunes will \"hide\" songs if it thinks that it's an exact duplicate.\nMore proof.

Obviously, this takes time and will destroy any data I have on the disk. Is there a way to check for bad blocks without formatting the drive, or even remap the disk to ignore those blocks (ultimately fixing it)?\nMy Mac is pretty recent (Mac Mini late 2011), so I doubt it has anything to do with low memory or swappage.\n\nA: I'll answer the \"bad blocks\" tack and you can ask a follow on question if you still have slowness and you have concluded that it's not simply bad blocks. (Bad blocks is almost never a slow issue - since the system can remap blocks so rapidly, that you'd need rafts and rafts of them to actually impair I/O. If you do have bad blocks, they can corrupt some of the data on the drive and a reinstall not only fixes that, it forces writes to detect more bad blocks - kind of a win/win situation).\nYou need no extra tools to see the health of your drive.\nOpen Disk Utility and select the physical drive itself (not the Macintosh HD or whatever the partition/volume is) and select info.\n\nIf you record and watch the values under S.M.A.R.T.

I have no idea where you live but in the U.S. companies can sue you for criticizing them.\nHowever, based on his experiences with a \"famous tool\" I would suspect it's initials are TTP.\nFrom what I can tell, that product doesn't seem to do a very thorough job of doing anything. I've read reports that all it was doing was a raw read of a hard drive and flagging I/O errors as sector problems whenever it felt like it. It misses drive problems. I've seen this first hand, and it costs $100.\nI've never used Drive Genius so I don't know anything about it. I can, however, speak of both Spinrite and Scannerz.\nSpinrite uses what I consider, at least in its re-write mode, a very, very risky procedures. It attempts to read and then re-write a sector to a drive. This is OK if the source of the problems is actually a sector failure, but intermittent cable failures can cause the exact same problem. In other words, if an intermittent cable failure corrupts data transfer between the CPU and hard drive, it could very well end up first reading corrupted data from a hard drive and then re-writing it over good data. The potential for corruption in such a case is high. Spinrite is an ancient product developed for PC's back in the early '80s.\nScannerz actually isn't actually hard drive testing software, it's fault detection software. It monitors for I/O errors and timing irregularities, and it appears to do so based on a statistical model of the drive/system performance. The \"rule\" with Scannerz is that if a problem is repeatable from scan to scan then the problem is with the media itself, and it will be either a bad sector or a weak sector. If the problem isn't repeatable on a scan, then it's likely another fault such as a bad cable or cracked trace in the logic board. Scannerz has an overwrite mode, but their manuals warn about using it quite heavily, as does the product which will throw out an a warning dialog about using it. Most if not all of the procedures they use for correcting problems are done using standard tools such as Disk Utility. I could teach my dog to do a basic scan on a drive with Scannerz, however to utilize it to its fullest potential requires at least a moderate amount of knowledge as to how a system works.\nI have personally witnessed Scannerz picking up bad cables on an external hard hard drive. You can actually fool with a cable during a scan and watch irregularities and errors crop up as the faulty cable is moved around. To the best of my knowledge, no other tool on the market can detect that.\nWith all that said, regarding other tools, the idea of using an old MS-DOS based tool such as Spinrite or something from a Linux distribution is likely impractical for most Mac users.  I would be willing to bet most Mac users aren't even sure what Linux is, and they often likely don't know (or want to know) how to specifically isolate a drive so a product with its origins in MS-DOS can work, and potentially damage their drive. Such tactics may be OK with hard core techies, but they're utterly impractical for most people. I would also add that applications that appear to be doing little more than exec'ing system calls to the command line version of Disk Utility aren't terribly impressive, IMHO.\n\nA: Use disk utility to find out the device name (e.g. \"disk4\") then in a Terminal window try\nsudo dd bs=1m if=/dev/disk4 of=/dev/null\nThis will try to read the entire drive contents.\n\nA: Try to use stellar drive defrag\n\nA: Before you start doing anything like this, open Console.app (I believe the English name is) which allows you to see if any I/O errors have been logged.  If you see I/O errors you should immediately prepare to migrate to a new drive, as it means that your drive has run out of spare sectors for this purpose and it will only get worse.  A typical way to do this is to use Time Machine to create a backup, and then change the drive and then reinstall OS X anew, and tell the installer to reestablish from Time Machine.  \nPersonally I used a simple shell script that went through all files on disk and used dd to read them (and print any read errors while continuing).  I then renamed the files containing the bad blocks so I would not use them again.\n\nA: Disk Warrior is for repairing index files on drives that have corrupted index files. A corrupted index file often makes the drive unusable. Drive Genius can do some index repair but it's best known for defragmentation. Its surface scanning is very basic. An entire list of drive testing tools can be found at the following:\nhttp://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1544280\nI'm familiar with Scannerz, because I'm cheap! :-)\n\nA: \nDo you recommend Scannerz? If so, please add some technical explanation for the recommendation; and consider a separate answer. (I can't vote up this answer whilst DiskWarrior is amongst the three products.) – Graham Perrin Apr 19 at 19:38\n\nI'm not sure \"recommending\" products on this forum is really appropriate, since it might be taken as spam. What I will do is tell you my own experience with Scannerz and another \"famous\" much more expensive tool.\nWe had several older systems in house, all PPC, all running Leopard that we needed to sell. Several of these items (about 5 if my memory serves me correctly) were showing what I could only call odd behavior. They would periodically give us the spinning beach balls, lock up a little, etc. We ran the \"famous\" tool on them to do diagnostics, and AHT on at least 3 of them. They all came back with a clean bill of health. I thought, \"Well, it must be my imagination.\" Within a month of selling them, we received notice from each buyer that the units were broken. We gave these things a 90 day warranty so our only option was, at the customers discretion, either refund the money and the shipping costs, or repair the systems at our expense and ship them back.\nIn each case, it was the exact same problem: the hard drive either failed or was in the process of failing and neither the \"famous\" tool or AHT picked it up. We had more units to process, and having learned my lesson, this time we ran across some more units with similar problems. This time I was aware it was likely a drive problem, so I opened up /var/log/system.log and used the \"tail\" command to follow what was going on. I did this while using the \"famous\" tool. I/O errors would show up and the \"famous\" tool would not so famously miss them...lots of them.\nScannerz was new on the market and it was cheap, so I figured I might as well give it a shot. Scannerz was picking up every single problem plus others! It was not missing the problems the \"famous\" tool missed. In addition I found that if a unit had a bad internal drive cable, I could open the unit up, start a Scannerz session, and probe the cable with a non-conductive probe and Scannerz would either start tossing out tons of errors or irregularities.\nThe only tools I will use are Disk Warrior for fixing drive index problems Disk Utility, for some reason, won't touch, and Scannerz for evaluating drive problems. That's my choice. Those are tools I trust. Period!!\nIf you need technical details regarding how Scannerz contact the people that make it. They have marketing contacts and support contacts on their web site.\n", "Q: The encryption of an external drive in 10.7.5 does not seem to work. \"Conversion Status: NoConversion\" On a Mac running OS X Lion 10.7.5 I have attempted to encrypt an external drive using Disk Utility.\nSince this is 10.7, there is no option of right-clicking to encrypt in Finder. Also, there's no option to create an encrypted partition when formatting. So, here's what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*I reformatted the drive like this:\n/dev/disk1\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *2.0 TB     disk1\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk1s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Heap                    1.7 TB     disk1s2\n   3:                  Apple_HFS Time Machine            300.0 GB   disk1s3\n   4:       Microsoft Basic Data EXCHANGE                49.5 GB    disk1s4\n\n\n*Then I wanted to encrypt all Apple_HFS partitions, starting with Heap. The only way to accomplish this using the GUI seems to be the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the volume you want to encrypt in the sidebar on the left side.\n\n*Select the tab \"erase\" on the right side.\n\n*Choose an option of your liking in \"Format:\"\n\n\n*Click \"Erase...\" to reformat the partition as an encrypted volume. You have to create a password to continue.\n\n\n*If this were Mountain Lion, this would be it. All I'd have to do is waiting for the encryption to finish. So, I checked the status in the terminal using:\ndiskutil cs list\n\nAnd to my surprise there's no conversion happening:\nSequence:               2\nEncryption Status:      Unlocked\nEncryption Type:        AES-XTS\nEncryption Context:     Present\nConversion Status:      NoConversion       // OH NOES!!! WHY THIS? WHY ME? :(\nHas Encrypted Extents:  Yes\nConversion Direction:   -none-\n\nBut I did expect something like this:\nEncryption Status:           Unlocked\n    Encryption Type:         AES-XTS\n    Conversion Status:       Converting    // This is what I expected.\n    Conversion Direction:    forward\n    Has Encrypted Extents:   Yes\n    Fully Secure:            No\n    Passphrase Required:     Yes\n\nQuestion\nWhat is going on here? Am I just interpreting the diskutil output the wrong way?\n\nA: I believe you need a Recovery HD on that volume to let FileVault 2 do it's business. Here's the article on how to FileVault 2.\n\n\n*\n\n*OS X: About FileVault 2\nI believe the section where it says FileVault 2 requires OS X Lion or Mountain Lion and Recovery HD installed on your startup drive is not technically correct, since the keys to decrypt an external drive would only be stored on the internal drive of the Mac doing the encryption.\nI know this isn't true since I've had encrypted external drives that I've taken to several Mac and had all of them read it. You could start by letting Time Machine encrypt the external drive since that's the canonical GUI manner to get FileVault 2 on an external drive.\nYou can do everything in terminal though. Here is your recipe - bookmark this guy's web site - Rich is an asset to the community for documenting how to wrangle encryption and many other things.\n\n\n*\n\n*Encrypting 10.7 non-boot volumes without erasing them\nHere is what a functioning external without FileVault 2 looks like to me (warning - this is all on Mountain Lion).\n/dev/disk2\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk2\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk2s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS HEAP                    10.0 GB    disk2s2\n   3:                  Apple_HFS Time Machine            300.0 GB   disk2s3\n   4:       Microsoft Basic Data EXCHANGE                189.6 GB   disk2s4\n\nSo, you can convert things thusly:\nAir:~ me$ diskutil cs convert /Volumes/HEAP -passphrase\nNew passphrase for converted volume:\nConfirm new passphrase:\nStarted CoreStorage operation on disk2s2 HEAP\nResizing disk to fit Core Storage headers\n[ | 0%..10%.............................................. ]\n\nAfter a short delay, the progress will end and you will get this notice:\nAir:~ me$ diskutil cs convert /Volumes/HEAP -passphrase\nNew passphrase for converted volume:\nConfirm new passphrase:\nStarted CoreStorage operation on disk2s2 HEAP\nResizing disk to fit Core Storage headers\nCreating Core Storage Logical Volume Group\nAttempting to unmount disk2s2\nSwitching disk2s2 to Core Storage\nWaiting for Logical Volume to appear\nMounting Logical Volume\nCore Storage LVG UUID: 4FA72C96-80B5-4794-B6C9-D5E94B3194C8\nCore Storage PV UUID: A60F4F77-18F7-4972-9A37-4873390BE326\nCore Storage LV UUID: 02A09627-7955-4671-84F7-BD26FE1D9B93\nCore Storage disk: disk3\nFinished CoreStorage operation on disk2s2 HEAP\nEncryption in progress; use `diskutil coreStorage list` for status\n\nSetting aside whether Lion has the same output (since it likely will not end the command until the encryption is done) - here is the end result of what the diskutil list command shows once the external has been encrypted:\n/dev/disk2\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk2\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk2s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage HEAP                    10.0 GB    disk2s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk2s6\n   4:                  Apple_HFS Time Machine            300.0 GB   disk2s3\n   5:       Microsoft Basic Data EXCHANGE                189.6 GB   disk2s4\n\nIt appears that disk2s6 gets shaved off the 10.0 GB disk2s2 and serves to hold the keys for [en|de]crypting HEAP.\n", "Q: Why doesn't iPhoto open automatically upon SD card insertion? Inserting a SD card no longer opens iPhoto.  When I open iPhoto, it does not show the SD card in the left pane.  This program has done this without a problem until recently.  The preference under iPhoto is set to SD cards to open iPhoto.  I have also gone to Utilities/Photo Capture and ensured that iPhoto was selected in the lower left corner.  I am at wits ends because this should work automatically but is no longer doing so.  Any answers out there?\n\nA: A common fix for these type of issues is to reformatting the card with the camera and try inserting it again. Make sure you copy the photos from the SD Card to your computer first.\n\nA: You can change this behavior by using Apple's Image Capture utility to set defaults for each device. (See Picture)\nIf this doesn't work your card is not recognized as a Photo Card\n\n\nA: Open iPhoto, and then drag the SD card symbol that is on your desktop, into a folder in iPhoto (you can create a folder and name it whatever you want). Then iPhoto will import all the contents of that SD card!\n", "Q: Putty - equivalent Mac SSH client and commands I'm trying to find out what the equivalent Mac SSH client is and set of commands are that would achieve the below. In Windows we use the Putty CLI utility 'Plink' to set up a SSH connection to a SSH server for web proxying purposes.\nplink -l username -pw password -D 8080 -P 443 -ssh 1.2.3.4\n\nThis command establishes a SSH connection to host IP: 1.2.3.4 over port 443 using the username and password specified. It then presents a local port (8080) available for other applications on the local host to connect to, for example a web browser. Within the web browser we configure a SOCKS proxy using our own IP address or 'localhost' as the proxy server, with port 8080.\nI don't know enough about Mac to replicate this putty tool's function and it's not a standard ssh client and I haven't seen plink documented to map things to a unix situation.\n\nA: This is standard ssh and covered in the man page for TCP forwarding.\nssh -f -L 8080:localhost:443 1.2.3.4 sleep 10\n\nI changed as little from the manual page (8080, 443, 1.2.3.4) so you can find it and the explanation there on OS X.

It only happens intermittently. Has anyone ever seen this or have an idea of why this might be happening?\n\nA: I've seen this, can't reproduce it, but it's a glitch in Finder's Arrange By options, and can be fixed by leaving Arrange set to None.\n", "Q: How to not sync apps to iTunes 11 Since iCloud now offers a way for me to download apps directly from the cloud and I only want to keep updating the apps I use on my iOS device and not all that I have, I wanted to keep all my apps only on my iPhone.\nSo I followed this page, but apparently on iTunes 11 I can't unsync my apps. If I want o sync with iTunes, I need to sync my apps (at least the ones that I have on my device).\nThe iTunes help pages, though, show a checkbox before Applications, under the Apps menu on my device section on iTunes. Is that a bug then? Or it is just a settings I can enable. I don't want to keep any apps on my Mac, but I don't want also my device to stop synching with it.\nUpdate: I've got a bug report open since 19-Feb-2013 that got some updates from a Apple dev requesting info (which I provided), but still no further comments and fixes. Unfortunately there is not link for it, since bug reports from Apple are private, but the details are above:\nBug ID #: 13051820\nBug Title: Not being able to sync with iTunes without loading apps from iOS\n\n\nA: I am not sure that is what you want but here is what I've done.\nI keep my apps sync'ed and let iTunes download everything on my Mac.\nHowever, as I do not want my main HDD to be filled by these apps, I moved them to an external backup drive.\nTo do this, I go to the 'Apps' section of my 'Bibliothèque' (I have a french version of iTunes, but you can find it in the listbox that is in the upper left corner of iTunes main window).\nThere, I choose an app, right click and 'display in Finder'.\nHere you are in the directory where all apps. You can move them elsewhere or simply delete them. After that iTunes will just warn you it cannot find the app anymore, but at least the deleted apps will not be copied anymore to your Mac.\nOf course, you will still have to wait that synchronization copies your newly installed apps to your Mac, but once you've deleted the app on your Mac, it will not be sync'ed anymore.\n\nA: The checkbox has finally been found!\nIn iTunes Preferences, on the Store tab, in the Automatic Downloads section, you will find there is an Apps check box.  Change that to off and then click OK.  Please be careful, as it seems to need some time to really store the updated preference.  Double check by selecting Preferences again.\nPlug in the iOS device.  It will continue step 7 if you cancelled it in the last sync.  Please wait patiently until it is finished.  Then, in the next sync when the iOS device is plugged in, step 7 will never appeared again.\nFor more information:\nHow to stop syncing apps with iTunes without wiping them from my iPhone?\nhttp://www.pcworld.com/article/2019315/how-to-go-back-to-itunes-10-part-2.html \nThis is not a solution to get the check box back, but just to revert to itunes 10 (I like it better than iTunes 11).\n\nA: It seems there is no way to stop iTunes 11.4 from syncing apps back to iTunes from my iPhone. BUT... I think at least I found a way to prevent it copying them back to iTunes/my HDD:\nClose iTunes. Find out where your 'Mobile Application' folder is located on your HDD. Delete it or put it in the trash at least.\nThen open Terminal and change to the folder iTunes Media folder. If you don't know how to do that type 'cd' (without the quotes) plus a space and then drag the parent folder of your 'Mobile Applications' folder (normally the iTunes Media folder) onto the Terminal window. It should paste the location.\nThen create a symlink to any location on your HDD, doesn't matter where. Example:\nln -s path/to/target/location Mobile\\ Applications\n\nCreate a folder called 'Mobile Application' in that target location (although I'm not sure it's even necessary).\nNow you have an Alias (sym link) in the iTunes Media folder pointing to a different location. \nSince my iTunes somehow can't deal with sym links it will try to sync back the apps from my iPhone but won't copy any of them in effect. \nIt's not perfect because you still have to wait out the step where it tries to sync back the apps. But at least it won't copy anything and it's faster.\nOne note: my iTunes Media folder lives on an external drive. I can't really say if iTunes behaves the same if you have yours in the default location in your home folder's music folder.\nBut give it a try.\n", "Q: The space in the others section of iTunes is taking 1.85GB I have an iPod touch 4g on iOS 6.0.1; 8GB.

I did this 5 times and Others remained at 1.99GB.\nNOTE: I don't have any music and removed all mail, music, and contacts for this.\nI tried deleting the music folders of iTunes from diskaid and Others dropped to 1.85GB. That still seems like too much.\nWhat should I do?\nUPDATE: i dont have any big apps except FIFA 13. All othersare less than 100MB each. Excluding FIFA 13 all the other apps and photos takes 547MB.\n\nA: Even with 10 apps, make sure none of them is containing lots of documents (e.g., an eBook or comic book reader).\nOr download iExplorer (free for file system access) and browse through the content of your device.\nAlso, you can try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your device to the computer.\n\n*Open iTunes and select it.\n\n*Go to the Applications tab.\n\n*Scroll down to the Share Files section and.\n\n*Select every app one by one and see what documents can be transferred to your computer (you'll be able to check its size).\n\n", "Q: What should I do for iTunes before reinstall win7? I have backuped my apps, books and songs in iTunes, but how about the data in apps, such as the saved angry birds' progress, the pdf files in adobe reader and so on?\n\nA: You can save the whole iTunes folder(it should be at ../Music/iTunes directory) and just put it back after you reinstall iTunes on your new Windows system (new iTunes installation will put it's new \"blank\" folder in /Music, just replace with your backup copy).\nBy doing so iDevices will recognise your library as the one they had synced with before and will continue to sync with it like nothing happened, hence keeping all the saves on the devices.\n\nA: In addition to nkukushkin's answer, if you have any purchased iTunes content (videos, songs, etc.), you should deauthorize that computer from your iTunes account. You only get 5 authorizations per account, and one you do a reinstall, the only way to get it back is reauthorizing all your computers, which can only be done once per year.

Will I have a new iCloud and she have mine? Or will that all change also? Will the apps come back or do they delete?\nI don't want any old contacts texing her or old photos popping up when its her phone!\n\nA: Back up the 4S (either to your computer or iCloud), then when you set up the 5, select to restore from the old 4S backup. That will restore your iCloud account, and all apps and content.\nOnce the 5 has been successfully set up with your content, wipe the 4s (Settings → Reset → Erase All Content and Settings) and set it up from scratch, with a new iCloud account for your wife (unless she has an existing one).\nIt's important to note that your phone account is tied to the SIM card in the phone, so calls and SMSes sent to your existing number will still go to the iPhone 4S, and the iPhone 5 will be linked to your wife's account. To change this, you need to swap the SIM cards, which is easy to do, except the iPhone 4S uses a micro-SIM, whereas the 5 uses a nano-SIM. You're likely going to need to talk with your phone provider to reprogram the SIMs, or get new ones of the proper sizes.\n", "Q: How can I have Mission control, but just for one application?

Once you've fixed up the default route as you describe in the question, you're still left with the problem that Mountain Lion is giving its bridge interface address to clients as both the router address (which is correct) and as the DNS server address (which isn't).\nVerify that this is the problem by entering an HTTP server IP address into the address bar on a client web browser when connected through your Mac after you fix default routes, and it should load up fine.\nMy solution to this problem is to fix up the route as you describe -- which could be automated, of course -- and to keep BIND (aka /usr/sbin/named) running in the background on my Mac in a forward-only configuration, forwarding all queries to Google's public DNS servers. This doesn't fix the underlying brokenness in Mountain Lion, but it makes things start working for the clients.\nA couple useful resources:\nhttp://www.macshadows.com/kb/index.php?title=How_To:_Enable_BIND_-_Mac_OS_X%27s_Built-in_DNS_Server (how to fire up BIND on OS X)\nhttp://gleamynode.net/articles/2267/ (how to configure BIND for forward-only operation -- of course you will not want to make BIND only listen on 127.0.0.1)\nIt would be far preferable for Apple to make this feature of their OS work as advertised, but in the meantime I've found this is a viable workaround.\n\nA: Actually, there is a bind process started after activating internet sharing:\n22.12.12 09:21:01,687 named[23072]: starting BIND 9.8.3-P1 -c /etc/com.apple.named.proxy.conf -f\n\nThe config in /etc/com.apple.named.proxy.conf forwards dns requests to reasonable DNS servers.\nThe problem is that the named daemon doesn't stay alive.

I wonder if the 2 cameras inside an iphone 4S are of the same type?\n\nA: No, as noted in Apple's specifications, the front camera is VGA (640x480), whereas the rear camera does 5 MP stills and 1080p video. This is confirmed in iFixit's teardown of the 4S.\n", "Q: Preview: reorder pages in pdf increased file size? I have scanned 58 pages into a PDF. The file size of this orginal pdf was 8 MB. Unfortunately the page order was a little messed up when I scanned so I used Preview to reordered some of the pages by simply dragging the pages around in the thumbnails bar. After doing this and saving the pdf the size had increased to 23 MB! What happened? And how do I reduce the file size?\nI tried the reduce file size quarts filter but it reduced the resolution which made the pdf unusable.\nI see no reason for the file size to increase from just reordering existing pages, is there?\n\nA: I found out that it has to do, in my case, with embedding Types. \nafter combinig them with preview or (I use a lot of chapters) the free tool PDF Merger Free (or in your case, reordering), it seems they swallow the whole fontbiblio (well, guess not, only feels like), so I drop them on the app PdfCompress (https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/8823/pdfcompress), in which preferences I choosed, without touching the compression Size (just in the middle), as fonts base 14, or none (this is risky, don't do it without checking your whole Dok afterward, makes funny things if the fonts aren't standard).\nHope this helps...\n", "Q: Running actions when I disconnect external monitor I would love to auto start Bartender (by the way, excellent app that hides some of your notification area icons) when I unplug my external monitor from my Mac.\nIs there any app or script that could do that?\n\nA: Try ControlPlane. It allows you to trigger various actions, including launching applications, based on a variety of \"evidence sources\" (which include which monitors are connected). Have a look at the full feature list, but it should accomplish what you're looking for.\n", "Q: In iTunes 11, how do I download all existing shows for a podcast? Recently, I've started listening to more podcasts on my iPhone. I've found a few that I like and want to listen to past episodes. Ideally, I want to just download. I can't seem to figure out a way to queue up all unplayed episodes for download in iTunes.\nI found in the settings for the podcast I can have it automatically download all new episodes, but this doesn't apply for older episodes.\nIdeally, I don't want to have to click the download button for each episode (there are a couple hundred episodes).\n\nA: Right click the podcast in your list of subscribed podcasts and there should be a \"download all\" option. Just found this myself after agonizingly clicking each download link for a few shows.\nAddition:\nThe  list to click is  the  one  on  the  left side  of  the  screen,  not  with  all episodes open.

Some of my songs were in one (or perhaps a few) folders which no longer exist.  The songs exist in a new location.  I know I can just add the new location to my library, but all my playlists with those songs will be broken.  Any ideas on how to approach this?\nMaybe there is a file I can open in a text editor, and then replace the beginning of a lot of path names with the new path?\n\nA: How many songs? If it's just a few, then the easiest way is to do it manually. Just try to play the songs in question, and you'll get a popup saying the file couldn't be found, and offering to choose a new location. Do that, and select the file in its new folder. That will restore the file without breaking your playlists or metadata.\nIf you have more files than is practical to manually resort each one, you can edit the iTunes Library.xml file to do a find & replace, then scrap your .itl file and import the XML file, which will restore your playlists and files.\nFor more information on this process, read Apple's support site and this guide.\n", "Q: Want to increase spead and reponsiveness in older Mac Current Information:\nSoftware:  Mac OSX (10.5.8)\nProcessor:  2.4GHz Intel Core 2 Duo\nMemory:  1 GB 800 MHz DDR2 SDRAM\nI want to get my computer moving faster, specifically around safari, itunes, iphoto, etc. Would it be easier to just erase my entire Hard Drive (backed up of course) and buy Lion (10.7) or Mountain Lion (10.8) since I would have to upgrade to snow leopard (10.6) before upgrading to Mountain Lion anyway?  Trying to be cost effective and keeping it simple and not compounding the issue of responsiveness and freezes.  \n\nA: Upgrading to Lion or Mountain Lion would not improve your Mac's performance. It may actually decrease performance as the newer versions of Mac OS X seem to require/want more RAM to run smoothly. Apple has increased the minimum amount of RAM in almost all of their line up to deal with this issue.\nYou currently only have 1GB of RAM... upgrading this would probably be the cheapest and most efficient method of speeding up your Mac. Freezing and unresponsiveness can be caused by lack of RAM. \nCheck out this Apple support article that will teach you how to use OS X's Activity Monitor to check whether RAM would improve performance.\nAfter determining whether or not you need more RAM (you do!), you can find out what kind by following these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the  in the Menu Bar\n\n*Click \"About This Mac\"\n\n*Click \"More Info...\" in the About This Mac dialog box\n\n*Click on the \"Memory\" tab\n\n\n*\n\n*Listed will be what type of memory you have and how much.

However, if I disable Wi-Fi on my iPhone and try to access the site using the AT&T 3G network.\nIf I disable Wi-Fi on my iPhone and try to access those sites using the AT&T 3G network.\nTo try to resolve this, I have shut down and restarted all devices (OS X and iOS) and then unplugged my cable modem and my Airport Express for 20+ plus minutes. \nAny other thoughts?\n\nA: Turns out the issue was indeed not with my system but with my hosting company. I'm not completely clear on how it happened, but my IP address found it's way on a blacklist, the result of a failed SSH login attempt. Though, to the best of my knowledge, I had not tried any sort of SSH login. \n\nA: Judging on what you have said in the comments (and my past experiences) my assumption is that your ISP's DNS server has not yet propogated - IE, your recent IP address change for your server has not yet been updated with your current ISP, but it has for your 3G ISP (wherever that is).\nTo test this theory, you could set your DNS server manually to, say Google (8.8.8.8 or 8.8.4.4) and see if your website works then - if so, this is most likely your problem.\n", "Q: nvram -p shows \"LocationServicesEnabled %01\" ... does that mean I have a GPS? What does LocationServicesEnabled mean on a MacBookPro Retina? \n\nA: Location services do not mean your computer has GPS capabilities but that it is using information that individuals provide, also google or other mapping servicing discover information from wifi broadcasts. Below is Apples take,\nYour approximate location is determined using information from local Wi-Fi networks, and is collected by Location Services in a manner that doesn’t personally identify you.\nIf you allow third-party applications or websites to use your current location, you are subject to their terms and privacy policy and practices. You should review the application’s or website’s terms, privacy policy and practices to understand how they use your location and other information.  Information collected by Apple will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at www.apple.com/privacy.\nMy take,\nThis can be fairly accurate as long as no one moves their wifi modem. For an example if an entire neighborhood moved two hundred miles away and did not change any settings (and were not remapped) ones computer would think it was in the original location.\n\nA: If your location services are enabled, all your MacBook needs is a Wi-Fi connection to figure out your approximate location, a lot like the iPod touch (see this question).\nIt does not have a GPS device to determine your location. This is described in HT4239.\n\nSummary\nLocation Services allow applications to use information from Wi-Fi\n  networks to determine your approximate location. In order to use\n  Location Services, you must have an AirPort connection that can scan\n  for nearby networks, and also a connection to the Internet.\n\n", "Q: Any way to automatically lock *Me* out from *My Own* iPhone for a specific amount of time? I am looking for a way to kick me off of My iPhone periodically for set periods of time to avoid getting distracted. Does anyone know of a way to achieve this? \nPS: Inspired by http://xkcd.com/862/\n\nA: Well, I guess you don't want to be distracted by yourself constantly touching you phone right? That's what I need too.\nMy way to do this is totally not recommended, but that's the only way I have in mind. Get a passcode, do like 11 false attempt, and you can lock yourself out for 15 minutes or more. It's something extremely stupid to do, and I don't recommend doing that or anything similar.\nJust in case some emergency happened, and you need to contact someone. You picked up your phone, and, ya. It's up to you.\n\nA: Set recurring alarms and then manually enable airplane mode or power it off as directed / previously agreed upon with yourself. \nWith the toolset that ships on iOS, it's easier to hack your perception of what you wish to achieve. The tools you need are there on the device, but it's not an automated tool to disable the device. \nOf course, there is no built in disable mechanism or even a timer you can set to turn off the screen - just alerts that trigger at a time or when you activate a geofence.\nIf you jailbroke your phone, you could probably use cron to schedule a shutdown event if you didn't mind an unannounced shut down of the OS.\n\nA: there is no automated way to enable Airplane mode, so you will have to disable it via the settings menu of your iPhone. If you have a Jailbroken one, there are numerous Cydia extensions that you can download which will help you schedule activation / deactivation of airplane mode. \nyou could used the app iSleepWell. It'll enable airplane mode whenever your phone is placed facedown. Also, LockScreenAirplaneMode app will give you an icon on your lock screen which will allow you to do this as well. Both these can only be activated if Cydia is installed.\n", "Q: iMessage coming up as new thread in text instead of continuation If a person adds a new e-mail account to imessage would it then come up as a different thread or contact in my iPhone?\nI received a message today from somebody I imessage and text daily, today when they imessaged it came up as a completely new text and an email address instead of a continuation of old conversation as it normally does, does this mean it is coming from a new phone number using e-mail account for messaging?\nare there any other possibilities as to why this would occur?\n\nA: Please, check if that new phone number is in your address book. I found that having all iMessage numbers and emails in the same contact card solves this issue.\n\nA: You're most likely correct - they're sending from a different address/number than before. I've had this happen with friends who got a new iPhone and set up their iCloud account for iMessage, but the phone number didn't activate properly (which happens at times).\nIt's not obvious, but you can check which address a contact is sending from by scrolling to the top of a thread in Messages, and clicking the Contact > button. The contact card will display with the sending address in blue. (*edit: the \"Contact\" button is only available when that particular contact is using a phone number, not an email address, for iMessage.)\n", "Q: Dictate and speak/read text from Terminal I have an idea in mind for a Terminal command I run often. I haven't found answers to these on my own, and they all have to do with voice/dictation:\n\nDictation in Terminal\nCan I dictate to the Terminal? I've tried the standard Fn-Fn, but it only plays the sound effect that it makes when you've cancelled it. No microphone bubble appears either. Is it not possible to do this? I notice that in the Edit menu of Terminal, I find that Start Dictation is not greyed out; it's still an option.\n\nI am positive that Dictation is setup correctly, it works great system-wide.\nReading output from Terminal\nCan I get the output of one Terminal window and have it read to me by the system (via AppleScript)?  I am essentially trying to reproduce this behavior with continuous output (I want every line that follows the first to be read):\n\n\nA: say. You can download different voices in Mountain Lion (not sure about older versions) and can be looked up from System Preferences\nUsage: say [-v voice] [-o out] [-f in | message]\n\nYou can use command | say to stream output of the command once its completed.\nThe famous Vicki voice from Portal.\nsay -v Vicki Do not adjust your screen. You will be assimilated. The process is quick and painless, stand by\n\n\nA: You can assign a custom shortcut for toggling speech in System Preferences:\n\nThere's probably a better way to do this with VoiceOver, but this would speak lines as they are added.\nset spoken to \"\"\nrepeat\n    tell application \"Terminal\"\n        set c to contents of window 1\n    end tell\n    repeat while c ends with linefeed\n        set c to text 1 thru -2 of c\n    end repeat\n    set tospeak to c\n    if tospeak starts with spoken then\n        set tospeak to text (count spoken) thru -1 of tospeak\n    end if\n    say tospeak\n    set spoken to c\n    delay 1\nend repeat\n\n", "Q: How to change the default file manager for OSX? I've downloaded muCommander and find it better than Finder. When I open folders with QuickSilver it still uses Finder, though. How do I change this behavior?\n\nA: You cannot change Finder. But you can download a third party file manager and add it to login items: System Preferences - users & groups - login items\n\nA: According to Apple Tech Note TN2062, you can replace the Finder by telling launchd to run something else upon login:\n\nYou can change the global Finder by changing the Program property of that plist. However, it is generally preferable to override the system-wide Finder by placing a modified plist in /Library/LaunchAgents.\n\nBe sure to read the entire thing for warnings. It sounds like a risky idea.\nIf that doesn't work, QuickSilver might be hard-wired to launch Finder. In that case, you will have to contact its developers and ask them for a new setting.\n(Note that things like the File > Open dialog will still use Finder, since that is part of the operating system.)\n", "Q: Can the playlists and ratings be recovered from iOS devices when an iTunes library is lost? I recently had to do a complete reinstall of my C: drive due to a catastrophic hardware failure. Unfortunately, the iTunes database and play lists and play counts were lost with no backup.\nFortunately, my iTunes media files were on D:, so I can re-import those songs and movies, but my playlists and other sync settings were lost.\nBoth my iPad and iPhone still have their synced playlists, but if I try to resync them - iTunes wants to erase them. I want to keep the the ratings and play count of 4000+ songs. My ratings and play counts feed into smart playlists to determine what goes into the limited space on my mobile devices.\nIs there a way to get iTunes to read and/or respect/not erase the ratings and play count from a device it has yet to sync to?\nWhat's the least amount of work I can do to recover this data from my iOS devices?\n\nA: On Windows I used SharePod for this some years ago\n\nSharePod is easy to use and works! Heres some of the main features:\n\n*\n\n*Add & remove music and videos from your iPod\n\n*Add, remove and edit playlists\n\n*Add & remove album art\n\n*View and backup photos\n\n*Copy music, videos and playlists from your iPod to PC\n\n*Import music/videos into your iTunes library, including playlists and ratings\n\n*Tag editing\n\n*Drag n' drop to and from Explorer\n\n*Simple, clean interface\n\n*Quick to load and use with no unnessary complicated features\n\n*Support for iPhone and iTouch\n\nAnd whats more, SharePod is completely free!

Is there a way to pull the audio from an iphone phone call to a mac either via bluetooth or USB? In other words, use the mac and a cellular phone hybrid?  I'd like to be able to record a phone call or voice mail to the mac.  \nI realize i could do this many other ways including using an true phone hybrid, but I'd like to keep the amount of equipment i have to take when traveling.\nI'm sure i could also use a TRRS Y cable from the headphone/mic jack into my mac, but i'd also like to keep it in the digital realm. \n\nA: Yes, you can do it, but you would require some professional paid apps for it like blue phone elite or phone amego.\n", "Q: Dysfunctional trackpad on 2007 Macbook I have a 2007 white Macbook here, of which the trackpad gradually became less responsive to the point where you can't press it down anymore at all. Neither the left nor the right button will physically come down, and it's not making the clicking noise either.\nWhen taken apart right to the point where the top case comes off, it suddenly worked again. Sure, the macbook was still off, but one could click it.\nThen I started to re-assemble the thing again, and kept checking when it lost functionality. Turns out right at the very last step, when the battery was popped back in, it got stuck.\nUpon closer inspection the cause is completely logical: the Li-ion battery pack was quite swollen, and was literally pressing up against the trackpad.\nMy question now is fairly simple: what should I do? What are my options?\n\nA: Your best option is to replace the battery. They are $129 at apple. My wife's 17in MBP had the same problem, noticed that her battery was swollen as well. As soon as we changed the battery, the laptop behaved properly again.\n", "Q: Are there viable and cheaper alternatives to Photoshop? Is there any software like Photoshop that can also open .PSD files? I don't need an enterprise / extremely feature laden editor, but I do wish to have the following required features at a price point less than a Photoshop license:\n\n\n*\n\n*Able to crop\n\n*JPG compression optimization\n\n*Work with layers\n\n*Able to open PSD format files\n\n*Save in PDF format\n\n\nA: You can try Gimp\nGIMP stands for “GNU image manipulation program”, and it is one of the oldest and most well known alternatives to Photoshop in existence. Although it doesn’t quite have all of them, you’ll find most of the features included in Photoshop somewhere in GIMP. GIMP is cross platform and supported by a large community.\nIf just having the feature set isn’t enough for you, there is an alternative based on GIMP known as GIMPShop. It’s the same as GIMP, except the layout has been structured as close to Photoshop as possible, so anyone making the transition should still feel right at home.\n\nA: I see many people that get both Pixelmator and Acorn after trying and deciding GIMP isn't their cup of tea. \nIn alphabetical order:\n\n\n*\n\n*Acorn - http://www.flyingmeat.com/acorn/\n\n*GIMP - http://www.gimp.org/\n\n*Pixelmator -http://www.pixelmator.com/\nAll three have serious image manipulation tools like layers, effects, vector drawing tools, advanced selection tools if you'd rather not go down the various versions of Photoshop path. You will be hard pressed to find image tools that don't open and save to .PSD so it's more a price, feature, use case decision since you have several good alternatives above.\n\nA: Best Answer is Photoline, although it is little hard to get use to but if you are a professional user you get use to it within 2-3 days and they have great tutorial on their site. \nI am also a graphic designer from India and Photoshop is too expensive somewhere around 1000USD or 50,000 India Rupees but photoline is Only 60USD or 3,000 India Rupees after using this software for around 1 month I found it can do all the work of photoshop and biggest thing is it support full CMYK and LAB color model and can export JPEG, TIFF in CMYK. One more thing it is very fast in opening of huge files It will take 5-8 Seconds for opening  150MB CMYK Tiff file (Dual Core + 4GB RAM, 64bit OS) \nSo give this a try \nNow about your requirement\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes it is able to crop.\n\n*JPEG Compression - Yes, and it can also save and open CMYK JPEG.\n\n*You can work with layers.\n\n*It can open PSD files with layers.\n\n*Yes it can export PDF.\n\n\nPRICE - Somewhere around 60USD and you can download a 30 day limitation free trial from their website www.pl32.com\n\nA: I think you'll find Pixelmator a good substitute for Adobe Photoshop.

So this makes me thing something is wrong. I've tried resetting the SMC and it has reduced the number of times the fans turn on, but still they turn on at low temperatures.\nAlso do the fans turn on based on temperature, or based on something else?\n(Also I've actually swapped the machine 4 times at the Apple Store (display issues), and the Manager told me this is the last time I can do that, so is there anything I can do without going to the Apple Store, like email someone at Apple?)\n\nA: \nthe fans aren't above normal (cant hear them)\n\nThat's due to the new asymmetric fan blade spacing apparently spreads the noise across a higher range of frequencies.\nsource:  http://appleinsider.com/articles/12/12/20/patent-filings-detail-retina-macbook-pros-quiet-asymmetric-fans \n\nA: I think those high temps are normal for the MBP Retina ... lots of people are complaining about it. My 15\" Retina MBP doesn't increase the fan speed until I render a HUUUUGE 3D komposition in After Effects, and even then the fans are not getting at full speed. So I took it to a Store and they tested it and everything seems to be OK. So i guess we just have to get used to those high temps ... whatsoever I use smcFanControl as an alternative to the MBP's fan control.\n", "Q: Is it possible to ask Siri to read dictated text? Speech recognition is very useful - when I'm driving I always use it for dictating text to my iPhone 5.\nHowever, before sending the message I like to check that the text was recognized correctly. Reading the text while I'm driving is not safe.\nIs there a way to ask Siri to read the dictated text?\n\nA: Are you just using the dictation feature (the microphone button on the keyboard), or sending email or texts/iMessages through Siri (holding down the home button, telling Siri to send a message…)?\nIf you're using the Siri function, when it prompts you if you want to send it, you can ask Siri to \"read it to me\" or \"review it\" and it will be read back to you.\nIf you're just using the dictation (which technically isn't Siri), your best option is to use VoiceOver, as Andrew Ferrier suggests.\n\nA: If you set up your iPhone this way (original instructions here), you can triple-click your Home button to activate VoiceOver, which is an accessibility feature primarily intended for reading the screen and other interactions for disabled users:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings -> General -> Accessibility\n\n*Change Triple-click Home to VoiceOver:\n\n\n\nIf you turn that on while in the car, and turn it off when you leave, it should hopefully be suitable for you.

It has been copied to my Media folder and it plays fine. But it's not listed in my Albums, Artists and Songs sections. I would like to see the artwork in my Albums or list of songs.\nI'm able to find the album by searching. What to do? Any ideas?\nI believe that adding it again might help, but how do I remove it from my library when it is not present anywhere except search results?\n\nA: *\n\n*Try pressing command+ L while the song is playing, this will take you to the song/album in your library. \n\n*Then right click and choose \"Get Info\" to verify the metadata for the song & album.\n\n\nIt may not be displaying as expected if the metadata for the song doesn't match the filenames.\n\nA: You can try to search in the playlist \"Recently Added\" for the items you have added. If they appear in there, right click the items and click on the \"Options\" tab and set \"Media Type\" to \"Music\".\n\nA: *\n\n*Find the song in iTunes:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the search tool in iTunes 11, type the song name to find the song. Once it is displayed, you should be able to click once on the result to go to the song.\n\n*Alternatively, you can press cmd+L while the song is playing as described by @DavidLumpkin.\n\n\n*One the song has been found, right-click on it and choose Get Info.\n\n*In the Info tab make sure that the Name, Artist, and Album fields contain the correct information.\n\n\n*\n\n*If there is any text - even a space - in the Album Artist field (highlighted in red), the song will be sorted under the Album Artist, instead of the Artist.

Worked for me.\n\n\nA: Under get info - make sure that the check box 'compilation' is unchecked. This will force the album to appear as an album and not a compilation..\n\nA: I have noticed that if I have two albums with different names but the exact same \"sort as\" under the \"album\" field in the Sorting tab, that one of the two albums will not appear in the Column Browser. For example, let's say I have one called Album A and another called Album B. If get info on a group of Album A songs and go to the Sorting tab, let's say it shows album = \"Album A\" and under that sort as = \"Album 1\". Now if I get info on a group of Album B songs and go to the Sorting tab, let's say it shows album = \"Album B\" and under that sort as = \"Album 1\". If that happens. Album B will not appear in the Album list in the column browser. But if I re-open the Album B songs and change sort as = \"Album 2\" (providing it's unique) then Album B will now appear.\nIn my opinion the sorting field should be used for sorting ONLY, but it doesn't appear to be designed that way - or else it's a bug. Based on the way the query works, it will lump two albums of different names under the SAME ALBUM NAME if the sort as field under album are not unique.\n", "Q: What charging mechanism to be used to maximise the battery life? So I got my first Apple laptop, a Retina MacBook Pro. Since macbook pro retina's battery are no longer easily switchable I'm concerned about it's life and would like to maximize it. I have few questions below. \nHow long it should be kept in A/C power? Is it okay to keep the laptop connected to A/C power more than 24 hours? Will it not be good for the battery if I keep it in A/C power more than 24 hours?\nIs it okay to charge the laptop when the battery reach 75% or should I wait till it goes to 50% or 10%? What's is optimal %?\nWhat's the best charging practices should I follow?\n\nA: The batteries on all 2012 models self regulate, self calibrate and don't care when you charge them.\nYou might reduce their total lifespan if you never ever ever take it off charge. Ideally drain it past 20% remaining (better to run it all the way down) once every few months. \nThese days, portable batteries are like sealed car batteries. Maybe go in to the shop once a year to have it checked, but otherwise you can forget \"caring\" for it other than avoiding excessive heat (90 degrees F and up). \nAny time you want, Apple can run extensive diagnostics on your battery (for free at the Genius Bar and also complimentary if you pay for AppleCare.)\n\nA: I dont think there is an \"ideal\" charging mechanism for your Macbook. If you use your Macbook and you are working with it close to a power socket you should absolutely have it plugged it. Why make the battery go through more charging cycles when it doesnt have to or work on reduced power. Apple recommends that every so often you should let the battery run down completely and then fully recharge it (perhaps every couple of months). Dont worry so much about your battery, the hardware and Mac OS software will take care of your battery by themselves. Enjoy using that Retina display :).\nA very explanatory video about Monitoring your battery on your Macbook can be found:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=zxE2FtWOYAU#!\n(I previously asked if calibrating the battery on a Macbook would preserve battery life and was given a very good answer by bmike found here Is it advisable to calibrate the battery on a MacBook?)\n\nA: Apple no longer recommends any sort of regular discharge of batteries. Both the batteries and charging systems are smarter now, and any \"maintenance\" procedures are just voodoo.\nAll of Apple's current laptop and portable products are self-maintaining in this regard.\n", "Q: How to recover iPod touch 2G stuck on green screen and Apple logo?

Forgive the long story, but I have a mix of old knowledge and unfamiliarity with Mac so I don't know what might be relevant. The tldr version is my iMac won't boot.\n\nTrying to put op an upnp server: Windows Server on my Leopard Imac I found afterwards that the service planted itself. Trying to quit the process, immediately triggered a sort of reboot screen, and the OS responded, but still the service was not quitted.\nI tried (I'm a former Win user, and not acquianted with unix - I picked up the command from a forum) with a sudo launchcntl -w to disable the service.\nBy doing this, the mac spinning wheel appeared and nothing responded anymore.\nI powered down the Imac. When trying to restart the boot reached the gray apple logo screen with the spinning wheel still there, as if it was still trying to disable WindowsServer. The keyboard locked immediately and caps light on.\nTried SMC reset, pram reset. As the keyboard was locked each time I tried, no luck. Now, the power button only responds when I first detach the power chord, and reattach it. Inserting the 1st install disk trying to boot from it and run diagnostics didn't work. Always the same screen with the spinning wheel, no keyboard response. DVD is even locked, and cannot eject it anymore.\nSafe boot of course doesn't work as not one keyboard is accepted.\nSo, I'm dead locked on all sides. Must admit that windows still gave you a chance to boot. This mac is dead on a service disablement process.\nThe damn keyboard locks, so I have no control. I whished there was a reset button like on the TC. \nWhat to do ? I have no idea. Backup is not available on Time Machine. \nDoes this need hardware repair or does someone have any ideas.\n\nA: This is a bit of a mess - but you could do one test to isolate the hardware from the software (and some of the hardware).\nPower off the Mac and pull the power cord. Disconnect everything you can - keyboard, mouse, etc... Take out all RAM - the manuals are at http://support.apple.com/manuals if you are not familiar with the safety precautions and tools needed.\nThen plug in only the power cord and wait a few seconds. If the Mac doesn't start up, press the power button once.\n\n\n*\n\n*You should get three beeps if the machine is healthy.\n\n*Power it off and put the RAM back in - be sure it's seated well / pushed in completely.\n\n*Connect only the mouse and power it on holding the mouse button down (button one if there are several).\n\n*The CD should come out if the hardware is healthy.\n\n*Shut it down (you can use the mouse or connect a keyboard if needed).\n\n*Now power on with the shift key held.\n\n\nAt this point, if your Mac booted, it's likely everything is fine and you can use Apple's support to troubleshoot the startup issue. If anything doesn't go like I mentioned - you should take a printout of this and what your results were and post here, or seek hardware help. \n", "Q: Can I use the same Time Machine drive with OS X 10.5 and 10.8? I have an external 500 GB hard drive that I used to use for Time Machine backups with my PowerBook G4 running OS X 10.5 (Leopard). However, I now use it with a white MacBook running 10.8 (Mountain Lion). The PowerBook backups are still on the drive (each machine gets its own directory by default), but I have not backed up the PowerBook since I started using the drive with the MacBook.\nMy question is, is it safe to do a backup of the PowerBook again? Does Time Machine in Mountain Lion do anything differently to the drive that would make it not work correctly with Leopard, or vice versa?\nI ask because the PowerBook is finally failing (occasionally boots directly to a kernel panic) so I'd like to do one last backup before it bites the dust.\n\nA: Yes - whether you have a USB or other direct drive or a network drive, Time Machine will cooperate with different Mac backing up to the same destination. \nThe only problem would be if you enabled FileVault on a direct attached drive since only Lion and later can read those. \n", "Q: External hard drive not indexed by Spolight on Mac OS X Mountain Lion I recently bought a new hard drive and it is not indexed by Finder. I tried to get it re-indexed by following this tutorial: http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13727_7-10330114-263.html and I even tried something with commands in the terminal, no luck to get it indexed. \nMy previous external hard drives (Western Digital SE Elements) that crashed were indexed, but I was using Leopard and Snow Leopard back then. \nI am using a Macbook pro 13\" mid-2009 edition and my external drive is a 500Gb Toshiba Stor.E Canvio.\nDoes it have to do that I uninstalled software I used back then on Leopard to be able to read NTFS drives?\n\nA: Esmitex, kindly try the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*From the Apple () menu, choose System Preferences.\n\n*Click Spotlight.\n\n*Click the Privacy tab.\n\n*Drag a folder or an entire volume (your hard drive) to the list.\n\n*If prompted for confirmation, click OK.\n\n*Remove the item or volume you just added to the list by clicking it\nand then clicking the minus (\"-\") button.\n\n*Close Spotlight preferences.\n\n*Spotlight will re-index the contents of the folder or volume.\n\n\nIf the steps mentioned above does not work, try downloading this supplemental update for Mountain Lion and repeat the steps above.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/DL1600\nHope this helps...\n\nA: From the Terminal application type the following:\nmdutil -s /Volumes/<your_disk_name>/\n\nIf indexing is disabled you will get something like that:\n/Volumes/<your_disk_name>:\nIndexing disabled. \n\nYou can turn it on by typing (it will request your password):\nsudo mdutil -i on /Volumes/<your_disk_name>/\n\nNow erase all the existing entries in the index for that drive (if any):\nmdutil -E /Volumes/<your_disk_name>/\n\nCheck that indexing has been enabled:\nmdutil -s /Volumes/<your_disk_name>/\n\nIf indexing is enabled you will get something like that:\n/Volumes/<your_disk_name>:\nIndexing enabled. \n\nNow just reboot your system or wait some minutes until Finder begins the indexing.\n", "Q: How can I set up a UK-based iPad with simple ongoing internet access for my grandmother? I've just donated a secondhand iPad 2 to my grandmother, with the intent that she can use it as her first foray into email, and possibly other things, given time. She has very limited experiences with technology (she has used typewriters, but nothing really more modern), so I'm trying to keep everything as simple as possible.\nIn particular, I'm looking for an easy way to connect it to the internet. We both live in the UK, but I live some distance from her and am not able to easily get physical access to the iPad to set it up. She has no ADSL/broadband at home and I'd like to avoid the complexity of setting it up, and she has limited mobility and lives in a rural area so getting to a phone shop isn't really possible. It's a 3G iPad 2, so 3G seems like the obvious option. Because she lives in a rural area, however, 3G access seems limited - the only networks that seem to have coverage are Vodafone, O2, and Orange.\nIs it possible to find an off-the-shelf, preconfigured SIM card that I can send her that she (or a friend) can just plug in? Ideally I'm looking for something with little to no upfront or ongoing configuration required on the iPad (or where I can do it in advance for her) to keep things as simple as possible. All the deals I've found so far seem to require configuration on the iPad, or ongoing top-up action on the iPad, which I suspect would put her off.\nAlternatively, are there any other connectivity options I'm missing?\nEdit: Unfortunately, my grandmother passed away before I had time to arrange this. So I won't be spending any more time on the iPad connectivity. Thanks everyone for your help anyway, much appreciated.\n\nA: I have two ideas for you:\n\n\n*\n\n*There's a UK mobile network called Ovivo, basically, you order a sim with £10 on it once, and you'll have 500MB of mobile broadband for your grandma's iPad forever.\nShe'll also be able to use the £10 for additional broadband if she runs out (either by pre-purchasing some — and maybe you could do that online for her), or it'll automatically take from it as credit.\nI think you can top up online with your card and manage everything for her. She'd just have to pop in the sim card.\nOvivo runs on the Vodafone network as a MVNO — so has good signal.\n\n*Alternatively, try GiffGaff (runs on O2 network), where you pay £5/month (no contract; you can stop anytime) for £500MB — Ovivo turns out cheaper; or £7.50 for 1GB.\nI think you can set up the actual account online from where you are; she'd just have to pop in the sim card.\nBoth are good value for money without any contracts, etc. You can stop/cancel at any time.\n\nA: Whats wrong with going to the next Vodafone/O2/Orange shop and getting a mobile data plan for her (e.g. this one or it's pay-as-you-use equivalent from Orange)? Then put the SIM into the iPad, set everything up and give it to her.\nIf you can't get access to the iPad so easily, select the data plan most suitable for her, document it in a way which she understands and send her to the nearest shop selling these kind of plans (with the iPad). They should be able to set it up for her.\nOTOH I think it will be rather challenging to get her started without assistance, especially as she doesn't seem to be used to computers at all. Maybe a christmas trip is the better approach here.\n\nA: You can get all the particulars of the iPad's radio (IMEI / ICCID / MEID as appropriate for the radio in that particular iPad) from the general settings (or by connecting it to iPhone Configuration Utility) and then walk into your convenient cellular store and have them set up service for that device and bill it to you. You can pre-screen coverage and support options before paying them money.\nMail the SIM card and she can then pop in the card or get a local teen to come over and assist her in setting it up. I have found a slice of pizza (or sometimes an entire pie) or equivalent an excellent motivator to get eager tech help to very remote locations. Food plus a person in need makes for a willing temporary labor force.\nNo iPad is carrier locked - so the worst that can happen is you messed up the digits or have the wrong radio for LTE/3G in certain portions of the globe. With an UK iPad and UK service, the chances of that are very, very low.\nThe only other option that hasn't been raised is just sending a WiFi to cellular router and skipping the iPad setup. Here, that option is far more costly and now you have two devices to manage so there are clear downsides to that option.\n", "Q: Is signing a pdf file electronically with Preview safe? I would like to sign PDF forms using Preview but I am hesitant that the signature can be copied by the receiving party. Has it been ensured that it cannot be copied? Of course, I realise that it could be printed and scanned, however the more troublesome, the safer it is.\n\nA: With photo editors being what they are, it would be trivially easy to cut a signature out of a scanned signed document and put it on any other scanned document in a way that would be nigh-impossible to detect as fraudulent.\nYes, PDF editors would probably be able to snip out your signature. This, of all things, should not concern you.\n", "Q: How can I shut down using keyboard shortcut and not reopen windows on login? I upgraded from OS X 10.6 to OS X 10.8 a few days ago. I find that when I use the keyboard shortcut (⌃ ctrl + ⌥ alt + ⌘ cmd + ⏏ eject) to shutdown, on startup all the previously open applications are reopened automatically. When I shut down from the Apple menu, there is an option \"Reopen windows when logging back\", but there isn't one when I use the keyboard.\nSo how can I shut down my Mac Pro using the keyboard shortcut and not reopen windows on login?\nI don't wish to disable the feature as described here but I will if I have to.\n\nA: If you uncheck the checkbox, it should stay unchecked by default in 10.7.5 and later. After that you can shut down by just pressing ⌃⌥⌘⏏.\nIn 10.8:\n\n\n*\n\n*If \"Reopen windows when logging back in\" is checked, applications that were open before you logged out are reopened after you log back in, and the state of the applications is restored. It doesn't depend on whether \"Close windows when quitting an application\" is checked or not.\n\n*If \"Reopen windows when logging back in\" is not checked and \"Close windows when quitting an application\" is not checked, applications that were open before you logged out are not reopened after you log back in, but the state of the applications is still restored if they are opened manually or as login items. If \"Close windows when quitting an application\" is checked, the state of the applications is not restored when they are opened manually or as login items.\n\n\nIn any case, the state of applications is still restored (or there is an option to restore state) after the Mac was forced to shut down.\nThe list of applications to reopen at login is stored in ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.loginwindow.*.plist.\n\nA: I have the same problem I've restricted permissions to read only for the '~/Library/Saved Application State' folder, it's better but applications still randomly relaunch at the next start. I say randomly because sometimes some do other don't, pretty annoying. Shortcut was working fine with 'restore' option off in 10.7.\nNote that the Apple support doc for OS X Mountain Lion: shortcuts for shutting down and sleeping doesn't mention ⌃⌥⌘⏏ as a way to shutdown your computer but the Apple support doc for OS X keyboard shortcuts still does.\n\nA: Copied from: https://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/98756\nThis can all be controlled by a Preference. Below is for Mountain Lion, which was changed slightly from Lion:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Menu - System Preferences\n\n*General (under Personal section)\n\n*Select \"Close Windows when quitting an Application\" - this makes it so windows don't open when you reopen an app.\n\n*Now when you shut down (and tell it not to reopen windows on restart) they will not open then - or later.\n\nA: If you can shortcut to execute a command from the shell (using Terminal.app), you can use\nshutdown -h now\n\n", "Q: Remote control Pandora iPhone app from Mac I'm trying to replace my Sonos system with old iphones.

Something like \"Screens\" https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/screens-vnc-client-for-ios/id400012962?mt=8\nThat will allow you to control your mac entirely from your iDevice.\n\nA: It's possible to use an iPhone as a VNC server... provided it's jailbroken.

Although the laptop is working with no problem of memory or hard drive, sometimes it makes a strange noise and gets hot pretty quickly.\nCan I analyze/fix this issue myself or do I need to contact Apple Support (and if the later, would this be free)?\n\nA: It sounds like the fall may have damaged the fan. That would account for the heat and the noise. It's also possible the heatsink got slightly dislodged, which would also cause heat issues (although likely more severe).\nIn any event, unless it's clearly an unrelated problem (like a firmware or software bug), this damage is almost certainly not covered by Apple's warranty, as it's the result of an accident, not a part failure. However, from time to time Apple has been known to waive the repair charges on incidents that fall outside warranty coverage, although it seems to be on a case by case basis, and only with a bit of luck.\n", "Q: Launch a bash script from the dock I can't seem to figure this one out, there must be some really easy trick.\nI have a bash script which sets my environment for an app and launches it with the correct parameters.

Can someone explain to me, with 8GB RAM how is it possible to have these statistics?\n\nFree: 869.1MB\nWired: 1.23GB\nActive:2.17GB\nInactive: 3.75GB\nUsed: 7.15GB\nVM Size: 254.82GB\nPage ins: 4.34GB\nPage outs: 0bytes\nSwap used: 0bytes\n\nI have a mid-2012 MacBook Air with a 1.8 GHz i5, 8 GB of RAM, upgraded to Mountain Lion.\nP.S. Why is the VM size 243GB? I don't even have that much space on my drive.\n\nA: Mac OS X allocates and uses RAM differently than is reported by Windows and can be confusing at times. Microsoft originally built Windows to keep as much memory free as possible. Apple's memory model follows a guideline that empty RAM is a wasted resource that could be better utilized to enhance performance. \nHere is a quick and somewhat simplistic breakdown of how your RAM is currently being used:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wired: memory reserved by the operating system\n\n*active: memory used by currently running programs, e.g., Chrome, Skype, Activity Monitor\n\n*Inactive: memory used by programs you previously ran since your last reboot, but have since quit. Most people use a few programs all the time and may switch between them by quitting one program and then launching another. Rather than releasing the memory to be \"free\", the inactive programs are cached and ready to run again. Some or all of this memory will be combined with Free memory as needed by the system or programs.\n\n*Free: memory as of yet unused since the last boot.\n\n*Used: total of wired, active and inactive.\n\n\nThe VM Size is the \"total memory footprint available to the computer\". When you use VM (virtual memory), the processor swaps unused portions of chip memory with hard disk memory, giving the usability of a larger memory footprint when it might not be available.\nYour total Swap used is 0 bytes used, so you're managing to do everything in real or chip RAM without having to use the slower SSD. The zero page outs shows you made a good choice going with the 8GB or RAM.\nThe VM statistics are reset every time you reboot.\nHope this helps demystify your computer.\nadditional info added in response to Ando's comment\nLet me give you a different perspective on your memory use:\nRather than ask \"1.2GB, really?\", ask how many services, caches and other system files the Mac loads on boot rather than individually as needed. As long as the amount used remains constant, you should be fine. If the wired amounts tends to dramatically climb as you use it, then you have something to worry about. \nAdditional wired memory can be used by system preferences, menu bar programs, and other background processes. \nComparing your system to a 2GB Linux machine is similar to comparing your computer to my Mac Pro with 24GB of RAM, multi-terabyte internal arrays, numerous graphic cards, etc. Both were designed and configured for different purposes and footprints.\nYou can get a good idea of the individual app footprints in the Activity Monitor window above the RAM statistics.\nHope this helps!\nthird edit in response...\nI don't have a lot of experience with Chrome, but don't forget that it has a full instance of Flash living within it. Most of my circle works on iOS or OS X so I run FaceTime instead of Skype. \nHere are some procedures to follow:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check and see if you have the latest versions, especially for Chrome. Known memory leaks tend to get corrected over time.\n\n*When diagnosing memory issues, it's best to begin with a fresh boot.\n\n*As you run Skype and Chrome, track their memory uses over time. \n\n*As  you open another tab, how much additional memory does it grab? \n\n*When you close that tab is all the additional memory released? \n\n\nRather than spend a lot of time worrying about minimum memory footprints and such, track system performance with your clock... Does the computer still feel fast and peppy to you?\n\nA: The VM size is a theoretical amount of memory allocated by the system to all the different applications that claim it. However, only the \"used\" portion of this memory actually exists.\nYour inactive memory is VERY high. There is probably an application that has a memory leak and hasn't free'd is memory. Try running the purge command in terminal to clear out most of the inactive memory.\n\nA: Browsers take up huge amounts of memory.  I run Safari, Firefox, and Chrome and each of them end up using 1GB+ within a few hours of heavy use.\nAs long as you are not seeing a lot of page outs, you have sufficient memory. That said, my personal experience is that beach balls increase when free memory gets to zero so I restart my browser if free memory is zero and I start to see beach balls.\n", "Q: What is the default URL for Software Update on OS X 10.5.x?

Thunderbolt and use that for network access of photos v. a stand alone dedicated network attached storage device.  I'm not interested in streaming videos.\nThoughts about the speed of one configuration v. another?\n\nA: The question is a bit vague, but having generally considered this idea myself here are some equally vague thoughts...\nDisk Capacity\nWith a NAS you're (generally) limited to N drives, where N is the number of bays. So a 4-bay NAS will never go beyond 4 physical drives (There may be some NASes that allow external drives, I don't know of any though).\nYour Mac Mini solution (thanks to daisy-chaining Thunderbolt enclosures) will be expandable to as many drives as you like (pretty much).\nIn general, I'd suggest this isn't a huge advantage for the Mac Mini as it may seem at first, because unless you're doing something unique, you'll probably only want a few drives anyway, and will probably end up swapping them out for larger drives later on, rather than continually adding extra drives on. After all, you probably won't want really old drives in there (they'll eventually fail, and be slow, and less power efficient, etc), so replacement after a few years seems likely.\nSome years ago I built a desktop-case based NAS with 4, then 5, then 6, then 7 drives... and a very convoluted setup to let me use all the space on all of them for a RAID device. I'm now back to 3 drives and wouldn't trust the old 320-750 GB drives anymore, even if I had space for a 7-disk NAS. A 2TB disk isn't that expensive, and covers 2-6 times the capacity of my old drives, so just 2x2TB drives is as much space as I had in my 7-disk NAS 4 years ago, and much easier to deal with!\nAlso, if you're planning to use RAID, you'll want to have similar if not identical drives, even if your RAID system supports mixed disks. Fewer things tend to go wrong with simpler setups. So plan for complete replacement of all disks after 2-4 years.\nEase of Configuration / Re-configuration\nThis kind of depends on how you want to set it up, but both Mac OS X and the firmware on NAS devices make it pretty easy to configure and reconfigure disks.\nMost NASes have a web-based admin/setup, while OS X obviously will require you to log in with keyboard/monitor or some kind of remote desktop thingy.\nSome NASes will let you use mixed disks, while most will treat all disks as if they were as big as the smallest in the set. Mac OS X, like most 2- to 4-disk NASes supports RAID0 and RAID1, and also a concatenated. Some NAS devices, especially if they're 5+ disks, will allow RAID5, RAID6, RAID1+0, etc. I've not used the MAC OS X RAID software enough to know how it handles mixed disks.\nQuite a few NAS devices will let you expand a RAID array without losing any data, either by adding an extra disk or by replacing the disks in the array. Almost none support reducing the total size or number of disks in the array. I suspect this is the same for Mac OS X's RAID implementation.\nMany NASes actually won't let you treat each disk individually, which Mac OS X will, so if you want to just have a collection of disks you can plug in, each independently, with different data shared on each, it might actually be advantageous to use the Mac Mini. Though with a headless machine and daisy-chaining of drives this won't be totally straight-forward.\nThe RAID performance of a Mac Mini will not be as high as a hardware RAID chip, though these days its not too different. In any case, for network read/write speeds the limiting factor will be the network and protocol (AFP/Samba/etc) rather than the physical disk speeds. I think its safe to assume you're not after super high performance given you're looking at a Mac Mini vs consumer-grade NAS devices.\nPower\nThe Mac Mini itself is very low power, as are many NAS devices. They're pretty much all based on laptop-style chipsets for low power usage. I think the main difference you'll see is in the external enclosures if you go the Mac Mini route. Each thunderbolt enclosure will likely have its own power supply/converter, and will likely use more power than the equivalent disk in a purpose-built NAS. All I can really say is check the specs of what you're after, because some disk enclosures I've used in the past have awfully inefficient (really hot) power supplies, using much more power than the other more efficient ones. This can add up to quite a bit of extra heat + electrical costs in the long run.\nIf power consumption/cost is a concern, you might want to consider 2.5\" laptop drives, which use less power, and can often be \"bus-powered\" rather than needing their own external power supply (though I don't know how far you'll get with Thunderbolt).\nMost NASes as well as the Mac Mini support putting drives to sleep when they're not in use, so will run at a lower power level when idle.\nNeatness\nMay or may not bother you (or, quite importantly, other people you live with!), but imagine a nice simple box with only power and network cords (ie the NAS), compared to a mac mini + 2 or more external hard drive enclosures, each with their own power supplies + cable connecting them to the Mac Mini, on top of its power + network cords... or just power if you're using wifi). And an extra power board to plug in all those power adaptors. It might not be so bad for 1-2 bus-powered drives, but will get pretty messy if you're using big desktop-sized drives with external power and lots of daisy-chaining... If you live with others, as I do, they may have strong opinions about which option is better ;)\nFuture Proof-ness\nThe only real difference in future-proof-ness that I could think of was the SATA interface for the drives. Pretty much every NAS uses SATA drives, while the Mac Mini is using a Thunderbolt (or USB3) interface, so you will probably be able to replace your enclosures if/when SATA gets replaced by the next big thing. Honestly I wouldn't worry about this too much unless you really need this one specific piece of hardware to last 5+ years.\nThunderbolt may provide improved network speeds in the future, if/when you switch to a  10Gbps LAN, if you get a 10gbps thunderbolt/lan adaptor when such things exist. Again, depends how willing you are to fork out for a whole new NAS, rather than just an adaptor, if/when that actually becomes a problem.\nExtra Features\nThe Mac Mini is a whole computer, so you can run anything on it you could run on a normal computer. That gives it a second life if your needs change later on, or a dual-life if you hook it up to your TV or something, rather than running it headless.\nMost NASes can run some limited set of software, usually multimedia applications for network streaming of photos/video/music. The Mac Mini can do all that of course, and more, but the basics are definitely there for most NAS devices (e.g. DLNA media streaming, or as the network store for other media centres).\nFinal Thoughts\nI think the main differences between a dedicated NAS device and a Mac Mini will be\nThe Mac Mini is\n\n\n*\n\n*More re-usable (because it's a computer in its own right — either now, or after you replace it with the next NAS!)\n\n\nThe NAS is (probably)\n\n\n*\n\n*Cheaper (add up all the costs, including delivery, of all parts you'd need for each configuration)\n\n*Neater/tidier (all drives are internal)\n\n\nBoth will be\n\n\n*\n\n*More than capable of sharing several TB of disk space at gigabit speeds\n\n*Able to run a few extra services if you want (multimedia, streaming, network utilities)\n\n*Able to be set up easily, and reconfigured for drive changes/replacements/extensions\n\n*Easy to check status, health, etc\n\n*Low power usage\n\n*Quiet\n\n\nA: The two items you did not report that will dictate your overall speed is your hub, router or switch and the number of computers that will access the data via your network. All data to and from network storage is bottleneck by the network, and the more computers concurrently accessing the device will place additional demands on the network. Wireless devices will be even slower than wired devices.\nI would compare a standalone NAS vs Mac mini with regard to\n\n\n*\n\n*total cost for what you need right now\n\n*ease of expandability\n\n*cost or expandability\n\n\nTotal cost would be the driving factor in my decision.\n", "Q: Printing from a remote windows computer on a printer connected to a MacBook Air We have a consultant who has a MacBook Air. He connects that to one of our printers via USB. The Mac recognizes the printer and we can print from his documents etc. He then remotes to his office computer which is a Windows PC. He needs to print stuff from his office computer on the printer that is connected to his Mac. The documents will not print. We can't get the remote computer to recognize the printer that is connected to the Mac. (It actually did work for a while, I have no idea how we got it working, but now that it has stopped again, he is getting mad at us for not being able to get it to work.) I have spent hours on his Mac, trying to get the printing working and can't.\n\nA: Go to System Preferences on the mac, click on the sharing icon under Internet and Wireless.

I have an external monitor with a VGA connection. What is the best adapter to use for my Retina MacBook Pro? I think I've seen Thunderbolt to VGA, or USB to VGA? Or HDMI to VGA? What are the differences? \n\nA: You should get a mini DisplayPort to VGA adapter (sometimes referred to as a Thunderbolt to VGA adapter, but it's the same thing). Apple sells one, but they can be had elsewhere for less, including at my personal favourite, Monoprice.\nYou could do HDMI to VGA, but it would require a (typically bulky) active adapter. There are some HDMI to VGA adapters that aren't active, but they rely on graphics card support that Macs don't have. The DisplayPort to VGA adapters are technically active adapters, but for whatever reason they seem to be much more compact than HDMI to VGA ones.\nThere are USB based display adapters, and some of them have VGA output, but I'd only recommend them for situations where other outputs aren't available. They're essentially a USB connected graphics card, which means that performance is lacking, and it takes up CPU and memory resources that the built-in outputs don't. Useful for some situations, but in your case I'd stay away.\n\nA: Clarification: I have a thunderbolt of mini display to VGA cable, which I had been using to connect an LCD with my old Mac Pro Book for over 4 years. Just bought Retina Mac Pro and when I connect to LCD through this cable only the screen background appears on the LCD display screen. All efforts failed so far to get the word or ppt files or another display from the Retina Mac Pro to LCD screen.\nIt appears to be a serious issue and probably calls for the attention of Apple Service people.\n\nA: Having your background only displayed is an entirely different (and much easier) issue to solve.  What's happening is that one of your primary (selected) desktop is being shown on the Macbook's display and one of your other Desktops is shown on the projector.  \nYou've got (at least) two ways to deal with this.  1) Look at the very top of your Macbook display - up in the top, right hand corner.  You'll see the searchlight magnifying glass, to the left of that you'll see your user name, the time, date and day are to the left of that, the battery indicator to the left of that, then the speaker symbol.  Next you'll find the display preferences.  If you're connected to another source (a second monitor, a projector, etc) you should have choices - \"Mirror Retina Display\" will \"project\" the same thing that's showing on your Macbook.  \"Use as separate display\" actually extends your display space so you'll need to grab whatever it is that you want projected and drag it into the extended display space.\nIf you're using the projector as a \"separate display space\" you can also open the display perferances under that same icon which will let you modify the logical position of the displays making the extended space above, below, to the lef, or to the right of your Retina display.  It's less complicated than it sounds.  I hope this helps.\n", "Q: How to make a terminal window always float on top? I see tons of people who have asked this question in the past, and the answer is always the same.. \"Use Afloat\".  But since Afloat hasn't been updated in ages, and has only support for certain applications (and questionable support at that), I'm afraid that it is not an acceptable solution.\nI want to be able to make an arbitrary window - in this case a terminal window - float on top of all other windows.  Please note that this is NOT the same as keeping it on \"all desktops\" (I'm already doing that), as the window will still pop behind other windows on the other desktops.\nHow can I, Using OSX Lion circa December of 2012, keep a specific Terminal window on top of all other windows, of all other applications?\n\nA: TotalTerminal might be a better option. TotalTerminal has a visor mode that allows it to stay on top of all the other windows. You can choose to place it anywhere on the desktop, of course, and choose to have it slide out from one of those positions when you use CTRL-~ key combo or anything else you’ve set up. Plus it’s free.\n\nA: Well since I was striking out otherwise, I decided to try Afloat anyway.  Discovered in their knowledgebase that it WAS updated to work with Lion 10.7.  It still doesn't support all apps, but it does work with Terminal, which is all I was after so I'm happy.  =)\n", "Q: mail.app missing plug-in Today I opened mail.app and my mail attachments showed up as \"missing plug-in\".

I can spend about $150 either taking it to the Apple Store and having them replace it or buying all the stuff from iFixit.com and doing it myself.\nIs there any cheaper/easier way of doing this? Would an independent Apple repair shop be any less expensive? Are there any reliable third-party batteries? I have some crucial RAM and would be comfortable using a Crucial SSD (if I didn't already have a stock one), I'm not particular to an Apple-sourced battery if there's another one that's equally reliable.\n\nA: Having recently done this for a colleague, I can answer in the affirmative that there are excellent 3rd party battery suppliers for this particular model MacBook Pro and they are quite easy to replace.\nI used the Lizone battery mainly for it's high ratings on Amazon and the fact it came with an 18 month warranty (better than Apple's 1 year warranty).\nReplacement was super easy.  There is a guide on ifixit.com but I didn't really need it.  I just removed the back cover, removed the screws holding the battery and used a plastic pry tool to gently pry the battery loose from the adhesive.  Installation was simply the reverse procedure.\nSince I had everything opened, I maxed out the memory with 8GB of RAM and added a Samsung EVO SSD.  While I am partial to Samsung, PNY and Crucial are also very good brands.  Basically, any 2.5\" SSD will work in this MacBook so pick one that you like the best.\nIt's important to note that the SATA interface of this particular MBP is SATA II (3GB /s transfer rate).

One of our users computers on the network has a ~2009 Intel Mac Pro. On Friday the machine was fine, shut down correctly at the end of the day as normal.\nThis morning (Monday) the Mac Pro will not power up. After pressing the power button we get 1-2 seconds where the \"on\" LED is lit, then it goes off. We have removed all components, and blown with canned air, reseated everything, reset the SMC, but still the same issue.\nThe Mac Pro has 2 DIMM \"boards\", one of which is full (4 slots) and the other which has 2 slots free. On the brief power-up, all 4 LED's are lit on both DIMM boards, they're not on long enough to do anything else, is this normal? We've reseated all the RAM and the boards, but no change. We've even removed components such as the graphics card, and sticks of RAM individually but no change.\nI've read that if the system detects no RAM it will beep 3 times, we removed all the RAM but no beep, I think because the system is not powered up long enough.\nAny suggestions? We think it's a PSU but can't be sure.\n\nA: We just managed to figure this out. It was a faulty RAM board/riser. We found the DIAG switch and pressed it with a pencil, all the lights for the PSU checked out properly. So we went back to thinking it must be the RAM again. One riser had 10GB on the other had 2GB, luckily the 2GB one appears faulty. We removed this riser (although we'd already done this!) and the machine booted up fine!\nWe then reseated the sticks in different slots on the faulty riser, reseated the riser and the machine booted, but couldn't find the RAM. So for now we've ditched that riser and are letting the machine run with 10GB instead of 12GB.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: I can't play any type of media or hear anything I can't play any type of media or hear anything (with or without head/ear phones) on my iPod Touch 4th gen running on iOS 6.\nI press play on the selected item but the play button immediately turns into a pause button.\n\nA: You have a problem with the Audio chip on the iPod touch. iOS devices use a separate chip for decoding audio files, so that the processor can be put to sleep. The chip can probably decode all supported formats, but it may be optimised for mp3 and m4a. If the audio chip is dead, nothing will work.

I've got a Mac Pro coming in today. I ordered it with a typical 1TB HDD in the default configuration from Apple. I purchased a Crucial 512GB SSD that I want to make my primary drive for the OS and the user data (and just use the the 1TB HDD as an additional storage disk).\nSo, what do I need to do to get up and running with Mountain Lion on the SSD?\n\nA: For a general user adding a new drive to a running system with data, you would boot into the Recovery HD (which is just a lightly hidden bootable OS on an additional partition) during boot  by holding command+R when you hear the startup chime.\nYou can then use Disk Utility to partition the new drive. At that point, you could clone the system from the HDD to SSD or run the OS installer and have a clean OS on the SSD so you can choose what user accouts, user data and apps you migrate over.\nIn your case, there is nothing you really need on the main HDD. I would delay erasing the HDD until you get the OS running on the SSD and see that the three iLife apps are still available for redemption.\n\nOnce you redeem those Apps - they will be tied to your Apple ID whereas the OS reinstalls are tied to the CPU serial number.\n", "Q: Messed up color profiles in Mountain Lion For some unknown reason, my color profiles are messed up in way that whenever an application (e.g. pixelmator, Preview, Xcode, etc.) tries loading Adobe RGB 1998 color profile (probably any other color profile too for that matter), that application will crash miserably.\nI sent a report to apple, but so far have received nothing.

The iPad has more than 400 pictures in Photo Stream. I want to set the standard collection my MacBook Pro and have that reflect across all devices. Any suggestions on how to make that happen?\nRunning 10.8.2 on MacBook Pro and 6.0.1 on iOS devices.\n\nA: As the Apple website reports, iCloud stores your pictures in Photo Stream for 30 days.\n\niCloud manages your Photo Stream efficiently so you don’t run out of\n  storage space on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. If you have Photo\n  Stream enabled on your iOS device, every single photo you take appears\n  in a special Photo Stream album that holds your last 1000 photos. You\n  can delete any photos you don’t want from the Photo Stream (Photo Stream photos downloaded to an iOS device with iOS 5.0.1 or earlier must be deleted manually after updating to iOS 5.1 or later.). To touch\n  up a photo or keep a favorite shot permanently, simply save it to your\n  Camera Roll. iCloud stores new photos for 30 days, so you have plenty\n  of time to connect your iOS device to Wi-Fi and make sure you always\n  have your most recent shots handy.\n\nAfter 30 days pictures are removed from iCloud but not from the Photo Stream album on your devices.\nIf you remove a picture stored in the Photo Stream album from one of your devices\n\n\n*\n\n*Before 30 days, the picture will be removed from all your devices\n\n*After 30 days, the picture will be removed only from  that device, because the picture is not anymore on iCloud.\n\n\nYou should also consider that pictures are removed from your Photo Stream albums on your devices when they reach the 1000th picture.\n\niCloud pushes all your photos to the My Photo Stream album on your\n  devices and computers, and manages them efficiently, so you don’t run\n  out of storage space.\nYour iOS devices keep a rolling collection of your last 1000 photos in\n  the My Photo Stream album. From there, you can browse your recent\n  photos or move the ones you like to your Camera Roll or another album\n  to keep them on your device forever.\nSince your Mac and PC have more storage than your iOS devices, you can\n  choose to have all of your My Photo Stream photos automatically\n  downloaded. In iPhoto or Aperture preferences on your Mac, be sure to\n  select Photo Stream > My Photo Stream > Automatic Import. All of your\n  photo stream photos will be imported into your Events, Projects,\n  Photos, Faces, and Places folders in iPhoto or Aperture. On your PC\n  with Photo Stream enabled in the Control Panel, all of your photos\n  will be imported into C:\\Users\\\\Pictures\\Photo Stream\\My\n  Photo Stream.\n\nN.B.1 You can always reset you Photo Straem from www.icloud.com.\nN.B.2 You should satisfy the following requirements\n\nDeleting individual photos from Photo Stream is supported by iOS\n  5.1 or later, iPhoto 9.2.2 or later, Aperture 3.2.3 or later, and Apple TV Software Update 5.0 or later. You will need to manually\n  delete photos you downloaded to iOS devices using iOS 5.0.1 or earlier\n  after updating to iOS 5.1.\n\n\nA: There can be a slight lag for things to get cleaned up - but if a device hasn't updated it's cache after 24 hours, you can always turn off iCloud for that device and clean things manually.\nYou will want to look at the photo roll on that device as it also needs cleaning before you re-enable the Photo Stream on it or else you risk it injecting all the photos back into the stream. Also - I don't know if it helps, but I like to wait overnight (or as long as practical) before re-enabling that device to let the could servers see it as a new registration and not just someone accidentally turning off Photo Stream and back on.\n", "Q: How to sync iPhone photo albums to iPhoto I'm using iPhone4 and the latest iOS. I've created albums and categorized my photos into the albums.\nQuestion is, how can I then sync the photos WITH the albums into iPhoto?\n\nA: That is a good question! The answer, as far as I can tell, is: You can't!\nThe whole system of syncing the Photos app and iPhoto among your devices, and between each other, seems to be a work in progress.

I have a time machine backup of my early 2011 macbook pro OSX system with mountain lion, I want to remove it's hard disk and replace it with SSD, I have a spare memory key, is there a way to restore data from hard disk to SSD without downloading full mountain lion image, I tried downloading it but Apple servers are too slow, I am getting a speed of 50kbps for a 4.37 gb download, my internet is fine and I have a 10Mbps connection. \n\nA: *\n\n*Buy an enclosure kit from OWC or another vendor.\n\n*Buy and put your SSD in the enclosure.\n\n*Connect SSD/enclosure to your computer.\n\n*Format the SSD with Apple's Disk Utility.\n\n*Use SuperDuper! to copy your entire internal HD onto the SSD.\n\n*Set startup to the SSD and boot from it to make sure it boots.\n\n*Remove SSD from enclosure and install in MacBook Pro.\n\n*Put MacBook Pro's internal hard disk in now empty enclosure and use it as a backup.\nYou also can use Disk Utility to image the drive if you don't want to use a third party product like SuperDuper! or CarbonCopyCloner. Some people also prefer a simple USB to SATA connector and you can usually get them for less than $5 from Amazon if you don't need or want a drive enclosure for your old drive.\nHowever, the use of your old hard disk in an enclosure and a backup tool like SuperDuper! or CCC gives you both an external drive and the beginning of a solid backup solution as well.\n\nA: Using a USB Enclosure\nIf you have a USB enclosure that you can put either the SSD or internal drive in, you can clone your internal to your SSD directly. It's a bit more efficient than pulling from the Time Machine backup. For full instructions, read this, but the short version is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Disk Utility\n\n*Select your internal drive and click the restore tab.\n\n*Set your internal as the source, and the SSD as the destination, then click the restore button.\n\n\nUsing USB Key & Time Machine\nIf you don't have access to a USB enclosure (although I recommend getting one — they can be had for $30 or less and are very handy to have around), then you can restore from the Time Machine by creating a Recovery Disk on your USB key.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the OS X Recovery Disk Assistant, and follow the instructions to create a recovery partition on your USB key.\n\n*Restart your Mac with the recovery key and Time Machine drive attached, with the SSD installed.\n\n*Hold down option while restarting your Mac, and select the recovery partition as your boot drive.\n\n*Choose the restore from Time Machine option, and follow the directions. Select your Time Machine drive as the source, and your SSD as the destination.\n\n", "Q: Using memory with a higher MHz rating? Can MacBook Pro's successfully support and fully exploit RAM of a higher MHz rating than that which they ship with?\n\nFor example, take my 15\" MacBook Pro (Late 2011) that ships with 4GB of 1333MHz DDR3 memory. I'm considering buying 16GB of the same clock speed even though Apple says that it can \"support up to 8GB\" — but we know that Apple is wrong.\nWhat about installing 1600MHz in the 16GB variant — will it work? Or will it be clocked down to 1333MHz? When compared to 16GB 1333MHz, will the higher clock speed improve battery life, performance, timings, or what? \n\nA: The processor is hardwired to talk to the memory so it will throttle memory down to the speed it can talk at.\nInstalling 1600MHz RAM will just run at 1333MHz in that model MacBook Pro. There is no impact on battery life, performance, reliability etc.\nI know there was an issue on some models where it would not boot with 2 modules of higher speed but I believe it is fine with the new models. There are utilities you can get to change the memory speed (on some modules) to get around this issue. I am not sure if this is the case with newer models.\nThe last time, I looked the price difference between these speeds of RAM was so small, I would just get the 1333 models for safety.\n(MHz = clock speed)\n\nA: The short answer is that it will depend on the model of your machine, and the RAM manufacturer you buy from — but I can't tell you any specifics on either. \nInstalling higher MHz RAM is a risk, and here's why:\n\nMy 1600 MHz memory didn't pass tests\nI installed 1600 MHz RAM on my laptop and found that it failed the Apple Hardware Test, Memtest OS X, and the Tech Tool Pro memory tests.\nThese could have simply been faulty RAM modules, or just not 100% compatible with my machine.\nSo follow the advice below at your own risk.\n\n\"But it's compatible with my Intel processor\"\nHere's what I've found:\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel's spec for my i7 processor (2760QM on a Late 2011 MacBook Pro) says that 1600 MHz DDR3 RAM is compatible. \n\n\nBut does that translate for Macs? Yes according to OWC. \nHowever, Macs are notoriously picky about RAM, and while 1600 MHz memory might be compatible with Intel, it doesn't meant it'll be compatible with the Apple logic board.\nSo find out if Intel supports it, but that is no guarantee. \n\nCosts of 1600 vs. 1333 MHz\nIf the decision between two MHz-ratings of RAM comes down to price, take a look at the real-world performance increase and judge whether it's worth it. \nIt's likely that it may not be worth it to get the \"faster\" memory.\nAlso take into account the risks if it doesn't work: you'll have to return it (if even possible).\n\nIs this a false positive?\nSome people allege in various places that 1600 MHz will work because it shows up in \"About this Mac\" when installed:\n\nAnd then \"More Info\" brings this up:\n\nFirst, there is the question of whether it will pass memory tests (see the first section).\nAlso, I am unsure on how one can test if it is not being clocked down to 1333 MHz and the full 1600MHz are being used. \nI am not sure whether showing up there means it works.\n", "Q: Smart mailbox for senders who are not members of a group I want to set up a smart mailbox in Mail that contains messages from any sender who is not a member of a particular group in my address book.\nThere's an option in the smart mailbox rules for \"sender is member of group,\" but I don't see a way to negate it.

You would think it would make some kind of difference...\n\nA: Not really. Access times might be faster by a handful of picoseconds, since the electrical impulses would travel a slightly shorter distance by taking away the circuitry in the socket. However that distance is dwarfed by the variance in placement of the RAM on the logic board — sometimes it's closer to the CPU, sometimes farther away.\nThe predominant factors for speed of RAM are the clock speed and bit width, not the physical layout.\n\nA: Faster, probably not.  Otherwise the difference is twofold, IMO.  \n\n\n*\n\n*With no physical RAM slots, they can more closely integrate the\ncomponents to save on space and make a thinner machine.  \n\n*From a commercial perspective, you have to pay up-front for more RAM, as\nyou cannot add more later on (you have to buy a new computer).\n\n", "Q: How can I tell which band (2.4GHz or 5GHz) my iPhone's WiFi connection is on? I have two access points for the same network in my house, with some overlap. One runs on 2.4GHz only, and one transmits both 2.4GHz and 5GHz.\nI have an iPhone 5 (running iOS 6.0.1), which supports the 5GHz band and I'm wondering if there is a way for me to determine which frequency band it is connected to.\n\nA: Get an app on the App Store which will tell you the MAC address of the AP you're connected to. There are many, and they are free.\nThen, enable the WiFi scanner in the AirPort Utility app: go to Settings > AirPort Utility to enable it. The scanner will tell you the MAC addresses of the detected APs and the frequencies used.\nSince APs use different MACs for different frequencies, you can use the data provided to understand which frequency your device is using. It's complicated, but it is the only way to know, unless Apple opens its private APIs.\n\nA: If your network is based on any Apple AirPort-thingy, you can set up a separate SSID for the 5GhZ-network and connect to that one manually on your iPhone 5, and from there be able to see which network you're on. To do this, follow the below step:\n\nAirport Utility 6.0: Airport Extreme > Edit > Wireless > Wireless Options > Tick the box next to \"5GHz network name\".\n  Airport Utility 5.6 and earlier: Manual Setup > Wireless > Wireless Network Options > Tick the box.\n  Source\n\nP.S. Having a different SSID does not make it a separate network, it just makes the two bands differentiable.\n\nA: You can not tell from the iPhone directly (as of iOS version 7 native). You should be able to tell via the wireless router your connected to in it's logging functions, WiFi client list or some similar mechanism within the router. I can't provide you an exact process as every router is different. This answer assumes you do not want to JailBreak your iPhone. If you are not adverse to doing so there may be an app in the Cydia app store that will show more meaningful information with regard to WiFi frequency information.\nYou can however detect what cell tower frequency your phone uses by using Field Test mode. This will special mode allows users to find out a range of information about the phone’s connection to the network. In particular, the information displayed in the Field Test mode allows users to discover exactly which tower their phone is connecting to and which frequency band (WiFi) the signals are being sent on.\nTo access this mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Access the iPhone's Field Test mode by typing *3001#12345#* in the\nphone’s keypad and press dial. This will bring up the Field Test\nmenu.\n\n*Select the “Cell Information” menu option to display a summary of all\nnearby towers. The “RX” code displays the signal strength of each\ntower. These RX values are dBm signal strength readings, where lower\nvalues means strong signal (so -60 signifies stronger signal than\n-80). The towers are listed by signal strength, and the top tower is usually the tower your phone is connecting to.\n\n*Selecting the first tower will take you to a further menu that\ndisplays more specific information. The “Freq” value shows the\nfrequency block that the network is using. If the Freq number is\nbetween 128 and 251, the tower is using the 850 MHz Cellular band. If\nthe Freq number is between 512 and 810, the tower is using the\n1900MHz PCS band.\n\n\nA: Net Analyser (Lite = Free) will tell you the BSSID and the vendor of that BSSID. \nAll you need to know is the BSSID of your access points or if they are from different vendors its fairly easy to tell them apart and know which one you're connected to.\nBut this still wont tell you which band you're on.

Now I want to make all mail accounts again follow the default sound set under Settings → Sounds → New Mail. How can I do this? When I change the \"New Mail\" alert sound, the individual mail accounts no longer change.\nI have tried manually setting all the mail accounts to use the same sound and vibration setting as the default. However, they still don't change when I change the default setting.\n\nA: It's not a direct answer, but by deleting an App, you remove the local cached copy of the emails and don't lose any messages on the Mail server.\nThis has a side effect of clearing the preference for sounds, so when you add the account back - it now follows the default sounds as set in the UI.\n", "Q: mac fails to reconnect to SMB share after coming back from suspend I've got a mac (OS X 10.8.2) that's accessing files on an Win7 SMB share.

But when I try to connect to the SMB server it asks for the username/password. When I type it in, I get told it's wrong. Then I restart the machine (Mac) and it can connect to the SMB server fine. \nIt's an annoyance really, especially when I've got 8 different terminal windows open and they're all named the way I like etc. \nAnyone got a suggestion/tips for re-connecting to an SMB drive after suspend? \n\nA: Mounting an SMB share as a local folder seems more reliable than using the Finder sidebar or even COMM-K to connect. It shouldn't be, right, but it is for me. Half the time, the Finder sidebar option won't connect even though I can still access the networked folder. Here's an example of using mount_smbfs:\nmount_smbfs //Guest@10.0.1.1/myshare /Users/user/Downloads/networkfolder\nAlso, I had to disable sleep completely because the video crashes reliably on wake. 2018 mini with BigSûr.

Currently I only see about 12 songs in upnext, not so great when I want to create a 3 hour playlist, but I can't find a setting anywhere to increase this.\nDoes such a thing exist?\n\nA: You can make a normal or intelligent playlist and play it. Do not use shuffle and you can add songs during playback.\nEdit: If you just want to show more songs in upnext - it is not possible. But 12 Songs i s a plenty of view in the future.... \n", "Q: Flickering in Safari after switching back to integrated graphics I have a MacBook Pro which switches dynamically between discrete and integrated graphics.  I get a notification about the switching using gfxCardStatus.\nIf Safari is running while the system switches first from integrated to discrete, then back from discrete to integrated, some web page elements will sometimes flicker in Safari.   When typing in text boxes, sometimes the cursor will appear to jump around for a split second and some of the text will also disappear for a short while, then re-appear.  It is not bad enough to make it impossible to use Safari, but it is definitely annoying. Functionally, there's no difference when using text boxes, it's just an annoying and confusing visual glitch.\nAfter restarting Safari, the problem is gone until the graphics are switched again.\nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Has anyone else seen this behaviour?\n\n*Is there a way to avoid/fix this problem?\n\n*Is there any chance this problem was caused by installing CUDA?  Can installing the CUDA package mess up graphics drivers on a Mac?  I'm new to Macs and one of the first things I installed on this machine was CUDA, so I can't really tell if the problem was present before that (but since that's graphics card related too, I though it'd be good to mention it).\nThere is a program I use regularly a new version (released a couple of days ago) triggers a switch to the NVIDIA card, so I see this problem constantly.\n\nA: 1.) This is a known Apple issue. It's insane that it existed in the first place, and it's worse that it still exists, and effects every dual-GPU Mac I have seen (in the office, at home, friends' laptops, etc). So yes, LOTS of people have this problem.\n2.) Use gfxCardStatus to keep it locked in discrete mode, keep restarting Safari, or switch to Chrome. The Webkit nightly build isn't fixed, so I'm not sure when a 'real' solution will come about.\n3.) That's very unlikely. As I said in (1), this problem effects all sorts of Macs, most of which do not have CUDA installed at all. It also looks like a problem with the Intel GPUs, not the nVidia ones.\nSorry for the bad news!\n\nA: I have noticed the behaviour using two solitaire packages.  Chunks of the graphics disappear running with the integrated GPU, and the problem clears up when I use gfxCardStatus to switch the the Radeon discrete GPU. It seems to depend on what other apps are running at the time, but it's not consistent.\n\nA: I had the same problem, it was worse. My computer would freeze and I had to reboot it.\nUse Firefox, problem solved!\n", "Q: Can I get paid for releases of new versions of my app in the App Store? Suppose that I develop an app for the iOS platform. The app is a huge success and 80% of my target audience buys it. My customers understandably expect continuous development of the app, but my situation is difficult, because with the market saturated, I can hardly acquire new customers.\nIs there a possibility to offer my existing customers a paid update of my app (e.g. buying Office 2010 does not entitle the customer to Office 2013, only to service packs, security updates, ect.) or do I need to release the update as a separate update (and is this allowed in Apple's ToS)?\n\nA: The App Store doesn't offer support for paid app updates. You can release new features as in-app purchases for the current app (as @Jason said).\nIf, however, you want to charge for a new version of the app itself, then you need to release the new version as its own app and remove the previous version from sale. A common convention is to name the new app \"MyApp 2\" (with the \"2\" as part of the name) to distinguish it, since its actual version number will be 1 since it's a new app. Yes, it's a little confusing...\nOne issue to be aware of with this approach is that, because MyApp 1 and MyApp 2 are separate apps, users of MyApp 1 won't get any kind of notification that MyApp 2 is available, since it's not an \"update\" of that app but rather a separate thing entirely.\n\nA: Yes - with the changes to app bundles to include \"complete my bundle\" pricing, it appears possible to offer upgrade pricing for iOS apps.\nI think that Smile Software used this to coordinate pricing changes to the old app (increasing it) and including the old and new apps in the same bundle effectively allowed someone upgrading to pay an upgrade price that was less than the full price for the new app.\nOf course, you can also cut prices to everyone and call it an \"upgrade\" and hope that all your existing customers take advantage of the \"upgrade pricing\" but nothing prevents someone else from buying the new app at the upgrade price for the duration of that sale.\nBundles should be a viable way for major upgrades to work in the future as long as the developer doesn't mind having two versions of the app named for sale on the app store.\nThis isn't possible on the Mac App store in 2015 - just the iOS app store.\n", "Q: iTunes Eject Button Do i need to press eject button on iTunes before unplug my USB cable?\nSince after that i still want ipad able to sync via WIFI.\nOr please inform what is the purpose that eject button?  \nIt is for safely unplug USB cable from MAC or make the device is will be not anymore synchronise with iTunes?\n\n\nA: The eject button unmounts the iPad (in other words, disconnects it). Yes, you should eject it first before you unplug the USB cable to ensure that it isn't in the middle of performing an operation.\nIf you enable automatic (instead of manual) syncing, I believe there is no need to eject.\nYou can certainly sync over WiFi without the iPad being plugged in via USB; that is the point of WiFi syncing, after all ;) (You do need the iPad plugged into power, though, I think).\n", "Q: Does T-Mobile's network in the US allow an iPhone 3GS work as well as the iPhone 5?

If you click the word \"iPod\" you get to the sync options display. If you click on the graphic, you unmount the pod.

Can anyone explain the \"wake for wifi network access\" setting in energy preferences for me?  I do not understand it.\n\nA: Wake for wifi network access (aka Wake on Demand but with Wifi) allows your computer to be brought out of sleep mode when someone else on the network requests access to a service on your computer eg. File sharing. \nFrom this Apple KB article\n\nWake on Demand helps you save energy and reduce costs while still\n  ensuring full access to all your shared files and devices, even\n  remotely across the Internet. Wake on Demand works by partnering with\n  a service running on your AirPort Base Station or Time Capsule called\n  Bonjour Sleep Proxy. When Wake on Demand is enabled, any Mac on your\n  network running OS X will automatically register itself and its shared\n  items with the Bonjour Sleep Proxy. When a request is made to access a\n  shared item on a Mac running OS X, the Bonjour Sleep Proxy asks that\n  Mac to wake and handle the request. Once that request is complete, the\n  Mac will go back to sleep at its regularly-scheduled interval as set\n  in the Computer Sleep section of the Energy Saver preferences pane.\n\n\nA: Unless you have a Apple-branded router or Time Capsule or a specially configured PC or Mac to act as the Bonjour Sleep Proxy Server, you should disable this, and save the energy. Even if you do have an Apple Router or Time Capsule, unless you are sharing music etc. you should turn it off and save the energy.\nAs for leaving this on for the \"Find My Mac\" feature to work better, think about it... if the thief of your macbook has an AirPort router, you'll still need to wait for the thief to turn the Mac on and enter the wifi key for his network for the Mac to be registered with mDNS for it to report itself. Since they will need to turn the Mac on to enter the Wi-Fi password, the Mac is already going to be turned on.  Before it has the Wi-Fi key, no amount of Bonjour sleep proxy will wake your Mac.\nHere is a quote from MacRumors.com:\n\"...the Bonjour Sleep Proxy feature needed for the advanced functionalities of broadcasting information about the sleeping machine requires the use of an Apple AirPort or Time Capsule base station running firmware 7.4.2 or later.\"\nThis is all unfortunate, because this technology could save millions of tons of carbon a year, but the open source code Apple wrote for the server side is for BSD unix, and is difficult to port to Linux, so DD-WRT etc. have not implemented it.\n\nA: Yes, it can help save energy (if you need that service),\nBut if you don't need - It will increase electricity consumption.\n", "Q: Can the function of the iTunes shuffle control be changed in iTunes 11? I just updated my iTunes to 11.0. I just want to know how I can make the songs in my playlists in shuffle mode, but not the songs in my Library. Before with iTunes 10, you can have that option where you only shuffle songs in your playlists but not the library. But with iTunes 11, I can't seem to find that option. When I have songs in my playlists in shuffle mode, it also shuffles the songs I play from my Library.\nSo, can shuffle only affect a playlist and remain unset for general library play?\n\nA: There is a  shuffle button right beside the playlist name (at the top), when you have a playlist selected\nIn the above, my sidebar is off, (so I get this bar)\nSongs   Albums   Artists   Genres   Playlists   Radio   Match        iTunes Store\nbut this also works if a playlist is selected and the sidebar is on.\n\nA: Just go to Controls > Shuffle > Turn On Shuffle and play a song.\n\n\nA: Turn on the menu bar with Ctrl+B, then navigate to Controls > Shuffle > Turn On Shuffle.\n\nA: There doesn't seem to be a way to turn shuffle on/off for independent playlists - it's either on for everything or off for everything - which is a hassle. In 10 it was easy to toggle back and forth between a shuffling playlist and a fixed playlist - something important if you need to use more than one playlist at the same time.. \n", "Q: Using Time Machine with Virtualization (Parallels, VirtualBox, VMWare, etc...) Since a single small change to a VM file should (I think) cause the entire multi-gigabyte file to be backed up again, are there any ideas I can use to more effectively backup my machine?\nAssume that I only need one copy of a VM, and changes made to the VM don't matter.\nFor example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup the VM using time machine once, then exclude the folder that contains all the VMs\n\n*Exclude the VM's altogether and manually back up the VMs\n\n*Let Apple's software do it's thing, it will be effective at managing the disk space\n\nA: Parallels has a specific setting to optimize its VMs for backup by Time Machine and prevent backing up unchanged data.\n\nTo enable improved integration with Time Machine, please go to Virtual Machine Configuration, choose Options and hit Backup.\nSelect \"Optimize for Time Machine\" in SmartGuard menu.\n\nSimilarly, VMWare Fusion has some support for Time Machine, which appears to involve turning on snapshots.\n\nA: \"... I store all of my virtual machines on a sparsebundle disk image. This is a mounted filesystem that seamlessly breaks up the filesystem into many 8MB files. That level of granularity keeps my TM backups small. For example, I have three individual VMs stored on a single sparsebundle volume. They currently occupy 3012 individual 8MB \"bundle\" files. The last time I used those VMs, I ran software updates on all of them. A total of 118 of those 8MB files changed as a result of the updates, so the TM backup was 944MB. If they were not on a sparsebundle volume, the TM backup would have been about 24GB.\nI use Parallels, but the same concept should apply to any application that creates and frequently updates very large files. Use Disk Utility to create the sparsebundle volume.\"\nSource: Apple Support Communities by Pondini\n\nA: Enable snapshots. In VMWare when a snapshot is created, the (VMDK) hard drive contents are frozen, while changes are stored as a separate delta. \nBefore: \n20GB VMDK + 1GB of changes = 20GB of changed files to backup\nAfter\n20GB VMDK (Snapshotted) + 1GB of changes = 1GB of changes to backup.\nAdditionally, you can keep snapshotting, so if you have an initial 20gb Snapshot1 + 2gb of deltas, each incremental backup would be 2gb.\nOnce you take a second snapshot, you end up with 22gb frozen. 20GB for S1, 2GB for S2, and then you just need to backup the next deltas.\nThe only downsides are: \n\n\n*\n\n*It takes more physical space. 20GB frozen image + 2gb of deltas take a total of 22gb of storage.\n\n*It's not possible to shrink snapshotted VMs, so make sure to pre-shrink before taking the snapshot.\n\n\nA: Since you say \"changes made to the VM don't matter\" then you can do what I do which is \n\n\n*\n\n*Put all the VMs in one folder\n\n*Exclude the folder with the VMs from Time Machine\n\n*Manually back up the VM folder.  I keep a copy offsite on a portable RAID 1 drive.\n\n\nLetting Time Machine \"do its thing\" is a bad idea, as it will make a new copy every it does a backup, which is generally around once an hour.  You will eat up all your storage space very quickly and it will be pointless anyway.\nYou could \"backup the VM using time machine once, then exclude the folder that contains all the VMs\" but the Time Machine interface is not the best for retrieving your saved copy in that situation, plus Time Machine will delete old files if it needs to in order to save space and you don't know when it will delete your one and only backup copy of your VM.  \nBy doing a manual backup of your VMs you can also refresh them once in a while (say when new guest OS updates are applied) much more easily than with a Time Machine solution.\nSnapshots affect performance quite a bit unless the snapshot and the virtual disk is on a high-performance solid-state drive.  It is worth considering if you need regular backups of ongoing work on the VM, but since you say you don't care about changes to the VM then snapshots are best avoided altogether. \n\nA: I know the thread is kind of old, but I just wanted to share with you guys my experience. I hope this helps.\nBasically I needed to truly understand how the snapshots worked, and if I could rely on them in case I ever needed to restore a VM from a snapshot using TimeMachine (and the snapshots). In other words, I had several unanswered questions and Parallels documentation is just not good enough.\nSo, here it goes...\nFirst, disclaimer: I do not work for Parallels and I am in no way, shape, or form the final authority on the software. I did do extensive testing though, and the results of all my testing, which involved going through several iterations of waiting for snapshots to be automatically created, and test recovering the VM several times using TimeMachine, at different stages (with no snapshot yet taken, with 1 snapshot taken, with two, and more snapshots taken, with both the VM powered on and off), and, yes, my TimeMachine drive is encrypted.\nI'll first give you the bottom line of all my testing, and then I will expand.\nBottom line: Yes. It all works. Perfectly. Seamlessly.\nIn an Apple philosophy kind of way, they say, this is all you need to know... As in, Apple (and in this case Parallels) says you do not need to know, so you do not need to know. Of course, we The Users disagree. We DO need to know.\nSo, here's my expanded answer:\n\n*\n\n*I do have my backup drive encrypted! It's just the right thing to do.\n\n\n*Now, on to how SmartGuard Snapshots actually do work really well with TimeMachine... I thoroughly tested each and every single scenario I mention here:\na) If there aren't yet any SmartGuard snapshots of the VM: TimeMachine backs up the entire .pvm file, however large it is, regardless of whether the VM is powered on or not. Again, if you have the backup drive encrypted, you are safe, even with the VM powered on.\nb) If there is already 1 SmartGuard snapshot, and TimeMachine has at least one full backup of the entire .pvm file, then it keeps the full .pvm backup, does not back it up again, and backs up the snapshot.\nc) If there is already 1 SmartGuard snapshot, but TimeMachine never had a chance to back up the entire .pvm, then it backs up the full .pvm, AND then it backs up the snapshot.\nd) And the pattern repeats itself... If there are 2 or more SmartGuard snapshots, TimeMachine will back up the full .pvm file only if it wasn't backed up before, and it will do the same for any SmartGuard snapshots that it hasn't yet backed up. That is, if the snapshot has already been backed up before, it is already backed up, and it is not backed up again. But any new snapshots that weren't yet backed up WILL be backed up. However many (non-backed up) snapshots there are.\nIf you follow my reasoning 1 thru 2, a thru d, you see that everything gets backed up, quite efficiently, without data duplication.\nNow you may ask (I did!): \"Ok. How does the restore work?\" That was my main question because I wanted to make sure I could rely on SmartGuard and TimeMachine configured this way. It is quite simple, actually. When/If you want to restore, you simply enter TimeMachine, browse to the folder that contains the .pvm file, and click \"Restore\". TimeMachine/Parallels SmartGuard will automatically calculate which SmartGuard Snapshot was the closest one taken prior to the TimeMachine backup and restore the main first full .pvm backup, and then apply the latest SmartGuard Snapshot, which will bring your machine to the closest state it was in, when the last snapshot was taken, before the last backup was taken, for the date that you choose.\nPractical example:\n\n*\n\n*TimeMachine runs and backs up your entire .pvm, say, 01/01/2030.\n\n*SmartGuard takes a snapshot 01/02/2030.\n\n*TimeMachine runs and backs up the 01/02/2030 snapshot on 01/03/2030.\n\n*SmartGuard takes a snapshot 01/04/2030.\n\n*TimeMachine runs and backs up the 01/04/2030 snapshot on 01/05/2030.\n\n*SmartGuard takes a snapshot 01/06/2030.\n\n*At this point, on 01/07/2030, you experience a catastrophic failure of your drive and you lose the .pvm completely.\n\n*After resolving the problem with the drive, you enter TimeMachine, and browse to the folder where the .pvm file resides. Go back in time to 01/06/2030, and you click restore. TimeMachine knows it has a good full backup of the .pvm from the first original backup, and it also knows that the latest available backed-up SmartGuard Snapshot for the date you chose (01/06/2030) is from 01/04/2030. It restores the .pvm file exactly as it was as of 01/04/2030, which is the latest good backup/SmartGuard Snapshot combination per the restore date chosen.\n\nI know I typed a book here. (And I am not the best writer :-)) But I hope I explained everything.\nP.S. As someone mentioned, yes, there is a cost to running a VM with snapshots. But, if your machine is powerful enough, it should be no problem. I have done so for years, with no issues. (Running an iMac Pro here, and all other related specs also leave plenty of room for everything to breathe!)\n", "Q: Quicksilver and Spotlight I have found that I need to run both Quicksilver and Spotlight. I consider this to be a waste of CPU and memory and would like to eliminate one of them probably Spotlight. The reason I would like to retain Quicksilver is because it is a tiny bit faster and much more flexible.\nThe main thing that I current use Spotlight for is searching within Mail. I use that all the time. For all the rest of opening applications and files, I use Quicksilver.\nIs there a way to eliminate Spotlight without losing the searching within Mail? Or alternatively, to reduce the overhead of Spotlight but still keeping it available for searches within Mail? \nAn additional Quicksilver annoyance is that on Mountain Lion, Quicksilver crashes fairly frequently.\n\nA: Alfred uses the Spotlight index by default, and LaunchBar also has an option to use it. The Spotlight index includes almost all files, so you don't have to adjust what files to index manually.\nBy default, Alfred is conservative in what types of files it searches for, to avoid muddying your search results. You can tick the boxes for what parts you want to be included in the results by default. If you want to search among all files on the system, you just need to press the spacebar before you begin typing the search term, and it will then search the full Spotlight index rather than just a subsection of it. You also have the open/find keywords, which likewise search the full Spotlight index.\nIf you always want it to search the full index, then you can enable that option in the preferences. Despite the warning, Alfred is pretty usable (and very fast) even if you enable searching for all files.\n\n(It still excludes the system files that are hidden from normal Spotlight results. But you can search for those by creating a search filter.)\n", "Q: Does iOS report usage in megabytes or mebibytes?

I found that iOS uses the base-10 definition when showing usage. \nThat is, if you send a large file, say 10 mebibytes (10 × 220, or 10485760 bytes), it will report it in megabytes, counting a megabyte as 1,000,000 bytes (not 1,048,576 bytes).\nSo that 10 MB, shows up as 10.4 MB:\n\n(I'm not suggesting that there's anything nefarious going on here related to billing or data limits.) \n", "Q: How do I prevent OS X from automatically installing app files on my drive I have just reinstalled my Air with Lion.

And most importantly, how do I stop this crazy behavior?\nThanks :)\n\nA: The Apps that the Finder shows in the context menu \"Open with...\" are not determined by Spotlight.\nIndependently of Spotlight the System scans for all .app files on your disk and builds a database of Apps and the file types they can open.\nAs long as you have an App on your disk, the Finder will offer to open files with it.\nAFAIK, you can only prevent this behavior by either moving your apps to another disk, deleting them entirely or (what I often do) zipping them.\n(By the way, OS X is not installing the Apps. Usually an App is 'installed' when it just is on your disk. Installing like on Windows is hardly ever necessary for an App to run on OS X)\n\nA: Okay, so so far I have no idea how to prevent .app bundles from being automatically \"registered\", but I now know how to repair the system.\nIt seems that it's lsregister which is responsible for scanning the system for .app bundles with launch services defined, and then automatically registering them in the launch services database. Seems insane, but apparently this is intended. Possibly to help with restoring from Time Machine backups.\nAFAICT, no other configuration is being done, and no configuration files or other app-specific files are being copied from the bundles, so the damage is pretty mild and easily fixable. Also, it would appear that simply deleting the .app folders, zipping them up, or moving them way outside the reach of lsregister (like on a network drive or an external disk, perhaps, though I've read one guy complaining that even different partitions will be scanned) will eventually clear up those launch services. Though it should happen on logout/login, I wasn't able to get rid of them by doing this.\nZipping up my .app bundle and then issuing (in a terminal) —\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user\n\n— cleaned up my launch services database without having to log out and back in (which didn't work in the first place) or restarting (haven't tried it).\nI've noticed that placing .app bundles in a hidden folder, i.e. one with a dot as the first character, e.g. \".my-downloads\", will stop Spotlight from indexing them and presenting them as launchable apps. I'm wondering if the same applies to the lsregister scanning. If so, putting my downloads in ~/.downloads and then simply creating a symlink to this folder as \"Downloads\" should keep me safe. Gonna try that out.\n", "Q: Completely erased my Leopard machine from another computer, how do I install an OS on it? I started up my computer in Target Disk Mode and erased it from a friends Mac thinking that I could then install Mountain Lion without installing Snow Leopard. Do I have any way of getting my machine to work again?\nIt currently powers on and display a blinking folder with a question mark.\nWhat can I do to install an OS?\nI have a Mountain Lion install disk which gets spit out.\nI also made an Ubuntu disk as per instructions on their site, but that gets spit out as well.\nAny help?\n\nA: When you turn on the computer, put the disc in the drive with one hand, and hold down the option key with the other.  This forces the Mac to look for ANY bootable media.  If nothing comes up, the hard drive is blank (as you suspect), and the ROM drive can't read the disc you are putting in (or the ROM drive has failed).  You can try creating a Mountain Lion USB key.  Incidentally, what Mac are you putting this disc in?  A Mac Book Pro, an iMac?  What generation?  What CPU is in it?\n\nA: A flashing question mark at startup means your computer is having trouble locating the system software. Which is normal in your case since you erased the operating system.\nTo fix this:\nIf you had Mountain Lion installed previously there is a chance that the recovery partition is still intact. \nTry to hold Command + R during the startup right behind the chime. And you should boot in the recovery partition from where you can install Mountain Lion again.\nIf you had not Mountain Lion installed previously or you deleted the recovery partition to:\nTry to hold C or Alt during the startup right behind the chime.\nThe first one will try to boot directly from the CD/DVD-drive and the second one should show you an menu with all available bootable drives (including the Mountain Lion install disk).\n\nA: When any disk gets ejected at boot time, the system is rejecting it as bad or the hardware has a problem. Why not run the Mac installer from the other Mac in target mode and either edit this with some more concrete details.\nIf you have problems, check the Minimum Build version to be sure your have an OS build that will support the Mac you are installing it to (and from if they are different).\nIf you are sure you made the DVD correctly - it's a hardware issue. If not, you might need an Apple DVD. Get to 10.6 and then you can update online through the App Store.\n", "Q: How can I prevent my old iPhone from getting Facebook messages? I have an iPhone 5 and now my husband has my old iPhone 4S. For some reason everytime I have a message on Facebook, he's also getting them on his phone under the \"Facebook Messenger\". How can I fix this, so he doesn't get them?\n\nA: It sounds like your account is still linked to your old phone.\nMake sure you are signed out of Facebook on that phone. If this doesn't work, try deleting and reinstalling the app. (This should clear any settings associated with the app.)\n\nA: Before setting him up on your used phone, you should reset the iPhone (Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings), and restore it as a new phone. \n", "Q: HAVP and OS Xserver I am running OS X server 10.8  ClamXAV is built in.  I have installed and am running squidman (Squid proxy server).

Running the install on the update succeeded.\n\nA: The error message is hard evidence that the configure script is getting no output when it tries to run clamav-config but unfortunately the \"not found\" part is an arbitrary assumption in the script, not a result of actual runtime analysis of the failure. There are multiple possible causes for the failure:\n\n\n*\n\n*The configure script isn't seeing what you say is in your $PATH. There are multiple potential root causes for that but one way to rule it out: look in config.log for lines near the top starting with \"PATH: \" to confirm what the script saw in $PATH.\n\n*The permissions for the clamav-config script don't allow the user you are running configure as to execute it. This would be repaired with 'sudo chmod 755 clamav-config' \n\n*Your clamav-config script actually has an empty string as its $prefix value. That would be a bad botch in how clamav was installed, but it might not cause any problems until you try to build something that depends on it. The check would be to look in clamav-config, the fix would be to do a proper clamav install. \n\n*Mountain Lion's sandboxing is blocking the execution of clamav-config by configure. I'm not really sure how to fix this, but the denial should be logged. I'm not sure if ML saves those to any text log, but a suitable 'syslog' invocation will show them (see 'man syslog' for gory details)\n\n\nSide note: #4 is why I've held off moving significant machines to ML. On my guinea pig system there are chronic sandboxing violations by Apple's own programs being blocked, which zeros out my faith that Server components will not break.  \n\nA: Looking at the source of this thing (HAVP) I see the makefile is unlikely to be the culprit.  The configure and the configure.in seem more interesting.\nTry this command:\nclamav-config --prefix 2>/dev/null\n\nwhat does it return, if anything at all?  It is used in the config files as:\nclamprefix=\"`clamav-config --prefix 2>/dev/null`\"\nclamversion=\"`clamav-config --version 2>/dev/null`\"\n\nto determine prefix and version of clamav.  Sorry all I can suggest is a starting point, but I hope it's better than nothing.\n", "Q: Cant connect to google intermittently Sometimes either randomly or after waking my late 2008 MacBook Pro from sleep, I won't be able to access google.com or any of the services. It's mildly annoying, but fixed by turning off my wifi, and then turning it back on. \nWhen this happens, changing browsers doesn't help.

Seems to me like this only confuses, since conversations are separated by address/phone number. Are their any advantages, or is it safe to remove all email address from my iMessage?\n\nA: In the past, the main reason to iMessage to emails, was so that users could receive them on their Mac, iPad, or iPod Touch. However, iOS 6 and Mountain Lion allow the user to sync Messages across all their devices. This works great as long as the recipient has a iPhone, and have updated their software to the latest version. If they just have an iPad, for example, you would want to text their email address, as they wouldn't have a phone number to associate with. Also, some people don't update their devices as soon as one comes available, and as a result, some may still be using iOS 5 which wouldn't support that functionality.\nBeyond those reasons, there should be no reason, why not to text someone's phone number. In fact, that is basically all I do.\n", "Q: Permanent way to keep youtube playing in iOS5 Is there a permanent way to keep youtube playing when I tap the home button or close the lid of my iPad? I know that if I double click on the home button, slide to the bottom list of apps to the right and press play, it keeps youtube playing. But I do not want to mess with it everytime. So, do you know a way to keep youtube playing without doing this everytime?\n\nA: You could use a different app for playing Youtube videos, which don't stop playing when you press the home button. YStream/Ystream2 is an example of such an application (amongst others).\nAs far as I know there is no way to prevent the built in Youtube app from stopping playback when the app is \"minimized\". These are the ways I know of for resuming playback:\n\n\n*\n\n*Double tap the Home button, slide the bottom row, and press play. (As you mentioned)\n\n*Lock the screen, Double tap Home button, Press Play. (I usually find this slightly faster)\n\n*Use a Bluetooth keybord with a \"Play\" button.\n\n*Activating VoiceOver and double tapping the screen with two fingers.\n\n*Using the Play button on your headphones.\n\n"]
