["Q: Postfix SMTP not available from external network I'm trying to setup an SMTP server using Postfix. I already have virtual mailboxes and a Dovecot IMAP server running (and working). I can mail my@ema.il and see the mail coming in with an IMAP client. However, sending mails from external locations doesn't work.\nI did a netcat from internal:\nroot@cs:/# netcat localhost 25\n220 camilstaps.nl ESMTP Postfix (Ubuntu)\nhelo localhost\n250 camilstaps.nl\nmail from:<test@vivisoft.nl>\n250 2.1.0 Ok\nrcpt to:<info@vivisoft.nl>\n250 2.1.5 Ok\ndata\n354 End data with <CR><LF>.<CR><LF>\nSubject: Test\n\nHello\n.\n250 2.0.0 Ok: queued as 19CBA412F0\n\nAnd also tried a netcat from an external server, but that didn't work, I don't get a response (the shell keeps open until I ^C or a timeout occurs).\nI thought the server wasn't listening on every IP, so I tried a netstat, and this was the result:\ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:25              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      2378/master\ntcp6       0      0 :::25                   :::*                    LISTEN      2378/master\n\nSo that can't be the problem, right?

I get a black screen with a window saying:\n\nYour display, graphics card, input devices are not detected properly, You need to reconfigure it.\n\nBut sometimes I don't face such problem, it just boots alright. When it boots, I can see that it shows \"Graphics : Intel Ivybridge\" in \"About this computer\".\nSo what's wrong?

Here's what you need to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal. To do so, hit Ctrl+Alt+T.\n\n*Type cd /home/daniel/Downloads/. This command will go to that folder (i.e. change our working directory to that folder).\n\n*Type sudo chmod +x metasploit-latest-linux-installer.run. Enter your password when asked. This command makes the file executable, so that you can \"install\" it.\n\n*Type sudo ./metasploit-latest-linux-installer.run. This command will run the file.\n\n\nWait a bit, and you should see the Metasploit screen come up and continue with the installation.\nEDIT: thanks to Leopoldo Pla's answer:\nOnce the installation is done, you can update metasploit using the command sudo msfupdate...this can take some time though. Once it's done, you can fire up the metsploit framework console using the command sudo msfconsole.\nEnjoy the exploiting!\n", "Q: Does running a console emulator will make the laptop hotter? I have a gba rom, and a gba emulator which is  vba-m. If I do run the rom on the emulator will it cause an additional heat to the laptop? Will it be the same result on windows system?\n\nA: Any application that utilizes a lot of processing power will make your laptop hotter. Emulators usually use a lot of CPU power and it may result in making laptop hotter. Observe your CPU usage (use top or any other tool) while running emulation. Use lm-sensors to observe heat. Results may vary depending on emulator and your hardware.\n", "Q: Wubi error installing - Extraction failed with code: 2 I tried to reinstall Ubuntu with Wubi after having a problem on my existing Wubi install which booted to a GRUB> prompt.\nBut now I have new problem:\n\nUbuntu Installer\n\nAn error occured:\nExtraction failed with code: 2\nFor more information, please see the log file:\nc:\\users\\joseda~1.per\\appdata\\local\\temp\\wubi-12.04-rev272.log\n\nHere's the download to the log file:\n\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/?ozois9eeo6aa7ya\n\n\nA: As you can see from the log, the diskimage file is 549666608 bytes, but it only downloaded 2728096 bytes.

If so, try a virtual machine - virtualbox is pretty good.\nIf you want to install it alongside your Windows installation, first things first you need to check whether or not you have any spare partitions on your hard drive.\nMost hard drive can only take 4 \"real\" partitions, and Windows OEM has a tendency to eat up all 4 of them, I have yet to figure out what each of them does (I don't really care much for Windows, after all) but typically one of them will be a recovery section.\nRun a live version of Ubuntu, and when you're in open the Terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T). Type\nsudo gparted\n\nThat will tell you what the usage of the partitions looks like. If you have 4 distinct areas blocked off, you can't install Ubuntu alongside Windows without doing some magic to the hard drive.\nLet me know what the gparted read looks like (don't touch anything on gparted... it has the potential to do some serious damage), just post a screenshot, and I'll take a look.\n", "Q: Rhythmbox hangs when changing song properties I am having problems when trying to change song properties in rhythmbox 2.98 (Ubuntu 13.04).

I want to know what is the benefit/necessity of upgrading to a new kernel?\n\nA: Kernel updates help a lot (for example, my wifi card wasn't recognized in the ancient kernel-using CentOS, but worked fine under Ubuntu and Fedora, which both have newish kernels), fix weirdness, kind of like bios updates, improve performance a bit, etc.\nThey're like updating to a new Windows, because the old one doesn't support something, or glitches out tons.\n\nA: As far as I'm concerned, the question of kernel upgrading is the same as any other updgrade/update.\nWhy upgrade to Ubuntu 13.04 for example? It's something new and it comes with the hope of improved performance, better compatibility etc.\nUnlike upgrading your entire operating system, you can keep the old kernel easily (by just not getting rid of it after you upgrade) and go back to it at any time. (Holding shift at startup should boot into grub and let you pick from any kernel you have installed)\nI had some serious issues with the 3.5 kernel (sound problems, wifi crashes, graphics failures) so I upgraded to 3.8 and never looked back. (I did however have a sound card problem with 3.8-18 but that was quickly upgrade anyway.)\nSo in short, there's no necessity to upgrade by any means - my wife is still running 3.2 on Zorin 6 and is happy with the performance - but there might be benefits. It's a bit of a dice roll sometimes though, so be fair warned that upgrading your kernel (particulary if you delete the old one) may cause some unwanted side effects.\n", "Q: source .bashrc does nothing after installing virtualenvwrapper I edited .bash_profile and added those lines (it was blank actually)\nexport WORKON_HOME=\"$HOME/.virtualenvs\"\nsource /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh\n\nthen I sourced .bashrc the normal is to apply the changes and output some lines on terminal\nbut nothing happens\nwhat is the problem?\n\nA: The .bash_profile is used just by login-shells.

I shut it down normally with a full shut down and when I turned it back on and it booted automatically into ubuntu, it didn't work anymore.

I rebooted into windows and turned it off again to test it, but it didn't work.\nAny ideas what went wrong?\n\nA: My guess is that the partition for windows 8 isn't mounted. If it's not mounted, you can't access it. You can test this out by opening nautilus and clicking on the drive for windows 8 and then trying the link you made. You'll need to mount that partition every time you turn on your computer or create a script to run everytime on boot to mount that parition.\n", "Q: rsync creating 0 byte files on cifs mounted drive Hi I have been using rsync successfully to backup files from my external drive to a cifs mounted shared drive since Ubuntu 10.04\nNow with 13.04 I am getting a strage behavior with the following command\nrsync -av /media/hari/MyExtDrive/  /home/MyDFSMountedCIFSDrive/DataBackup/\n\nThe \"MyDFSMountedCIFSDrive\" is mounted using options\nsudo mount -t cifs //10.1.1.11/dfsroot/archive/ /home/MyDFSMountedCIFSDrive -o user=hari,rw,nosuid,gid=1000,uid=1000,hard\n\nNow when I use the rsync command.

If I'm not mistaken root have # at the end. \nI also found a lot of commands in the forums that begin with $:\n$ sudo apt-get update \n\nSo for what does $ actually stand for?\nEDIT (28.01.2014) :\nToday I came across this video that totally answers my question from 8 months ago and decided to share it here :)\nBASH Basics - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x73WTEltyHU\n\nA: The $ sign it the end of the prompt in terminal when you add a command like the one you showed, do not type in the $ else it will not work.\nSo $ sudo apt-get update \nwould be typed in as:\nsudo apt-get update \n\nHope that helps.\nEdit\nThe ~ stands for your Home folder so name@pc_name:~/Desktop$ would show that you are in the Home>Desktop folder.\n\nA: The ~ and $ are elements of the command line prompt. This indicates that your computer (or more exactly, I guess, the shell you are running) is waiting for user input.  It is prompting you to input a command.\nThe $ is merely a separator or divider. It separates the command prompt from the command which follows it.  When people write such things as $ sudo apt-get update (your example), they are simply telling you that the command, in this case sudo apt-get update, needs to be entered at a command prompt. Strictly speaking, perhaps, the $ is redundant in this context.\nOther separators may be used in other situations. For example, # is used for a root shell.\nThe ~ (called 'tilde') is shorthand for your home directory.  When it appears in a command prompt, e.g., user@hostame:~$, it indicates that the current working directory is your home directory.  Thus if you run the list command, ls, without specifying any particular directory, it will list the contents of your home directory.\n(By the way, $HOME, is not a command, as you suggest, but rather an environment variable. It determines the location of your home directory.  You can see its value by running $ echo $HOME.)\n\nA: Traditionally, a shell prompt either ends with $, % or #. If it ends with $, this indicates a shell that's compatible with the Bourne shell (such as a POSIX shell, or a Korn shell, or Bash). If it ends with %, this indicates a C shell (csh or tcsh). If it ends with #, this indicates that the shell is running as the system's superuser account (root). \nSource: here\n\nA: *\n\n*~ stands for your home directory.\n\n*$ it's a separator for your system, it comes from the command \\$ from the man page.\nSo if you find a command beginning with $ it just says that nothing should be added before that. \nuser@ubuntu:~$\n\nuser is the username your are logged in with. \n@ is just to say here is a link.\nubuntu is the name of the system you are logged in as. \n:~ says that you are in the user home directory now.\n$ comes from the \\$ escape sequence in the $PS1. man page. \nBut this can all be changed by reading in the man page. \nThank you @demure for the help. \n", "Q: How to set up remote desktop sharing through SSH? Is there a way to view (and control) a remote desktop through SSH?

And then double click connection-name(home-desktop as shown in the picture) to start browsing remote desktop.\n\nMethod 2:\nx11vnc is a simple VNC server and you won't have to mess around with Gnome settings or 500 firewalls, just install x11vnc on all your computers (with puppet or whatever you're using for mass-control).\nThen from your local computer run:\nssh user@host -L 5900:localhost:5900 \"x11vnc -display :0 -noxdamage\"\n\nObviously swapping user@host for the username and hostname/IP of the remote computer.\nAnd then use a VNC client of your choice to connect to localhost:5900. The SSH command starts a vnc server on the remote computer and then tunnels back that port over SSH. You don't have to open up any ports (as long as you can already SSH).\nIf your computers have funny display settings, you might do better to leave off the -display :0 segment in the SSH command. x11vnc will then automatically try to find the right display.\n\nSource: askubuntu\n\nA: I was able to set a fresh Ubuntu 16.04 install from a remote ssh connection with the following script:\n\n#!/bin/bash\nexport DISPLAY=:0\nread -e -p \"VNC Password: \" -i \"ubuntu\" password\ndconf write /org/gnome/desktop/remote-access/enabled true\ndconf write /org/gnome/desktop/remote-access/prompt-enabled false\ndconf write /org/gnome/desktop/remote-access/authentication-methods \"['vnc']\"\ndconf write /org/gnome/desktop/remote-access/require-encryption false\ndconf write /org/gnome/desktop/remote-access/vnc-password \\\"\\'$(echo -n $password | base64)\\'\\\"\ndconf dump /org/gnome/desktop/remote-access/\nsudo service lightdm restart\n\nThe quoting is important for any of the string settings (single ticks inside quotes).

It means your pc has 2 graphic cards, one this NVIDIA and second is Intels integrated card. If so, you should take a look at bumblebee-project because linux does not support nvidia drivers, as far as i know. Guess you should reinstall ubuntu and this time avoid installing NVIDIA drivers, but instead install bumblebee, otherwise pc would heat a lot. Hope I helped.\nActually I think you can test for optimus by writing: \nlspci | grep VGA\n\nin console. If it shows intel and nvidia controllers like:\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 2nd Generation Core Processor       Family Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 09)\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GF108M [GeForce GT 540M] (rev ff)\n\nthen you have optimus.\n\nA: You could try using \"Ctrl + Alt + F2\" to enter the recovery console. Then use\nsudo apt-get remove <driver name>\n\nThen try\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-304-stable\n\nas I know the 304 version worked for me\n", "Q: How to tell a wlan card supports RFMON mode Can someone please tell me how to check if a wlan card supports promiscuous mode\n\nA: RFMON support depends on the chipset used in the adapter. Research the wlan card, find out what chipset it uses, and then find out if the chipset can operate in RFMON mode with the right driver.\nThis website is an excellent resource for just that.\n\nA: To check if your wireless card supports monitor mode, you can use iw list. \nRun in a terminal:\niw list\nOutput:\nSupported interface modes:\n     * IBSS\n     * managed\n     * AP\n     * AP/VLAN\n     * monitor\n\nIn Supported interface modes, if you find monitor to be present then that means that your wireless card supports monitor mode.\n", "Q: agent-state: pending for over 20 minutes I'm using juju against HP Cloud and the instance shows built and I can ping it fine but the juju status is showing it's still pending and it's not coming up in a browser.

If not, consider destroying the environment again then juju bootstrap --show-log --debug to identify what's going on.\n", "Q: Why the $2.99 minimum price for apps According to http://developer.ubuntu.com/publish/ Apps can only be published at a $2.99 minimum price, which seems to include the ubuntu touch apps. \n99% of the apps I have purchased on android are $0.99\nIf Ubuntu goes ahead with this, isn't it going to:\n1) exclude a lot of developers/apps. \n2) or Force developers to push up the price, so that you end up paying 3x as much for the same product. \n3) or give the app away free but force more adds or in game/app purchases which are the bane of the app world. \n\nA: From the Commercial Software FAQ:\n\nWhat is the minimum price I can charge for software?\nThe minimum price for applications is 2.99 USD. The transaction fee we charge has to off-set the credit card charges, bank charges and fraud detection that takes place within the payment platform. By enforcing a minimum price we ensure that processing transactions doesn’t cost more than the transaction fee. We intend to lower the minimum price over time.\n\n", "Q: How to enable multiple displays with Catalyst drivers in 13.04? First, I installed Ubuntu 13.04.\nI have an ATI Radeon HD 7850.\nThe open source drivers allowed multiple displays, but were horrendously laggy (even opening a browser window took several seconds). When I installed the Catalyst proprietary drivers, performance was perfect. The only problem is that trying to enable dual-monitors in the Catalyst center was grayed out and in the Ubuntu settings resulted in the resolution error.\nIs there any way around this?\n\nHere is the quote from the error box when trying to change display settings.\n\nThe selected configuration for displays could not be applied\nrequired virtual size does not fit available size: requested=(3840,\n  1080), minimum=(320, 200), maximum=(1920, 1920)\n\nHere is the grayed out option in Catalyst...\n\n\nA: Just a quick sanity check, but that setting requires root... Did you open as root (w/like 'sudo amdcccle')? If not, this is required in order to change that setting.\nThough if you didn't there is usually a pop-up that states \"To make changes on this page Administrator access is required....\" This pop-up has a check box \"Do not show me this again\". Given your \"grayed out\" symptoms, this seems like it would be the issue, and the do not show me again option may have been previously selected... \nIn ubuntu-gnome 13.04 (hate that name, as it is now an official distro, it should be Gnubuntu, following the alternate DE naming convention), a launcher is created for AMD CCC and AMD CCC (Administrative) but I couldn't get the latter to work until I installed gksu (which 13.04 excludes by default).\n", "Q: What should I put on the \"Devvice for boot loader installation\" part? I have a laptop that has Windows 7 installed. Even before installing Windows 7, I already made a second partition to store extra files, etc. Now that I'm wanting to dual boot to Ubuntu 13.04, I have moved all the files that was in the second partition (drive D) to a folder in the first partition (drive C). Now since I don't need to repartition drive D, I went to \"Advanced\". Here I am presented with the list of hard drives and below it, I can see \"Device for boot loader installation\". WHat do I select on here? My choicse are\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda\n\n*/dev/sda1 Windows 7 (loader)\n\n*/dev/sda2 (This is probably drive C.)\n\n*/dev/sda3 (This is probably drive D.)\n\n\nAdditional questions:\nWhat file system should I format drive  D in and also what mount point should I select?\n\nA: Choose /dev/sda (hard disk's master boot record) otherwise the computer will boot directly to Windows. And be careful, choosing \"Windows 7 (loader)\" will probably prevent you from boot Windows.\nThe default filesystem for Ubuntu installation is ext4 and there should be at least a mount point for /.\n", "Q: discrete GPU not working after update I updated Ubuntu few days ago and my discrete GPU stopped working.

I'm running Ubuntu 13.04.\n\nA: The instructions assume you need vagrant to install Ubuntu, and are apparently geared towards people mainly using Windows or Mac and who would benefit from a separate VM to install and play with discourse. If Seth has an \"Ubuntu machine lying around\" with 13.04 already installed, he can just clone the git repo and set it up locally.\nSetting things up locally and manually is documented here on GitHub. However it does seem a bit complex, the vagrant VM has all the needed services (pgsql, redis) already preconfigured so may be easier to get started with.\nThat said, if you're feeling brave, you can follow these steps to install and configure things on your local Ubuntu machine.\nDisclaimer, it is a complex procedure that involves many moving parts, I tested this procedure on a freshly installed 13.04 system but if things go wrong, you should be prepared to decypher error messages and fix things. You should be comfortable with:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu package installation.\n\n*Text file editing.\n\n*Having some knowledge of Postgres commandline usage.\n\n*Being minimally familiar with Ruby, Rails and rubygems.\n\n*Some git doesn't hurt, but it's only used for the initial cloning phase\n\n\nOK, here goes\nInstall needed packages:\nsudo apt-get install git ruby ruby-bundler build-essential libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev redis-server postgresql libpq-dev postgresql-contrib-9.1\n\nCreate a postgresql database and grant permissions to the user who is going to run discourse (I'll assume it's named \"john\", it could/should be your username):\nsudo -u postgres createdb discourse_development\nsudo -u postgres psql -c \"create user john with password 'whatever' \"\nsudo -u postgres psql -c \"grant all privileges on database discourse_development to john\"\n#This is a bit of postgresql magic to add the required hstore and pg_trgm extensions\nsudo -u postgres psql discourse_development -c \"create extension hstore; create extension pg_trgm\"\n\nClone the repository:\ngit clone https://github.com/discourse/discourse\ncd discourse\n\nUse Bundler to install ruby gems and dependencies including rails:\nbundle install\n\nYou may run into dependency problems here, as other packages may be needed to build native extensions.

I have a Macbook Pro that is currently running OSX. I installed ubuntu on a Windows laptop I had lying around to try it out. I liked it a lot but I didn't want to commit any space to it on my internal storage on my Macbook Pro (my internal storage is not very large to begin with).\nI wanted to install ubuntu to a larger external (bootable) hard drive. I downloaded ubuntu 12.04 (.iso file), and then I burned the image to a DVD. I booted up my Mac in the \"try ubuntu\" mode. Then I setup my wireless connection and clicked \"install ubuntu\". Then I clicked the \"something else\" option.\nThis is the guide I used to partition my hard drive\nNote: I made sure to select my external hard drive (Seagate 500 gb external drive) for the boot loader installation\nOnce I had everything partitioned correctly, I started the installation which took about 15 minutes. I rebooted my Mac and it booted directly into ubuntu. I installed a bunch of updates and then I shut my computer down. I wanted to boot up OSX again so I removed the hard drive and turned my computer on. It came up with the no such device: grub rescue error.\nHere is a question about the error for those who are unfamiliar:\n\n\n*\n\n*Grub rescue after installing Ubuntu on a external HDD from USB\nSo what this means is that even know I told the installer to put the boot loader on the external hard drive, it put it on my internal hard drive. It took me days of screwing around to try to get grub off, I ended up just restoring my Macbook from my Time Machine.\nThis is obviously a problem in ubuntu 12.04. It seems like if you want to install ubuntu 12.04, you should probably just partition your internal because it has issues with installing to an external hard drive. I don't want to install ubuntu on my internal hard drive because if I do that neither OS will have a practical amount of space.\nNow here is my question:\nIs the problem fixed in ubuntu 13.04? If the problem is not fixed in 13.04, is there a build of ubuntu where it is not a problem?\n\nBOUNTY\nHow can I install Ubuntu on an external USB Hard drive WITHOUT installing Grub (or Grub2) onto my Mac internal storage?\n\nA: Just a theory here, but might be worth trying. Could you boot to your Ubuntu on the external HDD, run Boot-Repair and select Advanced Options. Assuming you don't have Boot-Repair installed:\nReferenced from this source:\n\n(Open a terminal, and type (or copy-paste) the following command:\nsudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\n\nPress Enter, then type the following command:\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\n\nOnce Boot-Repair is installed, you should be able to choose Advanced Options, then choose which OS to boot by default (OS X in your case). You would also want to choose \"Place GRUB into: \" and select the partition that you have Ubuntu installed into (your external drive).\nTheoretically, this should keep GRUB from interfering from your OS X bootloader while giving you the option to boot Ubuntu when your External HDD is connected. I'm at work currently and therefore away from my Ubuntu Desktop, so I am unable to try this. Let me know how it goes! Good luck! \n\nA: Ok, here is my \"best\" answer. \nFirst, grub-update should write it's updates to the device represented by \"/\" when doing update-grub.  That's the core of your problem. \n'apt-get' will run update-grub from time to time, and if update-grub tries to write to the wrong device... Then your back to the nightmare of trying to get the Mac to actually boot far enough to even read a CD. In addition there doesn't seem to be a way I can find to get update-grub to not run. \nWhat I have done in the past to get this to work is cludgy, but it works. \n\n\n*\n\n*get refit up and running. \n\n*Next Install Ubuntu and Grub-pc to the USB device. \n\n*Boot Into linux, \n\n*apt-get install grub-efi\n\n*reboot\n\n\nWhat this does is leaves the MBR version of grub on the usb device and instead \"updates\" the efi version of grub. This makes an extra entry in refit, but has little effect (other then annoying). \nUnfortunately it also means you have to update grub by had from a recovery CD every single time. You can't update it from your local install because grub-update would write to the wrong device again during install, and the normal grub-update is only writing to EFI files.\nIt does however keep the USB version of Linux booting, and without borking your hard drive to the point that your trying to find pre-Lion install disks to get it to work again. \nThe very best answer would be to just disable auto running of grub-update, but I have yet to find a way to do that.\n", "Q: Is it possible to stop laptop's battery from charging? I use Dell Inspiron N4030 laptop. In win7 I was installing Dell Battery software that it was showing battery status and providing a tool for stopping it from charging(when it's connected to AC power)\nIn Ubuntu it's not possible to do this work and I scare to hurt my battery due to the overcharge. \nIs there any way?\n\nA: that dependes of the laptop and his design cause in my work repairing laptops some times even if the motherboard is death the battery still reach charge, because it works with a independent IC chip. \n", "Q: 12.10: two monitors; one works, one only displays solid color I have a one-day-old 12.10 install on a Dell machine with an ATI Radeon 6450 graphics card, and two Samsung monitors (one connected through VGA, one DVI). I also have disk encryption enabled, and I'm using classic GNOME instead of Unity.\nThis all started with a different problem, actually: when I rebooted the system, the BIOS would load, the purple background of what I assume was GRUB appeared for a few seconds, and then both screens would go into power save.\nAt first, I got around this by simply hard-rebooting when it got \"stuck,\" and everything was fine. Today, I tried hitting some random keys, and surprisingly, the disk encryption screen came up. When I logged in, however, one of my monitors (the DVI) worked fine, but the other (the VGA) looked like this. (By the way, I'm using TwinView or whatever the equivalent is; that is, I'm not mirroring monitors.)\n\nThe picture isn't good, but basically it's a solid color similar to whatever color the desktop background is, with lots of slightly darker vertical lines. Changing the desktop background changes this solid color. If I change to \"mirror screens,\" this monitor displays a solid gray color.\nInitially, after one reboot, I also had to deal with a different problem where I couldn't log in through X (due to ~/.Xauthority changing owners). While I was trying to fix that, I rebooted a couple times and messed a bit with my ~/.config/ (deleted monitors.xml) and /etc/X11/Xorg.conf (tried to generate a new one), and had some even weirder things happen, e.g. mirrored screens where one was translated about a quarter-screen to the left, and then wrapped. \nBut now that part's fixed, and I'm still left with one working monitor and one solid-color monitor.\nTo be honest, it might be easiest to just do a fresh install, but I'm worried the same thing might just happen again (maybe it's a hardware thing?)\nEDIT: some more info--if I change to lower resolutions, that monitor starts flashing madly...\n\nA: Well, I installed the new X updates from Ubuntu, and it works fine now. Not sure what was fixed, but it's fixed.\n", "Q: How to create a DVD rip/ISO? I am trying to create a back up of my \"Chappelle's Show\" DVD collection.

Or is there a way to magically pause the terminal when it's waiting for the device to reboot into recovery mode? Or where in the code can I change it from, say, Sleep 5 sec to sleep 10 sec.\n\nA: I figured it out. Either it was a coincidence that it just happened to work this time or I was right that I just had to change the sleep time in the script /usr/bin/phablet-flash. \nOpen phablet-flash through terminal (as root so you can edit it)\nsudo -H gedit '/usr/bin/phablet-flash' \n\nand in the area:\n@adb_errors\ndef autodeploy(adb, artifact):\n    ''' Pushes artifact to devices sdcard and deploys'''\n    if not artifact:\n        return\n    # Can't wait-for-device here\n    sleep(15)\n    adb.push(artifact, '/sdcard/autodeploy.zip')\n    log.info('Deploying Ubuntu')\n    adb.reboot(recovery=True)\n    log.info('Installation will complete soon and reboot into Ubuntu')\n\nI changed\nsleep(15)\n\nto\nsleep(30)\n\nYou can then re-run the 'phablet-flash -b' command and it should work\n\nAlso if any other noobs like me trying to reinstall Android have the problem of deploying:\n./flash-all.sh\n\nand get the error\nbash: ./flash-all.sh: Permission denied\n\nGo to your android distribution folder, open flash-all.sh and copy and paste the commands from that script to the terminal and run them separately, simple as. \n", "Q: Do I need permission to make an Ubuntu section in my computer store?

This should do the same thing:\nsudo apt-get --purge clamav\n\nWhen you remove via the software center, all the configuration files get left on your system, and when you re-install, they are still there. It's like you never removed it.\nI'm not saying this is the problem, but it could be the problem.\n[Edit] I don't believe either option removes config files in ~/ so you might try looking in your home directory as well for some .clam directory or file you'd want to delete as part of a purge.\n", "Q: How do I download Adobe Flash on Ubuntu 12.10?

I was surprised to see an alpha package in an LTS release. Why put such an alpha package in an LTS release, no matter how stable it can be?  It can be misleading for careless people who didn' t check the version number in detail.\n\nA: The Samba package (even in Ubuntu 13.04) points at Samba version 3 (specifically 3.6 in 12.04), so a user looking to install Samba would install version 3 of the software (as well as would any software that depended on Samba). \nThe samba4 package has been available in Ubuntu since at least as far back as 10.04 (older versions are no longer supported, so a package search doesn't show results from them). For various good reasons packages aren't removed from the repositories (there are cases where this happens, usually when the package ceases to exist), and surely wouldn't be removed for an LTS release only to be readded later. \nFurther, to install Samba version 4, a user would have to specifically look for and install the samba4 package.\nLastly, samba4 (even in 13.04) is in the Universe repository, and as such is not supported at all by Canonical. So from a business standpoint, Samba 4 being available in 12.04 is irrelevant.\nFrom https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu\n\nUniverse - Community maintained software, i.e. not officially\n  supported software.\n\n", "Q: Control Fan Speed Command Line After running service kmod start I get this error:\nRejected send message, 1 matched rules; type=\"method_call\", sender=\":1.77\" (uid=1000 pid=2871 comm=\"start kmod \") interface=\"com.ubuntu.Upstart0_6.Job\" member=\"Start\" error name=\"(unset)\" requested_reply=\"0\" destination=\"com.ubuntu.Upstart\" (uid=0 pid=1 comm=\"/sbin/init\")\n\nDoes anyone know what this means and how I can fix it?\n\nA: Try: sudo service kmod start ..\n", "Q: 3840x2160 resolution with Radeon HD 7870 not working I just got a Seiki 4k monitor. \nI am trying to get it to run at full resolution but so far no luck.

I'm a Ubuntu newbie in need of some advice from anyone very familiar with the different Ubuntu startup methodologies.\nI'm interested in enumerating all the applications that are triggered at startup on any given install of Ubuntu 13.04 or higher. I know there is a wide variety of ways that a script or application can be launched at boot time, but I would like to be sure that I have a comprehensive list for all autostart config locations.\nThe end goal is to write a script that iterates through all the config locations, then spits out a list of all things triggered between power on and when the desktop is ready to use. \nSo far I know about:\n\n\n*\n\n*upstart, example config file: /etc/init.d/foo\n\n*autostart (system), example config file: /etc/xdg/autostart/foo.desktop\n\n*autostart (profile), example config file:  ~/.config/autostart/foo.desktop\n\n*cron's @reboot, example config file: /var/spool/cron/crontabs\nIs there any other way that an application can inject itself into the overall system startup sequence or are the possibilities endless?\nExamples of apps that you might consider when answering, that I imagine could have a nonstandard startup:\nAntivirus software, malware, daemon, custom script, production software - free / nonfree, binaries, indicators, dropbox, etc.\nIs there an application already available that will enumerate iterally everything that runs at boot?\nThanks, any help is appreciated.\n\nA: The possibilities are (essentially) endless. Scripts and applications can trigger other scripts and applications that don't live any of the places listed.\nThe 'bootchart' package is one good way to list (and display) all applications, what started them, and when in the boot cycle they started. It is also handy for discovering the cause of an unusually-long boot. It works for the system it is installed on, not for the hypothetical any-given-install.\n", "Q: How to create a system-wide environmental variable?

After all, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables does say that /etc/environment is the place for setting system-wide environment variables\nThe same issue for INFOPATH\n\nA: A previous question's answers suggest that variable interpolations like $MANPATH are not supported in /etc/environment: difference between bash.bashrc and /etc/environment file . I think you would need to extend /etc/manpath.config itself with your customizations instead of using /etc/environment.\nHowever, you probably don't need a custom installation of texlive in /usr/local in the first place.

If I use the menu to open a new window of the same application (e.g. New Window in Firefox, or even if I just open Help -> About), the colour is fine on the new window that pops up, it's only the window that was open when the application stopped responding that is 'stuck' in the dimmed state. \n\nA: The fading is done by the Fading Windows compiz plugin.

While doing some coding with taglib-ruby (which requires TagLib (http ://taglib.github.io/ - sorry, I'm not allowed to post more than 2 links..)), I came across a strange problem and after a few days found out that this apparently has been fixed in TagLib 1.7.2.

BUt I reckon what you want to archive is to sync the remote backup folder with your PC (sync directories).\nIn this case, the most suitable tool would be rsync instead of scp.\nGood news is that rsync works perfectly fine over SSH, your public key authentication will keep working like a charm.\nYou can use command like below to keep your backup on the remote server in sync with your PC\nrsync -avz --delete --progress --stats some_directories host@ip-address:backupFolder/\n\nNOTE: be careful with rsync's trailing slash => /.

The software is not simply cross-compatible.\nI assume the \"Microsoft 8\" you're talking about is Windows 8.

I have recently seen Nitroshare promoted on this site and have installed it in Ubuntu (Xubuntu 12.10) and Win7.\nI was able to transfer files but only up to a certain size. I have not tested with very large files, up to 60 MB it worked, but an archive of about 360 MB was not successfully transferred. While a folder of 128MB was sent, a zip archive of the same folder was not, crashing the sending application.\nI see here that in fact the free version is the lite one, with clear limitations.\n\nWhat does that mean exactly? I guess that the bandwidth is limited here, not the file size to be transferred.\nI see the limitation considered here as a bug, in relation to a limit representing \"anything larger than about one-half the amount of memory your computer has\". But if that's the RAM, even the bugged limit is far larger than what I've experienced.\nWhat is the real limit - so that I would not bother transferring something that is too large ?\nAlso, I do not see any progress bar in the \"share box\" on the desktop as supposed and illustrated here, not even when the transfer works .\n\nA: \nUpdate:\nAs of NitroShare 0.3.0 (released March 21, 2015), this limitation no longer applies. NitroShare can now transfer files of any size. It also displays transfer progress on both the sending and receiving device.\n\n\n\nI was able to transfer files but only up to a certain size.\n\nThis is indeed a limitation of the current stable version (0.2).\n\nI see here that in fact the free version is the lite one, with clear limitations.\n\nActually, your screenshot is from the new website being prepared for NitroShare 0.3, which has not yet been released. You can safely ignore anything stated there when referring to NitroShare 0.2, which does not artificially impose any limitation on file size.\n\nBut if that's the RAM, even the bugged limit is far larger than what I've experienced.\n\nThe underlying problem here is that NitroShare 0.2 loads each file into memory when transferring it over the network - so the size of the file is limited by the amount of available memory to the application. And that number depends on quite a few variables.\n\nAlso, I do not see any progress bar in the \"share box\" on the desktop as supposed and illustrated here, not even when the transfer works.\n\nIf I remember correctly, NitroShare only displays progress on the machine sending the files. If you are not seeing progress on either machine, then that's a bug.\n", "Q: Are there other applications beside Nitroshare to send files between computers on the same LAN? I have tried Nitroshare and had appreciated the simple way to install in order to transfer files between my devices with different OS-es. But, given the fact that Nitroshare has some bug/limitation (as reported here) I would like to know if there are other such programs available at a comparable level of required skills.  \n\nA: TransferOnLAN is a similar tool, based on Java.\nIt works in Linux (extract archive and execute the TransferOnLAN.sh file) and in Windows. Once opened on all machines, all should be visible. \n\n\n\nRestart the program on all machines when others are not visible as they should.\n\n\nSeparate files can be selected and sent together and will appear as one package as in the images above. Sending a second file while another is in progress will create a waiting list.\n\nDukto is very impressive and with a very elegant Metro style.

This user does not have a password, access is via SSH key pair\nI don't want to set a password for ubuntu user, preferring the security of SSH.\nHow do I access webmin without needing to enter a password? Is it best I create a new userid with a password that is also a sudoer? Seems a bit daft given that is one reason i want webmin in the first place :-)\n\nA: A slightly updated answer.\nRunning Ubuntu 20.04 and Webmin 1.99, changepass.pl was actually located in /usr/share/webmin/changepass.pl.  If yours is not in that location, you can run sudo find / -name changepass.pl to find it.\nAlso, Webmin was setup with username root instead of ubuntu so the correct command to change the Webmin username was:\nsudo /usr/share/webmin/changepass.pl /etc/webmin root <your_password>\nAfter running that command I was able to login to the web interface.\n\nA: I also have that same problem when installing webmin on DigitalOcean Droplet. A bit of research shows me that I can change the password in SSH terminal.\nLet's say you want your webmin user ubuntu to have password foo:\n/usr/libexec/webmin/changepass.pl /etc/webmin ubuntu foo\nNow you can login to webmin with your new password.\n\nA: The Webmin wiki has a documentation section where it explains the process of granting users specific per module or system-wide rights. You will also find examples on how to create new webmin users and how to modify existing user privileges. In effect you can bypass the sudo system but at the same time design a more granular per module per user access control system.  \n", "Q: Detecting the fault in my sed command I am creating a command to replace all instances of ; f. to , (frequent). .

Also, . has a special meaning in a regular expression - it matches any character. To match the literal dot, use \\.. Moreover, [:space:] must be used inside a character class, so you should use [[:space:]]. Finally, character classes have no meaning in the replacement part of the expression.\nThis should work:\nsed 's/;[[:space:]]f\\./, (frequent)./g'\n\n", "Q: How to fix the audio output now?

Upon starting for the first time, I am told that \"No interface can be used for capturing in this system with the current configuration\"\nbelow that is \"Capture Help\"\nfollowed by \"HOW TO CAPTURE - A step by step guide to a successful capture set up\"\nGuide is as follows:\n\nHow To Set Up a Capture\n\nStep 1: Are you allowed to do this?\nStep 2: General Setup\nStep 3: Capture traffic \"sent to\" and \"sent from\" your local machine\nStep 4: Capture traffic destined for machines other than your own\nStep 5: Capture traffic using a remote machine\n\n\nStep 1, ok !\nStep 2 is where i am stuck...\n\nYou will need to make sure the machine on which you're running is configured to support packet capture, e.g. you might need a capture driver installed. The way this is done differs from operating system to operating system.\"\nLinux\nOn Linux, you need to have \"packet socket\" support enabled in your kernel; see the \"Packet socket\" item in the Linux \"Configure.help\" file. Your distribution might enable this by default in the kernel.\"\n\nCould somebody please tell me how I go about having packet socket support enabled please ?\nMany thanks in anticipation\n\nA: The  \"No interface can be used for capturing in this system with the current configuration\" message commonly appears when you don't have the privileges to access the network interfaces for monitoring. Try opening a terminal and running gksudo wireshark. If several network interfaces appear, it's because when you run wireshark without root permissions you don't have the privileges to monitor.\nTo fix that, run the following command in a terminal:\nsudo setcap CAP_NET_RAW,CAP_NET_ADMIN,CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE+eip /usr/bin/dumpcap\na little explanation is available on this other AskUbuntu question\n\nA: Step 2, these days, should list the CapturePrivileges page before the CaptureSupport page, as most OSes have capture support built in by default, so the problem is more likely to be a privileges problem (as jackweirdy notes) than an \"OS needs to be rebuilt or reconfigured to support packet capture\" problem.\nThis includes most if not all Linux distributions; the kernel is almost always, if not always, built with packet socket support these days.  That's the case on all my Ubuntu virtual machines (7.10, 9.10, 10.10, and 12.04), and it's also the case for your system.\nFollow jackwierdy's advice here; your problem is almost certainly a privileges problem.\n(I've just now updated the Wireshark Wiki's CaptureSetup page, so that it lists the CapturePrivileges page before the CaptureSupport page, to encourage people to check the CapturePrivileges page rather than the CaptureSupport page; the latter page is the one from which you were quoting.)\n", "Q: lightdm fail to start automatically after last update I have 12.04 LTS, I don't think I installed anything extraordinary lately, (just uninstalled lxc-docker), but after last automatic update I am left with console. I can do\nservice lightdm start\n\nand everything works fine. I checked upstart jobs, and lightdm is not there until I start it manually. I have followed http://upstart.ubuntu.com/wiki/Debugging and added verbose mode, but no information about lightdm. I also reconfigured lightdm, no change. I checked /var/logs but did not find anything useful in syslog, dmesg..\nMy question is, how to debug the problem?\n\nA: It is a long-standing bug in Ubuntu: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lightdm/+bug/969489\nMost common workaround is to add\nrespawn\n\nin /etc/init/lightdm.conf to ensure it stays up even it fails to start at the first try.\n\nA: Try running sudo update-rc.d lightdm defaults in a terminal; this will ensure that the service is configured to run at startup. It's possible that if you've uninstalled something it has inadvertently disabled this functionality.\n", "Q: Undefined reference to symbol 'FcPatternAddDouble' - issue with building program I'm Ubuntu 13.04 user. I haven't been able to build/install Japanese third-party software for artists called AzDrawing. Based on readme file, I executed make command in proper directory. At first it was going well, but after a while command-line aborted its work and displayed information:\n/usr/bin/ld: src/draw/CFont.o: undefined reference to symbol 'FcPatternAddDouble'\n/usr/bin/ld: note: 'FcPatternAddDouble' is defined in DSO /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libfontconfig.so.1 so try adding it to the linker command line\n/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libfontconfig.so.1: could not read symbols: invalid operation\ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\nmake: *** [azdrawing] Error 1\n\nWhat should I do? I'm Unix beginner, so bear with me.\n\nA: FcPatternAddDouble comes from fontconfig, and if the symbol / function or maybe class is undefined, this is probably because you didn't install libfontconfig1-dev  ? \nThen, retry to build your software. If not found one more time, you can try :\nmake distclean  # removes everything, including Makefile missing fontconfig headers\n./configure # add your options\nmake\nIf this does not solve yor issue, try :\napt-cache search fontconfig\n... and install what could be missing\nLast but not least : try to provide some feedback to the guys providing the software, and dont forget to tell them there is probably an issue with build dependencies ;-)\nHTH\n-- ericb\n", "Q: X11 forwarding via \"ssh -X username@hostname\" is slow, but fast using \"nxclient\" As mentioned, when I do X11 forwarding using basic ssh -X username@hostname it's quite sluggish. But interestingly, when I use nxclient, it's significantly faster.\nI'd rather use ssh instead of nxclient, due to various reasons.\nI've tried turning on compression and setting ciphers, (i.e. ssh -X -C -c blowfish-cbc,arcfour username@hostname) but it's still pretty sluggish.\nWhy is that? How do I speed up ssh X11 forwarding to be up to par with nxclient? \n\nA: The NoMachine NX library is basically a derivative of DXPC.\nIt is stated in wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NX_technology\n \"The NX scheme was derived from that of DXPC – the Differential X Protocol Compressor project\".\nSo while ssh -C -X simply compresses whatever you feed it with (in your case, an X session), NX goes the extra mile to NOT send the 'unchanged' bits of information that it has already sent, thus the 'differential' term. Once what needs to be sent has been decided, nx will actually use ssh (or rather an nx derivative of ssh, nxssh to transmit session information).\nSo there is no way that the ssh -X -C will be as efficient as setting up an nx session. (nxclient is only one end of the deal btw, you will need the corresponding nxserver - i.e you cannot just replace the nxclient with ssh -X).\nEDIT (as per requested):\nAs far as speeding up the ssh, I can only go as far as saying that using compressiong -C generally helps. This is backed up in this question. \nPerhaps one can also consider switching to very lightweight desktop environments, such as xfce or even simpler like fluxbox. Of course this will only help with window drawing operations rather than with speeding up the content in the windows but still. \n", "Q: I don't want to store passwords in an unencrypted file I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on my developer machine and just realized that psql stores passwords in '~/.pgpass'. Furthermore this file is unencrypted. So anyone who has super user rights (i.e. is in group sudo) can access this file and read stored passwords. That's the worst case it could be.\nInstead I'm wondering that psql does not ask for a password (just modified a pg_hba.conf on a postgresql server) and began to doubt about my administration skills.\nThe documentation just tells us how to create the file and how it should look like.. I want to disable this file as soon as possible. But how?\nNO SOLUTION\nThe problem is pgadmin creates this file when I want to store my passwords. It is a GUI and to use a GUI I'm already logged in and mostly the window manager has something like a keyring that is decrypted when I log in. It would be wonderful if pgadmin could use this but as discussed in the answer: it's a feature request for pgadmin.\n\nA: Delete it. .pgpass is just a file. Enter the passwords on the command line if you don't want to store them. psql will never create or modify .pgpass, so you must've set it up yourself.\nIt makes no sense to store .pgpass encrypted; you'd need a password to decrypt it, and the whole point of .pgpass is for automating password logins.\nThe solution here is don't use a .pgpass file if you don't really need the passwordless login and aren't willing to accept the security compromises it imposes. Since it sounds like your .pgpass was created by PgAdmin-III, tell it not to save passwords and it won't create .pgpass. It gave you a big warning the first time you told it to save a password, telling you that it would store the password in clear text, for exactly this reason.\nIf you need strong and secure passwordless logins, use Kerberos / GSSAPI.\nThat said, anyone who has super-user rights can get your passwords no matter what you do. They can capture your typing with a keylogger. They can modify libpq to save the passwords to a file as they're entered. Lots of options. If you don't trust the superuser(s) on your machine, find somewhere else to work from, because you've already lost.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 lts doesnt recognize my 500gb external hard disk Previously i had windows 8 installed and changed back to Ubuntu, i think Ive messed up the hdd drive (freecom 500gb)\n\nA: To clarify, based on your additional comments:\nIf you converted your Ubuntu partion into an NTFS formatted drive, then yes, your Ubuntu installation will no longer work, regardless of whether it was on an external HDD or not.\nIt sounds like you're going to probably need to start over.  Ubuntu would want (by default) an ext4 formatted drive.\n", "Q: How can I use a tv as monitor?

Usually, if I just immediately refresh, the web page will come up. However, recently the DNS failures have been persisting for long periods of time, even across restarts (though eventually, it always starts working again, at least for a while). It happens in Chrome, Firefox, Thunderbird, and Update Manager. When this happens, if I ping a host name like www.google.com, I get an unknown host message, but if I ping an IP address, it works fine.\nI'm also running Windows 7 in a VMWare virtual machine on the Ubuntu host, and if I switch to the VM, I have no problems, even when the host Ubuntu is having DNS failures.\nNote, I'm using a wired ethernet connection.\nThanks for any help.\n\nA: Try this.  Just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal.

It either kills the request or delays it to quite some extent. I have to click refresh sometimes to get the page open. \nI have no idea why this is happening. In windows, my internet works flawless.\n\nA: I just want to clarify some things quickly, I have some experience troubleshooting Chrome on virtualbox. You are using the windows version of chrome inside a windows 7 64 bit virtual machine, correct? I have also had an issue with Chrome reporting that it crashes every time I close it. There is relatively little documentation on using chrome under these circumstances, which is why I switched to firefox under my virtual machines.\nYou have installed guest additions i assume? Have you tried using a different browser to see if the problem is network related?\n\nA: I realize this is a 3 year old question, but I think the issue itself still exists in certain scenarios.\nIn my case, I had this exact same issue (by the sound of if anyway), and I fixed it by disabling IPv6 inside of the VM.  After that, everything was back to normal.\n", "Q: What to do when my keyboard sensitivity decreases but returns to normal after re-log i am having a random problem with both my keyboards. The keyboard will become so INsensitive that I have to press really hard to to make it work. If I restart, or just log out, it resets and it acts normal. That mostly eliminates dirty keyboard issues.\nI use a wireless keyboard on a laptop (HP dv6000, 1.8 GHz AMD 64, 4G RAM, dual monitor, running Xubuntu 12.10). But it also happens on the laptop keyboard. Not however at the exact same time. \nFor instance: I use the wireless keyboard primarily, but when it gets buggy, I can switch over to the laptop keyboard and use it. However, it will ALSO eventually behave in the same manner; not typing the character unless I press really hard (hard enough I'm afraid to break it) and when I re-log, it works normally.\nI assume from this list of mish-mashed info that it most likely is some sort of driver issue; re-logging fix, happens on either keyboard independently. I also \"seem\" to get crash reports when I re-log, but I can't read them or it doesn't give the info I need to see to fix it.\nIt seems to happen mostly on FB, but that's circumstantial; I post to FB most. It has happened while using AbiWord once, and when i was playing a game once or twice. Once it happens, it is system wide, not just in the app/program needing keyboard input. I don't remember it happening in Terminal ever, for whatever that is worth. \nLet me know what to provide to fix this, as it seems to be getting worse.\n[edit] \nUpdate: 06/06/13\nHappened again while playing WoW (in wine).\nI saw this while searching for what keyboard drivers are in use on my system:\nhttp://www.ehow.com/how_6800109_reinstall-ubuntu-using-command-line.html\nSo, following the instructions there, I purged and re-installed Xorg.  Perhaps something there was fouled up and needed re-installing.  However, I found this:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/questions/179801/where-are-laptop-keyboard-drivers-found \nthat shows two places where keyboard drivers could be found.  re-installing Xorg might fix it if the keyboard drivers in use was/is the Xorg one.  But, if it is the kernel-based one, this might not work.  \nAlso, I do not see any processes in use in top or lsmod that match up with any of those suggested there.\n\nA: This happened to me and I eventually worked out that the Slow Keys function (in universal access settings) had been switched on without me realising.

same as on windows Fonts in Firefox and Chromium are still not the same as in Windows FF and Chrome after installing ms fonts.\nI mean the fonts that were missing are now displayed, but they are not the same as on windows.\nThey are too \"wide\" or too \"narrow/high\" and e.g. if they are bold in FF on WIn in Ubuntu's FF they are super fat.\nHow can I improve the displaying of fonts in Ubuntu FF and Chromium? \nI don't mind the wide default font in Ubuntu OS, but in browsers it's not very nice to see it differently as 80 - 90 percent of visitors.\nBacause right now it is not as on Windows.\nI am using 13.04 version of Ubuntu.\nEDIT:\npage: www.bild.de\nIf you look closer you can see the difference (wider and not so high font in Ubuntu):\n\n\nA: Ubuntu and windows use different font rendering techniques. Windows uses ClearType, and Ubuntu uses FreeType. These font renders produce quite different results, FreeType tends to produce fatter/bolder looking fonts and ClearType tends to produce thinner looking fonts.\nAs a web developer there is really nothing you can do about it except make sure the difference doesn't result in clipped text.\n\nA: Sorry, but I don't use Chromium.  But as far as Firefox, to make the fonts look like in Windows, just click on Edit, and then Preferences\n\nAnd then just make sure your font settings look like the images below.\n\n\nHere is what I found, after doing research:\n\nMost websites use \"Cascading Style Sheets\" to set fonts and many other\n  layout features. Well-designed stylesheets will request a series of\n  fonts so that, if one isn't available, an alternative is tried. Not\n  surprisingly, most commercial sites design for Windows and often the\n  developers don't think much, if at all, about how the site might\n  render on other operating systems with the exception, perhaps, of Mac\n  OS X.\nYou can tell Firefox to always use its own fonts in the Content\n  dialog, but a better option is just to install the core fonts package.\n  Often that's all you need.\nThat said, font rendering in Windows will always be slightly different\n  from rendering in Ubuntu or other Linux platforms. Part of that has to\n  do with intellectual property issues. Many commercial fonts are\n  \"hinted\" to improve the display (anti-aliasing issues, for example);\n  Linux often can't follow those hints because it would require the\n  installation of proprietary technologies that require licensing.\nYou can also try installing other browsers like Chrome or Opera or, if\n  you're using Kubuntu, Konqueror or rekonq.\n\nAlso you could try this:\nEdit ~/.font.config and make sure it looks like the following\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?><!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM \"fonts.dtd\">  \n <fontconfig>  \n  <match target=\"font\">  \n  <edit mode=\"assign\" name=\"rgba\">  \n   <const>rgb</const>  \n  </edit>  \n  </match>  \n  <match target=\"font\">  \n  <edit mode=\"assign\" name=\"hinting\">  \n   <bool>true</bool>  \n  </edit>  \n  </match>  \n <match target=\"font\">  \n  <edit mode=\"assign\" name=\"autohint\">  \n   <bool>false</bool>  \n  </edit>  \n  </match>  \n  <match target=\"font\">  \n  <edit mode=\"assign\" name=\"hintstyle\">  \n   <const>hintslight</const>  \n  </edit>  \n  </match>  \n  <match target=\"font\">  \n  <edit mode=\"assign\" name=\"antialias\">  \n   <bool>true</bool>  \n  </edit>  \n  </match>  \n </fontconfig>  \n\nSource:Change Web Browser Fonts in Ubuntu to Look Like Windows\n\nA: You really can't count on every website visitor on every platform with every operating system having a pixel-perfect match in rendering your site. That's not how the world wide web works. \nYou can never know what the user has done with the default font DPI, smoothing/hinting/aliasing, browser zooming, or all the other wonderful things that it's perfectly fine for a user to change on their machine. \nLook at this site: http://browsershots.org/\nDo you know how they make a business out of showing you screenshots of one web page in  dozens of different browser versions on four different operating systems? It's because every one of those might look a little different in some ways than any other one. \nGet used to it. \nIf your layout breaks because the font proportions are a little different on one platform, you're doing web development wrong.  Your job as a web developer isn't to make it look exactly the same everywhere. Your job is to make it functional and visually pleasant for every visitor, regardless of those differences. \nIf you try to force consistency too much, you'll end up with a page that breaks the aesthetic the visitor expects in their operating system or browser of choice. (For what it's worth, I really prefer the Ubuntu look that you're trying to prevent in your example.)\nIf you really want pixel-perfect consistency in defiance of the visitor's expectations and preferences, you can always become a Flash developer! \n\nA: The OP is asking how to control the look of the fonts in the browser of a visitor to the site. I had earlier made some comments which I'm now moving into an answer.\nThe MS fonts for Linux are based on older versions of the fonts and are not the same as the current Windows versions, and it's not Ubuntu's Firefox but Mozilla's Firefox for Linux. (And which version number? Different versions may have differences in the rendering engine.) \nA web designer really has very little control in the end on the fonts and sizes that are displayed in the client. You will end up driving yourself crazy and waste a lot of time if you focus too much on that.\nLook for solutions for cross-browser scripting. There are a lot of good sites and articles online for free and many more even better books if you are able to buy one. Then test on as many different browsers on as many different platforms as you can. \nYour realistic goal is that everything renders reasonably well, doesn't break your layouts, and that your scripts work, not that the pages look exactly the same on different platforms.\n\nA: You can try making changes to /etc/fonts/conf.avail/51-local.conf .\nAdding hinting,antialias, hintstyle might be able to solve the difference of appearance in libre office , firefox , chromium e.t.c.\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM \"fonts.dtd\">\n<fontconfig>    \n\n  <!-- settings go here -->\n\n</fontconfig>\n\n", "Q: My Ubuntu 12.04 LTS system update takes too long My Ubuntu 12.04 LTS system update takes too long (too much time).\nFinally a message comes up stating that there is a problem with Internet connection and updating has failed.\nWhen I examined the Terminal output, the following links has been 404 (link not found, timeout) errors.\nhttp://ppa.launchpad.net..... \n\nprecise/main Sources    \n\nprecise/main amd64 Packages\n\nprecise/main i386 Packages\n\n/crebs/ppa/ubuntu/dists/precise/main/source/Sources  \n\n/crebs/ppa/ubuntu/dists/precise/main/binary-amd64/Packages  \n\n/crebs/ppa/ubuntu/dists/precise/main/binary-i386/Packages  \n\nHow can I remove those links?\nIs there any other solution?\nPlease help me.

For all recent Ubuntu versions, it just seems to ignore preseeded keyboard settings and to always set US layout.

Although the documentation says that editing /etc/default/keyboard is fine, X11 will not use the new layout unless \"/usr/sbin/dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration\" is run.\nFinally, \"/usr/sbin/update-locale LC_TIME=en_GB.UTF-8\" is used to get a 24-hour clock with an en_IE.UTF-8 locale (metric, €, etc., but AM/PM clock). (A European English locale \"en_EU.UTF-8\" would be a nice feature.)\nNeedless to say that this work-around is really ugly, and the installer should be fixed to automatically set the proper keyboard layout.\nSee also https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/console-setup/+bug/1553147/comments/11 .\n\nA: I found one solution but it is not answering exactly my question (preseed every option).

I built the server, installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 32-bit on the 32 GB SSD, turned it on, ran some updates, and everything seems to work normally. Then I tried to add hard drives to the server. I don't want to set up a RAID array per se, for now I just need to connect all of the drives separately so that I can see them separately either in /dev/ or the disk utility. I don't want any pools or backups, or anything like that, just the individual drives themselves. I believe I've seen people on different forums referring to this as \"using your RAID card as a SATA controller\". The problem is that I went to http://www.highpoint-tech.com/USA_new/rr2600_download.htm where there are only drivers for Ubuntu 11.04 (that was the start of the problem) and looked at the installation guide.\nI was hoping, in vain, that there would be no issue between Ubuntu 11.04 drivers and Ubuntu 12.04 drivers, but this was not the case. I went through the instructions in the guide, but it did not work because when I added the drives in the pre-BIOS RAID menu they did not appear to be recognized by Ubuntu. On top of this, I do not entirely understand how to just add drives to the card so that it sees them as individual drives since the pre-BIOS menu is pretty unclear.\nWhere do I get the Ubuntu 12.04 driver (I don't really want to go to Ubuntu 11.04, but I can if I absolutely have to), and how do I properly add the drives in such a way as to not create a RAID, but just treat them as regular drives?\nI saw the post RocketRaid 26xx Driver which seems to be about something similar but for a different RAID card model.\n\nA: The latest versions of the source code and web management tool seem to \"just work\" on Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.5.0-23-generic x86_64), which is wonderful news as far as I'm concerned. Steps are below, but all are trivial.

You can use UNetbootin to create the bootable USB, or Imgburn to create the CD/DVD.\n\n\nOnce done go to you XP machine, and set the BIOS to boot from either the CD/DVD or USB.\n\nA: You can also burn the disk directly from Windows 7. \nRight-click the downloaded ISO file, choose Open with, then Windows Disk Image Burner. \nThis may be the easiest method for you, but one con is that the Win burner does not let you set the burn rate to a low speed.

I can set up a standard ssh keypair using the instructions on GitHub and everything works fine, but when I follow the instructions in the first article I can no longer use ssh to log in.  Instead, I get the error \"Agent admitted failure to sign using the key.\"  I've found a bug (can't post link b/c of low reputation, #328127) that might be related; I'm not being asked for my private key passphrase so the fact that I've modified the private key after creation could be the issue.  Attempting to add the new key manually using ssh-add only results in the error being returned twice.  I'm not sure how to set $SSH_AUTH_SOCK to zero, otherwise I would try that as well.  Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks!\n\nA: Unsetting SSH_AUTH_SOCK is a workaround, but doing so disables ssh-agent, which some people might still want to use.\nIt seems that ssh-agent can't sign anything with the private key because it doesn't properly decrypt it when automatically adding this key to the keyring.\nIf one generates the standard id_rsa identity file in ~/.ssh, or stores a private key along with its public key in ~/.ssh, ssh-agent automatically adds this to its keyring. But when doing so, it doesn't prompt for a passphrase, it doesn't ever decrypt the key.\nThe solution is to add the key manually. Remove all pkcs#8 encrypted keys from the ssh-agent using ssh-add -D and move private+public key files out of ~/.ssh. reboot or ssh-agent -k, then move back your pkcs#8 encrypted PRIVATE key to ~/.ssh. Using ssh-add, one is prompted for the decryption passphrase. ssh-agent can now access the unencrypted private key, and therefore sign stuff with it.\n(via Damon Dransfeld)\n\nA: Sorry for the quick answer, the $SSH_AUTH_SOCK fix worked for me; I found instructions in another bug thread.  In case anyone else is stuck, typing export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=0 fixes the issue.

In BOOT is a single file - boot.sdi. In the EFI directory are another two directories, BOOT and Microsoft. Inside BOOT are two files, bkpbootx64.efi and bootx64.efi. The Microsoft directory has a directory in it named Boot. Inside it are the normal Microsoft EFI files (as far as I can tell).\nThinking there were still GRUB files left, I ran find . -iname \"*grb*\" and find . -iname \"*grub*\" in the UEFI partition, however only found one empty file, bootx64.efi.grb (which I deleted).\nHow is GRUB still installed, and how can I uninstall it?\nI'm pretty new to UEFI and so things may need explained in detail.

How can I remove that?\n\nA: I know this thread is old, but I came across it in my own search when trying to solve this problem for myself, and I found a solution that worked for me when none of the other answers had so I needed to share!\nI had dual-booted Ubuntu on my laptop alongside Windows 10. I decided to remove Ubuntu, and had deleted it's partition, but grub still kept interrupting my boot loader. After trying numerous suggestions left on forums, I finally just came across an insanely simple, and graphical way to remove it on my own lol. (So, disclaimer, I have no idea if any other versions of Windows has this option or not)\nBut all I did was F12 while the computer was booting to get into the boot options. And under Other Options I selected BIOS Setup. On the left-hand side I selected Boot Sequence and right there it listed my different boot options, and I could select them to change their order or remove them or whatever I wanted. All I had to do was make sure only \"ubuntu\" was marked, and then I clicked Delete Boot and exited. It continued to the log-in screen and I restarted my laptop just to double check it solved my problem and it had!\n\nA: I realize you've fixed the problem, but I want to point out what went wrong and how it should be fixed (both by end users and by Ubuntu's developers).\nFirst, Ubuntu's developers have decided -- most unwisely -- to create a GRUB configuration that relies on files in the Ubuntu root (/) partition, as well as on the EFI System Partition (ESP). This makes GRUB vulnerable to removal of or damage to the Linux partition, and therefore makes it difficult to boot the computer after removing Ubuntu or if the Ubuntu installation is damaged in some way. This vulnerability is unnecessary; it is possible to configure GRUB to look for all its support and configuration files on the ESP. If GRUB were configured in this way (as Fedora does), then deleting Ubuntu would not affect GRUB's ability to redirect to Windows. The system would still boot through GRUB, but it would at least still boot. So, shame on Ubuntu for setting GRUB up the wrong way.\nSecond, based on the filenames you mentioned, you seem to have run Ubuntu's Boot Repair tool at some point. This tool automatically renames the Windows boot loader, EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi, and places a copy of GRUB in its place. It does the same thing with the EFI fallback boot loader, EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi, and drops another copy of GRUB in as EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootx64.efi, for reasons that I don't claim to fathom. This is a done as a workaround for a bug in a handful of EFIs. The trouble is that Boot Repair does this by default. On most computers, it is not necessary. When it's subsequently desirable to make changes to the boot configuration, this renaming and replication of GRUB becomes a complication, since users are left guessing about what's going on. So, shame on Boot Repair's developers for being unsubtle about their repairs. (In their defense, though, it would be very difficult for Boot Repair to reliably detect which computers have the bugs that require moving boot files in the way that it does by default.)\nOne more point is important: In a properly-functioning EFI system, a list of boot programs is held in NVRAM. The EFI tries each of the programs in this list in sequence; if one fails or is absent, the next one is tried. When Ubuntu installs, it adds its version of GRUB to the top of the list. Most EFIs also enable users to specify which boot program to use from a built-in boot manager, but this built-in boot manager is crude on most EFIs.\nSum all these factors up, and the simplest solution to the original problem becomes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Undo the Boot Repair tool's changes. This can be done using the Boot Repair tool itself; it has an Advanced Options menu with a check-box called \"Restore EFI Backups\". Use that and the multiple copies of GRUB will be removed and Windows' boot loader will be restored. Alternatively, this can be done manually. Most importantly, the backup of bootmgfw.efi (probably called bkpbootmgfw.efi, although some versions of Boot Repair have used other names) should be copied to EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi on the ESP.\n\n*Delete GRUB in its official/proper location -- EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi for Ubuntu. If Secure Boot was active, deleting EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi would be necessary instead. In fact, deleting the whole EFI/ubuntu directory, or at least renaming it, would do the job in any case.\n\n\nThat's it. With those two things accomplished, the EFI will skip the Ubuntu boot option because it's not longer valid and go on to boot Windows. Some EFIs will also automatically remove the Ubuntu boot option from their boot managers' menus, too, although this practice is not universal.\nNote that in your case, Matthew, I don't recommend doing these things; you've got a working configuration, and as they say, \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" You may have a few stray files left on your ESP, but they aren't doing any harm, so it's best to just leave it alone. I've presented my answer in the hope that somebody else will find it useful.\n\nEDIT: The above was correct when I first wrote it, and the principles remain the same; however, Boot Repair no longer automatically renames the Windows boot loader and replaces it with another copy of GRUB. (Boot Repair can do this optionally, but the option is buried on an advanced options menu, so it's no longer done by default.) This fact makes recovery from this problem easier today than it was in 2013. In most cases, you need only delete the EFI/ubuntu directory on the ESP to make the system boot directly to Windows. If GRUB still appears after you do this, you may have used the Boot Repair option to back up and rename boot files, in which case using it to undo those actions is in order, as noted earlier.\nAnother option is to use the computer's built-in boot manager (usually accessed by hitting a function key, Esc, or Enter soon after you turn on the computer) to bypass GRUB and boot to Windows. You can then use EasyUEFI to adjust the boot order and/or delete the ubuntu entry from the boot list. This action won't delete GRUB from the ESP, but it will bypass GRUB.\n\nA: Okay, so this won't work for every computer I assume, but this is what fixed it for me.\nFirst, I booted to \"System Recovery\" through the BIOS options on my laptop. This allowed me to get into Windows, however whenever I booted after that I got a message saying No partition active for a second before Windows booted. I got rid of this by doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Booting into Windows\n\n*SHIFT + Clicking \"Restart\"\n\n*Troubleshooting\n\n*Advanced\n\n*Command prompt\n\n*Running bootrec.exe /fixmbr\nand rebooting. Now the message no longer appears and everything seems normal.\n\nA: What I did is that after uninstalling Ubuntu -you can do that with some of the uninstallers, or by simply booting into Ubuntu live CD or USB stick and formatting Linux partitions with GParted- I formatted the EFI partition as well (FAT32) and then did Windows boot recovery from Windows installation disk.\nI have to mention i read dozens of advice and tutorials and lost bunch of time with methods that don't work. In the end I did the only thing that seemed logical to me be4 reinstalling windows and it worked like a charm.\n\nA: On a Surface Pro, it is possible to circumvent Grub 2 by selecting the \"Re-install secure boot keys\" option from the UEFI menu.\n", "Q: how to get graphics card memory info? windows and linux shows different value In my Windows 8, video card shows 640 MB of available memory (Screen Resolution > Advanced Settings or with dxdiag).

I'm trying to set up a UEFI boot system, and I've gotten all sorts of wonderful things done, except I can't figure out how to launch the UEFI shell. efibootmgr didn't work for me, so I need to run a bcfg, and to do that I need to launch the UEFI shell. I have the file in the efi partition, but I don't know how to run it. Does anyone here know?\n\nA: Some EFIs' user interfaces provide an option to launch an EFI shell, either built into the firmware or stored on the ESP, typically in the root directory as shellx64.efi. This is far from universal, though, and the details of what the option is called vary from one EFI to another.\nThe way to do this that works most universally is to prepare a USB flash drive with the shell binary stored as EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi. The flash drive must use FAT, and you might need to set the partition type code as for an ESP (to EF00 in gdisk or set the \"boot flag\" in a libparted-based program). When you use the EFI's built-in boot manager to boot from the USB flash drive, the shell will launch.\nMost boot managers provide some means to do the job, too. In GRUB, you'd create an entry for the shell just as you would for other boot loaders. (The GRUB configuration scripts should auto-detect the shell binary if it's in certain locations; or you can create an entry in /etc/grub.d/40_custom to do the job.) rEFIt, rEFInd, and gummiboot will all auto-detect the shell and create an entry for it if it's stored in certain locations. IIRC, shellx64.efi in the root directory of the ESP works for all three of these boot managers.\n\nA: Typically the bios will have an option somewhere to run it, but you should also be able to use use the grub command line ( press c at the grub menu ) and the chainloader command to run it.\n", "Q: VMware installation problem i want to install VMware Workstation 9.0.2 on my computer but I keep getting this and I don't what to do:\n\nPlease enter the user that will initially connect to Workstation\n  Server.

Every time I go online to download something like Adobe flashplayer or Java, it goes into my download folder.  I don't know what to do with it after that.  I can't activate whatever it is I want to download!  Is there an equivalent to an exe file?\n\nA: You may be confusing \"downloading\" something with \"installing\" software.\nMost normal software you would want to install is available in the ubuntu Software Centre which can be easily searched. If you want to install software that isn't in the Software Centre, your best bet is to try to find a \"repository\" from the software developer that is compatible with the version of ubuntu you have installed and add then add it to your system as a location for Software Centre to look.\nWhile ubuntu does have the equivalent of an install file (exe or msi) in Windows, you should use them as a last resort. The file you're looking for is a .deb file and you will need to make sure it's compatible with your ubuntu version and system architecture before you use it.\nThis is really quite a big topic and there's a whole lot more I haven't covered.

I am seeing that I was (if done right) to get a GRUB menu at start you, so I may pick which one I would to start up.\nI would much thankful of your help, also I have no issue with having to flash my hard drive and start from scratch. \n\nA: The ideal thing would be to install Windows first then Ubuntu, allowing Grub to give you the option to choose where you want to boot. but not all is lost, you can still install Grub and it is fairly simple.\nThe first thing you are going to do is boot into your live Ubuntu environment (cd, flash drive).\nThen you are going to install boot repair\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair\n\nOnce you do this you will will click the first button \"Recommended repair\"\nOnce you do this you should be able to restart and remove your bootable image and Grub should be back and you should be able to boot into Windows or Ubuntu.\n\nA: Be aware that, in general, Windows will always overwrite the MBR or GPT equivalent.  Therefore, if at all possible, the recommended method of installing another OS is to install Windows first.\nRegardless, boot-repair will fix the problem.  You can also set up dual boot using the Windows boot manager.\nFrom within Windows, go to Control Panel->System->Advanced System Settings (in the left hand column)->Advanced->Startup and Recovery->Settings.  In the System Startup section, use the pulldown menu to choose the default operating system to boot.  You can also choose the amount of time to display the OS choice list.  Hit OK and then OK again (in the previous window) to save your setup.  Then, when you reboot, Windows should provide you option of booting into Windows or Ubuntu.\nThis, of course, assumes that Windows recognizes the Ubuntu installation.\n\nA: Windows likes to overwrite the grub.  You should always install Windows first and then Ubuntu.  Just reinstall Ubuntu and you should be able to access both operating systems.\n", "Q: how to install ubuntu on my Samsung galaxy s2 How to install ubuntu on my Samsung galaxy s2?\nI do not know if I understood correctly.

Can you get into Safe Mode at all? Mine could not get into normal windows but I was able to at least save my files using safe mode so I would suggest trying that.\nAnd, you can certainly get Ubuntu installed as long as your laptop is able to turn on (just download it onto an empty disk or USB stick and put it in your laptop before it opens).

Ubuntu is a big project that has a lot of community involvement over many different aspects.\nFrom who is in charge - to how decisions are made.\nHow is the work on Ubuntu organized and who organizes it?\n\nA: It's explained at Ubuntu Wiki.\nSummarizing what is there:\nUbuntu is baked by Canonical, so there is a team (that, in fact, are various teams) behind Ubuntu, and as many know, the leader is Mark Shuttleworth. This team decides almost everything about Ubuntu, although they do not do all the work themselves, here is where FOSS takes part in Ubuntu.\nThe community helps constructing Ubuntu, mainly through Launchpad, where people report bugs, release fixes and make the translations, the help is also made by actively participating in individual projects that Ubuntu makes use of, such as a ffmpeg or Nautilus projects.\nGitHub also plays an important role when we are talking about helping projects not just by translating and reporting bugs, but also by being a contributor developer.\nTo decide the steps that Ubuntu will take at each release they promote the Ubuntu Developer Summit that intents to bring together a diverse range of participants and to provide the perfect environment for mutual collaboration and best practice.\nIn order to keep communication for the sake of collaboration Ubuntu uses mailing lists in order to evolve with productivity and accordance.\nTo put all these pieces together and make Ubuntu happen is the work of the Ubuntu Teams.\nSo, this is how Ubuntu works!\n", "Q: How to open a Ruby file in terminal?

If 78 C is the highest you are seeing, you are fine. \nThese netbooks are great, but have limitations. Low-power chips will generate heat, especially if you are doing a lot of intensive things that can add up: having lots of browser tabs open, downloading large files or a lot of small files in a row, watching a lot of YouTube videos in a row without a break, etc. Expect the temperature to go up when more tasks are given to the processor.

Does it work if you use pkexec instead? For example:\npkexec chmod go-w /usr/lib/sudo/sudoers.so\nThis should remove write permissions from \"group\" and \"other\", and leave the \"user\" (owner) permission intact.\nEdit: Whoops, wrote sudo in the command by mistake. Fixed now.\n\nA: There are actually two mechanisms set up in Ubuntu for performing administrative tasks. sudo is one of them, and it and its graphical frontends (like gksu and gksudo) are not going to work until you fix the permissions problem.\nThe other mechanism is PolicyKit. Depending on exactly what you have done to your file permissions, it's likely that you can still recover using PolicyKit to run commands as root.\nThe pkexec command will run any (nongraphical) command as root (provided that the user invoking it is an administrator on the system). pkexec is capable of running graphical commands (like nautilus) as root, too, but this is quite nontrivial, as you have to set up configuration files for them describing how they are supposed to be run and what they are supposed to be allowed to do. Therefore, you're best off using the command-line to fix this problem...at least to the point where sudo works again. (Then you can run gksu nautilus to get a root file browser, if you're more comfortable using that to edit file permissions recursively.)\nI don't know exactly what you did to your permissions, so it's hard for me to give you a specific pkexec command to run, to fix the problem. But you can rectify the specific problem that sudo is currently complaining about. It says:\nsudo: /usr/lib/sudo/sudoers.so must be only be writable by owner\nSo remove group and other write permissions (while not modifying owner write permissions) for that file:\npkexec chmod go-w /usr/lib/sudo/sudoers.so\nThen you can see if sudo works (by running some innocuous command like sudo ls).\nIf you need to perform other operations on file permissions from the command-line with chmod, see man chmod.\n(By the way, here's another, related situation where it's handy to know about pkexec.)\nIf you have trouble getting pkexec to work for this, please feel free to comment here, and I'll try to render further assistance. But you should know that even if this method does not work, you shouldn't have to reinstall Ubuntu.\nInstead, you can fix the problem from an Ubuntu live CD/DVD or live USB system, because the live system will be functioning--sudo will work on it--and you can mount your Ubuntu partition and change the permissions that way.\nOr as a third option (as forestpiskie has suggested), you could use recovery mode.\n", "Q: My 'USB flash' does not have write permission.

It does not allow me to create folder, copy, change permissions in Nautilus (Files).\nWhat's the problem?\n\nA: It is not necessary to format the flash drive or to nuke the partition.\nYou can go to mount and then change the ownership of your flashdrive.\nOn ubuntu :\ncd /media\nsudo chown -R username drivename\n\nOf course replace username by your username and drivename by the name of your flash drive.\nThen you will be able to use nautilus as usual to copy/move/delete your files.\n\nA: Try formatting it into ext4 format, then again format it in FAT. And you can also try the command , sudo rm /media/me/USB/* . Be sure to copy your files before formatting.\n\nA: I had the same problem.

This will give you the permissions if you are using a personal computer\n\nA: With my pen drive: formatting, changing partition type didn't helped.\n/media/user was empty, although nautilus was showing USB as mounted.\nIt helped simple:\nRun disks, click settings of that drive, mounting, disable automounting, identify as: I chosed simply /dev/sdb1 \nclick OK, unmount and mout again.\n\nA: OPTION 1\nDelete All files\nIf you run Disk Management,  and click on the usb drive (SD card in the example below)\n\nClick on the gear symbol (circled in red) and format the drive. this will clear it of all files.\nOPTION 2\nDelete individual files\nif you do not want to delete them all, open terminal with Ctrl + Alt + T and type in the following\nsudo nautilus\n\nThen navigate to your drive and delete should then work as the sudo command before nautilus gives Nautilus root privileges.\nOPTION 3\nIf you still can not access files\nYou should be able to change permissions by\n\n\n*\n\n*mounting it with root nautilus (su then after entering the password, type nautilus) \n\n*then navigate to the drive and transferring permissions to 'guest'.\n\n\nA: I ended up fixing this problem after assuming that the Disks software had set it. I used Disks to format the USB drive into a FAT32 partition.\nI made the mistake of switching the User Session Defaults in Mount Options to off then back on for that drive. That can mess with your distribution.\nI fixed it by going back into Disks and checked for certain that I was using the User Session Defaults first. Then I quick formatted the drive again. Once I remounted the drive with my file manager again it was all cleared up. Everything was back to usual.\nI had initially tried tweeking a bunch of other settings on the system but nothing helped. I never had any problems until I used that switch in Disks. It's obviously not meant to be used on removable media. You have to let your system deal with that.\n\nA: I had the same issue with only being able to write as root.  The only thing that worked for me was to use the Terminal (assuming that \"sdb\" is the name of your drive)\nsudo umount /dev/sdb\nsudo mkdosfs -F 32 -I /dev/sdb\n\nAgain this worked in my situation when all gui solutions were failing, even opening Nautilus as root and changing permissions.\n", "Q: Is there a future replacement for thunderbird Yet? I have been thunderbird user even before was included in default apps. I have never loved Evolution and all alternative at that time were either not mature enough or single accounts.\nRecentely I saw that Mozilla Thunderbird is lagging behind firefox (FF21 TB17) which is not a good sign to me and I thought its time to look for any alterative to start getting used to. I have five accounts and am not willing to use Web interface.\nWhat is alternative that can handle multi account yet with bright future?\n\nA: Version numbers are just numbers\nOne can't say that Google Chrome 27 is ahead of Firefox 21 just by judging from the numbers. Likewise isn't Thunderbird 17 dead if there's a Firefox 21.\nNote that Thunderbird is still maintained and the latest release (17.0.6) was just a few weeks ago (May 14, 2013).\nI do see what you mean though, as up to version 17 (from 5 on) has been in sync with Firefox and Gecko version numbers. Wikipedia on Thunderbird for example:\n\nThunderbird development releases occur in three stages, called Beta, Earlybird and Daily, which correspond to Firefox's Beta, Aurora and Nightly stages. The release dates and Gecko versions are exactly the same as Firefox; for example, Firefox 7 and Thunderbird 7 were both released on September 27, 2011, and were both based on Gecko 7.0.\n\nTo me this is just a convention and version numbers don't necessarily mean anything just from the number.\nAfter 17 will be 24\nAccording to the current state of the Mozilla.org Releases page, the next Thunderbird stable release will be numbered 24 and is planned for release in the week of September 17, 2013.\nThunderbird 23 will be available in the beta channel in the week of June 24, 2013, but won't be released as stable as far as I can see.\n", "Q: Can I change the window-switching animation without CCSM? I want to use the coverflow animation during window switching between applications. I am very reluctant to use Compiz (with CCSM, to be specific) because it makes Ubuntu too slow.\nI don't want any of the other Compiz animations or effects, I'm really only after the coverflow animation.\nIs there any way I can enable this without Compiz? Are there any alternatives?\nI have one other requirement: I need to be able to set the default window position (to center). Compiz/CCSM allows me to set that.\nEDIT\nWell i just realised , i should have put, CCSM! not compiz! i dont want to remove compiz , i just want to NOT MAKE USE OF CCSM!\n\nA: The only alternatives I can think of involve switching compositor.\nBefore I go any further down that route you need to understand that Unity (the desktop environment that default Ubuntu ships with) depends completely on Compiz. If you use another compositor, you need another desktop environment.\nAssuming you want me to continue, what we're actually looking for now is a replacement desktop environment. They're all substantially different to Unity so I can't tell you what you want. I use KDE, lots like Gnome and plenty use XFCE on lower-end hardware. There are many, many choices.\nThis question goes a distance to detail some of them:\n\n\n*\n\n*What kinds of desktop environments and shells are available?\n", "Q: Does placing a symbolic link in the path work the same as creating a symbolic link of an executable in the path? As the title says, I'm about to do an install of an executable. Normally I would either\n\n\n*\n\n*install the executable to somewhere in my path, e.g. $HOME/bin/\n\n*add the directory to the path in ~/.profile (if option 1 wasn't feasible)\n\n\nHowever, instead of option 2, could I simply create a symbolic link to somewhere in my path?\nCheers\n\nA: Creating a symlink of any path will be treated by the system as a directory. So if you have an application path like /usr/share/myapp/myapp.bin and you link /usr/share/myapp into $HOME/bin, the path to be called would be $HOME/bin/myapp/myapp.bin and you would still have to have $HOME/bin/myapp in your $PATH. \nLinking the executable itself could work, but if myapp.bin evaluates its own pathname, that could cause problems too. I would instead create a starter script in your bin like this:\n$HOME/bin/myapp.sh:\n#!/bin/sh\nPATHTOMYAPP=/usr/share/myapp\n$PATHTOMYAPP/myapp.bin \"$@\"\n\nAdd execute permissions to myapp.sh, and now you can call myapp.sh to start myapp.bin\n", "Q: Install extension to all Firefox profiles in my Ubuntu user account? There are 2 Ubuntu user accounts.\nI have about 6-7 Firefox profiles in my Ubuntu user account.\nI want to install an extension into all of them but not into Firefox profiles of the other Ubuntu user account.\nHow do I?\n\nA: Start Firefox with every profile and install the extension...firefox -P  or firefox -ProfileManager\n", "Q: Can I have Ubuntu, Xubuntu and Lubuntu desktop sessions installed without having the applications from the one in the other? When I install multiple sessions next to each other, the default programs from the one also appear in the other. How to prevent this?\nI'm talking about ALL the default applications. I don't need multiple applications (Firefox, Chromium, Konqueror...) for the same task littering the applications menu. So I'd like to hide the default apps from one DE when using another DE which has a different default app.\n\nA: If I understand you correctly, you maybe referring to multiple entries for the same program. Evince would be a good example because it is common to Lubuntu, Ubuntu and Xubuntu.  \nWhat you could do is to go into /usr/share/applications and hunt down \"common\" .desktop files. Sudo edit the \"Name\" lines to make them distinct if you wish or add NoDisplay=True to the end of whichever .desktop file you don't wish to see as an entry.\n\nBased on your comment, it appears that if you're using KDE (for example, since you mentioned Konqueror in the comment), you don't want to see Firefox or Chromium in KDE menus.\nThere are two possible entries you can add to the relevant .desktop file. Use:  \nNotShowIn=KDE;\n\nto prevent an app from being seen in a specific desktop environment, KDE, in this case.  \nOr, you could go the other way and add  \nOnlyShowIn=XFCE;\n\nor\nOnlyShowIn=Unity;\n\nto restrict an app's visibility to a specific desktop environment, XFCE or Unity, for example..\nIn any case, do look at http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/ for detailed information.\nJust to be clear, I don't know of any way to do what you want automatically without the hassle of sudo editing each file.\n", "Q: Litle question about ufw command Hi guys i would like to setup a specific rule for my ufw but i have the problem.\nHow could i type this ?\nfrom ip adress 192.168.1.203 on interface eth0 alow port 80\nI have on local pc ip address 192.168.1.203\nubuntu have 2 nics 1 is eth0 lokal network, eth1 wan.\nUbuntu have installed apache service\nI would like only my pc to access ubuntu on interface eth0 i that i only have access to open web pages from apache on port 80\ni hope you understand me guys :)\n\nA: this command works good:\nufw allow from 192.168.1.203 to 192.168.1.50 port 80 proto tcp\n\n203 local machine, 50 apache\nbut i am finding the way for command to replace 192.168.1.50 with eth0 \nso when i change ip adress on that nic eth0 to rule stay....\n\nA: \nBy default, ufw will apply rules to all available interfaces. To  limit\n         this,  specify  DIRECTION on INTERFACE, where DIRECTION is one of in or\n         out (interface aliases are not supported).  For example, to  allow  all\n         new incoming http connections on eth0, use:\nufw allow in on eth0 to any port 80 proto tcp\n\nfrom http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/raring/en/man8/ufw.8.html\nSo \nsudo ufw allow in on eth0 from 192.168.1.203 to 192.168.1.50 port 80 proto tcp\n\nYou can specify a netmask if you wish, example\n\nufw allow from 192.168.1.0/16\n\n", "Q: how to delete files downloaded in command terminal?

Just edit your browser's proxy settings to IP: localhost Port: 8080 and your traffic is going out over SSH.\nJust remember that all your browser's traffic is going through the proxy until you disable it so don't do anything against network policy while you're logged in.

I noticed today that my linux images were stacking up on the hard drive (Ubuntu Server 12.04).

It's effect is to prevent the most relevant images from being removed automatically through apt.  \nHowever this did not explain the number of images I had filling up my /boot partition. This appears due to each linux-image-*-generic being marked as manual in apt so that you need to use apt-mark auto linux-image-3.2.0-32-generic before it will be identified for removal.\nIs there any simple way to change this behavior so that kernels are only retained by the logic in /etc/kernel/postinst.d/apt-auto-removal?

(The CLI is saying it can't load xdebug, but I've seen this before and should be able to sort it out.  If I can't I'll raise another question).\n\nA: See last edit above.  Basically, Ubuntu needed to install some updates, and once this had happened, php 5.4 was in use.\n\nA: I had the same issue. Adding this:\nLoadFile \"d:/Apache24/php/php-5.6.29/php5ts.dll\"\n\nin httpd.conf\nfixed it for me\n\nA: Since you were using ubuntu, you could've just done an update using aptitude or apt-get. Eitherway, you need to update httpd.conf and make sure that  php5_module points to the place where your new php is.\nLoadModule php5_module modules/libphp5.so\nThe reason why it still points to an older version of php might be due to your computer having multiple copies of php.\n", "Q: dependency problems prevent configuration of linux-headers-virtual I'm running Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS on a virtual box and have run into a little problem.

This answer summarizes the steps leading solution (omitting some dead-ends).\nAt first we needed some information about the system. (It can be retrieved by opening a terminal window and running the given commands at the prompt.):\n\n\n*\n\n*The currently used kernel: uname -r\n\n*The currently installed kernel and header packages: dpkg --list linux-[hi]* | cat\n\n*The current architecture: dpkg --print-architecture\n\n*The free disk space in the system: df -h\n\n*The free inodes in the system: df -i\nThe root of the unmet dependencies problem was the lack of free space/inodes at some time. When installing kernels/headers it is always advised to have at least 150 MB of free space in /lib (or /root if you have used the automatic partitioning method at installation). Also the number of free inodes should not near 100%, because a lot of files are installed along these packages.\nAfter making sure to have enough free space to hold these files we proceeded to install the missing packages by downloading them and using dpkg --install package.deb. (Please note when installing packages by hand you are responsible to fulfil the package dependencies. In this case we could not use apt, simply because the system was in an inconsistent state and it did not work.)\nWe needed to determine which packages were missing. It was hinted in the dependency error messages from the dpkg (apt) command.\nTo fulfil the first dependency:\nlinux-headers-virtual : Depends: linux-headers-3.2.0-44-virtual but it is not installed\n\nThe following package was needed:\n\n\n*\n\n*linux-headers-3.2.0-44-virtual_3.2.0-44.69_amd64.deb\nTo fulfil the second (and further) dependencies: \nlinux-virtual : Depends: linux-image-virtual (= 3.2.0.44.53) but 3.2.0.45.54 is installed\n\nThe following packages were needed:\n\n\n*\n\n*linux-virtual_3.2.0.48.58_amd64.deb\n\n*linux-headers-3.2.0-48-virtual_3.2.0-48.74_amd64.deb\n\n*linux-headers-3.2.0-48_3.2.0-48.74_all.deb\n\n*linux-headers-virtual_3.2.0.48.58_amd64.deb\nLocating the packages was a bit of a quest. But you can retrieve them by using the following method:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open The Linux Kernel Launchpad page. \n\n*Click „All Packages”, \n\n*select „Precise” Distribution series and „linux” or „linux-meta” Source package, then \n\n*select the version you're looking for. \n\n*Click on the appropriate binary package and \n\n*select your package from the list. \n\n*Take a look at the downloadable files. \n\n\nTo install a downloaded package:\n\n\n*\n\n*Save it in a directory, \n\n*cd inside and \n\n*use dpkg --install downloaded_package_name.deb to install the package. \n\n\nMake sure you leave the directory before running dpkg --list queries. \nAfter meeting all the dependencies, you can run\napt-get update && apt-get upgrade\n\nAnd no error messages should appear. There might be new/updated packages since the system was not able to update itself since a while.\n\nA: A much, much simpler solution that doesn't involve manually downloading packages and bypassing package signing, etc:\nsudo apt-get remove linux-headers-virtual linux-virtual  \nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-virtual linux-virtual\nsudo apt-get -f install\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nThe last two steps are optional and just verify the install, and clean up, respectively.\n\nA: Try this.  Just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo dpkg --configure --pending\nsudo apt-get clean\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\n\nA: Just want to say that I am facing the same problem. Nobody mentioned it but isn't this a bug in apt? I mean, if we can force installation of some packages and fix it by hand, shouldn't apt be able to figure this all by itself and do the necessary work?\nI have a small /boot partition and after a while too many kernels installed made the partition go full. I started getting a similar error message, I will not reproduce the information here because they are exactly the same as already reported. \nThe purpose of this message is just to raise the flag on this issue, it is impacting other people and leaving apt in a state where security updates are not being applied when they should. On a server facing the internet this could become a nightmare if a critical security vulnerability is not patched fast enough because apt is broken. \n", "Q: Can not boot 12.04LTS from USB HDD I have installed Ubuntu 12.04LTS on an external USB HDD, and put the bootloader onto the same drive.\nThis is so I can interrupt the boot sequence on the PC and force the system to boot from the external drive when I want to use Ubuntu.\n(and at other times the PC will still boot seamlessly into Windows from the internal HDD for the rest of the family to use).\nWhen I try to boot from the external drive, however, it drops into the \"Grub Rescue\" prompt.\nI have tried several suggestions, including reinstallation, and repairing or reinstalling GRUB from the command line of the live CD.\nNone of these have resolved the problem.\nI have seen several similar postings on various Ubuntu sites, and I wonder if there are technical issues preventing running Ubuntu from an external USB drive in this way?\n(Until recently I had Mandriva, and this worked fine).\nIs it simply that the external USB HDD does not respond quickly enough for the system?\nDoes Ubuntu need to be on the internal HDD?\n\nA: Try live installation instead of full install. There could be some differences in booting via USB. You can try this steps: http://www.pendrivelinux.com/installing-ubuntu-to-a-usb-hard-drive/ but it is a bit obsolete (Ubuntu 7), or to try to divide HDD following this steps: http://www.linuxbsdos.com/2011/05/23/install-ubuntu-11-04-on-external-hard-disk/\nlet us know if something from this options work for you.\nAdditionally, there is similar question to 12.10, which could have the very same resolution: How to run full ubuntu installation from external hard drive? \nBut most probably best steps you can find here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2084736 \nHappy installation!\n\nA: when usb-harddisk resp. usb-stick is newer than bios of your machine allows this, then\nit happens that your usb-device is simply not recognized.\nIn this case bios-update (under windows) is necessary.\nBut you said, you were able to install ubuntu on to an usb-hard-drive ?\nah yes, you simply should set a \"boot-flag\" on to your usb-hard-disk with gparted. try it with an live-system like knoppix.\nI think \"boot\" as flag is missing on your usb-hard-disk.\n", "Q: How do I upgrade the version of phpMyAdmin from 3.3 to 3.5?

Are there any ceveats or things to watch out for? Does Ubuntu install well on the Gateway NE56R31u? Are there any ceveats or things to watch out for? (Given the UEFI/Secureboot/Windows8 hassles...) Thanks.\n\nA: I have heard that there are brightness related problems that affect the Gateway NE56R41u, and I bet it affects your computer too. Boot Ubuntu live and see if the brightness keys work. If you see the bar moving but the brightness isn't changing, then you too are affected by this problem. However, that would be the only thing I would worry about. You shouldn't have any problems booting UEFI though.\n", "Q: How do I remove a pool from ZFS? My Ubuntu 12.04 system has two zpools: rpool (containing the root filesystem) and rdata (containing all other data). rdata was originally 2 x 1TB disks mirrored.\nBecause I couldn't upgrade rdata to 3TB disks (wrong ashift) I had to create a new zpool from the new 3TB disks: initially called datapool. I then rsync'd all the data across, exported rdata, imported datapool as rdata and Bob's your Uncle. I then powered off and removed the old disks. However...\nWhen I powered back on, zpool status shows\n  pool: rdata\n state: UNAVAIL\nstatus: One or more devices could not be used because the label is missing \n    or invalid.  There are insufficient replicas for the pool to continue\nfunctioning.\naction: Destroy and re-create the pool from\n    a backup source.\n   see: http://zfsonlinux.org/msg/ZFS-8000-5E\n  scan: none requested\nconfig:\n\nNAME                                                 STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM\nrdata                                                UNAVAIL      0     0     0         insufficient replicas\n  mirror-0                                           UNAVAIL      0     0     0  insufficient replicas\n    scsi-SATA_WDC_WD10EADS-00_WD-WCAU47275172-part1  UNAVAIL      0     0     0\n    scsi-SATA_WDC_WD10EADS-00_WD-WCAU47283913-part1  UNAVAIL      0     0     0\n\n  pool: rpool\n state: ONLINE\n  scan: scrub repaired 0 in 0h23m with 0 errors on Tue Jun  4 11:33:29 2013\nconfig:\n\nNAME                                 STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM\nrpool                                ONLINE       0     0     0\n  ata-Maxtor_6Y120L0_Y31J3CLE-part2  ONLINE       0     0     0\n\nerrors: No known data errors\n\nAs you can see, zpool status is still showing the old rdata; which is not available.\nzpool import shows\n   pool: rdata\n     id: 7033445233439275442\n  state: ONLINE\n action: The pool can be imported using its name or numeric identifier.\n config:\n\nrdata                                   ONLINE\n  mirror-0                              ONLINE\n    scsi-SATA_ST3000DM001-1CH_W1F1EE1G  ONLINE\n    scsi-SATA_ST3000DM001-1CH_W1F25SE2  ONLINE\n\nThis is the correct rdata\nQuestion: How do I get Ubuntu to forget all about the old zpool?\n\nA: sudo zpool destroy rdata\n\nwill destroy the old pool (you may need -f to force).\nsudo zpool export rdata\n\nwill disconnect the pool.\nsudo zpool import 7033445233439275442\n\nwill import the new pool.

How can you do this?\nOf course, excepting the use of the arrow keys and Del keys: ↑←←←...←→→DelDelDel...Del<new_command>.\n\nA: For example, if you run this command:\nmkdir long_path_here/new_dir\n\nmost likely you'd want to go in the recently created directory. You can do this using next \"shortcuts\":\n\n\n*\n\n*cd Esc. - type cd and after press Esc followed by . (not in the same time). If the previous command has no arguments, you will get the previous command itself.\n\n*cd !* - in this case you will get all arguments from the previuos command.  If the previous command has no arguments, you will get nothing.\n\n*cd Alt+. - type cd and after press Alt and . (in the same time). In fact, using this way and continuing to  press . (without to release Alt), you will get the last argument for every command from history. If a command has no arguments, you will get the command itself.\n\n\nIn general: <command> Esc. or <command> !* or <command> Alt+..\n\nA: To take the nth argument from your previous command, type Alt+n+Alt_.  For example, after:\n$ echo 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\ntyping echo followed by Alt2Alt_ will give you this at the next prompt:\n$ echo 2\n\nThe \"screenshot\" after you've hit Alt2 is:\n(arg: 2) echo\n\nYou can repeat Alt_ multiple times to get the nth argument of previous commands in succession.\nAnother useful idea is to define alias r=\"fc -s\".  Then, you can do command substitutions:\n$ echo 1\n1\n$ r echo=history\nhistory 1\n27755  history 1\n\n\nA: There are a few shortcuts if you want all of the arguments from the previous command, or just the last argument.\n\n\n*\n\n*For all of the arguments: <command> !* \n\n*For just the last argument:\n<command> !$\nExamples:\nls foo/ bar/\nls !* # Gives the results of ls foo/ bar/\n\nls foo/ bar/\nls !$ # Gives the results of ls bar/\n\nIf you want a single argument from a list of arguments from the previous command, you can use <command> !!:<argNumber>\nExample:\nls foo/ bar/ baz/\nls !!:2 # Gives the results of ls bar/\nls foo/ bar/ baz/\nls !!:1 # Gives the results of ls foo/\n\n\nA: Mentioned !* and !$ is a good thing, but when you need to do a little editing readline shortcuts come to help!\nFor instance, instead of the countless ↑←←←...←→→DelDelDel...Del you can just press ↑\nCtrl-a(jump to the start of the line)\nAlt+d(delete to the end of the word)\nFor more info man readline and search for Default key bindings.\n", "Q: Wifi Problems with Intel Centrino Wireless-N 2230 on Ubuntu 12.04 So I have searched high and low and nothing seems to work.

It will be at full speed at times (25MB down / 5.5 MB up) then drop to almost nothing (~2MB down / `0.5MB up) for no reason what so ever.  Usually within 5 minutes of rebooting.\nI have tried everything out there on the web.  I have disabled Wireless N, I have turned off Power Management, I have disabled ipv6, etc etc.  Most changes seem to work initially and then not at all.

To solve it, reboot into BIOS and disable Bluetooth in the Advanced settings (may be different on your model of computer).\nOnce Bluetooth was disabled, my WLAN worked fine.\n", "Q: Disable window decoration for specific applications Is there a way to configure the window manager to disable window decorations (title bar, preferably no borders either) to specific applications (based on the name of the app, title of the window, or anything similar...)?\nI'm using Ubuntu 13.04.\n\nA: If you're using Compiz/Unity, you can do this from the infamous CompizConfig Settings Manager, but it's a bit tricky.  \nThe \"Decoration Match\" key in the Window Decoration plugin specifies the windows that do have decorations. To selectively disable window decorations you have to construct an expression that matches every window except the ones you want to disable.\nFor example, if you want to disable window decorations for windows whose titles end in \"Mozilla Firefox\" or \"Chromium\", you can set the decoration match to:\n(!title=Mozilla Firefox$) & (!title=Chromium$)\nComplete documentation for Compiz window matching is at http://wiki.compiz.org/WindowMatching\n\nA: You can disable/enable you title bar with this code:\n#!/usr/bin/python2\nfrom gtk.gdk import *\n\nw=window_foreign_new((get_default_root_window().property_get(\"_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW\")[2][0])\n\nif w.get_decorations() == 0 :\n    w.set_decorations(DECOR_ALL)\nelse:\n    w.set_decorations(0)\n\nwindow_process_all_updates()\n\nIt comes from this gist.\nThat is based on this post about removing decoration on specific WMs.  \nAs it is mentioned in the article, you can create a shortcut to remove decoration of the windows you are interested in.\n", "Q: \"No screens found\" after apt-get upgrade with Intel video card My Mythbuntu installation (based on Ubuntu 12.04), which has been running without issues for years, suddenly won't start X Windows after doing a simple apt-get upgrade.

Learn more about the xorg-edgers PPA here.\n\nA: I think Intel graphic drivers are installed during OS installation.  \nYour problem in likely that you need the libraries for texture compression installed- they are not installed by default due to copyright issues.  They are needed for nearly all 3D games.  With the libraries missing, I suspect that the game thinks the drivers are not there because the game is looking for S3TC support. Without the libraries, the card will not advertise S3TC support hence the game will crash.\nRunning the following will install the libraries:\nsudo apt-get install libtxc-dxtn-s2tc0\n\nor just search for libtxc-dxtn-s2tc0  in the Software Center.\nThis fix has no risks at all... tested by me several times.\nI hope it will help you....\n...feel free to comment your queries...\n", "Q: How to get windows look on ubuntu? I like the functions of ubuntu. but I prefer the windows look.\nIs there some ubuntu modification that looks like windows?\nUbuntu looks too cartoonish and unprofessional.\nWindows ist more German-like. streight lines, sharp and thin cursors and fonts etc.\nIncluding mouse cursors, fonts and window look?\nI am currently using 13.04 version of Ubuntu.\nIt could be the old fashioned look:\n\nOr aero:\n\n\nA: Here's one way to do it (Windows 7 Aero style):\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/55985/how-to-make-ubuntu-linux-look-like-windows-7/\nThere's a short tutorial with images and installation instructions on the website I linked. If you aren't happy with the theme, the site also tells you how to uninstall.\nHere's another tutorial. It's similar to the one above but longer and more detailed:\nhttp://www.pcworld.com/article/2028896/how-to-make-ubuntu-linux-look-like-windows-7.html\n\nA: I'd use Kubuntu, and customize it. There are themes for gtk, but unity is very . . . unity. KDE has a more traditional layout. If you use it, i'd use the aero mouse theme and vistar7 or something. If you go to the desktop settings, go to e.g. pointer -> get new themes, and then search for anything containing 'vista' or 'seven', I once made KDE look just like Win7, I think I found a windows 7 transformation pack or something.\nOr, if you want a pre-xp look, use Gnome2 or lubuntu with the themes from Gnomelook. I also know a very nice program for Backtrack called LookLikeXP, which is amazing.\nGenerally, I'd suggest looking around at Gnomelook and KdeLook for wonderful themes and stuff.\n", "Q: What is the systemctl equivalent I am converting a package from .rpm to .deb using this tutorial. However, to test and debug the application I need to run it. The programs readme explains to run it as a service with:\nsystemctl enable progname.service\nsystemctl start progname.service\n\nWhat is the equivalent on ubuntu for these commands?\n\nA: systemctl is the control utility for systemd:\nhttp://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemctl.html\nNote that Ubuntu doesn't use systemd, it uses upstart, which does a few of the same things in principle, but has some different concepts.\nWithout much knowledge about systemd, and based on what I read in the document I posted, I think you don't need to \"enable\" a service. Just dropping the .conf file for your service in /etc/init should make upstart aware of it.\nThat's the crux of the matter, though: the systemd config file for your service won't work unmodified on Ubuntu, you have to \"translate\" that to an equivalent version for Upstart. Here's documentation for upstart:\nhttp://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/\nOnce you have a suitable upstart .conf file, you can start a service (equivalent, I think, to systemctl start) using:\nstart your-service\n\n\nA: Default package on 14.04 is systemd-services that doesn't provides the systemdctl command.\nRead\nYou must read the article How To Install And Test Systemd On Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr And Ubuntu 12.04 Precise Pangolin if you want to use systemd.\nPitti PPA\nThere is a PPA ppa:pitti/systemd that provide the adequate package for LTS 12.04, 14.04 and upcoming.\n\nA: Ubuntu is currently planning/developing to use systemd in the future. See following links for info: Vivid will switch to booting with systemd... and Release notes: Boot and service management\nI am using 14.04.\nYou can use the more native command update-rc.d. Check the man page.\nEnabling a service with defaults (see man page):\nsudo update-rc.d foo_service defaults\n\nDisabling a service:\nsudo update-rc.d foo_service remove\n\nNote that in order to remove without error message the foo_service file must not be present. However you can force:\nsudo update-rc.d -f foo_service remove\n\n", "Q: How to apply 3rd party themes? I was looking for a dark theme to install and came across this page.

I've never installed themes before so I'm a bit lost.\n\nA: After it has installed, you can install something like Ubuntu Tweak to change your theme using these commands:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:tualatrix/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak\n\nAfter installation, open Ubuntu Tweak, then select the Tweaks Menu, then select the Theme Menu.

Hitting 8 causes my window to maximize I have no idea what I've done, but this morning, I think I might have fat-fingered the keyboard and now whenever I type a lower case i a no sign pops up (circle with diagonal slash).\nUnusually enough, a capital I doesn't invoke this. And lastly, half the time when I do hit a lower case i, ether the i doesn't end up getting typed, or the following letter doesn't get typed.\nWith all the i's in this post, you can image it took me a while to type this. \nOh great, as I was typing this, I found out that typing 8 or asterisk (*) causes the window to maximize. What did I do wrong?\n\nA: So it appears that this was due to a faulty keyboard. I had a new Dell laptop keyboard sent in and I replaced it. It came with everything except the ribbon cable connecting the motherboard to the keyboard control circuit (there are several ribbon cables on they keyboard itself connecting to a single control circuit).\nAfter using this it appears that the old keyboard was broken. There wasn't anything apparent such as a frayed ribbon wire.  But, with such unusual things occurring this outcome makes sense.\n\nA: Try\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration\n\nThis should give you some options, and potentially a \"test your keyboard layout and we'll tell you what it should be\" sort of input.\n", "Q: How to get touch screen gestures? I have an android tablet that i use to remote control my ubuntu 13.04 netbook, the program i use is team viewer. you ca only control the mouse and it is pretty rubbish like that. \nCan i get some touchscreen gestures?\n\nA: Since TeamViewer is closed-source, it's up to them to add multitouch gesture support.

It uses the mouse to do gestures.\nInstall it by clicking below:\n\n", "Q: What are some of these directories in the Linux kernel src? When I uncompress the Linux kernel source code from Kernel.org, there are many folders. I know what most of them contain and their purpose. However, I cannot figure out or find on the Internet the purpose for the tools, samples, and block directories. What are these three directories and what is their purpose?\n\nA: I have figured out that the block folder contains source code for block-device drivers, samples is example programming, and tools contains tools for interacting with the kernel.\n", "Q: Ignore Warning prior to upgrade? Below is a warning that I got when I attempted to upgrade my ubuntu from 12.04 to 12.10\n\nI wish to upgrade because currently my screen brightness issue isn't resolved and I strongly feel it's due to the absence of a graphics driver (like Intel CedarView, which appears to be a driver meant only for the 32-bit version). The easy way out would be to upgrade but I get a warning as seen above.\nMy Question:\nWould it be safe for me to go ahead with the upgrade or not?\n\nA: It seems your graphics card has a problem with Unity in Ubuntu 12.10. \nYou have a few options:\n\n\n*\n\n*I think the best option boot 12.10 on a live USB and test your hardware. If it works well, upgrade.\n\n*If unity is slow you might need to consider an alternate desktop such as k/x/lubuntu. Again testing before you upgrade is the way to go.\nI also advise you make backups before you upgrade in case you do have a problem.\n", "Q: Install 13.04 to a specific partition I'm trying to install Ubuntu on a machine that already runs Windows 7.\nBefore installing, I shrank the Windows partition and added a new ext2 partition called /dev/sda4 using GParted.\nWhen I rebooted with the installation media inserted and started the installation process, Ubuntu reported \"This hard drive is empty. Do you wish to erase/format(?) it? Then, it gave me a number of options.\nHow do I proceed from this point and install to /dev/sda4?\n\nA: You should use the option something else.

Thus, in this case, you'll have to run without VMware tools installed until VMWare gets their act together and updates VMTools for the 3.5.0-28 kernel level.\nI'd contact Vmware and complain and ask them for an ETA on the change.  \nIt might be they already have a current VMtools update that is available but Vmcenter software might not have been updated yet.

I'm now tired of MS, so decided to give it a fighting chance. I have a Acer Aspire 5750G, Intel Core i7, GeForce GT540M, Nvidia Optimus and 8GB RAM - I would LOVE to know how to install my USB 3.0 Drivers, my Realtek HD Audio, aswell as how to restore my ability to adjust my screen brightness??? My apologies if that is a tall order :-) Like i said, I'm very new, and dont know much of linux, but I'm a quick learner...\nYour help is greatly appreciated!!\nRiaan\n\nA: @Wasabi-RSM Welcome to the Forums! I can only answer one of your questions. For the realtek audio you need to go to their website (  http://www.realtek.com/downloads ) and look for their Linux/Unix driver section and download the one that applies for your system. Once you dl and unzip it there is an executable text file. Run it in terminal when prompted. When that is done restart your computer and it should be working. If you can not run the install script by double clicking it you many need to go into the file menu (hover your mouse at the top left of the desktop) and go to Preferences->Behavior and enable the running of scripts from the desktop.\nAs for your monitor brightness question, there are many threads on here about this and I have never seen one with a definitive answer (one that works in most installs most of the time). Most solutions seem to be very specific to the hardware and software combo. All I can say is I have tried many solutions and I still can not control the brightness of my monitor either, Luckily it is always at max brightness. Long story short, dig around these forums and see if someone with the same/similar laptop has found a solution and start there. Best of luck to you.\n", "Q: I want to change only folder icons from humanity theme.How do i do it?

Which folder should i copy from the faenza icon set to the humanity icon set so that this happens?\nThankyou! :)\n\nA: To change the folder icons in Humanity for those of Faenza you have to copy/paste the Faenza folders Faenza/places/[size] in Humanity/places/[size].\nThe sizes are set in the index.theme file.

I uploaded a Debian package containing the binary files. Since the game is written in Java I used 'any' architecture in the Debian control file.\nNow I have an update ready that should fix some minor bugs and improve the overall quality. The only problem I have is that it requires a native library. There is a version for 32 bit and 64 bit and the application automatically chooses the correct library. It is needed for gamepad support (jinput). If I enter \"any\" as architecture in the control file, it displays a warning as soon as I install the application. Do I need to create two separate Debian packages? And if this is needed, how can I submit this update?\nMy own ideas for this are:\n\n\n*\n\n*I could upload a zip file containing both Debian packages, but I do not want to cause the reviewers extra work. Both packages contain almost the same content, since the 64 bit package also requires the 32 bit native libraries in some cases. \n\n*Maybe there is a way to create a single Debian package that will install on both 64 bit and 32 bit Ubuntu versions without warning?\n\n\nPlease let me know if this is not the correct place to ask this question!\n\nA: The best way to submit for review through MyApps is to submit a tarball or include your packaging source. The reviewers have to un-ar your binary deb and recreate it using the data.tar.gz so in reality submitting a binary deb does create more work. The packaging team will figure out what is needed to make your application build and run properly.\n\nA: I just uploaded an archive containing 2 debian packages. One debian package for the 32bit version and one for the 64bit version. I will post the result later as soon as I get feedback from the reviewers.\n", "Q: WiFi is connected but internet not working?

I'm writing a program that needs to download GPG keys for various distributions to do unattended net installs. To do this securely and in an automated way, I need to download the key via HTTPS, which means \"gpg --recv-keys\" isn't an option. Other distributions (e.g., Fedora) make their keys available on their websites via HTTPS (e.g., https://fedoraproject.org/static/E8E40FDE.txt), but I can't find the Ubuntu key file anywhere on ubuntu.com. Does anyone know where I can get it via HTTPS?\n\nA: The keys are available in the ubuntu-keyring package. So, as with any Ubuntu package, you can download it from Launchpad, which does provide HTTPS (pick a suitable release and download the tarballs or deb files as needed).\n\nAs it happens, you can get GnuPG2 to import the keys over HKPS (HKP with SSL), so it's possible to --recv-keys securely, but the process is a bit annoying. To use HKPS, we need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*tell dirmngr to use an HKPS keyserver\n\n*tell dirmngr where the CA Certificates are \n\n*get the keys via gpg2 instead of gpg - the apt-key command calls gpg, and gpg doesn't seem to support HKPS (at any rate, it tries to execute /usr/lib/gnupg/gpgkeys_hkp which fails with an unsupported protocol error)\n\n*export the key and import it with sudo apt-key add\nHKPS and dirmngr\nIdeally, we're supposed to use gpgconf to set configuration options for dirmngr and gpg2. But gpgconf doesn't understand one option we use, --hkp-cacert for dirmngr. So we might as well do it all manually.\nFirst, let's create a symbolic link to /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt because dirmngr wants a PEM extension:\nln -s /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt ~/.ca-certs.pem\n\nEdit ~/.gnupg/dirmngr.conf (create if necessary) and add these two options to it:\nkeyserver hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com\nhkp-cacert ~/.ca-certs.pem\n\nKill dirmngr if necessary:\npkill dirmngr\n\nImport key with GnuPG2\nWith the dirmngr options set, this is simple:\n$ gpg2 --verbose --recv-keys 0xBA6932366A755776\ngpg: no running Dirmngr - starting '/usr/bin/dirmngr'\ngpg: waiting for the dirmngr to come up ...

I tried to prepend or append the ${PATH} variable, to use DEFAULT only, OVERRIDE only, tried to just set a hard-coded path as a value, all to no avail.\nI'm following the recommendations from the Ubuntu help community, and I want to avoid concatenating hard-coded paths to the PATH inside /etc/environment as it's not the right scope, plus, it will be hard to maintain with no variables.\nOthers may be affected by this issue, as stated here, but no one provided a solution so far.\nHow to make this work?\n\nA: I think that using $PATH variable inside the scope of /etc/environment or ~/.pam_environment does not get resolved, but assigned just as is literally.\nIn fact I see using $PATH or any variable inside ~/.pam_environment being discouraged on most post I read like here: Why doesn't my environment variable get set.\nSo I don't really know why here (Session-wide environment variables) they tell to use $PATH in it.\nI know that Debian removed the parsing of the local ~/.pam_environment as it is a high security risk.\nAnyway for my understanding the two files /etc/environment and ~/.pam_environment use a simpler syntax (simple KEY=VAL pairs for each line) then /etc/security/pam_env.conf (VARIABLE [DEFAULT=[value]] [OVERRIDE=[value]]). So perhaps no reference to variable can be made at all inside them.\n\nA: I have been running into this as well because I was trying to do it the way documentation said (I traditionally use Redhat based systems).\nI think using ${PATH} only works if your path was originally set in the /etc/security/pam_env.conf file.  It appears to me that the original path is set in /etc/login.defs, and then isn't available.\nI dropped back to setting the values in ~/.profile, I have spent too much time debugging this seemingly simple thing. It makes me wonder what other Ubuntu users do, we can't be the first ones who wanted to append to the path variable.  I'm guessing they have done the same, and ignored ~/.pam_environment.\n", "Q: Tor fails to start When i run Vidalia this is first thing appears in picture below\ni also saw this and thisand applied them and they didn't work\nanyone can help please ??\n\n\nA: \nYou better read Log.\nThereafter, use google to get answer, what actually happens. \nIf you still can't start your Tor.

How can I get rid of the long delay?\n\nA: Please note that this fix will make all your secure connections vulnerable to attacks. Only do this if you know what you are doing!\nThe problem is that the citrix client needs a random number to create a secure connection. It asks the random number from your operating system, but the operating system needs three minutes to generate that number. You can shorten this time by using the not-secure random number generator of your system.\nCreate a symlink like this: \nln -sf /dev/urandom /dev/random\n\nSee the 6th post here:\nhttp://forums.citrix.com/thread.jspa?threadID=246296\nI'm utilizing the receiver and this helps out tremendously. I also noticed that it went away after a reboot (Ubuntu install in VMWare Fusion 5). \nI created a shell script: \n/etc/init.d/symlink.sh\n\n#!/bin/bash\nln -sf /dev/urandom /dev/random\n\nI then added the pathe (/etc/init.d/symlink.sh) to /etc/rc.local.\nGood luck. \n", "Q: Not able to execute a .sh file: /bin/bash^M: bad interpreter I wanted to execute a shell script:\n-rwxr-x--x 1 root root   17234 Jun  6 18:31 create_mgw_3shelf_6xIPNI1P.sh\n\nI tried to do a standard procedure, but I got this error:\n./create_mgw_3shelf_6xIPNI1P.sh \nlocalhost 389 -l /opt/fews/sessions/AMGWM19/log/2013-06-06-143637_CLA-0 \nDEBUG   cd/etc/opt/ldapfiles/ldif_in ;\n./create_mgw_3shelf_6xIPNI1P.sh \nlocalhost 389 -l /opt/fews/sessions/AMGWM19/log/2013-06-06-143637_CLA-0\n**ERROR  sh: ./create_mgw_3shelf_6xIPNI1P.sh: /bin/bash^M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory**\n\nWhat does it mean? I was doing this as the root user under the root group.\nDoes it mean that the file does not have the correct permission for the root user?\n\nA: Do vi <your script>.\nthen :set list; it will display any of the special characters in your script.\nthen replace the character:\n:%s/^M//gc           [to type ^M press Ctrl + v + m]\n\nA: As explained in the other answers, this is a format issue. So, the answer is to change the format from DOS to Unix style line endings. This is yet another simple way to fix your file 'in place'\nfromdos file\n\nIt's available in package tofrodos:\nsudo apt-get install tofrodos\n\n\nA: In vim you could also use :set ff=unix and then save the file, or :set ff=dos to get DOS formatting again.\n\nA: You can also use gedit to remove the unwanted characters.\nUnder the File menu select Save As and set the line end type unix/Linux.\n\nA: Your file has DOS/Windows style line endings (CR LF), but on Unix-like systems only the LF control character is used as line break.\nThe additional CR control character is shown encoded as ^M in your output. You can also see it when you run cat -A create_mgw_3shelf_6xIPNI1P.sh.\nTo convert the line endings from DOS/Windows style to Unix style, there's a tool called dos2unix. You install it using:\nsudo apt-get install dos2unix\n\nThen you can simply convert files' line endings in both ways using\ndos2unix FILENAME\nunix2dos FILENAME\n\nIn your case, simply run this command below and the script file will be converted in-place:\ndos2unix create_mgw_3shelf_6xIPNI1P.sh\n\nAfter that Bash should be able to interpret the file correctly.\n\nA: This isn't a permission issue, you aren't getting a message about permissions\n/bin/bash^M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory\n\nThe script indicates that it must be executed by a shell located at /bin/bash^M. There is no such file: it's called /bin/bash.\nThe ^M is a carriage return character. Linux uses the line feed character to mark the end of a line, whereas Windows uses the two-character sequence CR LF. Your file has Windows line endings, which is confusing Linux.\nRemove the spurious CR characters. You can do it with the following command:\nsed -i -e 's/\\r$//' create_mgw_3shelf_6xIPNI1P.sh\n\n\nA: The Problem ist you edit with Dos!\nopen your file with vi\nthen set unix with:\n:set ff=unix\n:wq\n\nand it all fine\n\nA: I had developed the bash script on a Mac, so the first line of the script was\n#!/opt/homebrew/bin/bash\n\nWhen I tried to run it on ubuntu, I got the bad-interpreter issue.

Preferably for a phone that is not supported yet. I'm a newbie to this type of stuff but as a computer engineering student think the learning experience will be very valuable. Are there any resources \"books, online tutorials ...\" available that can get me started? \n\nA: Just posting this as an answer now instead of a comment.\nIf you want to port Ubuntu Touch to a new phone, you can do that with a little bit of work porting to any phone which has CyanogenMod 10.1 already built for it.\nThere is a guide on porting Ubuntu Touch here:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/Porting\nThere is a list of devices which already have ports here:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/Devices\nIf the device does not already have CyanogenMod 10.1, then porting Ubuntu Touch will be a lot harder, as you will have to port CyanogenMod as well.

cd boot-repair_3.193.7.orig\nbash: cd: boot-repair_3.193.7.orig: No such file or directory\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ \n\n\nA: To install boot-repair, follow the instructions here. To summarize, type in this command instead: \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && (boot-repair &)\n\nBoot-repair should automatically install and run. Select \"Recommended Repair\" when prompted. If your system still does not boot after running boot-repair, come back to Ask Ubuntu and start a new question including the boot script link that boot-repair will give you.\n\nA: You are under the /home directory in the terminal, not in the Downloads directory.  Because the file is in the Downloads Directory type cd Downloads to switch the directories.\nBut if you want to install Boot-Repair installing it from the Terminal is a better option.\nSearch for the Terminal in the Dash, then type these 2 commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install boot-repair\n\n\nA: You need to be in the same directory as the file when you run the command tar -zxvf boot-repair_3.193.7.orig.tar.gz .\nYou can autocomplete by pressing tab if you are in the same directory as the file.  I.e., start typing tar xvfz boo and hit tab.  If it's there, it will autocomplete into the full filename (or give the possible completions) and save typing as well. \nAre you sure you need to use make on this at all?  I don't see any source files in the extracted tree. \nYou don't need to follow the same instructions as for aircrack.  You should be able to find ./usr/bin/boot-repair under the boot-repair directory you extracted.   However, it isn't fully installed as it expects.  Given the current situation, I strongly recommend following one of the apt-get answers.\n", "Q: Changing behavior of bash prompt when functioning as root Before you click away, this isn't the typical \"how do I make my bash prompt have color\" question.  I've already customized my bash prompt to look like this:\n[user @ host]----[$(pwd)]\n$ \n\nwhere everything in brackets is light blue, and everything else (including $) is black by adding the following to my ~/.bashrc file\n# Turn the prompt symbol red if the user is root\nif [ $(id -u) -eq 0 ];\nthen # you are root, make the prompt red\n    PS1=\"[\\e[01;34m\\u @ \\h\\e[00m]----[\\e[01;34m$(pwd)\\e[00m]\\n\\e[01;31m#\\e[00m \"\nelse\n    PS1=\"[\\e[01;34m\\u @ \\h\\e[00m]----[\\e[01;34m$(pwd)\\e[00m]\\n$ \"\nfi\n\nThe goal is to make it such that the only thing that changes when I use 'sudo su' is that the black $ changes into a red #.  I've looked in /etc/bash.bashrc and /etc/profile to see if there is just a line to comment out, but there is a bunch of stuff about debian_chroot that I don't understand, and I don't want to screw something up.  How can I accomplish what I want?\nP.S. This is what I want the prompt to look like as root\n[user @ host]----[$(pwd)]\n(red)#\n\nedit: Mark this solved, appending the above code to ~/.bashrc while root accomplished my goal. Also, in the above code, $(pwd) only displays the home directory (I guess because that is the working directory when the terminal is opened), and never updates.  Replacing $(pwd) with \\w fixes this, but displays the home directory as ~, which I was trying to avoid.\n\nA: To change the colour of the prompt to red for root, I modified the .bashrc file, following the examples in this thread.\nregularuser@myubuntubox:~$ sudo su - \nroot@myubuntubox:~# vim .bashrc\n\nThen, in vim, search for the final appearance of PS1 assignment, and add this following it (note that it updates the value of $PS1 so that other previous lines do not need to be modified, and the change is easily revertible):\n# Set RED prompt\nPS1=\"\\[\\e[01;31m\\]$PS1\\[\\e[00m\\]\"\n\n\nA: Following belacqua's valid answer https://askubuntu.com/a/305053/12218, by issuing sudo su the root's  .bashrc is loaded. \nYou can check this by issuing sudo su followed by cd ~ you will see that you are at root's home directory.\nUsing sudo su you log in as root (su = switch user) in contrary with\nsudo do some administrative task as user with elevated privileges.\nSo by using sudo su you become the actual root and the changes made to environment are changes made specifically to root, i.e: sudo su followed by vim .bashrc.\n\nA: It will also depend on how you become the root user. You need to make the change in the root user's .bashrc if you are using something like su - root or sudo -i, where you read in the environment.  \nWith sudo -s, you should be reading your own .bashrc.\nConsider adding some printf or echo statements to debug your code, to tell you when it has executed. \nUse the id command to make sure you are who you think you are:\nroot@tau:~# id\nuid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)\n\n\nA: Following may help\nexport PS1='`[ $(id -u) == \"0\" ] && echo \"#\" || echo \">\"` '\n\nThis will show '> ' for normal user and '# ' for root. This still needs to be in root's .bashrc too.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 doesn't boot from usb So I want to switch from Linux Mint 15 to Ubuntu 12.10. I used UNetBootin to create the usb. I have Linux Mint 15, and am trying to get Ubuntu to load from the usb. But when I restart my computer it says \"Boot Error.\" I haven't tested it on another computer yet. Any ideas?\n-EDIT: What I expected to happen was Ubuntu would boot up instead of giving the \"Boot Error\" message. What I did was just formatting and formatting over and over again due to it saying the same thing(Boot Error). I'm using a Kingston 4GB usb drive. I also tried a 16GB drive but I don't know the name.\n\nA: I've not had good luck with unetbootin recently either. You might try dd from the command:\nsudo dd if=/path/to/file.iso of=/dev/sdb\n\ndd will wipe the 'output file' with great efficiency, so don't mess up and point it at the wrong destination. You'll want to make sure you're target USB is /dev/sbd.\n", "Q: Software Updater window not displaying, though open in 13.04 I have a very interesting problem that has just recently developed.  \nI am routinely getting software updates and I can see the software updater window is available to be displayed on the task bar in unity, but when I click on it I cannot get it to display.\nThe only way that I can get the updates to install is to right click on the task bar icon and advise it to install updates.  I can not bring the update window up to see what I am installing.... :O  (Hope I don't break it!)  ;)\nI have been searching around the forums and have not seen an issue that quite compares - so now I ask my friends on the Web.\nIs there some way I can make this window display?  I feel it is likely a setting in a config file somewhere on the system that I cannot identify.\nSome interesting points to supply:\n\n\n*\n\n*AMD 6 Core processor\n\n*8 gig ram\n\n*Gigabyte board with onboard AMD graphics\n\n*1 terabyte drive\n\n*Dual 1080P monitors\n\n\nNO dual boot to Windows.\nSystem was built and Ubuntu 12.10 was originally installed, with a subsequent upgrade to 13.04\nI recently tried to install the AMD raedon drivers and broke it - so I reversed back and now run the stock driver (Not sure which one).  \nI can't recall if my issue started before this amd issue, or if was going on before that - I think they may be related. \n\n\nA: I am having the same problem on my system.\nFreshly installed Ubuntu 13.04 from scratch, no dual boot, no upgrade from previous version.\nAMD video card, ATI Radeon HD 5700 - using ATI's Catalyst Drivers v 12.9\nMultiple monitors, 2 1080p screens, one 1280x1024\nto get around the issue when there are new updates that it automatically scans for, I right click the icon on the taskbar, quit the software, and then start it again from the unity menu manually and the window will show up.... so it's not that big of a pain there is a workaround.... \nbut I have another Ubuntu 13.04 machine right next to me and that one does show this window.... ( that system was also freshly installed 13.04, but single monitor, AMD Radeon HD 7500, Catalyst 12.9 ).\nI've also noticed on the system that isn't showing the window, no matter what virtual desktop I'm on, clicking the icon doesn't switch desktops to where the window would be located, so I imagine that means the window does not even exist ( if it was perhaps out of my viewscreen coordinates... ).  Other windows that are present on other virtual desktops do what I expect when clicking their icon - they switch the virtual desktop to the one with the active window....\nWhat other information could be pertinent to this issue?\nmaybe related/similar to:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/1003950\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity/+bug/1001067\n\nA: Same problem here, but the window is sometimes hidden, sometimes it is not. Unfortunately there is no obvious reason. One thing in common, I also have an AMD APU with onboard Radeon graphics (AMD Radeon HD7420G = HD7500M/7600M Series)\nAlso I can use the window if I start the Software Updater manually.\n\nA: I'm also having this problem, also with an AMD GPU. My current drivers are fglrx 13.10.10 [May 23 2013]. A workaround is to run Software Updater from Unity.\n2x 1TB drives\n8 GB memory\ndual boot windows 8.1 (each OS has its own physical drive)\nAMD Radeon 5850\nSoftware Updater has appeared in the past, though it seems set on not showing itself right now.  I can interact with the it right clicking on the icon in the dock and choosing update software.  Quitting the updater and opening through Unity fixes the issue.\n", "Q: Do I have to install drivers after an installation? Do I have to install drivers for all of my devices after I install Ubuntu?  Does Ubuntu have generic drivers for most computer equipment (video, audio, network adapters)\n\nA: Ubuntu will install most drivers automatically, and it recognizes quite a bit of hardware. Some of it might require proprietary drivers, though. You have to decide if you're philosophically ok with that.\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install additional drivers?\n", "Q: Windows 7 System Partition When installing windows 7 it creates a small system partition.  Does the Ubuntu install create a partition like this?  Do I need to alter this Windows 7 partition (size) ?\n\nA: Ubuntu will create all the partitions it needs, regardless of whether you decide to dual-boot with Windows 7 or not. The setup program will ask you if you want to dual-boot or simply wipe out Windows and install Ubuntu. If you're especially into all this stuff, you can still control the sizes of the partitions Ubuntu creates.\n", "Q: How do I get the right wireless modules to load at startup for a BCM4322? I have been troubleshooting my HP EliteBook with BCM4322 14e4:432b wireless card.  I am using Linux kernel 3.9 and I have almost found the solution.  Reading on the Linux Wireless site, I found that the b43 and wl drivers should work at least somewhat with the card.  I was unable to get things working using kmod-wl, and so I moved on to working with b43.  I followed the guide here, and got it working using these lines of code:\n\nmodprobe -r b43 bcma\nmodprobe -r brcmsmac bcma\nmodprobe -r wl\nmodprobe b43\n\nWhen I restart the computer, I have to do this again to get things working.  I know I am supposed to blacklist the unwanted modules, but adding brcmsmac and wl to the blacklist.conf file does not seem to work.  How can I get this to work permanently?\n\nA: If the blacklisting does not work then the module might be loaded early in the initframfs. Take a look at the file /etc/initramfs-tools/modules.\nWhat is the content of /etc/modules? Also please post the lines you used to blacklist the modules.\nbr\nUpdate:\nI found the following command on the b43 homepage:\nsudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer\nHave you tried that? \nOn the other hand, if you want to have your module loaded at run-time, add the following line to /etc/modules: \nb43 \nto /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\nblacklist brcmsmac and blacklist wl \nthen reboot the machine.\nThe module should be loaded then.\n", "Q: When I try to install VIM i am getting this error.

It's a pretty frustrating little bug that gets in my way at least 20 times a day, and it's so strange that I would really just like to understand how it could be happening, although I wouldn't mind just fixing it with some kind of keybindings/unity/compiz reset. I just need some pointers on how to achieve this reset. Thanks!\n\nA: In my case, the problem had to do with a conflict between the Desktop Wall plugin and the Grid plugin.

I have Samsung machine with AMD E450 APU with Radeon 2 GB Ram.\n\nA: Use Ubuntu installer :)\nFor your purposes I would go with Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit version. Newer versions are awesome but if your new to Ubuntu and might run into problems, then there will be more information on 12.04 than 12.10 or 13.04 versions. 12.04 is LTS (Long Term Support) release and 64-bit version of it is most likely variant to be run on servers (I suppose).\nIf you want to use it mainly for learning, then also consider running it in Virtualbox. Its easier to restart your project and reinstall Ubuntu if you have messed something up and you can interact with the Virtualbox guest (Ubuntu used for learning) from your host (whatever OS you are using on your PC).

So when you run tar to write a new backup the tape is overwritten from the beginning.\nBefore writing a new backup position the tape at end of the recorded media:\nmt -f /dev/st0 eom\n\nThen next backup will be written after previous one.\nYou can also use /dev/nst0. In this case the tape will not be rewind, so you can write one backup after another without searching for the end of media.\nBefore restoring a backup, position the tape at the one you want:\nmt -f /dev/st0 rewind\nmt -f /dev/st0 fsf <bkp # -1>\n\nWhen you rewind the tape will be positioned at the first backup, so if you want to restore the third one run mt -f /dev/st0 fsf 2 before tar.\n", "Q: Why to explicitly mention filesystem type while mounting? I want to understand the filesystem concepts of linux. I tried my best to collect info from internet before posting here .But I  really got confused when i read lot of sites on internet..What i understood is\n\n\n*\n\n*When an OS(Linux flavor) is installed first time a file system is configured automatically on the hard disk which is nothing but the root file system may be ext.Now there will be an existing directory tree structure .\n\n*Whenver we are booting up,root partition of the hard disk  is mounted automatically to the root file system.(its there in /etc/fstab file).\n\n*When ever we want to view files in a storage device like floppy,usb etc we have to attach the device say /dev/cdrom  to the existing root filesystem tree.command is mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom /mnt/mycdrom\nI assume by default ext file system is there in the harddisk./mnt/mycdrom is a part of the file system tree in the hard disk. Why iso9660 type(standard file system for a CD) is explicitly mentioned here ?\nAlso please suggest me if there any site which can give me a clear picture of entire linux filesystems,partitions,installation ?\n\nA: If I understand correctly, what you're asking in point number 3 is this:\n\nThe Linux partition (and all the files inside it) uses an ext file\n  system, so why do we mention iso9660 when we want to view a cdrom\n  (or ntfs if we want to view a Windows partition for example) when we\n  are actually mounting it on /mnt/mycdrom, which is part of the default ext file\n  system (root partition).\n\nSo here's my answer:\nWe specify the file system while mounting because we want to tell Linux how to read the data in this partition/device. All file systems have a different structure. For example, there's something called a \"cluster\" in a file system, and the size of this cluster is different in the different file systems. Let's briefly explain \"file systems\":\n\n\n*\n\n*In a FAT file system, there are two tables: a FAT (index) table, and a directory table. These tables are the ones that say \"this file is called text.doc, and it starts from this part of the partition, and has a size of this. This other file is called image.jpg, and starts from this... and so on. These \"tables\" are placed in a special static place at the beginning of the partition.\n\n*In an NTFS file system, there are different kinds of tables, using different formats.\n\n*In a CD (file system IOS 9660), there is a specific size of \"unused\" space at the beginning, followed by the data.\nWhat I'm trying to say is that each file system has a different structure.\nNow, in Linux, when you do the command:\nmount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom /mnt/mycdrom\n\nWhat you're telling Linux is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*mount: make the files in this device accessible to me.\n\n*-t iso9660: this device uses the file system iso9660 (so now, Linux will know how to read the files from this device, because you told it it's an iso9660 file system and Linux already knows/supports the file structure of iso9660 and knows where its tables are and all that).\n\n*/dev/cdrom: the device I'm trying to mount; the device I want to access.\n\n*/mnt/mycdrom: the mount point when I want you to mount this device.\n\n\nAnyone, correct me if I'm wrong in the paragraph below.\nSo, this folder (or directory) /mnt/mycdrom is part of the default file system, which is the ext file system (the root partition). The directory itself technically does not have a file system of iso9660, but it's showing me the contents of a device that's using the iso9660 file system; it's acting as the starting point of that file system.\nThe thing about the Unix/Linux file structure is that everything is under one base, which is the root directory /; it's a hierarchical file system structure. Unix/Linux places all partitions and other devices under that root directory, that's why you really can't say that *everything* under that root directory is ext < Correct me if I'm wrong on this last statement too.\n\nFurther reading:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mounting Definition and Mount Point Definition are a very good read to understand mounting.\n\n*General overview of the Linux file system is also a very good guide on...well...a general overview of the Linux file system.\n\n*Filesystems explained is an article that briefly explains the difference between a file system, a partition, and their names.\n\n*Filesystems is also an article about file systems.\n\n", "Q: ChrUbuntu on external hard drive (lsblk not found)? I have a Chromebook (Acer C7 16gb SSD + 2Gb RAM version). I want to get Ubuntu up and running on it using ChrUbuntu. When looking at the instructions on the blog, It says to check what name my external hard drive is under by typing lsblk | grep disk. I just typed it in the terminal in Chrome OS & I just keep getting \"Unknown command lsblk\".\nAnybody know how to get it to work? Please?\nBTW, I am a N00b and I couldn't find anything online about this.\n\nA: From the ChrUbuntu blog it seems that you can only boot from a USB stick or SD card. However I have not encountered this error. Did you type shell after opening a new console tab (ctrl-T) in Chrome? Maybe you're not in developer mode and running a developer kernel (dev channel)? Maybe you need to upgrade to the latest version of Chrome OS.\n\nA: According to the instructions, you can't use the standard entry to the Chrome terminal. You have to be in Developer mode, and you enter the terminal by pressing Ctl+Alt+'->' where '->' is the forward arrow where F2 would be on a PC keyboard. You then log in as chronos, with no password required.\n", "Q: Administrative password not accepted My password works when I log on, and it works when I'm in Terminal and I am accessing Root.\nThe problem is when I try to install a Lexmark S405 printer driver in Terminal I'm asked for the \"Administrative password\" and it will not accept it--says it's wrong. (I double click the installer and choose \"Run in Terminal\")\nI even changed the password with the same results.\nI've tried my user name as well with no luck.\n\nA: The \"Administrative password\" that it's asking for is the root password, which is not set by default. You have two solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can set the root password, and then use that password to install your driver. However, it is best practice to not set a root password unless you really need to, because that opens up lots of other doors that may lead to accidental deletion of stuff and all that, so you should go with solution number 2.\n\n*Open a terminal by Ctrl+Alt+T, and do sudo /path/to/driver. So, let's say you downloaded the driver in your Downloads folder, you would do sudo ~/Downloads/filename. The password that it will ask for is your username's password.\nOn a side note though, what is the extension of this printer driver? Because I wanted to see for myself, so I visited the Lexmark Support & Downloads page for that printer, chose OS = Linux, version = Ubuntu 12.04, and all the files are in .deb format, so these shouldn't ask you to \"Run in terminal\" when you double click them.\n", "Q: How can I access my ubuntu server remotely? I have turned an old pc into an htpc/fileserver and have formatted a couple drives and have made them accessible and am currently able to connect them by typing in smb://10.0.x.xx and then it gives me the available drives on the network. However I am only able to do this if I am on the same connection as the server is there anyway to connect to it remotely? And this is my wanting to portforward, I have dont that, on OS X when you connect to a server it shows the icon on the desktop and I want to know how I can access those on the go.\nThank you \n\nA: with linux you have a million ways to do what you want.\nWhich way you really prefer comes down to what exactly you are trying to achieve - what level of interaction with the server that is.\nIf you want to share shares from these disks through the internet, You primarily need a dynamic dns. So read up on that and check out dyndns.com OR no-ip.com (others exist as well). The service is free and what you get is a fully qualified domain name f.e. myhome.no-ip.org, which resolves to your homes ip address. So you can use this FQDN from anywhere in the world  to access your home server.\nAfterwards (coming to what you seek),\nof you want to have access to your files from your webbrowser, so as to upload/download them (or stream them directly), you need a service like webdav. It is also probably safer to use webdav along with ssh. If I understood correctly you have a Mac so this should help. http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20040920100413622\nIf you just want to download/upload file you also have the option of ftp (or rather the safer derivative sftp). Enable ssh on your server, do the necessary port forward on your router and get filezilla (or other) client on your far end to connect to your server.\nacross permanent networks, f.e. say from your friends houses, you can set up a vpn server on your fileserver, and give intranet access to your friends. Then, you'll be able to see your fileserver from your friend's computers as if the former was part of their home networks...\nThe above are rather universal solutions that can be used from Windows, *nix, linux and Mac OS users. So you find among these options the one that suits you best.\nOf course one should not forget the options of cloud storage. The option of storing non crucial files online, where you can access it from high bandwidth locations is really catchy and should not be overlooked.\nI am sure there are other ways that I overlooked. But I hope This provides a few possible paths.\n", "Q: Can I use Ubuntu in a virtual machine? I am a novice, the computer illiterate.

I am a beginner with Unix generally and with Ubuntu 12.04 particularly. I have got advices to try the system by a command 'Firefox' and then to install a developers tool by a command 'sudo apt-get install gcc'. I have tried to write the command directly to the Ubuntu desktop window; a command line appeared, I have written the command 'Firefox' (without apostrophe characters and pressed Enter key), but it starts no action, though the Firefox browser starts well from an icon left at the desktop window of the newly installed Ubuntu.\n   I see, that about 'sudo apt-get install gcc' with Ubuntu 12.04 problems do exist and are discussed at the http://askubuntu.com . I have written the command 'sudo apt-get install gcc' to the Ubuntu desktop window, too; the system requested my password and made an icon 'Update manager'. I have installed all 211 updates, but the 'Firefox' nor the other command does not work and the 'Update manager' icon disappeared. \n   My Canon MG5150 USB printer does not print as a 'generic printer' from the installation.\nEvidently I need first beginner's manuals how to work with the Ubuntu 12.04 (pressing F1 does nothing) and what are base commands of Unix. And also how to work with the Firefox browser; I have guessed how to set a bookmark but I do not see how to call it. And also how to make FTP connections and how to transfer files to the Windows XP and from it by a net or by an USB flash.\n   Please advise me which manuals, thanks,\n       Tomas Peceny\n\nA: Be careful, Ubuntu and Unix in general are case-sensitive. The command to start Firefox is firefox, not Firefox.\n\nA: As mentioned above the first place should be http://help.ubuntu.com but I would also add that there are free books that can help\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu: Absolute Beginner's guide (PDF for free at top right corned)\n\n*Getting Started with Ubuntu 13.04\n\n*A Complete Beginner's Manual for Ubuntu 10.04\nThat being said, I would try to answer few things\ninstalling all development essential packages for C/C++ command is\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n\nAbout FTP, if you have experience with Filezilla, that is the best that is there AFAIK. Also you can use Nautilus to connect to variety of protocols. \nIf I skipped any of your question you can comment here!\n\nA: You can install gcc from the software center if you prefer to use the GUI. sudo apt-get install PACKAGENAME is a way to install packages on the command line. As a developer, however, you will need to get familiar with the command line.\nTo use the command line, open a terminal window and type commands there. See Using the terminal in the Ubuntu community documentation.\nOn that note, you'll find a lot of “beginner's manuals” as well as guides to more advanced topics on http://help.ubuntu.com/ — it holds both the official Ubuntu documentation (12.04 direct link) and the Community documentation. Use the search box to find the page on a topic (if it exists).\nUnlike Windows, Linux is case-sensitive in most places. A file or a command called Firefox is different from one called firefox. Almost all Linux commands have lowercase names. The name of a command isn't necessarily the name in the window title or in documentation (this goes for Windows too: there's iexplore and “Internet Explorer”, and there's firefox and “Firefox”).\nThe Update Manager icon only appears when there are updates to install. Use the Software Center to install programs.\nAs for your other questions — they're separate topics, and you'll need to do a bit more groundwork in looking up how to do things. If you can't figure things out, you're welcome to ask here, but please tell us what you tried (e.g. “I want to do X, I searched for Y and found page Z but it tells me to use this menu item and I have no such menu item”), and ask one question at a time.\n", "Q: change from ubuntu 12.10 to 12.04 actually I was updating from ubuntu 12.04 to 12.10 suddenly my machine got switched off then when i restarted the machine I am facing the following problems:\n1.

On restarting the system i discovered the directory I was working on  was missing. \nIt was in the Trash folder. I tried to restore it but it  \"could not determine original location of \"myfolder\". \nHow do I restore this item from trash ?\n\nA: You should try restoring again with the external drive plugged in.

This particular issue appears to have been introduced in v6.20.155.1 of the drivers, but is solved in v6.30.223.30, which is the version due to be released with Saucy. Unfortunately, this version of the driver hasn't been backported to Raring, but thankfully the Saucy package is compatible with Raring.\nThe bug report on Launchpad includes instructions for installing the Saucy driver in comment #23.

I'm stumped. I don't have the expertise or the time to work through this diagnostically. I just want a fix.\nShould I settle for an earlier version? If so, which?\n\nA: According to Google, the Dell Inspiron 1150 has 256MB of RAM memory. You don't have enough RAM memory on your laptop to run Ubuntu (which requires at least 768MB RAM) or Xubuntu (which requires at least 512MB RAM), but you can run the lightweight Lubuntu (which requires only 128MB RAM) on your laptop.\nTip: If you can upgrade your RAM memory to 512MB, then you can install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, which is supported by updates until April, 2017, on your laptop.

I tested CPU frequencies with either the Intel tool i7z and turbostat from the linux-tools package (sudo modprobe msr, sudo turbostat) and what I find as maximum frequencies for two different processors is lower as what Intel states as maximum turbo frequency.\nI tested with MrBayes MPI on 4 cores with governors ondemand and performance and the 'turbo' option using indicator-cpufreq.\n\n\n*\n\n*i5-3210M - Intel specifications max. freq.: 2,5GHz - 3,1GHz Turbo\nmax. measured: 2,89GHz\n\n*i5-3470  - Intel specifications: 3,2GHz - 3,6GHz Turbo\nmax. measured:3,39GHz\nI also tried for i in {1..4}; do burnK7 & done in tty1 and turbostat in tty2 and got the same results.\nWhy are the max. Turbo CPU frequency I can measure running Ubuntu lower than the ones Intel states? Where are the \"missing\" 0,21GHz?\n\nA: Actually as you are running all 4 cores, the maximum frequency won't be achieved as specified. Intel specifies maximum turbo frequency for a single running core.\nThere are different maximum frequencies achieved for 1 active core and for 4 active cores (to prevent going over TDP)\nhttp://www.cpu-world.com/CPUs/Core_i5/Intel-Core%20i5-3210M%20(BGA)%20Mobile%20processor.html \ne.g. thus you are getting around 2.9 ghz rather than 3.1\nif you look in i7z there is a line specifying //// max multiplier achieved with 1/2/3/4 core. You cannot go above those multipliers if more than some number of cores are active.\nalso, inactive core need to be in C3 or higher states to allow the active core(s) to get into higher turbo levels. \n\nA: Your BIOS sets these values so you will have to check with your motherboard vendor.

It's great, we think it's the ants pants in our house, it serves media all round the house flawlessly (much more useful and better than our old rig which ran Windows 7). I use Webmin to manage just about everything on it. Big up to Webmin, it's great, but it has limitations (for me and my limited skills).\nHere's the thing. When I am away from home (a lot), I want to be be able to drive the Ubuntu server desktop (is that an oxymoron? maybe I mean Ubuntu server GUI) remotely (I know I should learn command prompt via ssh, but I am stupid and don't have time. ;) Last time I opened the port (22) to SSH, I read the logs and was getting hammered by hacking attempts. So I closed the port on the router.\nOur Internet connection at home is cable and super fast. When I am away from home I use a 3G connection on an iPad retina and a laptop running Windows. Way too slow to get torrents (not to mention expensive for data).\nSo, my question is \"How do I connect to my server remotely with VNC client or something like that and operate it like I am sitting in front of it with the GUI?\"\nWebmin is good, but I want to use a browser on the server remotely and start torrents. So when I get home, everything is done and waiting for me to watch on my DLNA enabled devices at home.\n\nA: Use TeamViewer.\nIt is the best free solution available for Ubuntu.\nBy best I also mean easiest to setup. And by easy to setup, I am not saying that I am 100% sure that no tweaks are required after installing it. But that you don't have worry about network settings or anything like that. Just have it installed on both devices and you can connect to other device and control it as you would be sitting behind it.\n\nA: For management of a server I highly suggest ssh which is a command line tool. The vast majority of server management is editing files, installing software, and starting stopping services, all of which is trivial on the command line.\nFor ssh security, use keys and disable password authentication. See: \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys\nHow to harden an SSH server?\nInstalling a desktop such as Unity adds very little, and VNC servers are commonly cracked. If you must VNC, tunnel it over ssh or use FreeNX with is fast and secure. I am not sure about TeamViewer.\nIn addition, IMO, a large desktop such as Unity adds packages potentially introducing security hole and complicating server management (upgrades).\nIMO the best graphical solution is webmin. Webmin is a graphical interface for server management and is better suited to server management then any of the desktops (unity/gnome/kde/etc).\n\nFor webmin see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/webmin\nhttp://ubuntuserverguide.com/2012/06/how-to-install-webmin-on-ubuntu-server-12-04-lts.html\n\nA: Type in Unity Search: Remote Desktop\nand activate the settings.\nThis allows you to connect remotely to your Ubuntu.\nSee the following article for more details:\nhttp://www.makeuseof.com/tag/ubuntu-remote-desktop-builtin-vnc-compatible-dead-easy/\n", "Q: Touchpad does not work on Acer Aspire V5-121, on I recently installed Ubuntu 13.04 on my new Acer Aspire V5-121 Netbook.

I have 2 computers, one that I use and one for the kids. I want to be able to ssh into their computer to control it (like to shut it down etc) but am curious the best way to do this. We both are in the same house and share the same internet connection.\nWhat would be the best way to do this? From research, I read to install openssh-server on the remote computer but am stumped what to use for the hostname when trying to connect. Usually for VPS's it's the external IP but since we both share a wifi connection would it be the hardware IP? Should we be interfacing directly by LAN or by going through the internet?\n\nA: I use the file ~/.ssh/config which ssh parses automatically, here is an example:\nHost *\nControlMaster auto\nControlPath /tmp/%r@%h:%p\n\nKeepAlive yes \nServerAliveInterval 60\nServerAliveCountMax 10\nControlPersist 1h\n\nHost server1\n        User user1\n        HostName server1-web.example.org\n\nHost server2\n        User user2\n        HostName server2-db.example.org\n        Compression yes\n        IdentityFile /home/user/.ssh/different_key.pem\n\nNote that you can use any (clientside) variable in this file and either set it globally or per server.\n\nA: Run:\navahi-browse -tl _workstation._tcp\n\nTo get a list of Ubuntu workstations in the local network, then you can connect to them by running:\nssh <username>@<computer-name>.local\n\n\nA: *\n\n*You can ssh directly to a local IP provided that your LAN uses static IPs, for example\nssh someuser@192.168.1.2\n\n*You can edit hosts file in both computers, as mentioned by Ed Manet in his answer. That way you can then ssh using computer's hostname, that is ssh someuser@some_hostname\n\n*You can setup a local DNS server to resolve your LAN's hosts. This way you will be able to ssh using the computer's hostname as in option 2 but with additional benefit  the avoidance of editing every hosts file, by pointing your DNS server in Ubuntu's network settings.\nDNSMasq is pretty good DNS server easy to setup.\nAnother option is BIND.\n\nA: Use the local LAN IP address. The alternate approach requires some port to be open to the Internet, to allow you to login.\nAlso, you would need port mapping (on the router). Using your 'public' IP address (on the router) as a target will not connect to either of your two PCs.\n\nThe simplest way is to permanently assign each IP address (for your 2 computers) on the router. Then simply connect to that IP address.\nIf you want to get clever (later), set up a server and start using a local DNS service to assign meaningful names to each device. Not really worth the trouble for only 2 PCs.\n\nA: If you are sharing the same internet connection you are most likely behind the same wifi router.\nSo you connect directly to your kids computer:\nssh <IP-address>\n\nor:\nssh <user-name>@<IP-address>\n\nObviously this works better if the kids computer has static IP address. Otherwise you always need to check what the IP is. Most routers have an option to assign static (always the same) IP to chosen devices. Some routers also have an option to assign host name to certain device - then for any device in the same network address \"kids\" would mean the same. If you assign host names with /etc/hosts file the host name is only known to that computer where that host file is. Also that assumes that kids computer has static IP address.\nYou can set static IP to kids computer also in that machine but I advice setup where network settings are done in the router. One point of control - easier to manage.\nIf something is unclear, leave a comment and I will expand my answer.\n\nA: You can use the IP address to ssh into the kid's computer.\nIf you want to use the computer name, edit your /etc/hosts file to include the computer name.\n192.168.1.104  dad\n192.168.1.105  kids\n\n\nA: Before doing ssh, check for ssh client and server. If you don't have these services, install them with the following commands:\nsudo apt-get install openssh-client\n\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\nIf you have already installed them, just do:\nssh username@ipaddress\n\nand enter the connecting device login password.\n\n*\n\n*Example :\nssh prem@192.168.1.145\n\nprem@192.168.1.145's password:********\n\nIf you get any error like : Permission denied, please try again., please check twice for Username and IP.\n\nA: You can use the IP address in place of a hostname or assign a custom host name in your /etc/hosts file.\nTo get the IP on the kid's computer: on the network menu see \"Connection Information\" or run ifconfig on the commandline (these have to be done on the kid's computer).\nYour wifi router assigns these IP addresses and you should be able to configure it to keep specific IP addresses for the computers they are currently assigned to. (Otherwise the IP's may change from time to time).\n", "Q: automatic lock screen issue My Ubuntu 13.04 does automatic lock screen after X minutes, but the screen is still showing any opened windows.

I am searching for an document or related to Processes Priority levels. \nIn Linux, related documentation does not talk about priority levels or Priority classes. \nIt only provides the range of nice values. \nUser can set any value within that range. Kernel provides min and max limits for priority.\nCurrently “GNOME System Monitor” shows Process Priority names like “ Very High , High , Normal , Low , Very low ” and each one has own nice value range.\nI haven't found any documentation related to these names as such.\nIn 2004, A bug was raised in “GNOME.org” against “GNOME System Monitor”  Bug 131802.\nThe bug  describes that “GNOME System Monitor” should not make references to \"nice.\" nice has confusing semantics, mostly due to lower values being higher priority.\nIn 2011, A The patch adds a priority column in the process table to show the nice value in a human-understandable way, and show it by default. \nI refered the https://bug131802.bugzilla-attachments.gnome.org/attachment.cgi?id=202180\nAnd referd function “get_nice_level()” in the source code for “gnome-system-monitor”. \nBelow is the function template from the same file.\nstatic gchar *\nget_nice_level (gint nice)\n{\n        if (nice < -7)\n                return _(\"(Very High Priority)\");\n        else if (nice < -2)\n                return _(\"(High Priority)\");\n        else if (nice < 3)\n                return _(\"(Normal Priority)\");\n        else if (nice < 7)\n                return _(\"(Low Priority)\");\n        else\n                return _(\"(Very Low Priority)\");\n}\n\nThese are my questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*The values defined by / for GNOME System Monitor, they are that tool specific ?\n\n*Is Gnome System Monitor is actually putting a process to that priority ? Is Kernel also treat that process in that priority which is changed in Gnome System Monitor?\n\n*Is there any where i can find that these are the newly defined priority classes for different priority levels? Is this classes used across all the Distributions.?\nThanks. \nShri Hari.\n\nA: Each process influences kernel's scheduling by its nice value. These values are from a range of -20 (high priority) to +19 (low) priority, with 0 being (default), so regarding function's template and your first question, the answer is no they are not tool specific. \nLinux uses the same priorities for every process. However if you invoke getpriority() system call you will get different values (from 1 to 40), this is done on purpose to avoid returning negative values.\nThere is a very good book you may refer to: Michael Kerrisk's \"The Linux Programming Interface\", published at 2010.\nReferences:\nKernel's scheduler's nice design\n", "Q: Is this normal CPU/Memory usage for a system that runs nothing but Ubuntu as they start up?

The dots stop blinking and stay orange, nothing happens for a while, than the screen thinks \"oh, time to save energy\" and turns off to black because he doesn't get anything new...\nNow I took the HDD with the OS and put it into a computer that I've been working with for quite a while.

Most interesting: the wallpaper is not involved, it's bright and shiny as ever before! Could the problem be with the CPU, that, according to the description, should do some graphics at the same time? Not sure, but with the Memtest throwing loads of errors on the CPU and the graphics not working, it might be a possibility...!\nSuggestions?\nEdit 3: So, the windows XP installation CD I've got here doesn't even try to install anything, it says it found some error and doesn't do anything further.\nConcerning the smeary graphic bugs mentioned above: Just went into the trial mode of Ubuntu from CD, and everything is fine, no problems with that! But the Ubuntu Trialversion bothers me with a lot of \"internal error\"-messages and the question if he should send a message to the support or not. For every single error that occured! \nIs there anybody out there to help me? You could make my day(s) if you help me fix this nasty problem I'm struggling with for some months now! Thanks.\n\nA: So, finally, the problem is solved!\nAs Oli mentioned in the comments-section above, it was a problem referring to UEFI-Boot.\nThe old Installation-CD of Ubuntu 12.04(32-Bit) has no option to install in UEFI-Mode, and the MoBo doesn't give me any option to boot in Legacy-Mode.\nSo what I did now was download the 64-Bit CD-Image and install Ubuntu 13.04 from this one. Now I've got a 64-Bit-Ubuntu running fine on the new machine.\nThe UEFI-bootsystem was also the reason why the computer didn't accept my WinXP-installation (legacy) or would not start the 32-Bit-Version of Ubuntu 12.04 from HDD(legacy).\nIf you have any questions of how, in detail, I resolved the problem, feel free to comment below or send me a message.\nThanks to all who contributed here by giving hints what the problem might be, you set me on a track that brought me to the solution!\n", "Q: Resizing the unity side bar on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS How can we resize the unity side bar on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS?\nI would like to make it as small as possible.\n\nA: This tutorial shows you how to do it, http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/ubuntu-unity-2d-resize-launcher.html.\nThere are 3 files under this directory, /usr/share/unity-2d/shell/*.

What's the easiest way to add Callouts to an image given the capabilities of a default Ubuntu 12.04? \nI've got Gimp 2.6 already present (although I am not suggesting it is present in a default Ubuntu) and I find the instructions for adding a Callout via Gimp to be tedious.  There is something called Gimp Dynamic Text plugin but I've read that it's very old and so unlikely to work in 2.6 and you probably have to compile C files to get it to work; so it could be messy and still may be a bad cost-benefit prospect.\nIf the answer does not involve Gimp, that would be welcome.\n\nA: We can use LibreOffice Draw for adding basic callouts to images and then exporting them in the required format. It's pretty easy and LibreOffice Draw is installed by default on Ubuntu.\nLaunch LibreOffice Draw using Dash (press the Super key) and querying for LibreOffice.\n\nInsert the picture you wish to add the Callouts to. Navigate through Insert Menu → Picture → From File → browse and locate the picture/image.\n\nMake sure that there is a check mark before the Drawing Toolbar. Navigate through View → Toolbars → Drawing.\n\nFind the Callouts Button in the Drawing Toolbar. If you cannot find it, then expand the arrow at the right.\n\nThe different Callouts style available are shown in the image below:\n\nApply the style you wish and then export as png/jpg/gif/any other format of your choice using File Menu → Export.

And it runs totally fine but I would like to know if there is a difference when running xbmc on intel or nvidia ?\nIf yes, how can I run xbmc on nvidia ?! I tried \"optirun xbmc\" but it became sluggish and unusable.\n\nA: If you run: vblank_mode=0 optirun xbmc OR vblank_mode=0 primusrun xbmc How's that?\nvblank_mode=0 is just for the graphic card not to set a default refresh rate on the screen (monitor/tv). It set the best possible refresh rate. It MAY make tearing because it sets the refresh rate higher then your monitor supports.\nFor the \"optirun\" vs \"primusrun\" I found this information:\nPrimus brings better performance and less power consumption when using Bumblebee, by replacing VirtualGL. According to the Bumblebee G+ page, this has the following advantages over the optirun (VirtualGL) solution used by default in Bumblebee:\n- Less overhead (better framerates) and cleaner solution (no networking or compression involved at all)\n- Fixes the \"bug\" that causes Bumblebee to shut down the GPU too early sometimes (no more need for the \"optirun bash\" workaround)\n- Less buggy/glitchy, easier to debug\n- Only uses/starts secondary GPU for OpenGL parts of applications - everything else remains on your main GPU (power savings)\n", "Q: System time keeps resetting to UTC Edit by OP: Yes, the community is correct. The question indeed is a duplicate of this one. I missed it in my search. Thank you for pointing me there.\nI've been noticing a peculiar issue with Ubuntu recently, in that booting to Ubuntu from Windows seems to be messing with the System time.\nEg: I shutdown Windows at 8:35pm, to boot into Ubuntu. When Ubuntu was started up, instead of showing time as 8:35 pm, it showed 3:05 pm momentarily, before setting itself to 8:35pm. If Windows is restarted after this happens, time now becomes 3:05pm (which seems to be UTC time)\nIf Windows alone is restarted (Meaning booting up Windows after shutting down Windows), no time fluctuation occurs. If Ubuntu is started up after Windows is shutdown, the same issue happens. Time seems momentarily UTC, and then corrected within a second or so after startup, to correct time. However the next time Windows is booted up, the time becomes the same as that which was momentarily displayed on Ubuntu. I hope I'm making this clear.\nI've checked that my timezone is correct in Ubuntu. It is set as Asia/Kolkata. I even did a dpkg-reconfigure tzdata, but it was already correct timezone. \nMy timezone is Asia/Kolkata, which is UTC+5.30 hours. The time which appears incorrectly is the correct time if my timezone was UTC. I have a Multiboot with grub2, managing Ubuntu 13.04 and Windows 8. PC is an Acer Aspire V5-121 Netbook purchased two days ago.\nI'd love any help with deciphering this apparently weird mystery.\n\nA: In the past I fixed such issues in dualboot environments by modyfying the following variable in /etc/default/rcS:\n# assume that the BIOS clock is set to UTC time (recommended)\nUTC=no\n\n", "Q: How to monitor a local file for changes, apply a RegEx replace on it and save/overwrite to a destination file?

This and other guides I have read, are either too vague for me or don't make sense to me at all.\nFor example, the guide says \"You will need to have the Ubuntu Core root filesystem in an accessible path.\" and instructs me to type in $ sudo tar zxvf $path_to_root_fs.  As if I should already know the $path_to_root_fs, but I don't. It also skims over the process of downloading and installing the correct kernel as if I should already know how to do this.\nWhat are the steps for installing Ubuntu Core onto an SD card for use on a Pandaboard?\n\nA: Pandaboard's need an OMAP image, so those install instructions aren't what you're looking for.

Others will sometimes post instructions to get an application working. Of course, the less of a userbase your application has, the less odds that someone else has looked at this.\nAlso, try to run the wine app from the command line, wine will very often print out possible clues and errors that you can search the internet for.

I'm running Ubuntu Server 12.04, with a minimal set of packages: The base system, sshd, and an IRC server. I must allow someone else to configure the server to connect to their IRC network. However, they seem to be dropping after two lines of ls or cat.\nOdder, this only happens on this server, and I haven't been able to reproduce it at all using PuTTY or an ssh client. Where should I look to diagnose this? auth.log shows a normal connection and authentication and does not give any details about the drop. fail2ban has no violations with the originating IP address.\nThis is a virtual machine with a forwarded port(it is bridge mode and has normal network connectivity). I can connect locally, across the LAN, and from a remote location with PuTTY without any problems. The other person can connect using ssh on Linux but encounters the connection dropping.\nLogs from client.\nServer-side logs show nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nA: Before you start, make sure that the system time at both ends are synchronized. This helps with the comparison later.\nRun tcpdump at both ends, filtered for TCP port 22. You mention that the client is using PuTTY so I assume Windows. You can get wireshark for Windows and it has a capture capability that you can use in place of tcpdump.\nUsing tcpdump, you would do this with something like: tcpdump -w/tmp/ssh.pcap -s0 -ieth0 port 22. With wireshark on Windows, you can set up a capture filtered for port 22 using the GUI, and then save the capture to disk.\nNow open up both captures with wireshark. Find the point of disconnection. You should be able to see which end initiated the connection shutdown (where does a FIN or RST connection arrive from first?)\nYou can also check to see if a third party host (eg. a router, or an ISP) is interfering with the connection. You'll identify this if you spot a packet arriving that was never sent from the other side, for example. If this is happening, it is likely to be an RST packet.\n\nA: I've experienced weird ssh timeouts and I resolved it using the following:\nsudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time=50 \\\n net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_intvl=10 \\\n net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_probes=5 \n\nNot sure if this will help, but maybe it is worth giving it a try.\n\nA: Hard to tell without a better description of the problem (what does \"dropping\" mean? TCP teardown? TCP RST? Stalled connection?), but one possible interpretation of your description is that there could be a problem with path MTU discovery...\nSSH Frequently Asked Questions : My SSH session hangs part way through logging on, when I generate a lot of output from my shell...\nPMTU (Path MTU) Discovery\n\nA: I had this exact problem connecting to an old 12.04 server from a LTS14.04 (previously upgraded from 12.04)  \nI found that the problem is MTU related as after running \nsudo ip li set mtu 1480 dev eth0\nThe problem goes away.....\nand returns when you set it back to 1500\n(assumes you are on a wired eth0 connection)\n", "Q: Options in bash commands Are the commands' options case sensitive? i.e.\nI did \nrm -r directory\n\nAnd\nrm -R directory\n\nAnd I got the same results, whereas when I did\nls -r directory\n\nand \nls -R directory\n\nI got different answers.\n\nA: This is what man pages are for\nls:\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/raring/man1/ls.1.html\n\n-r, --reverse\n                reverse order while sorting\n-R, --recursive\n                list subdirectories recursively\n\nrm:\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/raring/man1/rm.1.html\n\n-r, -R, --recursive\n                remove directories and their contents recursively\n\nSo with the command rm, -r and -R are the same, but not so with ls\n\nA: Yes, almost everything in Linux is case sensitive.\nFor example, in your ls command,\n   -r, --reverse\n      reverse order while sorting\n\n   -R, --recursive\n      list subdirectories recursively\n\nAlso, like in ln:\n   -s, --symbolic\n      make symbolic links instead of hard links\n\n   -S, --suffix=SUFFIX\n      override the usual backup suffix\n\nHowever, sometimes the upper and lowercase letter options are the same, like in rm:\n   -r, -R, --recursive\n      remove directories and their contents recursively\n\nIt depends on the command. To best find out if upper and lowercase make a difference, always consult the man pages of a command.\n\nA: The cases only matter if there is another argument in the opposite case.  This is usually how it works, so I would keep the case of the argument the same as what command you want\n", "Q: Installing .sty packages with Kile I have recently installed Ubuntu 13.04 on my laptop.

If don't, can I update to 32bits from terminal?\nI don't have any other DVD to put the iso... that's why I am asking!\nI'm using 13.04 Raring Ringtail.\n\nA: You cannot \"update\" from 64bit to 32bit or vise versa, either from terminal or from ISO. \nIn fact, you cannot update from an ISO without making a Live DVD/USB and booting from the live media.\nYou have to do a fresh install. You can making a Live USB (1GB USB will do) and boot from the USB and then install.\n", "Q: IPv6 autoconfig isn't working on 13.04 I have several computers with various operating systems on my LAN, and one of them with Ubuntu 13.04 64 bit, is the only box that can't autoconfigure itself an IPv6 address. rdisc6 times out on it, whereas it succeeds on all my other Linux boxes.

Start by selecting the root with network option. \nDepending on how badly the system update was interrupted, running the following command may finish the update:\napt-get dist-upgrade\n\nIf that commands says that there are no packages to be installed (or complains about broken packages), use these commands one after an other:\napt-get -f install\ndpkg --configure -a\n\nIt is not necessary to run the second command if the first command finishes without any error messages.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.4.2 Server, after installation black screen with _ on the left top (3 times the same) (no GRUB) hi i have problem with ubuntu server 12.4.2 64bit on IBM server 366 series 4x Xenon 64bit 16GB ram, after installation first time with grub in bootloader screen i cant change anything and after 15 minutes run black screan, nest installation there is the same black screen but load system i have installed ubuntu graphic terminal and ssh and after few minutes system stop and after restart black screen and nothing for 1h, third installation after all instalation proces i chose to not install grub and after all process i see only black screen with left top screan ticking _, any suggestions ?, i tried to install 32 bit system and working fine but cant install 64bit java on it and thats why i need 64bit system, and yes all 4 processors are 64bit Xenon 3,16 Ghz 800mhz fsb ht, 2x Hdd 73gb 10k hotswap sas server raid 8i, 16GB ram, integrated graphic card.

I would choose performance over graphics any day.\nThanks in advance. \n\nA: If you care about performance over graphics and you're new to Ubuntu and Linux, go with Lubuntu 12.04 LTS.  It will be more stable for you, and you'll find yourself troubleshooting issues far less.  You can get a little better performance from Lubuntu 13.04 because of the newer kernel and updated packages, but if you're new to Linux it probably isn't worth it.  That's my two cents, although I'm sure if you ask 10 people you'll get 10 different answers.\nDefinitely don't go with 10.04 for reasons already mentioned (it's EOL).  Also, it's WAY behind in kernel and package updates.\n\nA: Ubuntu 10.04 is no longer supported. If you want a long term solution, install 12.04. Ubuntu may work fine on your computer, but a more light lightweight flavor of Ubuntu like Xubuntu or Lubuntu would probably operate faster and smoother on your machine. They were created with PCs with lower end hardware in mind.\n\nA: I have tried a lot of flavors, and the absolute best I have come upon performance-wise, and appearance wise (in my opinion) is Xubuntu. Actually, I had installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and then installed the XFCE desktop environment, but installing Xubuntu directly would be a lot more straightforward.

Anyway, my question is this: will that file install the full Ubuntu on my flash drive only, or on my hard drive? Thanks a bunch in advance!\n\nA: That file will present you options for where you want to install it.  When you get to that point, make sure you select to install it on the thumb drive and leave the MBP's hard drive alone.  Probably the MBP's hard drive will show up as sda, but make sure the size numbers add up.\nWhen Ubuntu asks you if you want it to write to the master boot record of the primary drive, DO NOT SAY YES.  \nI would suspect however, that Ubuntu is already installed on the thumb drive and that Install Ubuntu file just wasn't deleted since you didn't install Ubuntu through \"traditional\" methods.

All of windows is still on the drive, along with the files, but I really want to use Windows again. All I need to know is how to convert back to NTFS without losing windows. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: Despite what some other people are suggesting, formatting a partition generally doesn't erase all the data on it. However it doesn't exactly keep them either. It wipes the file table that records what files are stored on the partition and where. Generally the data for all the files will be there, but as you start using the partition it will get overwritten with new files. You are unlikely to be able to go back to NTFS and have all the files, directory structure etc exactly as it was before. You are unlikely to be able to get Windows to boot properly without reinstalling it. You should be able to recover most of the files using a file recovery tool such as TestDisk or PhotoRec, but there is no garauntee.\nhttp://www.cgsecurity.org\n\nA: I'm sorry to say it, but I believe you formatted your C: to EXT4, which erases all data on it. Like psusi said, there is no way to \"convert\" NTFS to EXT4 - you must be getting mixed up with formatting. Again, if this is true, all data has been lost. Be more careful next time; it even warns you!\nCITATION:\nConvert filesystem NTFS -> EXT4?\n\nA: Use TestDisk (http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk) to undelete the files. Save the recovered files to an external drive. Then, reformat EXT4 to NTFS. Lastly, move the files from the external drive to the new NTFS filesystem.\n", "Q: bash: File not found It's all on the screenshot below\n\n\nA: You are trying to run 32 bit application on hybrid 64/32 bit system without basic 32 bit libraries.

Many song titles, artists, and albums are completely wrong. I'm wondering if there's an way I can fix the properties automatically, like windows media player allows with it's album database comparison thing.\n\nA: You can use MusicBrainz Picard to rewrite tags of your music library.\nIt should help you to reconstruct the messed up tags by downloading them from the MusicBrainz library.\nIf you have the title on the file name, you can start by generating tags from file names (Tools -> Generate tags from file name). Then, with this as a starting point, you can use Picard to look up on the MusicBrainz library the other tags.\nOr, if you not even have the correct file name you can use the acoustic fingerprint function, enabling it from the options (see here). In practice it analyzes the song and automatically (should) recognize which song it is.\n", "Q: The analog of Krusader I'm using Krusader as a file manager, however it sometimes works too slow and that's why I'm looking for another one which is lighter and quicker.

It should be noted that when I type:\nlsmod|grep nvidia\n\nI get an output of:\nnvidia       11309139 0\n\nI can still see the screen, as stated in my other question, and I can still interact with folders on my desktop and open terminal.

Just follow the prompts and it will offer an option to disable it automatically. After this type sudo shutdown -r now to restart the computer. Follow the above steps again and it should now be installed.\nHowever\nYour resolution will now probably be completely tiny due to it now being in power save mode. To fix this, perform the following:\ncd to xorg.conf file:\ncd /etc/X11\nEditing the xorg.conf file\nsudo gedit xorg.conf\nYou should now have something open with something like this:\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier     \"Monitor0\"\n    VendorName     \"Unknown\"\n    ModelName      \"Unknown\"\n    HorizSync       28.0 - 33.0\n    VertRefresh     43.0 - 72.0\n    Option         \"DPMS\"\nEndSection\n\nback up this file and then you will now need to edit it\nGet you monitor files\nsudo apt-get install hwinfo\nsudo hwinfo --monitor\n\nTake not of the attributes that show and then enter them into your xorg.conf file.\nYou want to remoce the power saving option \"DPMS\" and update the HorizSync and VertRefresh to your monitors settings.\nMy Monitor section looked like the following:\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier     \"Monitor0\"\n    VendorName     \"Unknown\"\n    ModelName      \"Unknown\"\n    HorizSync       28.0 - 72.0\n    VertRefresh     43.0 - 60.0\nEndSection\n\nSuch a pain just to install a Nvidia driver considering Windows just uses a simple installation program and its done.\n", "Q: Configuring open fire server in ubuntu I have installed open fire 3.8.1 in my system.

Several approaches have been used to work around this in the past, but the best one right now is probably to use a shell function instead of a separate script, since a shell function will run within your original shell instead of a separate process.\nThis would be done in your ~/.profile:\ncdprompt()\n{\n    cd $(zenity --entry --entry-text=\"input directory name\")\n}\n\nIf you then start a new shell and run cdprompt, it should show the zenity prompt and change to the directory you enter as expected.\nIf you really want the commands to live in a separate file, another option is to source the file instead of running it:\nsource newdir.sh\n\nor\n. newdir.sh\n\nThis tells bash to run the commands in the file within your current process rather than starting a new one.

This question may or may not be very stupid, as I am kind of ignorant when it comes to computers.  My friend has convinced me to switch to Linux, and I'm trying to figure out how I can game on it.\n\nA: Any game? No.\nFrom the native Linux client you can only play the games that have Linux releases. In my case this is 86/182 games. Those that are there work well but if you're curious about any one game, go to its Steam page and that should tell you if it has a Linux release or not.\nFor the others you can install the Windows version of Steam under Wine. This is a compatibility layer which will allow you to play most things. Sometimes with some kicking and screaming, sometimes not at all.\nEdit: Linux games in my library has gone from 86/182 to 129/230 in the 6 months since I wrote this. There are many more out there that I don't yet own.\n\nA: If you download Steam, and install it, and log into your Steam account, you can play any Linux-compatible games on Ubuntu.\nThere are games that are Linux-compatible, and you will be restrained to playing those. \nYou also only be able to play games that you buy or are free, but I am assuming you already know that.\nThere are many games on steam that won't work on Linux, but also there are many that will. \nYou can browse Linux-compatible steam games here: http://store.steampowered.com/browse/linux/\n", "Q: Administrator Privelege I just recently installed lubuntu in virtual box and when i tried to install virtual box guest additions, it says that it requires administrative priveleges.

However, these have been removed from Ubuntu 13.04 for various reasons.\nSo, in order to run Disk Usage Analyzer as root, here are two methods:\nMethod 1\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal, Ctrl+Alt+T. Type sudo apt-get install gksu, this will install gksu and gksudo.\n\n*To run Disk Usage Analyzer as root, do the following command:\ngksudo baobab\nMethod 2\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal, Ctrl+Alt+T. Type sudo -i. This will log you in as root in the terminal.\n\n*Run Disk Usage Analyzer by typing:\nbaobab\nIn both cases, don't close the terminal until you are done, because closing the terminal will also close Disk Usage Analyzer.\nFurther to your problem, you can use the command df -h to show you the sizes of your partitions and see how much space is available.\n\nA: baobab Disk Usage Analyzer GUI, and ncdu GUI-like command-line tool\nTested on Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04.\nRunning the Disk Usage Analyzer as root can be done from the terminal simply with this:\nsudo baobab\n\nAdditionally, you can use a command-line tool which works very well, called ncdu. It's very intuitive and easy to use. Once it's running, use the arrow keys to navigate around your file system and drill down into folders of interest which show large disk usage. This is a command-line tool, but GUI-like in its nature. Run it with:\nsudo ncdu\n\nsudo may not even be required for it. For a help menu while in ncdu, press Shift + ?.\nNote that I believe ncdu stands for \"ncurses Disk Usage\", where ncurses is the library or tool that makes an interactive, graphics-like interface possible in the terminal.\nncdu is a truly wonderful, fast, and very easy-to-use tool. I love it can easily be used over ssh sessions too. It is my \"go-to\" tool whenever I need to quickly analyze disk space usage, whether on my local machine or remoted into another machine.\nThe baobab Disk Usage Analyzer GUI tool is my secondary tool. I use it only rarely when I need to see more insight all at once, rather than drilling down manually into large folders with ncdu.\nOther, related tools\n\n*\n\n*To quickly see your disk and partition usage, run:\ndf -h\n\nLook especially for the row where the far right column, which is the \"Mounted on\" column, has just a / in it. This is your root directory. You'll be able to quickly see how much disk space overall is used and available in your root dir. To quickly focus on and highlight just this line, run:\ndf -h | grep -B 1000 -A 1000 '.*/$'\n\n\n\n*To quickly see individual file and folder usage for just the one folder you are in now, run:\ndu -h\n\nTo see just the last line, which is the sum-total of everything in your current folder, run:\ndu -sh\n\nThe -s says to 's'ummarize, which means to just output the last line.

Unfortunately these legacy drivers (version 12.6) have not been updated.\nSo if you want to install these drivers, you have to downgrade to xorg 1.12.

Thanks!\n\nA: Use command substitution:\n$ myvar=$(pwd)\n$ echo $myvar\n/etc\n$ echo $(pwd)\n/etc\n\n\nA: Providing functions as parameters is not intended and will soon get tricky or ugly. The only way I know is via the eval function. Nykakins approach isn't passing a function, but a value, as you can see in this comparing example:\n#!/bin/bash\n#\n# Test providing a function as parameter\n#\nfunction f {\n  param=$1\n  echo \"-----------------------\"\n  date +%T_%N\n  sleep 0.3\n  echo $param\n  date +%T_%N\n}\n\nfunction e {\n  param=\"$1\"\n  echo \"-----------------------\"\n  date +%T_%N\n  sleep 0.3\n  eval $param\n  date +%T_%N\n}\n\nf $(date +%T_%N) \ne \"date +%T_%N\"\n\nThe first style evaluates the function 'date' before passing it's result to the client function f, as you can see, because the second time is before the third:\n-----------------------\n14:00:12_983387321\n14:00:12_980980238\n14:00:13_287779378\n-----------------------\n14:00:13_290126185\n14:00:13_594301594\n14:00:13_596408013\n\nThe second block shows, that the passed over function is evaluated between the two date-calls in the e-function. \nMaybe you hadn't that strict naming convention in mind, when asking for a function as variable, but I would say that this makes the difference between a function as variable and the result of a function as variable.\n\nA: Bash doesn't implement it but otherwise what you are precisely asking for, i.e. use variables exactly as functions, is very simple to implement with ksh93 discipline functions, eg:\n#!/bin/ksh93\n\nfunction pwd.get\n{\n    .sh.value=$(pwd)\n}\n\ncd /var/tmp\necho $pwd\ncd /tmp\necho $pwd\n\nWhen executed, the previous script shows:\n/var/tmp\n/tmp \n\n", "Q: How can I determine the page count of odt, doc, docx and other office documents from the CLI?

Can anyone tell me what difference between the two following commands:\nsudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends xubuntu-desktop\n\nand\nsudo apt-get install xfce\n\n\nA: Both are metapackages but xubuntu-desktop is a metapackage for much more stuff than the other one that is just for the desktop environment, xorg and few minor things.\nYou can read about the difference between a package and a metapackage here.\nIn short metapackage does not contain anything else than references and what matters is what metapackage refers to (metapackage claims to depend on them and asks that list to be installed).\nSo I guess your first option would not install anything. If you really want the minimal solution then go with xfce for which the correct command would be:\nsudo apt-get install xfce4\n\nJust add anything else one by one according to your needs. Also if you have xfce4 installed you can always expand your install with xubuntu-desktop that would just add lots of stuff.\nYou could also consider using Webmin or Zentyal for web based server management.\n\nA: First, sudo apt-get install xfce returns:\nE: Unable to locate package xfce\n\nIf you run apt-cache search xfce you'll get a longish list that includes \nxfce4 - Meta-package for the Xfce Lightweight Desktop Environment\n\nand\nxfdesktop4 - xfce desktop background, icons and root menu manager\n\nI suspect you may want either xfce4 or xfdesktop4 instead of xubuntu-desktop.\nNext, you can look at the description for both xfce4 and xfdesktop4 using:\napt-cache show xfce4\n\nand\napt-cache show xfdesktop4\n\nI'm pasting part of the output for apt-cache show xfce4 below:\n\nDescription-en: Meta-package for the Xfce Lightweight Desktop Environment\n   Xfce is a lightweight desktop environment for unix-like operating systems.\n   It aims to be fast and lightweight, while still being visually appealing and\n   easy to use.

It doesn't work with the error:\nError: Can't open display: (null)\n\nIs there a way around this. I realise that seeing as the program is called xclip it may not be possible.\n\nA: Bash itself does not have a clipboard. It's a X feature. xclip is just a command line interface and as you see, it requires $DISPLAY. A way around is to just use a temporary file (for eg created with tempfile):\n$ echo 123 > /tmp/fileDy7Dgv\n$ tr -d '2' < /tmp/fileDy7Dgv\n13\n\n\nA: The clipboard is provided by the X server. It doesn't matter whether the server is headless or not, what matters is that your local graphical session is available to programs running on the remote machine. Thanks to X's network-transparent design, this is possible.\nI assume that you're connecting to the remote server with SSH from a machine running Linux. Make sure that X11 forwarding is enabled both in the client configuration and in the server configuration. In the client configuration, you need to have the line ForwardX11 yes in ~/.ssh/config to have it on by default, or pass the option -X to the ssh command just for that session. In the server configuration, you need to have the line X11Forwarding yes in /etc/ssh/sshd_config (it is present by default on Ubuntu).\nTo check whether X11 forwarding is enabled, look at the value of the DISPLAY environment variable: echo $DISPLAY. You should see a value like localhost:10 (applications running on the remote machine are told to connect to a display running on the same machine, but that display connection is in fact forwarded by SSH to your client-side display). Note that if DISPLAY isn't set, it's no use setting it manually: the environment variable is always set correctly if the forwarding is in place. If you need to diagnose SSH connection issues, pass the option -vvv to ssh to get a detailed trace of what's happening.\nIf you're connecting through some other means, you may or may not be able to achieve X11 forwarding. If your client is running Windows, PuTTY supports X11 forwarding; you'll have to run an X server on the Windows machine such as Xming.\n", "Q: How do I convert my Blackberry contacts to a standard format?

Is there something like them for Ubuntu 13.04? I'm looking for an app that will list all my current installed apps, let me uninstall one and seek out related leftover files.\n\nA: This comes down to the way you install the software.\nIf you install the software through a package manager (Debian package management system in Ubuntu), removing the software through the package manager will most likely be enough to clean up. Please note that with APT (a frontend to dpkg, which in turn is the base of the Debian package management system), to remove the software and it's configuration, you need to purge it, not remove it.\nWhen installing software with make install, it's recommended to use checkinstall instead. See the Ubuntu wiki page about checkinstall for more information. You can then remove the software using dpkg or the GUI of your choice (e.g. Synaptic).\n\nA: apt-get purge works well from Terminal works well for me.\nAs the man apt-get page says:\nremove - Packages installed are removed (Does NOT include configuration files)\npurge - Purge is identical to remove except that packages are removed and purged. Purge meaning that any configuration files are deleted too.\nPlease note: The package management never touches any files in a user's home folder so the files there will stay even if you purge a package.\n\nA: Ubuntu Tweak comes with a \"Janitor\" utility to clean some system garbage.

Let's say I have a two monitor setup.\nI open Firefox on display #1. If I hover my mouse to select a menu item on display #1, the global menu will show. But if I hover the mouse to select a menu item on display #2 nothing will show, unless I move the Firefox window to the second display. But then the global menu will not show on display #1.\nCan I make the global menu show on all displays, no matter on which display the application is visble?\nPlease note that I do not want to disable the auto-hide feature.\nEdit: Adding a reason on why I need this:\nOne of the reasons I ask for this, is because I regularly connect my laptop to my TV Set and watch movies (I use VLC). So, most of the times I want to access the menu of VLC without the need of interrupting the playback.\nAnd even if I did interrupt the playback, VLC's playlist can be undocked from the main window, and become a window on its own.\nSo I always keep the playlist on the laptop display, and the movie on full screen on the TV display. And even if the playlist is the active window, since VLC's main window is on the TV display, the menu would only show on the TV display, and not on the laptop.\n\nA: No, you can't (only if someone will make an application/program to do so or if you select Mirror displays in System settings > Hardware > Displays). The thing you're asking is inconsistent. \nThink that you have one application (Firefox) opened on the display #1 and another one (let say Chromium) on the display #2. Now, you look at the display #2, so you use Chromium and you will see in global menu the menu for Chromium. What reason do you have now to see in global menu the menu for Firefox that is displayed on display #1? And vice versa.

I am currently logged in on my Linux system and i want to output my Linux password and username on my terminal, what commands i need to write and in which file it is stored and how i can retrieve it ?\n\nA: The passwords are not stored anywhere on the system at all. What is stored in /etc/shadow are so called hashes of the passwords.\nA hash of some text is created by performing a so called one way function on the text (password), thus creating a string to check against. By design it is \"impossible\" (computationally infeasible) to reverse that process.\nWhat can be done is to try a \"brute force\" attack - by hashing a lot of possible passwords until the outcome equals the found hash. There is no other way, you cannot compute a text (=password) that matches the hash you have.\nThere are several algorithms to create hashes, they differ in complexity, length of the hash, probability/possibility of so called collisions (two different texts have the same hash, which eventually must happen if the hash is shorter than the original text).\nTypical current algorithms are\n\n\n*\n\n*MD5 \n\n*SHA-1 (also called SHA)\n\n\nboth should not be used for cryptographic/security purposes any more!!\n\n\n*\n\n*SHA-256\n\n*SHA-512\n\n*SHA-3 (KECCAK was announced the winner in the competition for a new federal approved hash algorithm in October 2012) - not used in Ubuntu yet.\n\n\nA: As you know from other answers you can't see your password. Let me explain why. Design where passwords are stored in their normal form (it's called plain) isn't very secure (not only for operating systems) because if list of such passwords falls into hands of malicious person, he can log in instantly, since list of user names is usually easy to retrieve (in Linux from /etc/passwd file). That's why hash functions are used instead. These are one-way functions - you can create hash based on value but you can't create value based on hash. If malicious person gets a list of hash values he can't retrieve actual passwords from them (or at least it's more difficult) and user still can login - when he passes his password, it's translated to hash and compared with stored value.\nOnce in a while you can heard that someone hacked some website and get passwords or that some list of passwords leaked somewhere. If those were stored in plain text, attacker got instant access to some accounts. If those were hashed he had to break them first. It means more trouble for him and more time for reaction like changing a password to a new one. Linux (and any Unix based system) follows this design and that's why you can't print your password in any other way that hashed - only if you have root user privileges and can read /etc/shadow file.\nTo print your username, type whoami.\n\nA: In short: you can't find out what your password is. \nAlthough it's stored in the file /etc/shadow, it's stored in a \"protected\" format called a hash. It's like a baked cake is to a set of ingredients, there's no way to get the flour back out of the cake.\n", "Q: How can I make vim ignore the global config?

And if yes, how? I know that Android apps are developed in Java because running all applications in a virtual machine grants less compatibility issues. IOS instead uses objective-C because it is developed to run just on few devises (IPhones series). How can the ubuntu touch apps be cross compatible being developed in C++? Is there a compatibility level which cannot be crossed or anything similar?\n\nA: It depends on the kind of app being developed.\nIf you use the Ubuntu SDK and QML, your app isn't compiled but instead is interpreted by the Qt runtime.  This means that your app will be able to run anywhere that Qt5 is available.  And since it's not compiled, you don't need to worry about the physical device's CPU Architecture at all.\nBecause Ubuntu is the base system for all of these devices, and because of work that has gone into projects like Linaro, we can offer apps the same runtime environment across multiple ARM devices, which means you don't need to compile C++ apps for specific devices, just for Ubuntu.  If you have clean C++ code, you can compile the same source for arm, x86 and x86_64.\n\nA: Ubuntu Phone apps (except HTML5 apps) are developed using the Qt toolkit and the Ubuntu SDK. As a result, they are easily portable to other platforms (where Qt is supported).\nJavascript and QML are used for the GUI, so that's even less hassle.\nSource: http://www.ubuntu.com/phone/app-ecosystem\n", "Q: rsyslogd and system log output weird or normal? currently I have this non-stop output in system log:\n[   89.115236] FW REJECT (input): IN=eth0 OUT= MAC=ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:00:23:5e:6f:ab:d9:08:00 SRC=10.158.0.1 DST=255.255.255.255 LEN=389 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=255 ID=51601 PROTO=UDP SPT=67 DPT=68 LEN=369\n\nIs this normal or is there somebody behind ASA in Alabama trying to sniff at mine eth0 ?\nWhen I activate ipkungfu --panic\nthen it disappears after a while, but when ipkungfu --panic is switched off, then\nit comes back ... ???\nwho is that ? how can I find out more ?\n\nA: From that syslog line I can tell you the host 10.158.0.1 (SRC=10.158.0.1) is broadcasting (DST=255.255.255.255) a UDP packet (PROTO=UDP) from port 67 (SPT=67) to port (DPT=68).\nPort 67/UDP and 68/UDP are used by DHCP server client respectively.\nThis is the expected behavior if the ASA firewall is a DHCP server.

It seems that the generated file by the tool i just ran is generating a bad/unusable file:\n\n*If I run the \"sudo nvidia-xconfig\" command again, I wont get an error the second time.

I tried the same with Ubuntu but I can't get the applet to run. Here is the recommended driver from from the NVIDIA Applet for my card for Win7 (I hope this shines some light on the specifics of the card):\nQuadro/NVS/Tesla/GRID Desktop Driver Release R319\nVersion: 320.00 WHQL\nRelease Date: 3.5.2013\n5) Also I went on the NVIDIA driver search and looked through every possible combination of product type + product series + product to find all the combinations that yield a 1000M card. My card is:\nProduct Type: Quadro\nProduct Series: Quadro Series (Notebooks)\nProduct: 1000M\n********************************************EDIT #2**************************************\nAdditional Symptoms\nAnother question that generated more symptoms I previously didn't mention was:\n\"After generating xorg.conf by nvidia-xconfig, go to additional drivers, do you see nvidia-304?\"\n1) I took a screen shot of the \"additional drivers\" right after generating xorg.conf by nvidia-xconfig. Here it is:\n\n2) Then I did a reboot. Now Ubuntu is 600 x 800 resolution. When I logged in after the computer came up I got an error (which I always get after generating xorg.conf by nvidia-xconfig and rebooting)\n\n3) To finally answer the question - No. There is no \"NVIDIA-304\" driver. Screen shot of additional drivers after generating xorg.conf by nvidia-xconfig and rebooting :\n\nAt this point I revert to the original xorg.conf and delete the xorg.conf generated by Nvidia.\n\nA: I kept at this problem for a very long time (minimum 150 hours in effort over 14 months). Everything I tried didn't fly; and I tried so many things. \nI even hired a programmer to complete this process because it looks so promising:  http://sagark.org/optimal-ubuntu-graphics-setup-for-thinkpads/    However, we were not able to do it successfully - maybe you will have better luck.\nHowever I WAS able to make the second monitor work on my Lenovo W520 laptop with the NVIDIA Quadro 1000m card. all I did was install 14.04 and I finally got my second monitor. \nNothing I tried in 12.04 or 12.10 or 13.10 worked for me. The closest was 13.10 with a refresh rate of once every 5 seconds on the second monitor. Avoid this huge headache and just install 14.04 - as it works out of the box!!!\nMy advice is if you have a lenovo w520 with Quadro 1000m, just install 14.04 and everything works.\nIf for some reason you must have 12.04, then don't let my experience discourage you, just keep in mind I am completely new to Linux. There are lots of people with W520's and 12.04 with multiple screens - it's just that I was not able to replicate their feats.\nGood Luck \n\nA: interesting graphics card. it has the same architecture like mine GT 540 M and\nis designed too with optimus resp.

I've been trying to follow the instructions here to get netscape 2 to run on Ubuntu 13.04. I created a file called \"netscape2.conf\" to /etc/modeprobe.d and put this in it:\nalias binfmt-0064 binfmt_aout\n\nThen I downloaded the tarball they provided and extracted that in the root directory. Finally I downladed netscape 2 and extracted it. However, when I try to run it as a normal user it just spits out \"killed\" to the terminal. If I use sudo to run it then it says\n./netscape: can't find library 'libm.so.4'\n\nOk so I explicitly add the paths to the $PATH variable using export and try again. Same problem. What am I doing wrong? Is it still possible to run this ancient browser on modern Ubuntu?\n\nEDIT\nOk thanks to Paul I've got past that error message. In /etc/ld.so.conf.d I created a file called netscape2.conf and put the lib directories in it like so:\n/usr/i486-linuxaout/lib\n/usr/i486-linux-libc5/lib\n\nI then did ldconfig to update the libraries as suggested. The next error was because XkeysymDB wasn't found. It told me to fix this I just had to set the $XKEYSYMDB variable, which I did.

Try sudo ldconfig to refresh the library cache.\n(In general, it's not safe to unpack random tarballs from the internet in your root directory. In this case, JWZ is very experienced and his blog post says that he tested it, so it will probably be fine, but be very careful about doing this in the future.)\n", "Q: QT4/5 Creator cannot find -lGL I installed the ubuntu mobile SDK a while ago on my ubuntu 13.04 machine via http://developer.ubuntu.com/get-started/\nAfter a few days there appeared a compiler/linker error - even when compiling the standard GUI project for QT:\ncannot find -lGL\ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\n\nA non QT c++ hello world project compiles and pretends to start (it says in the ide starting) but it never says \"Hello World\" or even quits.\nAlso the QT-Creator suddenly had a weird bug.

Even if you set the linux entry as the first boot device in the NVRAM when installing it, next time you manage to boot Windows 8 again it will place itself first, thus precluding you from booting into linux since there is no boot device selection menu to choose from.\nIt would be helpful if you could post a complaint to the Federal Trade Commission or a Consumer Protection agency in your area.\nThere are other people reporting this problem with the E series.\n", "Q: How do I get wifi to work?

You could possibly find a su binary and just add it to /usr/bin/su. But you would need to add all the dependencies from scratch.\nYou could follow the advice here and use a chroot environment with a liveCD to reinstall libc6.\nI think your best bet, unless you want to spend hours scraping together tar files, is to reinstall your system and hope that you have current backups.\nThere is a post on serverfault about this problem. But unless you have a lot of time on your hands I would just reinstall.\n\nA: As mentioned in the other answer, reinstalling is the best solution I found. Meanwhile, I tried following steps (with no success) that might worth to be mentioned:\n\n\n*\n\n*Grub boot loader automatically started after the second restart, but crashed while loading. So, the missing packages didn't even allowed to boot in recovery mode.\n\n*I used a bootable usb to start Ubuntu (without installation). Then I tried to copy missing packages from an identical system, but it did not help at all. I gave up somewhere in between and didn't copy all the files. \n\n*Mounting the hard drive and installing packages on it, using the bootable usb was not doable either, because the missing libraries did not allow me even to get root access over the hard drive.\nSo, the final solution that I found was to make backups of /etc, /opt, /root, /var, and /home and reinstall a new Ubuntu by erasing the previous version. Later the /etc folder helped me a lot to bring back some of tricky settings. \n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04: \"Failed to fetch..\" when running update. Is this package important?

The zpool status indicated that it was UNAVAILABLE.\nI put a similar capacity drive in, and I managed to allocate it as a new spare that was INUSE and resilvered the drive. But, it wasn't actually part of the zpool, rather the pool had a memory of the missing drive, thinking it would someday appear again.\nThe solution was to first drop the missing drive from the zpool:\n[root@hactar ~]# zpool detach hactar_data /dev/gptid/87410b00-adb0-11e6-9193-00241d738094  \n\nThen, drop the drive marked spare-1 INUSE also:\n[root@hactar ~]# zpool detach hactar_data /dev/gptid/f2089b59-2654-11e5-8d99-00241d738094\n\nOnce I did this, it looks like FreeNAS figured it out without me having to do a replace command, however if your system doesn't figure it out itself, the following command should replace one device with the other:\nzpool replace {your_poolname} {drive to be replaced} {new drive to take its place}\n\nFor example:\nzpool replace hactar_data /dev/gptid/87410b00-adb0-11e6-9193-00241d738094 /dev/gptid/87410b00-adb0-11e6-9193-00241d\n738094\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The gptids came from my zpool status command.\n\n", "Q: Auto mount a drive that located on Ubuntu and auto share that drive for Window I have tried to find the solution for many days but I couldn't find one.\nAll are posted about auto mount a share folder that come from Window.\nBut my case the backup drive is located on Ubuntu 12.04 desktop and I would like to have my drive (/dev/sda3) mount at boot time then auto share that drive for accessing from Window users.

Trouble is I've tried using Banshee, Rhythmbox, GTKPod and nothing happens. Banshee goes through the process of viewing/adding tracks and it even \"appears\" to sync music, but when I check it on my iPhone, there is absolutely no music on the device. Over at the libimobiledevice.org website, it states\n\nLatest Release: 1.0.7 Development/Unstable Release: 1.1.5\nTested with iPod Touch 1G/2G/3G/4G, iPhone 1G/2G/3G/3GS/4/4S/5, iPad 1/2/3rd Gen and Apple TV running up to firmware 6.1.3 on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.\n\nSo I believe I should be able to sync my device. However Ubuntu's version of libimobiledevice is 1.1.4, so how can I update that package exactly? I don't really want to use an unstable package to get syncing to work, but I've found no other solutions. I have even tried installing iTunes with PlayonLinux and sadly, syncing is not supported with Wine at this time. Any suggestions?

I'm going to a LAN tomorrow, however, they all use windows and we're planning on playing some games that are only for windows. I have a laptop with a pretty SSD of 60GB with Ubuntu that works perfect so far. However, with a partition of windows+game, the space might become a problem. So I was thinking about doing this, but wanted to know if it was going to work before spending 2+ hours by asking here.\nI have my original 256GB HDD. If I install windows there from the actual laptop, can I swap then to Ubuntu seamlessly by just swapping the HDD for the SSD? The only information I could find in google was changing the HDD from one computer to another, which would not work for the devices installed, but since this would use 2 different disks for the same computer (physically changing them), I thought it might work.\nWill Ubuntu and Windows run after installing Windows in that way? My main concern has to do with the BIOS getting modified by a not so play along Windows and not letting me boot Ubuntu then, but I'm not sure how that works and I am not aware of other potential problems. Are you?\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tried both Wine and VirtualBox; none worked.\n\n*I don't want to delete Ubuntu. It works like a charm for my daily use.\n\n*It's fine physically swapping SSD for HHD and back in the laptop. It will likely be done once or twice in its lifetime.\n\n\nA: Swapping the HDD should work fine. The BIOS is not modified by a Windows installation. I did this for myself some time ago on an IBM Thinkpad.\n\nA: Providing that Windows and Ubuntu are both on their own respective drive, running on the same computer, you shouldn't have any problems.\nNow what you can do if your system hardware, and BIOS allows you, you can have both drive physically attached, and all you have to do is change boot-up priority, when you power on the machine.\nAgain make sure that your system can handle that.  Most new system are able to do that.\n", "Q: Slow Performance...Hard drive Problem? I had my laptop run out of battery twice in the last two weeks.

I'm facing the same problem with ubuntu 13.04 too. I have no other operating systems running in virtualbox\n\nA: I have the same exact issue and the workaround is to power off the virtual machine after it's hung. Then start the Virtual Box again. When the install Ubuntu screen is up, close the window and then Ubuntu desktop will load. Then click on the power icon on the top right and then click on restart. When the system restarts, the installed Ubuntu will be loaded and you will be prompted to type in your credentials (if you have specified it in during the installation).\n\nA: I also encountered this problem and worked around it in a slightly different way from Vijay.

At this point, I go back to the main window called \"Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager,\" right click on the virtual machine that is frozen, choose Close > Power Off, and click OK when I get to the VirtualBox warning about losing unsaved data. At this point, the virtual machine is powered off.\nNext, I start the virtual machine and it boots again from the installation media. When I'm prompted to Try Ubuntu or Install Ubuntu, I choose Try Ubuntu. After that, the virtual machine loads into the trial version of Ubuntu. Once that happens, I click the top-right power icon in the top nav bar in Ubuntu (within the virtual machine window) and choose Shut Down. During the shutdown process, the machine prompts me to remove installation media, close the tray, and hit Enter.

I am not a noob to Ubuntu. I have been here for a while. The question I am going to ask is basically requiring an explanatory answer, possible with examples. My question is simple. It is as below:- \nEveryone says, Ubuntu was developed from Debian, by tripping down so many thing, adding something else, giving custom displays, branding, images or backgrounds, etc. My question is how do they do it. \nWas it by just installing a minimal Debian distro in a computer system, adding and making changes to that system, adding Ubiquity installer to the installed distro, and then creating an iso file ?\nConsider the two scenarios.\nScenario 1\n\n\n*\n\n*They mount a CD ISO image\n\n*Remove unwanted packages\n\n*Add branding\n\n*Make customizations\n\n*repack the ISO\n-OR-\nScenario 2\n\n\n*\n\n*Install a Debian distro in the PC\n\n*Remove unwanted packages, and install new ones to the installed OS\n\n*Apply custom brandings to the installed OS\n\n*Make customizations in the installed machine\n\n*Add an installer to the installed OS\n\n*repack the ISO\nWhat is actually happening ?\n\nA: The heart of the distribution is the package archive, so they started by creating an archive (archive.ubuntu.com), and copying the debian source packages there and building them on the build daemons.  Then they proceeded to modify many packages and update the archive, before finally declaring it the first release of Ubuntu, and building fresh cd images from the archive.\nThe live cd and ubiquity came about several releases later.  Initially the install cd used debian-installer: what we now call the alternate/server cd.\n\nA: To answer this question would take a very long answer, and it would be a lot of information to put in.  I’ve been able to summarize it to this.  I hope that it helps in answering your question. \nUbuntu has its roots in the Debian GNU/Linux distribution. It was initially planned as a simple fork from the main distribution. \nDebian tends to be more conservative in how often it releases new versions. The new fork was set to be a snapshot released every six months. It was originally released under the name \"no-name-yet.com.\" This domain now redirects to the main Ubuntu website. \nThe six month release schedule held, but the simple snapshot idea did not. Unlike other Debian-based forks (e.g., Xandros, Linspire, and Libranet), the new version remains freely available and uses predominantly free software (some of the hardware drivers are proprietary). \nIt has, however, grown beyond its Debian roots and become a distribution in its own right. Whereas one used to be able to mix and match software from the two, now one must be more careful about compatibility. \nNo-name-yet.com eventually became Ubuntu, and the first publically released version (4.10) was released in October of 2004. It quickly became very popular among Linux users for its ease of use and advanced hardware support. It remains the most popular version of Linux at Distrowatch. \nDevelopment of the distribution is currently funded by Canonical Ltd, a company owned and run by Mark Shuttleworth. In July of 2005, Canonical created the Ubuntu Foundation with an initial endowment of $10 million (USD). The purpose of the foundation is to support development and to keep the operating system free of charge should anything happen to Shuttleworth or the parent company, Canonical. \nThe Official Ubuntu Book: Introducing Ubuntu\nThis chapter introduces the Ubuntu project, its distribution, its development processes, and some of the history that made it all possible. \n\n\n*\n\n*A Wild Ride\n\n*Free Software, Open Source, and GNU/Linux\n\n*A Brief History of Ubuntu\n\n*What Is Ubuntu?\n\n*Ubuntu Promises and Goals\n\n*Canonical and the Ubuntu Foundation\n\n*Ubuntu Subprojects, Derivatives, and Spin offs\n\n*Summary\n\n\nTHIS CHAPTER INTRODUCES THE UBUNTU PROJECT, its distribution, its development processes, and some of the history that made it all possible. If you are looking to jump right in and get started with Ubuntu, turn right away to Chapter 2, Installing Ubuntu. If you are interested in first learning about where Ubuntu comes from and where it is going, this chapter will provide a good introduction.\nA Wild Ride\nIn April 2004 Mark Shuttleworth brought together a dozen developers from the Debian, GNOME, and GNU Arch projects to brainstorm. Shuttleworth asked the developers if a better type of operating system (OS) was possible. Their answer was \"Yes.\" He asked them what it would look like. \nHe asked them to describe the community that would build such an OS. That group worked with Mark to come up with answers to these questions, and then they decided to try to make the answers a reality. The group named itself the Warthogs and gave itself a six-month deadline to build a proof-of-concept OS. They nicknamed their first release the Warty Warthog with the reasonable assumption that their first product would have its warts. Then they got down to business.  Read On\nBelow are some references that I found can shed some more light in answering, but I said in the beginning, this would take a lot of information to answer.\nThere is a document titled Debian and Ubuntu, in PDF format, which can be downloaded from Here\nWhat is Ubuntu Linux?\nHistory of Ubuntu: Revisited & Updated\nThe Ubuntu story\nSource:The Official Ubuntu Book: Introducing Ubuntu\n\nA: As far as I can tell, you are not going to get a good answer unless you talk to the developers who where there at the start.\nLooking at the ubuntu-devel mailing lists back through September and December 2004 when Warty Warthog was released, gives no good clues as to how they started this. However, if you look at how to build a Debian fork, today, you can get a decent idea of how they might have started.\nBasically, you need to create a new repository and go from there.\n\nA: Ubuntu is .deb based, so you can't just targz up the operating system and put it onto a CD. While I don't have authentic information as to how Ubuntu was forked off Debian, the best guess would be that they got some of the distro-wide build tools to work and pulled the packages they deemed important from the unstable repo of Debian, then applied customizations to them. These packages got added to the APT repo and the debootstrap process.\nBasically if you're building a distro, you can go two ways. Either you start from scratch and look up the packages you want included at the upstream maintainer's site, pull and package those into your own format and add dependency information yourself, or you fork it off a relatively stable distribution.\nRepacking the whole system isn't a very maintainable way to go, because you will not have the information as to which package depends on which. This is important because software in the *NIX world gets compiled with a lot of dependencies (libraries and other files) across packages, so even something as trivial as creating a minimalistic chroot is close to a nightmare. Not even speaking of a whole operating system.\n\nA: You may need to go ask those that were there ..\nThe key pieces (from my recollection, as an observer) were the simplified driver model (so everything fitted on one CD), the selection of a group of 'standard' apps, and other (simple) details about making it easier to install and support.\n\nHere is a small piece of the puzzle:\nPhoneAena.com > In depth interview: Ubuntu Touch aims to learn from Android's mistakes\n\nThe Genesis of Ubuntu Touch\nUbuntu began in 2004 and quickly generated interest within the Linux community. Developers gathered around the product, and more importantly the ethos of the distribution. At the time, Linux distros were the realm of the tech elite, and were not accessible to average users. Mark Shuttleworth gathered developers from the Debian community to change that. The goal was to create a Linux distrobution that was easy-to-use, easy to obtain, and held to a strict update schedule. The first two parts of that strategy were the real keys of course, because accessibility opened up a much wider user base for the OS. \n\n", "Q: Disappearing and reappearing ethernet connection I have internet via ethernet cable plugged in directly into my desktop machine; windows and ubuntu on the same machine.\nThe problem is that after loggin in internet is working (though the speed is less than on Windows) for about 10 mins, after which connection disappears: cannot ping anything, nslookup is not responding too.

How can I do How can I boot UBUNTU installer from USB stick? I did it last year I don't remember how. I used a software from windows. In bios setup menu there is not 'USB' in the options\n\nA: Yeah, you can just download the ubuntu iso from the www.ubuntu.com site. Then you can use UNetbootin as @karel indicated. There are a few different tools to write iso's to usb sticks. \nI have not used windows in a while. You could also just download the iso to windows, and then use a drive emulator like Daemon Tools to mount the iso as if it was a drive. Then you can open Ubuntu and check it out. If you still want to create a USB, then you can click on the Ubuntu Dash and type in \"startup disk creator.\" The startup disk creator has the option of install ubuntu to a usb stick. Once you write the iso to the USB stick, you can reboot and load from the usb stick.\n\nA: You can find good tutorials for all important Operating Systems at http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/try-ubuntu-before-you-install at right hand side.\nCanonical explains how-to create a bootable USB stick.\n\nA: important is this, before you install *.iso - image on to\nyour usb-stick,\nthis usb-stick needs to be formatted with boot-flag !\nfirst format in gparted, - then add boot-flag to it !\n\nA: Use this link of ubuntu.com, which there is tutorial about making USB - bootable:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows\n", "Q: Disk Usage Analyzer and other programs reporting incorrect partition capacities I recently resized/moved my home partition and then expanded my root partition into the free space remaining. I did this all off a bootable usb with gparted. When i started ubuntu back up and ran osm2pgsql(it converts map files into databse form) it complained about not having enough space in the root directory. Running all the usual df -h, gparted, gnome-disk, gnome-system-monitor and checking properties of my root directory showed that it has a capacity of 66.2GB, of which 6.0GB is used. When I use Disk Usage Analyzer though, it reports a size of ~6GB(which i guess is what osm2pgsql detects too). The strange thing is that I didn't even start with 6GB before i resized/moved. I started with about 12GB if my memory serves correctly. Also, my home partition is reported to have shrunk to 64.1GB from about 1.4TB before when using Disk Usage Analyzer. As a final clue, disk Usage Analyzer reports the correct size of root before it scans the folders - not sure if that helps.\n\n\n\nA: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1122670\nThis is a very large topic, so go to section #5, where it says:\n\nWhile DUA provides valuable information, it often brings up questions\nabout its use. Here are some things to keep in mind:\nOnce a scan is\ncomplete, the top entry, whether it is the system or a single folder,\nwill always show 100%. The sub-folder percentages add up to 100%. 100%\ndoes not necessarily mean there is no space left on the partition.\n\nA similar thing happened to me on Debian 7/Gnome 3.  I tried to install google-chrome, but it installs to /opt so my root partition filled and it aborted.  Gnome opens Disk Usage Analyzer and it says 100%, but df only says 52% in use.  So in my case, DUA misled me and wasted my time only.  I'm sorry I can't say why your program fails through, I would only say make sure that it is not generating large files somewhere on that partition.\n", "Q: Display brightness setting not working in sony vaio SVE151117F I have sony vaio  SVE151117F, ubuntu 12.10.I used to see brightness animation upon pressing Fn+F6,F5 but not actual brightness of screen.\nI have tried to implement as said in  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2086359\nbut now I cant even see the brightness level animation.There is no change in brightness level of screen as usual.\nI tried below links too , but still problem persists.\nunable to change brightness settings in sony vaio e series laptop\nhttp://vaioubuntu.wordpress.com/2008/12/04/finally-a-brightness-how-to-for-vaio-fw-series/\n\nA: Go to the link below and download the driver by entering the commands posted their.

When I run Ubuntu I click log in but it automatically logs me in as user so I can't type my username. As a result, in order to run certain apps or set up my network I'm asked to type the root password for authentication. I don't wanna log in as a superuser. Please note that I'm a newbie to Ubuntu.\n\nA: Okay, there is a difference between your password and the root password (the password of the account \"root\").\nWhen you first installed Ubuntu, you specified your username (let's say you chose Ele) and your password; this is the password that you would use to log in. Since you have Ubuntu to log in automatically, you won't be asked for this password when booting Ubuntu.\nThe default installation of Ubuntu makes your user an admin; that is, it makes you able to install and remove applications and all that. The password that is asked when you install/remove components is usually your password, Ele's password. Take a look at these screenshots:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*This program is asking you to Enter your password, so this would be the password of Ele, that you used to install Ubuntu, which is the same password you use to log in.\n\n*If you did not set a password when you were installing Ubuntu (and I think this is where your problem is Ele), then you need to set a password for your user. To do so, simply type the following command (commands can be typed in a terminal which you can open by Ctrl+Alt+T):\npasswd\n\nAnd enter your new password. Note: you won't see any stars *** or anything; don't worry, just continue typing.\nNow, let's look at another kind of prompt that could ask you for a password:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*This program is asking you to Enter the administrative password, which is the root password, the superuser password, the password of the account \"root\". This password is NOT set by default.\n\n*It is generally not advisable to set a root password unless you really need to, because it essentially opens doors to lots of accidental, harmful tasks. But, if you really want to set the root password, you would do this:\nsudo passwd root\n\nIt will first ask you to enter your password, in order to carry out this command (because you typed sudo). Then, it will ask you to specify a new root password.\n\n\n*\n\n*If your account does not have a password set in the first place, this command will not work, because you are performing a sudo command, which will require your password first.\n\n\n*Note1: if you have set a root password and you want to remove it and go back to how it was, do this command:\nsudo passwd -dl root\n\nIt will, again, ask you for your password, because you are doing a command that starts with sudo. This command deletes the password and locks the root account.\n\n*Note2: you should rarely see this second screenshot, the one that's asking for the root password. Usually, you'll be asked to enter your user's password. That is how Ubuntu is set up, so that you don't need to log in as the root (superuser) to perform administrative tasks, you only \"borrow\" the root privileges by using the command sudo.\n\n\nA: Use\nsudo passwd\n\nEssentially, it makes root do 'passwd' which sets a password for the user who used the command.\n\nA: How to change your root password\nFor both of the following, press Ctrl + Alt + T to launch a Terminal window then:\nMethod 1\nType in\nsudo  passwd\n\nMethod 2\nType in\nsudo su\n\nThen to create a new password for su enter:\npasswd.\n\nConclusion\nEssentially, these commands asks root to do the passwd command. This sets the root password which is the one you type to access root privileges with su.\nsu offers the following: In terminal and programmes run from terminal, you have changed from being you@your_computer to root@your_computer.\nEdit\nJust looked at the other answers and this appears to be an amalgamation of the two previous ones! My apologies. \n\nA: Type the following in the command line:\n\nsudo su\n\nThen generate new password for root:\n\npasswd\n\n", "Q: How to create a dialog and set title and text dynamically Looking at the Dialog component example in the Ubuntu SDK documentation, it looks as if dialogs are intended to be defined as static components with fixed title and text. Or at least I cannot figure out how to change it before showing the dialog.\nI've also been hinted at the show() method of the PopupBase class on which Dialog is based, but I've not worked out how to use them for my purposes.\nI've got a signal handler in my code where I'd like to open a dialog and dynamically set the title and text.\nonSomethingHappened: {\n   /* Open a dialog and set the title and text properties */\n}\n\nHow can I do that?\n\nA: This is not an answer to your question since the dialog text is not directly changed, but it might be an answer to your problem, since the dialog text changes itself dynamically :-)\nAssuming that you have some item that triggeres the onSomethingHappened, you could connect properties of the dialog to properties of the item. \nExample:\nItem {\n  Component {\n     id: dialog\n     Dialog {\n        id: dialogue\n        title: someID.dialogTitle\n        text: someID.dialogText\n        Button {\n            text: \"cancel\"\n            onClicked: PopupUtils.close(dialogue)\n        }\n     }\n  }\n}\n\nSomeItem {\n  id: someID\n  property string dialogTitle\n  property string dialogText\n  onSomethingHappened: {\n     dialogTitle = \"Hello David\"\n     dialogText = \"Whats up?\"\n     PopupUtils.open(dialog)\n  }\n}\n\n\nA: I've found I can do this with the following snippet in my code (root is the caller id for the open() method, but can be ignored for this example). Essentially, populating the params argument in the PopUtils.open() function:\nPopupUtils.open(Qt.resolvedUrl(\"QrCodeDialog.qml\"), root, {\n                    title: i18n.tr(\"This is the title\"),\n                    text: i18n.tr(\"This is the text\")\n                })\n\nAnd then the QrCodeDialog.qml file contains:\nimport QtQuick 2.0\nimport Ubuntu.Components 0.1\nimport Ubuntu.Components.Popups 0.1\n\nDialog {\n    id: qrcodedialog\n    title: \"\"\n    text: \"\"\n\n    Button {\n        text: i18n.tr(\"Close\")\n        onClicked: PopupUtils.close(qrcodedialog)\n    }\n}\n\n", "Q: Login problem - I enter password and it just asks for the password again I am running Ubuntu 12.04 on an IBM T43 laptop.\nI hadn't used the laptop for a few weeks and forgot the password so reset it using the info found on here but now after entering the password the screen just keeps asking for the password again ???\nls -l /home returns dr-x------\nI can login OK as 'Guest' and use internet but cannot use my own personal login.\nAny idea what is wrong and how to fix it?\n\nA: there's a problem with your X server. try booting in failsafe mode, and install the appropriate binary drivers for your graphics card.\n\nA: Welp.\nThis is all easier if you have experience with linux or have installed gentoo/arch before.\nEssentially, you will be booting from a live cd and making grub boot from text mode.\nGet a live ubuntu (or any other distribution's) cd and boot into it.\nOpen their file manager and find your system (usually found in /media)\nMount the live cd'd /etc /proc and /sys into the /media system boot.\nGet in the command-line.\nNow, you're going to use an editor of choice (nano, vim, gedit) to edit /etc/default/grub.\nMake sure you use sudo.\nYou're going to want to find:\n\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nAnd change quiet splash to text.\nSave the file and do sudo update-grub.\n_\nNext time you boot into linux, you will have a commandline.\nI assume your problem has to do with drivers not working and deniying X the ability to start.\nTry removing all of those drivers and reinstalling them.\n(I recommed you try the open source drivers since they are way less likely to fail you)\nHope that helped you. :)\n", "Q: Unable to log in Although I've set up a username and password when I was installing Ubuntu 13.04, when I type in my password it says it's incorrect although language is checked and my password's correct.

How can I install .run files?\nWhen I open them with the software center, I always get the message that the file couldn't be opened.\n\nA: .run files usually are scripts. You should not install - execute any file - script outside of Ubuntu repositories, except if you trust 100% the source. \nYou can see the contents of the .run file with an editor. \ngedit <filename>.run \n\nYou can execute a .run file from terminal (CTRL+ALT+T). First give the appropriate permissions. You have to connect to folder where the file is. I assume is in Downloads folder \ncd Downloads \nchmod +x <filename>.run \n\nThen execute it with \n./<filename>.run  \n\nor if needs root privileges (dangerous) , prefix with sudo \n", "Q: replacing ubuntu 10.04 with lubuntu 13.04 I'm having some issues with upgrading 10.04 with lubuntu 13.04.

I was sued into another user to run screen, but I got the error Cannot open your terminal '/dev/pts/4' - please check.\nI found a solution: script /dev/null and after that I can use screen. Why does this work? It creates a new pseudo terminal?\n\nA: On UNIX, this is a virtual-file that can be written to. Data written to this file gets discarded. It is similar to the file call NUL on Windows machines. \nKey point; When rooting a machine, intruders will often redirect logging to /dev/null For example, the command ln -s /dev/null .bash_history will cause the system to stop logging bash commands. \nIn layman's terms, it means much the same thing as black hole. Typical usage: if you don't like what I have to say, please direct your comments to /dev/null. \nThink of /dev/null as a \"black hole.\" It is the nearest equivalent to a write-only file. Everything written to it disappears forever. Attempts to read or output from it result in nothing. Nevertheless, /dev/null can be quite useful from both the command line and in scripts.\n\n\n*\n\n*It discards all data written to it but reports that the write\noperation succeeded.\n\n*It means redirecting both standard output and error to /dev/null\n\n*It prevents the script from displaying anything. like windows \"echo\noff\"\n\n\nscript /dev/null prevent any message from appearing on your screen.  It supresses the messages, byt directing them to the \"black hole.\"\nAlso, have a look at Why does redirecting 'script' to /dev/null/ allow 'screen' to work while su'ed as another user?\nSource:Linux Dictionary\n\nA: Basically script saves all terminal dialogue into a file, when you specify /dev/null as the file all the stuff script would save into a file would be saved into the black hole.\n\nA: script FILE COMMAND... is used to run COMMAND saving a copy of all input and output to FILE, while still enabling interactive input/output through your terminal.\nscript /dev/null COMMAND... therefore runs COMMAND, and the copy of the output goes to the file /dev/null, the bitbucket, in other words it just gets deleted; but the output still goes to your terminal as if you were not using script.\nWhat is the purpose of this? It sounds like a pointless step which doesn't achieve anything useful – taking a copy of the output and then sending the copy nowhere. However, it does have one side-effect which is helpful.\nSome commands use the isatty() function to determine whether stdin/stdout/stderr is a terminal, and they behave differently depending on whether it is or not – for example, they may output ANSI colour codes if stdout is a terminal, but not do so if it is not. That is usually what you want – if you are sending the output to a file or piping it to another program, you usually don't want ANSI escape codes in that output. However, what if you actually do? How can you get the program to send output including ANSI escape codes even when the output isn't a terminal? Some programs have a command line option or environment variable to force colour output even when stdout is not a terminal, but not all do. For programs which lack such a facility to force colour output, script /dev/null can be used as a workaround. It will allocate a pseudoterminal, pass that to the command as stdout, and then copy the output sent to that pseudoterminal to its own (non-terminal) stdout. Similarly, some programs (intended for interactive use) refuse to receive input if stdin is not a terminal, so you can't pipe input to them from another program or redirect their input from a file; script /dev/null can be used to get around this.\n", "Q: Ubuntu One: can you shutdown your computer when syncing is in process?

They disappear upon my unplugging the power supply. However there is still a buzz when I move the cursor. Can this problem be fixed?\nMy Ubuntu version is 12.04. The laptop is a Dell Latitude D630.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: The problem is probably related to improper electrical isolation, or due to power supply noise.\nNoise on the power supply could possibly be transferred over to the headphones. The issue is caused by improper electrical shielding or isolation. There is generally no fix for this because it is in the hardware design. You could listen to it while unplugged.\nAn alternative solution, assuming that you have some familiarity with electronics, is to build a static limiter.\nhttp://www.ittc.ku.edu/~jstiles/312/handouts/Diode%20Limiters.pdf\nBy adding a capacitor in series with the headphones and connecting two reverse-parallel diodes across the two terminals, it will reduce the amount of pops, clicks, and static.\n\nA: I switched power adapters and the problem seemed to go away.\n\nA: This issue occurs in two cases\n1.) When electrical supply is more than your laptop's charger standards\n                 or\n\n2.) When electrical supply is less than your laptop's charger standards\nYour problem will be fixed when power supply to your house or workplace is\ntreated.\nTry listening to the earphones while your laptop is plugged in at another place different from you electricity supply.\nI've a DELL inspiron 1545 and... this problem occured many times with it..... and cured automatically\n\nA: [FIXED] This problem is so rare that the dell folks did't belived me and said that they never noted or encountered such an issue before,no diagnostic worked...and finally after two three days of searching I found a fix,not sure if it will work for others but it worked for some and me.Solution is Extension Cord/Electrical Flex Box,please note that I am not talking about any power strips or surge protectors by belkin etc..i have a cheap power strip with a short wire of 5 feet and that didn't worked..I am talking about an Extension Cord/Electrical Flex Box with a very long cable tied circularly inside a plastic casing, don't worry there are many on amazon,they look like this :-\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51w9YSgj%2BoL.SY355.jpg\ntest your luck and see if it helps..cheers :p\n", "Q: How to detect whether an app is running on a mobile device or on the desktop I'm using the Ubuntu SDK to develop a QML app that runs both on the desktop and on mobile devices. Depending on where it's running on the desktop or on a device, certain behaviours should be different.\nWhat's the recommended way of programmatically detecting whether an app is running on the desktop or on a mobile device?  \n\nA: At the moment the only way to detect it is by checking the Application's width and height. For instance assuming that the phone's widthxheight is 40x71 GU (default portrait), the tablet is 160x100 GU (default landscape), anything that goes above 160x100 GU can be considered as desktop.\nThere are plans to provide flags to identify for instance whether there is a HW keyboard attached, pointing device, ASO, however those flags should not be used alone to identify a desktop form factor as you can attach mouse/HW keyboard to phone/tablet through bluetooth.\n\nA: @zsombi so something like this?\nMainView {\n    id: mainView\n    objectName: \"mainView\"\n    applicationName: \"myapp\"\n    automaticOrientation: true\n    width:  units.gu(40)\n    height: units.gu(71)\n\n    //detect whether an app is running on a mobile device or on the desktop, base on screen-size\n    property bool desktop: false;\n    function sizeChanged()\n    {\n        if(mainView.width > units.gu(160) && mainView.height < units.gu(100))\n           desktop = true;\n        else\n            desktop = false;\n    }\n    onWidthChanged: {\n        sizeChanged();\n    }\n    onHeightChanged: {\n        sizeChanged();\n    }\n}\n\nThen you can make an \nif(desktop) \n    //Desktop  \nelse \n    //mobil \n\n", "Q: why do i have no adress bar and why is Netflix slow on my computer I downloaded Ubuntu and it worked great, but then one day my address bar didn't show up on my name.

They did, and I was stuck without it. please tell me what happened, and how to get it back. also I downloaded Netflix and it is really slow and doesn't work well at at all.\n\nA: If you are using the Netflix-desktop package, it will always run in fullscreen (but only while using the application) likely due to a compatability issue with silverlight.  To my knowledge, there is no way to change this.  As for the slow video playback, I would assume that it's just another compatability issue, as the netflix package uses the windows version of silverlight, which has not been optimized for Ubuntu.\nI'm confused by what you mean when you refer to your \"adress bar\".  If it is the one on the Ubuntu desktop, make sure you have the \"Ubuntu\" option selected to the right of your username as you login to the computer.  Other desktop environments (kde, xfce, lxde etc.) can look very different, and many do not show your username in the upper right corner like unity and gnome.  Hope this helps!\n\nA: When using netflix-desktop, you can come out of full screen mode by pressing F11. This is just a functionality of the Firefox browser; it works whenever you're using Firefox. Also, if you run netflix-desktop from the terminal, you can use the \nnetflix-desktop --windowed \n\nflag to open the browser in non-full screen mode. Try entering \nnetflix-desktop -help  \n\nin the terminal for a list of all the options available when running from the terminal.\n", "Q: How can I tell if Windows 7 update is deleting my kernel?

No use.\nI finally tracked it down to a 3.8 Kernel bug with certain Intel graphic chips, causes an irq storm from the i915, described here\nI updated the Kernel to 3.9 following the instructions on Ubuntu Kernel/MainlineBuilds wiki. (Download 3.9 images and dpkg -i, restart)\nProblem gone, laptop is running fine and is usable again. No more freezes.\nRunning 3.8 Kernel is no option on my hardware, downgrading to 12.04 LTS is not attractive either (it had it's problems).\nIs it safe to keep using this 3.9 Kernel on 13.04? What's best advice here? \n\nA: If the kernel works then I would keep it. I would find the corresponding bug in the Ubuntu bug tracker and keep an eye on it though to see if it gets fixed eventually. If you can't find a bug it might be best to report it and mention the URL you linked to to make sure the patch gets on the kernel team's radar. \nWhen 13.10 comes around and you upgrade to that you can just use the kernel that comes with it and you should be fine. It's not ideal that the distro kernel doesn't work with your laptop, but in this case working always wins over not working. \n\nA: This is the commit that fixes the bug, Linux merged it in 3.11:\nhttps://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=0ce99f749b3834edeb500e17d6ad17e86b60ff83\nIf you're ready to compile your own kernel then you can use the latest stable kernel. Another possibility would be to use the 3.10 longterm kernes and apply the patch yourself, it's not merged in the 3.10 series...\nI'm using 3.11.1, but because my T400 is constantly noisy on the interrupt lines (the irq storm just never ends), I increased the polling time from 2 minutes to 5 minutes.\n", "Q: phpmyadmin throws a 404 on opening I have installed php5 and phpMyAdmin from the Ubuntu Software Centre on a fresh install of Ubuntu 13.04. \nwhen I enter localhost in my browser the following is displayed:\nIt works!\nThis is the default web page for this server.\nThe web server software is running but no content has been added, yet.\nSo something is working.\nif I then type in localhost/phpmyadmin or localhost/phpmyadmin/index.php the page returns a 404 error page, file not found.\nI created a file in /var/www called test.php with one line in it <?php phpinfo(); ?> when I try to access it through my browser, I get 403 Forbidden\nThis points to a permissions problem\nwith phpMyAdmin I also installed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apache HTTP Server metapackage (apache2)\n\n*Base support for JavaScript library packages (javascript-common)\n\n*Fast webserver with minimal memory footprint (lighttpd)\n\n*MySQL Client (mysql-client)\n\n*GD module for php5 (php5-gd)\n\n*MySQL Server (mysql-server)\n\n\nWhen installing phpMyAdmin, I was not asked any questions, which I found interesting as on previous installs, I have been asked to choose a server.\nThe folder /etc/phpmyadmin has the following content:\n\n\n*\n\n*conf.d/ \n\n*config-db.php.ucf-dist\n\n\nThe folder conf.d has no content\nIs there something I need to install which I haven't or is there something I can do to fix the 404 & 403 errors?\nEdit\nowners in /var\n:/var$ ls -lh\ntotal 48K\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root     4.0K Jun  9 12:16 backups\ndrwxr-xr-x 21 root root     4.0K Jun  9 13:28 cache\ndrwxrwsrwt  2 root whoopsie 4.0K Jun  9 16:01 crash\ndrwxr-xr-x 73 root root     4.0K Jun  8 19:24 lib\ndrwxrwsr-x  2 root staff    4.0K Apr 19 10:03 local\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root root        9 Jun  9 16:00 lock -> /run/lock\ndrwxr-xr-x 20 root root     4.0K Jun  9 16:01 log\ndrwxrwsr-x  2 root mail     4.0K Apr 24 18:01 mail\ndrwxrwsrwt  2 root whoopsie 4.0K Apr 24 18:05 metrics\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root     4.0K Apr 24 18:01 opt\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root root        4 Jun  9 16:00 run -> /run\ndrwxr-xr-x 10 root root     4.0K Jun  8 19:41 spool\ndrwxrwxrwt  4 root root     4.0K Jun  9 16:25 tmp\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 www-data www-data     4.0K Jun  7 21:04 www\n\nand:\n...:/var$ ls -lh /var/www\ntotal 12K\n-rw-r--r-- 1 www-data www-data  177 Jun  7 20:30 index.html\n-rw-r--r-- 1 www-data www-data 3.5K Jun  7 20:30 index.lighttpd.html\n-rw-r--r-- 1 www-data www-data   20 Jun  7 21:04 test.php\n-rw-r--r-- 1 www-data www-data    0 Jun  7 21:04 test.php~\n\non restarting the apache2 service I get the following in Terminal\nsimon@simon-VGN-AR71E:~$ sudo service apache2 restart\napache2: Syntax error on line 260 of /etc/apache2/apache2.conf: Could not open configuration file /etc/apache2/conf.d/phpmyadmin.conf: No such file or directory\nAction 'configtest' failed.\nThe Apache error log may have more information.\n   ...fail!\n\ni renamed phpmyadmin.conf link and ran \nsudo ln -s /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf /etc/apache2/conf.d/phpmyadmin.conf\n\nsee the broken link symbol in nautilus:\n\nsimon@simon-VGN-AR71E:~$ ls -lh /etc/apache2/conf.d\ntotal 16K\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  269 Jul 16  2012 charset\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   45 Jun  7 21:14 javascript-common.conf -> /etc/javascript-common/javascript-common.conf\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 3.3K Jul 16  2012 localized-error-pages\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  143 Jul 16  2012 other-vhosts-access-log\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   28 Jun  9 17:28 phpmyadmin.conf -> ../../phpmyadmin/apache.conf\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1.7K Jul 16  2012 security\n\nEND===================================\n\nA: Maybe it is an apache permission problem.

If I create something using MS Office, or other Windows software, will I be able to access the file in Ubuntu? \nThanks!\n\nA: Yes.\nThere is almost always an alternative to windows programs. Documents and images are handled well by the default programs, Libre Office and Image viewer respectively.\nYou will be able to access windows partition from within Ubuntu, however, windows refuses to recognize the ubuntu partition. If you would like to access files from both windows and Ubuntu, it is recommended to make a third partition in NTFS or FAT and store your files there.\n", "Q: Why do games lag in wine for me but everyone else seems to not experience this?

Counter-Strike: Source natively runs good.\nFor the record, ALL OF THESE GAMES run 100% with excellent frames in windows 7 on this same computer.\nI have tried all of the proprietary drivers, and I am currently set to 313. Am I doing something wrong? A bad wine setting? Keep in mind my wine drives are being set up by playonlinux.\nIf anyone can help, THANKS! I do not want to go back to windows, but it's looking like this linux thing is just an uphill battle that still ends up with poor performance. I've been using linux for almost 3 months now, it's like everything is a battle to get a task done. \n\nA: Since you have a recent machine, you might be using hybrid graphics (nVidia Optimus in this case).\nIf that's the case, you could very well be running on the weaker integrated graphics rather than on your dedicated graphics card, which causes lag.\nIf this is indeed your problem, you need to install bumblebee which will offer support for hybrid graphics. The procedure is described here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee#Installation\nOnce installed, you need to run your game using your dedicated graphics card. This can be done by executing optirun instead of directly invoking the command:\noptirun wine yourgame.exe\n\n\nA: As mentioned before you need to install bumblebee and with command optirun you have to run a game but i suggest to install by this manual http://www.webupd8.org/2013/02/bumblebee-31-released-with-primus.html , because there is used primus which takse shorte way and by that inproves performance.\nand in wine they are running crappy because opengl on linux is cutted like hell and even if it shows 4.0 it actualy is about 1.6 in performance. So don't be suprised when windows games which are not native in linux , runs crappy in wine.\n\nA: I had the same problem. Some Source games - like latest Portal and CS:GO have the \"Multicore rendering\" option. Disabling it - will reduce lagging, but game will perform in single core. That's the best option, for now, that I know..\n", "Q: Alacarte creating entries shown in menu but not in editor I created a \"calculator\" entry in main applications menu of Xubuntu, using Alacarte (gcalctool command - it seems to be a wrong one, as it can't find it). \nBUT:\nit is not shown in the list of Alacarte, so I cannot delete or hide it.\nI suppose I have to edit a .desktop file. I found two of them and I tried \"Hide only root entries\" from here but none of them has \"X-Xfce-Toplevel;\" in it's categories.\nWhy does not Alacarte \"control\" some entries? How can I repair or delete these entries?\nedit: I have found that there are also some entries of this type by default, not only in the root menu, but also in the submenus. Even after restoring the \"system default\" menu.\n\nA: When I tried to redo what you did, I got two new desktop files at:\n~/.local/share/applications/alacarte-made.desktop\n~/.local/share/applications/alacarte-made-1.desktop\n\nSince they are top-level, they do not have any category, it seems.\nAlacarte takes the system default from /usr/share/applications and adds from ~/.local/share/applications. \nRepairing or deleting installed desktop files is not a commendable approach for a multi-user system, so each user can only modify his/her own view of what's installed. \nIn case you misconfigured your view, there's a nice Revert button next to Close.\n", "Q: how do I install Firebird 2.1 on Ubuntu 13.04 When updating form ubuntu 12 to 13 my firebird 2.1 was uninstalled.

I created user1 when I installed, and created user2 today with '1useradd' and I added it to all the same groups as user1. \nBut when I log in remotely using SSH, the prompt for user1 looks like this:\nuser1@host:~$\n\nAnd the prompt for user2 looks like this:\n$\n\nMost importantly, the shell doesn't behave as nicely as I'm used to when I'm  logged in as user2. There is no autocomplete of commands or files with tab, and I can't access the MRU with up.\n\nA: Note: Use the method in the update, it's safer than manually editing passwd file.\nthe useradd command apparently sets /bin/sh as the default shell (which in turn is linked to /bin/dash). Try editing /etc/passwd and change /bin/sh to /bin/bash for user2.\nIn the future, use adduser instead.\nUDPATE:\nAs @Scott suggested below, instead of editing /etc/passwd use the chsh command:\nchsh /bin/bash\nSource: http://the-hydra.blogspot.com.ar/2012/03/useradd-and-adduser-are-same-think.html\n\nA: It is because their shell is set to /bin/sh, and not /bin/bash. You can use the program chsh (CHange SHell) to change that user's shell. When you're logged in as that user, run:\nchsh /bin/bash\n\nI would recommend against editing /etc/passwd manually as you could accidentally enter a syntactically wrong line in to it (without realising), which might break logins for other users.\n\nA: While chsh gets the job done, just like one would modify several other aspects of a user, the usermod command is your friend:\nusermod -s /bin/bash user\nIt is the editing counterpart of useradd.\n\nA: When creating new users, you can specify the shell to use with the -s option.\nuseradd -m -s /bin/bash {username}\n\nNote: -m creates the home directory.\nHowever, if the user already exists, @Nachbars solution is the way to go:\nusermod -s /bin/bash {username}\n\n", "Q: Installing vim text editor on ubuntu just installed LAMP server and need to use vim editor to edit php.ini\nThe command sudo apt-get install vim gives me the following error:\nPackage 'vim' is not available but is refered to by another package.

Run\nsudo apt-get update\n\nto download the package database. Then try again.\nIf all else fails, maybe you can find further advice and newer versions to compile from source on www.vim.org.\n\nA: Vim is a powerful editor and should install with the command you gave in 12.04, 12.10 or 13.04.\nHowever you do not need vim.  There are other command line text editors available and I would suggest you use nano instead.  It is installed by default and while its not as powerful as vim it is much easier to learn.\nIf you have the desktop version of Ubuntu you can also use GUI based editors such as gedit.\n\nA: You don't necessarily need to use vim. The text editor nano would have come in Ubuntu by default. Using it from the CLI is the same as vim:\nnano /etc/path/to/php.ini\n\nIf you need vim itself, the vim-nox package should include vim:\nsudo apt-get install vim-nox\n\nThe GUI version of Vim should also include command-line version of vim. You can install it as follows:\nsudo apt-get install vim-gtk\n\nHope that helps.\n\nA: If vim is not in the source.list of your system you can use usually vi too.\nCheck here for the difference: What is the difference between Vi and Vim?\nAnd you have always the option to compile it yourself, eg. http://www.vim.org/download.php#unix\n", "Q: Problem on running shell script (how to NOT make it run from gedit) - Ubuntu 12.04 I want to run shell script or at least run it from terminal.

I also tried choosing 'run executable text files when they are opened' but both keep opening via gedit. \n\nA: In order to run a text file as executable from nautilus two things need to be set. Sounds like you have done the first already.\nThe second is that the file needs to be marked as executable. \nTo do this from nautilus right click on the file select \"properties\" \n\nthen on the \"Permissions\" tab select \"Allow executing file as program\". \n\nOr from the command line \nchmod +x file \n\nreplacing file with the file name. \n\nA: In a terminal window cd to the folder containing the shell script.\nMake sure the shell script is executable. Look for the \"x\" in the permissions:\nls -laF <filename>\n\nIf there isn't an \"x\" in the permissions type:\nchmod +x <filename>\n\nNow execute the script with a \"./\" which mean the files in my current directory:\n./<filename>\n\n", "Q: Memory doesn't make sense I just checked how much free space I have left on my hard disk using \n:~$ free -t\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:       4063056    1075744    2987312          0      65064     551704\n-/+ buffers/cache:     458976    3604080\nSwap:      4124668          0    4124668\nTotal:     8187724    1075744    7111980\n\nBut how is it possible that I have only 7 GB left while my hard disk is 320Gb?\nAlso, how can I make space easily and safe?\n\nA: free talks about RAM -- not hard disk space.\nHere, it says that you have 8GB total RAM, about 1GB RAM in use, and 7GB RAM free.\nIf you want a detailed breakdown of HDD usage, you can use df:\ndf -h\n\n(df stands for 'disk free' and h for 'human-readable).\n", "Q: How to find the window of a specific file in the multiple windows of Okular with multiple files open I use Okular to open, say 5, PDF files.\nNow I need to find one PDF file, say \"HelloWorld.pdf\"\nHowever, when I click the Okular icon, 5 small windows show up on the desktop.

I don't know if there's a comfortable mode for that. Couldn't think any adequate BTRFS option. \nUsing the pendrive without admin intervention is important. I considered having two partitions FAT32 + XFS, and using the later only in my own computers and fine-tuning by hand the ownership (haven't tried XFS pendrive mounting). But it seems a pain in the a** set-up.\nAny ideas? Has somebody done something like this? Thanks!\n\nA: I don't know if it offers anything over FAT32 except file sizes but I use NTFS when I need to meet all those conditions.\nI just created one in GParted and tested all the scenarios you mention and it seemed to work fine.  The recommendation is that once you do this you need to make sure you \"Safely eject\" on Windows machines, which I think may be more forgiving on FAT32.\n", "Q: Software Center Crash 13.04 I'm having problems with the Ubuntu Software Center, when I try to open it, after two seconds it closes.

Also you can read about Unix directory structure and basic commands for terminal, obviously (for example this). If you want to know more about Linux world, you have an entire documentation about GNU/Linux in http://www.tldp.org/\n\nA: The best way to learn about a particular terminal command is by reading its manual page, available via man command-name.\nTo figure out which commands you want to learn about, run apropos topic-keyword to list relevant commands.\nFor example, let's say you wanted to know how to reboot the system from the command line.

I just installed Xunbuntu about 2 days ago and have no experience with this OS.\nI know they are supposedly important, but I have a hardware issue that leaves them running into the gigabytes.\nMy partition is small so I don't have a whole lot of free space for these files.  In addition Im running Xunbuntu on a SSD so all this writing to the disk is annoying me.  So if I could prevent their creation, that would be great.\nFor the curious that must know the issue.  Im getting a nonstop log entry along the lines of \"iwl3945...Radio disabled by HW RF Kill switch\"\nEverything is operating fine.  LAN, WiFi, and Bluetooth all work as they should.  The log entries begin when I don't have a CAT5 cable connected or if I set the wifi hardware switch to the off position.  And even when I do have them connected I have to enter a web browser before they acknowledge and verify a connection to the internet before the writing stops.\nI can't have an always online connection with this computer.  It will probably spend more time offline.  I also like to turn off the wifi hard switch to conserve battery.\n\nA: If you really want to disable all logging:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type sudo stop rsyslog to stop the log daemon.\n\n*Create a file called /etc/init/rsyslog.override with a single line manual to stop the log daemon being automatically started at boot. You can do this with the following command:\necho manual|sudo tee --append /etc/init/rsyslog.override\n\nIf you ever want to undo this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type sudo start rsyslog to start the log daemon.\n\n*Delete the override file you created before, so that the log daemon is again started at boot. The command sudo rm -f /etc/init/rsyslog.override will do this for you.\n\n\nA: You could configure so there are no such log files. But it's better to just install the package logrotate and configure maximum size and number of log files you want to save.  So you could easy configure to have max size 100MB and 5 of them in /etc/logrotate.conf and/or add files to /etc/logrotate.d/.

The package manager will respect dependencies, but will only search the packages available on the command line.\nInstead of using a package manager to do the installation, it would be better to use a more Advanced Packaging Tool that has knowledge of a repository of packages that can be searched for the dependencies and list them on the command line along with the package you desire to install.  This is what apt does for you.

What is the replacement for ./configure on ubuntu 13.10?\n\nA: configure is a script (file) located in the source tree of a source distribution. There is no replacement for it in Ubuntu 13.10, if the source is the same it will still work.\nMake sure that you navigated to the source tree of a project. Example instructions that are still applicable:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download source.\nwget http://bumblebee-project.org/bumblebee-3.2.1.tar.gz\n\n\n*Extract source.\ntar xf bumblebee-3.2.1.tar.gz\n\n\n*Enter extracted source tree.\ncd bumblebee-3.2.1\n\n\n*Run the configure script:\n./configure --help\n\n", "Q: What accounts for the differing instructions on setting password for postgres? I'm following this blog post http://hendrelouw73.wordpress.com/2012/11/14/how-to-install-postgresql-9-1-on-ubuntu-12-10-linux/ to install postgres on ubuntu. These are steps two and three.\nSTEP 2: INSTALL POSTGRESQL ON YOUR SYSTEM\n\n\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install postgresql-9.1\n\nSTEP 3: CONFIGURE YOUR POSTGRESQL PASSWORD\n\nsudo -u postgres psql template1\nALTER USER postgres with encrypted password 'your_password';\n\nHowever, I'm also looking at a RailsCast which installs postgres on ubuntu. First, Ryan Bates does this\nroot@li349-144:~# apt-get install postgresql libpq-dev\n\nand then he sets a password like this\n    root@li349-144:~# sudo -u postgres psql\nterminal\npostgres=# \\password\nEnter new password: \nEnter it again:\n\nSo one big difference is in how the password is configured, in that the Railscast does not touch something called template described in Step 3 of the blogpost\nLooking at the instructions for installing postgres on ubuntu https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PostgreSQL, it is similar to Railscasts in that it doesn't have this reference to template to create the user\nCan you explain the difference and whether or not I should take this step?\n    STEP 3: CONFIGURE YOUR POSTGRESQL PASSWORD\nsudo -u postgres psql template1\nALTER USER postgres with encrypted password 'your_password';\n\n\nA: There is no real difference between the two methods. User/login roles and passwords are stored server-wide and not database-wide. In other words, the password is for connecting to the server, so it doesn't matter which database you connect to. The command\nsudo -u postgres psql template1 (Thanks to Daniel Vérité for the comment)\nin effect tells the system to switch to user postgres and run the CLI client (psql) to connect to the server and use the \"template1\" database. If no user and/or database name is specified, then psql tries to connect as the current user and \"to use\" a database with the same name as the current user (postgres in this case - which makes the \"template\" parameter superfluous)\nThis is what the above command is doing step by step:\nsudo -u postgres This switches to the postgres user. Notice the absence of the -p parameter from sudo. This is essential, because the \"os user postgres\" (who has no password and his sole purpose is to own the running server processes) is different from \"database user postgres\" (who is the database root user or rather the database administrator and absolutely needs a password.)\npsql --username=postgres --database=template1 This connects to localhost using database username postgres and database template1.  \nFor your purpose, this line can be abbreviated to \nsudo -u postgres psql\nALTER USER postgres with encrypted password 'your_password';\nThis will change to user postgres and connect to localhost as user postgres to the database named postgres and then set the password.\nIf you need further clarification please ask. I'll be happy to help.\nA brief note on template databases. When creating a new database, postgres uses a template named template1. This is something like the skeleton file used to set user default when creating user accounts in linux. It is usually modified by the dba to make sure certain tools and behaviors are enforced server-wide. But why the 1 you may ask. Well, there is another template database named template0 and it is a protected \"clean slate\" copy of template1 just in case something goes south with it. Here is a wiki page describing such a scenario. \n\nA: Do not do this..\nterminal\npostgres=# \\password\nEnter new password: \nEnter it again:\n\nYou're turning on a user you should not turn on. Instead, (a copy of my answer)\nConfiguring PostgreSQL\nThis is a copy of my original post here\nThere are two methods you can to configure. Both require creating a user and a database.\n\n\n*\n\n*Using createuser and createdb,\n$ sudo -u postgres createuser -s $USER\n$ createdb mydatabase\n$ psql -d mydatabase\n\n\n*Using the SQL administration commands, and connecting with a password over TCP\n$ sudo -u postgres psql postgres\n\nAnd, then in the psql shell\nCREATE ROLE myuser LOGIN PASSWORD 'mypass';\nCREATE DATABASE mydatabase WITH OWNER = myuser;\n\nThen you can login,\n$ psql -h localhost -d mydatabase -U myuser -p <port>\n\nIf you don't know the port, you can always get it by running the following, as the postgres user,\nSHOW port;\n\nOr,\n\n    $ grep \"port =\" /etc/postgresql/*/main/postgresql.conf\n\nSidenote: the postgres user\nI suggest NOT modifying the postgres user.\n\n\n*\n\n*It's normally locked from the OS. No one is supposed to \"log in\" to the operating system as postgres. You're supposed to have root to get to authenticate as postgres.\n\n*It's normally not password protected and delegates to the host operating system. This is a good thing. This normally means in order to log in as postgres which is the PostgreSQL equivalent of SQL Server's SA, you have to have write-access to the underlying data files. And, that means that you could normally wreck havoc anyway.\n\n*By keeping this disabled, you remove the risk of a brute force attack through a named super-user. Concealing and obscuring the name of the superuser has advantages.\n\n", "Q: how to list opened nautilus tabs with qdbus?

However, both fresh install and upgrades to 13.04 result in auth.log and other files being empty.

When I click on the  desktop icon, Ubuntu Software Center opens, and is frozen and shows a dimmed screen, and I have to kill the task in order to close it.\nHow I can fix the desktop icon?\n\nA: The root user has only a few programs under the home folder. Maybe it freezes while loading all of your installed programs. Try waiting a minute or two depending on the speed of your HD. If its your first time successfully running the program under your user name, you may have to wait longer in order for it to sync. Sometimes when I run soft-cen on my netbook it freezes while loading, but then recoveres because I have too many installed programs for such a weak CPU and slow HD.\n\nA: It is likely trying to update the cache or you possibly (but not likely) have a corrupt cache.\nTwo things you can try to do. 1) wait a while to see if it finishes or 2) open a terminal and run sudo apt-get update to give software-center a head start on updating the cache as it will still need to run a update when opened and it will download icons when opened as well.\n", "Q: Can I change my Ubuntu Desktop into a different flavour (like Kubuntu)? Can I convert Ubuntu into another form of Ubuntu like Kubuntu or Ubuntu Studio and the system recognize itself as the new form?\nUPDATE: After getting an answer and talking with people, I managed to gain a lot of information on this topic. I then wrote an article about converting between Ubuntu systems - Converting between the Ubuntus.\n\nA: The main difference between main Ubuntu, Xubuntu, Kubuntu, and Lubuntu is the Desktop Environment. You can install one of these DEs onto your system with the following commands:\nUbuntu:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nKubuntu:\nsudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop\n\nXubuntu:\nsudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop\n\nLubuntu:\nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop\n\nUbuntu GNOME:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-gnome-desktop\n\nFrom Ubuntu 17.10 GNOME became the default desktop environment/shell/manager.\nSo if you're running Ubuntu 17.10 forwards (including current 18.04), you can install the default desktop:\n$ sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop\n\nTo remove any of these, run the command that you used to install but instead ofinstall say purge (i.e., sudo apt-get purge kubuntu-desktop). Then you also need to run this command to complete the remove:\nsudo apt-get autoremove --purge\n\nThe autoremove command removes all the packages that were installed. The way these installs work is that there is one meta-package that just depends on every package that is required for that Desktop Environment. Thus the extra packages aren't removed when the meta package is, and you need to remove them with autoremove.\nThis will install the Desktop Environment and most programs for each of the flavors of Ubuntu, though sometimes there are programs that are not installed by this. An install switched by using these commands will not be the same as a clean install of the Ubuntu flavor, though it should be pretty close. There is also no limit as to having more then one of these Desktop Environments. I personally kept both ubuntu-desktop and ubuntu-gnome-desktop on my computer for a while just to compare. \nI do not know about a changing to/from a Ubuntu Studio install, though I am pretty sure it isn't as easy as just changing the Desktop Environment.\n\nA: You can also keep them all, and choose which one you want to log in to. That's a good way to compare, just switch every time you boot. Every file you're created will be in the same place, every application you installed for one flavor will be available in the others.\n\nA: Ubuntu Desktop Flavours\nhttps://www.ubuntu.com/download/flavours\nFlavours:\nDefault (Gnome (17.10 - present)) ubuntu-desktop \nBudgie (simple/elegant) budgie-desktop \nKubuntu (KDE Plasma) kubuntu-desktop \nKylin (elegant Chinese) ubuntukylin-desktop \nLubuntu (LXQt - light/fast) lubuntu-desktop \nMATE (GNOME 2 fork) ubuntu-mate-desktop \nStudio (Multimedia) ubuntustudio-desktop \nXubuntu (XFce - light/configurable) xubuntu-desktop \nInstall Alternative Desktop Flavour:\n(you can install multiple Desktop Flavours, then switch them as required)\nsudo apt install [flavour]\n\nExample:\nsudo apt install budgie-desktop\n\nReboot after installing new flavour, then choose that new Desktop Flavour by clicking the Ubuntu icon above the password field on the login screen.\nIf you want to remove old flavours, make sure you're logged into a session that's not using the flavour you want to remove, then:\nsudo apt remove --purge [flavour]\n\nExample:\nsudo apt remove --purge ubuntu-desktop\n\n\nA: To install MATE DE as in Ubuntu MATE use task package:\nsudo apt install ubuntu-mate-desktop^\n\n\nThe Unity desktop is installable since 18.04 LTS by\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-unity-desktop\n\n", "Q: Accidentally killed Unity; got it back, but now there's no window manager Today I was trying to resolve a longstanding annoyance, the fact that changes I make in CompizConfig Settings Manager do not persist after a reboot.  Googling around, I saw that this appears to be a current bug, but one person claimed to have fixed the issue by going into CCSM's Preferences, then changing \"GSettings Configuration Backend\" to \"Flat-file Configuration Backend\".\nThat seemed like a harmless enough thing to try, so I tried it.  Immediately after selecting the flat-file option, Unity died.  I was left with only the unadorned windows of programs I was running at the time.  I tried rebooting, but came back to a desktop with Unity still dead.  Fortunately one of my desktop icons is for my web browser, so I was able to start searching for a fix.\nAfter some fruitless twiddling in /etc/compizconfig, I was able to launch CCSM from the command line and reverted the option that had caused all the trouble, but Unity stayed dead.  Eventually I read that I needed to enable the Ubuntu Unity Plug-in.  I did so (not that I'd ever disabled it), and was asked if I wanted to enable various other plug-ins, to which I naturally agreed.  Another reboot later, Unity was back!  Sort of.  The launcher and desktop title bar (or whatever it's called) were back, but now whenever I start an application, the window appears in the upper-left corner of the screen, partially obscured by the launcher and title bar, and it doesn't sport any of the usual window manager dressing that would enable me to move it around, resize it, etc.\nAnd here I'm stuck.  Any help getting the rest of the way to a working desktop would be much appreciated.\n(Unity does seem awfully fragile.  Last week I tried to unmount my iPhone by right-clicking on its launcher icon and choosing \"Unmount,\" and that killed Unity too somehow.  In that case, however, a reboot brought it back.)\n\nA: Reading further down the askubuntu page referred to by DaboRoss above, I found the answer titled \"For Ubuntu 12.10 (Revised, again)\" which said to run the command\ndconf reset -f /org/compiz/\n\nThat worked, or at least nothing bad happened, but when I followed it with the next command\ncompiz --replace & disown\n\n...Unity crashed hard, again.  But this time, when I rebooted, everything was finally back to normal.\nMan.

Do you know how recent/which motherboard it is? If it is, a Windows 7 CD (perhaps borrow one if you don't have one) should autofix the boot record (it auto-detects on CD launch) and then you can use EasyBCD to add an Ubuntu boot record via their \"Auto-detection\" EFI loader.\nIf it's not UEFI, this answer may not help.

If you don't regularly back up, this is a great time to start, whether you continue and install Ubuntu or not. To do this, you need a second hard drive, because you need someplace to copy your files to, someplace off your computer's hard drive for the copies to sit, safe from any disaster that might befall your computer or its hard drive. There is really no other way, short of subscribing to a cloud backup service.\nAssuming you're going on to install Ubuntu and keep your current OS (Windows? I can't tell because you talk of saving your OS and formatting your hard drive. You wouldn't want to do both.), you should find a Windows backup solution that works for you.

If you want to force the system to mount that specific partition to your previous place then I recommend reading answers like this one which mention editing the fstab file and adding the appropriate information to mount a partition in a specific place.\nI recommend consulting the manual: man fstab.\nAn example (Do not apply this) would be:\n   /dev/sdb1      /media/A6505A54505A2B11   ext4   defaults   0   0\n\nThis would mount the sdb1 device in /media/A6505A54505A2B11 with several parameters like assuming it has an ext4 filesystem.\n", "Q: How to set NetBeans as a default editor in FileZilla When I open any php, html, or css files FileZilla opens them in GEdit.

I've installed it by executing sudo apt-get install php5-dev.\nI wanted to know if there was a way to just install phpize only.\n\nA: The php5-dev package contains various files absolutely essential to compiling PHP. Since it's a shell script, you can just copy it from the package, but it won't work without the dependencies for building a PHP extensions (like header files).\nExplanation\nIn the C world, compiling dynamically linked libraries (DLL/SO) is done by using header files that contain the description on how the libraries are to be interacted with (function calls, structures, etc). These are used to compile an extension without the need for the PHP source code itself. In other words, you don't need the PHP source but you actually need the header files which are contained in php5-dev.\n", "Q: When I run Nautilus or Guake from awesome wm the wallpaper is reverted to my Unity background I'm using awesome wm on a ubuntu 12.04.

(However, you can disable IPv6. See below.)\nExplanation:\nIPv6 doesn't use ARP to find which MAC address belongs to which IP, it uses the Neighbor Discovery Protocol. As a core concept, the NDP works over IP, not over Ethernet frames, so it needs an IP address to communicate. That's the \"fe80\" link-local address.\nSolution:\nIf you don't want to use IPv6 at all, I suggest you blacklist the IPv6 module in the Linux kernel by adding the following line to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf:\nblacklist ipv6\n\nAfter a restart all your IPv6 addresses should be gone.\nHowever, if you do plan on using IPv6, I suggest you seriously read up on it, otherwise you will be in a world of pain and security issues.\n", "Q: Change screen resolution detection timeout I'm using a KVM switch for using two laptops.\nOne is connected to Ubuntu 12.10.\nThe problem I have, is that every time I switch to the other PC, Ubuntu changes the resolution back to the integral laptop monitor.\nWhen I switch back to work again with Ubuntu, I have to wait ~5 seconds until the screen resolution is detected again.\nI figured out, the once I'm back on Ubuntu, if I open System Settings->Displays. it changes to the correct resolution instantly.\nThere's must be some sort of timeout that occurs that forces resolution change.\nCan i configure this timeout value somewhere ?\nUpdates: problem occurs also on Ubuntu 12.04, and on PC (not laptop)\n\nA: Hard coding xorg.conf is the usual way to sort out these kinds of issues.

I have a Dell inspiron 5521 laptop with 4GB RAM 1TB hard-disk with windows 8 pro genuine. My hard-disk includes 4 partition (including c drive): In 4th partition, which is of 71 GB, I want to install ubuntu 13.04 (alongside with windows 8- dual boot), but whenever I try to install with the helpof bootable usb, it shows only 1 harddisk: no partitions, and another option \"Erase all and install ubuntu\" which I don't prefer. How can i install Ubuntu alongside Windows 8?\n\nA: It seems that your Ubuntu cannot see any partitions. This is probably due to the new UEFI and the GUID Partitioning Scheme. Some Windows 8 machines also include a \"secure boot\" feature which makes installing Ubuntu much harder. Is your drive encrypted?\nUEFI, or EFI, is a firmware interface that is widespread on recent computers, especially those more recent than 2010. It is intended to replace the traditional BIOS firmware interface that is prevalent on earlier machines.\nMake sure that you are using the 64-bit version of Ubuntu. Also, in the Allocate Drive Space menu, press the button which says Something Else. This will allow you to modify the partitions.\nIf all else fails, you might want to consider using GNU Parted. After booting up, press the Try Ubuntu button, and open up the application called gparted or Partition Manager. This program does support GPT and will allow you to see those partitions.\n", "Q: How to extend ubuntu partition size?

I'd like to configure the GNU Mailutils mail program so that it operates on an already existing maildir directory. Currently my mailutils.rc looks like this:\nmailbox{\n        mailbox-pattern \"maildir:///home/${user}/Maildir\";\n        mailbox-type maildir;\n}\n\nThis allows me to read mail from that folder, but nevertheless, the mail program always moves all opened mails to /home/${user}/mbox. Is there a way to tell mail to keep the files at their original position?\n\nA: I was able to reproduce your problem with GNU Mailutil's mail. I did not find a direct answer to your question, but found a solution to your problem. \nI suppose you configured your local MTA (Exim) so that new mail is delivered to $HOME/Maildir/, i.e. your Exim configuration is set to dc_localdelivery='maildir_home'. \nInstall heirloom-mailx which provides a replacement of mailx and offers more functionality than GNU Mailutil's version of mailx. Make sure it is the actual provision of mailx in the alternatives config. Usually it is, because heirloom has the highest priority. You can check that like this: \njb@x60 ~ $ sudo update-alternatives --config mailx\nThere are 2 choices for the alternative mailx (providing /usr/bin/mailx).\n\n  Selection    Path                     Priority   Status\n------------------------------------------------------------\n* 0            /usr/bin/heirloom-mailx   60        auto mode\n  1            /usr/bin/heirloom-mailx   60        manual mode\n  2            /usr/bin/mail.mailutils   30        manual mode\n\nPress enter to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number:\n\nConfigure mailx with the environment variable $MAIL. Since this configuration implies that mail is delivered for all users to their respective local Maildir I suppose this is the most elegant way to do this:\nx60 ~ # echo 'export MAIL=$HOME/Maildir/' > /etc/profile.d/local_mailx.sh\n\nNo need to chmod 755 this file, since it will be sourced by the login shell. However you need to log off and on in order to let environment variable changes take effect. \nProof of concept:\njb@x60 ~ $ grep dc_localdelivery /etc/exim4/update-exim4.conf.conf\ndc_localdelivery='maildir_home'\njb@x60 ~ $ echo $MAIL\n/home/jb/Maildir/\njb@x60 ~ $ mail jb\nSubject: test \ntest\n.\nEOT\njb@x60 ~ $ mail\nHeirloom mailx version 12.5 6/20/10.

Question remains: Do you need to stick with GNU Mailutil's mailx? I doubt so.

Because of a problem reported here, possibly a bug, I have to use LibreOffice 3.5. \nBut I would like to keep an eye on the latest version, which might even solve that problem.\nI would like to use the latest 4.x version beside 3.5. (not in a virtual box or in wine)\n\nThat is: I have already installed 3.5 from a deb package. How to install now the 4.x version without conflicts?\nI imagine I could uninstall 3.5 and put 4.0 in place and then try to install 3.5 separately. But how?\n\nA: This is based on this tutorial, recommended by Glutanimate in a comment to the question for making a 'local' installation of a specific version.\nI will consider only the case of the deb files package (there are multiple such files archived in a package).\n\n\n*\n\n*To get the latest versions go here.\n\n*To get other versions go here. (I found about this address from here.)\n\n*Unpack the archive. You'll get a folder, and in it another called 'DEBS' with many deb files.\n\n*Create a folder called 'install' (optional name) inside the 'DEBS' folder. \n\n*Open a terminal window inside the 'install' folder. In that terminal, run: \nfor i in ../*.deb; do dpkg-deb -x $i . ; done\nA new folder named \"opt\" is thus created there with several other folders and files that contain the entire LibreOffice installation.\nIf you don't want your existing LO configuration to be affected by the parallel installation you will have to change the user profile location of the new install. \nTo do so open up the bootstraprc file located at ./install/opt/libreoffice/program/ in a text editor. You might have to change the file permissions first to be able to read and write to the file (right click on file → Properties → Permissions). Then change the UserInstallation entry to:\nUserInstallation=$ORIGIN/..\n\nTo run Writer find and execute something like DEBS/install/opt/libreoffice4.0/program/swriter. The others (sdraw, smath, scalc, simpress etc) are in the same directory.\n\nIn this way, multiple versions of LibreOffice can be used in parallel, even opened at the same time.\n\nA: For that to work i suggest you compile it by hand. That way you can use the stable 3.5 version and the bleeding-edge 4.x version. So you install the stable version with using apt and the new one using the repo.\nTake a look at this guide.\nJust be sure to checkout the right tag of libreoffice-core for the version you want to build. \nIt is important to add the --prefix=<some-folder> argument to the autogen.sh command, to prevent conflicts with the current installation. For example : \n./autogen.sh --prefix=/home/username/my_progs\nGood luck!\n\nA: It does not look like the LibreOffice packages natively support multiple versions installed concurrently. It may sound like overkill, but the simplest, most maintainable option is probably to install the 4.x version inside a VirtualBox guest Ubuntu system. That way you would have access to both versions without having to worry about compiling and re-compiling as new 4.x versions are released.\n\nA: The Document Foundation wiki contains a dedicated help page for installing multiple versions of LibreOffice:\n\n\n*\n\n*see the specific instructions for Linux systems (including Debian-based, i.e. Ubuntu);\n\n*or the generic page, which includes links to detailed instructions for Windows, OSX, and Linux.\n\n\nI understand that \"link-only\" answers are frowned upon, but better to point to that documentation (which will be refreshed), than provide a dubious copy/paste here (which could readily go stale).\n\nA: Another imo simpler way of having different versions of Libreoffice installed alongside, is to install one version using apt and the other one using snap. Whit this approach I have now LO 6.4.6 vía apt and LO 7.0.4.2 via snap.\nlucas@lucas:~$ apt list libreoffice -a\nListing...

The python script log information in a /var/log file. On that python script, I only make a fork. But when I check the forks like says in the Upstart doc [2], the method says that I do twice forks.\nWith that all, the start job is executed correctly, but the pid showed with the  upstart my-daemon status isn't the same that is in the log file. The error appears when I try to stop doing status my-daemon stop.

For future readers, let's summarize the issue and the fix.\nIssue: Running a forking python from a bash script from Upstart job does not get tracked correctly.\nProblem: expect fork or expect daemon does not fix the issue.\nSolution: Fix the script. Options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Switch from exec /usr/bin/my-bash-wrapper to directly calling python exec python /path/to/script (as demonstrated in comments above)\n\n*Fix the bash script. Having a bash script with example contents of \n\n#!/bin/bash\n\npython /path/to/script\n\n\nhas the issue of python getting executed separately from bash with a new process id. Thus it is ignored by Upstart as it is just a command parented by the Bash script. Adding expect daemon does not help as it is ignored in the first place.\nUsing bash script is possible the same way you fixed it in the Upstart script. Prefixing python call with exec makes the python run with same PID as the bash, which is tracked by Upstart. Then expect fork catches the fork() in the Python script, and Upstart is happily tracking the right process. \nSo, using a bash wrapper of:\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\nexec python /path/to/script\n\n\ndoes the same thing.\n", "Q: How to remove folding application when pressing alt-tab in 13.04?

Some of my scripts produce notifications which dont auto-hide, you have to click them.\nI'd like to have a keyboard shortcut instead of having to click each and every one.\n\nA: There is no such shortcut. Even then, the notification interface does not expose a DBus call to revoke all open notifications.\nHowever, you can speedily dispose all by killing the notification process:\nQuick and dirty:\nAssign the shortcut of your liking to:\npkill xfce4-notifyd\n\nSophisticated and nerdy:\nAsk it to terminate gracefully:\n\ndbus-send --session --type=method_call --dest=org.freedesktop.Notifications \\\n                   /org/freedesktop/Notifications \\\n                   org.xfce.Notifyd.Quit\n\n\n\nOr maybe put the above in your scripts.\nNote: Ending the xfce4-notifyd process is not an issue because the next invocation of a notification will start the process. It will even self-terminate when there is nothing to display for some time.\n", "Q: Standard install procedure for PHP 5.3 without Suhosin? Is there a standard way to install PHP 5.3 without Suhosin?\nHow would doing so affect tracking of routine updates for precise?\nIf it's going to make life complicated now or in future then I might just leave it there.\n\nA: Probably not. Suhosin is considered standard for PHP 5.3.\nUsing 5.3 without a hardening patch isn't recommended at all, and Suhosin is considered the de facto standard due to its binary compatibility.\nAdditionally, Precise is the last version running 5.3, so any version you upgrade to will have a fairly major future version of PHP. Since it sounds like you're on LTS releases, this may not be an issue for another year, but it will inevitably come into play.\nIf you still want to have 5.3 without Suhosin, you're very likely going to need to compile it yourself. It is possible to set it up so that apt/dpkg track dependencies (see this question for more details), but if apt sees you're running an older version of PHP than it has in the repos, it may try to update you, which will include Suhosin.\nAlternatively, you could upgrade to 5.4, which has at least upstream standard repos without Suhosin. I think Ubuntu's repos have done the same and released 5.4 without Suhosin. At the very least, the Debian and Arch teams have declared Suhosin \"upstream dead,\" so even if Ubuntu still has it, you should be able to pull straight from Debian, or possibly port the Arch one.\n", "Q: re-installing Squid proxy I have installed squid proxy in my Ubuntu system.

I currently have two partitions, Windows 8 in installed on one, and i have some important files in another partition. While installing ubuntu, if I chose \"Replace Windows 8 with Ubuntu\", do I lose the other partition too? \nAnd are there other ways to leave the other partition as it is, and install ubuntu in the partition  where windows was installed.\n\nA: You will be able to choose in which partition you want to install Ubuntu. If you have a \"file partition\" where  you keep all your files, this should not be affected. If you are not sure, you can always run ubuntu from a flashdrive in live mode, make sure everything works fine from  there and load Gparted (use the dash search and the program will already be there). Gparted will give you greater control over the partitions.\nHope it helps. \n\nA: Update for Ubuntu 18.04 and above\nNew installations of recent versions of Ubuntu does not use a separate swap partition any more. They use a swap file by default.\nOriginal Answer\nIf you choose \"Replace Windows 8 with Ubuntu\" it will format the whole physical drive and you will lose your data partition! See: How do I recover my accidentally lost Windows partitions after installing Ubuntu? for an example of someone who made this mistake.\nTo do what you want, you have to take matters in your own hand and choose \"Something Else...\"\nThis choice will let you choose which partition to delete and reformat. A slip of your finger may cost your data. Make two backups in external media before going any farther.\nThe partition structure used by Ubuntu is different from Windows. You will need at least two partitions, the root (also known as /) and the swap, to run Ubuntu properly. The root is to be ext4 format with mount point / and the swap has its own format and requires no mount point. Creating a separate partition in ext4 format with mount point /home is also a good idea. This is the rough equivalent to Windows data partition. It needs to be in ext4 format as it keeps your personal configuration files as well, and those need specific permissions.\nSee partitioning suggestions for some details on Ubuntu specific partitions.\nSee Does it make sense to create swap partitions for new installations nowadways?\nAlso see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PartitioningSchemes\nHope this helps\n", "Q: share home files but not preferences I would like to know if it is possible to make a symbolic link between the home folders of two users so they both have access to documents, audio, photos, etc ... read and write, but actually have their own physical home folders for personal preferences... \nHere is why I want this: I am running Ubuntu Gnome on my MacBook 13\".

You could change one side's shortcut so that they don't conflict anymore (I don't think anything, other than virtual machines and Microsoft remote desktop products -- which I can't see fit -- could completely hook up the keyboard)\nIf you could hook the keyboard input of the program and made it get the input of the X server itself, then yes, that's a more complicated way of alleviating the conflict.\n", "Q: /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.19' not found I'm building a program in a VM then deploying to another machine.

You'll probably be forced into recompilation and reinstallation of a number of dependent packages as well to make this work.

I'd like to prevent any of my Terminator terminals from being smaller than 80x24. That is, I'd be prevented from resizing a terminal to below that size, and if I tried to split a terminal that would be too small, either the existing terminals would be shrunk to fit or the parent and child terminals would be moved to a new window.\nI'm willing to change terminal programs if needed, although a good tiling solution like Terminator's is preferable.\n\nA: To accomplish what you want, you'll have to edit the source code for gnome-terminal and rebuild it yourself, as the minimum window size is hard-coded into the terminal application. To do this, follow these steps.\nFirst, go to https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-terminal/3.6.1-0ubuntu4 and download the source files (the file is gnome-terminal_3.6.1.orig.tar.xz). Download this to your ~/Downloads folder.\nThen, open a terminal and type the following commands: \ncd ~/Downloads\ntar -xJf gnome-terminal_3.6.1.orig.tar.xz\nThis will extract the source. Now, open up your favourite text editor and edit the file ~/Downloads/gnome-terminal-3.6.1/src/terminal-window.c. Navigate to line 3107, where you will find the variables MIN_WIDTH_CHARS and MIN_HEIGHT_CHARS. Edit these, these are the minimum height and width of your terminal window expressed in characters (i.e. a MIN_WIDTH_CHARS of 20 will mean that you can no longer resize the width of the window to below 20 character widths)\nThen, to build, in a terminal type cd ~/Downloads/gnome-terminal-3.6.1. Then, run  ./configure to generate the makefile (if it complains about any missing packages, install them using apt-get (e.g. if it says \"package foo not found\" or similar, use sudo apt-get install foo). You can also try installing auto-apt and using sudo auto-apt run ./configure (this will attempt to install all dependencies), but when I tried this it didn't quite catch everything (run standard ./configure afterwards) This may take a few attempts, depending on how many packages are missing.\nOnce it has generated the makefiles simply type make, followed by sudo make install. This should rebuild the terminal program.\nClose all terminal windows, and then the next one you start will respect the minimum size you set in the source (i.e. will not resize below the values you defined there).\n\nA: *\n\n*Press the super key to open the search lens and look for: main menu\n\n*Once the \"Main Menu\" application is running select \"Accessories\" on\nthe left menu and then select \"Terminal\" on the second menu.\n\n*Once you have the \"Terminal\" options is selected press the\n\"Properties\" button on the right. A new window will open with the\nterminal Launcher properties.\n\n*Go to the \"Command\" entry and add this to the end of the entry:\n--geometry=132x24\n\nThe finished entry should be:\ngnome-terminal --geometry=132x24\n\nThat's it. Close the windows and next time you launch the terminal the window will be resized. You may have to logout and log back in to work properly.\n(132x24 is just an example, you can use whatever resolution you want)\n\nA: Well, as far as I know, you can't, the resolution of a Terminal window is based on the proportions of the characters... So if you change the size of the font, the Terminal window will resize to fit the proportion of that font...\nIt sounds a bit silly at first, but given that a terminal simply displays only text characters, it makes sense, if a window is sized by pixels, you'd often end up with wasted space when the size of the window doesn't exactly match a character boundary...\n\nA: If you're in an older version of Ubuntu, in the right click -> properties window, the first tab has two fields in which you can edit the rows and columns of the terminal.\nOtherwise, you can use the command-input referred to in answer one.\n--geometry=132x24\n\n\nA: The little trick about default size was topic here. There, user viscount solved it by creating a script and place it in /usr/bin/gnome-terminal like this (I assume you use gnome as window-manager):\n#!/bin/sh\ngnome-terminal --geometry=132x24\n\nYou also can right click on the gnome-terminal icon on your task bar, select properties, then change there the command to different command like:\ngnome-terminal --working-directory=%f --geometry=132x24\n\nThis way you have your own-defined default-size.\n\nA: Have a look here:\nChange default width of gnome-terminal and terminator windows\nHopefully it helps.\n", "Q: How do I troubleshoot boot problems when stuck at the Ubuntu splash screen? I was tweaking some settings on my Ubuntu 12.04 install. Specifically I was altering the default color scheme of the terminal, following these instructions\nNow whenever I boot Ubuntu, I get stuck in the purple screen that says \"Ubuntu\" with the moving dots. If I hit ENTER Ubuntu booting continues.\nI'm not asking about solving my specific problem (which is definitely caused my be doing weird things) instead I'm asking how would I go about digging into what's going on at boot? What logs should I look at? What kind of thing should I look for? How would I troubleshoot this issue? I would like to \"learn how to fish\" and go figure out what is probably a stupid issue.\nI tried the boot repair utility, however that does not appear to do the trick. Boot repair appears to be focussed more on GRUB, which is functioning fine.\n\nA: There's a few things you can try.  First, if I were you, I'd like to know what's happening in the background (booting in) that causes you to have to hit Enter to get it to continue on.\nTry editing your GRUB load manually, so you can see what's happening during the boot and provide the error/issue that's actually happening in more detail.  In a terminal window, run:\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nFind this line:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nand change it to:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"\"\n\nLeave anything else within the quotes as-is, but remove the quiet splash portion.\nThen, do, in terminal:\nsudo update-grub\n\nThen, finally just reboot.

Generally I have noticed that plugging in a new device in a Linux system causes a new entry to be listed in /dev (assuming you have the correct drivers).\nFor example:\n\n\n*\n\n*When you plug in a new hard drive you get /dev/sdb.\n\n*When you plug in a serial device you get /dev/ttyS0.\n\n\nWhen I plug in an Ethernet device, why don't I get something like /dev/eth0?\nIs there a device listing for Ethernet ports? \nI know you can see port names using ifconfig, I am just wondering if something shows up in /dev too.\n\nA: It's a good question. The reason is essentially historical; different groups with different goals and priorities added pieces of Unix over time, and the differences among various APIs are a reflection of this history.  I think the original device file concept goes back to Bell Labs, whereas network sockets were added later at UC Berkeley. Bell was trying to create a nice clean maintainable paradigm for AT&T's operations, whereas Berkeley needed to add internet features that didn't fit easily into that paradigm. Technically it would be possible to go back and create a /dev/eth0 file today (see below), but it would involve rewriting a prohibitive amount of legacy code.\nSlight OT: If the subject interests you, consider taking a look at Plan 9, which took \"everything is a file\" to greater extremes (just don't expect it to have very many modern, usable applications):\nhttp://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/plan9.html\n\nmany facilities that under Unix are accessed through various ad-hoc interfaces like BSD sockets, fcntl(2), and ioctl(2) are in Plan 9 accessed through ordinary read and write operations on special files analogous to device files\n\n\nA: Hello nowadays the /dev directory is populated by udev, a daemon that reads the /sys directory, and create those files. If you want to use fdisk and gdisk, you are forced to use devices found in /dev. And to see the the tty and pty used. I think BSD allocates an ethernet interface in /dev, where you can write and read to.\n\nA: Not so long ago Ethernet devices did appear as /dev/eth0, /dev/eth1 and so on. There are still applications that expect to find them there, but are now disappointed and sometimes unusable. Fortunately not too many.\n", "Q: Manage production and development enviroment Ubuntu 12.04 We are using Ubuntu 12.04 in our Production environment. This server hosts Apache, MYSQL and PHP for our corporate websites. We have 7 websites currently deployed using virtual hosts.\nLooking for a solution on how to replicate or push changes onto our production machine by using a development machine.\nOur main goal is to let web developers make their changes on our \"development\" server and then we can push the changes onto our \"production\" environment. Basically the /var/www/* files and MYSQL databases. \nI already have a clone of our production environment setup in our development environment.  \nAny suggestions or help would be greatly appreciated. \n\nA: Since I did not receive any feedback, here are the steps we took:\n1) We duplicated our production linux webserver using vRanger. \nIf you do not have Vranger license, you can probably get away with using vMware workstation and duplicate the vmdk file. (I have not tested this process)\n2) Powered on the copy of our production gave it a different IP address.\n3) Since both our Production server and our Staging server are identical I used RSYNC to manually sync since changes when necessary. \nHere is a sample of the command: \nsudo rsync –avh /var/www/sites/ root@192.168.1.1:/var/www/sites/\n\nHere is an explanation of the command above:\n**sudo** = temporary gain privilege to execute the command\n**rsync** = utility to synchronize data between two different server/folders\n**-avh** = commands for rsync – a = archive – v = verbose – h = human readable format of file sizes\n-**/var/www/sites** = source (our staging server - server we are pushing changes from)\n**-root@192.168.1.1:/var/www/sites** = destination of where the files are being copied to (production server)\n\n4) We purchased a tool called SQLyog there are different pricing modules and features depending on what you need it for.\nhttps://www.webyog.com/\nThere are freeware tools too for example Toad for MySQL 6.7 Freeware (had a hard time using it)http://www.toadworld.com/products/toad-for-mysql/default.aspx\nWhat both of these tools accomplish is if you are running multiple MYSQL databases like us, we can view the MySQL changes made in our staging environment and push the changes to our production environment. \nYou can push changes using MYSQL using the command line as an option too (using mysql dump).

But I need to apparently partition this Windows Professional drive...manually.\nHow can I get this done?\nAny guidance, links, etc. would be greatly appreaciated.\n\nA: If the partitioning tool does not work from the installer, then yes, you will have to do manual partitioning.\nBoot into windows, defragement your hard drive. Next resize your windows C: drive, leave the remaining space as free space.\nThen boot the Ubuntu live CD and install Ubuntu into the free space. At that point, the installer should automatically make the partitions needed. If not, make a swap partition the size of your RAM + 512 Mb.

Therefore, whenever Steam tries to load something that needs Flash, it borks completely.\nHere's a link to the solution on Steam Support: Using Flash on 64-bit Distributions.\nFor future reference, you want to be as detailed as possible whenever asking for help on AskUbuntu.

I'd imagine the best strategy is either of the following:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Clear it with specific CUPS commands.  Unfortunately there's not a builtin command to clear the cache; only enabling/disabling specific\n  print queues and removing specific print jobs seem to be\n  available.Use lpq (to view the queues), lprm, and\n  cancel, or the web interface, to view current jobs and remove\n  them.  cancel -a should cancel all jobs on all queues.If\n  your system is hosed by defined printers and queues, deleting those\n  objects may help.  Use lpadmin or the web interface to manage\n  defined printers.\n  \n*Clear it manually, by:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*stopping CUPS (eg, sudo service cups stop),\n  \n*removing files manually, and\n  \n*restarting CUPS (eg, sudo service cups start).\n  \n  \n  \n  This long thread suggests that /var/spool/cups contains\n  completed print jobs while /var/spool/cups/tmp contains in-progress\n  jobs. One post to that thread suggests running sudo rm -r\n  /var/spool/cups in step 2.2 above.  Steps 2.1 and 2.3 show Ubuntu\n  commands for stopping and starting services; other OS's will vary.\nIf you really need to delete cache files in /var/cache/cups, you\n  will probably need to use the manual method.\n\nAnd the second one is this: https://askubuntu.com/a/303604/153260\n\nWell, I posted it as a comment, but I will post it as a answer.\nMaybe deleting the printer will reset the stack and solve the error.\nMy computer system is in Spanish, but the icons are very clear to do the steps\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Go to System Configuration -> Printers \n  \n*Delete the printer that is having the error \n  \n*Unplug the printer an plug it again to configure it as a new printer\n  \n*Try to print\n  \n\n", "Q: Can't open Firefox after upgrade to 13.04 I just upgraded my 12.10 to 13.04 with \"great\" difficulty, but a few issues persist. \nFirefox refuse even to open when I click the icon.

What are other differences I may run into? \n\nA: If you're trying to run a virtual environment as similar to AWS as possible, then the easiest thing to do is to use the exact images that you'd boot on EC2.  Ubuntu \"cloud images\" are made available for download at http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/releases/.\nThe \"cloud images\" are pretty much vanilla Ubuntu Server installs with the cloud-init package added.  In 12.04, they also have a 'ubuntu' user already added, but in 12.10 and beyond, cloud-init creates that user on first boot.\nFor information on how to use the images outside of a cloud, see wiki doc, or a blog post that I wrote.\n", "Q: Control VLC with bluetooth headset I have the S305 Motorola bluetooth headset.

Can anyone help?\n\nA: Ubuntu 13.04 (64bit for your UEFI machine) comes with a working alx driver for ethernet and rtl8723 driver for wireless.  You don't have to build anything to get networking anymore. I have no direct experience with the 32 bit distribution, but since they are build from the same sources, I'd expect that the drivers would be present there too.

I am running many servers off of my computer and I need to port forward to do that.  But recently my IPv4 Address keeps changing when I shut my computer off and turn it back on.  I have no clue why this is happening.  \n\nA: I see two options.\nYour computer is connected to a local network\nThis is true if your ip address starts with one of:\n\n\n*\n\n*10.x.x.x\n\n*192.168.x.x\n\n*172.16.x.x\n\n*172.17.x.x\n...\n\n*172.31.x.x\n\n\nYour computer is connected directly to the internet\nThis is probably bad and you should change it. It's common practice to put your server behind a dedicated firewall and on a local network. This makes it more convenient to manage and secure your computers.\nQ: How do you get an ip address?\nA: You ask for one.\nThere is a computer connected to your network that runs ip-address-assigning software, aka a dhcp server. Your computer asks it for an ip address. The dhcp server says \"here's an ip address, but you can only have it for so many minutes.\" Every time your minutes are up, your computer renegotiates the agreement. We call this agreement a dynamic lease.\nOne way to almost always get the same ip address is to always renew the lease as soon as it expires. But if you turn your computer off, the dhcp server will forget you ever had a lease. (some dhcp servers forget sooner than others). Also, this is kinda like trying to ride the same ride at Disneyland over and over without waiting. If you get to, it's not cause you're special, there's just no one else at the park.\nAnother way is to configure the dhcp server to always give your computer the same ip address (called a static lease). If you're on a local network, and it's your local network, you can do it for free. You'll just need to know how. If you're on a public network (ie, the internet), you'll want to talk to whoever you're paying for the connection. They'll probably want more money.\nHow I've had the same public ip address for ages without paying for it\nI have a local network. I have a router that handles the local network. It's connected to a dsl modem, which is the box that actually makes the connection to the internet. The dsl modem is what gets the public ip address. That modem is almost never offline. When it is, it's for a reboot, which happens pretty fast. So far, fast enough to always lease the same ip address. But, like I've already said, it's a gamble. There's nothing to guarantee I get the same ip address, and if for some reason I get leased a different one, no one at my ISP is going to care (until I pay for the privilege of a never-changing ip address).\n\nA: You probably don't have a static IP. Ask your ISP if you need one, many ISPs do not give you static IP unless you pay for it specifically.\n\nA: It sounds like you have a dynamic IP address. Talk to your ISP to get a static IP. Be warned: they cost a lot more! (usually)\n", "Q: Game Development with Accomplishments Hey could game developers make accomplishments for game players to earn forever who buys games from the Ubuntu Software Center?\n\nA: Yes, you can create accomplishments for games. From The Guide to Creating Your Accomplishments (emphasis added):\n\nQ: Why would I want to create accomplishments?\n...\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Because you want a new application to be supported by Accomplishments System (for example: a new game).\n  \n*Because you want to create a new collection of accomplishments designed for your community.\n  \n\nSee the Accomplishments wiki/documentation for more details, including how the accomplishments system recognises an accomplishment as being acheived (you write a Python script for each accomplishment).

I did my research to make sure that it would work. I found the following websites, and this is what led me to believe that it would work without any issues, despite the fact that it is a USB 2.0 device:\nhttp://community.linuxmint.com/hardware/view/12511\nhttp://geardiary.com/2011/06/28/revi...hone-yeti-pro/\nSo- I got it out and plugged it in. The red light on the mute button lit up and started flashing, which means that the Mic is muted. I un-muted it- so far, so good. I went to the sound settings menu. It was recognized as: Digital Input (S/PDIF) BLUE USB Audio 2.0 and BLUE USB Audio 2.0 Analog Stereo. I tried to select them, one at a time as the input device. Each time I tried to select it, the sytem settings would crash and shut off.\nThen, I tried to select it using JACK instead. In Jack, I was able to select it as the input device without issue. I fired up the JACK server and didn't get loads of xruns, so I opened Ardour. I couldn't get signal flowing in to Ardour no matter what I tried. Now It's getting frustrating. I shut off the JACK server and decided to try something else. So next I open a terminal and fire up\nalsamixer\nand got similar results, the microphone is recognized and I selected it as the sound capture device. The levels look good so I open Audacity and select the microphone as the capture device in Audacity. The same thing happened- no audio signal was getting in to the computer.\nSo, I decided to try installing and running\npavucontrol\n\n. The microphone is recognized. Great. I can select it. Great. I fire up audacity again and the same thing happens- no audio signal to the computer. The next thing I tried was killing pulse and just using ALSA. I tried bothpactl exit\nand\npulseaduio --kill\n\nand try selecting the microphone again with alsamixer- same result each time, no signal to the computer.\nAt this point, I'm really frustrated. I tried making sure of the the dumb stuff, like \"is it plugged in\" and \"maybe I should try the other USB ports\". No dice. I tried the direct headphone monitor on the mic to see if it's picking up sound at all, and it is. I'm completely baffled. when I run\nlsusb\n\nin a terminal I get the following output:\nBus 001 Device 002: ID 8087:0024 Intel Corp.

At least that's some information. Then I rancat /proc/asound/cards\n\nand got the following output:\n0 [PCH            ]: HDA-Intel - HDA Intel PCH\n                  HDA Intel PCH at 0xdfc00000 irq 52\n1 [B20            ]: USB-Audio - BLUE USB Audio 2.0\n                  BLUE BLUE USB Audio 2.0 at usb-0000:00:1d.0-1.2, high speed\n\nAlso, when I open the System Settings from the Terminal with gnome-control-center I get the following output with regard to audio:\n(gnome-control-center:3593): sound-cc-panel-WARNING **: active_output_update - couldn't find a stream from the supposed active output\n(gnome-control-center:3593): sound-cc-panel-WARNING **: active_input_update - couldn't find a stream from the supposed active input\n\nWhen I try to select my microphone, the System Settings Window still closes and I get this in the terminal:\nSegmentation fault\n\nMaybe there's something useful there? \nSo- that's what I've got. A pretty sweet microphone that would be a really useful tool if it worked. I thought it would, and it doesn't. I am completely perplexed and don't know what I should do next. Does anyone have any ideas or advice? \n\nA: Since posting this question I have found a solution! \nWhen Using JACK and Bitwig studio on 14.04, I was still getting the same behavior. It worked the first time, but was automatically muted for capture on subsequent reboots.  I am able to unmute the capture card using QasHctl now, where I was not able to do so in the Ubuntu Sound Settings Menu or Alsamixer.  \nThat's it.  Just unmute the Yeti Pro Capture card in QasHctl.

I am downloading Ubuntu and I really want to play Windows games from Steam but I don't want it to replace my OS. \n\nA: You should take a look at PlayOnLinux. You can install steam on it and play your games just like you would in Windows.\n\n(source: ubuntu.com) \nIn the PlayOnLinux window that pops up click the “+ Install” button.\nIn the popup window that appears, search for: Steam.\nSelect \"Steam\" from the list and click the \"Install\" button.\n\nA: I know this is an old question, but it is worth revisiting due to new features from Valve.  As of August 21, 2018, the Beta version of the Steam Client for Linux extends Steam Play to support trying to run Windows games on Linux via their own special version of Wine called Proton. See: https://steamcommunity.com/games/221410#announcements/detail/1696055855739350561\nCurrently, only whitelisted games will run by default, and you do need a beta version.  To get the beta version, enable it in the Steam client.  Click on \"Steam\" button on the left corner of your Steam client window. With the Account pane selected, find the item \"Beta participation\" and click the \"Change\" button.  In the new dialog, select \"Beta participation\" to \"Steam Beta Update\".  Click \"OK\", then restart Steam.  WARNING: It is possible that various things could be broken because of being in the beta, but so far that hasn't happened to me, and I enabled it a fairly long time ago.  Once the beta version is running, there is a settings option \"Enable Steam Play for all titles.\"  Now you can try any Windows game and find out if it is one that works or not.  Third party reports on what or doesn't work appear to be being collected here: https://spcr.netlify.com/\n\nA: Do not expect to be able to play all of the games you had on windows! \nTo see all the games from steam available for linux go to this page http://store.steampowered.com/browse/linux/?l=english.  \nAs far as I know none of the triple-A games of publishers like EA have been ported yet. It is not in Valves power to port these games since they don't belong to them.\nThe only thing Valve can do is trying to put some pressure on the publishers.\nYou can expect however to be able to play all of Valves own games within reasonable time.\nSo far Counter Strike, CS:Condition Zero, CS:Source, Half-Life 2, HL2: Lost Coast, Left 4 Dead 2, Portal and Team Fortress 2 are available.\nThe other games you will find are mostly indie games, many of them quite good ;)\n\nA: You can install Ubuntu along side Windows and boot into either one when you turn on your computer. But that is beside the point. (You will probably NOT want to replace Windows if this is your first time installing Ubuntu.). Just select 'Install Ubuntu alongside Windows X' in the installer.\nYou can run Windows steam games on Linux through WINE. Though it will be a huge amount easier just running Linux Steam games on Ubuntu, it IS possible to run some of the windows games (though it may be slower). I think there are instructions here: https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_under_Linux#Step_2:_installing_steam.\nBasically you want to run this in a terminal (for Ubuntu 18.04+):\nsudo apt-get install wine winetricks\nwinetricks steam\n\nNote that for Ubuntu 16.04 and earlier, winetricks is a dependency of wine. You can do do this instead, and it'll be equivalent:\nsudo apt-get install wine\nwinetricks steam\n\n\nA: Of course you can install Steam in Wine and play Windows games. There is complete guide in Steam. See https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_under_Linux#Step_1:_setting_up_Wine\nThe most simple way is to use winetricks:\n    winetricks steam\n\nIf you are dual-booting your machine, it is possible to symlink your steamapps folder from linux to the windows location. This will allow you to maintain only one copy of the game downloads. Example (stop steam first):\n    cd $HOME/.wine/drive_c/Program\\ Files/Steam/\n    mv steamapps steamapps.bak\n    ln -s <ABSOLUTE-WINDOWS-DRIVE-MOUNT-POINT>/Program\\ Files/Steam/steamapps steamapps\n\nIf you symlink your steamapps folder, make sure you have your windows drive mounted before launching steam or it will fail to login and present a network related error message. If you use 64-bit windows, the program files directory will need an (x86) suffix. \n\nA: Just search steam for linux then click the first one then click on download now or just go here instead of searching:http://store.steampowered.com/about/     your welcome\n\nA: There are lots of applications to run Steam (windows) games on ubuntu or any other GNU/Linux OS... eg- wine, crossover linux and many more ! \nbut wine might be slow in some of the games you can check the game rating on wine itself and the quality too.\nCross over linux has a benefit that the games will not run slow but you have to pay for crossover (14 days trial )\nPlay on  linux might help you if you have any iso file but not useful much for steam.\nTHANKYOU\n\nA: The latest Doom Wolfenstein the old blood and the new order along with max pane work with the steam play on Linux. Those are the only ones I know of that are working. \n\nA: from steam (not on playon, the normal steam) try to go on the right side of the game picture --> click \"Properties\" --> accessibility --> force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool --> Protoss\nit should let u install the game even if it was intended only for microsoft or apple.\nenjoy\n\nA: I don't think wine slower than other stuff like playonlinux or crossover (what is free on Deepin Linux).\nAlot games not running on wine either,i guess mostly the new games but alot running what is older game with wine, also work dosbox or pcsx (PlayStation emulator) no problem.\n", "Q: Do I need a disc drive to install Ubuntu?

It turns out that making a screenshot requires running a special application called ScreenShot instead of just pressing PrtSc button. \nI wonder, how do I do a screenshot in the same way I did before by pressing PrtSc button?\n\nA: When using the keyboard>>Application Shortcuts to launch xfce-screenshooter, the program will not launch when a menu is opened on the panel.  It appears that when the panel's menu is opened, the keyboard shortcut doesn't fire.\nHowever, if you want to capture the menu at the top, open a terminal session and execute the following one liner:\nsleep 10s; xfce4-screenshooter -f\n\n... then click on the menu and wait for the snapshot.  The one liner will wait for 10 seconds before grabbing a full screen image.  Adjust the sleep delay if you need more or less time to wait.\n\nA: Go to:\n\nXFCE Menu  -->  Settings  -->  Keyboard  -->  Application Shortcuts,\n\nand add the xfce4-screenshooter -f command to use the \"PrintScreen\" key in order to take fullscreen screenshots.\nCheck archlinux wiki / Screenshots for more details or look at Settings Manager.\nHere's what it looks like:\n\n\nA: If you are using a Chromebook, you could also adjust key bindings, since there is no \"print screen\" key.\nYou could also just use the terminal commands \"xfce4-screenshooter -w\" to capture the terminal window, or use the -f flag to capture the whole screen and then edit in the image editor of your choice.\n", "Q: Why should I prefer ppa wine over the wine in the official repository?

Why should I prefer the ppa?  What is missing in the official wine that I should use the ppa instead?\n\nA: The WINE ppa offers a later version of WINE than the repos do. The current stable version of WINE (in the Ubuntu repos) is 1.4.1; 1.5 is a beta version.\nBy recommending that you install WINE from the PPA, these tutorials you speak of a really suggesting installing a beta version of WINE. The beta version has support for more Windows programs, but that support has not been perfected yet, which is why Ubuntu doesn't add the beta versions to their repos.\n", "Q: iOS 6 Banshee Syncing I got banshee to detect my ipod and it do\nThe sync but the new songs simply just don't pop up on the music app. on the program on my ubuntu everything looks fine.\nits super annoying\nI have a ipod touch 5g running the latest version 6.1.3  \nplease assist me with this issue\n\nA: From: http://banshee.fm/support/faq/\n\niPods - most iPods and iOS devices should work with Banshee. Apple frequently updates the database format the devices use by upgrading iTunes, so it's recommended to use Banshee exclusively to manage your iPod, or not at all.

Does the touchscreen work when a second monitor is hooked up? How about screen rotation into portrait mode when used as a tablet? Any special setup required?\n\nA: I had the same issue on my brand-new XPS12. It might be the newer model that prevents installation from 12.x or 13.04. I had success with 13.10 beta 1, though. Pretty much everything works out of the box, except multi-touch. No idea where to look as sputnik is already supposed to be integrated...\n\nA: Best help I can offer is to refer you to http://blog.jay.sh/ Seems like touchpad and touchscreen generally work, though multitouch only after bugfix #1103594. Currently Ubuntu 12.10 works better on XPS12, though screen auto-rotate still does not. To remedy that you can try doing an update from Project Sputnik repository, which provides some improvements. Then again Sputnik focuses on 12.10, so I don't know exactly how much help it will be for 13.04.\nMy XPS12 will arrive next week, and I will be able to help more after I get to play with Ubuntu on it myself.\n\nA: I got my XPS12 yesterday. Immediately removed the hdd and replaced it with new one, so I can tinker with linux without risking windows installation.\nFirst of all, all versions of ubuntu I tried fail to boot if secure boot is on. It always throws blue box with message that ubuntu was stopped because of current security. Disabling secure boot in bios fixes it.\nI tried couple versions of Ubuntu x64. Installs just fine, but afterwards I keep getting black screen even with \"nomodeset\". Same problem on 13.04, 12.10 and 12.04. Seems like all x64 have some problem there. I don't know what's worng, because it's just black screen. No error messages or anything. It plays the sound when legin screen shows up, so it's working underneath.\n13.04 x32 works, but for some reason VERY slowly. I think it's problem with the Intel graphics driver. I tried to reconfigure xorg, but that didn't help at all or dropped me to terminal only. Not sure what's the reason for the regression.\n12.10 x32 works very nicely pretty much out of the box, and that's the once I'm running right now. All function buttons work. I added Project Sputnik ppa and upgraded the kernel. This enabled multi-touch on both screen and trackpad. 2 finger scrolling didn't work at first, but as it turns out it's a setting in Ubuntu's \"mouse and touchpad\". This can enable it on trackpad. On screen still doesn't work. Screen accelerometer for orientation also doesn't work. The video made me think it does, but on their page they say it's still in development.\nRight now I'm running with secure boot off and legacy boot rather than uefi. With those settings Ubuntu boots even without \"nomodeset\". Tomorrow I'll try to see if I can get 12.04 x32 running with both or either of those on.\nI still have a goal to have 13.04 (preferably x64) working, but with current problems I'm a bit out of my depth. I'll have to study up and then try again. ...that or wait and hope 13.10 will somehow fix all that for me. :)\nEDIT:\nOn 12.10 running \"glxinfo | grep OpenGL | head -n3\" returns renderer as \"Mesa DRI Intel(R) Ivybridge Mobile x86/MMX/SSE2\" version \"3.0 Mesa 9.0\"\nSame on 13.04 returns renderer as Gallium 0.4.\nGallium is supposed to be improved i915 driver, but in my case at least, is horrible.\nI run \"/usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p\". On 12.10 all results are yes, and unity is supported. On 13.04 with that Gallium nonsense, unity support is no, and \"not software rendered  no\".\nEDIT 04/08/2013:\nOk, I got my boot and graphics fixed. Wow it was trivial issue.\nSlow graphics was a problem because Mesa 2.1 to work correctly required KMS. I was booting with \"i915.modeset=0\" or \"nomodeset\", which messed with KMS. When booting normally the driver should work perfectly fine.\nNow we're left with black screen problem. Actually as it turns out this can be taken care of by hitting Fn+F5 (aka brightness up button). :)\nNow 13.04 works just fine and 3D acceleration is running. Same on x32 and x64 versions. Touchscreen work well out of the box on all versions.\nBoth 13.04 don't get Project Sputnik upgrade, so no multi-touch neither screen nor touchpad (I'll see if I can somehow force the upgrade) You get only default ubuntu touch-click and 2 finger scroll.

And what I'd need to do to download it or get it in the right spot?\n\nA: For GL/gl.h use:\nsudo apt install mesa-common-dev\n\nYou may also find these helpful, for, say, GL/glu.h:\nsudo apt install libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev\n\n\nA: Ubuntu 20.04:\nGL.h can be installed from the package libgl-dev.\nsudo apt install libgl-dev\n\nA: I'd guess you don't have whatever dev package(s) provide gl.h. apt-file is the command line tool to use.\nFirst, make sure it's up to date:\napt-file update\n\nNow you can write a search to answer \"what package provides the gl.h file?\"\napt-file search \"gl.h\"\n\nI don't have an ubuntu box just now to check, but I'd guess the result will be something like mesa-dev or opengl-dev.\nOnce you know what package provides \"gl.h\", (let's pretend the result from apt-file is \"libmesa-dev\"), install it:\napt-get install libmesa-dev\n\nMore info on the apt family of commands: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGet/Howto\n\nA: You can also build glproto (link), libdrm (link), and then mesa (link) from source. While many other packages may contain this header file, it's important to go to the source. This will reduce the memory footprint of your installations and ensure you have the latest and/or greatest version.\n", "Q: How do I get Ubuntu option after installation beside a Windows 7? I have installed Ubuntu along side Windows 7. After restart, I got a blank screen. There after I restarted it manually. Now I can't understand, how to select the Ubuntu os.

I need to find actual process or dependence on other library in running system for package by name.  \nHow I can realize it?\n\nA: I would suggest using Aptitude.\nAptitude is a TUI (Terminal User Interface) application managing program. It runs in a terminal but it is pretty intuitive to use anyways.\nInstall aptitude by using:\nsudo apt-get install aptitude\n\nin a terminal. \nRun aptitude with:\naptitude\n\nYou can open up a terminal with CTRL+ALT+T\nAfter you are in aptitude, you can use the / key to search for a package. If it isn't found the first time you search for it, you can use the / key and search for it again to find the next match.\nAfter you have found the package that you want info on, press the enter key. That will bring up info on a package.

Also, usually, when you see # in the middle of the line, the rest of the line will be considered a comment. What's a comment? It's stuff that doesn't get executed (very useful for indicating what is going on, in a human-friendly way, hence the name \"comment\").\n\n*Lines starting with echo print text. For example:\necho testing 1 2 3\n\nwill print:\ntesting 1 2 3\n\n\n*When you see a line like this:\necho \"testing 1 2 3\" > FILE\n\nwhat will happen is that testing 1 2 3 will be written to FILE. Notice that if FILE does not exist, it will be created, and if FILE has contents in it, it will be overridden. That's why sometimes you see this instead:\necho \"testing 1 2 3\" >> FILE\n\nWhich will then append testing 1 2 3 to FILE (due to >> instead of >)\n\n*When you see sleep at the beginning of a line, it will make the computer pause for n seconds, with n being the number after sleep (e.g. sleep 1 will wait for one second)\n\n*read will get input from you (you will enter text, and then when you press ENTER, it will get sent to the program). How does the program read this? With the argument next to it. So read test will ask you to enter text, and once you're done, it will set the value of the variable test to the text you entered.\n\n*To access a variable, prepend $ to the name of the variable. BASH will automatically replace the variable with its contents. Check this example out:\n test=\"hello world\"\n echo $test # Will show hello world\n            # BASH will interpret this as:\n            # echo \"hello world\"\n\n\n*To assign a value to a variable, write a command in this format: variable=value. Notice that there are no spaces between =, variable, and value.\n\n*chmod changes the access rights of a file. I won't go into detail about this (though there are some tutorials about this:  http://www.analysisandsolutions.com/code/chmod.htm, http://catcode.com/teachmod/, and http://www.perlfect.com/articles/chmod.shtml), but in the example you mentioned, it shows:\nchmod +x SpotifyController\n\nThat will add execute permissions to SpotifyController, meaning that you can run it as an application\n\n*sudo allows you to run commands as root (think administrator, if you're used to windows). Notice that it (usually) needs your password to run (for security reasons), but don't be alarmed if it doesn't ask each time. Most of the time, after entering your password once, it will wait for 15 minutes before asking for your password again (but, of course, it will only ask if you run sudo after the 15 minutes)\n\n*mv moves a file from one place to another. If it stays in the same place, but you change the name of the new file, it acts as a renaming tool\n\n*cp copies a file from one place to another. The -f switch forces it to, and -r copies it recursively (needed if you're copying a directory)\n\n*PWD is a special variable that holds the current working directory (which can be set by cd)\n\n*If you're wondering about the \\\"'s, you can check out BASH escaping tutorials: http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/escapingsection.html, http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_03_03.html.\nAnd, of course, if you want to learn more about BASH, check out these tutorials (but feel free to google around also, of course =):\nhttp://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html\nhttp://www.tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/\nhttp://www.hypexr.org/bash_tutorial.php (less about scripting, and more about how to use the shell)\nhttp://linuxconfig.org/bash-scripting-tutorial\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Broken Packages/Unmet Dependecies I have a problem.

However, this time my problem is that i am unable to start the installation in Terminal. \nI have done all the preparations to install the drivers, extractions etc and now i am just about to start the installation of the .run-file.\nHowever, nothing happens. No installation, no errors, nothing. Itś like Terminal recived the command but ignores it. Normally it says, \"Command not found\" or that the file \"dosent exist\", but now it says nothing, it just jumps down a row and awaits new commands. \nWhat should i do?\n\nA: Following your saga (first post, second post, third post, fourth post) I have a suggestion that can save your time and energy.\nThe proprietary drivers that you are trying to install are not supported anymore for your hardware and operating system. Yes, there are some trick and tweaks, like downgrading xorg but in the long run it is not worth the trouble. Use open source drivers and do not try to replace them with something else if there is no good reason for it.\nUbuntu should use open source drivers out of the box but you can install them also with this command:\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-ati xserver-xorg-video-radeon\n\nJust make sure that you remove amd drivers you might have in your system. The amd drivers that come from the standard repository are either fglrx or fglrx-updates. The \"purge\" command removes the package completely.\n$ sudo apt-get purge <package-name>\n\nFglrx packages:\nfglrx fglrx-amdccele\n\nFglrx-update packages:\nfglrx-updates fglrx-amdcccle-updates\n\nI struggled a year to get proprietary AMD drivers work on my HD4870 and I don't advice anybody to do the same. If you can't get the performance you need with the open source driver then replace your old amd card with some nvidia card. For and example you could buy it second hand and do background search in the internet beforehand whether it works with Ubuntu. \n", "Q: Does NetworkManager have a limited bandwidth mode? As soon as I go online via my portable 3G hotspot, all running programs happily start pulling updates (e.g. Gwibber, Thunderbird, Update Manager...) and eat into my traffic quota. Is there a way to activate a network connection, but only tell specific programs about it (e.g. Firefox, if I just want to quickly look something up)? Note that I'm not looking for bandwidth limiting, I just want to prevent the automatic \"ooh, I'm online, let's get some data\" behavior.\nEDIT: I have already received two useful answers, however, I'd still like to add some clarification: what does NetworkManager do to tell running programs they're now online? I assume it's some sort of DBus message. Can I prevent that from being sent?\n\nA: One of the ways that I would do that is using a Firewall.  Ubuntu comes with it own Firewall UFW.  You might want to install the GUI version, just to make it easier.  To install it,  just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo apt-get install gufw\n\nOnce it finishes, just type gufw at the terminal prompt, and with the application opens, click on Edit, and then Add Rule.\n\nWhen that window opens, choose Deny --> Out --> Application -->, and then choose the application that you want.  For command line control over the Firewall, see UFW\n\nIf you want to block e.g. DropBox, you can block the entire Dropbox network IP allocation listed in ARIN, as seen in the image below.\n\nAnd you can see that it keeps saying connecting..\n\n\nA: This can be achieved if we restrict application from AUTOMATIC PULL configuration.  Example for Update Manager    \n\nSimilarly you may configure for other applications like:  \nDisabling Automatic Update in Firefox \nType about:config in the address bar and press Enter.  \nYou should get a page trying to scare you off with a message starting with “This might void you warranty!”, just click “I’ll be careful I promise!“.  \nThen in the Filter filed type app.update.enabled. It should be set to true, double-click on the line to set it to false.\nDisabling Automatic update for Thunderbird\nOn the top menu, click on Tools->Options to enter the Options window,\n   then click on Advanced and selct the General tab. Click on the Config Editor  \nYou should get a page trying to scare you off with a message starting with “This might void you warranty!”, just click “I’ll be careful I promise!“.  \nThen in the Filter filed type app.update.enabled. It should be set to true, double-click on the line to set it to false.  \nUpgrades on preferred network\nReferring to the man-pages of Network Switcher\nYou may have certain commands configured when you are on the 3Ghotspot/Homewifi.\nFor an instance for thunderbird upgrades you may change the prefs.js(specific to user profile) or syspref.js(globally) to enable the update option.  \nSo your would look like /etc/network/interfaces\n# Home Wifi\niface homewifi inet static\n  # Set the DNS entry\n  dns-domain something.net.com\n  dns-search some.net yes.something.net www.somesite.com\n  # Set the sysprefs.js entries for update.\n  script /usr/sbin/which_edits_the_sysprefs.sh\n\nWe may add anything we want to have the same executed on a specific network.\n\nA: To answer my edited question myself: NetworkManager indeed sends a DBus signal which looks as follows:\nsignal sender=:1.6 -> dest=(null destination) serial=2031 path=/org/freedesktop/NetworkManager; interface=org.freedesktop.NetworkManager; member=StateChanged\nuint32 70\n\nNM-aware programs listen to this message and react to it by starting to use the network.

How do I do that in ubuntu??\n\nA: FiFa Manager 13 is a windows application, and can't run under Ubuntu natively.  In order to be able to run it, you need to install Wine.\nTo install Wine, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install wine1.5\nsudo apt-get install winetricks\n\n\nA: WineHQ Applications Database is a database that rates the compatibility of Windows applications running on Linux using Wine.

The client is a Windows box running PuTTY and the server is a Ubuntu 12.04 LTS server.\nI downloaded puttygen.exe and had it generate a key pair. In /etc/ssh/sshd_config I have this line:\nAuthorizedKeysFile %h/.ssh/authorized_keys\n\nand on my client's public key file it says this:\n---- BEGIN SSH2 PUBLIC KEY ----\nComment: \"my@email.address.com\"\nssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABJQAAAIEAr3Qo6T5XU06ZigGOd3eKvfBhFLhg5kWv8lz6\nqJ2G9XCbexlPQGanPhh+vcPkhor6+7OmB+WSdHeNO652kTofnauTKcTCbHjsT7cJ\nGNrO8WVURRh4fabknUHPmauerWQZ6TgRPGaz0aucU+2C+DUo2SKVFDir1vb+4u83\nAV1pKxs=my@email.address.com\n---- END SSH2 PUBLIC KEY ----\n\nI copied the part from \"ssh-rsa AAA\" to \"my@email.address.com\" and put that in the file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on my server (in my own homefolder).

I also tried generating a private/public key pair on the server, putting the public key in ./ssh/authorized_files and loading the private one in PuTTY on my client. Rebooting the server didn't help either.\nI found that the error may be solved by putting the key in a place outside the user's home folder but that's only useful if the home folder is encrypted, which this one is not.\nAlso tried generating a 4096 bit key, thinking perhaps 1024 was too short.\nHow can I get this to work?

If you added it across multiple lines as in your paste above, try joining the lines.\n\nA: Here's what worked for me:\nIn puttygen, after you've generated your keys, make sure that you copy and paste the information from the top field to go into your authorized_keys file. If you save your public key to your client machine, and then open it up, the text is different from the text at the top of the puttygen screen. Again, make sure that you copy and paste the text from the TOP of the puttygen screen (after you've created your keys) into your authorized_keys file which should be located in ~/.ssh.\n\nA: I just encountered this problem. Despite having the config set correctly as is already mentioned in this thread (permissions on authorized_keys etc.), it turns out I had the public key in the wrong format.

Be sure to select the entire string manually, from the ssh-rsa to the very end of the text box.\n\nA: for me the problem was i'd created ~/.ssh/authorized_keys using root so root owned.

However, you can still buy one (Canonical Free softwares are definitively not free as in free beer).\nHowever, it seems that some local communities continues to provide the shipment service for free. Use the Ubuntu Local Communities website to find a team near of your country.\n\nA: As Sebf pointed out, you can get a physical CD from Canonical's store.\nThere are also various \"freelancers\" selling CDs on Amazon.com and other sites, but make sure to read the reviews before purchasing since they are NOT Canonical authorized so their quality may be questionable (but what they are doing is perfectly legal since it is open-source software.)\nNote that Canonical will stop shipping physical CDs/DVDs for non-LTS releases, which means that after 12.10, the next physical CD you can get you hands on from Canonical will likely be 14.04.\n\nA: I recommend you simply download it instead of picking up a disk it would be less time wasting but if you really want a disk well here is the link \nhttp://shop.canonical.com/product_info.php?products_id=976 \nand then when you wanna upgrade to raring just do it from the software updater and put alert me of all new os updates instead of just the stable ones\n", "Q: how do you add files to existing programs How does the file system work with Ubuntu. How do you find where a program is and if needed how do you add file to it?  \n\nA: For an overview of the linux file system see: http://lotphelp.com/lotp/tour-linux-filesystem\n\nNormally you would \"add\" to your system by using the package manager, apt, using the graphical tool, software center.\nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingSoftware\nThe ubuntu repositories are quite extensive and should have most everything you may need.\nIf there is something you need outside the repositories, you can manually add software via a number of techniques, most common is to compile it  manually. This should be avoided if possible.\nFor details on compiling see\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingEasyHowTo\n\nA: As user68186 commented, Ubuntu programs have their files spread across multiple directories in the system. The package management system, called APT, manages the installation and maintenance of all these files seamlessly in day-to-day operation.\nIf you wanted to modify/add/remove files belonging to an installed package, the best way to do it is to actually rebuild that package from its source. If you just modify the installed files on your system, then the package management system will not be able to properly maintain it anymore.\nYou can list all the files that belong to a \"package\" using the dpkg -L command. For example, if you wanted to know about the diffstat command, you'd first ask what package that executable program belongs to, and then you could list the installed files belonging to that package:\n$ dpkg -S $(which diffstat)\ndiffstat: /usr/bin/diffstat\n$ dpkg -L diffstat\n/.\n/usr\n/usr/bin\n/usr/bin/diffstat\n/usr/share\n/usr/share/man\n/usr/share/man/man1\n/usr/share/man/man1/diffstat.1.gz\n/usr/share/doc\n/usr/share/doc/diffstat\n/usr/share/doc/diffstat/copyright\n/usr/share/doc/diffstat/README\n/usr/share/doc/diffstat/changelog.Debian.gz\n\n", "Q: why doesn't my ftp transfer work?

It seems to either not be present, not running, or not configured to allow a connection in from the error you are relaying.\nEither way, the problem you are describing (if you are truly attempting to FTP into that Windows box) is more an FTP server setup / Windows security (firewall) / or possibly networking question more than an Ubuntu issue.\nAn alternative solution, as @Alvar suggested in the comments, would be to share a folder across the network, providing R/W access (with security configurations as you please) and then simply save documents there.  That would be a much simpler method, and would remove the need for running an FTP server of any kind (which seems like it would be overkill on a LAN).\n", "Q: How install a new app from LiveCD into sleeping hard drive installation I've:\n\n\n*\n\n*a pc with a running Ubuntu installation.\n\n*a LiveCD running in the above pc with access to the hard drive Ubuntu installation filesystem.\n\n\nand I need to know how install an app from the running LiveCD to the Ubuntu installation, so when I boot the hard drive installed Ubuntu that app is correctly installed & available.\nThanks\n\nA: *\n\n*Chroot to the drive containing existing ubuntu installation\n\n\n2 . sudo apt-get install <package name>\n", "Q: Partitioning File System Drive When installing Ubuntu I was told to set the size constraints for my File System drive and my...

Plymouth displays the splash image/animation.\nYou can install a new theme (like plymouth-theme-spinfinity, which has no distro-specific logos) and switch to the new theme by running sudo update-alternatives --config default.plymouth.\nIf you remove all Plymouth themes, Plymouth is likely to display various debug information instead (stuff like \"mounting /dev/sda1\" and such). I don't know if that would negatively impact the presentation you want.\nYou could also try making your own Plymouth theme, using the logo of the place where you plan to put this computer. I found a tutorial for Ubuntu here, but I'm not sure if I trust it.\nTo start Chrome faster, you can try adding it to your Startup Applications. It should start faster than your script, but I don't know if it will start fast enough to keep the desktop from showing. You can also remove other programs from autostart to make Chrome start even faster.\nYou may want to also configure Lightdm to to skip the login screen, but I think you already handled that.\nSince you seem to be making a Chrome-only computer, have you considered ChromiumOS?

I work in a lab, I have 2 Dell blades and a switch. I'm trying to create openStack using juju and MAAS. The blades are connected to the switch and have a private 192... network, and each blade itself is connected to the 10... internet. \nI have installed the MAAS server using Ubuntu 13.04 and added the node to it, but the status of the node is still in commissioning! I already checked the hardware clock and it is fine.\nHow can I fix this issue?\n\nA: Not 100% sure if this will answer your question, but I did have this in a virtual environment. I actually just had to reboot the node, it seemed to fix what was needed on the pxe setup the second time around.\n\nA: I am really sorry for not being able to +1 Ross' answer, like it should be,, but being my first post, I cannot simply comment. I have to ANSWER.\nI am currently deploying a private cloud using MAAS (Ubuntu 14.04) on a few Dell PE2950s, and found out a few things. The one related to this (fairly old) question is: \n1) Once your \"nodes\" load go on \"commissioning\", they will be shut down ON PURPOSE, by PXE. You can actually see this on the log related to each node. EDIT the type of power control you have on that node and THEN start it again. I chose Wake on lan, and entered the MAC address detected by MAAS. The NEXT time you start the node, it will boot up and start another routine, which will actually READ the resources from that particular node (amount of memory, number of disks, how many cored, etc). After that is finished, the node will be shut down again, and will be listed as READY on MAAS.\nSince we are talking about strange things, here is a few more I noticed and how I solved. Hopefully Google and other spider-indexing systems will find this as well, sharing the info with other people.\nI initially tried deploying MAAS in a multi-homed machine, with two network cards, so I could have the cloud controller connected to the internet, but the nodes isolated. Just because I am paranoid. This failed miserably, because once the nodes booted up, they would fail referring to the correct IP address, where to load the images. \nThe only way to get it working was deploying MAAS with a single NIC (or, at least, only one NIC configured) and they things started to make sense, BUT, you definitely cannot deploy a cloud during your lunch break.\nOr, if YOU can, let me know where you work, because you must have a 4 hour lunch break for sure ! \nI am pretty sure this can be fixed by tweaking a few parameters on configuration files, BUT, first, this is not the goal, second, reconfiguring MAAS, entering (again) the correct IP address did not fix this as one would expect. \nAnyway, the objective here is to shed some light on this subject, helping those suffering souls like myself out there.\nCheers. \n------ UPDATE --- UPDATE --- UPDATE ---- 15 Jan 2016\nI found out that enabling IPMI on the server (probably one of the last prompts before the machine tries to boot; Usually Control E) will allow you to enable and configure IMPI's behaviour, and this is GREAT, because MAAS will use it to control that node, reboot it and shut it down as needed. \nI have not tested all the steps on the process, but it looks promising. \nBeing more detailed, enable IPMI on the NIC used for DHCP, not the other(s). Sounds obvious, but after 3:00am all ideas start to get a bit fuzzy. ALSO, make sure the power mode (on MAAS) of each of the nodes is actually IPMI. MAAS seems to be start enough and test all NICs for IPMI capability.\nLooks like MAAS is VERY happy when it controls metal based on IPMI. An alternative (I have not tested) would be setting the nodes to wake-on-lan. This may give a little more latitude regarding timeouts. \n--- UPDATE --- UPDATE --- UPDATE --- 16 Jan 2016\nIPMI makes a difference, and nodes are automatically powered on and off, BUT, make sure you have the latest firmware installed on your system.\nLook for SUU and SLI on Dell's web site. Different versions of IPMI (firmware) behave differently as well.\nPLASE NOTE that you still have to select your servers and say \"COMMISSION\" or \"DEPLOY\", but MAAS will take care of switching them on of off. No pressing buttons !\nALSO, one of my servers shows ALWAYS with the power on, no matter what. It is probably the firmware thing I mentioned. I had to REMOVE the POWER CABLE and re-connect it a minute latter in order to trigger the right reading on MAAS.  Only one unexplored variant here: this specific unit has multiple NICs, off-board. (Just found out you can select the server and say \"POWER OFF\" to match its actual state).\n", "Q: Is it possible to hide arbitrary panel indicators?

The laptop currently has Windows 7 installed from the factory, and I feel that Im really urging to get back to using Ubuntu.\nThanks\n\nA: You have a high spec laptop, so you can choose between any of the different flavors of Ubuntu. Since you don't have a lot of experience with Ubuntu, I recommend that you install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS which is supported by updates until April, 2017. That way you get a stable Long Term Support release that won't need an upgrade or a new install until April, 2017.\nThe other available alternative choices are Ubuntu 12.10, which is supported by updates until April, 2014, and Ubuntu 13.04, which is supported by updates until January, 2014.\n", "Q: can't login to my account after typing my password and press enter \nit takes me back to the page and ask to me to enter my password again \nI can login as a guest \nand am able to login in the terminal ( ctrl+alt+F1 ) \nbut not with the graphical interface \n\nA: When logged in to the terminal look for a file in home directory called .Xauthority (hidden file) use ls -al.

To install it directly execute the .run file.\nYou may also try Unity 2D, which doesn't use hardware acceleration. If changing the driver doesn't fix it but using Unity 2D does, this indicates a possible issue with the videocard hardware.\nTo restart the unity shell (and clean up the garbage without logging off and back on), use Alt+F2 to open the run dialog, type (blindly if the problem is that bad) unity --replace and Enter.

Almost all available drivers are included.\nUbuntu comes with many drivers out-of-the-box. You may need to install drivers only if some of your hardware is not working properly or not being detected. Some drivers for graphic cards and wireless adapters can be downloaded.\nThe easy way to find out if any drivers are needed is to choose to Try Ubuntu from the installation screen first to see if you need any drivers and to see if Ubuntu is working with your hardware.\n\nA: Ubuntu is an open source operating system, and in an open source operating system it is possible to provide users with additional protection against problems caused by installing the wrong driver and additional help recovering the system after installing the wrong proprietary graphics driver. I'm referring here to the built-in open source graphics drivers like nouveau and the amdgpu packages and proprietary graphics drivers like the NVIDIA drivers from the official NVIDIA website and the AMDGPU-Pro driver1 from the official AMD website.\nThe built-in open source drivers in Ubuntu provide the user with an additional layer of protection against having to reinstall the operating system due to a problem that was caused by installing a proprietary driver. The reason why some drivers do not need to be installed in Ubuntu is that some open source drivers are already built-in in the default Ubuntu installation. Installing a proprietary driver can sometimes make your system unbootable, were it not for the open source drivers that are still installed that enable the system to boot again after the proprietary driver that was causing the problem is uninstalled.\n\nA: Linux (and some other open source unix) systems treat drivers very differently from how Windows OSes do.\nIn Windows systems (especially pre-Windows 10), the OS kernel provides a stable binary software interface against which a driver can be written, and that interface is (with exceptions) guaranteed to be unchanging across the support cycle of a given Windows version. This favours drivers being written and supplied by third parties, they will usually work for at least one version of Windows across that support cycle. The downsides are that this driver interface is hard to improve or fix within that lifecycle, and favours binary distribution of drivers which (all politics aside!) often limits consistent multi-platform support.\nLinux kernels do have a changing driver interface that is only strictly specified at the source code level, and biased towards improvability and multi-platform consistency. This means that, unless an additional \"translator\" driver offering a specific, stable binary interface is used, a driver binary is specific to an exact kernel build. One could \"fudge\" a driver binary to maybe be compatible with a couple dozen exact kernel versions on one platform, but the effort to maintain it (as a binary offering) would be uneconomical. This bias is also politically wanted in the linux kernel community, since they  pretend a closed source binary driver could do much worse than malicious firmware on a busmastering-capable peripheral consider closed source code as both too untrusted and too distasteful to have it running with kernel privileges. Thus, open source device drivers for all major hardware are supplied within the kernel package itself, with the second option of there being a relatively easy to use method of distributing an outside driver as a source tarball, to be compiled against the installed kernel.\nSome other linux drivers (eg classic X11 graphics drivers, scanner drivers, printer drivers) are not handled as pieces of the kernel, but as parts of some userspace software that is providing the functionality as a system wide service (XOrg, Sane, Ghostscript...) - these, too, tend to be specific to and mostly distributed with a given version of the relevant userspace software.\n", "Q: How to set image open-with via terminal? I am running openbox and so do not have access to standard Ubuntu control panel, but must set everything from the terminal. When I download an image in chrome and click open, it launches xdg-open which then launches an arbitrary program (it resorts to Internet Explorer on wine if I uninstall those programs).\nHow do I control which program is loaded for an image of type .jpg (and others)?\n\nA: *\n\n*Run the command nano ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list (to set for your user only) or sudo nano /usr/share/applications/mimeapps.list (to set for all users). \n\n*Find the mime type of the file you want to change (.jpg is image/jpeg). You can find the mime type with the command file --mime-type -b filename\n\n*Replace (or add) the line so it reads image/jpeg=eog.desktop (replacing image/jpeg with the type and eog.desktop with the .desktop which you want to use to launch the program.\n\n\nNote: \nIf you are using /usr/share/applications/mimeapps.list, you may need to create it see here: Default Applications - ArchWiki\n", "Q: Shorewall IP Forwarding Problems in 12.04 LTS Internet connectivity through my 12.04 LTS shorewall box is spotty at best.

(Some users of tools like WinRAR get confused because WinRAR recognizes ISO-Files as archive files.) So, just select the ISO file using your burning application and create a DVD file.\nThen insert this Disc into your computer and try to reboot. In many cases the computer would automatically boot from the inserted disc. Otherwise you should see your BIOS (normally you can enter BIOS by pressing  or  or some other F-Key during the boot sequence) and set there the boot sequency to first boot from Disc-/DVD-Drives.\n(a) some tools for Windows to burn DVDs would be DiscBurner XP or ImageBurn.

I want this to happen on all of my desktops (or whatever the heck they are officially known as). How can I open these apps so that they appear in the same location?\n\nA: Once upon a time, you could use a command line parameter like -geometry wxh+x+y. It looks like this is still possible, but some programs (like gnome-terminal) require --geometry instead.\nNote that gnome-terminal uses units of characters; other programs generally use units of pixels.\nSo all you need to do is write a script that starts each program in the background with your desired geometry settings. Something like this:\n#!/bin/sh\n\ngnome-terminal --geometry 80x24+0+0 &\ngnome-terminal --geometry 80x24+82+0&\ngoogle-chrome --geometry ... &\n# etc.\n\n(I'm not sure if Chrome supports this - you'll need to check)\nFinally, set your script to run automatically on startup.\n\nA: Compiz supports such functionality.\nYou will need to install compizconfig-settings-manager.  Once installed, run ccsm.\nYou can now use ccsm to configure/enable Grid and Place Windows, under Window Management.\nOnce you've set up where to open the windows, you can use Startup Applications found under System Tools > Preferences.\n\nA: if \"desktops (or whatever the heck they are officially known as)\" is what KDE calls \"virtual desktops\", i.e. you define e.g. 8 desktops and have different windows on each, but \"sticky\" windows are shown on all desktops, then the answer (at least with KDE) is to use kstart. It has a --desktop option to specify the desktop:\nkstart --desktop 3 chromium-browser\nkstart --desktop 3 konsole -geometry 600x400+0+0\n\nIt's not very robust though. It first launches the program and then waits for the window to appear. If the window title is not what it guesses you have to use the --window option. When the window appears it is relocated to the given desktop.\nkstart also has a --geometry option to specify the window geometry but in my case it was ignored. Instead I specified the geometry with application specific geometry options, see Robie Basak's answer above\n", "Q: How to use ActionSelectionPopover QML Component I'm trying to use the ActionSelectionPopover located here, I can't find any examples on how to actually execute/show it, from looking at the demo QML files this is what I have come up with:\n/* Popup menu when right clicking items */\nActionSelectionPopover {\n    id: contextMenu\n    actions: ActionList {\n        Action {\n            text: i18n.tr(\"View Item Info\")\n            onTriggered: print(text)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThen later I have this in an item:\nonClicked: {\n    contextMenu.caller = item;\n    contextMenu.show();\n    print(item);\n}\n\nNow the item is printed, but the ActionSelectionPopover does not show.\n\nA: Well I figured out what was going on in my case, I was handling it correctly, what was happening is for some reason, probably because where my ActionSelectionPopover was located in my QML file, it was appearing below all the other components in my app, I just set it's z property to 100, and now it works fine, so this is my new ActionSelectionPopover code:\n/* Popup menu when right clicking items */\nActionSelectionPopover {\n    id: contextMenu\n    z: 100\n    actions: ActionList {\n        Action {\n            text: i18n.tr(\"View Item Info\")\n            onTriggered: print(text)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu on a very old PC I'd like to install Ubuntu on a 12-year-old laptop currently running Win XP.

Have checked this with uncommenting line 28 and line 33 of /etc/sysctl.conf - then this bash-script in this thread would work, but deliver very few output because provider has enabled firewall (because of no-spy-act ?).

It probably isn't the optimal solution, but it does its job.\nIt consists of a for loop over all lines of output of the command within $(). In each iteration of the loop, one line of output is stored in the variable IP. Then, in the loop, the whois command is called with $IP - the content of the variable IP - as argument.\nThe brackets $() enclose two grep commands - the first one is searching for IP addresses with SRC= written in front of them and the second one takes the output of the first one (via a pipe |) and just takes the IP address. The -o flag of grep causes it to only output the matched part of the lines instead of the full lines.\nThe regular expression is also not very elegant yet. It is searching for three groups, each consisting of one to three digits and a dot, followed again by one to three digits. To keep the script readable, I chose to use -E extended regular expressions. The \"normal\" grep command would require a backslash in front of every round and curly bracket...\nfor IP in \\\n $(grep  -E \"SRC=([0-9]{1,3}\\.){3}[[0-9]{1,3}\" -o  /var/log/syslog  | \\\n grep -E \"([0-9]{1,3}\\.){3}[[0-9]{1,3}\" -o);\n    do whois $IP;\ndone\n\n\nA: Your script should look like this:\n#/bin/bash\n\ngrep 'SRC=' /var/log/syslog | awk 'BEGIN {FS=\"[ \\t]+|\\\\|\"} {print $13}' | uniq >> ~/topsecret001/pitbull001.txt\n\nfor ip in $(sed -e 's/SRC=//g' ~/topsecret001/pitbull001.txt)\ndo \n    whois $ip >> ~/topsecret001/pitbull002.txt\ndone\n\n\nA: For to add option - in case of popping up \"INVALID STATE\" - would then work this ? :\nawk '{\n\n    for (i = 1; i <= NF; i++)\n\n      if ($i ~ /^SRC=/)\n\n         print substr($i, 5)\n\n   }' /var/log/syslog | sort -u | while read ip; \n\ndo\n\n   printf ' INVALID STATE ' && printf ' === %s ===\\n' \"$ip\"\n\n   whois \"$ip\"\n\n done\n\n", "Q: How to open scripts from Second Life viewer into console vim I want everything that has to do with text to be edited within console vim with tabs. \nMy problem is that I can't open files in console vim from GUI, I can only open them in gvim. \nDoes anyone know how I can do such a thing? \nFor example my most frequent issue is with a game called Second Life.

You need to subscribe the folder in the control panel on the folders tab, for the folder to be synchronized. You will also then have to add that folder to your music player by hand on Windows.\nThey will be located in your home directory (profile folder), under the .ubuntuone/Purchased from Ubuntu One/ sub-directory.\n", "Q: NAS setup with Ubuntu First of all, I have read Simple NAS setup for Ubuntu, which is a bit beyond my needs at the moment.\nBriefly, I am new to Ubuntu Linux as some of you already know. I need to build a NAS with Ubuntu - on which I can, at least for the time being, store files from my 2 Win 7 64 bit computers - many, many TB's of NTFS files.

Or is there any way to install it \n\nA: Before you continue I should warn you that HP removes any warraty (at least that was my personal experience in Mexico) after you touch the configuration they sold you ( Windows version, Partitions etc.)\nIn the case you don't care, use the official guide:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/DualBoot/Windows\n", "Q: Where does the Guest Session store its configuration files In my computer I have my account (cyrex) and the guest session. If my user cyrex stores its files in /home/cyrex where does the guest session store its files?. For example, if I wanted to set the guest in a way so that when it loads it has a specific Wallpaper, Launcher icon size and any other customization I would want to do with it.\n\nA: In /tmp/guest-[xxxxxx], where the x's are a string of letters and numbers. That folder contains all the normal home folders for a user.\nThe guest account is managed by lightdm through /usr/sbin/guest-account, which is a shell script. After setting up the guest account, the script will run a preferences script if it exists: /etc/guest-session/prefs.sh\nA convenience set of scripts to make this process easier, along with some explanation of how to use them, can be found at CustomizeGuestSession.\nThe basic settings you can change are:\nFirefox preference settings\nDisabling the login-sound\ngettexted strings\nSet a Folder for storing files permanently\nShow an Info dialog at startup\nSet an Icon on the desktop\nSet the guest account language and keyboard\n\nI haven't tested everything, but after using it a few times things seems to work well and seem easy to modify. I figured changing the language had the most potential for bugs, but I set the guest language to Chinese and it worked great. \nSome things need to be added, such as changing the background.\nThere are two main files prefs.sh, which runs as root and then calls auto.sh, which runs as the guest user, as it finishes. \nFeatures can be added to either file as appropriate. To change the wallpaper I added the following line to auto.sh.\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri \"file:///usr/share/backgrounds/Leftover_by_Sagar_jain.jpg\"\n\nLauncher icon size was a little trickier since it is a relocatable schema and DConf Editor says it has No schema, but the command is:\ngesettings set org.compiz.unityshell:/org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/ icon-size 32\n\nThanks to @dobey for an explanation of using relocatable schemas.\nThe original scripts were posted on the Ubuntu Forums by Gunnar Hjalmarsson. \n\nA: I just rewrote the tutorial Customize Guest Session. The main approach in the new tutorial - making use of a special purpose user account - is a more convenient way to customize the guest session feature.\n", "Q: Ubuntu/Unity: unminimize all windows How could I unminimize all windows (at least of the current workspace)?

I just run a disk analyer for my ubuntu 12.04. I found there is a huge folder under this directory ~/.cache/deja-dup. All the files inside name like duplicity-full.20121019T115047Z.manifest.part / duplicity-full-signatures.20121019T115047Z.sigtar.part\nBut it contain more than 5G file there. Anyone have any idea what is this file regarding??\nCan I delete them as they are eating up my disk storage.\nThank you.\n\nA: Firstly, this is not the system cache.  The system cache is a cache that resides in memory and occupies physical memory that is not otherwise used by applications.\nThis is a .cache folder inside your home directory, so not system-wide at all.  You can, if you need the space, safely delete it (make sure the application that uses it isn't running at the time).  Only a misbehaving program would die if you delete stuff it's put in ~/.cache.\nTo answer your question though, deja-dup is a backup tool provided by Ubuntu.  The cache probably helps it keep track of all the files in your backup sets.  It probably saves a fair bit of time re-generating this information each time the backup process starts.  Every file in your backup sets, it appears, has signatures stored in a cache.\n5G does sound like a lot, though.  If you don't use deja-dup, or you don't care about it losing its cache and being a lot more slow next time it starts, you could delete it.\n", "Q: What is Mir and why is it important? I've heard a lot about Mir lately. It seems to be a big thing in the Ubuntu community. \nWhat exactly is Mir and why is it so important? Will it affect me?\n\nA: Mir\nMir is the next generation display server.  A system-level component targeted as a replacement for the X window server system to unlock next-generation user experiences for devices ranging from Linux desktop to mobile devices powered by Ubuntu. \nThe purpose of Mir is to enable the development of the Next Generation Unity.\nIn the Linux world, the display server is the part of the software stack that handles graphics processing. In other words, it's the thing that draws pretty pictures on the screen. And for decades, there has been only one show in town when it came to display servers for virtually all open source operating systems: The X Window System, which was written in an era when the computing landscape was very different than it is now. Venerable as it is, X is not particularly well-suited to many of the devices or usage scenarios that predominate today.\nSo by implementing Mir, an entirely new display server that Canonical is building from the ground up, Ubuntu developers are doing something radically different. They're bringing a crucial part of the open source ecosystem into the modern age, creating a display system tailored to work well on the types of hardware—especially phones and tablets—that will define the future.\nSources:Ubuntu Wiki & Mir for Ubuntu Linux\n\nA: Mir will affect you in future releases of Ubuntu - by making desktop more efficient and attractive!\nYou can run it now if you want to, though it is still being developed and still sits on top of the X windows stack at the moment. You have to be running 13.10 though.\n", "Q: Unable to connect to a NetGear router I am trying to get wireless working on my computer but I just can't....\nI've searched for hours on how to connect to the wireless network -- I don't know if I am doing something wrong, but nothing seems to work.\nI watched several videos on how to set my wireless connection. All of them clicked on the wifi connection icon in the right hand corner and it listed wifi connections you could connect to. When I tried that nothing was listed. It just said that my wired network was disconnected.\nSo I tried to add an internet connection, I filled out the SSID, BSSID, and the MAC Address, etc. I clicked \"Apply\" and it still isn't connecting.\nI don't have any experience with Ubuntu. I would really appreciate a step by step on how to solve this. I'm trying to connect to a netgear router, wirelessly.\n\nA: Is your router installed properly? Do you have an ethernet cable running to it from your modem? Also, you might need Ndiswrapper if you're using a wireless adapter. run\n    sudo apt-get install ndisgtk\n\nin the terminal, if you can. You can access the terminal by pressing ctrl+alt+t\n", "Q: Installation Length Okay, so I've been waiting for Ubuntu 13.04 to install on my computer for about an hour. At first, it had the bar at the top and the desktop shown with a spinning cursor. Now the bar has disappeared, and all I have is the spinning cursor. Should it really be taking this time? I did check to install flash and all that, but I didn't check for it to update.\nEdit: Nevermind. It finished.\n\nA: The Short Answer:\nGenerally... 25 minutes to an hour. I never really timed it, though.\nThe Long Answer:\nCD read speeds may vary by manufacturer, but are usually very slow across the board. The only reason CDs are still used today (IMHO) are as a legacy format (they've been around for a LOOOONG time,)  and also they're cheap to produce en  masse. (A stack of 50 700MB CD's? 20 bucks. A decent 8 GB flash drive usually runs you about $18.)\nYou're much better off using a USB stick if speed is a concern.\n\nIf you want to try a USB stick, you have a few options:\n\n\n*\n\n*UNetbootin\nThis is a very basic live USB creator, it's pretty reliable and works for most Linux distros, except GParted Live and something else.\n\n\n*\n\n*Pendrivelinux\nAnother tried-and-true USB creator, this one lets you create a bootable USB stick from an ISO.\n\n\n*\n\n*The Method Of Eternal Epicness (for lack of a better name ;)\nThis one is my favorite, I actually figured it out while messing around with dd, but the basic idea is that you \"burn\" the ISO to the USB stick directly, without bothering with live usb creators or any of that.\nOn Linux, if your USB drive was the first flash drive you plugged in, you can run:\nsudo umount /dev/sdb*\nsudo dd if=/path/to/the/iso/you/downloaded/filename.iso of=/dev/sdb\n\nOn Windows, you can use RawWrite to write the ISO to the USB stick.\n", "Q: How to minimize PyBitmessage to the system tray? I recently installed PyBitMessage, and now I can't get it to minimize to the system tray. If I click the red X, it just exits (unlike Transmission, which can be configured to \"survive\" being closed - the red X can be made to simply hide the GUI.)\nI was wondering, is there a way to replicate this behavior in Bitmessage, or de we have to wait for the developer to write this behavior into the program? Is there something I can do to Ubuntu itself to hide the GUI?\nRight now, I have rigged up a solution where it lives in Workspace 4 most of the time; I just switch to that workspace whenever I need to use the program. I'd like something a little more \"professional\", though.\n\nA: Currently, you can click the application indicator of PyBitmessage and will see an option to show/hide the application:\n\nClosing the window by clicking on the red X will always quit PyBitmessage. If you think PyBitmessage should behave differently, you should open a bug report in the bug tracker.\n", "Q: How to install my ATI graphic card? my laptop has a ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5650, and I've tried many ways to install the drivers but nothing has worked for me, how can I do it?\nAlso, I'm not sure why but when I put 'lspci -vvnn | grep VGA' it showes me this:\nVGA compatible controller [0300]: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI \n RS880M [Mobility Radeon HD 4225/4250] [1002:9712] (prog-if 00 [VGA \n controller])\n\nVGA compatible controller [0300]: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI \n Madison [Mobility Radeon HD 5650/5750 / 6550M] [1002:68c1] (prog-if \n 00 [VGA controller])\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nA: I recommend to install xserver-xorg-video-radeon, the driver works great in trusty\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-radeon\n\nxserver-xorg-video-nouveau mentioned in this answer is a driver for NVIDIA.\n\nA: AMD still continues to support the ATI Radeon series.

What are the best programs on ubuntu for doing diagnostics and interacting with the hard drive and RAM from terminal?\n\nA: Using the terminal, you can get all kinds of good information from the /proc/ directory.\nUsing the command:\nawk '/MemTotal/{print $2}' /proc/meminfo\n\nYou can extract memory totals. \nUsing similar methods, you can parse the /proc/diskstats file.\nI do not have a one size fits all command line tool for you, but hopefully, this helps you on your way to figuring out a solution to your issue.\n", "Q: Can't Install nvidia driver on ubuntu 13.04 Here's the case.\nMy Computer can boot ubuntu 13.04 but the time it loads my unity session --I have set autologin, the video card chrashes and the monitor blacks out.\nEven if I go console to do the job, because of the autologin, it again chrases.\nThen I decided to go to the single login by adding single on the kernel parameter on grub at boot.

I've seen Android on the iPhone so my assumption is that it is possible.\nThanks for your replies in advance.\n\nA: Honestly, you probably can't do this on your own.\nThat being said, Ubuntu Touch, IIRC, is based in part on Android. So you'd need to take or make a build of Android that runs on iPhone and port Ubuntu Touch to it using these instructions.\n\nA: There was an attempt to get android to run on iOS devices called iDroid. The project is officially dead and I have tried numerous times to contact the original dev to see if he had plans on trying again but to no avail. \nThey do have a GitHub for the last attempt at it but that is only the first step. You would then need something like cyanogenmod (I think is the name) to be able to run on your mock iDroid before attempting to get ubuntu touch to load on your already over stressed device. \nI wish I knew more to help out because I would love to see this come to fruition.

However if you just want to extract the first part(s) of the split archive, you can do it using the Archive Manager application which is installed by default in Ubuntu.\nThe files in a split archive that has missing parts will be extracted by default to a hidden folder, so you will have to use the keyboard combination Ctrl + H to view the hidden folder.\nYou can't extract the files from part of a split archive unless you have all of the previous parts of the archive.\n", "Q: Use CM Roman (latex font) in Inkscape? I made a SVG in Inkscape on Fedora with the CM Roman (latex) font, but when opening the SVG on Ubuntu 12.04, it says it doesn't have CM Roman even though TexLive is installed.\nHow do I use the CM Roman font in Inkscape on Ubuntu?\n\nA: You should actually download and install a ttf or otf version of the Computer Modern Roman font in order to be able to use it in inkscape. I did it in the past, but I have to look up the download link. This might do it: http://cm-unicode.sourceforge.net/download.html. You could also check (and maybe copy) your Fedora fonts directory.\n\nA: It is actually very easy to get the Computer Modern fonts working under Ubuntu, because the fonts can be installed directly from the Ubuntu repositories\nsudo apt-get install fonts-cmu\n\n\"cmu\" is short for \"cm-unicode\". The fonts appear as \"CMU Serif\" and \"CMU Sans Serif\" etc. in font selection screens.\nThis has been tested with version Kubuntu 12.04 LTS.  \nFurther help (in German) related to fonts can be found at http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Schriftarten\n\nA: Maybe the most general answer is to install the package cm-super.\nIt contains Computer Modern font families, including those of the package fonts-cmu.\nsudo apt-get install cm-super\n\n\nA: Export your Inkscape file as a PDF. This will automatically embed the fonts.\nI've tested this with Inkscape installed under Windows 10 and Latex as used as part of a pandoc docker-container.\nWorked like a charm. \n", "Q: Blank Screen after GUI Install I have installed Ubuntu 12.04.2 x64 without a problem at all and I wanted to install the GUI (Ubuntu-Desktop).\nI followed the below Steps:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nUbuntu went through the installation and then the screen on my Acer v193L went black and there is currently no output to the screen.

I live in Iran and many of sites such as BBC WORLD are blocked by our betray government so I don't have access to suchlike sites. Please guide me how I can use Https in the Ubuntu.\nI have address and user+pass for my https account.\n\nA: You are wrong in thinking that https is what you need. What https does is to encrypt the information send between you and the server abroad. It does not allow you to access a server that your government (which you'd better not mention) has blocked.\nYou should really be looking at some of the following things (I am no specialist, so look around the site or ask another question):\n\n\n*\n\n*A proxy How can I configure proxy authentication?\n\n*A VPN connection\n\n*An alternative DNS server\n\n*Tor\n\n\nProbably the best option is to use Tor. It allows for anonymous websurfing. There are some questions on this site about Tor in your country.

In Fedora, I use my preferred account name, which happens to be a fully qualified domain name. By using a fully qualified domain name as my user name across most of my accounts (both on my own computer and across the web), I minimize the chance that my usual user name is taken.\nThere are some services that do not allow this, due to character restrictions, and that is fine. But in Fedora, my usual name works. This is proof that GNU/Linux CAN handle user names that begin with a digit (as mine does) and contain dots. However, *buntu does not allow this, and I have to use a permutation of my name. Ignoring the outright disallowing of dots, *buntu even does fine with digits, but not at the beginning ... Strange.\nIs this a problem? No, not really. I'm not looking for a solution. I just want to know WHY this is. Is this purely arbitrary, or is there some reason for these odd restrictions? Why is *buntu unable to offer as much flexibility in this area?\n\nA: Just to test you could use sudo adduser --force-badname '<whatever-name-you-want>' and add it the relevant groups needed by you (eg. sudo, netdev, sambashare etc)\nLog in, look around, see if nothing breaks. If everything is fine then you could even keep using that username.\n\nA: Probably some processing issue or storage issue with one of the components.

When backing up my home partition it contains a lot of data (the settings) I don't need. So I thought I could create a separate data partition and mount it to ~/Data.

So which Software you prefer.\nPlease suggest me.\n\nA: I'd prefer ImageMagick.\nNote: check applicable privacy laws, as the screenshots may contain confidential data.\nNow, on how to do this:\nYou need to have the ImageMagick package:\n# apt-get install imagemagick\n\nThen, make a Bash script to take the screenshot, save it somewhere (I'm using an example filename of /path/to/your/script.sh) and make it executable (chmod +x /path/to/your/script.sh):\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# change this for a different date format - see: man date\nexport DATE=`date '+%Y-%m-%d_%H%M%S'`\n# display to take the screenshot of\nexport DISPLAY=:0\n# filename to screenshot\nexport SCREENSHOT_FILENAME=\"/tmp/screenshot-$DATE.png\"\n/usr/bin/import -window root \"$SCREENSHOT_FILENAME\"\n\nLast, set up a cron script to do this for you (crontab -e, add this line to the end):\n*/2 *   * * * /path/to/your/script.sh\n\nThis will, every two minutes, try to take screenshots of display 0 (which is the default one; if you have a multiseat setup, you may need to find out which window you need), and save them as timestamped PNGs to /tmp (this is an example location which is likely to exist; you may want to use a different directory).\nCaveats: there is no checking of free space, so the script may fill up all the space in target location. The script assumes the user is logged in at display :0 (if another user is logged in, user is logged in at different display, or there is no X session, the script will fail).\n", "Q: Has my Dell laptop come with partitions? I have done lots of searches, and found lots of useful advice on partitioning the Ubuntu system so that the Ubuntu operating system (/root ?) is in a separate partition to all my files, folders, photos etc. (/home ?).  I have used gparted from the live iso disk to look at partitions.  None of the previous questions I have viewed have been able to answer my exact question.\nMy gparted screenshot looks like this; \n\napologies for poor quality image, grabbed it with my camera).  \nIt seems to be that the Ubuntu system that came on my laptop \"out of the box\" is already partitioned?  With sda2 as the operating system and sda3 as the rest of the disk space for storing files etc.? Is this the case?\nDo I need to do anything else to ensure files etc. are only going to the sda3 partition?  Perhaps I should check mountpoints somehow?\nAny advice really appreciated.\n\nA: Default Ubuntu partitioning\nIn a default installation Ubuntu will create three partitions on an empty hard drive:\n/sda1 boot and root partition mounted on /\n/sda2 a small unmounted extended partition\n/sda5 a swap partition mounted as /swap\n\nThis is likely the partition scheme you have from your laptop coming with a preinstalled Ubuntu. \nIn your case Dell added two additional FAT32 partitions probably with custom tools which seem of little use for Ubuntu. These partition however may be needed for booting (hard to say when we dont know much of their content). As your laptop now has 4 primary partitions no additional primary partition (but still secondary partitions) can be added. This further complicates repartitioning in your case.\nView partition layout\nYou do not need to run gparted from the live CD to just view the partitions. We can do so by running the Disk Utility (search for \"Disk\" in the Dash on pressing Win-Key), or with the following command in a terminal:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nChange partition layout\nYou can change the partition layout not so easily as shrinking the existing partition to allow space for a new partition is needed. Then we may also need to move our home to this new partition.\nThere is nothing wrong with having Ubuntu system files and your HOME on a single partition, even though some people believe it is ieasier to maintain, backup or reinstall your Ubuntu if you keep HOME on a separate partition.\nReinstall easier?\nIn case your installation is new, and you have not yet filled it with important data you may want to consider a fresh reinstall where you can choose the partition layout during installation to create the HOME directories on a separate partition. You may then have to install some hardware specific drivers in addition.\nIf you plan a reinstallation you may also want to see if you want to install a 64-bit Ubuntu or a newer release as your factory installation may be a 32-bit older release only.\nWhat will give me least headaches\nWhatever you plan to do, the least troublesome experience for a beginner is to just leave the system as it is. Make yourself familiar with Ubuntu, and keep regular backups from all files in your /home directory. Then you can always change the partition layout any time later, upgrade, or reinstall your OS.\n\nA: So, from what I can tell in your image, your setup is as follows:\n/dev/sda1 is a system diagnostics partition, probably accessed by some function in your system's BIOS if you need to put it into recovery mode.\n/dev/sda2 (\"OS\") is an image of how the system was when it left the factory. It's not mounted, but can be used to restore your PC to factory settings if needed (again, probably from some functionality in the BIOS)\n/dev/sda3 is the partition Ubuntu is actually installed to (hence being mounted as /)\n/dev/sda4 is an extended partition; this comes about due to a limitation in some filesystems that means they only recognise four partitions. An \"extended\" partition works sort of like a folder for storing more than this number. (At least, that's how I understand it. This is used here only to store /dev/sda5.\n/dev/sda5 is your swap, which essentially acts in the same way as Windows' paging. It provides the system with virtual memory, and allows you to hibernate the system. I'd say it's excessively large here (beyond a couple of gigabytes of physical RAM you probably only need swap >= total RAM), but having more never hurts if you're using the computer for anything memory-intensive.\nAs for unallocated, this is space on the disk which hasn't been assigned to any partition, and won't be used (there'll almost always be a little left over after partitioning, but 1MB out of ~500GB is nothing worth losing any sleep over)\nSo, to put it briefly: yes your laptop has come with partitions - but the only one that anything will actually be stored on is /dev/sda3. If you're really desperate to, you could probably reinstall Ubuntu and repartition so that your /home folder was on a different partition to /, but to be honest I don't see this as being at all necessary. \n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 desktop background problem I have a problem with my desktop background after last update. \nMy Desktop wall paper looks like mosaic and when I open any window, the background keeps the trail of it. \nI've tried running in fail safe graphics more, no fix.

Then it is just a simple matter of following the instructions for creating the machine - in effect you use your windows install disk to install a copy o windows inside your running ubuntu.\nSome terms you may need to get your head around.\nHost OS : for you this is the main OS on your pc (ie ubuntu, the system that comes on when you turn on your computer)\nGuest OS : the OS that you want to run inside your virtual machine (ie windows)\nBridge : you can get you host and guest to communicate, share internet connections, share a HDD (you may need to set up samba on your host to 'serve' a shared disk to windows).\nOne annoyance.\nIf you are running a dual boot system, you can't turn your currently installed version into a virtual machine, which is a pain as mostly when you buy a pc you don't get a copy of the OS.\nOther option.\nIf you have an 'old' windows pc sitting around you can use that and 'remotely log onto it' - it takes a bit of setting up (ie time / security etc).

I just tested it with 12.04 LTS.\nmkdir /home/<user>/kernel/\napt-get source linux-image-`uname -r`\ncp /boot/config-`uname -r` /home/<user>/kernel/linux-lts-quantal-3.5.0/.config\ncp /usr/src/linux-headers-`uname -r`/Module.symvers /home/<user>/kernel/linux-lts-quantal-3.5.0/\n\nNow you should be able to build the kernel or modules:\ncd /home/<user>/kernel/linux-lts-quantal-3.5.0/\nmake prepare\nmake driver/<something>.ko\n\nFor building xfs you would then run make modules SUBDIRS=fs/xfs/.\nThat should be all! \nGood luck!\n\nA: It's dooable. I've been using a modified version of XFS for several years.\nOn Debian Wheezy, I use this:\nmake -C /lib/modules/3.2.0-4-686-pae/build SUBDIRS=/usr/src/linux-source-3.2/fs/xfs modules\n", "Q: How do I install applications in Ubuntu? How can I install applications like Google Chrome on Ubuntu?\nAre there any commands to install an application?\n\nIndex of answers:\n\n\n*\n\n*Basic usage of APT, Synaptic Package Manager and Ubuntu Software Center and how to install .deb files\n\n*List of methods, including offline options, with links to detailed information for each\n\n*Advice for users coming from Windows\n\n*Newer answer on using APT, dpkg and snap methods. Includes adding PPAs and using .sh installers\n\n*Newer answer on KDE's Muon, Gdebi (a graphical installer for .deb packages), and Y PPA Manager\n\n*Installing software from a CD\n\nA: You can install applications different ways.  Terminal, the Ubuntu Software Center, and Synaptic.  \nWith the Ubuntu Software Center, you just open it from the Launcher, and search for the application that you want.\nIf you know the right commands to install via terminal, then you'd just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, you can run the command(s) needed to install the application.\nFor synaptic, it has to be installed on you system.  To install it, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo apt install synaptic\n\nOnce installed, you can open it, and search for the application that you want to install, and just mark it for installation.\nAlso in some cases, you have to download either a .deb file in case of your question about Chrome, and have to manually install it, or a .tar.gz file, and that also have to done manually.\nNow as far as Chrome is concerned, you can install it by downloading the .deb file, or just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nFor 32bit\nwget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_i386.deb\nsudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_i386.deb\n\nFor 64bit\nwget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb\n\nIf you encounter any error during the installation, when its done do\nsudo apt -f install\n\nFor pros and cons of the different ways to install see this Post.\nSource for Chrome installation: Google\nAddition\nInstalling software in Ubuntu can be done several ways:\nUbuntu Software Center\nYou can search for an application, or go through the categories:\n\nSynaptic Package Manager\nYou can search for an application, or go through the categories:\n\nInstalling via Terminal\nInstalling from terminal can be done in several ways:\nAPT\nYou can search for an application.  The command to search for software is:\napt search <application_name>\n\nAdding Repositories:\nEdit the sources list file, and add\nsudo -H gedit /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nOr add from terminal\nsudo add-apt-repository <repository_name>\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install <application_name>\n\nOthers ways you can install\nManual download of a .deb (Debian package):\n\n\n*\n\n*Once downloaded, you can double-click on the package to have it open in the Software Center, from where you can install it.\n\n*Or, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, navigate to the download location, and run the command(s) below:\nsudo dpkg -i <package_name>.deb\n\nOther options:\n\n\n*\n\n*.rpm files are packaged for Fedora or Mandriva, but you can use alien (you can install using Synaptic) that allows you to convert .rpm files to .deb. (may not work all the time)\n\n*.tar.gz files are compressed. If you see the .tar.gz, it could be compressed files that have a pre-compiled binary file, or files that have the source code allowing you to compile the application from source.  To find out how to install from a .tar.gz, see How to install from a .tar.gz.\nFor more info see Installing Software, or A beginners guide to installing programs in Ubuntu\n\nA: Yes, there is an alternative for Windows .exe or .msi files in Ubuntu; that is .deb files. Double clicking on such a file will run the installer.\n\nA: Installing from a CD\nFirst ensure that the CD does contain the applications; sometimes it just brings some info about the apps and a link you can follow to do the installation through the Software Center.\nIf the applications are, in fact, on the the CD, then search in the CD folders to find the applications as .deb or .bin or .tar or .sh files.\nIf it's a .deb file\nJust double click on it and Software Center will install it for you.\nYou can also install them using a command line method.\nIf it's a .bin file\nRename it to .bin32 or .bin64 depending your architecture. You can find that information by running\ndpkg --print-architecture\n\nGo to properties and permit the file to run as a program, then just double click on it and you will open the installer.\nIf it's a .tar file\nDouble click on it and extract everything to a folder of your desire, into this folder you may find an icon with the program name, just double click on it to start the program.\nIf  it's a .sh file\nGo to properties and permit it to run as a program, and then double click on it to start the installer.\n\nA: \nNote: This was written for a more specific question, but it covers techniques that apply here too.\n\nIf I am not mistaken, the chip magazine only offers installers for Windows. You should be able to run these with software called \"WINE\".\nA better way would be to download the *.deb files (or the source code) from the homepages of these programs (if they offer support for Ubuntu) through a friend's PC with a better connection to the internet and to install (or compile) them on your PC.\nBut: chip mainly offers software to tweak you system, you don't need that on Ubuntu ;)\nAnd: the software-center is the 'best' way to get software for Ubuntu (I think). So, if it is a matter of time (and not money) I would prefer getting a cup of tea/coffee over the other methods, because this way you will be able to easily update the software.\n\nA: There are many ways to install packages in Ubuntu. I will try to list the most used methods, giving links to detailed explanations for each one.\n\nInstalling packages with an internet connection\n1. Installing packages via your web browser\nThe APT protocol (or apturl) is a very simple way to install a software package from a web browser.\n2. Installing packages via a basic graphical method\nUbuntu Software Center is a one-stop shop for installing and removing software on your computer.\n3. Installing packages via an advanced graphical method\nSynaptic is a graphical front-end to apt, the package management system in Ubuntu.\n4. Installing packages via text based methods\n\n\n*\n\n*Aptitude - the text-based method\n\n*apt-get - the technical method\n\n\n\nInstalling packages without an internet connection\n1. Using Keryx\nKeryx is a portable, cross-platform package manager that provides a graphical interface for gathering updates, packages, and dependencies for offline computers.\n2. Using the Synaptic package download script\nSynaptic package manager has built-in feature to generate a package download script.\n3. Using apt-offline\napt-offline is an offline text based apt package manager. \n4. Installing downloaded packages\n\n\n*\n\n*.deb packages (here fits the part from the question relating to the installation of Google Chrome)\n\n*.tar.gz and .tar.bz2 packages\n\n*.rpm packages\n\nSource: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingSoftware\n\nA: I'll give you the best methods, starting from the simplest.\n\n\n*\n\n*SIMPLEST: Open the Ubuntu software Center. The fastest way to do this is by hitting start key and typing \"Software...\" till it pops up. This is a complete store. You'll find everything here.\n\n*GEEKY: Ubuntu has by default something called APT. To install any package, just open a terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T) and type sudo apt-get install <package name>. For instance, to get Chrome type sudo apt-get install chromium-browser.\n\n*SYNAPTIC: Synaptic is a graphical package management program for apt. It provides the same features as the apt-get command line utility with a GUI front-end based on Gtk+.\n\n*KERYX: Keryx allows users to select packages to install, check for updates, and download these packages onto a USB portable storage device. The packages are saved onto the device and are then taken back to the Linux box that it originated from and are then installed. This is basically an offline tool to install packages.\n\n\nA: How to install Ubuntu software when you're a (future) ex-Windows user!\n16.04 and higher: Ubuntu Software Center has been renamed to Ubuntu Software\n(Everything else remains the same)\nThe most important thing is to remember that some day you'll have to remove this piece of software that you're going to install, so always use a removal method identical to your installation method.\nTherefore, use the following priority for installing software on Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Forget about what you know about downloading and installing from websites all over the place and use the following priority list on how to install software under Ubuntu because you now have (and want to keep) a stable system.\n\n*For beginning users: first 3 months, up to a year of using Ubuntu\nInstall/remove from the standard Ubuntu repositories using the GUI of the Ubuntu Software (Center). \nAs per below screen shot, click the dash in the upper left corner, type software, click the Ubuntu Software(Center).\n\nThe Ubuntu Software (Center) opens:\n\nand you have a ton of application categories on the left to choose from. Or type the name of the software in the search box in the top right corner (which is what we'll be using)\n\nI'm as amazed as you, but there is indeed crap software for Ubuntu, :-) so just click the crap you want, click on \"Install\", wait a bit and done!\nTo remove software using this method, click on the \"installed\" button on the second screen shot, click the crap you want to uninstall and click the \"Uninstall\" button! Easy-peasy.\nAnd if the software is not there, don't go downloading it from somewhere else and install it using some of the more advanced features below! You're a beginner!\n\n*(Intermediate users, 6 months-1 year of experience)\nUse the TUI of aptitude\nPress Ctrl+Alt+T to go to a terminal and type: \nsudo aptitude\n\nand press Enter\nIf you get aptitude: command not found, type:\nsudo apt install aptitude\n\nto install aptitude and wait until nothing moves any more and then type:\nsudo aptitude\n\nto start it.\n\nThis is still kind of familiar: you can use the mouse, but it's like you're back in 1988 before the WWW was invented. And now comes the first hurdle: RTFM for aptitude  by typing:\nman aptitude \n\nThis is important! aptitude can let you do more advanced things, but is a back-stabbing servant!\n\n*Now on to more advanced stuff: (Use only when directed by knowledgeable people on this site having >5000 reputation + at least one gold badge)\nPress Ctrl+Alt+T and type:\n\n\n*\n\n*apt install szPackageName to install \n\n*apt purge szPackageName to completely remove \n\n*apt remove szPackageName to remove the application, keeping its configuration files. (meaning: you might want to reinstall this sometime later and you just spent a few hours configuring the damn thing and don't want to lose the config!)\n\n\n*Really advanced stuff: (Use only when directed by immortals, that is: knowledgeable people on this site having >10000 reputation + several gold badges)\na. Download and install a .deb file: use dpkg --install szPackageName and dpkg --purge szPackageName and dpkg --remove szPackageName to install, completely remove and remove without config files.\nb. Install a PPA: clearly follow instructions. if anything goes wrong, copy-paste the error, ask a question on this site, insert a link to the question and answer you were following and report back to the immortal!  ;-)\n\n*'Just download and build from source!!!' \nProbably a developer telling you this and he knows nothing about installing and maintaining a stable system without any problems, but has the coolest stuff on the planet!\nDepending on your point of view to be embraced with love or to be avoided like the plague.\nSo if you do download and build from source, use CheckInstall instead of make install to be able to remove this software more easily in the future, like in this example regardless of what the developer says!\n\nA: Comparison table of the tools presented in the below answer\n\n\n\n\n↓ Name  / Format →\ndeb\nSnap\nFlatPak\nAppImage\n\n\n\n\napt/apt-get\n+\n-\n-\n-\n\n\nsnap\n-\n+\n-\n-\n\n\nflatpak\n-\n-\n+\n-\n\n\nSynaptic\n+\n-\n-\n-\n\n\nMuon\n+\n-\n-\n-\n\n\nGDebi\n+\n-\n-\n-\n\n\nY PPA Manager\n+\n-\n-\n-\n\n\nPlasma Discover\n+\n+\n+\n-\n\n\nApper\n+\n-\n-\n-\n\n\nAppImageLauncher\n-\n-\n-\n+\n\n\nApp Outlet\n-\n+\n+\n+\n\n\n\n1. Muon as Synaptic replacement\nAs we already know modern Synaptic is buggy, it often and ineffective rebuilds search index (see bug 1685376 and discussion on community.ubuntu.com).\nSo I suggest to use great tool from KDE - Muon.\n\nBelow is quote from package description:\n\nFeatures of note include:\n\n*\n\n*A powerful, yet intuitive interface\n\n*Fast, accurate package search using the apt-xapian index and the Synaptic search algorithm\n\n*Support for filtering packages by status and category\n\n*Media change support\n\n*Support for configuring packages through the debconf system\n\n*Warn about/disallow the installation of untrusted packages, depending on APT settings\n\n*Uses Polkit for running privileged actions for enhanced security, convenience, and desktop integration\n\n*Power management suspension during package downloads, installations and  removals\n\n*Support for download the latest changelog of a package\n\n*Package screenshots\n\n\nYou can install it with sudo apt-get install muon.\nIt is located in Applications -> System Tools -> Muon Package Manager.\n2. GDebi\n\ngdebi lets you install local deb packages resolving and installing\nits dependencies. apt does the same, but only for remote (http, ftp)\nlocated packages.\n\n2.1. GUI-way - gdebi-gtk\nSingle deb-files may be installed from GUI with gdebi-gtk (which is located in gdebi package - install it with sudo apt-get install gdebi).\nStandard usage scenario: download some deb-file, open its location in file-manager, do right-click on it and select Open with GDebi Package Installer option for installation.\n2.2. console-way - gdebi\nGDebi is useful in terminal too, here exists gdebi command (sudo apt-get install gdebi-core).\nStandard usage scenario: download some deb-file, go to its folder, install it with dependencies by executing the following command: sudo gdebi program.deb.\n3. Search and install software from Y PPA Manager (y-ppa-manager)\nSometimes software is not packaged in official Ubuntu repositories. In this case we need third-party repositories known as PPAs (Personal Software Archives). There are a lot of them on LaunchPad. You can use special page https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas for search.\nBut it is difficult to find such repository for exact package. In that case special utility - Y PPA Manager may help.\n\nOne can install it with\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/y-ppa-manager\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install y-ppa-manager\n\nAfter installation it will be located in Applications -> System Tools -> Y PPA Manager. The most useful thing is Search in all Launchpad PPAs - you can search packages by name, then add its PPA and install needed package.\nBut anyway be careful with software, obtained from PPAs. It may trash your system and cause unpredictable behavior of system.\nNote: if you do not have access to GUI but want to find PPA for some known package name, then you can use python script named pyppasearch as follows\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install python3-requests python3-bs4 python3-launchpadlib\n\ncd ~/Downloads\nwget -c https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anenasa/pyppasearch/main/pyppasearch.py\nchmod +x pyppasearch.py\n\nThen you can run search using below command:\n./pyppasearch.py -c focal -a amd64 firefox-esr\n\nto get results like shown below:\n\nfirefox-esr 91.6.0esr+build1-0ubuntu0.20.04.1 ppa:mozillateam/ppa Focal (amd64)\nSearch is finished.\n\n\nand then add needed PPA manually to the system.\n4. Plasma Discover as GUI for Snap, FlatPak and APT\nIf you are running Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (with any desktop), then you can install Plasma Discover to it and use as GUI for Snap, FlatPak and APT. See this Q&A for details:\nsudo apt-get install plasma-discover \\\nplasma-discover-flatpak-backend plasma-discover-snap-backend \\\nqml-module-qtquick-controls qml-module-qtquick-dialogs kdelibs5-plugins\n\nand you will get universal GUI:\n\n5. Apper\nThe Apper is installable by sudo apt-get install apper breeze on modern Ubuntu versions since 18.04 LTS.\nNote: along with its usual functionality, it is very useful application to list installed\n\nor search for\n\nthe desktop (GUI) applications.\n6. AppImageLauncher\nTo have applications installed as AppImage organized and integrated one can use special application named AppImageLauncher. It maybe be installed for the most recent Ubuntu versions by adding their PPA:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:appimagelauncher-team/stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install appimagelauncher\n\nFor Ubuntu 18.04 LTS one can download a deb-package from the AppImageLauncher author's GitHub releases page.\n7. App Outlet as GUI to search Snap, Flatpak and AppImage\nThere is a new, fresh project named App Outlet.\nIt is installable from deb, AppImage and Snap; it allows to search and install applications:\n\n\nA: Installing from Ubuntu Software\nYou can install applications from the Ubuntu Software application present in your launcher:\n\n\nHere you can search for applications which are present in Ubuntu's repository.\nInstalling from terminal\nSometimes it is easy to install a software directly from the terminal. You can do so by typing in terminal:\nsudo apt install <package name>\n\nex, Firewalll:\nsudo apt install gufw\n\nIf anything goes wrong, you can fix most of them by installing their dependencies as\nsudo apt install -f\n\nInstalling from PPA\nIf a software isn't present in Ubuntu software or is an older version than the latest official release, you can add a PPA (a software repository) and install software from there. You can add a PPA in your Ubuntu by typing this in terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:<PPA NAME>\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install <package name>\n\nInstalling DEB files\nThere are some software (such as Google Chrome) which are present as an executable .deb from their website:\n\nYou can download their executable DEB files and run them by double clicking or through terminal by typing:\nsudo dpkg -i <file name>.deb\nsudo apt install -f\n\nSome applications (such as netbeans) does not come as DEB file, but as a .sh file. You can run them in terminal by typing:\nchmod +x <file name>\nsudo sh <file name> # or\nsudo ./<file name>\n\nSnaps\nA new type of software packaging called \"Snaps\" is also present which is a collection of the software and its dependencies in a single file. It is a single, distro independent setup for installing a software. Many software such as VLC, Blender etc are present as a Snap package. You can find them in the Ubuntu software.\n\nA: Open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T), then type\nsudo apt-get install package-name\nwhere package-name is the name of the package you want to install.\nFor example, to install VLC Player, which is provided by the vlc package: \nsudo apt-get install vlc\n\n\nA: As a complement for local deb files, a small trick:\nMy favorite is sudo apt install path/to/deb:\n\n*\n\n*open the file manager where you have the deb file\n\n\n*open a terminal and write sudo apt install\n\n\n*select the deb in the file manager and drag and drop onto the terminal window\n\n\n*press Enter.\n\nAlso, it is worth mentioning the fact that some programs are available as Appimages. These are similar to portable apps in Windows or to executable applications on Mac. I prefer them to flatpack or snaps because they don't require supplementary installations.\n", "Q: Today Nautilus reverts back to Icon Theme ubuntu-mono-dark although the desktop interface settings is set to Faience-Ocre I run Ubuntu 12.04 Precise. A year ago through Advanced Settings or dconf I set my Icon Theme to Faience-Ocre and my Windows Theme to Adwaita Cupertino L Unity. I kept the GTK+ Theme as Adwaita (default).\nThis morning I was surprised to see Nautilus had reverted back to Icon Theme ubuntu-mono-dark and Radiance Window Theme (both Ubuntu default) while every other application still uses the [dconf] org gnome desktop interface settings i.e. Faience-Ocre Icon Theme and Adwaita Cupertino L Unity Window Theme.\nAlso when launching Nautilus in Super User mode via\ngksu nautilus\n\nNautilus looks as before, the way I want it.\nI went to /usr/share/icons/ and renamed the ubuntu-mono-dark theme as ubuntu-mono-dark.bak . This caused Nautilus to instantly use the gnome icon theme ...\nI don't understand what is going on. Why did the Icon theme revert to default ubuntu-mono-dark in Nautilus only for the user? In the mean time I will use another File Manager.\n\nA: Well I found a fix on this. My Ubuntu 12.04 Precise is fairly modified. I installed many packages from Raring 13.04 to install the latest versions of some software. On some occasions I had to build dummy packages to replace official release packages to take care of dependencies. Then I had to block updates of these dummies when I thought these might be upgraded by Ubuntu Updates with my own script.\nIn addition, Ubuntu Nautilus software is a part of GNOME software. I had to refrain from installing some Raring 13.04 packages because this would break the System Settings --> Updates Available...\nAfter finding some bugs in Nautilus I went to installed a Nautilus 3.4 fork [same version as in Precise] named Nemo which is fully independent of GNOME:\n$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gwendal-lebihan-dev/cinnamon-stable\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get install nemo\n\nAfter logging out and back in, Nemo draws the desktop instead of Nautilus. If you want to continue to use Nautilus for drawing the desktop instead of Nemo, do the following:\nRun the following command so Nemo shows up in the Startup Applications list (it's hidden by default):\n$ sudo sed -i 's/NoDisplay=true/NoDisplay=false/g' /etc/xdg/autostart/nemo-autostart.desktop\n\nAt the same time (before the Nemo installation) when right clicking on the background to change desktop background I realized the pop-up as well was affected by the Theme change.\nAfter rebooting the new File Manager Nemo was working well with the Themes I had set in dconf. But to my surprise Nautilus was again working fine with the Themes ...\nSo maybe it was the Nemo install or maybe I only had to perform a full restart of my Ubuntu 12.04 ... Anyway this rare oddity is solved.\n", "Q: Samba CATIA filename mapping I'm running Ubuntu Server 12.04.2 LTS as an ActiveDirectory connected mail server using dovecot and postfix. All works fine on this part.\nNow we want to export the mail storage for backup purposes. I installed samba and joined it to the domain. This is what my samba share looks like:\n\n[global]\n        mangled names = No\n\n[MailStore]\n        comment = Mail Storage\n        path = /srv/vmail\n        valid users = Administrator\n        force user = vmail\n        force group = vmail\n\nI can now access the mail storage with the Administrator account (which is the one used by the backup application).\nWhen browsing the mail storage I see filenames containing \":\" which is invalid for Windows. Dovecot uses it for adding some sort of status info to the filenames in the maildirs. I want to leave it that way. But Windows cannot read those files.\nSo after some googling I found the following solution supposed to fix it:\n\n[MailStore]\n        vfs objects = catia\n        catia:mappings = 0x22:0xa8,0x2a:0xa4,0x2f:0xf8,0x3a:0xf7,0x3c:0xab,0x3e:0xbb,0x3f:0xbf,0x5c:0xff,0x7c:0xa6,0x20:0xb1\n\nBut although the \":\" (0x3a) is mapped, it has no effect on the filenames when browsing the share with Windows Explorer. The filenames are not changed.\nI've tried mangled names = Yes but that does only clobber up the filenames till unusuability. It converts all filenames with illegal characters into 8.3 format - we cannot use this for recovery. And I don't think it would have an effect on VFS settings anyway.\nSo why does samba not use the VFS module? I can see no errors about it in the logs. And \"locate\" reveals the respective library vfs_catia.so installed. The samba version is supposed to support this configuration according to docs:\n\n# smbd -V\nVersion 3.6.3\n\n\nA: I had the same problem with 12.04 and dovecot, went Googling and have a solution.\nFound  a patch in this post:\nDownloaded the patch (as attachment.bin) and then followed these (old) instructions:\nhttp://www.cmiss.org/cmgui/wiki/BuildingUbuntuPackagesFromSource\non building an Ubuntu package from source.\nYou want the 'samba' package.....\n(create a folder somewhere with space to download 23MB....)\napt-get source samba\napt-get build-dep samba\n\nNow you want to apply the downloaded patch to the file: source3/modules/vfs_catia.c in the samba-3.6.3 folder. I couldn't work out how to apply the diff using 'patch' so applied it manually - it's only 3 lines. Rebuild the samba package, in the samba-3.6.3/ folder:\ndpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -b\n\nMy build borked, but it did create:\nsamba-3.6.3/source3/bin/catia.so\n\nwhich when copied into\n/usr/lib/samba/vfs/catia.so\n\nand restarting Samba gives proper vfs catia character mapping :-)\nThanks to Günter Kukkukk for the patch!!!\n", "Q: Simple shell script I am quite inexperienced when it comes to Linux and now I am setting up the system.

You could look into sys.argv from the sys module to access the command line arguments. If I recall correctly that should allow you to do something like:\npython scriptname.py argument1 argument2\n\nand then access the arguments within scriptname.py using \nimport sys\narg_1 = sys.argv[1]\narg_2 = sys.argv[2]\n\nYou could also develop a whole stack of commands easily with a tool like cliff (Command Line Interface Formulation Framework) .\n", "Q: Ubuntu Touch running on Fairphone - are there agreements? I bought a Fairphone (http://www.fairphone.com) because I've read that it should be open for different OS, e.g. Ubuntu Touch.

While installing, the setup asked me to allocate drive space. I have a ~650GB hard drive that shows up as :C and :D in windows. :C is where I had Windows 7 installed + all user files. Before installation of Ubuntu :D was completely empty with about 400GB of drive space.\nUbuntu automatically chose :D to allocate space on. I decided against using the Advanced Settings because I didn't want to screw things up (and look what happened). It asked me to use the slider to indicate how much space I want for the swap (i think) and just regular storage space. I hastily slid it to where I thought I was giving myself the most free space but I ended up only giving myself 23GB of disk space, and ~400 to the other option.\nI also selected the option to encrypt the /home directory, thinking I was making the right decision. I've downloaded GParted but I can't expand the / (ext4) obviously because its mounted. I also did another stupid thing and unmounted the ~400 part (sda5) thinking that's how I could add it back to ext4. I read somewhere that you can't edit/change/re-size mounted partitions.\n(I tried to post a picture but I don't have enough rep)\nit reads like this though:\n/dev/sda5 (no key) ntfs (mo mountpoint/i unmounted it) 377GiB<br>\n/dev/sda7 (key symbol) ext4 (mountpoint /) 22GiB\n\nbefore I messed it up, sda5 read as:\n/dev/sda5 (key symbol) ntfs (mount point /media/blahnumbersletters/) 377GiB\nI've been searching around and many have suggested I boot the Ubuntu live CD and download LVM and crypt-setup, etc to expand the encrypted partition, but I can't seem to boot with the live CD. I've tried everything, pressing Esc, F2, F4, F10, F12, Del, most of which just take me to the GRUB boot-load program or they take me to the boot options but none of them give me the option to boot from the CD.\nI don't know if this is necessary but my system is a Samsung Laptop NP-QX411.\nI'm completely lost. What do I do here?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: When you installed Ubuntu for the first time, you must have booted from some Live media (CD/DVD/USB) think hard and do the same thing again.\nFirst, You cannot work on partitions from which you booted! Use a Live DVD/USB to boot and use gparted from there. You may be able to increase the size of your root partition but, given that it is encrypted, I doubt it.\nSecond, given the situation you created, it may be best to start over. \nUbuntu needs to create its own type of partitions, ext4, as it cannot use Windows NTFS partition. So your partition called D: cannot be used to install Ubuntu. Delete that partition and create some empty space. Since you are starting over, delete the other partitions created by Ubuntu installation. Now you have a big empty space. \nNow install Ubuntu again. It will find the big empty space and use it to create the partitions in the correct formats, ext4 and Linux-Swap.\nSee a similar question I need to know how to boot ubuntu on an existing Windows XP partition and my answer.\nBest of luck.\n", "Q: Where is the result of the \"apt-get update\" package list stored I have 20 to 3o computers on my network and I have a copy of the debian packages on /var/cache/apt/archives but when I take this downloaded copy to any other machine I need to hit an \"apt-get update\" , How do I avoid this ? Where is the list of packages which is updated by that command stored. I need to copy them as well, and use it on a computer which is completely offline.\n\nA: The packages lists are stored in /var/lib/apt/lists/, copy all the files inside that directory (except lock and partial) to the other computer. You could also copy the .bin files in /var/cache/apt/.\n\nA: Well, the apt-get update command updates the pkgcache.bin and srcpkgcache.bin files in the /var/cache/apt/ directory, so you have to copy those files too.

If you know the port the traffic is on, you can usually identify the protocol and program. That's when most people remember they have Samba turned on sharing their media with the rest of the network and that's why there's so much bandwidth.\nIf you're still clueless after finding out the type of traffic, you can then use packet inspection to look at what's going on. Use something like WireShark to monitor the traffic. You can filter based on the type of traffic and that's when you can extract GET requests (if it's HTTP traffic) and see what sites are being loaded. If it's something else, you'll likely see headers that better identify the traffic type.\n", "Q: Ubuntu won't boot due to missing Bootmgr I had Windows 7 and had to recover to factory settings.

I formated my disk the installation disk to fat32.  I'm still getting the message bootmgr missing.  What can I do?\n\nA: You can download the bootable CD of Gparted, and delete all partitions, and then start the Ubuntu installation from CD.\nOr if you feel comfortable, boot from the Ubuntu CD, and when you get to the Installation Type screen, choose Something Else, \n\ndelete the partitions, and create new ones for Ubuntu.

For example, 2922, or 31822.\n\n*Allow only certain users access to SSH.  This can be accomplished with an AllowUsers directive in /etc/ssh/sshd_config.\n\n*Allow only certain IP address ranges to connect to SSH.  This can be accomplished with your firewall software (eg ufw).\n\n*Rate-limit new connections to your SSH port using your firewall, for example, by using a \"limit\" clause in ufw.  This can reduce the rate that users can try to brute-force your server, although the SSH server does have some of its own ways of dealing with that too.\n\n*Ensure that all users with SSH access have a secure password.  The more characters the better.  8 or more is good, 10 or more is better.  Do allow digits and symbols on a standard keyboard.  Stress the importance of not using dictionary words, famous names or simple patterns.\n\n*Enforce the use of key-based authentication, where the user generates a public-private key pair on their computer and stores the public part on the SSH server, instead of allowing passwords.\n", "Q: How to set default PATH variable I broke the /home/username/.profile file so now I can't access Ubuntu.

To reset the path variable, open a terminal and execute the following command: . /etc/environment.\nThat will restore the PATH variable for the current terminal only!\nTo restore the .profile file copy it from the folder /etc/skel. The /etc/skel folder contains all the files that are copied to the user's home folder when a new user is created.\nAlso take a look at that answer: When I create a new user, how do I automatically create a .virtualenvs directory in their home directory?\nIf you are unable to log-in the you have to use a live-cd and then copy the content of the skeleton folder (/etc/skel) into your home directory.\nUpdate:\nTo access your home or partition using a live-cd you have to mount your harddisk after you bootet up from the live-cd. Open a terminal in the live-cd and type the following:\nsudo mkdir -p /mnt/root\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/root\n\nNow your hard drive is mounted into the folder /mnt/root. Now copy the content of the skeleton folder into your home folder\ncp -r /mnt/root/etc/skel/ /mnt/root/home/<your-user-name>/\n\nThe -r switch is important to copy the hidden files.

But I also read, that Ubuntu fixed the Problem. Is that right? can I install Ubuntu on it, without the risk to kill it?\n\nA: You didn't post your exact model, but the problem is Samsung's, not Ubuntu's.  Samsung didn't follow the UEFI spec and underconfigured the NVRAM -- you can brick those PCs installing another copy of Windows.  Do all your research first to confirm any particular model will work with Ubuntu before buying.  That said, if someone already owns a Samsung with a problem, and it cannot be returned to the vendor, I think setting up an EFI boot from a USB device, to boot a copy of Ubuntu on the hard disk MAY avoid adding to the NVRAM variables.  You'd need to make space on the hard disk, do the Ubuntu install without a boot loader, and manually set up the USB stick to boot first, and have the stick's /EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi be the copy of shim, with the signed copy of grubx64.efi also in /EFI/Boot.  Put grub.cfg into /EFI/ubuntu on the stick, and have it set up to boot the hard disk.  Chancy, but I think that would not alter any NVRAM variables.  Not recommended for a beginner.  \n", "Q: Trouble installing iTunes and reading USB DVD Drive on Ubuntu I am new to Ubuntu and struggling with a few things: \nAn error occurred when checking for updates whilst trying to install something to read iTunes, or at least read music from iPhone.\nI've got this red 'no entry' mark next to my message on tab.\nAnother problem - I tried to read USB DVD drive, but got following message:\nE: Type ‘n’ is not known on line 3 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pmcenery-ppa-maverik.list\n\n\nA: iTunes can't be installed on Ubuntu.Try using some other music player such as RhythmBox or Amarock to manage the music on your iPhone.\n", "Q: want to manually configure ethernet as second (internal) network Running Ubuntu 13.04\nI am trying to configure a machine as a drbl server so I can use clonezilla to master a bunch of machines.  But before we get to that point, I was just testing the networking.   I have an unmanaged, 1Gb switch.  wlan0 is connected to the internet as 192.168.1.149.\n\nI want to setup a second private subnet on eth0.\n\nI tried:\n\nsudo eth0 down\nsudo eth0 up\nsudo eth0 192.169.1.1\n\nThen, on a windows machine, we manually set ip to 192.169.1.3\nWe can momentarily ping each other.  But when I try to run putty from the pc, suddenly the network is unavailable, and ping no longer works in either direction.  The problem is definitely on the linux side, ifconfig eth0 reports no ip address.\n\nEither there is some automated utility changing our network settings, or it could be a firewall.\n\nI tried to run NetworkManager, but get the error \"NetworkManager is already running\"\n\nA: If you go to the \"Edit Connections\" screen from the network drop-down (or the nm-applet), then click on the \"Edit\" button for your wired connection, you can go to the \"IPv4 Settings\" tab and change the \"Method\" drop-down to \"Manual\", allowing you to add a specific IP address (like 192.169.1.1) for the interface.\n", "Q: Can I run Ubuntu on my old laptop? I want to install my first Linux ever, and I have already given up on Mint because it requires PAE, which I believe my processor doesn't support.

If I chose one of these two, would there be some downsides in comparison to Ubuntu?\nI'm talking about the latest versions of these distros, 13.04 I guess.\n\nA: You can try to run Ubuntu with Unity, could work with your graphic card. If the systems runs too slow, you change the Desktop after install and try Xubuntu for example by installing it with\nsudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop\nor try Lubuntu\nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop\nthe software you can use is the same on all systems, only the desktop has less effects Xubuntu less than Ubuntu and Lubuntu less than Xubuntu\n", "Q: How can I get Firefox that I installed manually to open external links? I use the UX and Nightly builds of Firefox from FTP as my default browsers, but they don't open external links (just a new blank window).\nSo for example in a help file that is expected to open with whatever the \"default\" browser is instead Firefox opens just a blank window instead of the actual page when I click on an external link? \nHow can I fix this?\nI've got a custom desktop file to launch the browser in ~/.local/share/applications, and if it makes a difference I'll post its contents here (let me know in the comments).\nHere are the contents of the .desktop file:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nVersion=1.0\nHidden=false\nTerminal=false\nIcon=/usr/share/icons/fs-icons/apps/scalable/firefox-original.png\nName=Firefox Nightly FTP Build\nComment=Firefox Nightly FTP Build\nExec=/home/rolandixor/bin/firefoxui/firefox\nPath=/home/rolandixor/bin/firefox\n\n\nA: The .desktop file is the key here because it not only configures how an application is opened from the Unity launcher (see Unity Launchers And Desktop Files) but also how it is used to open a specific file when called from the file manager, etc.\nIn order for the latter to work correctly, the .desktop file needs to specify how to pass arguments to the command being called. This is done using field codes in the Exec line which will be substituted with real values when the command is called.\nIn your case, your original .desktop file did not specify how to tell Firefox which URL to open, so Firefox was called with no arguments and just opened on your default home page.\nThe field code to insert the URL in the command line is %u so adding this as an argument to the firefox command in the Exec line of the .desktop file solves the problem. For example, the standard firefox.desktop file uses the line:\nExec=firefox %u\n\nFor reference, the standard file can be found at /usr/share/applications/firefox.desktop if you have installed from a package; it is generated by firefox.desktop.in as found in the firefox repository on Launchpad.\nFor further information about Exec field codes in .desktop files, the specification is available on the freedesktop.org website.\n", "Q: Root password not recognized when attempting to install third party software on Ubuntu 13.04W Why is my root password not recognized when installing third party software on Ubuntu 13.04?\n\nA: Ubuntu uses sudo and by default the root account is locked.\nSee: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo\n\nA: Use the following command to enter the super user (root) mode:\nsudo su\n\nThen enter the root password.\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu from zipped files I just downloaded Ubuntu and have a huge pack of zipped files.

So far I've tried logging in again, restarting my computer, and uninstalling, then installing guake again. No results.\n\nA: In the Guake options, check that the 'Default interpreter' is . Also maybe check what your user shell is: 'finger ' should give it to you.\n\nA: check that your default shell for guake really is /bin/bash. I set it to /bin/sh and that reproduces your behaviour exactly, since it won't use the bash PS1 line. To see that setting do: right click > preferences > general > default interpreter. By default this was set to <default interpreter>. I do not know how guake determines that, but I'm guessing this is determined by some environment variable and that you had a problem with that enviroment variable. To \"fix\" the problem for now, try to set the default shell to /bin/bash. To fix it in a better way, find out how guake determines the default interpreter and check that it is correct.\n", "Q: Twitter \"Authentication Error\" Turpial & Choqok (latest versions) I use Turpial a lot, but Turpial isn't connecting at all. I can still connect to Twitter thru the OS app (no issues signing in through Online Accounts) and of course I can still sign in using the browser, but Turpial gives me an \"Authentication Error\" and Choqok fails to do anything.\nI've tried changing my password, revoking the Turpial and Ubuntu apps in Twitter and re-enabling them, but then it gives me an \"Invalid Credentials\" message. I've even removed and installed Turpial multiple times, still nothing.\nI can't find any information or resources for this type of error from Turpial online. I think it may be something recent after finding this message elsewhere:\n(article related to \"Birdie\") It looks promising i'm currently using it atm, since all the other twitter clients    no longer work due to the API 1.0 shutdown (posted today)\nI've never used Choqok before today, so I don't even know if I've set it up properly. It's failing to retrieve or send Tweets it just blank screens, but at least it signs in.\nI've figured that this isn't an issue with Ubuntu, or Turpial or Choqok, or the router (already replaced it today), so I don't really know what I'm dealing with here. I hope it's not another API issue, Facebook did something similar just a few weeks ago \n\nA: Just like previous answers said, Twitter shut down its 1.0 API Wednesday, June 12th 2013. Now Twitter clients have to use the new and controversial 1.1 API. As a consequence, Twitter clients which have not implemented the 1.1 API support yet will be broken until they implement it. Twitter clients for Linux (and Ubuntu) are in different situations :\n\n\n*\n\n*Polly and Birdie both support this 1.1 API. You can use them seamlessly.\n\n*Choqok and Turpial did not currently support the 1.1 API. So they will not work until their developers implement the 1.1 API support. \n\n*Hotot's case is a bit different. It officially do not support 1.1 API however it is \"1.1 ready\". There is a tweak in the settings which enables Hotot to work partially. For exemple, mentions and lists will not work at all, unlike displaying timelines and posting a tweet. To make Hotot work with the 1.1 API, go to Preferences > Advanced and set the \"API Base\" parameter to \"https://api.twitter.com/1.1/\". Restart Hotot after that. Its variant for Google Chrome (and Chromium too) \"Hotot for Chrome\" supports 1.1 API just like Polly and Birdie.\n\n\nA: I use Turpial, and I'm getting the same \"Authentication Error\" error. I also tried to use Choqok and Hotot but they doesn't work either. If I check the  authorised apps for my account in the browser, Hotot has been added, but it's doesn't work. I have tried to install TwwetCaster on my Android, in order to check if the oauth works, an it does, so I think  mobile apps work. \nReading what you say about API 1.0 shutdown, I think these apps haven't switched to the new API.  The developers should be updating their applications to support the new API but it may take some time before the updated applications become available to the Software Center.\nSo don't worry, the problem is not yours. Some Windows apps have been reported to have the same issue.\n\nA: I use Polly twitter client version 0.93.7 on linux just now and it works. You can download the last release 0.93.9 https://launchpad.net/polly\n\nA: I found a twitter client that works with the new API. It's called Polly, maybe is too simple, but it works, so I'm using it untill Choqok will be  back. (Choqok is going back, https://twitter.com/choqok. Unfortunatelly, I think Turpial not, or al least not for now)\nInstall:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:conscioususer/polly-daily && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install polly\n\n\nA: You can use this patch to get Choqok working while we get the official release.\nhttp://tech.chandrahasa.com/2013/06/19/choqok-patch-for-twitter-api-1-1/\n", "Q: Can I run these games on my system? I have an Ubuntu PC with these specs:  HP G62-378CA .\nI would like to know if I would be able to run Team fortress 2 and/or Counter Strike Source.\nThanks.\n\nA: The specs on the page you refer to seem promising. Of those I would only point to an issue if your ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4250 Graphics Is less than 512MB (The specs reads: Up to 1917MB but it doesn't mean that it already has that amount of MB).\nYour microprocessor is good enough to have a good experience when playing but you may expect some lag and choppy graphics, especially on Team Fortress 2.\nCounter Strike will run smoother.\nJust make sure that your GPU is good for 512MB min and install. As I say, you will be able to run it, but the results will depend on your Microprocessor's speed and GPU physical memory.\nGood luck!\n\nA: You have more than enough CPU and RAM for this games and looking at your \nATI Mobility Radeon HD 4250 Specs, I can see it supports DirectX 10.1 and Shader 4.0. With this in mind and knowing that the hardware is far superior to the recommended requirements I can give you 2 alternatives:\nIf you are going to use Wine with the proprietary ATI drivers then yes, they will work and run perfectly with or without Steam. Your hardware is way above the one this games need as seen here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Team Fortress 2\n\n*Counter-Strike Source\nIf you are going to use Steam (Without Wine) it is still needed for you to install the Proprietary drivers. The open source ones are not yet to the level of performance of the Proprietary ones. For the drivers please see What is the correct way to install proprietary ATI Catalyst Video Drivers (fglrx) directly from AMD?\nIn both cases you need:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the Proprietary Drivers if you wish to have the best performance while playing the games.\n\n*In the case of Team Fortress 2, even though the steam app link does not mention Linux of the hardware requirements it is supported.\n\n*Your only problem might be some OpenGL Texture Compressions missing (Even after installing the Proprietary Drivers). For this simply do the following on the terminal:\nsudo apt-get install libtxc-dxtn-s2tc0\nWith all of this in mind you should be more than fine running those games on Ubuntu (Specially via Steam).\n", "Q: Application running in foreground?

For  the  GUI  version, Vim will not fork and\n                  detach from the shell it was started in.\n\nWhat does this mean?\nI encountered this option when trying to make the global menu work for gvim from How to get global application menu for gvim?. \nI thought it would be that gvim -f file & would show gvim and gvim file & wouldn't. But they both seem to have same behavior.\n\nA: The difference should be more apparent if you try it from a terminal without the ampersands.

I had a spare HDD going, after switching to an SSD for my Windows 7 installation. So, I felt it would be relatively safe to experiment with Linux on the empty drive.\nI installed Ubuntu using the recommended settings (after fumbling about with partitions and swap space and, I think, managing to install Ubuntu without a boot loader, and everything seemed to be fine, and I was pleased to discover a menu that offered multiple boot options, including the newly installed Ubuntu and Windows 7 on the other disk.\nWhen I select Ubuntu, it loads and operates perfectly. When I select Win 7, it gives me the invalid EFI error. When I change the boot order to use the SSD first, Win 7 loads as it had always done. No problem with my installs, I'm guessing the problem is with the boot manager.\nAfter looking at similar questions and threads about the EFI issue, I install and run boot-repair, choosing the recommended/default option. It mentioned an issue to do with GPT (which I can't quite remember at the minute) and suggested enabling the separate EFI partition option, which I did and re-ran it to no avail. I have not yet tried the other advice in the error message, which was to create the partition with something like GParted.\nI tried to install rEFInd from the debian package, but it errored and did not complete.\nAny advice on how to either fix my issue, or correctly install rEFInd (if that would help) would be appreciated.\nI'd prefer not to have to change the boot order every time I want to change OS, especially since I'm using a wireless keyboard that isn't detected during start-up.\nIt's a 64-bit machine.\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/5758960/ - My boot-repair output.\nEDIT: Tried reinstalling rEFInd, apparently it worked this time, though the Windows 7 option only sent me into what I think is GRUB, where it's Windows 7 option still gave the invalid EFI error.\nI read in this thread, Invalid EFI file path, how the windows loader may have been renamed. Renaming the file as per the instructions only yielded an error when launched from rEFInd. Is the grubx64.efi file relevant?\nEDIT 2: There is a bootmgfw.efi in the Windows folder on the SSD, is it worth trying to point the grub.cfg chainloader parameter at that?\n\nA: Your Windows installation seems to be on an MBR disk. Given that Microsoft ties the partition table type (MBR vs. GPT) to the boot mode (BIOS/CSM/legacy vs. EFI/UEFI), this means that Windows was almost certainly installed in BIOS mode. The fact that you've got Windows boot loaders on /dev/sdb and /dev/sdc further supports this analysis. Mixing a BIOS-mode Windows with an EFI-mode Linux is tricky, and GRUB can't handle it.\nThe easiest solution, but one that's not guaranteed to work, is to edit the /boot/efi/EFI/refind/refind.conf file (or wherever you've installed rEFInd). Uncomment the scanfor line and ensure that hdbios is listed among the options. If you're lucky, that will create a new icon in rEFInd that will enable it to redirect the boot process to a BIOS-mode boot loader. This won't work if your firmware lacks a CSM, though; and it also won't work if your CSM is set to boot only from /dev/sda. Still, it's an easy enough thing to try, and if it works it should get things running just fine. Note that if you go this route, you'll probably want to remove the /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft directory (from Linux), since it clearly  doesn't contain a real Windows boot loader, just a copy of GRUB created by Boot Repair. (That's why selecting Windows from rEFInd launches GRUB.)\nAnother solution is to install the BIOS-mode version of GRUB (from the grub-pc package; installing it should automatically uninstall the EFI-mode version of GRUB) and reconfigure your firmware to boot only in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. The latter part of the task is impossible to describe in detail because how you do this varies from one computer to another.\nIf all of this fails, you may need to convert /dev/sda from GPT to MBR. You can do this with gdisk: Launch gdisk on the disk, type r to enter the recovery & transformation menu, type g to convert from GPT to MBR, type p to view the partition table to verify that all your partitions are included, and type w to save the changes. You'll then need to re-install a BIOS-mode version of GRUB. (This whole process is basically a last-ditch effort to get the computer booting in BIOS mode rather than in EFI mode.)\n\nA: Definitely the \"chainloader +1\" is wrong for an EFI boot, but I thought boot-repair fixed those to be like \"chainloader (${root})/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bkpbootmgfw.efi\"  Note the \"bkp\" in the name (maybe at end), that's the original Windows bootloader.  You should have a separate efi partition on the new ubuntu disk, but maybe the installer actually mounted the one on the ssd (If you ran the install from the \"try\" desktop, you could have a shell ready to unmount the wrong efi and mount the right one).  If the EFI is empty on the new disk, just set it up manually -- copy the one on the SSD would work.  Now, the grub.cfg file for 12.04.2 I think sits in the EFI partition, NOT in /boot/grub, so maybe that's how boot-repair missed the fix. Check the two files, the /boot/grub/grub.cfg and /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu/grub.cfg, and fix up the one in the EFI path (should just be able to copy the other one if that's the one boot-repair fixed for you).  13.04 changed things, so the EFI path grub.cfg pulls in the other one.\n\nA: Your Windows is installed in Legacy mode, but Ubuntu is installed in UEFI mode. This cannot work.\nYou need to convert Ubuntu in Legacy mode.\nTo do so:\n\n\n*\n\n*via Gparted, delete your sda1 partition. In the freed space, create a BIOS-Boot partition (unformatted filesystem, bios_grub flag).\n\n*then run Boot-Repair 's Recommended Repair\n", "Q: Trying to change kde setting something changed the font/font rendering and I can't go back I was going through list (the first post)...\nI changed some of the settings and some other things in the system menu, but somewhere for some reason, the font of most applications changed, and now they seem thinner and don't seem to render correctly:\n\nI went through what I think was all the options I changed and can't seem to bring back the correct/better rendering.\nI didn't change anything in the font management.\nIn the application appearance > style > Fine tuning I now have it set to high resolution high cpu, but it doesn't help.\nIn the dektop effects > All effects menu, there doesn't seem to be anything related.\nWorkspace appearance is untouched.\nI'm not sure what could it be.\n\nA: In Application Appearance > Fonts, is Use anti-aliasing set to System Settings?

As the title states, I have a few large archives (currently in .7z and .tar.gz format) stored on a remote location which I access via sshfs.

In other words, I'd like to be able to extract a file from a large archive without any delay.\n\nA: I don't know of anything which meets all of your requirements. However, I might have something which will still work\nIf your needs are read-mostly, instead of creating a compressed archive (eg. tar.gz), consider creating a SquashFS image instead. SquashFS is a read-only compressed filesystem.\nYou would then be able to access that image file via sshfs and mount that as a loopback device.\nSince this is a complete filesystem, directory traversal, data access, etc. will be limited to only the particular blocks required.\n\nA: zip, 7zip, and dar ( in non solid mode ) have this property.  They do this by storing a table of contents and compressing in smaller blocks so only the blocks containing the files you want to extract need to be decompressed.  This does result in slightly less compression though.\n\nA: It's has become regulation in every UNIX and Unix-like platforms. Because UNIX's philosophy that application must attempt to complete single task perfectly. So there's no one applications that brings archiving and compression together.\nThe advantage, you can combine one archiving application with any compression applications. Example combining tar with gzip (tar.gz) and tar with lzma (tar.lz).\nMaybe propiertary applications provide what you want such as WinZIP, but it only available for another paid UNIX (OS X) \n", "Q: Delete Files To Trash Ubuntu 13.04 dual-booting next to Pre-installed Win 8.\nI can only delete files to the trash can when I am in the home directory, even for files which belong to me (usually inside /var/www). Selecting the file in nautilus and hitting delete does nothing. Right clicking and selecting delete asks me if I want to delete permanently. Here's what I know:\n\n\n*\n\n*These are files owned by me. /var is owned by root, but www (and all files within) are owned by me.\n\n*I have a Trash folder at /home/(name)/.local/share/Trash; it seems to work fine for files I want to delete from my home directory.\n\n*This machine was a Win 8 Machine which gave me a lot of trouble getting Ubuntu to run alongside on; I am not sure if this is an issue. When I created the partitions, I made a home partition separate, so I am thinking this is probably my problem.\n\n\nHere is my fstab.\nThis blog post looked like the exact problem I have, but I am not experienced enough with fstab to get this to work. I tried adding my UID to /:\nUUID=bb3ada65-be09-4b18-b091-9b3c95534cfd /               ext4    errors=remount-ro,uid=1000 0       1\nBut then fstab couldn't load when I rebooted, and I had some trouble getting my system to load back up - don't really want to experiment with this since it takes so much time just to try something out.\nedit: after reading the man for fstab a bit, it looks like UID is an option for fat; / is ext3 so this isn't the problem, I am guessing.\nedit2:\nMy permissions seem fine:\ncd /var/www\ntouch test\\ doc.txt\nls -la\n...\n-rw-rw-r--  1 tom  developers        0 Jun 12 16:55 test doc.txt\n...\nrm test\\ doc.txt\n\nNotice I don't need sudo for creating or deleting the file from the cli, nor do I need to be root to delete in nautilus - I just can't delete to my trash for some reason.\n\nA: When nautilus trashes something, it doesn't want to have to move it across partitions. This is because it takes a lot longer to move between partitions, and then if you remove the partition then the trash has no place to restore to.\nAnywhere that is on the same partitions as your home directory is sent to ~/.local/share/Trash. This works across the entire root partition on setups which only have one partition.\nOn any other partition nautilus will make a .Trash-1000 folder on the root of the partition, then send all trashed files into that. This works rather well on external drives that you have full read/write access to, though it won't work if you don't have write permission to the root of the drive.\nBecause your / partition isn't the same as your /home partition, and a .Trash-1000 doesn't exist with write permission at the root of your system, nautilus will fail to trash files. Thus the delete key won't work and a trash action won't be available in the menus.\nYou could try using a root nautilus and deleting one file so that the /.Trash-1000 folder is created correctly, then using sudo chmod -R 777 /.Trash-1000 to give yourself permission to access a trash on the / filesystem. I cannot confirm that this will work though you could give it a try.\n\nA: Perhaps you could try finding out what happens if you use Nemo instead of Natilus. Nemo is the default browser of the Cinnamon desktop. It has, among other features, the ability to \"directly\" delete files, bypassing the trash bin. Just right-click the file or folder you wish to remove, and select \"Delete\" (as opposed to \"Move To Trash\").\nI think that most users get it by installing it as part of Cinnamon. However, you can easily install Nemo separately using:\nsudo apt-get install nemo\n\nThen, from your terminal, just type nemo to open nemo. Optionally, you can type \nnemo '/directory/subdirectory/subdirectory2/'\n\nto launch Nemo into whatever directory you wish.\nIf all this sounds too complicated for you, you might want to consider deleting from the Terminal. Just use \"rm (file)\" for files, or \"rmdir (directory)\" for directories. Or, there might be some way to add this option to Natilus, but I currently don't know how to accomplish this.\n", "Q: How to tell if my Laptop has UEFI New user here and I would like to know how do I tell if my Toshiba Satellite Laptop A665-S5173 with Windows 7 Home Premium, 64-bit Intel Core i5 1st Generation processor with 4GB of RAM has this UEFI firmware?\nI want to try Ubuntu and first run it off a CD before I actually install it to my hard drive, but it tells me if I have this UEFI I should download the 64-bit version or otherwise the 32-bit version.\nAlso, which version number of Ubuntu should I download, 12, 13, etc.?\n\nA: \nOpen setupact.log and search for this string:\nCallback_BootEnvironmentDetect: Detected boot environment:\n\nIt should tell us the boot environment: BIOS or UEFI:\nCode:Callback_BootEnvironmentDetect: Detected boot environment: BIOS\nCode:Callback_BootEnvironmentDetect: Detected boot environment: UEFI\n\n\nA: UEFI is neither here nor there; if your CPU supports 64 bit, then use the 64 bit version, otherwise 32.

I have seen EFI partitions/directories on non UEFI machines. The best way to tell is look in the BIOS/UEFI settings.  Just because your machine is UEFI capable does not mean it has ewven been turned on.\n  Microsoft's demand to have secure boot on Windows 8 preinstalled machines forced the vendors to jump into UEFI, since secure boot is a subset of UEFI.  The vendors generally weren't prepared, and mangled many implementations, not even following the standard.  With an older machine, you can use either 12.04.2 or 13.04 (with longer support available for 12.04.2).  Newer machines, generally have fewer problems with drivers with the latest release.\n\nA: It doesn't have UEFI. UEFI is implemented on machines that ship with Windows 8, and Windows 7 doesn't support it.\nThe other inquiries should be separate questions themselves, but you should download the 64 bit version of either Ubuntu 12.04 or Ubuntu 13.04. Ubuntu 13.04 is the option I go for because you get the latest and greatest software shipped with Ubuntu.

It is treated as a raw block device with a filesystem directly on it. In emergency cases, this allows the backing device (/dev/sda2 or /dev/sdb2) to be booted directly. There was previously an short-lived installation of LVM on this partition, but this was deemed unneeded so the device was reinitialized as a raw ext3 device. This did not successfully remove all traces of LMV, however. This results in the utility wait-for-root returning 'LVM2_member' as the device type. It has done this all along.\nSecond, updates to the boot script 'scripts/local' changed the mount command from:\nmount ${roflag} ${ROOTFLAGS} ${ROOT} ${rootmnt}\nto:\nmount ${roflag} ${FSTYPE:+-t ${FSTYPE} }${ROOTFLAGS} ${ROOT} ${rootmnt}\nMount now fails because we are forcing the type of filesystem into the mount command. In this case, the type 'LVM2_member' doesn't work at all - we need ext3 instead. The old version worked because mount was easily able to determine that this was an ext3 filesystem.\nThe short-term work-around for this is to pass in rootfstype=ext3 on the kernel boot line. This ignores the improperly auto-detected filesystem type and specifies ext3 to mount.\n", "Q: How to turn on and start openstack and openvswitch on a single machine? I have a 32-bit version of Ubuntu 13.04 running in my desktop. \nMy intention is to turn ON and start both openstack and openVswitch in my desktop, such that I could get some practical experiment out of operating the twos. I just do NOT know how to turn them ON and configure them, could you please provide me with pointers to articles, which explain how these are supposed to be done CORRECTLY?\n\nA: Just for playing with openstack, take a look at DevStack.  It's a nice way to start up everything and play around. Not sure if you need to be running 64 bit mode though. Need to have machine that supports virtualization.\nThere are several automated provisioning packages out there for OpenStack, Ubuntu has one with Juju, Vagrant (has a devstack box), and many more, but for just starting it on one machine to learn more about it devstack is nice, IMHO.\nRef: http://devstack.org/\n\nA: OpenStack is not normally deployed on only a single machine. You can use the virtual-maas Juju charm to deploy something that can be used to provide enough virtual machines to run OpenStack services.\nThe nested VMs will be slower than \"native OpenStack\", of course, but if you don't have half-dozen or more actual machines to use for testing OpenStack, this is a starting point.\n\nA: If you install Openstack via the installer:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/cloud/install-ubuntu-openstack\nIt provides you with an option to do a Single install. What this option does is deploy all openstack services on a single machine with a single network device. The single install path utilizes KVM, LXC, and OVS to accomplish this.\nThis is also perfect for a single machine as the entire deployment is done within a single container.\n", "Q: Network connectivity on Xubuntu 13.04 lost I recently upgraded from Xubuntu 12.10 to 13.04 and not long after (though not immediately after) I have lost network connectivity.\nSometimes I can ping 8.8.8.8 and sometimes I can't.

The default size of history in Ubuntu is 1000 but it's too small.

This will change these environment variables' values globally.\n\nA: I tried the same thing, only to discover that sneaky Ubuntu sets these variables in ~/.bashrc by default, which is executed instead of ~/.profile for non login shells such as just opening a terminal window. Changing these lines in ~/.bashrc fixed it for me:\n# for setting history length see HISTSIZE and HISTFILESIZE in bash(1)\nHISTSIZE=1000\nHISTFILESIZE=2000\n\n", "Q: System Monitor and free don't say the same I use System Monitor to check free RAM:\n\nBut free don't say the same:\ntuankiet65@UbuntuPC:~$ free\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:       8092368    7666932     425436          0     444560    3309676\n-/+ buffers/cache:    3912696    4179672\nSwap:      8370172     537836    7832336\n\nSo, which one is correct? System Monitor or free?\n\nA: Both. System Monitor consider buffers and cahced memory as free.\nCached – Here things get a little more confusing. This number does not include the Free portion of memory. And yet imight see that it is larger than the Available area of memory. That’s because Cached includes cache pages on both the “standby list” and what is called the “modified list.” Cache pages on the modified list have been altered in memory. No process has specifically asked for this data to be in memory, it is merely there as a consequence of caching. Therefore it can be written to disk at any time (not to the page file, but to its original file location) and reused. However, since this involves I/O, it is not considered to be “Available” memory.\n", "Q: Why am I getting 'package cannot be authenticated' errors for google-chrome?

I would love to make a portable hard drive with the bootable version of Ubuntu on it and be able to save my files and settings to the same hard drive. So in short when I plug it into computer A and make a word document I would like to save it to the desktop and then when I plug it into computer B the file is there on the desktop, Along with my other settings. \nI would like if I could do that with any computer I can boot Ubuntu on too. If anyone knows how to make this would I would be extremely happy if you could help me out with this. I am new to Linux and don't know too much so if you could explain it to me like I am 5 years old I would appreciate it. \n\nA: What you are asking is already possible with a HDD (Hard Drive) or SSD (Solid State Drive). You can simply insert any hard drive or SDD, install Ubuntu on it and be able to insert that same drive in other computers and it will work perfectly. Linux in general is actually not dependent of the hardware you install it in. If you install Ubuntu on an AMD computer with 4 GB of RAM and an Asus motherboard, then take the hard drive out and insert it into an Intel computer with 2 GB of RAM and an Intel motherboard, it will work without any problems.\nThe only exceptions are the proprietary drivers that are needed for some hardware, mainly Nvidia, Ati, Broadcom and Mac OS Computers. But you can remedy this by installing the drivers the first time you get to one of this scenarios. You won't need to do it a second time.\nNow if you wish to create an installer on a Flash Drive, well you can use what karel says on his answer or as an alternative you can use the tool that comes by default with Ubuntu called Startup Disk creator. For this particular case where you want to either install Ubuntu on a HDD/SDD or a Flash Drive, you would need to execute the Disk Creator from the terminal with an additional parameter:\nusb-creator-gtk --allow-system-internal\n\nThis will show you all the drives on the system (All storage devices).\nWhat I would suggest would be to simply make a LiveUSB using the Startup Disk Creator, run the LiveUSB and either insert another Flash Drive or HDD/SDD and install the system on that unit. This way you have a LiveUSB that installs Ubuntu (Portable) and a Flash Drive / HDD / SDD that has Ubuntu already installed and is also portable.\n\nA: Assuming you're currently running Windows, you should be able to follow These Directions. At the bottom of the window you'll notice a slider that lets you decide how much space should be used for persistent storage (set to 0 by default). Before clicking the Create button, make sure to adjust this to whatever size you see fit. Or, if you're running Ubuntu See Here.

Now while installing when I select something else in the install Ubuntu menu, there I should see a free space that I managed by shrinking a volume by 45 GB. But it didn't show that free space.  Now my Win 7 has partitions like this\n\nBut in Ubuntu installation it shows a partition of win loader of 1 MB, one partition of 100 MB, 1 of 50 GB and 1 of 250 GB.\nPlease help me out in this..\n\nA: As per your partition table shows 5 partitions using windows disk management. But MBR will allow maximum 4 partitions. I think after you shrink, you formated the unallocated space as partition J in NTFS system. You must unallocate the partition again using windows disk management.\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete partition J:\n\n*If possible merge partition D: and E:\n\n*Now start the computer with ubuntu installer and select \"Install ubuntu alongside Windows7\", ubuntu will use the unallocated space of 44.33GB\n\n\nA: First, take a look at gertvdijk's comment. I'm an unaware of Dynamic Disks. As evident from his links, it seems that Ubuntu cannot be dual-booted with Windows on dynamic disks. So, if you managed to convert the disk to basic and everything is intact, you can follow my answer.\n\"Free space\" or \"unallocated space\" means a space that is unpartitioned. In your case, you shrunk the D: drive by 45 GB and then you created an NTFS partition from that space (partition J).\nAt this point, you have two options to install Ubuntu: either manually install Ubuntu on that partition, or delete the partition to make an \"unallocated space\". Here are their explanations:\nDelete the partition to leave an unallocated space\nGo to the Windows Disk Management, right click on the New Volume (J:) partition and choose to delete it. That way, you deleted the partition, but the space is still there as \"unallocated\". Now, when you start the Ubuntu installation, you'll get an Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7 option. This option will tell Ubuntu to use up all that unallocated space we created. So choose that option. I think this option was the one you were going for, but you made the mistake of created a partition from that free space, therefore that option was not available to you.\nInstall Ubuntu on that partition:\nI advice against using this method. I'll mention why in the end. Now, since you've already created a partition from that space you shrunk, you can manually instruct Ubuntu to install itself there. To do this: choose the Something Else option while installing. You say you didn't see the partition, but you probably missed it because it should be there. It will probably be marked as /dev/sda5, logical partition, with an ntfs type. Once you identify that 45 GB partition, double click it, choose the file system to be ext, choose the mount point as /, choose to \"format it\" if you get the option, hit OK, and then click Next (or Install) to begin installation. Make sure you chose the correct partition! Now, when you begin the installation, Ubuntu will install on that partition. The reason why I advice against this method is that there's actually an extra step that should be taken. You'll have to shrink that 45 GB space a bit (let's say to 40 GB) and use that remaining 5 GB space for a swap partition. This is an extra partition that is optional, but is essential for Ubuntu to work fast, and is almost always created. This step will be already taken care of if you go with the first method I explained and chose \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7\". Ubuntu, on it's own, will create one partition for itself and another partition for swap. That's why, if you with that \"alongside\" option, you'll actually find that the Ubuntu partition is not all of that 45 GB, but will be about 41 GB.\n\nA: When the partitions are in dynamic mode, Ubuntu 12.04 will not get installed along side Windows 7. In fact it won't show any of the partitions while installing Ubuntu. Even though if it shows the partitions, you can't select the partition for installing. I faced the same situation.\n", "Q: Update Pidgin using apt-get How do i update only pidgin using apt-get?\nI tried\n> sudo apt-get update pidgin\n\nbut i get \n> The update command takes no arguments\n\n\nA: To update Pidgin to 2.10.7, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal.

Using this method no VPN is necessary so no VPN is configured, just a plain ethernet connection.\nHowever this does not work. It keeps trying to connect and never manages with all the notifications coming.\nWhen I leave the 'cloned MAC address' box empty then it connects fine, I see the connect icon OK but I am unable to access the internet (either via command line with wget or firefox) because i am not authenticated (i think they have a proxy or something, wget www.ibm.com respondes with \"proxysg1...Authorization failed')\nSo what I did was to edit /etc/network/interfaces to become:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n# clone mac address so we can get in net as instructed by IT\nhwaddress ether XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX\n\nThen I realised (new to Ubuntu,old to linux) that this is not enough and I had to remove network-manager alltogether in order to start using ifup/down etc. Which I did.\n% apt-get purge network-manager\n% ifup eth0\nno problem there, dhcp is called and we get ip with no errors and then starts the ssh server.\n\n% ifconfig\nresults are below:\neth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX  \n          inet addr:10.10.80.125  Bcast:10.10.80.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n          inet6 addr: fe80::200:aff:fe00:40/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:2529 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:419 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:263993 (263.9 KB)  TX bytes:58880 (58.8 KB)\n          Interrupt:16 Memory:d2200000-d2220000 \n\nlo        Link encap:Local Loopback  \n          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0\n          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host\n          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:65536  Metric:1\n          RX packets:178 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:178 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 \n          RX bytes:14420 (14.4 KB)  TX bytes:14420 (14.4 KB)\n\nWhere XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX is the cloned MAC address given to us by IT - so all OK i assume.\nAt this stage I can surely connect remotely to my machine (from computer in same room, desktop ethernet) but sometimes it works and then it breaks: usual problem, I can not access any internet (wget or firefox) without being asked to be authenticated. At this stage I re-install ubuntu 12.04 and manage to have it working for a while again until after installing a few packages using apt-get.\nSo I upgrated to Ubuntu 13.04\nat installation time from boot-cd, there was the above problem with accessing the repositories (for checking latest versions). Again it used NetworkManager which can simply not function with 'cloned MAC address' unless I am doing something wrong. At some stage after booting up with the installation cd, before installing, I switched to the console. Stopped the network manager (/etc/init.d/networking stop) and then did the old ifup thing and it worked! BUT unfortunately the whole installation crashed - something I noticed when in gnome and doing a /etc/init.d/networking restart - the window manager disappears.\nIn any event I proceeded with the installation of 13.04 but the installed system had the same problem (i.e. NetowrkManager 'cloned MAC address' could not connect me to the network). So again I removed the NetworkManager in the installed system and did all the steps above and it worked!\nThen after installing a few packages (latest were: ubuntu-tweak, gconf-editor, okular, xpdf) using apt-get (only) the problem re-appeared - I am not authenticated BUT ifconfig has the same correct output, /etc/network/interfaces has the same contents and it all happened in mid-session no logout nor reboot. I did several ifdown/ifup/ifconfig they all show the same correct output but can't be authenticated to get to the internet BUT strangely I can ssh into the desktop from other computers in the same network/room. Oh and I did check and NetworkManager was not reinstalled without me knowing (i think).\nApart from the issue of NetworkManager can't handle the 'cloned MAC address' or me doing something wrong with it. The biggest problem is that after removing NetworkManager and had it working with ifup scripts, something (maybe apt-get post install script? maybe ubuntu-tweak which I use for only configuring gnome desktop) broke the thing.\nThe questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*What can I do to be 100% certain that nothing interferes with my connections apart from the traditional, old style method of ifup when using Ubuntu 13.04. E.g. will apt-get at some stage when installing something cause something to break with my network?\n\n*Can anyone suggest why NetworkManager with cloned Mac address do not work but ifup works as said above (after removing NetworkManager).\n\n*Can anyone suggest why when NetworkManager is either installed and running or not, /etc/init.d/networking restart kills the window manager, leaves xterms on but can't write anything in them (maybe focus is elsewhere)?\n\n*I am that much to switch to Suse if it wasn't for the super-duper easy-peasy hero of softwares, love of my life: apt-get - any suggestions?\nThanks friends,\nI appreciate any help, hints or words of comfort.\n\nA: I'm on Ubuntu 12.04.2 kernel 3.5 with the same issue as you. NetworkManager is unable to make the cloned mac address \"stick\" to the ethernet port (I haven't tried it with wlan). I am able to run:\nifconfig eth0 down\nifconfig eth0 hw ether XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX\nifconfig eth0 up\n\nwithout uninstalling NetworkManager. Once I run these commands, the ethernet adapter will stick with the new, spoofed mac address, but once I disconnect ethernet, sleep the computer, or reboot, NetworkManager reverts it back to the original one.\nSo basically, my workaround is to run these commands before connecting to the network, and it's good enough for me. It would be REALLY nice if NetworkManager behaved as it was supposed to though.\nI've filed a bug report here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/network-manager/+bug/1116421\n\nA: The problem has disappeared, I can now access internet as usual without authentication.\nWhat I think helped was:\n\n*\n\n*dhclient -r to release the dhcp lease\n\n\n*remove all the dhcp lease files from /var/lib/dhcp/\n\n\n*edit /etc/network/interfaces to change the hwaddress line to something random, restart network and repeat several times, then finally restore the cloned mac address and restart network. this was done several times which leads me to think that there is something wrong with a cache somewhere in the network or dhcp server.\n\n\n*I believe it is not related to Ubuntu messing with my settings.\n\n\n*Any comments about this policy of giving us some lame cloned MAC address (meaning very simple number) in order to access the network? Couldn't they just register the network card real MAC and authenticate with that?\nand a very off-topic\n\n\n*I propose an installation which asks you what percentage of  resources you want to dedicate to window manager and apps and then installs the requested amount of 'funkiness' and 'pimp-me-up-ness', it's a pity to try to use this computer for scientific computing and have lots of ram dedicated to window positioning or funky animations, and then try to disable this and that and eventually break everything. Finally, it would also be useful to be able to boot with no x-server (runlevel 3) to test many things which gnome otherwise might take over. I could not manage to do that yet.\n\nA: On Kubuntu 15.04 cloned mac address still does not work with Network-Manager gui. It does however work with the command line but NONE of the advice listed above worked for me since it's outdated.\nI'll show two ways to do this I discovered from various sources and trial and error.\nMETHOD I\nIn this example I will use 'wlan0' as the wireless interface I want to change the mac address for and the sample mac will be 'AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF' which you just need to change to suit your needs.\nOpen up a terminal and then enter the following lines one at a time:\nsudo service network-manager stop\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 down\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 hw ether AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF up\nsudo service network-manager start\n\nYou should be up with the new MAC address.\nMETHOD II\nIf you want this to be automated you can use this script and set it to autorun at startup. \nFirst install macchanger. \nsudo apt-get install macchanger\n\nRun this in a terminal to see the options for macchanger:\nmacchanger -h\n\nNow that macchanger is installed lets build the script.\nCreate a new text file.\nPut the following code in the text file:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nRED=$(tput setaf 1 && tput bold)\nGREEN=$(tput setaf 2 && tput bold)\nSTAND=$(tput sgr0)\necho $RED -------------------\necho $RED ENTER ROOT PASSWORD\necho $RED -------------------\nsudo service network-manager stop\necho\necho $RED ------------------\necho $RED SHUTTING DOWN WIFI\necho $RED ------------------\necho $GREEN\nsleep 1\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 down\nsleep 1\necho $RED --------------------\necho $RED CHANGING MAC ADDRESS\necho $RED --------------------\necho $GREEN\nsudo macchanger -e wlan0\nsleep 1\necho\necho $RED -------------------------\necho $RED WIFI RESTARTING\necho $RED PLEASE VERIFY THE CHANGES\necho $RED -------------------------\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 up\nsleep 1\nsudo service network-manager start\necho $GREEN\nifconfig wlan0\necho $STAND\nsleep 6\nexit\n\nSave the file as mymacchanger.sh\nRight click the file in your file manager and give it execute permission.\nAdd this file to your autostart programs or create a launcher and make sure to set the launcher to use a terminal window.\nIf you are on Kubuntu you can add the following line after #!/bin/bash in the above script to have a terminal launched automatically without needing to create a desktop launcher:\ntty -s; if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then konsole -e \"$0\"; exit; fi \n\nYou can substitute the 'konsole -e' in the line to whatever terminal package you use if you don't have konsole or are on a different ubuntu distribution.\nPeace out.\n\nA: I had connection issue before when using cloned mac address. I resolved the issue by changing only the last 3 octets. For instance, only change the 'DD:EE:FF' of 'AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF'.\nThe first 3 octets are manufacturer identifier and the rest are randomly generated. Somehow it's not possible for me to change the manufacturer identifier.\n", "Q: change gui boot screen to text I'm trying to change the graphical boot screen, the one with the logo and 5 dots turning on and off to a text-only boot screen, preferably, high res( I guess it's called the boot sequence). I tried uncommenting #GRUB_TERMINAL=console in /etc/default/grub but it didn't work. I even added set linux_gfx_mode=text to /boot/grub/grub.cfg but that didn't work either. How can I accomplish that?\n\nA: On the Ubuntu's plymouth wiki page, you need to remove splash from the kernel command line in grub.   \nToggling to Traditional Text-based Boot\nIf you want to see the text-based boot messages (which use the Plymouth \"details\" plugin, press the ESCAPE key at any point when Plymouth is running. Note that the ESCAPE key acts as a toggle, so you can keep switching between graphical and text mode as required.\nTo have the boot start in \"text mode\" as early as possible, remove \"splash\" from the kernel command-line in grub.\nTo make the change permanent, update /etc/default/grub and run \"sudo update-grub\".\nUpdating the grub configuration manually is a potentially dangerous operation and can result in a machine that fails to boot without intervention.

We are affiliated with The Arc of Florida (www.arcflorida.org) and The Arc of the United States (www.thearc.org).  If I could prove that the use of this free software was helping our clients to learn, then I would show that this could be made available to the other 700 Arc's in the United States.\nThe grant proposal I am writing is due July 5th, so I do not have a great deal of time unfortunately. With this grant, I intend to prove that computer learning centers are necessary for Arc's and for adults with I/DD.  \nI have some technical questions and I would also like to find out if anyone at Ubuntu would write us a letter supporting our effort to add edubuntu into our proposed computer learning center.  So I am hoping I can speak live with someone if possible. \nI can be reached at:\n[Personal information deleted as per policy]\nThank you!\n\nA: Judi!  Most on here would applaud your efforts to expand the knowledge of alternative operating systems.  \nUnfortunately, this is primarily a user-based 'support' forum, and it would probably be more fruitful for you to contact Canonical, the company behind designing Ubuntu, or, alternatively, the Edubuntu team (within Canonical) directly instead.  It may be beneficial to work with both, to some degree.\nHere is the respective organization's contact pages, which may be of more direct help getting straight to the vendor instead:\nhttp://www.canonical.com/about-canonical/contact\n\nA: Please ask at Canonical\n They give \"professional\" support.\n", "Q: Is it safe to delete documentation files? I have to maintain 2gb on the root installation of ubuntu. The home is in another partition. I am thinking to delete the /usr/share/doc to free some space, but is it safe?\n\nA: Short answer, No with a 'but'; it's always best to allow the built-in packaging system (APT) to manage files that it has installed. If you just delete these files, they'll probably reappear the next time you upgrade any of the affected packages, unexpectedly evaporating your space savings. Instead, use Software Center (or apt-get or aptitude) to remove the packages themselves. Usually they have the same name as the folder you see in /usr/share/doc, but if there's a folder that you can't figure out, try dpkg -S /path/to/file.\nFor example, after reading your question, I ran ncdu /usr/share/doc and found it was 1.7G, and most of the heavy hitters were related to texlive, which I only installed to check something for another AskUbuntu question. I ran aptitude, searched for packages matching ^texlive.*doc$, and purged them, and now it's down under 930M.\n\nA: My /doc/ directory is very small, less than 50 MB, and I imagine yours isn't quite that large (in comparison) either.\nInstead, see this post on how to free up disk space in many different ways.  Lots of good suggestions there, but please keep in mind that some of those offer no way to 'back out' if something goes wrong.\n", "Q: Old i/0 scheduler in ubuntu 12.4.2 i am using ubuntu 12.04.2 and 12.04.1 \non ubuntu 12.04.1 its  \nio scheduler cfq registered (default)\n\nand on ubuntu 12.04.2 its \nio scheduler deadline registered (default)\n\nWhy is ubuntu's latest LTS downgraded to deadline \n\nA: As mentioned in the comment, you're running two different kernel flavours on the machines:\n3.2.0-33-generic for 12.04.1 and  3.2.0-45-virtual for 12.04.2 \ngeneric is for general purpose hardware and the virtual is optimised for virtual machines. Specifically on the disk I/O part, I can imagine that a scheduler is of much less relevance as it won't be accessing raw disks, but virtual disks instead. The host operating system will have to reschedule it anyway when it writes to the physical disk.\nBottom line: you can't compare those two kernels.\n", "Q: how to partition in ubuntu after installing? I have installed ubuntu in my system without partitioning, is there any possibility to partition my disk without reinstalling the ubuntu, i mean in existence ubuntu can i do partitions? \nI used whole disk for Ubuntu installation.\n\nA: If you have installed Ubuntu as the only OS on your hard drive you can not partition the hard drive while Ubuntu is running because you have to unmount the drive before being able to partition it.. and you can't unmount the drive while the system is running on it.\nYou would have to boot from your Ubuntu installation medium and choose the 'Try Ubuntu' option. When the system is booted open the dash and type 'gparted' then choose your HDD and partition it\n", "Q: How to burn an Ubuntu ISO image on a DVD on Ubuntu?

On top of that I have a proccess running after boot called evolution-source-registry.\nHow can I get rid of all the evolution stuff without destroying ubuntu-desktop?\nThanks for your help.\n\nA: While some parts of evolution will be installed, and in use (they are required by other parts of the system, including the clock indicator, and empathy), there are a couple of minor things, which should get removed if you run sudo apt-get autoremove --purge. This will remove any libraries or such which were automatically installed, but are no longer needed. In this case. I think libcamel-1.2-40 will be removed, as it isn't really needed by the calendar or address book integration, possibly with some other packages external to evolution (such as older kernel versions).\n\nA: Hm, actually all these packages are installed by the indicator-datetime package.\n  evolution-data-server evolution-data-server-common indicator-datetime\n  libcamel-1.2-40 libebackend-1.2-5 libebook-1.2-14 libecal-1.2-15\n  libedata-book-1.2-15 libedata-cal-1.2-18 libedataserver-1.2-17\n\nThat seems a bit excessive to show the current time.

The hard drive (1.5TB WD Caviar Green) isn't detected by any computer regardless of the OS installed.\nSo I disassembled the hard drive from the external case and plugged into my PC (I had to remove my normal hard drive in order to do so). I then tried to install Puppy Linux, which didn't work, because of some problems partitioning the drive (something like Error writing to /dev/sdb: Input/output error or similar).\nThat's why I decided to give the Gparted live disk a try, which didn't detect the hard drive at all.\nLater on I burned an Ubuntu 13.04 64-bit installation DVD and tried to install it, creating only Read/Write errors similar to those I got when trying to install Puppy Linux.\nThen I decided to just launch Ubuntu as a live CD and ran Gparted again, which surprisingly detected the hard drive, but failed to partition it, because of a missing partition table. Unfortunately neither Gparted nor the Disk Utility were able to create it.\nDo I have a chance to create this partition table and partition the drive, or is it just broken?\n\nA: Try using Disk Utility to check the drive's SMART information.

Would I be able to copy files from a Windows PC and pasting it in my Ubuntu PC? \nThanks :)\n\nA: See If I chose \"Replace Windows with Ubuntu\", do I lose the other partition too? for a similar question. \nHere is a step by step direction for you\nStep one: Make two backup copies of all the files and folders from all the partitions in your computer. Since you will not be restoring them in a Windows system, do not use any Windows backup program to make backup. Use Copy to copy the folders. Make two copies preferably in two external USB hard drives.\nStep two: Download and prepare the Ubuntu Live DVD/USB and boot from it. Use the Try Ubuntu without installing option. Once Ubuntu loads make sure all the different parts of the computer works. Then plug in the USB drive where you made the backup and make sure you can read and open some of the files. If this step fails go back to step one.\nStep three: click on \"Install Ubuntu\" only when you are satisfied with steps one and two. Use the \"Replace Windows 7 with Ubuntu\" option during Ubuntu installation. \nWarning: This option will delete all the partitions in your hard drive and you will lose all the data.\nOnce Ubuntu is installed. You will be able to copy back the all the files and folders from the external hard drive into their respective folders within Ubuntu's /home/[user]/ folder.\nAnswer to your second question: Ubuntu can read most USB drives. However, you can test this while you are trying Ubuntu without installing.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: How to reset Ubuntu 13.04 system to default?

That should help determining which line of which file that invalid command resides.\nOn a side note, ♦ is the symbol the default font for the virtual console uses to print characters it does not have a symbol for.\n\nA: Workaround\nFirst, I think that you refer about when you go in tty1 - Ctrl + Alt + F1.\nNow, I think is happening what you said most likely because you have a strange character like ♦ (diamond suit character or the special badge for an askubuntu moderator) in ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile file or other file that contain various initialization commands.\nAs you can see in next image, I edited ~/.bashrc file puting inside ♦ character on a single line. As result, when I open the terminal it get the problem described by you:\n\nIt is happening the same when I go in tty1 with Ctrl + Alt + F1.\nFiles that contain initialization commands when a shell is invoked: /etc/profile, /etc/bashrc, ~/.bash_login,  ~/.profile, ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_aliases and maybe others. See Shell initialization files.\nTo quickly check if one of these files have something wrong inside you can use source command. For example:\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\n\nFinal solution\nAfter inspecting /etc/profile from http://paste.ubuntu.com/5781361/, I found that on the line 31 there is \"Right-To-Left Override\" - &#8238; unicode character. Just open /etc/profile file with sudo -H gedit /etc/profile, make sure to delete this strange character and the problem will disappear.\n\nAs amusement, in HTML for example, if you insert this unicode character using decimal code (&#8238;) in front of a line, look what is happening:\n\n‮This text is in arabic-english!\n\nAnother more generalized solution\nWe will find the exact command that causing the error using a \"trap\".\nFirst,  we have to make a new script file in ~/bin directory, let's call it lib.trap.sh (gedit ~/bin/lib.trap.sh), with following inside:\nlib_name='trap'\n\nlib_version=20130620\n#changed from lib_version=20121026 found it at https://stackoverflow.com/a/13099228/2353900 to work well at initialization of the shell\n\nstderr_log=\"/dev/shm/stderr.log\"\n\n#\n# TO BE SOURCED ONLY ONCE:\n#\n###~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~##\n\nif test \"${g_libs[$lib_name]+_}\"; then\n    return 0\nelse\n    if test ${#g_libs[@]} == 0; then\n        declare -A g_libs\n    fi\n    g_libs[$lib_name]=$lib_version\nfi\n\n\n#\n# MAIN CODE:\n#\n###~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~##\n\nset -o pipefail  # trace ERR through pipes\nset -o errtrace  # trace ERR through 'time command' and other functions\nset -o nounset   ## set -u : exit the script if you try to use an uninitialised variable\nset -o errexit   ## set -e : exit the script if any statement returns a non-true return value\n\nexec 2>\"$stderr_log\"\n\n\n###~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~##\n#\n# FUNCTION: EXIT_HANDLER\n#\n###~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~##\n\nfunction exit_handler ()\n{\n    local error_code=\"$?\"\n\n    test $error_code == 0 && return;\n\n    #\n    # LOCAL VARIABLES:\n    # ------------------------------------------------------------------\n    #    \n    local i=0\n    local regex=''\n    local mem=''\n\n    local error_file=''\n    local error_lineno=''\n    local error_message='unknown'\n\n    local lineno=''\n\n\n    #\n    # PRINT THE HEADER:\n    # ------------------------------------------------------------------\n    #\n    # Color the output if it's an interactive terminal\n    test -t 1 && tput bold; tput setf 4                                 ## red bold\n    echo -e \"\\n(!)

The hex code for ♦ is 2666, according to Unicode Character 'BLACK DIAMOND SUIT' . Note: There is at least one other hex code, 25C6, which produces the same or similar looking symbol. See the search results for \"diamond\". Unicode Character Search\nPerhaps something like \\u2666 is in one of the scripts. From Bash Reference Manual for echo - \"\\uhhhh the Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) character whose value is the hexadecimal value HHHH (one to four hex digits)\"\nIt depends on the character encoding used, so you may want to search the most likely ones first. echo $LC_CTYPE should return the character encoding used by your shell.

Does anyone have an idea?\n\nA: It is possible to do. You begin by continuing. your Ubuntu installation on your computer as normal, until you reach this screen:\n\nThen tik Something else and continue.\nNow in this screen, you will see that the installer lists both your Hard Drive and your USB. Your USB's name should be dev/sda2. Alternatively, your can see that it will show in the free space bar the drive with the matching amount of space.\n\nSelect your drive from the list of devices and again from the list that says Device for boot loader installation and click Install now\nYou will now be installing Ubuntu on a USB. One thing to note, I will take at least three times as long as it is to install on a USB drive, than on a Hard Drive.\nOf course, this will depend on if you are using USB 2.0 vs. USB 3.0, as well as the brand, as some Drives are faster than others. Be Patient.\nAnother thing, running Ubuntu from a USB will be again, at least three times slower than usual, so I would avoid resource-hungry processes. \nWith that said, have fun.\n", "Q: Is there a way to create a virtual machine that runs android OS? I have been using the oracle VM, but I'll need to use a tablet soon at work. Therefore, I need to start experimenting with the android OS now.

Applications recognize it too. However the info shown on the printer panel (\"System settings\" --> \"Printer\") does not seem what Ubuntu obtains from the printer; it's IP address is localhost, clicking \"Jobs\"-->\"Show\" always shows empty job list, and clicking \"Print Test Page\" doesn't do anything.\nProbably because of that, I get an error when I try to print a pdf from Acrobat Reader.\nlpr: unsupported document-format application/vnd.adobe-reader-postscript\n\nUbuntu Quantal, acroread v9.5.5, Canon MG6330\nWith the same file, I can print without any problem from Mac OSX 10.8.4.

With @quidage's answer, I was able to \"operate\" printer; Print Test Page sends \"something\" to the printer so that it beeps but without printing anything, and the admin web page on Ubuntu says the job is completed. Then I'm ashamed to say that I had to install driver...from this web site to select the printer I have.\n\nA: you could try to configure the printer new using cups, type\nhttp://localhost:631/\ninto any browser, remove the printer from printers list and add it again in the webinterface by entering the ip. There you can choose the driver for the printer by yourself. If it is a network print, the address cannot be localhost, this is your computer.\nGive feedback if you have any questions\n", "Q: Win 8 not recognized while installing 12.04.2 When installing 12.04.2 on my new windows 8 computer with efi, it doesn't detect that there is an operating system already on the hard drive.

If I go to Settings Manager > Preferred Applications and make Chrome (or chromium-browser; there are entries for both!) the default browser, then logout or reboot and come back, the default browser is null again. The same happens if I click a URL in another application (eg Thunderbird); it says I have no default browser set. If I set it to Chrome, it works for the session, but reverts to unset afterwards. Is there some other place it must be set?\n\nA: The underlying problem is reported here:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/chromium-browser/+bug/902661\nChrome and Chromium do not play nicely in the xfce4 environment, and will corrupt the xfce4 settings for web browser in Preferred Applications. Simply tell Chrom{e,ium} not to ask you any more, then set the default settings through Settings Manager > Preferred Applications.\n\nA: A way to set the default browser system-wide, inherited from Debian, is to set a default browser as the system \"alternative\". \"alternatives\" is a convention introduced in Debian GNU/Linux to handle concurrent applications for the same task, i.e. Firefox and Links for web brosing.\nSet the alternative on the terminal by running:\nsudo update-alternatives --set x-www-browser /usr/bin/chromium\nand I believe recently they also came up with the gnome-browser, so run:\nsudo update-alternatives --set gnome-www-browser /usr/bin/chromium\nThis modifies the symlink infrastructure, which you find in /etc/alternatives. Your desktop environment should make use of these settings (that doesn't mean it does).\nYour experience (with the setting beeing temporary) suggests, that your desktop environment uses an environment variable, to make the setting known. Run \"env |sort\" in a terminal once before making the setting in your settings-manager and once after, and compare the outputs.\nI suspect (without knowing) that the settings-manager introduces some variable, maybe something like XDG_BROWSER=/usr/bin/chromium. You should be able to see the details.\nCreate the file .xinitrc in your home directory, make it executable and modify its content to read:\nexport XDG_BROWSER=/usr/bin/chromium\n(or whatever the environment variable was)\nBut try the update-alternatives aproach first, maybe this is enough.\n\nA: I think I have an answer to an old question that still persists in xubuntu 14.0.4. Put this in the preferred applications (found in \"all settings\".\n/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable %U\nThe way I found this was right clicking the icon for applications and chose edit applications.

Without any questioning.\nFirst problem is, that a dialog pops up which I have to click.

Instead the desktop user is just logged out.\nPerhaps it is possible to bind the command shutdown -h now to the power button event shomehow?\n\nA: Ubuntu has a menu entry which allows you to bind keyboard events to commands. I would assume that the action triggered by the power button would also be accessible from this menu.\nMake a script called 'shutdown.sh' (or something) and put it in your home directory.\nIt's contents should simply be 'shutdown -h now'.\nRun 'sudo chmod +x shutdown.sh' to make it executable.\nIn a terminal, run 'sudo nano /etc/sudoers', this is will open a text file for editing. Open it with a GUI text editor by replacing 'nano' with 'leafpad', 'gedit', etc. - whatever you have installed. \nAdd these lines to the end of the text file: \nCmnd_Alias SHUTDOWN_CMDS = /sbin/shutdown, /sbin/halt, /sbin/reboot\n<your username> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: SHUTDOWN_CMDS\n\nObviously, replace '' with your actual username.\nSave the changes you made (using Ctrl+o if you're using nano)\nFinally, configure the power button to launch your script using the Ubuntu keyboard menu.\nLike I said, I don;t use Unity so I am not sure of the exact procedure necessary to configure the power button to launch script, nor am I aware of the name of the key you will have to enter into the keyboard menu.\nMore information about editing the sudoers file can be found here: Ubuntu Sudoers\n", "Q: Cannot start Eclipse from Unity Launcher I downloaded Eclipse Juno package, and extracted it to /opt directory.

CacheFS as the backend on a virtual machine which is using Ubuntu 12.04 32-bit After following this tutorial to use cachefilesd,\nHow can I cache NFS shares on a local disk?\nI setup the system for nfs sharing.

You might also double-check permissions on the .ssh directory and files.  \nI haven't had to modify sshd_config for this kind of access, myself.   I am wondering if your modification broke things, especially the AuthorizedKeysFile line.\nTypically, you would want to put the authorized_keys under $USER/.ssh .  \nHere are the permission from a user on one of my servers:\n:~/.ssh$ ls -ld .\ndrwx------ 2 rrd rrd 4096 May 28 17:57 .\n\n:~/.ssh$ ll\ntotal 280\n-rw-r----- 1 rrd rrd   4351 May 22 16:20 authorized_keys\n-rw------- 1 rrd rrd   1679 Apr 27  2012 id_rsa\n-rw-r--r-- 1 rrd rrd    399 Apr 27  2012 id_rsa.pub\n-rw-r--r-- 1 rrd rrd 266138 Jun 13 00:18 known_hosts\n\nMake sure the individual files are at least this restricted.\nAs guntbert points out, also check that the directory and files are owned by you.  The permissions won't make sense (or work) otherwise.\nWho owns the keys in authorized_keys on B? (The bit that says user@host after the key.) Is it root@A ?\nThat is, in looking at ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, what is the equivalent of bert@etherbert for your set-up: \nssh-rsa AAAA...ffsII8dSaDF33 bert@etherbet\n\nI would just edit the remote .ssh/authorized keys manually for testing, putting in the id_rsa.pub contents of the user you are intiating the connection with.\nMake sure you are coming from the user that has the key in the remote authorized_keys file.  \n\nA: The directory ~/.ssh MUST be owned by the user, not root. So change that and it will work.\nTo avoid having to type the passphrase for your private key every time you use ssh-agent. ssh-add .ssh/id_rsa will add the key to the agent, from then on the agent will provide the key to ssh.\n\nA: Besides all the other guys had provided the solutions, my additional suggestion is you should first check the logging file: /var/log/secure, which is where sshd puts logs in. If something goes wrong, checking what sshd has complained in /var/log/secure will quickly narrow down the possible issues. \n\nA: This is an old question and already answered, but if the user has the home directory encrypted (using ecryptfs or some such), ssh daemon will not be able to see the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file. If that is the case follow the solution listed here. \nThis solution recommends changing sshd configuration (/etc/ssh/sshd_config) and changing AuthorizedKeysFile to /etc/ssh/%u/authorized_keys and copying your authorized_keys file to /etc/ssh/username/authorized_keys file (along with proper ownership for /etc/ssh/username and proper permissions as required by sshd).\n\nA: Nothing worked for me. I don't know why ? I tried each solution.\nFirst\n\nssh-copy-id : did not copy id_rsa & id_rsa.pub\n\nSecond\n\nssh-agent $SHELL\nssh-add -L\nssh-add\nssh-copy-id -i remote-host\n\nBoth did not work. I guess I am unlucky. Someone was saying to change the permission of .ssh folder from root. I thought that'd be not a better option. What I was doing when my above case failed. I created a new key on server and save this key on github / gitlab. That's also not a cool way. Here I tried an alternate, I hope it may help someone.\nFirst I create a folder on remote server with that user permission who can write into it. Then I follow below steps on my local machine\n\ncd ~/.ssh\nscp -r *\n  remote_user@192.168.100.**:path_to_writable_folder_on_remote_server\n\nAnd then I logged in on remote server and then\n\ncd path_to_that_folder_where_I_copied_keys\n\n& Then\n\nmv * ~/.ssh\n\n(whew) Finally, it worked.\n", "Q: Switching language with keyboard shortcut in GNOME is ineffective I have Ubuntu 13.04 32-bit with GNOME 3.8.2, and Unity installed too.\nTwo languages are selected as input sources - English(US) and Russian.\nKeyboard shortcut to change input methods is set.\nIndicator in top notification panel works well.\nThe problem is that changing input method by keybinding does not work properly - it changes only the indicator in the top panel and does not affect typing from keyboard. It doesn't matter which language is selected through keyboard shortcut, typing from keyboard brings symbols only from English input method.\nBut, if I change language from panel (from EN to RU, by example), everything works okay and I can type Russian symbols. Then I again change language, now by keybind (to EN), it works too, but only once, next usage of keybind does not affect input method, leaving only English input.\nIn Unity everything works, without any problems.\n\nA: One possible cause could be an existing bug in Ubuntu, that's been around for a couple of years already: If you press the keyboard shortcut to change a keyboard layout, it will actually change the layout, but not the indication in the panel. For example, you were using Russian in one window, and are now using English in another window. Then you change focus back to the first window. In that case, the keyboard input will automatically switch back to Russian, but the panel indicator will keep showing EN. Further more, if you use the keyboard shortcut to change the input, it will switch back to English, but the indicator will switch to RU.\n\nA: I had the same issue with the keyboard shortcut not working, but changing the language in the notification panel would not work either.\nGoing to Settings -> Region & Language and clicking the Options button next to Input Settings, I was able to select Allow different sources for each window and it fixed my problem.  I could even switch back to Use the same source for all windows and it continued to work.\nEdit: Tested on Ubuntu 18.10 and GNOME 3.30.1\n", "Q: How do I change the font color in ubuntu software center I can't seem to find a reasonable answer to this question.  I looked at Ubuntu Tweak and it's only for older versions of Ubuntu.  I have 12.4 LTS.\n\nA: Ubuntu is based on Gnome and AFAIK, Gnome has got some tools to do such a thing (don't use those tools for a while, since 9.04 Jaunty Jackalope or something like that). They might be in Gnome customization menus. So install Gnome 3 (Gnome Shell and/or Gnome Classic) and have a look at their customization menus.

This way, I would be able to limit the upload rate in the \"day.conf\" file and remove any limits in the \"night.conf\" file. I want to use cron to then start btsync with the right config file.\nI currently have in /etc/init/btsync.conf\nsetuid patrick\nsetgid patrick\n\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [016]\n\nexpect fork\n\ninstance $CONF\n\nchdir /home/patrick/programs/btsync\n\nexec ./btsync --config $CONF\n\nI can then start btsync with something like:\nsudo initctl start btsync CONF=btsync-day.conf\n\nwhich I could put into /etc/crontab and it would work. But I think that using the instance stanza is not the right thing to do, as I am not running instances really. Btsync can not be running multiple instances. Also to stop the job, I have to stop it using the right CONF= variable, but I would rather be able to just stop it without needing to specify the right instance.\nIs there a better way to do this in upstart?\n\nA: I think the best way to do it is to have a script that will manage the btsync application.\nThe script will monitor the time and restart the btsync application accordingly.\nThe script should look like (not tested):\n#!/bin/bash\nSUNRISE=\"06:00\"\nSUNSET=\"19:00\"\n\nRUNDIR=`basename \"$0\"`\nPIDFILE=\"${RUNDIR}/.sync/sync.pid\"\nCONFWFILE=\"${RUNDIR}/.btsync_safe.confw\"\nCONFDAY=\"${RUNDIR}/btday.conf\"\nCONFNIGHT=\"${RUNDIR}/btnight.conf\"\n\nfunction start_bt\n{\n   start-stop-daemon --chdir \"$RUNDIR\" --pidfile \"$PIDFILE\" --start --exec ./btsync -- -c $1\n   echo \"$1\" > \"$CONFWFILE\"\n}\n\nfunction stop_bt\n{\n   start-stop-daemon --pidfile \"$PIDFILE\" --stop\n}\n\nfunction which_conf\n{\n   curtime=`date +%H:%M`\n   [ $curtime > \"$SUNRISE\"  && $curtime < \"$SUNSET\" ] && echo \"$CONFDAY\" || echo \"$CONFNIGHT\"\n}\n\ntrap \"stop_bt\" EXIT\n\nchdir $RUNDIR\nfor ((;;))\ndo\n   sleep 60\n   [ `cat \"$CONFWFILE\"` == `which_conf` ]  || stop_bt\n   kill -0 `$PIDFILE` || start_bt `which_conf`\ndone\n\n", "Q: Admin name appears twice if it asks for admin password.

How do I boot from ubuntu on my USB drive so I can wipe the ubuntu file system on the hard drive? I have ubuntu on an exterior hard drive and want to boot from that so I can wipe the internal hard drive on a Dell system before I give it away.\nthanks!\n\nA: You can boot from your USB stick and do dd on it, but be carefull not to wipe other drives.\nUsually the command I do is simple:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdx bs=16M\nNOTE: sdX should be the drive you're wiping. I only have an internal HD so the name is \"sda\", but for external drives could be sdb, sdc etc.\nFor my 1TB drive it takes about 3 and a half hours to wipe it with zeros.\n\nA: It would probably be easiest to burn the Ubuntu image on the external drive to a disc and boot as a Live CD. Otherwise, if booting from the external hard drive is a requirement, follow many of the tutorials online concerning USB booting Linux.\n\nA: If I understood clearly, you have an external HDD with an Ubuntu installed on it. You want to boot your system from that external hard drive, and use Ubuntu to wipe the internal HDD.\n\n\n*\n\n*Start your system, and go to the BIOS and change the boot priority in the following order:\n-USB\n-HDD\n-etc.\nIt won't be exactly like this but make sure the first boot device is USB so that your system boots from your external HDD. Then save and restart.\n\n*When you are in Ubuntu, use Gparted to delete the data you have on your internal hard drive. You would probably have to unmount the partitions from your internal HDD before making any changes. Be careful about the data and the partitions you are trying to change. Make sure you have chosen the right partitions.\n\nA: To wipe the drive clean, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdx bs=4k conv=notrunc\n\nIf you would like to make multiple passes on your hard disk I would recommend using the shred command.\nsudo shred -n2 -v /dev/sdx\n\nNote: Replace x with your device ID.\n", "Q: How do I assign magnet links to use qbittorrent?

Recently I have migrated from ubuntu 13.04 64 bits to 32 bits in my laptop because I was getting some trouble with some software. Meanwhile, I have faced another problems with compatibility, with guitar pro 6 that I can't open after installing ( and I can made it work on ubuntu 12.04 in a virtual machine).\nShould I downgrade to ubuntu 12.04? Are there more programs available for ubuntu 12.04 than for 13.04? \n\nA: 12.04 is a long term release, supported for five years. In theory, this is the version that developers should be targeting if they want their software to just-work™.\nSticking with the LTS sounds like a sensible idea in your case. I would suggest testing a LiveCD before you next upgrade (and perhaps wait for the next LTS - 14.04).\n", "Q: Logitech C310 webcam not working well with Guvcview and Cheese I just bought a new webcam, Logitech C310.\nIt doesn't work well with either Guvcview or Cheese with their default settings, under Ubuntu 12.04.\nThe recorded video and audio are not synchronized in both Guvcview and Cheese. The sound lags behind the video. Is the problem due to the webcam or Guvcview and Cheese?\nI haven't been able to test the webcam with skype yet. Not sure if the same synchronized problem will occur.\nWhat webcams do you recommend to work with Ubuntu 12.04? I prefer one that can work well for online job interview.\nThanks!\n\nA: Making Logitech webcams to work in Ubuntu may be a nightmare but you may succeed with some efforts, of which I suggest you to take a look at the list of possibilities mentioned in this previous answer. The Swift Tools Flashcam Project can be useful for you but it is tricky and not fully reliable. It is yet worth a try.\nMy suggestion for a good webcam will be a Microsoft VX-800 which will work right out of the box with no problem and excellent quality. \n\nSamples of this webcam in action for a production workflow can be seen here and in the latest videos of the official DiarioDebateTV Channel in Youtube, of which I suggest you to see them in 480p quality. This model is what we use for a live broadcast.\nI hope you can find this model, it is cheap and will require no additional drivers, patches or programs to work out of the box.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: OpenVPN connect but nothing else I have installed a VPN server on my Synology DS413+.

I press the power button on my laptop, press restart, but my computer only shuts off and doesn't really restart.  Is there a way to fix this?\n\nA: Without knowing the model of your laptop or its specifications, the only preliminary thing I can suggest, which has worked for me before, is to try a kernel boot parameter such as reboot=bios, however this will only work on X86 32 bit systems.\nThis approach is also mentioned on the Ubuntu wiki for Grub 2, and can often work, and please see the note there about an alternative boot parameter, especially for some Dell systems, called reboot=pci.\nNow edit /etc/default/grub (if you don't use vim, replace it with another editor):  \nsudo vim /etc/default/grub\n\nMake sure that you add your kernel boot parameter so that you have a line identical to this:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash reboot=bios\"\n\nNow you must run\nsudo update-grub\n\nfor the changes to be incorporated in /boot/grub/grub.cfg.\nMore details on such kernel boot parameters are explained in man bootparam or the Ubuntu manpages online. However the most detailed documentation is in the linux-doc package, and when that is installed you will have /usr/share/doc/linux-doc/kernel-parameters.txt.gz. However, for a description of the other options such as reboot=acpi you need to install the kernel source and look at the file that kernel-parameters.txt.gz directs you to. Alternatively, a quick summary of other options are listed in this article.\nAs an extra note, the kernel log often contains recommendations such as If system does not work as expected, please boot with acpi=copy_dsdt. To find any such errors, grep the kernel log with \ngrep -Ei 'ACPI Error|ACPI BIOS Bug' /var/log/kern.log\n\nIf the problem persists, it may be specific to your hardware and need to be reported as an acpi bug against the kernel.\n", "Q: How can I get VLC to automatically play DVDs when inserted? Running 13.04 I'm trying to help an elderly disabled person play DVDs as easy as possible - by inserting them!

Select VLC for DVD Video to be open automatically when a disk is inserted, like shown below:\n\n\nXBMC\nI do believe, however, that you should use XBMC, as it has a simple user interface It only requires basic input, like using Arrow Keys and the Space Bar. You can install it by:\nOpening the Ubuntu Software Center, and searching for XBMC\nor\nOpening the Terminal (Alt+Ctrl+T), and typing\nsudo apt-get install xbmc\n\nHere are some screenshots:\n\n\n\nYou can install plugins, so you can fetch content from other sources, including some live tv and videos. You can even watch Youtube videos. It is usable with touch screens. It can even run on Android. There are remote controls apps for Android and iOS to control it.\nGet it to start on Boot\nIf you want for it to auto-Launch when the computer is turned on:\nOpen the dash and search for Startup Applications\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Click Add\n\n*Name it XBMC, or whatever you wish.\n\n*For Command, enter /usr/bin/xbmc\n\n*Finally, click Add\n\nTo make it easier, also set the account that the person will be using to login automatically.\nHope this works for you.\n", "Q: virtualbox kernel package is not supported while install vagrant I'm installing the vagrant with sudo apt-get install.

It would make the most sense to use reserved instances, to ensure my costs are the lowest they can be.\nNow, I have two issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*juju 0.7 (I've not tested the Go version) doesn't like t1.micro instances and appears to lose contact with them after AWS instantiates them. There are others reporting the same thing.\n\n*If I've pre-reserved a number of instances, how do I \"hard-code\" these into juju's settings to ensure they are used in the environment, rather than \"randoms\"?\nIf I can crack the code on this, then I'm off and running!!\n\nA: t1.micros are really not very performant, especially with Juju .7 as it needs zookeeper on the node and that brings in Java and so on.  This makes it pretty much unusable on t1.micros, and is the reason you're having problems. \nThe good news is that for Juju 2.x we're working on containers so that Juju will deploy inside an LXC container on an instance. A nice bonus of this is that we'll finally have the ability to run more than one charm/service on the same instance. \nThat means that you'd reserve just one small instance for $61 that would run everything. On top of that Juju 2.x has a much lower overhead than .7. This works out to ~$5 a month, not counting bandwidth, that's not a bad deal! \nThe downside is that this feature is not ready, but the flipside is that there's an entire team working on this feature right now and it's due to land over the next month or so. \nThis is probably not a solution to your current problem, but if you could wait just a little while longer we're getting there. \nHere's some things to follow up on:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/juju-dev/2013-June/001104.html\n\n*https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/juju-dev/2013-June/001112.html\n", "Q: How to get the latest firefox on 10.04 after EOL?

Tried to use the automatic repair and everything went fine and I've restarted  the machine. \nThen I turned UEFI on again and the first surprise was: the initial screen was not Windows boot loader any more but grub; I really don't want that. \nAnd the second surprise: although I can boot Windows (I am using it right now) , I can't initiate Linux. After choosing one of Linux options in the grub screen, absolutely nothing happens.\nHere's the link generated by the boot repair application: http://paste.ubuntu.com/5763591/\nIf possible I would really appreciate some help in (1) setting windows boot loader screen as the default and (2) install and run Linux (with dual boot windows) with UEFI and FastBoot on on this machine.\nIf you have a tutorial that you think I can follow to solve these problems I would also be very pleased.\nUpdate June, 16th\nHello, I appreciate your answer. \nIn fact, first, I've installed Ubuntu with Uefi turned off and everything worked well. Then, while  using Ubuntu, I've followed the steps on the link that I've pasted on the last post in order to convert the Ubuntu installation from legacy to Uefi mode. After I did that, the system couldn't be loaded any more. When I turn on my notebook, the first screen that cames to me is the Grub2 screen. In that screen I have two options for ubuntu, and 4 for windows. I can load windows with no problems, but when I try to load Ubuntu (recovery or normal mode), the system simply does not respond. It shows me just a black screen and then I have to restart the notebook through the power button. I've tried loading ubuntu this way with and without uefi and I have the same result.The point is: I want now to uninstall linux and clean the partition that I've reserved to the installation in order to install it again and use the os with legacy mod. \nBut how can I do that without loading the os? \nThank your very much, Vitor.\n\nA: Unfortunately so far I have not seen anyone install a GNU / Linux with UEFI so you must configure your BIOS to legacy that way you can access the GRUB, I hope you're looking for\n\nA: I don't know how to get Windows' boot loader to redirect to a Linux boot loader in EFI mode. In fact, I don't believe it's possible. Thus, part of what you're asking for isn't possible, or at least, I don't know how to do it. You'll have to accept using something other than the Windows boot loader as the primary boot program. That said, you should be able to set whatever boot manager you use to run Windows as the default OS.\nSaying \"I can't initiate Linux\" is insufficiently clear; you don't say what happens when you try to launch Linux. Any error messages -- or lack of same -- are important in diagnosing the nature of the problem. Absent that information, we're all left guessing about the nature of the problem.\nPersonally, I'm not a fan of GRUB 2. Thus, between that and the lack of information on how GRUB is failing, my recommendation is to bypass it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Re-run Boot Repair, but this time, select the \"Advanced Options\" item, click \"Restore EFI Backups\" from the resulting dialog box, and click \"Apply.\" This should undo most of Boot Repair's changes, which will make it easier to make subsequent changes.\n\n*If you've not already done so, use the firmware setup utility to disable Secure Boot, which causes more problems than it's worth at the moment. (Unfortunately, how you disable Secure Boot varies from one firmware to another, so I can't describe this step in more detail.)\n\n*Boot to Windows.\n\n*Download the binary .zip file for rEFInd.\n\n*Install rEFInd from Windows, as described in its documentation.\n\n*Ensure that the EFI filesystem driver for ext4fs is installed. It should be in the drivers_x64 subdirectory of the rEFInd installation on the ESP. You can optionally delete the other drivers.\n\n*Reboot. rEFInd should appear.\n\n*Highlight one of the entries for Linux that refers to a file called vmlinuz-{version}, where {version} is a version number.\n\n*Press F2 or Insert twice. This should open a simple line editor.\n\n*Add ro root=/dev/sda8 to the kernel options in the line editor.\n\n*Press Enter. Linux should boot.\n\n*In Linux, access the files from the rEFInd .zip file.\n\n*Run the mkrlconf.sh script, as in sudo ./mkrlconf.sh, typed from the directory in which the file exists. This should create a file called /boot/refind_linux.conf. This file will obviate the need to edit the boot options (steps 9-10, above) on subsequent boots.\n\n*Optionally edit /boot/efi/EFI/refind/refind.conf and change any options you like to trim unwanted boot entries (using dont_scan_files or dont_scan_dirs), to change the default boot option (using default_selection), etc.\n\n\nIf all goes well, your system will boot into rEFInd on subsequent boots, and from there you'll be able to launch either Windows or Linux. There are, however, a number of things that can go wrong with this procedure, so you may need to do some troubleshooting at one step or another.\n", "Q: CGAL library installation! I am running Ubuntu 12.04 and I want to install the CGAL library on my Desktop for my study purpose.I have tried its installation process for 1000 times(trying all different ways) but still I am unable to make it work.\nThis is Cmake output.\nAny help is appreciated, since I am stuck on this since last two months.\nThanks in advanced.\n\nA: Try sudo apt-get install libcgal*.

However it is a bit frustrating. But when it writes: fatal error: iostream.h: No such file or directory compilation terminated it simply cannot find the usual files provided with compiler so it might suggest that there's something wrong with your paths. And still CGAL is a C++ library, and iostream.h is a C file.\nTry writing and running a simple C program using iostream.h file and let us know if it works.\nAlso be sure that you have installed all required 3rd party libs (Qt, MUMPS, LAPACk etc).\nEDIT: If you need compiled version anyway, than install the packaged version for development and in the free time try to make it compile at last.

This is used for trivial binaries used in the very early boot stage or ones that you need to have available in booting single-user mode.

You should use /usr/local/bin or /usr/local/sbin for system-wide available scripts.

the comments):\nroot@cs:~# nohup ssh-agent bash &\n[1] 1287\nroot@cs:~# nohup: ignoring input and appending output to ânohup.outâ\n<here is an empty line with the cursor>\n\nFor some reason, the output of nohup is put on the next line, and a new line is added.\n\nA: When you are logged in as root (in your verbose output above it shows that you are) and you run ssh, it will look for keys in root's .ssh directory; not the directory of the user specified in the ssh connection string.\nI am not entirely sure why you are running any of this using sudo; when you create and copy your keys you need to be logged in as the user you are intending to use for ssh.\nI am a bit confused by your description of what you did, but as a first step I suggest you make sure that you have created the key in the correct user's .ssh directory and that when you are running ssh you are running it as the correct user to pick up that key file.\nThe second part of your question is about using ssh-agent to store your key's passphrase. There is a good guide to doing this here: http://www.akadia.com/services/ssh_agent.html. Again, you need to be running ssh-agent (on the client, if that isn't clear) as the correct user. Note that ssh-agent only stores the passphrase in memory, so if it is terminated and you start a new ssh-agent process it will no longer remember your passphrase. On a server, this is not such as issue; you just need to start up the agent once and keep it running in the background. There are details in the link above explaining how to tell your script where to find the agent by storing the location of the agent socket in a temporary file that your backup script can read.\n\nA: First: The key agent are supposed to exit when you log out, by design.  Because of security issues, you don't want your login to be open if you log out by mistake.  So, you really should NOT use ssh key agent for this, it is not the way to use it.\nSecond: It is posible to have very restricted user with few rights, to store/recive backup files on /srv/backup or where ever it has access.  To log in to that user you have a ssh certificate whithout any certificate password, so you can log in without password if client has the right certificate.\nYou could then even restrict which machines are allowed to connect and what programs to runt in ~/.ssh, look that up in the manual.\n", "Q: GNOME 2 does not start in Ubuntu Linux 12.04 after login though installation is complete I have a pc with only 512 mb RAM.

However, after logging in , the desktop is the Unity interface. What do I need to do to use GNOME 2 successfully.

Is it also possible to arrange the time/squence of each commands,if yes then could you explain how?\n\nA: You can run commands before and after hibernation or suspension (note there is a difference; hibernation is to disk, suspension is to memory) by creating a script in /etc/pm/sleep.d:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n  hibernate)\n    # put commands to run on hibernation here\n    ;;\n  thaw)\n    # put commands to run when returning from hibernation here\n    ;;\n  suspend)\n    # put commands to run on suspend here\n    ;;\n  resume) \n    # put commands to run when returning from suspension\n    ;;\nesac\n\nThe filename of the script will dictate the order in which the scripts run compared to other scripts in sleep.d. Within your script, your commands will run in whatever order you put then in the script.\n", "Q: How to optimize power consumption for Ivy Bridge? I'm new in Ubuntu 13.04 and wondering what I should do to get the lowest power consumption settings for an Ivy Bridge CPU. \nAre there any changes to make in the terminal or something?\n\nA: You can use powertop, which is not specifically for Ivy Bridge, but in general will help.\n\n To install, open a terminal and enter\nsudo apt-get install powertop\nsudo powertop\nIt will give you some interactive way to look high power consumers.\n", "Q: How do you configure snes9x-gtk joypad 2? [Lubuntu 13.04] I am trying to play snes9x-gtk with two players using PS3 Dualshock.\nMy problem is the input configuration for player 2. It will not register my button presses for js1. js0 works fine. Jtest for joystick calibrating shows both controllers working.\n\nA: 1) Was my joypad actually being heard by the operating system? \nIn the terminal: \ncat /dev/input/js0 \nshows some funky output, and responds to my button pressed. The first plugged in dualshock was being heard. Now:\ncat /dev/input/js1\nshows the same thing, and also responds to button presses. (Hold down a button and see the pattern onscreen in terminal respond...)\n2) Now start snes9x-gtk program, go to options and then to preferences, does clicking on text field for snes buttons work?\nFor joypad 1, the program responds to controller input for js0, and binds the correct input to the correct snes button.\nFor joypad 2 (dropdown, and select 2), there is no response for the most part. Here is where I got lucky, I randomly clicked on the text field for snes button 'right', and pressing the right d-pad input on js1 registered \"Joystick 2 Button 5\", I switched to joypad 1, and found \"Joystick 1 Button 5\". So it worked, and was the correct button! \nProblem though, no other controller buttons were being heard. So I \ngedit ~/.snes9x/snes9x.xml\nand found under joypad 0, all the bindings numbers for js0.\nUnder joypad 1 (which is js1, but joypad 2 in the program.)(Programming languages starts lists at 0 not 1) I found:\n<binding name=\"Right\" binding=\"570425349\"/>\nevery other button had bindings of 0, so they were not being set. I looked back at joypad 0, and found the equivalent binding for js0 was \n<binding name=\"Right\" binding=\"553648133\"/>\nso this doesn't immediatly help unleass you have all the bindings for js0, which since input for joypad 1 in preferences did hear all the button presses, I had all the bindings. Using a little bit of logic and math, I looked at the binding for left under joypad 0 and got:\n<binding name=\"Left\" binding=\"553648135\"/>\nso the left binding input was 2 more than the right binding. So under joypad 1 (js1)\nthis: <binding name=\"Left\" binding=\"0\"/>\nbecame this: <binding name=\"Left\" binding=\"570425351\"/>\nand I saved the xml file, and reopened snes9x-gtk, lo and behold under joypad 2, it showed for the button left \"Joystick 2 Button 7\", which 7 is 2 more than button 5!\nI was able to edit the rest of the buttons I needed under js1. Hopefully I explained it well enough, not sure if the bindings are universal for all dualshocks.\n3) Did the games finally work? Yes, I tested super mario world for 2 player, and luigi responded to the second Dualshock I had plugged in.\n", "Q: How to make a centred, wrapped and padded container of elements in QML?

This image must be distributed as a separate package, because it is not published under a Free Software license.\nThe Oracle packages of VirtualBox, however, provide the guest additions ISO image directly, and not in a separate package, so the virtualbox-guest-additions-iso is not needed if you use the Oracle packages, and it should be removed prior to installing them.\n", "Q: GRUB Bootloader: Windows 8 Selection Not Working I dual boot Windows 8 with Ubuntu 12.10, and when I turn on my laptop, I see the GRUB bootloader which is fine.

I don't recommend uninstalling that package because you'll end up with unmet dependencies problems, but you could just remove the file:\nsudo rm /usr/share/backgrounds/warty-final-ubuntu.png\n\nor replace it with your black background:\nsudo wget http://www.razflections.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/black.png -O /usr/share/backgrounds/warty-final-ubuntu.png\n\nKeep in mind that if ubuntu-wallpapers package gets updated the original file will be restored, then you'll have replace (or remove) it again.\n", "Q: Weird hostname resolving to my localhost Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\nHi, when I ping two specific domain names (I'll just call them foo.net and foo.org)  they both resolve to my localhost.

It's also only my host that has this problem, my VMs and brothers machine don't resolve the name at all.\nAlso, when I type foo.net or foo.org into my browser, it sends me to my local apache server root.  I tried other random names but only those two are resolving to localhost, everything else seems to work normal.\n/etc/hosts and /etc/resolv.conf look normal, although I'm not an expert on either.  Dig shows the correct DNS server and the answer comes out to my loopback address. Tracepath completes at localhost with one hop.\nNot sure what's going on.\n\nA: This isn't a security problem. It's perfectly possible for anyone to set up any domain name and have its A record point to 127.0.0.1, or a CNAME to localhost or localhost.localdomain.\nIf you have a security problem, it is due to an assumption that others cannot do this.

I tried some programs but they cant bet set on 1 fps :*(\n\nA: The program imagination from the 13.04 repository combined with avconv also from the main Raring repository allowed me to make a 1 FPS video (with music!) just for you.\nThe destination video file is 693180 octets long for an average of 69KB/second which isn't bad since some of the source images were larger than 100KB and I didn't even bother trying to optimize anything.\nThe time consuming part of the exercise was signing up to a video hosting service so you could see my 10 second magnum opus.  \nEDIT Seeing slides at 1 FPS is pretty fatiguing even for 10 seconds; I can't imagine what 6 hours of that would do. In service to my fans, I made the same video but at 0.2FPS. Of course this bumped the video size up, but one does have to suffer for one's art, I hear. Enjoy the \"director's cut\"\nI don't think you understand how video compression works; parts of an image that stay the same don't require (barely any) extra video data. The increase in file size has a lot to do with there being 5 times as much audio data.\n", "Q: Is it possible for 2 users to work at the same time, one is connected remotely? And how to set it up? I am running Xubuntu on my main PC at home.\nIs it possible for 2 users to work simultaneously on one computer,\nwhile one is physically in front of the computer, and another one is connected remotely from another Ubuntu PC?\nEDIT: Both users need a GUI environment.\nIf yes, how do I set it up?\nEDIT 3: I have a powerful desktop PC (recently converted to Linux :) ) and 2 laptops. The desktop PC has a VM with all the Graphic Design software on it.  Me and my friend both work on a web project, and the laptops are not suitable for it. The laptop is good for development, but every now and then I need to access the Graphical Design software, so I need the Desktop. My friend works on Linux Graphics tools and also needs the Desktop.\nSo we decided to share the Desktop, while he will be working on it directly, I would like to connect to it from my Laptop to access the VM. Desktop and laptop are in one LAN.\nEDIT2: Thanks, for the comments and answers, I got on track with this. A quick search revealed 2 options:\n\n\n*\n\n*SSH-X or \"X11 Forwarding via SSH\" (as you already pointed out)\n\n*FreeNX\n\n\nWhich direction would you recommend? Or a better alternative if you know one.\nSorry for bad explanation, I don't have good writing skills.\n\nA: There are many ways you could accomplish this, the first couple that are most often used would be ssh (Secure Shell - so, primarily command-line interface to start), and other graphical interfacing methods like rdesktop.\nYou can also use a combination of ssh and rdesktop or other methods, depending on what you're trying to accomplish.  As other users have mentioned, however, it would be worth describing (in some detail) what you're trying to achieve.  ;)\nSince you want a GUI-interface for both of the simultaneous users, I'd suggest using xrdp and the aforementioned rdesktop\nsudo apt-get install xrdp\n\nThen run rdesktop from whatever machine you're trying to connect to the server from.  A good test (done entirely on the server) is doing the following:\nrdesktop localhost\n\n.. and logging in as the 'second' user.  If it works, you'll simply need to try from the other machine the same way, but there's no need to install xrdp on that system (since that's the server).\nAlternatively, if you just want to connect via a shell interface:\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\n... and, with the very basic default configurations, you're already setup to go.  Assuming your network has no port blocking or firewalls on the server-side, you should then be able to (from the other PC):\nssh <server IP address>\n\nOr, to test on the server just to ensure it's ready (you would actually do this on the server's terminal window itself):\nssh localhost\n\nDefinitely look at ssh --help for detailed instructions on how to specify ports, users, etc. as you please.\n\nA: Of course you can, that's been a central component of the Unix Time Sharing system since the day it was written circa 1970. So also is X Windows designed to be multi-user and network transparent.\nIf you mean \"how do I set this up?\", you should ask a more detailed question.\n\nA: A very common way to do this is using ssh which gives you a remote shell.\nYou can also use \"ssh -X\" to transparently forward X11, allowing you to run e.g. Eclipse or Firefox.  This is however, somewhat slow, perhaps even more than you like.\nThere is more than one way to do it.  What fits you best, depends on what you work with, how fast a connection there is, and what is important to you.\n\nBased on the comments, the simplest approach might simply be to use your laptops as X-terminals and enable XDM on the powerful server (like in the very old days).\nWhen XDM is running you most likely need something like \"X -query powerfulhost\" or \"X -broadcast\" from a non-graphic login.  I have not done this in 15 years, so I might remember wrong.  \n\nA: I'd use VNC because I have had experience of running several user sessions on the server (\"powerful desktop machine\") each tempted to a different desktop.\nVNC was never designed to be just for sharing a desktop with other people.\nThe heavy computing is all done on the server, and all the laptops have to do is show the picture that results from it - and pass keystrokes and mouse movement back.\nI'm interested that desktop also does it for Linux.

In the bottom icon is again Eclipse Juno, but started from the command line. Thank you for your help.\n\nEDIT:\nok, ~/applications is taking more fame than it should. This is just a personal folder to keep applications, binaries and other personal stuff. I created the files in my personal folder and then copied the generated .desktop files in /usr/share/applications.\n\nA: Why did you create your desktop file in ~/applications directory? This desktop file should be placed into /usr/share/applications or into ~/.local/share/applications.\nThe right and successful way to do this is to use Main Menu (it can be installed with sudo apt-get install alacarte command). Search for it in Dash or you can open it from Terminal with this command:\nalacarte\n\nAfter it opens, follow the instructions in the image below:\n\nYou can check after in ~/.local/share/applications if you have a new desktop file for Eclipse Juno. The name of the new fesktop file should be something like alacarte-made-x.desktop (where x is a number). And now if you want a copy of this file in your ~/applications directory, you can copy it there without no problem.\nAnd another one important thing: use the full path to the application for command (Exec=/path/to/eclipse) in both desktop files.\nSee also: \n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.gnome.org/integration-guide/stable/desktop-files.html.en\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UnityLaunchersAndDesktopFiles\n\n*http://www.frankrock74.it/frankrock74/?p=1738 (in Italian language)\n\n", "Q: Change unlock screen appearance I wonder if it's possible to change the appearance of the unlock screen as I'm not a big fan of this default greyish dialog box:\n\n(Image reference: http://www.tuxgarage.com/2012/04/ubuntu-12-04-precise-pangolin-review.html)\nI have literally no experience with applying any themes in Ubuntu and whenever I've tried to change a specific part of the interface I think I changed pretty much anything but the part I'd like to change.\nTherefore I'm also not sure if it's possible to just change this dialog box or if I've to apply a broader theme.

I am currently building a gaming PC of my own and was wanting to cut out the ridiculous cost of $100 for windows 7 or 8 for my budget build. Is there any way that battlefield 3 could be ran with moderate to high settings with a high consistency on the current version of Ubuntu?\n\nA: The short answer is no. Ubuntu cannot run windows games that use 3D extensively unless there is a specific version for Linux. Wine doesn't cut it as most games will not work if they use 3D extensivley. Some 3D games work, but they tend to be 5-10 year old games,\nI forked out for the extra money for Windows and use it for Games only. A linux only gaming rig will limit the games you play.

It has a GUI as well.\nAfter Enabling the Universe Repository you can install it with: \nsudo apt-get install mat\n\n\nA: Yes, there is a tool to remove metadata called exiv2.\nUsage: exiv2 rm /path/to/location/files\n\nA: You can use Metadata Extraction Tool\n\nThe Metadata Extract Tool includes a number of 'adapters' that extract\n  metadata from specific file types. Extractors are currently provided\n  for:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Images: BMP, GIF, JPEG and TIFF.\n  \n*Office documents: MS Word (version 2, 6), Word Perfect, Open Office    (version 1), MS Works, MS Excel, MS PowerPoint, and PDF.\n  \n*Audio and Video: WAV, MP3 (normal and with ID3Tags), BFW, FLAC.\n  \n*Markup languages: HTML and XML.\n  \n*Internet files: ARC\n  \n  \n  If a file type is unknown the tool applies a generic adapter, which\n  extracts data that the host system 'knows' about any given file (such\n  as size, file name, and date created).\n\nFor more information, and to download visit Metadata Extraction Tool\nSource:Metadata Extraction Tool\n\nA: First, install exiftool using this command:\nsudo apt-get install libimage-exiftool-perl\n\nThen, go into the directory with the JPEG files. If you want to remove metadata from every file in the directory, use\nexiftool -all= *.jpg\n\nFor single file, use\nexiftool -all= <filename>.jpg\n\n\nA: When using the command exiftool -all= inputfile shared here on PDF files, I got this message:\n\nWarning: [minor] ExifTool PDF edits are reversible. Deleted tags may\nbe recovered!\n\nAnd by looking for the error message on a search engine, I found https://exiftool.org/forum/index.php?topic=4722.0 with a link to https://exiftool.org/TagNames/PDF.html that mentions:\n\nAll metadata edits are reversible. While this would normally be\nconsidered an advantage, it is a potential security problem because\nold information is never actually deleted from the file. (However,\nafter running ExifTool the old information may be removed permanently\nusing the \"qpdf\" utility with this command: \"qpdf --linearize in.pdf\nout.pdf\".)\n\nSo if you really want to delete the metadata from PDF files so it cannot be recovered instead of just hiding it, you should use the command qpdf --linearize in.pdf out.pdf afterwards.\nIf you want to try to recover the hidden / removed metadata from PDF files, the man page https://exiftool.org/exiftool_pod.html explains how to do it:\n\nChanges to PDF files by ExifTool are reversible (by deleting the\nupdate with -PDF-update:all=) because the original information is\nnever actually deleted from the file. So ExifTool alone may not be\nused to securely edit metadata in PDF files.\n\nSo the command will be something like exiftool -PDF-update:all= inputfile. You can then check the properties of the file in your PDF viewer to see if the metadata is restored.\nNote: this solution does not clean metadata of embedded resources like images unlike the tool mat2 shared in another answer (except when using lightweight mode: https://0xacab.org/jvoisin/mat2/-/blob/master/doc/implementation_notes.md#lightweight-cleaning-mode). But images metadata is not always present in PDF files. For example to do a PDF export with LibreOffice Writer and keep metadata, we need to disable \"Reduce image resolution\" (an answer also mentioned that we need to enable \"Lossless compression\" but I did not need it: https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/185507/does-embedding-images-in-pdf-retain-metadata).\nThen I was able to save the image with metadata from the PDF file with LibreOffice Draw and view the metadata with GIMP in the menu \"Image -> Metadata -> View Metadata\".\n\nA: exiftool -all= inputfile\n\nThe latest version of exiftool supports most file formats.\nOutput:\n\n*\n\n*If the input file contained metadata, it removes the metadata and overwrites inputfile, but saves a copy of the original as inputfile_original in the same folder.\n\n*If the input file did not contain metadata, it performs no changes.\n\nThere are options in ExifTool to delete the original file: -overwrite_original and -overwrite_original_in_place.\n", "Q: How do I install windows vista home premium onto ubuntu How do I boot windows home premium onto ubuntu  using ubuntu?\n\nA: You can run a virtual installation of this and other operating systems by installing Virtual Box.

I am able to boot from the USB drive without any problem but not from the hard disk.  Any help is greatly appreciated.\nThanks,\nKiran.\n\nA: This is likely UEFI related. Usually on new computers (which use UEFI instead of BIOS), when selecting the device to boot from, you should have the choice to use UEFI or non UEFI mode for the USB stick. Depending on your choice, the respective bootloader is installed during Ubuntu installation (in other words, if you choose wrong here, the system might not boot after installation). If you have this choice, use the UEFI mode - if your computer does not use UEFI, you don't have the option anyhow. If you used EFI during installation and your system doesn't boot nevertheless, check your EFI settings for an option called quick boot or similar and disable it. \nIf you don't get the installation to work in EFI mode , you can use BIOS emulation. To enable it, open your EFI settings and disable EFI booting, secure boot, etc. If there is a setting that let's you choose between EFI and BIOS boot mode, select BIOS. \nCheck also the article on the Ubuntu Wiki about UEFI (or maybe it's called EFI?) \n", "Q: Is there an equivalent to book-keeping package \"Pastel\" in Ubuntu?

For 12.04 and 12.10 there exists a PPA with backported versions of the necessary packages.\nNote that your device must be unlocked to access the storage of the device with Ubuntu via MTP.\n\nIf you get an error message, try to replug the device once.\n\nCitation from Jorge Castro's on adding the PPA for Are there any plans to improve mtp support on future Ubuntu releases?:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Add the PPA to your system\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:langdalepl/gvfs-mtp\nsudo apt-get update\n\n  \n*Then, launch Software Updater (previously known as Update Manager) and install the available updates.\n  \n*Once everything has been updated successfully, restart your computer, unlock your Android device, connect it via USB and it should\n  show up in your file manager.\n\nPlease refer to\n  What are PPAs and how do I use them?\n  if you have questions about anything related to a Personal Package\n  Archives (PPA) and refer to the source on Web Upd8 (it has some\n  comments worth reading).\n\nTo clear things up:\n\n\n*\n\n*You don't need to unlock the booloader (fastboot oem unlock) or root your phone. Unlocking just refers to the Android lockscreen in this answer.\n\n*You don't need to add udev rules to get MTP access. These are meant for developer access (adb and fastboot protocols). You can find the original instructions over at the android site if you're interested (chapter: Configuring USB Access).\n\n*This solution applies to all Android devices providing MTP functionality and probably all non-Android devices with MTP functionality.\n\n\nA: Curiously enough, the application called Gigolo does a really good job at detecting and mounting Android devices.  I was using my Galaxy Nexus.  It just magically showed up in Gigolo's list of available devices.  I right-clicked and \"connected\" the Galaxy Nexus, then I right-clicked it again and \"open\" worked to launch it in my file browser.\nI was using Xubuntu 13.10 doing this. This should be the command for installing it from the terminal:\n$ apt-get install gigolo\n\n", "Q: How to copy a website inside my WWW to another computer and make it work? I have designed a website to create and sign certificates (.csr, .key, .crt, .p12) in my netbook using Ubuntu 12.04.

You must need to use the same technology. e.g. If your system use a database, you will need the same database and the same credentials to login successfully. \nAlso its very possible that the links of your site are pointing to different places after move the whole project to a different directory. Not only simple a links, but JavaScript code, CSS files and more. That behavior depends on your code.\nTheoretically, if you solve this issues, you shouldn't have problems to move the project copying the files.\n\nAbout your mention of the problem trying to make the index file works, are you sure that the lab computer have a completely functional LAMP environment? Is it correct the content of the /etc/hosts file?\n", "Q: dual boot windows 8 eufi and Ubuntu on separate hard drives I have Ubuntu 13.04 installed and working fine, added a second hard drive and installed windows 8 on the second hard drive. now windows works fine but only if I have the Ubuntu drive disconnected.

If so how do I launch the program?  How about Avery Wizard for Microsoft Office in LibreOffice?\n\nA: I use Avery Design pro a lot, but its has been giving me problems using wine.  Lockup, crashes, and other things.  I found gLables, and for me and what I do is doing OK, so go ahead, and try gLables.\n\ngLabels is a lightweight program for creating labels, barcodes,\n  business cards and media covers for the GNOME desktop environment. It\n  is designed to work with various laser/ink-jet peel-off label and\n  business card sheets that you'll find at most office supply stores.\ngLabels also supports mail merge from sources such as CSV files,\n  vCards and Evolution data servers.\n\nTo Install gLables \nNow I have downloaded multiple templates from Avery's site, and have been working with them using Libreoffice Writer, with no problems.

You can also create persistent Desktop Widgets that display a directory or links to related items and applications.\nThere are currently three types of Drawers:\nBasic Drawers: A favorite for the Unity Launcher that can contain any combination of files, applications, web links or directories. Just drag and drop on the icon or open drawer and your item will be added.  Left-clicking the launcher \"opens a drawer\" with an icon view of each item for launching. Right-clicking allows fast launching through quicklists.  Use Basic Drawers for quick creation of application categories or to keep shortcuts of related documents and links together when working on a project. Drawers can even be nested within one another (just drag from Dash to open drawer).\nAppMenu Drawers: A favorite for the Unity Launcher that displays a \"Gnome Classic-like\" application menu, drawers-style!  Applications are categorized and displayed automatically, so there's no need to add applications manually to the drawer.  An AppMenu Drawer can be created at any sub-level (e.g. Accessories or Games) or items in sub-levels can be pinned to the Launcher's quicklist.  If you wish to edit the menu structure, you must currently use an xdg-menu editor such as alacarte or menulibre.\nActive Drawers: A favorite for the Unity Launcher that links to a specific directory. Any files dragged to the icon will be copied to that directory.  A quicklist is generated after each opening with the 10 most recently modified files or files can be pinned to stay in the quicklist.  Opening the Drawer displays a folder view that is updated in real time.  Pin it to the desktop and you have a Folder View Widget!\nFor support, please contact at http://launchpad.net/drawers\n\n", "Q: link between photo and thumb in shotwell (v 12, db schema 15, ubuntu 12.04) How do I find the corresponding thumb to a photo in shotwell, schema version 15?  The thumb files seem to have hex numbering that doesn't seem to correspond to anything in the photo table as far as I can tell.\n\nA: The question's almost a year old, but I was trying to accomplish the same, and it's quite easy, so I thought I'll share my solution. The thumbnail file names are generated simply from the \"id\" field for an image's entry in PhotoTable. The id is stored as a decimal number, and you simply have to convert it to hexadecimal.\nThis will print out the filename to an image's corresponding thumbnail (replace $path with the full path to the image, or alter the match criterion according to your needs):\nsqlite3 ~/.local/share/shotwell/data/photo.db \"select id from PhotoTable where filename = '$path'\" | xargs printf \"thumb%016x.jpg\\n\"\n\n", "Q: Problem installing Ubuntu on Several computers I am trying desperately to place Ubuntu on four types of machines.

Also when I reboot it does not ask for my login it shows the install option.\n\nA: If when you reboot it does not ask for your login, but instead it shows the install option, that probably means that you forgot to remove the CD, DVD or USB flash drive that you used to install Ubuntu with. That would also explain why you got the ubuntu@ubuntu when you opened the terminal since in the Ubuntu live CD/DVD/USB, ubuntu is the default username and it's also the name of the machine that you're working on.\nAfter you have installed Ubuntu, the terminal opens by default to the /home/USERNAME directory where USERNAME is the username you use to login to Ubuntu. The shortcut for /home/USERNAME in the terminal is the ~ (tilde) character.\n\nA: You should just reinstall the OS.

My attempts to edit it have not been successful.\n\nA: Okay, resolved this with a rather pointless workaround. You will need to set up two printer devices using different drivers, one for each size of paper. \n\n\n*\n\n*Put the B-size/11×17\" paper in Tray 1 (the upper one), and the Letter paper in Tray 2. This, unfortunately, matters — the driver that can print large format can only access the upper tray. On the setup menu on the printer console, tell the printer which tray holds what size of paper.\n\n*Install the epson-inkjet-printer-escpr driver; it should be in the standard Ubuntu repos. Define a printer (wf7520-lf, for example) that uses this driver. Set the paper size to \"US B 11 x 17 in\".\n\n*Ensure that the lsb and lsb-printing packages are installed: sudo apt-get install lsb lsb-printing\n\n*Download and install the non-free epson-201115w driver from the EPSON Download Center. Define a printer (I used wf-7520 for the name) using this driver, making sure that the correct PPD (epson-inkjet-printer 1.0.0-1lsb3.2 (Seiko Epson Corporation LSB 3.2)) is used. Set it up to use Letter paper, and (important!) set the source to Paper Cassette 2. You might want to make this printer the system default.\n\n\nTo print to large format, use the command:\nlp -d wf7520-lf -o PageSize=USB file.pdf\n\nTo print regular size, just send the job to the wf-7520 device.\n", "Q: Most current version of Ubuntu I can run on a Core 2 Duo Macbook pro 7,1?

My question is which way should I move the divider, and how much memory to allocate to each side? Thanks for any help you could offer.\n\nA: In order to avoid some boot problems, I generally recommend:\n\n\n*\n\n*via the Windows tools, shrink your Windows partition to 80GB.\n\n*install Ubuntu in the remaining space.\n\n*if any boot problem, via the Gparted tool, reduce the Ubuntu partition to 20GB.

Also, the third line in your sample was missing a $ sign (and contained an additional space). Lastly, there is no need to repeat the same path (DRY) - just use the already defined variable.\nEDIT (2020-03-08):\nWhile the ANDROID_SDK environment variable still continues to work for the most part, it has been deprecated by Google, and replaced with ANDROID_SDK_ROOT.

Please help me!!\nP.S When I try to boot windows, it stays on the splash screen trying to boot, and there isn't a way to access the recovery partition. I don't have windows discs either.\n\nA: In my experience, such problems occur when you use re-writable cds. Obtain a live CD that is able to install ubuntu properly. Then install it on the partition that doesn't have any windows data. The installation should also install the grub, which will allow you to boot into either of your operating systems.\nEven if you are not able to recover windows, you should be able to recover your files.\n\nA: First, download the iso image again, check the MD5 or SHA checksum (to ensure that the downloaded iso is correct byte-per-byte), finally burn it at a slow speed (to reduce the likelihood of a write error).\nThe partition that Windows created is probably FAT or NTFS, and Ubuntu cannot be installed on either of them. In the Live CD, open Gparted, delete the partition you created in Windows. Then run the installer, choose \"Install alongside Windows\", and leave the partitioning work to the installer.\nIf the installation aborts, please tell us the exact error message.\n", "Q: Difference between linux headers What are Linux headers? Why are there two headers namely 3.5.0-34 and 3.2.0-48 in my latest Ubuntu update (just an observation).\n\nA: These packages contain files that are part of the source code of the Linux kernel, available under /usr/src if you would like to take a look. They are just the makefiles and header files (file extension .h), which define the public API of the kernel, which is needed to compile programs that interact with the kernel directly (two examples that come up in internet searches are device drivers and virtualization software).\nYou have two versions because one is for your current kernel and the other is for an older kernel that you used previously. Ubuntu by default is very conservative with kernel-related files and takes a number of precautions to avoid removing them when they are still needed, and sometimes this results in a gradual accumulation of such packages as new versions are installed.\n", "Q: How to remove Ubuntu Software Center I recently updated 13.04, and upgraded the kernel.

Now when I try to decrypt my backup text file, Ubuntu warns me \n\nDecryption Failed. You probably do not have the decryption key.\n\nPlease help, I am new to Ubuntu.\n\nA: Missing Private Keys\nGnuPG cannot find your private key, at least not the one for decrypting.\nDo gpg --list-secret-keys.

Is there a subkey whose line is ending with \"E\" for encryption?\nIf that fails, make sure once again you imported to the right key ring (each user has it's own, and you could add another keyring if you want somewhere else -- most easy way would be to import the key again.\nIf this also fails, you probably didn't export the private keys. Try to look at the headers of the exported file, if it is ascii-armored, you should read something like\n-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----\n\nIf you only exported the public key, you will read PUBLIC instead.\nHow to Recover My Secret Keys?\nYou cannot recalculate them from your public keys. If you could, everybody would be able to!\nSurely you've got a backup of your old user folder. Recover it somewhere and use gpg --homedir /path/to/old/.gnupg -a --export-secret-keys [your-key-id] >~/secret-key.asc to export your private key from it which you can reimport to your new keyring.\nIf you haven't got the key any more, you should send your revocation certificate to the keyservers now.

So I have a 2005 one-core Acer, was great at the time but old now. Ubuntu has kept this thing moving forward working very well, however the latest two versions have been heavy on it. Most importantly the last one I downloaded worked relatively fine but as I installed updates and kernels those didn't work. \nExample:\nKernel 3.2 works fine but the newer 3.5 don't even load up. My question is i I download the latest release and it gets rid of 3.2 and the new one doesn't load up how would I manage getting an old kernel up on the GRUB or put in an older version of Ubuntu.\nThank you and sorry for being so novice at this.\n\nA: Unless you manually deleted the old kernel, you will still have these on your machine.\nHold down the Shift key as you boot up and it will take you to the Grub screen. From here, you can choose which version of the kernel to boot into.\nIf you really don't need the newer ones you can find which kernel you're currently using by going to the terminal and running\nuname -r\n\nto see which kernel you're using. Then run\ndpkg -l | grep linux-image\n\nand note the kernel versions you don't need anymore (anything starting 3.5 I guess but if the kernel you're running works fine, you can get read of all the others). Then you can run\nsudo apt-get purge linux-image-3.5.x-xx-generic\n\nThat should free up some disk space for you too\n", "Q: Partitioning Help Does Ubuntu partition drives when you install it alongside Windows 7? I remember reading that the maximum partition allowed is 4 (or something)\n\nA: Ubuntu partitions drives when you install it alongside Windows. \nMaster Boot Record (MBR) disks use the standard BIOS partition table. GUID Partition Table (GPT) disks use Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI). Hard disk drives that use Master Boot Record partitioning can have a maximum of 4 primary partitions. One of the primary partitions can be an extended partition. An extended partition can contain any number of logical partitions.\nDisk drives that are formatted with GPT Partitioning can have 128 partitions by default. GPT drives have the advantage of being able to boot from hard disk drives that are larger than 2TB.\n", "Q: pm-utils broke my system and didn't fix it when I purged it and all of its dependencies Before I installed pm-utils, closing the lid just turned the screen off.

Tasksel also doesn't have these versions of packages yet.\n\nA: If you don't want to install the Apache 2.4 & PHP 5.5 by hand, you can find both in my PHP5 PPA.\nI will add more PHP extensions and Apache 2.4 modules as people will come and ask for them.\nThere's also a MySQL 5.5 and MySQL 5.6 PPAs (and more).\n\nA: In general you are not likely to find the latest versions on any pre-built stack, since there will always be a time lag between a new version release and package releases in official repositories due to the need to \"iron out\" system specific dependencies and quirks. \nYou have three options : \n\n\n*\n\n*Download Ubuntu specific binaries of the latest version (if they exist) from the corresponding sites.\n\n*Download the source code from said sites and compile locally.\n\n*Wait for the version you are interested in to be included in the official repositories.\n\n\nNow, unless there is a very specific option/need that is not offered/met in the available packages or you cannot wait for the vesrion to be included to the repositories, I suggest you go with the pre-build binaries. \nThen again, compiling from source code is a great character building experience that will help you appreciate the hard work package maintainers do :-) You will have to resolve any package dependencies manually.\nThat being said, large and active projects like Apache, PHP and MySQL offer quite exhaustive documentation and how-to's for installing from source.\n\nA: Before to install the new versions, you should uninstall any other versions that you have installed before.\nInstall Apache 2.4.4\n\n\n*\n\n*Before installing Apache 2.4.4, you should install PCRE, otherwise it will not succeed. The process of installing PCRE is simple. After you downloaded it, run in terminal next commands:\n\nsudo ./configure\nsudo make\nsudo make install\n\n\n\n*Download APR and APR-Util from http://apr.apache.org, unpack them to Apache directory, /srclib/apr and /srclib/apr-util (no version numbers in the directory names) and type following commands to install Apache:\n\nsudo ./configure --with-included-apr\nsudo make\nsudo make install\n\n\n\n*Type following command to start Apache:\n\nsudo /usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl start\n\n\nThere may be something wrongs like:\n/usr/local/apache2/bin/httpd: error while loading shared libraries: libpcre.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nType following command to see httpd’s shared library dependencies:\nldd httpd\n\nFound \"libpcre.so.1 => not found\", then type the following command to update links:\nsudo ldconfig\n\nRestart Apache and should work.\nSource: http://zhuojun.info/?p=1121\nInstall PHP 5.4.16\n\n\n*\n\n*Download PHP 5.4.16 from http://php.net/downloads.php\n\n*Check this post to see how to install a .tar.bz2 file: How to install a .tar.gz (or .tar.bz2) file?\nInstall MySQL 5.5.31\n\n\n*\n\n*Download MySQL 5.5.31 from http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.5.html. In fact, MySQL 5.5.32 is the latest version.\n\n*Check this post see how to install a .rpm file: How do I install and manage RPMs?\n\nA: Another convenient way to install the latest versions of Apache, Php and Mysql I found very convenient is to use PPA i.e. Personal Package Archieve. Just search for ppa's for the software package you want and just add that ppa to the repositories and install the software using the following commands. Remember PPA's are built by users who want to help other users or developers by providing them with the latest softwares.\nPPA I used for Apache2.4.4: ppa:patrickdk/apache24\nPPA I used for Php5.5.0: ppa:ondrej/php5-experimental\nPPA I used for Mysql 5.5.32: ppa:ondrej/mysql\n\nAlso there are other ppa's available.\n   shell>add-apt-repository ppa:ppa-name\n   shell>apt-get update\n   shell>apt-get install software-name\n\nMaybe it will be convenient for any user with the same question as mine. \n", "Q: Does TLP automatically start when my system boots? Does TLP automatically start when my system boots? Everytime i boot into Ubuntu i open a terminal and type sudo tlp startonly then i can find the difference in the system temperature.

Once I boot up, I usually can go for around an hour and then it all cuts out. If I remove the usb adapter and plug it back in I seem to get a few more minutes. I have been using the setup on windows 7 and it works fine there (if I boot into windows it works still). \nI have been Googling for a solution and have come across many things but most people have no connection at all so I am unsure if it is the same issue. \nThe driver I am using is the default one Ubuntu installed: rt2800usb\nlsusb\nBus 001 Device 007: ID 13b1:002f Linksys AE1000 v1 802.11n [Ralink RT3572]\nBus 003 Device 002: ID 046d:c069 Logitech, Inc.

I have installed samba but i didn't understand how to create. \nPlease help me and tell me the procedure of sharing. I am using Ubuntu 12.04 version.\n\nA: Open \"Files,\" navigate to the folder you want to share, right-click it, choose \"Properties,\" switch to the \"Share\" tab, tick \"Share this folder,\" adjust other options on the tab as needed and, finally, click the \"Create Share\" button. Its icon will now indicate (two arrows) that it is being shared. \n", "Q: Looking for a mouse with a couple extra buttons for programming to copy/paste I've been browsing dozens of mice today--Microsoft, Logitech, Razer, Steelseries, etc.  I'm looking for an idiot-proof Linux/Ubuntu/Fedora mouse that has extra buttons:\n\n\n*\n\n*left mouse click, right mouse click, scroll wheel, scroll wheel (standard stuff)\n\n*side buttons for thumb forward & back (usually on mice today)\n\n*two additional buttons that I can map to copy and paste\nSo essentially, a standard mouse, plus 2 or 3 additional buttons.

It was for compiling some programs but I don't do it anymore. Is there anyway of removing them without manually picking them out in synaptic, it is very stressing to see a long list of packages with a dev on it \n\nA: you can do this from the terminal to get a list of installed dev packages.

I want to make it so that when I swipe a finger from the bottom of the screen the toolbar comes up with buttons on it.\n\nA: You do this by adding a ToolbarItems component to your Page's tools property: http://developer.ubuntu.com/api/qml/sdk-1.0/Ubuntu.Components.ToolbarItems/\nThe MainView will look for that property, and if it has actions it will automatically add the necessary toolbar and make it respond to swiping-up from the bottom.\n", "Q: Are there any valid layout and writing programs for ubuntu? I'm beginning my phd thesis and really need good writing, layout and reference management programms. I would love to do it with Ubuntu but I'm not sure if it'll work.\nI tried Lyx & Bibtex/Jabref but it seems to be better for sciences not for humanites (citations are a mess! I tried jurabib but it didn't work). I really, really don't want to use some version of Office. \nDo you have suggestions?\n\nA: I'm an avid fan of using TexMaker but if you didn't find Lyx and Bibtex to your liking it might not be to your taste. If you're willing to give Latex editors another try This answer on Latex editors will most likely be complete enough to help you out.\nOtherwise if you're looking for less scientific orientated I'd suggest one of the following:\n\n\nLibre Office Writer\n\n\n\nWhich is readily available in the Ubuntu Software Centre, you just search for LibreOffice and install it, I can't give you an opinion on the referencing as I've never had to use it, but I'd assume it works well enough.\n\n\nKingsoft Writer\n\n\nWhich has an interface that looks similar to Microsoft Office as you can see in the following screenshot:\n\nI've personally found Kingsoft seems to be preferred by people used to working on Windows as their main operating system. Although I prefer using Latex personally, the referencing in Kingsoft is quite intuitive and easy to follow as you can see here in the reference tab: \n\nYou can download the .deb file to install it via software centre by clicking on the button below:\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note: Installing Kingsoft will install a PPA so if you have any doubts on security please read: Are PPA's safe to add to my system and what are some \"red flags\" to watch out for? if you're unsure of what this implies.\n", "Q: Can I use libraries for my Ubuntu Touch app? I have created an Ubuntu Touch app that uses .a libraries that I have written myself. Can I use those in Ubuntu Touch? If yes, where do I store them and how can I access them?\n\nA: You can include them with your app, installing them to the same directory as the rest of your files.  If the rest of your app is in QML, and you are using qmlscene to launch it, use the -I flag to add your library's path to where qmlscene will try to load them from.\n", "Q: How to change the owner of /user/src I want to copy a folder to the directory /user/src and I can't do it because its owner is set to \"root\" and it says I am not the root. But I am in the administrator group.\nHow to change the owner of that folder and/or give me permission to access and modify it?\nOr how to login as root if this is easier?\n\nA: if you open terminal (press cntrl+atl+t)\ntype cp --help\nit will display all instructions you need to copy files from the terminal\nthe reason to do it from the terminal is if you type sudo before any command it will execute the command as root\n\njust realised another method (may be easier)\n\n\n*\n\n*close all file browsers in ubuntu.\n\n*run command: gksudo nautilus\n\n*a file browser will be opened as root.\n\n*you can use this windows you browse and copy the file you wish.\n\n\nNote if you cant find your ubuntu files, click file system on the right, then home, then your username\n\nA: Sure thing. Don't tell us what you are trying to achieve. After all we are not trustworthy, aren't we? (Why are you asking us then?) And you have a right to shoot yourself in the foot.\nGo ahead, here is your solution:\nsudo ln -s /usr /user\nsudo chown $USER -R /user/src   # Like a BOSS!\n\nNext time when the package manager wants to put new files into that directory or modify existing ones, well...\ndrwxr-xr-x   6 _BOSS_ root  4096 Jun 14 09:27 src/\n\nbooyah... permission denied\nWhy this is a bad idea\nThat directory is really named usr, it's not a typo and its permissions are not set like this to annoy you. This is all defined by a standard (FHS - Filesystem Hierarchy Standard) and the entire system with its programs and services relies on this structure to function properly. Therefore you do not change permissions and ownership or blindly copy stuff into there because some guide tells you to do so.\nIf you really need to copy source code manually to a location where the tools can pick it up, it is recommended to copy the source code to /usr/local/src. This way non-packaged source code can be easily distinguished from packaged and system managed source code.\nCaution: You can still not be safe if some malformed custom built kernel module breaks your kernel.\n\nA: Root owns /usr/src for security reasons. You should never, ever change the owner to someone else, it will create drastic security holes. Instead, just run your commands as root:  \nsudo cp myfile /usr/scr/someDestination  \n\nThe prefix sudo gives the command root privileges.  \nAnother way, but less recommended, is to run Nautilus, Ubuntu's default file manager, as the root user:  \ngksu nautilus \n\n(note: If you are running 13.04 you might need to install gksu before you can use it.)       \n", "Q: Can I use a .settings file for my Ubuntu Touch application? Can I use a .settings file for my Ubuntu Touch application? Or isn't that allowed? If yes, where should I store it? I'm developing an app that creates files for usage in my app. Should I use XML for that? What should I use? I'd also like users to exchange those created files with other users that have the same app (via bluetooth or the net). Is that possible yet?\n\nA: In the near future the SDK will provide a GSettings backend to store your application's settings.\nUntil then, I'd recommend using the LocalStorage module to store your settings in a database.\nYou can see an example of how the calculator core app uses LocalStorage.\n", "Q: I have broken Ubuntu!

How should I troubleshoot?\nThanks\n\nA: I had this behaviour and fixed it by replacing the driver for my Realtek RTL111/8168B NIC. Instead of using the r8169 driver included in the kernel I used the realtek r8168 driver from realtek (inspired by this post).\nNote, I'd tried to upgrade my way out of the problem by installing a 3.10 kernel which unfortunately prevents the realtek driver from building until I applied the patch from (I don't have enough reputation for a third link so google 'r8168 NETIF_F_HW_VLAN_RX undeclared' and click first link). Unfortunately the patch had white space issues that I ended up manually fixing before it would apply.\n\nA: Had the same problem on Ubuntu 16.04 running on GIGABYTE GA-Z97X-UD7 motherboard. BIOS update didn't help, driver update didn't help.\nWhat I did was created a script that would restart the computer after WOL boot. Restart would, unlike shutdown, work just fine. And after that I was able to shut down without problems.\n\nA: I had this same problem with 100% reproducibility, the first power off after a wake-on-lan power on would result in an immediate and undesired re-power on. But only one.\nI tried lots of suggestions, even using Realtek's own kernel driver, but nothing worked.

So that I can for example type 'cd an/' and that it already suggests the rest of the path because I've used it so much the past month.\nI did find something called Bash Smart Complete. But that is a little \"dumb\" in that it doesn't look at the commands I used before. I just also found this SO answer, which suggests putting the commands I use a lot in a file. That however, is not responsive enough in that I would need to create a new file for it every time I start new projects or change folders or program arguments.\nDoes anybody know any other utility or other way to achieve this? Or, would anybody know how I could alter the Bash Smart Complete so that it can look at the commands I used in say the past month and complete the command which fits and has been used the most in the past month?\n[EDIT]\nBelow are some really great answers. I haven  marked any as a definite answer yet. Not because I do not like the answers, I do, but because none of them is an absolute winner. I think the Finalterm is a great project. Unfortunately it is still rather rough around the edges. For example; it doesn't support copy-paste yet. I would keep on eye on that project though, because when it will mature I think it'll be a great terminal app. As for the other answers; they either suggested creating an alias, which is not what I want to do because it creates extra work instead of taking work away, or using Ctrl+R, which is a brilliant (I didn't know about it!). A couple of people suggested using Ctrl+R, so I can't really highlight one answer over the other.\nSo for now I am definitely using Ctrl+R, and in the future I might use Finalterm.\nThanks for all the great answers guys!\n\nA: Final Term\nThere is this very promising Terminal App Called Final Term. Among its many features, it also has a history of remebering commands, so that you can then select it. Here are some more features:\n\nYou can read more about it in this article.\nHere is the the website from the creators. http://finalterm.org/\nTo Install it\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:versable/finalterm-daily\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install finalterm\n\nWarning\nI have said that it is promising. The only issue is that it is at version 0.1. So some things like vim and nano don't work well yet. I have also noticed that it does not yet support Drag-and-Drop, and copy and paste. But it does have the feature you request. As the software matures, it will become one of the best terminals for the desktop.\nScreenshot\nHere is the function in action:\n\nHope this helps.\n*I am on Saucy, so that is why I have a Salamander background :)\n\nA: Paste (Ctrl-Shift-V) the following into a terminal screen:\necho '\"\\e[A\": history-search-backward' > ~/.inputrc\necho '\"\\e[B\": history-search-forward' >> ~/.inputrc\necho 'set show-all-if-ambiguous on' >> ~/.inputrc\necho 'set completion-ignore-case on' >> ~/.inputrc\n\nExit (Ctrl-D) the terminal screen, then open Terminal again.\nNow you can just type the first couple of characters, then press Up or Down to scroll through the filtered list\n\nA: Use an alias for your whole command, or add the directory into your $PATH. Additionally, you don't have to change directories to where your executable (or script, or whatever) is to run it, so it's fairly simple. Both methods require you to restart the terminal you're using before the changes take effect.\nHere's how to create a bash alias for your example (add the following line to your ~/.bashrc file):\nalias runmyproject='an/extremely/long/path/in/which/I/have/some/kinda/project/runmyproject --with some --command line --options set'\n\nThis way, all you need to do is input runmyproject into terminal wherever you are, without having to specify options/arguments.\nAlternatively, you could add your project path into your $PATH environment variable. To do so, add the following lines into your ~/.bashrc file:\nPATH=an/extremely/long/path/in/which/I/have/some/kinda/project:$PATH\nexport PATH\n\nIn this case you'll still need to specify your options/arguments for your executable when running it.\n\nA: When I find myself frequently having to change to a directory like this:\ncd an/extremely/long/path/in/which/I/have/some/kinda/project\n\nI would just do this once:\nln -s an/extremely/long/path/in/which/I/have/some/kinda/project ~/project\n\nAnd from then on, use:\ncd ~/pr[tab]\n\nWhen it comes to:\n./runmyproject --with some --command line --options set\n\nI would use the bash history search. At the command prompt just press Ctrl-R and type 'runmy'. Voila, the whole command with all the options as it was last entered is right there to be re-entered. If I didn't like the options I used the last time and wanted to look at the earlier commands, I'd keep pressing Ctrl-R to cycle through all the previous commands that contained \"runmy\". \nThe Ctrl-R history search could help with the 'cd' command too, if you don't like the symlink idea. [Ctrl-R]/proj is really likely to bring back the last command you used to  cd to that directory. \nRather than adding an alias or switching to a special shell, I always prefer to learn to use the bash features designed to help with this sort of thing. That way I can use the same features on remote machines or if I have to sit down at a colleague's terminal. \n\nA: hit control + r on your keyboard - it will put you in reverse history mode and you can type the part you know and the whole command will show\nThere are other ways listed here\nhttp://www.talug.org/events/20030709/cmdline_history.html\nI tend to use control R the most though\n\nA: Try this... This works for all commands in your history file... is the same thing as Ctrl+R, but I think that is more intuitive :)\n\n\n*\n\n*edit /etc/inputrc\nsudo vim /etc/inputrc\n\n\n*uncomment or add this two line\n\"\\e[5~\": history-search-backward\n\n\"\\e[6~\": history-search-forward\n\n\n*logout/login\n\nthen try to write some command listed in history... \nlike...\nls -lah\n\nwrite\nls\n\nand press\nPage Up or Page Dn to navigate trough your history file in search of commands that starts with \"ls\"\nIf you did everything right it should auto-complete your command...\n\nA: If the commands are often used, they are recorded in the command history bash tracks in .bash_history.\nNow the trick: You can reverse search this history to re-execute commands by pressing CTRL-r.\nIn inverse history search mode, bash shows, live, as you type, the most recent command in the history that start with your given input. Then press enter to accept and execute the proposed command. Keep pressing CTRL-R to cycle to older commands with the same prefix.\nThis is builtin in bash, no need for customizing scripts or install software :) It is one of the most useful features of bash, imho.\n", "Q: Re-installing newer Ubuntu- does \"Erase Ubuntu....... and reinstall\" delete grub? I have Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04 with grub providing dual boot. I would like to upgrade the Ubuntu via a re-installation and keep my grub so I can dual boot.\nI am at the point in the installation process where I am presented with the screen:\n\"This computer currently has Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS\".....\nAm I ok selecting \"Erase Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS and reinstall\"? My grub will not get deleted?\n\nA: Since the grub config file is stored on the partitions that you're going to be formatting, yes, your previous GRUB installation will disappear - but as Max said above in comments, it will run update-grub to generate a new menu. It should pick up Windows and any other GRUB entries that the previous Ubuntu installation would have added to the menu.\n", "Q: How to recover files from failed upgrade? I tried to upgrade from 12.04 to 12.10 and am encountering a problem with graphics drivers.\nMy plan is to re-install 12.04.\nBefore I do that, I would like to copy some files from the machine. I'm able to boot successfully from a disk with 12.04, but I can't find my old home directory, as the only user in the home directory is ubuntu. \nI've also tried to ssh into the machine, when it had booted (without graphics) but was unable to.\nIs there a way to get to the old filesystem directory while booting from a CD? Any other suggestions?\n\nA: Running from a live DVD, your normal system partitions and directories are displaced to make way for the live boot and user.\nOn the Xubuntu 13.04 Live DVD that I had handy, your normal disks show as icons along the left edge of the Live screen. You can mount the disk containing your dead (not \"live,\" you know) user's home directory from the icon's contextual menu and find that user somewhere under /media. Obviously your live disc doesn't have that convenience.\nFrom the command line, locate the correct partition perhaps using sudo fdisk -l or lsblk /dev/sda, then mount it. In my case the Live DVD identifies as /dev/sdb, my normal system disk as /dev/sda, and there I have a separate /home partition at /dev/sda6, so\nmount /dev/sda6 /mnt/\n\nmakes my dead user's home directory available from live DVD at /mnt/<user>.\n", "Q: How to change color of top bar in Gnome 3.8 I have updated to ubuntu 13.04 and install gnome 3.8.

So, I want to visit a website that only permits access to computers from certain ip domains.  My ip is not from one of the allowed domains, but I've ssh'd into a (linux) machine at another location that is at one of the allowed domains.\n\nHow do I launch a web browser on my local machine that visits websites through the ip of the remote machine?\n\n\nA: The SSH tunneling in Clemens' answer will work for one specific website, with caveats... if the site does virtual hosting, where the content depends on your HTTP request pointing at a specific hostname, simple port tunneling won't work. And it will only get you to the one site. \nA more robust solution is to use OpenSSH dynamic port forwarding. The command would be:\nssh -D 1080 ssh-server.example.com\n\nNext, set the browser on your client to use a SOCKS proxy at 127.0.0.1, port 1080.\nNow, regardless of which site you're visiting, all of your browsing activity (including DNS lookups) will use the remote server. \nMore detail is here: SSH/OpenSSH/PortForwarding: Dynamic Port Forwarding\nIf you need to switch frequently between browsing normally and browsing through the remote SSH server, look into installing a plugin for your browser to do fast proxy switching. There are a lot of them. \n\nA: You can use SSH tunneling to build a TCP tunnel from your Client to the SSH server and route your traffic through this tunnel.\nIf your private IP on the SSH server Side that you want to access is 192.0.2.1 and your ssh server is ssh.example.com, you can use a SSH command like this:\nssh -L 8080:192.0.2.1:80 ssh.example.com\nWhen this ssh connection is established you can point your local browser to http://localhost:8080 and you should see the page that you would have seen when browsing to http://192.0.2.1 in the private net.\n", "Q: How do I install three desktops?

I'm having trouble getting this to wake on LAN (WoL).  I'm now pretty certain I've narrowed this down to an issue with Ubuntu or the way it's configured.  \nThe reason I say this is that if I boot the box from an Ubuntu Desktop 12.04 install disk, go into \"try now\" and then shut down the machine will wake on lan.\nAccording to this link: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WakeOnLan - the command sudo ethtool eth0 should show Wake-on: g if the card is set up to wake on lan and only require ethtool -s eth0 wol g if this shows the d flag.

I dont see anything in the syslog which looks useful (but I wouldn't know what to look for) and the only point at which it becomes evident that WoL is not working is when the machine is switched off!\nHow can I go about debugging why Ubuntu Server 12.04 is not correctly enabling WoL?

How can I change it so that the shutdown command is also saved, so I don't have type it each time? (I prefer using the terminal to the GUI.)\n\nA: More accurately, your shell (bash, by default) preserves the command history. It's not a function of the terminal app, gnu screen, or byobu. They all run bash, so they all share a bash history. \nI don't see the behavior you're describing. My sudo shutdown ... commands seem to be preserved fine. \nSome reasons you might not see a command in your bash history - \n\n\n*\n\n*when you enter a command with spaces at the very beginning of the line, it's not kept in the history (assuming your $HISTCONTROL contains \"ignorespace\" or \"ignoreboth\")\n\n*the HISTIGNORE variable defines patterns to be excluded from the history. A cautious admin might add 'shutdown' as a string to exclude, to avoid accidentally shutting down a system with a mistaken history invocation. \n\n*The history is written to disk (~/.bash_history) when the shell exits. If the shell is ended abnormally (e.g. segfault, power loss, etc) then your history for that session won't be saved. (During shutdown the shell is typically killed normally and writes its history.)\n\n\nMore details can be found here: Bash Reference Manual: Bash History Facilities\n", "Q: Use of relative path to a local file for bookmarks in Firefox For Ubuntu 12.04 using Firefox 21.0,\nsay I have a local .html file, test.html, in my home directory, which I want to add to the bookmarks menu.. \n\n\n*\n\n*First I use \"Open File\" and then choose the file from file selection dialog, \n\n*Then I press CTRL+D to save the bookmark \n\n*Then I move to the bookmarks side bar, and right click on the bookmark, and choose \"Properties\" \n\n*From the dialog I can see that the location of the file is \"file:///home/fcihh/test.html\" where \"/home/fcihh/\" is my home directory.\n\n\nThe problem is that it uses an absolute path to the home directory.

I am attempting to create a 4GB partition on my Ubuntu boot partition. Under Gparted it says I have 26.19gb of unused space, how do I create a 4gb partition from this? The resize option is greyed out, and I'm worried if I unmount it that I won't have an OS.\n\nA: You will have to resize the partition in order to create a new one, but because your system uses that partition, you can't resize it while you are booted into your system.\nMake a Live USB/DVD (Like the one that you used to install Ubuntu), and boot onto that. Once you are on the live system, you can make changes to your partitions.\nThere is no safe way to resize your partition while you are booted into the system.\n", "Q: Run Win 16-bit Application in Wine Xubuntu 12.04. HP Compaq nc8430. 2 GB RAM. Wine 1.4.\nI'm trying to run Castle of the Winds, an old 16-bit Windows application, in Wine. I've put the application in .wine/drive_c. I've added it as an application in Wine, and I've tried setting the Windows version to 3.1, and I've also tried Win XP. Each time I try to run the app, Xubuntu freezes. I can do a Ctl-Alt-F4, and then a Ctl-Alt-Del to reboot. This application is not a DOS application, so I don't think DOSbox will help. \nAny ideas?\n\nA: Updated answer for 2020-2021\nHere are the steps to run this 16-bit App:\n\n*\n\n*sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\n\n*wget -nc https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/winehq.key\n\n*sudo apt-key add winehq.key\n\n*sudo add-apt-repository 'deb https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/ubuntu/ focal main' I am using 20.04, but change focal to groovy if you are using 20.10.\n\n*sudo apt install --install-recommends winehq-devel Change winehq-devel to winehq-stable if you would like to use the stable version instead\n\n*Run winecfg once so it installs all required packages to work correctly like gecko. In some cases as mentioned below, it would be needed to set the Windows version to XP.\n\n*Visit the Castle in the Wind folder. For me it showed both versions inside of it:\n\n\n\n\n*Go to Castle1 for example and on the terminal type wine CASTLE1.EXE to begin\n\n\nFor Castle2, type wine CASTLE2.EXE in the terminal, inside this folder to play it\n\nNOTES\n\n*\n\n*I am playing in Ubuntu 20.04\n\n*I did not install any additional packages via winetricks.\n\n*There are less steps to do now with the latest wine version, which at this time is Wine 6.0-rc3\n\n*There was no need to changing the Window version inside winecfg since it worked with Windows XP, 7, 8 and 10 (In my case). The default one was windows 7, which is the one used for this test. But as noted by Adrian, he needed Windows XP (Like the previous version of this answer) to make it work.\n\n", "Q: Google Chrome Launcher Not Installed on Unity Bar I installed Ubuntu 12.04 today.

I was informed that it had installed successfully. Still no icon. I use g.mail so the Chrome Browser is important to me. \n\nA: Google Chrome is not included in the Ubuntu Repositories.\nThe closest equivalent is chromium-browser, which can be installed easily using the software center, if it is not yet installed on your system.\n\nHowever, this will NOT install a launcher to the Unity bar for that program, because only Firefox is included \"by default\" in Ubuntu.\nYou need to lock alternate browsers to there manually.\nFirst, run the web browser by going to the dash (first button on Unity), and type in the browser name.\nSecond, click the icon for the browser.\nThird, after the browser opens, right-click the new icon on the unity bar, and choose \"Lock to Launcher\"\nBoom, new launcher for that browser.\n", "Q: How can I keep a full-screen Chrome Flash player when Chrome loses focus? 13.04 When I use a Flash video that has a full-screen function, I would like to be able to allow another program to get focus and have the Flash video stay full-screen. \nI'm using Chrome  27.0.1453.110 with Adobe's implementation of Flash 11.2. I'm using 11.2 because the primary purpose of using Flash is Amazon's Instant Video. \nCurrently, whenever another program gains focus, the Flash full-screen restores back to what it was before. Is there any way to change this behavior? \n\nA: This does not answer it, but my my workaround it is the zoom in to the video. \nYou can zoom in on the web page by hitting \"Ctrl+++ on your keyboard. Likewise, you can zoom out by doing Ctrl+--.\nI am curious to see if other people have any workarounds/Hacks.\nHope this helped.\n\nA: Try this plugin for Chrome. It allows you to resize a webpage flash element to fit the Chrome window size, on the same page or in a new tab.\n\nA: After being annoyed at this problem myself, and not liking how many of the extensions to accomplish this objective are so flaky or don't work on all sites, I've made my own extension.\nhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/maximize-flash/chihjmmmhbapnhemoopibkekbojilhge?hl=en\nWhen you click on the icon it will maximize/restore the original size to the biggest flash object on the page.\nSome things that this extension does that others don't are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Will keep playing the item inline where it is in the DOM, meaning that the video won't reload.

Ubuntu! is pretty close.\n\nA: The Ubuntu wallpapers from older releases can be installed from the Software Center, but I guess you want the 13.04 wallpapers and have installed an earlier Ubuntu release (perhaps 12.04 LTS?).\nWell, simply go to http://packages.ubuntu.com/raring/ubuntu-wallpapers and, from the right-hand panel, select the link [ubuntu-wallpapers_13.04.0daily13.03.20.orig.tar.gz] under \"Download Source Package ubuntu-wallpapers:\".\nThis will download a 26MiB file containing all wallpapers from release 9.10 to date, including the default wallpaper under the name warty-final-ubuntu.png. Note that this seems to be a .jpg file with .png extension.\n\nA: You can install old Ubuntu wallpapers using installing the ubuntu-wallpapers-(version) package.

I am an IBM System i Administrator; but have extensive PC experience in the Windows world; but, very little Linux knowledge at this point.  I have an eMachines Model ET6141-D2W Desktop that had Windows Vista (2.00 Ghz Processor, 2GB RAM, 288GB HD.  The boot sector became corrupted; so, it no longer boots into Windows; but, I can place it into a SATA docking station, and still access all the data; i.e., my pics, docs, etc., which I have backed up to DVDs.  I want to install Ubuntu 12.04.02 Desktop on it; but when I try to boot from the DVD I burned from the ubuntu-12.04.02-desktop-i386.iso, it just keeps recycling; i.e., goes through the motions, but never boots from the DVD, even though I changed the boot order to boot from DVD drive first.  What am I doing wrong?  I just downloaded InfraRecorder, and am downloading the iso again, and will use InfraRecorder to burn to DVD.  I'm thinking the iso didn't burn properly when I first tried using Windows Vista Burn program.\nOn another note: The ubuntu-12.04.02-desktop-i386.iso says it's 693MB; but when I tried to burn it to a CD-RW 700MB disk, it said it required 727MB available.  I have a couple of other older PCs I'd like to play around with installing ubuntu on; but, they only have CD-ROM drives, not DVDs.  How can I get the 12.04.02-desktop iso to fit on a CD, or is that not possible?\nThanx in advance for the help.\n\nA: Some older machines do not 'honor' the boot order settings.\nKeep trying, and try the 'manual boot' method of choosing the boot device. This usually resolves the problem.\n\nI strongly suggest using a 2GB USB device as the install media.\nSee: How do I burn the Ubuntu ISO to a CD?\nBasically, when 12.10 was released, it no longer would fit on a CD (without some non-standard compression / format workaround). And, 12.04.2 in newer still.\nNote: On my PC the ubuntu-12.04.02-desktop-i386.iso file is 727.0 MB.

I am a novice linux/Ubuntu user who is just discovering the joys of a lightweight, free software environment which gives control to the user. \nTo protect some of my data (photos) from the rigours of OS crashes/reinstallation etc. I have created a small storage partition on my primary hard disk using gparted at /dev/sda3 using the ext4 filesystem. \nOn startup the partition auto-mounts to /media/chris/photo storage. I can see the drive at this location, and in the Unity launcher. \nThe only problem is I have no permissions to use the 'drive' and hence cannot copy files into it, add folders or in fact do anything in the storage area. My question is how to I give myself permissions within my normal Ubuntu account to use it?\nBest Regards, \nChris\n\nA: I found the the solution:\nsudo chown -R chris /media/chris/Photo_Storage\n\n(note - i had to change the partition name to make it work in terminal).\n...or, more generally:\nsudo chown -R myname.myname /media/data/\n\nFor those that don't know, sudo gives you root access on the next command. chown gives folder ownership to the named account. \n\nA: Try this.  Just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo chmod u+w /media/chris/photo storage\n\n\nA: The best way to go is through your terminal. The first answer should work fine for you. All in all, being new to Linux, you need to understand file system hierarchy and how all works. Most things won't be achieved using the GUI, the power of Linux is inside the CLI. I had same issues once upon a time. Note what works for you.\nIf you are doing something and not working out, use your sudo. It is like a command from a president.\nsudo chmod works for some and chown works too, then make your file be executable by user. You need to read up on that too. I will advice you watch Joe Collins on YouTube.\n$ sudo chmod 777 name_of_partition\n\nI love numbers for execution, you can use letters too like +x.\nYour partition is in a file(folder) called media, that is where all drives are stored, USB and so on.\n", "Q: What ARM tablet can I run regular Ubuntu and XBMC and hook up an external HDD...? I want to run XBMC on an ARM Tablet, using bluetooth keyboard and an external 4TB hard drive to substitute a typical HTPC.\n.\nP.S.: HTPC doesn't exist as a tag... can someone who is not new here create it?\n\nA: You can attach an external HDD to the (officially supported) nexus 7 and 10 and play videos.

There is an XBMC for Android though.\n", "Q: no internet for terminal- connect through a proxy I'm using newly installed 13.04 on my lap. I've connected to wifi connection in our university and configured the proxy settings in network settings. I can access web and even software updater work nicely, but using the terminal I even can't ping into a website. \"ping google.com\" gives 100% packet loss  \n\nA: I had the same issues with the network at my university as well.\nI believe that there is nothing wrong with your machine or the proxy server.\nThe problem is that the network admins block certain protocols and ports and only allow you to perform specific operations.\nIn your example, 'ping' doesn't work but lets say if you try 'ssh', you may have no issues at all.\n\nA: for me the following worked in our company network with proxy:\ncd /etc/apt\nmv ./apt.conf ./apt.conf.bak\n\nthis is to force the system to use the new file we create now.\ncd ./etc/apt/apt.conf.d\n\ncreate new file \"95proxies\" and add there the content of the apt.conf file\nExample:\nAcquire::http::Proxy “http://proxy_url:proxy_port/”;\nAcquire::ftp::Proxy “http://proxy_url:proxy_port/”;\n\nnow the system use the 95proxies file\nTry\nsudo apt-get update\n\nthis should work now\n\nA: If you use a proxy server, and want to access the Web through Terminal, you need to export the proxy variables.  \nTo do that, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nbash -c export http_proxy='http://proxy_username:password@proxy_ip:port/' \n\nMake sure you replace proxy_username, and password, with your information.\nAnother way is to: (from terminal)\ncd etc/apt\nsudo gedit apt.conf\n\nThis will open an empty document, just add the lines below, and save it\nAcquire::http::Proxy “http://proxy_url:proxy_port/”;\nAcquire::ftp::Proxy “http://proxy_url:proxy_port/”;\n\n", "Q: Grub error after removing partition So I think I've possibly done something pretty dumb. Basically I was running out of space on my ubuntu partition and I knew i had a 40GB partition at the end of the disk which was called OS2. \nI'm 99% sure this was one I created years ago when I first had the idea of dualbooting my computer (long before I actually got around to doing it) and I double checked on the drive, there was nothing on it.\nSo I installed GParted live USB, ran it, formatted the NTFS OS2 partition into ext2 format and rebooted computer.\nNow I get the following error from grub:\nerror: file '/boot/grub/i386-pc/normal.mod' not found.\ngrub rescue>\n\nObviously the \"grub rescue\" bit is a command prompt, but other than that, there's nothing I can do with the computer. \nWhat can I do to get my computer back? \nMany thanks!\nLuke\n\nA: Whenever my GRUB breaks, I do the following to reinstall GRUB:\nPrepare a bootable USB Stick (e.g. with unetbootin) with the current Ubuntu image or burn a DVD. Now boot from it into a live system and open a terminal. Then type\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\nsudo grub-update\n\nThis assumes /dev/sda is your primary hard drive and you want to install GRUB there ;). Afterwards you should have a working GRUB again.\nNote: Sometimes GRUB fails to detect other operating systems. Mount the relevant partitions with Nautilus by simply clicking on them, if they don't show up in terminal, while executing grub-update.\n", "Q: \"sh: 1: cannot open /tmp/pdfsandwich4e375e.html: No such file\" when using pdfsandwitch I tried to add a textlayer to some pdf files in order to make them searchable. This technique is explained in the german Ubuntu wiki: http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/pdfsandwich .\nAfter installing dependencies \nsudo apt-get install imagemagick exactimage ghostscript tesseract-ocr\n\nand pdfsandwich itself it should be as simple as\npdfsandwich test.pdf\n\nHowever I get: \nInput file: \"test.pdf\"\nOutput file: \"test_ocr.pdf\"\nNumber of pages in inputfile: 272\n\nParallel processing with 8 threads started.\nProcessing page order may differ from original page order.\n\nProcessing page 137.\nProcessing page 171.\nProcessing page 1.\nPProcessing page Processing pProcessing page rocess35.\nage 239.\nProcessing page 69.\n205.\ning page 103.\nsh: 1: cannot open /tmp/pdfsandwich4e375e.html: No such file\n\nfollowed by many more cannot open ... warnings. Inspection of my /tmpdirectory shows that instead of these *.html files the corresponding *.txt files exist. Seemingly tesseract does not output in hocr format. I read the man pages of tesseract and tried to enforce hocr output by creating a config file named tesseract-config\nhocr true\n\n(I tried various variations thereof) and starting pdfsandwich with\npdfsandwich -tesso tesseract-config test.pdf\n\nBut this does not seem to change anything. Any ideas how I can make pdfsandwich produce proper output?\nNote the related questions How to add OCRed text to original pdf in gscan2pdf? and Adding OCR info to a PDF . However I need to process many pdf files and therefore I need a command-line solution which I can automate.\n\nA: It turned out that the format of the config file changed with the present ubuntu version of tesseract (3.02.01): http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/source/browse/trunk/tessdata/configs/hocr?r=526 . Tesseract can now be instructed to output in hocr format with a single line configuration file tesseract-config:\ntessedit_create_hocr 1\n\nAs noted in the question, tesseract can be instructed to read the config file by passing the -tesso option to pdfsandwich:\npdfsandwich -tesso tesseract-config test.pdf\n\n\nA: The reason for this error is that tesseract changed its default file extensions for hocr, making it incompatible with pdfsandwich <0.1.0. For tesseract 3.02 with pdfsandwich <0.1.0, it helps to modify the tesseract option file and to pass it to pdfsandwich with -tesso.\nTesseract 3.03, which is the default tesseract version in Ubuntu 14.04, substantially changed its hocr handling, making it partially incompatible with hocr2pdf, so that the \"-tesso\" fix will often result in text layers which do not fit to the scanned images. Instead, not hocr2pdf but tesseract itself needs to be used to produce each single page of pdf files.\nPdfsandwich >=0.1.0 automatically recognizes the tesseract version and chooses the appropriate way of interaction with tesseract, so that all these errors do not occur anymore.\n", "Q: ubuntu 12.04 installation alongside windows 7 I want to install Ubuntu 12.04 alongside windows 7.

The fix for me is as follows:\nPlug your headphones in, and then open a terminal with ctrl+alt+T. Run alsamixer. Move to the right so that the \"speaker\" column (which will be at 0) is highlighted, and then turn it up.\nI wish I could offer a more permanent solution (because goodness knows I'd love to know of one too), but this will at least work to get it working (it will continue to work even if you unplug/replug the headphones, but you will have to do it again every time you restart - and probably if you log out and in again, I haven't tested this for myself though)\n", "Q: Large amount of scrollable text in Ubuntu touch Is there a way to make a label scrollable in ubuntu touch sdk.

I am using ubuntu 12.10.\nI use a ZTE USB 3G Modem to connect to internet. I connect that modem through a driver software which was provided with the modem. This modem works fine. I can browse , use apt-get through terminal.\nBut the problem is network-manager cant detect my modem. It shows nothing in the top bar. Because of this I - \n\n\n*\n\n*Can't use Ubuntu Software Center\n\n*Can't use VPN services\n\n*Can't create wifi hotspot\n\n\nFirst of all i am telling what i have noticed about this modem:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I connect this modem first time that driver software can't detect it. This time ' lsusb ' command give this lsusb(before) . After unplugging and plugging for 2-3 times that software can detect modem and output of lsusb changed to lsusb(new). And ths time ubuntu also find a cd-rom by which driver software is delivered. But if i connect modem before starting Ubuntu that driver software can detect modem at first time!!\n\n*I have tried to connect this modem through ' Mobile Broadband ' option but unfortunately this option can't detect my modem under ' create a connection for this mobile broadband device ' option.\n\n*I think that driver software use wvdial to connect to the internet as I have to install wvdial before installing that software. I have tried to connect to internet using wvdial from terminal. wvdial works fine. And I can use internet. But can't solve network-manager problem.\n\n*Also used sakis3g. sakis3g can connect my modem but this also can't solve the network-manager problem.\n\n\nNow I am telling what I have done till now to solve that network-manager problem:\nI have tried this code with root privilege:\necho vendor productID > /sys/bus/usb-serial/drivers/option1/new_id\n\nIt didn't work.\nOne more thing its confusing what will be my productID for this code 0154(which lsusb finds before modem gets detected by driver software)? or 2003(which lsusb finds after modem gets detected by driver software and find a cd-rom)?\nI think usb_modeswitch can help me solving this problem but i don't know how to use usb_modeswitch or create configuration file with it.\nThats all. Now my question is whats wrong? Is there any solution to get my modem detected by network-manager?\n\nA: [Answering My Own Question]\n[First of all Apology! I am not an expert here. But I think may be I can share what I have learned through experience]\nMy first problem was when I was connecting the modem through driver software provided with the modem I was unable to use some network services like VPN, Ubuntu Software Centre etc. It was happening because though I was connected to the internet Network Manager couldn't detect it.\nProblem: Network Manager can't detect internet connection.\nReason: The driver provided with the modem was using WvDial to connect to the internet. But because of this bug in wvdial package, Network Manager couldn't detect network connection.\nSolution: If your driver software use wvdial don't use it. Connect the modem as a mobile broadband connection instead.\n\nNow I have mentioned in my question that I had also tried to connect my modem through mobile broadband connection. But failed as I couldn't find my modem in the mobile broadband option.\nProblem: Mobile Broadband can't detect my modem\nReason: First of all lets take a look how these modems work. When these modems are plugged for the first time, operating system detect them as a storage medium / CD-ROM rather than a modem. So that the driver software provided with the modem can be delivered. After installing the driver, driver sends a special message to the modem. After getting that message modem switches to modem mode. And now its ready to use. This feature of these modems is called ZeroCD(TM) feature. This mechanism is used so that drivers can be delivered with the modem without the need of any additional CD/DVD.\nIn my question I have mentioned that when I would plug my modem my driver software couldn't detect it and I would get a set of vendor and product id(in my case 19d2 and 0154) in lsusb command. After some sequence of plugging & unplugging product id would switch to 2003 and now the driver could detect the modem. This was happening because of this ZeroCD feature of the modem. First the modem is detected as a storage medium and the product id becomes 0154. Then the modem switches to modem mode and product id becomes 2003. This mechanism is called modem switching.\nFor the same reason mobile broadband couldn't detect my modem. So to solve this problem I have to switch the modem to modem mode somehow. And to switch I need some configuration information like that special message I have mentioned earlier, vendor id, product id etc.\nActually there is a nice software package named usb_modeswitch which handle this switching thing automatically. And Ubuntu by default comes with this software package. Now how usb_modeswitch does this is, it reads a file(called data file) named configPack.tar.gz located in /usr/share/usb_modeswitch directory which contains configuration information needed to switch this kind of modems. If your modem's configuration information is present in that file your modem should switch automatically by usb_modeswitch without any problem. But if not you are in trouble.\nSolution: Download usb_modeswitch(If its not already installed in your system) and latest data file from this site. Now it may happen that your modem's data file is not present in the latest data file. In that case you can wait until someone includes it there for you or you can find those information by yourself and inform the developers of usb_modeswitch. May be they will include your modem's configuration information in their later release. After all someone has to do it! You will find information regarding this in the above site.\n\nA: The basic problem seems that the usb_modeswitch package distributed with ubuntu is an older version, so that many of the new USB modems are not detected.\nI had the same problem - the dialler worked and the modem was usable, but the network manager did not detect the modem and so no VPN. \nI uninstalled the driver and then USB CD drive is detected if the modem is plugged in on restart, else the ID(19d2:0154) is shown in lsusb, but no storage device is mounted. In both cases i was able to do 'eject /dev/sr1' to switch the device to modem (19d2:2003) and  the network manager detects the mobile broadband connection but disconnects after about ten minutes.\nThen i updated the usb_modeswitch package for the latest and i am able to use the modem on plugin as well as on reboot.\n", "Q: Convert Ubuntu Physical machine to Virtual machine What is the easiest way to convert a physical Ubuntu (v. 16.04 LTS) into a virtual machine? \n\n\n*\n\n*Convert to VMware workstation image or\n\n*VirtualBox image \n\n\nA: You can run Ubuntu in VirtualBox, via raw disk access. It will use a real disk as if it were a virtual disk.\nTo convert the disk into an image, see this answer.\n\nA: You can use VMware vCenter Converter.\nFrom VMWare:\nVMware vCenter Converter can run on a wide variety of hardware, and supports most commonly used versions of the Microsoft Windows and Linux operating systems. \nAutomate and simplify physical to virtual machine conversions as well as conversions between virtual machine formats with VMware vCenter Converter. Use the intuitive wizard-driven interface of VMware vCenter Converter to transform your physical machines to virtual machines.\n\n\n*\n\n*Convert Microsoft Windows and Linux-based physical machines and\nthird-party image formats to VMware virtual machines.\n\n*Complete multiple conversions simultaneously with a centralized\nmanagement console.\n\n*Minimize the number of steps to conversion with easy-to-use wizards.\n\n\nFor more info, and to download it visit VMWare\n\nA: Unfortunately using VMware vCenter Converter is applicable just for server administrators. As I remember from Vmware documentation, vCenter Converter(linux version) needs four running system including Vmware ESX Server which itself needs at least 8GB of physical memory.\nHere I explain another way for those who have Windows OS beside the linux OS on the same machine. First I give a summery to show the main idea and then I give more details.\n1-In the Windows environment, create a backup of your linux EX4 partition.You can use any available backup software.(Here I used Acronis True Image 2016)\n2-Create a new virtual machine in Vmware and start recovering process using the backup that you've created in previous section.\n3-After doing recovery, you have the same Linux partition in your new virtual machine. Now to enable booting, you need to repair the Linux Grub which is capable of booting your system....And its done!\nSome Details for implementation:\nIn the case of using \"Acronis True Image 2016\", these notes will be helpful.\n1-When your are going to create a new virtual machine in Vmware, you should add \"tow\" hard drives for it.One hard drive must have \"physical\" access to your external HDD which your backup resides there.Another one must be the \"virtual drive\" and must be a little bigger than your Ex4 Linux partition.\n2-For doing recovery process in boot, Acronis Gives you a rescue disk. Use this rescue disk in Vmware and boot the virtual system.\n3-Because the virtual HDD that Vmware gives your is Raw, it is not accessible in Acronis rescue boot menu. So before starting recovery , you must create an EX4 partition from \"add new disk\" menu in rescue disk boot menu.\n4-After doing the recovery process, you will have the exact copy of Linux EX4 partition in your VM.Now For Enable booting, use a Ubuntu live Disk for Repairing boot menu.

I have been using Ubuntu 12.10 as a dual-boot on my primary computer, lately everything has become a bit unstable, Steam games crash often, everything has been slowing down a lot.\nAnyway, my computer came with 64bit Windows, and I had 32bit Ubuntu installed.

I would like to use the Ouya controller with my Ubuntu machine... its a standard Bluetooth controller and when I attempt to pair it with Ubuntu 13.04 the pairing option box prompts me to enter a pairing code.\nNow this is the odd part. The pairing code options dialog in the settings has a few options but none of the setting stick when closing the dialog (there is no ok or apply, just \"Close\").\nSo at the end of the day I am unsure if there is a simple way to pair Bluetooth gamepads in Ubuntu.\nTL;DR: How do I pair a Bluetooth gamepad without a paircode?\n\nA: It appears that the default Bluetooth GUI wasn't designed with gamepads in mind. You can still get your OUYA gamepad working, though. You should be able to use the default Bluetooth GUI (see the other answer) - if for some reason you can't this fallback method also works (with some caveats).\nPre-install\nBefore you start, install bluez-compat (to make the connection with hidd) and joystick-gtk (to test the gamepad) as follows:\nsudo apt install bluez-compat jstest-gtk\n\nScan and connect\nNow press hold down the OUYA button on the controller to make it discoverable. It should start by flashing all four lights, then flash only two lights. Once it is doing this, enter the following command to scan for it:\nhcitool scan\n\nIt should appear as \"OUYA gamepad\" with a long address after it. You can now connect to it with:\nsudo hidd --connect <ADDRESS>\n\n(replace  with the address from the scan).\nConfirm it works\nYou should immediately be able to move the mouse pointer with the OUYA gamepad touchpad. Additionally, a wireless mouse indicator should appear next to the Bluetooth adapter icon.\nFinally, you can confirm that gamepad input is working by running jstest-gtk from the Dash.\n\nDrawbacks with this approach\n\n\n*\n\n*bluez-compat is self-described as being a legacy package. \"These binaries are not supported, and will go away again in the future.\" It would be ideal to use a more modern package.\n\n*Because we use sudo to connect, a lock icon appears on the Bluetooth indicator. (Does this have any effect?)\n\n*The gamepad is not permanently added to the list of Bluetooth devices, and is autodiscoverable (e.g. next time you reboot, you can't just make the controller discoverable again, you have to repeat the scan and connect process).\n\n*Using the default Bluetooth GUI does not have any of these drawbacks.\n\n\nA: You need to treat the gamepad as any other Bluetooth pointer device with a dummy PIN of \"0000\". When connecting for the first time:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold down the OUYA button on the controller to make it discoverable. It should start by flashing all four lights, then flash only two lights.\n\n*Once it is doing this, click on the Bluetooth indicator and select \"Bluetooth Settings...\"\n\n*Wait for the device search to complete\n\n*Select the gamepad from the list\n\n*Click \"PIN options...\"\n\n*In the new window pick \"0000\" from the fixed PIN list, then click \"Close\"\n\n*In the Bluetooth New Device Setup window, click \"Continue\"\n\n\nThe gamepad should now be available. You can confirm it works as described in the other answer.\nThe device will appear permanently under the Bluetooth indicator, even when it is not around. When you want to connect it subsequently:\n\n\n*\n\n*Activate the gamepad\n\n*Click on the Bluetooth indicator and hover over \"OUYA Game Controller\"\n\n*Drag the connection from \"Off\" to \"On\"\n\n\nImprovements from the other answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*no extra (old) dependencies\n\n*the Bluetooth indicator does not get a lock symbol\n\n", "Q: Package ignore when running apt-get update I'm trying to install Centrify Express on Ubuntu Server 12.04.

The other day I installed Ubuntu (unity) 12.10 on a small partition on my laptop as I needed to test something out. My data from the kubuntu install is intact, but strangely bundled up and I am not familiar with what's going on. A picture speaks 1000 words, here is my Kubuntu install in Nautilus:\n\nCan anyone tell me what's going on and if there is a way to restore my Kubuntu install? The Quantal install is unimportant to me as it's served its purpose.\n\nA: It looks as if grub of Quantal installation is dominating your whole installation ?\nYou have to find out the partition of Quantal and the partition of Kubuntu.\nThen it is your choice with which Linux-Installation you want to boot and login\nthere with concerning login-display-manager.\nHere is an example, where is described how to re-install grub into correct partition :\nhttp://dailyblogged.com/1028/booting-ubuntu-with-the-chameleon-bootloader/\nIn the end you would only have to know, which distribution you want to deal with as the\ndistribution to log in with.\nKubuntu is not lost - it is still present there. It looks only as if Kubuntu and Quantal in your machine have used the same MBR.\n\nA: I managed to solve this. \nIt was indeed a boot issue, and my 13.04 Kubuntu install was intact. The structure of my Kubuntu install pictured above is because I am using the BTRFS (Butter FS) filesystem, which uses subvolumes. Rescatux which would be my standard way of fixing a boot issue was not recognising this partition as an install, and advice like the excellent http://dedoimedo.com/computers/grub-2.html#mozTocId905459 does not include provisions for installs on BTRFS. So I will give the fix below.\nYou will need a working linux system on this PC. I used my Ubuntu 12.10 install, but you can also use a live distribution from a DVD or USB. Start a terminal (eg. Alt+F2 and type konsole on Kubuntu, or type gnome-terminal and click on the terminal icon in Dash on regular Ubuntu).\nYou will need to locate what partition your non-booting installation is on. First get administrative privileges for the rest of this session by entering\nsudo su\n\nFind your linux partitions by entering\nmount\n\nwhich will show you which partitions are 'linux'. For me this was /dev/sda6, /dev/sda7 and /dev/sda8. You can determine which one is btrfs by using\nblkid /dev/sda6\n\nfor each of the linux partitions listed. If you have multiple btrfs partitions listed I would suggest mounting all of them and listing the contents to determine which is the one you are looking for. I have only one which was /dev/sda6, replace /dev/sda6 in the steps below with the partition your non-booting install is on. Mount the partition:\nmount /dev/sda6 /mnt/\n\nyou can now use grub-install to set grub to use your missing install, which should fix any issues. The trick here is to use the subvolume '@' as your root directory.\ngrub-install --root-directory=/mnt/@ /dev/sda\n\nThe second argument, /dev/sda is which hard drive to put the master boot record on. If you have multiple drives, you will have to put the right device here (which is the device your BIOS is configured to try and boot from). You can reboot and your system should be fixed.\nreboot\n\nNow while your machine is rebooting, click your heels 3 times, and say 'there's no place like /home, there's no place like /home, there's no place like /home'.*\n*optional\n", "Q: ASUS: K55V series Laptop dual boot problem I have LAPTOP ASUS K55V (Windows 7 Home 64bit)\n(I'd like to dual boot with Ubuntu)\nI read all the tutorials about install Ubuntu, here's what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installed old version \n(problem: There some some Windows partitions and I can format some of them)\n(Backtrack 5R3 won't boot)\n\n*I download the latest Ubuntu.

I used easyBCD to choose between linux mint and windows 7 before the switch. I now have it set up for a dual boot. When the installation was finished, I logged into windows and updated the boot information in easyBCD. I deleted the Linux Mint option, and added Ubuntu. When I restarted my computer, my options were Linux Mint and Ubuntu, both of which bring me to the Ubuntu GRUB loader. \nEasyBCD deleted the wrong option, and now I can't get back into Windows. If I choose \"Ubuntu,\" it takes me to the GRUB loader, and the Windows 7 option at the bottom of that just throws me back to the easyBCD menu.

Anyway I'm just too scared of doing something wrong at this level, so here is the situation: \nWhat happened\nI had an iMac with rEFIt installed and a dual boot with Ubuntu 12.04. I went on Mac, and decided to free some space for Ubuntu, so I just shrunk the Mac partition cutting off 30Gb at the end (free space), that's ALL, and all was well. At least that's what I thought..\nWhat's the current situation\nNow I can still boot on Mac, but when I try to boot on Ubuntu I get a error: unknown filesystem with the grub rescue> prompt. I followed what I read on the forum to boot on Ubuntu:\nset root=(hd0,3)\nset prefix=(hd0,3)/boot/grub\ninsmod normal\nnormal\n\nand this works well, but it's not a long term solution. I heard about BootRepair, but I'm on Mac, and from what I've seen, all the options of this software are for MBR, not EFI...\nMy opinion\nFrom what I understand I need to tell EFI where to \"redirect the bootloader\" when I select the linux option in the rEFIt menu. Can't I do that from OSx directly? Or is it just grub that's messed up? If I have to use a liveUSB, please explain me what to do as if I was dumb, I really don't want to mess things up more... :S\n\nA: There are a number of possible solutions, but it's hard to say what will work best, since it's unclear how Linux is installed (BIOS mode or EFI mode), although my guess is you've got a BIOS-mode installation.\nOne possible quick fix is to run update-grub within Ubuntu. If successful, this will update the GRUB files, thus restoring it to proper functionality. If unsuccessful, though, this could make matters worse, possibly making it impossible to boot Linux in the way you're doing it now.\nAnother option is a bit more complex, and is more likely to work, but is still not without risks:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Linux, type df / and take note of the device filename associated with /. It's probably /dev/sda3, /dev/sda4, or some other numbered partition.\n\n*In OS X, download and install rEFInd.\n\n*In OS X, install the EFI filesystem driver for whatever filesystem you use on your Linux root (/) filesystem (or on /boot, if it's separate). rEFInd ships with drivers for ext2/3fs, ext4fs, and ReiserFS. You install a filesystem driver by copying it to the drivers or drivers_x64 subdirectory of the rEFInd installation directory (normally /EFI/refind).\n\n*Reboot. rEFInd should appear.\n\n*Highlight one of the vmlinuz-{version} options on the menu and hit F2 or Insert twice. This should open a simple line editor.\n\n*Add ro root=/dev/sda3 to the options, changing /dev/sda3 to the partition you identified in the first step.\n\n*Hit Enter. Linux should boot.\n\n*Locate the mkrlconf.sh script that came with rEFInd and run it. This should create a file called /boot/refind_linux.conf, which will obviate the need to add kernel options (steps 5-6) when you boot Linux the next time; just hitting Enter should do the trick.\n\n\nThis procedure bypasses GRUB and is likely to be more robust than GRUB in the long term; however, some Macs don't work well when booted directly in EFI mode (as this solution does), so it's conceivable that it won't be an acceptable option for you. If so, you'll need to get a BIOS-mode version of GRUB (or some other boot loader) working. You may also need to clean up your boot menu. Consult the rEFInd documentation for refind.conf, paying particular attention to the dont_scan_dirs, dont_scan_files, and scanfor options, for details on how to do this. Deleting files (such as the refit.efi file) can also do the trick.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcuts with multiple non-modifier keys Is there any way to use a combination of keys such as:\nCtrl+Spc+j\n\nas a shortcut in Ubuntu? Note that the combination above includes two non-modifier keys: Spc and j.\nAs an example, I would like to map use the above combination for \"Move window one workspace to the left\"\n\nA: In order to use more than one non modifier keys in a shortcut your keyboard needs to support n-Key rollover.

My keyboard dropped half the alphabet, so I can't tell you what to do next, sorry :-(\nEdit : I did some research and the only way to achieve something close to what you are looking (that I could find) is autokey.

If you want to keep heirloom-mailx, you can try creating a new configuration file to set the encoding variable to different values, and use the MAILRC environment variable to select the different configuration. Probably some configuration can be found that will just send along the data without any mangling.\nAnother option would be to use the bsd-mailx version of mailx(1) instead, it is less helpful and will just send raw data.\n", "Q: How do I find out what filesystem my partitions are using?

Flashgot can download files from sites like Youtube and such making the other addon unnecessary.\nThe problem is probably to conversion attempt while downloading...it would be much easier to just download the file and convert it after the fact with ffmpeg, winff, audacity, etc.\nYou could also use the site http://video2mp3.net that extracts the audio from a video and the provides a download of said audio.\n", "Q: How to run `gsettings set` in chroot?

But after a successful recovery it prompted to restart the computer which I did. But then after restarting the NTFS partition has input/output errors. I can access some of the folders and file but others disappeared. I was given the option of NTFSFIX but it failed. It gives me the message below:\nMounting volume... OK\nProcessing of $MFT and $MFTMirr completed successfully.\nChecking file system overflow... FAILED\nError: Failed to fix the alternate boot sector\n\n\nA: Depending on the reasons we had to recover a partition it is expected that Testdisk will not recover all of it. We will not be able to revive those parts of the drive which have been overwritten or are damaged otherwise.\nTherefore Testdisk is extremely helpful in recovering those data that are still complete but it may not be able to restore the drive to it's original state if anything was written to it. This is where restoring a backup is the only means we have.\nWhat should  be done now is to backup all important data to an external drive, repartition and format the drive, and then restore the backup. Make sure the backup is complete before you wipe the drive holding your recovered data.\nIn case we are faced with repeated I/O errors on that drive this may indicate a failing disk. Read the output of S.M.A.R.T. data for that drive for more information regarding this. It is then even more important to immediately make a backup of your data, as this drive may fail completely any time and therefore needs to be replaced.\n", "Q: How to install mp3 plugin? I just installed Ubuntu desktop 13.04 in my computer, dual boot with windows 7.\nHow to install mp3 plugin? Because I want to listen to music and watch movie, but the player requires plugin?

When installing a software via dpkg -i packageA.deb, will the dependencies required by packageA be downloaded and installed automatically? How is this different from using apt-get or aptitude?\n\nA: apt-get\nPackage management via apt-get runs hand-in-hand with the /etc/apt/sources.list file. \napt-get install <package_name>\ninstalls a new package onto your computer.\napt-get build-dep <package_name>\nThis command searches the repositories and installs the build dependencies for . If the package is not in the repositories it will return an error.\napt-get install <package1_name> <package2_name> <package3_name>\napt-get allows multiple package installation. separate the packages with a space.\nauto-apt run <command_string>\nWhen invoked, the auto-apt command automatically installs packages upon missing file access. If a program tries to access a file known to belong in an uninstalled package, auto-apt will install that package using apt-get. This feature requires apt and sudo to work.\nVisit the apt-get instruction page\naptitude\naptitude provides the functionality of dselect and apt-get as well as many additional features not found in either program.\naptitude has a shell of its own which is keyboard or mouse activated and runs in a terminal window\naptitude build-dep <package>   - Install the build-dependencies of packages - which means the packages needed to compile (or build) its source package. For example, many packages need debhelper or autotools to be built, but don't need them to run.\nVisit the aptitude instruction page\ndpkg\nis  a  tool to install, build, remove and manage Debian packages. link\ndpkg -i <package.deb> installs a Debian package onto your computer.  It does not install any dependencies as far as I can find out from the help files.\nFor details type dpkg --help into a terminal window.\nGuides\na guide to file management can be found here\n\nA: Although there are great answers to this question I want to say something more detailed.\n\n*\n\n*dpkg (or rpm in Fedora family) is a Low-level tool which\ninstalls and removes package files, it doesn't install the\ndependencies or search it from repositories.\n\n*apt, apt-get and aptitude (or yum and dnf in Fedora family) are High-level - or as it mentioned in first answer a\nfront-end of dpkg! - tools that perform metadata searching and dependency\nresolution.\n\nI like to explain their differences in package management tasks in Linux:\n\n*\n\n*For install, uninstall or updating a package from repositories, I use high level ones(apt-get install, apt-get update, apt-get remove) but for install and upgrade from a package file, I use low level ones(dpkg -i package_file, ).\n\n*For search in repositories, I use high level tool (apt-cache search search_str )\n\n*For checking the installed packages and files I use low level ones\n(dpkg -l or -s or -S for more info check the manual man dpkg | less )\n\n*For package metadata I use high level ones, for example apt-cache show dpkg.\n\n\nA: No, dpkg only installs a package, so doing dpkg -i packageName.deb will only install this Deb package, and will notify you of any dependencies that need to be installed, but it will not install them, and it will not configure the packageName.deb because well...the dependencies are not there.\napt-get is a Package Management System that handles the installation of Deb packages on Debian-based Linux distributions. A Package Management System is a set of tools that will help you install, remove, and change packages easily. So apt-get is like a clever dpkg.\nI like to think of the timeline this way (the following is just me speaking from experience. It is meant to only give you an idea of this whole thing):\n\n*\n\n*They came up with a way to \"store\" the files of an application in a \"package\" so that it can be easily installed. So, the Deb package (.deb extension file) was born.\n\nA .deb file contains the files needed by an application to run, as well as (I like to call it) \"meta-data\" that holds other information, such as the names of the dependencies the application needs. If you want to see the contents of a .deb file, you can use the command dpkg -c packageName.deb, and if you want to see this \"meta-data\" information, use the command dpkg -I pacakgeName.deb (and if you want to only see the dependencies, do dpkg -I packageName.deb | grep Depends).\n\n\n\n*They needed a tool to install these .deb files, so they came up with the dpkg tool. This tool, however, will just install the .deb file, but will not install its dependencies because it doesn't have those files and it does not have access to \"repositories\" to go pull the dependencies from.\n\n\n*Then, they came up with apt-get, which automates the problems in the previous point. Underneath the hood, apt-get is basically dpkg (I like to think of it as apt-get being a front-end for dpkg), but a clever one that will look for the dependencies and install them. It even looks at the currently installed dependencies and determines ones that are not being used by any other packages, and will inform you that you can remove them.\naptitude then came along. It uses the libraries apt-get uses and actually has an interactive UI (user interface). If you want to see this UI, simply type aptitude in the terminal. That's aptitude. It leverages the libraries to provide more options and perks than apt-get. For example, aptitude will automatically remove eligible packages, while apt-get needs a separate command to do so. But, in the end, doing sudo aptitude install packageName.deb should at least be the same as sudo apt-get install packageName.deb. There might be subtle differences here and there that I do not know about, but they will both look for the dependencies and do all that stuff. You can read the answer here for more information on the differences between aptitude and apt-get.\nAlso, aptitude does not have Super Cow Powers.\n\nEDIT: Apparently, it does. aptitude -v[v[v[v[v]]]] moo.\n\naptitude might not be installed by default. To install it, do sudo apt-get install aptitude or click this: aptitude .\n\nExtra\n\nThe following information doesn't really directly answer \"What is the difference between dpkg and aptitude/apt-get?\" but it contributes to the big picture.\n\n\nFrom Carlos Campderrós' comment below:\ngdebi is another tool that is kind of a mixture between apt-get and aptitude. When you use it to install a .deb package (gdebi packageName.deb), it will identify the missing dependencies, install them using apt-get, and then finally install and configure the package using dpkg. It even has a simple and neat GUI that gives you information about the .deb package, the files included in the package, and what dependencies need to be installed. To see this GUI, you would do gdebi-gtk packageName.deb. You can give gdebi a try by installing it with sudo apt-get install gdebi or click this: gdebi .\n\nI don't want to confuse anyone, but just to give you another part of the picture, there is another popular Linux package format called RPM, and its files have the .rpm extension. This package format is used on RPM-based Linux distributions (such as Red Hat, CentOS, and Fedora). They use the command rpm to install a package, and yum is the front-end for it, it's the clever one. So their .rpm files are our .deb files, their rpm tool is our dpkg tool, and their yum is our apt-get.\nFrom Paddy Landau's comment below:\nalien is a tool that converts between .rpm and .deb packages. So if you ever fall into the situation where you have an .rpm package, and you want to install in on your Ubuntu (or any other Debian-based distro), you can use the command alien rpm_packageName.rpm to convert it to .deb, and then install it using dpkg. You can do the reverse (convert .deb to .rpm) using alien -r packageName.deb.\n\nA: I think the most important thing and also a difference is to note is that you should use apt-get tool to install packages. (apt or aptitude is fine as well).\nThis is because dpkg is meant to install packages without installing dependent packages.\nBecause of that just installing a package with dpkg, may lead to a later problem where dependency resolution may end up with a broken system.\nYou should use the command line apt-get or apt (since 14.04) tool to install packages. These tools are using dpkg for you and at the same time do have the dependency resolution mechanism inside.\n", "Q: Wifi keeps disconnecting on Lenovo G480 I'm using Lenovo G480 and I just installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS yesterday (dual booting it with Windows 7).

When booting after a proper shut down, there's never any wifi connection. The system states \n\nWifi is disabled by hardware switch\n\nHowever, pressing the hardware switch doesn't change anything.\nThe only workaround I have is to plug in an ethernet cable, wait for connection, then remove it. Now, a wifi connection can be established. The hardware button now functions as expected.\nThis is of course very annoying. First, the wifi shouldn't been disabled if it wasn't before the last shut down. Second, it should be capable of turning it on by pressing the button which is supposedly turned off. Third, it shouldn't magically flip the button through the wonderful presence of an ethernet cable. And as a bonus: It would be nice to have the state of the wifi button displayed with the little LED next to the wifi button (which it did on Ubuntu 12.04 and every other decent operating system I ran so far).\nThe hardware I'm working with is a Broadcom BCM4313 802.11b/g/n Wireless LAN Controller.\n\nNow of course I tried to enable the proprietary driver for this wifi controller, but it still has issues:\nAfter a proper boot, wifi is not connecting, not ever. Disabling the currently active (with LED correctly indicating the status, woohoo!) wifi via hardware button and turning it on again, does not change anything. The only workaround is -- again -- plugging in an ethernet cable and removing it.\n\nWell I don't always have an ethernet cable with me, I'm not always at home and afaik I also need something on the other side of the cable otherwise it's not even detected, so this just isn't a solution.\nIs there a proper fix for this? Otherwise, is there a software way to trick Ubuntu into thinking that a wired connection has been made?\n\nA: Apparently this is part of a bigger problem with certain Broadcom chips, see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bcmwl/+bug/1097519\n\nInstead use the driver brcmsmac, that actually works with BCM4313\n\nAlso, there's loads of info here, but I haven't looked through it all, may be you find something relevant\n\nA: try rfkill unblock all \nrfkill enables and disables wireless devices\n\nA: try\n rfkill unblock wlan0\n\nit will switch wlan0 or other wireless\n\nA: This is not an Ubuntu issue. This is not any driver issue. This is caused by me (and possibly you).\nWhile watching some video... I tried to increase volume with: Fn + F10 key combination ... But I mistakenly pressed Fn + F12 which was Wifi button with 'Radio' symbol on it, which disabled my wifi connection.\nRunning below command in Terminal, you can see the issue:\n> rfkill list all\n    \n    0: Toshiba Bluetooth: Bluetooth           #or whatever it is\n        Soft blocked: no\n        Hard blocked: no\n    1: phy0: Wireless LAN\n        Soft blocked: no\n        Hard blocked: yes    `<------ that's because I press Wifi button (above) `mistakenly`\n\nSolution: Press again the Fn + F12 (or, some other key where you have Radio symbol)\nNow run again the same command:\n> rfkill list all\n\n    0: Toshiba Bluetooth: Bluetooth           #or whatever it is\n        Soft blocked: no\n        Hard blocked: no\n    1: phy0: Wireless LAN\n        Soft blocked: no\n        Hard blocked: no\n\n    <------ no means solved.\n\nNow, go to:\n(Windows button, if you have on the keyboard) > Settings > Wifi > move to On > select your Wiki connection to enter credentials\nDone, your internet is back on.\nReference = here\nI hope this works ...\n", "Q: Removing Ubuntu One As it says in the title. I want to get rid of this useless application ubuntu one.

I had to leave ubuntuone-client-data installed as both apt and synaptic wanted to remove ubuntu-desktop as well.\n\nA: Ok got my solution, remove Ubuntu One with Software Centrer, then remove Ubuntu One Music Store.

I prefer to watch movies with smplayer, from my Xubuntu laptop (opening the smb share in Thunar).\nIt works fine most of the time, but once in a while (not sure what causes it), smplayer will hang. I can quit the window, but the two smplayer processes still exist (one of them ), it won't start a new window, and kill (even kill -9) doesn't remove the processes. I can play the file with Parole, but the only way I can get smplayer to play it again is to reboot. \nI'm guessing this means (s)mplayer is in 'uninterruptible sleep' due to some hickup with serving the file over the network, but how do I work around this? All networks have hickups some times, is there really a situation in Linux where the only solution is a reboot? EDIT: Seems like yes, if the parent process is 1, the only safe method is a reboot.

I didn't find what it could mean on the man vmware man page.\nExec=/usr/bin/vmware %F\nIf I run vmware via my command line, it runs with no errors.\n\n\nA: In my case, the way I was able to get it to work was to make a copy of the .desktop file (vmware-workstation.desktop) located at /usr/share/applications and save it on my desktop. \nThen change the permissions so it can be executed and run it from the desktop.\n$ cp /usr/share/applications/vmware-workstation.desktop ./Desktop/vmware-workstation.desktop\n$ cd ./Desktop\n$ sudo chmod +x vmware-workstation.desktop\n$ ./vmware-workstation.desktop\n\nFixed some spelling\n", "Q: What is hammering the CPU when top is not running? On Kubuntu 12.10 I can see with the KDE System Monitor Plasmoid that the CPU usage is fluctuating between 60% - 90% on both cores. As soon as I open top it goes down to 3% - 10%. I thought that the issue is that I'm 'doing nothing' while looking at top, so I closed top (just pressed q) and still did nothing with the keyboard nor mouse. However the CPU usage jumps back up to where it was. What might be smart enough to calm down while top is running?\n\nA: If you do something while top is closed, like type slowly in kedit/gedit and the cpu usage goes down then this supports the theory that some on-idle process is running and running top is not counted as being idle.  While doing nothing while top is closed is counted as being idle, so the on-idle process roars to life.\nWhat does the following command reveal?\n\nsudo ps -efH\n\n", "Q: How did I uninstall KDE in 13.04? I wanted to uninstall kde-standard package (not confused with kubuntu-desktop) and all of KDE-related packages in 13.04. Seems lightdm shows too many desktops (because I installed lot of DEs) so Unity desktop selection gone off-screen. My selection is to uninstalls one of DEs I have.\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: Try this.  Just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo apt-get --purge remove kde-standard\n\nAlso to clean the list, go to /usr/share/xsessions/, and delete the ones that you want.  Keep in mind this will only remove the DE from the list.\n\nA: sudo apt-get install -y ppa-purge\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nthis works for me\n", "Q: how to add path? I am trying to complete the installation for some software. According to which I have to add path. I am not getting it how to do that. Please guide me how to do the following steps.\nAdd the path to Rpa/Tk headers:\n -I/usr/include/rpatk\n\nTo link to the Rpa/Tk libraries on Linux add the following link options:\n-lrpa -lrvm -lrex -lrlib -lm\n\nRVM library uses some math functions from the system math library, that is why you must include '-lm' to include the math library to your project in addition to the Rpa/Tk built libraries:\nlibrpa\nlibrex\nlibrvm\nlibrlib\nhttp://www.rpasearch.com/rpatk/doc/doxygen/rpadoc/html/rpatk_build.html\n\nA: These instructions are telling you how to compile another package using the package that you've installed. Technically, the installation is already complete, and you only need to follow these instructions later when you want to compile something else. Is there another package that you want to install that uses this one?\nThe special strings from the instructions are just command line arguments to gcc. For example, if you wrote a C program that used rpatk in a file called test.c, you would run this to compile it:\ngcc -I/usr/include/rpatk -lrpa -lrvm -lrex -lrlib -lm -o test test.c\n\n", "Q: How to set up SSHD to allow login using public key authentication? I've been trying to set my vps to use SSH keys for login instead of password. I've been reading tutorial after tutorial on how to set this up but I just can't set it up right.\nSo what I have done so far is the following\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096\n\nYour identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.\nYour public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.\nThe key fingerprint is:\naf:3a:f2:75:5f:c2:67:c8:ad:1d:0a:ab root@localhost\n\nCopied Public Key into authorized_keys\ncp root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub /root/.ssh/authorized_keys\n\nThe issue is, how do I login via this key? Do I save the private key on notepad? Because if SSH key logs me in via ip, I don't think I can login because my ip is dynamic . Can someone help me?\n\nA: The contents of id_rsa.pub have to be added to the file /root/.ssh/authorized_keys on the machine that you want to log into as root. On that (\"target\") machine, sshd also has to be configured to allow public key authentication. See sshd_config(5).\nAfter this, you ssh as user root from some other machine to the target machine (by name or IP address, it doesn't matter). If you have protected the private key file /root/.ssh/id_rsa with a password then ssh asks you for the password so that it can read the private key.\n\nA: If you present an authorized key, the default configuration let you in regardless of where you come from.\n\nA: Try using 'ssh-copy-id', a nice and simple way to copy a key to a remote server with correct permissions etc...\n$ ssh-copy-id username@server\n"]
