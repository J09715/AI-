["Q: Ubuntu One and Hidden files sync Libreoffice uses a file to lock documents you are editing that has a .(period) as the first letter of the name.\nUbuntu One does not sync this file so I have no protection from multiple editors of a document at one time.\nHow do I make Ubuntu One sync every document, including hidden ones?\nThanks.\nMike.\n\nA: Those files are explicitly excluded because it will sometimes make either the syncdaemon or libreoffice get its knickers in a knot. If you want to test and see if it works for you to have them synced, remove the appropriate line from the \"ignore\" configuration option in syncdaemon.conf (I'm not going to point you at it; if you can't figure it out from here, you won't be able to fix it if it breaks).\n\nA: I was able to edit the files (actually copy the modified section to the local copy) and the files started syncing.\nMike.\n", "Q: How can I add more wallpapers? How do I increase the amount of wallpapers that appear on the menu for customizing the desktop with my backgrounds in 11.10?\nI added more images to the respective folder in /usr/share/background as root, but the list does not remain persistent.\nThe images in 11:10 changes alone. So I want to add funds to enhance the environment. When I copy the images to the folder /usr/share/backgrounds the list is updated and increased. But only for the first time. Thereafter, the system ignores the other images, and the list of funds has become original as first.\nAny help?\n\nA: You might want to install wallch  from Software Center and add it to the Startup Applications. That is an application made for that purpose, as described before.\n\nA: Well, I think I found the answer. First, you should take ownership of /usr/share/backgrounds and /usr/share/backgrounds/contest/precise.xml using the chown command. Then you can copy your favorite image(s) to /usr/share/backgrounds. Then you can modify precise.xml to do your desired job.\nOpen precise.xml in a text editor. Suppose the image you want to add is named ABSTRACT-AnotherBlue_1024x768.png. Then you should copy one part of the body program and modify it like:\n<static><duration>1795.0</duration>\n<file>/usr/share/backgrounds/ABSTRACT-AnotherBlue_1024x768.png</file></static\n<transition><duration>5.0</duration>\n<from>/usr/share/backgrounds/Twilight_Frost_by_Phil_Jackson.jpg</from>\n<to>/usr/share/backgrounds/Twilight_Frost_by_Phil_Jackson.jpg</to></transition>\n\nNote that the next image name is Twilight_Frost_by_Phil_Jackson.jpg, so you should copy this piece just before:\n<static><duration>1795.0</duration>\n<file>/usr/share/backgrounds/Twilight_Frost_by_Phil_Jackson.jpg</file></static>\n<transition><duration>5.0</duration\n<from>/usr/share/backgrounds/Twilight_Frost_by_Phil_Jackson.jpg</from>\n<to>/usr/share/backgrounds/Precise_Pangolin_by_Vlad_Gerasimov.jpg</to></transition>\n\nNow save and exit. Then restart your computer. You're done!\n\nA: I wrote a perl script to build out the xml file.

You can also create your own personal collection of background images in a folder, and open up the Appearance application and chose your folder/images by adding them via the + and - sign. If you are looking to do the first, wallch (listed above) is going to be your best bet. \n\nA: You can install the gnome-backgrounds package to get the ones which upstream GNOME ship with. If you want to add more to the main \"Wallpapers\" listing in the control center, versus just having them show up under the \"Pictures\" option in the drop down list, you can package them up and create an XML file in the $XDG_DATA_HOME/gnome-background-properties directory, such as bjnobrega-wallpapers.xml, similar to the other XML files which exist in /usr/share/gnome-background-properties. If you look at one it should be fairly obvious what you need to do. The images themselves can be anywhere on the file system, so long as you can read them.\nTo simply have them appear under the \"Pictures\" listing, you can put them in whatever your \"Pictures\" folder is set to (usually ~/Pictures I think), and they will show up. Or you can click the [+] icon under the listing, and select many pictures, where they will all show up under the \"Pictures\" heading.\n\nA: I think it's in /usr/share/backgrounds.\njust make a ~/Pictures/wallpapers\nand make a link from /usr/share/wallpapers to that folder, so then they'll appear as a subfolder in the wallpaper selection, and you won't have to enter the root password every time.\nthat might help \n", "Q: Command line move file with long directory path without repeating directory path Is there any way of executing a mv command without typing the full path in the second argument?\nExample:\nmv my/file/that/has/a/really/long/path/foo.bar some_magic_operator_that_means_the_same_directory/foo.baz\n\nA: As an alternative to brace expansion, you could use the bash shell's history expansion features:\n\n\n*\n\n*! introduces a history expansion\n\n*# event designator denoting the current command\n\n*$ word designator referring to the last argument \n\n\nYou can perform substitutions on the expansion using a sed-like s/pattern/replacement syntax e.g.\nsomecommand path/to/foo.bar !#$:s/.bar/.baz\n\nEx.\n$ mv -v somepath/Original/Dir3/SubDir1/foo.bar !#$:s/.bar/.baz\nmv -v somepath/Original/Dir3/SubDir1/foo.bar somepath/Original/Dir3/SubDir1/foo.baz\n'somepath/Original/Dir3/SubDir1/foo.bar' -> 'somepath/Original/Dir3/SubDir1/foo.baz'\n\nIf you want the path specifically (for example, to mv a file to a completely different name that is not easily obtained by substitution), you can use the h modifier:\n$ mv -v somepath/Original/Dir3/SubDir1/foo.baz !#$:h/baz.foo\nmv -v somepath/Original/Dir3/SubDir1/foo.baz somepath/Original/Dir3/SubDir1/baz.foo\n'somepath/Original/Dir3/SubDir1/foo.baz' -> 'somepath/Original/Dir3/SubDir1/baz.foo'\n\nFor other options, including readline key combinations to yank the last argument, see How to repeat currently typed in parameter on bash console?\n\nA: You can use bash's brace expansion.

I get everything, except one step : \n\nApache SetEnv\nIf you’re running your app with Apache, you can set the env vars for your local app’s VirtualHost using the SetEnv directive. For example: ...\n\nCan anyone clarify this step, and explain what I am doing, and tell me where this VirtualHost file is, because I searched all over /opt/lampp/ folder, and there isn't one. Thanks in forward\n\nA: Disclaimer:  I haven't read this Hiroku guide, but I have lots of normal local websites on my local Ubuntu server, which is adapted from a standard Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.\nThere is a directory with all the apache configuration in /etc/apache2. In this directory, there are 4 subdirectories, two for sites and two for modules; each has one for everything available, and one for just the ones that are enabled.  These are named:\nsites-available   sites-enabled\nmods-available    mods-enabled\n\nWhat you want to look in is sites-enabled.  In this folder, I think there should be a default file called 000-default.   \nIn this file, there can be a number of entries for \"VirtualHost\"  I believe there is only one by default, that sets up the main web directory for apache.  Many people just add directories under this one, and access them by adding directories to the URL.  But you can add any number of virtual hosts, in any directories you want.  \nFor example, say you have a domain called abc.com, and you want to work on it locally.  You can make an alias in the hosts file of your local workstation that you use for development (that's in /etc/hosts) for abc.com (temporarily, as this will preempt the external abc.com) to redirect it to the server (either by name or IP, or using localhost if it's on the same system).\nThe magic happens in apache's 000-default file, where it will look for a VirtualHost called abc.com.\nSo, say you have a website in a directory /var/www/abc.com; then you would add something like this to the apache file:\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    <Directory /var/www/abc.com>\n        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews\n        AllowOverride All\n        Order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n    </Directory>\n    DocumentRoot /var/www/abc.com/\n    ServerName abc.com\n</VirtualHost>\n\nIf you want to work on a local file, and a remote file, without editing localhost, you can rename the local one to something like abc.dev, put this in localhost, and change the apache file from abc.com to abc.dev.  Then it will always be available by simply entering http://abc.dev to the address bar of your browser (or just abc.dev).\nIf you aren't familiar with the hosts file and need help, let me know, but it's fairly straightforward, and I don't want to waste too much time with things you may already know.\nI hope my explanation has been helpful, but if not, feel free to ask for elaboration.\n", "Q: Installing ubuntu 11.04 fails on Dell M6600 I have a Dell M6600 with Ubuntu 10.04 Howver the X drivers are pretty messed up due to the following issues:\n1.

Out with the old stuff. \nI want to digitize my old vinyls.\nWhat would be necessary to do that?\n\nA: There are two parts to this issue:\nPart 1: connecting something that can read records with your computer\nFor this, you can either play the record on your normal turn table, and take the audio output to your line-in via cable.  You'll need a cable with 1/8 inch male audio on one end, and whatever output your turntable has easily available.  EG a headphone jack on your stereo.  Cables like this are available from audio stores like radio shack or best buy or whereever.  If you have more speicific questions about this aspect, I'd be happy to provide more details - comment or edit with more details.\nAlternatively, you could use something like @Jim mentions in his comment - a USB turntable.  I have 0 experience with these or if they are Ubuntu compatable.\nPart 2: record the audio that's coming in.  For this part, @fossfreedom's answer here covers this in good detail.\n\nA: I've used a Phono PreAmp made by Terratec which accepts an ordinary turntable's output, amplifies it and passes on the signal to your computer via a USB connection. (If you already have a good quality turntable this makes sense, otherwise not.)\nYou will need a suitable programme to enable the recording, of course, and I have been using Audacity. When I upgraded to Ubuntu 14.04, my set-up went haywire. After much trial and error, I found that I needed to use the overall system volume control to get the input level right.\nThe other vital step was to turn-off \"software passthrough\". This is a pain, because it makes it impossible to monitor recording as you go. (There is a detailed explanation on the Audacity forum of why this feature is a bit of a high-wire trick and you shouldn't be surprised if it won't work.) I have found that a useful approach is to identify the loudest track/section on what you are recording and set all controls to avoid \"clipping\" (distortion because it's too loud). You can go back and boost any tracks that are too quiet with Audacity's amplify effect. \n", "Q: How can I configure and use a HUAWEI E173 HSDPA USB Modem?

There are currently no plans to re-enable it, which is a shame. Source.\n\nA: There are three different general ways to accomplish something generally like this:\nFirstly, suspend.  This puts the computer into very lower power mode, but it isn't truely shut down.  When you return from a suspend, everything is the same.  NOTE: if power is totally lost, the state is also lost.\nSecondly, hibernate.  This takes the RAM and saves it to the swap space on the harddrive, enabling the computer to be fully shut down.  When a computer is turned back on after a hibernate, the state is loaded back into RAM, and everything continues the way it was.  \nThirdly, saved sessions.  (FWIW, I suspect this is what you're referring to)  This is when the desktop environment saves which programs are open upon log out so that when you log back in, it automatically starts up those programs.  NOTE: the programs won't necessarily be in the same state they were before.\nThe answer depends on which of those you're wanting, and what version of ubuntu you're using.  \n", "Q: Internal microphone not working in Google talk My laptop is Lenovo T400, which has an internal microphone.

I'd like to reinstall Win 7 to ensure the sound issues are not hardware (speakers), before pursuing lengthy troubleshooting (I've done the basic stuff already). \n\n\n*\n\n*Can I do this?\n\n*Can I do this AND preserve my current Lubuntu install, with some degree of confidence? I understand there is always a risk when repartitioning.\n\n*How?\nThanks!\n\nA: If you have only two partition (RECOVERY partition and Ubuntu Partition with rest of the hard drive), you need to create a new partition and restore windows 7 on newly created partition. To create a partition you can use default partition manager tool in ubuntu OR any disk utilities like acronics disk director,EASUS PARTITION MANAGER (free).\n\nThese third party tools need to be installed in a windows system, and\n  then you can create a boot able cd/usb for booting and managing.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*First re-size the current ubuntu partition and use free space to\ncreate a new partition (ref link: - How to create new partitions in a brand new laptop easily and safely)\n\n*After that you can use the tool called boot-repair to update the\ngrub. (ref Link- https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows)\n\nIf you have installed ubuntu on a separate partition and you have a free partition (I mean no important data, as it will deleted while installing win 7), then install win 7 on that partition. Then use live cd/usb to update the grub using the tool mentioned above. \n\nNote: I hope you got a restoration dvd created if you want factory\n  image restore. If you want to use your factory image stored in\n  RECOVERY partition. You need to extract the image file (with extension\n  .vim) and \"imagex\" tool for re-deployment.

Great Job All! How about a client for Windows Phones since a client is working for Windows 7?\nKeep up the great work.\n\nA: The Ubuntu One client for Windows doesn't really bring us much closer to a client for the Windows Phone platform.  Our desktop client is written in Python (and shares most of its code with the Ubuntu version), while WP7 apps need to be written with XNA or Silverlight.\nAlso, the desktop client works in terms of synchronising all of your files locally, while on a mobile platform where storage is limited and bandwidth constrained, it is more useful to be able to browse all of your files and only download the ones you're interested in (which is how the Android files app works).\nWhile we don't have immediate plans to release a WP7 native application, the API that the Android client uses to access the service is publicly documented if you're interested in developing an application yourself:\nhttps://one.ubuntu.com/developer/files/store_files/cloud\nYou also have the option to use Ubuntu One's web interface to access your files.\n\nA: You could try out this app, although it seems to only implement the filestorage API.\n", "Q: How to prevent Network Manager from auto creating network connection profiles with \"available to everyone\" by default We have several laptops at work which use Ubuntu 11.10 64bit.\nI have our Wifi Access Point requiring WPA2-EAP Authentication (backed by a LDAP server).\nI have the staff using these laptops when doing presentations by using the Guest Account.\nSo by default when you have a wifi card, network manager will display available Wireless Access Points.\nSo the logical course of action for a Novice(tm) user is to single left click the easy to use option in the Network Manager drop down list... At this point the Staff Member (who is logged in with the guest account) expects to just be able to connect and enter any authentication details if required.\nBut because they are using the Guest account, they won't ever have admin permissions (nor do I want them to), and so PolKit kicks in with a request for admin authorisation.\nI solved this part by modifying the PolKit permissions required to allow all users to create System Network Connections...\nHowever, because these Staff members are logging onto the Wifi Access Point with Ldap Credentials and because the Network Manager is now saving those credentials as a System Connection, their password is available for the next guest user session (because system connection profiles are stored in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections.d/* ).\nIt creates system connections by default because \"Available to all users\" is ticked by default when you quickly connect to a new wifi access point.\nI want Network Manager to not tick this by default.

For example, if I have 3 hard drives, how much they are using. How much is the motherboard using and any other device.\nIs it possible to check?\n\nA: It is possible to get estimates of the wattage a specific device/process is using with PowerTOP. In order to get estimates of the amount of power that is being used, rather than just the % of wakeups from specific processes, it is important to first calibrate powertop.\nsudo powertop --calibrate\n\nThis takes time as it performs various tests whiles switching different devices on and off. You must not touch the machine during calibration. When calibration is done it will start PowerTOP as normal. Now you must leave PowerTOP running to allow it to gather data. After approximately an hour, power estimations will begin appearing in the first column.\n\nA: You can't do this from within a shell - the software doesn't have any way of knowing how much power is consumed as you need to measure the current drawn by the PSU to get a good reading of power consumption.\nI did this for my computers (in a reasonably accurate way) with one of the devices power companies give out for free to measure power consumption for your house.

By now, I have up to ten identical bookmarks in the list and I spend a lot of time scrolling over them.\nIs there any way to remove them permanently?\nEDIT: Apps, too.\n\nA: Actually, after looking at several responses via Google searches and spending hours looking at my problem with imported bookmarks creating one folder per website I had in my bookmarks, it appears I finally fixed the problem.  Here's what I did to fix it.  Hope it works for you as well and saves you some time looking for a solution.\nI am using Windows 7 OS.  Please note that these steps will delete ALL Google Chrome bookmarks from your browser.  Then, you will import from IE (or whatever browser you choose) so you have a clean copy without duplicate bookmarks being shown in Chrome.  Please note the steps are easy.  I just broke them down to be very specific and clear in several steps for better results.\nIf you have more than one computer with this problem, then do these steps on all computers at the same time.  Otherwise, bookmarks on one computer will mess up the others when you Sign in to Chrome (and you'll have duplicates again).\n1)  Go to the Chrome menu, using the icon in the upper right corner, and select Settings.  In the Sign In section, click on the \"Google Dashboard\" link.\n2)  On the Google Dashboard screen, press the \"Stop and Clear\" button, then confirm by selecting \"OK\" on the next window.\n3)  After the Google Dashboard clear is complete, on the Settings screen, press the \"Disconnect your Google Account...\" button.  Then, confirm with \"Disconnect account\" on the next window.\n4)  Exit out of ALL Chrome browser windows.\n5)  Go to your C: Drive and search for \"Bookmarks\" in the Search field.\n6)  Right click on the result that says \"C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\" and select the \"Open File Location\" menu item.\n7)  Delete the Bookmarks and Bookmarks.bak files.\n8)  Open a Chrome browser window.  You will notice there are no bookmarks, but there is a link at the top stating that you can Import your bookmarks.  Click on that link and follow the prompts to import from whatever browser window you choose.  Your bookmarks will be shown once they have all been imported.\n9)  On the Settings screen, press the \"Sign in to Chrome\" button, then enter your Google email and password.  Then, confirm with \"OK, sync everything\" on the next window.\n10)  There you go...  Now the bookmarks should be correct and they are now uploaded to your Google Account for easy syncing to other computers.  You may want to turn off syncing temporarily or permanently to preserve your bookmark list.\nEnjoy your day.  I know I will now that I finally figured this out!\n\nA: Ok i have a solution for this, its 2016 now, things have changed.\n1) Open your Master Chrome browser that you have all dialed in the way you like.\n\n*\n\n*open settings\n\n*in the Sign In section, click on the \"Google Dashboard\" link.\n\n2) On the Google Dashboard screen\n\n*\n\n*press  \"Reset Sync\"\n\n*\"OK\" to confirm\n\n3) After the Google Dashboard clear is complete\n\n*\n\n*open settings\n\n*press \"Disconnect\" your account, if it isnt already\n\n*close and reopen browser\n\n*sign back in\n\n*turn sync on, and adjust\n\n4) BE CAREFUL\nNow you need to go to any other devices browser that uses this account and carefully do the following IMMEDIATELY as you open them(could be 6 months from now? have to remember, or do it now):\n\n*\n\n*open settings\n\n*sign out\n\n*do one of the following\n\n*clear all bookmarks\n\n*or Reset settings, depending on if your also having theme issues, etc.. Resetting will make sure ALL settings are synced exactly.\n\n*sign back in\n\n*turn on sync\nit will bring your master copy down to it.\n\n\nA: You can select what to sync and what not. For example you can disable sync for bookmarks and apps but keep it enabled for autofill and themes. It is in Settings / Personal Stuff / Advanced...

I set it to \"do nothing\" when an external storage device gets plugged in (which it obeys to) but it still pops up after suspend.\nHow do I disable this feature?\n\nA: Try:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.media-handling automount-open 'false' \n\nBut this will also break automatically opening Nautilus when you insert removable media.\n", "Q: Finding directories inside a folder and deleting if smaller than a certain size? What command can I execute to check the directories inside a folder and if the total size of the directory is smaller than 30MB, delete it? I played around with the find command trying to move files based in the size but it didn't work properly.\nI was using (for 1mb):\nfind . -size +102400k -exec mv DIRECTORY\nfind . -size -102400k -exec mv DIRECTORY\n\n\nA: If we're talking about directory size, I'm not sure find is going to help. du is going to have to be involved at some point.\nHere's something I have written to find near directories under 30M:\ndu --max-depth 1 | awk -v q='\"' '$1 < 30000000 && $2 != \".\" {sub(/^[0-9\\t ]+/, \"\", $0); print q $0 q}'\n\nYou can then chain that into xargs rm -rf but I would test it very seriously before doing that. You might want to move the directories (with mv) instead of straight-up deleting them.\n\nA: Find doesn't know the total size of directories. So that approach won't work.\nYou could find all directories, and exec a script that uses du to see if they are smaller than 1MB.\n", "Q: Another ubuntu one music problem with ID3-Tags (\"unknown artist\" problem) I started using ubuntu one a few days ago. I put some MP3s into the cloud music folder and I can play them just fine in the music web and andriod applications. \nThe problem is that all files are sorted under \"unknown artist\" and \"unknown album\" and the title is either the file name or a part of it (which is from the service \"guessing the title\" I guess). \nIt seems the problem happened before. I looked in the FAQ, which said this happens with m4a files, but I use mp3 files. The ID3 tags are correct and are tagged with ID3v1 and ID3v2. I read to wait, until the service can catch up with the tagging, so I waited 24 hours, still nothing. Every single file is still listed under unknown artist/unknown album.\nI'm running out of options here :/\n\nA: Diverse MP3 players (and probably the UBUNTU One cloud, too) don't support ID3v2.4. Your tagging software has to write the tags in ID3v2.3 (and ISO 8859-1).\n\nA: You should open a support request at https://one.ubuntu.com/help/contact/ about your problem.\n", "Q: How to have multiple path separators in Bash I have few python scripts which were written by someone else in Windows. These scripts use double backslash as path separator but when run in Ubuntu they don't work because of this. I can change all \\ to / and scripts will work but there are lot of scripts and its a lot of effort to change each \\ to /\nSo my question is: Is it possible to add \\ as path separator in Ubuntu or only in Bash so that I dont have to modify these scripts?\nExample code:\n# Append Common directory to the Python search path\nsys.path.append('..\\\\..\\\\..' + os.sep + 'Common')\n\n\nA: In Linux, filenames can contain any characters except / (since it's the path separator) and the NUL byte (the string terminator, \\0). That means \\ is a valid character in a filename, as well as newlines, tabs, terminal escape sequences, unprintable characters... so no, you can't temporarily use \\ as a path separator. \nWindows is not as liberal, and has a larger set of characters not allowed in filenames, and / is one of those characters not allowed. For this reason, python will also consider / a path separator on Windows, so changing those \\\\ to / should make the script work on both Windows and Ubuntu. That said, the proper way to join paths in python is to use the os.path.join function.\nI recommend going through the scripts and manually fix all the non-portable code.\n\nA: I cannot answer you question, but it is very easy to change \\ to / in all scripts like this:\nfind <root_of_scripts> -name \"*.py\" -exec sed -i 's/\\\\\\\\/\\//g' {} \\;\n\n(Just try it on a copy of your files first!)\n", "Q: Created compiz startup file.

I would like to change the way it starts up, but I forgot which file I created/edited to make compiz start automatically. How can I see which file makes the compiz process to start up?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: If you've made the changes using Terminal, check the history log. To do that, simply type history in a terminal window.\n\nA: Is it a user-specific configuration change? Try looking in ~/.config/autostart.\nIf it is system-wide, try /usr/share/gnome/autostart or /usr/share/autostart\n\nA: Using pstree or gnome-system-monitor, you might be able to find the parent process.

If you want to make backups, you use a backup program.  Thunderbird is an email client.  As such, it sends and receives email.  To send, you need an smtp server.\nIf you want to just be able to read email but not send it, then you can change the auto detect settings so they don't need to be detected, and it will let you create the account without testing.\n", "Q: Regarding partitions for dual-booting Ubuntu with pre-existing Windows 7 I have zero actual experience with configuring disk partitions and the stuff I have read for the past few hours have been confusing me a bit, so please bear with me.\nFirst of all, I'd like to explain what I'm setting to achieve:\nWindows 7 with: \n\n\n*\n\n*C:\\ Windows 7 (pre-existing installation)\n\n*D:\\ Data (Already exists and has files already)\n\n\nUbuntu 11 - Does not exist yet, but I already have a LiveCD in hand.\n\n\n*\n\n*\\root directory for Ubuntu\n\n*\\home on its own partition I plan\n\n*\\swap on its own partition with around 8GB\n\n\nHere is the current situation:\nI have a single 500 GB hard-disk with Windows 7 x64 installed, and the current partition schemes is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*System Reserved: 100 MB (Primary, Active)\n\n*C: 100 GB - Where Windows 7 is installed (Primary)\n\n*D: 365 GB - Where my files are located, LOTS of free space (Primary)\n\n\nNow, I would like to shrink my D: drive and create around 40 GB of unallocated disk space for the Ubuntu installation, but here what's confusing me a bit:\nI'm thinking I would create an extended partition and subdivide it into 3 logical partitions for the Ubuntu setup I had in mind. (If you think my setup is a bad idea, please let me know & why. I also hope you can suggest a better one...)\nI am aware that I can only have up to 4 primary partitions, or 3 primary partitions with 1 extended parition max. Now, does the System Recovery portion count as one primary partition? I'm really new to these things and it is totally unclear to me.\nIn shrinking my D: drive using Windows 7's Disk Management tool, I would get an unallocated free space which I don't know how to make an extended partition from. It seems like I can only create a primary partition from it, not an extended one. How do I go about it?\n(I'd also like to note, if it is of any importance, that I am trying to avoid using the option to install Ubuntu alongside Windows, and much rather prefer using the custom install where I can specify which drives I wish to use and stuff. Somehow I feel its safer that way.)\n\nA: Your understanding is correct. Go ahead and make the space by reducing the size of your D: partition. Leave the space an unallocated.\nThe ubuntu installer will do the rest of the partitioning for you.\n\nOn the next screen, select \"specify partitions manually\"\n\nSee : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GraphicalInstall\nAlternately , gparted is on the live CD and you can make partitions before you run the installer.\n\nA: More details of how to use the manual partitoning feature in the Ubuntu install process can be found at:  http://linuxnorth.wordpress.com/manual-partitioning/.  The post also includes links to other relevant web pages and video tutorials.  In particular, there are a couple of references to the use of GParted which should help you establish the unallocated space that you need.  Once you have created this unallocated space, the installation process is relatively straightforward.\n", "Q: How to install Samsung scx printer driver from cd?

My issue is that for some reason I have duplicates of some music tracks. However they are not named identically. For instance:\n\nMusic/Prefuse 73/One Word Extinguisher/07.

Let me give an example:\nmkdir -p \"Music/Prefuse 73/One Word Extinguisher/\"\ndd if=/dev/urandom of=Music/Prefuse\\ 73/One\\ Word\\ Extinguisher/07.Detchibe.mp3 bs=1023 count=2048\n  2048+0 records in\n  2048+0 records out\n  2095104 bytes (2.1 MB) copied, 0.379806 s, 5.5 MB/s\ncp Music/Prefuse\\ 73/One\\ Word\\ Extinguisher/07.Detchibe.mp3 Music/Prefuse\\ 73/One\\ Word\\ Extinguisher/\"07 - Detchibe.mp3\"\nfdupes -rd .\n  [1] ./Music/Prefuse 73/One Word Extinguisher/07.Detchibe.mp3\n  [2] ./Music/Prefuse 73/One Word Extinguisher/07 - Detchibe.mp3\n\n  Set 1 of 1, preserve files [1 - 2, all]:\n\nFirst I created the directory like in your example. The I made a file from random data and copied its contents to another files. When I run fdupes -rd the software finds the two exact files and asks which one to delete.\nIf you have lots of files, you can use the option -1. fdupes will print all duplicates on a single line. You can process them with xargs and other shell features.\n\nA: I found a somewhat simple command chain. Much thanks to @Oli.\nfdupes -rf --quiet ~/Desktop/Dupes2/ | while read i; do mv \"$i\" ~/Desktop/Dupes/ ; done\n\nThis used fdupes to recursively (-r) find  the dupes, omitting the first (-f). Bash reads this line by line through read amd hands each line to mv to move all duplicates to another directory. Note the use of quotes in the while loop to handle spaces and other dodgy punctuation that fdupes will not handle (even with -1/--sameline).\n\nA: In the answers to Manually set track listen count in Banshee?, it describes how to get at the database that banshee uses to save all track information.\nOnce you're connected to the database, on the execute query table, paste\nselect tweaked_track, count(*) from \n  (select replace(replace(replace(title, ' ', ''), '-', ''), '.', '') as tweaked_track \n   from coretracks) \ngroup by tweaked_track \norder by 2, 1 desc;\n\ninto the SQL string box, then click 'execute query'.  This will show you all the tracks you have with the same title ignoring spaces, dashes, and periods.  If there are other characters you want to ignore, add them to the query in the same pattern. (IE add replace( before the first existing \"replace\" and after the last \")\" on that line, add , '[character you want removed]', '').\n(I don't know how much you know about sql - if you need more details, post a comment.)\nThis will give you a list of titles.  You will have to actually do the delete yourself.\nThere may be a better way of doing this, but if there is, I don't know about it.\nOnce you have a big list of files to be deleted (either from my method or from fdupes like others have mentioned), put the list of files you want to delete into a text directory.  Make sure one of the following is true:\nOption #1: The filenames contain full path.  For example the file might contain: \n/home/doneill/music/weird_al/duped_file.mp3\n/home/doneill/music/weird_al/another_dupe.mp3\n/home/doneill/music/bach/baroque_dupe.mp3\n\nOption #2: The filenames contain relative path, and the file with the list of filenames is saved in the parent folder.  For example, if your file list was saved in /home/doneill/music/, it would contain:\nweird_al/duped_file.mp3\nweird_al/another_dupe.mp3\nbach/baroque_dupe.mp3\n\nIn either case, open up a terminal window, and change to the folder that contains the file with the list  cd /home/doneill/music/ for example.\nType in: \nfor a in `cat filelist.txt`; do echo $a; done\n\n(Replacing filelist.txt with the name of the file with the list).  This should spit out a list of all the files you want to delete.  Take a moment to double check the list.  If it is right, type: \nfor a in `cat filelist.txt`; do rm $a; done\n\nThis basically tells your computer:  for each line in the file filelist.txt, remove a file with the name listed.\n", "Q: Problem after upgrade to GNOME Shell 3.4 (Ubuntu 11.10) I updated the GNOME Shell by these points:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ricotz/testing\n\n*sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3\n\n*sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n*sudo apt-get install gnome-shell\n\n\nUnfortunately, no longer work themes and extensions.\n \nHow can I fix it (or return to the previous version)?\nRegards and I hope to help.\nEdit:\nI noticed that I can not update gnome-shell-extension-common\n\nA: The gnome shell extensions are out of date, meaning that they support either Gnome 3.2 or Gnome 3.3. Its better to go to https://extensions.gnome.org/ and check which extensions are  compatible with Gnome 3.4. You can also install them directly from the browser if required! \nHope that helps.\n\nA: I'm not sure, I haven't tried the update myself, however, I do know there is only about 10 extensions that still work with gnome 3.4 so there is going to be some compatibility issues, plus as stated in my article on 11.10 beware of the risks.\n\nA: GNOME Shell 3.4 is designed for Ubuntu 12.04+, if you not remove Unity when you login use this and remove gnome-shell.

For instance I downloaded the EvilStatusIconForever extension for 3.2 and added 3.4 to the metadata.json and it works just fine.  Others, such as theming support require more.

Is there any setting/plugin/hack/workaround that will allow me to run Ubuntu with the Gnome 3.x/Gnome Shell desktop while retaining a rectangular 2x2 or n x m workspace grid instead of the default Gnome one-dimensional line-up of workspaces?\n\nA: I was actually looking at this today, and the short answer is no. A hacky workaround is to have a gnome-panel running, with the workspace-switcher applet on it. This applet provides a setting for number of rows of workspaces, so you can create a grid layout.\nI used to have a hack that was a daemon running in the background, which would handle this for me, so I wouldn't need the workspace switcher applet. It doesn't work any more though. However, I'll be rewriting it soon, so that it works again with GNOME 3.x, and using dconf/gsettings. It will only be configurable from editing the settings directly using the gsettings command line tool, or dconf-editor, though.\n\nA: I'm using GNOME Shell version 42, extension version 34 and I just upgraded by ubuntu release from 20.04 LTS to 22.04 LTS.\nIf anyone is using Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and cannot get grid workspaces to work with firefox (snap, or no snap), then refer to this other answer to a similar question.\nEssentially it involves installing the \"Extension manager\" as such:\nsudo apt install gnome-shell-extension-manager\n\nWhich then enables workspace grids in a similar fashion to the gnome shell extension tool for firefox.\n\nA: Recommended extensions for 3.32+ and 40, 41, 42, 43: Workspace Matrix.\nWorkspace Grid is currently not being updated, but the developer instead recommends Workspace Matrix.

It is works flawlessly with 3.20.\nTwo benefits over Frippery Bottom Panel (which work well, cf. this answer) are:\n\n*\n\n*No hacking required to remove the bottom panel.\n\n\n*In the overview, the grid structure is shown as the chosen two-dimensional grid. With Frippery Bottom Panel, The overview continues to shows a single strip of workspaces.\nWorkplace Grid. The width of the workspace overview is adjustable.\n\nFrippery Bottom Panel. Though a workplace grid is achieved, it is not shown in the overview.\n\n\nA: You can get a 1X1 workspace grid using the new WorkspaceBar extension I wrote. I will look into adding a 2X2 option if people want it. It would be small little buttons to fit on the panel.\n\nA: Pre-GNOME-Shell 3.10: With a combination of two extensions, it is possible. The downside is that you will have a bottom bar.\nMy blog post explains various ways on how to do this, including getting rid of the bottom bar (included below).\nFor 3.10 - 3.20:\nGo to extensions.gnome.org and find Frippery Bottom Panel. Install it. This will give you a bottom bar. Clicking on the right side will give you an option to disable dynamic workspaces and allows you to set number of rows and columns.\nThe cleanest way of getting rid of the bottom bar is by editing\n ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/Bottom_Panel@rmy.pobox.com/stylesheet.css \n\nand on line 6, change the height to -3pt.

These folders do not have the . character in from of them to hide them from plain sight. When I try to \"Show hidden files\" in Nautilus, Nautilus closes/crashes itself and it does not show the hidden folders or files.\nSomehow they are hidden without using the normal dot in the beginning of the filename. They have my user permission, but no way of seeing them from within Nautilus. I can interact with them, but the fact that they appear hidden when I can see them inside the ISO and after extracting them they disappear is what confuses me.\nWhat permission or setting makes this folders appear hidden and does not let Nautilus show them and like I said before, trying to show them with the \"Show hidden files\" option crashes Nautilus and exits it, forcing me to have to open Nautilus again from the Launcher.\n\nA: Found this that solved the problem. Learned something new everyday: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/31688/options-for-hidden-files\nThere was a file called .hidden that just so happened to have the list of files that appear hidden but without the . in front of them.\nAfter removing this file everything is shown in Nautilus.\nSo basically there are 3 ways to hide a file:\n\n\n*\n\n*Prefix the . symbol in front of the file/folder. If it was spore, after hiding it this way it should be .spore with a . (dot) in front of it.\n\n*Add a ~ at the end of the file. If the file ends with ~, it is considered a \"Backup File\" and by default it gets hidden. If you have a file called spore and you change it to spore~ this would hide it and it would be considered a backup file. You can see that by default gedit for example does this.\n\n*Create the .hidden file in the directory where you want to hide some files/folder. Inside the .hidden file add in each line the name of the file or folder you wish to hide.\n\nA: As you said correctly, hidden files/folders have a . in front of the filename, indicating that they are hidden files, also called dot-files.\nI never heard of this phenomena being possible or occuring before as you described it.\nWhat happens, when you use the ls -la command in terminal for that particular path/dir?! (Are those folders still shown without a .?!)\nIf you are certain about these folders being hidden folders, you manually could hide them by using the mv (move)-command, like so: mv /media/fun/misc/FOLDER /media/fun/misc/.FOLDER and see, if that resolves the \"Show hidden files\" crash in Nautilus. \n", "Q: How do I partition my Windows hard drive?

Also, if I run firefox from a terminal (using ubuntu classic), I get the following message 'failed to create drawable' and the browser does show up the proper icon. Is there a way what drawable failed? The message shows up even if I only bring up the command line parameters help (firefox -h), altho it shows in the middle of the output.\n\nA: Alright, figured out how to solve the issue, although not quite 'why' it happened.\nSeems I had installed a stand-alone version of Firefox (a Mozilla build probably, from mozilla.org). After a while the Ubuntu-supported version made it's way to the computer, not sure if during one of the OS upgrades.\nSo when I ran Firefox I was running the version installed in my user home folder (which had updated to 11, the current version at this point in time), which for some reason had trouble displaying the icon. (when running this version from a terminal there are a bunch of gtk error messages).\nWhen I ran Firefox from the command line, the version that ran was the version by Ubuntu Mozilla Team. This version managed to display the icon, despite the error message (which now I believe is not related). Both Firefox's used the same profile data, hence the confusion.\nSo the solution is to just use the right version.

Assuming someone gets a hold of the physical box/laptop? I know with windows there is a requirement for using a password reset disk. But, I assume if anyone gets a hold of an HDD/SSD they can read the info on it assuming the file system hasn't been encrypted. But this, even with encryption, seems that anyone can reset the password for the system if they are at the terminal. \n\nA: A more abstract definition of \"resetting a password\" is \"modifying data on a physical disk\". Everyone with physical access can change any bit on a disk, independent of the OS.\nThe password can only be resetted in a terminal if you know the previous password, unless you're logged in as root (in Recovery mode for example). To protect against this (modification of the password file /etc/shadow), you should use full disk encryption (LUKS). Encrypting your home directory only still allows for modifications to the root filesystem (password file) and insertion of random files.\nBy the way, anyone with physical access can ruin your machine. Boot passwords do not prevent people from taking the disk out of the machine and plugging it in their machine (via a SATA - USB/eSATA cable for instance) and modifying the contents of it (or copying data from it). Even fully encrypted disks are not as fully encrypted as you may expect. How does the system boot? With the unencrypted bootloader. There is a vulnerability also known as \"evil maid attack\" which is performed by modiying the bootloader files. After such an \"attack\", the owner of the machine would not notice anything since there may be small code inserted that copies the entered password. \nA way to migitate this is by using a dedicated boot medium (memory card, USB memory stick), but this is usually not preferable by the normal people which have a very small chance of encountering this.\n", "Q: How to diagnose Ubuntu CPU spikes / IO wait? I'm using Ubuntu and every couple minutes it goes unresponsive for a half second to a full second, which isn't normally a problem but makes trying to code extremely frustrating when your trying to hit backspace or navigate the code and nothing is happening.  The problem is, the freezes are so brief that top doesn't have time to show me what is spiking the CPU (assuming something is, but I don't know what else could cause this).\nDoes anyone know how to troubleshoot this performance issue?\nEdit: I've tried login in with Gnome Classic (No Effects) instead of Unity but it still freezes up every once in awhile.\nEdit: The CPU graph doesn't seem to be showing any actual spikes so it seems you were right and my original diagnosis of CPU spikes being the problem was incorrect, I now suspect IO wait.

Getting it to work may be a different story since I'm not familiar with the software. This assumes you are at the top-level of your home directory:\n\nsudo apt-get install git kdelibs5-dev kdevplatform-dev qt4-dev-tools cmake libglib2.0-dev\nmkdir git-ktechlab && cd git-ktechlab\ngit clone git://github.com/ktechlab/ktechlab.git\ncd ktechlab\nmkdir build && cd build\ncmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debugfull -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/\nmake\nsudo make install\nkbuildsycoca4 &> /dev/null\nupdate-mime-database /usr/share/mime\n \nAnd then run with ktechlab. Note that it segfaults for me when clicking \"New\" but appears to open existing projects successfully.\n\nAlternately, short of setting up a virtual machine running Lucid, the other option may be to create a Lucid chroot, bind your home directory to it and set the X display appropriately so that ktechlab 0.3.x is running \"natively\" on your 11.10 display.\n\nSomewhat off-topic: I've never used ktechlab, but have quite a bit of experience with embedded programming, in particular PICs; but most of it was using MPLAB (and a little gpsim) along with the ICD2 (in-circuit debugger) instead of a simulator. Perhaps an ICD might work for your purposes?\n\nA: Ubuntu 64bits 12.04\nWith this script you can solved it:\nhttp://elpuig.xeill.net/Members/rborrell/ktechlab-in-ubuntu\n\nA: Since the work of porting ktechlab has been, unfortunately, done in the spare time of the developers, it may be a very long time before we can use it in the latest versions of Ubuntu (Kubuntu, Xubuntu, etc).\nHowever I came across this very interesting \"how-to\".\nIt made sense and I am in the process of following the instructions to install lucid \nin a chroot jail to run ktechlab.   It explains how you can configure it to set an icon on your desktop and a simple click from 12.04.\nThe site is in Portuguese, however if you use chromium-browser (and maybe others) you can translate it.

I tried sharing folders, but that failed. I'm a bit of a networking newbie.\nI've looked at like 20-30 pages. Here's one:\nhttp://www.howtoforge.com/moving-files-between-linux-systems-with-scp\nI followed those steps exactly. My problem is that when I try using scp, it just hangs. I'm also not sure which network interface to configure (eth0, eth1?) in the guest OS. Another (significant?) detail is that the inet address of eth0 is 10.0.2.15 instead of something like 192.168.x.y.\nI've enabled the bridge adapter and the host-only adapter. Both the laptop and guest VM have openssh-server installed. I'm not sure what to do at this point.\nIs there a better place to ask about this?\n\nA: The reason you're not able to scp/ssh is your Guest and Host machines are currently on separate networks. The Guest machine is currently NAT'd to the host network so that it may access the internet. Essentially you'll want to set up another network adapter on the Guest VM.\n\nIt should also be noted that the 10.0.2.* subnet is local to your VBox config and is the NAT'd address of the machine. Do not disable this device. The 192.168.. subnet is IP space allocated for internal/personal networks.\n\nTo do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down Guest VM\n\n*In VBox preferences, select Network and \"Adapter 2.\" Enable it and set \"Attached-to\" to \"Host-Only Adapter\"\n\n*Power on Guest VM. Run the following command:\n\n\n\n$ sudo ifconfig eth1\n\nLink encap:Ethernet HWaddr XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX\n  inet addr:192.168.56.101 Bcast:192.168.56.255 Mask:255.255.255.0\n  inet6 addr: XXXX::XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX/64 Scope:Link\n  UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST MTU:1500 Metric:1\n  RX packets:296 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n  TX packets:237 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n  collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000\n  RX bytes:32116 (31.3 KiB) TX bytes:37642 (36.7 KiB)\n\nNow you'll need to edit /etc/network/interfaces. Change the address to your base IP address.\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet static\naddress 192.168.56.101\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\n\nYou should now be able to ssh/scp back and forth between your host and guest machine using the correct IP addresses. (Note, it will not be the IP from eth0)\n\nFrom the host machine to guest machine:\n\n$  ssh user@192.168.56.101 (change this to whatever the guest IP address is)\n\nSuccess!\n\nA: Easy way is to use scp:  \nMake sure you running on guest pc sshd service otherwise run below command:  \n/etc/init.d/sshd restart\n\nFrom host PC:\nscp some_host_file some_guest_user@guest_ip:~/\n\n\nA: I fixed the problem by using the IP address of the second adapter in the homestead installation: 192.168.x.x in my case.  Adapter 1 is NATed and shows 127.0.0.1:2222 in the output while the VM was coming up, but the actual IP address of Adapter 1 was 10.0.X.X in my case.\n", "Q: Attempting to change Keyboard Backlight levels changes theme I'm using an Asus G74SX on Ubuntu 12.04.

(NTFS works too, but for this tutorial I'm using FAT32 because you can make it UEFI bootable this way.)\n\n\n*Mount the USB somewhere, for example /media/<user>/<disc_label>\n\n\n*Install grub to the USB using:\n grub-install --force --no-floppy --boot-directory=/media/<user>/<disc_label>/boot /dev/sdX\n\n(Install to the disk; not partition!)\n\n\n*Extract the contents of the iso onto the root of the USB stick; I personally use 7z for this:\n 7z x /path/to/win.iso\n\n(Note that the Win7 iso has a boot dir; you will need to 'overlap' the boot dir created with grub with the contents of the iso. )\nYou should end up with something like this\n    ├── autorun.inf\n    ├── boot\n    │   └── grub\n    ├── bootmgr\n    ├── efi\n    ├── setup.exe\n    ├── sources\n    ├── support\n    └── upgrade\n\n\n\n*Edit/create boot/grub/grub.cfg so it contains the following menuentry:\n menuentry 'Windows 7 AIO Installer' --class windows --class os {\n   set root=(hd0,1)\n   insmod part_msdos\n   insmod fat\n   insmod ntldr\n   ntldr /bootmgr\n }\n\n\n\n*When you reach the grub prompt (grub>) type boot and press Enter\n\n\n*Enjoy your bootable stick.\nIt may be a bit of a runaround, but this lets you add addtional resources as needed via edits to the grub.cfg file. I personally have a Windows 7 All In one (9 editions of win7) installer, Mini Windows XP (from hirens), DOS 6.22, memtest, and gparted live on one usb stick this way.\nFor UEFI: GPT partition scheme *\n\n*\n\n*Copy efi/microsoft/boot one level upward:\n cp -r efi/microsoft/boot efi/boot/\n\n(The path may be all uppercase, lowercase, or a mix, due to the case-insensitive nature of the FAT32 filesystem and differing mount options. Adjust commands to fit your situation.)\n\n\n*Extract 1/Windows/Boot/EFI/bootmgfw.efi from sources/install.wim\n 7z e sources/install.wim 1/Windows/Boot/EFI/bootmgfw.efi\n\n\n\n*Place this file as efi/boot/bootx64.efi\n mv bootmgfw.efi efi/boot/bootx64.efi\n\n\n\n*Enjoy your UEFI-bootable windows 7 USB!\nFor UEFI: GPT partition scheme - chapter 2 **\nWhen I replaced my SSD with a more modern / faster / bigger one I made the old one into a USB drive.\nTo reach the existing grub on that drive I did the following:\n\n*\n\n*make an efi/boot directory (as above)\n\n\n*copy efi/debian/grubx64.efi and efi/debian/grub.cfg to\nefi/boot/bootx64.efi   and efi/boot/grub.cfg.\n\n\n*boot the new usb drive via the computer's boot menu.\nI guess that this should be done whenever a new version of grub is installed.

I really like using Notepad++ to write HTML and such. After I started using Ubuntu I looked around for an alternative to Notepad++. I found a thread which lead me to try Geany and a few others, but I really miss Notepad++.\nIs there anyway I could compile it from the source code to use on Ubuntu? I know it's written in C++. Could I just open it in Code::Blocks and compile it?\nYou can get the source here.\nI wouldn't mind hearing about other alternatives, but really want to know if compiling it is possible.\n\nA: One of the main features of Notepad++ is that it \"uses pure Win32 API\". This makes it very Windows-specific- it's using builtin Windows functions for a lot of its user interface and general functioning. Getting it to run on any other platform (without Windows API-imitators like Wine) would require a pretty major rewrite.\n\nA: It's an alternative, not a way to compile, but I would probably see if it's possible to run it with WINE.\n \n\nA: Notepadqq is similar to Notepad++ and runs natively on Ubuntu.\nI recommend Notepadqq for Ubuntu users who like Notepad++.\nThe stable version is provided by this official PPA and you can install it by running:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:notepadqq-team/notepadqq\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install notepadqq\n\nThen you can run it from Programming → Notepadqq in your menu, or use the notepadqq command. (It should also appear in your Open with menu when you right-click a file in your file browser, though this may depend on your setup.)\nNotepadqq is a Qt-based GPLv3-licensed FOSS text editor. Aside from running Notepad++ with Wine (which is pretty easy) or undertaking the work of porting it to GNU/Linux with Winelib (which is hard), Notepadqq is probably the most similar editor to Notepad++ that can be run on Ubuntu. It feels much like a port of Notepad++, even though it does not actually contain any Notepad++ code. As the FAQ explains:\n\nIs this project affiliated with Notepad++?\nNo. This project is independent from Notepad++ and doesn’t use any of\n  its code. Notepadqq is inspired by Notepad++: this means that we try\n  to reproduce its best traits, while not being afraid to make different\n  choices on what we think can be improved.\n\nOn my Lubuntu 16.04 LTS system, I have both Notepadqq and Notepad++ installed. (Notepad++ runs with Wine.) I had no problems installing either and they both work reasonably well, though Notepad++ is sometimes slow when I use it to edit very large source code files. I haven't had this problem with Notepadqq, nor with Notepad++ in Windows. Note that I haven't benchmarked them, nor have I extensively used both on the same system, so please take my remarks about performance with skepticism.\nThe two editors do look somewhat different, but you can see that they are largely similar. I find the actual experience of interacting with them to be almost the same.\n\nNotepadqq (left) and Notepad++ (right) on Lubuntu 16.04 LTS, viewing sqlite3.c.\nYou can further adjust their appearance with themes (they are both theme-able) and by adjusting your desktop environment's settings. They may not look exactly like this on your Ubuntu system. I use the LXDE desktop environment. If you use another desktop environment, such as GNOME, the window borders and title bars will be styled differently.\nAs an example of how Notepadqq differs from Notepad++ but not by all that much, and of how it is easy to use if you already know your away around Notepad++, here's how they both look when you search an open file using a regular expression:\n\nRegex search in Notepadqq (left) and in Notepad++ (right).\nNotice that they support the same three kinds of search patterns (named differently).\nIf you want to look at Notepadqq's source code, or compile the latest development version, see Notepadqq on Github. For instructions on how to build it from source or install official pre-built binaries on other OSes, see the README file. You may also be interested in the guidelines for contributing.\n\nA: I will suggest you to install playonlinux. Playonlinux is a GUI front end to wine.\nYou can choose install option from the toolbar or from file menu.\nThen you can click on install a unlisted program link given below.\n\nNow follow the simple procedure.  \nnote: You will need the notepad++ binary you know the link you can simply download them. \nAlternatives to notepad++:\n\n\n*\n\n*bluefish\n\n*gedit(comes with default\n\n*geany\n\n*emacs\n\n*and many more\n\n\nA: Well, I am also a notepad++ fan as you are. Switched to Linux, Searched for alternatives - Looked in Google , blogs , forums and finally came up with an awesome editor - http://www.sublimetext.com/\nAnd then finally I stopped thinking about Notepad++ :)\nThough it asks you to buy, You can use the trail version for ever.\n", "Q: Is it possible to add registry entries to the wine registry and make illustrator work?

Rather than spend countless hours trying to find a way to undo the damage you can start fresh.  You can try to upgrade but if it's broken now it may be just as broken when you get done upgrading.  Really it's easier to start with a clean install and avoid using packages that aren't meant to be used with your version of ubuntu.  12.04 is nearly out of beta anyways and will be supported much longer than 11.10.  \n", "Q: How do I downgrade Thunderbird (or get a working version of Lightning) Could somebody please tell me how to roll Thunderbird back to 11.x, or get a working version of Lightning (which claims it is incompatible with 12.0).

In Gnome Shell you can press Control+Shift+Alt+R to start and stop the built-in screencast tool. What is the name of this tool? Is it possible to invoke it from within Unity?\n\nA: The gnome-shell screencast tool you are referring to is built inside the shell and you cannot use it unless you are using GNOME session. It is part of the session and you can liken it to being something like Unity's top panel, which doesn't come outside of Unity. \nAnd, there is no specific name given to this tool other than the generic built-in GNOME screencast tool. \nIf you are interested in creating screencasts, you can follow this question for alternative tools:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to record my screen?\n\nA: No, you cannot use it in Unity.

Since installing the beta, I am presented with a GRUB2 menu every time I boot up, which selects 12.04 by default. (Aside: when the 11.10 kernel updated from 3.0.0-16 to 3.0.0-17 this option did not appear in the GRUB2 menu.)\nWhen I open Grub Customizer in 11.10, it shows 11.10 kernel 3.0.0-17 as the default, when I open Grub Customizer in 12.04, it shows 12.04 as the default.\nHow can I change GRUB2 to pick the latest 11.10 kernel as the default? (Latest means that if 3.0.0-18 is released it will become the default, and so on.) And also stop displaying the menu (I only boot into the beta when I have something specific to test).\nGeneric answers that apply to any two Ubuntus running side-by-side are preferred.\n\nA: You probably have the grub bootloader installed in two different locations, with different defaults for each. From your 11.10 install (i.e. the one you want to be default), run \nsudo grub-install /dev/sda \nthen \nsudo update-grub. \nThis should ensure that 11.10's version of grub is booted first when you turn on your PC.\n", "Q: How do I encrypt/decrypt file within gedit? In the previous version of Ubuntu (eg: maverick, natty), I used to do a:\nsudo apt-get install gedit-plugins seahorse\n\nto have the ability to encrypt/decrypt file within Gedit after enabling the plugin in the preferences.\nBut since, Oneiric I've not found a way of achieving this.\nAnd now that I'm running Precise (the LTS version!), I'm a bit disappointed of not being able to do such things.\n\nA: I had to fight a bit with ryran's example until I got what I needed: encrypt using my GPG key to several people.

You can even add keyboard shortcuts. What the link doesn't mention (as far as I saw) is that you need to install gnupg-agent to be able to enter passphrases.\nHere's an example. Create a new action and call it symmetric encrypt:\ngpg --use-agent --symmetric 2>/dev/null\n\nTweak the other options to your liking (you can make it so all the text in the whole window is automatically selected and replaced, you can make the output pop up in a bottom pane, etc.\nNote: If you install gnupg2 instead of gnupg-agent, and then start your command-lines with gpg2 instead of gpg, you can take advantage of gpg2's cooler [integrated] agent.\n\nA: Just expanding on @Ignacio solution (which works), I found annoying that if you encrypt twice (or decrypt), it breaks things... so I am running this with an extra care for the state of the encryption on the document:\nEncrypt\n#!/bin/bash\nstdin=$(cat)\n\nif [ ! \"${stdin:0:27}\" == \"-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----\"  ]; then \n    echo \"$stdin\" | gpg -a -e -r email@email.com --no-tty -\nelse\n    echo \"$stdin\"\nfi\n\nDecrypt\n#!/bin/bash\nstdin=$(cat)\n\nif [ \"${stdin:0:27}\" == \"-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----\"  ]; then \n    echo \"$stdin\" | gpg -d --no-tty - 2> /dev/null\nelse\n    echo \"$stdin\"\nfi\n\nAssuming the settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Save - Nothing\n\n*Input - Current document\n\n*Output - Replace current document\n\n*Applicability - All documents / All languages\n\n\nThen you place a shortcut like Ctrl+Shift+D (decrypt) and Ctrl+Shift+E (encrypt), and you are good to go.\n", "Q: Run two shell file with thread How i can run two file shell in parallel and do not shared the same jvm. may be i use thread but how i run two file shell bu two thread ?

So I want to disable the tap-as-click (after all, I have buttons for clicks too). \nI open up \"Mouse and Touchpad\" and on the Touchpad tab I check \"Disable touchpad when typing\" and UNcheck \"Enable mouse clicks with touchpad\".

How can I change the language order by command-line (or text editor)? i.e. without using the graphical \"gnome-language-selector\".\n(Or is there a better GUI which allows you to select multiple language entries and move them all to another position directly, without having to do it one by one?)\nAlternatively: Where are the user-specific language settings stored? i.e. the /etc/default/locale for users.\n\nA: List installed locales\nlocale -a\n\nList current settings\nlocale\n\nChanging settings temporarily\nAny environment variable may be set on the command line for the current process:\n$ date\nSat May 14 15:59:12 CEST 2011\n\n$ LC_TIME=zh_CN.UTF-8 \n\n$ date\n2011年 05月 14日 星期六 16:00:13 CEST 2011\n\nChanging settings permanently\nIf you want more fine-grained control, you may manually change your system's locale entries by modifying the file /etc/default/locale.\nFor example on a German system, to prevent system messages from being translated, you may use:\nLANG=de_DE.UTF-8\nLC_MESSAGES=POSIX\n\nNote: changes take effect only after a fresh login.\nFor Additional Hhelp\n\nA: You probably have a line in your ~/.profile file that looks similar to:\nexport LANGUAGE=\"ca_ES:en_GB:en\"\n\nObviously the list of languages will probably be different for you.\nThat is the file that the language selector UI writes to, so if you want to add more languages and change the order manually, you can edit that file with a text editor.

I have separate / and /home partitions, of which both use ext4 as their filesystem.\nHow can I merge them, and what is the easiest way?\n\nA: I don't think there's an easier way. You need to copy the data from one partition to the other. You need to delete the old home partition and resize the root partition. That cannot be done on a running system, so a live CD or USB seems like as good as it gets.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot the live CD/USB.\n\n*Mount the root partition to /mnt/root.\n\n*Mount the home partition to /mnt/oldhome.\n\n*Copy the data using rsync:\nsudo rsync -avz --hard-links --numeric-ids /mnt/oldhome/ /mnt/root/home\n\n\n*Open /mnt/root/etc/fstab and delete the entry for your home partition.\n\n*Unmount the root and home partition and reboot the system. If everything works as expected you can reboot again into the live system and then:\n\n*Open Gparted.\n\n*Delete the old home partition, resize the root partition.\n\n\nThat should be it.\n\nA: I dont know about the easiest or the best approach but here is how I would do it. I would just create folder in / and then copy all data from /home to it. Then I will reboot my system using live cd and delete the partition for /home and rename the folder that I created in / to home and then delete entry for /home in fstab. And the last step would be to resize my root partition to consume empty space created by deleting partition for /home.\n\nA: I know this is an old question, but for anyone like me who are looking for a good solution this tutorial: MERGE (OR RESIZE) THE /HOME PARTITION ON CENTOS 7 worked great for me!\nJust don't forget to do chown -R <USER> /path/to/new/home for all end users. System/program users are fine as well as root, but any users you set up will need that command.\nThe other benefit of this is that you don't need to use the install media, you can just do it from a root terminal, so if your server is of site you'll still be able to do this!\n", "Q: \"Require Installation Of Untrusted Packages\" while upgrading with the update manager \nIt didn't fixed the error.

If you want to install untrusted packages, you must do it at the command line.\nThere are, however, two ways you can stop Update Manager from reporting this error: either remove the untrusted software from your system OR trust the repository in question, as outlined in the answer to the other question ( Updates don't install because of \"untrusted packages\" ).\nThe first step is to find out which repository is causing the problem. You can find this out by typing apt-cache policy ambiance-colors at the command line.\nHowever, a quick google reveals that ambiance-colors and radiance-colors are from ppa:ravefinity-project. So you should be able to fix your problem by typing\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ravefinity-project/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ambiance-colors radiance-colors\n\ntaken from http://www.webupd8.org/2012/01/ambiance-and-radiance-colors-theme-pack.html\n\nA: You can install it via the command line: sudo apt-get install --allow-unauthenticated exiv2.\nTo permanently \"trust\" the repo, execute this: sudo apt-add-repository ppa:pmjdebruijn/darktable-release && sudo apt-get update. I believe that is the PPA you are using.\n\nA: why its saying like that means , the packages you're trying to install are third party software.so if you want to  install them , enable the Canonical Check box at other software Tab  in the settings of update manager and then try again installing . \nhope that helps . \n\nA: I had the same problem. For me, this command worked:\nsudo apt-get update --fix-missing\n\nThe advantage of this compared to the other solutions is its simplicity. You can continue to use the GUI and no need to find out which repository is broken. I found the solution here in a comment. I don't know Ubuntu enough to explain, but I suppose it gets the keys necessary for all the repos to work.\n\nA: Your question is unclear: you \"fix your GUI update\" by fixing the error. The other question will show you what to do.\nYou can deselect whatever of your updates is relying on an untrusted source, or you can go ahead and use the command line to trust that particular source permanently. Once you've done one of these, the message won't pop up. If you do the latter, then the message won't ever appear again for that specific source.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Network installation gives warning, tried with 2-3 images I am trying to install Ubuntu using PXE Boot.

Once the install process works, then make a local repository and test that for installing.\nAlternately, set up the repository and test it by installing packages to other systems (not installations). Once you've got the APT repository working, then use it for installation.\nThere are a number of good documents describing how to do this; one is from Joseph Ruscio; one is from HiddenTao (Ramesh Nair); and one is from Stichting Lone Wolves of the Netherlands. There is also the Debian Repository HowTo.\n\nA: I have met the situation before. I solved the problem by touch an empty file. \nLike\ntouch /var/www/ubuntu/dists/oneiric/restricted/binary-amd64/Packages\n\nHope it's worked for you.\n\nA: I, too, ran into this issue and the most appropriate fix is to disable the Apache \"MultiViews\" setting for the directory that contains the installation tree. That way, Apache will return a 404 error for non-existent files rather than the contents of Packages* (which in this case ends up being 'Packages.gz') as it does with the default setting of MultiViews enabled.\nOnce I made this fix, my installations went off without a hitch.\n", "Q: USB 3.0 hard drive not being mounted on some reboots I have a problem with my external HDD (WD My Book Essential 1TB) working on USB 3.0 port.\nI'm using dual boot setup with Windows 7 and Ubuntu 11.10, both 64 bit.\nWhile I'm running Windows and rebooting back to Windows everything works well. When I'm switching to Ubuntu everything works great as well. But after the first reboot from Ubuntu, neither Windows nor Ubuntu mounts the external drive. I have to reboot the device manually. I suspect that the problem is with unmounting the device on shutdown in Ubuntu.\nThis only happens with USB 3.0 ports. When I plug the same device into USB 2 port the problem doesn't persist.\nDoes anyone have the same problem, or a clue what might going wrong?\n\nA: I had a similar problem.  My Seagate USB3.0 drive was not being recognized at the boot time (neither Windows7 nor Ubuntu).

So I cleared up some space, then reinstalled the most recent kernel images in case the kernels were corrupt. I used:\napt-get install --reinstall linux-2.6.32-33-server\n\n(as one example). Now these reinstalled kernels will bomb out during reboot with a message Unable to locate init. (or similar).\nI could fix this the hard way - by pulling apart the images and finding out why it doesn't work. The root volume is an LVM logical volume formatted with ext4, and the boot GRUB entries match other working entries.\nHowever, I'm sure there's a reason that the package doesn't seem to get it right. I'd like to figure out if I'm doing something wrong with the packages, or if it is something else.\nWhy won't these reinstalled kernels (installed with APT) boot successfully?\n\nA: If the message is unable to find init, and assuming you have other kernels which are working well then the init in question is likely to be the one in the initramfs for the kernel.  I would compare the sizes of the initramfs files for each kernel in /boot.

Here is some basic background information:\nThe computer is custom built (16GB DDR3, i5 Sandy-Bridge @ 3.4 gHz) and has 2 HDD's and 1 SSD they are as follows (also the same chronological order in BIOS boot priority:\n\n*\n\n*64 GB SSD - Windows 7 64-Bit Operating System\n\n\n*160 GB HDD - NFTS File System for program/storage space for Windows\n\n\n*500 GB HDD - EXT4 (currently unalloacted) for Ubuntu 12.04\nHere is how I am planning on breaking up the 500 GB HDD for Ubuntu, once again chronological order from start of the disk:\n\n\n*2GB (SWAP)\n\n\n*25GB Operating System Directory (Primary)\n\n\n*Remainder ext4 home partition (Primary)\nWhat I am wondering, and what I am hoping to achieve is the ability to upgrade my distributions while being able to keep my themes, settings, and files/etc in a seperate partition from the distro. Will this method enable me to do this? Or is there another method that I can take to achieve this? Is the location of my swap file correct? Is the swap file to small/large?\n\nA: One thing you might consider is running Windows from an SSD partition of around 50 GB and installing Ubuntu into the remaining 14 GB.  (Personally, I find Ubuntu runs easily in a 10GB partition.)  This will give very fast boot times for both operating systems.  You have lots of space on the HDD's for data files, etc.  \nIf space is critical on the SSD, and since you have lots of RAM (which defines the size of the page file and hibernation file), you can move the Windows page file to the HDD.  With 16 GB of RAM, you may never use the page file; however, I read that some programs insist on the file being available.  On my desktop system I also erased the hibernation file since I never use that feature on the desktop machine.  \nI have Windows 7 (36 GB), a shared data drive (8GB), Ubuntu (10 GB) and a swap area (1.8 GB) all running happily on an SSD, with the Windows page file and tons of data/backup space on an secondary HDD. \n\nA: @CentaurusA got my +1 vote. Same with my opinion. / must go inside SSD. That would increase speed of system jobs dramatically. Like sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade. It would be much faster.\n\n\n*\n\n*/ - enough with 8G~15G. Mine was always 8G. Don't go far from 15G MAX.\n\n*swap - You don't need this. If your system need more ram than 16G, that's time for fix problem. Not turning on swap.\n\n*/home - Saprate home partition good for easy reinstall or upgrade.\n\n\nPlease give super sweet SSD to Ubuntu! :)\n\nA: The usual way to preserve your personal settings is to put /home onto a separate partition. Doing this will allow you to install a fresh copy of Ubuntu with the ability to preserve - and not format - your /home partition.\nFor updating an Ubuntu installation, this is less critical as it is not necessary to wipe out anything during the update. It can be a good idea to partition this way anyway.\nYour swap could potentially be anywhere (even on the filesystem!) but at the beginning of the disk is fine - I always make it a primary partition.\nIf you are dual-booting, you may want to consider mounting your NTFS volume inside Linux and using it as a volume that is shared between Linux and Windows. It is even possible to share your swap space between Windows and Linux - although this requires formatting for Linux each time you want to use it.\n\nA: Your swap isn't enough for hibernating, but if you don't want it, it's more than enough (because you have 16GB ram, it won't run out of memory) if you want hibernating, just use about 20GB or more.\n\nA: You can have a /home partition if you want, but it really isn't needed.  Upgrades never destroy data, and you can reinstall Ubuntu without formatting the partition, thus preserving your data.  You just need to make sure that the format box is not checked.\n", "Q: How do we install Java in Wine? I have a Windows file.exe and I need Wine and Java to open it.

Very nice. I dual boot it with Windows and have run it on VirtualBox. I hope to transition from Windows to Linux this year. I have many files in various NTFS partitions on multiple drives. They all show up and look right. However, today while browsing the files I ran into a problem. I opened a 278GB NTFS partition that contains many pictures and videos in various folders. When I went to a subfolder containing 48675 files, the app window showed the first N entries but became unresponsive so that I could not scroll. I was in \"list\" view and could see in the \"size\" column that for some of folders it said \"nnnn entries\". For others it said \"...\" or something like that. While I watched one of the folder size fields changed from \"...\" to \"2716 entries\". It seemed that the file viewer app was looking at every file directory entry on this logical drive and doing so very slowly. I waited 10 minutes. I went to close the window but Ubuntu said it was not responding and asked me if I want to force it to close. I cancelled the close, and instead minimized the window. When I tried to reopen it a minute later it would not open. I then shut down and noticed that during shutdown there was a brief error message mentioning error/interrupt #15.\nBack in Windows, I ran a check of that drive partition. No errors were found. It is fully defragmented. In Windows I can navigate the files on that drive very quickly. Can anyone suggest a fix? This could be a showstopper for my migration to Linux.

Installed packages will not be removed unless they are unused ...\n\nwhereas man apt-get says:\n\n-upgrade ...under no circumstances are currently installed packages removed ...\n\n\nA: The apt-get command closer to aptitude safe-upgrade is upgrade, but there is a difference.\naptitude safe-upgrade upgrades currently installed packages and can install new packages to resolve new dependencies, but never removes packages.\napt-get upgrade upgrades currently installed packages, but never installs or removes packages.\nSo apt-get upgrade is comparable to aptitude --no-new-installs safe-upgrade.\n\nA: I think that the equivalent would be:\napt-get --with-new-pkgs upgrade\n\nAnd the key is that --with-new-pkgs allow installing new packages when used in conjunction with upgrade so it basically do the same thing than aptitude safe-upgrad, install upgrades and new packages that are needed by this updates.\n\nA: Combining PhoenixS's command and Roland Becker's comment about removal of unused packages (and double checking all this in the man pages of aptitude and apt-get), it would appear that the command using apt-get that completely mimics the behvaiour of aptitude safe-upgrade is\napt-get upgrade --with-new-pkgs --autoremove\nThis has been tested once on Ubuntu 16.04, and it at least ran, removing some packages and upgrading some other packages, but not installing any new packages (guess it was not necessary in that context)\n", "Q: How do I install modelsim6.5f? the following errors are occuring while installing modelsim6.5f in ubuntu11.10\nsudo apt-get install install.linux\n\nWhich results in\nReading package lists...

My hoster ( hetzner.de ) does not give me the possibility of doing an inplace downgrade, so I have to create a new server. What is the best way to make an image of the first system and \"apply it\" to the new one ? I know there other answer but in my situation I am not sure I would be able to use Clonezilla or other GUI tools, because the installation is minimal with no GUI. \nThanks in advance\nMichele\n\nA: This sounds like a job for, queue music; Rsync!\nEdit: I mis-read the question, so let me update;\nThis sounds like a job for, queue music; Tar and Rsync!\n\nA: I did the downgrade in this way.\nFirst of all I upgraded the old system by using \"aptitude update\" and \"aptitude upgrade\". So that the version was 10.04.4.\nThen I archived with TAR utility the whole disk of the old system. I did it while the old system was online and stored the resulting archive on the old system.\nThen I created a new base virtual machine with the webhoster utilites. At this point I had the problem to be able to overwrite existing files which were in use. So I needed to have a sort of Live Cd ( like Jeff suggested above )\nNot being able to boot from a live CD, I used the webhoster rescue system to have a similar effect. When you boot into this, you can mount read and write the actual system.\nSo  I expanded with TAR the archive in a /NEW directory, and then I copied the varioust dir like var, usr, ... etc.. I renamed the existing with the suffix OLD. Then I rebooted, hoping that all was ok. There we some problems, however.\nOn the first reboot, the drive could not be mounted. The reason was that on the new system the drive was formatted with EXT4, while in /etc/fstab there were the settings of the old system, which was EXT3. So I rebooted again in the rescue system and take the original fstab in the new system.\nAt the next reboot, drives were mounted, however the system could not get an IP address. \nThe reason was that, since I had completely overwritten the /etc dir also network config. I did not know how to reconfigure, so I grep to find in the text files eth0. I found many entries, but the one to fix was the one referring to the MAC address. Once restored to the actual MAC address of the interface of the new system network was working again.\nOK, now I tested if apache and mysql were working. None of them was working. \nIt turned out to be a problem of permissions. I am not sure about this, may be I forgot to add the p prefix to TAR ( which should preserve permissions )\nIn order to avoid setting permission manually, I used this time RSYNC to copy again the files from the old server. It seemed that RSYNC restored the permission, because after this I could start my blog. \nNow another error is logged related to log rotating. Sure it's again a problem of permission.\nAt the end, sure I think my method was not very professional, that was the reason I asked here :)\n\nA: First back up your mysql database\nmysqldump --add-drop-table -h mysqlhostserver -u mysqlusername -p databasename (tablename tablename tablename) | bzip2 -c > blog.bak.sql.bz2\n\nFor additional options see: http://codex.wordpress.org/Backing_Up_Your_Database\nThen archive (tar) , include /etc , /var/www , and any other data you might have for your ftp server (I assume you use it for updating wordpress).\nTransfer the archive to your new server and restore your mysql database and any data and custom settings in /etc (apache).\n", "Q: Disabling / Remapping Logitech G400 mouse DPI buttons I had the Logitech MX-518 mouse, but it had been having issues with responsiveness, causing me to call support for a replacement. Instead of another 518, they sent me a Logitech G400 mouse because the 518 has been discontinued. This causes issues because, while the MX518 was supported by lomoco, the G400 mouse is unsupported. Running $ lomoco -s shows 001.003: 046d:c245 Unsupported Logitech device: Unknown.\nWhat I would like to do is lock the DPI of my mouse to a single value and remap the DPI+ and DPI- buttons to PgUp and PgDn on my keyboard.\nHow would I accomplish this?\n\nThe buttons are, in order:\n\n\n*\n\n*Button 1: Left-click\n\n*Button 2: Middle-click\n\n*Button 3: Right-click\n\n*Button 4: Mouse Wheel Up\n\n*Button 5: Mouse Wheel Down\n\n*Button 6: None\n\n*Button 7: None\n\n*Button 8: Thumb Button #1\n\n*Button 9: Thumb Button #2\n\n*Button 10: Task Switcher Button\n\n*Button 11: None\n\n*Button 12: None\n\n\nOn the previous mouse (MX 518), buttons 11 and 12 were the DPI keys. One of the things that makes these buttons different than the rest is that applications such as xev do not recognize pressing them as an event, by default. On the MX 518 mouse, in order to make those buttons able to be altered / binded, they had to first be disabled.

I did some testing on my own, and eventually was able to figure out the codes to send the signal to switch the mouse into \"Driver Mode\", which then allowed me to use easygestures/xev to reassign the buttons.\nIf you want, I can walk you through the steps I used to determine how to switch it off (I now have a script that I simply need to run on startup, as a very hack-y workaround, but it's working at least), but it involves setting up a VM and having a secondary mouse and sniffing the raw USB traffic, and unfortunately seems likely to be very mouse-specific.\nMy steps (better ones almost certainly exist):\n1) Have a Windows VM (with the Logitech SetPoint software installed; I used VirtualBox, because that's what I already had set up with WinXP for work), Wireshark, and gcc installed on your system.\n2) Then I ran the following steps in a terminal:\nsudo modprobe usbmon\nsudo wireshark &\nsudo /usr/lib/virtualbox/VirtualBox &\n\n3) Within Wireshark, choose to 'List the available capture interfaces...', and make a note of which USB bus number generates a ton of packets when you move your mouse around (mine was usbmon3, but I imagine that's purely based on which USB port your receiver is plugged in to).\n3) From within VirtualBox (I needed to run as sudo in order to share the USB Controller), I edited the settings of the XP VM, and enabled both the USB Controller and the USB 2.0 (EHCI) Controller. Then I added a new USB Filter populated from an existing device, and selected my Logitech mouse's receiver (Vendor ID 046d, Product c245, for you) and then started up the VM. \n(Note: After this point, I needed a second mouse plugged in, because I had to give control over my regular mouse to the Windows VM so that the SetPoint software could see that it existed as something more than a generic mouse.)\n4) In the VM, I then launched the SetPoint software, and went to the screen that lets you set custom actions for various buttons. Then back in Wireshark, I started a capture on the USB bus for the mouse, then immediately went in to the VM/SetPoint, and changed the button assignment from DPI +/- to Keystroke Assignment, then immediately went back to Wireshark and stopped the capture. (I repeated this about 10-15 more times, changing the settings to different modes, mostly because I wasn't sure how much data I'd need, but after reviewing, I really only needed the first 1-2 captures.)\nAssuming your mouse works vaguely similar to mine, which I'd guess it would, your capture would likely have a total of 16 frames, 4x GET DESCRIPTOR, then 3x(2xURB_CONTROL out + 2xURB_INTERRUPT in). What you're looking for are the 3 longer URB_CONTROL out frames. An example of one of my captured frames is: \n0000  c0 80 64 36 00 88 ff ff  53 02 00 03 03 00 00 00\n0010  5e 4b 25 50 00 00 00 00  f4 d9 08 00 8d ff ff ff\n0020  07 00 00 00 07 00 00 00  21 09 10 02 01 00 07 00\n0030  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n0040  10 01 80 65 82 85 ff\n\nWhat we're looking for are the last 7 bytes from the response (in the above, the '10 01 80 65 82 85 ff'), from each of the longer 'URB_CONTROL out' frames. Finally, I downloaded the source of the \"g_hack\" from Git, and cobbled in both my mouse product code at the top, and a new option (I set it to 0/1 with an if statement within them since it was just a very crude proof of concept) which would switch my mouse into \"driver mode\" or \"DPI mode\".\nAfter that, all that was required was to set up the newly available mouse buttons in your choice of remapping programs (I used easygestures because that was the first thing with a UI I found - it may or may not have a superior replacement).\n", "Q: Do I need to restore iptable rules everytime on boot? Every time I reboot I loose the iptables rules that took me so looong to enter. I know I can save them and restore them on boot, but is there anyway to save them forever? Do I really need to restore them on boot every time? Seriously?\nThe problem is I have a HUGE list of IPs in which I use a while loop to load them in. This can take upwards of 10 minutes. \nThis is my home FTP server. It's a small vm with 1gb ram and very little processing power. There are so many IPs because I've pretty much given up on the Asian continent. I don't need them to be hitting up my FTP server everyday with brute force. I also block gov. monitors, trackers and spammers. \nThis is the while loop I use to load in the list.\ngrep INPUT block.list | while read LISTA; do sudo iptables -A $LISTA; done\n\n\nA: apt-get install iptables-persistent\n\nOn install, it should save your current iptables config. Otherwise you can save them to these files (depending on v4 or v6) and iptables-persistent will load them on boot :)\niptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4\nip6tables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v6\n\n\nA: First, create a file with the contents of iptables-save:\nsudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables_rules\n\nIt doesn't really matter where you put the file, all you have to do is make sure that the next line refers to the same file.  Next, open /etc/rc.local and add this line:\n/sbin/iptables-restore < /etc/iptables_rules\n\nFrom now on, every time your computer powers up or restarts iptables will load rules from the file that you specified.\n\nA: If you do have a lot of rules you should also consider using ipset in conjunction with iptables. Ipset uses an indexed database table and is a lot faster than iptables when looking up an address to decide whether to accept or deny. \nhttp://ipset.netfilter.org/index.html\n", "Q: is there a use case for `apt-get install` without `update`? Every time I see instructions to run apt-get install, it says to run apt-get updatefirst. Same for upgrade and dist-upgrade.\nWhy doesn't install automatically do update? Is there a case where you don't want that?\n\nA: apt-get update updates the lists of available packages and their version numbers.\nThe use case you are searching for could be: If you want to run apt-get install twice in a short time, you only need to run apt-get update once because the package lists are unlikely to have been changed in the meantime.\n\nA: As mentioned in the other answer, apt-get update updates the list of available packages. So, unless the list of available packages has changed, it's simply wasting time and (not much) bandwith.\nThe reason why you often see apt-get update before apt-get install is twofold:\n\n\n*\n\n*Often this is in the context of adding a PPA or some other package source; in this case, you obviously need to update the list of available packages because the first thing you've done is to add to the list of available packages.\n\n*During the development period the archives are changing quite rapidly; there can be hundreds of changes to the package lists over the course of a day, so it will often make sense to apt-get update first so you don't try to download a version that's no longer available. Once the distro is released the number of changes drops dramatically - generally down to no more than a couple each week. There's little point in running apt-get update before an install in this case.\n\n\nA: Besides having run sudo apt-get update very recently, there are a few other situations where you might decide not to run it before running sudo apt-get install ...:\n\n\n*\n\n*You are installing software from a local software source that is already configured, such as a CD/DVD or USB flash drive with an Ubuntu ISO burned/written to it.\n\n*You know you have the package you wish to install cached locally (in /var/cache/apt/archives), either from it being installed before, or having run sudo apt-get --download-only install ..., and you want to install it from there rather than downloading it.\n(Perhaps you want to do something with that version even if it isn't the latest, or your Internet connection is very slow, or you are not connected to the Internet.)\n\n*You know there is no later version of the package available. For example, the Launchpad page for nano in Ubuntu shows that only the \"release\" versions are available--nothing is available in \"security\" or \"updates\" or \"proposed.\" (In contrast, you can see that firefox in Ubuntu does have such updates.)\n\n*You want to save time, even at the risk of possibly installing an older package than the recommended version, or even of the installation failing because the package your system wants to install is no longer available, or is listed as having dependencies that are no longer available, or that conflict with some newer software already on your system. \nIf your system is configured to check for updates automatically and is connected to the Internet 24/7, this risk might be considered low enough to forego manually running sudo apt-get update most of the time (see RAOF's answer and the comments there).\n", "Q: Sharing my home folders with other users on the same PC After reviewing similar questions on the same subject Im still none the wiser.  I want to share my music, pictures and video folders with other users on my pc.  I am using 11.10 and will be upgrading to 12.04. The method I have tried is to right click on the folder (as Administrator), select \"Sharing Options\" check all the necessary fields and give the share a name like \"music-shared\".  Another dialog pops up then and I select \"Set nautilus Permissions\".\nWhen the other user logs on they go to their Home folder click on the network and can see the \"music-shared\" folder, but they get a message that the do not have the necessary permissions to view the content.

Alternatively, you can\nallow everyone access);\n\n*Set yourself as owner, and group as mediamembers (sudo chown -R\nyourname:mediamembers /shared;  alternatively, just set the\npermissions for /shared to whatever you want for group and the rest\nof the world;\n\n*Create subdirectories for video, music, pictures, and move the files there from your home\ndirectory; \n\n*Create symbolic links to these directories in you home directory's\nsubdirectories;\n\n*In the future, follow the symbolic link to the shared directory to save files.\n\n\nYou could even mount the directory, and in the future, if your media collection got too big, you could put it on a separate disk and mount that in the same place with no changes for the users.\nI have mine on a separate partition to solve a different problem, which is to easily access these file when I install a new distro for testing, etc.  I just mount the shared partition, and have everything there.\n", "Q: Tab autocomplete in terminal is not behaving properly There's something odd about my autocomplete in the gnome terminal.\nI used to be able to type cp Downtab to get cp Downloads/, and then type Jettab to end up with cp Downloads/Jet\\ Pack\\ Instructions.pdf\nBut now, when I have cp Down typed and hit tab, I get cp Downloads with a space afterwards.

How do I fix this?\nEDIT: There's a problem with my /etc/bash_completion file, it seems.

It doesn't save your history forever, so it's possible the old one scrolled off the list.  It's also possible that this file got corrupted somehow.\nIt should be just a long list of commands, in reverse chronological order, with each command on a single line, delimited by linebreaks, so you should be able to see if there's something unusual in it.\nI never really thought about this, but you could probably save lines you use a lot, and occasionally append it to this file to make sure you always have those commands.\nA better suggestion for Tab Autocompletion\nDid you edit this? I don't think it changes, so maybe it's something that was added to /etc/bash_completion.d, which seems to have scripts added to it by installed apps. You could try disabling some of the ones with more recent timestamps to see if it makes a difference, then adding them back one by one or in small groups until it changes.

However, I don't want to spend two weeks setting up my system to fit me as it does right now, so I thought that I can make just a hard copy of all the contents to the new disk (using dd). \nMy question is: is it going to work? :-) What are the things that need to be changed, except fstab?\n\nA: Using dd like this:\ndd if=/dev/old_drive of=/dev/new_drive bs=100M\n\nmay work just fine. The option bs=100M should improve performance.\nHowever you should be concerned of the following issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have proof that your hard drive is in a state of dying, then\nit's not recommended to stress the drive any further than needed.\nBackup the necessary data first, after that you can still do a full\ncopy of the drive.\n\n*While talking about backups: Don't just do a copy from one drive to\nthe other! Do a backup, restore from that backup to the new drive and\nvalidate your backup in that way. You don't know how long the new\ndrive will last, it may already be faulty, you never know.\n\n*Copying the whole old drive including its metrics to the new drive is\nbad:\n\n*\n\n*Performance loss due to false alignment. Partitions on newer drives with \n4K layout have to be properly aligned. Just create new partitions on \nthe new drive with tools like GParted and select alignment to 1 MB \nboundaries. Download the latest Ubuntu Live CD, it already contains\nGParted and while you're at it, make sure you have a copy of the Live \nCD from the Ubuntu version you have currently installed, you will \nneed it for reinstalling GRUB to the newly partitioned drive.\n\n*Performance loss due to fragmented files. Now is the best chance to start\nfresh and new. Create a new file system and copy the data,\ndefragmentation is done auto magically. :)\n\n*Writing to SSDs with dd is a bad idea. For example with activated TRIM support, you will loose some of your data after a few hours until your file system is corrupt. TRIM and dd don't play nice. (TRIM is enabled via the discard option for EXT4 in fstab, other file systems have other options, you might want to look that up in the man pages of the corresponding mount command for the file system)\n\n*Partition sizes and file systems are not adjusted. If the new drive is large enough, you will get all your data and partitions onto the drive, but the available space will still be the same. You will have to use either all-in-one partitioning tools like GParted or resize2fs and the likes to adjust the file system size to the new partition size.\n\n\n\nThat said, I recommend you better go with rsync (options -ap should suffice, boot from Live CD and start the rsync job there) to make a backup, create a new partition layout on the new drive (if you have been using EXT3, now is the time to switch to EXT4, but no more fancy stuff, btrfs is still not stable), restore from the backup to the new drive, install GRUB to the new drive with the --boot-directory method (you are still using the Live CD) and replace the UUIDs in /etc/fstab, /boot/grub/grub.cfg and /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume (latter one is for the swap partition to be used by suspend to disk) to reflect the new configuration.\nThat's mostly it. A bit more work, but safer and with the feeling of a fresh deployed system without reinstalling.\n\nA: You should be fine. Make sure you can access the files on the backup drive before you do the deed though, just in case.  \n", "Q: How to maintain symlinks in linux file manager? I want to use symlinks extensively. However, if I move the target file, the symlink becomes broken (unlike on Windows). That's not acceptable to me, so I either need a solution or I won't be able to use symlinks the way I wish to.\nIs there a solution that will work with Dolphin file manager?\nA command line solution is described on commandlinefu.

Why? The program 'javac' can be found in the following packages:\n * openjdk-6-jdk\n * ecj\n * gcj-4.4-jdk\n * gcj-4.6-jdk\n * gcj-4.5-jdk\n * openjdk-7-jdk\n\nThen I run sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk and everything works. But then javac still does not exist and I get the same error as above. Same thing with openjdk-6-jdk. Why?\n\nA: Not sure if this helps, but it worked for me. I had this problem, javac was simply not there, anywhere, probably because I only installed the jre. Installing the jdk after the jre fixed it.\nsudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre\nsudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk\n\nAfterwhich set the configurations by following the prompt:\nsudo update-alternatives --config java\nsudo update-alternatives --config javac\n\nThen you can check if you configured correctly with:\njava -version\njavac -version\n\n\nA: The proper Debian/Ubuntu way to configure which javac is pointed to by /usr/bin/javac is to use the update-alternatives command. You can do it interactively, and select from a list of available options:\nsudo update-alternatives --config javac\n\nOr you can specify which option you want on the command-line:\nsudo update-alternatives --set javac /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk/bin/javac\n\nBecause of the way it stores the information, using update-alternatives is not exactly equivalent (but instead is considered preferable) to manually making /usr/bin/java a symbolic link to your javac of choice. See man update-alternatives for more information about this.\nIf update-alternatives doesn't work, then run this command and try again:\nsudo ln -s /etc/alternatives/javac /usr/bin/javac\n\n\nA: Here's what I did.  It worked.\nFirst I installed the jdk for Java 7 like this:\nsudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk\nThat might be enough: check and see if javac in your PATH by running javac -version\nIf not, then follow Nicholas' answer except that instead of sudo update-alternatives --config javac use this:\nsudo update-alternatives --config java\nAnd selected Java 7 at at the the prompt by typing 2:\nThere are 2 choices for the alternative java (providing /usr/bin/java).\n\n  Selection    Path                                            Priority   Status\n------------------------------------------------------------\n  0            /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java   1061      auto mode\n  1            /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java   1061      manual mode\n* 2            /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java   1051      manual mode\n\nPress enter to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number:\n\n\nA: As long as the install completed without errors, there is a javac executable on your system; it for some reason just didn't get correctly linked to /usr/bin. sudo ln -s /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk/bin/javac /usr/bin/javac will create that link and should fix your problem.\n", "Q: What happens when I drop a file on archive in Nautilus? I had this file structure:\n2000/\n  001.txt\n  002.txt\n  003.txt\n  ...\n2001/\n  ...\n2002/\n  ...\n...\n2011/\n\nI guess file structure doesn't matter, but anyway...\nSo folders are representing couple of years with some text files inside.\nNow I compress all, with Nautilus compress context menu (archive manager) in tar.gz format. I choose this format as although it requires more space then bz2, it's lot faster when I need to query data inside.\nAfter this I create helper text file with references about archive contents (170 KB in size) and wanted to add it to archive, so I just drag & drop this file onto created archive in Nautilus.  \nTwo bad things happen:\n\n\n*\n\n*Droping file onto archive extracts whole archive in temp folder then re-compresses all files again! This is just awful for large archives, and I hope to find better way in Terminal later\n\n*Initial archive was ~ 96 MB in size, and now just by adding this 170 KB text file, archive become 140 MB! I checked inside it's same content + this tiny text file\nWhy is this?\n\nI just created archive with contents from two subfolders, than drag&drop file with size of 100 bytes:\n$ gzip -l tmp-original.tar.gz\n         compressed        uncompressed  ratio uncompressed_name\n           13297512            69908480  81.0% tmp-original.tar\n$ gzip -l tmp-updated.tar.gz \n         compressed        uncompressed  ratio uncompressed_name\n           19231941            69908480  72.5% tmp-updated.tar\n\n\nA: As a note on point one, as a far as I can tell, the tar terminal command cannot append files to a compressed archive (ex. your .gz archive), and hence needs first to uncompress the archive, then add the appended file, and recompress again.\nA workaround could be mounting your compressed archive using archivemount (instructions here), which allows you to mount your compressed archive, append files, and unmount it. Whether this is speedier than uncompressing, appending and recompressing, I cannot say.\n", "Q: wireless woes Ubuntu won't hook up to my built in hardware gateway laptop I installed ubuntu on my lap top that runs winxp, I really like ubuntu and will probably get rid of windows all together, but ubuntu won't access my built in wirless or wi-fi.

I installed CompizConfig-Settings-Manager and I put on all the settings I liked and had in 11.10, including the ability to drag my windows to the adjacent workspace. It's under the Desktop Wall section, on the Edge Flipping tab and I've checked \"Edge Flip Move\" and \"Edge Flip DnD.\"\nIn 11.10, the movement was smooth between each workspace, and the window would still be \"grabbed\" in the same place. In 12.04, it's leaving the window behind and the mouse appears to be \"grabbing\" nothing, but I'm still holding onto the window, and I can still move and place it within the workspace (or indeed the previous workspace as it won't appear in the desired place until I drag the mouse all the way to the edge of the screen).\nAny way to fix this? I'm running 12.04 beta 2.\n\nA: Should work using the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl+Alt+Shift+D-pad (on the D-pad use the arrow key pointing to the direction of the destination workspace of the migrating window). That works in all Linux desktops that I've tried, whether it be Unity, Gnome Shell, Xfce, LXDE, etc. Tried it on Gnome Shell on Ubuntu 12.04 and still works (granted Gnome Shell stacks workspaces strictly on a vertical scale, but you should be able to use any direction if you have a workspace left, right, above and below the workspace you are currently on...diagonal directions work too).\n\n\nA: This is a known bug:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/compiz/+bug/965577\nRead the comments, there are some almost-solutions provided.\n", "Q: Is new Multi-Monitor feature on 12.04 working with nvidia binary driver?

BUT, a note about drivers. For me the drivers offered by the OEM (ASUS) were not the most up to date for the Kernel on 11.10. I had to go to the website of the wifi chip manufacturer (Realtek) to get the correct drivers. Major headache to figure that out, especially for inexperienced linux users. For those drivers, go here: http://218.210.127.131/search/default.aspx?keyword=rtl8192\nAdditionally, I messed with the MTU setting in the wireless options. Even before I installed the new drivers that helped alleviate the problem (I suppose I was losing packets or soemthing). That may have also contributed to the fix. \nBest of luck.\n\nA: I'm not a \"geek\", But this also happened to me and I had to bootig from other programs to get back on the net, which you did also I presume;\nThis is what worked for me- In 'Edit Connections'- Under the connections at the top of the screen,go to \"Connection Name\"- this should be Auto(eth0)-MTU should be automatic-IPv 4 settings should be-Method: Automatic(DHCP). MAKE sure BOTH (Require IP4addressing for this connection to complete), And (Available to all users), are BOTH ticked in the little box, And IP v 6 settings-Method:Ignore, and tick the available to all users box.\n             This worked for me, hope it works for you also\n\n", "Q: Flash Webcam non responsive I've got the same problem as this gentleman: https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/flashplugin-nonfree/+question/176541\nWhere the webcam settings / access does not work at all / is completely unresponsive in Ubuntu 11.10.\nI've tried webcam access in Facebook, Google+, my own code + a number of tutorials/demos and none work.\nWhat happens is the settings dialogue is completely unresponsive. Clicking tabs or buttons does nothing.\nIn the question linked to a suggested answer is to run Unity 2D. Unfortunately this does not work for me (the exact same thing happens). I've also tried Gnome 3 which also does not work.\nNote that it is only the webcam settings that don't work. YouTube videos and annoying banners work just fine.\nDoes anyone know of a workaround for this (except going back to 11.04) or if they've fixed this in 12.04? - also, are any of you experiencing the same thing?\n\nA: In my case the workaround suggested here did work: http://www.ironzebra.com/news/42/how-to-get-flash-webcam-to-work-on-ubuntu-linux .\nIt requires to manually insert allowed sites.\n\nA: As suggested in one of the replies to the question in the link in my question (what a sentence); logging into Unity 2D may solve it. It did not work for me. What did work, however, was logging into Gnome Classic (No Effects). From there I could interact with the settings dialog and enable webcam and microphone access for the sites I need it. After that, going back to Unity (normal) the webcam is activated.\n\nA: It is a bug. And it has not been solved in 12.04 yet. See https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/865672.\n\nA: Yes, it's an annoying problem with flash. The settings are not editable via right-click.\nTo solve this you can reach them from the flash-player-properties utility.\n\nA: Find Adobe Flash Player Settings app. Configure it (see photo 2).\n\nFor Google+:\nAre you installed GTalk plug-in? You need it for Google Talk video chat. If you are not installed it, install it from Ubuntu Software Centre. \n\nA: I recently converted (I hesitate to say \"upgraded\" as I'm yet to reach any hint of satisfaction) to 11.10 with Unity (not 2D), and as described, my USB camera stopped working on flash sites, with the options panel simply frozen and inaccessible. \nHowever, I was able to get it working by going to the Adobe configuration page, where I was able to access the configuration options for my system. I located the website that I wished to allow access to the camera (I leave global permission set to \"Ask\" generally), change it to \"Always allow\" for that site only, and then refreshed the page I wish to use.

To the best of my knowledge, all shortcuts in the Unity Launcher have a corresponding *.desktop file. I have one shortcut (for skrooge) that doesn't have an icon. How can I find the *.desktop file corresponding to this shortcut so that I can add an icon to it?\n\nA: Desktop files of snap packages can be found in /var/lib/snapd/desktop/applications/ and below /snap/.\n\nA: I know I'm late to the party, but I have a faster solution than the one accepted as the answer:\nfind / -iname \"*desktop\" -type f -not -path \"/media*\" -exec grep -il skrooge '{}' ';' 2> /dev/null\n\nIt's faster because it doesn't search the data mounted file systems and most probably the desktop file is located in the system partition.\nMoreover, it's more likely to find what the command from the accepted answer would miss. That's because the desktop files doesn't have to hold the application name. This command actually searches the text in every desktop file.\n\nA: The system stores the .desktop files in /usr/share/applications/. Unfortunately, if you open that folder in nautilus the .desktop files appears with the icon specified in the file and with the file name called out within the file. You also won't be allowed to edit these files by clicking on them and selecting edit. \nTo edit these files, you need to open that folder within a terminal window. Doing an ls command will show all the .desktop files with their actual names. When you locate the .desktop you wish to change, run gksudo gedit {file-name}.desktop. \nIt's normal practice to keep any .desktop files you create or edit in your home folder ~/.local/share/applications.\n\nA: Some additional details to supplement the other answers:\nTypically, .desktop files for packages will be located in /usr/share/applications.\nIf you want, you could copy one to ~/.local/share/applications and edit it there without needing sudo. Items in ~/.local/share/applications will override matching items in /usr/share/applications and /usr/local/share/applications, but are only visible to your user.\nAlternatively, you could place an edited copy in /usr/local/share/applications where it will override any in /usr/share/applications while also being visible to the entire system.\nNote that you should not edit the .desktop files in /usr/share/applications directly; any changes you make will be automatically overwritten when the application is updated by the package manager.\nExtracted from here\n\nA: It's probably sitting in /usr/share/applications/ but if you want to find every .desktop file on the system run this:\nfind / -name '*.desktop'\n\nor\nsudo updatedb\nlocate *.desktop\n\nTo find files with \"skrooge\" in their path or name, add a grep to the command:\nlocate *.desktop | grep -iR \"skrooge\"\n\n\nA: You can find all directories with desktop files in the XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variable. The *.desktop files can be in the applications directory in each of the directory in that variable. E.g.:\n> echo $XDG_DATA_DIRS\n/usr/share/ubuntu:/usr/local/share/:/usr/share/:/var/lib/snapd/desktop\n\nYou can use this bash script to list all desktop files used by the system (e.g. to build the panel or applications menu):\nfor p in ${XDG_DATA_DIRS//:/ }; do \n  find $p/applications -name '*.desktop' \ndone\n\nIt seems that desktop files can also be placed in one more directory, which isn't in the XDG_DATA_DIRS variable:\n\n*\n\n*~/.local/share/applications\nSo, the complete script to find all *.desktop files in the system is:\nDATA_DIRS=\"$XDG_DATA_DIRS:$HOME/.local/share\"\nfor p in ${DATA_DIRS//:/ }; do\n  find $p/applications -name '*.desktop' \ndone\n\nI didn't find any documentation for this but there's some information about this environment variable here: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/531664\n\nA: *\n\n*/usr/share/applications (most applications, admin rights)\n\n*~/.local/share/applications (personal ones)\n\n\nA: I do not actually now which .desktop file becomes effective.

I close a window, and the next time I open that app, the window might be small, big, or as big as the screen, but not maximized.\nIs this a Linux thing?  Is it the window manager, or the app?\n\nA: This is both a Window manager and an application-specific thing. Window managers such as Compiz are able to remember the size of your windows and open them in the last used sized if setup correctly. However, on Lubuntu, the Window Manager is Openbox, which does not support this feature.\nSome applications handle this themselves, and some even have it in their preferences. If you really need this feature you can use Compiz.

I'd like to set up Linux to cache some commonly requested URLs so that it doesn't have to go out to the net to get them every time.

There are many other URLs I'd like to cache as well.\nIs there an app for that?\n\nA: Yes, these \"apps\" are called HTTP proxies and one example for a HTTP proxy is squid which can be installed like this:\nsudo apt-get install squid3\n\nAfter installation you have to configure your program to use localhost:3128 or to use the system wide proxy settings if this is supported by your application. The system wide proxy settings can be configured in your network settings.\nAnother possibility is to configure squid as a transparent proxy. In that case you don't have to configure your applications but it can be more difficult to setup.\nEither way you should check the squid configuration to fine-tune the cache settings if the default settings don't work well for you.\nSee the Squid Homepage or the Ubuntu Wiki page for Squid for documentation.\n", "Q: Ubuntu no longer recognises HDD partition as writable but Windows does?

If the filesystem is still read-only, install ntfs-config and run it to check if NTFS support is properly configured.\n\nA: You might want to check how the drive is mounted with options like the following in fstab:\niocharset=utf8,file_mode=0777,dirmode=0777 0 0 (not the most secure way to do this...)\n", "Q: clean history script not working I'm creating a script to run in the start up that says:\n_cleanthehistory ()\n{\n/bin/echo \"cleaning the history\"\nhistory -c\n}\n_cleanthehistory\n\nThe deal here is that this does not work from the script, but if I run it from the command line works.\nAny ideas?\nThanks in advance.\nPablo.\n\nA: As I said in my comment history -c just deletes the history of the current session, i.e. only the commands your script ran. To clear all data including old sessions you'll have to do something like\nrm -f $HOME/.bash_history\n\n\nA: History is only enabled for interactive shells, not scripts. So in a script, history -c won't do much good. If you just want to empty your user's bash history during boot, as /tmp is emptied during boot, just truncate or delete ~/.bash_history.\necho \"cleaning the history\"\n> /home/yourusername/.bash_history\n\nThis uses shell redirection without a command. It makes the shell just open the file for writing (truncating it if it already exists), then close it without writing anything to it (since there's no command to write anything to it).\nOn a side note, don't use absolute paths to commands in scripts. E.g. use echo, not /bin/echo.\nupdate: Or if you don't want to save bash history at all, you could put something like HISTFILE=/dev/null in your ~/.bashrc.\n", "Q: Upgrade from Linux Mint 12 to Kubuntu 12.04? Is there an \"easy\" way to \"upgrade\" my existing Linux Mint 12 install to Kubuntu 12.04 beta 2?\nI know I could reinstall. Usually I would do a clean install to avoid unexpected issues. But in this case, I don't have time to reconfigure everything from my printers to my installed software, so I am looking for the quick/easy way, but I also want to avoid big risks of an upgrade gone wrong.\nI'm hoping to just change some repos and run a few commands from the terminal. I don't mind editing a few config files as long as I can find good HOWTOs. But I don't want to be the pioneer (arrows in back). I'm hoping someone has done this before and has a set of steps.\nFor context, I recently installed KDE 4.8 SC onto Kubuntu 11.10 using PPAs. This was on another computer. That wasn't a problem. But I decided to do a fresh install of Kubuntu 12.04 later. I like it well enough that I want to change my other computer from Linux Mint 12 to Kubuntu. (I'm going all-in with KDE. It's now my desktop of choice.)\nThis Linux Mint upgrade will be a move from Gnome and MGSE to KDE, so that will probably complicate things at bit compared to something like upgrading Kubuntu 11.10 to KDE 4.8.\nReferences:\nhttp://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/kde\nIs it safe to install Kubuntu-desktop in 11.10?\n\nA: You can't.\nMint and Ubuntu, no matter how closely related they are (or aren't, as the case might be) are still two different operating systems.\nThis is a bad idea.\nFirst, you're mixing two different distributions' packages together. For various reasons, this is a bad idea:\n\n\n*\n\n*Security. \n\n*Stability.\n\n*Conflicting updates.\n\n*If you let updates go through, you encounter the first two problems, and then you're in deep trouble if say, as an example a kernel update comes through! \nAlso, this makes getting an accurate bug report or stacktrace almost impossible, if not entirely impossible.\n\nA: I am also trying the same\nAnd given that I did conversely (switched from oneiric to Mint Lisa) i believe it is \"possible\" but with a cost, mainly broken/un-resolvable dependencies, which will prove your skills with dpkg\nAnyway, in my case to trick the system to \"think\" i was at oneiric, I changed the /etc/lsb_release file to contain a valid info:\nDISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu\nDISTRIB_RELEASE=11.10\nDISTRIB_CODENAME=oneiric\nDISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=\"Ubuntu 11.10\"\nreplaced any occurrence/reference of oneiric to precise on /etc/apt/sources.list\nand then issued and update-manager -d which detected the new release\nIt is right now downloading 1GB of packages, if it boots i will let you know the outcome\nBut being a beta, i would expect issue even if it were not from Lisa.\nCheers\n\nA: Linux Mint = Ubuntu (core, byte for byte) + mint-meta-core + one or several of\nmint-meta-mate\nmint-meta-cinnamon\nmint-meta-kde\nmint-meta-xfce\nmint-*\n\nSo, in theory, if you uninstall all mint-* packages and purge, you get an upgradable core Ubuntu.\nBut that's in theory.\nThe leitmotif of Mint being disguise, it cherishes runtime patches.\nAnd that cannot be reverted by uninstallation.\nIf a data area was patched with a Mint executable name that gets uninstalled, something will fail.\nIt should be tried to see.\nI personally installed Mint on top of a genuine Ubuntu (runs fine, but I should have walked the dog instead).\nThe best idea is probably to keep the system partition separate from user data and to make oneself a customization DEB to install on top of each new installation.\nDoing so also allows to copy a system partition for a hazardous experiment.\nInstalling one's additions in a /usr/local partition is in principle feasible but I don't know if it's possible to convince Synaptic to install something there instead of in /usr.\n\nA: Yesterday during the installation I was browsing with firefox, tried to close it and the whole xserver crashed, and it did not come back.\nAt this point I am sure all the guys that said it was a bad idea, are drawing a smirk on their faces.\nWell i was expecting issues, and it was simple to fix, I gave it the power button, booted in recovery mode/root shell and attempted from command line an apt-get distupgrade which failed because not all the packages were configured, but it suggested to run dpkg --configure -a\nAfter that completed rebooted the machine, issued another serie of apt-get update, apt-get upgrade\nAnd I am now on Ubuntu 12.04\nI grant that it would not be as stable as a fresh install, but it is not as bad, also we are not mixing packages this is an upgrade and Mint 12 is \"equivalent\" to ubuntu 11, so most of the packages if not all were upgraded. I must admit there are a few leftover like mintupdate... but hey, it proves that it is indeed possible to do the switch.\nRegards\nJorge G.\n", "Q: What is the release schedule for the ubuntu branches? The different branches (xubuntu for example): are they released the same day as the main branch?  IE will xubuntu 12.04 come out the same day as Ubuntu 12.04, or is there a lag?  Is there an official policy posted somewhere?\n\nA: The closest thing to \"official\" that you can get is \"when its ready.\"\nGenerally speaking, they are released on the same day, however this is not set in stone, because there might be a release blocker that pops in late in the cycle.\nFor example, Xubuntu 11.10 was released on 13 October 2011, as was Kubuntu and normal Ubuntu. \n10.04 Kubuntu, Xubuntu and Ubuntu were also released on the same day (29 April 2010). \nAs of right now, it appears that official derivatives will be released on the same day as \"normal\" Ubuntu 12.04. \nAs per GridCube on the #xubuntu irc channel:\n15:44:57 <jrgifford> Hey, quick question: Is the Xubuntu 12.04 release date currently set as the same date that \"normal\" Ubuntu is?

FAT32 is currently the most \"universal\" filesystem, and NTFS is starting to gain write support on most systems.\nSure, FAT32 and NTFS suffer from serious external fragmentation, but i don't think you use your xHDD to run an operating system or heavy applications directly on it, do you? :-)\nNote that you need to chose between compatibility and functionality: both FAT32 and NTFS lack a proper ownership and permissions system, and FAT32 has a max. file size limit of 4GB on FAT32.\n", "Q: How to make openJDK automatically update-alternatives?

If a packet matches an earlier rule, there is no further processing.\nYou are appending ( -A ) your rules to the end of the OUTPUT chain, so, my guess is the packets are accepted by an earlier rule.\nIf you put the rule first, with -I OUTPUT 1, it will work.\nsudo iptables -I OUTPUT 1 -p all -m owner --uid-owner dev -j DROP\n\nYour user case is more complex as you are using 2 tools, firestarter and iptables, to manage your firewall rules.

You can keep multiple screens open, kind of like tabs, and it has easier to remember shortcuts for attaching, detaching, switching between screens, etc.  \nThe default setting for byobu is to attach to a session which is already running, if there is one, which makes what you want to do nice and easy.

I have an ubuntu 11.10 with eclipse installed, now I am supposed to need JVM, Java compiler and something called API.\nI am starting to learn Java, because it is easy to make it work on windows after.\nSo what do I install?\n\nA: Depending on which version of java jre you use, you need to install a jdk, for example the package openjdk-6-jdk.\nOnce you've done that, you should be able to run a javac command to compile .java files.\nFor example A.java:\nclass A {\n    public static void main(String[] a){\n        System.out.println(\"hello\");\n    }\n}\n\nthen compile to A.class\n$ javac A.java\n\nAnd run:\n$ java A\n\nThis should output\n> hello\n\nThen the easiest thing to do is just to install Eclipse, and get started.\n\nA: \nI am supposed to need JVM, Java compiler and something called API\n\nThe Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is what runs the Java applications (compiled into bytecode). The Java API is the set of existing features that are implemented the runtime libraries: everything documented here. Both the JVM and the runtime libraries form the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). Its main command is java.\nThe Java compiler, used via the javac commandin the Java Development Kit (JDK), is what turns source code into bytecode, which can be run with the JRE.\nThe OpenJDK JRE is available in the openjdk-6-jre package and the OpenJDK in the openjdk-6-jdk package (which depends on openjdk-6-jre anyway).\nEclipse needs the JRE to run, but provides its own compiler (Eclipse JDT). Strictly speaking, you don't need the JDK to develop with Eclipse, you could compile everything within Eclipse and run your applications through the JRE.\nThis being said, if you're a beginner, it's certainly worth trying a few toy applications with javac, if only to understand how the compilation process, package/directory structures and classpath work. IDEs like Eclipse can make a lot of this conveniently automated or invisible (which can be very useful), but knowing the basics helps when you run into problems.\nUnless you're short of disk space, it makes sense to install both the JRE and the JDK, even if you're using Eclipse.\n", "Q: FFmpeg not extracting part of the video I used FFmpeg to extract portion (5 seconds) of a video like this:\nffmpeg -ss 00:30:00 -t 00:00:05 -i original.avi cut1.avi\nand also like this:\nffmpeg -ss 1800 -t 5 -i original.avi cut1.avi\nBut what FFmpeg did was create a file starting at 00:30:00 and included the rest of the file instead of just 5 seconds.

I'm running the latest Kubuntu (12.04 beta 2) and I would like to run the latest emacs (currently v24). The repos are one version behind. What's the best way to install v24 or later (and avoid future version conflicts)?\nAlso, is there any reason not to aways use the GUI version of emacs if X is running? For example, could I set the GUI emacs version as the default text editor and use it to edit cron jobs (crontab -e)? I'm assuming the answer is yes, but since I haven't done that yet (my default editor is nano), I want to check if there are reasons I should leave nano as the default editor.\nUsually when I'm working on the command line I end up using nano. Now that I think about it, I have no idea why I keep doing that. Is there any downside to calling a GUI editor when working in an X terminal?\nEDIT: I briefly tested these two versions\n\n\n*\n\n*GNU Emacs 24.0.94.1 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.3.20) from \n\n*GNU Emacs 23.3.1 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) installed by default in Kubuntu.\n\n\nThis post explains some of the differences between versions.\nUnfortunately (for me) the defaults installed version (23.3.1, 23.3+1-1ubuntu9) is the nox version. \nPackage: emacs23-nox\nStatus: install ok installed\nVersion: 23.3+1-1ubuntu9\nReplaces: emacs23, emacs23-gtk, emacs23-lucid\n\nThe package with version 24 opens in GUI mode by default. That's what I prefer. Some of the version 24 changes that interest me are listed in the references below. \nBut there appear to be a multitude of different packages and versions I could install.\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*What’s New In Emacs 24 (part 1) | Mastering Emacs\nhttp://www.masteringemacs.org/articles/2011/12/06/what-is-new-in-emacs-24-part-1/\n\"    shell-mode uses pcomplete rules, with the standard completion UI. \nYowzah! There’s a lot of cool, new functionality hidden away in this gem of a change.\"\n\n*EmacsWiki: Recent Changes\nhttp://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/?action=rc;showedit=0\n\nA: If you must chase the very latest version, then you can always get the source and compile it yourself.  Unless you know of some killer new feature that emacs24 has though, I'd not waste the time and just use the one that ships with Ubuntu.\nThere's no downsides to calling it directly, but the emacs way is to start up one emacs session when you log on and never close it.  You can export EDITOR=emacsclient and run M-x server-start in emacs and things like crontab -e will prompt emacs to open the file in the other window.  When you are done, you hit C-x C-# to unblock the emacsclient.\nIf you prefer to keep the editing in the terminal window ( of course, you can just run M-x ansi-term and do your terminal work inside an emacs buffer ), you can add -t to the emacsclient command and it will open a new emacs frame on that terminal so you can do your editing in the terminal, but still have access to all of your other buffers, the kill ring, etc.\n\nA: The difference in behavior in starting in CLI vs GUI mode is not a version 23 vs 24 issue. Unless you are insistant on version 24 or really need a new feature I would just install and run the current stable version from your current repo. You will not notice much of a difference between the two versions in most day to day use. Try to remove and reinstall if it is giving you weird behavior like insisting on startin in CLI mode. Did you deliberately (or accidentally) install emacs-nox initially? \n", "Q: Is it possible to login by voice recognition? Although I like face recognition, I'd prefer to use voice recognition login. Is it possible? If it's possible how do I setup the software?\n\nA: There are various kinds of voice authentication. For example, doing speech-to-text and then verifying the decoded text; voice pattern analysis; singing a tune; analyzing the frequency spectrum of the voice and so on. Depending on what you are looking for, you are early or very early in the game.\nHowever,\nYou could allow automatic login with or without a password, and then start some software tool that would prompt and check your voice, speech, anything. For proof of concept purposes, you may start the software from your .login or .bash_rc script, but beware that they may be terminated from the keyboard. If authentication fails, execute logout.\nFor voice recognition software, check this Wikipedia article or project Julius.\nThe alternative (the hard way) would be to find or implement a Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM), similar to the fingerprint authentication for TI laptops. Although I can not point you to a ready to use module, it is technically possible.\n\nA: No, with the current set of software for Ubuntu, it is not possible to login by voice.\nThere is no software to allow you to do this. Voice recognition is still a very new and imperfect technology. Everyone can agree it would be cool and high-tech to walk up to your computer, say something, have it say \"Access Granted\" and log us in. But right now, we can only dream. \nTo create a secure voice login would require an extraordinary amount of computer power to accurately analyze the voice. Apple's Siri sends the data to servers to have them report back what was said, because it does not have the power to do it on it's own. \nHowever, I think it would be extremely cool and is a great idea. If you would like to get the ball rolling, head over to http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com site and start the discussion there. You'll get feedback from lots of people including Ubuntu developers, and there if enough people think it's a good idea it'll happen.\n\nA: this maybe helpful: voice recognition in ubuntu\n", "Q: How to transfer music from zip archive to Banshee Whenever I open a 2gb zip file using Banshee, it plays fine until I close the archive, at which point it ceases to play.

I have a Ubuntu - Windows 7 dual-boot set-up, and I would like to have it that my laptop would boot up Windows 7 unless I press down the Shift key right after boot and bring up the Grub2 menu from which I can choose Ubuntu.\nI researched on Grub2 and options for etc/default/grub and I have tried playing around with combinations with the GRUB_TIMEOUT and GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT values, but to no avail. I tried setting the GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT higher than the GRUB_TIMEOUT thinking that both countdown start simultaneously, but no - GRUB_TIMEOUT only starts after the other is done. \nIs this behavior achievable?\nIf so, how? \n\nA: In Kubuntu 14.04, this does not work, if you set GRUB_TIMEOUT= 0, \nstrangely, after applying this and rebooting, \nthe grub menu remains visible for 10s.\nThe reason for this is that in another grub script there is a piece of code that sets grub_timeout to 10 if it has the value of 0.\nSo this is how i got it to work:\nmake a copy of both grub and 30_osprober files  !!! \nWhen something goes wrong, you can put the original files back\nIn /etc/default/grub\nGRUB_DEFAULT=4    #set this value to the OS you want to boot\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\n\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=0\n\nin /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober,\nthere is a piece of code that sets grub timeout to 10s if it is set to zero in /etc/default/grub, I don't know why the devs put it there, but it prevents hiding the grub menu.\nset timeout_style=menu\n\nif [ \"\\${timeout}\" = 0 ]; then    \n  set timeout=10  # I changed this from 10 to 0\n\nAfter these changes, run sudo update-grub to generate the new grub boot sequence.\nI document all my linux fixes/mods on \nhttps://sites.google.com/site/marcshomesite/Home/linux-tuning\n\nA: To automatically boot Windows without having to select from the GRUB menu we need to edit the /etc/default/grub file with values similar to these:\nGRUB_DEFAULT= <number of default entry starting from 0>\nGRUB_TIMEOUT= 0 # time in seconds to boot default\n# GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0 # warning: activating this may lock you out from GRUB menu\n\nIt is always a good idea to make backups of these files before you edit them. After having made changes we need to activate them with\nsudo update-grub\n\nValues for GRUB_DEFAULT depend on our individual system. To always boot Windows we can alternatively put in the name of the entry exactly as it was shown in the Grub menu (e.g. \"Microsoft Windows XP Professional\") instead of the entry number.\n\nImportant note: in some machines GRUB menu can not be displayed with pressing and holding left Shift on boot (see bug #425979). Therefore it may be a good idea to first test this with booting Ubuntu (not Windows) set as default OS. Then you will be able to easily undo your GRUB settings in case you are affected.\n\nA: I was trying to do the same and I found great help in the Ubuntu Forums, particularly in this thread.\nAssuming you did the right thing with /etc/default/grub, correctly setting GRUB_TIMEOUT and GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT (I'd say respectively to 0 and 5) and even GRUB_DEFAULT to specify the default image to boot, here's the procedure to have it work the right way.\n\n\n*\n\n*Add those lines\nGRUB_FORCE_HIDDEN_MENU=\"true\"\nexport GRUB_FORCE_HIDDEN_MENU\n\nto the end of /etc/default/grub\n\n*Backup your /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober and overwrite it with the version found here\n\n*Test it!

Of course you need to be a privileged user to do so.\n\n\n*\n\n*First change is in the /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober file:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open it with sudo gedit /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober\n\n*Change quick_boot=\"1\" to quick_boot=\"0\"\n\n*save the file\n\n\n*Thereafter you can set the timeout values in /etc/default/grub to zero or some other value:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open it with sudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\n*GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0 and GRUB_TIMEOUT=0.\n\n*save the file\n\n\n*The last step is to update grub\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo update-grub\nThe changes to the first file are because the default setting is that if other OS (e. g. Windows 10) are found the timeout value is always set to 10 seconds and therefore cannot be changed by /etc/default/grub. This is accomplished by a function named adjust_timeout which asks if quick_boot is set and if other OS are present.\n\nA: install grub optimizer\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\n\nGrub Customizer will now show up in the Applications > System Tools menu.\nOr you can open it from the command line.\n\ngksudo grub-customizer\n\n\n\n\nA: I think that I found a simpler resolution.\nModify the following lines in the file /etc/default/grub :\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0.0\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=0.0\nOf course we finally run an update-grub. \nIt works on my PC.\n\nA: This is for Ubuntu 16.04.\nI solved this with a little combination of some of the answers found above, so it is not necessary to modify 30_os-prober, avoiding future merges when the grub package is updated...\nHope it helps.\nChanged some variables in /etc/default/grub to reflect what I want;\nGRUB_DEFAULT=4\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=5\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=0\nGRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\"\n\nGRUB_FORCE_HIDDEN_MENU=\"true\"\nexport GRUB_FORCE_HIDDEN_MENU\n\nThen created a new file;\nsudo touch /etc/grub.d/50_hidemenu\nsudo chmod +x /etc/grub.d/50_hidemenu\n\nfilled it with this content;\n#!/bin/sh\ncat <<EOF\nif [ \"x\\${timeout}\" != \"x-1\" ]; then\n  if keystatus; then\n    if keystatus --shift; then\n      set timeout=-1\n    else\n      set timeout=0\n    fi\n  else\n    if sleep --interruptible ${GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT} ; then\n      set timeout=0\n    fi\n  fi\nfi\nEOF\n\nand updated grub;\nsudo update-grub\n\nCheers.\n\nA: I was having the same problem on a single boot system. If GRUB_TIMEOUT was non-zero the menu would always popped up regardless of GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT.  If GRUB_TIMEOUT was zero it would sleep for GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT seconds but neither SHIFT nor ESC would show the menu.\nI fixed it by adding an else clause to the sleep statment at the end of adjust_time() in 30_os-prober.  Now if it isn't interrupted the timeout is zero and it boots with no menu, but if it is interrupted I set the timeout to 10.\nThis actually seems backwards since sleep should return 0 (false) if it's not interrupted and 1 (true) if it is but it seemed to work for me.\n\nA: Just to finalize this discussion:\nI do NOT recommend anyone to edit the \"30_os-prober\" file! (the code is there for a reason!)\nThe right way to fix the issue is to disable fast-boot in your windows installation as described here (for Win8) and here (for Win10).\nAfter doing this you need to SHUTDOWN (not reboot) your PC to prevent windows from creating files which get loaded on start-up to boot faster. \nNow, if grub is configured correctly, it should work as intended without editing the \"30_os-prober\" file, because the \"[ \"$quick_boot\" = 1 ]\" check in the if condition posted above returns 0.\n\nA: MAKING THE GRUB2 BOOT MENU AUTOMATICALLY VISIBLE\nFor some reason, editing the GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480 settings in the Grub Customizer usually makes the boot menu visible:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install grub-customizer as above and update\n\n*find Grub Customizer in the GUI (for me it's in System>Administration>..., but for some it is fund under Applications>System Tools>..)\n\n*Open Grub Customizer and select Preferences> Advanced\n\n*Select GRUB_gfxmode (640X480) - if it is already selected, deselect it, reboot, and select it again.\n\n*cross your fingers and reboot!\n\n\nI have no idea why this worked for me, but it worked on both of my computers, so hopefully it will work for you too!\n\nA: Shasteriskt, one alternative to the 'SHIFT' solution is just to create a script that does some move operations for you. What I mean is create a file called grub.bak that is an exact copy of your grub.cfg file, with the only difference being that the set timeout=0 line is changed to set timeout=10 for example. Create a shell script that does a switch allowing you to reboot according to your needs. I created an equivalent python script that fulfills these requirements, but of course it has to be called with sudo. I simply put it into /usr/bin on my setup as a symlink to the actual script itself. Note: I am running fluxbox on Arch so I'm not sure if there are any discrepancies between this script and Ubuntu, but there should be little to no modifications, I think. Script looks like:\n#! /usr/bin/python\nfrom shlex import split\nfrom subprocess import call\nfrom os import rename, chdir\n\nchdir('/boot/grub/')\ntry:\n    with open('grub.bak','r') as alternate:\n        pass\n    if raw_input('Auto-boot is set. Un-set?> ') == 'y':\n        rename('grub.cfg','grub.back')\n        rename('grub.bak','grub.cfg')\n\n    if raw_input('Reboot system?> ') == 'y':\n        call(split('shutdown -r now'))\n\nexcept:\n    if raw_input('Auto-boot is not set. Set?> ') == 'y':\n        rename('grub.cfg','grub.bak')\n        rename('grub.back','grub.cfg')\n\n    if raw_input('Reboot system?> ') == 'y':\n        call(split('shutdown -r now'))\n\nThe script basically just determines whether or not you have the menu to load or not (auto-boot or not). Based on its findings, it asks you if you would like to turn it on or off, and then asks if you if you want to reboot. Conversely, if you want it to work the other way around (i.e. in Windows), and you have Windows set up to access files in Linux, you can run the same script in that environment as well, if you wish. Hope that helps.\n\nA: So even if you set GRUB_TIMEOUT to 0, if you have any GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT, 30_os-prober will set timeout to 10 whether you like it or not.  Other solutions here edit that script, but that could cause update issues you'll have to merge if GRUB is updated.  \nBetter solution: write the following in /etc/grub.d/50_goddamnit (new file):\n#!/bin/sh\necho \"set timeout=0\"\n\nBasically, this will run last and be the final line in /boot/grub/grub.conf, thereby overriding all the other silly mishigus in the default config.\n\nA: If you have a single operating system, that is, for example, Ubuntu 18.04 only, edit /etc/default/grub:\n$ sudo vim /etc/default/grub\n\nChange the following lines as shown:\nGRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden  \nGRUB_TIMEOUT=1\n\nIf you are dual booting, for example Ubuntu 18.04 + Windows 10, edit /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober:\n$ sudo vim /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober\n\nChange the following lines as shown:\nadjust_timeout () {  \n  if [ \"$quick_boot\" = 1 ] && [ \"x${found_other_os}\" != \"x\" ]; then  \n    cat << EOF  \nset timeout_style=hidden\nif [ \"\\${timeout}\" = 0 ]; then  \n  set timeout=1\nfi  \nEOF  \n  fi  \n}\n\nFinally update GRUB:\n$ sudo update-grub  \n\nOK!

KDE System Settings > Startup and Shutdown > Session management.\nTry with the \"Start with an empty session\".\n\nIn other words, even though you close Nautilus before ending your KDE session. KDE is currently incapable of keeping track of this correctly and as such KDE will try to restore your Nautilus session even though it was closed before you ended your previous KDE session.

First step:  how do I get \"in\", or bypass the login screen?\n\nA: When your server boots up, even if you don't log in, it should be connected to the local network. \nTo log in, you should be able to use ssh:\nssh username@yourmachinename.local\n\nIf you'd like to run graphical apps on the server you can add X forwarding:\nssh -X username@yourmachine.local\n\n\nA: Can also be that your trying to login as root, and its off by default, if so use your regular user\n\n\n*\n\n*this is in reply to your ssh problems\n\n", "Q: Init.d script gets return code 1 when calling itself, how can I get output?

All info I can get is by inserting a line\necho $?\n\nafter the su line, which outputs '1'.\nIs there a way I can see what happens when the su command runs?\n\nA: It could be that the user wasn't set up as system user correctly.

Because this part of the script executes a shell command passed to su as an argument, this caused the script to just exit right there.\n", "Q: Cannot connect to local webserver I can no longer connect to my local webserver With telnet.

Now here's what I want: Ubuntu on the SD card that lives in my phone. \nI like using Ubuntu portably and my phone as a flash drive, but I haven't been able to make these work together yet. \nI've tried booting off my Huawei U8800 (Android 2.2) and Nokia E66 with a micro-SD card (with 11.10, boots OK in a card-reader) on an eeepc 901 without luck. The Huawei doesn't show up in the BIOS boot menu. BIOS sees the Nokia but halts at \"Boot error\". \nI guess this is related to the phone's flash drive emulation and how it handles bootsectors, but I don't know enough about how that works to go any further. Has anyone succeeded in this?\n\nA: Some phones present themselves as a USB Mass Storage device, but with multiple \"partitions\". One of these will be the SD card and the other will be a static partition used to store things like the Windows driver software for the phone.\nWhat is the output of lsusb -v when you plug your phone and memory card into a Linux computer?\n\nA: I just tried to do that on my Nexus One. I had to rsync from an existing installation, and installed the boot loader manually to get Ubuntu on the micro SD card. The card switched into read only state a few times so I had to remount the card (card not in phone, mounted via integrated card reader) and restart rsync.\nIt may just be this card, but I have serious doubts that using such memory devices for desktop operating systems is a good idea. Notice that process management and logging cause a lot of writes to the memory and that in turn causes wear.\nI tried booting from the card mounted in the Nexus One and hooked up via USB. I was able to choose the phone as boot device on my laptop, but it wasn't able to find the bootloader. It may be specific to Android or the computer that the USB mass storage is not properly detected at boot, since Android disables UMS when it loses the USB connection.\nYou can try to reinstall the boot loader via Live CD to your SD card while mounted in your Nokia, as it sounds like there is some issue there.\ngrub-install --root-directory /media/path_to_your_sdcard /dev/device_name_of_your_sdcard\n\nUUID in grub.conf and fstab should already be correct.\nHowever I can not stress this enough: it is not a good idea. Future Android phones will probably drop UMS mode and micro SD card slots in favor of the MTD mode introduced with ICS.\n", "Q: Ubuntu doesn't start, not enough disk space On my computer I divided 50GB for Ubuntu 11.10\nI decided to install game Unreal tournament 2004 deb package. After few minutes installation I have a error about \"Not enough disk space\". Then I abort installation and reboot computer in Windows. Today I try to start my ubuntu, but after change boot OS ubuntu, I see nothing. Black display.\nThen in windows programm ext2explore I saw that in Linux there is no free disk space.\nHow can I remove the packages that were installed?\n\nA: In normal operation Ubuntu does not utilize a lot of disk space for itself, even with a bunch of packages installed. On a filled 50 GB partition, there are surely some warez you can remove or temporarily move somewhere else.\nHowever there is another option: tune2fs -m 0.5 /path_to/device\nFrom the tune2fs manpage:\n-m _reserved-blocks-percentage_\n\nSet the percentage of the filesystem which may only be allocated\nby privileged processes.   Reserving some number of filesystem blocks\nfor use by privileged processes is done to avoid filesystem fragmentation,\nand to allow system daemons, such as sys‐logd(8), to continue to function\ncorrectly after non-privileged processes are prevented from writing to the\nfilesystem.  Normally, the default percentage of reserved blocks is 5%.\n\nSo using this command you will lower the the reserved blocks in your example from 2,5 GB to 250 MB, which should suffice to boot Ubuntu again.\nObviously you need to run the command from the Live CD. Put the setting back in place after you fixed your issue(!) with: tune2fs -m 5 /path_to/device\nAs I said in normal operation Ubuntu does not fill a 50 GB file system to the brim. If that 5 GB and above game was the only large thing that you can remember to put on this file system you might want to investigate here. You can use the graphical disk usage tool that comes with Ubuntu or use a command like this: find -size +1G /path | more\nFiles over 1 GB in size are very rare in the Ubuntu system. Also take a look into /var/log or the log viewer. Don't just remove the files, try to find out if they have to be that big or what made them grow. If it is a logfile take a look at it. I had one with 30 GB in size due to my KVM switch acting up. Replugging it fixed the issue.\n", "Q: Cannot install dsniff in 9.10 USB Ubuntu 9.10 USB Pendrive everything works good even after sudo apt-get update and I try to sudo apt-get install dsniff and I get the following message:\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install dsniff\nReading package lists...

Is LibreOffice Writer able to read properly Ms Office Word docx Files?\nI think it can't and users should be aware of it!\nI tried to open many documents .docx created with Ms Office 2007 and appeared modified/transformed when I tried to open them with LibreOffice.\nCan I do anything about it?\n\nA: I had this problem as well (it doesn't help that MS keeps changing their formats) :(\nHot Tip\nOne solution I found that seemed to work is to ask people I am working on documents with to simply save it in an older doc version. It seems to guarantee that I could see the document in the original format and the people I was collaborating with were able to properly open my documents properly (previously saving LibreOffice in docx was preventing them from doing that).\nHope that helps some folks :)\n** Update: It appears as though the latest release of Open Office has better DocX support (only available in the latest version of Ubuntu 12 though)\n\nA: Yes it can... Most of the time without issues.\nLibreOffice supports by default several formats including the ones used by Microsoft Office, including the Office Open XML specification from .docx, .pptx and .xlsx.\nThat does not mean that everything will look exactly the same when you open a file in MS Office 2007 and in LibreOffice. To tell the truth not all files created in MS Office 2007 will open the same even in Ms Office 2010, and the opposite is also true.\nYou should be aware that Office XML specifications were created by Microsoft and that nuances can be seen using different versions of the editor that you are using. That will also be true even with Microsoft software.\nJust don't expect that everything will be the same all the time. Things like missing fonts and weird formatting in the original document will cause massive issues while trying to open it in LibreOffice. Open XML formats are bad. End of story.\nAs an option you can however run MS Office in Ubuntu easily. Nothing is impossible. Just buy a MS Office license, run the installer with Wine and you can do all the things you do in Windows using MS Office 2007 under Ubuntu.\n\nA: Another factor that often is overlooked when compatibility is discussed is that documents created in MS Office in Windows often uses MS fonts that is not available in Linux. An exchanged font makes documents look different and the layout will get lost. \nThis can partly be fixed by using exactly the same fonts in MS Office and LibreOffice. \n\nA: Not really, I cant use with any Documents that my business creates in Office 2007/10 - the formatting is all over the place.\nReally should not be touted as a \"full office suite compatible with MS office - it really isn't and in no way should it be used for businesses. \n\nA: I agree that it has some basic compatibility but as people have said here, the ususal workflow where a Windows/Office user sends you a docx which you edit and send back is fundamentally unfeasible with LibreOffice, and the main reason I still need to boot into Windows. Any file with tables or advanced formatting will tend to break. \nI can't yet verify if the new/beta version does handle these better but at the moment I would still consider it risky\n\nA: Unfortunately, LibreOffice still has poor formatting compatibility with MS Office, despite a few improvements in the latest version. It's still way short for being able to open a Word document, edit it, save it, then open it in Word  without losing formatting in one way or another. Docx compatibility is even worse than doc.\nThe only office suite for Linux that provides true interoperability with Microsoft Office is SoftMaker Office. Its word processor TextMaker opens and saves doc and docx without any flaws. Amazing. A free 30 day trial version of SoftMaker Office is available on SoftMaker's website for you to prove it.\n\nA: Seems there is a new beta update with DOCX improvements.\nA List of Changes is available.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/libreoffice-prereleases\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n", "Q: Why do upgrades remove my r8168 module?

Why is this happening and how can I prevent it?\n\nA: Upgrades do not remove your kernel module, it is just that a new kernel does not have the kernel module you installed.

How can I do that?\nScript\n./init.d/opscenter-agent start\n\nA: If you want to do this as system startup (as opposed to when you log in to your computer), put the commands you want to run in /etc/rc.local.\nSee [Ubuntu] Executing a script at startup and shutdown.\n\nA: If the script does not need to be run by root, you can do this:  \n1) Open \"Startup Applications Preferences\" (Alt + F2 and paste gnome-session-properties and hit Enter),  \n2) Press \"Add\" and select your script:  \n \n\n\nIf you are not using a graphical environment, you can put the commands just before the line exit 0 in this file: /etc/rc.local. (To edit it just paste at terminal sudo nano /etc/rc.local.  \n\nA: The /etc/rc.local approach will 'run a very simple command at startup', but it is not an init.d script approach, and is in various ways inferior.  (That may not matter, depending on your purpose).  \nUnlike init.d scripts, rc.local comands don't offer a standard interface to starting and stopping a process, and they don't offer much ability to influence when in the startup process they are run.  You can see in the /etc/init.d/rc.local script that this is run after everything else (Required-Start:    $all).\nIf an init.d script really is what you want, then usually just grabbing an existing script, copying it and editing it works fine, though some of the existing scripts have more complexity than you want.  Since that's how most init.d scripts start, ubuntu provides /etc/init.d/skeleton for this purpose.\nAlso worth a look:\n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/init.d/motd is a minimal example that runs something at startup, but with the Required-Start parameter setting when it should happen.\n\n*/etc/init.d/cron is a simple starting point for a daemon process (give or take the parse_environment function, which you probably don't need).  \n\n", "Q: How can I drag and drop files into the Ubuntu One bookmark in Nautilus? I have a bookmark to my Ubuntu-One folder in the sidebar of Nautilus, it would seem logical that it would be possible to drag and drop files and folders on top of this bookmark and have the dropped items copied to the Ubuntu-One folder to be synced to the cloud. However this does not happen, I can drop files and folders onto the shortcuts underneath \"Computer\" in the Nautilus sidebar but not onto anything that is a bookmark.\nIs it possible to change this behaviour so that it is possible? Or failing that are there any possible workarounds to get a similar result?\n\n\nA: You can get a similar result (where by “similar” I interpret “gives you a way to drag things into the Ubuntu One folder from Nautilus) in one of four ways: add an extra pane (press F3, or View → Extra Pane),\n\nswitch to having a tree in the sidebar (View → Sidebar → Tree),\n\nadd an extra tab (Ctrl+T, or File → New Tab),\n\nor simply open a new nautilus window (Ctrl+N, or File → New Window).\n\nA: Since the update of Nautilus to version 3.4.2-0ubuntu3 it is now possible to simply drag and drop files and folders into Nautilus bookmarks. This is now possible due to the following bug being fixed: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nautilus/+bug/874386\n\n", "Q: Is Zeitgeist installed as part of Ubuntu Minimal?

I know how to add quicklists for a standard launcher with a .desktop file in either ~/.local/share/applications or /usr/share/applications.\nBut I am  trying to create a quicklist for the icon that appears when a blank disc (CDR/DVD) is inserted.\n\nA: A similar discussion took place in the Ayatana Mailing List. It is not possible to create a quicklist for mounted devices or CDs by just editing the .desktop files. You need to hard code this in Unity itself.\n\nA: You can edit any of those .desktop files, whichever one you plan on having on your Unity bar to feature your command as a right-click shortcut. You can edit an existing shortcut and change the icon.\nTo create a launcher that has the blank disc icon, you can do that graphically either in the menu editor (alacarte) or even using a Nautilus script, then find your blank disc icon (icon sets normally have them in the .../devices/ folder), or get a template for a .desktop file and put the path to that icon in the Icon= field. Since the launcher will have the blank disc icon, now you can use the existing quicklist examples as a template and add all the right-click shortcuts you like.\n", "Q: How to install suggested packages in apt-get I know the question has been asked before, but please hear me out.

Should'nt I be getting only around 10 extra packages?\n\nA: suggests and recommends are not the same thing.\n\nPackage A depends on Package B if B absolutely must be installed in order to run A. In some cases, A depends not only on B, but on a version of B. In this case, the version dependency is usually a lower limit, in the sense that A depends on any version of B more recent than some specified version.\nPackage A recommends Package B, if the package maintainer judges that most users would not want A without also having the functionality provided by B.\nPackage A suggests Package B if B contains files that are related to (and usually enhance) the functionality of A.\n\nSee The Debian GNU/Linux FAQ for details.\nBy default, apt-get installs recommended packages.\nYour option --install-suggests adds in the suggested packages and their suggested dependencies.\n--install-suggests\n    Consider suggested packages as a dependency for installing.\n    Configuration Item: APT::Install-Suggests.\n\nsee apt-get(8).\n\nA: I found out why the recommended packages in my question were not included in the packages to be installed. It's because those recommended packages do not exist in the repositories. I tried to install a random package, I chose sudo apt-get install googleearth-package. It did not show the Recommended packages section (which means they are already included in the NEW packages to be installed section). To confirm this, I ran sudo apt-get --no-install-recommends install googleearth-package, and surely enough the Recommended packages section revealed itself. As for the suggested packages, I guess I won't be using --install-suggests because that just installs the suggested packages and their suggested packages.\n\nA: There is an option --install-suggests. But as it's written in the comments I also find this option unusable because of its recursive behaviour, it pulls enormous amount of dependancies your never want.\nI always want the suggested packages of the given package, and NOT the suggested packages of any package to be installed.\nYou can see suggested packages of the given package(s) like this:\napt show PACKAGE 2>&1 | grep ^Suggests:\n\nThis command allows you to install package(s) with suggests of only given package(s):\napt show PACKAGES 2>&1 | sed -nr '/^(Suggests|Package): /{s///;s/( \\|[^,]+)?,//g;p}' | xargs apt -y install\n\nNOTE: If package suggests a couple of alternatives like pkg1 | pkg2 it always choses the first.\n", "Q: Error while opening network in Nautilus What does this mean \n\nError: DBus error org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.NoReply: Did not receive\n  a reply.

This will open a window showing you what your current burg setup is (nice because you don't have to reboot). If you press F1 to view a list of keys you can press, you'll see the f key is set to toggle folded mode. Try pressing f and see if it makes your burg look nicer.\nI believe you have to run\nsudo update-burg\n\nto save changes. Btw you can change theme/resolution there too.\n\nA: To add to Max's answer, you can group the windows recovery and normal partitions together by running sudo gedit /boot/burg/burg.cfg and adding --group group_win at the end of the Windows declarations similar to how the Ubuntu ones are done (ie after --class os and before the open bracket). \nThe group name can be anything, so should another OS misbehave in this screen, you can just add another group.\n(P.S.

The Gnome-Classic session received lots of love in Ubuntu 12.04 and really works like the good old Ubuntu desktop.\nOn session configuration: The sessions are configured in /usr/share/xsessions where gnome.desktop is the default session. The .desktop session files usually run something like gnome-session --session=ubuntu or gnome-session --session=gnome-classic.\nThese refer to files located in /usr/share/gnome-session/sessions where you can tell the specific session which window-manager to use.\n", "Q: I can't see \"Install Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud\" options in 11.10?

Currently, I have to have the actual GUI for it open in order for it to actually cycle through the backgrounds.  I find this highly aggravating because it entails me having to open up the program, run the background changing process, and then keep this program open.  So is there any way by which Wallch can auto-start the background changing process and keep this process going the entire time?\nEDIT:\nTo clarify this, I was always able to make Wallch cycle through the backgrounds, but not as a background process.  I've been able to find out how to do this by checking out How do I create a desktop wallpaper slideshow?.  If you have it set to your launcher, you can just right-click on it and then select the \"Start Changing Wallpapers\" button from the menu that comes up to make it run as a background process.  However, I was not able to find out how to make Wallch auto-start the cycling from the moment you log on, I always had to do the right-click and start whenever I log on again.  So is there any way that this cycling can start from the moment I log on?\n\nA: This could be a timing issue with the startup application with the command line\nwallch --constant\n\nI would suggest you introduce a short delay before starting wallch as a background process.\nSearch in Dash for startup application\nThen add a new startup application:\n\nUse a startup application command line of:\nsh -c \"sleep 10 && wallch --constant &\"\n\n", "Q: Fix Nautilus URIs in a Python script I have a very basic Python script I wrote mostly for learning purposes. \nIt opens a terminal in the current folder. However, I can't get it to work in folders with accented characters in the URI (e.g.: /home/pablo/Vídeos or /home/pablo/Área de Trabalho), because it looks like Nautilus URIs are encoded to those %{number} values. Is there a way to convert these URIs to normalized URIs without having to translate every possible accented value by hand?\n\nA: It's not very clear from you question, but it looks like your are searching for urllib. Note that urllib expects 8 bit strings, so you will need to do some fancy decode/encode. Welcome to python2 somewhat weird unicode support, pythn3 is way better.\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\nimport urllib\n\nurl=u'/home/javier/Área'\n\nurl2 = url.encode('utf-8') # urllib expects 8-bit string\nurl3 = urllib.quote_plus(url2)\nprint url3  # >> %2Fhome%2Fjavier%2F%C3%81rea\nurl4 = urllib.unquote(url3) # It will return a 8-bit string\nprint url4  # >> /home/javier/Área\nprint url4.decode('utf-8')\n\nYou can use urllib.qoute instead of *urllib.quote_plus*, it will not quote spaces, + (pluses) and / (slashes). Both functions accept a string as a second parameter, they will keep any character in that string as is (I mean it will not quote it) in the output string. Note that the default value for safe, the name of the second parameter, is '/' for quote and '' for quote_plus. If you don't include a slash in your second parameter quote will change it.\nurllib.quote_plus('a/a','/')  # 'a/a'\n\n", "Q: New to emacs -- my key bindings are different from what is described in the tutorials. How to fix this? I'm using emacs v24 [GNU Emacs 24.0.94.1 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.3.20)\n of 2012-03-26 on meitnerium, modified by Debian] on Kubuntu 12.04.\nMy basic problem is that emacs is not behaving the same as the tutorials I'm reading. I either need different tutorials or I need to make my emacs work as described in the tutorials. Being new to emacs and KDE, I don't know where to start because of this incongruence.\nMy specific problem is this:\nWhen I shift-left-mouse-click, I get a buffer dialog popup. That differs from my understanding of the documenation:\n\nshift mouse-1  Draws lines, rectangles or poly-lines, erases, cuts, copies or pastes.\n\nI also want to use CUA mode. The CUA mode documents seem to indicate that shift-left-mouse-click produces: \n\nrectangle highlighting by dragging the mouse while holding down the shift key. \n\nI don't get that result either. In fact, I can't select using any modifier keys together with a drag action. Maybe this is a KDE issue. I don't know.\n\nA: Shift+MouseLeft runs the command mouse-appearance-menu by default since Emacs 23 (before, it ran mouse-set-font). This is the buffer dialog popup that you saw.\nYou can find out what a key (or key combination) or mouse button does in your Emacs by pressing C-h c (i.e. Ctrl+H then C) then the key(s) or button. The name of the command that it invokes will appear at the bottom of the screen. If you press C-h k, you will also see the documentation of that command. Conversely, if you happen to know the name of a command and want to know what key invokes it, press C-h w then enter the name of the command. You can use f1 instead of C-h.\nYou didn't say what tutorial you were using. I suspect you missed something in your reading. The text “shift mouse-1 Draws lines, rectangles or poly-lines, erases, cuts, copies or pastes” appears in the documentation of Artist Mode, an Emacs package (included in the standard Emacs distribution) that facilitates drawing ASCII pictures. To enter Artist Mode, type M-x artist-mode RET (i.e. Alt+X, then type artist-mode and Return).\n", "Q: Folder Sizes in nautilus Back when i was using xp i had this program called Folder Sizes \nthat showed the folder(also file) size in the explorer column \nI was wondering will that option be or is available in nautilus or other file-manager\n\nScreenshot\n\nA: There are several ways to do this.

(error \"Kernel requires features not present on the CPU: PAE\") After burning Ubuntu 12.04 to a CD, I tried booting and got the message:\nThis kernel requires the following features not present on the CPU:\npae\n\nUnable to boot - please use a kernel appropriate for your CPU.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nA: Many thanks for all the suggestions and assistance.\nI couldn't work out how best to give a report back of how I got on, so I'm writing it as an \"answer\".\nIt took all of yesterday evening and through the night chugging away, but I now have 12.04 LTS running and working perfectly on my eight-year-old little Samsung laptop (of which I'm very fond, despite its rather feeble processing power). I am due to treat it to a brand new hard drive as Ubuntu warns me that its current one is about to cark it.\nHere are the steps it took to get 12.04 LTS working on this non-PAE machine:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installed 11.10 again from scratch using the option to completely remove 9.10 and replace it\n\n*Installed all the updates via Internet\n\n*Took up the offer of downloading the upgrade to 12.04 LTS over the Internet\n\n*This ground to a halt due to the 6GB of disk space being all used up\n\n\nBah. I did not want to eat into the Windows XP partition, and didn't see why I needed more than 6GB of disk space just to have Ubuntu for general web browsing and checking emails, so I started again:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installed 11.10 again from scratch using the option to completely remove the knackered 12.04 LTS install and replace it\n\n*Did not install any of the updates\n\n*Removed a load of programs and applications from 11.10\n\n*Tried again to upgrade to 12.04 LTS via internet connection\n\n*Disk space ran out again and installation had to be aborted\n\n\nI tried looking at how the disk was partitioned, and there were about four partitions in addition to the XP. I rather blindly and haphazardly deleted all of them except for the XP one and a ca. 300 MB swap partition, and created a new one for the Ubuntu partition with the number \"4\" and a single \"\\\" or \"/\" involved in it somewhere. I was sort of past caring (and losing the will to live) by that point and was crossing my fingers that my XP partition wouldn't be trashed.\nAt that point I also read that before upgrading to 12.04, you should update all software on the existing [11.10] release. (So my ploy of deleting loads of programs would have come to naught). I also discovered the link to the alternative CD iso file, so burned that to a CD rather than using the internet (even though the internet connection is faster than reading from a CD at 70MB/s thanks to a recent free BT [British Telecom] upgrade). My reckoning was that I could preserve disk space by using the CD because the more recent updates wouldn't be downloaded during the installation.\nSo, onward, I tried this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installed 11.10 again from scratch using the option to remove the incomplete 12.04 LTS and replace it\n\n*Installed all the suggested 11.10 updates via internet connection\n\n*Rebooted, removing wired internet connection and switching off wireless\n\n*Upgraded to 12.04 LTS offline using alternative CD (left it chugging away all night)\n\n*Rebooted in the morning\n\n*Downloaded and installed updates via internet\n\n*Rebooted\n\n\nAnd hurrah! It now works (as does booting to Windows XP, phew), without a single glitch or incompatibility. I'm very impressed that all the Fn key combinations work, the wireless works, the screen looks great, and the speakers can be made to have their volume much louder than in Windows (meaning I don't have to use headphones most of the time to hear anything). I can even scroll up and down using the right-hand edge of the touchpad without having had to enable the feature! Plus, the hard drive doesn't grind away incessantly as has become the case with Windows. I love the Ubuntu font and, again, the outstanding readability of screen text on Ubuntu (noticeably better than Win or Mac in my opinion). Having the launcher at the left of the screen I wasn't too keen on at first glance, but having read the reasoning behind that design choice, it's something I'll try to get used to. It sensibly uses the abundant horizontal space to free up some of the much more scarce vertical space.\nI'll end the gushing and waffling here with thanks again to everyone for their advice. I hope this description of my trials, errors and eventual success is of use to someone!\n\nA: This answer completes existing answers on a bare metal installation with settings needed for an installation in Virtual Box.\nExpose PAE to a virtual machine in Virtual Box\nThe kernel shipped with Ubuntu >= 12.04 is a PAE kernel by default.\nFrom installations in Virtual Box the PAE capability of the CPU (if supported) can be exposed to the virtual machine. Choose \"Enable PAE/NX\" from the Virtual Box Manager System -> Processor settings:\n\nIn case this option is greyed out your host CPU does not have this feature. Only then you will have to install a non-pae kernel.\n\nA: Some alternatives:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install fake-pae (on 12.04, then you can upgrade to 12.10 and 13.04) as described in Ubuntu help page.\n\n*Do a fresh install of lubuntu-fake-pae which is 13.04.\n\n*Install another Ubuntu-based distro that does not require PAE, such as Puppy Retro or Bodhi Linux.\n\nA: There is a custom iso available (use at your own risk).\nIt worked for me, and I just had to install the relevant updates when I was done.\n\nA: The error message means that your CPU does not support PAE extensions - that is a technique which allows a 32bit CPU to address more than 4GB of memory address space.\nBy default, 12.04 and later versions of Ubuntu expects a CPU with this capability:\n\nPAE is provided by Intel Pentium Pro and above CPUs, including all\n  later Pentium-series processors (except the 400 MHz-bus versions of\n  the Pentium M). It is also available on other processors with similar\n  or more advanced versions of the same architecture, such as the AMD\n  Athlon[dubious – discuss] and later AMD processor models.\n  wikipedia\n\nWhile the above is strictly true, old systems which have the memory controller on the motherboard may not \"expose\" the CPU's PAE support, effectively making them non-PAE.\nThere is a heated bug report about this; Canonical has decided that the default Ubuntu Desktop install will expect PAE support.\nA few suggested workarounds:\nWorkaround 1: Install Lubuntu or Xubuntu, then install the regular Ubuntu Desktop\n\n\n*\n\n*Install either Lubuntu 12.04 32-bit or Xubuntu 12.04 32-bit; both of these use a non-PAE kernel by default.\n\n*Once you boot into your new Lubuntu/Xubuntu, you can then switch to the default Unity desktop by installing the ubuntu-desktop package.\n\n\nWorkaround 2: Install an older version and then upgrade to 12.04\nInstall 10.04 or 11.10 and then upgrade to 12.04.  See the linked question below for 12.10.\nWorkaround 3: If you have a wired internet connection, use the \"net install\" mini-CD\n\n\n*\n\n*You will need a reasonably fast wired connection for this method -- all packages will be downloaded over the internet.\n\n*Download the non-PAE netboot CD image mini.iso and burn it to a CD or USB.\n\n*Boot from it, follow the steps, and choose linux-generic when asked to choose a kernel, and ubuntu-desktop to get the \"default\" Ubuntu installation the regular Desktop CD would have given you, just with a non-PAE kernel.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can also choose one of the other desktops. You should choose a desktop otherwise you will not have a GUI to play with after installation.\n\n\n\nWorkaround 4: Ubuntu 12.04.5 and 14.04 (or later) on Pentium M only\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 12.04.5 and 14.04 support an option (\"forcepae\") to enable PAE on Pentium M CPUs (where it is disabled by default). To enable it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot the 32-bit Ubuntu (or Xubuntu etc.) installer\n\n*When the image of the keyboard and little man in circle appears hit the Tab key\n\n*\"Choose your language\" popup appears. Use the cursor keys and hit the Enter key to choose your language\n\n*Press F6, a grey menu will popup with some boot options\n\n*Press escape to close the window\n\n*You will now see a line that says:\n\n\nBoot Options file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed boot=casper initrd=/casper/initrd.lz quiet splash --\nEdit this line and add the forcepae parameter with spaces twice around the -- at the end:\nBoot Options file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed boot=casper initrd=/casper/initrd.lz quiet splash forcepae -- forcepae\n\n\n*\n\n*forcepae -- forcepae note: \nforcepae is required twice because it sets the boot parameters for two different kernel boots - the kernel that runs as part of the installer (left of --), and the kernel that runs on the installed system (right of --).\nThe text at the end should be -- forcepae not --forcepae. There is a space between -- and forcepae\n\n*Hit the Enter key, hopefully Ubuntu will boot and the rest of your install will be successful. If you have graphical problems with Unity, or just find it slow, try a more lightweight distribution like Xubuntu.\n\nLinked Question:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I tell if a machine has PAE?\n\n*Will it be possible to use a non-pae kernel in recent versions of Ubuntu?\n\nA: \nPhysical Address Extension (PAE) is a feature to allow (32-bit) x86\n  processors to access a physical address space (including random access\n  memory and memory mapped devices) larger than 4 gigabytes.\nUbuntu 12.04 uses the PAE Linux kernel by default for 32bit ISOs so\n  old computers that don't support PAE can't boot the latest Ubuntu\n  version.

But I can't do chmod/chown on any of the files/directories on these partitions.  The owner:group always myself, and the mode are always 700 for directories and 600 for files.\nI have another partition on internal harddisk also mounted.  That partition works fine.  I looked the output of mount command, the only difference between mount options is that there is one extra 'default_permissions' on the external hard disks.\nAnyway I can set the owner:group and mode on these files and directories.\n\nA: NTFS and FAT do not manage permissions, that are emulated on mount.\nThis means that once you mounted your NTFS hard disk you won't be able to change permission  or owner of the files inside.\nYou have to unmount and then remount it manually with the options you prefere.\nThe only case this is useful is when you want to execute files on the hard disk that is, by default, not mounted with execution rights.\nPay attention to the fact that the permissions are just emulated.

I bought my girlfriend a Wacom Bamboo CTH-470 recently and it is running well after installing wacom-dkms. I have now run into a wall that I don't know how to get around. The touch on the tablet will not turn off. I am running Ubuntu 12.04 Beta 2. I have tried turning the touch off from the wacom settings in the settings menu. The pen and touch both work perfectly fine, it is just that the touch drives her insane when trying to draw in myPaint.\n\nA: Here is a 1-line solution:\nxsetwacom --list | grep --line-buffered \"TOUCH\" | awk '{system(\"xsetwacom --set \"$8\" touch off\")}'\n\n\nA: Edit\nChecking the comments and other answers it looks like some are still looking for toggling touch using the tablet's buttons. If you just want that you need 3 things (shown for Ubuntu/Unity):\n\n\n*\n\n*A simple command (that can be run in the terminal or in a script file)\n\n\nrandompast's solution with a 1-line command is nice and can be turned into a more convenient 1-line toggle command:\nxsetwacom --list | grep --line-buffered \"TOUCH\" | awk '{system(\"echo \"$8\";xsetwacom --get \"$8\" TOUCH;\")}' | tr \"\\n\" \" \" | awk '$2 == \"off\" {system(\"xsetwacom --set \"$1\" TOUCH on\")} $2 == \"on\" {system(\"xsetwacom --set \"$1\" TOUCH off\")}'\n\nYou don't need that if you already have your own script or command line of course, but it's a convenient way of toggling the touch of connected tablets without knowing the tablets' name or id. \n\n\n*Set up a keyboard shortcut\n\n\nIf you want to run this without the terminal, you need to save the script in a file, make it executable and create a keyboard shortcut for it. That's because you can't assign a command directly to the tablet's buttons (but you can assign a keystroke ...).\nIn Unity open System Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts and create a new shortcut. Avoid the Super key since it may not always work in step 3.\nAs command, put the name of your script file (full path, between single quotes, if you're not sure then drag-drop the file in a terminal and use the created command).\n\n\n\n*Assign the shortcut's Keystroke to your button\n\n\nOpen System Settings > Wacom Tablet > Map Buttons ... and assign the keystroke you chose to your button.\nTo know which button is which you can first assign them letters with no modifier, select a text field and press the buttons to see which letter they correspond to.\n\nHere beware: not all the buttons will be recognised (3 out of 4 for my Bamboo) and not all keystroke will work (I can't get any with the Super key to work). You'll have to try different combinations.\nOriginal Answer (to learn the commands)\nI set up my Pen & Touch over a year ago so I may be wrong here. What I usually do is run in a terminal:\nxsetwacom --set \"Wacom BambooPT 2FG 4x5 Finger touch\" touch off\n\nThis won't work for you as you have another tablet so try first \nxsetwacom\n\nwhich should give you the parameters to use. First you need to get the name of your device (let's call it DEVICE_NAME), so try: \nxsetwacom --list devices\n\nThis gives me for my Pen & Touch:\nWacom BambooPT 2FG 4x5 Pen eraser   id: 11  type: ERASER\nWacom BambooPT 2FG 4x5 Pen stylus   id: 12  type: STYLUS\nWacom BambooPT 2FG 4x5 Finger pad   id: 13  type: PAD\nWacom BambooPT 2FG 4x5 Finger touch  id: 14  type: TOUCH\nObviously the one which is of type TOUCH is the one to disable here. Here DEVICE_NAME would be Wacom BambooPT 2FG 4x5 Finger touch and DEVICE_ID would be 14.Then you need to know which parameter to disable, so try:\nxsetwacom --list parameters\n\nThere's a plethora of parameters to enable/disable, and for each parameter name (let's call this PARAM_NAME) the type of value expected is explained. In this case we want to turn the Touch parameter Off, which you can do with the --set option. The syntax is:\nxsetwacom --set \"DEVICE_NAME\"  PARAM_NAME  PARAM_VALUE\n\nor\nxsetwacom --set DEVICE_ID  PARAM_NAME  PARAM_VALUE\n\nIf you're not sure what to put in place of PARAM_VALUE, try the --get option to see the current value:\nxsetwacom --get \"DEVICE_NAME\"  PARAM_NAME\n\n\nA: I wrote this script so that I can control turning touch on/off no matter which computer I plug the tablet into (because these IDs change between machines). You might find it useful as well.\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\n# kermit-internal-pytouch 0|1\n\nimport re, sys, subprocess\nresp = subprocess.Popen(['xinput', '-list'], stdout = subprocess.PIPE)\nout, err = resp.communicate()\nWacomLine = re.compile('Wacom')\nFingerLine = re.compile('Finger')\nidExpr=re.compile('id=(?P<number>\\d+)')\nfor line in out.split(\"\\n\"):\n    if WacomLine.search(line) and FingerLine.search(line):\n        identifier = idExpr.search(line)\n        num = identifier.group(\"number\")\n        subprocess.call(['xinput', '-set-prop', num, \"Device Enabled\", sys.argv[1]])\nresp = subprocess.Popen(['xinput', '-list'], stdout = subprocess.PIPE)\nout, err = resp.communicate()\nprint(out)\n\nI put this script in /usr/local/bin along with these two simple bash scripts to call it without having to remember the parameters...\nkermit-hw-bamboo-untouch:\n#!/bin/bash\nkermit-internal-pytouch 0\nexit\n\nkermit-hw-bamboo-touch:\n#!/bin/bash\nkermit-internal-pytouch 1\nexit\n\nThat said, I find it really sad that there isn't better support for tablets in Ubuntu. Maybe one day Wacom will show our community some attention too...\n\nA: Throwing yet another script in the batch, I wrote this one for myself. I have it in an executable file wacomtouch in a .scripts folder I added to my environment path. Thus, to disable touch, I only need to run wacomtouch off. It automatically detects all the params, so it theoretically works with any Wacom tablet automatically.\n(This relies on the pcregrep package.)\n#!/bin/bash\n\nSTATUS=\"$1\"\n\n#Isolate the id of the touch device automatically.\nrawID=`xsetwacom --list | pcregrep -M 'TOUCH' | pcregrep -o 'id\\: \\d*'`\n#Trim further\ndevice=`echo \"$rawID\" | grep -o \"[0-9]\\+\"`\n\nxsetwacom --set $device touch $1\n\ncase $1 in\n    on)\n        echo \"Tablet touch is ENABLED.\"\n        ;;\n    off)\n        echo \"Tablet touch is DISABLED.\"\n        ;;\n    *)\n        echo \"Invalid option.

How can I fix this so I can return to 11.04 or try kubuntu?\nthanks for any advise in advance. \n\nA: There is no need to remove Ubuntu before you install Kubuntu; Its installer will offer you to use the old Ubuntu partition on the hard drive.\nIf you want to check which hard drive and partition this is, in Ubuntu, go to System → Administration → Disk Utility. Find your hard disk and parition and look for the \"device\" field. The openSUSE installer will let you install there, and wipe out all of the data that was there before. It will also install a new boot-loader and detect all of the operating systems on your computer.\nor try \nYou can install on top of the Ubuntu installation without any preparation.

I have an old pc,so i am curious about runing ubuntu 11.10 or 12.04 on my configuration.\nIs it possible to run them on this:\nProcessor :AMD Athlon +2200 1.8GHz overclocked to 2GHz.\nMotherboard: ASUS A7V8X-X.\nGraphic card: Diamond ATI Radeon 9550 128mb.\nRAM: 1 GB (256mb+256mb+512mb) Kingston DDR SDRAM.\nHDD: 160GB (80GB+80G) Maxtor.\n\n\nA: Yes. I have nearly the same (Athlon +2000@2Ghz + Asus A7V880 + Ati Radeon 9600 non-Pro + 1 Gb Ram +80 GB HDD). It works very good! I use it with 2 monitors, with unity-2d.\n\nA: Both 11.10 and 12.04 can run on that system. However...\nThere is a particular problem with Ubuntu 12.04's installer and some older Athlon CPUs, including the 2200+. The installer will crash at an early stage unless you run a workaround. Fortunately the workaround is pretty simple.\nWhen you boot the Ubuntu 12.04 live CD (or USB), choose 'Try Ubuntu before you install'. It will (eventually!) boot into the Ubuntu desktop. Click on the Ubuntu icon (top left) and type 'terminal'. Click the Terminal icon that comes up. In the terminal, type:\nsudo apt-get remove ubiquity-slideshow-ubuntu\n\nand press enter. This will remove the package that causes the problem. You can then double-click on the 'Install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS' icon and you should be fine.\nI should add, though, that there is another unfortunate bug associated with this range of old Athlon CPUs, and that is that Adobe's latest version of Flash for Linux at the time of writing, 11.2, is compiled in such a way that it no longer runs on these chips. I read that it is possible to install an older version (11.1 is said to work). It's a kludge, but one I am prepared to try!\n\nA: Ubuntu can probably run decently on those specs. Correct me if i'm wrong.\n\nA: Because you have only 1GB RAM, I would discourage running a 3D desktop shell such as Unity (3D) or Gnome Shell. If you feel that Unity 2D is too slow or you simply don't like the interface, fear not! You still have other options such as Xfce and LXDE (easiest way to use them are by downloading Xubuntu or Lubuntu). Considering your machine has its age, you shouldn't have any driver issues with an existing release so there's no need to jump the gun on Ubuntu 12.04, I strongly recommend waiting for its release. Feel free to try live CD's of Ubuntu, Xubuntu and Lubuntu 11.10, you can even mess around with them, install them to your system (make sure you have your files backed up), that way when Ubuntu 12.04 comes out, you'll most likely already know which desktop environment you'll want to use.\nXfce and LXDE in their most recent versions have eject buttons for removable media in their file managers, I'd say they're very user-friendly. Xfce even supports editing the applications menu graphically. Personally I'd much rather run Xfce or LXDE on such a machine than Unity 2D, and spare the RAM for apps that matter, such as Firefox, LibreOffice and GIMP.\n\nA: Yes  both Version is Run fine . but only with unity2D u may refer to this link if u want further details \n\nA: That should not be a problem at all. Indeed, I would expect 12.04 to run quite a bit faster on that hardware than 11.10 did. The  one question is graphics. I don't think your VGA is supported by AMD, so you probably won't be able to use their proprietary driver, but I think the open radeon driver should work. It is likely that you won't be able to use the default Unity shell (Compiz-based), but Unity 2D should work well since it uses Metacity. And of course, Ubuntu has many other shells available as well. \nI can't see any reason why you shouldn't be able to get many more years out of that box. \n", "Q: How to convert WMA lossless to FLAC? I have some CDs that I want to convert to FLAC. Banshee can't find their metadata, but Windows Media Player can.\nI figured there are two workarounds:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rip all CDs using Windows Media Player WMA-lossless, and batch-convert to FLAC with metadata.\n\n*Tweak Banshee to connect to Windows Media Player metadata sources\n\n\nAny ideas how to do it? I'm preferably looking for a command-line method.\n\nA: I've used avconv with great success. It's a command-line utility and has a vast number of options.\nThe avconv utility is provided by the libav-tools  package (starting in Ubuntu 12.04). To install that, click that link or run:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libav-tools\n\nI needed only the most basic conversion of WMA to FLAC (the same as you're asking for). To do that with avconv\navconv -i <input-filename.wma> <output-filename.flac>\n\nFor more information, see man avconv.\nTo convert all WMA files inside a directory, you can use the following script:\nfor file in *.wma; do avconv -i \"${file}\" \"${file%%.wma}.flac\"; done\n\n\nA: To convert WMA to FLAC, you could try soundconverter, a graphical application, but it allows to add multiple files and directories. It keeps the metadata if the output format supports it. To install it enter into your terminal this: sudo apt-get install soundconverter\n\nA: ffmpeg is my tool of choice here.\n# to convert a single file...\nffmpeg -i file.wav -c:a flac file.flac\n\n# ... or all wma files in the current directory (similar to the avconv answer)\nfor file in *.wma; do ffmpeg -i \"${file}\" -c:a flac \"${file%%.wma}.flac\"; done\n\n", "Q: How do i dual boot windows 7 and ubuntu without having to go through 2 windows when i boot ubuntu?

Ubuntu 10.10 will reach End Of Life in a few weeks, when 12.04 is released (which I'd really recommend upgrading to).\nThe crash likely had nothing to do with Ubuntu One, but it's impossible to know that as you asked a question here, instead of reporting the bug. If things crash, please report bugs, rather than asking questions on askUbuntu (which is not a bug reporting forum).\n\nA: Well in my case I have music stored on a network share. I deleted some files from the library on another computer. When i started up Rhythmbox it still showed these songs for a couple of seconds and then vanishes.

The problem is the plugin has hardcoded the --no-hosts string.\nSo one solution is to comment out the line that load the plugin in the NetworkManager config file and restart NetworkManager :\nsudo mv /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf.bak\nsudo bash -c 'cat /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf.bak | sed -e \"s/^\\(dns=dnsmasq\\)$/#\\1/\" > /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf'\nsudo restart network-manager\n\nAnother solution is to wrap dnsmasq to filter out the undesired arguments:\nsudo mv /usr/sbin/dnsmasq /usr/sbin/dnsmasq.bin\nsudo bash -c 'cat > /usr/sbin/dnsmasq' << EOF\n#!/bin/sh\ndnsmasq=/usr/sbin/dnsmasq.bin\n\nexec $dnsmasq `echo $@ | sed -e s/--no-hosts//`\nEOF\n\nsudo chmod 755 /usr/sbin/dnsmasq\n\nPlease mark the bug as affecting you.\nAnother solution without patching system files\ncat /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/hosts.conf \n\naddn-hosts=/etc/hosts\n\n\nA: dnsmasq should automatically use the /etc/hosts file.  This can be disabled by the -h command line option or no-hosts configuration option.  I would not expect either to be set in the default configuration. \nTry forcing dnsmasq to reload its hosts file.  (Changes to the configuration file require a restart).  Either of these commands should work.\nservice dnsmasq reload\n\nkill -HUP $(pidof dnsmasq)\n\nIf you are working with a system that has no-hosts specified you should be able to use the addn-hosts option to override it.  Normally, this would be used to read an additional file in /etc/hosts format.  This can be used to specify additional host data that you want DNS to provide, but don't want in your /etc/hosts file.  This can be used to allow the package manager and related tools to manage /etc/hosts while additional hosts data is provided in an alternate file.\n", "Q: Skype doesn't work through Empathy 3.4 but works in Pidgin I'm trying to connect to Skype throught Empathy 3.4 in Ubuntu 12.04 i386 (last update installed)\nI installed the pidgin-skype plugin, but there is no bigbrownchunx-skype-dbus protocol in list.\nIt works fine with Pidgin.\n\nA: Hey man I couldn't find an answer yet either.

If you insist on installing Gimp 2.7 using that PPA (and you can, it may be messy but it is reversible), you could edit that repository in your software sources to point to oneiric instead of precise (just change the codename in Distribution). You do risk encountering some dependency issues (in which case I'd recommend removing the PPA and not continuing with the install). This is generally safe to do with a handful of repositories such as GetDeb, PlayDeb and Oracle VirtualBox, but Gimp does have a few more dependencies in the official repositories, so although this is highly discouraged, you can do it at your own risk and there's a good chance you won't have any issues with it.\n\nA: The ppa's 2.7.5 would be fine in 12.04 if the source entries where edited as in the answer by titaniumtux, other than the fact one package is broken\nThe reason the current builds won't work is because there was an error in the libgimp control file that created an unsatisfiable dependency in the deb package. Once the error is corrected the ppa will be fine & likely would also get precise packages.\nI did email the ppa owner almost a month ago, so far no re-builds\nYou can actually still use the ppa if desired, you'd only have to download the libgimp2.0_  package and thru various means 'unpack' it, fix the control file, re-package & install. Then gimp, ect. would install fine\nIf inclined then ask another question on how to do if you don't know.\nFor reference the 'bad' entry in the .deb's control is highlighted below, there is no libglib2.0, the correct name for the package  is also in the depends - libglib2.0-0\nDepends: libc6 (>= 2.11), libcairo2 (>= 1.2.4), libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 (>= 2.22.0), libglib2.0-0 (>= 2.30.2), libgtk2.0-0 (>= 2.24.0), libpango1.0-0 (>= 1.22.0), libglib2.0 (>= 2.30.2)\n\nA: Follow up on dougs answer - here's how I did it (warning, this might mess up your system and perhaps your life as well):\nInstall the oneiric ppa as described in the other answers.\nIn the following, replace xxx with your architecture.\nGo to http://ppa.launchpad.net/matthaeus123/mrw-gimp-svn/ubuntu/pool/main/g/gimp/?C=M;O=D\nand download libgimp and gimp debs for your architecture.\nExtract the debs: right-click in nautilus, select \"Extract here\". It will create a nice subdir for you with the same name as the deb-file.\nIn libgimp:\nEdit DEBIAN/control and remove , libglib2.0 (>= 2.30.2) from the Depends: section. You'll see libglib is listed twice. We wan't to get rid of the last one. Save the file.\nNow we want to create a new deb file with our change applied:\nOpen a terminal and cd to the path where you downloaded and extracted the deb files. Run \ndpkg-deb --build libgimp2.0_2.7.5-2012020902~oo_xxx/\n\nthen install the deb: sudo dpkg -i libgimp2.0_2.7.5-2012020902~oo_xxx.deb\nNext we install gimp-data from the ppa: sudo apt-get install gimp-data\nThe gimp-package depends on a version of libpoppler that has been updated with Ubuntu 12.04. We will now brutally change the dependency. I do not know what the consequences of this will be. If the api has changed pdf-handling probably won't work. \nIn the terminal cd into the dir where the gimp deb was extracted to. Again edit the control file. This time, change libpoppler-glib6 to libpoppler-glib8 (>= 0.18). Save the file and rebuild and install the deb as you did with libgimp.\n", "Q: Have I fixed my partition problem with os x 10.5.8? Are my GPT and MBR back to normal? I'm new to linux and I have overstepped by abilities.  I tried dual booting os x 10.5.8 with ubuntu 11.10 with rEFIt, but I been having problems with partitioning.  Instead of enduring more headaches, I've made the decision to simply use ubuntu on VirtualBox.  I've tried to return my HDD to normal, but I am looking for confirmation that my partitions are ok.  Here is the report from partition inspector:\n*** Report for internal hard disk ***\n\nCurrent GPT partition table:\n #      Start LBA      End LBA  Type\n 1         409640    233917359  Mac OS X HFS+\n\nCurrent MBR partition table:\n # A    Start LBA      End LBA  Type\n 1              1    234441647  ee  EFI Protective\n\nMBR contents:\n Boot Code: GRUB\n\nPartition at LBA 409640:\n Boot Code: None\n File System: HFS Extended (HFS+)\n Listed in GPT as partition 1, type Mac OS X HFS+\n\nAlso, my HDD directory has a bunch of extra folders in them and they appear to be ubuntu related, although it is no longer installed.  folders like bin, sbin, cores, var, user, and so on.  Those folders aren't supposed to be there, right?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: You may be missing an EFI System Partition (ESP), which is a partition used by the firmware to store boot loaders and drivers. An ESP isn't strictly required on Macs, but Apple does use it to help out with firmware updates, so it's probably best if you have one. Note, however, that I'm only passingly familiar with Partition Inspector; I'm not 100% certain that it even shows ESPs. If it's missing, you can create it with a tool like OS X's standard \"gpt\" command or my GPT fdisk (gdisk). You'll also need to create a new FAT filesystem on it with (IIRC) newfs_msdos. Sorry I'm a little foggy on the details; my Mac is booted into Linux at the moment, so I can't check the options.\nAs to the directories you've identified (bin, sbin, and so on), these are standard Unix directories. They're present on both Linux and OS X systems. You should not delete them. In a normal Linux/OS X dual-boot configuration, Linux won't write anything to the OS X partition, so it's very unlikely that there are any traces of Linux left on your OS X partition. (The closest thing to an exception is rEFIt, which is a boot manager and so not strictly a part of either OS; however, rEFIt often gets installed on the OS X partition.)\n", "Q: How do I change file system in recovery mode to read-write mode? I have messed up my sudoers file and I want to change the permission on it. \nWhen I login in recovery mode, I cannot run the command chmod as it is read-only option.\nI tried mount -o remount,rw / in recovery mode.

I mistyped an option in fstab for the / directory (very bad, I know).\nIn order to mount in recovery mode with read write option the mentioned solutions did not work for me.\nI simply chose the kernel with recovery mode option and pressed e to modify the boot parameter from ro to rw.\n\nA: I did some web searching on \"Recover Mode Read Only\" and came across this post on LinuxQuestions.org website.\n\n\n*\n\n*Shutdown the computer\n\n*Boot into Recovery Mode --After BIOS load, hold down Shift key to\naccess the grub menu --Once in grub menu, select the entry ending in\n\"(recovery mode)\"\n\n*From the next menu selected option to enter Root Session\n\n*At the root session, execute command mount -o rw,remount / to\nremount the filesystem as read-write\n\n\nA: I always use following way to change into read/write mode\n\n\n*\n\n*Login in Safe Mode\n\n*From the Menu just go to Grub option, it will give a message like Updating grub will mount your system in read/write mode. Just chose yes to mount your system in read/write mode.

I'm looking for a program which acts as a proxy manager for Ubuntu just as Proxifier does for windows.\n\nA: According to the description of the homepage of Proxifier, the software Privoxy looks like a good recommendation. Privoxy is a proxy application which filters a lot privacy related things (cookies, webbugs etc.). However the software allows you to configure HTTP, SOCKS and other types of software and is very flexible. I am sure that this is a good replacement.\nAfter reading your comment I can go  a bit more into detail:\nThe central configuration file is /etc/privoxy/config. The directory /etc/privoxy has some other files, too. The config file is very well documented.\nLets assume you want to send all traffic to example.com though proxy-a and all traffic to askubuntu.com through proxy-b. SSL/TLS traffic (HTTPS) should not use any proxy. So you add the following lines:\nforward .example.com proxy-a\nforward .askubuntu.com proxy-b\nforward :443 .\n\nThe keyword forward is followed by a site or a pattern. It can be an IP address, hostname or a regular expression. All traffic which matches will be send to the last entry in the line. This the proxy address. When you use a . (a dot) a the end of a line, it means that the pattern before will not use any proxy. You will find more information at the handbook.\n\nA: I know its a very old question.

I'm a long time Linux advocate and user (since around '98). I rarely boot up Windows, but when I do, it's secretly frustrating to me how fast things seem to be. For example, when you type in Ubuntu (after typing in Windows), there seems to me to be a very slight but perceptible lag between key press and character appearance. This also seems to be true in \nwindow rendering (minimize/maximize) and so on.\nThe end result is that the Windows 7 desktop experience seems more performant and zippy compared to Ubuntu 11.x or 12.04 (I've comparison-tested both). \nAs a fan of Ubuntu and Linux, this bothers me. Is this lag caused by the extra layer that X windows brings? Is this what Wayland aims to address? Or, is it something else?\n\nA: I think this may be more of an issue with hardware support on your specific computer - on every machine I've used Ubuntu and Windows on, Ubuntu has been faster in starting programs and booting up etc. It's only the Unity dash which seems to be slow when typing characters, but that's nothing to do with Linux - just some inefficient coding on the part of the Ubuntu devs I guess. But anyway it's supposed to be much sped up in 12.04 (which is only a month away!). :)\nIf you post hardware details then perhaps someone will find a technical solution to the speed issues on your machine.\n", "Q: Wifi hotspot disconnected after some time I am trying to use my Ubuntu system as Wifi Hotspot, but for some reason Hotspot get disconnected  on its own.

I am thinking it should run, unless I didn't something really silly.\nAlso, do you think it's ok to move this bash script to /bin?\n\nA: One thing at a time:  \nFirst let's give you a user based bin folder:\ncd ~/ && mkdir bin\n\nYou want to use crontab.  Let's start with something really simple:  \n* * * * * touch /tmp/testing.txt\n\nOkay, so that works  \nNow let's try running a script that does the same    \n* * * * * /home/username/bin/touchtest.sh\n\nto run once a minute until you get it working\nNo you don't need a ./ in the middle of the line.  ./ is for when you are giving relative urls.\nOkay, so that works  \nNow let's try running a script that calls xmessage  \n* * * * * /home/username/bin/rebootwarn.sh\n\nnot working  \nFirst we need to not depend on environment variables.

Are there any hooks for per-user configuration to do before the xserver starts? .xinitrc and .xsession don't seem to be run by lightdm. Even better would be a solution requiring entry point that would do key remappings regardless of window manager, but it seems different window managers have different conventions of how to hook in.\n\nA: If you're just interested in remapping keys in a manner that works for any wm, I think I have a way for any typical X wm but you would probably have to configure it per wm.  For example, in Awesome, I add the following line to the end of my rc.lua:\nawful.util.spawn_with_shell(\"/usr/bin/setxkbmap -option caps:swapescape -option altwin:ctrl_win\")\n\nwith my other autostart items.  The above options will swap escape and capslock and map the \"windows\" keys (and the usual ctrl keys) to ctrl.\nWhatever DE or wm you use, it should offer a way to autostart commands.  Autostarting the appropriate setxkbmap command  should remap your keys.  I've done this in various window managers.  AFAIK, this is the reliable, \"proper\" way to remap keys, in contrast to xmodmap, which seems flakey.\nTo remap the keys you want, you need to know the appropriate options and key values to pass.  You can find a list in /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/xorg.lst\nOf course, you could use setxkbmap in .xinitrc also, but as you pointed out, lightdm doesn't seem to use it when loading the sessions.  Since I use lightdm too, I don't usually think of editing xinitrc, but it just struck me that there should be a way of starting a user-defined X session through lightdm... and I found this answer.  That might be more in line with what you want to do.\n", "Q: Change is key-mapping is not remembered in Ubuntu 10.04 I have mapped my PageDown key to the Return command on my keyboard as the original Return key is broken. I used the following command [ I'm using Ubuntu 10.04 ]:\nxmodmap -e 'keycode 117=Return'\n\nIt works all right. However, it does not work after I restart the system. How to make the system remember this setting forever ?\n\nA: Just add\nkeycode 117=Return\nto the file .Xmodmap in your user directory. (You might need to create it)\n", "Q: How to restart only missing/invisible mouse pointer/cursor? For some reason, the mouse pointer on my Ubuntu 10.04 PC disappears after the computer is woken up from suspend. That PC is missing a keyboard, so I can fix this by logging via ssh, and issuing: \nsudo service gdm restart\n\n... however, this basically restarts gnome, and will close any applications that may have been running. \nAnother way to solve this is to set up that PC as a synergy slave - and then move the mouse from the synergy master to the slave desktop; this brings the mouse pointer back. \nIs it possible to run some command, such that I don't need to restart X (or gdm) but I'll effectively restart the mouse pointer code? Then I could put this into a script on the desktop, and be able to recover the mouse pointer after suspend without needing a second machine (even with the mouse pointer invisible, mouseovers on icons are still rendered, so I could target this icon).\n\nA: this may fix the problem.\nIf you are stuck with no mouse movement on your laptop (touchpad) then press the key combinations Alt+F2 and type in\ngksudo modprobe -r psmouse\n\nType in the password, press enter, and then press Alt+F2 again for entering the following\ngksudo modprobe psmouse\n\nThats it. Your mouse pointer will start working again.\nIf you like to do it through the terminal, then type in gnome-terminal after pressing Alt+F2\nWhen the terminal open up type the following\nsudo modprobe -r psmouse\n\nor\nsudo modprobe psmouse\n\nIf your usb mouse is getting stuck, then use the following command after pressing Alt+F2\ngksudo /etc/init.d/hotplug restart\n\n\nA: This answer from It's F.O.S.S. worked for me once.\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.cursor active false\n\nThe second time, it did not work, and neither did any of the above suggestions. So after these, I just closed the lid of my laptop to suspend it, reopened it, and the pointer was back.\n\nA: Had that problem the other day. I switched to another terminal (Ctrl+Alt+F1) and then came back to the current window (Ctrl+Alt+F7). It did the trick for me.\n\nA: I am using Xubuntu 16.04. The suggestion posted in this answer by Ulad Kasach worked for me.\n\nBring the cursor back with Ctrl+Alt+F1 followed by Ctrl+Alt+F7\n\n\nA: Had this issue with my laptop's touchpad mouse missing. Using your keyboard for navigation, open launcher (windows key) and type \"mouse\". In the modal that pops up, check if Touchpad section is in the \"ON\" position.\n\nA: Finally, found a solution for this: \nFrom #696855 - How do you hide the mouse pointer under Linux/X11? - Stack Overflow; I heard about unclutter, so just ran\nsudo apt-get install unclutter\n\nAnd then put the following in a script on the desktop, called, say unclutter.sh:\nunclutter -idle 1 -root -grab -visible\n\n... and make sure you've done chmod +x unclutter.sh. \nThen, after the mouse pointer disappears after suspend, use mouseover of icons to target the script and run it; this will start unclutter, which will simply hide (the already invisible) mouse pointer after 1 second of mouse inactivity; but then when you move the mouse after that, finally the mouse pointer will show :) ... however note that to stop unclutter after that, you'd have to do from terminal: \nsudo killall unclutter\n\n... as unclutter would be, at that point, running in the background. \n\nNote: also tried, via #15 / Bug #337926 “vino: mouse cursor stays in upper left corner” : Bugs : “vino” package : Ubuntu, to use: \nxdotool mousemove 100 100\n\nbut this does not make the mouse pointer show again. \nBtw, one can look in the synergy source, WebSVN - synergy - /trunk/, and the \"reset\" of the mouse pointer seems to be coded in ./lib/platform/CXWindowsScreen.cpp. \n\nA: I've tried many things, including restarting the GNOME shell, suspending, and executing\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.cursor active false\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.cursor active true\ndconf write /org/gnome/settings-daemon/peripherals/touchpad/tochpad-enabled false\ndconf write /org/gnome/settings-daemon/peripherals/touchpad/tochpad-enabled true\ndconf write /org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/cursor/active false\ndconf write /org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/cursor/active true\n\nWhat finally helped me was to restart the gsd via gnome-settings-daemon --replace.\n\nA: It is also worth to check battery of your mouse if it is a wireless one, the battery may just went flat with such effect of unmoving cursor.\n\nA: Restart the touchpad. One way using xinput.\n\n*\n\n*Find touchpad device id using xinput --list\n\n*Stop touchpad: xinput disable id_found_in_step_1\n\n*Start touchpad: xinput enable id_found_in_step_1\nThis just worked for me now on Ubuntu 18.04!\n\nA: If you are using gnome, this worked for me.\nRun the command below and note your touch pad id. For example, mine is 12 labelled id=12\nxinput --list\n\nRun\nxinput set-prop 12 \"Device Enabled\" 0\n\nTo disable your touchpad.\nThen run\nxinput set-prop 12 \"Device Enabled\" 1\n\nTo enable it again.\nRefresh xorg by holding down command + r. Type r and click enter key.\n\nA: If you are using a USB mouse, and are on location with the computer in question, then the first thing you should try is to unplug the mouse for a moment and then plug it back in.\nWorks for me every time.\nI hibernate my computer each night and very occasionally upon awakening, the mouse pointer is missing but my USB keyboard works.\n", "Q: How can I port packages from OpenSuSE to Ubuntu? My question stems from the fact that I could use my Synaptics Clickpad perfectly in OpenSuSE, but cannot in Ubuntu 12.04. Earlier versions also had problems.\nI got the xorg-x11-driver-input-7.6-41.38.2.src.rpm package from OpenSuSE sources, however, make complains about a missing xorg-server package. I'm not surprised, the names in Ubuntu seem not exactly the same.\nSince I have come across such problems where the solution exists, can anyone give me a good starting point on how to start porting and writing code for Ubuntu?\n\nA: OpenSuse is built on .rpm packages which are not interchangeable with .debs.\nYour best bet is to use \"Alien\" to repackage / transform RPM's to DEB\nto get alien:\nsudo apt-get install alien \n\nalien RPM/how to\n", "Q: What are the default layout settings in gnome-terminal?

Is there a simple way to bypass this prompt or maybe add \"yes\" in the alias somewhere?\n\nA: apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y && apt-get autoremove && apt-get autoclean\n\nThis updates the packages, upgrades the packages, removes unused packages, then removes old versions of packages.\nYou can copy paste that into:\nnano -w yourscript.sh\n\nthen\nchmod 777 yourscript.sh\n\nthen\n./yourscript.sh\n\nSo long as you use su before all those steps, which I always do.\n\nA: Sure, although I have never tried it as an alias but it should work:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y upgrade\n\n\nA: apt-get -o Dpkg::Options::='--force-confold' --force-yes -fuy dist-upgrade\"\n\nTo clarify Dpkg::Options::='--force-confold' from the man-page:\n\n--force-confold: do not modify the current configuration file, the new version is installed with a .dpkg-dist suffix. With this option alone, even configuration files that you have not modified are left untouched. You need to combine it with --force-confdef to let dpkg overwrite configuration files that you have not modified.\n\n\nA: You could also do it quietly and then get a notification when it's all done. The downside to this is you will only see errors reported and will not see what is updated. \nsudo apt-get update -qq && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -qq && echo \"All up to date now!\" && notify-send \"All up to date now!\"\n\n\nA: @wojox answer is correct, but you can take the alias even further for more functionality. I have been using this for quite some time now without issue. This will perform the upgrades (confirming with -y) and then testing to see if a reboot is required. If a reboot is required, you can do so by pressing [ENTER], or cancel and reboot later by pressing [CTRL+C]. If no reboot is required, the alias finishes letting you know so.\nMy alias is sur for sudo upgrade reboot, but feel free to name it what you choose. Add the following to your .bashrc file:\nalias sur='sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && if sudo test -f /var/run/reboot-required; then read -p \"A reboot is required to finish installing updates. Press [ENTER] to reboot now, or [CTRL+C] to cancel and reboot later.\" && sudo reboot; else echo \"A reboot is not required. Exiting...\"; fi'\n\nYou can continue to chain more commands if you would like to do more with the same alias. Here is the complete alias from my .bashrc that will also remove unused packages:\nalias sur='sudo apt update && sudo apt dist-upgrade -y && sudo apt autoremove -y && if sudo test -f /var/run/reboot-required; then read -p \"A reboot is required to finish installing updates. Press [ENTER] to reboot now, or [CTRL+C] to cancel and reboot later.\" && sudo reboot; else echo \"A reboot is not required. Exiting...\"; fi'\n\nI actually stumbled across this thread while checking to see if there is an option to skip the prompt for configuration file overwrites, which was provided in @Vadim's answer above! My new alias is this:\nalias sur='sudo apt update && sudo apt -o Dpkg::Options::=\"--force-confdef\" dist-upgrade -y && sudo apt autoremove -y && if sudo test -f /var/run/reboot-required; then read -p \"A reboot is required to finish installing updates. Press [ENTER] to reboot now, or [CTRL+C] to cancel and reboot later.\" && sudo reboot; else echo \"A reboot is not required. Exiting...\"; fi'\n\nI then push this new .bashrc file to each of my managed servers simply with:\nwhile read HOST; do scp .bashrc username@$HOST:/home/username; done < managedhosts.txt\n\n\nA: Defining a function has been the most straightforward, universal method I've found.\nI've personally never gotten the update && -y upgrade to work correctly. Some distros have a problem with a single command (or alias) using the && operator and -y argument together.\nfunction update ()\n{\n    sudo apt update\n    sudo apt -y upgrade\n}\n\n", "Q: how to connect to wireless and wifi?

Go to the windows 7 computer that is working with the wireless. Click the wireless icon in the taskbar. In the menu that appears, right click on the network that you are trying to connect to, and click properties. Check the box  that says show charachters (this requires administratior priveleges).

Mine is of the most basic element I think as this kind of thing is really out of my ball park.\nAnyway I wanted to if by installing ubuntu on my old laptop hdd (I now use it as external storage), can I run it on my laptop which has windows installed. \nI can't take the chance of installing on the laptop as I'm currently studying, and I have a years worth of work on here (most backed up elsewhere), and will be using it a lot. \nHowever there are some programs I can use if I can get ubuntu that will be helpful for one or two classes.\n\nA: Yes, you need to install Ubuntu on the external drive. After that when you computer is booting, hit F8 or whatever gets you to the boot menu. If your laptop does not have a quick boot menu, than you can hit Delete to enter the bios setup. Change the boot order so the external is on the top of the list. There will also be CDROM and others. This menu tells the bios which device to try to boot first. I.e. If CDROM is at the top or has first priority than it will be checked first. If no boot media is found I.e No cd is in the drive, than the bios will check the second option on the list for some boot media. Note: Most computers have a quick boot menu by pressing a key in the bios start up (Usually F8). You will see the External in that menu by its' manufacturers name.\n", "Q: Getting yuvmotionfps working on 64-bit Ubuntu I'm trying to get yuvmotionfps (http://jcornet.free.fr/linux/yuvmotionfps.html) working on ubuntu 11.10 64-bit.\nWhen I configure it normally I get errors saying \"videodev.h not found\"\nSomeone here said he managed to get it installed:\nhttp://crazedmuleproductions.blogspot.com/2010/08/building-cincv-from-source-ubuntu-32.html?showComment=1282346714442#c7687855630832861436\nWhen I follow these steps I still get the same errors, apparently videodev.h is depreciated so I tried replacing instances of it with videodev2.h.

I use Zotero to organize papers and sync between my home and work computers. I've got enough papers that Zotero's 100MB free limit is looming.\nIs there a way to retarget Zotero to use Ubuntu One's cloud storage instead of Zotero's?\n\nA: Absolutely, positively do not move your Zotero folder into the Ubuntu One sync folder. The Zotero folder contains the Zotero database - zotero.sqlite - and syncing that via sync services like Ubuntu One, Dropbox etc. will very likely lead to database corruption. There are dozens of threads on the Zotero forums of people who wanted to save a couple of bucks by doing this with dropbox and ended up with a hopelessly corrupted database.\nUbuntu One does not support WebDAV, so that's out.\nYou can put just the storage folder within the Zotero data folder into Ubuntu One. I believe it's possible to designate that folder to be synced by Ubuntu One, otherwise create a symlink to it in the Ubuntu One sync folder. This will allow you to back-up files online and sync them between different computers, but as opposed to syncing through Zotero storage, you won't be able to access the files through your library at zotero.org, nor will you be able to share files in groups.\n\nA: You might be able to achieve this by going into Zotero's preferences, and setting a custom data directory location. Then mark that folder to be synced by Ubuntu One (or put it inside the Ubuntu One sync folder in the first place).\n", "Q: Is there an application or method to log of data transfers?

Please suggest me the possible solution for this.Is it possible to use the same /dev/xvdb partition with another instance.\n\nA: The answer is twofold.\nWorkaround: use /dev/xvdb (/mnt) for temporary data\nThis is the so called ephemeral storage of your Amazon EC2 instance and its characteristics are vastly different than the of the persistent Amazon EBS storage in use elsewhere. In particular, this ephemeral storage will be lost on stop/start cycles and can generally go away, so you definitely don't want to put anything of lasting value there, i.e. only put temporary data there you can afford to lose or rebuild easily, like a swap file or strictly temporary data in use during computations. Of course you might store huge indexes there for example, but must be prepared to rebuild these after the storage has been cleared for whatever reason (instance reboot, hardware failure, ...).\nSolution: resize /dev/xvda1 (/) to gain desired storage\nThis is the so called Root Device Storage of your Amazon EBS-backed EC2 instance, which facilitates Amazon EBS for flexibility and durability in particular, i.e. data put there is reasonably safe and survives instance failures; you can increase flexibility and durability even further by taking regular snapshots of your EBS volume, which are stored on Amazon S3, featuring the well known 99.999999999% durability.\nThis snapshot features enables you to solve your problem in turn, insofar you can replace your current 8GB EBS root storage (/dev/xvda1) with one more or less as large as you desire. The process is outlined in Eric Hammond's excellent article Resizing the Root Disk on a Running EBS Boot EC2 Instance:\n\nAs long as you are ok with a little down time on the EC2 instance (few\n  minutes), it is possible to change out the root EBS volume with a\n  larger copy, without needing to start a new instance.\n\nIf you properly prepare the steps he describes (I highly recommend to test them with a throw away EC2 instance first to get acquainted with the procedure, or automate it via a tailored script even), you should be able to finish the process with a few minutes downtime only indeed.\nMost of the outlined steps can be performed via the AWS Management Console as well, which avoids dealing with the Amazon EC2 API Tools; this boils down to:\n\n\n*\n\n*stop (not terminate!) the EC2 instance\n\n*detach the EBS volume from the stopped instance\n\n*create a snapshot of the detached EBS volume\n\n*create a new (larger) EBS volume from the created snapshot\n\n*attach the new EBS volume to the EC2 instance (Important! If this is your root device be sure it to name it exactly as the root device of the instance as it was mentioned e.g (/dev/sda1) or (/dev/xdva1) otherwise it will be attached as a block device and not a root device and you will not be able to start the instance as there will be no root device listed for the instance.)\n\n*SSH into the running instance and confirm everything is in order via df -ah\n\n\n*\n\n*in case your system hasn't automatically resized the file system, you'll need to do this manually as explained in Eric's article\n\n\n\nGood luck!\n\nAlternative\nGiven the versatility and ease of use of these EBS volumes, an additional option would be to attach more EBS volumes to your instance and move clearly separable areas of concern over there.\nFor example, we are using a couple of pretty heavyweight Java applications, each consuming 1-2GB storage per version; to ease upgrading versions and generally be able to move these apps to different instances at my discretion, I've placed them on dedicated EBS volumes each, mount these to an instance and soft link them to the desired location, e.g. usually /var/lib/<app>/<version> and /usr/local/<app>/<version>.\nWith this method, we are currently running EC2 instances with the root device storage still at its default size of 8GB (just like yours), but sometimes up to 8 EBS volumes with varying sizes (1-15GB) attached as well.\nYou need to be aware of potential network performance issues though, insofar all these EBS volumes are using the very same LAN for their I/O, which might yield respective performance gains even, or saturate your network in extreme cases - so as usual this depends on the use case and workload at hand.\n\nA: Yep a simple way it to fstab it and then mount it to say /var/www/html/files2/\nthen mkdir /var/www/html/files2/website\nthen ln -s -d /var/www/html/website /var/www/html/files2/website\n\nA: Today I occurred the same problem , when you ceate the new ec2 intance by default EBS is 8GB.\nYou can modify the size of the attached EBS without creating new intace or taking snapshot or detaching EBS..\nHere are the three steps you can follow:\n\n\n*\n\n*Resize EBS Volume\n\n*Resize partition\n\n*Resize partition\nFor the first step go to your AWS console and click EBS and change the desired size and click modify.\n\n\nFor the rest of the steps please follow this article\nif you have any quetion feel free to ask.\nThanks!\n\nA: I suffered for hours today with this issue. So here is a simple guide on what I did to resolve an issue when the file system is full on AWS.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new volume in AWS\n\n*Attach additional volume to instance\n\n*Format volume to required filesystem\n\n*Find EMPTY folder on drive that is full (e.g. /mnt)\n\n*Mount the new volume to the drive that is full (mount new volume to /mnt)\n\n*Move the largest file you can find to the new volume\n\n*Create a symbolic link to the new file\n\n\nThis will create space on the old file system and you will still have access to all the files. \nHave fun!\n", "Q: Really Broken MySql Setup I have been having trouble with my MySql setup.

It's an electron based terminal that's fairly neat, stable, and easy to use with lots of configuration options.\nhttps://hyper.is/\n\nA: Update as of 3/2021\nWhile I in general prefer GTK applications in terminal emulators the reigning champ Qt is being overtaken not by them but by projects eschewing traditional GUI toolkits entirely!\nMy current picks for my favorite Linux iTerm2 replacements are, in no particular order:\nWezterm\nHas GPU acceleration, built in multiplexer (tabs and splits), ligature support, built in imgcat support, background images, transparency, shell integration, almost everything one could want. One feature I miss is profiles, but you can always have multiple config files (author made the interesting choice of using Lua rather than ini/toml/yaml/json for the config file). The only other thing I want is a hotkey dropdown terminal, not the end of the world. If you're a ricer, this is the terminal emulator for you. It's a newer project but this may be the iTerm2 killer. Go give the project some love.\nTilix\nFantastic and polished terminal emulator, been my daily driver for a while now. Not on par with iTerm2 in terms of feature set, but a very solid choice for a daily driver. It just works. I'm not wild about the choice of configuring through dconf rather than just having a text file in $HOME/.config, but not the end of the world.\nKonsole\nThe stock KDE terminal is a solid choice and in addition to a rich feature set it's the only terminal I know of that comes out of box with that recent MacOS-ish translucency blur onion skin effect (a.k.a. gaussian blur).\nQterminal\nNot quite as polished as some of the others, but has a very full feature set, see my old review below for more details.\nUpdate as of 8/2020\nSome other worthy contenders not mentioned in the original answer are Tilix and Terminator (check them out!), and my top pick is still for the most part\nQterminal. Linux terminals in general seem to be getting closer to parity with iTerm2.\nCurrent as of 9/2018\nHere's a short list of iterm2 (v3) features:\n\n*\n\n*True color (16 million color) support\n\n*Split panes\n\n*Transparency\n\n*Show images (i.e. imgcat)\n\n*Show inline images e.g. beer mug for homebrew\n\n*Full support/integration for various shells (e.g. zsh, fish)\n\n*Hotkey support (e.g. drop-down terminal)\n\nI haven't even come close to listing them all, although these are the ones I use/care about the most.\nI cannot find a single linux terminal that completely matches this feature set (much less all the ones I didn't mention) but there are linux terminals that come pretty darn close, and can do things that iterm2 can't do (like set per window/pane background images). So here are a few terminals that are probably closest to iterm2 in terms of feature parity:\nQterminal\nThis is an abbreviation of qt terminal. It has full true color support, a dropdown hotkey, transparency, background image, panes, tabs, shell integration. Install via apt. Cons: no built-in way to preview images, it's handling of background images can be wonky.\nKonsole\nThe default KDE terminal (e.g. for kubuntu) has true color, tabs, background image, transparency. Cons: no hot-keyed drop down window, no independent panes, handling of background images can be wonky.\nKitty\nA terminal that AFAICT was just written by one guy with a surprisingly rich feature set: has true color, horizontal splits, transparency, shows images, shell integration. Cons: no background images (there's an issue open), no vertical splits without configuration, no drop down, and while it has packages for several distros ubuntu isn't one of them (have to manually install deps and compile from source).\nTerminology\nThe default terminal of the Enlightenment desktop. It by far has the best image handling of any terminal emulator I've ever used and has been my daily driver for a couple of years now. Has resizable independent panes (vertical and horizontal), tabs, transparency, shell integration, but it lacks true color support (maintainer says he will not be adding it) which is becoming increasingly annoying as a heavy neovim/ncurses user. Cons: 256 color only, no drop down, package in repositories is extremely out of date and installing/compiling the latest version of the EFL dependencies literally takes half an hour.\n\nThere are a lot of other worthy terminal emulators: rxvt-unicode, suckless, termite, etc. but they all have glaring flaws, sometimes even worse than the above. Suckless (st) for example keeps it's configuration in a header file meaning every config change requires a recompile. Many of them (including some of the ones I highlighted above like konsole) seem to be configurable only via mouse, which is beyond annoying for a terminal emulator.\nMany might consider the existence of tmux to make splits/panes a non-issue for the terminal itself. I don't disagree, but YMMV.\nThere's a glaring omission: I haven't mentioned any of the electron-based projects like hyper. That's because I personally keep about 12 different terminal sessions going at a given time, and electron is just too greedy for that kind of usage. Which is a shame, as some of those offerings have impressive feature sets. If you tend to have fewer sessions open you might give one of them a try, I've played with extraterm and it seems a little more in line with what iterm2 offers.\nI wish everyone luck, but my quest for the one true terminal emulator continues onward.\n\nA: You can try terminator, search for it in the Software Centre.\nI'm not sure whether it provides the feature you require, but it offers some other good features of iterm2 like horizontal and vertical window split\nSince April 2020 the source is hosted by github.\n\nA: tilix is the most complete alternative I found so far\n\nA: kitty is a cross-platform terminal emulator with GPU rendering, Python scriptable, and feature-full.\n\nA: Deepin Terminal is a pretty good option. It's a very fast/light terminal. You can install it by running:\nsudo apt install deepin-terminal\n\n\nA: You can use tmux - simple and powerful terminal multiplexer.\nFeatures:\n\n\n*\n\n*Menus for interactive selection of running sessions, windows or\nclients\n\n*Window can be linked to an arbitrary number of sessions\n\n*vi-like or Emacs command mode (with auto completion) for managing tmux\n\n*Lack of built-in serial and telnet clients (which some consider bloat\nfor the terminal multiplexer)\n\n*Easier configuration\n\n*Different command keys—it is not a drop-in replacement for screen,\nbut can be configured to use compatible keybindings\n\n*Vertical and horizontal Window split support\n\n\nSource\n\nTo install press Ctrl+Alt+T and do:\nsudo apt install tmux\n\n\nA: The Trans-terminal-to-hotkey functionality to which you refer is available with the stock gnome terminal (or just terminal) which comes preinstalled in most Ubuntu versions.\nJust right click the icon & choose preferences to set up. You won't see many options until you click 'profile' this gives you a 'load file' if you will.\nAs soon as you've set a profile, you get to customize everything about it, including transparency and keybindings.\nAlot of the other answers refer to Tmux, which can be autoset on start with the terminal. In the 'Commands' section of preferences, uncheck the box above the textbox input line. Type tmux into this textbox. That is it. Tmux will autoload in all future windows.\nAnd dont forget about Profiles. I personally have 3: tmux, vim, and nano. All configured via same process.\nEDIT\nSorry to bring this one back up from the depths, but I have a related info that I believe could save a lot of time for a lot of people. It changed my workflow, so when I saw this back on the front page, I decided to share.\nSince writing this answer, Ive started using Terminator, as it lets you open as many terminals as you need (within reason) and save all of their attributes. So If you want to maximize the terminal, then split it into 6 or 7 terminals, and finally change each to a seperate profile (each with it's own transparency, color, command on launch, etc.), you can save all of that to a single layout.\nI believe it is just\nsudo apt install terminator\n\nTo show you just how powerful this program can be, I will show the current content of my displays. I currently have 3 seperate displays.\nCurrently, this is what is loaded to them:\n\nTo load all this, I type Ctrl + Alt + Super + s.\nNormally, one of the hassles of rebooting, for me, is reconfiguring all the windows that I need. However, they usually need to be in one of 5(ish) layouts. So I just set them each up and to a keybinding with terminator. I still have to open anything else I need, but one of the presets usually gets me most of the way.\nNOTE: the non-terminal apps do not normally start with a layout launch. You have to set them to a terminal's launch command. But with 6 separate terminals launching, that is 6 opportunities to run commands. To launch an outside app, you have to use the ; or && operator. The 'command' is actually anything you can fit on a line, but you have to launch a shell somewhere in there.\n", "Q: Unaligned AIO/DIO I am getting this error on my Ubuntu Server installation:\nkernel: [6622929.119915] EXT4-fs (sda1): Unaligned AIO/DIO on inode 43648079 by java; performance will be poor.\n\nIs this a kernel bug? How do I fix it?\n\nA: It isn't a kernel bug: instead, it is a warning from the kernel that the application in question is using the API (either asynchronous I/O or direct I/O) in an inefficient way.\nFrom the source code:\n/*\n * This tests whether the IO in question is block-aligned or not.\n * Ext4 utilizes unwritten extents when hole-filling during direct IO, and they\n * are converted to written only after the IO is complete.  Until they are\n * mapped, these blocks appear as holes, so dio_zero_block() will assume that\n * it needs to zero out portions of the start and/or end block.  If 2 AIO\n * threads are at work on the same unwritten block, they must be synchronized\n * or one thread will zero the other's data, causing corruption.\n */\n\nSo it means the program in question is trying to use the asynchronous I/O or direct I/O APIs with memory buffers that aren't aligned to the file system block boundaries, which forces the file system to perform the async operations on the file in series to avoid corruption.\nIf the program triggering the warning is one you wrote, then you could adjust how it uses the AIO or DIO APIs to avoid the problem.  If it isn't your program, or you aren't using the APIs directly, then there probably isn't much you can do other than filing a bug report against the problem program.\nFor what it is worth, this warning is rate limited to once per day, so it shouldn't fill up your logs.\n", "Q: How to install monitorx?

Otherwise I find GNOME shell a really productive environment.\n\nA: To resolve the Alt+Click move window dragging problem:\nsudo gconftool-2 --set /org/gnome/desktop/wm/preferences/mouse-button-modifier --type string '<Super>'\n\nDoes the same thing, really, just with a different config tool, and less hunt-and-click.\nFor newer versions using dconf/gsettings, use this:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences mouse-button-modifier \"<Super>\"\n\n\nA: I set Alt+Super like a temporary solution. So I can use the Alt key in Inkscape and Super for activities.\n\nA: In UBUNTU 14.04 LTS use in dconf syntax like\n<Alt><Super>\n\nWorks well for me.\nBTW: If you set something wrong, it starts to move window on every click.\nUse  to navigate to \"Set to Default\" button. And hit .\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to System Settings\n\n*Select Keyboard\n\n*On the bottom left click on ‘Layout Settings’\n\n*Select your language and click the ‘Options’ button on the lower right\n\n*Select ‘Alt/Win key behavior’\n\n*Change it to the one you like. I use ‘Left Alt is swapped with Left Win’.\n\n\nA: In Mint(or Cinnamon) the key can be changed or disabled under\nsystem settings > windows > behavior > 'Special key to move and resize window'\nI have it set to the super/windows key instead.\n\nA: First of all, install dconf-tools .\nTo do that, run the following command:\nsudo apt-get install dconf-tools\n\nThen open it, Alt+F2 → dconf-editor.\nScroll down to org → gnome → desktop → wm → preferences → mouse-button-modifier → Set it to whichever key you like.\n\n\nOr, equivalently,\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences mouse-button-modifier \"<Super>\"\n\nin the terminal. (This requires neither dconf-editor, nor dconf-tools )\nWarning: Setting it to nothing means that all clicks move windows, instead of disabling it!\n\nA: Use the Tweak Tool (gnome-tweak-tool):\nWindows > Window Action Key\n", "Q: Static Application Switcher is empty after show dekstop I'm using the Static Application Switcher to configure my Alt+Tab to cycle through all applications not grouped. So far so good.\nThen I press Super+D to \"hide all normal windows\" (show desktop). This setting is from Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Navigation. This also works\nBUT\nAfter hiding all normal windows has been activated and I press Alt+Tab nothing comes up. I suspect they have been hidden so well that the Application Switcher does no longer see them.\nAnyone know if this can be fixed through settings somewhere?\n\nA: This happens because that plugin works by default on \"active\" windows.\nYou should consider associating Alt+Tab shortcut to ALL windows.\nGive it a try:\n\n\n*\n\n*CCSM/Application Switcher/Association tab.\n\n*Get rid of Next window / Previous window keyboard shortcuts and apply them to \n\n*Next window (All windows) / Previous window (All windows).\n\n\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Detailed quickly tutorial Hi I kindly need a more detailed quickly tutorial that explain the python code./ For example, adding a login form to an application\n\nA: Since you don't tell us what you already found, I will just give a list of hopefully useful links:\nQuickly on the Ubuntu App Developer site\nPython Gtk3\nPython Gtk2\nAcire Python snippets\n\nA: Quickly seems to be dead project since 2012.

Per se, if you update your system you are probably already using it.\nIf you want the updated packages you need to add the necessary PPA from the GNOME3 team\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3 && sudo apt-get update\n\nAfter that you should do an apt-get upgrade to install the missing packages.\nIt makes no sense to install them individually, but, if that is what you want the current missing packages are: aisleriot, gcr, gnome-disk-utility, gnome-documents, gnome-keyring, gnome-session, libgnome-keyring, seahorse, totem, tracker and udisks2.\nInstalling them individually will pull out further dependencies for them and so on, in the end it will be the same as just updating your system.\n", "Q: Application for resizing an image by reducing dimensions precisely?

I have Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (Lucid Lynx).\nI've noticed recently every file on my hard drive gets the executable privilege, even every text files, so when I open it a pop-up window asks me what to do (run in terminal-Display-Cancel-Run).\nI tried to change permissions in the terminal as sudo chmod a-x -Rv /media/D/*.

The difference in memory usage between Gnome Panel and Unity is more noticeable (in my experience) but you can reinstall Gnome Panel or try a lighter desktop like LXDE, XFCE, etc.\nWill you run out of RAM? That somewhat depends on your current usage. If you're right on the border of going into swap, yeah that possibility exists. Pair that with modern applications which put less emphasis on saving memory and you might have issues.\nI'd strongly consider an upgrade. 2x1GB of DDR400 is about £30 new (cheaper used) and easy to install. Then again, it's old, old, old.

Its still very low.\n12.04 is definitely a lot fast than 11.10, you will for sure notice the difference, running it in a vbox on my laptop with 764Mb or reserved RAM and its still usable. I cannot say the opposite from 11.10.\nYou should upgrade to 12.04 since its probably the last LTS that your computer will support, but if you have the chance get some more RAM as soon as you do so.

After enabling ufw and the Tiger security auditor, I see warnings saying:\nThe system accepts ICMP redirection messages\n\nWhat are ICMP redirection messages? Should they be disabled for security purposes? If so, what is the right way to do that using the ufw firewall?\n\nA: As per this article\n\nThere are certain cases where ICMP packets can be used to attack a network. Although this type of problem is not common today, there are situations where such problems do happen. This is the case with ICMP redirect, or ICMP Type 5 packet. ICMP redirects are used by routers to specify better routing paths out of one network, based on the host choice, so basically it affects the way packets are routed and destinations.\nThrough ICMP redirects, a host can find out which networks can be accessed from within the local network, and which are the routers to be used for each such network. The security problem comes from the fact that ICMP packets, including ICMP redirect, are extremely easy to fake and basically it would be rather easy for an attacker to forge ICMP redirect packets.\nThe atacker can then on basically alter your host's routing tables and diver traffic towards external hosts on a path of his/her choice; the new path is kept active by the router for 10 minutes. Due to this fact and the security risks involved in such scenario, it is still a recommended practice to disable ICMP redirect messages (ignore them) from all public interfaces.\n\nYou need to edit the file /etc/sysctl.conf\nand change\n###################################################################\n# Additional settings - these settings can improve the network\n# security of the host and prevent against some network attacks\n# including spoofing attacks and man in the middle attacks through\n# redirection.

Basicly I want the system to be fast. Root partition will be on SSD but I'm not sure what to do with /home. All data like /pictures /documents will be linked to HDD that will be in a removable caddy adapter in my thinkpad. From time to time I might need to remove it and plug in a CD-ROM. This way I guess some part of /home partition will have to be on SSD to make the system bootable. \nDoes anyone has some tips? It's also important that the Eclipse and Browsers (Opera,Firefox) will run fast. Is it also enough to just copy the partition to SSD to I will have to make a clean install?\n\nA: @Marty Fried Having the /home directory on the SSD is a bad idea because you want to avoid any unnecessary writes to the SSD which will add wear and tear to the SSD and shorten it's life.\nIt is best to have your /home folder on the HDD for things that are read/write heavy like documents, music, etc. and leave the SSD for the OS and Applications.\n\nA: I think I would put the /home directory on the SSD, but for most directories, especially the ones with large files, I would simply have a symbolic link to whatever contains the files.\nThis way, you can keep your settings, and the browser cache, etc on the SSD, but put the pictures, sounds, documents, etc on whatever disk you want, which can easily be changed by changing the links.\nTo do a backup, you can usually choose to follow symbolic links if desired.  I use sbackup (simple backup), and have separate profiles for major directories, and so each profile can choose whether to follow symbolic links or not.\nEdit:\nBy the way, a slightly more complex and harder to maintain, but possibly easier to use method (in that you don't have to pay attention to where programs save files by default) would be to mount the various documents or media folders or partitions in the /home subdirectories, so that programs that automatically want to save pictures in /home/Pictures will save them there, but they will get saved to the external location.\n\nA: As far as moving /home to a new partition (or drive), these instructions worked great for me!  Make sure you read them through first so you understand what you're doing before you start, and be careful to follow them exactly.  (Well, these sorts of things scare me; I'm afraid of making a typo that'll trash everything, but maybe that's just me.)  But I did it on two computers, and everything worked completely without errors.\nI'd post the whole thing here, but it's probably too long for that, and the people who wrote it deserve the credit for it.\n\nA: I'd suggest a /boot partition + a single bcache partition.  See How do I install and use flashcache/bcache to cache HDD to SSD? for installing or converting.\n", "Q: Ubuntu KVM Networking I have two VMs ( linux based VM ) running on a UBUNTU/QEMU KVM.

Which fixes may I apply?\nAnd, more in general, are Ubuntu default setting safe enough?\n\nA: If you are classifying your system as a high-value asset, I would say the defaults are not sufficient. I would recommend downloading and reading the CIS benchmarks for Debian and Apache and implementing the hardening recommendations. More specifically out of the box 'root' logins are permitted with SSH server which is truly stupid.

What do I need to do now?\n\nA: When reporting a bug you should (specially in beta) make sure that you are using the latest package versions available from the Ubuntu servers.\nSince 12.04 beta 2 release as a CD, packages have been already updated with fixes on the servers.\nThe CD images are not constantly updated (unless we are talking about a daily image, but these also can be missing some updates right after download). You need to update your system before successfully reporting a bug.\nDo that by opening a terminal and typing sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade.\nMake sure that the bug you where going to report is still present on the new packages, a more recent package update might have already fixed it.\n", "Q: kernel panic- not syncing: attempted to kill init!

I discovered that Ubuntu 11.04 is kinda slow when you have your home directory on NFS, even when NIS itself doesn't have any performence issues.\nStill it seems that many applications including Eclipse or Chrome are slow and I'm sure the cause is the NIS home directory.\nHow can I configure the system so it will behave decent.\nIn 99% of the time having home directory on NIS/NFS is not so important in my case so I'm looking for alternatives.\n\nA: I've deployed Ubuntu desktops on gigabit networks before, and despite it being fast, it's not as fast as a local disk, especially with applications that use lots of small little files, like say, your browser profile directory.\nWithout looking at your set up, I am reasonably certain that this is the case as it's always been a problem with NFS home directories and programs like this. One of the things you can do to mitigate this problem is to cache NFS on the PC you're on:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I cache NFS shares on a local disk?\nI've deployed something like this in the past and it helped, but having home directories on a network filesystem can lead to things like this.

To put links at the desktop does not make sense because of the many windows that I usually have open there is hardly ever a piece of the desktop looking through.\nHow do you - power users get keep most-used programs at reach (and I mean <= 2 clicks away)?\n\nA: Disclaimer: I am the original author of this indicator.\nThe Launcher List Indicator has been developed specifically for the purpose of having more than one set of icons on the Unity launcher and allow easy switching between them. \nHow does it work\nSuppose you want to have a launcher list for home use, another for work apps, another for something else.\n\nHere's the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start by adding all the icons you want to have in Home profile.\n\n*Once you're satisfied with that list, click Save current in the indicator, and you will have a popup dialog appear asking you to name the profile. Click OK, and you will see that profile to be added to the list.\n\n*Clear the launcher and repeat the process to add another profile. Very simple, very minimalistic , very easy to use.\nObtaining the Indicator\nThe simplest method is to download zip archive from the project's github page : \n https://github.com/SergKolo/launcher-list-indicator/archive/master.zip\n\nIf you have git installed, you can obtain latest version via command\ngit clone https://github.com/SergKolo/launcher-list-indicator.git \n\nIt is intended to be started as part of Startup Applications upon user login. \nIt is recommended to keep the app and its icon in the same folder\nTrivia:\n\n\n*\n\n*The indicator has been featured on OMG!Ubuntu and WebUpd8\n\nA: Check out a new application: Drawers \n\nhttp://www.iloveubuntu.net/how-easily-group-items-featuring-their-own-mini-dash-unity-launcher-drawers\nhttp://www.iloveubuntu.net/create-bundles-files-and-folders-unity-launcher-fancy-drawers-ppa-available\nyou can add the ppa by doing\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ian-berke/ppa-drawers \nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install drawers\n\nJust type Drawers into the Dash to get started. It'll create a drawer launcher in ~/.local/share/applications which you can place on the launcher/dock. Then drag and drop anything you want to it (documents, folders, applications, web-urls). Left-Clicking opens up a mini-dash with icons for each file, while right-clicking opens up a quicklist. Right clicking items in the open drawer allows you to edit their name or execution command. Left clicking launches them with their default application.\n\nA: the search feature in unity's dash is actually very powerful for launching applications\nit's easy to launch by pressing the super key (windows key on most keyboards) and then just begin typing the application's name\nas long as the application you want is the first result shown you can press enter and it will launch it\nby example i press super and then type \"ter\" and the first result is terminal, and there are some other results, but i press enter and terminal opens\nyou can also use the mouse to click the dash button to launch it (rather than the super key) and if your desired program comes up 2nd or 3rd (or anything but first) you can just click it to launch it, rather than the first result being launched when you press enter\ni personally find this handy and i only have maybe one or two icons pinned to the launcher itself and i open the rest from the dash's search so that my launcher will only really show me the applications that are currently running and not clutter with too many shortcuts\nit's also handy to use the super+w shortcut to show all active windows in an expose like display\n\nA: This is fixed in 12.04 by placing recent applications in the first part of the dash. Now, I only have applications locked to the launcher for the shortcuts since the dash actually does provide two-click access to all the frequent applications. Actually, in reality, I use search. That's faster for me than clicking on icons. \nHowever, what you refer to as \"Gnome 2\" isn't actually Gnome 2. It's a program called Gnome Panel. This is still available in Ubuntu 11.10 and 12.04, and can easily be used with Unity, for instance to have a bottom panel with lots of tiny icons. The drawer doesn't seem to be installed by default with Gnome Panel 3, however. But if you're going to use the panel for icons only anyway, that's probably not too important. \nYou'll find the gnome-panel package in the repositories; http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/gnome-panel\n\nA: Personally, I use @nyne's answer, but it sounds like you just want more launcher bars or a small launcher bar, possibly on the bottom. I recommend Docky, but many people also like Avant Window Navigator (AWN); though there are many more, those are the two \"main\" docks besides Unity's.\n\nA: I recommend sticking launchers of default applications like (Totem, LibreOffice Writer & Calc, Home folder, Firefox, Terminal, Software center...) And use the dash to launch your other applications, using the keyboard :\nSUPER+A (Keyboard shortcut for Unity Dashboard Applications Lens)\nif I decide to stick my frequently used apps in the launcher, then, 3 or 4 launchers would not be enough.\nYet, if you want to break the Unity experience and see yourself not using the dashboard anyway, use DOCKY as a secondary launcher:

With 11.10 the panel has changed. It appears on my main monitor only, along with the unity bar. When I have an application full screened the panel acts as the file menu, along with max, min, and close options.\nHowever I'm noticing when I have something full screened on my secondary monitor (where there is no panel) I have no way of un-fullscreening it. The panel on the main monitor do not show any options when that window is selected. This is okay for some apps like my web browser that has these buttons in it anyway, but I fullscreened Banshee and now it's stuck there...\nAny idea on how to un-fullscreen something in this situation?\n\nA: You might want to set up a keyboard shortcut to toggle maximization and/or fullscreen state.\nGo to Keyboard settings, click on the Shortcuts tab and chose a new shortcut for that in the Windows section.\n\n", "Q: Firefox doesn't display website text Firefox 11 doesn't show any text on some sites as Google and Youtube. \nAlso Lotus Symphony doesn't show many UI Labels.

If not (which i think is not the case, since common applications in general use common fonts, that come with the installation) either install it afterwards, or use another font as default in Firefox.\nAlso you might want to take a look under the Advanced-Button -> Default Character Encoding and make adjustments there! To me it seems, that your Encoding is wrong which is the problem if not mistaken!\nIf that still does not resolve your problem, please edit your post and add a screenshot and/or more information about your settings that you use in FF.\n\n", "Q: Launching Transmission/Dropbox behind a XBMC desktop session I am trying to get my HTPC set up just how I like it.\nI have Transmission scanning Dropbox for new torrents, and XBMC handling playback.\nI want to use XBMC as the Desktop session, to speed up launch.

Application that run on multiple desktop environment frequently don't avail themselves of the desktop themes. To change colors for applications written for Gnome's GTK you'll need to change gtkrc for applications not yet upgraded to GTK 3.0 and for the GTK 3.0 applications you'll need to edit setting.ini and gtk.css in the gtk-3.0 folder.

I run World of Warcraft on Windows 7 on one hard drive and Ubuntu on another. Until I can figure out how to get my wine version working at the same framerate as the Windows 7 version, I have to do large group content on my Windows installation.\nI have two copies of the installation. As of now, I link the directories inside of the primary folder in the wine installation (i.e. the Interface folder is a symlink pointing to the Windows 7 installation folder). The reason I link the subdirectories instead of the main directory is because, 2 directories deep (/wow/WTF/config.wtf), there is a configuration file that I keep different for both installations. While this is pretty much okay, it means I will run into issues when I get either installation patched as the root installation folder has executable files.\nIs there a way to build a symlink, but allow a file inside of the symlink to remain unlinked? Or, alternatively, is it safe to link *.exe files that I know will be altered / patched?\n\nA: If you install the xutils-dev package, the lndir command will create a bunch of symbolic and hard links, for the files and directories, respectively. You can go inside the linked directories and remove any of the file links you don't want. However, removing some may break the game.\nAs for whether the .exe files are safe to link, I don't see a problem with it, unless you need to maintain different patch sets of the game for each version. If the only difference you need is the config file, everything else can be links on the Ubuntu partition, to the Windows partition install, with just the config file being a real file. If you need to run lndir again to update links for new files, the existing files won't get overwritten.\n", "Q: Enable grub boot menu on new system I have installed Ubuntu 11.04 and I would like to see the boot menu when the system starts (by default it is hidden or the timeout=0)\n#\n# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE\n#\n# It is automatically generated by grub-mkconfig using templates\n# from /etc/grub.d and settings from /etc/default/grub\n#\n\n### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/00_header ###\nif [ -s $prefix/grubenv ]; then\n  set have_grubenv=true\n  load_env\nfi\nset default=\"0\"\nif [ \"${prev_saved_entry}\" ]; then\n  set saved_entry=\"${prev_saved_entry}\"\n  save_env saved_entry\n  set prev_saved_entry=\n  save_env prev_saved_entry\n  set boot_once=true\nfi\n\nfunction savedefault {\n  if [ -z \"${boot_once}\" ]; then\n    saved_entry=\"${chosen}\"\n    save_env saved_entry\n  fi\n}\n\nfunction recordfail {\n  set recordfail=1\n  if [ -n \"${have_grubenv}\" ]; then if [ -z \"${boot_once}\" ]; then save_env recordfail; fi; fi\n}\n\nfunction load_video {\n  insmod vbe\n  insmod vga\n  insmod video_bochs\n  insmod video_cirrus\n}\n\ninsmod part_msdos\ninsmod ext2\nset root='(hd0,msdos1)'\nsearch --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root 44f311b4-0b40-4d10-b004-78108539fc39\nif loadfont /usr/share/grub/unicode.pf2 ; then\n  set gfxmode=auto\n  load_video\n  insmod gfxterm\nfi\nterminal_output gfxterm\ninsmod part_msdos\ninsmod ext2\nset root='(hd0,msdos1)'\nsearch --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root 44f311b4-0b40-4d10-b004-78108539fc39\nset locale_dir=($root)/boot/grub/locale\nset lang=en_US\ninsmod gettext\nif [ \"${recordfail}\" = 1 ]; then\n  set timeout=-1\nelse\n  set timeout=10\nfi\n### END /etc/grub.d/00_header ###\n\n### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/05_debian_theme ###\ninsmod part_msdos\ninsmod ext2\nset root='(hd0,msdos1)'\nsearch --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root 44f311b4-0b40-4d10-b004-78108539fc39\ninsmod jpeg\nif background_image /boot/grub/boot.jpg; then\n  true\nelse\n  set menu_color_normal=white/black\n  set menu_color_highlight=black/light-gray\nfi\n### END /etc/grub.d/05_debian_theme ###\n\n### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/10_linux ###\nif [ ${recordfail} != 1 ]; then\n  if [ -e ${prefix}/gfxblacklist.txt ]; then\n    if hwmatch ${prefix}/gfxblacklist.txt 3; then\n      if [ ${match} = 0 ]; then\n        set linux_gfx_mode=keep\n      else\n        set linux_gfx_mode=text\n      fi\n    else\n      set linux_gfx_mode=text\n    fi\n  else\n    set linux_gfx_mode=keep\n  fi\nelse\n  set linux_gfx_mode=text\nfi\nexport linux_gfx_mode\nif [ \"$linux_gfx_mode\" != \"text\" ]; then load_video; fi\nmenuentry 'Ubuntu, with Linux 2.6.38-8-generic' --class ubuntu --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os {\n    recordfail\n    set gfxpayload=$linux_gfx_mode\n    insmod part_msdos\n    insmod ext2\n    set root='(hd0,msdos1)'\n    search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root 44f311b4-0b40-4d10-b004-78108539fc39\n    linux   /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.38-8-generic root=UUID=44f311b4-0b40-4d10-b004-78108539fc39 ro   quiet splash vt.handoff=7\n    initrd  /boot/initrd.img-2.6.38-8-generic\n}\nmenuentry 'Ubuntu, with Linux 2.6.38-8-generic (recovery mode)' --class ubuntu --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os {\n    recordfail\n    set gfxpayload=$linux_gfx_mode\n    insmod part_msdos\n    insmod ext2\n    set root='(hd0,msdos1)'\n    search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root 44f311b4-0b40-4d10-b004-78108539fc39\n    echo    'Loading Linux 2.6.38-8-generic ...'\n    linux   /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.38-8-generic root=UUID=44f311b4-0b40-4d10-b004-78108539fc39 ro single \n    echo    'Loading initial ramdisk ...'\n    initrd  /boot/initrd.img-2.6.38-8-generic\n}\n### END /etc/grub.d/10_linux ###\n\n### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/20_linux_xen ###\n### END /etc/grub.d/20_linux_xen ###\n\n### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/20_memtest86+ ###\nmenuentry \"Memory test (memtest86+)\" {\n    insmod part_msdos\n    insmod ext2\n    set root='(hd0,msdos1)'\n    search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root 44f311b4-0b40-4d10-b004-78108539fc39\n    linux16 /boot/memtest86+.bin\n}\nmenuentry \"Memory test (memtest86+, serial console 115200)\" {\n    insmod part_msdos\n    insmod ext2\n    set root='(hd0,msdos1)'\n    search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root 44f311b4-0b40-4d10-b004-78108539fc39\n    linux16 /boot/memtest86+.bin console=ttyS0,115200n8\n}\n### END /etc/grub.d/20_memtest86+ ###\n\n### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober ###\nif [ \"x${timeout}\" != \"x-1\" ]; then\n  if keystatus; then\n    if keystatus --shift; then\n      set timeout=-1\n    else\n      set timeout=0\n    fi\n  else\n    if sleep --interruptible 3 ; then\n      set timeout=0\n    fi\n  fi\nfi\n### END /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober ###\n\n### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/40_custom ###\n# This file provides an easy way to add custom menu entries.

I have seen that a lot of people are having this same issue. I am running a Lenovo V570 i5 4 core, 6 gigs of ram, and am running 11.10 Onieric Ocelot.\nOn my system monitor graph it shows CPU at 20%, when I open the monitor it shows core #1 at around 90%, the other cores fluctuate at or below 5-12% if even. Now this seems like a really terrible balance of power between the cores, especially with so much stress on one core only, when these things are designed to work with 4 cores and not at such high temps. My current readings say 64 degrees Celsius, this does not seem normal for any cpu, and I am seriously considering, working on my windows7 partition until I see a real solution to this issue or upgrading to 12.04 right away when it comes out... I have seen countless things saying it has something to do with the Kernel, the kernel on mine is the same as when I upgraded, I really do not like messing with it, as when I had 11.04, I did tinker with it due to the freeze issues I was having, and that just made worse issues. I like this version 11.10 and would like to keep it for a while, but without the fear that my core is going to fry! So any help would be much appreciated!

It can choose to balance the work in one of several ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*1 core at 80%, 3 cores at 0%.\n\n*2 cores at 40%, 2 cores at 0%\n\n*3 cores at 27%, 1 core at 0%\n\n*4 cores at 20%\n\n\nWhile the first option will result in the first core generating more heat than the other options, leaving the other 3 cores idle might represent an even larger power saving (you can switch to a very low power state if a core doesn't have to execute any instructions).\nSo the most \"balanced\" way of splitting the workload might in fact be the least power efficient (and hence the one that generates the most heat).\nAs @psusi said in a comment, 64°C is no where near hot enough to damage a modern CPU, so there isn't really any thermal regulation reasons to split the workload either.\nIf your fan is running constantly, it would be better to investigate why your system is doing so much work when it should be idle.  If you aren't doing anything on the system, then it is quite unusual for the system to be doing enough work to keep one core fully loaded.  If you can resolve that problem, then the fans won't need to run as hard.\n\nA: Well the problem did return the next day or two and as I originally suspected it was cairo dock, the cpu/ram monitor was causing the cpu to go under heavy load. As soon as I disabled it the load was almost down to 1% , but when I tested it by running different programs, there was hardly any air blowing out and no heat. When I periodically check it by opening the system monitor the only cpu readings I get are from running system monitor. Also another thing I noticed the ram was not being used up as much, the percentage before was like 80% +. Now it is a fraction of that! I think updating the BIOS was a good idea as that did help, but the real problem was that applet that I was running. I did check all the different applets and narrowed it down to that one. So for anyone else running Cairo Dock beware of that applet. \n", "Q: Thunderbird extension Messaganing Menu and Unity Launcher Integration stopped working After I restarted my laptop, the Thunderbird extension stopped working and I can't seem to get it working again.\nDoes anyone know how to fix this problem?\n\nA: Try the following extensions:\nhttps://launchpad.net/globalmenu-extension\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/messaging-menu-integration/\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/unity-launcher-integration/\n", "Q: Changing the sound setting from the command line I frequently switch between two sound settings: One directly connecting an analog headphone to the computer, and another is I connect an audio device to the HDMI audio output on the monitor.

The first partition is supposed to be just large enough to hold the ISO image I'm using, which in this case is 2.9GB. \nUsing fdisk I can make a partition, but no matter how large I make it (even filling the entire drive with the one partition), nautilus says I only have 2.6GB of free space, which is not enough for the ISO.\nI think the first time I tried this earlier today, I used fdisk and made the partition too small (2.5GB). I have formatted the USB drive multiple times since (and restarted my computer), but I cannot get the drive size to change.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: You don't format a drive, you format a partition, which is not necessarily the same thing.  If you want it to be blank, go in and delete all partitions on it first. Then you can start over and create two new partitions, and format each one.\nIf you have a bootable live CD (the normal installation CD), you can boot from it, and run gparted, which will allow you to visually delete and create partitions.  Or, I think the windows disk manager will also allow this.\nIt's been a long time since I've used fdisk, so I can't really help with the details of how to use it.  I use gparted now for most things.\n\nA: Partition sizes will be larger than the capacity of file systems stored in them.\nA partition denotes a raw block of storage device.\nA file system contains a certain amount of overhead which consumes some of this raw storage space. Therefore a file system placed in a partition which is just large enough for a given file will not have sufficient space to hold that file.\nYou'll need to repartition your drive. I recommend you place any file system that you want Windows to access in the first partition (Windows will only look in the first partition on removable flash media).\n", "Q: Ubuntu 11.04 64bits Keeps Randomly Freezing This has been a real headache for me since the number of freezes has increase from twice a week to about 1 or twice a day. The system just halts and nothing can be done but hitting the restart button. At the beginning I thought it was related to Flash since I was getting random freezes when playing full screen flash videos online. I also thought it could be the wireless pci card. But the system has freezed using browsing around GNOME.\nThe truth is, the freezes are really random and strange. I checked this thread Ubuntu keeps randomly freezing and try to ssh my computer using another one, but I could not ssh since it was really totally frozen. NumLock or CapsLock wasn't responding or blinking. \nSince I could not ssh I, also ignored this article https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Troubleshooting/Freeze\nAccording to my wife, the system has also halted under Win7 Pro 64bit but with less frequency. \nHere is my system configuration\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel Core i7 2600k \n\n*ASRock Z68 Extreme3 gen3 Motherboard \n\n*Crucial M4 128GB CT128M4SSD2 SSD \n\n*WD Caviar Green WD10EADS 1TB SATA II \n\n*G.SKILL Ripjaws X Series 8GB (2 x 4GB) DDR2 \n\n*OCZ ModXStream 600W Power Supply\n\n*Rosewill RNX-N300X PCI Wireless Adapter \n\n*No external Graphics Card\n\n\nI remove the Wireless card and used Ethernet to see if the problem was the that, but I got a freeze after doing that.\nI also ran memtest86 and everything was ok.\nThe only other thing I might suspect of is the SSD. I will try to clone the SSD to a HDD to see if that solve the problem.\nAt this point I am stuck with the freezes.\nDo anyone have a clue of why this is happening and how can i solve this? \nEDIT:\nI clone my SSD to a HDD and my system hasn't freeze since then on Ubuntu or Win7, though it is significantly slower than before, as expected, specially in Windows. \nWhat could possible be wrong with my SSD?::: Crucial M4 128GB CT128M4SSD2 SSD \n\nA: I fixed the problem by accident. The problems was actually the SDD. For some reasons, the Drive doesn't perform well when no enough space is left at the end of the last partition for \"Garbage Collection.\" I resized my last partition and left about 1GB left at the end of the drive. I have never got a freeze again. \nSolution:\nLeave at least 1GB free space at the end of the last partition in your Crucial M4 drive.\nIt works for me.\n", "Q: Why does nova need a public interface? I've read some explanations about nova-network and how to configure it like this one from wiki:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://wiki.openstack.org/UnderstandingFlatNetworking\nI'm confusing about a detail. If every traffic from the instances must go through nova controller node, then why we still need the public interface for nova-compute node? Is it necessary?\nWhat happen when a request from outside to an instance. For example I have a controller node and a nova-compute node. In nova-compute node I run an instance with a Wordpress website. Then someone connect to the public IP of this instance. So the request go directly from router to the nova-compute node or from router to controller node then nova-compute node?\n\nA: In the case of nova-network running on the controller node, instances use that node as its gateway to  the outside world.  The public interface is configured on compute nodes and floating (public) IPs are configured directly on the compute nodes.  So, instance bound public traffic would go to an public interface on the compute node rather than the controller.\nA better networking model to use is FlatDHCP + multi_host.   See this blog post that describes it in detail and describes why its a better choice.\nTo summarize here: nova-network runs on every compute host. The physical flat_interface (specified in config, usually eth1) gets a bridge built upon it which is assigned an IP address on the private instance network.  Using this bridge, nova-network serves DHCP, DNS and a gateway to all instances hosted on that compute node.  The physical flat_interface (eth1) should be linked to a switch connecting the flat_interface's of other compute nodes.  This enables inter-instance traffic on the internal, private network (eg, 10.0.0.0/24).\nEach compute node also has a public_interface specified in config (eth0 by default).  This is expected to be connected to the public facing network, say 192.168.25.0/24.  As a user, you can allocate an address and associate it to a running instance. The addresses are allocated from a pool that you configure when you initially setup nova's networking.

When you have a lot of memory and only small process memory footprint, it is good that your RAM is used as disk cache as it improves system responsiveness. Your machine doesn't have to read the disk every time over and over again. On most machines (depending on RAM size) after a while nearly the whole memory will be in use, either for processes or as disk cache.\n\n\n*\n\n*Used (first line) is process memory + buffers + cached\n\n*Free (first line) is readily available RAM\n\n*Swap is the size of your swap space\n\n*Used (second line) is amount of swap space in use\n\n*Free (second line) is free swap space\n\n\nSwap space is virtual memory, memory on disk rather than RAM.

I'm running the 12.04 beta, and I purchased a couple of albums from the Ubuntu One Music Store (running Rhythmbox).\nEight songs on each album downloaded and were synced, but there are a total of eight more songs that haven't downloaded.

Until that happens, there is nothing for the Ubuntu One client to copy to your local system (that is why u1sdtool says it is idle).

Are startup and shutdown the correct events ? \nAlso my script create a new thread. I'm assuming I also need to add fork daemon to my conf file?\nThanks. \n\nA: startup is the event that upstart emits itself at the very beginning of its execution. For most services, this is far too early. Things you might not have at this time:\n\n\n*\n\n*networking to lookup host names in DNS or avahi (you might not have this anyway, if its a mobile system you can never count on this, but for servers, things are different)\n\n*a filesystem to writeto (it is not writable until later after it has been checked)\n\n*/usr to read python from! (sometimes /usr is on a separate partition).\n\n\nshutdown is actually not an event at all, though thats actually been discussed as one to use for future versions.\nRight now, your best bet is to stick to the old unix way and use runlevels to control when to start and stop.\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [^2345]\n\nRun levels are the old unix way of identifying what state the system is in. [2345] is just a set of all the runlevels that are used for \"multiple user\" mode, which even on a laptop means normal working system. If you use this, you can count on things like the filesystem, and any static networking to be up. 99% of all upstart jobs should use these two start/stop conditions.\nWith the stop on, if the system enters any runlevel that is not 2,3,4, or 5, upstart will stop the service. The runlevel 0 is for halt, and 1 is for \"system maintenance mode\". 6 is for rebot.\nEventually we will add better names for these abstractions, but these will always work.\nAlso, you do not need script or end script there. The exec keyword will simply exec your program directly. This will shave a few milliseconds of time because you won't have to execute /bin/sh and parse the exec ... line, since upstart will have already parsed the job file.\n", "Q: node-xmpp-bosh error on Ubuntu 11.10 I am newbie in Linux word.

It was a clean install, my laptop had no other OS present in it, not even DOS.\nWhile installing, it asked for partitioning. Out of the 320GB of free space I created a new partition of 20 GB and installed Ubuntu in it. The rest of the 300GB is still available as free space.\nSoon I realized that I can't use the 300GB of space and that only 20GB is available to me for use.\nCan anyone tell me how I can take away some free space away from the 300GB and add that to my 20GB partition?\nI have installed the Gparted Partition editor from the Ubuntu Software Center but have no idea how to go ahead with it.\nThanks :)\n\nA: Start your laptop with Ubuntu Live CD and run Gparted from there. Then select your 20 GB partition, right click on it and click resize. Resize it to use all the free space and click apply. Reboot your system after removing the CD and thats it.\n\nA: Your best using a live cd as you can't resize a mounted partition. gparted have a live CD here,  download and burn it to cd, boot from it then select partion edittor you should then see a visual layout of your hard disk I think if you right click on your 20gb partition you should get the object to expand it.\nThere is a good video tut here\n\nA: You could use Gparted from the Live CD/USB and expand the 20GB Ubuntu partition. You have to do it from CD/USB. Trying to modify a system partition from from within the installation won't work because the partition won't be editable. Gparted is preinstalled on all Ubuntu CDs.\nAnother option is reinstall, and let Ubuntu have all of the space. Make a backup first, in case there is stuff to backup.\n\nA: 20GB if fine for Ubuntu. You could create another partition in the remaining space and move all your data there. The idea is to separate data from operating system. I like to encrypt the data partition. Use Ubuntu's disk utility -- it's a great tool. Link your data (docs,pics etc) to your home directory and your done.\n", "Q: run .profile function as cron job In the .profile file of the root user I have defined a function, e.g.\nfunction printDate() {\n  date\n}\n\nI want to run this function every minute and append the output to cron.log. I tried adding the following crontab entry:\n* * * * * printDate > $HOME/cron.log 2>&1\n\nBut it doesn't work. The cron.log file gets created, but it's empty. I guess this is because the .profile isn't read by cron, so any functions/aliases defined therein are unavailable to it. So I tried changing the crontab entry to:\n* * * * * source $HOME/.profile;printDate >> $HOME/cron.log 2>&1\n\nBut this doesn't work either. It seems cron still doesn't have access to the printDate function because I see the following in cron.log\n/bin/sh: printDate: not found\n\n\nA: Just wrap it in another bash script.  Your file names will be different, but I have:\ntest(.profile)\n#!/bin/bash\nfunction printDate() {\n  date\n}\n\nwrap(a new script you can put wherever, just change the url)\n#!/bin/bash\ncd ~/\nsource ./test\nprintDate > ./date.log\n\nwhen run from a /bin/sh\n$ ls\ntest  wrap\n$ ./wrap\n$ cat date.log\nWed Apr 11 11:49:39 EDT 2012\n$ \n\nNow just make sure your paths/environment are right\nThe crontab lines I just tested were:\nSHELL=/bin/sh\nHOME=/root\n* * * * * $HOME/wrap >/dev/null 2>&1\n\n", "Q: Installing onto a laptop after uninstalled with easybcd I had Ubuntu on my laptop a few days ago but a professional installed it for me. Soon after I got it from the guy I messed it up. I uninstalled Ubuntu with easybcd and now I'm scared it will complicate things.\nDoes it?\nI'm sure I downloaded Ubuntu to disk on this site:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/download\nAnd got this file:\nubuntu-11.10-server-amd64 \nwhich I burned to disk. \nWhen I put the cd in my laptop it shows me a wubi.exe file.\nWhen I reboot with the cd it boots straight to windows 7.\nWhat's wrong? Teach me\n\nA: *\n\n*You have downloaded the Server edition of Ubuntu\n\n\nThis does not come with a desktop environment and is not recommended unless you want to set up an application server. The installation process for the server edition is less user-friendly, and once installed it will boot to a plain text login with no GUI.\nYou are more likely to want the Desktop edition, and I suggest you download either the 11.10 or 12.04 image of this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Your laptop is configured to boot from the hard disk by default\n\n\nYou will need to either enter setup to reconfigure your BIOS to boot devices in a different order, or strike a particular key during POST. The messages that appear on screen will often inform you which key you need to push. F9, F10 and F2 are commonly used.\nwubi.exe is used to install Ubuntu to what's called a \"loopback file\" - the file system is written to a file contained within your Windows partition. This is convenient for people who don't want to repartition your disk, but is probably not the best solution for you.\nSince you have already had Ubuntu installed on your laptop, reinstalling over this pre-existing partition is probably your best bet. If you manage to boot the standard Desktop LiveCD, it should be reasonably clear which partition contains your current (broken) Ubuntu install.\n", "Q: Web design software \nPossible Duplicate:\nBasic Web Development IDE/Editor like Dreamweaver? \n\nwhat software do you use, or you recommend me using for designing web pages? I don't mean WYSIWYG software, but more like adobe photoshop. I'm aware of gimp, but i don't like the separate windows thingie ... I looked into inkscape and it seems promising but cant find any good tutorials(for webdesign).\nSo what's your opinion on this topic?\n\nA: I use Netbeans IDE as the Php Editor. Because of It's built-in php-manual and variable, function assist. It also provides suggestions (can be closed) for like \"alt\" attribute of \"img\" in html. \nIt can also be used as FTP engine to upload project to server.\n\nGimp is really good. But if you trying to compare Gimp with Inkscape; that is not a good idea. \nGimp is a photo editor, and is pixel based. Inscape is vector based, and used to create logos etc, which are resizable. (Sure using both in one project, not selecting one)\nBoth are really useful and enough to create a professional looking web applications.\nBy the way, you can try learning Illustrator and doing the same for inkscape.\n\nA: Eclipse is better one, it's support (HTML - CSS - PHP - Javascript), that's mean all you need to code your pages (eclipse helios). here to download it:\nhttp://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/helios/sr2\nFor Design i recommend you to use gimp it's a good if you have knowledge in photoshop\n\nA: Please check out Bluegriffon.

It's kind of like the clear command used in Linux, but it cleans the screen permanently.\nIf you use the clear command, it just scroll down, so that you don't see the command you where working on.\nI like both a lot, but my question is, how do i get a cls like command, that clears the screen, and can't browse up, to see the command you where working on?\n\nA: In your current terminal window, just type the following:\nprintf \"\\033c\"\n\n\nA: If the aim is to avoid only casual rediscovery of command history, reset may be a viable choice. \nHowever, bear in mind that by default, the shell logs your command history to a file as well - this is also eminently discoverable. If you want to prevent other persons from browsing your command history, you should also clean that out.\nhistory -c # clear your history \n\nA: You can use reset. This resets the whole terminal, so that may be a bit overkill though.\nNote on Konsole:\n@Mechanical snail noticed \"in Konsole 4.8.5, the old text is still there if you scroll up\".\n@gertvdijk explained that it is \"a feature. There's Ctrl+Shift+K for Konsole (reset and clear scrollback).\" \n\nA: Add this line to ~/.bashrc (i.e., the file called .bashrc, located in your home folder -- you can see it in Nautilus by pressing Ctrl+H):\nalias cls='printf \"\\033c\"'\n\nNow the cls command will clear the screen like in Windows. It will put you back to the top of a Terminal window, with no text shown above it. (It will not delete the shell's command history.)\nThis works because:\n\n\n*\n\n*.bashrc runs every time a bash shell starts up.\n\n*The alias command defines the cls command to run the command quoted on the right-hand side.\n\n*printf command writes characters to the terminal. It accepts escape codes. The octal 033 is the character used to signal the beginning of a terminal control code. The control code c tells the terminal to clear itself.\n\n*So, with this modification to .bashrc. running cls sends the necessary data to the terminal to tell it to clear itself.\n\n\nA: cls works by clearing the buffer, which is fixed 25 or 50 lines in case of DOS and Windows, respectively. You can achieve something like this by writing so many lines in the buffer that it overflows (2000 is a typical value), but then reset is also a viable option as @lgarzo said.\n", "Q: changing permissions of `nyccrash.txt': Operation not permitted I have an assignment to write PHP code, and upload the data to our school student's account. To make sure my script is working, I need to change the permissions on the files.\nI am not a root because I am a student. How can I fix that problem?\nchown: changing permissions of `nyccrash.txt': Operation not permitted\n\nThose files has permission labeled as apache\nThe owner and user are apache, according to ls -ls\nThanks.\n\nA: You should not be able to fix this yourself and need help from the admin.\nRenaming or copying the file should not be possible since your username is more than likely to be part of others (and not part of user or group).  \nEither your user has to be in the same group as the apache user or you need more permissions on only that file or you need to be a sudoer.\n", "Q: Is there an open source alternative to \"Adobe Digital Editions\"? For the moment I run Adobe Digital Editions under Wine to download ebooks burdened with ditigal restriction management. I only use it to open .acsm files supplied by ebook-shops, which contain authentication information required to download the actual DRM'ed ebook files, which I then transfer to my reader-device with calibre. My question is, if there exist open source alternatives to Adobe Digital Editions. They don't need much functionality. I just want to put the .acsm-file in and get the .epub out (no, I don't want to remove the drm, that'd be illegal afaik).\n\nA: .acsm can only be used with Adobe Digital Editions and stands for Adobe Content Server Manager.\nFor more information about Adobe Digital Editions please see http://www.adobe.com/products/digitaleditions/faq/\n\nSide note (may not be generally applicable to Digital Editions users): Stated in the agreement (may be of concern in making a program to access .acsm ) for Adobe Content Server section 11.1 you agree not to: \n\n(d) obtain or attempt to obtain any materials or Information through\n  any means not intentionally made available through the Services;  \n\n Interpret this as you will, I will not give you legal advice.\n\nA: You can also use OverDrive which is a fairly reasonable ebook reader.  You need to put in your Adobe ID to register it, and after that, it will open .acsm files and download the relevant ePub for you.\n", "Q: How to remove the title bar of a window in js/lg/extension under gnome-shell? I know that title bar of windows can be removed in {g,d}conf-editor or by modifying the metacity theme. However, I want to have some rather complex rules for showing title bars or not (like hide the title bar if the window is tiled) and an extension is the only way I can think of to do this. MetaWindow.get_frame doesn't seem to be accessible in js, is there a way to control the decoration of windows in a gnome-shell extension?\nTHX.\n\nA: You need to use a tool like devilspie which will allow you to match windows and perform actions on them, such as modifying the hints on the window to remove the display of the title bar. You could also instead write a program or script using the libwnck library's API to match windows and apply such changes to them.\n", "Q: Intel 865G chipset drivers Is it important to install chipset drivers on Ubuntu? I'm not using onboard graphics but in windows it is important I think, I got linux drivers for my chipset and never tried to install them (Hard way no .deb files, only manual installation) i'm not talking about installing VGA drivers but Lan and other motherboard drivers,except Audio\n\nA: Chipset support and other drivers are part of the Linux kernel - you do not need to install a separate driver package for the majority of hardware. Intel hardware in particular is well supported. If your hardware works, you already have the best available support for your distribution (short of messing about with custom kernels).\n\nA: lspci | grep VGA\n\ndo that in your terminal and it will show you what kind of drivers needed .  \nfor more information on drivers you can use this link as a reference . \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto\n", "Q: How to install Lexmark S308 printer? I have a multi function lexmark printer with a instalation cd but can get the .exe to run, Im new to the ubuntu world so i dont know how to install third party software yet.

Just hook it up and go to Printing (search it up in the Dash, should be under Settings). Hit the big plus, and your printer should show up on the list of devices on the window then brought up.\n\nA: Take a look at the link below.

I press Ctrl+D to end standard input, but it only works if I'm on a fresh line.  And that requires me to push Enter first, which puts an unwanted new line character in there.

Take rev for example, which reverses each input line.\nNormally, you press Enter after input, and it reverses that line:\n$ rev\nasdf\nfdsa\n\nIf you do not want to append a newline to your input, just press Ctrl-D twice after you input asdf, it will be reversed in the same line:\n$ rev\nasdffdsa\n\nDifferent programs handle this differently; for example bc does not behave like above. \n", "Q: GMA 6300 in asus eeepc x101ch stuck at 800x600 I've read that this card is unsupported at the moment and i can wait with ubuntu 2D. \nWhat i can't stand is working in 800x600 resolution.

After I installed this packet, I can manually obtain system informations with typing: #landscape-sysinfo \n\nA: What is output at login-time is generally controlled on *nix boxen (and, by extension, Ubuntu boxen) by the /etc/issue (controls what gets shown before the login: prompt) and /etc/motd (gets printed upon successful login) files.  On Ubuntu, the former is a single file the latter is autogenerated from /etc/motd.tail.

I reach 2.2 GHz when needed. But my following problem remains.\nI was checking my CPU clocking because I experienced poor performances when reading 720p video files on Ubuntu with VLC or mplayer when on battery (and I believe VLC by default only uses CPU, not GPU to decode), whereas I haven't got such problems with VLC on Windows (which made me think it wasn't coming from a BIOS option, plus every option in the BIOS regarding the CPU is turned ON).\n\nA: Yes, almost all Intel CPUs made in the last decade or so can vary their clock speeds according to the load, and the default \"frequency scaling governor\" is the \"on demand\" governor, which keeps the CPUs at minimum speed until they are needed, at which point it immediately switches them to maximum frequency.\nYou can keep track of the changing frequencies by using the following command: watch -p -n1 'cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep -i \"hz\"'. That will report the current CPU frequencies every second. Try running that in a terminal and then starting up a video in VLC while watching how the frequencies change. You can see if the poor performance correlates with the CPUs being downclocked inappropriately, but I doubt that is the real problem.\n", "Q: Why doesn't the PrintScreen dialog show up in Gnome? I'm using gnome-shell on Ubuntu 12.04. When I hit PrtSc to take a screenshot, it works, but it automatically saves the screenshot in my Pictures folder. There's no dialogue asking where to save. It does show the dialogue box under unity though.\n\nA: I'm late to the party, but I just tripped over this and want to offer a slightly different answer.\nBasically, in the latest Gnome 3 / Gnome Shell then they are no-longer using Gnome Screenshot. That means any changes to Gnome-Screenshot's default settings (like default save location) won't affect anything.\nInstead, you need to go to your Keyboard settings, disable the \"Save a screenshot […] to Pictures\" shortcuts and add your own custom shortcuts that call gnome-screenshot with no args (auto-save to its gsettings-defined location), -a (save area), -w (save current window) or -i (if you want the options dialog back). You can obviously mix-and-match some settings, or add more from man gnome-screenshot.\n\nA: try using Shutter instead, its the best screen capture tool (as it site says :)\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:shutter/ppa    \nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install shutter\n\napp site: http://shutter-project.org/\nTo configure Shutter as the default tool to take screenshots with when you press PrtSc or Alt+PrtSc, here’s what you need to do:\ngnome:\n1 Go to Edit ▸ Preferences in Shutter\n 2   In the Keyboard tab, enable both the “Capture” and “Capture with selection” checkboxes:\n  3  That’s it! Now the usual PrtSc and Alt+PrtSc keybindings will use Shutter to take the screenshots.\n\nA: Assuming that I have read this bug-report correctly...\nThis is by design. No really!\nComments #37 onwards talk about this.\nThe current unity patches state:\n\non Unity sessions display a confirmation dialog after taking\n  screenshots with the keybindings, the auto saving behaviour is\n  confusing our users\n\nThe thread carries on:\n\nbut your fix doesn’t help when I don’t use Unity. Why did you think\n  this only applies to Unity users?\n\nWith the reply:\n\nbecause we keep being asked by GNOME upstream and GNOME user to let\n  their desktop alone and ship it as designed so that's what we try to\n  do, we stick to upstream behaviour for GNOME environments and take\n  design decision for Unity\n\nSo there you have it.  The Gnome-Developers are insistent that their desktop environment should behave this way.  Its an upstream issue.  The Canonical Developers are respecting this decision and hence the \"divergence\" - Unity users have the Save as dialog whilst gnome-shell users have the by-design no dialog functionality.\nThus if you are using gnome-shell/gnome-classic, all the screenshots are saved in your home pictures folder ~/Pictures\nNote: You can override the screenshot location with gsettings (command-line) or dconf-editor (GUI): \n\n\n*\n\n*set the org.gnome.gnome-screenshot auto-save-directory to file:///home/yourusername/wherever/you/want\n\nA: Hey guys this might help,\nI was poking around in the gnome menu as I noticed that with the new version of shutter enabling the hot key was not as simple and found that the iBus daemon wasn't started on my machine while in 'gnome fallback'.

Whenever I do sudo apt-get remove eog though, I'm notified that doing this will also remove ubuntu-desktop. But I want to keep using Unity 2D.\nHow can I remove eog while keeping the Unity-2D session? \n\nA: I believe ubuntu-desktop is a \"metapackage\" aka a package of packages. MetaPackages.\nThus when you un-install a package in that metapackage it un-installs the metapackage, but not the other packages in the metapackage, so removing eog and letting it un-install ubuntu-desktop should not harm Unity 2D, they made the ubuntu-desktop metapackage for ease of installing many programs and upgrading them all in one go. what-are-the-downsides-of-removing-ubuntu-desktop-metapackage\nEdit: Is it safe to remove ubuntu-desktop package? Seems distributions will still upgrade, because it forces install of desktop metapackage, and will still upgrade.\n\nA: This answer doesn't remove eog, but it does make setting all pictures to open with gPicView easier.\n\n\n*\n\n*Type Alt+F2 to get the run dialog, and then type gksudo gedit /usr/share/applications/defaults.list.

I am new and do not, of course, know a lot about installing and maintaining an Ubuntu release.\nOne of the \"tricks\" I have learned to use is sudo apt-get update followed by sudo apt-get upgrade to download and install updates for the installed software.\nI recently installed beta 2 of Ubuntu 12.04 (precise pangolin ?) to a test disk/partition just to see what it was like. After the install I updated the software using the commands I listed above because, well, that is what I always do.\nWas this a mistake? Are the alpha & beta releases of Ubuntu updated in a different way?\nI recently saw reference to the dist-upgrade command for apt-get and decided I would try using that to update 12.04. A lot of programs were upgraded, including the kernel so I'm wondering if using just sudo apt-get upgrade was the wrong way to go for a release which is still under development.\n\nA: Think of apt-get upgrade as a safe upgrade while testing candidate releases. You should use it normally for (mostly) daily upgrade process to keep your packages up to date without* breaking your system. The upgrade option is used only to update the packages already installed on your machine to a newer version.\napt-get dist-upgrade will not only upgrade all of the currently installed packages on your system but also handle the dependency changes for new versions of packages. It intelligently** will remove obsolete packages from your system and install any further necessary. During beta use this option with caution. Normally this function needed for upgrading from one distribution release to another.\n* Without breaking is a big statement, remember, this is alphas or betas we are talking about.\n** Intelligently is definition but because all is beta extra caution should be taken.\nPrecautions to take while upgrading a pre-release\n\n\n*\n\n*Upgrade only using the terminal, at least you will know exactly what is going to happen before pressing Y and letting apt do changes to your system.\n\n*When running a apt-get dist-upgrade is needed (new kernel, major change on system packages, etc) make sure that you first run apt-get dist-upgrade -s to simulate and please read all the changes the upgrade will apply. If you see any weird changes (_I remember killing my system after a dist-upgrade asked me to remove some necessary system packages and the Ubuntu Software Center while 12.04 was in alpha 1) abort it and update you packages again in a few days.\n\n*Do not use the update manager while updating a pre-release. Make sure that you can read everything that is going to happen to your system before pressing Y.\n\n*Don't be too eager to update! Don't do it out of speed, this is a sensible process during a pre-release. Use caution and some patience when testing it.\n\n\nWhen should you use a upgrade compared with a dist-upgrade?\nUse a dist-upgrade when you know the pre-release just went from alpha to beta or the next scheduled step or in the \"Wont update these packages\" list during a apt-get upgrade there are new kernels and other major packages, be extra cautious of the list of packages that will be removed. If there is anything there that you are not sure, or that you think it might break your system abort it after the simulation and get your self informed via the forums or on the IRC channels before applying the changes.\n\nIf you need further help during the update period or just a quick chat to point you in the right direction during an pre-release system read the informationins this post\n\n\n*\n\n*There's an issue with an Alpha/Beta Release of Ubuntu, what should I do?\nDon't be hasty and be prepared all times, a backup or 2 are never too much to ask when testing.\n\nA: Normally you just need to open a terminal and update with\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\n\nA: No, this was not a mistake.  upgrade will refuse to add or remove packages, and sometimes the new version of a package requires new packages to be installed, or old ones to be removed.  When that happens, you will need to use dist-upgrade instead.  If dist-upgrade wants to remove a bunch of packages, you may want to say no and try again the next day as the package may simply be in a transition where it can't be correctly installed at the moment.\n\nA: No they are updated in same way.\nThough there is an update manager to do this graphically.\nJust tap Super key to bring up unity search interface and type \"update\". Then click on \"Update Manager. Then do a check, it will list all updates (basically apt-get update), if any update available you can upgrade (apt-get upgrade)\n", "Q: How to use ZTE AX326 Modem on Ubuntu 10.10?

Many report that un-installing pulseaudio will solve the problem, but for some that is not really an acceptable answer (like me, because pulse is useful for many apps).\nSo to solve this we need to make a script,\n1- Make a new empty doccument in a text editor like gedit or mousepad,\n2- Paste this code in the doccument, Soruce of code:2\n#!/bin/bash\n#### Create ~/.pulse/mute if not exists\nls ~/.pulse/mute &> /dev/null\nif [[ $? != 0 ]]\nthen\n    echo \"false\" > ~/.pulse/mute\nfi\n\n####Create ~/.pulse/volume if not exists\nls ~/.pulse/volume &> /dev/null\nif [[ $? != 0 ]]\nthen\n    echo \"65536\" > ~/.pulse/volume\nfi\n\nCURVOL=`cat ~/.pulse/volume`     #Reads in the current volume\nMUTE=`cat ~/.pulse/mute`          #Reads mute state\n\nif [[ $1 == \"increase\" ]]\nthen\n    CURVOL=$(($CURVOL + 3277)) #3277 is 5% of the total volume, you can change this to suit your needs.\n    if [[ $CURVOL -ge 65536 ]]\n    then\n        CURVOL=65536        \n    fi\nelif [[ $1 == \"decrease\" ]]\nthen\n    CURVOL=$(($CURVOL - 3277))\n    if [[ $CURVOL -le 0 ]]\n    then\n        CURVOL=0        \n    fi\nelif [[ $1 == \"mute\" ]]\nthen\n    if [[ $MUTE == \"false\" ]]\n    then\n        pactl set-sink-mute 0 1\n        echo \"true\" > ~/.pulse/mute\n    exit    \n    else\n        pactl set-sink-mute 0 0\n        echo \"false\" > ~/.pulse/mute    \n    exit\n    fi\nfi\n\npactl set-sink-volume 0 $CURVOL\necho $CURVOL > ~/.pulse/volume # Write the new volume to disk to be read the next time the script is run.\n\n3- Name the file \"volume\" (no extension needed) put it somewhere you can find and won't delete it like your home folder\n4- Make the file executable by Right-clicking on the file, go to  Properties, then the Permissions tab, and use the check box to mark it executable, this will allow the script to be run. mark-file-as-executible-gui\n5- Next we need to link the commands to the keyboard, the commands for the code are increase, decrease, and mute.\nSo go to the keyboard settings - how-do-i-change-my-keyboard-shortcuts-in-xubuntu,  In the keyboard shortcuts area, click add, then open, Open the \"volume\" file we created, then add the command for the code after volume, reading volume increase, or volume mute ect. but with the location of where the code file is before it like \"/home/username/volume mute\"\nThen assign it to the keyboard by pressing the key it, or if the key is already used,\n~ Most likely the case ~ find them and replace the command.\nThe key shortcuts are likely called XF86AudioRaiseVolume, XF86AudioLowerVolume, XF86AudioMute.  Since only the mute is broken concentrate your efforts on changing that out first.\nBug: 1\n\nA: Run this command:\namixer -D pulse set Master 1+ unmute\n\n\nA: See:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/xfce4-volumed/+bug/883485/comments/3\nxfce4-mixer has a setting for active-card, that must be set to Pulseaudio, otherwise it will be using Alsa.\n\nA: Worked for me on 12.10:\n    #!/bin/sh\n    amixer -c 0 sset Master,0 mute\n    sleep 5\n    amixer -D pulse set Master 1+ unmute\n\n\nA: For KDE and kmix users, if you use this script you will still have the visual feedback working:\n#! /bin/bash\n\nDBUS=qdbus 2> /dev/null\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n  volup)\n        pactl set-sink-mute alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo 0\n        ${DBUS} org.kde.kmix /kmix/KMixWindow/actions/increase_volume com.trolltech.Qt.QAction.trigger\n        ;;\n  voldn)\n        pactl set-sink-mute alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo 0\n        ${DBUS} org.kde.kmix /kmix/KMixWindow/actions/decrease_volume com.trolltech.Qt.QAction.trigger\n        ;;\n  mute)\n        ${DBUS} org.kde.kmix /kmix/KMixWindow/actions/mute com.trolltech.Qt.QAction.trigger\n        pactl set-sink-mute alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo $(${DBUS} org.kde.kmix /Mixers/0/Master_0 org.kde.KMix.Control.mute | sed 's/false/0/g;s/true/1/g')\n        ;;\n  *)\n    echo \"Usage: mixctl <volup|voldn|mute>\" >&2\n    exit 1\n    ;;\nesac\n\nexit 0\n\nUsage:\n1) Save it as ~/bin/mixctl\n2) Unmap the default kmix keyboard shortcuts for Volume Up/Volume Down and Mute\n3) Create three new custom keyboard shortcuts named 'Volume Up', 'Volume Down' and 'Mute' --> shortcut type: command\n--> as the commands use ~/bin/mixctl volup, ~/bin/mixctl voldn and ~/bin/mixctl mute respectively\n\nA: I had the same problem on multiple Xubuntu 12.04 machines which were upgraded to XFCE 4.10.\nHere is a very quick way solve this problem from the command line (or with a bash script).\nUnlike previous solutions which offer stop-gap scripts, this solution fully restores the function of the mute/unmute button.\nSimply issue the following two commands once, to resolve the problem once and for all:\n$ xfconf-query --channel xfce4-mixer --property /active-card --set PlaybackInternalAudioAnalogStereoPulseAudioMixer --reset\n$ xfconf-query --create --channel xfce4-keyboard-shortcuts --property /commands/custom/XF86AudioMute --type string --set 'amixer -D pulse set Master 1+ toggle'\n\n\nA: I found a simple solution that works well for me in this forum.

I've searched and found solutions related to my problem but none that have so far directly worked.\nAfter figuring out how to free up space to make a partition on my computer in order to install Ubuntu 11.10 side-by-side with Windows and installing it, and rebooting my computer, I found myself staring at the Ubuntu login. But it never asked me whether I wanted to boot Windows 7 or Ubuntu, and every time I restart the computer it takes me straight to the Ubuntu login.\nMy computer is an eMachine EL1333G-01w. Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit was pre-installed originally, and the entire hard drive was basically dedicated as \"eMachines\" (which made it really annoying installing Ubuntu since they stole the whole hard drive as a Windows partition, which I figured how to cut down).\nAfter a little (frustrating) search I discovered something called the bootloader and that Ubuntu automatically uses GRUB to let you choose which OS to use. The problem is, GRUB doesn't seem to be working, or it doesn't seem to have been installed at all. I've looked through the Software Center and downloaded what I believed to be GRUB but that didn't work. \nWhen I turn on the computer, the first thing I see is the \"e\" symbol with two options on the bottom: boot options and Setup Menu, which prompts me to believe the bootloader wasn't properly implemented or installed. Then the screen displays \"Input Display Out of Range\" for a few seconds, and then the Ubuntu login pops up. I found something called boot-repair but the Ubuntu wouldn't run it whether as a file or off a CD I burned. Entering \"grub\" into the terminal tells me it's not installed, and after following directions to install it and rebooting, the same thing occurs. Typing \"grub\" gets me \"Probing Devices to guess BIOS drives. This may take a long time.\", so I've been waiting for a while, with nothing happening.\nMost problems I see involve people unable to boot into Windows from GRUB, but GRUB doesn't even show up on my system. Can someone help me with this?\n\nA: You can find a very good guide about GRUB 2 here:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1195275\nThere's a part about reinstalling GRUB from the Live CD (section 13), have you given it a try?\nEDIT: Jordan Uggla gives a much better answer here.\nA broken Windows installation does seem to be the simplest explanation. However, as you say that you created new partitions for Ubuntu, I assumed that you didn't use any of the existing partitions when installing Ubuntu, is that right? If so, I'm not sure how you could have erased the Windows bootloader.\nA simple way to check that would be to look at the root of all the Windows partitions under Ubuntu and search for the following Windows 7 bootloader items: the files bootmgr and  BOOTSECT.BAK, and the folder Boot.\nIf you can't find them, you could probably get them from another install of the same version of Windows or use the boot repair utility in the Windows installation CD.\nIf you choose the second option you won't be able to access Ubuntu once the Windows bootloader has been repaired, and you'll have to either reinstall Grub from the Ubuntu Live CD or use a software like EasyBCD under Windows to add Ubuntu to the Windows bootloader OS list.\n\nA: \nEntering \"grub\" into the terminal tells me it's not installed, and\n  after following directions to install it and rebooting, the same thing\n  occurs.\n\nGRUB2 doesn't have a \"grub\" command, you use grub-install to install grub2. What you've done by running sudo apt-get install grub is to install grub-legacy and remove the grub2 package. This is not what you want (though thankfully it doesn't remove /boot/grub or modify the mbr+embedded area so you're still booting via grub2 even without the package installed). The first thing you should do is run sudo apt-get install grub-pc to re-install the grub2 package (in the rest of this answer I will refer to GRUB2 as simply \"grub\").\n\nThe problem is, GRUB doesn't seem to be working, or it doesn't seem to\n  have been installed at all.\n\nGrub is definitely installed, you wouldn't be able to boot Ubuntu without it. There is a chain of problems, most likely the root of which is that your Windows installation is broken.\nThis chain of problems is as follows: \n\n\n*\n\n*You're not seeing the grub menu at boot because Ubuntu hides the grub menu when it has detected that you're only running one OS on your computer. Which means that \n\n*os-prober (which grub uses to detect other OSs) is not finding any OS other than Ubuntu, i.e. os-prober is not detecting your Windows installation, or at least was not detecting it when update-grub was last run. This most likely means that\n\n*Your Windows installation is missing files which are critically needed to be able to boot Windows. The most common reason for these files to be missing is that the user accidentally removed the Windows \"System\" partition, which is a small partition near the beginning of the drive containing Windows' bootloader.\n\n\nThere are some other possible reasons for os-prober not finding your Windows installation, but they're extremely uncommon. The only solution to this problem is to fix your Windows install, and unfortunately I don't know how to do that outside of a complete re-install of Windows (others may have a better solution for fixing Windows though, and you definitely can backup all your important documents from Windows using Ubuntu before you re-install Windows)\nTo confirm that it's your Windows installation that's broken (or not, as the case may be) please run sudo os-prober and tell us what it outputs, if anything, and run Boot Info Script http://sourceforge.net/projects/bootinfoscript/ and post the RESULTS.txt that it produces.\n\nA: Your best bet is probably going to be Boot-Repair. I've used it a number of times and found it to be by far the easiest way of repairing grub.\n", "Q: How to enable 801.11 n with BCM4313 I own a ASUS 1215N with the BCM4313 wireless radio.\nIn windows I can connect to \"n\" wireless networks without problem however Ubuntu 11.10 can only \"see\"  and connect to \"g\" networks.\nI have already read through How do I get my Broadcom BCM4313 working correctly? and How do I get the Broadcom BCM4313 wireless working on an Asus 1015PX?.

When VLC is running, it prevents the computer from suspending.\nI want it to allow suspend IF VLC is stopped (the media finished playing).\nHow can this be done?\n\nA: I was experiencing the same issue on a Ubuntu 12.04 PC.  I fixed it by taking @hbdgaf's suggestion.  Sucks to fall asleep watching something and wake up to find out that the screen saver never came on.  My solution written in C is what I use now.  It is a daemon that uses the low level DBus API to call methods on VLC to get the playback status and ask VLC to quit if it is stopped.  The bash and python scripts were not reliable when run as Ubuntu Startup Applications on my machine, which is what I wanted.  I shouldn't have to remember to restart a script every time I reboot, right?  They would work if run manually, however.  The C program doesn't have that issue.  Stick it in Startup Applications and forget about it.  \nI'm told that the DBus object name is different in Ubuntu 14.04 (but VLC has the same issue with screen saver).  org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.vlc.instanceXXXXX on 14.04.  org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.vlc-XXXXX on 12.04.

However, Linux has lots of drivers built in. Newer AMD Radeon cards doesn't require any extra drivers. Neither does Intel graphics. I'm not entirely sure what the situation is with Nvidia, though I think the newer ones should work well using built-in drivers. \nUnity uses Compiz, which will always require hardware acceleration, meaning you do need good drivers, or at the very least, not horrible ones. Gnome Shell uses Mutter, which at least currently has similar requirements. But rumor has it, they're working on removing the necessity of hardware acceleration for Gnome Shell.\n\nSince you have a SiS graphics chipset, you will only be able to use the more limited open-source drivers that come by default in a Ubuntu installation.\nWith this chipset, recommendations on desktop-environments would be the more lightweight variant - for example, gnome-classic, unity-2d or xfce/lxde.\n", "Q: How do I get the graphical bootsplash on my Macbook Air?

Or do I simply not get updates on packages which had not updates at the time of my last check?\n\nA: apt-get update updates your local copy of the software catalog, and apt-get upgrade installs the new updates. So if you didn't update your local software catalog, you may not get latest updates (you will get updates from the previous update check).\n\nA: Ubuntu has a good community-sourced HOWTO on this.\nThe repository keeps track of what the latest version of a package is, but your host has to get that information so it can pull the latest version. When you apt-get update you're pulling a fresh copy of the list of all available packages, not just the ones you installed. Running apt-get upgrade uses your local copy of the list, compared against the list of what you have installed, to decide what packages to download from the repository.\nWhenever you run apt-get upgrade, it uses the current (i.e. last downloaded) local copy of the package list to make decisions against. To make sure your local copy is fresh, you should run apt-get update before upgrading, and after adding any new repository location.\nIn most cases (see the link), it's a good idea to use apt-get dist-upgrade instead of apt-get upgrade.\n", "Q: Start wifi in adhoc mode right after boot I'm trying to set my wireless card to adhoc mode after the system starts.

I've found a bunch of similar questions here, but none that quite match my problem.\nMy card is recognised; running \"iwconfig wlan0\" gives something like this:\nwlan0     IEEE 802.11g  ESSID:\"networkname\"  \n  Mode:Managed  Frequency:2.437 GHz  Access Point: Not-Associated   \n  Bit Rate:54 Mb/s   Tx-Power:20 dBm   Sensitivity=-121 dBm  \n  RTS thr=2347 B   Fragment thr=2346 B   \n  Power Management:off\n\nAnd I can see my wifi network's SSID with \"iwlist scan\", so the card is definitely working on some level. I've tried following the Ubuntu docs, specifically running:\niwconfig wlan0 mode managed\niwconfig wlan0 channel 4\niwconfig wlan0 essid networkname\n\nBut this hasn't associated the network with an access point. I've also tried the command \"iwconfig wlan0 key s:mypassphrase\", but this is is rejected with \"Invalid argument\" -- do I need to enter the hex form of the key rather than the passphrase? Or am I missing something else entirely?\n\nA: It turns out that iwconfig was a complete red herring. I instead tried configuring wpa_supplicant, and that did the job.

To my knowledge, standard Linux terminals can only display certain pre-defined colors.  With that in mind, I doubt that hex color codes have been coded into zsh, or even could be, as that would force your terminal/tty to use non-standard colors, some of which it might not have the capability to use.\n\nA: That's right you can't use hex colors. There are only 8 available colors: \n30 - black\n31 - red\n32 - green\n33 - yellow\n34 - blue\n35 - magenta\n36 - cyan\n37 - white\n\nhowever you can change what colors these color names represent in you terminal preferences.\n\nA: The other answers are incorrect. I'm using hex color codes in my zsh prompt. Try this (reference here):\nPS1=\"%B%F{#50F862}%n@%m%f%b:%B%F{#625EF6}%~ %#%f%b \"\nSo far as I can tell, it's not possible to use hex colors in the output, but you can in the prompt. I also haven't been able to get this hex-colored-prompt to work in a screen session, so I probably wouldn't encourage you to do this - but you can do it!\n", "Q: stuck on \"preparing...\" when restoring from deja-dup backup I'm trying to restore my deja-dup backup from a certain date.

I never got any error if the password i entered was not accepted.\n\nA: This could be because you entered the wrong password, but im not sure how dejadupe handles a restore when given the incorrect password. If done properly, it should ask for the correct password until given it, if not then it may assume whatever you entered is the correct password and just keep failing.\nTry mounting the drive normally to make sure you have the right password before starting the restore, and let us know how that goes.\n", "Q: Can't add repository due to 'missing' fingerprint I am trying to install nginx with php but when I am following a guide, like this one: http://www.justincarmony.com/blog/2011/10/24/setting-up-nginx-php-fpm-on-ubuntu-10-04/ I am always told to add that repository (sudo add-apt-repository ppa:brianmercer/php) but I  can't.\nI'll just get \"Error: can't find signing_key_fingerprint at https://launchpad.net/api/1.0/~nginx/+archive/php5\" and when I go to that website I find that there is a fingerprint specified but still I get that error message.

(it's the same for me).\nthe basic idea is to just copy everything, the files and the torrent. \n\nA: In you case I would suggest to install Vuze/Azureus in Ubuntu copy the vuze or azureus folder from Windows located in \\user\\your_username\\AppData\\Roaming\\ to you home folder in ubuntu and rename it to .azureus or .vuze. When I used Azureus, that's Vuze before it's got its new fancy UI, that worked pretty well.\nThe needed torrent files are stored in .azureus/torrents/.\nStarting a torrent with incomplete data is quite simple, open the torrent file with the application, choose the directory where the incomplete data is stored and let the program (re)check which files need to be downloaded.\n", "Q: How to uninstall the Youtube lens?

Ideally in the following way:\n1) Every email should be in a folder whose name is the subject of that email. \n2) The email inside that folder should be saved in text (or at least in an different open document format or pdf file)\n3) As a plus, all attachements of an email should also be stored in the corresponding folder\nBut it's still ok if it is, for example, just one long text file.\nI've tried evolution and thunderbird and couldn't find such functionality (please notice, that I'm not a regular user of these programs since I manage my email online, so I barely know my way around them and only tried them out for the purpose of making this backup).\nThis program doesn't have to have email sending functionality and all the other stuff that evolution & thunderbird can do. I just need to archive my emails, so it only would have to download them and organize them in some way. Saving my attachments would also be nice.\nThe reason I'm insisting on *.txt (or open document format or pdf) files is that I want to be able to read my emails in 10 years from now. If my emails are stored in some format of thunderbird for example and with some update of it support of that format gets dropped, I'm lost. The *.txt probably will still be readable in 10 years time. And open document format files - while there may not be a program that supports them in 10 years - are still readable with a txt-editor, so I can use that to read them and extract the email from all the header data. For PDFs I assume there will still be a reader in 10 years.\n\nA: Here is a Thunderbird addon that can perform the necessary backup. It can save to multiple text files, or just one, depending on your settings, and is licensed under the GNU GPL.\n\nA: Thunderbird saves email in the standard mbox format, which has been around since email was invented, and always will be around as it is in fact, just a plain text file that contains all of the messages concatenated together.\n\nA: I don’t know a solution where each mail gets its own folder, but there are various ways to get each mail as plain text file:\nIf you have your mails as mbox file, you can use\n\n\n*\n\n*Hypermail, to create linked HTML files of your mails\n\n*mb2md, to convert it to Maildir\n\n\nIf you have IMAP access to the mail server, you can use\n\n\n*\n\n*getmail, to download your mails/folders as Maildir\n\n*OfflineIMAP, to download your mails/folders as Maildir\n\n\nIf you have POP3 access to the mail server, you can use\n\n\n*\n\n*getmail, to download your mails/folders as Maildir\n\n\nNote that Maildir is an e-mail format where each mail is stored as a plain text file and each mail folder is represented as folder, too. Attachments are included in the same text file (MIME).\nSo another alternative could be to use any local mail client that uses Maildir as internal e-mail format. You could then simply backup its config folder.\n", "Q: Gnome-shell hide \"Dock\"?

I am using Ubuntu 11.10 and I want to update it via Internet connection but I am not sure if my / partition has enough space.So what is the proper amount of free space required before upgrading to Ubuntu 12.04 from Ubuntu 11.10?\n\nA: The update should tell you how much space it will need before it goes ahead but an upgrade requires usually at least as much space as all the packages you have already installed take up.\nThis is because it needs to download all those packages before it can install them. That needs disk space.\nIf you're particularly worried, removing some of the bigger, non-essential applications that would be upgraded can help. You can reinstall them afterwards when the initial upgrade packages have been removed.\n\nA: The upgrade requires 2070M for the 11.10 installation with the latest updates.\n\nA: You need at least a 4.4 GB space in your hard disk to install Ubuntu 12.04.\n", "Q: How to launch application as root from Unity Launcher? Mainly I am looking for a way to pin an application to the Unity launch bar, and run it as root.\nCurrently, even if I start the application with sudo, and pin it after it starts, it will start as current user next time.\nSad, but there is no context menu option \"run as ...\".\nUpdate: I switched to gnome3 and now I'm happy, I'm missing only the search.\n\nA: As this is an old question, with an old answer;\nTo complement @edm's amazing explanation.\nAs of Ubuntu 18.04 and later, gksudo (gksu) is deprecated and so, it does not have an install candidate in the official repositories. An alternative is to use pkexec.\nEdit the file /usr/share/applications/APPNAME.desktop and change the line\nExec=APP_COMMAND\n\nto\nExec=pkexec env DISPLAY=$DISPLAY XAUTHORITY=$XAUTHORITY APP_COMMAND\n\nMore details on pkexec here.\n\nA: In the Main Menu under System, Preferences, type gksudo in the Command field of Launcher Properties, e.g.:\n/usr/bin/gksudo /usr/bin/yourapplication\n\nYour Name field might say:\n\nsudo yourapplication\n\nSo users know they may see a password popup and why...\nI am not sure about Unity Launcher vs Main Menu. Maybe this helps?\nGood luck\n\nA: The following seems to do the same thing, without needing private attributes:\nActions=Runroot;Another\n\n[Desktop Action Runroot]\nName=Run as root\nExec=gksudo -k -u root APP_COMMAND\n\n[Desktop Action Another]\nName=Another action\nExec=whatever\n\n\nA: As a quick and simple alternative to the cumbersome demands described in the answers here, I've gotten in the habit of doing the following...\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch a new terminal.\n\n*Enter gksu nautilus\n(sudo -i nautilus works, too.)\nThe resulting window falls under the sudo umbrella, so you can use it to access and launch files with sudo-root privileges to your heart's content until it closes.  This comes in handy for transitory situations where you don't need a more permanent solution.  I use it routinely to extract compressed files into protected system folders, for instance.\n\nA: If you want the app to always run as root\n\n\n*\n\n*Pin the application to the launcher as normal.\n\n*Locate the applications .desktop file which will be in either:\n\n\n*\n\n*/usr/share/applications/APPNAME.desktop\n\n*~/.local/share/applications/APPNAME.desktop\n\n*or somewhere else, use locate .desktop|grep APPAME\n\n\n*Open with gedit:\ngksudo gedit /usr/share/applications/APPNAME.desktop\n\n\n*Then change the line\nExec=APP_COMMAND\n\nto \nExec=gksudo -k -u root APP_COMMAND\n\n\n*Save\nThis command will also keep your environment which is very usefull if you need to connect to others servers and use your private key.\nTo add a quicklist option to 'Run as root'\nFollow steps 1, 2 and 3 above\nIf the launcher currently doesn't have any other quicklist options, just append this to the end of the document\nX-Ayatana-Desktop-Shortcuts=Runroot\n\n[Runroot Shortcut Group]\nName=Run as root\nExec=gksudo -k -u root APP_COMMAND\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\n\nA: Im posting this in-respone to the question @Chris asked in comments :\nSuppose you want to create a launcher which will open \"file manager(nautilus)\" as root. Then you can do this:\nOpen terminal. Type: \nsudo -H gedit /usr/share/applications/nautilus_root.desktop\n\nHit enter. When asked, enter your login password and hit enter. This will open gedit (text editor). Now, paste the following there:\n[DesktopEntry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nName=Nautilus(Root)\nComment=FileManager\nExec=gksu nautilus\nIcon=file-manager\nCategories=System;\nType=Application\nTerminal=0\n\nNow, just save it and exit. You are done. Now if you search on dash then you will find a new launcher \"Nautilus (Root)\". Clicking this will ask you password, and upon authentication nautilus will be opened as root. \nNote: Be careful when you are running \"Nautilus (Root)\". In this mode you can delete almost anything from / and break the system.\n\nA: For Ubuntu 22.04 and quick-list 'Run as root' command in the launcher, this is what worked for me:\n\n*\n\n*In terminal, run echo pkexec env DISPLAY=$DISPLAY XAUTHORITY=$XAUTHORITY and copy the output.\n\n*Open and edit your app shortcut config, usually by\n\nsudo nano /usr/share/applications/YOUR_APP.desktop\n\n\n\n*In [Desktop Entry] section add at the end Actions=Run as root\n\n*And below add\n\n[Desktop Action Run as root]\nName=Run as root\nExec=pkexec env DISPLAY=:0 XAUTHORITY=/run/user/1000/gdm/Xauthority YOUR_APP\nOnlyShowIn=Unity\n\n\n\n*In Exec= line, paste line from first step before YOUR_APP command.\n\nIf all good additional command, Run as root should appear after right-click on YOUR_APP icon. In my case, it was almost immediately, but I had to restart the application.\nRun as root menu\n\nA: This should perhaps be a comment on Daniel's solution. It works for me, even in Ubuntu 15.04. I had to put the command between quotes  Exec=gksu \"nautilus --new-window\" because of the extra argument. Also, somehow, I don't know why, I had to edit the launcher directly in order to keep the original menu (together with the new option). If you drag your own launcher, it will get registered, but you will not have the same menu. \nIn Ubuntu 15.04, the launcher for nautilus is usr/share/applications/org.gnome.Nautilus.desktop. You have to use the command line to see the real file name.      \nFurther research lead me to what I believe is a better option : http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2014/04/ubuntu-14-04-add-open-as-rootadministrator-to-context-menu/ . Instead of opening Nautilus entirely as Root, this allows you to open selected directories as Root within Nautilus. Anyway, I checked, and these two options are compatible. If you open Nautilus as Root and then use the second option to open a directory as Root, it simply opens it without asking the password.    \n\nA: To create a shortcut that executes a script with root permissions on Ubuntu 20.04, you can use:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the following line to /etc/sudoers (sudo gedit /etc/sudoers)\n\n\n*\n\n*YOURUSERNAME ALL = NOPASSWD: /script/path\n\n\n*Create a desktop shortcut:\n\n\n*\n\n*gedit ~/Desktop/myshortcut.desktop\n\n\n*Add the following content:\n#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nTerminal=false\nExec=sudo /script/path myarg\nName=Shortcut Name\nComment=Shortcut Comment\nIcon=/usr/share/icons/Humanity/actions/16/media-playback-start.svg \n\n*Right click and the shortcut and choose Allow Launching:\n\n\nA: As of Ubuntu 18.04 gksu is depreciated, pkexec requires an install and doesn't always work.

MenuLibre users (and maybe other GUI menu editors): the Command line in MenuLibre sends to the EXEC line in in the .desktop file, so you don't need to bother digging the .desktop file out.\nIf you try this out from the menu now, nothing will happen.

Movie player, Music player, Office program, Browser etc. (BTW: this is what I want to be helped with my question)\n\n*When removing packages I always favour \"apt-get purge\" over \"aptitude remove --purge\" as aptitude often will also remove essential packages due to package dependencies.

(using precise pangolin)\n\nA: Type this into the terminal:\nsynclient MaxTapTime=0\n\nBut it will only work for the session, unfortunately.\nI have also found this which I have now tried myself\nEssentially it is a way to put the synclient settings MaxTapTime=0 into an executable file (I personally don't like fixes which involve installing GUIs on lubuntu - the whole point of it is lightness. \nI have now found that there is a way to get a .sh file to come on at startup in lubuntu see this thread where I asked about it.\nIf you type \n>>synclient \n\nInto terminal. This will bring up all the possible settings for the touchpad, so you can potentially do more tweaking.\n\nA: All Settings--> Mouse and Touchpad --> uncheck \"tap to click\"\n\nThe image is from Ubuntu 16.04 as it appears on a Lenovo Thinkpad T460.\nI disabled 'tap to click'. I use the touch pad buttons for clicking. This makes my life much better with Ubuntu and Mint.\n\nA: I just tried a the Wayland Gnome session on 17.04 and I noticed that it has many more touchpad options than the X11 session – including a persistent tap-to-click setting:\n\n\nA: In my Ubuntu 12.04 (for Toshiba AC100), there is such an option in the settings, exactly as shown in the image in https://askubuntu.com/a/85069/19753 .\nPerhaps, the required component of the settings menu isn't installed in your system. What can be the explanation otherwise?\nPerhaps, that's the problem regarding \"the ALPS touchpads which are not recognized by Ubuntu. They behave as a PS2 mouse and the touchpad tab is missing from the mouse menu. Therefore there is no scroll option and, the most annoying thing, while typing, the cursor often jumps because I touch the touchpad. I found a program which can disable the touchpad on command: touchpad-indicator, which was found on the Ubuntu help page. This program seems to be able to stop and start the touchpad on command.\"\nI don't know whether you have such an ALPS touchpad. If so, touchpad-indicator could be of some use to you.\n\nA: For KDE, set Touchpad settings → Tap Detection → Maximum Time to 0 ms. Verify by checking that the output of the command synclient contains MaxTapTime = 0. \n\nA: I know this has been answered in the past, but I found for my 2017 xps, I needed to add a few additional settings to actually disable it. I think made the more modern synaptics drivers use these settings instead. \nsynclient TapButton1=0\nsynclient TapButton2=0\nsynclient TapButton3=0\n\n", "Q: After open google chrome Ubuntu 11.10 crashes all browsers  I have been using ubuntu 11.10 for 1 year,today it made me surprised.\nWhen I open google chrome it just closes itself.

Is there any way to modify the theme that comes with Ubuntu 12.04? It was possible with Ubuntu 10.x.\nI wonder why they removed the basic customization. Are there any improvements in this area for 12.04?\n\nA: Just go to /usr/share/themes and you will find the theme files.\nFor instance if you want to edit the Ambiance theme then get into the Ambiance theme folder and you'll find all the CSS and settings files, its really very basic it all consisits of CSS styles and color codes with some images.\n\nA: The easiest way I know of is to install gnome-tweak-tool for any adjustments such as cursors, fonts and icon packs. This allows you to adjust these options on-the-fly and works with both Unity and Gnome Shell (although some of the features, like Shell Extensions, expect Gnome Shell to be installed). \n\nA: Yes, customization of themes is improved radically in Ubuntu 12.04.\nGTK3 themes, which is used by most applications in Ubuntu 12.04, uses the same language that is used to style web pages. You can read about CSS on Wikipedia. This means it has become much easier to learn how to do this since there's thousands of tutorials and books on the subject. Styling GTK2 is not nearly as friendly. \nUbuntu 10.x used a different platform than Ubuntu 11.10 and 12.04 uses. So it's not a matter of having removed things. It's mostly a matter of not everything being implemented yet. It's not the same software, so you can't use the same programs to customize them. \nStill, there are many customization programs you can download and use. Remember that Ubuntu 12.04 is a Gnome 3 operating system. It's Gnome you want to theme. \n", "Q: Black screen after installing Ubuntu 11.10 on new pc \nPossible Duplicate:\nMy computer boots to a black screen, what options do I have to fix it? \n\nAfter installing Ubuntu on my fresh desktop, the Ubuntu loading screen shortly appears and then I get a black screen.

A GUI isn't installed by default with the server edition of Ubuntu. This is the link to the 32-bit Alternate Install ISO for the Desktop edition, which is what would be appropriate for your Pentium 4 based system. (I linked to the Alternate ISO since I believe the Live installer needs more than 512MB of RAM to install, you didn't state how much RAM was in the system, just playing it safe).\nAlso, if you had a way to connect that machine to the internet, you could install the Ubuntu Desktop with the command sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop.\n", "Q: Creating a mixed network. for windows and ubuntu As a Ubuntu newbie (11.10) I have a wired desktop, and a laptop on Ubuntu, and another windows 7 laptop I use for college... \nHow do I get them to \"talk\" to one another, for sharing files... sharing printing... and the like... \nmy Win laptop does not see the Ubuntu machines, even though they connect to the same FIOS Gateway...\nHelp???\n\nA: Install samba\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install samba\n\n*sudo apt-get install samba samba-common\n\n*sudo apt-get install python-glade2\n\n*sudo apt-get install system-config-samba\n\n\ndo a google search on ubuntu to windows share + samba\n\nA: You sould look at samba sharing for Ubuntu.

The machine itself is a Lenovo thinkpad W520, and it previously had an internal HDD. I moved the internal HDD into an expansion bay (replacing the CD-ROM), and put the new SSD into the internal bay. \nThe problem I'm having is that I have my Ubuntu configuration EXACTLY the way I want it - I originally spent many hours configuring it to get it to the way it is now. I'd rather not do this again. But, I'd also like the boot-up gains I would get from the OS being on the SSD.\nSo, what I'd like to do is clone my Ubuntu partition onto the SSD. The catch is that the standard HDD is significantly bigger than the SSD. And it has a windows partition that I don't need on the SSD (I never use Windows, so if it boots off of the other hard drive, that's fine). The layout of my hard drives are as follows:\n/dev/sda (SSD):\n    Model: ATA M4-CT256M4SSD2 (scsi)\n    Disk /dev/sda: 256GB\n    Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B\n    Partition Table: msdos\nNumber  Start   End    Size   Type     File system  Flags\n 1      1049kB  147GB  147GB  primary  ext4         boot\n\n/dev/sdb (HDD):\nModel: ATA ST9500420AS (scsi)\nDisk /dev/sdb: 500GB\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B\nPartition Table: msdos\nNumber  Start   End     Size    Type      File system     Flags\n 1      1049kB  1259MB  1258MB  primary   ntfs            boot\n 2      1259MB  269GB   268GB   primary   ntfs\n 4      269GB   483GB   214GB   extended\n 5      269GB   416GB   147GB   logical   ext4\n 7      416GB   475GB   58.9GB  logical   linux-swap(v1)\n 6      475GB   483GB   8470MB  logical\n 3      483GB   500GB   16.8GB  primary   ntfs\n\nWhat I've tried so far:\n1) Resizing the partitions /dev/sdb5 and /dev/sda1 to be the same size.\n2) Booting into Ubuntu 11.04 (from /dev/sdb5) and running dd if=/dev/sdb5 of=/dev/sda1 (of course this causes problems with booting, so I had to reinstall grub.. I can get it to boot, but then I have problems with initrd not finding some files ... presumably it can't load some partitions I think).\nNow, I think those two steps are the wrong approach, because it will clone /dev/sdb5 EXACTLY - including references in fstab which point to the wrong hard drive. I'm not sure exactly how to rectify this. I could install Ubuntu 11.04 onto the SSD, then try and copy over all of my configurations, but I'm concerned that I'm going to lose something, or that I'm going to overwrite something like fstab that points back to the original hard drive. \nNote that currently, I can still boot from the HDD, so it's not imperative that I get this figured out right away, but I do want it to be exactly how it is right now, so that I can maintain my current level of productivity (it's a work laptop).\nSuggestions on how I might be able to overcome this difficulty? \nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Boot from the livecd, mount both drives, then just copy the files over with sudo cp -ax /media/source /media/dest.  Edit the /etc/fstab on the destination to point to the correct UUID ( look up with blkid ), and reinstall grub.\n\nA: I would suggest avoiding to use dd if=/dev/sdb5 of=/dev/sda1 if your system is running from /dev/sdb5 itself (and presumably not mounted read-only).\nAnother way to copy partitions across is to boot from the live CD (or USB) and start GParted. You can use Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V to copy partitions from one disk to another.\nOne the copy is made (and perhaps after reboot is the partition table needs to be refreshed), still from the live CD, mount your new root partition using a Terminal:\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\n\nThen, edit /mnt/etc/fstab to point to the correct locations.\n\nA: There is more than one way to accomplish getting your old system onto a new drive, but you didn't really ask it that way, you asked for how to clone the system.  \nI would just use gparted, myself, from the live CD so neither partition is mounted.  You can shrink the original partition to the size you want it to be on the SSD, then copy and paste the partition to the new drive.  If I remember correctly, this will reuse the same UUID, but you can change that on one or the other partition afterwards. The command for this is sudo tune2fs -U random  /dev/sdb5 assigns UUID for sdb5.\nIf you don't want to change the old system, and if you want to keep it mounted for a while, you could change the UUID for the SSD partition, and edit your fstab.  It's actually not hard at all, and is something you should learn about.  It's pretty self-explanatory for someone with the knowledge you already seem to have.  Once you assign a new UUID, you can see all of them with this command: sudo blkid -c /dev/null - the parameter -c specifies the cache file, and /dev/null means don't use a cache, so you always get any changes right away.  I always use that form, and can see no downside unless you have a lot of partitions.\nOnce you get the UUID, you can copy and paste it over the old one in /etc/fstab using gedit or whatever text editor you prefer.\nPersonally, though, rather than taking time to resize the partition first, I'd simply copy the old install to the new disk.  If you don't know how to install GRUB to the mbr, you might want to first install a base Ubuntu, then back up /etc/fstab, copy the old install over it, and then copy the fstab from the new install so it has only the correct entries.\n\nA: The bash script clone-ubuntu.sh automates the steps the accepted answer outlines. A menu is provided to make the new partition easy to find:\n\nVisit the link above for a copy of the script and important points to consider such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*rsync is used to clone booted partition and system virtual directories are correctly skipped.\n\n*/etc/fstab of the target clone is updated with correct UUIDs for booting.\n\n*/etc/grub/grub.cfg is updated for seamless grub booting.\n\n", "Q: Can I set up samba so it automatically allows all the local usernames and passwords? I have set up samba like this (this is the complete smb.conf):\n[global]\nlog file = /var/log/samba/log\nlog level = 2\nsecurity = user\n\n[homes]\nbrowsable = false\nread only = no\nvalid users = %S\n\nI'd like to enable every user on server to access their home directories, but for some unknown reason only my 'administrator' account can do so.

To me that sounds like as long as the provided username/password is a valid login on the server, it should work.\nAm I missing something totally obvious? I don't want / can't afford to manually update the samba users and passwords to match the server's.\n\n11.10\n\nA: You will need to manually add your users and passwords to the samba user database using the smbpasswd command. \nIt's not possible to use the local user accounts since Samba and the standard password mechanism on Ubuntu both only store the hash of passwords, and not the passwords themselves. The hashes they use are incompatible, so it's not possible to import password hashes from one database into the other.\nThere are a couple of things you can do to automatically update passwords in both databases at the same time when a user changes their password, such as using pam_smbpass.\n", "Q: How can I enable the nautilus feature that on Shift+Right-Click I get an extra menu entry that says “open with“? I know it was there in previous versions. I often want to open things with gedit.

(ignoring FHS, and assuming you wont try mounting in a place like root)\nsudo fdisk -l will tell you the filesystem type and /dev/ assignment. fdisk -l however will not tell you anything, (strangely, it doesn't return \"permission denied\")\nwhy use dmesg instead of fdisk? because using fdisk assumes your hardware is working. If your hardware fails, fdisk wont tell you. but dmesg will. \n\nA: Probably the partition table has gone all wrong. Your device should be listed in /dev/disk/by-id as @usb-GENERIC (something that resembles the description in line with scsi 10:0:0:0...\nCheck the symblink it leads to (probably will be /dev/sr1). Then you can create a new partition table by:\nsudo fstab /dev/sr1\n\nThen proceed with creating new partition(s) using fstab commands.\n\nA: https://superuser.com/questions/106094/can-not-mount-my-usb-disk-ubuntu-nor-windowsdmesg-including\n\nIt may not be your USB device, but your USB port may not be able to\n  provide sufficient power for the device.\"\nOn my machine, most devices work fine, but I have one USB drive that\n  only works when plugged into one of the rear ports, which are directly\n  on the MB. Symptoms in this case are very similar to your results.\nOptions are to try a different port, or to get a powered USB hub.\n\nIn my case, it didn't work with any USB port. But while reading this answer I remembered that my HD adapter came with a double USB cable and everything worked pretty well when I used it.\n\nA: If you canceled it it might have ended in a state where its not recognized by the OS so it doesn't mount, try lsusb, should be there, also, you didn't post the fdisk -l of when you did plug in the usb\n\nA: When device shows up with lsusb command but is not assigned to a device (/dev/*), then try a USB port directly connected to the motherboard, usually at the back of your desktop.\n\nA: If you happen to be using a removable SD card adapter like me, make sure the SD card has been inserted in the correct orientation. If not, you will see a /dev/sdb device poped up in dmesg but not in fdisk -l and got terribly confused.\n\nA: Try in  /var/run/user/$UID/gvfs\n /var/run/user/1000/gvfs\n\n", "Q: Can't adjust screen resolution in VirtualBox guest I installed Windows7 on VirtualBox but the even in fullscreen the screen of the virtual machine remains small.\nI can't seem to be able to adjust it.

(Either a LiveCD or a LiveUSB). Booting up to that will place you in a working Ubuntu environment where you can attempt to fix whatever is preventing the system from booting.\nThere is a utility called Boot Info Script that will gather all the relevant info and save it to a text file. There is a walk through here. You can then copy this to pastebin or otherwise so we can tell you what you need to do to fix your boot. \n\nA: I would also suggest booting into live media, be it in the form of USB or CD/DVD to enter a working desktop environment, although I have not had any experience with Boot Info Script and would suggest that, if you have problems with it, you should give \"Boot repair\" a go. Once in a working desktop environment and connected to the internet, run these commands to install \"Boot Reapir\":\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\n\nAnd then this one:\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\nOnce this has completed, if you feel confident, have a go with the software and see if it can fix your issue.\nFor more information and guidance visit the link below.\nEDIT: After re-reading your question it seems that your issue is with the Windows side of things. I have had the same issue before and found a solution online somewhere, although I cannot remember it, I do remember that you can access a cmd using the Windows 7 installation disc and visiting the repair option. A google search might come up with a solution using the command prompt.\nBoot Repair \n\nA: The answer for you(sorry 'cause i speak english not well):\n+ Try to boot with Mini XP(or others same it) on USB bootable.\n+ Use bootice(you can download at :www.bootice.narod.ru) to backup current mbr of the hard disk\n+ Use bootice again to change mbr to default mbr 6.x(find and boot the first active partition)\n+ Now shutdown miniXP and reject USB. Power on and your pc will booting with only Windows 7\n+ After your log on to win7, the bootmgr will be fixed. Use bootice to restore the mbr that you backup.\nNow restart system and see what's happened.\n", "Q: MySQL prevents server from booting unless password is entered I am kind of new with Ubuntu but I have been working on setting up a LAMP server with hamachi as a vpn client for management.\nThe issue is that when we turn the server on or restart it we are required to enter the MySQL password before it will continue.\nWhere can we script a password or disable this?

It was Hamachi, even if the network doesn't require a password, you must still give the command line one.

Unfortunately, it does not display (at least when in dual head mode).  \nThis should be simple, but I cannot disable the plugin.  Under Firefox Edit -> Preferences-> Applications -> pdf is set to \"always ask\" so I don't know why it uses acroread in the first place.

I have Firefox 11.0 on Ubuntu 11.10\n\nA: You go to extensions, and there you can disable:\n\n\nA: I you want to get rid of the plugin permanently, because it is not removed by apt if you remove acroread, you have to delete it manually: \nsudo rm /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/npwrapper.nppdf.so\n\nThat worked for me on Ubuntu 13.04\n", "Q: Which Ubuntu version to use on a MAXDATA laptop Eco 3100X ? with this system info \nPossible Duplicate:\nUbuntu on 256MB RAM \n\ni am speaking as new ubuntu user, i just have installed ubuntu 10.04 on my laptop, but is running very slow...\nSo i am here to ask you a question: WHich ubuntu version can fit for my laptop MAXDATA Eco 3100x, .\nAnd the screen freezes sometimes, i did install the lubuntu and xubuntu extention, still problem..

You could only legally use it for personal use, and I don't see a good reason to do it. Dropbox downloads and installs about 50M of proprietary and pre-built binary pieces into your home directory, and runs from there. And synchronizing all your files into the live ramdisk probably isn't a great idea either. It seems like it would be better to just grab the one or two files you might need to play with on a live CD, from the web site while running in the live CD.\n", "Q: Btrfs subvolumes vs folders? I've read a fair bit about btrfs's subvolumes feature. While it would seem interesting to have subvolumes for the main categories in a data filesystem, such as @films, @pictures, @music... What advantage does this provide over just having folders?\nWill I need to mount each subvolume? Or will the subvolumes appear like folders under the root mount point? i.e for a /data mount point will I have: /data/pictures, /data/music, etc\n\nA: The answer to your either/or question is \"both\". Yes, you'll have to mount each subvolume. Each subvolume behaves like a normal file system, so they will appear in mount points like /etc. \nThere are a few advantages to that idea. For instance, you could make your MySQL database directory into a subvolume, which would enable you to take snapshots for use with backups. You could also choose to make that directory into a RAID1, so that if one disk failed, your database would still be intact. Another is using a subvolume for /etc so that you could always reverse any kind of system wide configuration changes. Using a subvolume for /home/username would potentially allow each user to have a time machine, though probably in a much more flexible way than what Apple provides in their system. \nAnd of course, one benefit of having a subvolume for homes and another for the root is the ability to reverse an upgrade. For instance, you upgrade from 12.04 to 12.10 very early, discover that it's a tad too buggy after the first month, so you just un-upgrade your operating system. I haven't tried that myself, but it should work just as good as keeping your home and reinstalling the previous system, except it would take about a second insted of an hour. :)\n\nA: Subvolumes under the default root subvolume appear as folders and do not need to be mounted if you've mounted the root subvolume.\nThe difference between a folder and a subvolume is that subvolumes can be mounted without mounting either the parent subvolume (root) or any other subvolume. And subvolumes can be snapshotted, whereas folders can't be.\n\nA: Subvolume feature, using the current Ubuntu kernel (from ubuntu 12.10), doesn't make much sense as it still misses \"Subvolume Quota Groups\". You have to wait kernel 3.6 (maybe ubuntu 13.04 ?)\nYou can snaphost a subvolume of course, and of course you can't snapshot a directory. But you probably expect subvolumes to work like Logical Volumes with LVM, but with btrfs we don't have an alike scenario, as we don't have quota extension with this kernel. \nTherefore: yes, you can make snapshots, but they look like directories, and if you fill the space on a subvolume, you fill the space on the whole filesystem..... \nYou can even resize a subvolume, by giving the path of the subvolume, but the resize operation affects the whole filesystem, and not the path of the subvolume.\nIn other words, with this kernel, subvolume is not production ready. \nOtherwise, you have to use btrfs filesystems as volumes, and not subvolumes. btrfs filesystem can be shrinked on-line, and extended on-line, and therefore quota is not necessary.\n", "Q: I can not connect to the Internet with cable tengo un computador de escritorio (board: gigabyte h61m, procesador: intel core i3 de 64 bits, ram: ddr3 4 GB) y puedo acceder a internet normalmente desde Windows 7 (mi conexión es por cable directamente al modem (referencias del modem: D-link DSL-2640T)) e instale Ubuntu 11.04 y no puedo acceder a internet, probé con Ubuntu 10.04 (que es el que tengo actualmente instalado) y tampoco funciono no se que debo configurar ni que hacer, simplemente no se conecta, he intentado cambiando de modo automatico a modo manual en ipv4 y colocando los datos correspondientes (dirección IP, máscara de red y servidores de DNS) y no logro conectarme aún, agradezco la ayuda\nmachine traslator   \nHi, I have a desktop (board: gigabyte h61m, Processor: Intel Core i3 64-bit RAM: 4 GB ddr3) and I can access the internet normally from Windows 7 (my connection is wired directly to the modem (modem references : D-link DSL-2640T)) and install Ubuntu 11.04 and I can not access the internet, I tried Ubuntu 10.04 (which is what I have currently installed) and worked either not set or that I should do, just does not connect, I tried switching from automatic mode to manual mode ipv4 and placing the data (IP address, subnet mask and DNS servers) and I can not even connect, appreciate the help\n\nA: This could be many things, like for example your cable doesn't work.\nIf it does what does /etc/network/interfaces say? how about running ifconfig, if you dont see a eth0 somewhere in the previous you can try\nsudo -s\necho \"auto eth0\" >> /etc/network/interfaces\necho \"iface eth0 inet dhcp\" >> /etc/network/interfaces\nifup eth0\n\nif you did get something from those, maybe you just dont have a IP, you can try running dhclient and test your connection.\nAnother possible scenario is that you dont have drivers for your network card (probably not the case) but just in case what do you get by running lspci -k\n", "Q: Where can I get gawk library of functions? Using Xubuntu 11.10 \nI am learning gawk. I would like to get the gawk library of functions mentioned in the gawk users guide. The guide mentions extracting it from the gawk.texi with extract.awk, but I find that a bit too hard.\nIs there a place where I can just download it? \n\nA: The gawk package on Ubuntu includes the library functions mentioned in the manual. You can find a number of them in /usr/share/awk and the rest in /usr/share/doc/gawk/examples.\n\nA: When you're wondering where to get a command in modern ubuntu distros just try to run it at the command line and you'll get something like this:  \nusername@hostname:~$ gawk\nThe program 'gawk' is currently not installed.  You can install it by typing:\nsudo apt-get install gawk\n\n", "Q: Risk of hard shutdown What is the worst case scenario of a hard shutdown with ubuntu (11.10)?\n(in other words, turning PSU off)\n\n\n*\n\n*data loss\n\n*os instability\n\n*etc\n\n\nA: To my knowledge, all of the above. When Ubuntu closes without properly shutting down, no filesystems are unmounted, no open handles are closed and any I/O operations will be stopped mid-process. However, Ubuntu is designed to be fairly robust when it comes to unexpected hardware changes. This can lead to data corruption on any of the mounted filsystems (including /) which can lead to system instability, but this is highly unlikely unless you are running apt-get upgrade at the time. If any extra devices were being written to, and the PSU is suddenly cut, then it's possible that these files would become corrupted and unavailable for use.\nOf course, this isn't going to happen very often at all, but it should at least be avoided as much as possible. Also, after a hard shutdown where you suspect data may have been vulnerable, try booting it up into a Memtest and into the Recovery mode to try and clean it up before booting properly again.\n", "Q: Wine issues with Runescape Believe it or not, I play Runescape. I find the game to be interesting.\nOut of my curiosity, I found that there is a way to play the game in an executable file. However, there was no Linux download for this type of file, so I installed it with Wine, and it seemed to work fine.\nThe game loads up perfectly fine, until it finds updates. When it finds updates, it stops at exactly 92% every time I try running it and I must force quit the application. Anyone else have this issue?\n\nA: Try following this (yes, its got some age to it; but the game hasn't changed much since then) tutorial:\n\nInstalling Java On Ubuntu for RuneScape By Renegades009\nStep 1: After a freshly installed Ubuntu system open up Synaptic\n  Package Manager.\nEnter the password you created at install. Now once its open go to\n  Settings Then click Repositories and make sure all boxes are checked\n  in first tab.\n\nNow go back to the main window and search java. Scroll down to S and\n  mark installation for sun-java6-jre and sun-java6-plugin or something\n  like that.\nDon't forget to mark jre but I have that installed already. Once done\n  click apply and click ok to get dependencies. When done with install\n  restart browser and walla! RuneScape time!\nAlso if RuneScape still doesn't seem to work for you reopen synaptic\n  and install openjdk.\nPlease don't rip my guide or pictures without giving credit and link\n  back. Thanks enjoy!\n\nRunescape is of the same caliber as Minecraft; which both use Java JRE as a game engine. Ubuntu comes with a default install of Java, but you often need to fine-tune the settings in Wine or download 3rd party repositories, to get them to work.  \n", "Q: Requires untrusted packages - adobe flash player \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I install Adobe Flash player?\nWhy does it always say “Requires Installation of Untrusted Packages” and not let me download? \n\nI am new to this and could really use some help. I have tried looking online but I don't understand what I need to do to fix this. My knowledge is very basic. Help would be greatly appreciated. \n\nA: I have this same problem on my machine, but it happens when I try to install anything. The workaround I use is to install the application through the terminal instead. Open a terminal (ctrl + alt + T) and run the following command: sudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer. Enter your password when prompted, then answer 'y' to the next two prompts. After the program downloads and installs flash player  you can close the terminal. Hope that helps!\n", "Q: User in www-data group can not find command I have installed a new application, and I wish to run it by a php script(system and exec function), so that others can run it through their browsers. I tried to run that php script in my terminal at location as \"php shell.php\", and it works, however, when I visit this php page, it says Command not found. It also works in terminal when I logged in a new account(created after the new application installed) and the guest account.\nI think that may be caused by PATH settings, but why new account can run it right(it may prove that PATH is global)?\n\nA: PATH is only set to a minimal value for the entire system, and it may not include wherever your application is. You'd need to set the PATH for the web server to affect how your app is run by web scripts.\nYou should probably have your PHP script simply add the directory needed to the PATH right before calling 'system' or 'exec'. That will keep the change contained to this one script.\nAnother option which may be preferrable is to just call the application by its full path name, so that you don't have to search the path for it. So if it is in /usr/local/bin, just do /usr/local/bin/myapp.\n", "Q: Why do people use console-based file managers? To keep this question specific and on-topic, let me preface this by stating my intent is not to go into pros and cons of using one type of file manager over another.  However, it is clear a significant group of people use console-based file managers, such as Midnight Commander or Ranger.  I'd like to know their reasons for doing so.\n\nA: There may be several reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*They do not depend on X Window, thus can be used even if there are no desktop environment such as a server.\n\n*They are fast and consume less resources (also say above), can be good for old or slow computers.\n\n*They can be powerful and flexible, though you need to learn a bit more than Nautilus.\n\n\nA: I'm a Midnight Commander addict, so let me add a few more points:\n\n\n*\n\n*I find dual pane layout to be very efficient for file operations \n\n*Console keyboard managers are more keyboard-friendly, i.e. it is possible to navigate/select files/perform file operations without using mouse. When working in console, switching to mouse is a hindrance\n\n*Console keyboard managers are... well, console-friendly, i.e. it is easy to navigate the filesystem and issue commands in console at the same time. Or even assemble commands from file names you see in mc etc. \n\n*Muscular memory. Midnight Commander's commands are largely the same as Norton Commander used to have ages ago.\n", "Q: How can I get Spotify to play M4A files? Spotify on Ubuntu 11.10 can only play mp3, does Spotify on Ubuntu support M4A, if so how can I enable this?\n\nA: I have the same issue, I tried installing codecs to see if that was the issue and I can definitely play m4a files in Banshee, Rhythmbox, etc. It seems to just be a Spotify specific issue. I guess we're just going to have to wait until the developers move to GStreamer or something (or even their own codecs, I don't care, as long as it works.)\nSorry I couldn't be much more help.\n", "Q: had an established wireless network but still cannot connect to the internet currently running Ubuntu 11.10. my wireless connection to our router has already been established but when i open Firefox, the page says server not found.please help me\n\nA: I would suggest resetting your Router and your Modem (if you haven't done so already).  In case you haven't I would suggest powering down your modem, router, and PC.  Wait 30 seconds and power up your modem...wait 45 seconds to 1 minute and power up router...wait 45 seconds to 1 minute and then power up your PC.\nI think this should fix it by resetting the IP connection.  I know this works all the time with Windows.\n\nA: Try this, go to terminal and try ping 8.8.8.8. I know you've tried pinging google.com and that it fails, but the difference between pinging google.com and 8.8.8.8 (both are Google) is that 8.8.8.8 doesn't require a name lookup in order to test connectivity. \nIf the ping to 8.8.8.8 is successful, then you have a DNS problem, and should try changing your DNS settings to use Google's DNS servers (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4)\nIf the ping fails, then you have no internet connection at all, and need to either configure the router or modem properly. Your best bet for configuring the modem would probably be to contact your ISP.  Most routers are plug-n-play so that shouldn't need configuring, but if it does we can help you with that as well.\nIf you know how, try logging in to the router to check the status of the internet connection on the router. It's possible, though unlikely, that the internet is getting to the router but no further.\nEdit: Also, though this probably goes without saying, check that you have the modem plugged into the correct port on the back of your router. There are usually 4 or more regular ports, and one 'uplink' port where the modem plugs in. If you plug it in to the wrong port, you will likely have network trouble.\n\nA: try the following command in terminal\nping google.com\nIf it reply then your internet connection is ok, problem is in firefox. Maybe firefox is using proxy, to disable it Go to Edit>Preference>Advance>Network. select Settings for network and  check no proxy.\nIf you can not ping that means something is wrong in routing. Check your router that is it provide service for  specific(mac address filtering) machine? make sure your device mac address is in router\n\nA: Try \n1.ping www.google.com in terminal\n2.if its work then do ifconfig and see which eth0 or eth1 or so.... connected \n3.then do it ifup eth1 or eth2 or any other which is connected in the system.\n", "Q: How to update kernel to the latest mainline version without any Distro-upgrade?

I'm currently running the 3.3.3 precise kernel on oneiric and my machine works better than ever. Performance & battery life increased, while temperatures dropped a few degrees. My issue of a black screen when resuming from standby has also disappeared. Though I personally haven't had issues from using newer kernels, you will find some people who are strongly opposed to doing this.\n\nA: My answer is, YES you can.

If not, search around and I'm sure you'll find a tutorial you can follow such as this one. (note that I haven't checked that one thoroughly so be wary as kernels are dangerous beasts)\n\nA: I created this script kernel-upgrade.sh that downloads and installs a selected kernel from http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline:\nTMP=/var/tmp/kernel\nmkdir -p \"$TMP\" && cd \"$TMP\"\nrm -f \"$TMP\"/*\nF=v4.16-rc6\nV=4.16.0-041600rc6\nR=$(wget -qO - \"http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/$F/0005-debian-changelog.patch\" | sed -ne '/^+linux/{s/.*\\.\\([0-9]\\+\\)).*/\\1/p;q}')\nB=\"$V.$R\"\nURL=http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline\nset -x\nwget \"$URL/$F/linux-headers-$V-generic_${B}_amd64.deb\" \\\n    \"$URL/$F/linux-headers-${V}_${B}_all.deb\" \\\n    \"$URL/$F/linux-image-$V-generic_${B}_amd64.deb\"\nsudo dpkg -i \"linux-headers-$V-generic_${B}_amd64.deb\" \\\n    \"linux-headers-${V}_${B}_all.deb linux-image-$V-generic_${B}_amd64.deb\"\n# now enter: sudo reboot now\n\nIn case Ubuntu doesn't start with the new kernel, you can select \"advanced settings\" in your grub menu and select to start the last running kernel there.\n\nNote: since 4.15-rc7 the kernel has the KPTI fix against meltdown attacks and since 4.15.1 for \"Spectre Variant 2, Mitigation 2\"\n (check with http://github.com/speed47/spectre-meltdown-checker/)\n\nA: None of the above answers satisfied my problem of manually update the kernel to the latest stable version.

I used to upgrade the hard way like some of the answers here suggest but I found this is an easier way.\nImplications of manually installing Kernels\nManually installing kernels requires extra work.\nThere are reasons why you want to install the latest mainline kernel:\n\n\n*\n\n*A bug in the last Ubuntu LTS kernel update and you can't downgrade\n\n*You have new hardware not supported in the current Ubuntu LTS kernel update stream or HWE updates\n\n*You want a security upgrade or new feature only available in the latest mainline kernel version.\n\n\nAs of January 15, 2018 the latest stable mainline kernel is 4.14.13. At the time of writing many are interested to install it for protection against Meltdown security hole. If you choose to manually install it you should know:\n\n\n*\n\n*Older LTS kernels will not get updated until they are greater than  the main menu first option titled Ubuntu.\n\n*Manually installed kernels are not removed with the usual sudo apt auto-remove command. You need to follow this: How do I remove old kernel versions to clean up the boot menu?\n\n*Monitor developments in the older kernels for when you want to get back on the regular LTS kernel update method. Then delete the manually installed mainline kernel as described in the previous bullet point link.\n\n*After manually removing the newest mainline kernel run sudo update-grub and then Ubuntu's latest LTS kernel will be the first option called Ubuntu on Grub's main menu.\n\n\nFinding the latest kernel\nGo to (kernel.ubuntu.com - Kernel PPA Mainline) and press the End key:\n\nNow click on the link 4.9.8 (or a newer one if available when you read this) and the following appears:\n\nNote the links with the black airbrush marks. These are the three we will download for Ubuntu 16.04 64-Bit using Intel or AMD processors.\nInstalling using Terminal\nOpen a terminal session with Ctrl+Alt+T and use:\ncd ~/Downloads # Change to your downloads directory\nll linux*.deb  # Check if any previous downloads still exist\nrm linux*.deb  # Use this command if any previous downloads found\n\nNow switch back to the download screen above and single-click on all three of the .deb kernel downloads. After downloads complete (you'll see status in your browser) switch back to terminal session and use:\nsudo dpkg -i linux*.deb\nrm linux*.deb\nsudo reboot\n\nVoila! - you are running the latest kernel when the first option in grub boot menu is selected. Your older kernel versions are still available under grub's Advanced Options menu.\nAfter installing the newest kernel a dozen times you will ask the question \"How do I remove older kernel versions?\" and you will find those answers here in Ask Ubuntu.\n\nA: The simplest set of instructions I always used for kernel upgrade / downgrade are by ubuntuforums.org user by the name of lykwydchykyn (url modified by me for this post):\n\n\n*\n\n*Go here: http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/\n\n*Download 3 (maybe 4) debs to a folder somewhere:\nlinux-headers-VERSION-NUMBER_all.deb\nlinux-headers-VERSION-NUMBER_amd64.deb\nlinux-image-VERSION-NUMBER_amd64.deb\nlinux-image-extra-VERSION-NUMBER_amd64.deb   # if available\n\n\n*Install the debs with whatever package manager front-end you use (is gdebi still around?), or use these commands:\ncd /path/to/folder/where/you/put/the/debs\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb\n\nSources: \n\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/MainlineBuilds\n\n*http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=11391743#post11391743\n\nA: Late but new answer.\nI will add some more information in my answer. Now my old kernel was linux-headers-4.8.0-53. To find out which kernel you have type uname -r in terminal. Now type this command to get list of available kernels.\napt-cache search linux-image\n\nThis will give you a very big output. Now chose one of them that you want to install and install it by following commands(Don't type these commands like this, replace the words kernal_version with the kernel version which you wish to install)\nsudo apt-get install linux-image-kernal_version\nsudo apt-get install linux-image-extra-kernal_version\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-kernal_version\n\nNow in my case I choose linux-image-4.10.0-22-generic so my command will look like this \nsudo apt-get install linux-image-4.10.0-22-generic \nsudo apt-get install linux-image-extra-4.10.0-22-generic\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-4.10.0-22-generic\n\nNow in the end remove old kernel by command\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nNow when I first did it, I Don't know is it my hardware problem or because of removing the old kernel, but my laptop shows me black screen which happens to my laptop sometimes.

You can load any version of ubuntu to that. \nHowever in this case you can install either 64bit version or 32bit version, there will be no change as your ram size is 4GB.\nMaximum memory supported by a 32bit OS (without PAE kernel) is 2^32 byte i.e.  4GB.\nFor more than 4GB ram , you should consider 64 bit.\nRefer here for more details.\n", "Q: How to add new hard drive with NTFS partition?

I found the other post after digging a little wider hole. \n\nA: I use terminator as my primary terminal, and I've tried Guake and Tilda but missed tiling in the dropdown. I went with the suggestion @Pablo Bianchi mentions above as a secondary option: Tilix in Quake mode.\nI didn't want to use terminator as a dropdown as I generally have 1-5 (yes 5!) full screen terminator instances open at any given time and I didn't want to deal with the logic of having a separate config for just a single instance.\nI installed tilix on Ubuntu 18.04 from the repo:\n$ sudo apt install tilix\n\nSet my config, colors, etc. and Quake mode settings in the Preferences menu, then created a startup application entry (I use Cinnamon DE) for Tilix in the GUI, but you can replicate that like this:\n$ cat <<EOF > /tmp/Tilix\\ Drop-Down.desktop\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nExec=/usr/bin/tilix --quake\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true\nNoDisplay=false\nHidden=false\nName[en_US]=Tilix Drop-Down\nComment[en_US]=Launch Tilix in Quake mode\nX-GNOME-Autostart-Delay=5\nEOF\n\nThis autostart method should work for more than Cinnamon, I'd expect it would work for most GTK based desktops (I think is part of the XDG freedesktop standard...?).\nFinally, set a hotkey of your choice via the method employed by your DE. In Cinnamon this is stored in dconf, which means it's way easier to use the settings GUI than to script getting things in the dconf DB.\nI've used Tilix before, almost replaced Terminator but I think memory usage made me switch back. With the large number of terminator instances I run, the reduced memory usage is important. Running Tilix in a limited instance case such as Quake mode as we are here, will probably be just fine.\n", "Q: disabling password \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I enable auto-login in LightDM? \n\nI always annoyed when my new computer is turned on and log in, the problem is when i want to browse are always asked to enter a password, is there any way that I do not need to enter a password every new computer was first turned on?

Just in case yours is a bug and it has been fixed, your problem will be solved straightaway.\nThen, try starting the Xserver by using the command startx\nIf that works, then you have a working GUI now.

I am currently using 12.04 LTS.\nThinking ahead, if I upgrade to 12.10 or any other future release, do I lose the Long-Term support (LTS)?\nThis may be a stupid question as I found part of my answer in this link .\n\nA: LTS is just a flag that stops the distro from having N+1 updates made available to it, only N+LTS. So yes if you choose to break the update cycle, you've lost the LTS release. You've got to make up your mind and decided do you want the latest whiz bang features or stability? Once you get into PPAs, staying on an LTS is quite nice.\n\nA: Sometimes features go away permanently.  For instance, if you like Gnome 2 or the Gnome screensaver (my favorite is Cosmos), stick with 10.04.04 until support runs out.\nAt other times it depends on your hardware.  For less than 640MB RAM or no 3D Graphics, get the latest release of Lubuntu or Xubuntu, and keep ubgrading every six months.  As long as the lightweight desktops run on an old machine, the more new features, the better, especially with LXDE/Lubuntu.\nBut with 768MB to 1GB RAM, you will need Gnome 2, not 3, stick with 10.04.04.  Gnome 2 is still on 10.10 (possibly also as Ubuntu Classic on 11.04, depending on how you installed/upgraded), but support runs out earlier.\nWhenever you are not sure, either use a live CD to test all features you use, or try an install on a replacement hard drive.  You can keep your data and settings by cloning the old hard drive first, then upgrading (safeguard the old hard drive in case you want to go back).\nIf hardware constraints or preferences for Gnome 2/KDE 3 are not an issue, go with your gut.  Upgrade every six months if you love to try out the newest and latest software.  Upgrade every LTS release if you prefer not to do unnecessary work on you computer.\n\nA: Yes\nOnce you upgrade to 12.10, you will no longer be running 12.04, and no longer running an LTS release. \nThe purpose of the LTS releases if for those who don't necessarily need the absolute most up-to-date packages, and would rather not upgrade every 6 months, but still get critical security updates and bug fixes for longer than the 18 months of support given to a standard (non-LTS) release.\n", "Q: Touchpad not working on HP DV4 notebook the touchpad doesn't respond at all. i had to use an external usb mouse even to install ubuntu.

I installed a small 3gb Ubuntu partition just to delete some annoying files in XP, but I accidentally turned the XP partition into Swap and I can only boot in Ubuntu. I do not necessarily want to save any of the XP data, but just to uninstall ubuntu and reinstall XP from a USB flash drive (when I try doing that, I cannot see the Hard Drive to boot on).\n\nA: Insert Ubuntu Live CD and use GParted to format the disk.\n\nA: If you are using a notebook, you should change your BIOS boot-priority; and load into the Live Ubuntu image just like you did when you installed. The program you need to run is called Gparted not \"Gpartet\". When you open Gparted, you will be able to format your entire disk and re-install whatever operating system you want. If you are installing XP, instead of leaving the Hard Drive unallocated - - you could make the entire HDD NFTS (Windows Primary File System) to speed up the XP install. Good luck!\n\nA: it's because windows can't read file systems other than FAT or NTFS and your hard drive doesn't have mbr anymore. you can daownload partedmagic and bootable usb creator like yumi make a bootable usb. boot from usb and fix your bootloader and partitions from partedmagic, then try to install windows again.\n", "Q: Using opencv on 12.04 I have some simple opencv files which I wanted to compile on 12.04.\nI have installed all the -dev packages\nThey use:\n#include <cv.h>\n#include <highgui.h>\n\nat the top of the file.\nUsing\ng++ `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv` canny.cpp\n\ngives cv.h: No such file or directory\npkg-config seems to list /usr/include/opencv but the directory created at install is /usr/include/opencv2\nIs this a bug?

It may be a function key, slider switch or other. If unsure of its location, head to the mfr's website and search the manual.\nThose who, like me, leave WIFI on all the time are most susceptible to this trouble.

I think Ubuntu gets confused by having both \"sony-wifi\" and \"acer-wireless\" (which you can see in the previous answers \"sudo rfkill list all\"), and the rmmod will clear the \"acer-wireless\" option. \nA more permanent version of this solution, suggested on this thread http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1859633.html, is to just blacklist it by adding \nblacklist acer_wmi\n\nto\n/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nand then restarting your system.\n\nA: I just tried this:\nshell> sudo rfkill list all\n\nThe output was something like this:\n0: sony-wifi: Wireless LAN\nSoft blocked: yes\nHard blocked: no\n1: sony-bluetooth: Bluetooth\nSoft blocked: no\nHard blocked: no\n2: phy0: Wireless LAN\nSoft blocked: yes\nHard blocked: yes\n4: hci0: Bluetooth\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: no\n\nThen I have run this command:\nshell> sudo rfkill unblock wifi\n\nand all is fine now :)\nHave fun :)\nI hope it will help you :)\n\nA: Check your BIOS settings. In my laptop's BIOS, there is an option of shutting down Wireless, Bluetooth and other networking interfaces. \nThe other problem might be that there is a physical problem with your Wireless hardware\nThe other case might be that your hardware is blacklisted.

I know that I can create link named /usr/bin/pssh linked to /usr/bin/parallel-ssh but these seems dirty hack to me. :(\n\nA: Regarding the why, see /usr/share/doc/pssh/README.Debian.\nTo avoid any conflicts with the putty package, all of the programs have been\nrenamed.\n\nparallel-ssh is pssh\nparallel-scp is pscp\nparallel-rsync is prsync\nparallel-nuke is pnuke\nparallel-slurp is pslurp\n\nAbout that symlink, a slightly cleaner solution is creating /usr/local/bin/pssh symlink and let it point to /usr/bin/parallel-ssh. With the exception of /usr/local/ it is generally best to leave the content of /usr/ to the package manager. By default /usr/local/bin is too part of the PATH environment.\n\nA: Try with parallel-ssh it has been renamed.\nQuote from package description:\n The package contains:\n .\n  - Parallel ssh (parallel-ssh, upstream calls it pssh), executes commands on\n    multiple hosts in parallel\n  - Parallel scp (parallel-scp, upstream calls it pscp), copies files to\n    multiple remote hosts in parallel\n  - Parallel rsync (parallel-rsync, upstream calls it prsync), efficiently\n    copies files to multiple hosts in parallel\n  - Parallel nuke (parallel-nuke, upstream calls it pnuke), kills processes on\n    multiple remote hosts in parallel\n  - Parallel slurp (parallel-slurp, upstream calls it pslurp), copies files\n    from multiple remote hosts to a central host in parallel\n .\n These tools are good for controlling large collections of nodes, where faster\n alternatives such as gexec and pcp are not available.\n\n\nA: Sometimes the name of the command used to start the program isn't the same as the name of the package that you installed to get said program.  \nI recently found this when I installed Maze of Galious to give it a go, it didn't show up in the Games menu and it took me a couple minutes to find out that to start the game I had to go to terminal and type 'mog'.  /anecdote.\nThis could happen for variety of reasons, maybe the name (like in my anecdote) is too long to be a reasonable name for the command, maybe the name the developer wanted was already chosen, maybe the developer had brain-worms and just wanted to mess with you by calling it something totally random -- the why isn't worth worrying about, if you want to 'fix' it just use an alias or a sym/hard link.\nIf it bothers you that much you could submit a change request upstream, but if the developer chose that name s/he likely had a good reason.\n", "Q: Partitions and cdrom are not automounted Provide my spec and sorry for my poor English first.\n\n\n*\n\n*MB: Gigabyte G31M-S2L (bios ver.

The \"Skype Phone\" devices marketed for plugging into your computer are just a USB soundcard in a phone-shaped package, so if you already have a working sound card that has a microphone input, use that with Skype instead.\nSkype run nicely on Ubuntu.

I'd like to start using my docking station again; however, it still doesn't work as it should, see the following bug descriptions (with special focus on Thinkpad X41 & the X4 Dock). Given that it still doesn't work (effective April 2012), my hope is fading that it will start working all of a sudden with Precise Pangolin at the end of the month. This issue is VERY important to me and I would be MOST grateful to anyone being able to sieve through the following links (some of which are actually quite recent) and translate their meaning into reliable and concrete simple (?) steps. I've read briefly about hal and udev, and can imagine that they are somewhat related to this, see links below. I don't want to fire at random. I don't want to tinker around with bash scripts if avoidable...\nProblem description (more or less ;-)\n\nPressing the undock button on a \"ThinkPad X4 Dock\" with a ThinkPad X40 does not\n  cause any udev events. And the lights on the dock never change to indicate it\n  is safe to undock.\n\nand\n\nIBM Thinkpad X41 & docking station >> no joy :-( ... when pressing the blue undock button on the docking station:\n   - The screen goes blank (with backlight remaining on),\n   - with some SSD/HDD activity;\n   - ctrl alt del causes a shut down after ... seconds, indicating that the system itself hasn't \"crashed\" but is still (somewhat ?)\n  responsive.\n\nand\n\nWith recent distributions, docking and undocking should function out of the box. You can monitor this by running # udevadm monitor and when you dock or press the undock button you should see a flurry of events. There are some issues though: No event on undock. - In some cases you may not get any events on\n  undock. This is due to the ACPI dock drivers only registering the\n  first logical Dock port they encounter and in some rare cases there\n  may be more then one, such as on a ThinkPad X40 with ThinkPad X4 Dock.\n  Patches are available, and are merged in\n  2.6.34.\n\nNow, if patches are available and merged into 2.6.34 - why isn't (un)docking simply working / fully supported in the latest version of Natty (which to my humble understanding has surpassed kernel version 2.6.34 a while ago)?\nMore relevant links:\n\nThinkPad X41 Docking Station\n  issues\n\nand\n\n[HOWTO] Run scripts for laptop lid open/close and dock/undock\n  events\n\nand finally\n\nSymptoms corrected by the latest BIOS Update - ThinkPad X41 - (Fix) USB devices connected to UltraBase X4 or ThinkPad X4 Dock may\n  not be recognized in Boot Menu by pressing F12 during\n  POST.\n\nThanks!!\n\nA: This is preliminary, but pending further findings I think this issue has been resolved by means of normal updates: it seems to be working just fine now (using the blue undock button on the docking station when undocking; and cycling through fn f7 if using an external monitor), hot-warm-lukewarm docking all seems to be handled well now.\nThanks, UBUNTU !\nUPDATE:\neven after (accidentally) undocking (while a lot of stuff was running) without pressing the blue undock button on the docking station the system remained stable / responsive / \"there\" / reliable / etc (only a quick \"toggle\" of fn f7 needed to get the display(s) back in order).

I am quite a cautious person though not afraid to experiment.\nI currently have 11.10 Unity and 12.04 Beta 2 running on different partitions (no problems). I have learned here that Unity can run in VirtuaBox.\nWhen I upgrade to 12.04 LTS later this month, I am curious to understand if I could also run 12.04  in Virtual Box for experimentation and test some things before I implement them into my system?\nMaybe there is a better way to achieve this, without partitioning my hard drive.\n\nA: Yes you can try ubuntu 12.04 in latest virtual box version. The latest VirtualBox 4.1.12 has support for Ubuntu 12.04 http://news.softpedia.com/news/VirtualBox-4-1-12-Has-Support-for-Ubuntu-12-04-262435.shtml.\n\nA: In my experience it is quite a good idea to install and run a test OS in Virtual Box. But there are some drawbacks you might want to consider:\n\n\n*\n\n*All CPU demanding processes will run a bit slower in a virtual machine.\n\n*3D graphics even though available to some extent is slow and not suited for gaming (but sufficient for Unity).\n\n*Bugs you may experience may not only come from the applications but also from the virtualization environment.\n\n*Updating Virtual Box and the virtual machines installed may take some of your time.\n\n*Some hotkeys of the host (e.g. Super, Ctrl+F.., etc.) do not work without tricks in the guest OS. Likewise some key combinations are reserved by Vitual Box and can not be used in the guest OS.\n\n\nStill there are advantages that a dual boot solution can not offer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Immediate switching between host and virtual OS without needing to reboot.\n\n*Running the test OS parallel to the host OS (depending on your hardware you can even run multiple virtual OSs in parallel).\n\n*Possibility to save snapshots before you do possible harmful things that enable you to restore the previous functioning state if something goes wrong.\n\n*Keep your virtual guest machines over host OS upgrades. You can even carry them to another OS (e.g. Windows, MacOS, other Linux distribution) without any problems.\n\n*Simultaneous file access through networking.\n\n\nTo take full advantages of Virtual Box it is a good idea to run the latest release installable from a repository maintained by Oracle that gives you automatic updates. If you need USB2 or RDP support you also may want to install the Virtual Box Extensions (which makes it a closed source but still free version).\nFor running Unity, unlimited screen geometry, some 3D graphics support, and Virtual Box shared folder suport we also need to install the Guest Additions.\nLet me suggest you try it out with you present 11.10 installation (or in your 12.04 Beta installation). Your virtual machines will not be touched trough an upgrade, just keep them running almost forever (I still have a machine here I built from Ubuntu 9.04).\n", "Q: Torrent clients suddenly stopped downloading A few days ago I noticed, that Transmission in my Ubuntu 10.04 machine suddenly couldn't download anything anymore. To overcome this I have uninstalled and reinstalled Transmission and tried downloading with other clients (Deluge, Vuze) well seeded torrents (ubuntu iso images for example) without success.\n   On the same computer I have also installed Ubuntu 10.10 and Windows 7, which I rarely use. What makes the problem I encounter weirder, is the fact that downloading via torrents works fine in my Ubuntu 10.10 and Windows partitions but not in Lucid Lynx.\n   Browsing the web for similar problems didn't give me answers. Any help would greatly appreciated.     \n\nA: The problem is solved. My Peerguardian Linux installation caused all the trouble due to either some kind of a bug or some configuration adjustment I tried but can't remember. This was determined by the use of Wireshark (it informed me that the torrent clients connect to the trackers) and by getting the output of sudo iptables -L in a terminal (the output showed that pgl interfered with my machine's iptables rules). Temporarily terminating the appliance of these rules with sudo iptables -F proved the aforementioned hypothesis. Finally I uninstalled and reinstalled Peerguardian Linux and thus solved the problem.\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu generally post timely security updates? Concrete issue: The Oneiric nginx package is at version 1.0.5-1, released in July 2011 according to the changelog.\nThe recent memory-disclosure vulnerability (advisory page, CVE-2012-1180, DSA-2434-1) isn't fixed in 1.0.5-1. If I'm not misreading the Ubuntu CVE page, all Ubuntu versions seem to ship a vulnerable nginx.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this true?\nIf so: I thought there was a security team at Canonical that's actively working on issues like this, so I expected to get a security update within a short timeframe (hours or days) through apt-get update.\n\n*Is this expectation -- that keeping my packages up-to-date is enough to stop my server from having known vulnerabilities -- generally wrong?\n\n*If so: What should I do to keep it secure? Reading the Ubuntu security notices wouldn't have helped in this case, as the nginx vulnerability was never posted there.\n\nA: Packages inside the Ubuntu 'main' repository are actively kept up to date by Canonical. (To be part of the default installation, a package must be inside main.)\nHowever, for packages such as nginx, that are in the \"universe\" then I would not expect timely security updates. This is because these packages are maintained by volunteers, rather than Canonical. It would not be reasonable to expect Canonical to constantly monitor the tens of thousands of packages that exists in the universe.\n\nA: Ubuntu is currently divided into four components: main, restricted, universe and multiverse. Packages in main and restricted are supported by the Ubuntu Security team for the life of an Ubuntu release, while packages in universe and multiverse are supported by the Ubuntu community. See the security team FAQ for more information.\nSince nginx is in the Universe component, it does not get updates from the security team. It is up to the community to fix security issues in that package. See here for the exact procedure.\nYou can use Software Center or the ubuntu-support-status command line tool to determine which packages are officially supported, and for how long.\n\nUpdate from the future: Nginx is moving to main so will receive support from the Ubuntu Security Team at that point. If you're unsure whether your version will, just look at apt-cache show nginx and look for the \"Section\" tag. When that's in Main, you're getting Canonical support for it.\n\nA: The nginx package in ppa for precise is at Version 1.1.17-2 uploaded on 2012-03-19.  \nIf you need patches for CVEs that are still in candidate and not accepted, you might consider adding ppas.  \nOn this particular package and bug here are some notes from the package bug tracker.  \n\nA: For packages that are on Debian based distributions such as Ubuntu, security patches are back-ported into the current release.  Release versions are not updated as that may introduce incompatible features.  Instead the security team (or package maintainer) will apply the security patch to the current version an release a patched version.  \n\n\n*\n\n*The version currently deployed may be vulnerable as it is not supported by the Ubuntu Security team.  This does not mean that it is vulnerable as the package maintainer may have patched it.  Check the changelog in the /usr/share/doc/nginx directory to see if the security patch has been backported.  If not the patch may be in progress and available in testing release. \n\n*You are correct in assuming that keeping your server up to date will significantly reduce the period you are running insecure software.  There are packages which can be configured to automatically download and optional install updates.

I have installed Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin). If I open System Settings >> Displays there is a new (?) on/off button for a setting named Sticky edges.\nCan someone tell me what this setting is supposed to control?\n\nA: The answers by UbunTom, Jeff Welling, and Jayson Rowe, are all correct.\nIn fact, the accepted answer (with 10 votes currently) is completely wrong. Unfortunately, even the bug entry found in the accepted answer gets it partially wrong (not the first poster who says he doesn't know, and not Simon's answer, but some of the responses that suggest to relabel the sticky edge with the expected behavior of the mouse sticking to the edge). \nThe sticky edge toggle actually has absolutely no bearing on the mouse sticking to the side of the screen of a multi-monitor set up. I know this because I'm currently typing this from a multi-monitor set up. And even when this toggle is turned off (and the change is applied), my mouse still sticks a little bit to the side of the screen positioned adjacent to my second monitor (before it crosses over completely to it). \nWhat this setting controls however is the semi-maximizing property of windows when the cursor touches the side of the screen while it's dragging a window bar to it.  \nJayson Rowe nailed the description of the behavior in his comment: \n\nIt kinda does in a multi-monitor setup - for example, with it turned\n  off, a window will not semi-maximize on the left-hand side of the\n  right-hand monitor, but it will when it turned on. – Jayson Rowe\n\nIn my personal experience of using this setting both in a single monitor set up (when I'm on my laptop), and of using this setting in a multi-monitor set up at home when my laptop is connected to a second additional screen. I find that this sticky edge toggle should always be left turned on (Although, Simon in the bug entry seems to disagree with me, because he's so used to be able to drag windows from screen to screen smoothly, he hates it when that doesn't do that).\nIn either case, this makes me think that the person, who originally envisioned this setting and designed the UI for it, is probably not the same person who implemented it programmatically. And that's probably the bug, that this setting was originally meant to toggle the mouse sticking to the edge, but the person implementing it, took it to mean that it should toggle the windows sticking to the edges instead.\n\nA: I found that if you simply disable sticky edges the mouse gets stuck on the other display. This is probably intentional, because launcher placement would not make any sense for both displays if you cannot select the launcher on the other display.\nSo what you need to do is Settings > Displays set sticky edges to OFF and set launcher placement to only one monitor.\n\nA: It controls the mouse behaviour at the edges between monitors in a multi-monitor setup:\nIf \"Sticky Edges\" is enabled the mouse stops on the edge.\nSee bug #965080 if you think this should be more obvious.\n\nA: I dont know for sure but it sounds like that toggles the ability to drag a window close to the edge and have the window jump to that edge, lined up perfectly.\n\nA: So, to quote someone from the bug discussion that @Florian Diesch posted, one one user put it, the \"Sticky edge\" toggle would more accurately be called \"Avoid my mouse cursor to be accidentally lost in another display.\" \nAfter playing with the setting, I've found that cursors moving at significant enough velocity can break the monitor barrier, and escape to the next display over. \nAccording to this answer, it seems that Alt+F2 -> \"gconf-editor\" may allow you to actually change the velocity variable, which could, in theory, for someone, under the right circumstances, make the option actually useful. \nJust disable Sticky edges in the Displays section under All Settings\n\nA: It allows you to position the edge of a window next to the edge of the screen\n\nA: It is an interesting concept and nice way to working around docking to the edge where the two monitors meet\n", "Q: LibreOffice: Open in current program by default?

However, once I have Calc running, if I do File > Open and select a spreadsheet with the extension .txt, it opens it in Writer instead.  \nIs there a way to tell the file I'm trying to open using whatever program instead of trying to pick which one to use?  \nBarring that, is there a way I tell it to always use Calc for .txt files (when I open them from the open dialog in Calc)?  I still want them to open in GEdit like they currently do if I double click them from Thunar.\n\nA: I finally got the functionality I need by removing LibreOffice Writer all together.

Ubuntu Precise uses apt-cacher-ng version 0.7.2-1, to date there are MANY bug fixes to this software, and the newer version: 0.7.26-1 is much more stable.\nI have installed the Ubuntu Quantal version of apt-cacher-ng from packages.ubuntu.com, which is version 0.7.26-1.\nI highly recommend grabbing the future/testing version of apt-cacher-ng, and manually installing this newer package.\n\nA: I would suggest to switch away from APT-cacher-ng and check out Squid-deb-proxy.\nAPT-cacher-ng has proven to be very buggy in my experience and tons of bug reports are outstanding. Only recently it has been proposed again to get unblocked in Debian now that some major bugs are squashed. For Ubuntu I've switched to Squid-deb-proxy a long time ago and I don't regret it. It's a great alternative and the best APT-cacher I've come around.\nFor Squid-deb-proxy, just install the package squid-deb-proxy and add allowed destination domains in a new file in /etc/squid-deb-proxy/mirror-dstdomain.acl.d. As a bonus, clients can auto-discover caching-enabled machines in the local network by having the squid-deb-proxy-client package installed.\n\nA: My upgrades would always almost succeed -- 95% of the files would download through the proxy, leaving maybe the last ~100 files failing with 'hash sum mismatch', and none of the proposed solutions would ever work.\nAnd then, just for grins-and-giggles, I moved 01proxy over to 01proxy.ng, ran aptitude update, then update-manager and selected the distribution-upgrade.  It proceeded to download the remaining files from archive.ubuntu.com (~70M rather than ~1G), and the rest of the upgrade went smoothly.  After rebooting, I moved 01proxy.ng back to 01proxy, and everything was back to normal.\nI've done this twice now, once on the proxy server itself and once on a client, and both succeeded just beautifully after failing (at that 95% mark) when going through the proxy.\n\nA: Removing the /var/cache/apt-cacher-ng/download.virtualbox.org folder did help me to fix the problem with Failed to fetch ... Hash Sum mismatch on apt-get update that prevented virtualbox-4.3 package from Oracle server. \n\nA: Suggestion 4\nRunning sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y on the Apt-Cacher NG server may fix the problem. You need to do that every time the problem occurs.\nSuggestion 5\nSometimes the problem is on the mirror: changing the mirror in /etc/apt/sources.list, both on the server and the clients, may fix this problem.\n\nA: You can also remove the whole repository folder\nrm -r /var/cache/apt-cacher-ng/<repository_folder>\n\nwhere the package with the hash sum mismatch is stored.\nOn next apt request a new folder with clean hash sum will by automaticaly created by apt-cacher-ng.\n", "Q: can't download music files purchased with ubuntu one from rhythmbox I used the link to Ubuntu One in Rhythmbox music player to purchase music.

The music is stored in ~/.ubuntuone/Purchased from Ubuntu One/, and it should show up in your Rhythmbox library without requiring a separate import.\n\nA: Did you complete the purchase? Clicking \"Download\" on a track in the store will take you to the \"My Basket\" page, where you should see a \"Checkout\" button. You can go back and add more items to your cart, or just check out from there. If you haven't actually purchased any music, then it won't download.

You'll need to make sure you first download the ISO (If you want the best compatibility use a 32bit ISO). In the Startup Disk dialog you can sepcify how much space you want reserved for saving things like new software, documents, and settings. After doing so choose the Disk drive you want to use and the ISO then Make Startup Disk.\n\nEverytime you plug in the USB select \"Try Ubuntu\" instead of install in the boot menu. That will drop you in a live session and your data will be saved to the extra space specified during the creation stage.\n\nA: You can, just install it in a regular way. Connect your USB drive, insert the installation disk, and start the installation process. When you are asked to choose the drive to install, indicate your USB drive. The boot loader should also be installed on the same drive.\nMake sure you have enough space on the USB drive.\nTo boot from USB, you'll need to tweak the order in which BIOS tries to load a system from detected devices on each machine.\n", "Q: How to change icons of specific file types on Ubuntu 11.10?

In addition, most domestic ISP contracts forbid you to run a commercial service from your connection.\nThe domain you want is already registered, although it's \"on hold\". The entity holding the registration has probably acquired it speculatively in the expectation that they can extract a good price from someone who wants it.\nI think you need to learn more about how TCP/IP networks work, how the DNS system works, and you need to obtain a commercial ISP service, or a hosted server from a company specializing in such things.\n", "Q: Just Installed Ubuntu - Mostly empty screen that doesn't respond to mouse clicks or keyboard I installed (twice) Ubuntu x64 11.10 and it does boot (most of the time, sometimes it gets stuck with this problem My fresh installation doesn't load.

I was able to connect to the wireless connection when I was using the live cd and installing Ubuntu, but after the install and restart I could no longer connect.  Every few minutes I am asked for the network key, but it never finishes connecting\n\nA: Does it work with Windows?  Or is this specific to Ubuntu?\nCan you get to the Uverse router management page?  The default URL is http://192.168.1.254/ .  I would check that page out, and make sure that your system is showing-up there.\nHow many other devices do you have on the Uverse WiFi?  If I remember right, AT&T Uverse allows a maximum of four devices.  Make sure that you're not violating that limit.  Can those other devices connect properly?\nI actually got around that limit by using a router as one of my devices.  That way, my five hardwired computers would register to Uverse (through the router) as one device, and my laptop, Wii, and my wife's phone could take the other slots without worry.\nBut I don't recall anything specific that I had to do to get it to work with Ubuntu.

I'd like links I click on in Midori to automatically open in another web browser, Firefox.  How do I do this?\n\nA: I'm fairly certain you'd have to modify Midori in order to do that. Perhaps you could make an addon. One way might be to add an option in a right-click menu, for instance. There is no general way of doing something like that, that I know of. \n", "Q: How to install the full GNOME desktop as close to upstream as possible? Just like the title says. I don't want just Gnome Shell I want to know how to install the whole entire desktop, with the latest GDM(not the 3.0.4 currently in the repos), all the default apps, all of it. I want to have a gnome desktop as pure as the latest Fedora, but of course I don't actually want to use fedora I been a Ubuntu user for years. \nAny ideas? or am I crazy? I cant find anyone else doing this, though I have found a few other people who want to do it. \nI currently have Gnome Shell 3.4, but I cant figure out how to install the new login screen, and I don't know what apps install by default other than epiphany and empathy, I also don't know if there is still more missing than just those things listed. \nI would really enjoy the full Gnome 3 experience. \n\nA: It depends upon what you understand by \"pure gnome-3\".  Obviously each distro pulls in components its developers consider makes up a great combined release.\nFedora and Ubuntu have different views.  The Gnome-Shell developers work on a core set of applications that each distro either includes by default or is available in their respective repositories.\nSince you mentioned Fedora and its default applications- then you should consider the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install gnome-shell - How do I install and use the latest version of GNOME?\n\n*Remove Unity - How can you remove Unity?\n\n*Install GDM and remove lightdm - How do I switch from LightDM to GDM?\n\n*Install Default Applications - evolution , epiphany \n\n*Remove applications - consider removing Gwibber, Remmina, Firefox, and Thunderbird.\n\n*Other GNOME goodies - consider installing the gnome  package\n\n\nAs an aside - for the most part, the Ubuntu developers have been very conscious to not (as far as reasonably possible) to change the gnome-shell experience.  For example PrintScr in gnome-shell doesnt prompt you for the save location whereas in Unity it does.  Therefore - out-of-the-box Gnome-Shell in 12.04 Ubuntu is much closer to the Gnome 3 developers vision.\nBehind the scenes - Fedora contains elements such as SystemD which you will not have in Ubuntu (Upstart).\n\nA: Ubuntu does in fact squash GNOME's beautiful defaults.  It also offers up alternate defaults in place of \"GNOME Desktop\" applications (Firefox and Thunderbird, instead of Epiphany and Evolution, for example).  Meanwhile, Boxes (a new application introduced with 3.4) is nowhere to be found; a PPA existed briefly, but has since disappeared.  If those trade-offs are OK with you, following the steps below should get you a nice Debian-style GNOME 3.4 environment:\nFrom a terminal, issue this command to install GNOME Tweak Tool and the GNOME default font, \"Cantarell\":\n    sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool fonts-cantarell\n\nOpen System Settings > Appearance:\n\n\n*\n\n*Background:  Should be the first option (blue stripes, with clock icon).\n\n*Theme:  Adwaita\n\n\nLaunch the program named \"Advanced Settings\" (this is the GNOME Tweak Tool).\nOn the left, click \"Fonts\":\n\n\n*\n\n*Text scaling factor: 1.0\n\n*Default font: Cantarell | 11\n\n*Document font:  Sans | 11\n\n*Monospace font:  Monospace | 11\n\n*Window title font:  Cantarell Bold | 11\n\n*Hinting:  Medium\n\n*Antialiasing:  Grayscale\n\n\nOn the left, click \"Theme\":\n\n\n*\n\n*Window theme:  Adwaita\n\n*Cursor theme:  Adwaita\n\n*Icon theme:  Gnome\n\n*GTK+ theme:  Adwaita\n\n\n(these settings came from an untouched installation on Arch Linux I just did this afternoon)\nUbuntu absolutely squashes the default GNOME sound theme.  The drum sounds are completely out of place, I would at least switch to something else (Sonar seemed to be a good trade off).  You might be able to extract the original sounds from an archive and overwrite them, or better, create and import a new sound scheme.  I haven't looked into this. \nGNOME's default browser is packaged as \"epiphany-browser\", and a useful extension pack is packaged under the name \"epiphany-extensions\" (including an ad blocker that seemed to work well enough when I tested it).  Epiphany is a bit underdeveloped compared to Firefox or Chrome, but if you don't need all the extensions and addons, it's worth checking out simply for the cohesive desktop experience.\nI'll leave you to explore the rest of the default GNOME applications:  http://www.gnome.org/applications/\nI hope this information was helpful!\n\nA: You'll have to see if you can find a PPA, or you can make one yourself. If you want the most bleeding edge software, I don't think Ubuntu will ever be quite what you want. Particularly in LTS versions of Ubuntu, the focus is on stability, which means using more mature software. \nOf course, Ubuntu has never been a pure Gnome distro. It uses Firefox, for instance, instead of Epiphany, and it uses LibreOffice instead of Gnome Office, etc. I don't think that's going to change. \n\nA: Ubuntu-Gnome is Gnome with some Ubuntu features. As an official derivative since Saucy, it updates on the same timetable as Ubuntu. It boots even faster than Lubuntu which I had previously had installed on my old laptop with a 1.5gHZ processor and 1.5GB of RAM.\nMost other distros I've tried - including Mint I've tired of pretty quickly but Ubuntu Gnome has become my favourite: al least for now ;).\n\nA: If you would like to install many of the GNOME packages not available in the official Ubuntu repositories, you can add the official Ubuntu GNOME stable PPA, ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3, to your software sources by running sudo apt-add-repository ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3 in a terminal. Don't forget to run sudo apt-get update, sudo apt-get upgrade, sudo apt-get dist-upgrade, and sudo apt-get autoremove once you have added the PPA. \nEdit:\nCheck out https://wiki.gnome.org/Design/Apps/ for applications that you might want to install. \n", "Q: For MOTU packaging, to try or to install Ubuntu? When using testdrive for Precise release, do you \"install ubuntu\" or \"try ubuntu\"? \n\nA: Try ubuntu is live mode for ubuntu. You will get a full working ubuntu running from CD\\USB. \nInstall ubuntu is to start the procedure to install ubuntu on hard disk.\nLive mode is used to see whether all hardware / software functionality is working fine before any installation.

Frequently reinstalling Ubuntu solves my problem.\n\nA: boot with a live cd, run gparted and delete/format partition\n", "Q: Unable to enumerate USB device on port 2 when connecting Android phone I'm running Ubuntu 11.10 (64-bit) as a VirtualBox guest on a Win7 64-bit host.\nWhen I plug in my Android Epic4g (Galaxy S) both the host and guest see the device properly, however lsusb does not.\nWhen I run dmesg I get the following:\n[  361.664219] usb 1-2: new full speed USB device number 79 using ohci_hcd\n[  362.428798] hub 1-0:1.0: unable to enumerate USB device on port 2\n[  363.313782] hub 1-0:1.0: unable to enumerate USB device on port 2\n\nI get the same type of dmesg message with the USB 2.0 (ECHI) Controller enabled and disabled for the guest OS.\nI'm stuck with this one, can anyone help?\n\nA: ProfessionalAmateur, I solved my problem.

I'm trying to install Windows 7 with a 4GB flash drive, but my error that comes up is that my hard drive I'm trying to install on is in ext4. I need to format it to read NTFS. I can't seem to find any topics on how to format an active hard drive. I found a topic that explains how to move Ubuntu to a new drive, but it's a bit confusing to me.\n\nA: So, I assume you are trying to format with ubuntu, and not wanting to keep ubuntu, so the best thing to do is to boot up to a live cd of ubuntu(most likely the disk you used to install ubuntu, if not Ubuntu download) and use gparted off the live cd, using gparted video, because you can't format the active partition while using it. Just keep in mind that formating the partition will get rid of ubuntu and all your data\n", "Q: No Items show in dash of gnome-shell when using \"Axiom\" Theme? I am using the awesome Axiom Gnome-Shell theme from Deviantart.\nThe theme works perfectly except for one issue, no items show up in the dash?\nThe actual items are there, e.g. if I type in something I know exists and then press enter it opens the program, there are simply no icons visible.\nWhy is this?\n\nYet after some more playing I have discovered some other funkyness, for example, if a lot of items are returned by the search you get:\n\n\nA: There have been a lot of changes going on in Gtk3.  I don't know when you downloaded the theme, or what version of gnome-shell you are using, but this is almost certainly the result of those changes, particularly in styling.  You can hack around the css style sheet for the theme you downloaded or you can wait for the artist to update (or you to update depending).  From the website posted the artist updated 3/31 to support for gnome-shell 3.4.  From the looks of it you are still in gnome-shell 3.2 and this is probably the reason.  The relevant section of the gnome-shell.css sheet should be under Overview Apps, that being said it may be easiest to contact the Artist and ask if s/he has the old version.  I have a great 3.2 theme that is screwed up in the app overview in 3.4.\n", "Q: Flash plugin not working I am using 11.10 on an old intel mac. I have trouble viewing flash videos, and even after installing the plugin I cannot see them on either browser (FF/Chrome). On Chrome, it seems the shockwave flash does not exist in \"about:plugins\". So how can I get it in my system?\n\nA: Open a terminal (Ctrl +Alt + T) and run the command sudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer. This will download and install flash. As a temporary solution until you fix the problem if this does not work, you can enable the YouTube HTML5 player by going to www.YouTube.com/html5 and enabling the option.

Whatever I do, I didn't manage to get rid of letter paper size - eventually here and there I stumble upon letter as a hidden default, and that spoils my prints.\nHow can I select and use English as my language, but use metric system everywhere and a4 paper size everywhere, and Russian regional settings (date, time, decimal etc).\n\nA: If you execute locale you can see the language variables that are used for various sections of the operating system:\nLANG=en_US.UTF-8\nLANGUAGE=en_US\nLC_CTYPE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_NUMERIC=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_TIME=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_COLLATE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_MONETARY=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_MESSAGES=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_PAPER=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_NAME=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_ADDRESS=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_TELEPHONE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_MEASUREMENT=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_IDENTIFICATION=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_ALL=\n\nMore about locale variables in the gettext manual: Locale Environment Variables - GNU `gettext' utilities\nYou can export these variables e.g. export LC_PAPER=\"ru_RU.UTF-8\" - this will make a temporary change.\nIf you want to make it permanent you can change the regional formats using gnome-language-selector. Or you can add the export command in ~/.profile and/or ~/.bashrc\nFor the papersize, I found that you can edit /etc/papersize - change \"letter\" to \"a4\".\nYou might also need to set export LC_PAPER=\"en_GB.UTF_8\" (or maybe export LC_PAPER=\"ru_RU.UTF_8\" if ru_RU defaults to A4)\nSource: answers.launchpad.net: Question #6846 : Questions : “evince” package : Ubuntu\nP.S.

Recently I updated my linux kernel from 3.0.0-17 to 3.0.0-18. And now chromium keeps giving me a segmentation fault and so does ubuntu-bug and even nautilus. Now I want to downgrade back to 3.0.0-17 until the bug is fixed. So how do I do that?\nI run ubuntu11.10 32-bit.\n\nA: If you recently installed a new kernel your old kernel should still be installed as well.  You should be able to interrupt the boot and select a previous kernel from the bootloader menu; for grub (the default bootloader on standard PC systems) hold SHIFT as the BIOS finishes and then select Previous Kernels and pick a known good kernel from there.\n\nA: Are you sure that its due to kernel upgrade ?

Aim of most projects in dual graphics card is to turn off nvidia gpu and use it when required using a special command.(like optirun).\nUse the bumblebee project (its a fork from bumblebee project by Mrmee. The whole code was rewritten in C for more stability) to install and turn off nvidia card and use it when required.\nAlternatively you can use the original package by MrMee - ironhide .But this is no longer maintained and it caused too many problem earlier for me. \nI own a dell xps l502 , nvidia gt 540m with optimus.

Per my comment, this is pretty hacky, but should get the job done.\nIn your check script, return a specific PAM error code (probably PAM_SYSTEM_ERR), then use control statements in your common-auth file like so:\nauth    required                        pam_group.so use_first_pass\nauth    [success=ok default=1]          pam_exec.so /etc/security/check_ecryptfs\nauth    [success=2 default=ignore]      pam_krb5.so minimum_uid=1000 try_first_pass\nauth    [success=1 default=ignore]      pam_unix.so nullok_secure try_first_pass\n\nThe control statements for the pam_exec module should cause PAM to go to the next module (pam_krb5) on success, and skip to pam_unix if pam_exe returns any other return code.

That is what some antivirus do (2). \n3) You could copy your MBR to a file with something like sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=mbr.bin bs=512 count=1 then check the file, which is a binary, with an Hex Editor like Bless.\n\nA: Yes, most viruses / malware actually target Windows/Intel ('Wintel').\nSo many of the Ubuntu AV solutions mostly look for (and find) Wintel malware.\n", "Q: Getting headphone to work on 2011 Imac 27\" I just installed Ubuntu 12.04 on my Imac and it works flawlessly apart from the fact that I don't get sound from my headphone jack.\nThe sounds works fine on the speaker.\nDoes anyone have any pointers ?\n\nA: Try this, it doesn't work for me, but it does work for some people:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf\n\n*Append options snd-hda-intel model=imac27_122 to the file\n\n*Reboot\n\n", "Q: /etc/hosts modification does not work properly. What to do? I have added these lines to the hosts file: \n127.0.0.1 localhost adobe.com\n127.0.0.1 adobe.com\n\nIt works perfectly on windows. But in Ubuntu 11.10 when I try to access it using Firefox the website is opening.\nGoogle chrome though supporting /etc/hosts configuration.\nGoogle chrome is displaying:\n\n\"It works! This is the default web page for this server. The web\n  server software is running but no content has been added, yet.\"\n\n\nA: I know that this thread is a year old, but I stumbled upon it searching for the answers to the very same problem. I finally found a solution! Turns out that the /etc/hosts file is being completely bypassed by DNS. To change this, you have to edit the /etc/nsswitch.conf and include files under hosts. Example below:\npasswd:         compat\ngroup:          compat\nshadow:         compat\n\nhosts:          dns files myhostname <-- this line here.\nnetworks:       files\n\nprotocols:      db files\nservices:       db files\nethers:         db files\nrpc:            db files\n\nnetgroup:       nis\n\nThis will make sure that /etc/hosts file is included in the name resolution check. It will first check DNS and then the hosts file. I'm sure OP no longer needs this info, but this is still good for anyone seeking answers to this problem.\nYou must also restart in order for this to take into effect\n\nA: I believe etc/hosts is used on much lover level in the networking software stack than the browser itself. I.e. changes in that file should affect any browser.\nWhat you're seeing may be a result of Firefox caching DNS entries - i.e. you opened the website in Firefox, Firefox remembers the IP address corresponding to adobe.com domain, you modified /etc/hosts and reloaded the page - Firefox does not issue a new DNS query and uses the cached data instead. Then you open Chrome, it makes a new DNS query and uses whatever you entered in /etc/hosts as the IP address for adobe.com\nRestarting Firefox should fix the problem.\n\nA: All the answers are great, but the shortest way to fixing it is:\nafter modifying /etc/hosts (and possibly restarting Firefox), reload the problematic tab with Ctrl+Shift+R. It will bypass any type of cache Firefox may have.\n\nA: I can confirm your problem that it appears to affect, between both, Chrome and Firefox, only Firefox. This is an answer for users that are affected by the same problem and if they are affected by both/all browsers. Follow this steps to have this working correctly. Assuming you already edited /etc/hosts file to which I recommend the following 2 ways to edit the file:\n\n\n*\n\n*Gedit - gksudo gedit /etc/hosts (You now have a GUI friendly way of editing the file. gksu which provides gksudo is discontinued in the official 18.04 and later repositories.)  \n\n*nano - sudo nano /etc/hosts (You now have a terminal friendly way of editing the file.)\n\n\nAnd you have for example:\n127.0.0.1 localhost adobe.com\n\nor\n127.0.0.1 localhost\n127.0.0.1 adobe.com\n\n(Both are the same thing.)\nYou first test this out to see if it is working correctly from the terminal. Type ping adobe.com and it should respond from the IP assign to it. In this case it should respond with 127.0.0.1. That means it is OK.\nThen we continue with the browser tests.  You tested Chrome and it worked. You changed /etc/hosts between having and not having the entry for adobe.com and it worked every time you changed it. But then you went with Firefox, it might have worked the first time, but after changing hosts file back and forth it somehow stop working. This means it is a cache problem or a problem resolving the correct name.\nIn the case of Firefox and resolving the name, Firefox adds the the prefix www to the adobe website so it looks like this \"www.adobe.com\" but on Chrome it looks like this \"adobe.com\". They both point to the same place and the www prefix is just there to tell you that the place you are visiting is a web service. But in the case of your problem you would need to add that to the hosts file so when Firefox adds the prefix www it works. So it would look like this:\n127.0.0.1 localhost\n127.0.0.1 adobe.com www.adobe.com\n\nOR just the same\n127.0.0.1 localhost adobe.com www.adobe.com\n\nNOTE: Remember that you HAVE TO press F5 to refresh the site/Firefox tab or close the tab and open it again to test. Somehow pressing Enter like crazy won't do.\nThis should solve the problem for some users, but assuming up to now you still have not yet solved the problem, we can test out what could it be.\nWe got here a couple of levels of cache to check then. You got your program Cache, in this case Firefox, then you have your System Cache, in this case Ubuntu, and then you have your hardware cache, in this case your router.\nFor what I know, the Ubuntu Desktop version does not have a DNS cache service installed by default. The most commonly known is nscd and if you had that installed a simple /etc/init.d/nscd restart will do. But for most people they will not have this installed, so we can overrule the Ubuntu system's fault.\nThat leaves the router and web browser. In the case of the router you would have to configure it to stop DNS cache or reconfigure it to solve this issue. This totally depends on the Router model, manufacturer, etc. Not all routers do DNS cache, but some do and you would need to see in the configuration of it, if it has this option and if the option is enabled. But let us assume you do not have a DNS Caching enabled router.\nThis leaves the browser.\nTo find out if Firefox is being bad with DNS Cache you can install an Add-on to check DNS Cache in Firefox. the one I recommend is DNS Cache.\n\nAfter restarting Firefox you should see a cog in the bottom (Similar to the Ubuntu cog in the upper right corner). You can left-click or right-click the Cog and you should see options like Enable/Disable DNS and Flush it. This will help in the case of the problem being the Firefox DNS Cache. Play with it.\nI think I got all the ways you could solve that. If I missed something, let me know.\n\nA: Could you try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit /etc/hosts file.\n\n*Add next lines\n # /etc/hosts\n 127.0.0.1  localhost\n 127.0.1.1  myhost01\n 127.0.1.2  myhost02\n\n\nA: in Ubuntu 14.04 changing /etc/hosts file to only have one host per line worked for me, i struggled for hours working with a IP host host host, than changed to IP host on each line and it worked >.<\n\nA: I had this same issue on various versions of Ubuntu. The latest one reared its ugly head on 17.04 and 16.04. I found that I had to format the hosts file like this:\n127.0.0.1   localhost\n127.0.0.1   www.facebook.com facebook.com\nie you need to put in the url both the www and then again without. I have no idea why this works. Simply save the file and then ping the url as in:\nping www.facebook.com\nand it should resolve to the loopback address or any other address that you want.eg:\n80.82.xxx.xxx   www.example.com example.com\nWorked for me.\n", "Q: Flash 11.2.202.228 audio choppy/stutters The other day my system was upgraded to using Flash 11.2.202.228.\nSince then I have had a slight \"stutter\" or \"choppy\" audio on playbacks. I would guess it is a buffer under run problem.\nAnyone knows what has happened with the new flash-release?\n\nA: well, it seems like there is a bug in Flash version 11.2.202.228.

The messages are consistently showing up for a few of the files in that directory, but not all.  I haven't even looked at those files or done anything else with them in a long time!

I hope someone can explain these spooky messages!\n\nA: It turns out the messages come from AppArmor, a \"security module for the Linux kernel\" which I never knew about before.  I'm still not quite sure why it gives me those messages, but it happens whenever I try to save a screenprint (I use the Shooter Firefox add-on) to the /shr directory.  Firefox doesn't let me, and pops up a Download Error window (\"because you cannot change the contents of that folder\") which I never really paid attention to.  I figured it was a permissions thing which I never bothered to look at or change since I was always satisfied with saving my screen print to another directory.\nAnyways, I was able to test this and duplicate the messages.  By the way, I was wrong when I wrote that there were only a few files that were being reported on; actually I missed the fact that there were all these lines like __ratelimit: 96 callbacks suppressed which means that there were more messages that the system withheld from the messages file.\nI still don't know the why AppArmor felt the need to report on every file in that directory...\n", "Q: How to load unity-launcher in standalone session? I want to auto-start unity-launcher in a stand alone session without loading the top panel with it, like in this picture:\n\nSo how to do this?\n\nA: That setup is actually using the Unity 2D launcher. The Unity launcher and top panel are tied together in a Compiz plugin and can not be used separately. Luckily, the 2D launcher aims to be nearly identical to the normal one.\nIn order to use the Unity 2D launcher with a different panel, you need to create a custom session which you will load a login time.\nFirst you need to create a desktop file that LightDM will read. Open your new file with a terminal using:\ngksu gedit /usr/share/xsessions/custom-session.desktop\n\nThen add this text:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Custom Session\nComment=This is my custom desktop\nExec=/usr/local/bin/custom-session\nType=Application\n\nThis will add a new login option to the login screen.

I had a lot of unpartitioned space left on the drive and was reserving it for adding other OSes and for storing files there in the future.\nOne day I went ahead and downloaded Partition Wizard and created a logical NTFS partition from within Windows 7, still some unpartitioned space left over. Everything worked fine, until I rebooted the computer a few days later.\nNow I'm getting:  \nerror: unknown filesystem.  \ngrub rescue>\n\nFirst of all I was surprised not to find any kind of help command, by trying:  \nhelp, ?, man, --help, -h, bash, cmd, etc.\nNow I'm stuck with non-bootable system. I have started researching the issue and finding that people usually recommend to boot to a Live CD and fix the issue from there. Is there a way to fix this issue from within grub rescue without the need for Live CD?\nUPDATE\nBy following the steps from Persist commands typed to GRUB rescue, I was able to boot to initramfs prompt. But not anywhere further than that.\nSo far from reading the manual on grub rescue, I was able to see my drives and partitions using ls command. For the first hard drive I see the following:\n(hd0) (hd0,msdos6) (hd0,msdos5) (hd0,msdos2) (hd0,msdos1)\nI now know that (hd0,msdos6) contains Linux on it, since ls (hd0,msdos6)/ lists directories.

I still get the grub rescue prompt. What do I need to do to permanently fix it?\nI have also learned that drive numbers as in hd0 need to be translated to drive letters as in /dev/sda for some commands. hd1 would be sdb, hd2 would be sdc, and so on. Partitions listed in grub as (hd0,msdos6) would be translated to /dev/sda6.\nUPDATE 5\nI could not figure out why the following did not fix grub:\nsudo update-grub\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\nSo I downloaded boot-repair based on an answer from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair post.

Example: If the Ubuntu system is on sda5, enter:  set prefix=(hd0,5)/boot/grub\n\n*set root=(hdX,Y). Example: set root=(hd0,5)\n\n*insmod normal. Attempt to load the normal module.\n\n*normal\nWe basically need GRUB to know where the /boot/grub folder is. If this is not working, I guess doing a GRUB install from a boot CD is a good option.\n\nA: There is an alternative cause of this problem. In this particular case, GRUB was somehow corrupted and needed to be repaired or reinstalled. However, as shown in Grub rescue fails with \"Boot Repair\" with error \"unknown file system\", it's also possible that the root partition on which GRUB is installed could be corrupted. To fix this:\nThis is a possible solution, but it should not be used likely lest your root partition become further corrupted. Running the command fsck -t ext4 /dev/sda1, this program attempts to search and repair errors on a corrupted filesystem. Replace sda1 with your actual root partition. Replace ext4 with the actual filesystem; you have to know the file system or else the partition will be more corrupted. See Repairing a corrupted filesystem for more information.\n\nEven though this question has an answer, there is an alternative way to fix the problem that worked for me. The steps are explained in the painful video Grub Rescue - Guide for beginners. In short, it will reinstall GRUB 2 altogether instead of repairing it.\nBecause this video is so painful to watch, I'll list the steps below (as I should regardless of how painful it is to watch the video)\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch a live session of Ubuntu. The video uses a live CD whereas I used a live USB. I made sure that the live USB had the same version of Ubuntu that I had on my harddrive.\n\n*Find where your root partition was mounted. In the video, the user uses Nautilus to navigate through each drive that was mounted. It was mounted with a long string of numbers and characters. If this is the case, follow the following steps to remount the partition. Else, proceed to step 5.\n\n*Bring up the terminal with Ctrl + Alt + T and use the mount command to find the name of the partition.\n\n*Mount the partition. Create a new folder in your media folder. sudo mkdir /media/ubuntu. Then simply mount your partition to that folder. sudo mount /dev/sdxx /media/ubuntu where xx of sdxx is determined in step 3.\n\n*Bind the following directories from the root directory of your live CD/USB to that of your root directory on your version of Ubuntu. The directories are the dev proc and sys. Do so with the following commands:\nsudo mount --bind /dev /media/ubuntu/dev\nsudo mount --bind /sys /media/ubuntu/sys\nsudo mount --bind /proc /media/ubuntu/proc\n\n\n*Change the root directory to the one on your Ubuntu partition. sudo chroot /media/ubuntu/\n\n*Having done the above, installing GRUB 2 again will install it to the root directory of your distribution of Ubuntu and not that of the live CD/USB's. So go ahead and run sudo grub-install /dev/sdx\nAnd that's how to fix GRUB using a live CD/USB. This method was developed by YouTube user crazytechzone.\n\nA: Funny, I also had the same problem an hour ago!\nAnyway, this is what I did.\n\n\n*\n\n*Load ubuntu:\nset root=(hd0,6)\nset prefix=(hd0,6)/boot/grub\ninsmod normal\nnormal\n\nsince your ubuntu is installed in 6 right?\n\n*run terminal:\nsudo -i *to access root*\ngrub-install --root-directory=/mnt/ /dev/sda\nsudo update-grub\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\n\nA: I could not figure out why the following did not fix grub: \nsudo update-grub\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\nSo I downloaded boot-repair based on an answer from Persist commands typed to GRUB rescue post. That seemed to do the trick after I picked the \"Recommended Repair (repairs most frequent problems)\" option.\nI have also used Grub Customizer to customize the order of boot entries.\n\nA: Install Boot-Repair in Ubuntu\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot your computer on a Ubuntu live-CD or live-USB.\n\n*Choose \"Try Ubuntu\"\n\n*Connect internet\n\n*Open a new Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T), then type:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\n\n\n*Press Enter.\n\n*Then type:\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\n\n*Press Enter. \nUsing Boot-Repair\n\nRecommended repair\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Boot-Repair from either :\na. The Dash (the Ubuntu logo at the top-left of the screen)\nb. Or System->Administration->Boot-Repair menu (Ubuntu 10.04 only)\nc. Or by typing 'boot-repair' in a terminal \n\n*Then click the \"Recommended repair\" button. When repair is finished, note the URL (paste.ubuntu.com/XXXXX) that appeared on a paper, then reboot and check if you recovered access to your OSs.\n\n*If the repair did not succeed, indicate the URL to people who help you by email or forum.\n\nA: Another cause of the problem is that the filesystem on the boot drive may be crashed in rare cases. As mentioned in other answers, I initially use the ls command to list all drives/partitions in the GRUB rescue prompt, but all report unknown filesystem error. I finally fixed the problem on Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial Xerus) by recovering the filesystem as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from a USB stick (try Ubuntu without installing)\n\n*Find the boot drive (check the drive capacity or do the fsck on each partition):\nsudo fdisk -l\n\n\n*Recover the file system:\nsudo fsck /dev/sdb1\n\n\n*After the file system is fixed and clean, reboot the machine from the boot drive.\n", "Q: What can I do to turn my screen brightness down when simple interface methods do not work?

If you want something in Java that really looks native, SWT is your best option. Eclipse's WindowBuilder supports it will too. You're clearly misunderstanding what you need to ship with your application. You don't have to ship Eclipse, just the SWT jars. Unless you application is really simple, it's likely that you'll have to depend on 3rd party jars at one point or another (or ship your own anyway).\nThe main difference with Swing is that you need to ship the right SWT jar for the right platform (e.g. x86_64).

How may I do this?\n\nA: As an alternative to the venerable but complicated method of manually editing configuration files, unless you need to extensively customize who can access the share, you can simply:\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate in Nautilus (the file browser) to the mount point of the drive you want to share (e.g., /media/MyDrive).\n\n*Go up to the parent directory (in this example, /media).\n\n*Right-click on the drive name (MyDrive), and click Sharing Options.\n \nAs you can see, enabling guest access is as simple as checking the box for it.\n\nNautilus might tell you that you have to install some packages to\n  share a folder. This will happen if Samba and its dependencies are not\n  already installed. You can say yes to this. After installation, you\n  may have to log out and back in (rebooting also works but is not\n  necessary). Then go back to Sharing Options. Now that the necessary\n  packages are installed, you can share the folder.\n\nThis method works for sharing statically mounted volumes (like yours), dynamically mounted volumes, or any folder.\n\nA: Essentially, you will want to create a Samba share for the Ext4 mount point.  Open-up  your /etc/samba/smb.conf (in your favorite editor) and alter a few things:\n1 - workgroup - you'll want to set that to the name of your network workgroup, if you have one.\n2 - security = user - even if this line is commented-out, user-level security is the default for Samba.\n3 - Define your Samba share at the bottom of the file.  You should see a (commented-out) example at the bottom.  You'll need the mount point of your ext4 partition (that you want to share).  If you're not sure of what that is, do a \"df -k\" from terminal, and you should see it (put it in the \"path\" setting instead of \"/some/directory\").\n[ShareName]\npath = /some/directory\nbrowsable = yes\nvalid users = myUser, user2, user3\n\n4 - Next, you'll need to alter the permissions on the path (mount point) to ensure that the desired users can accomplish what they need to.\n5 - Restart Samba\nsudo restart smbd\nsudo restart nmbd\n\n6 - Connect to your Samba share from your Mac.  I found instructions on that here.  Essentially, it says:\n\nWhen you go to the Connect to Server dialog, you may browse the names\n  of computers that are on your local subnet.\nYou can connect to a\n  server via its IP address or DNS name. If it is required or more\n  convenient in your environment, you may also use other valid URL\n  formats, such as:\nsmb://ServerName/ShareName\n\n\nFor me, I connect to my Samba shares by IP:\nsmb://192.168.0.117/ShareName\n\nFor troubleshooting, check the doc that I referenced: \nMac OS X: How to connect to Windows File Sharing (SMB)\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: touchpad pointer moves randomly upon release I've just installed 11.10.\nI then updated my install.\nNow, whenever I move the pointer via the touchpad it jumps around upon release.\nIt is totally unusable and i'm using a mouse which is fine.\nI have a Sony Vaio VPCE82Z0E.\nEverything else is working perfectly, any help is appreciated.\n\nA: In dash , search for touchpad, a window opens.

Included were the new Linux kernal and a whole mess of xorg stuff so I did a sudo apt-get dist-upgrade.  The kernal is 3.0.0-17-generic.\nAfter reboot, the touchpad behaved differently.  It is much more sensitive and the pointer is much more difficult to control on the screen.

I assumed it would be a simple task of plugging in an external monitor and everything would be fine, but i cannot use tty7, all others work fine, i can login to it and vim and nano stuff as i would normally, but i am unable to use my desktop. Is there any way of re-configuring x (i assume x is the problem, but i really have no idea) so that it works over HDMI? or even VGA at this point... \nEDIT:\nAvoided fixing it with a new screen, but would still like to know how it can be done in the future\n\nA: Normally you could configure the new monitor with the Displays control panel, but since you can't see the desktop there's a \"chicken and egg problem\".\nThe xrandr command can be helpful in this case. It can do whatever the Displays control panel can do and can be run from tty1.\nTypically X has started on display :0. You can run ps aux | grep X to check this. Mine starts with /usr/bin/X  :0\nEnter the command xrandr -d :0 and you should see names and information for both displays.\nIf the display you need to turn on is VGA-0, for example, you could then try:\nxrandr -d :0 --output VGA-0 --auto\nYou could also set the resolution you need using the same command.\n", "Q: ext4 jbd2 journaling active even on empty filesystem I have been having several issues with my ext4 file-systems that seem to be due to jbd2 journaling. I made a related post here and am rephrasing it with the hope that someone may be able to help.\nFor a minimal example, I start with an empty 8gb USB stick and use gparted to create one ext4 partition. The command used by gparted when creating the ext4 file system is:\nmkfs.ext4 -j -O extent -L DataTraveler8gb /dev/sde1\n\nI check the file-system with gparted:\ne2fsck -f -y -v /dev/sde1\n\nand I mount it:\nsudo mount /dev/sde1 /media/test\n\nThe disk is empty, but the journaling is very active on this disk (/dev/sde1). The other disks are ext4 SSDs formatted similarly. A snapshot of iotop:\n% sudo iotop -oPa\n\nTotal DISK READ: 0.00 B/s | Total DISK WRITE: 2027.21 K/s\n  PID  PRIO  USER     DISK READ  DISK WRITE  SWAPIN      IO    COMMAND\n  262 be/3 root          0.00 B     56.00 K  0.00 %  0.18 % [jbd2/sda1-8]\n29069 be/3 root          0.00 B      0.00 B  0.00 %  0.16 % [jbd2/sde1-8]\n  891 be/3 root          0.00 B      4.00 K  0.00 %  0.03 % [jbd2/sdc1-8]\n\nWhat is jbd2 doing with /dev/sde1?\nIf I follow the same steps with a larger 2Tb disk, iotop indicates this empty disk is constantly being written to by jbd2 at the rate of Mb/s as soon as I mount it.\nOn the other disks, which have the OS and /home, I have tried to find if any files are being modified by processes to cause this behavior but couldn't find any. I also moved many of the disk intensive process to use a tmpfs. And used noatime.\nI have another non-SSD hard disk on this machine, /dev/sdb, that is also ext4 but was not formatted by gparted (given to me by a coworker). It does not appear in iotop. So I am assuming there an issue with gparted.\nAny suggestions are appreciated. Also any tips on how to modify existing partitions to fix the issue without having to start from scratch would be great.\nThere are some posts related to jbd2 but they didn't help (eg. here).\n\nA: It seems that ext4 does its 'quick format' by postposting a lot of its initialisation until it is mounted (the uninit_bg option, perhaps?) and I suspect that jbd2 is doing this after you first format the drive. One of the comments here suggested that jbd2 writes to the partition after creation for a time proportional to its size, and suggested 10 minutes per 200 GB, which would indicate 50 minutes per TB. I formatted a 3TB ext4 drive yesterday and jbd2 was writing away for ages, but it has now stopped.\nbtrfs doesn't do this, btw, but I don't trust it yet for external drives - eg you need a recent kernel (3.4+, I think) or the kernel will oops (and possibly lose data) if you remove the drive without unmounting it first (which of course happens if it loses power).\n", "Q: Remote ssh configuration problem My basic problem is that I would like to launch graphical application (eg firefox) on a remote computer (at work) from my computer at home. The computer at work (WPC) is behind a firewall. So I'm using SSH to remotely connect to it, in text mode.\nThe actual configuration I use is the following :\nI have the Linux PC at work WPC\nI have a network drive at home NWD\nI have my Linux PC at home HPC\nOn WPC, I launch \" ssh -R 23000:localhost:22 user@NWD \"\nWhen I am at home, I first connect from HPC to NWD via ssh : \"ssh user@NWD\", and then, from NWD to WPC via \"ssh -p 23000 localhost\"\nThat is working perfectly, but there is no X server on the network drive (NWD). So I cannot cascade two ssh -X connection.\nThus, I was thinking that I may connect directly from HPC to the 23000 port of NWD ? like that (from HPC) \"ssh -X -p 23000 user@NWD\", but then i got a connection refused. \nThe first question is do you think this could work (without an X server on NWD) ?\nand if yes, How do I configure the sshd on NWD to allow access on port 23000 to other computers than just itself ?\nHope it is not too confuse\nThanks for your help\nJulien\n\nA: As the explanation of -R in ssh(1) suggests, on NWD set GatewayPorts yes in /etc/ssh/sshd_config. Then connect with:\nssh -R 192.168.0.1:23000:localhost:22 user@NWD\n\nwhere 192.168.0.1 is NWD's local ip address. That should allow you to do\nssh -X -p 23000 192.168.0.1\n\nfrom any of the computers on that subnet.\n", "Q: How to completely remove Ubuntu? I installed Ubuntu using Wubi installer, but I couldnt boot to it. So I uninstalled it on the Control Panel. Then I tried the full installation wherein it boots to the Ubuntu environment. After installing Ubuntu there, I couldnt boot to my Windows 7 anymore! So in an attempt to salvage the whole thing, I inserted the Ubuntu CD again and chose Erase Ubuntu and Reinstall. (I was wondering, why wasn't there an option to just \"Erase Ubuntu\"?) I did that though, and I got my Windows 7 back. But upon checking my drives via the \"Create your own partition scheme\" (not sure if it's the exact words) I saw that one of my partitions still has Ubuntu on it, and there's no way I can delete it if I don't overwrite another Ubuntu! I can't access that partition on windows 7 either! Need help! \n\nA: I think your problem is only about the partition. Linux use ext2/3 file system and Windows doesn't support that file system, so normally you cannot see the drive which format in ext2/3 on Windows. My suggestion here is you can use PartitionMagic (or any tool works with partition), erase that drive and merge it to another fat32/ntfs drive, so you can retrieve it completely\n", "Q: Ubuntu USB Expert Install - Grub2 installs on USB I used Unetbootin and Installed the mini.iso over to my USB.

You can \"fake it\" by editing the /etc/hosts files on all the machines to be correct if you haven't set up orchestra's built in dnsmasq server to do DHCP and DNS, which is the simplest method, but requires a dedicated network for your managed machines (since it would fight with an existing DHCP server).\n", "Q: How do I install Ubuntu on a new partition?

I would like to copy that second partition to another physical hard drive (which is empty).\nThere's a catch however - I cannot have both hard drives physically connected to the computer at the same time.

So for example, staying in 10.04 with the 3.3 Kernel version.\nWhen having an older or present Ubuntu version, many users want to apply the newer stable/unstable kernel version to the Ubuntu version they are using thinking that it is similar to upgrading a program. So what I am looking for, are some simple answers to explain the dangers (that are pretty much bigger than the advantages) of forcing a newer kernel version in a Ubuntu release that was not meant for it.\nWhat can I tell them or explain to them of why they should NOT update to a newer/older kernel when having an Ubuntu version that was not made for that kernel version.\n\nA: Applications (/drivers) use kernel to communicate with hardwares. Kernel exposes APIs/functions for the application to do so. With changes  of kernel those functions/APIs got changed often. These new functions may need some extra/less information (say new parameters). So when an application calls that function in older fashion it will cause crash to system. \n-- This is my understanding. \n\nA: I get your point but also share your friends preference to have a more recent kernel. Personally, I'm running a mainline kernel on Ubuntu 11.10 (built using the sources from kernel.org). This means that I'm responsible for security updates and that I won't have support from Ubuntu because I'm not running the stock kernel.\nUsually, when the question whether to upgrade a kernel or not is raised, the answer would be \"improvements to stability / security / hardware support\". Now, your question seems to be about whole kernel series. Risks of using older kernel versions are pretty clear: unfixed security issues, less hardware support and other bugs that may affect stability or features.\nWhen using an older kernel series than the Ubuntu version was created for (say 2.6.32 where Oneiric ships with 3.0) has other implications:\n\n\n*\n\n*userspace programs that expect features that are only available in newer kernel versions. For example, solid-state disks support a TRIM parameter. Even if the mount program supports mounting programs with the discard option to enable TRIM, if the kernel has no support for it, it won't work. Now, this would then print an error about the unsupported kernel, but there could be another feature that is more important and assumed to exist by Ubuntu. The graphics stack, Xorg, depends strongly on features provided by the kernel. If the kernel is very ancient, the Xorg stack may not be able to fully utilize its features.\n\n\nNewer kernel series can be gathered in various ways: user-maintained PPAs, kernel.ubuntu.com or directly from ubuntu+1's repositories on packages.ubuntu.com. A possible effect is that APIs have been changed, or otherwise, \"default\" behavior of certain parts. This could not be that disastrous, but programs that make strong assumptions about defaults may not work as expected. Example: relatime replacing noatime as default. More serious issues would be regressions that break hardware (wireless is a common nightmare). The stock Ubuntu kernels have been tested for hardware and when released, it's supposed to be the best kernel for most Ubuntu users.\nNew support for some features / hardware is not always good either. If a program or script expects that support for (...) is broken and therefore introduces a workaround for it, it may be incompatible with each other and break both. For example, Bumblebee+bbswitch currently disable the nvidia card. If a newer kernel version suddenly has excellent support for this hybrid graphics hardware, it may cause crashes.\nI started with installing a newer kernel after the one from xorg-edgers broke my wireless and did not fully support my nvidia card with the nouveau kernel module. Wireless worked again and nouveau support was better, but a later upgrade made wireless unreliable again. And another later version solved it again. Well if you wish to live on the edge you have to live with that.\n\nA: Drivers may not be compatible with newer kernel. Even some programs may not function properly.Also the proprietory drivers for that version of Ubuntu are built for default kernel for that version.\n", "Q: Can my Radeon X1600 graphics card run 3d games on 11.10 I have a PC with Ubuntu 11.10 and an Intel core2 duo processor. I love Ubuntu but have one big issue,which is in my question.\nMy Radeon X1600 graphics card wont run any form of 3d, games,unity 3d,nothing. \nIt worked fine with my old OS (Windows Xp) so I think it must be the drivers. Does anyone know how to enable 3D for this card or install a driver that will run 3D. \nI am new to Ubuntu, so clear and simple explanations please with as little jargon as possible.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 11.10 (and any other recent distribution that uses an updated kernel) you can only use the open source drivers, and those are already included and activated when you install Ubuntu.\nTo use an old version of the Catalyst fglrx drivers you need to be running a 2.6.28 kernel or lower. You cannot do that using Ubuntu 11.10.\nThere is not much you can do about drivers with your card. The open source drivers should be enough and suffice to run most of the actual software that it can run without suffering performance issues.\nIt's an old card, it will be hard to make it run any recent advanced 3D software, with or with out proprietary drivers.\n", "Q: ALPS touchpad on DELL Inspiron I15RN-3647BK with Ubuntu 11.10 x64 I can't make work the multitouch of the ALPS touchpad in my Dell Inspiron I15RN-3647BK with Ubuntu 11.10 x64, kernel 3.0.0-17-generic...

Same principle goes for SATA II and SATA I.\n\nA: So the desktops use 3.5\" format,\nSpindle speed and buffer size are important, i recommend 7200 (or more, but those get costly)\nAlso look at how much size you want, over 150GB is good to start, some can make do with less, but for storing music and movies the more the merrier. So I would recommend a good 300-500 GB drive. I like Seagate for drives, they have a great warranty program, where you can check warranty status ( http://www.seagate.com/www/en-us/support/warranty_%26_returns_assistance ) and they let you ship back the drive for a replacement (if faulty) directly. They drives are the ones that have parallel bit technology, so the cost is less when you compare sizes directly with the competitors. \nThis is a nice one\nhttp://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=744346&CatId=2459\nthis is a bit more conservative, less cost\nhttp://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=143901&CatId=2457\n", "Q: Is it possible to set Transmission to show list of files as collapsed by default?

I am affected by the BUG: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity-greeter/+bug/874241\nOtherwise, if like me you have a laptop connected to a second monitor of higher resolution, LIGHTDM at the login stage, mirrors the displays in both screens and assign to them a common resolution (1024X768) in my case, instead of extending the desktop (Primary screen with the greeter and secondary with just a logo as mentioned in the Multiple Monitors UX specifications book for 12.04).\nHere is my xrandr -q\n@L502X:~$ xrandr -q\nScreen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1920 x 1848, maximum 8192 x 8192\nLVDS1 connected 1366x768+309+1080 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 344mm x 193mm\n   1366x768       60.0*+\n   1360x768       59.8     60.0  \n   1024x768       60.0  \n   800x600        60.3     56.2  \n   640x480        59.9  \nVGA1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nHDMI1 connected 1920x1080+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 510mm x 287mm\n   1920x1080      60.0*+\n   1600x1200      60.0  \n   1680x1050      60.0  \n   1280x1024      60.0  \n   1440x900       59.9  \n   1280x960       60.0  \n   1280x800       59.8  \n   1024x768       60.0  \n   800x600        60.3     56.2  \n   640x480        60.0  \nDP1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\n\nI tried to force lightdm to execute some xrandr commands in order to set the right resolution for each monitor and extend the desktop, so I created a simple script named /usr/share/lightdmxrand.sh:\n#!/bin/sh\nxrandr --output HDMI1 --primary --mode 1920x1080 --output LVDS1 --mode 1366x768 --below HDMI1\n\nAnd told lightdm to run it :  /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\n[SeatDefaults]\ngreeter-session=unity-greeter\nuser-session=ubuntu\ngreeter-setup-script=/usr/bin/numlockx on\ndisplay-setup-script=/usr/share/lightdmxrandr.sh\n\nrestarted lightdm :  sudo restart lightdm\nAnd the unity greeter login screen was correct. Screens with their respective correct resolutions and if I move the mouse to a screen, it gets focus with the login box and panel, while the unfocused screen just displays an Ubuntu Logo (Just as specified in the MM UX spec book). Fantastic!\nThis workaround works great as long as The external monitor is connected to the laptop.\nIn the situation where it is not connected, at the login stage, I get :a LOW GRAPHICS MODE ERROR (You're running in low graphics mode, your screen, input devices...did not get detected..). Normal, because xrandr tries to output to a non connected monitor.\nThe question here is how should I modify the script in a way that when the external monitor is not connected xrandr outputs only to the laptop screen and ignores any external monitor.\nE.G:\nIf (xrandr -q | grep 'HDMI1 connected') != NULL (HDMI1 is connected )\nthen xrandr --output HDMI1 --primary --mode 1920x1080 --output LVDS1 --mode 1366x768 --below HDMI1\nelse xrandr --output LVDS1 --mode 1366x768 (or do nothing - because the resolution of the laptop screen is correct when no external monitor is connected)\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: I managed this little basic script below that answers my question. Now, whether the external monitor is connected or not, Lightdm uses the right resolutions at the greeter stage. Nevertheless, this same script needs to be modified to be generic, in a way that the user wouldn't need to specify manually resolutions of its laptop and monitor screens.\n (Parse the output of `XRAND -q` command, \nidentify the connected devices, \ngrab their first/maximum resolutions \nand use `XRANDR --output` to display them). \n\nSo if someone has a better solution or a more generic script, he's the man.\nSCRIPT:\n    #!/bin/bash\n    # V-1.0 by Hanynowsky - April 2012. \n    # I am a very basic script that works around bug 874241 repprted in launchpad.\n\n    XCOM0=`xrandr -q | grep 'HDMI1 connected'`\n    XCOM1=`xrandr --output HDMI1 --primary --mode 1920x1080 --output LVDS1 --mode 1366x768 --below HDMI1`\n    XCOM2=`xrandr --output LVDS1 --mode 1366x768`\n    # if the external monitor is connected, then we tell XRANDR to set up an extended desktop\n    if [ -n \"$XCOM0\" ] || [ ! \"$XCOM0\" = \"\" ]; then echo $XCOM1\n    # if the external monitor is disconnected, then we tell XRANDR to output only to the laptop screen\n    else echo $XCOM2\n    fi\n    exit 0;\n\n\nA: Many thanks Hanynowsky! Finding your answer saved me a ton of work (recently upgraded 12.04). However in my case it didn't provide the complete solution so I would like to add what I learned. My setup was a Samsung S22A300B plugged into the VGA port of a Vaio VGN-CR120E with built-in 1280x800 display and a Mobile GM965/GL960 Integrated Graphics Controller.\nBriefly what I found was:\n\n\n*\n\n*The maximum resolution I could set on the external Samsung display using the Displays System Setting was 1024x768.\n\n*This was apparently caused because my VGA controller doesn't support EDID. For some reason both Windows Vista and Windows 7 (on a different laptop) can handle this situation and provide a full range of resolutions.\n\n\nTo workaround this limited maximum resolution I did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Added lines to your script to invoke xrandr with --newmode and --addmode\n\n*Tried cvt to generate the --newmode modeline for 1920x1080, but unfortunately it didn't work for my setup.\n\n*Borrowed a laptop with a an HDMI port, booted it with the Samsung plugged in, and grabbed the modline for 1920x1080 56.2 kHz out of /var/log/Xorg.0.log\n\n*Plugged that modline along with modifying your script for my setup (e.g. HDMI1->VGA1, correct laptop resolution, etc.)\n\n\nThis ALMOST worked, but after logon the external monitor was reset from a nice 1920x1080 back to 1024x768. It turned out that this was a persistent user setting and was easily fixed by using the Displays... System Setting (from the gear menu) to the now available 1920x1080. Now when I boot with the external monitor connected everything works as expected.\nOne additional glitch: If this script gets run twice (for example from terminal) the xrandr --newmode line will get a \"BadName (named color or font does not exist)\" error, but https://stackoverflow.com/questions/851704/xrandr-errors-badname-named-color-or-font-does-not-exist explained this and it seems benign. Also shouldn't be a problem when the script is hooked up lightdm.conf per Hanynowsky's instructions vs. run manually.\nI'm providing the changes adapted for the above (VGA with no EDID functionality) in the hopes it will help someone else. As mentioned in the preceding answers you will have to adapt this for your own setup. I don't have any good advice on obtaining the correct modline, but if someone else does please chip in.\n\n#!/bin/bash\n# Modified for Vaio with 1920x1080 external on VGA\nXCOM0=`xrandr -q | grep 'VGA1 connected'`\nXCOM1=\"xrandr --output VGA1 --primary --mode 1920x1080 --output LVDS1 --mode 1280x800 --left-of VGA1\"\nXCOM2=\"xrandr --output LVDS1 --mode 1280x800\"\nNEWMODE=\"xrandr --newmode \"1920x1080\" 148.50  1920 2448 2492 2640  1080 1084 1089 1125 +hsync +vsync\"\nADDMODE=\"xrandr --addmode VGA1 1920x1080\"\n\n# Always add this mode in case we need it (better would be to test first)\neval $NEWMODE\neval $ADDMODE\n\nif [ -n \"$XCOM0\" ] || [ ! \"$XCOM0\" = \"\" ];\nthen\n        # if the external monitor is connected, then we tell XRANDR to set up an extended desktop\n        eval $XCOM1\nelse\n        # if the external monitor is disconnected, then we tell XRANDR to output only to the laptop screen\n        eval $XCOM2\nfi\nexit 0;\n\nNOTE: I'm not sure if the eval is necessary (vs. echo in the original).

Of course the wiki talks about a problem when booting from USB and states that restarting X using: sudo service lightdm restart will bring a functional graphical desktop, but nothing happens for me!\nAny help is highly appreciated.\n\nA: OK here is the solution for Sony VAIO P netbooks with Intel GMA-500 graphics to boot 12.04-beta2:\nCreate a live version on a USB disk (you can use Ubuntu's \"Startup Disk Creator\" for this) with enough persistent space (about 1 GB is more than enough).

You can do this by either specifying the apropriate packages or if you're unsure, simply run:\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nAfter the upgrade finishes, shutdown and remove the USB disk.\nNow boot the updated live version on your VAIO-P. You will probably end up with a distorted display. According to this section of the wiki switch to console (press CTRL+ALT+F1) and restart X using the following command:\nsudo service lightdm restart\nafter this you will have a fine display to continue testing 12.04-beta2 or installing it on your VAIO-P  :)\n", "Q: FGLRX installation without main monitor This is a spiritual follow up to this\nI am doing some modern OpenGL tutorials and I have found that MESA does not support openGL 3.0+, so I need to get back to FGLRX even if its given me grief in the past.\nEvery time I have tried to install FGLRX drivers I generally get thrown to the terminal and have to do some recovery, etc.  before I can get them to work.\nProblem is, now that my main monitor is borked, when I install FGLRX drivers I cannot boot to terminal.\nQuestion:  How do I back up my current windowing so that when I (inevitably) lost my boot due to FGLRX installation, I can recover it with a livecd without reinstalling, and how can I install it without a main monitor?\n\nA: The easiest way is to usually have another computer you can log in from via ssh or VNC.  It's a pretty simple matter to apt-get remove the fglrx package or modify your xorg.conf to pull your system back into a working state.\nIf you really make a mess of things, you can also run a live CD and just use it to mount your hard drive, or boot your system into recovery mode (which you can get to by holding down the shift key before GRUB shows up) which gives you some of the more common recovery options before it tries to load the graphics drivers.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Refuses to Change Backlight Brightness I've attempted to change the Backlight Brightness, by both the keyboard setting and directly in the screen settings.

I am wondering if there is anything that is an equivalent of JDiskReport for ubuntu. \nI ask this not for finding the file sizes on a particular system, I have used a shell script to find all the file sizes, but I would like to understand the file size distribution in a pictorial format. So that it is easy not only for me to understand but it is easy for me to explain this too.\nDue to my low reputation points I cannot post a picture, but I am looking for something like the figure 2 in  this link\n\nA: jDiskReport is a multi-platform application written in Java.

How can I make part of the image transparent? I tried the \"Color to alpha\" option in GIMP, but it's not working.\nI know in Photoshop you can erase the part you don't like, and make it transparent. Does GIMP support that?\n\nA: If you use an eraser, that will erase to transparence. You also can select an area and press the delete key (not backspace)\n\nA: In GIMP layers can either have an alpha channel or have no alpha channel. When you try erasing parts of an image when there's no alpha channel you get backround color.\nTo add an alpha channel you can bring up the Layers dialog by pressing Ctrl+L, right-click on the layer you want to edit and select Add Alpha Channel there.\n\nFrom there everything is very much like in Photoshop - i.e. Eraser tool erases to transparency, you can make a selection (using, for example, Magic Wand tool) and erase everything in it by pressing Del, etc.   \n\nA: I think what you want to so is as follow:  You blur a layer (eg image of a face) and want to remove the blur from detail areas (eg eyes, lips, eyebrows).  Add alpha channel to the blur layer as suggested above, then hold down Alt as you use the eraser tool, and it will remove the effect only from the erased area.  Then turn down the layer opacity until you get a just perceptible softening of the features with sharp details (eyes, lips, etc).\n", "Q: Text editor playing hide and seek When ever I minimise or Alt+TAB from the text editor Gedit, it disappears from Unity and from alt tabbing.

I have been using Ubuntu for a few years and usually my partition set up was the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ext3 or Ext4 partition for the system itself (20 GB);\n\n*A 10 GB swap partition;\n\n*a big FAT32 partition to store movies, photos, work stuff, etc. (depends on the capacity of the disk, but usually it is what is left from Ext3+Swap, currently it is more than 200 GB).\n\n\nDoes this setup sound right?\nI am considering to switching to one big Ext3 partition now, because the problem with Fat32 in Ubuntu has not gone anywhere:\n\n\n*\n\n*for example, right now I can access my 'big' partition with a 'Data' label only through /media/_themes?END. Pretty strange name for a partition, isn't it?\n\n*some Linux software fail to read/write on this partition. For example, if I want to play around with rebar and build/make/compile things on this FAT32 partition, it will always complain about permissions and won't work (the same goes for many other kinds of software);\n\n*it is not stable, I can not refer to some files on this FAT32 partition, because after the next reboot it will be called not '_themes?END', but something else.\n\n\nOn the other side I usually begin to run out of space on the Ext3 partition after a few months of usage. \nSo, the question is - what is the best setup of partitions for an Ubuntu system? Should a FAT32 partition be used at all?\n\nA: I'm assuming this is your desktop box. If it's so, don't split your filesystem into various partitions (separate /usr, /home, /var, ...) because sooner or later you'll run into a problem of having no space left on /var and /home has tons of gigs (or vice versa).\nSo, create one big partition, and have another one for swap. If you have a decent desktop (4+ GB of RAM) you're safe with a gig or two of swap (unless you want to use 'hibernate', then have swap double the size of your RAM).\nUse ext4, no need to stick with ext3 these days. Also, using fat32 is also not needed, unless you're sharing your setup with Windows installation (even then, it's better to use NTFS in windows, and use ntfs-3g or something like that to read/write those partitions from linux).\nSo, to sum it all up: one partition for all your files, another for swap. No fat32. \n\nA: I can't think of a single reason I would use fat32, except maybe on some memory cards if you want to use them with cameras or similar. If you're dual booting with Windows, I'd probably use an NTFS for your shared data. If not, I'd use an Ext4 or a BtrFS. (BtrFS is very cool, but very new, so there might still be bugs) \nIf you're not using BtrFS, I'd normally recommend using a separate filesystem for your home directory. But I think Ubuntu is now able to keep home on root even if you're doing a fresh install, which makes it less important. \n", "Q: Dual boot Ubuntu and an ubuntu based distro I am running Ubuntu 11.10 and I would like to install an Ubuntu based distro as well.\nWhat are the steps in order to complete this operation?(resize my 500gb hdd, create the needed partitions like / the swap one, etc).\nCould anyone provide detailed information about this?\nThanks!\n\nA: just boot with a live-cd and at installation you can create a partition. Then at boot you will be able to choose which operating system you will run. \nyou don't have to do anything before you start installing. \n", "Q: What do the ActivityWatch and InactivityWatch plugins do? I have search on google but I don't have found anything about the meas of this two plugins: Inactivity watch and Activity watch.\nAnyone can explain me how it works?\nI have tried to activate/deactivate it but I can't see anything.\n\n\nA: I haven't seen the InactivityWatch plugin, but I can tell you what the ActivityWatch plugin does:\nRight click a terminal window you're in and click \"Watch for activity\".\nNow, any time there is activity in that terminal, a notification through pynotify will be sent (which calls libnotify) and should show a notification on your desktop.\nI am going to assume that the InactivityWatch plugin does the opposite of the ActivityWatch plugin and alerts you of a (long) inactivity in that terminal window.\n\nA: InactivityWatch\nThis new plugin was developed as described in this bug-report.\n\n\"Watch for silence\" is useful in the following scenario: Suppose you\nhave a long-running job that produces output while it is running, for\nexample building some software. Then it would be cool to select the\n\"Watch for silence\" action. This would continuously monitor activity\nin the terminal, and when no output arrives for some configurable\ntime, it would mark the window as urgent so that it flashes in the\nGnome taskbar.\n\"Watch for activity\" complements \"watch for silence\" and is useful for\nlong-running jobs that seldom produce output, and you want to be\nalerted when output happens. Perhaps \"tail -F /some/log/file | grep\nSomePattern\" is a typical example.\n\nLooking at the plugins source-code (/usr/share/terminator/terminatorlib/plugins/activitywatch.py), it is actually not configurable - it is hard-coded to display a notification 10 seconds after a file was last updated.  Once this notification has been displayed, no further notifications are shown until the next file update.\n\nActivityWatch\nWhen monitoring a log file, it is sometimes useful to be prompted when it has been updated.\n\nA notification is sent whenever the file has been updated.\nN.B. once a notification is displayed, another notification is not sent for another hard-coded 10 seconds, thus you dont have a continual stream of notifications being displayed for a continually updated file.\nHow to enable\nPerhaps slightly confusing, the inactivitywatch and activitywatch plugins are displayed not by their plugin names.\nRight-click a terminator pane - you can individually set to either watch for silence or watch for activity or both.\n\n", "Q: Problem with brightness Sony Vaio NVIDIA graphics Recently I have installed Ubuntu 11.10 on my laptop (Sony Vaio VPCF22MOE).

I can do things like https on my server, but I don't have great access to the user's machine, so just sharing a directory by samba or sshfs isn't much of an option.\n\nA: This can be done over ssh with mplayer.\nTry Something like:\nssh -X user@hostname \"mplayer -loop 0 video*.mp4\"\n\nExplanation:\nSince the ssh command can be used to execute commands on a remote machine you could have the user run mplayer through ssh on your server. To repeat the videos use mplayer's -loop option. Setting -loop 0 will loop forever (see [mplayer man page][3]). In order to run mplayer through an ssh session X11 forwarding needs to be enabled by the ssh client. To do this use the -X or -Y options (see [ssh man pages][4]).\nPossible Issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*If ssh and/or mplayer are not installed run:\nsudo apt-get install ssh mplayer\n\n*mplayer opens and new window every time a video file begins and then closes it when it ends. This causes the window to jump back to its default start position and size every time. This might be an issue if you re-sized or moved the window. One way to keep the window from reloading at the start of every video is to have mplayer read the concatenated video files. Using an indefinite while loop which concatenates the files to stdout and pipes the video data into mplayer we can allow for one video file to be updated without re-concatenating all the files and for the videos to be repeated. Something like:\nssh -X user@hostname \"while true; do cat video*.mp4; done | mplayer -\"\n", "Q: How to install gpt fdisk 8.4 in Kubuntu 12.04 I'm using Kubuntu 12.04 (64bit).

I have encountered having to choose from this list while trying to download avast! internet security and Adobe Flash Player.\n\nA: Ubuntu 11.10 and other Debian based distributions work best with DEB files. Usually TAR.GZ files contain the source code of the program, so you would have to compile the program yourself. RPM files are mainly used in Fedora/Red Hat based distributions.\nThough it is possible to convert RPM packages to DEB ones.\nNote, make sure you download the correct architecture package for your system. i386 usually means 32-bit OS, x86_64 usually means a 64-bit OS.\n\nA: Ubuntu (like Debian, on which Ubuntu is based) uses .deb packages. HOWEVER, I don't recommend downloading packages and installing them outside of the Software Center if you can help it. Ubuntu Linux is different from Windows or Mac in that regard. You can use the Ubuntu Software Center to search for and install packages, or command line tools like apt-cache and apt-get if you're feeling geeky.\nFor example, to get the Adobe Flash Player, simply install it via the Ubuntu Software Center. You could additionally install Ubuntu Restricted Extras, which will install other common proprietary media formats like MP3 as well.\nAs for Avast, it doesn't seem to be in the repositories, but perhaps you could find a suitable alternative such as ClamAV. Also, remember Anti-Virus protection isn't generally needed on a Linux system in the same way it is needed on a Windows system. I run Clam on Linux file and email servers simply to keep viruses from getting passed on to Windows machines that may connect.\nHope some of this helps you.\n\nA: DEB file will be the best for you. It's binary version and very easy to install (By Just double click). It will automatically resolve dependency if have any. If you fail to find deb file then you should download tar.gz which is source-code version (not compiled). General way to compile and install tar.gz version is following\n1. Extract the tar.gz file\n2. Open terminal the and : cd your_file_directory/Extracted_directory\n3. ./configure\n4. make\n5. sudo make install\n\nThe process differ from source to source. Most of the source follow this way. To make sure the process  read the READ-ME file provided by the developer(in extracted directory)\nFirst, try to find your packages in software center which is default installed with ubuntu.\n\nA: First always check Ubuntu Software Center. Flash is available for Ubuntu. If you really really need to newest version you need a deb. Only need to remember that there are 32 and 64 architecture versions.\nRegarding avast: if you want it to scan for virri and you only use Ubuntu... forget about it. At the moment the only thing you can use it for is for scanning incomming and outgoing traffic to and from Windows machines inside your network. \nAvast is not in the repositories so if you really believe you need this download.\n\nA: The other answers here are largely right. You should look in the package manager first, and failing that, use a .deb file. .deb is the default package type for Debian-based systems like Ubuntu, and it'll install all the files in the right place, and you shouldn't have any problems (unless the package is out of date). Note that .deb files built for different Debian-based distros are slightly different, but will usually work. The only problem you may face is if certain required libraries aren't available, or are called different things. If that happens, your best bet is to ask here or on other ubuntu forums about how to deal with that specific problem.\nIf .deb files aren't available, you can use .rpm files on a debian-based system. The most reliable way is to use the alien package, which is available in the package manager. This basically converts the .rpm file to a .deb, making sure to use all the correct file paths, and then (optionally) installs it. You can simply run:\nsudo alien --install /path/to/package.rpm\n\nIf you're feeling adventurous, you can compile from source using a .tar.gz. This method is quite often prone to annoying failures, such as missing libraries, but will generally work if you're persistent and are using up-to-date sources. If you plan to go down this route though, you may as well learn how to use git or what ever other version control system the software you want uses (assuming it's open source), so that you can get the most up-to-date version, with any bug-fixes (although this opens you up to newly-introduced bugs as well).\n\nA: i think linux don't need to have antivirus, because when you want to install software, your OS inform you and want to get admin password from you, linux just need backup!\nyou can convert .rpm onto .deb, but not recommended\nand you can convert .run onto .deb ...\nby this action you can download any thing you want\n", "Q: 2 editors on Ubuntu, Gedit and Kwrite?

Thanks in advance.\n\nA: You will need to download a new DVD, I do not think you can recover with wget.\nThis is a great user case for using torrents ;) The torrent client will download the file in chunks which are then checksummed. If a single chunk is invalid, only that part has to be downloaded again instead of the whole file in case of a regular HTTP download.\nFYI the DVD does not contain additional packages, it just contains additional language support, so unless you need the language support, the CD should be sufficient.\nhttps://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/24376\n\nA: I think you have several options here.  One would be to disable md5sum in brasero by going to the edit plugins menu and disabling checksum on files and disks.  I do this usually as a matter of course on the disk just because it takes FOREVER to check the disks and I don't usually find it necessary.  A single splash file being messed up may not effect your ability to use the disk at all.  Another, if you have a reliable internet connection would be to just download the Ubuntu CD and download other packages as needed.  The benefit to this is that you get the most up to date packages from the repositories instead of getting them from the DVD.  Another option would be to replace the file in the iso.

If so, then the problem may be in Firefox or other browsers. However, it's not a generic problem (for instance, jquery.com works fine for me), but something misconfigured in your particular installation. One thing to try is create a new profile in Firefox and try accessing the site, to override any customizations you made.\nIf it doesn't open in any browsers (you can even try wget from the command line and see if that is able to fetch from jquery.com) then the problem is at a lower level. You may have some iptables rules blocking access to jquery.com (check with iptables -L, again this isn't something generic in Ubuntu, it would have to be something you configured specifically).\nFinally, there may be something blocking access outside your computer, (a caching proxy, or a firewall, or even a routing problem between you and jquery.com).

Hm... I Installed 12.04 B1 before it promptly crashed and corrupted my drive, but before that, it seemed much slower than a 32-bit version of 11.10 which I installed before. I bought a new drive, and installed 11.10 AMD64 on it, and again it seemed much slower that i686. Why?\nOh and it's a persistent flash drive I installed the Ubuntu OSs on.\nIsn't it the computer's CPU that does all the processing? Is it the fact that the load of 64 bits is too much and 32 bits are lighter to transfer to the computer's CPU?\nI have a Intel Celeron something 64-bit CPU.\n\nA: AMD64 installs will always use more RAM than i386, so if you are low on ram, then i386 will work faster.  Drive failure also causes an OS to run very slowly, and even crash.  If your drive was a little thumb drive, it was probably near burned out by the time you installed the 64-bit version on it. (Those things can't be written to very many times)  Even the flash drives you put in your computer and use as a hard drive have a limited number of writes.  Those things don't last very long, especially when there is an OS on it.  When the OS can't read from the media, apps can't load and such, ergo your computer is \"slow\".\n\nA: No, CPU is not the only thing doing processing. A desktop system will not be faster than it seems to be. That is to say; graphics is very important. If your graphics driver is bad, then things will draw slowly on your screen, and the result is that your computer seems to be very slow. Since you can't react to things you can't see, the effect actually is that the computer is slower. \nIf your graphics is the issue, then choosing Ubuntu 2D before you log in (clicking on the button next to your username) should be much, much faster.

I noticed a faint clicking noise from my hard disk. I have had severe disk failures twice before, so I started to panic, knowing that it might be a symptom of disk failure, or incipient disk failure. I searched for possible causes of disk clicking. There is discussion about this all over the web, with people opening up their hard disks, etc. (Don't do it!) My computer is a desktop and has never been dropped or suffered any trauma, and it is powered through a good UPS, so it should not have suffered any power surges. It turns out that one possible cause of disk clicking is that the disk is not getting enough power. In my case, all I had to do was to power down normally, disconnect the power, press the power button once to remove any residual power on the MG. Then I connected my HD to a different cable from the power supply. Once I rebooted, everything was back to normal.\n\nA: I installed 19.10 and both monitors showed a purple screen upon boot.\nBUT I later realized that I had a third output from my GPU going to a monitor that I've had some problems with in the past. (it doesn't always \"detect\" the input).\nApparently that monitor was being assigned as primary and the default behavior for secondary monitors at login-time is to show a blank purple screen.\nOnce I unplugged that HDMI cable, an actual login screen popped up on one of the other monitors and I was good to go.\nIf anyone comes across a purple screen at boot following a fresh 19.10 install, it might be worth trying some of the other GPU outputs or unplugging anything extra that might be plugged in. \n", "Q: Why does Unity and Unity 2D use different config systems? (DConf and GConf) Unity 3D uses GConf, but Unity 2D uses DConf. Why is that and is there an overview of where the different parts of Unity (scopes, lenses, etc) are stored in which configuration system? \n\nA: GConf if being replaced by DConf. New applications should use the latter. However, Unity 3D is based on Compiz, which itself still uses GConf. So Unity 3D inherits from that. Unity 2D is new, so it uses DConf. \nThe parts of Unity that isn't shown, such as data providers, scopes and lenses, are stored in DConf. \n", "Q: How do I remove the video lens? How do I remove the video lens in Unity 12.04? \n\nA: Its relatively straightforward to remove the video lens.\nFrom a terminal:\nsudo apt-get purge unity-lens-video\n\nAlternatively, from the software center just search for unity-lens-video, click remove and click Remove All when prompted.\nFinally - logout and login.\n\nA: As it turns out, I turned the renaming lense folders into a small project that I made into a PPA.  It's located here if you want to try it out.  You have to log-out and log-in after you apply the changes.\nIt works fine for me.  Leaving the rest of the answer for historical purposes.\n\nInteresting question I wondered about, but never asked.  \nSubstitute video or any other lense name to disable other lenses.  \nLenses are stored in /usr/share/unity/lenses/ \nSo cd /usr/share/unity/lenses/.\nStep in to the directory of the lense you want to disable.  I wanted to disable files cd files.\nI renamed files.lens like so sudo mv files.lense files.lense.ignore\nAnd replaced unity unity --replace & \nWorks for me with no crashes.\nBefore\n\nAfter\n \nTo revert the change simply:\nsudo mv files.lense.ignore files.lense && unity --replace &\nDoing it this way is useful for just temporarily disabling a lense if you're going to take screenshots for example.  The other method is a cleaner more permanent solution.  \n", "Q: How do I force the native screen resolution of my display if it's not offered using fglrx driver? My computer model is Dell Studio 1555: Pentium Dual Core T4300(2.1GHz,800MHz,1MB), 4096MB 800MHz DDR2 Dual Channel, 512 MB ATI Mobility RADEON HD 4570 using the ATI proprietary driver. My screen resolution is 1366x768 (16:9). This problem has been identified on Ubuntu 11.10 and 12.04\nI recently acquired an LG - L203WT monitor but I've found that I can't get the maximum resolution out of it - 1680x1050, which is 16:10 ratio.\nThe settings in Display show the maximum resolution I can achieve as 1440x900\n\nThis is also shown in AMD Catalyst Control Centre\n\nThe resolution has to be be 16:10 ratio for it to work, so choosing a 16:9 resolution doesn't work.\nAs I'm using the proprietary driver using xrandr wont work, so is there any other way to get the maximum resolution of 1680x1050 with the fglrx driver?\n\nA: It is likely that the reason you cannot achieve this resolution on the external monitor is because the card does not support it.\nMost graphics cards only support a certain number of possible resolutions and combinations, so with two monitors, the card probably cannot push the resolution you are trying to achieve. It is also possible that this is a driver related issue, as proprietary drivers normally limit the resolution options to something that is safe for the card.\nYou might be able to achieve a lower resolution that works with your monitor (such as 1400x1050), but not the maximum supported by the monitor.\n", "Q: How to install Windows 7 after Ubuntu? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to completely remove Ubuntu? \n\nI installed Ubuntu to see what it is..\nwell I saw and its far to complicated and annoying to me..\nor maybe I just looked at it wrong I m still open for ideas..\nbut I tried  to install w7 and when I got to choose the Partition select it says that it can install w7 only on NTFS disc and I have some other type..\nwhat is it and how can I change it? \n\nA: It's really off topic for this site, but ok.

It's physically impossible to force it to handle a higher resolution whatever the OS.\nIn another hand, to feel more comfortable, reduce the desktop font and launcher icon size.

Forgotten Password, but no Passphrase I am using a cloned hard drive in attempts to restore some old files. \nThe cloned drive has 2 users, one with an encrypted home drive, one without. Both are administrators. When I couldn't get into the main user (with the encrypted home directory), I logged in as the 2nd user and changed the password. \nIt seems that I somehow broke the relationship between the encryption passphrase and the user. I'm pretty sure I have the passphrase. Is there a way to get to the data?\n\nA: The encrypted home directory (and encrypted private folder) features make use of a random mount passphrase.  This mount passphrase is then stored encrypted with the user's login password.  On login, the user's password is used to decrypt the mount passphrase and the key is used to mount the home directory.\nWhen you perform a normal password change where the old password is requested before entering the new one, the mount passphrase can be re-encrypted with the new login password.  When you perform an administrative password change, this can't be done since the key used to decrypt the mount passphrase is not provided.\nIn order to get in to the encrypted home directory now, you will need one of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*the old login password for the account.\n\n*the mount passphrase used when you set up the encrypted home directory (you would have been told to write this down somewhere).\n\n\nIf you have either of these, you should be able to access the data by running the following command and following the prompts:\nsudo ecryptfs-recover-private /home/user\n\nIf you don not have either of these pieces of information, then the information is lost.

I guess it is gnome screensaver which blanks the screen after 10minutes (idle-session...). \nYour dpms settings shows that screen will never power off automatically. \nIf you want to force a switch off after 10 min of inactivity, you should type : \nxset dpms 0 0 600 \nYou may also disable the gnome screensaver (useless as the screen will swith off after 10min): \ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver idle-activation-enabled false\nIf you want a screensaver before switching off the screen after 5 minutes, you may enable the xorg screensaver : \nxset s 300\nRegards,\n\nA: Hopefully you have solved the problem now. However, just for anyone else who may be experiencing this problem just re-setting the xset dpms energy star settings will do the trick...usually! Just open a terminal Ctrl + Alt + T and type: \nxset +dpms (no sudo needed) then press Enter.\nThat instruction turns on the power management control. Sometimes the xset -q command in a terminal shows the power management 'dpms enabled' as with the screen shot shown at the top of this thread. It doesn't in fact definitely mean it is switched on. In fact I've discovered it's often a completely false reading and the PMS is 'Off'.\nOnce you have entered the command xset +dpms as above, go to 'System Settings' and 'Brightness & Lock' control. There you can adjust the time before the screen powers down. It will work for mostly everyone with this problem I've found.\nIanW -Superuser Ubuntu 12.04 LTS\n", "Q: How do I get KLIPS or NETKEY on 11.10 server?

I've tried the command line, the Synaptic Package Manager, all to no avail. \nAll of this is within a custom distro known as OpenArtist, currently based off of Ubuntu Maverick (www.openartisthq.com), and what I meainly want to achieve is to creating working shortcuts within submenus as well as download, find, and execute working applications possibly outside of the more popular distros' package managers and then create a path to be launched within a menu. \nI am new to Linux and am fairly unsure as to where I can find information regarding this.\nIf you'd like a specific example, OpenArtist houses a menu upon the panel known as \"3D.\" What I would like to accomplish is downloading Blender 2.62 and then creating a working path to launch the program. I would like to do this with several other programs, but figure that if I can resolve this, anything else should come easily. \nThanks! :3\n\nA: The package manager includes a massive wealth of software. Installing from source will always be a challenge. There are basic guides on installing software from source (running ./configure, make, sudo make install) but you will have to read the output to see if you're missing dependencies, then you may have to search the web for those dependencies to find out which packages contain them. If it installs but just says there's an error installing it, go to the package manager to fix broken packages, and all is resolved.\nTo edit the applications menu, make sure you have the menu editor installed: sudo apt-get install alacarte, then you can run alacarte and edit your menus. You can easily create, delete and edit launchers in the Menu Editor.\nIf you install Blender, it should automatically add itself to the applications menu. Installing software from source usually does this, too. If it doesn't show up automatically, you can go into the Menu Editor and find them in their respective categories, then uncheck and re-check them.\n", "Q: What is the fallback font in ubuntu? What font does Ubuntu use for really irregular characters like , and just general Chinese characters? Since it sort of falls back to a font that does have the glyphs, its impossible to tell where it's coming from. Also, does anyone know of any tools I can use to see what glyphs a *.ttf file supplies (For linux, naturally :P)?\n\nA: The fallback fonts are decided by Fontconfig; it consults the configuration in /etc/fonts as well as the glyphs provided by all fonts to determine or decide which particular font is used to provide the character. You can right-click on a character in Character Map to see which font has been used to backfill the character.\nNewer versions of GNOME Character Map can restrict display of glyphs to a specific installed font, but you will have to use something like FontForge in order to view available glyphs in a compact format.\n", "Q: can't mount ntfs partition without root access  whenever try to mount ntfs partition it says \n\nError mounting: mount exited with exit code 1: helper failed with:\n  Unprivileged user can not mount NTFS block devices using the external\n  FUSE library.

This suggestion from mac (above) appears to have fixed it -\n/dev/sda1                                  /media/sda1  ntfs  nls=iso8859-1,rw,umask=000,user\n\nI commented out the old entry in fstab generated by pysdm though, it looks like this -\n/dev/sda5                                  /media/data       ntfs  \n# nls=iso8859-1,rw,group=users,users,umask=000,gid=users,user,owner,uid=fnord  0  0  \nnls=iso8859-1,rw,umask=000,user  0  0\n\nIt works on reboot, BUT - there is a mount error when it's booting, with a \"ignore or repair\". I ignore, it boots and everything is perfect.\nEDIT - Well, that was enthusiastic moderation. Unaware hardware shop items can cause flagging... My question again - I am hesitant to do other changes to fstab. I was wondering if my change shown above is the cause of the bootup mount error warning?\n", "Q: How can I read image info on the command line? Is there a command that can read image attributes?

Sorry for bad English.\n\nA: You can adjust the individual colour gamma correction settings of your screen using the xgamma tool.  Running it with no arguments will print the current settings:\n$ xgamma\n-> Red  1.000, Green  1.000, Blue  1.000\n\nYou can adjust the green gamma value with a command like:\n$ xgamma -ggamma 0.75\n\nIf you are using a multi-monitor set up and want to adjust the gamma of individual outputs, you can do so with the xrandr tool instead:\n$ xrandr --output $OUTPUT --gamma $RED:$GREEN:$BLUE\n\nIn this command, $OUTPUT is one of the outputs listed when you run xrandr with no arguments.  Note also that xrandr treats the gamma mapping as going in the reverse direction, so you will need to provide the inverse of the values you'd provide to xgamma (e.g. passing 2.0 to xgamma is equivalent to passing 0.5 to xrandr).\nBoth of these options will not survive an X server restart, so once you've got some values you're happy with consider putting them in a shell script (perhaps in ~/bin), and then adding that script as a startup application.\n", "Q: (No Root File System)-ergo no install 12.04 I have my HDD 1Tb partitioned with fs ext4.\nPreviously I was booting from the 2TB Hard Drive...I disconnected that.\nNow I want a clean install 12.04 but cannot figure out \"Root File System\" (\"/\")\nCrazy...had the same problem 2 years ago...two weeks then...I should have written down the answer!\nCan anyone help an old man?\nThanks\n\nA: I assume you are using the manual partitioning option - something else I think it is called.\nSelect the partition you want to install in - Edit - in new window select / from the dropdown - format as you wish.\nExit that back to the partition list. \n", "Q: Using dpkg --set-selections I used the following commands to lock my Samba installation from upgrading.\necho samba hold | dpkg --set-selections\necho samba install | dpkg --set-selections\n\nMy question is simple.

Thus you'd make a task that runs every day at 1:00 to change the theme to Theme1.  Another process that runs everyday that runs everyday to change the theme to Theme2, etc.  The best way to do this would be to write a script but this would be an easy workaround.\n", "Q: reboot now doesn't work in Ubuntu installtion CD/USB I am currently using Window XP 64bit and trying to install ubuntu by clicking \"reboot now\" option in Reboot Required under Demo and full installation button in Ubuntu menu of CD/USB ( I tried both from cd and usb). But It doesn't reboot my machine to install ubuntu. Could you anyone help me how to do that ?\nThanks.\n\nA: I assume you mean the Windows utility that is included on Ubuntu CD/USB.  I haven't seen that one in a while, but believe that this button does nothing special to install Ubuntu (in fact, it can't). It simply tries to tell your system to reboot, which is something you can probably do by other means.\nWhat you actually need to do to install Ubuntu (or any other operating system) is to make your computer boot from the medium. If you tried restarting your computer with CD/USB in and you still haven't seen Ubuntu menu, your machine is apparently not configured to do so.\nSo you need to tell your BIOS to boot from CD/USB.  How exactly this is done?  I strongly recommend reading up on this on your PC or motherboard manual, but generally there are two approaches:\n\n\n*\n\n*use a dedicated keyboard shortcut to bring up Boot menu\n\n\n*\n\n*on Dell machines it's often F12\n\n*on some (older) machines such shortcut is missing, there's only\nthe other way\n\n\n*enter BIOS setup and configure it to try to boot from devices in fixed\norder\n\n\n*\n\n*e.g. USB, then CD, then HDD\n\n*on almost every desktop I have seen, BIOS was accessed via\nDel\nOnly opportunity to enter BIOS or boot menu is when the machine is starting, just for the first few seconds.  Watch messages shown on screen for the shortcuts.\nWarning: If you are planning to install other OS on your machine, be aware that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu, or any other OS will need at least one partition on your disk for\nitself. (I believe 10GiB will suffice for Ubuntu.) The easiest and almost\nrisk-free way is having separate physical disk for this\n\n*You can also resize partition(s) on your old disk (e.g. using\nGParted, which is present on Ubuntu LiveCD/USB) to make room for\nnew one, but in that case, do full backup of your data. It's quite\neasy to blast everything irreversibly this way!\n\n*If you get to resize (shrink) an existing partition, don't forget to\ndo this before starting:\n\n\n*\n\n*free as much space as possible\n\n*defragment it\n\n*check it for errors\nThis will speed up the process and lower risk of failure.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 11.10 problem with Nvidia I have an acer with a Gforce graphics card.

When running remotely, it does not have the ability to communicate with a factory server, so it sets up the window itself and must continue running until that window is closed.\nIf you put the command in the background with & you will get the effect you want regardless of remote or local (or use of --disable-factory which would cause the local ones to behave like the remote ones).

I have a BLU-RAY disc of my project. I need rip this to my HD and burn this content in a DVD-R. Its possible?\n\nA: No. A Blu-Ray disc is a much more dense type of disc. It can hold a lot more data than a DVD can. If the total amount of data you have on a Blu-Ray is less than the amount of data that can be fit on a DVD, then it would be possible. However, you cannot read a Blu-Ray disc without a drive made to read them. If you haven't got a Blu-Ray drive, you won't be able to get any data off a Blu-Ray disc, and onto your computer.\n\nA: What sort of data are we talking about? Whichever, the answer is yes.\nIf it's video, sure. You can use something like MakeMKV/Handbrake to get the video from the disc and then something like Brasero or K9Copy to create the new DVD. You'll lose quality but there you go.\nIf we're talking about files then there's really no option to reduce their size significantly but you should be able to break them up into multiple files. If you have files that are too large to fit on a single disc, there are tools like hjsplit that will allow you to dismantle them, put them on disc, copy them off discs at the other end and then reassemble.\n", "Q: How do I mount a USB floppy disk drive? I have tried to mount my usb floppy disk drive in 11.04 Natty. So far I have managed to use the udisks --mount/dev/sdf command in terminal, but get a message that I have not stated a filetype\njohn@john-desktop:~$ udisks --mount /dev/sdf\nMount failed: Error mounting: mount: you must specify the filesystem type\nThis is the result I get when trying to mount the usb floppy disk drive. Anyone know how to proceed?\n\nA: udisks is asking you to specify the filesystem format because it cannot figure it out by itself. The reason it cannot is because you are telling it the wrong device to mount. You don't actually mount disks. You mount partitions (also called volumes). So instead of running\nudisks --mount /dev/sdf\n\nRun:\nudisks --mount /dev/sdf1\n\nThat mounts the first partition on the disk (assuming the disk really is /dev/sdf). It's very rare for a floppy disk to have more than one partition. If it is not partitioned at all, then you can partition it with fdisk and then format it with mkdosfs, both of which must be run as root with sudo (or do both with GParted), but if that is the case, make sure it's the right device, because if it's a different drive with important data on it, you could lose that data.\n\nA: You are forgetting the part about defining the format. udisks --mount /dev/sdf --mount-fstype=vfat (or any other type).\n", "Q: How to resolve broken dependencies of gnome-shell-extensions-user-theme package?

Or can I finish after the release and have it put in the repositories at that time?\n\nA: You may submit an application that runs on 12.04 anytime that 12.04 is a supported version of Ubuntu, which in this case is 5 years after release. When you upload an application you  should indicate what versions of Ubuntu you wish to support, supporting the current release and the LTS is suggested.\nDepending on your application it can take a week to approve and publish, so to be in the software center for the release of 12.04 I would give us a little additional time as it does get busy.\n\nA: Go to http://developer.ubuntu.com/ to find how to get your software to the Ubuntu software center.\n\"Or can I finish after the release and have it put in the repositories at that time?\"\nI think it is hard if Ubuntu 12.04 is released.

If so, how can I start the Xwindows session remotely to connect with vncserver?\n\nA: Which is the default runlevel? AFAIK this is configured in /etc/init/rc-sysinit.conf. Setting DEFAULT_RUNLEVEL to 2 should make the server start the X environment.\nAlternatively, you could use ssh to start a complete gnome session on the server, displaying it on the client, using ssh -X remote-user@server gnome-session.

Do I have to do it while installing Ubuntu using Gparted?\nI'm quite confused and I'd like to make it right so I guess I need your help.\nThanks a lot everyone.\n\nA: The Ubuntu installer will give you the option to resize your partitions, there will be a optionto install it next to windows, use up the whole disk, and 1 that says 'something else' in which you can manually set all the partitions you'd like, like that common data one.\n\nA: How I would go about doing this is:\n1) Back-Up your system - seems obvious but it should be mentioned\n2) Shrink your C or D drive. - This can be done in Windows quite easily, you can use GpartEd if you really want to but it is not necessary.  There are thousands of guides how to do this with either option so I'm not going to go into too much detail. \n3)Format the Data partition to FAT32 or get NTFS support for Ubuntu - Formatting the shared drive to FAT32 will be the easier option as it is supported off the bat by both distros, but I believe it gives you a file size limit of about 4gb.  If you choose to go the NTFS route, there are plenty of guides available to guide you through that process.\n\nA: Whatever you have described seems like a lot of work to do. I would prefer formatting the hard drive and starting everything afresh. This seems like less haste. However, follow the steps below to get what you want. Remember to create a backup of all your data before starting.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install whichever partition tool that you prefer.\n\n*Re size one of your partitions and allocate some space for the Ubuntu partition. \nFormat it to ext4. Ubuntu runs on ext4. Ubuntu doesn't require much space, so whatever is left is for your \"big\" common partition. You can access the files on Ubuntu from windows using \"ext2explore\". You can directly access all files in your hdd from ubuntu without using any additional software.\n\n*Download the Ubuntu ISO from the Ubuntu website. 14.04 is the LTS version, or you can get the latest 14.10 if you want to. Write the Ubuntu ISO to a DVD and boot from that.\n\n*Installation is pretty simple and there are a lot of guides out there to do that. Moving on.\n\n*Now that you have successfully installed Ubuntu, you got to set the MBR right. Use syslinux to get the job done, if GRUB hadn't already been installed and you have trouble booting into the system.\nYou're all set to use Ubuntu and Windows. \n", "Q: How to remove access point from saved list OS: Ubuntu 11.10 with gnome-shell\nI've few access points on my saved list which I want to remove and never connect to.\nI can't seem to find way to delete these.\nHow should I remove (at least not auto connect) from saved access point list?\n\nA: ctrl + t {for terminal prompt}\ncd /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections \nsudo rm {wireless_hotspot_name}\n\nHope that helps\nEDIT FROM ONE YEAR LATER \nSeems like this turned into a fairly popular answer, so I went ahead and wrote an automated script to do this for everyone.

I guess this is more of a general question that I cant find the the answer to anywhere.  What is the version numbering logic for open source developers managing software releases and is there any governance or guidance I can read up on.  The origins of this question comes from me  reviewing and researching software on countless websites that I would like to use on my Ubuntu OS. \nThrough experience, I am learning some sites are much better than others explaining if a release is a stable, experimental or maintenance release but these explanations are not consistent with any version numbering logic I am familiar with.\n\nA: I think it's probably worth addressing the specific version numbering part of this question. Of course, there are many different development models and versioning schemes used by open source projects. So there is no real definitive answer, but there are two projects very important to Ubuntu that have a specific way of doing version numbering.\nGNOME uses a versioning scheme where in X.Y.Z \n\n\n*\n\n*\"X\" is the major release number. This only changes when there has\nbeen a significant break in the project.\n\n*\"Y\" is an even number for stable versions, and is an *odd number\nfor unstable version*s. For example, the 3.4.1 version is stable, but\n3.5.1 is unstable.\n\n*\"Z\" is used in \"odd numbered\" releases as an increment towards the\n\"even numbered\" release. After the stable release is made, it is then\nused for small bug fix \"point releases.\"\nThe Linux kernel uses a similar versioning scheme. This seems to work best for projects with time based releases.\n\nA: As you probably know, there are more than one \"software development methodology\".\nAnd sure, more than one \"life cycle\".\nSome of them are \"Security Driven\", some \"Release Driven\", some \"Deadline Driven\", \"Documentation Driven\" and more...\nEven if the software is open source or not, the software can be managed with any methodology, according to the goal of the project.\nI think; It is better to search for the methodology of the project (if there is one, specific), and then search for it's release version control.\nExample:\nThe project is managed with Waterfall Life Cycle Model. \nThat means, every step is checked, there is a big work and team is separated to certain sub-teams. (This one is not good for Open Source, because Water Fall is not for open minds)\nExample 2:\nThe project is managed with XP, Agile:\nThat means, the project is story (feature) driven. Every sub-version brings new and fully-working features to latest program. And every version brings bigger changes (or may be collects goal related features together).\n", "Q: Thumbnails for certain formats not appearing in Nautilus .odt and .odb files do not have an icon in Nautilus and some of my older documents are missing their thumbnails, all of which are either .odt or .odp.\nI just purged and reinstalled LibreOffice today... could this be the reason why?\nI am on Ubuntu 11.10, using LibreOffice 3.4  340m1(Build:402) that comes by default in the repos.\nHere's what I see for these formats:\n\n\nA: To have LibreOffice documents in Nautilus while using Ubuntu 11.10 you need to install an extension to it since those are not supported by default.\nThe only one I know of is ooo-thumbnailer from this PPA, it can be installed using these commands in a terminal:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:flimm/ooo-thumbnailer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ooo-thumbnailer\n\nWhen its done installing you should need to log off or restart Nautilus with nautilus -q.\nIt should be safe to use this PPA but you should always remember there are no warranties using PPAs.\nFor more information on what are PPAs and risks involved in using one please have a look at the following posts:\n\n\n*\n\n*What are PPAs and how do I use them?\n\n*Are PPA's safe to add to my system and what are some \"red flags\" to watch out for?\n", "Q: Why can't I get a working session with vnc4server We have a couple of (identical) Ubuntu 11.10 machines, configured with gnome-classic, which we use as remote servers, and let our clients log into personal user accounts we create for them using vnc4server.\nWe configured all the machines in the same way, following a short manual we compiled, describing how to download, install and prepare a few tools and our software.\nThe connection usually works fine, but today I set up a fresh machine, and experienced problems.\nAfter installing vnc4server, I ran vncpasswd and copied the following startup file to ~/.vnc/xstartup:\n\n#!/bin/sh  \nunset SESSION_MANAGER  \nunset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS  \ngnome-session --session=gnome-classic &  \n[ -x /etc/vnc/xstartup ] && exec /etc/vnc/xstartup  \n[ -r $HOME/.Xresources ] && xrdb $HOME/.Xresources  \nxsetroot -solid grey  \nvncconfig -iconic &  \n\nThen, I started vnc4server and used two viewers (the Ubuntu Remote Desktop Viewer and Windows RealVNC Client) in two other machines, but instead of getting my desktop, I see an empty window with a grey-ish background pattern like this:\n\nand the cursor is a bold X.\nWhat is wrong with the setup and why don't I get a remote session as expected?\n\nA: You may want to edit the /root/.vnc/xstartup file so it reads (in your case, the x-terminal-emulator line is your important part to add),\nxrdb $HOME/.Xresources\nxsetroot -solid grey\nx-terminal-emulator -geometry 80x24+10+10 -ls -title \"$VNCDESKTOP Desktop\" &\ngnome-session &\n\n\nA: So, we found out that the xstartup file needs executable permission, which were not set in this machine's configuration.

I switched from Windows to Ubuntu 4 months ago and I am really happy with it. I set up a dual-boot system (since I wasn´t sure how it will end up with me and Ubuntu).\nAfter merging from Citavi to Zotero I need windows only for my scanner. The problem I have now is, that the windows partition is so big with lots of unused space and the Ubuntu partition are quite small - I should have though about this problem 4 months ago...\nMy partitions look like this:\n\nWhere sda3 is the windows partition, sda5 is Ubuntu and sda7 is a data partition.\nI want to shrink sda3 and free some space for sda5 and sda7. \nHow can this be done safely (and easily)?\n\nA: This shouldn't be too much of a problem.  Things will work best if you boot from a LiveCD (or LiveDVD), choose to Try Ubuntu, and once it reaches the default Ubuntu desktop you can open the Dash and open GParted.  (You're going to be doing things with partitions, which is best done from a Live desktop so the drives are unmounted.)\nFirst, you can shrink sda3 to free up some space.  I would suggest that you not mess with sda1 and sda2; Windows will likely not like that and might respond by making it difficult to get back into Windows.  Similarly, don't move sda3; just shrink it in size by the amount you want to give to Ubuntu.\nYou can then expand the Extended - sda4 - partition into the free (unallocated) space you created. Then you can expand sda5 to the left to grab the available space.\nYou might find that you'll get an error message telling you that you can't do it because some drive - probably sda6, the Linux Swap partition - is still mounted.  If that happens, you can right-click it and unmount it without causing any problems, and then just proceed.\n\nA: It can be done pretty much just like you said: shrink sda3, then extend sda5 to use that space.  First you will need to extend sda4 since sda5 is an logical partition contained in the extended partition, and you will need to boot from the livecd so the partitions are not mounted ( and thus locked ).\n\nA: first you have to download the Gparted application and burn it to a CD or move it to USB and boot from it. you can download it from this link :    \nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/gparted/files/gparted-live-stable/0.12.0-5/gparted-live-0.12.0-5.iso/download \nthen after booting a window will open and all you have to do is:        \n1) create some free space from the sda3 partition (windows)    .\n2) reboot to Windows, because you have to make a test to the ntfs partition before making any other changes (the test will start automatically, dont cancel it).\n3) boot to Gparted again and right click on the sda5 partition (ubuntu) then click on resize or move and add the free space to it.\n", "Q: How can I save an email from Thunderbird?

I was wondering what could be a good app (with a GUI ;) ) for making a video from a bunch of photos or images, to create a time-lapse video, or a stop-motion animation, or even a video like this one.\nThe idea is to set a really small time between each photo, but also to be able to change this time every so often, or add some effects, to make the succession smoother in particular.\nWhat would be perfect is a function that allows automatic cropping of the photos as well as exposure adjustment so they all have the same background and so the time-lapse video looks smoother.\nI know about the slide show app \"Imagination\" but the interval can not go under one second.\nEdit: here is my progress, also thanks to the first answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*I tried Luciole, it is really simple and promising, but pretty\nbuggy, and I only could export an average video in .dv format (mpg2\nand avi don't work).

In ubuntu 11.11 the version of mono that is included supports .net 4. So any program referencing .net 2.0 assemblies will not work.

I sell things on ebay here and there and I have always used windows.  Is linux safe enough to do my ebay dealings?  Is there anything related to linux I need to download to be keep passwords and money safe?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: A couple of years ago, ComputerWorld author Robert Mitchell made some waves with an article titled \"Can Ubuntu Save Online Banking?\"  The premise of the article isn't anything really pro-Linux or anti-Windows.  But rather that conducting online banking from the same PC used (by your entire family) for web surfing puts you at-risk of any dormant malware designed to steal bank information.  As a remedy, the author recommends using an Ubuntu Live CD for online banking, and even suggests that some banks might start handing them out to customers.\nMy point with referencing this article, is that if security experts are recommending using Ubuntu (albeit, on a live CD) for banking, then you should be ok on EBay.  As others have said, you should be fine with Ubuntu out-of-the-box.  I've used Ubuntu for online banking, EBay, shopping, etc for several years now, and never had a problem.\n\nA: Brian,\nI started using Linux right around the same time that I started selling on Ebay.  I have not ran into any issues and absolutely love Linux.\nIn the Ubuntu Software Center there is a tool known as esniper which is a lightweight ebay sniping tool.\n\nA: Ebay is a website so make sure that your browser is safe. Uninstall plugins that you don't need. You should install the HTTPS Everywhere pluign which makes sure that the browser uses an HTTPS connection if it's supported by the website. You should also remove your browsing history after using Ebay.\nUse strong passwords for your Ebay and Ubuntu (login) accounts. Remember to log out from Ebay after using it. Lock your screen if you leave your PC unattended.\nThis queston has more tips on making Firefox for more secure.\n", "Q: Overheating on Dell Studio XPS 1645 So I was wondering if anyone else has come upon this problem, and/or has come up with a solution. When I use my Ubuntu partition, my computer becomes extremely hot, and the fan runs very noisily for a very long time. If I reboot into windows while this is happening, my computer actually begins to cool down while doing the exact same tasks. Thinking this might just be a bug with Ubuntu, I installed fedora on another partition, and the same problem occurs. Is this a problem with the kernel? Cpufreq tells me that my CPU is running at 933 MHz out of a possible 1.6 GHz from my Intel Core i7 CPU Q70. For anyone who wants more information, I have 8 GB of memory, and an ATI Mobility Raedon HD 5730 Graphics Card. I'm open to any ideas anyone might have. Thanks in advance!\n\nA: There is an overheating problem with some Intel processors running Linux kernel < 3.2 (power regressions). This issue, I read, has been fixed in 12.04 (Linux\nkernel 3.2) So upgrade to 12.04 when it is released in 16\ndays. Hope this helps\n\nA: Although your computer has some mighty powerful specs for the time of writing, I'd recommend giving Lubuntu a spin (Ubuntu with LXDE). I know LXDE is ideal for old computers, but I've tried running Ubuntu and Lubuntu on an old HP laptop, on Ubuntu with Unity (even in Unity 2D) it would overheat and shut off, whereas with LXDE it would run for much much longer before overheating to the point of shutting off. LXDE may not be as packed with features as Gnome or KDE, but I'd still use Linux with LXDE over windows on any hardware. If that does make a difference, you may then want to give Xubuntu a spin, see if you prefer Xfce or LXDE (LXDE is lighter than Xfce, but you may find that Xfce is light enough and has a few more features). Also you could try formatting your Linux partition with different filesystems.\n\nA: I had a similar problem...and a BIOS Update fixed my problem..Hope this piece of information helps.\n", "Q: Will my all files be the same after updating from 10.04 to 12.04?

Thank you.\nEDIT: Also, as I understood. only Unity is available in 12.04? Can I make it look like 10.04? \n\nA: If you're doing an upgrade - your personal files, settings and applications you installed will be preserved, you won't have to reinstall them.\nIf you're doing a clean install then you will need to re-install applications.\nIn both cases it is advisable to make a full backup of your personal data.\nRegarding Unity - Ubuntu 12.04 will include so-called \"fallback mode\" which is somewhat similar to Gnome 2, though it's not identical.\nYou can see a screenshot here: https://askubuntu.com/a/113991/14564\n", "Q: Processor Virtualization support not getting detected I have Intel Core 2 Duo processor.

The family, model and stepping values listed in /proc/cpuinfo should uniquely identify the processor, but I don't know they map to Intel's spec codes.  You could always check the top of the CPU, but that would require removing and reattaching the CPU fan.\nIt is possible that your BIOS shows the virtualisation disable option unconditionally, so it might not be evidence that your CPU supports VT-x.\n", "Q: What laptop pre-loaded with Ubuntu can I get with a pointing stick?

I have 12.04 Ubuntu Studio Installed at the moment. \nOn removing a application called Terminal Emulator, I accidentally removed xfce too. As I am not very fond of xfce, I am OK with it as I can change the session to gnome 3 upon login. But session runs with occasional glitches.\nMy question is how to remove xfce completely and turn it into pure gnome system. I am aware of the way to do\napt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nBut, this is going to change the ubuntu studio, I dont want that. I just want to change my ubuntu studio to pure gnome without uninstalling ubuntu-desktop.\n\ni.e. Something like ubuntustudio-12.04-gnome build. I've looked at this Q&A:\nHow to remove xubuntu-desktop?\nThe accepted answer removes some vital software from Ubuntu Studio such as Gimp, including ubuntustudio-desktop at the end.\n\nA: Nowadays, the best method for choosing a desktop environment for Ubuntu Studio is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the Ubuntu (for GNOME) or official Ubuntu flavor (Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Ubuntu Budgie, Ubuntu Kylin, Ubuntu MATE, Xubuntu) of your choice.\n\n*Install the Ubuntu Studio Installer\n\n*Run Ubuntu Studio Installer, and choose from the options presented. Follow the instructions.\n\n\nThis method automatically prepares your audio configuration for lowlatency audio work, even if you choose not to use it.\n\nA: ubuntustudio-desktop is a metapackage, which means it's not actually the packages that make the computer work, it just gets those packages in one bundle.  sudo apt-get install lightdm will install the lightdm desktop manager, and sudo apt-get install gnome-shell will ensure that you have everything you need to run gnome.  Synaptic package manager as said above makes it easier to find the packages for things like xfce4 than Ubuntu Software Center.  Keep in mind though that in a beta release like 12.04 you will probably have \"glitches\" as part of life.

I'm using Ubuntu Precise with Gnome Shell on a Dell Latitude E6520 and I'm missing the battery status icon. When I run gnome-power-statistics then the battery info is displayed correctly so I'm sure Linux and Gnome can see the battery (So there is no ACPI problem). But there simply is no indicator icon in the gnome shell menu bar.\nIn the Power settings the combo box Show battery status in the menu bar is always empty.  I can choose between the values When battery is present, When battery is charging/in use and never but it doesn't matter what I select here, the icon never appears and when I exit the power settings and open it again then the combo box is again empty. I also used the command dconf --watch / to see what this combo box changes in the dconf settings. No output at all. So for some reason this combo box is totally broken.\nI also tried it with a completely new user with a fresh Gnome configuration. The battery status icon was there the first time I logged in but disappeared on second login.\nI also tried upgrading Gnome to the version distributed by the Gnome 3 Team, doesn't help.\nI'm out of options. Any ideas?\n\nA: Ah, found the problem. It was the system-monitor extension. It has an option Hide system icon in the Battery tab.

I currently have ubuntu as main OS but I don't want to continue with it further.I don't have CD for win 7 so I am trying other sources. \nI have downloaded EasyBCD on another system and pasted it on ubuntu. It is .exe file and is not running on ubuntu. I am not aware of any commands regarding installation and further process. :(\nSo,pls suggest what to do next,I would be very thankful. :)\n\nA: EasyBCD is a windows program.  \nAccording to the author (see comments):\n\nAuthor of EasyBCD here. You can't run it in Wine, as it has many, many dependencies on the kernel and also uses .NET. – Mahmoud Al-Qudsi\n\nThis is confirmed by looking at winehq - both results are given as \"garbage\" - which basically means those versions tested do not work.\nThus, you will need to find another route - I would strongly advise finding a licensed Windows 7 CD and then fixing your MBR through this recovery CD as per this Q&A\nHow to completely wipe Ubuntu 11.10 from HDD?\n\nA: First of all EASY BCD is a Windows application (.exe file) so installing it in Ubuntu is not a good idea. \nDeleting the Ubuntu partition will render Windows 7 unbootable as GRUB has overridden Windows Bootloader in the master Bootloader.\nBest option for you is to install EASY BCD (application you just downloaded) in your Windows 7 partition to recover Windows Bootloader. \nHere is how: \n1. Launch the EASY BCD.\n\n\n*\n\n*Select BCD DEPLOYMENT option and choose 'Install the Windows Vista/7 Bootloader to the MBR' option available in this option\n\n*Select 'Write MBR' and finish the process with a reboot.\n\n*You can now format the Ubuntu partition in Windows 7 using the Disk Management tool \nHope this helps\n\nA: You can create a recovery media from windows 7 itself. It will help if you got into any more trouble. Just search for Create a System Repair Disc in start menu and burn it to a blnk cd/dvd. The you can boot from it and do a start up repair.\n", "Q: Unable to mount Encrypted drive \nError starting job: Failed to execute child process \"cryptsetup\" (No such file or directory)\n\nAfter a system reinstall (I'm on Ubuntu 10.04), I'm having trouble accessing my second Hard Disk, when I try to mount the encrypted volume I am prompted to enter the password, when I do I receive the above error.\nAny thoughts?\n\nA: Firstly open the terminal and type\n\nsudo apt-get install cryptsetup\n\nNow retry mounting your encrypted drive.\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: Running a script after the gui has loaded I know how to run a program on boot, on login (System > Preferences > Startup Applications) or on opening a shell (.bashrc). I also did read \"execute script after desktop loaded?\". What I realized that every application added to Startup Applications extends the time until the desktop becomes usable. So I'm looking for a way to start all the \"nice to haves\" from a script (got that working) that runs after the regular startup is finished.\nI'm not fully clear how to get there. Would I use a second script that calls the first one with & (so it runs in the background) and add a wait for (a few seconds|specific event) to the first one?\n\nA: Just call sleep at the beginning of your \"nice-to-haves\" script. That shouldn't block the desktop from loading. You may also be able to speed things up on multi-core hardware by backgrounding each process.\ne.g.\nsleep 20s\n<something that takes a long time> &\n<this can now start immediately> &\n...\n\nThe two commands will run in parallel, but they'll wait for 20 seconds before starting. You can use \"m\", \"h\", or \"d\" to specify minutes, hours, or days if a few seconds isn't what you had in mind. =)\n\nA: If you're going to launch something expensive, launch it in the background with a delay.  For example\nafter 20s find-all-the-dirty-dishes &\nafter 1m find ~ -name '*~' -mtime +30 -exec rm '{}' ';'\n\nwhere you will have to implement after yourself but it can be something like this\n#!/bin/sh\nsleep \"$1\"\nshift\nexec \"$@\"\n\n", "Q: How can I get current song information I want to know how can I get the current song information (title, artist, album etc) no matter what player is running.  I saw some KDE widget can do that. \nHow can I do that? is there any standard protocol or interface to get song information?\n\nA: A simple method from the command line would be to read the output from pulseaudio to list properties of a sink input by running the following command in a terminal\npacmd list-sink-inputs\n\nBy this we can see the application that initiated a stream as well as other song properties from metatags (including artist, title, etc.) if available.\n\nA: There's no standard protocol to do that, the widget you're talking about are just handling a lot of protocols.

I am seeking a program that can encrypt a whole hard drive when Ubuntu 12.04/ Windows 7 installed on the same drive (different partitions) using a grub loader. I cannot seem to get TrueCrypt to accept this, and I am curious if there is a work around (lol) or another open source encryption program anyone may suggest?\nThanks!\n\nA: I'd recommend a self-encrypting hard drive (SED). Not perfect, but they do work, and they don't slow down your system, except for bootup (assuming you are putting the decryption key in the pre-OS-boot sequence).  These are becoming more mainstream in business/enterprise and widely available (Dell sells them as part of a system package, now, e.g.). Here's a vendor page with some info : Western Ditgal/HGST Self-Encrypting Drives. \n\nA: Truecrypt and grub don't get along.  You can use bitlocker and chainload grub from boot.ini.  Then use luks on the linux side.\n\nA: There are several commercial solutions from e.g. Symantec, but they are not cheap.\nThe simplest solution for that is to use Bitlocker.\ngreetings\n", "Q: Why does the sudo command not work in chroot? I just installed a 32-bit chroot to run on my 64-bit system. In the chroot environment, the sudo command doesn't work, it says\n\nsudo: command not found\n\nAlso, when I try the su root command, my password doesn't work (su: authentication failure). What password do they want?\nI'm quite new to Ubuntu, so actually I don't really know what I'm doing. I am just trying to follow instructions.\n\nI solved this particular problem simply by starting the chroot by the command:\nkatarina@ubuntu:~$ schroot -c oneiric_i386 -u root\n\ninstead of the one I used the first time:\nkatarina@ubuntu:~$ schroot -a\n\nI still have some other problems, but I guess that's not for this question.\n\nA: In my opinion the question is more about not understanding what chroot does.  \nIt moves the / to wherever you tell it, so there's no more /bin, /sbin, or /usr.  \nThis means you're not going to have sudo anymore since it lives in one of those directories.\n\nA: You must install sudo in the chroot'ed environment:\napt-get install sudo\n\n\nA: When you start a chroot environment, you are generally already root, so you don't need to use sudo or su root.\nIf you need to use a non-root user account, you need to create it first, and login as that user with (in the chroot)\nlogin myuser\n\nor\nsu - myuser\n\nNext, if you want to let that user to use sudo, you need to add it to the admin group into the chroot.\n\nA: There's more to it than you think to get a working chroot jail. In your example, it's because the sudo command is in /bin and not available in your new root. But just installing the base packages to the new root won't do the trick, you also need to mount a /proc, /sys and /dev for the jail, probably create a couple of symbolic nodes, definitely a tty and for most practical purposes, it probably won't work without a random too. You do that with mknod.\nNow all that sounds complicated, and to be honest, it is a bit involved. Debian based distros have a simpler way of dealing with it, namely, debootstrap, for which you can find a basic how-to tutorial in the Ubuntu help site.\n", "Q: Will Glade 3.12 work for Ubuntu 11.10 using Unity...no Gnome 3 I'm in the process of learning 'Quickly' and noticed that it only has 'Glade 3.8.0' and I like to keep all my apps fully up to date.

That looks like a polished, highly integrated solution for Android devices.\nThe Prime would be the ideal device for Ubuntu For Android since it has a powerful processor (Tegra3) capable of running a lot of processes in parallel on its 4 cores.\nDoes anyone know if Canonical or anybody else is working on supporting UFA on the ASUS Transformer Prime?\nAs far as I understand, the X11 driver is available for Tegra3 so, the biggest hurdle may be easily overcome.\n\nA: First you need to understand the Ubuntu For Android (UFA) is not to provide two operating system in android device which can be used simultaneously. Ubuntu is activated only when you connect a keyboard,mouse and display and at that moment you cannot use the device rather your device works as CPU for Ubuntu with access to android contacts and other things.\nAnd as far as I know, it will be integrated and shipped by the device manufacturer. So you can get it only on the new devices preinstalled. \n\nA: It's early days yet for Ubuntu for Android so you would have to go with the dualboot over at XDA. \n", "Q: browser without gpu support Google has an Easter egg that draws 3D graph but when I tried it out on chrome it complained about no WebGL support.

The last update was Thunderbird, Chromium and Flash player, Nothing about Firefox.\nDo you experience the same issue? How can it be corrected?\nThanks.\n\nA: Try starting Firefox from the command line to see info on what's going on during startup.  In particular, you might want to use firefox -safe-mode to see if you get a fast startup that way.  If so, then it's probably an add-on causing the delay.\nIncidentally, since someone else has suggested that a slow startup is somehow normal for Firefox, let me point out that Firefox is known to have a fast startup on 11.10.  At least, according to this Tom's Hardware testing, it beat Chrome and Opera when loading one tab.  Personally, I find the startup very swift on Precise beta2.  \n\nA: I'm not experiencing the same issue, but one thing you could try erasing your profile or try using a different one for awhile to see if it speeds things up.\nhttp://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/Profiles should be able to help you with Firefox profiles.\n\nA: I saw some problems (not error, but notice or warning) about Firefox's theme engine when start on 11.10 .\nBut I don't think that this makes it slow down too much. \nChromium is faster than Firefox (I am a fun of Firefox by the way). If you are talking about this, it seems to be normal. Try to remove unused add-ons, that may help you make it a little faster (depending to the number of add-ons)\nAnd just my opinion; may gnome theme for ff can cause it too.\n\nHave you seen Firefox Slow Performance ?

Often when I run a new application the new window shows on the second screen eventhough the mouse as well as the active window is on the main screen. How can I instruct KDE to always open new windows on the main screen?\n\nA: Try System Settings - Display and Monitor - Multiple Monitors.\nThe setting Show Unmanaged Windows on allows you to select a display or use the display the mouse pointer is on.\nI had this problem but only when I first started a session, anything I ran would always initially open on the second screen (which is a TV and usually turned off)\nIf you're having the same issue as me, I only got around it by creating a rule for the browser to save its position (Right click on title bar, advanced - special window settings - size & position, Check \"Position\", select \"Remember\")\nNow when I log in if I open the browser first, it still opens on the second screen but the rule overrides whichever insane hidden setting is taking effect and forces it back to the first desktop, subsequent windows then open on the first desktop as well.\n\nA: System Settings -> Window Behavior -> Window Behavior -> Active screen follows mouse:\n\n\nA: On KDE Plasma 5.19.4:\nSystem Settings > Window Management > Window Behaviour > Focus > Active screen follows mouse (check this option)\n\nA: All of the existing answers don't (universally) work (setting \"Active screen follows mouse\" does not solve the problem on my setup) or merely suggest workarounds. The following KWin extensions do precisely what is asked in the question:\n\n*\n\n*always open on active screen (the one with the mouse cursor): https://store.kde.org/p/1617640/\n\n\n*always open on focused screen (the one with the focused window): https://store.kde.org/p/1618008/\n\n\n*always open on primary screen (the one set in the display settings): https://store.kde.org/p/1617641\n\nA: In the \"windows behaviour\" settings, you have to enable \"Active screen follows mouse pointer\". (approximate translation from French but I'm sure you'll find it).\nThis way, by default, windows will open on the current screen. (except some rare specific apps like VLC which use the last used screen).\n\nA: None of the above worked for me on Kubuntu 18.04, but there is a workaround: new windows seem to always open on the most left monitor. So, make your main monitor the most left in \"Display and Monitor\" and new windows will open on it. At least, for me it worked.\n\nA: In System Settings -> Windows Management -> Window Rules you can add a new rule for your window position. Click to New..., open Size & Position tab, click to Screen checkbox and select Force for the monitor number which you want to be the default. Enter your rule name and save.\n", "Q: Why does Windows 7 overall performance is better than Ubuntu 11.10? I have a Intel i7 2600 processor, 8GB DDR3 RAM, nVidia GTX570 graphics card, and still Ubuntu taking 45-50 seconds to boot and 32-35 seconds to power off, while Windows 7 boots in only 20-25 seconds and shuts down in 10 seconds. Both OS has Automatic Login  enabled, and obviously I am dual-booting.\nUbuntu is slow in Pre loading stage too, and doesn't show any boot splash after installing drivers and didn't recognize my nVidia graphics card on jockey GTK, I had to add \"x swat\" repository and that didn't worked. I installed proprietary drivers through terminal (nvidia-common, nvidia-settings) in order to have 3D acceleration. But it doesn't make any difference on the speed.\nI also have a Pentium 4 PC and in that PC, Ubuntu 11.10 is way faster than windows 7 or XP with nvidia graphics card. And Preload (showing splash screen) is good.\nHere is my boot script, some words there are in Spanish because my Ubuntu is in Spanish lanuage.  \nI am not using WUBI, Ubuntu has its own partition, it is 64-bits, and Matlab 2011 has very low performance compared to Windows version.\n\nA: Ubuntu 11.10 is an extreme exception in Ubuntu versions, and it is slower than other versions. It's a version in the middle of a large transition between platforms. \nMy advise is to upgrade to 12.04 as soon as you feel comfortable with it. It's really very much faster, consumes a lot less power, and therefore is also much more quiet. In general; 12.04 is what you should want. It'll be released in less than two weeks, on Thursday 26th. \n\nA: How many cores does ubuntu see in your CPU?  I have a dual core i7, but ubuntu can see only one core.  If you have the same situation, then it is understandable for ubuntu being slower than w7. \n\nA: As much as everyone here would like to help, I think the askers question may be outside the scope of reasonable. Perhaps better to ask multiple specific questions like How can I increase my boot speed?.\nhttps://askubuntu.com/faq\n\nYou should only ask practical, answerable questions based on actual problems that you face. Chatty, open-ended questions diminish the usefulness of our site and push other questions off the front page.\nYour questions should be reasonably scoped. If you can imagine an entire book that answers your question, you’re asking too much.\n\n\nA: I actually have a Core i7 2600 with 16GB RAM running Ubuntu 11.10 (32Bit+PAE). The motherboard is an Intel DZ68DB and an Nvidia 440 GT. The booting time is about 20-25 seconds on Ubuntu 11.10, but on Windows 7 it gets up to a minute easily.\nBasically this depends a lot on the motherboard, not just the CPU or Memory. But in your case and mine we need to remember that Sandy Bridge (And Ivy Bridge) is not well supported in 11.10. In 12.04 you should see a change. There are many questions in askubuntu about the problems with Sandy Bridge that are already solved in the latest kernel (And applied in 12.04).\nI can vouch that the some weird stuff does happen every so often like the system freezes sometimes for a second or that it gets just weird when doing several activities. But for what I have been following on omgubuntu, phoronix, and the H the next Ubuntu version will solve most if not all problems related to Sandy/Ivy. So you can expect a better boot time and a better response time in general with that hardware.\nOnly 2 weeks to go for 12.04.\n\nA: If you dual boot Windows and Ubuntu(Or any other Linux) on two different partition and use O&O Defrag to analyst the drives. You can see the one with Ubuntu is horribly fragmented and locked(Unable to defragment). So if you keep defragment every week on your HDD which installed Windows, Windows boot faster.\n*Ubuntu always faster than Windows when you are using a SSD. SSD no need to defragment because it use different technology to read and write, it doesn't matter of a file placed in a thousand places.\n", "Q: How can I get GRUB to take a different OS as the default one? Question How can I get GRUB to take a different OS as the default one ? All the usual methods as explained on the ubuntu site haven't worked. The only thing I haven't tried yet is GRUB Customizer out of fear to break something.\nThe context I have multiple operating systems, among them two Ubuntu 11.10 distros. Two distinguish them, lets call them OS A and B. I first installed A, spent a lot of time setting it up the way I like it to be, an then I installed B as an OS with which I can fool around a bit. Until now, GRUB worked fine. The problem was, after installing B GRUB is now set to start B as default and I can't change it. I tried different things ( like editing some files to  change the start order and then updated GRUB via sudo update-grub), or using Startup manager(so the proposed answers askubuntu gives me for this question don' count), but nothing helped. Generally, I can't change anything in GRUB, not even other things like how long the screen with the OSes is being displayed (I wanted it to be as short as possible, but it's still at 10 seconds). All attempts to do this were done from OS A. I haven't tried GRUB Customizer because there are a lot more entries shown there that at the boot process, so I don't know whats happening with that. I also would like to remove some entries from the GRUB menu (like different kernel version of the same OS), but in GRUB Customizer I'm afraid to tick the wrong things off.\nHere is my etc/default/grub file:\n# If you change this file, run 'update-grub' afterwards to update\n# /boot/grub/grub.cfg.\n# For full documentation of the options in this file, see:\n#   info -f grub -n 'Simple configuration'\n\nGRUB_DEFAULT=14\n#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=1\nGRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\"\n\n# Uncomment to enable BadRAM filtering, modify to suit your needs\n# This works with Linux (no patch required) and with any kernel that obtains\n# the memory map information from GRUB (GNU Mach, kernel of FreeBSD ...)\n#GRUB_BADRAM=\"0x01234567,0xfefefefe,0x89abcdef,0xefefefef\"\n\n# Uncomment to disable graphical terminal (grub-pc only)\n#GRUB_TERMINAL=console\n\n# The resolution used on graphical terminal\n# note that you can use only modes which your graphic card supports via VBE\n# you can see them in real GRUB with the command `vbeinfo'\n#GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480\n\n# Uncomment if you don't want GRUB to pass \"root=UUID=xxx\" parameter to Linux\n#GRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_UUID=true\n\n# Uncomment to disable generation of recovery mode menu entries\n#GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY=\"true\"\n\n# Uncomment to get a beep at grub start\n                #GRUB_INIT_TUNE=\"480 440 1\"\n\n\nA: Everything in your grub config looks good except the very first line: GRUB_DEFAULT=14.  Do you really have 15 boot options in your Grub menu?\nYour Grub timeout settings are correct if you want the menu to appear for about 1 second.  Your comment about Grub taking 19 seconds is a bit strange... I would wager that perhaps Grub gets confused by the fact that there is no item 15 on your menu, takes a long time to decide what to do, and automatically picks the first option.  \nIn any case, look for the OS you want to boot on the menu and its position.  Then change the incorrect line.  Keep in mind that 0 refers to the first item, 1 refers to the second item, etc. \nRemember to update grub after you make the change: sudo update-grub \n\nA: Keep in mind that it is possible that you have Grub installed in more than one location.  Perhaps OS A had Grub installed to its partition and OS B installed Grub to a different location, which is now the one being used during boot.  I seem to recall during some installations having the option to use a partition (e.g. sda1) instead of the drive itself (e.g. sda).  Just a guess.\nHowever, I really wanted to add that you can also use names for the default.  I used to have a machine that I wanted to default to a specific kernel, and occasionally had to change the default since it was subject to getting renumbered during updates as it got pushed further down the list.\nAs another example of this, on the machine I am on now, there is a line in my grub that I used to use when I was playing StarCraft II a lot:\nGRUB_DEFAULT=\"Windows 7 (loader) (on /dev/sda2)\"\n\nBy using the quotes and the name as it appears on the grub menu, you might be able to save yourself the occasional renumbering of your default choice.\n", "Q: Titlebar of the windows is not showing up I can't see the titlebar anymore.

It has a healthy 8GB of RAM and 12GB of swap space. Often, as my problems have gotten larger, I exceed all of the available RAM. Rather than crashing (which would be preferred), it seems Ubuntu starts loading everything into swap, including Unity and any open terminals.

I would like to ask a very basic question but I have never thought about it before.\nWell, when someone installs an application from terminal, he has to add the repository first, right? On the other side, when someone installs an application from the Ubuntu Software Center, is the repository then added automatically?\nI am asking those questions to figure out this: When I run update and then upgrade, will this application be upgraded or not? Is the result same in two options?\n\nA: Repositories have to be added and enabled only once. You likely see instructions like:\n\nAdd the Stable Bumblebee Releases PPA and install Bumblebee using the proprietary NVIDIA driver:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:bumblebee/stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia\n\n\nAdding a repository has to be done only once. In the above example, the bumblebee program is not available in the default repositories, hence you have to enable this third-party repository (using the add-apt-repository program).\nThe second line, apt-get update, refreshes the package lists to retrieve the latest information about the packages. If a new repository was added, this will inform the database of new packages from this repository.\nThe third command, apt-get install ... is equivalent to selecting a package for installation.\nThe Ubuntu software center allows you to install software that is available in the repositories. The result is no different as when you \"manually\" install packages using the apt-get install command. You will still get updates and such from the repositories.\nFinally, you may encounter instructions like \"download foo.deb and install it with sudo dpkg -i foo.deb\". In this case, you won't receive upgrades unless the author of the package makes modifications to the system configuration (like Google Chrome).\n\nA: Software center is a front-end UI of the apt tool. When you install a software from the software center, it's installed with apt. So, when you do an apt-get update and a apt-get upgrade you'll update the software you've installed from the center.\nFurthermore, if the software center have to add a repository automatically, i'll be also used by apt, because as I said, the software center use apt.\nwhen you install something with apt you don't always have to add a repository, if you type apt-get install vlc it'll install vlc but you haven't added a repository.\n\nA: That is not really accurate, but not far off.\nThe Ubuntu Software Center is a set of repositories. Many, many applications are already in the repositories. To install those you do not need to add a new repository.\nWhen one installs an application that has its own repository (virtualbox) and you want to use command line apt-get or the software center you need to have the repository added, key added and then update (apt-get update). There are also additional repositories that have large numbers of applications like playdeb which has many, many games in their repository.\nAfter that you can install from a repository using either the GUI software center or command line apt-get install xxx\nYou can also install a .deb file using dpkg or other installs can be done using a binary installer or even just uncompressing the binary files.\nSummary:\n\n\n*\n\n*Not all applications have to be installed from a repository\n\n*Many thousands and applications are already in repositories pre-configured\non initial install\n\n*You can add repositories and then use either GUI or command line to install applications from them\n\n*You can install programs that are not in repositories by using .deb files, binaries or compressed files\n\n*Applications installed from a repository will be, if possible, upgraded when you run the update and upgrade commands. One caveat is after a distribution upgrade 11.10 to 12.04 for example)... in that case you would need to re-add any repositories you have previously added.\n\n\nA: The only really big difference between installing things from the Software Center or another gui and doing it from the command line is when things go wrong.\nIn most guis,installation error messages are hidden and they just give you a general message that it didn't work.  When you do it from the command line, you see all the messages that are generated.  Often, this information can be used to fix the problem or it will tell you why you probably don't want to fix it.  E.g. installing the package would break or uninstall other packages that are already installed.\nSometimes, a package fails to install just because one of its dependencies is not installed (and the regular install doesn't automatically fix that like most do).  When this happens, you can often just install the missing package first and then your install will succeed.\nAlso, apt-get will inform you of other associated packages that are \"recommended\" along with your package, so you can look them up and see if you want any of them.  \nIt also reports on any packages that were installed previously that are probably not needed any more and tells you how to remove them.\nYou shouldn't add/delete packages from either of these last two steps without carefully reviewing the packages involved, but it's usually safe.\nIn Ubuntu 12.04, newly installed apps get added to the launcher by default, but this only happens for apps installed using the Software Center.\n", "Q: Is it possible to set a download limit in the Ubuntu Software Center? Is it possible to set a download limit in the Ubuntu Software Center?\nAlso, is there is a way to download applications installation files for offline use?\n\nA: Setting the bandwith limit on apt-get which is still what Ubuntu software Center and Synaptic use to get packages (I believe) is fairly simple.  If you go into the /etc/apt/apt.conf.d directory you can add Acquire::http::Dl-Limit \"70\"; (\"70\" being the kb/s) in whichever parts of apt you choose.\n\nA: You can download packages without installing them by using apt-get's -d option, used like this: sudo apt-get install -d packagename downloads the files for packagename. You can then run sudo apt-get install packagename offline to install the package. As far as putting restrictions, I don't know what you mean. You can make an account non-administrator so it prompts for a password of another user to install software.\n", "Q: How can I use two video cards to power three screens?

I am about to expand my Ubuntu partition, so I think I should make a backup of the current one in case something goes wrong.\nIs there some software to make a bootable USB and recovery image?\n\nA: Remastersys is the tool to go for. It allows you to make an ISO image of your system including if you want your data. You can than create a bootable USB stick. My last experience was that the live usb/cd didnt work, but installation worked. In conclusion a perfect toll for your needs and or if you want to transfer a system to a friends computer.\n\nA: This is rather basic, but it's guaranteed to work, provided you have an external hard drive with enough free space to hod your entire internal drive (including free space)\nTo Backup\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into a live CD/USB environment.\n\n*Determine the name of your internal hard drive. Probably, it's /dev/sda, but you should check somewhere to be absolutely sure. I use GParted for this purpose.\n\n*Mount your external drive somewhere. I'll use /media/external in these instructions. Be sure that your internal drive is not mounted!\n\n*Choose one of the following, depending on your situation. Both make use of dd to image your entire disk, not just individual partitions (you can also use this technique to migrate to an entirely different hard drive of the same size or larger):\n\n\n*\n\n*If your external drive's filesystem can handle a single file the size of your entire internal drive, you can use the simplest option:\nsudo dd if=/dev/sda of=/media/external/internal_disk.img\n\n\n*If you need compression or need to split the image file into multiple smaller files, use this more complex command (see the man pages for any commands you don't understand):\ncd /media/external\nsudo dd if=/dev/sda | bzip2 | split --bytes=2G -d - internal_disk.img.\n\nThis will first compress the contents of your disk (bzip2), then split it into 2GB chunks.\n\n\n*Your backup is complete.\n\n\nTo Restore\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into a live CD/USB environment.\n\n*Mount your external drive. I'll make the same path assumptions as I did above.\n\n*Choose the option that corresponds to the choice you made above:\n\n\n*\n\n*Just copy the image to your hard drive:\nsudo dd if=/media/external/internal_disk.img of=/dev/sda\n\n\n*Make sure that there are no other files in your backup directory that have names beginning the same as your backup chunks. Then:\ncd /media/external\ncat internal_disk.img.* | bunzip2 | sudo dd of=/dev/sda\n\n\n\n*Reboot. You're finished.\n\n\nA: I made a small research;\nThe only Backup tool with ext4 support seems to be \"FSArchiver\".\nSee more at http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/How_To_Backup_Operating_Systems#Create_Partition_Backup_-_FSArchiver_Method\n", "Q: How to add EXTRA_CFLAGS to indigo eclipse cdt?

If necessary and if you don't need your data urgently for your thesis or for a customer, take a nap, sleep one night and come back to your drive when the pressure has fallen.\n\n*Second, create a copy of your drive using dd (maybe ask a good friend to be sure you are not mixing the if and of parameters). NEVER use a recovery tool directly on the drive from which you are trying to recover the data. You could lose your last chance to recover it. For that, you will need a drive bigger than the drive you try to recover. 1TB is quite big, and might be expensive for you to buy a new drive. In that case, maybe borrow a drive from a friend or wait 6 months until you save the money and/or until the drives are cheaper. If you give up now and format your drive, you might regret it in 6-12 months.\n\n*Third, as suggested by dadexix86, give testdisk and photorec a chance (depending on the filesystem you have on your drive and the type of files you are trying to recover).

If you use bash (which is the default for the terminal in Ubuntu), you would edit your .bashrc file to have the two lines:\nPATH=/usr/racket/bin:$PATH\nexport PATH\n\nIf your .bashrc already has a PATH setting, then you need to add /usr/racket/bin to it.  For example, I already have a PATH setting that looks like: PATH=~/bin:$PATH.  I would then change it to: PATH=/usr/racket/bin:~/bin:$PATH.  The colons act as separators while $PATH will include whatever your default environment PATH is.  Bash will look in the locations in the order listed, so actually I would probably prefer PATH=~/bin:/usr/racket/bin:$PATH so that my personal scripts (which I put in ~/bin) would be picked over anything else.    \nIf you don't have a .bashrc in your home directory, make one using your favorite text editor with the two lines above.  \nThe modification won't take effect until you open a new terminal or you type source .bashrc in the current terminal. \n\n*Add drRacket to the \"open with\" submenu of the right-click menu.

For example:\n$ xmodmap\nxmodmap:  up to 4 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):\n\nshift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)\nlock        Caps_Lock (0x42)\ncontrol     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x69)\nmod1        Alt_L (0x40),  Alt_R (0x6c),  Meta_L (0xcd)\nmod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)\nmod3      \nmod4        Super_L (0x85),  Super_R (0x86),  Super_L (0xce),  Hyper_L (0xcf)\nmod5        ISO_Level3_Shift (0x5c),  Mode_switch (0xcb)\n\nThe Super_L and Super_R keysyms correspond to the Win keys on your keyboard.\n", "Q: Upgrade the distribution, or reinstall the system? 12.04 is coming soon, and I was wondering whether it is better to upgrade or completely reinstall the system. My home is in different partition from the rest, so complete reinstall would be easy to do.\nSo, are there any differences between upgrading the distribution and reinstalling the system*?\n* Assuming the same packages are selected during reinstall.\n\nA: I'd go for the upgrade. You'll receive a pop-up in about two weeks with the very question and all you have to do is click OK and enter your password. Upgrading gives you an identical system as you get with a full install, but the advantage of upgrading is that you don't loose installed programs and your configuration files.\nOnly if you've been making a mess of your install and want to get rid of things that you broke experimenting, then a full install is advisable.\nForget what you read about Windows upgrades and a full install being better. Upgrading Linux works in a different way.\nAlthough all your files should be fine during an upgrade, always make sure you have a backup of you personal files before upgrading/install on a different disk/dvd/usb stick/...\n\nA: If you have a separate /home and /boot partitions, you'll be able to do the following trick: free some space for new installation, install new system into that space, specify old /home and /boot partitions for new system, do a backup of /home, create the list of installed packages in old system. At this point you'll be able to dual-boot in both old and new systems. Do upgrade of the old system and do the installation of packages according to the created list in new system. At this point you'll be having a two versions of environment to choose from - old upgraded and new with the same set of packages as the old. Try them both then decide which to wipe, which to live on.\n\nA: Yesterday I have upgraded to 12.04 myself from internet not from iso-file.\nAdvantage: you keep all you indivual stuff and configurations\nDisadvantage: it needs much more time that a new installation. But you can stop the process and continue where you have stopped.\n\nA: I would opt for upgrade if everything is free of bugs. It would worth not starting from scratch considering the various updates and apps which you probably have added to your system with time in the past. \nThis is not actually technical, isn't it?\n", "Q: How do I covert videos for a Nokia mobile using Arista transcoder?

I did that before and now this system is working in the vmware player. However, this is not a partition, but the big file with system. I don't think that this even possible, because virtualized systems can use only their own hardware components (that is virtualized) and when you'll change them in real system (when you launching windows in ubuntu) - you won't be able to login back to the real system. Because registry of the windows system will have modified drivers for hardware devices (that can be used in vm).\n\nA: With VirtualBox (installable via the SoftwareCenter in Ubuntu) it is possible under Windows as well as Ubuntu to install your preferred OS into a virtual maschine.\nPresently, VirtualBox runs on Windows, Linux, Macintosh, and Solaris hosts and supports a large number of guest operating systems including but not limited to Windows (NT 4.0, 2000, XP, Server 2003, Vista, Windows 7), DOS/Windows 3.x, Linux (2.4 and 2.6), Solaris and OpenSolaris, OS/2, and OpenBSD. \n", "Q: Exact field meaning of /proc/stat everyone\nI need to know the exact meaning of every field in /proc/stat file.

I am not sure if either i accidentally let my password out there somewhere, or maybe I have a keylogger. I'm currently installing ClamAV to scan for viruses. Any help would be absolutely appreciated.\n\nA: \nAre there keylogger viruses that affect Ubuntu?\n\nYes, there are, but the good news is that it is very hard to get infected, because of the way software installs (you need a root access). If you do not install some dodgy software, you are safe.\nWhat most likely happened in your case, is someone ordered while you were away (and you didn't lock your computer).\n\nA: Your problem may be the result of a hack into other third party servers which have your password,credit card info etc. \nIt doesn't have to be a hack of your own machine.\n", "Q: Inconsistency between date-time in terminal and clock I can't figure out why I have 5 hours difference between GUI clock and date command in terminal.

I have trim enabled and working but i would still like to get it on my hdd. Do i have to uninstall/reinstall boinc and if yes how do i install it at /home folder? Thanks in advance :)\n\nA: There's no need to install application files to your HDD - as any other program files they're very rarely written to. What you need to do is to make BOINC keep its data files on the SSD. From their website:\n\nWhat the installer does\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Puts the BOINC binaries (boinc, boinccmd and boincmgr) in /usr/bin .\n  \n*Creates a configuration directory /etc/boinc-client ...\n  \n*Creates the working directory /var/lib/boinc-client/ for BOINC data files and the slots and projects directories. Also creates links from this directory to the files in /etc/boinc-client\n  \n\nSo what I would do is to install BOINC first, then move /var/lib/boinc-client/ to somewhere on your SSD (taking care to keep permissions) and create a symlink at /var/lib/boinc-client/ pointing to the new location\n(alternatively you may check the configs in /etc/boinc-client and see if it's possible to change the data directory from there)\nUPDATE: How to create a symlink:\n\n\n*\n\n*make sure BOINC is not running\n\n*move the directory:\nsudo mv /var/lib/boinc-client /home/boinc-working-dir\n\n\n*create the symlink:\nsudo ln -s /home/boinc-working-dir /var/lib/boinc-client\n\n", "Q: What is the user-level command to suspend (This was previously asked, but the solution no longer works under 11.10.)\nIn Ubuntu 11.10 any user can suspend the machine from the power menu in the top right of the screen without needing root privileges. How can I suspend as a normal user from a command line?\n\nA: There is a new answer to this at How can I suspend/hibernate from command line?. You can suspend your machine (if it supports that) without any password by typing\ndbus-send --system --print-reply \\\n    --dest=\"org.freedesktop.UPower\" \\\n    /org/freedesktop/UPower \\\n    org.freedesktop.UPower.Suspend\n\nThis works for me on Ubuntu 12.04.

Perhaps the problem you were having has been corrected in updates.\n\nA: Most functions in system dbus will need root power. So this should work well (tested on Ubuntu 14.04):\ndbus-send --session --dest=com.canonical.Unity \\\n /com/canonical/Unity/Session \\\n com.canonical.Unity.Session.Shutdown\n\nThis may work too:\ndbus-send --session --dest=org.gnome.SessionManager \\\n /org/gnome/SessionManager \\\n org.gnome.SessionManager.Shutdown\n\nInstall d-feet tool and browse DBus for all available options.\n", "Q: How do I get a Lexmark X2600 printer working?

The version of okular on my ubuntu 10.10 is 0.11.2, while the website shows the latest version to be 0.14  \nMy question is - how do I get the latest version?\nMy update manager does not show any updates for okular although I dont know why.\nIf there is a .deb package for okular 0.14 that I can install please let me know. I wish to avoid compiling it from source myself.\n\nA: To have the latest version of Okular you have 3 options:\nEasy Option - Install the latest Kubuntu. Either 11.10 or wait for 12.04. The reason for this will be explained in the other Options.\nIntermediate Option - Download the DEB Package of Okular and all of it's dependencies and the dependencies of those dependencies until you have literally downloaded KDE in pieces just to install that since the latest Okular depends on libraries and other packages that also depend on others that need to be a specific version or newer. This versions are not compatible with an older Ubuntu so you would have to start downloading a lot of packages. This in most cases will not work and waste your time since at some point a package might say \"Hey I need a newer kernel version of autotool, autoconf, make... and so on.\" So your chances of having it work there are very difficult.\nDifficult Option - Compile the whole thing from scratch. This option will take more experience and a heck of more time to do and at the end it will not guarantee that it will work on the kernel used in Ubuntu 10.10 with the versions of the tools provided in 10.10.\nTo make matters worse, 10.10 has been discontinued. So try the option everyone has suggested (Install 12.04). If you do not want a heavy system then install Lubuntu or Xubuntu and then install Okular from there but just so you know, you can install Okular very easy and with less download time in Ubuntu 12.04 since it already comes with the QT libraries for it. No need to download them when trying to download Okular.\n\nA: You should try kubuntu 12.04 as it is pretty stable and has the latest release of okular. I have used it since beta1 and there has been no issues as crashes. Moreover the bug in the kernel which overheats the laptops is resolved in 3.2 series of the kernel.\n", "Q: Problem with Ajax in Firefox Browser This is probably a very basic problem, but I am still at a basic skill level. I have started practicing with Javascript and Ajax recently. I use Ubuntu on a Virtual Box virtual computer. I have a LAMP installed on Ubuntu. I use Firefox.

This permission problem is by design.  \nIf you used ln -s /var/www/Development ~/Development apache by default won't follow that link.\n\nA: Be sure to place all data you are trying to access somewhere within /var/www on your server's filesystem, as /var/www is the default root directory for the webserver.\n\nA: Re the above permission suggestions, I am trying the scripts with a WAMP server now.

I was always returned to the grub>  menu on reboot. \nFinally, however, I've gotten things working.  I had to do two things:\nsudo apt-get install grub2 \nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\nI did the install of grub2 because dpkg -l | grep grub did not show anything but grub2-common -- it was missing the grub2 components that apt-cache search grub returned.   This might have been optional, but based on bug reports and workarounds I was seeing, I went ahead an installed the grub2 package available from the updated 12.04 system repositories.\nFor the grub-install, I chose the disk I was loading from (this can be found with fdisk -l or df, for example).  The partition number was not needed  (i.e., I chose the disk sda instead of disk+partition sda1). \nI didn't run grub-update ; this worked immediately on reboot. \nIn order to run the commands, I did have to boot into my system, with only slight variations from the OP's example:\nAssuming /dev/sda1 as the target:\ngrub>\nroot (hd0,1)  # \"1\" matches the partition number\nlinux /vmlinuz root=/dev/sda1 ro  #again, modify for the drive/partition \ninitrd /initrd.img\nboot\n\nThe grub menu  autocomplete was helpful for these options.

I thought bash_profile, bash_login or profile in absence of those two get executed first before bashrc. \n\n*Was in this case my terminal a non-login shell?\n\n*If so, why when doing su after the terminal and putting the password it did not execute profile where I had also set the exports mentioned above?\n\n\nA: You can check if your Bash shell is started as a login-shell by running:\nshopt login_shell\n\nIf the reply is off you are not running a login shell.\nRead the Bash manual's invocation section on how Bash reads (or does not read) different configuration files.\nExcerpt from man bash:\n\nWhen bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a\n  non-interactive shell  with  the --login  option,  it  first  reads\n  and executes commands from the file /etc/profile, if that file\n  exists.  After reading that file, it  looks  for  ~/.bash_profile, \n  ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile,  in  that  order, and reads and\n  executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable.\n\nsu on the other hand also does not start a login shell by default, you have to tell it to do so by using the --login option.\n\nA: I think it is worth mentioning that you can change the default of gnome-terminal to use a login shell (ie. bash -l) by editing the profile preferences. \ngo to Edit -> Profile Preferences -> Title and Command tab\ncheck the \"Run command as a login shell\" option\n\nA: ~/.bash_profile is only sourced by bash when started in login mode. That is typically when you log in at the console (Ctrl+Alt+F1..F6), connect via ssh, or use sudo -i or su - to run commands as another user.\nWhen you log in graphically, ~/.profile will be specifically sourced by the script that launches gnome-session (or whichever desktop environment you're using). So ~/.bash_profile is not sourced at all when you log in graphically.\nWhen you open a terminal, the terminal starts bash in (non-login) interactive mode, which means it will source ~/.bashrc.\nThe right place for you to put these environment variables is in ~/.profile, and the effect should be apparent next time you log in.\nSourcing ~/.bash_profile from ~/.bashrc is the wrong solution. It's supposed to be the other way around; ~/.bash_profile should source ~/.bashrc.\nSee DotFiles for a more thorough explanation, including some history of why it is like it is.\n(On a side note, when installing openjdk via apt, symlinks should be set up by the package, so that you don't really need to set JAVA_HOME or change PATH)\n\nA: If you open a terminal or run su the shell is not executed as a login shell but as a normal interactive shell. So it reads ~/.bashrc but not ~/.bash_profile. You can run su with the -l option to make it run your shell as a login shell.\nWhen you are working with a GUI the shell is usually never run as a login shell so it's usually fine to put all yout stuff in ~/.bashrc.\n\nA: TL;DR\nIn classical recommended ubuntu setup, ~/.bash_profile gets evaluated only in specific occasions. And it makes sense.\nPut your stuff in ~/.bashrc, it'll get evaluated everytime.\nOk, I want to understand, why does this make sense ?\nKeypoints to understand what is going on:\n\n\n*\n\n*all processes on linux have and uses environment variables\n\n*environment variables are inherited\n\n*thus setting them once on the father of all your process is enough\n(especially if it requires some computation time.)\n\n*the father of all your process is typically launched after you \nlog in on your device (give your credentials).\n\n*there are things you might want to do only once when you log in on\nyour computer (check for new mail for instance...).\n\n\nSo \"login\" time is typically:\n\n\n*\n\n*In console mode, when you login (with Ctrl-Alt F1) or through ssh,\nas the shell will be the father of all process, it'll load your \n~/.bash_profile.\n\n*In graphic mode, when you open your session, the first process \n(gnome-session for classical ubuntu) will be in charge to read\n.profile.\n\n\nOk, so where to put my stuff ?\nIt's rather complex, the full story is here. But here is a run down\nthat is pretty common for ubuntu users. So considering that:\n\n\n*\n\n*you use bash shell,\n\n*you have a ~/.bash_profile and follow the recommendation to add \nthe loading of ~/.bashrc in your ~/.bash_profile so as to get \nat least one file that gets evaluated whatever is the invocation \nmecanism.\n\n\nThis is a quick suggestion of where to put things.\n\n\n*\n\n*~/.bashrc  (Gets evaluated in all occasion, provided you follow the recommendation)   \nFor fast-evaluation environment variable and code for your \nuser-only and bash-only command-line usage (aliases for \ninstance). bashism are welcome.\nIt gets loaded on itself upon:\n\n\n*\n\n*make a new shell window/pane in graphical sessions.\n\n*calling bash\n\n*screen new pane or tab. (not tmux !)\n\n*any bash instance in a graphical console client \n(terminator/gnome-terminal...) if you don't tick \noption \"run command as login shell\".\n\n\nAnd it will get loaded in all the other occasion thanks to the prior recommendation.\n\n*~/.bash_profile  (Gets evaluated in specific occasion only)  \nFor slow-evaluation environment variable and code for your user-only and console-session processes. \nbashism are welcome.\nIt gets loaded on:\n\n\n*\n\n*console login (Ctrl-Alt F1), \n\n*ssh logins to this machine,\n\n*tmux new pane or windows (default settings), (not screen !)\n\n*explicit calls of bash -l, \n\n*any bash instance in a graphical console client \n(terminator/gnome-terminal...) only if you tick \noption \"run command as login shell\".\n\n\n*~/.profile  (Gets evaluated only in graphical-session)\nFor slow-evaluation environment variables and with no-bashism\nfor your user-only and all graphical-session processes.

I have a CA certificate that I use to connect to a WPA2 Enterprise wireless network.\nWhere within my home folder should I store the .crt file? I don't see anything in the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard that suggests what I should do.\n\nA: Note: The question was edited a while after I answered, adding the point about the 'non-administrative' user, etc, but this answer is one alternative way of doing it. \n\nThere is no specific location in the users's home folder that is officially designated for .crt files, and none appears to be mentioned in the LSB (Linux Standard Base) or the FHS (Filesystem Hierachy Standard) if the specifications are examined at the Linux Foundation.\nHowever, system-wide there is an official location specified by Debian, and adhered to by Ubuntu, which is explained in the packages documentation for ca-certificates. If you open the file /usr/share/doc/ca-certificates/README.Debian, this notice is presented:\n\nIf you want to install local certificate authorities to be implicitly\n  trusted, please put the certificate files as single files ending with\n  “.crt“ into “/usr/local/share/ca-certificates” and re-run\n  “update-ca-certificates”\n\ni.e. this means that the certificate must end with .crt, and that in order to install your certificate and update the database you have to run:\nsudo cp /home/mike/ra.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates\nsudo update-ca-certificates\n\nThis is the only official line that I know of, and more information is available at man update-ca-certificates and in the Ubuntu manpages online.\n\nA: According to the this documantation, you can store certificate under /etc/ssl/cert directory.

It will reboot to the sign-in page. I have been using sudo shutdown -h now to shut down, but is it any way to put this into the program so ask to shutdown it will without going to terminal?\n\nA: The shutdown and reboot options can only be used by a non-privileged user if they are the only user logged in to the system.  Chances are that your system thinks that there is another user on the system.\nYou can get a list of the active sessions using the ck-list-sessions command:\n$ ck-list-sessions \nSession2:\n    unix-user = '1000'\n    realname = 'James Henstridge'\n    seat = 'Seat1'\n    session-type = ''\n    active = TRUE\n    x11-display = ':0'\n    x11-display-device = '/dev/tty7'\n    display-device = ''\n    remote-host-name = ''\n    is-local = TRUE\n    on-since = '2012-04-05T23:36:58.278097Z'\n    login-session-id = '1234567890'\n\nIf you see more than one session listed, then this is the reason why the shutdown and reboot options fail and you get returned to the login screen instead.\nI once had a problem where ConsoleKit believed that one of the daemons running on the system represented a user session and causing this problem, so that could be your problem.\nAlternatively, if you've logged in multiple times consider logging out of your other sessions before trying to use the shutdown or reboot options.\n\nA: What is the reason makes your Ubuntu not shutdown with buttons?\nTry repairing your Desktop Env. from software center.

I also read that it takes up a lot of the PC's speed.  I am only on this computer and that is all I have.  Do I really need this desktop sharing feature?\nThanks.\n\nA: No, you don't need desktop sharing.\nAlso,\nIf you're looking for a non-terminal solution to see processes like Windows task manager, use [ALT]+[F2], then type 'gnome-system-monitor' without the quotes. Pick the second tab. Under view, you may want to choose to see 'My processes', or 'All processes'. However, many processes are used by the system so tread carefully.\n\nA: Short answer: No.\nSlightly longer answer: desktop sharing is only used if you want to view or control one computer from another computer.  Since you only have one computer, you couldn't even use desktop sharing.\n", "Q: How to change the default programs that are associated with every new user that is created?

The FAT table has only space for 4 entries, if you want more than 4 partitions, you create an extended partition (sda4) in your case. Such an extended partition has its own partition table in turn. Partition sda5 and sda6 are located inside sda4. Think of it as a container keeping partions.\nPartition sda1, 2 and 3 are called primary partitions, they directly use a 'FAT-slot'.\nRemounting sda5 shouldn´t take very long; the timestamp to the next line is probably subsecond, but you cut those from your sniplet. The timestamps only reliably show the start of a certain action.\nCheck this thread to further analyse what takes the most time during boot.\n", "Q: Trying different flavors of Ubuntu from a USB drive Is it possible to have a dual boot of different Ubuntu versions?

First, boot from your Ubuntu LiveCD, and choose \"Try Ubuntu\"; let it continue until you get the default Live desktop.  From the Dash, open a terminal and enter the command:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nThis is to find out the partition to which you have installed Ubuntu.  It'll be sdXY, where X is the drive: it'll be a letter such as a or b; and Y is the number that has been given to the partition on that drive: it'll be a number.  Find your Ubuntu partition there, if you can.  You need to know X and Y.  (If you can't tell which is the right partition, you can open GParted from the Dash to get a graphical view of your partitions, and maybe figure it out from there.)\nOnce you know that, then enter the command:\nsudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt\n\nwhere X and Y are the partition that you found in the previous step.  For example, if your Ubuntu partition is sda1, you'll enter \"sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\".  This is to mount the partition so that you can work with files on it.\nNow you need to reinstall grub to that partition.  If you're running Ubuntu 11.04 or later, enter this command:\nsudo grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/boot /dev/sdX\n\nwhere X is the partition (a, b, c, etc.) that you obtained above: note that it does not take a number this time.\nIf your version of Ubuntu is older than 11.04, then enter this command instead:\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sdX\n\nThis will reinstall the Ubuntu grub you had been using before.

Most of the time, this is easy, but /home is used by so many processes that it can't be unmounted without first killing all those processes.\nSo, the thing I'm looking for is a way to boot Ubuntu, without mounting /home, so I can back up the not-mounted /dev/sda6 partition. Is that possible?\nTo be clear, it would be nice if this special boot could be 'one-time-only'. So I'm not looking for ways to change /etc/fstab in such way that /dev/sda6 won't be mounted. That's because that would require me to change /etc/fstab twice each time just to make a backup.\nI'm aware of the fact that there are other backup solutions available, such as deja-dup. I'd like to use partclone, though.\n\nA: *\n\n*You need to boot to single-user mode or recovery mode holding the shift button, after the computer starts. Then you can drop to root shell, so your home folder will be /root and not /home/username. Here you can freely unmount the /home partition, and do anything you would like.\n\n*Use a live CD/USB to create the backup.\n\n", "Q: why boinc now on ubuntu 12.04 just run 2 tasks? i use to have when i have the computer turn on and was idle having more than 2 tasks running at same time.. but now this is not happens and it is enable at maximum of 2 tasks at same time, i don know why.\nalso i was able 2 do that on ubuntu 11.10 not sure if is the same using boinc on ubuntu 11.10.\nso why this happens?\nand how can i set up boinc 2 run more than just 2 tasks at same time in ubuntu 12.04 beta? \n\nA: The number of simultaneous tasks depends on the number of CPU cores you have. A quad-core CPU will run 4 tasks (and an extra 5th task if you have a GPU), a dual-core will run 2, etc.\nEach task runs on each CPU core, and there is little point in running additional tasks beyond your CPU core count: they won't run any faster, and might run slower due to polling/switching.\n\nA: Same thing happened for me on 2 different 4-core Xeons, and a 6-core AMD Phenom. Turns out there is a setting in /var/lib/boinc-client/global_prefs.xml:\n<max_cpus>2</max_cpus>\n\nAfter changing that to 4 resp. 6, and sudo service boinc-client restart, all my cores were used.\n", "Q: How does the fglrx package's version relate to AMD's version numbers, like Catalyst 12.3?

How can I find the (better-known) official version number, like 12.3, for the fglrx package in Ubuntu's repository?\nCan I do this without needing to install the package?\n\nA: Unofficial AMD Linux Driver Wiki has the driver version on the release pages. e.g. Catalyst 12.3:\nRevision Number: 12.3 (8.951)\n\n\nAlternatively the Catalyst RSS Feed for Microsoft Windows also contains the driver information.\nCatalyst 12.3 released for Windows.

When I got to this step:\n\nI was prompted to choose a logical or a primary partition.\nI've never seen this dialog box before -- before it just told me to choose the mount point and the format.\nShould I choose logical or primary?  The default is logical.\n\nA: I think the explanation below is too basic for the OP, but I think it could be useful for a beginner.\nThat choice between \"primary\" and \"logical\" has always seemed confusing to me, because the terms are not alternatives (logically, I mean).\nFor a clear definition of the terms - there is a good answer here.\nThe difference between \"primary\" and \"logical\" is imposed by the limits of the MBR partition scheme, where a drive can only contain 4 partitions. When such partitions are created on a such derive, they are called \"primary\". In order to go above that limit, there is the \"extended\" partition, which is different from the primary in that it is not a partition on which you can put things and boot from it, but a sort of container for other partitions, a sort of virtual \"drive\" which can include more than 4 partitions.\nIn layman's words: when a partition is created simply on a drive (in a MBR partition-scheme), it is called \"primary\", when it is created within an extended partition, it is called \"logical\".\nAll that is rather clear.\nWhat about the confusion?  There is no confusion when partitioning with Gparted or similar tools which provide a choice between creating primary or extended partitions: we are not asked whether we want \"logical\" ones, because we need an extended one before having a logical one, and when we create a partition within an extended one, the new partition can only be logical.\nThe real choice is between primary or extended, and that's what we see in a partitioning tool.\nThe GUI tool in the question is an installer, not a partitioning tool, and the choice it provides can be misleading: if we select \"primary\", that will result in what the terms says; but if we select \"logical\", it will create an extended partition containing one logical partition.\nThat GUI doesn't say anything about \"extended\" partitions, we are supposed to know that a logical partition can only be inside an extended one, etc. But the fact that it doesn't ask if we want more than one logical partition within that extended one, and simply creates one logical that fills the entire extended partition is confusing to me. I don't understand what the use of that could be.\n\nA: The short answer \"it does not matter much\". \nMBR partitioning scheme allows you to have up to 4 partitions on a drive, one of those partitions can be an \"extended partition\", which acts as a container for any number of \"logical partitions\". The partitions which are not inside the extended partition are called \"primary partitions\".\nThere's no difference in how they function or anything. So, if you don't have specific reasons, just go with the default choice.\n", "Q: How to get a live cd to auto install software into ubuntu I should note, I used Active iso in windows 7 to burn the disc (Samurai-WTF) I am required to load into ubuntu to run penetration testing..ANYWAY, I am using a virtual machine..latest version of ubuntu 10.11 and cannot get the software to run.. is it the iso burner?

My understanding (I'm not sure I'm getting this all right) is that if one uses Trim on an encrypted SSD, it defeats some of the security benefits, because the drive will write zeros to empty space (as files are deleted).\nSee: http://www.askubuntu.com/questions/115823/trim-on-an-encrypted-ssd\nAnd: http://asalor.blogspot.com/2011/08/trim-dm-crypt-problems.html\nMy question is: From the perspective of the performance of the SSD and the functioning of Trim, would it therefore be better to simply zero out the SSD, before setting up an encrypted system, rather than writing random data to the drive, with urandom, as one usually does?\nWould this basically leave one with the same level of security anyway? And more importantly, would it better enable the Trim functionality to work as intended, with the encrypted SSD?\n\nA: The linked article only seems to indicate that an attacker can see what sectors are unused ( who cares? ) and complain about trim making recovering deleted files impossible ( having nothing to do with encryption ), so no, there is no security problem.\nWriting to the whole SSD wears it out and kills its performance, so you don't want to do that.  Enabling trim may recover from that by effectively undoing your initial write, so that write is just a waste of time ( that shortens the life off the disk ).\n", "Q: Black Flash Player Screen in YouTube in Firefox on ubuntu 11.10 I have been unable to view any videos online since the latest Adobe Flash Player update.

You can do this with a fairly minimal /etc/X11/xorg.conf file.  For example, on my system it consists of only:\nSection \"Device\"\n        Identifier      \"ATI Technologies Inc Juniper [Radeon HD 5700 Series]\"\n        Driver          \"ati\"\n        Option          \"monitor-HDMI-0\" \"DELL U2311H [1]\"\n        Option          \"monitor-DVI-1\"  \"DELL U2311H [2]\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n        Identifier      \"DELL U2311H [1]\"\n        Option          \"LeftOf\"        \"DVI-1\"\n        Option          \"Primary\"       \"true\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n        Identifier      \"DELL U2311H [2]\"\nEndSection\n\nThis configures the two screens to span with the one connected to the HDMI-0 output as the primary and left of the output connected to DVI-1.  With this video card/monitor combination the resolution gets detected correctly.  If the best mode is not automatically picked, you might need to specify the PreferredMode option in the relevant monitor section.\nFull documentation can be found in the xorg.conf manual page.\n", "Q: how to chat between 2 ubuntu machines in network?

That is a nice idea, but the disadvantage of a simple nc -l -p 1234 and nc ip.ad.dr.ess 1234 is that text that is being typed gets overwritten by the received messages. Note that by \"netcat\", I refer to the traditional \"swiss army knife\" netcat, not the BSD one. netcat-traditional is not installed by default, so do so. You then might want to change the default netcat program using sudo update-alternatives --config netcat.\nThe basics of netcat is that you open a port that can receive a single TCP connection. When data is received, it's printed to standard output. Standard input gets sent to the other side. In a terminal, standard input and standard output are often displayed in one terminal which makes it possible for the data to get mixed up. For example, when you begin to type \"hello\", if you receive in meantime a message, the terminal could show \"helMESSAGElo\" even if you are really sending \"hello\" to the other side.\nBy splitting opening two terminal tabs and split the view horizontally, you have can show two different shells simultaneously in one window.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open another tab (Ctrl + Shift + T or File > New tab)\n\n*Split the tabs.

That's why you could not get updated firefox when it is released. For other software if there is a update then update manager will surely notifies you. BTW you can also use Ubuntu Tweak to manage ppa and get updated software if Update manger failed to do so.....\n\nA: AFAIK there are very few portable apps that provide updates within the app but I don't think it will work for ubuntu as a whole as software installation is a privileged process. You should see How to make sure apt-get has the latest version of Software and understand ubuntu release process. So, unless freeze exception OR backported you may never get the latest software in ubuntu if that is what you want. This is probably why PPA and custom repositories comes to place.\nIf application itself states its supporting through PPA I don't think there is any harm on going that route. Softwares like google-chrome, opera etc also provide custom repositories from their own systems so you will be up-to date. As already stated there are other custom repositories as well such as medibuntu getdeb etc.\nThe only other option is building from source.\nP.S. Firefox will get latest updates directly from the repositories and you donot need the ppa. \n\nA: You might be interested in requesting Ubuntu Backports.  Starting in 12.04, there's a script called requestbackport in the ubuntu-dev-tools package that can be used to request software updates for stable releases that are available in later releases.  Please note that not all software will qualify for a backport.\n\nA: Update options in Ubuntu come in 5 flavors:\nDistributions\nGet the newest stable distribution.\nBuilt-in repositories\nEverything from main to multiverse.  If you need a newer version try a PPA\nPPAs\nA lot of interesting projects have PPAs(kind of like semi-official custom repositories)\nCustom repositories\nMedibuntu for instance\nSource\nCompile the package yourself\nThey all have advantages and disadvantages, but it seems to me your question is asking to install a newer package without a repository, ppa, or source.  These are your only normal options.\n\nA: In your case, its better to use rolling release distros like Chakra, PCLOS, Linux Mint Debian as they get frequent updates to core and apps and you never have to re-install. Ubuntu goes for stability and thus the apps are kept at their stablest version, however PPA makes updates a breeze.\n", "Q: How to install .debs in a folder using a single command? Hello I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 Beta 2 and I've got the .debs of the softwares I had been using in Oneiric. I wanna install them all!!

I use only one at a time. I wanted to know if I can switch between ports without using ifup and ifdown every time. That means when I connect my LAN cable on eth0 it should work and it does. But when I disconnect the LAN cable and connect it on eth1 I have to ifdown eth0 and only then it works.\nIn my /etc/network/interfaces file I have configured both eth0 and eth1. there is no problem other than I have to switch it manually with ifdown and ifup every time.\n\nA: mediageek posted this as a comment.

If your script is called but isn't executing then remember you don't have a typical environment in a udev script and so you must call all programs by their full path or otherwise recreate the environment to your liking. Try replacing adb and chromium-browser with their absolute paths (which adb and which chromium-browser)\nAlso the second exec in your bash script wont execute like you expect as the environment doesn't specify a window system for Chromium to launch in.  I think I understand what you were trying to do here, but udev is designed to be non-interactive.\nIn response to your comment.

In Precise (12.04), when I login to lightdm, using the unity-greeter, there's a white circle by my name.  For the standard DEs like Unity or XFCE, the circle has a representative icon (Ubuntu symbol or little mouse resp.).  I have a session for Awesome window manager which was added when I installed Awesome, but it just shows a blank white circle.  I'd like to know how to add an icon to it, or at least some indicator, as unity-greeter doesn't show you what session is set until you click on the circle.  \nI found another question about changing the session names.  The answer for it said to change the names in the desktop files in /usr/share/xsessions.  Unfortunately, while there is an icon field in those desktop files, they are all blank (Caveat: I no longer have Unity installed, so maybe the Unity one would not be blank.  But the Xubuntu desktop file has it blank even though the icon shows in unity-greeter).  \nUpdate: Here's the png I use as a badge for Awesome.  It's not great, but looks reasonably nice: []\n\nA: Overview\nThe badges for the Lightdm are stored in /usr/share/unity-greeter. \nYou can possibly add a new badge to the directory mentioned above. I guess you would want to name it as custom_awesome_badge.png or whatever is the name of the session in /usr/share/xsessions/. All the badges are of 22 x 22 pixels.\nFrom the lightdm maintainer on the ubuntu-devel list:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Take /usr/share/unity-greeter/unknown_badge.png and use it as a  template (just a 22x22 white circle).\n  \n*Add your logo as a transparent cutout of the white circle (see other  badges in that directory for examples)\n  \n*Ship your logo as  /usr/share/unity-greeter/custom_SESSIONNAME_badge.png, where\n  SESSIONNAME  is your X session name (e.g. 'xfce' for XFCE).\n  \n  \n  Unity Greeter will automatically look there, falling back to the generic \n  white circle icon if not found.\n\n\nSet of ready-made custom badges\nYou can download a large set of additional badges here.

I'm new to Cinnamon so a beginners guide would be very useful.\n\nA: I suppose you have Cinnamon installed and running in your computer.\nCinnamon has a Website with themes, extensions and applets. Here is the link for themes:\nhttp://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/themes\nYou have to download the theme you like and uncompress it in /home/your_user/.themes\nIf you do not have the .themes folder, you can create it. So you must finally have, for the Minty theme for example, the next path: /home/your_user/.themes/Minty\nThe Minty folder is the uncompressed theme. Into that folder there is another folder called cinnamon (check this for all the themes you want to install).\nThen you will be able to select the theme you installed using Cinnamon Settings (program included with Cinnamon).\nThe GTK themes are needed for the windows.

(I'm just confused, so asking, I realize they are different o/s's but maybe there is a relationship somehow?)\nOn my server, I want to create an alias, should I put it in .bashrc?\nWhat if I want this alias to be applied so all users can use it?\n\nA: Bash aliases should go in the .bash_aliases or .bashrc files in individual home directories. If you must create global bash aliases, they can go in /etc/bash.bashrc, but it is often best simply to add them to the .bash_aliases or .bashrc files in /etc/skel so they are inherited by newly created users.\nIt is virtually always wrong to define an alias in in .profile, .bash_profile, or /etc/profile.\nTo understand why, one must understand under what circumstances commands from each of these files are run. There are misconceptions about this, which I address below.\nEven though you want to define aliases for multiple users, you should be familiar with how they are defined for individual users, so that you can decide on the best method of doing what you need.\nAliases for Individual Users\nEspecially if you use a GUI, most of your interactive shells are probably non-login shells. Even if you never use a GUI, you probably still use non-login shells with some frequency. You'll want your aliases to work in these shells.\nEspecially if you ever log in non-graphically in a virtual console or via SSH, you probably use login shells some of the time. So you'll want your aliases to work in interactive login shells also.\nWhen an interactive, non-login shell starts, it sources .bashrc in the user's home directory. By default in Ubuntu, each user's .bashrc itself sources .bash_aliases, if it exists.\n\n*\n\n*To source a file is to cause its contents to be run in the current shell. Changes to the shell environment made in a file that is sourced persist even after all the commands in the file have been run.\n\nReading the comments in Ubuntu's default .bashrc reveals that it is officially intended that aliases go in .bashrc or .bash_aliases. .bashrc already contains some alias definitions (run grep '^[[:blank:]]*alias' ~/.bashrc to see them), and gives explicit advice about where to put new such definitions:\n# Alias definitions.\n# You may want to put all your additions into a separate file like\n# ~/.bash_aliases, instead of adding them here directly.\n# See /usr/share/doc/bash-doc/examples in the bash-doc package.\n\nif [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then\n    . ~/.bash_aliases\nfi\n\nBut what about interactive login shells? Instead of .bashrc, login shells source .profile.\n\n*\n\n*...Unless .bash_login exists, then it gets sourced instead.\n\n*...Unless .bash_profile exists, then it gets sourced instead.\n\nHowever, the good news is that by default in Ubuntu, commands in .bashrc will also run in interactive login shells because the default .profile checks if the current shell is bash (and if .bashrc exists), and if so, sources .bashrc:\n# if running bash\nif [ -n \"$BASH_VERSION\" ]; then\n    # include .bashrc if it exists\n    if [ -f \"$HOME/.bashrc\" ]; then\n        . \"$HOME/.bashrc\"\n    fi\nfi\n\nI suggest users define new bash aliases in .bash_aliases in their home directories (creating it if it doesn't already exist). This is a particularly clean and simple way to make alias definitions permanent at the per-user level.\nAliases should not be defined in .profile because they would remain undefined in non-login shells. Unlike much of a bash shell's environment, aliases are not exported to child shells:\nek@Io:~$ alias hi='echo \"Greetings, $USER!\"'\nek@Io:~$ hi\nGreetings, ek!\nek@Io:~$ bash\nek@Io:~$ hi\nhi: command not found\n\nIn particular, by default most desktop environments cause .profile to be sourced on graphical login, but:\n\n*\n\n*This is not necessarily done by a bash shell, so alias definitions may not even be processed, and more importantly\n\n*even if alias definitions are processed, they are not passed on to child processes. Particularly, they are not passed on to shells created by opening a Terminal window!\n\nAliases should not be defined in .bash_profile (or .bash_login) for the very same reason, but also for another reason. Naively creating one of these files and putting just alias definitions in it prevents any of the code in .profile from running!\nIn situations where .bash_profile or .bash_login really is useful, typically one sources .profile somewhere in them, which solves that problem. (Then the only remaining problem is that, like with .profile, defining aliases in .bash_profile or .bash_login doesn't work right.)\nAliases for New Individual Users, Automatically\nWhen a user account of the type intended to represent a real human being is created, a new directory is typically made to serve as their home directory. The contents of /etc/skel are then copied to their home directory. This is how multiple users start out with some similar configuration files in their home directories. In Ubuntu, this includes .profile, .bashrc, and some other files.\nTo change what aliases are defined for new users, you can simply put them in /etc/skel/.bash_aliases (you will have to create it) or /etc/skel/.bashrc.\nIf you edit an already-existing file in /etc/skel you may want to back it up first--but you shouldn't put the backup in /etc/skel, or it, too, will be copied into new users' home directories.\nThis is likely the best way for you to add new aliases for multiple users. Existing users can simply add the aliases themselves. If you define the aliases in /etc/skel/.bash_aliases, you can simply direct them to that file, which they may choose to copy into their home directories (or add into their own custom .bash_aliases file).\nIt's trivial for a user to undefine an alias. Additionally, aliases are not extremely robust; they work only in particular circumstances. If you need to create a new command that works all the time, for everyone, you should not implement that command as an alias. And you cannot successfully force aliases on users who don't want them--they can simply unalias them.\nGlobal Aliases, for All Users\nThough I advise you to avoid this approach, you can define aliases in the the global /etc/bash.bashrc file. They will then be defined both for interactive non-login shells and for interactive login shells. The reason is, before any of the files in the user's home directory are sourced:\n\n*\n\n*Login shells (and only login shells and other processes behaving like login shells) run commands from /etc/profile automatically.\n\n*Only non-login shells run commands in /etc/bash.bashrc automatically, but\n\n*Ubuntu's default /etc/profile checks if the running shell is bash (and if /etc/bash.bashrc exists) and, if so, sources /etc/bash.bashrc.\n\nThis is analogous to how the default per-user .profile sources the per-user .bashrc if the shell is bash (as detailed above).\nHere's what the actual code for this looks like in the default /etc/profile:\nif [ \"$PS1\" ]; then\n  if [ \"$BASH\" ] && [ \"$BASH\" != \"/bin/sh\" ]; then\n    # The file bash.bashrc already sets the default PS1.\n    # PS1='\\h:\\w\\$ '\n    if [ -f /etc/bash.bashrc ]; then\n      . /etc/bash.bashrc\n    fi\n  else\n    if [ \"`id -u`\" -eq 0 ]; then\n      PS1='# '\n    else\n      PS1='$ '\n    fi\n  fi\nfi\n\nThat block also performs other tasks. Specifically, the outer if checks if the shell is likely to be interactive (by checking that the prompt text is non-empty), then checks if the current shell is bash and sources /etc/bash.bashrc if it is, and if not does some work that, for bash, is already done in /etc/bash.bashrc.\nYou should not define global aliases in /etc/profile for the same reason users should not define them in their local .profiles: if you do, they will be defined only for login shells, and not for their child shells.\nFinally, note that, unlike the default per-user .bashrc, the default /etc/bash.bashrc file does not contain anything about aliases. It is somewhat unusual to give users aliases in a file where they cannot edit or disable them. (Of course, they still can do that, by overriding their definitions in their own local .bashrc, .bash_aliases, or elsewhere.)\nFurther Reading\n\n*\n\n*Why is /etc/profile not invoked for non-login shells?\n\n*How to create a permanent “alias”?\n\n*How do I create a permanent Bash alias?\n\n*Why must I do . .bash_profile every time I create a new alias?\n\nA: Here's some nice reading on it.  \".bash_profile is executed for login shells, while .bashrc is executed for interactive non-login shells\"\nSo for your alias, use .bash_profile\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 Unity is running but does not appear correctly on Virtual Box I am using the latest edition of Virtualbox 4.1.12 and I get the attached when I attempt to launch Unity.

Go to Menu Edit > Preferences > Extensions.\nThere are several groups like communityExtensions,ContextPane...\nGo to Utilies group. Notification Area sound Menu integration are the required options.\nOn my laptop these 2 options are exclusive. Notification Area gives a banshee icon in notification area.

For this script, cp is the command doing most of your heavy lifting. It will replace copy and xcopy. Echo is still echo. You can write to your log with the '>>' operator.\nBash is pretty neat because you can define functions and use real if if(...){... } else{ ...}statements instead of if ... goto (you can still use labels if you really want). Try learning bash just like you learned batch, and enjoy finding your way around. You'll be glad you took the time to rewrite this script from the ground up, and you will learn about a lot of new tools. \n\nA: I would recommend that you familiarize yourself with Python. It's a very nice and easy to learn language. No compiles or anything like that. However, it has libraries that enables you do do anything you would want to do. \nSo, you might want to first a text-based replacement for your current script. Then, later, you can add a GUI for it. It's easy. Of course, Bash is useful too, but more limited. If you're going to only learn one new language, I would absolutely recommend Python. But of course, there's nothing wrong with learning both Bash and Python :)\n\nA: I think most people would suggest \"rsync\", which is basically the closest thing to Microsoft RoboCopy that there is:\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/29232/linux-equivalent-to-robocopy\nThat batch file is basically overdoing it a little, IMHO.\n", "Q: Intel Graphics Board doesn't run great at Ubuntu.

Unity 2D isn't really behind Unity 3D, so you would get better performance and still be able to use Ubuntu as it's.\nA second option would be use xorg-edgers, a PPA that updates your drivers to the latest ones avaiable.

I really like wiggle animation for application notification, but I find it disappear too quickly and I wish I could change this delay. I looked through all the ccsm, appearance, and myUnity settings and nothing seems appropriate.\n\nA: I don't think this is a configurable option in Unity, but you can edit the source code to change the duration.  If you've not downloaded source and compiled your own packages before, you can do so as follows.  From your home directory in a terminal window:\nmkdir src\ncd src\napt-get source unity\ncd unity-<version number>\ngedit ./plugins/unityshell/src/Launcher.cpp\n\nLook for the line which says:\nLauncher.cpp:const int Launcher::Launcher::ANIM_DURATION_SHORT = 125;\n\nand maybe double the duration.  If you've never built a package from source before you're going to need a few tools.  So do:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential devscripts\n\nThen to get the dependencies neccessary for unity to build properly:\nsudo apt-get build-dep unity\n\nFinally create the package and install: \ndebuild -us -uc\ncd ..\nsudo dpkg -i unity*.deb\n\nIf you're having problems with dependencies let me know, and I'll try to help you figure out what you're missing.\n", "Q: Permanently change keyboard layout I am using Xmonad and LXDE, so I don't want to use gnome-settings-daemon.

Works well. linux-backports-modules-cw can be found in software center and network-manager update can be get via normal uodatin method.\nFor anybody who needs this info in Tukish navigate to my blog entry : http://gkaya93.blogspot.com/2012/05/ubuntu-1204-wireless-cozumu.html . I will write an English description here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check the table in this page to see if your wireless card (or sth similar*) is there : http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/WLAN/Linux-backports-modules#Enthaltene-Treiber\n\n*If there, do the following:\n\n*Go to terminal and enter \"uname -r\" for returning kernel version.\n\n*Search for a matching version of \"linux-backports-modules-cw\" in software center. Install it.\n\n*Update network-manager.\n\n*Reboot and see if it affects. It changed my experience a lot. It's really better now.\n\n\n*My card was rtl8192se. It wasn't included in the table, instead, rtl8180/rtl8187. but the software healed my system. So go ahead and try if your card's model is close to included models. I guess this is safer than manipulating system configuration files.\nAnd sth to include, on the website, it says that linux-backports-modules-cw is included in the Live image, so you can install if have no connection. I didn't try it, as I have formatted my live medium. But if you didn't, add it to your Software sources and try to use.\n- Software Center > Edit > Software sources > Installable from CD-ROM/DVD... Check the checkbox below it.\nI guess this thing would work well in elderly Ubuntu versions, but I'm not sure and encouraging anyone to try it because of my word. Thanks for any support made.\n", "Q: What has changed in libssl.0.9.8o-7ubuntu2 so that it now breaks my Aventail client, and what should I do? I cannot install my Aventail client in Kubuntu 12.04 because it does not like 12.04's version of libssl.0.9.8. Although Aventail will install without complaining when libssl.0.9.8o-7ubuntu1 is installed, it's a different story with libssl.0.9.8o-7ubuntu2, the version that 12.04 wants to install. With 0.9.8o-7ubuntu2, I get the following errors:\nCode:\n linux-gate.so.1 =>  (0xb77c7000)\n        libpthread.so.0 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0 (0xb7798000)\n        libssl.so.0.9.7 => not found\n        libcrypto.so.0.9.7 => not found\n        libm.so.6 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libm.so.6 (0xb776b000)\n        libc.so.6 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0xb75c5000)\n        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0xb77c8000)\n\nWhat has changed between 0.9.8o-7ubuntu1 and 0.9.8o-7ubuntu2? Is there a way for me to instruct my package management systems not to include libssl.0.9.8 in its updater?\n\nA: I got it working - well I can use Aventail on Ubuntu 12.04 32bit but on Ubuntu 12.04 64bit it does not work at all - startcui or starct do not work (please test and escalate to Sonicwall if you want).\nTo solve your lib issue\nsudo apt-get install libssl0.9.8 \nsudo ln -s /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libssl.so.0.9.8 /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libssl.so.0.9.7\nsudo ln -s /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libcrypto.so.0.9.8 /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libcrypto.so.0.9.7\n\n\nA: Aventail 10.52 was installed and working on 11.10 x64. After upgrading to Precise Pangolin 12.04 x64 (64-bit) I fixed Aventail using:\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libssl.so.0.9.8 /usr/lib/libssl.so.0.9.7\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcrypto.so.0.9.8 /usr/lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.7\n\n\nA: Unfortunately, there is nothing you can do in this case except to tell Update Manager not to update libssl. open the Update Manager by clicking the power cog and selecting \"Software up to Date\" or \"Updates Available\".\n\nThe update Manager will open and you will be presented with an window looking similar to this:\n\nUncheck the checkboxes for any updates with the package named libssl in them. Click \"Install Updates\" and enter your password when prompted. Repeat the next time you update your computer, and so forth.\n", "Q: Is it possible to sync two computers without storing the files on a server? I have a family member currently using Windows live mesh to sync a relatively large amount of files between computers. It is way over the Ubuntu One 5 GB limit and the Live Mesh 2 GB limit. However, Live Mesh gives him the options of syncing all the data he wants without storing it on Microsoft's servers. Does Ubuntu One have an equivalent option, performing just the sync computer-to-computer and not computer-to-server and server-to-computer? Do you have other recommendations? It does not necessarily have to be Ubuntu One, but I need it to be cross platform, working across Windows and Ubuntu. We also have computers outside of uour home network we need to sync to. This is one of the few things keeping him from switching to Ubuntu, and I'd be very grateful for any help.\n\nA: In Unix, a \"standard\" program to synchronize directories on two machines is rsync. \n\nRsync is a fast and extraordinarily versatile file copying tool.  It\n  can copy locally, to/from another host\n         over any remote shell, or to/from a remote rsync daemon.  It offers a large number of options that  control\n         every  aspect  of its behavior and permit very flexible specification of the set of files to be copied.  It\n         is famous for its delta-transfer algorithm, which reduces the amount of data sent over the network by send‐\n         ing  only  the  differences  between  the source files and the existing files in the destination.  Rsync is\n         widely used for backups and mirroring and as an improved copy command for everyday use.\n\nTurns out there's a Windows version of rsync called cwRsync. Here are some info on installing and using cwRsync (though it's more focused on using rsync for backups)\nAs you don't want to involve any intermediate servers in the process, one of the issues you'll have to deal with is configuring some sort of port forwarding to enable direct access to one of the machines from internet (provided the machines you want to sync are in different local networks). From there, everything should be quite straightforward.\nAnother option mentioned in this answer to a similar question is Unison - using it over internet would also require configuring port forwarding. Which, generally, is a must for any server-less solution.\n", "Q: Do PPAs freeze ever? Say someone wants to get involved, but they want it to work properly for mass consumption first instead of a 'works for me' attitude.  Starting one before 12.04 goes stable could be difficult with all the packages changing quite rapidly(zeitgeist is a great example, but it's all for the better).  \nThe question, is it safe to wait or does PPA creation freeze?\n\nA: There's no policy on when PPAs ever freeze or when you can create one, so it's really up to you. \n", "Q: Flash audio problem; redirecting to Pulse? I am having a problem where the sound on flash objects other than YouTube videos are giving a strange distortion. It has a high pitched pulse sound every second or less that resembles skips on a record. I have no idea what the problem is or how to fix it. Does anyone have an idea what I could do to fix this?\nI am running Xubuntu 11.10. I think I might have redirected everything to pulse using a config file but I cannot seem to find it anywhere. It used the lines 'type pulse' in it. If  anyone knows what I am talking about and how to find that file or whether or not it has any relevance I would greatly appreciate it.\nEDIT: I solved it. The problem was that I needed to update the flash plugin in Chrome and Chromium manually.\n\nA: I solved it. The problem was that I needed to update the flash plugin in Chrome and Chromium manually. I went to http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/ and downloaded the \".tar.gz for other Linux\" option and copied the .so file into the plugins directory for all of my browsers.\n", "Q: Compizconfig Grid doesn't work under Ubuntu as virtual machine I have installed Ubuntu 11.10 as virtual machine within Mac.\nI have installed VM tools.\nThe approach in this link of Compizconfig Grid, which worked in my previous laptop where Ubuntu was not a virtual machine, does not work anymore. I set some shortcut, but no action is launched...\nDoes anyone know why?\nThe major functionality I need from Grid is tiling windows to left/right side of the screen... Does anyone know any alternative? \nPS: I have tried other plugins of Compizconfig, for instance, Move Window works...\nEdit1: The desktop environment I am using is Ubuntu, not Gnome. The unity is 2D instead of 3D. It is not a problem for me to change it if that can solve the Grid or tiling problem above.\nEdit2 & 3: I didn't know that Unity2D does not use compiz by default... After installing gtk2-engines-pixbuf, I launched compiz --replace &in a terminal, that gives:\n\nAnd I tried Grid once again: bind shortcut <Control><Alt>g to Put Left, it still does not work.\nBut as I said before, if I bind <Control><Alt>g to Initiate Window Move in Move Window (either before or after compiz --replace &), the shortcut always has an effect...  \nEdit 4: I just enabled Accelerate 3D Graphics, which was disabled before... But rerunning compiz --replace & in a terminal gives exactly same message as before including 2 Fatal for opengl.\n\n\nA: As I get it, *Fatal: GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap* means that X server does not support *GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap* API feature, which requires a 3D hardware acceleration. \nYou can see the previous error message: Fatal: Software rendering detected which means that VM has no configured 3D graphics acceleratio card, either because there is no such hardware in your system, or it's not properly configured.\nSo check out if there is 3D acc. card in the host OS, or not. If there isn't I guess you can't make Grid work. If there is, you should configure your VM to expose 3D acc. card to the guest ubuntu OS.  \nSee Compiz hadware requirements. \n", "Q: invisible file? Everytime, after having started my computer, I get the following notification:\nthe file P(long number).MOV is being uploaded to you personal cloud.\nDoes anybody know what this means? I can not find such a file in my folder.\nCheers!\nCorina\n\nA: The notification means Ubuntu One is synchronizing that file. The file must therefore be inside a folder being synchronized by Ubuntu One. The filename looks like a video recorded from a digital camera or camcorder. If you are synchronizing your ~/Videos folder with Ubuntu One, it may very likely be in there.\nIf you keep seeing the same filename, it is likely taking a very long time to upload, or may actually be a different file being uploaded, but due to a bug (which has since been fixed), you may be seeing the notification with a filename that is no longer being uploaded. Can you please specify what versions of Ubuntu itself, and the ubuntuone-client package you have installed?\nTo see what Ubuntu One is currently working on you can open a terminal and run the two following commands:\nu1sdtool --current-transfers\nu1sdtool --waiting\n\nThese should print a list of the current, and pending transfers, respectively.\n\nA: Be shure that the file is not hidden. To show hidden files presh ctrl + h. Then search for the file. Hidden file are preceded by a dot \".\".\nIf you can't find the file, please make sure that the file are in the place you are searching.\nAlso you can try, in a command line:\ncd / \nupdatedb \nlocate name_of_the_file\n\nAnd will show you all the files matching this name.\nIf you haven't got installed \"locate\" package, please, install from ubuntu software center.\nI hope it helps you!\n", "Q: Using tar, the entire folder structure is including, I don't want that I am taring a folder and for some reason the entire directory structure that preceds the folder I am tarring is included.\nI am doing this in a script like:\n'tar czf ' + dir + '/asdf.tgz ' + dir + 'asdf/'\n\nWhere dir is like:\n/Downloads/archive/\n\nIn the man pages, I see I can fix this but I can't get it to work.\nI tried:\ntar czf -C dir ...\n\nBut now I have some kind of a file -C in my folder (which I can't seem to delete btw!).\nPlease help!\n\nA: *\n\n*The single-character options must be followed immediately by their parameters, then any other parameters.

I also suggest to re-phrase, re-formant and change this question to a community wiki.\n\nok!So should i not write here about this?I just want someone to take place on this!Sorry but what is API? – gabriel Apr 12 at 23:52\n\nQuestions regarding Running third-party applications on Ubuntu are perfectly valid as stated in faq.\nAPI (in this context) is a set of instructions (or, more accurately, calls) which a Windows developer uses (more or less directly) to communicate with the operating system from within the application. This set is specific to Windows. What normally WINE does is an attempt to \"translate\" a Windows-only call to a native GNU/Linux call. When such call cannot be easily translated it has to be reimplemented by WINE developers to suite it's original purpose but stay strict with GNU/Linux standards. Many of those calls are just stubs (as in: a call exists but rarely any programmer uses it so it's there but does nothing for now).\n\nMaybe I will have to learn all the c++ or python etc. But I am sure that a solution can come with the help of all of us!\n\nAlthough WINE should allow AutoCAD (or any other app) to communicate with GNU/Linux as it does with Windows and still get the proper results (so it would work seamlessly), the majority of the Windows (at least XP) API calls has already been implemented or stubbed and the problem still persists. Most probably AutoCAD uses some exotic (or new) API call (or calls) that yet needs to be implemented. Percentage of WINE community are enthusiasts who can trace this exact calls the application in question crashes on and simply contribute a patch (which you can help to test). You can either keep asking about this in communities like askubuntu.com (which are more related to Ubuntu than WINE development) and hope those needed API calls will get implemented, help to point out to the WINE developers the exact API calls AutoCAD needs, or, implement them yourself. Also, if you're interested in joining WINE code contributors ranks, a guidance from programmers with more experience in the field of WINE development will save you a great deal of time.\n\nA: Also exist nice alternatives for hungry Autodesk products.  \nFreeCAD\nFreeCAD - A parametric 3D CAD modeler  \njust free and just available for all major operating systems.\n\n\nQ-CAD\nOther one is more than ten times cheaper than AutoCAD and it is very handy software:\nQ-CAD Community Edition - Features \nA professional 2d builder based on SVG manipulation and ECMAScript, which support DXF/DWG through 2010 version.  \n\n\nBRL-CAD\nTo full impress third one is BRL-CAD, a powerful cross-platform open source solid modeling system that includes interactive geometry editing.  \n... and his Stryker ICV 8 trillions rays rendering example : \n\n\nUpdate:\nDraftSight\nDraftSight - Overview\nProfessional CAD software.  \n\n\nA: Did you know about playonlinux program?

Any thoughts?  \n\nA: Yes, you should definitely use fglrx if you want to maximise the potential of your graphics card. These proprietary drivers provided by AMD itself are the best route to take. There is an active debate over whether or not the open source or the proprietary drivers are better for proprietary cards.  You can see a full comparison here, which lists some stats. Ultimately it's your decision, but I recommend the proprietary drivers.\n\nA: running \nsudo lspci -k\n\nshould list all your devices, drivers in use, and kernel modules available. \n", "Q: Command history in zsh Currently I have zsh set up in such a way that command history is shared between all sessions immediately.\nSay I have a terminal emulator open with two tabs, each with a zsh session, A1 and A2.

I think you want\nsetopt append_history no_inc_append_history no_share_history\n\nThis is the default zsh setup, by the way.\nYou can save the history explicitly at any point with fc -AI and merge it back in with fc -RI.\n", "Q: What to do about USB support? USB speeds are consistently slow in ubuntu, and have been for years.  I just bought two new machines with usb 3.0, running 10.04, and yet nothing has changed, top speeds are only about 8.0 MB per second and they quickly drop to 2 or less.  Its very frustrating.\nAre there any fixes for this at all?  I find almost nothing online.\nThe board is a gigabyte 970A-DS3 motherboard. Is there any driver I should install? I am using brand new usb sticks (kingston) and making sure to plug into the 3.0 (blue) slot. \n\nA: It is not a general true that USB is slow in Ubuntu. It's not even common. Actually, I think, this is the first I've heard of it. \nI use a different computer than you do. So does most other people. Have you told anyone that it's slow on your computer? Because nobody can fix problems if they don't know you have one. And noone can provide a precise answer to this without knowing what computer you have, or what you've done to fix it. \nIt does, however, sound like a driver issue. You can try to install the latest kernel: http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/linux-image-3.0.0-17-generic. This will not remove the old kernel, so it's completely safe to install it. You'll still be able to boot to the old kernel. It'll be added to your boot menu. \n\nA: That is quite different from what I experienced (on 11.10).  I was trying to compare performance between ntfs vs. ext4fs and did some tests yesterday.  For a directory of 1.9GB digital pictures, it takes about 12 seconds to copy to an external usb3 hard drive.  Which comes to about 150MB/s.  By the way, ntfs and ext4fs takes roughly same amount of time.\n", "Q: Intel Centrino Wireless N 1000 doesn't work on a Lenovo Z560 I upgraded my Ubuntu 11.04 to 11.10 and my Wifi has stopped working.

You might want to write these down as a cheat sheet.\n\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl+c Kill the running process (foreground job)\n\n*Ctrl+z Pause running process (foreground job) and return to the prompt\n\n*Type jobs Shows you all background jobs on the terminal\n\n*Type bg Makes the last paused job continue in the background\n\n*Type fg Returns the last pause job to the foreground\n\n\nYou can also type bg or fg with a number after, like fg 3. This will bring job #3 to the foreground.\nIf you are going to background a process, and you don't want it outputting a bunch of text, just put > filename.txt after it, like this process > out.txt. This will make it send all standard output to the file out.txt (and not clutter your terminal).\nIf you use terminals often (like me :) then you definitely want to install and become familiar with the terminal program called screen. It allows you to have multiple virtual terminals in 1 window, and if you close the terminal window (on accident?), you can reopen it exactly where you left off from before.\n\nA: Ah, you're hitting the wrong key. It's Control + C. This is the command to force the current running application in the terminal to end. If you end the command it will also end the corresponding open application. So if you want to execute more commands in the same terminal, you have to press Control + C to exit the program, which will also exit geany. So it's best to simply run programs through the GUI, therefore saving you a lot of terminal windows. Or you can also use Ubuntu's run command function by pressing Alt + F2 and typing the command you want to run, no terminal required.\n\nA: If what you're really trying to do is start a GUI program from the terminal, you may prefer something like\ngeany filename.php &\n\nwhich will start it in the background, since it doesn't need the terminal for anything.  This may also work for the node.js application, if it doesn't require the terminal for anything.\nIf they're still running when you close the terminal, it will complain.  If you really want them to stick around after the terminal exits, use disown.\n\nA: i use geany for tcl/tk. if you open geany, look for the \"build\" icon. it will let you create  commands to be launched with a mouse click. click the icon then set build commands then edit the execute entry to something like this:  sh %f && exit\nyou may have to tweak it to your needs. replace sh with whatever runs your code. you must use 2 amperstands also. it opens a terminal and runs the gui script. when i am done examining the gui i am creating, i close the terminal window which kills the gui script. it also removes the limitations of the built in terminal. but alas, you still have to close the terminal to get a clean slate.\n", "Q: How do I get Launchy to open Chromium?

When the script mounts the partition, Nautilus pops up with a Window showing the partition and stealing focus. This is something I want to avoid.\nNote: I know I can change the behaviour of this in System settings, Details, Removable media, Never prompt or start programs on media insertion, but I don't want to change the behaviour e.g. if a USB stick is plugged in, I just want to prevent it in my bash script. Since this script runs on other users' computers I cannot modify these settings (in the script) because if it is terminated abnormally it will leave the modified settings in place (I also don't believe it should be necessary to do this).\nActually this auto display doesn't seem consistent. If I do the exact same command from the terminal, Nautilus doesn't show, and I know there are other mounts in my script that don't show. So what could be causing this? Here's an example of the code (both cause separate nautilus windows to pop):\nmount $dev $target\nmkdir -p $target/home\nmount $homedev $target/home\n\nI'm interested in understanding the process by which the mount signals Nautilus and why this is happening (when it doesn't if I mount the partition from the terminal). And what is the best way to prevent this from happening.\nI noticed this behaviour starting on release 11.10 (if I recall correctly). I'm currently running 12.04, but the script has to work on all supported releases. I don't believe the solution should involve modifying system settings (that might differ between releases). For example, if you look at other things that mount partitions (like os-prober), there are no nautilus windows popping up when it mounts different partitions.\nThe script can be found here. And here's the part where Nautilus pops. I think it also pops here, but I've been focusing my testing on the first link. This is where it doesn't pop, called prior to those other mounts - note I've rewritten the first ones as --read-only and within an if statement and it makes no difference.\nIdeally the answer will explain why this is happening and how to prevent it, in other words, explain why the in-script mount is treated differently to the one issued from a terminal. A good workaround will also be accepted if it is a fully explained solution and practical that can support all desktop environments (ubuntu, kubuntu, xubuntu, lubuntu etc) - I also want to avoid an exponential increase in testing to verify it.\nThanks in advance\n============\nSolution as per papashou's link:\nadd_udev_rules ()\n{\n    for i in \"$dev\" \"$homedev\" \"$bootdev\" \"$usrdev\"; do\n      if [ -n \"$i\" ]; then\n        block=${i#/dev/}\n        echo \"KERNEL==\\\"\"\"$block\"\"\\\",ENV{UDISKS_PRESENTATION_HIDE}=\\\"1\\\"\" >> \"$wubi_move_dir\"/wubi_move.rules\n      fi\n    done\n    cp \"$wubi_move_dir\"/wubi_move.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/wubi_move.rules\n    udevadm trigger > /dev/null 2>&1\n}\n\nremove_udev_rules ()\n{\n    rm /etc/udev/rules.d/wubi_move.rules\n    rm \"$wubi_move_dir\"/wubi_move.rules\n    udevadm trigger > /dev/null 2>&1\n}\n\nThis achieves the desired result, but feels like a sledgehammer approach. I believe there is probably a fine-tuning in udev that will allow the partition to still show in Nautilus (and other file browsers) without popping up when it's mounted. By the way if anyone wants to try this, the following script will show the pop-up effect of nautilus:\nmkdir -p /tmp/testmount\nmount /dev/sda1 /tmp/testmount\nsleep 3\numount /dev/sda1 \nmount /dev/sda1 /tmp/testmount\nsleep 3\numount /dev/sda1 \nmount /dev/sda1 /tmp/testmount\nsleep 3\numount /dev/sda1 \nmount /dev/sda1 /tmp/testmount\nsleep 3\numount /dev/sda1 \nrmdir /tmp/testmount\n\nI'm going to keep playing with udev and I've also filed a bug, since this doesn't make any sense for a partition that's not inserted to act like an inserted USB/media card upon mount. Also the udevadm trigger is not an inexpensive operation that appears (on 12.04 at least) to temporarily freeze everything.\nSo, in summary, I have a workable solution (thanks to everyone who helped out), which I may or may not implement (not sure yet); but I'll keep looking for something else.\nThanks\n\nA: Try this suggestion: http://www.worldofnubcraft.com/969/hide-your-disks-or-partitions-from-nautilus/\nI'm fairly sure it has to do with udev signals and processing.\n\nA: Try wrapping your script:\n#!/bin/bash\n#\n\n# disable nautilus automount\n#\ngconftool --type Boolean --set /apps/nautilus/preferences/media_automount  false\n\n# put your script here  \n#\n...\n\n# enable back nautilus automount\n# \ngconftool --type Boolean --set /apps/nautilus/preferences/media_automount  true\n\nNot tested cause I'm on 10.04\nUPDATE:\n#!/bin/bash\n#\n\n# disable nautilus automount\n#\ngconftool --type Boolean --set /apps/nautilus/preferences/media_automount  false\n\n# put CALLING your script here to survive its crashes\n#\n/bin/bash -c \"/whenever/it/is/placed/script.sh\"\n\n# enable back nautilus automount\n# \ngconftool --type Boolean --set /apps/nautilus/preferences/media_automount  true\n\n\nA: You can prevent flash drive automounting by adding a new udev rule.

Is it possible to put games like we usually play in windows? and How can I install them in Ubuntu?\n\nA: The answer here can't be precise. You can play Windows games on Linux using softwares such as Wine (free) and CrossOver Games (paid), that simulate Windows's APIs.\nThe performance in some games are actualy better than playing it in Windows, like Counter Strike 1.6 for example, but lots of games simple won't play. There is a software database that shows lots of softwares and games that run with Wine, with how tos and stuffs.\nBut be aware that Wine can be tricky and kinda depends on your hardware. A game may play fine on NVidia graphic cards but not with Intel ones for example, even if it used to play fine on Windows.\nOn a side note, Warcraft III received a platinum score on Wine App DB, so i would say it play just fine, but never tryed it myself since i prefer to play native Linux games (and trust me, there ARE lots of them).\nWine is on Ubuntu's repositories, so all you have to do is type this on terminal:\nsudo apt-get install wine\n\nThe Wine App DB can be find here. You could also look at PlayOnLinux, a front end to Wine that implement lots of the how tos and do it themselfs, prety cool.

I noticed when I was fiddling with the launcher icon size that at a certain size the icon for Audacity changes. Does anyone know why this would happen?\n\n\n\nA: The Freedesktop Icon Theme Specification allows multiple images to be provided for a given icon name where the image chosen will depend on the size being requested.\nPresumably, Audacity is providing multiple icons and this is the size at which the image choice changes.\n\nA: Maybe becausethe two icons used are different.\nI suggest that you check in your icon theme the differences between the icons for audacity in different sizes.\n\nA: The default icon was built for a small size and would not look good at larger sizes, so to fix this they use a higher resolution icon for the larger sizes.\n", "Q: How to make my DVB-T/FM Tuner work ?

On the AMD's site I followed steps to determine which driver should I use. After selecting what hardware I use I got a link to download amd-driver-installer-12-3-x86.x86_64.run and below was a description of that driver that it was compatible with X.Org version from 6.7 to 7.6. And I do not know what version of X.Org my Ubuntu uses. Cause after googling I found that version is 7.6 in Ubuntu 11.10. But after typing: X -version I got the output:\nX.Org X Server 1.10.4\nRelease Date: 2011-08-19\nX Protocol Version 11, Revision 0\n\nSo what is the exact version of X.Org in Ubuntu 11.10 and how should one reliably determine it? Can anyone construe? Thanks.\n\nA: The X Window System used to be distributed as one big tarball containing the server, drivers, client libraries and some applications.\nThis changed with the release of X11R7.0, where these components were split into separate tarballs.  The main benefits being:\n\n\n*\n\n*If a component doesn't change between releases, the same tarball can be included in multiple releases.\n\n*More frequently changing components (such as graphics drivers) can release new packages that can be installed without having to rebuild everything else.\n\n*Different people can handle the release of different components.\n\n\nIt does have one downside in that the version numbers of all the different components are now more visible to users.\nIn the case of the X server itself, you can see what version was included in X11R7.6 at the download site:\nhttp://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.6/src/xserver/\nSo the version included with Ubuntu 11.10 is somewhat newer.  The driver you downloaded from AMD may be compatible with the newer server, but AMD is unlikely to advertise this one way or the other until a full X11R7.7 release is out.  If you are concerned, I suggest sticking to the driver versions included with Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Why does waking from hibernate take nearly ten minutes on a Dell XPS 15 L502x laptop? Im running 11.10 64bit on a Dell XPS 15 L502x laptop. It uses an i5 proc and has 16Gb ram.\nWhenever I close the lid on the laptop I have it set to hibernate as I want to continue whatever I was previously running. Generally that is simple text editing, so my mem usage would normally be only a Gb or 2. When I open the lid and it resumes from Hibernation, it takes up to ten minutes to do so. Extremely frustrating.\nIs there anything I can do to make hibernate function properly. On windows it used to wake from Hibernation in less than 30 seconds. Its really frustrating and souring my experience with Ubuntu. Any help would be gratefully appreciated!\n\nA: Install the uswsusp package. It compresses the data as it writes it out so the process goes faster. 10 minutes seems a bit extreme though, pointing to a more serious hardware problem.\n\nA: When you hibernate, everything that is stored in your RAM gets copied to your hard disk. When the computer wakes up again, everything is moved back from the hard disk to RAM.\nBecause you have 16 GB of RAM, that means up to 16 GB must be transferred between your RAM and your hard disk. This naturally takes some time, as hard disks are quite slow.\n", "Q: How can I remove bluetooth-applet in 11.10? I tried adding rfkill block bluetooth to /etc/rc.local. This did not work.\nI tried adding both blacklist bluetooth and blacklist btusb to etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf. This did not work.\nSo I went to Synaptic to remove it altogether, but when I marked bluez for removal it said it was going to also remove gnome-shell as well! So naturally I didn't do that.\n(Is it sane to run a potential security problem like bluetooth by default? And why is something like that so tightly integrated into Gnome shell?)\nCan anyone tell me how to get rid of this annoying and unnecessary process?\n\nA: Have you tried cd /etc/xdg/autostart && sudo sed --in-place 's/NoDisplay=true/NoDisplay=false/g' bluetooth-applet.desktop && sudo sed --in-place 's/NoDisplay=true/NoDisplay=false/g' bluetooth-applet-unity.desktop then going in to startup applications and unchecking the box? reference here.  \nAdding the rfkill stuff, should cause any bluetooth devices to not associate.

The Network-Manager applet still starts if it's not managing any interfaces.  \nThe steps above will let you turn off the applet though.\n", "Q: Creating a GTK theme, but Qt and Java apps are not affected, and title bar button layout is ugly I'm playing with a gtk2 / gtk3 theme which I use in the Mate desktop.\nEverything is looking well, even gtk3 apps, but I still have 3 important issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*Java apps ignore the theme\n\n*QT apps ignore the theme\n\n*I'm using those nice ubuntu 10 title bar buttons, but the problem is, when only the close button appears, the title bar looks ugly.

I downloaded the 12.04 Beta 2 on the day of launch and have been testing and sending bug reports.  I now want to install it on another machine.  My question is do I use the original image I downloaded and apply the daily distro updates through Update manager OR do a download a new image (because it now has the distro updates included).  To be clear I am asking does the 12.04 Beta 2 ISO get updated on a daily basis?\n\nA: Here are the daily live images: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/\nThey are generated daily.\n\nA: No it does not get updated on a daily basis. Use the one u had downloaded previously and apply the update from updates manager.That should be fine.\n\nA: The answer is \"It doesn't really matter, to me\".\nsorry, I break into song sometimes\nIn all seriousness though, while the above answers are correct that you can just download the daily ISO from here, it doesn't really matter.

Which line should I edit? Or is there another way to reset my password?\n\nA: If there is a root password set and you have forgotten it, but can boot normally and can use sudo try this from a terminal\nsudo passwd -dl root\n\nIt is not apparent if you are getting the normal (and sudo) password and a root one confused.\nThe links you have for resetting passwd whould normally work.\n\nA: Since you cannot access recovery mode, you'll have to change the password by accessing your installed Ubuntu system from a live CD/DVD or live USB system. What follows is a detailed walkthrough on how to do that.\nThis is easiest if you can already use the Ubuntu system (even without administrative access). But it's not too much harder if you can't.\n\n\n*\n\n*In my experience, most Ubuntu users who end up locked out of their own systems have automatic login enabled, which is how they forget their passwords (because they don't have to type them in to log in). This may or may not be the case in your situation, but I have presented how to do this if you can use the installed Ubuntu system first because I think that will help the most people who read this post.\n\n\nIf You Can Use the Installed Ubuntu System, Even As a Non-Administrative User\n\n\n*\n\n*If you don't already have one, write an Ubuntu live USB flash drive (on Ubuntu, Windows, or Mac OS X), or burn an Ubuntu live CD/DVD (on Ubuntu, Windows, or Mac OS X).\n\n*If you know the device name of the partition that contains your Ubuntu system's root filesystem, feel free to skip to step 5.\n\n*In your Ubuntu system (not the live CD/DVD/USB system), run this command in the Terminal:\nmount | grep ' on / '\n\nYou should include the spaces before on and after /.\n\n*That command produces something like /dev/sda1 on / type ext4 (rw,errors=remount-ro,commit=0) as the output. The text before on (not including the space) is the device name of the partition that contains your Ubuntu system's root filesystem. Remember it (or write it down).\n\n*Boot the computer from the live CD/DVD/USB and select Try Ubuntu without installing (not Install Ubuntu).\n\n*Open up a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T).\n\n*Run this command:\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\nReplace /dev/sda1 with the device name of the partition containing your Ubuntu system's root filesystem, if different.\nIf you get an error message about how a device or partition does not exist or about an \"unknown filesystem type,\" then you probably used the wrong device name or partition number. As explained above, your system's root partition might not be /dev/sda1.\n\n*Run this command:\nsudo chroot /mnt\n\nFor the purposes of being able to reset a password, or being able to change what groups users are members of, that's all you need to do to chroot in. In particular, you do not also need to mount other filesystems like /dev, /dev/pts, /sys, and /proc. More sophisticated chrooting procedures, which allow you to fully use the system you are chrooted into--for example, to update and install software inside it--do require that, as well as additional steps after entering the chroot, but this does not.\nIf you run sudo chroot /mnt and you see this message, it almost always means that you mounted the wrong partition to /mnt--remember, it will not actually be /dev/sda1 on all systems--though it would also happen if you deleted /bin/bash:\nchroot: failed to run command ‘/bin/bash’: No such file or directory\n\nIf that does happen, then you can unmount it with sudo umount /mnt and then proceed to mount the correct partition.\n\n*Perform one of these tasks, to obtain/restore access to the install Ubuntu system.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you want to reset a user's password:\npasswd username\nReplace username with your username. (This is the username on the system installed on the hard drive, and not \"ubuntu\" which is the username of the default user on the Ubuntu Desktop Install CD.)\nEnter the password you want for that user.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you don't know your username, you can get a list of users on the system by running:\nls /home\n\nThis works because /home contains all the users' home directories, and the name of a user's home directory is the same as the name of the user.\n\n\n*Alternatively, if you want to set/reset the root password:\nSince you're in a root shell, you can use the passwd command with no arguments to reset root's password:\npasswd\n\nBut please see this page, which explains why having the root account enabled is not recommended in Ubuntu.\n\n*Alternatively, if you want to make a user an administrator (so they can perform administrative actions including running commands as root with sudo):\nIn Ubuntu 12.04 and higher (you can run lsb_release -r to see what version of Ubuntu you have, just make sure you run it in the chroot or it will tell you what version the live CD has), run:\nusermod -a -G sudo username\nIn Ubuntu 11.10 and lower, administrative abilities were conferred by membership in the admin group rather than the sudo group. So then you would instead run:\nusermod -a -G admin username\nIn both cases, replace username with the name of the user account you want to give admin powers.\n\n\n*Run these three commands:\nexit\nsudo umount /mnt\nexit\n\nThe last of those commands quits the Terminal window.\n\n*Reboot the system by clicking the power icon on the upper-right corner of the screen and clicking Shut Down. (Then click Restart in the dialog box that comes up.) Make sure to remove the CD/DVD or USB flash drive before the system boots up again, so that you can get into your Ubuntu system on the hard disk.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you're running an old enough Ubuntu live CD that there is a Restart option in the power menu, you should click that rather than Shut Down.\n\n\n\nIf You Cannot Use The Installed Ubuntu System At All\nIf you can't log on to obtain the device name of the partition that contains your Ubuntu system's root filesystem, you can figure it out after booting the live CD. There are several ways to do this. I present the one here that I consider easiest and least likely to lead to mistakes. (However, you may also be interested in this other method.)\n\n\n*\n\n*If you don't already have one, burn an Ubuntu live CD/DVD (on Ubuntu, Windows, or Mac OS X) or write an Ubuntu live USB flash drive (on Ubuntu, Windows, or Mac OS X).\n\n*Boot the computer from the live CD/DVD/USB and select Try Ubuntu without installing (not Install Ubuntu).\n\n*Open GParted.\n\n\n*\n\n*To do this in Unity, which is the default desktop environment in most versions of Ubuntu, click the home button (i.e., the button at the upper-left corner of the screen with the Ubuntu logo on it) or press Super, which is also known as the Windows key. Then type in gparted. GParted will come up, and you can click it.\n\n*Ubuntu 17.10 and later use GNOME 3 with the GNOME Shell instead of Unity. To open GParted, click on the grid of nine dots that appears on the lower-left corner of the screen to open the application panel. Then click on the GParted icon.\n\nSpecial thanks to Videonauth for explaining how to open GParted in GNOME 3, as well as for providing these screenshots.1\n\n*On very old versions of Ubuntu that use GNOME 2 instead of the Unity or Unity 2D interface, open GParted from the top menu by clicking System → Administration → GParted Partition Editor.\n\n*Other Ubuntu flavors, like Ubuntu MATE, Xubuntu and Lubuntu, have a similar system of nested menus, through which you can access GParted while running them from a live USB or live CD/DVD.\n\n\n*Now you can see all your partitions graphically. If you have more than one drive, you may need to select the one that contains your Ubuntu system, in the drop-down menu at the upper-right corner of GParted.\n\n*The partition that contains your Ubuntu system's root filesystem is most likely a large partition of type ext4 (or for very old Ubuntu systems, ext3). Usually there is only one ext4 (or ext3) partition, or just one big one. Otherwise, one might be the / partition (containing the root filesystem, this is what you want) and the other might be the /home partition. So if there are two large ext4 or ext3 partitions, you can assume the first one (shown farthest to the left) is probably the one that contains your system's root filesystem.\nThis could possibly be wrong, but nothing will be damaged by these instructions if you are. In some other situations, outside the actions described in this post, it would not necessarily be safe to make this assumption.\n\n*Remember, or write down, the device name of the partition that (probably) contains the root filesystem. GParted shows this to you. It usually takes the form /dev/sdXn where X is a lower-case letter and n is a number.\n\n*Quit GParted.\n\n*Follow the instructions above (\"If You Can Log On as a Non-Administrative User\"), starting with Step 6.\nThese post was originally adapted from post #9, which I wrote, in this Launchpad Answers question.\n1 Credit goes to Videonauth for explaining to me how to launch GParted in an Ubuntu 17.10 live environment. I don't have GNOME 3 and would not have been able to provide those instructions otherwise. He also supplied both screenshots. (All I added were the ugly hand-drawn arrow and circle.)\n\nA: If you need to change your root password but do not know the old one, you will need to drop to a root shell. When you boot into your computer, as soon as the BIOS screen disappears (the screen with your computers logo on it), start tapping the Shift key until the GRUB menu comes up, and if this option does not work, then tap the Esc key. (If it is already configured to come up then this step is not necessary.)\nWhen you see the menu choose the option of the latest kernel (or the one you normally use) and choose the option right below called \"recovery mode\".\nIt should look like this:\n\nThis will take you to a menu looking something like this:\n\nNext choose the Root option.\nWait and let everything load until you get to a shell. Now comes the fun. Enter the following command:\npasswd your-username\nReplace your-username with your actual username.\nIf you are unsure of your username you can look at the names of the files in your home folder via:\ncd /home\n\nThen run:\nls\n\nThis will show you the names of users on your computer.\nNow type the command I stated above: passwd your-username. So that if your username is jane, I would type:\npasswd jane\n\nNext you will be presented with an option to enter your new unix password. This is where you enter the password. It will ask you to retype the command and then after two successful passwords were entered the password has been changed. Now log back into your system via \nreboot\n\nIf you are asked for your root password when entering your new password this will usually help:\nAlternative Method\n\nIf you get asked for the root password when entering single user mode use init=/bin/bash on the kernel append line which should boot the machine into a bash console where you can get read/write access to your /etc/shadow file. You can then either run passwd or edit the shadow file directly to put in an empty string. This allows you to reboot the machine into its normal environment and log in as root leaving the password blank and then run the passwd program to set the root password. This should really only be done when the machine is detached from any networks.\n\n(Quote taken from Shawn Lee in an article listed below.)\nTo boot with init=/bin/bash as suggested, access the GRUB menu at boot time and press e to enter the editor. Move the cursor to the line starting with linux and then move the cursor to the end of that line. Enter the text\ninit=/bin/bash\n\nand press F10 to boot. You should land in a root shell in text only mode. The filesystem will be mounted read only. To make the filesystem writable, enter the command\nmount -o remount,rw /\n\nYou can then run\npasswd username\nwhere username is the name of the user whose password you want to set. When done, you can reboot with the reboot command.\n\nIf you need more information these links can help:\n\n\n*\n\n*Recovery Mode | Ubuntu Wiki\n\n*How to reset your password in Ubuntu\n\n*How-To: Recover root password under linux with single user mode\n\n*How to Reset debian Root Password\n", "Q: How to run a .bin file without using terminal How to run an executable .bin file without using terminal\nEg :qtcreator.bin\n\nA: step1: copy the file to the Desktop or home folder(for convenience )\nstep2: right click on the file and chose properties ,and check the allow the file to execute button\nstep3:rename the file to filename.bin to filename\nstep4:Double click on the program\nThe above method wont work if the program needs root permission\n\nA: open its properies and in one of the tabs(i cant recall which one) there is an option to make it executable.check it.\n thats it. just save the properties and then run the file.\n", "Q: How file permissions are stored in inode? Suppose there's two pc - \"A\" and \"B\". Then if A downloads a files from B , then what would be the file permission of that downloaded file? Is it possible that the downloaded file in A will have an Inode entry with all it's permissions from B & store B's user account as the owner ? If that's the case then is it impossible to change that files permission on A if \"others\" [as in user-group-others] doesn't have the right to write on that file?\ne.g. if this is the case ,\n__x __x __x  file.txt  [On B]\nthen what would be the file permission on A of that same file downloaded from B [e.g. through vsftpd]?\n\n\n*\n\n*__x __x __x    file.txt [On A]\n\n\nor \n\n\n*\n\n*rw_x rw_x rw_x     file.txt [On A] [i.e. defined by A's default umask value] \n\n\nA: The downloaded file will have the permissions depending on the system A settings (umask). Basically at the moment the file is copied the file belongs to the user on A. \nTo be more accurate, the data from the file is transferred to the ftp client on system A. Only the data, not the metadata (in the Inode) that holds access rights, ownership, create/access/modify date .... and other stuff.\nI could download the file via ftp and store it on a non unix file system (FAT) for example, that has none or a completely different security mechanism.\nSo basically in your case the ftp protocol is the problem.\nIf you want to transfer the ownership info as well you could use tarfor example to archive the file including (almost) all metadata. Then transfer the archive to A and extract it with the appropriate options to keep the original ownerships.\n", "Q: Vim change colorscheme and vimrc location file I am under Ubuntu 11.04 and when I type vim -v in the shell I get this:\n version 7.3.35  \n\nFirst, I want to say that I don't see any file called vimrc under my home folder.

Due to some issues after installing Ubuntu first time, I reinstalled it and now I have 3 Swaps. \nHere is sudo fdisk -l result\nDisk /dev/sda: 750.2 GB, 750156374016 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 91201 cylinders, total 1465149168 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0xaa9693fe\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1            2048    52430847    26214400   1c  Hidden W95 FAT32 (LBA)\n/dev/sda2   *    52430848   540677076   244123114+   7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda3       540678142  1465147391   462234625    5  Extended\nPartition 3 does not start on physical sector boundary.\n/dev/sda5      1452750848  1465147391     6198272   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n/dev/sda6      1440352256  1452742655     6195200   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n/dev/sda7       540678144  1427951615   443636736   83  Linux\n/dev/sda8      1427953664  1440339967     6193152   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\nSo Swaps in /dev/sda5 and /dev/sda6 are no longer in use as far as I understand and thus I was planning to delete them, however faced a problem. \nWhat I did is download and burn Gparted Live CD and boot it up, tried to delete those partitions but I have no idea how to add 12GB unallocated memory to the existing OS partition in this case to /dev/sda7   Is there anyway I can delete 2 swaps and extend unallocated memory to /dev/sda7 partion? \nThank you in advance! \n\nA: I find using gparted much easier for this, since it shows the actual layout order for the partitions.  Using gparted, I would probably delete sda8 and sda6, and leave sda5, which is already at the end, and edit fstab to use sda5.  Then it's easy to grow sda7 to use the space above it that was being used by the swap drives.\nTo edit /etc/fstab is not hard; if you don't know how, I can tell you the details, but the basic drill is to run sudo blkid -c /dev/null in a terminal to get a list of all the UUIDs.  The addition of the \"-c /dev/null\" just insures that it doesn't use a cache, so you get any recent changes.  Once you get the UUID for sda5, simply substitute it for the existing on in your fstab file.  You will need to edit it using sudo, and a text editor such as gedit or vim.\nLines starting with \"#\" are comments. The line to change will look something like this:\n# swap was on /dev/sda8 during installation\nUUID=000-0000-0000-0000-00000000 none swap sw 0 0. \nThe UUID (shown as all zeros) is made up of hexadecimal digits (the letters A-F, plus numbers). The results of blkid will look similar \nTo delete the swap file, you may need to disable it (right-click and select swapoff in gparted).\nEDIT:  More details for user.\nYou will need to use a live CD with gparted.  Either the gparted lived CD or the install CD will work.  It's pretty easy, actually. The first thing to do after running gparted is to select your disk drive in the upper-right, if it's not shown.  It may be \nYou will see a representation of your disk layout at the top of the window.  You should have all 3 swap drives at the end, on the right, labeled sda8, sda6, sda5.  The numbering isn't by position.  To grow sda7, you need to have space adjacent to it, so you will not delete the swap drive furthest to the right.\nAll you have to do is click on the partition, either on the top graphic, or the list below.  The swap drive will say \"Linux-swap\" in the column for File System, and there's really no danger of deleting the wrong swap drive, unless you're really low on memory, possibly.  In fact, I just discovered my swap drive has been disabled for a while. \nSo, right-click on each of the two near, but not at, the end (leave the one at the end) and select \"Swapoff\".  You should then be able to delete them when you right-click.  Then, right click on the main sda7 partition, and select \"resize/move\", and then grab the right-hand side and drag it as far to the right as you can.\nThis doesn't do anything yet.  You have to select \"Apply all operations\" from the Edit menu, or click the checkmark toolbar button.  That's it.\n\nA: Please, before do this, I recomend to wait until someone validate this answer. If somethign go wrong, tell me and I will help you.\nUse the program gparted, it will do the work for you. If you haven't got the program, install it from software center.\nwhen you open the program this is shown:\n\nThen, you will have a lot of \"linux-swap\" partitions. \nThen right click and delete\nIf you can not delete the partitions:\nIn a terminal put:\nsudo swapoff\n\nAnd now your swap partitions are unmounted. So in gparted, delete the partitions you want to delete.\nAfter that, type in terminal:\nsudo swapon\n\nAnd the swap partitions not deleted will be mounted.\nIf an error is get by the swapon, you have to change the fstab like the answer above mine told you. I can explain in more details if it is necessary.\n\nA: For the other ask.\nYou want to allocate the swap partitions that are deleted to you sda7 partition...\nIf the partitions is in use (when your data or your programs are installed) you have to do this in a liveCD or liveUSB.)\nThen, in gparted (installing it in a livecd session) right click in the partition you want to resize (sda7) and click move/resizze, then put the maximun size.\nMake a back up first of your important data, I'm not sure if this can delete your data in sda7. Also, you can make a mistake deleting the wrong partition (I did this mistake one time..)\n", "Q: Cannot start ubuntu-desktop I am mainly a Windows technician and am trying to install Ubuntu server.

Since my PC is very old and not very fast with Windows 7, I decided to give Ubuntu a try, so I downloaded and installed Ubuntu 11.10 today. When I first started it, I had bad  800x600 resolution and it was very slow and annoying. So I installed a driver for my graphic card and now everything looks very nice (1280x1024).But I think  it's still far slower than Windows 7.\nI tried to run in Ubuntu like a few people suggested on the forum but if I log in I get a black screen saying something like \"this video mode cannot be displayed\". I get that same screen when booting Ubuntu btw, but after about 15 seconds it disappears and just starts Ubuntu.\nI also installed other drivers for my graphic card but everything stayed the same. \nI noticed that i.e. when I open Firefox or system settings it takes about 5 seconds till it opens (while Windows 7 takes under 1 second to start i.e. Chrome) and when I do this my CPU usage gets to 100% for a short time. \nComputer specs:\nMemory: 2GB RAM\nProcessor: Intel Pentium 4  2.8GHz\nGraphics Card: Nvidia GeForce 6800 400MHz.  \nI read on various forums that 11.04 works flawless on many PCs, where 11.10 is very slow. Should I install 11.04 or could anybody help me with this problem?\n\nA: To get Ubuntu 2D to work, you should try running nvidia-settings to configure the X server more precisely.  Under \"X Server Display Configuration\", set the desired resolution instead of leaving it on auto.  Then click \"Save to X configuration file\" (it should be /etc/X11/xorg.conf) and reboot. Then try logging into Ubuntu 2D.\nAnother possible explanation is that you are feeling the performance penalty from running off a Wubi-installed partition.  See What performance differences are there when installing with Wubi? for example.

I would say that your hardware is determining the capable burn speeds. You can look at your burner and see its capable speeds.\nYou can get other burning programs such as \nK3b:\nsudo apt-get install k3b\n\nThis will install another burner you can try to use and see if it has settings to lower the speed as well.\n", "Q: how tell Thunderbird to open links in a certain Firefox instance?

It should be libgsl0-dev. They erroneously substituted a numeric one for the second letter \"l\"\n\nA: Packages called libSOMETHING-dev (or sometimes ANYTHING-dev) are development packages, which you need to compile programs from source when the program uses the libSOMETHING library.

Is there a workaround?\nIf I install the extension will it devoid my browser's security. \n\nA: Installing any extension can lessen your overall Browser security - so make sure you download from a known and trusted source.  Best to use the browser recommended addons and then look at the comments to see the stability and any potential issues.\nIn terms of the User Agent - this is an old technique used by some websites to change the website page content depending upon the browser being used.\nSome websites that have been implemented with specific browsers in mind block access to browsers  it doesnt support.  Usually the less used browsers are affected and changing the User Agent is a way to fool the website (if its been poorly programmed)  to believing it is a supported browser that it is serving its content to.\nIt will not affect your overall browser security - google chrome is well sandboxed anyway.\nYou can use an extension to change the User Agent on a per-tab basis.  However, since v17, Chrome has this capability built it.\nLet me show you...\npress CTRL+SHIFT+I to go into developer mode.\n\nClick the Settings symbol as shown.\n\nExpand the pane as shown and click the Override User Agent tick box\n\nChoose the user agent you want to emulate.\nClose Developer Mode via CTRL+SHIFT+I\n\nA: User Agent is an HTTP header (i.e. one of the strings your browser sends to the server) which identifies... well, user agent, i.e. which browser is used to access the page\ni.e. when accessing google.com, my browser sends something like this:\nAccept  text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\nAccept-Encoding gzip, deflate\nAccept-Language en-us,en;q=0.7,ru;q=0.3\nCache-Control   max-age=0\nConnection  keep-alive\nCookie  ...\nHost    www.google.com\nUser-Agent  Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:11.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/11.0\n\nSome sites use User-Agent header for \"browser sniffing\", i.e. to check which browser is used and to provide different code to different browsers. This was more popular ~10 years ago when browsers capabilities varied wildly.\nInstalling a Chrome extension would allow you to change the string your browser uses to identify itself (btw, Opera has this built in). This may fool some site, but it does not change browser behaviour (i.e. it does not make Chrome to render pages as IE not does it add support for, say ActiveX components - which, in fact, may be the reason why that site requires IE6)\nSo, provided the extension you're going to install is safe itself, the level of browser security will stay just the same.\n(as a web developer I have serious doubts that any web site which works in IE6 only is worth visiting...)\n\nA: I don't have a working chrome at the moment to test anything, but you can set the user agent via chromium-browser --user-agent=\"Firefox/3.5.5\n", "Q: How do I install UControl How do I install UControl from http://www.negusoft.com/index.php/ucontrol-downloads\nIt comes in a tar.gz.

I don't know if this is possible and already done automatically when logging in with Ubuntu One, but can I synchronise bookmarks from Firefox to Ubuntu One automatically?\nSo that I can add bookmarks on the same computer from Ubuntu 11.10 to 12.10 or even from a newer installation of Ubuntu.\nIf it is possible, how can I do that?\n\nA: We did have a bookmark synchronisation solution for Ubuntu One in the shape of the Bindwood extension.  As that depended on CouchDB synchronisation, which we have since disabled, it is no longer a viable option.\nIt may get resurrected when U1DB matures, but for now we do not have a good synchronisation solution that will merge changes between sets of bookmarks in a useful way.\nFor now, you might want to try out Firefox's built in bookmark synchronisation, which can be configured from the Sync tab of its preferences window.\n\nA: If I understood your question, this should work for you:\nGo to ~/.mozilla, or/home/your-user-name/.mozilla. Inside the .mozilla folder you will notice a firefox folder. Look inside the firefox folder for your user profile folder, it will have a series of numbers and letters (something like this: u7qqadwy.default). Inside that folder you'll see a folder called bookmarkbackups. Open the backup's folder and you'll notice a few different files which will be named with a date and a json extension on the end like this: bookmarks-2012-04-13.json. Simply copy the latest few dated files to your new profile and place them in the same firefox directory. You'll need to open Firefox and go to Bookmarks-Show All Bookmarks. From there click on the import & backup link. You'll get a pop-up window that should open in the same directory you pasted the old bookmarks into. Select the latest one and choose import. You'll now have your old bookmarks in the new profile.\nYou can do the same thing if you have saved passwords. Just go to the .mozilla folder open your profile folder again and copy the cert8.db, permissions.sqlite, and signons.sqlite files. Paste those files into the new directory over-writing the old ones and restart Firefox.\n", "Q: TTY characters mixed up after device cat or Python print So, when I cat /dev/input/mouse0 in a TTY, move the mouse around a bit, and then ctrl-z to stop cat, my terminal characters are all messed up.  Almost every single character gets swapped out for another character in the ASCII character set.  This same situation occurs when I execute this in Python 3.2:\nprint('\\033[1;12mTest.\\033[1;m')\n\nThe the same symptom does not appear on a shell in the GUI, only on the virtual terminals.  The problem does not go away if I log out.  I suspect that a certain escape code (which may be contained within the Python code) is remapping the ASCII byte codes to the character representations, but that is just a guess.  What is happening and how do I undo it?\n\nA: I finally found the command that I was looking for on Command Line Fu.  The command is reset.  I tried it, and it worked perfectly, without logging out or restarting the system.\n\nA: When outputting binary files to the terminal, like your cat /dev/input/mouse0, you can send it ANY character. This can confuse the virtual terminal.\nThe character string ESC [ introduces a \"VT100 Control sequence\" (compatibility with an old glass keypunch). Other characters like ^Q, ^S, ^N, ^O do magic things based on compatibility with Model 35 Teletypes with paper tape reader/punch.\nWhen I'm trying to de-confuse a terminal, I do:\nIs output frozen? Type ^Q (ctrl-Q) (the XON character, to start the paper tape reader).\nType the command stty sane. If there are no characters echoed as you type, stty echo will restore the echo.\nRead man stty, and you'll see how you can save a set of terminal settings, and restore them later!\nBTW, stopping a program uses crtl-C to stop a program. Ctrl-Z just interrupts the program, in preparation for putting it in the background. Some programs catch ^C and do some necessary cleanup, file saving, etc. on the way out. If you just ^Z and run something else, this cleanup doesn't get done.\n", "Q: Dual VGA Cards Intel/ Nvidia This is my first post in this forum.

I was able to set this up fine and getting working on my Ubuntu 11.10 Desktop.\nI've looked at several other posts, but none of them fix my problem. Any ideas?\n\nA: Ubuntu doesn't support looking up hosts by NetBIOS name using NSS. In other words, you can't do ping netbiosname except if you use nss_wins.\nIf you have a WINS server you can set up nss_wins and use that to resolve NetBIOS names.\nAlternatively, you can use something like Avahi or DNS.\n\nA: If your ubuntu server has a fixed IP address, you can try to put the address in hosts file on windows machines.  I never figured out how NetBIOS work.  So I just use fixed IP + hosts files in my LAN.\n", "Q: Package power limit notification?

I cannot get to any of my files and I downloaded Ubuntu to my external hard drive and tried to install it but I keep getting the error that the drives are not ready and I have to do this in safe mode.\n\nA: The first thing that I would try and do would be to log into Safe Mode into Windows and verify that you have activated the version of Windows or in this case Vista.  If your sister did not have an access key after installing Vista she has 30 days to input a valid key.  \nThis could be as simple as making sure you have an Internet connection, then search for Activate Windows and as long as every thing is good (product key, etc.) you will have full functioning Windows.  However, my recommendation would be to burn an ISO of Ubuntu on a CD (Live CD), boot off the Live CD and drop Vista.  I made the switch 4 months ago and I love every minute of it!\n", "Q: Microphone not working in Skype unless I switch off autospawn in Pulseaudio I have a clean install of Precise with Gnome fall-back desktop on an Acer Aspire lappie.  The mic won't work on Skype unless I switch off 'autospawn' in pulseaudio.  That solution kills all audio controls for the system (but the mic works in Skype). \nWould be nice to simply fix the mic in Skype and not mess up the GUI controls for the system.   Does anybody have a solution for this?\n\nA: Not sure how to get to the \"multimedia > phonon > audio recording\" setting mentioned above; but I managed to sort out my own particular issue as follows (and this might not be 100% related to the OPs issue, but there seem to be many people looking for such help)\nI noticed that Skype was using my webcam mic, which is built into my monitor and too far away to be useful.  I wanted it to use my headphone mic.  It seemed hard to convince it to change.  Eventualy, I ran pavucontrol, started a test call in Skype, which brought Skype onto the \"recording\" tab, and here I could see it was recording from the monitor webcam device.  So I chose the internal audio device (basically, my sound card), and all was working well (if a little too loud, but that's easily solved, you never heard anyone complain their mic is too loud in skype!)\nNo idea why it's so hard to point an application at a different device, or maybe it's skype's fault for not using some sort of 'default' (though I don't see any concept of a default input device in pavucontrol)\nHTH\n\nA: I solved this problem after months and months of not being able to get it working properly.\nI discovered that this laptop has \"stereo, or mono\" input via the built in microphone (sorry, can't remember which, but the solution was to open pavucontrol, split the channels on the input (microphone) and reduce the volume of one of the to zero.  Works perfectly, haven't had a problem since. I now use Alsa and Pulse, all normal.\n\nA: Had the same problem. solved it by going to the system setting > multimedia > phonon > audio recording > selected my webcam microphone and clicked prefer until webcam microphone was on the top for all settings in the audio recording section.  I then did an echo test call in skype and everything worked.\n", "Q: What Is The Best HDR Software? How can I go about HDRI software for Ubuntu 12.04 Beta2? Your help would be highly. appreciated\n\nA: Macrofusion - maybe not best, but worth to try:  \nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/macrofusion/\n... and PPA:\nhttps://launchpad.net/~dhor/+archive/myway \nDisclaimer: I am the developer/maintainer of Macrofusion.\n\nA: There are some great tools for the Photographer to utilize. I can name more than a dozen but lets focus on the main object. Getting the right look for an HDR photo.\n\nYou will need Ufraw to process RAW photos \nYou will need Luminance HDR and the Hugin plug-in to process HDR images\nYou will need Gimp for the final touches\n\nLet me cover 3 things to be able to develop HDR photos\nSetup or Pre-process:\nTaking the photos is just the beginning to the end. You will need 3 or more photos of the same object, from the same distance with the same focus but with different exposures. \nSee this Tutorial for Pre-Process setup and recommendations\n\nHDR Development:\nThis is where the magic starts to happen. Using 3, 5, 7, 9 or more photos you will have a deviation of exposures and will combined them using the software indicated. The Hugin plugin is used for straightening the edges and layering the images on top of each other. \nSee this Tutorial for HDR Development using Luminance\n\nPost processing: \nI like to use GIMP to manipulate the final image settings. This way the photographer gives the photo its final blessing. \nSee this Tutorial for Post Processing using GIMP\n\nA: Look at Luminance HDR.\nThese notes might be useful.\nIt was called Qtpfsgui earlier.\nAnd fotoxx (from the comments here) is also an Ubuntu package -- Looks promising, I'll try it too.\n\nA: For me it depends for what arrangement you need it. For example, for iPhone or for MAC. By the way, for MAC I recommend the next one: https://aurorahdr.com/ You already have a pending invitation to this account which I found very efficient.\n", "Q: My logon and logout taking too much time ! is there a way to make them fast ? I regularly use bleachbit to clean my system. Though Login and Logout now taking lots of time.Is there a way to make at least Login faster ?\nI have done some Kernel updates. I have three different version of kernels now. Does this causing the slow startup ?? I every time select a kernel, then a red screen appears for almost 14 sec then comes up the Ubuntu screen. and lastly login screen.\nI want to just go into the login screen after selecting kernel. Is there a way to do something like that ? How can i make system start faster ?\n\nA: I feel the main reason for being my startup too much slow is the Wubi Installation. If you want a fast working OS then you need to install it in a separate drive.\nIm using Wubi and I have installed Ubuntu on top of Windows 7, Thats why it taking too much time to read(mount) things from HDD.\n", "Q: Does running Nexuiz gives extra pressure on Processor if you dont have external Graphics card? Its a rather stupid question, though I want to be sure. Does having a external graphics card can lower the stress over the processor? what kind of graphics card Ubuntu supports ?\nWell I'm planning to buy a graphics card for Windows 7 as I have started learning Adobe Premiere Pro. Which G card should I buy? Do i consider the card or the availability of the card drivers for Ubuntu Linux ? \nIf I install a Graphics card and does not install its drivers can I left it unused on Ubuntu ? I don't think theres a much need for G card on Ubuntu Though.\n\nA: Ubuntu's driver manager probably has the driver for whichever Nvidia or ATI card you get. A quick websearch yielded this post which mentions a few nvidia cards that should work in Ubuntu.\nWindows 7 is already a few years old, so the win7 logo on the box is not a bad thing to have, and should have the drivers disc for windows 7 in the box (which is useful if you plan on using win7 with that card). A dedicated graphics card has its own GPU. The newer CPU's have built-in GPU in my understanding, mind you in theory having a dedicated graphics card would lighten the burden on the CPU for graphics rendering.\n\nA: Here is a link that others may find useful: \nConfigure Graphics on Ubuntu- http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/xorg\n", "Q: How to create a Windows like restore point using Deja Dup ? When I click on Deja-Dup Storage, I can see there are some Ubuntu folders,Ubuntu One, WebDav and all the Windows drive visible. \nIf I select a windows drive for my backup is it going to backup all files including my installed softwares, muzic, movies- everything ?!\nWhen I open/closes a windows drive it mounts and unmounts. If I select that option does it going to cause any mount/unmount problem ?\nWhat is WebDav ?\n\nA: Deja Dup is asking you where you want to store the backup files. It packages them up instead of storing them bare in the filesystem like using the copy command would, so storing them on remote machines or in different locales isn't a problem.  \nBy default I believe Deja Dup only backs up your home directory. An easy way to 'backup' the package-manager-installed packages, you can do dpkg --get-selections > ~/Desktop/installed_packages.txt, and on the new system you can restore it by doing dpkg --set-selections < ~/Desktop/installed_packages.txt and then sudo dselect and going to Install. That will download and install all the packages the package manager had installed on your old system, and by having the installed_packages.txt file on your desktop it will get backed up with the rest of your home directory.\nI'm not aware of a way of forcing it to do a full backup, though it may be possible if you read through the documentation for Deja Dup and Duplicity (the program Deja Dup is based on).\nWebdav = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV\n\nA: If you use WUBI then login Windows. Goto c:/ copy the ubuntu,wubi etc ubuntu related folders to a seperate directory (d:/).\nIf you messed up ,uninstall ubuntu using Wubi from windows control panel (will take only a sec). Again using Wubi Install ubuntu. Should be offline Installation.\nNow copy ubuntu related files from d:/ and replace them with the new installation.\n", "Q: Syncing iPod through banshee I tried \"importing to library\" then all the music is in my library, but when I disconnect the Ipod the music isn't playable.\n\nA: Check outh these two articles the might help.\nUses of iPods With Banshee in Ubuntu\nThe Banshee Music Player\n", "Q: Creating symlink for Postgres As a developer, I often ssh right into my local database, just to test my application before pushing my code.\nHowever, I find that every time I want to access Postgres, I have to type in \npostgres@ubuntu:~$ /usr/local/pgsql/bin/psql test\n\nwhereas on my work machine, all I have to do is type\npostgres@ubuntu:~$ psql --dbname=test --username=user\n\nI tried creating a symlink, which was successful, but whenever I try connecting to it through this shortcut, I get the following error message:\npsql: could not connect to server: No such file or directory\n    Is the server running locally and accepting\n    connections on Unix domain socket \"/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432\"?\n\nHow do I get this to work?

PL2303 Serial Port\n\nttyUSBX is just a usb hardware that linux detected as an attached device but it is not communicable as a serial port. in windows we have COMX port and USB device and while Serial driver not installed it can not be used as COM Port. i think ttyUSBX should first detected as a COM Port (ttysX)!\n\nA: While it might not be immediately obvious, there is an extra /dev/ttyUSB1 entry in the second listing of /dev.  That would be the second USB serial device you plugged in (I assume you left the first one connected, which shows up as `/dev/ttyUSB0 in both listings).\n\nA: *\n\n*Unplug your device\n\n*Type tail -F /var/log/kern.log\n\n*Replug your device\n\n*There will be a line stating something like:\n[1060037.921203] usb 2-2.1: Prolific Technology, Inc. PL2303 Serial Port converter now attached to ttyUSB1\nIn this case the device is attached to /dev/ttyUSB1\nUsing udev, it might be possible to create a symlink with a name that doesn't change with replugging. Now the Serial Port converters get a ttyUSB name in order they are plugged. It is outside the scope of this question, so create a specific one when required.\n", "Q: How to link to executable file in ubuntu 11.10 with cairo dock? I am using ubuntu 11.10 with cairo dock in an acer aspire with core i3 2nd gen processor with intel graphics.\nI downloaded a program gingkocad as a tar file, opened the package with archive manager and created a folder for the package contents.\nTo run the program I need to click the executable to run in terminal.  \nIs there a way to create a shortcut to run the executable from an icon in cairo dock ?\nPlease help.\n\nA: Just drag the executable onto Cairo Dock. But don't drag it onto an already placed icon. Put it in between two icons. That's it.\n\nA: The shortcut-icon in cairo-dock are called launchers. Cairo-dock supports drag and drop.\n\n\n*\n\n*Try dragging and dropping the application executable into any space between icons already on dock. This works for a good number of applications.\n\n*If that fails, try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*right-click on the dock, then select add>custom-launcher.\n\n*A new window will appear. Fill the field Launcher name with the name of your application, and 'command to run on click' with the full path to executable file.\n\n*Then click apply at the bottom right corner, and you should be done.\n\n\n\nThis method, however, does not provide some features such as having quicklists. To achieve quicklists:\nFor advanced users\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a editor of your choice. ( Novice users can search for 'text editor' in dash and use gedit. - gedit is the text editor that appears in Dash)\n\n*Make a .desktop file with the required quick-lists.\nThis can be used as a reference.\nAnd here's a nice link explaning all the options possible in a .desktop file.\n(Note: X-* options are excluded here, as they are considered non-standard)\n\n*Save the file as <your application name>.desktop\n\n*Drag and drop this to cairo-dock. (on space between icons)\n\n\nThis will always work, provided the .desktop file is made correctly.\n", "Q: postgresql server fail to start ubuntu?

To install:\nsudo apt-get install cernlib\n\n\nA: There are quite a lot of software available in ubuntu repo.\nSome programming background is essential while choosing the one fits your need.\n\n\n*\n\n*C/C++ : Octave + gnuplot (Numerical analysis)\n\n*python : Blender, i personally recommend this one. Download a latest version of this software from its official site. It has physics render engine. yet the learning curve is steep.here are some videos\n\nA: If you are used to Matlab, you may use Octave to edit m files. You can perform many numerical analysis tasks with Octave or Python. Make sure you have the correct libraries when using Python for plotting and analysis. (e.g. matplotlib, etc.).\n\nA: You can try scilab  which is available in the Ubuntu software-center.\n"]
